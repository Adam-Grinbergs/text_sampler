Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212  

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The following report was prepared to provide a NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report and 
Updated Resource Estimate of the gold, silver, copper, molybdenum and rhenium mineralization 
at the Snowfield Property and the gold and silver mineralization at the adjacent Brucejack 
Property, Skeena Mining Division, British Columbia (the "Snowfield-Brucejack Project" or "the 
Properties").  
 
In 2010, pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement between Silver Standard Resources Inc. 
("Silver Standard") and Pretium Resources Inc. ("Pretivm"), Pretivm became the owner of the 
Snowfield-Brucejack Project, and currently retains a 100% outright interest in the two Properties 
comprising it.  
 
The Snowfield Property is composed of one mineral claim (509216) and two placer claims, 
totalling 2,142.2 ha in area and all claims are in good standing until January 31, 2017.The 
Brucejack Property consists of six mineral claims totalling 3,199.28 ha in area and all claims are 
in good standing until January 31, 2017. 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project basically falls within the boundaries of the Cassiar-Iskut-
Stikine Land and Resource Management Plan ("LRMP") areawith only a minor south-eastern 
segment of Mineral Claim No. 509506 of the Brucejack Property falling outside this area.All 
claims located within the boundaries of the LRMP are considered as areas of General 
Management Direction however, none of the claims fall inside any Protected or Special 
Management Area.At present the land claims in the area are in review and subject to ongoing 
discussions between various native groups and the Government of British Columbia.  
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project is approximately centred atLatitude 56°28′20″N by Longitude 
130°11′31″W, a position approximately 950 km northwest of Vancouver, 65 km north-northwest 
of Stewart, and 21 km south-southeast of the Eskay Creek Mine.  
 
The Project area is located in the Boundary Range of the Coast Mountain physiographic belt 
along the western margin of the Intermontane Tectonic Belt. The local terrain is generally steep 
with local reliefs of 1000 m from valleys occupied by receding glaciers, to ridges at elevations of 
1200 m asl. Elevations within the Project area range from 1000 m along the Mitchell Glacier to 
1960 m asl along the ridge between the Mitchell and Hanging Glaciers. However, within several 
areas of the Project, such as at the gossanous Snowfield deposit, the relief is relatively low to 
moderate. 
 
The Project area is easily accessible with the use of a chartered helicopter from the town of 
Stewart, or seasonally from the settlement of Bell II. The flight time from Stewart is 
approximately 30 minutes and slightly less from Bell II; however, Stewart has the advantage of 
having an established year-round helicopter base.  
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project lies immediately east of Seabridge Gold Inc.'s (Seabridge's) 
KSM Project and would likely be influenced by future access plans for that area, as outlined 
within the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) study by Seabridge (McElhanney 
Consulting Services Ltd. [McElhanney], 2008; Wardrop, 2009a). The proposed development 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. ii   
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212  

activities for the KSM Project call for a combined 23 km tunnel for slurry delivery to the 
processing plant site located at the upper reaches of the Tiegen Creek Valley and a 14 km gravel 
road that would allow material to be trucked to the paved Cassiar highway (Highway 37). In 
addition, road access to Mitchell Creek itself would be provided by a 34 km continuation of the 
Eskay Creek Mine access road. 
 
There are no local resources other than abundant water for any drilling work. The nearest 
infrastructure is the town of Stewart, approximately 65 km to the south, which has a minimum of 
supplies and personnel. The towns of Terrace and Smithers are also located in the same general 
region as the Project. Both are directly accessible by daily air service from Vancouver. 
 
The nearest railway is the Canadian National Railway (CNR) Yellowhead route, which is located 
approximately 220 km to the southeast. This line runs east-west and terminates at the deep water 
port of Prince Rupert on the west coast of BC. The bulk handling port at Stewart is the most 
northerly ice-free shipping port in North America, and is accessible to store and ship 
concentrates. Such material is currently being shipped from the Wolverine and Huckleberry 
mines via this terminal.  
 
A proposal to have a high voltage power line run parallel with existing lines along Highway 37 is 
currently under review (www.highway37.com). 
 
The initial plan calls for the new 287-kV line that would extend from the community of Terrace 
to the beginning of the Galore Creek access road at Bob Quinn Lake providing access for the 
project to the BC Hydro electric grid. The final capacity of this transmission line has yet to be 
determined and may be increased due to projected demand. 
 
The exploration history of the area dates back to the 1880s when placer gold was located at 
Sulphurets and Mitchell Creeks. Placer mining was intermittently undertaken throughout the 
early 1900s and remained the main focus of prospecting until the mid-1930s. 
 
In 1935, prospectors discovered Cu-Mo mineralization on the Sulphurets property in the vicinity 
of the Main Copper zone, approximately six km northwest of Brucejack Lake; however, these 
claims were not staked until 1960. 
 
From 1935 to 1959, the area was relatively inactive with respect to prospecting; however, it was 
intermittently evaluated by a number of different parties and several small Cu and Au-Ag 
occurrences were discovered in the Sulphurets-Mitchell Creek area. 
 
In 1960, Granduc and Alaskan prospectors staked the main claim group covering the known Cu 
and Au-Ag occurrences, which collectively became known as the Sulphurets property, starting 
the era of modern exploration. Various operators explored the Sulphurets Property, and an 
underground program was completed on the West Zone between 1986 and 1991 by the Newcana 
JV. 
 
In 1980 Esso optioned the Sulphurets property and conducted detailed geological mapping, 
trenching, and rock geochemical sampling. The results of this work led to the discovery of the 
Snowfield, Quartz Stockwork, and Moly zones.

From 1981 to 1983 Esso continued exploring the Snowfield zone which appeared to have the 
potential for a large, low grade gold deposit. The company excavated and sampled 24 trenches, 
totalling 192 m, in the Snowfield zone outlining a 240 m by 120 m area of gold mineralization 
with an average grade of 0.088 oz/t gold (McCrea, 2007). Their work also discovered the 
Josephine zone with vein-hosted gold-silver mineralization.  
 
Between 1986 and 1999 various operators explored the Sulphurets Property, and an underground 
program was completed on the West Zone between 1986 and 1991 by the Newcana JV. 
 
In 1999, Silver Standard acquired Newhawk and with it, Newhawk's 60% interest and control of 
the Brucejack and Snowfield claim groups. 
 
From 2006 to 2010 Silver Standard continued extensive drilling at the Snowfield project. A first, 
NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate was prepared in 2006, with updates to the resources 
completed in 2008, two in 2009 and another in 2010. Work on the Brucejack portion of the 
project by Silver Standard began in 2009 with a large diamond drilling campaign and resampling 
program of historical core, followed by a NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report and Resource 
Estimate completed by P&E Mining Consultants Inc.  
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project and the surrounding Sulphurets district are underlain by the 
Upper Triassic and Lower to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group of volcanic, volcaniclastic, and 
sedimentary rocks. According to Roach and MacDonald (1992), the stratigraphic assemblage 
comprises a package, from oldest to youngest, of: 
 

• Lower Unuk River Formation: alternating siltstone and conglomerate; 
• Upper Unuk River Formation: alternating intermediate volcanic rock and 

siltstone; 
• Betty Creek Formation: alternating conglomerate, sandstone, and intermediate to 

mafic volcanic rock; 
• Mount Dilworth Formation: felsic pyroclastic tuffaceous rock and flows. 
• Salmon River and Bowser Formations: alternating siltstone and sandstone. 
• Britton and Alldrick (1988) described three intrusive episodes in the area 

including intermediate to felsic plutons that are probably coeval with volcanic and 
volcaniclastic supracrustal rocks, small stocks related to the Cretaceous Coast 
Plutonic Complex, and minor tertiary dykes and sills. 

 
The Hazelton Group lithologies display fold styles ranging from gently warped to tight 
disharmonic folds. Northerly striking, steep normal faults are common and syn-volcanic, syn-
sedimentary, and syn-intrusive faults have been inferred in the region. Minor thrust faults, 
dipping westerly, are common in the region and are important in the northern and western parts 
of the Sulphurets area in regard to the interpretation of mineralized zones. Metamorphic grade 
throughout the area is, at least, lower greenschist. 
 
There are more than seventy documented mineral occurrences and showings in the Sulphurets 
area. Copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver mineralization found within gossans have affinities 
to both porphyry and mesothermal to epithermal types of vein deposits. Most mineral deposits 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. iv

occur in the upper members of the Unuk River Formation or the lower members of the Betty 
Creek Formation. 
 
Snowfield Deposit  
 
The Snowfield Deposit is a near-surface, low grade, bulk tonnage, and porphyry-style gold 
deposit with associated silver, copper, molybdenum and rhenium mineralization.  
 
Gold mineralization is hosted by schistose, pervasively altered (quartz-sericite-chlorite) volcanic 
and volcaniclastic rocks that contain 1% to 5% disseminated pyrite, minor disseminations, 
veinlets of tourmaline, molybdenite, and abundant younger calcite veinlets. 
 
Gold mineralization occurs as microscopic grains (less than 30 µm) of electrum that are encased 
within fine-grained, pervasively disseminated pyrite in close association with trace amounts of 
galena and sphalerite (Margolis, 1993). Other associated minerals within the gold-mineralized 
zone include: tetrahedrite-tennantite, barite, acanthite, minor Mn-rich calcite, and rare 
chalcopyrite. Minute clusters, approximately 75 µm, of pyrite and rutile (+ barite) are also 
observed within the gold-bearing mineralization (Margolis, 1993). 
 
One hundred ninety two (192) drill holes were used to estimate the current resources for 
Snowfield. Conceptual optimized Whittle pit shells were developed based on all available 
mineral resources (Measured, Indicated and Inferred). Commodity prices are based on the three-
year trailing average as of December 31, 2010. The results from the optimized pit-shells are used 
solely for the purpose of reporting mineral resources that have reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction. 
 
At Snowfield, drilling coverage increased from the 141 diamond drillholes used in the previous 
mineral resource estimate to the 192 drillholes used in the current mineral resource estimate. 
Definition of the mineralized zone expanded 196% by volume, primarily in the Upper Zone 
along the southern margin due to the additional drilling. Overall grades remained the same. 
 
The current, updated resources at Snowfield were derived from modeling the deposit and 
subsequently defining resources in optimized pits at 0.30 g/t AuEq cut-off. In order to depict the 
sensitivity of the resources –to changes in cut-off grade estimates were also completed at 0.5 g/t 
AuEq  and 1.5 g/t AuEq cut-offs as shown in the Tables below. The resources are defined within 
Whittle optimized pit shells that incorporate project metal recoveries, estimated operating costs 
and metals price assumptions

A positive Preliminary Assessment ("PA") for the combined Snowfield-Brucejack Project was 
delivered by Wardrop Engineering in October 2010, and was based on information up to the end 
of 2009. Subsequent drilling completed in 2010 has allowed Pretivm to redefine resources (P&E 
2011) using lower cut-off grades based on recent increases in precious metal prices. The 
substantial increase in the current P&E 2011 Mineral Resource Estimate compared to that used 
in the Wardrop 2010 PA is due in large part to the 17,976 meters of in-fill drilling, completed in 
the 2010 Snowfield drill program and utilized by P&E to update the existing Resource Estimates.  
The Wardrop PA recommended continuing with a pre-feasibility study at Snowfield.  
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. vi   
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212  

It is recommended, based on the current updated resource estimate, to undertake the following at 
Snowfield: 
 

• Continue with engineering, environmental and metallurgical studies toward 
fulfilling the requirements for the pre-feasibility study; 

• Complete approximately 10,000 metres of diamond drilling in the recently 
outlined high grade copper zone in the south-eastern part of the deposit with the 
goal of expanding the zone. 

 
This work should be undertaken simultaneously at an approximate cost of $4 M. 
 
Brucejack Deposit 
 
Most, if not all of the mineralization on the Brucejack Property has been classified as Epithermal 
Au-Ag-Cu, Low-Sulphidation Deposits (UBC deposit model No. H04): It is possible that some 
of the mineralization also displays characteristics of intrusion related vein systems that fall 
within the Intermediate-Sulphidation epithermal subtype.  
 
Among the Brucejack Property gold and silver deposits, the West Zone has received the most 
exploration work to-date and accordingly can be considered somewhat typical of the general 
style of mineralization displayed by the various mineralizing systems comprising the area. The 
mineralization at the West Zone has been characterized as a structurally controlled, complex 
vein/breccia system related to the Brucejack Fault lying to the immediate west. Like the other 
Brucejack Property deposits it is considered to fit the epithermal high-grade, intermediate to low-
sulphidation, Au-Ag model. Other examples in British Columbia include the Blackdome and 
Silbak-Premier Mines. 
 
The current resources as presented in this Technical Report are comprised of nine different zones 
on the Property; the West, West Zone Footwall, Bridge, Bridge Zone Halo, Shore, Galena Hill, 
Gossan Hill, SG and Valley of Kings ("VOK") Zones. 
 
West Zone 
 
The West Zone gold-silver deposit is hosted by a north-westerly trending band of lower Jurassic 
(Unuk River member, Hazelton Group) andesitic and lesser sedimentary rocks, 400 m to 500 m 
wide, that pass between two intrusive bodies of plagioclase-hornblende porphyry. The 
supracrustal rocks are steeply inclined to the northeast and display varying degrees of brittle-
ductile deformation and moderate to intense hydrothermal alteration, particularly where the 
precious metal deposit has been outlined.  
 
The deposit itself comprises at least 10 quartz veins and quartz stockwork shoots, the longest of 
which has a strike length of 250 m and a maximum thickness of about 6 m. Most mineralized 
shoots have vertical extents that are greater than their strike lengths. It appears that ductile 
shearing generated the dilatant structures that served as conduits for the hydrothermal fluids, 
which deposited silica and precious metals.  
 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. vii   
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212  

West Zone Footwall Zone 
 
The West Zone Footwall Zone is located along the entire footwall of the West Zone. It lies 
approximately 50 m to 200 m south-west of the West zone and was intersected by holes SU-63, 
SU-98 and SU-100. These holes cover an area 600 m long. Resources are currently Inferred only. 
 
Bridge Zone 
 
Drilling has determined that the bulk of the gold mineralization at the Bridge Zone is hosted by 
plagioclase-hornblende porphyry intrusive rock that in general is moderately sericite-chlorite 
altered, with disseminated and stringer pyrite making up a few percent of the rock by volume. 
Quartz ± chlorite ± sericite veins, 20-200 cm in thickness, were intermittently intersected by the 
drill holes, and these commonly contain minor to trace amounts of pyrite, sphalerite, galena, 
molybdenite and unknown dark grey, silver-bearing sulfosalt(s). 
 
Bridge Zone Halo Zone 
 
The Bridge Zone Halo Zone was modeled separately from the Bridge Zone as a low grade halo 
in order to ensure that all potentially economic mineralization was captured for mineral resource 
estimation. The Halo Zone was subsequently modeled using a 0.20 g/t Au grade shell.  
 
Galena Hill Zone  
 
The prospect area known as Galena Hill is marked by widespread iron oxide staining of altered 
meta-andesite. Drilling, detailed geological mapping and channel rock-sampling indicate that 
there is a system of east-west and NE-SW trending quartz veins and quartz stockwork which, as 
a whole, define a zone of hydrothermal alteration and mineralization that is at least 400 m long 
and 200 m wide.  
 
As in the West Zone, gold mineralization at the Galena Hill Zone is preferentially associated 
with quartz veins, although the sericite-altered, andesitic host rocks are typically mineralized 
with disseminated pyrite and have geochemically anomalous gold contents, generally in the 
100 to 500 ppb Au range. In some veins, trace amounts of native gold and electrum are 
accompanied by minor to occasionally substantial amounts of sphalerite, chalcopyrite and 
galena.  
 
Shore Zone  
 
The Shore Zone is a zone of quartz veining hosted by foliated, sericite-altered andesite with a 
strike length of roughly 500 m and a maximum width of 50 m. The NW-SE trend of the zone is 
coincident with a pronounced structural lineament, likely a shear fault, which extends from the 
Brucejack Fault south-eastwards beneath Brucejack Lake.  
 
The veins occur as stacked, en echelon, sigmoidal lenses up to 100 m in length and 1.5 m wide, 
although they are typically 20-40 m long. Predominantly composed of quartz with minor 
carbonate and barite, the veins contain podiform sulphide mineralization consisting of varying 
amounts of pyrite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, galena and arsenopyrite. Electrum has been observed 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. viii   
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212  

in trace amounts. Silver is present in some of the highest concentrations observed in the 
Brucejack area.  
 
SG Zone  
 
The SG Zone is represented by an area of iron oxide-stained, sericite-altered rocks that occur 
adjacent to the northerly striking Brucejack Fault. Channel rock sampling done by Silver 
Standard and earlier workers tested a restricted zone of quartz stockwork veining close to the 
major fault as well as an east-striking, 150 m long and 20-80 cm wide quartz vein that extends 
westwards from the stockwork. 
 
Valley of Kings Zone ("VOK") 
 
The Valley of Kings Zone was discovered by Esso in 1981 and was previously referred to as the 
Electrum Zone. It lies between the Bridge and Galena Hill Zones. Very little work has been 
completed on this zone, but what is currently known is that there are multi-kilogram intersections 
in parallel zones. The best intersection to date was in hole SU-12 which yielded 1.5 metres at 
16,949 g/t Au and 8,697 g/t Ag, (previously reported on as being part of the Galena Hill Zone). 
Resources are all currently classified as Inferred in this zone. 
 
Gossan Hill Zone  
 
The mineralized zone known as Gossan Hill is a circular area, about 300 m in diameter, of 
intense quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration developed in Jurassic andesite of the Unuk River member 
of the Betty Creek formation. This visually impressive alteration zone is host to at least eleven 
quartz vein and quartz stockwork structures most of which trend east-west and dip steeply to the 
north. Individual structures are up to 250 m long and 20 m wide.  
 
Precious metal mineralization at the Gossan Hill Zone is sporadic but generally best developed in 
the larger quartz lenses, particularly where these contain minor aggregates of pyrite, tetrahedrite, 
sphalerite and galena. Electrum is rarely observed, while silver also occurs in tetrahedrite, 
pyragyrite and polybasite. 
 
One thousand two (1,002) drill holes were available in the database and of those, 908 were used 
to estimate the current resources.  
 
Conceptual Lerchs-Grossman optimized pit shells were developed based on all available mineral 
resources (Measured, Indicated and Inferred). Commodity prices were based on the three-year 
trailing average as of December 31, 2010. The results from the optimized pit-shells are used 
solely for the purpose of reporting mineral resources that have reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction. 
 
At Brucejack, drilling coverage increased from the 844 diamond drillholes used in the previous 
mineral resource estimate to the 908drillholesused in the current mineral resource estimate. The 
Bridge Zone increased 53% by volume due to the additional drilling, Galena Hill 32% and 
Gossan Hill 275%. In addition, a new mineral resource, the Valley of Kings, was defined by

Silver Standard geologists from drilling and surface mapping of structural features, and is 
characterized by multiple high-grade Au intersections. 
 
All mineral resources were reported against a 0.30g/t Au equivalent cut-off, as constrained 
within the optimized pit shell. Resources for three different pit shells were defined as shown 
below.

It is recommended, based on the current updated resource estimate, to undertake the following at 
Brucejack: 
 

• Complete a PA, which examines the economics of a higher grade mining 
operation in the West Zone and VOK Zone; 

• Complete approximately 50,000 metres of diamond drilling in the known areas of 
high grade mineralization with the intention of : 
• Tightening the drill spacing to increase the levels of confidence to move 

Inferred resources into the Measured and Indicated categories and to 
improve knowledge of the continuity of the high grade mineralization for 
the VOK and other high-grade zones; 

• Testing the high-grade mineralization to depths greater than the current 
650 metres; and 

• Following up on a number of high-grade intercepts encountered in the 
2009 and 2010 drill programs that are not sufficiently defined to be 
included in the high-grade resource. 

• Continue with the metallurgical work initiated prior to the previous PA; 
• Continue with the environmental work initiated prior to the previous PA. 

 
This work should all be undertaken simultaneously at an approximate cost of CDN $16 M.

4.0 LOCATION, ACCESS, CLIMATE, PHYSIOGRAPHY AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
4.1 LOCATION AND ACCESS 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project is situated approximately at 56°28′20″N Latitude by 
130°11′31″WLongitude, a position approximately 950 km northwest of Vancouver, 65 km north-
northwest of Stewart, and 21 km south-southeast of the Eskay Creek Mine.The Project 
coordinates used in this report are located relative to the NAD83 UTM coordinate system. 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project is located in the Boundary Range of the Coast Mountain 
Physiographic Belt along the western margin of the Intermontane Tectonic Belt.The local terrain 
is generally steep with local reliefs of 1000 m from valleys occupied by receding glaciers, to 
ridges at elevations of 1200 m asl.Elevations within the Project area range from 1000 m along 
the Mitchell Glacier to 1960m asl along the ridge between the Mitchell and Hanging 
Glaciers.However, within several areas of the Project, such as at the gossanous Snowfield 
deposit, the relief is relatively low to moderate. 
 
The Project is easily accessible with the use of a chartered helicopter from the town of Stewart, 
or seasonally from the settlement of Bell II.The flight time from Stewart is approximately 
30 minutes and slightly less from Bell II however, Stewart has an established year-round 
helicopter base. 
 
Heavy exploration equipment, fuel, and camp provisions can be transported along a good gravel 
road from Stewart to the Granduc staging site and then flown by helicopter to the Project.This 
combined truck and helicopter transportation method cuts the more expensive helicopter flight 
time in half from Stewart. 
 
4.2 CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The climate is typical of north-western British Columbia with cool, wet summers, and relatively 
moderate but wet winters.Annual temperatures range from +20°C to -20°C.Precipitation is high 
with heavy snowfall accumulations ranging from 10m to 15m at higher elevations and 2m to 3m 
along the lower river valleys.Snow packs cover the higher elevations from October to May.The 
optimum field season is from late June to mid-October. 
 
The tree line is at approximately 1200 m elevation.Sparse fir, spruce, and alder grow along the 
valley bottoms with only scrub alpine spruce, juniper, alpine grass, moss, and heather covering 
the steep valley walls.The Snowfield deposit, at an elevation above 1500 m, has only sparse 
mosses along drainages.Rocky glacial moraine and polished glacial-striated outcrops dominate 
the terrain above tree line.  
 
4.3 INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOCAL RESOURCES 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project lies immediately east of Seabridge Gold Inc.'s (Seabridge's) 
KSM Project and would likely be influenced by future access plans for that area, as outlined 
within the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) study by Seabridge (McElhanney 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 9 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

Consulting Services Ltd. [McElhanney], 2008; Wardrop, 2009a).The proposed development 
activities for the KSM Project call for a combined 23 km tunnel for slurry delivery to the 
processing plant site located at the upper reaches of the Tiegen Creek Valley and a 14km gravel 
road that would allow material to be trucked to the paved Cassiar highway (Highway 37).In 
addition, road access to Mitchell Creek itself would be provided by a 34 km continuation of the 
Eskay Creek Mine access road (Figure 4.1). 
 
There are no local resources other than abundant water for any drilling work.The nearest 
infrastructure is the town of Stewart, approximately 65 km to the south, which has a minimum of 
supplies and personnel.The towns of Terrace and Smithers are also located in the same general 
region as the Project.Both are directly accessible by daily air service from Vancouver. 
 
The nearest railway is the Canadian National Railway (CNR) Yellowhead route, which is located 
approximately 220 km to the southeast.This line runs east-west and terminates at the deep water 
port of Prince Rupert on the west coast of BC. 
 
The most northerly ice-free shipping port in North America is accessible to store and ship 
concentrates.Such material is currently being shipped from the Wolverine and Huckleberry 
mines via this terminal.  
 
A proposal to have a high voltage power line run parallel with existing lines along Highway 37 is 
currently under review (www.highway37.com). 
 
The initial plan calls for the new 287-kV line that would extend from the community of Terrace 
to the beginning of the Galore Creek access road at Bob Quinn Lake providing access for the 
project to the BC Hydro electric grid (Figure 4.2).The final capacity of this transmission line has 
yet to be determined and may be increased due to project demand.

5.0 HISTORY AND PREVIOUS EXPLORATION 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project and the surrounding region have a history rich in exploration 
for precious and base metals dating back to the late 1800s.This sectiondescribes the mineral 
exploration, including the historical drilling carried out prior to Pretivm's acquisition of the 
separate Brucejack and Snowfield properties, within the Brucejack portion of the Project itself 
and the surrounding region.The historical data have been summarized mostly from various 
Assessment Reports available through the BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum 
Resources. 
 
5.1 SNOWFIELD PROPERTY 
 
5.1.1 SUMMARY OF HISTORICAL EXPLORATION 
 
The exploration history of the Sulphurets-Mitchell Creek area dates back to 1933 when placer 
gold miners worked on Sulphurets Creek.In 1959, Granduc staked the original Sulphurets claim 
group (McCrea, 2007) starting the era of modern exploration as briefly outlined below: 
 

• 1960-1980 – Granduc carried out regional reconnaissance prospecting, mapping, 
and rock sampling over the entire Sulphurets area resulting in the discovery of 
several porphyry copper-molybdenum and copper-gold occurrences. 

• 1980 – Esso optioned the Sulphurets property and conducted detailed geological 
mapping, trenching, and rock geochemical sampling. The results of this work led 
to the discovery of the Snowfield, Quartz Stockwork, and Moly zones.  

• 1981-1983 – Esso continued exploring the Snowfield zone which appeared to 
have the potential for a large, low grade gold deposit.  

• 1983 – Esso excavated and sampled 24 trenches, totalling 192m, in the Snowfield 
zone outlining a 240 m by 120 m area of gold mineralization with an average 
grade of 0.088 oz/t gold (McCrea, 2007). Their work also discovered the 
Josephine zone with vein-hosted gold-silver mineralization.  

• 1985 – Esso terminated their option of the Sulphurets property. Newhawk and 
Granduc entered into a 60:40 joint venture agreement with Newhawk operating.  

• 1985-1988 – Newhawk tested the Snowfield zone with five diamond drill holes 
totalling 740 m. At the time, the mineralization was interpreted to be a tabular, 
shallow, southwardly dipping body averaging 70 m thick.  

• Preliminary metallurgical testing was carried out on the drill core and prospecting 
continued on the property until 1989.  

• 1989 – Newhawk-International joint venture established a property-wide control 
grid (8 line-km) and conducted a rock sampling program including further rock 
sampling and trenching on the Snowfield zone.  

• 1991 – Two drill holes, totalling 350 m, tested the Snowfield zone with additional 
rock sampling along its eastern exposed limits. The Newhawk-International joint 
venture also funded a doctoral thesis on the property by Jake Margolis, which was 
published in 1993.  



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 13 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

• 1993 – Three deep diamond drill holes, totalling 1,164 m, tested the southern 
extension of the Snowfield zone and another three drill holes, totalling 295 m, 
tested the nearby Josephine Vein zone.  

• 1999 –Silver Standard acquired the Sulphurets claim through the acquisition of all 
of the shares of Newhawk, including the subject claims.  

• 2006 – Silver Standard evaluated the Snowfield zone with 27 diamond drill holes, 
totalling 6,141 m, and rock sampling to test the lateral and vertical limits of the 
gold mineralization. An initial resource estimate was prepared. 

• 2007 – Silver Standard drilled 29 NQ-2 size diamond drill holes, totalling 
8,667 m. There were 21 drill holes tested at the Snowfield zone, 6 drill holes 
tested at the nearby Coffeepot zone situated immediately west of the Snowfield 
zone, and 1 drill hole tested at the Mitchell East zone (now recognized to be the 
northern extension of the Snowfield zone). A total of 5,484 samples were 
collected from the 2007 drill core.  

• 2008 - Silver Standard drilled 6,945 m in 31 holes. A resource estimate was 
prepared by Minorex Consulting Ltd. (see Table 16.16). 

• 2009/2010 – Silver Standard drilled 23,778 m in 42 drill holes, increased the drill 
density to 100 m centres in the main body of the Inferred resources outlined in 
2008, and extended the known mineralization to the northwest and southeast. A 
higher grade gold-copper core with silver and molybdenum credits was defined, 
and continuity of grade in the northern half of the zone was proven. Two resource 
estimates were prepared in 2009 and one in 2010 by P&E and are presented in 
Table 16.2,Table 16.32 and Table 16.4. 

 
5.2 PREVIOUS FEASIBILITY STUDIES AT SNOWFIELD 
 
There have been no previous feasibility studies undertaken on the Snowfield Property. 
 
5.3 BRUCEJACK PROPERTY 
 
5.3.1 SUMMARY OF HISTORICAL EXPLORATION 
 
In 1935, prospectors discovered Cu-Mo mineralization on the Sulphurets Property in the vicinity 
of the Main Copper zone, approximately six km north-west of Brucejack Lake; however, these 
claims were not staked until 1960. 
 
From 1935 to 1959, the area was relatively inactive with respect to prospecting; however, it was 
intermittently evaluated by a number of different parties and several small Cu and Au-Ag 
occurrences were made in the Sulphurets-Mitchell Creek area. 
 
In 1960, Granduc and Alaskan prospectors staked the main claim group covering the known Cu 
and Au-Ag occurrences, which collectively became known as the Sulphurets Property, starting 
the era of modern exploration, outlined as follows: 
 

• 1960-1979 – Granduc continued exploration, conducting further geological 
mapping, lithogeochemical sampling, trenching, and diamond drilling on known 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 14 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

base and precious metal targets north and north-west of Brucejack Lake resulting 
in the discovery of Au-Ag mineralization in the Hanging Glacier area and Mo on 
the south side of Mitchell. 

• 1980 – Esso optioned the property from Granduc and subsequently completed an 
extensive program consisting of mapping, trenching, and geochemical sampling 
that resulted in the discovery of several showings including the Snowfield, Shore, 
West, and Galena zones.Au was discovered on the peninsula at Brucejack Lake 
near the Shore Zone. 

• 1982-1983 – Exploration was confined to Au and Ag-bearing vein systems in the 
Brucejack Lake area at the southern end of the property from 1982 to 
1983.Drilling was concentrated in 12 Ag and Au-bearing structures including the 
Near Shore and West zones, located 800 m apart near Brucejack Lake.Drilling 
commenced on the Shore Zone. 

• 1983 – Esso continued work on the property and (in 1984) outlined a deposit on 
the west Brucejack Zone. 

• 1985 – Esso dropped the option on the Sulphurets property. 
• 1985 – The property was optioned by Newhawk and Lacana Mining Corp. 

(Lacana) from Granduc under a three-way joint venture (the Newcana JV).The 
Newcana JV completed work on the Snowfield, Mitchell, Golden Marmot, 
Sulphurets Gold, and Main Copper zones, along with lesser known targets.  

• 1986-1991 – Between 1986 and 1991, the Newcana JV spent approximately 
$21 M developing the West Zone and other smaller precious metal veins on what 
would later become the Bruceside Property. 

• 1991-1992 – Newhawk officially subdivided the Suphurets claim group into the 
Sulphside and Bruceside properties and optioned the Sulphside property 
(including Sulphurets and Mitchell Zones) to Placer Dome Inc. (Placer 
Dome).Throughout the period from 1991 to 1994, joint venture exploration 
continued on the Sulphurets-Bruceside property including property-wide 
trenching, mapping, airborne surveys, and surface drilling, evaluating various 
surface targets including the Shore, Gossan Hill, Galena Hill, Maddux, and SG 
zones.Newhawk purchased Granduc's interest in the Snowfield Property in early 
1992. 

• 1991 – Six holes were drilled at the Shore Zone, totalling 1,200 m, to test its 
continuity and to determine its relationship to the West and R-8 zones.Results 
varied from 37 g/t Au over 1.5 m to 13 g/t Au over 4.9 m (www.infomine.com). 

• 1994 – Exploration in the Brucejack area consisted of detailed mapping and 
sampling in the vicinity of the Gossan Hill Zone, and 7,352 m of diamond drilling 
(over 20 holes), primarily on the West, R8, Shore, and Gossan Hill 
zones.Mapping, trenching, and drilling of the highest priority targets were 
conducted on 10 of the best deposits (including the West Zone). 

• 1996 – Granduc merged with Black Hawk to form Black Hawk Mining Inc. 
• 1997-1998 – No exploration or development work was carried out on the 

Brucejack property (Budinski et al., 2001). 
• 1999 – Silver Standard acquired Newhawk and with it, Newhawk's 60% interest 

and control of the Brucejack Property (www.infomine.com). 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 15 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

• 2001 – Silver Standard entered into an agreement with Black Hawk whereby 
Silver Standard acquired Black Hawk's 40% direct interest in the Brucejack 
property, resulting in 100% interest in the property. 

• 1999-2008 – No exploration or development work was carried out on the 
Brucejack Property during the period from 1999 to 2008. 

 
The historical interpretation (Pincock, Allen and Holt 2001) of mineralized zones on the West 
Zone, prior to Silver Standard undertaking their exploration work in 2008, is shown in Figure 
5.1(underground vein location plan map) and Figure 5.2(cross section map).

5.4 RECENT WORK COMPLETED AT BRUCEJACK 
 
In 2009 Silver Standard began work on the Brucejack Property, the first since its acquisition.The 
2009 program included drilling, rock-chip and channel sampling, and re-sampling of historical 
drill core. 
 
During the 2009 Brucejack Property field program, Silver Standard collected a total of 
1,940 drill core samples from 25 historical drill holes stored onsite and sent them for analysis to 
ALS Chemex Laboratories Ltd. ("ALS Chemex", or "Chemex").The samples were sent to the 
ALS Chemex assay laboratory in Terrace for preparation and then forwarded to the Chemex 
facility in Vancouver for analysis.Samples were analyzed for gold (fire assay with atomic 
absorption finish) as well as 33 other elements by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis.The 
2009 program also included re-analysis of 941 pulp samples derived from historical drill core 
samples.These samples were also analyzed for gold, plus 33 other elements at the Chemex 
facility in Vancouver. 
 
Field work undertaken throughout the 2009 program included the collection of 2,739 rock-chip 
and channel samples from surface outcrops.This sampling work was mostly done at target areas 
that were drilled by the company in 2009, with samples generally collected along north-south 
oriented lines that corresponded to the surface traces of some of the 2009 drill holes.Specifically, 
rock-chip and channel sampling were completed at the Galena Hill, Bridge, SG, and Mammoth 
zones (where drilling was carried out in 2009), as well as at the Hanging Glacier Zone, where 
historical surface sampling had identified rocks enriched in gold and silver.The surface samples 
were analyzed for gold plus 33 other elements. 
 
5.5 PREVIOUS FEASIBILITY STUDIES AT BRUCEJACK 
 
Corona completed a feasibility study on a proposed underground mine with decline access for 
the Sulphurets Project (West and R-8 Zones only) in 1990. Total operating costs of $145 per ton 
were estimated based on a 350 ton-per-day mill facility for processing, a capital cost of 
$42.7 million and a 6.7% pre-tax return at a price of US $400/oz gold and $5/oz silver. The study 
concluded that higher metal prices must be realized before a production decision could be taken.  
 
The reader is cautioned that the abovementioned 1990 Corona Sulphurets Project Feasibility

6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The following descriptions of the regional and local geology of the Snowfield-Brucejack Project 
are drawn heavily from the Technical Report titled, "Technical Report on the Snowfield 
Property, Skeena Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada", by Minorex Consulting Ltd., 
dated April 21, 2008. 
 
Because the deposits associated with Snowfield and Brucejack differ from one another, the 
regional geology of the Snowfield-Brucejack Project is presented as one; however, the local 
geology, structure and alteration are treated separately for the Snowfield and Brucejack 
properties.  
 
The Sulphurets district is situated along the western margin of the Intermontane Tectonic Belt, 
underlain by Stikine Terrane.This district has been the subject of several geological studies since 
the mid-1980s when it was actively explored for porphyry copper-molybdenum and copper-gold 
(i.e. Kerr), exhalative volcanogenic (i.e. Eskay Creek), and lode gold-silver vein deposits (i.e. 
Snip).Researchers included scientists from the Geological Survey of Canada, the British 
Columbia Geological Survey, the University of British Columbia, and the University of 
Oregon.The following discussion of the regional geology is a brief summary of their 
findings.Figure 6.1 shows the geology of the Sulphurets area. 
 
6.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project and the surrounding Sulphurets district are underlain by the 
Upper Triassic and Lower to Middle Jurassic Hazelton Group of volcanic, volcaniclastic, and 
sedimentary rocks.According to Roach and MacDonald (1992), the stratigraphic assemblage 
comprises a package, from oldest to youngest, of: 
 

• Lower Unuk River Formation: alternating siltstone and conglomerate; 
• Upper Unuk River Formation: alternating intermediate volcanic rock and 

siltstone; 
• Betty Creek Formation: alternating conglomerate, sandstone, and intermediate to 

mafic volcanic rock; 
• Mount Dilworth Formation: felsic pyroclastic tuffaceous rock and flows; 
• Salmon River and Bowser Formations: alternating siltstone and sandstone. 

 
Britton and Alldrick (1988) described three intrusive episodes in the area including intermediate 
to felsic plutons that are probably coeval with volcanic and volcaniclastic supracrustal rocks, 
small stocks related to the Cretaceous Coast Plutonic Complex, and minor tertiary dykes and 
sills.

The Hazelton Group lithologies display fold styles ranging from gently warped to tight 
disharmonic folds.Northerly striking, steep normal faults are common and syn-volcanic, syn-
sedimentary, and syn-intrusive faults have been inferred in the region.Minor thrust faults, 
dipping westerly, are common in the region and are important in the northern and western parts 
of the Sulphurets area in regard to the interpretation of mineralized zones.Metamorphic grade 
throughout the area is, at least, lower greenschist. 
 
There are more than seventy documented mineral occurrences and showings in the Sulphurets 
area.Copper, molybdenum, gold, and silver mineralization found within gossans have affinities 
to both porphyry and mesothermal to epithermal types of vein deposits.Most mineral deposits 
occur in the upper members of the Unuk River Formation or the lower members of the Betty 
Creek Formation. 
 
Regional geologic mapping was completed by the Geological Survey of Canada, the British 
Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Resources, and the Mineral Deposits Research Unit 
(MDRU) at the University of British Columbia.A regional geology map is depicted in Figure 6.3. 
 
The regional stratigraphic assemblage as originally compiled by Kirkham (1963) and later 
modified by Britton and Alldrick (1988), Alldrick and Britton (1991), McCrea (2007) and 
Blanchflower (2008), is illustrated in Figure 6.2 and has been summarized in Table 6.1.

6.2 GEOLOGY, STRUCTURE, AND ALTERATION OF THE SNOWFIELD 
 PROPERTY 
 
The Snowfield deposit (see typical cross sectionsFigure 6.5 to Figure 6.8) is underlain by Lower 
Jurassic andesitic volcanic rocks that correlate with the 'Upper Andesite' unit of the Unuk River 
formation from the lower portion of the Hazelton Group (Alldrick and Britton, 1991).  
 
The rocks that host the gold mineralization at the Project have been subjected to a lower 
greenschist facies grade of metamorphism with subsequent pervasive hydrothermal alteration, 
making the identification of protoliths difficult.Based upon geological mapping, petrographic 
studies, and recent drilling results, the mineralized rocks are interpreted to be a marine volcanic 
back-arc sequence forming a moderate north-westerly-dipping sequence of predominantly 
andesitic autochthonous breccia flow, lithic, crystal, and lapilli tuff. 
 
Porphyritic quartz-syenite is exposed approximately three km west of the Snowfield Zone where 
it occurs in the upper plate of the Sulphurets thrust fault.A U-Pb age date of 192.7 + 5.4/-3.6 Ma 
was obtained for this felsic intrusive, which is believed to underlie the Snowfield Zone and 
surrounding area to the west and north at depth. 
 
Structure 
 
The Sulphurets Thrust Fault, situated approximately one km west of the Property, is a west-
dipping, northerly-striking structure that places Triassic Stuhini Group over the Lower Jurassic 
Hazelton Group rocks, part of the regional Late Mesozoic Skeena fold and thrust belt (Margolis, 
1993). 
 
The Mitchell Thrust Fault, located on the south side of the Mitchell Valley, separates 
potassically-altered quartz-syenite and other rocks above it from dominantly sericitically altered 
rocks and the Mitchell quartz stockwork beneath.This low-angle thrust fault appears to have been 
transferred to a higher-angle, oblique-slip movement along the Snowfield Fault, producing a 
horst within the Snowfield Zone.  
 
Two northerly-striking, post-mineralization high-angle faults occurring east and west of the 
Snowfield Zone are called the Brucejack and Snowfield Faults respectively (see previous Figure 
6.1).The left-lateral and eastside-down, vertical Snowfield Fault was apparently formed during 
southeast-directed thrusting which produced the Mitchell and Sulphurets thrusts (Margolis, 
1993).The Brucejack Fault is a more regional northerly-striking structure that transects the 
Sulphurets district, truncating geological features and influencing topography. 
 
Alteration 
 
The Snowfield Zone is situated within the eastern of two structural blocks separated by the 
northerly-trending Snowfield Fault.The eastern, down-dropped block of volcanic rocks has been 
pervasively altered to advanced argillic facies, has a quartz stockwork zone, and is rarely 
affected by potassic alteration east of the fault.In contrast, the western block which has been 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 27 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

uplifted has potassic, sericitic and rare advanced argillic alteration accompanying the quartz-
syenite intrusion. 
 
According to Margolis (1993), chlorite-rich quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration of the andesitic 
volcanic rocks is pervasive east of the Snowfield Fault and throughout the Snowfield Zone, in 
contrast to the chlorite-poor alteration west of the fault.The altered host rocks contain abundant 
disseminations and fracture filling molybdenite and tourmaline which are cut by pyrophyllite 
veins in the advanced argillic zone and by massive pyrite veins elsewhere in the area.There is 
evidence that the quartz-sericite-pyrite-chlorite alteration replaced potassic alteration which was 
rich in hydrothermal biotite, magnetite, and chalcopyrite (Margolis, 1993).Beyond the known 
limits of the Snowfield Zone, the quartz-sericite-pyrite-chlorite altered rocks are poorly 
mineralized, except for molybdenite.

6.3 GEOLOGY, STRUCTURE AND ALTERATION OF THE BRUCEJACK 
 PROPERTY 
 
The following description of the geology of the Brucejack Property was provided by Mr. Ron 
Burk, Chief Geologist of Silver Standard, in the form of an internal company report, dated 
December 9, 2009.  
 
Published descriptions of the regional geology of the Sulphurets Creek-Brucejack Lake area have 
been presented by the Geological Survey of Canada (Henderson et al., 1992; Kirkham, 1991; 
Anderson, 1989), geologists working for the British Columbia government (Britten and Alldrick, 
1988; Alldrick et al., 1987; Grove, 1986) and by the MDRU at the University of British 
Columbia (Lewis et al., 2001; Lewis, 2001).This body of work shows that the Brucejack 
property is underlain by Upper Triassic volcaniclastic and epiclastic sedimentary rocks of the 
Stuhini Group and Lower to Middle Jurassic volcanic, volcaniclastic, and sedimentary rocks of 
the Hazelton Group. 
 
Since the Brucejack Property occurs within the eastern limb of the McTagg anticlinorium, the 
stratigraphic sequences recognized on the Snowfield and Brucejack Properties overall become 
younger to the east (Figure 6.9).The oldest rocks, found at lower elevations immediately east of 
the Sulphurets glacier, consist of heterolithic volcaniclastic conglomerate that is conformably 
overlain by a sequence of interbedded mudstone, sandstone, and thin limestone units of the 
Stuhini Group.An angular unconformity marks the contact between the Stuhini Group 
sedimentary rocks and medium- to coarse-grained sandstones of the Jack Formation, which is 
roughly the basal formation of the Hazelton Group and is dated at about 196 Ma. 
 
Open folding and probable thrust faulting has also placed a wedge of Jack Formation sandstone 
and conglomerate at the western end of Brucejack Lake where these rocks are well exposed on a 
peninsula known as Windy Point.Using the revised Hazelton Group stratigraphy presented in 
MDRU's Special Publication Number 1 (Lewis et al., 2001), the Jack Formation sedimentary 
rocks are overlain by a 10 to 50 m-thick unit of mudstone/argillite and cherty argillite that 
belongs to the Unuk River Member of the Betty Creek Formation.This argillaceous unit is 
exposed along the southwest side of the West Zone deposit of shear-hosted, Au-Ag quartz veins 
and stockwork and has been traced southwards through the western part of the Galena Hill Au-
Ag prospect. 
 
Overlying the argillite unit is a greater than 500 m-thick package of hornblende and plagioclase-
phyric andesitic flows, flow breccia and intermediate tuffaceous rock intercalated with 
volcaniclastic conglomerate, sandstone and siltstone.These rocks form the bulk of the Unuk 
River Member in the Brucejack Property and outcrop extensively within a northwest-trending 
belt that passes beneath Brucejack Lake.

The andesite of the Unuk River Member is the most important host rock to Au- and Ag-bearing 
quartz veins discovered in the Brucejack area and has been affected by widespread hydrothermal 
alteration, mainly quartz-sericite-pyrite (e.g. Gossan Hill, Galena Hill).U-Pb geochronology and 
biochronology done by MDRU geoscientists have determined the age of the Unuk River 
Member volcanics to be in the range of 196 to 194 Ma. 
 
Still higher in the Hazelton Group stratigraphy is a thick sequence of mainly dacitic pyroclastic 
rocks (tuff-breccia, lapilli tuff, crystal-lithic tuff, minor ash tuff) and flows with thin argillite 
interbeds that are well exposed on the mountainside north of Brucejack Lake.Based on MDRU's 
studies and mapping, this predominantly felsic to intermediate volcanic package has been 
assigned to the Brucejack Lake Member of the Betty Creek Formation, (prior to MDRU's project 
in the Iskut River region, these rocks were mapped as belonging to the Betty Creek Formation). 
 
A possible vent area for the tuff and flows is a flow-dome complex identified just south of the 
east end of Brucejack Lake (Macdonald, 2001).Here, well developed subvertical flow-banding 
can be observed along with megacrystic flow-banded dacite, autobrecciated dacite and clast-
supported blocky breccia with a hematitic mudstone matrix.Two U-Pb age dates have been 
obtained from flow-banded dacite and these show the flow-dome was emplaced 185.7 
Ma.Several other U-Pb age dates obtained during the MDRU Iskut River Project for rocks 
assigned to the Brucejack Lake Member indicate that the episode of intermediate to felsic 
volcanism in the Hazelton Group spanned 8 to 10 million years. 
 
Supracrustal rock units younger than the Brucejack Lake Member have not been reported from 
the Brucejack Property, although they could exist at the top of Mount John Walker on the north 
side of Brucejack Lake.In the area of the Eskay Creek Au-Ag mine, the youngest member of the 
Betty Creek Formation is the Treaty Creek Member which is a mixed sequence of sedimentary 
strata including sandstone, conglomerate, turbiditic siltstone, and limestone.More importantly, 
the high-grade exhalative Au-Ag sulphide-sulphosalt deposits are associated with or hosted by 
units belonging to the Salmon River Formation which directly overlies the Treaty Creek 
Member.To date, rhyolite flows and carbonaceous mudstone that characterize the Salmon River 
Formation have not been identified in the Brucejack Property but should be explored for at the 
highest elevations of Mount John Walker. 
 
Apart from the high-level, synvolcanic intrusive dacite of the flow-dome complex mapped south-
east of Brucejack Lake, there are three types of intrusions recognized on the Brucejack 
Property.The most common intrusive rock in the area consists of plagioclase- and hornblende-
phyric to porphyritic rock of diorite to tonalite composition that forms two stocks found in the 
southern half of the claim group.Each intrusion has surface dimensions of roughly 700 m east-
west by 700-1,000 m north-south.A number of smaller bodies of the same rock are scattered 
around these two main intrusions.These intrusions have been referred to as "Sulphurets-type" 
intrusions and are considered to be broadly coeval with the andesite volcanics of the Unuk River 
Member in the Hazelton Group.  
 
A second type of intrusive rock forms an elongate body of about 700 m length, aligned north-
south, that was emplaced along the western margin of one of the Sulphurets stocks.This intrusion 
is best described as potassium feldspar-plagioclase-hornblende porphyry and earlier workers 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 35 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

have referred to it as a "two-feldspar" or "Premier-type" porphyry.Based on contact 
relationships, it would appear that this intrusion is younger than the Sulphurets-type 
intrusions.The youngest intrusive rocks observed consist of medium to dark green, fine-grained 
andesite to basaltic andesite dikes that are generally less than 2 m in thickness.These dikes tend 
to be north to northeast striking.  
 
In terms of structural geology, the lithologies found at the Brucejack property display evidence 
of both ductile and brittle deformation.The oldest rocks, belonging to the Stuhini Group, are well 
exposed along the steep ravine of Brucejack Creek and are strongly folded with axial traces 
trending just west of north. 
 
The overlying Jack Formation epiclastic units are less intensely folded, with an open syncline 
being the dominant fold to have affected these rocks.A second syncline defined by units of the 
Jack Formation lies further to the east, with its NNW-SSE axial trace passing through the West 
Zone Au-Ag deposit.  
 
The Unuk River and Brucejack Lake Member lithologiesof the Hazelton Group predominate in 
the eastern half of the Brucejack Property and form a homoclinal rock package that dips 
moderately to steeply in an east to northeast direction.Penetrative fabrics are commonly 
developed in most lithologies.Rocks that appear to have experienced hydrothermal alteration 
prior to folding are generally the most intensely foliated.Shearing also appears to have occurred 
along structures that developed at relatively low angles to stratigraphic layering, with one 
example being the 140°-trending shear zone that hosts the mineralized quartz veins and 
stockworks of the West Zone deposit.  
 
Post-dating the folds and the development of penetrative fabrics are numerous brittle-ductile 
faults with different strike orientations and variable displacements.These structures can be 
readily observed as lineaments in aerial photographs of the Property.One of the most prominent 
of these late structures is the northerly trending Brucejack Fault which bisects the two main 
Sulphurets-type intrusions and continues for kilometres to the north crossing the entire project 
area.Mapping of contact displacements suggests that right-lateral movement of about 150 m has 
occurred along this major structure; an unknown but probably minor amount of vertical 
displacement has likely also occurred.Other well-defined lineaments/faults tend to strike 
northwest or, as seen on the southern slope of Mount John Walker, have north-easterly 
alignments.

7.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
7.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
While deposits such as Snowfield, Kerr, and Mitchell are probably best described as gold-
enriched copper porphyry systems, most (if not all) of the mineralization on the Brucejack 
Property has been classified as an epithermal Au-Ag-Cu, low-sulphidation deposit (UBC deposit 
model No. H04).It is possible that some of the mineralization also displays characteristics of 
intrusion related vein systems that fall within the Intermediate-Sulphidation epithermal subtype 
of Hedenquist et al. (2000). 
 
The following deposit description is taken from the "Geology of Canadian Mineral Deposit 
Types", edited by O.R. Eckstrand, W.D. Sinclair, and R.I. Thorpe. 
 
7.2 PORPHYRY DEPOSITS - SNOWFIELD 
 
The Snowfield deposit is a near-surface, low grade, bulk tonnage, and porphyry-style gold 
deposit that has the additional potential of copper-gold + molybdenum mineralization at depth 
and west of the Snowfield Fault.The gold mineralization at the Snowfield deposit, as well as the 
copper-gold + molybdenum porphyry-style mineralization of the Mitchell deposit that is 
currently being tested by Seabridge on the adjacent Kerr-Sulphurets property to the north and 
west, is interpreted to be genetically related to one or more Jurassic-age alkaline intrusions 
(Alldrick and Britton 1991; Margolis 1993). 
 
Geological Features 
 
The following features serve to distinguish porphyry deposits from other types of deposits: 
 

• Large size; 
• Widespread alteration; 
• Structurally controlled ore minerals superimposed on pre-existing host rocks; 
• Distinctive metal associations; 
• Spatial, temporal, and genetic relationships to porphyritic epizonal and mesozonal 

intrusions. 
 
Genetic Model 
 
The most applicable model for porphyry deposits is a magmatic hydrothermal one, or variations 
thereon, in which the ore metals were derived from temporally and genetically related intrusions 
(Figure 7.1).Large polyphase hydrothermal systems developed within and above genetically 
related intrusions and commonly interacted with meteoric fluids (and possibly seawater) on their 
tops and peripheries.During the waning stages of hydrothermal activity, the magmatic-
hydrothermal systems collapsed inward upon themselves and were replaced by waters of 
dominantly meteoric origin.Redistribution, and possibly further concentration of metals, 
occurred in some deposits during these waning stages. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 37 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

Variations of the magmatic-hydrothermal model for porphyry deposits, commonly referred to as 
the orthomagmatic model, have been presented by numerous authors such as Burnham (1967, 
1979), Phillips (1973), and Whitney (1975, 1984).These authors envisaged felsic and 
intermediate magma emplacement at high levels in the crust and border zone crystallization 
along the walls and roof of the magma chamber.As a consequence of this crystallization, 
supersaturation of volatile phases occurred within the magma, resulting in separation of volatiles 
due to resurgent or second boiling (Figure 7.2).Ore metals and many other components were 
strongly partitioned into these volatile phases, which became concentrated in the carapace of the 
magma chamber.When increasing fluid pressures exceeded lithostatic pressures and the tensile 
strength of the overlying rocks, fracturing of these rocks occurred, permitting rapid escape of 
hydrothermal fluids into newly created open space.A fundamental control on ore deposition 
wasthe pronounced adiabatic cooling of the ore fluids due to their sudden expansion into the 
fracture and/or breccia systems, thus the importance of structural control on ore deposition in 
porphyry deposits. 
 
Some modification of the orthomagmatic model is likely required for at least some, if not most, 
porphyry deposits, in view of studies by Shannon et al. (1982), Carten et al. (1988a), and 
Kirkham and Sinclair (1988).These authors concluded that, in several deposits, the underlying 
genetically related intrusions were largely liquid in their carapaces until ore formation was 
essentially complete.According to this model, volatiles that streamed through large volumes of 
magma, stripping it of its metal content, accumulated in small cupolas at the top of the magma 
chambers.Wall rocks of the intrusions and deposits are not considered to be viable sources for 
the metals in porphyry deposits.

Note: (modified from Shinohara et al., 1995). Fluid separation from the degassing magma occurs near the top of the 
magma column, forming pockets of magmatic-hydrothermal fluid in which comb-quartz layers grow inward from 
intrusion margins. Mineralized vein and fracture stockworks form when the fluid pressure exceeds lithostatic 
pressure and tensile strength of the surrounding rocks.

7.3 EPITHERMAL AU-AG-CU, LOW-SULPHIDATION DEPOSITS - BRUCEJACK 
 
A detailed description of epithermal mineralizing systems is provided by Taylor (2007) as his 
contribution to the most recent edition of the "Mineral Deposits of Canada", Special 
Volume 5 published jointly by the Geological Association of Canada-Mineral Deposits Division 
and the Geological Survey of Canada.Much of the following material in this report section 
provides a brief overview of the subject that is synthesized from that publication. 
 
Lindgren (1933) divided hydrothermal ore deposits, including those of gold and silver, into 
thermal types such as epithermal, mesothermal, and hypothermal.Lindgren fully recognized that 
his scheme also applied in a qualitative way to the depths in the Earth's crust at which various 
types of deposits form and it is this aspect of his classification scheme that has persisted to the 
present day.Thus, epithermal gold deposits are those for which there is evidence of a shallow 
crustal origin (less than 1 or 2km), mesothermal deposits are those inferred to have formed at 
1 to 3 km, and hypothermal deposits at 3 km to more than 5 km.The depth ranges implied for 
each of the three types are not firmly fixed but are guidelines that reflect variations in lithostatic 
pressure, fluid pressure, crustal temperature and metamorphic facies transitions, availability of 
meteoric fluids, and the vertical extent of brittle and ductile fields of deformation and seismicity 
(Poulsen, 1995). 
 
Deep epithermal (or shallow mesothermal) veins ("transitional" deposits of Panteleyev, 1986) 
provide an example of the extended depth of formation currently included in the broad sense of 
epithermal.These transitional deposits are often referred to as intrusion-related vein deposits and 
occur in the Sulphurets, Mt. Washington, and Zeballos camps, all in British Columbia (Anon., 
1992 BC MINFILE; Margolis, 1993). 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project and surrounding properties in the Kerr-Sulphurets region host 
extensive mineralization and associated alteration systems that were undoubtedly developed as a 
result of hydrothermal activity focused on hypabyssal, Early Jurassic intermediate, porphyritic 
intrusions.  
 
Among the Brucejack gold and silver deposits, the West Zone has received the most exploration 
work to-date and accordingly can be considered somewhat typical of the general style of 
mineralization displayed by the various mineralizing systems comprising the Brucejack 
Property.Budinski et al. (2001) characterize the mineralization in the West Zone as a structurally 
controlled, complex vein/breccia system related to the Brucejack Fault lying to the immediate 
west.Like the other Brucejack Property deposits it is considered to fit the epithermal high-grade, 
intermediate to low-sulphidation, Au-Ag model.Other examples in British Columbia include the 
Blackdome and Silbak-Premier Mines.

7.4 EPITHERMAL GENETIC MODEL 
 
7.4.1 Introduction 
 
Simplified Definition  
 
Epithermal deposits of Au (±Ag) are a type of lode gold deposit that comprises veins and 
disseminations near the Earth's surface (≤1.5 km), in volcanic and volcaniclastic sedimentary 
rocks, sediment, and, in some cases, also in metamorphic rocks.The deposits may be found in 
association with hot springs and frequently occur at centres of young volcanism.The ores are 
dominated primarily by precious metals (Au, Ag) but some deposits may also contain variable 
amounts of base metals such as Cu, Pb, and Zn. 
 
Epithermal Sub-systems 
 
Epithermal Au deposits are distinguished on the basis of the sulphidation state of the sulphide 
mineralogy as belonging to one of three sub-types (Hedenquist et al., 2000): 
 

• High sulphidation: previously called quartz-(kaolinite)-alunite, alunite-kaolinite, 
enargite-Au, or high-sulphur deposits (Ashley, 1982; Hedenquist, 1987; Bonham, 
1988), these highly acidic deposits usually occur close to magmatic sources of 
heat and volatiles and form from acidic hydrothermal fluids containing magmatic 
S, C, and Cl. 

• Intermediate sulphidation: some deposits with mostly low-sulphidation 
characteristics have sulphide ore mineral assemblages that represent a 
sulphidation state between that of high-sulphidation and low-sulphidation 
deposits.Such deposits tend to be more closely spatially associated with intrusions 
and Hedenquist et al. (2000) suggest the term "intermediate sulphidation" for 
these deposits. 

• Low sulphidation: previously called adularia-sericite, these low-sulphidation 
subtype deposits are thought to have a near-neutral pH as a result of being 
dominated by meteoric waters but containing some magmatic C and S. 

 
7.4.2 Epithermal Mineralization Characteristics 
 
Lindgren (1922, 1933) suggested that degassing magmas are sources of many ore-forming 
constituents in epithermal Au deposits, and this supposition appears to be essentially correct for 
magmatic-hydrothermal high-sulphidation deposits (Stoffregen, 1987; Rye et al., 
1992).However, for many deposits (e.g. the majority of low-sulphidation subtypes), O and H 
isotope data permit only a very small fraction (i.e. <10%) of the hydrothermal water to be of 
magmatic origin, despite the close association of some deposits with cooling magmatic rocks; 
whereas, C and S isotope studies indicate a significant magmatic contribution in many 
cases.Thus, a mineralizing fluid can have a complex origin, involving links to degassing magmas 
as well as the dominance of local recharge waters to fuel the hydrothermal system.

The two principal (end-member) geochemical environments of epithermal mineralization and 
alteration are determined largely by the dominance in each case of two different fluids.On the 
one hand, magmatic-hydrothermal environments that are dominated (buffered) by acidic, 
magmatic fluids produce high-sulphidation mineral assemblages characterized by base leaching 
of wall rocks leaving marked (residual) silica enrichment.This environment may overlie 
porphyry systems (Sillitoe and Bonham, 1984).On the other hand, near neutral, more reduced, 
meteoric-dominated waters containing Cl, H2S, and CO2, yield low-sulphidation 
(adularia/sericite) mineral assemblages through hydrolysis reactions involving feldspar in the 
wall rocks.The chemical state of these fluids becomes largely wall-rock buffered.  
 
Sources of Gold 
 
Two fundamentally different hypotheses regarding the source of Au in epithermal deposits are as 
follows: 
 

• The metals are supplied directly by actively or passively degassing magma 
(e.g. Taylor, 1987 and 1988) that also provide heat to the paleo-hydrothermal 
system; 

• The metals are leached from the rocks that host the geothermal system. 
 
On the one hand, isotopic confirmation of the importance of meteoric waters has encouraged 
proponents of the second hypothesis.On the other hand, isotopic data also indicate that S and 
C are of magmatic origin in certain deposits.Alteration mineral assemblages are characteristic of 
two end-member chemical environments of alteration and mineralization: 
 

• Low to very low pH, oxidized fluids (high-sulphidation subtype); 
• Near neutral, more reduced fluids (low and intermediate-sulphidation subtypes). 

 
Boiling and chemical fractionation of the hydrothermal fluid provides an explanation for the 
separation of precious and base metals.This separation results in a vertical zoning where fluids 
are upwardly flowing (Clark and Williams-Jones, 1990), or in relative temporal stages such as at 
Silbak-Premier, B.C., and EI Indio, Chile.  
 
Geological, mineralogical, and geochemical features of epithermal Au deposits are listed for 
each of three deposit subtypes in Table 7.1.

7.4.3 Diagnostic Characteristics of Epithermal Subtypes 
 
Grade and Tonnage Characteristics  
 
The size and grade of the principal Canadian epithermal Au vein deposits and selected 'type' 
deposits elsewhere in the world are shown in Table 7.1.  The estimated sizes give an order of 
magnitude basis for comparison; definition of size depends on cut-off grades and economics. 
 
Canadian epithermal Au deposits are comparable in size and grade to many global deposits 
(Taylor, 2007) although the largest epithermal deposits (in tonnes of ore) and the richest deposits 
(in g/t) are found outside of Canada.  
 
In the Sulphurets district in British Columbia, epithermal mineralization tends to comprise 
disseminated Au in silicified and/or finely veined rocks.Grades are typically lower, but tonnages 
larger, than in other more typical vein-type epithermal deposits.

Physical Characteristics 
 
The mineralogy, textural features, host rocks, morphology, and selected chemical properties 
found typically in epithermal Au deposits are summarized in this section and shown in Table 7.1 
(Taylor, 2007). 
 
Mineralogy 
 
Quartz is the predominant gangue mineral in all epithermal Au deposits, whereas distinctive ore 
and gangue minerals characterize high-sulphidation and low- sulphidation deposit 
subtypes.Mineralogical zoning around veins or replacement zones may be present in both 
subtypes, recording chemical and/or thermal gradients.  
 
Low-Sulphidation 
 
Native Au and electrum occur in low-sulphidation subtype vein deposits that often contain only a 
few percent or less of sulphides (usually pyrite; e.g. Blackdome, B.C.).In deposits in which 
sulphide minerals are abundant (e.g. Venus; Silbak-Premier: sulphide-rich stage), sulphides 
commonly include chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, galena, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite in addition to 
pyrite.The principal gangue minerals include calcite, chlorite, adularia, barite, rhodochrosite, 
fluorite, and sericite.  
 
In sediment-hosted low-sulphidation deposits, the characteristic assemblage of gangue minerals 
commonly includes cinnabar, orpiment-realgar, and stibnite, in addition to jasperoid, quartz, 
dolomite, and calcite.Chalcedonic quartz veins and jasperoid are typically associated with ore, 
whereas calcite veins are often more common further from ore, or are paragenetically late. 
 
High Sulphidation 
 
In high-sulphidation subtype deposits, native Au and electrum are typically associated with 
pyrite, enargite, covellite, bornite and chalcocite.In addition to sulphosalts and base metal 
sulphides, tellurides and bismuthinite are present in some deposits.Total sulphide contents are 
generally higher in high-sulphidation than low-sulphidation subtype deposits but high sulphide 
contents may also characterize transitional polymetallic low-sulphidation deposits (e.g. Silbak 
Premier, B.C.).Where base metals are present in high-sulphidation deposits, the Cu abundance 
can vary significantly (Sillitoe, 1993) and typically dominate that of Zn.Principal gangue 
minerals include quartz ("vuggy silica"), alunite, barite (especially associated with Au).Calcite is 
not characteristic of high-sulphidation subtype deposits due to the high acidity of the 
hydrothermal fluids.

System Dimensions 
 
High-sulphidation deposits of magmatic hydrothermal origin are typically of smaller dimension 
than low-sulphidation subtype deposits, and are found in close proximity to and often 
topographically above, a related source of magmatic heat and volatiles. 
 
Low-sulphidation subtype deposits in most cases cover larger areas than typical high-
sulphidation deposits, even though alteration mineral assemblages are restricted to generally 
narrow zones enclosing veins and breccias.At the Blackdome Mine, B.C., quartz veins are 
contained within an area approximately 2 km by 5 km.Veins and breccia zones as wide as 40 m 
and as long as 1,200 m comprise the Main Zone of the Silbak-Premier deposit (Figure 7.4) 
(McDonald, 1990). 
 
Figure 7.4is a cross-section through a portion of the Silbak-Premier deposit (intermediate 
sulphidation; after McDonald, 1990), which illustrates hydrothermal propylitic, sericitic, and 
potassic alteration mineral assemblages in relation to fault-controlled vein stockwork and 
breccia, and to porphyritic dacite.

Illustrating Alteration Mineral Zoning and Selected Features 
 

 
 
Morphology 
 
The morphology of epithermal vein-style deposits can be quite variable.Deposits may consist of 
roughly tabular lodes controlled by the geometry of the principal faults they occupy (e.g. Cirque 
vein, Mt. Skukum), or comprise a host of interrelated fracture fillings in stockwork, breccia, 
lesser fractures, or, when formed by replacement of rock or void space, they may take on the 

 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 48 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

morphology of the lithologic unit or body of porous rock (e.g. irregular breccia pipes and lenses) 
replaced. 
 
Brecciation of previously emplaced veins (e.g. Mt. Skukum, Yukon) can form permeable zones 
along irregularities in fault planes: vertically plunging ore zones in faults with strike-slip motion 
and horizontal ore zones in dip-slip faults.Topographic (i.e. paleosurface) control of boiling by 
hydrostatic pressure can also result in horizontal or sub-horizontal mineralized zones, limiting 
the vertical distribution of ore.  
 
Host Rocks 
 
Nearly any rock type, even metamorphic rocks, may host epithermal Au deposits, although 
volcanic, volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks tend to be more common.Typically, epithermal 
deposits are younger than their enclosing rocks, except in the cases where deposits form in active 
volcanic settings and hot springs.Here, the host rocks and epithermal deposits can be essentially 
synchronous with spatially associated intrusive or extrusive rocks, within the uncertainty of the 
determined ages in some cases. 
 
Chemical Characteristics 
 
Ore Chemistry 
 
Gold:silver ratios of epithermal Au deposits may vary widely both between and within deposits 
ranging from lows of around 0.5 for the high-sulphidation type deposit as typified by the Kasuga 
deposit in Japan (Hedenquist et al., 1994) to >500 in the Cerro Rico de Potosi deposit in Peru 
(Erickson and Cunningham, 1993).Differing magmatic metal budgets (Sillitoe, 1993) and depths 
of formation (Hayba et al., 1985) have been suggested to influence this ratio.  
 
Typically, Ag:Au ratios for epithermal deposits, though variable, tend to be higher in low-
sulphidation subtype deposits than in high-sulphidation subtype deposits.The deep epithermal 
(mesothermal) Equity Silver deposit in B.C. (e.g. Cyr et al., 1984; Wojdak and Sinclair, 1984) 
has the highest Ag:Au ratio (approximately 128) among Canadian epithermal deposits.  
 
Alteration Mineralogy and Chemistry 
 
Hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages are commonly regularly zoned about vein or 
breccia-filled fluid conduits in both high and low-sulphidation deposit subtypes.Characteristic 
alteration mineral assemblages in both deposit subtypes can give way to propylitically altered 
rocks containing quartz + chlorite + albite + carbonate - sericite, epidote, and pyrite.The 
distribution and formation of the earlier formed propylitic mineral assemblages generally bears 
no obvious direct relationship to ore-related alteration mineral assemblages.

Altered rocks in low-sulphidation deposits generally comprise two mineralogical zones:  
 

• An inner zone of silicification (replacement of wall rocks by quartz or 
chalcedonic silica);  

• An outer zone of potassic-sericitic (phyllic) alteration [adularia is the typical K-
feldspar but its prominence varies greatly and it may be absent altogether; argillic 
alteration (kaolinite and smectite) occurs still farther from the vein]. 

 
Silicified rocks are common in epithermal deposits, as is quartz gangue in veins.The silicified 
and decarbonatized host rocks that characterize Carlin type Au deposits in Nevada (e.g. Bagby 
and Berger, 1986) was apparently controlled by available primary permeability of bedding 
planes or rock fabric.Secondary permeability can also be produced by physical and chemical 
processes involving the hydrothermal fluids themselves.The sudden release of pressure on 
hydrothermal fluid (e.g. by faulting) can cause brecciation, creating pore space 
permeability.Dissolution of carbonate upon reaction between hydrothermal fluids and wall rocks 
also can produce secondary permeability.  
 
Advanced argillic alteration mineral assemblages that characterize high-sulphidation deposits 
include quartz + kaolinite + alunite + dickite + pyrite in and adjacent to veins or zones of 
replacement in the magmatic-hydrothermal environment.Pyrophyllite occurs in place of kaolinite 
at the higher temperatures and pressures of deeper deposits.These alteration minerals indicate a 
very low pH hydrothermal environment of high oxidation state.Zones of silica replacement and 
'vuggy silica' are characteristic, and carbonates are absent.Topaz and tourmaline in high-
temperature zones indicate the presence of F and B in the acidic hydrothermal fluids.  
 
Acid-sulphate (high-sulphidation) type alteration fluids form by the dissolution of large amounts 
of magmatic SO2 in high-temperature hydrothermal systems, and also by reaction of host rocks 
with steam-heated meteoric waters acidified by oxidation of H2S (probably of magmatic origin: 
e.g. Rye et al., 1992; Bethke et al., 2005), or by dissolution of CO2.Lower acidity, highly saline 
fluids are thought responsible for intermediate sulphidation deposits typically rich in base metal 
and Fe sulphide minerals (Hedenquist et al., 2000).  
 
Fluids attributed to low-sulphidation hydrothermal systems are typically less saline than those in 
high-sulphidation systems, although fluids of two different salinities are also common.The 
primary fluids in low-sulphidation subtype deposits are commonly inferred to have largely 
evolved from meteoric rather than magmatic water, or comprise some mixture of the two (e.g. 
Hishikari, Japan: Faure et al., 2002).  
 
The hydrothermal fluids responsible for alteration and mineralization largely represent altered or 
'evolved' meteoric waters whose isotopic compositions have been shifted to higher 18O/16O and 
D/H (deuterium-to-hydrogen) ratios than those of pure local meteoric waters (compare with 
present day meteoric water).Such isotopic alteration or evolution of the fluids occurs during 
chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical hydrothermal alteration of the host rocks. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 50 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

Margolis (1993) inferred progressive mixing of magmatic water and seawater during potassic, 
sericitic, and advanced argillic alteration at Sulphurets, B.C., on the basis of isotopic data and 
water-rock reaction modeling.  
 
Fluid inclusions typically have been shown to contain predominantly fluids of low salinity and 
have filling temperatures of 150°C to 300°C, with maxima in the range of approximately 260°C 
to 280°C.Vapour-dominated systems at or near a boiling water table tend to evolve toward a 
rather uniform temperature of about 240°C due to the limitation imposed by a maximum in the 
enthalpy of steam + liquid (e.g. White et al., 1971). 
 
Some deep epithermal (transitional) environments close to genetically related intrusions are 
characterized by higher temperatures, salinities, and CO2 contents (e.g. Baker, 2002). 
 
7.5 SUMMARY – EPITHERMAL MINERALIZING SYSTEMS 
 
The geological settings of low, intermediate and high-sulphidation subtype epithermal deposits 
are illustrated schematically in Figure 7.5. 
 
The locations of epithermal Au deposits are typically determined by those features that define the 
hydrothermal system "plumbing".Extensional faults are especially important, whether due to 
local, volcanic-related features or to regional tectonism (e.g. rifting zones, or pull-apart basins 
associated with strike-slip faults).Fault intersections and fault plane inflections provide zones for 
vein thickening and zones of brecciation during synchronous movement and vein growth. 
 
7.5.1 High-Sulphidation Epithermal Deposit Characteristics 
 
High-sulphidation deposits are typically associated with andesitic to rhyolitic rocks and with 
geologic features associated with sites of active volcanic venting and doming, including among 
others ring fractures, caldera fill breccias, hot springs, and acidic crater lakes.It is the dominance 
of directly derived or evolved magmatic fluids that buffer the hydrothermal fluids to low pH and 
result in the distinct character of the high-sulphidation subtype.Orebodies primarily consist of 
zones of silica-rich replacement.Bodies of massive 'vuggy silica' and marked advanced argillic 
alteration mineral assemblages are typical.  
 
7.5.2 Low-Sulphidation Epithermal Deposit Characteristics 
 
Low-sulphidation deposits that occur further removed from active magmatic vents may be more 
apparently controlled by structural components, zones of fluid mixing, and emplacement of 
smaller magmatic bodies (e.g. dykes).Meteoric waters dominate the hydrothermal systems, 
which are more nearly pH neutral in character.Low-sulphidation related geothermal systems are 
more closely linked to passive rather than to active magmatic degassing (if at all), and sustained 
by the energy provided by cooling, sub-volcanic intrusions or deeper sub-volcanic magma 
chambers.

7.5.3 Transitional-Sulphidation Epithermal Deposit Characteristics 
 
Some deposits with mostly low-sulphidation characteristics with respect to their alteration 
mineral assemblages have sulphide ore mineral assemblages that represent a sulphidation state 
between that of high-sulphidation and low-sulphidation deposits.Such deposits tend to be more 
closely spatially associated with intrusions, and Hedenquist et al. (2000) suggest the term 
'intermediate sulphidation' for these deposits.  
 
The various Brucejack Property mineralized zones that are the subjects of the current report, are 
considered similar to the Silbak-Premier Mine which, as shown in Figure 7.5, is classified as a 
transitional to low sulphidation epithermal deposit.

8.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
There are more than 70 documented mineral occurrences and showings in the Sulphurets 
area.Copper, molybdenum, gold and silver mineralization found within gossans have affinities to 
both porphyry and mesothermal to epithermal types of vein deposits.Most mineral deposits occur 
in the upper members of Unuk River Formation or the lower members of the Betty Creek 
Formation (Britton and Alldrick, 1988). 
 
Early Jurassic sub-volcanic intrusive complexes are common in the Stikinia terrane, and several 
host well-known precious and base metal rich hydrothermal systems.These include copper-gold 
porphyry deposits such as Galore Creek, Red Chris, Kemess, Mt. Milligan, and KSM.In addition, 
there are a number of related polymetallic deposits including skarns at Premier, epithermal veins 
and subaqueous vein and replacement sulphide deposits at Eskay Creek, Snip, Brucejack, and 
Granduc (Savell, 2008). 
 
Within the Kerr-Sulphurets area, two basic styles of mineralization have been documented: 
 

• Porphyry-typegold mineralization associated with fine grained syenite to 
syenodiorite intrusive rocks, intrusive breccias and pyritization; 

• Silver-gold-base metal epithermal veins occurring within or adjacent to fine 
grained syenodiorite intrusions and associated with large areas of intense sericite, 
quartz, pyrite alteration; these structurally controlled veins may or may not have 
significant sulphide contents. 

 
8.2 SNOWFIELD PROPERTY MINERALIZATION 
 
The gold mineralization at the Snowfield deposit is hosted by schistose, pervasively altered 
(quartz-sericite-chlorite) volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that contain 1% to 5% disseminated 
pyrite, minor disseminations, veinlets of tourmaline, molybdenite, and abundant younger calcite 
veinlets. 
 
Gold mineralization occurs as microscopic grains (less than 30 µm) of electrum that are encased 
within fine-grained, pervasively disseminated pyrite in close association with trace amounts of 
galena and sphalerite (Margolis, 1993).Other associated minerals within the gold-mineralized 
zone include: tetrahedrite-tennantite, barite, acanthite, minor Mn-rich calcite, and rare 
chalcopyrite.Minute clusters, approximately 75 µm, of pyrite and rutile (+ barite) are also 
observed within the gold-bearing mineralization (Margolis, 1993). 
 
Molybdenite mineralization appears to have been emplaced during an earlier hydrothermal 
event.Pyrite-tetrahedrite veinlets from the gold-bearing mineral assemblage are observed cutting 
molybdenite veinlets.Weakly disseminated and minor fracture filling molybdenite mineralization 
is widespread and common throughout the Snowfield Deposit and nearby area.Fine-grained 
tourmaline crystals are often associated with molybdenite in quartz veinlets (Margolis, 1993). 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 55 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

Hydrothermal alteration within the Snowfield Deposit includes quartz-sericite-pyrite with 
varying amounts of chlorite, calcite, and garnet.The dark reddish-brown, rounded garnets are less 
than 7 mm and appear to have been crystallized during the gold mineralizing event(s).They are 
probably of hydrothermal origin as they are well fractured and exhibit deformational features 
consistent with the tectonic event that caused the deformation, alteration, and schistosity of the 
host rocks (Margolis, 1993). 
 
Chalcopyrite mineralization with minor sphalerite and galena increases at depth coincident with 
a change in lithology from the medium-grained andesitic tuff to fine-grained ash-crystal-lithic 
tuff (McCrea, 2007).Increasing base metal mineralization with depth may indicate possible 
porphyry-style copper mineralization associated with the cupola of a buried alkalic intrusion 
(Margolis, 1993). 
 
8.3 BRUCEJACK PROPERTY MINERALIZATION 
 
The Brucejack area has been the focus of periodic exploration over the past several decades 
resulting in the discovery of at least 40 gossanous zones of gold, silver, copper and 
molybdenum–bearing quartz/carbonate veining, stockwork and breccia hosted mineralization 
(Figure 8.1).Typically, these gossanous showings reflect the weathering of disseminated pyrite in 
argillic and phyllic alteration zones.The size of these gossans, their tectonic fabric, intensity of 
alteration and metallogenesis make them attractive exploration targets (Alldrick and Britton, 
1991) and most have been extensively sampled and/or drill tested.  
 
The mineralization on the Brucejack Property typically consists of structurally controlled, 
intrusive related quartz-carbonate, gold-silver bearing veins, stockwork and breccia zones.The 
veins are hosted within a broad zone of potassium feldspar alteration, overprinted by sericite-
quartz-pyrite ± clay.Structural style and alteration geochemistry indicate the deposits were 
formed in a near surface epithermal style environment.

Mineralization was likely a three-stage process as envisioned by Lewis (1994) in the summary 
below: 
 

• Stage 1 is interpreted as an initial episode of fault-development and ground 
preparation.Pre-cursor structures to the West, Shore, and Valley of Kings Zones 
likely formed at this time, as steep northwest trending normal faults with limited 
displacement, cutting all rock types.  

• Stage 2 involved development of syntectonic mineralization and 
alteration.Massive and stockwork vein systems were emplaced within an east-
west compressional stress field.The main vein orientations resulting from this 
stress are: 

 
• (i) East-west dilational veins; 
• (ii) North-west trending veins localized along pre-existing structures such 

as the West, Shore, Bridge and Valley of Kings Zones. 
 

• Underground mapping at the West Zone indicated that the north-west 
trending structures were brecciated, while east-west trending structures 
were not.This would support the theory of reactivation along pre-existing 
north-west structures.Reactivation was probably sinistral in 
movement.The localization of major vein systems within the volcanic rock 
as opposed to the sedimentary rock is likely the result of preferential 
ground preparation.  

 
• Stage 3 was marked by the development of north-west trending cleavage and local 

warping of smaller veins as a result of northeast-southwest shortening. 
 
Pretivm reviewed all of the historical and ongoing exploration results, allowing the company to 
identify nine zones of potentially near term economically viable mineralization specifically on 
the Brucejack Property.This is in addition to the Snowfield Zone of porphyry-type mineralization 
to the north. 
 
The following nine high–priority zones of mineralization presently comprise the Brucejack 
Property: 
 

• West Zone 
• West Zone Footwall Zone 
• Bridge Zone 
• Bridge Halo Zone 
• Galena Hill Zone 
• Shore Zone 
• SG Zone 
• Gossan Hill Zone 
• Valley ofKings Zone ("VOK")

Zones 1 through 9 are the focus of Mineral Resource Estimates outlined in Section 16.0 of this 
report and are discussed individually in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.9.  
 
Vein Mineralization 
 
The zones of gold-silver-copper-molybdenum mineralization comprising the Brucejack area are, 
for the most part, considered the product of fault and fracture-controlled hydrothermal activity 
related to local intrusive activity. 
 
In general, the vein mineralization appears to represent a complex system of structurally 
controlled overprinting of mineralization types and multiple generations of alteration and vein 
assemblages.Veins can be classified on the basis of metal content and gangue 
mineralogy.Typically the exposed veins are thin (1 m) and short (<50 m).Individual veins may 
coalesce into more densely packed vein systems, especially in more intensely altered areas, and 
locally often represent in excess of 25% of the outcrop.Such vein systems typically grade 
imperceptibly into the strongly silicified host rocks. 
 
Base-metal bearing quartz veins consist primarily of thin stringers of quartz ± carbonate which 
locally contain zones of disseminated to massive sulphides with varying amounts of pyrite, 
galena, and/or sphalerite.They are found locally around the Brucejack Plateau outside the main 
areas of alteration.Individual veins may be strongly gossanous. 
 
Precious and base metal veins (e.g. West Zone) are polymetallic stockworks of thin veins and 
fracture fillings.Tension gash structures are common.The veins show complex crosscutting 
relationships that indicate repeated fracturing and filling as the host rocks underwent brittle 
deformation. 
 
Precious metal mineralization may be confined to one particular episode of veining, which is not 
necessarily the same episode as base metal mineralization.The gold is associated with pyrite + 
electrum in quartz ± calcite veins.Arsenopyrite may occur peripherally in the host rock;  
 
Barite veins were first discovered by Bruce and Jack Johnson in 1935 near the outflow of 
Brucejack Lake.They consist of coarsely crystalline barite with minor quartz, carbonate, and 
sulphides. 
 
Porphyry-Type Mineralization 
 
Porphyry-type disseminated pyrite-chalcopyrite-molybdenite mineralization occurs on the 
Snowfield and KSM Properties immediately adjacent to the north and west of the Brucejack 
Property.Such mineralization occurs within sub alkaline porphyritic intrusions, including 
monzodiorite, monzonite, syenite, and granite.  
 
The porphyry-type gold and copper deposits (e.g. Mitchell, Sulphurets, and Snowfield Zone) 
usually have a higher-grade central or core area surrounded by lower-grade mineralization that is 
dispersed over a very large area and is related to very fine grained disseminated chalcopyrite.

Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

Within the higher grade core area, gold and copper grades correlate closely with one another.The 
Cu /Au ratio tends to be slightly higher closer to the phyllic-propylitic transitional areas.In the 
low-grade peripheral shells, the Cu /Au grades tend to be the highest.The gold and copper 
distribution is remarkably smooth and continuous with grades decreasing very gradually outward 
from the higher grade core.These observations suggest that the deposit was generated by a large, 
stable hydrothermal system with a low thermal gradient within homogeneous host rocks.The 
distribution was minimally disrupted by late faulting with only minor offsets. 
 
8.3.1 West Zone 
 
The following descriptions (Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.9) of the mineralization of the West, West 
Zone Footwall, Bridge, Bridge Halo, Galena Hill, Shore, SG, Gossan Hill and Valley of Kings 
Zones of the Brucejack Property were provided by Mr. Ron Burk, Chief Geologist at Silver 
Standard, and Mr. Ken McNaughton, Vice President and Chief Exploration Officer, Pretivm in 
the form of an internal company report, dated December 9, 2009 and recent verbal 
communication.  
 
The West Zone gold-silver deposit is hosted by a north-westerly trending band of lower Jurassic 
(Unuk River member, Hazelton Group) andesitic and lesser sedimentary rocks (Figure 8.2), 
400 m to 500 m wide, that passes between two intrusive bodies of plagioclase-hornblende 
porphyry.The supracrustal rocks are steeply inclined to the northeast and display varying degrees 
of brittle-ductile deformation and moderate to intense hydrothermal alteration, particularly where 
the precious metal deposit has been outlined.  
 
The deposit itself comprises at least 10 quartz veins and quartz stockwork shoots, the longest of 
which has a strike length of ~250 m and a maximum thickness of about ~6 m.Most mineralized 
shoots have vertical extents that are greater than their strike lengths.Geometries of the main veins 
suggest they represent central and oblique shear veins which developed in response to 
transpressional strain and resulting sinistral, mainly ductile deformation (Roach and Macdonald, 
1991).Crack-seal features shown by most of the veins are evidence of brittle deformation 
overlapping with some crystallization of gangue minerals.Thus, at the West Zone, it appears that 
ductile shearing generated the dilatant structures that served as conduits for the hydrothermal 
fluids, which deposited silica and precious metals, but hydrostatic overpressures within the 
conduits intermittently caused brittle failure along these structures.  
 
In terms of hydrothermal alteration, the West Zone is marked by a central silicified zone that 
passes outwards to a zone of sericite ± quartz ± carbonate and then an outer zone of chlorite ± 
sericite ± carbonate.The combined width of these alteration zones across the central part of the 
deposit is 100 m to 150 m. 
 
Gold in the West Zone occurs principally as electrum and in quartz veins and is associated with, 
in decreasing order of abundance, pyrite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and galena.Besides being 
found with gold in electrum, silver occurs in tetrahedrite, pyrargyrite, polybasite, and rarely 
stephanite and acanthtite.Gangue mineralogy of the veins is dominatedby quartz, with accessory 
K-feldspar, albite, sericite, and minor carbonate and barite.

8.3.2 West Zone Footwall Zone 
 
The West Zone Footwall Zone is located along the entire footwall of the West Zone.It lies 
approximately 50 m to 200 m south-west of the West zone and was intersected by holes SU-63, 
SU-98 and SU-100.These holes cover an area 600 m long. Resources are currently Inferred only. 
 
8.3.3 Bridge Zone 
 
The Bridge Zone is located about 1,500 m north of the southern Brucejack property boundary 
and is centred on a 3-ha nunatak outcrop that is surrounded by ice of the eastern arm of the 
Sulphurets glacier.Geologists working for Newhawk and the Geological Survey of Canada had 
previously mapped and sampled this outcrop, recognizing that it displayed strong sericite-pyrite 
alteration and was transected by a number of discontinuous mineralized quartz veins.Based on 
the encouraging gold assays obtained in these historical rock-chip samples, decision was made to 
test the prospect with a single drill hole, SU-10 (Figure 8.3).Assay results for this drill hole 
showed that it intersected a broad zone of low-grade gold mineralization of possible economic 
significance.  
 
The mineralized intercept in SU-10 was reported as being 483 m averaging 0.70 g/t Au and 
extended from surface.The discovery of potentially bulk-mineable gold at the Bridge Zone 
prompted drilling of another 12 diamond bore holes to probe for the limits of this mineralization.  
 
These drill holes determined that the bulk of the gold mineralization is hosted by plagioclase-
hornblende porphyry intrusive rock that in general is moderately sericite-chlorite altered, with 
disseminated and stringer pyrite making up a few percent of the rock by volume.Quartz ± 
chlorite ± sericite veins, 20 cm to 200 cm in thickness, were intermittently intersected by the drill 
holes, and these commonly contain minor to trace amounts of pyrite, sphalerite, galena, 
molybdenite, and unknown dark grey, silver-bearing sulfosalt(s).

8.3.4 Bridge Zone Halo Zone 
 
The Bridge Zone Halo Zone was modeled separately from the Bridge Zone as a low grade halo 
in order to ensure that all potentially economic mineralization was captured for mineral resource 
estimation.A secondary mineralization halo for the Bridge Zone was subsequently modeled using 
a 0.20 g/t Au grade shell. 
 
8.3.5 Galena Hill Zone 
 
The prospect area known as Galena Hill is situated between the West Zone and Bridge Zone gold 
deposits on a prominent hill marked by widespread iron oxide staining of altered meta-
andesites.The Galena Hill Zone had been previously tested with 27 bore holes belonging to a 
number of different drilling campaigns, with half of the holes being less than 100 m in 
length.Assays from these holes, together with detailed geological mapping and channel rock-
sampling, indicated that there was a system of E-W and NE-SW-trending quartz veins and quartz 
stockworks at Galena Hill that, as a whole, defined a zone of hydrothermal alteration and 
mineralization that is at least 460 m long and 300 m wide. 
 
Rather than target the larger quartz veins, which locally contain high-grade gold + silver 
mineralization on surface, a decision was made to test for the potential of a low-grade, bulk-
mineable deposit.This was done with eight relatively long (>400 m) drill holes completed during 
the 2009 exploration program.The majority of these bore holes passed through amygdaloidal and 
massive andesite flows, volcaniclastic deposits rich in lapilli-sized andesitic clasts and thin units 
of carbonaceous and cherty mudstone.A few holes intersected rhyolitic dikes and one hole (SU-
05) yielded a 50 m-long quartz vein intercept enriched in gold and silver along its margins, 
though it is likely that this intercept is at a low angle to the dip of the vein.  
 
As in the West Zone, gold mineralization at the Galena Hill Zone is preferentially associated 
with quartz veins (Figure 8.4), although the sericite-altered, andesitic host rocks are typically 
mineralized with disseminated pyrite and have geochemically anomalous gold contents, 
generally in the 100-500 ppb Au range.In some veins, trace amounts of native gold and electrum 
are accompanied by minor to occasionally substantial amounts of sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and 
galena.

8.3.6 Valley of Kings Zone 
 
The Valley of Kings Zone (Figure 8.5) was discovered by Esso in 1981 and was previously 
referred to as the Electrum Zone. It lies between the Bridge and Galena Hill Zones.Very little 
work has been completed on this zone, but what is currently known is that there are multi-
kilogram intersections in parallel zones.The best intersection to date was in hole SU-12 which 
yielded 1.5 metres at 16,949 g/t Au and 8,697 g/t Ag.Resources are all currently classified as 
Inferred in this zone.

8.3.7 Shore Zone 
 
A small gold-silver resource was identified by Newhawk along the north-eastern shore of the 
peninsula that extends into the west end of Brucejack Lake.Referred to as the Shore Zone, it is a 
zone of quartz veining hosted by foliated, sericite-altered andesite with a strike length of roughly 
530 m and a maximum width of 50 m (Figure 8.6).The NW-SE trend of the zone is coincident 
with a pronounced structural lineament (likely a shear fault) that extends from the Brucejack 
Fault south-eastward beneath Brucejack Lake. 
 
Several discrete quartz veins and quartz stockworks were traced along the zone, with historical 
drilling being concentrated on the southern end of the zone.The veins occur as 'stacked', en 
echelon, sigmoidal lenses up to 100 m in length and 1.5 m wide, although they are typically 
20 to 40 m long.Predominantly composed of quartz with minor carbonate and barite, the veins 
contain podiform sulphide mineralization consisting of varying amounts of pyrite, tetrahedrite, 
sphalerite, galena, and arsenopyrite.Electrum has been observed in trace amounts.Silver is 
present in some of the highest concentrations observed in the Brucejack area.

8.3.8 SG Zone 
 
The SG Zone is located in the north-central part of the Brucejack property and is represented by 
an area of iron oxide-stained, sericite-altered rock that occurs adjacent to the northerly striking 
Brucejack Fault.Channel rock sampling done by Silver Standard and earlier workers tested a 
restricted zone of quartz stockwork veining close to the major fault as well as an east-striking, 
150 m-long and 20 to 80 cm-wide quartz vein that extends westwards from the stockwork.  
 
In addition, seven historic and four Silver Standard diamond drill holes tested for gold 
mineralization in this area.The Silver Standard boreholes passed through a sequence of mainly 
clastic andesitic rocks (Figure 8.7) – likely re-deposited tuff and lapilli tuff – that are intercalated 
with quartzo-feldspathic sandstone and minor siltstone units.  
 
SU-004 yielded the best mineralized intersection of the four Silver Standard drillholes; 75 m 
averaging 1.62 g/t Au, including 27 m at 2.57 g/t Au.This intersection contains surprisingly 
minor quartz veining; instead, the mineralized lapilli tuff hosts minor quartz-carbonate 
stockwork veinlets and trace amounts of fine, acicular arsenopyrite in addition to 1-3% 
disseminated pyrite.

8.3.9 Gossan Hill Zone 
 
The mineralized zone known as Gossan Hill (Figure 8.8), is a circular area, about 400 m in 
diameter, of intense quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration developed in Jurassic andesite of the Unuk 
River member of the Betty Creek formation.This visually impressive alteration zone is host to at 
least eleven quartz vein and quartz stockwork structures most of which trend east-west and dip 
steeply to the north. Individual structures are up to 250 m-long and 20 m-wide.  
 
Historical work done at Gossan Hill consisted of rock-chip sampling, hand trenching and 
diamond drilling, with a few +400-m holes passing through the central part of the mineralized 
area.Precious metal mineralization at the Gossan Hill Zone is sporadic but generally best 
developed in the larger quartz lenses, particularly where these contain minor aggregates of 
pyrite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, and galena.Electrum is rarely observed, while silver also occurs in 
tetrahedrite, pyragyrite, and polybasite.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
9.1 SNOWFIELD PROPERTY 
 
There was no other exploration work undertaken on the Snowfield property in 2010 apart from 
diamond drilling, which is described in detail in Section 10. 
 
9.2 BRUCEJACK PROPERTY 
 
The 2010 program included mapping on the Brucejack Property, preliminary geotechnical and 
environmental studies of the Scott Creek proposed tailings site, lay out and permit initiation of 
the access road into Brucejack Lake, geotechnical drilling as well as PQ metallurgical core 
drilling of the proposed open pits at Snowfield and Brucejack.  
 
The preliminary geotechnical and environmental studies are presented in Section 17 of this 
report. Metallurgical testing is currently in progress, with no new results to report.

10.0 DRILLING 
 
10.1 SNOWFIELD PROPERTY DRILLING 
 
The 2010 drill program at Snowfield included a total 17,976 meters of drilling, completed in 46 
drill holes.Highlights of the program included discovery of a new band of relatively high grade 
copper mineralization on the south-east flank of the deposit and extension of the gold dominant 
Upper Snowfield further to the south than previously interpreted.Both of these zones are in areas 
of the proposed open pit that was previously classified as waste, (see Figure 10.1). Table 10.1 
presents a list of the best intersections from 2010. 
 
Drilling contractors in 2010 were Radius Drilling and Matrix Drilling. The average number of 
drill rigs on site at any given time was seven, with a maximum number of nine. 
 
Down-hole, E-Z shot surveying of all holes showed that deviation on azimuths was a maximum 
of 15° for a 700 m long hole, with little movement on dip.Core recovery was excellent at ±95%. 
 
Drill hole collars were surveyed toward the end of the drilling campaign by McElhanney using a 
differential GPS. 
 
Crews were de-mobilized from the project for the winter season on September 29.Most portable 
equipment was stored in one of several winterized buildings on site.All of the tents were flown 
back to Stewart for storage, as well as the core from a number of key drill holes.

10.2 BRUCEJACK PROPERTY DRILLING 
 
In 2010, a total of 33,400 m of drilling was completed in 72 drill holes.The 2010 results defined 
a new area of mineralization in the West Zone, encountered further high-grade gold and silver 
mineralization in the Galena Hill Zone and expanded the known mineralization in the West, 
Galena Hill, Bridge and Shore Zones. A drill plan map is presented in Figure 10.2. Table 
10.2presents results of the significant intersections in 2010. 
 
West Zone 
 
Drilling defined a new area of mineralization in the footwall of the West Zone. Intersections in 
holes SU-63, SU-66, SU-67, SU-98 and SU-100 define the footwall mineralization measuring 
approximately 120 by 500 meters.The intersection in SU-98 was less than 50 meters from the 
historical West Zone which was defined by over 750 surface and underground drill holes and 
over 5,000 meters of underground workings. 
 
Galena Hill Zone 
 
The Galena Hill Zone, located 500 meters south of the West Zone, is host to disseminated gold-
silver mineralization together with structurally-controlled high-grade veins.Drilling continued to 
confirm the location of the high-grade structures intersected in 2009 and 2010.The highlight 
from the latest hole, SU-106 intersected three bands of mineralization including 0.69 meters of 
1,710 grams of gold per tonne and 1,080 grams of silver per tonne. 
 
This intersection encountered the same zone as defined by the high-grade intercepts in holes SU-
12, SU-29, SU-40 and SU-84 previously reported from the 2009 and 2010 programs and 
included in Table 10.2. 
 
Drilling in 2010 expanded the Galena Hill Zone by 100 meters to the northeast and 250 meters to 
the southwest. Galena Hill is open to the east and to depth. 
 
Bridge Zone 
 
The Bridge Zone, which exhibits porphyry-style gold-silver mineralization, measures 
approximately 600 meters by 900 meters, roughly three times the area defined in the 2009 drill 
program.Holes SU-92, SU-94 and SU-95 expanded the zone 200 meters further south than the 
area defined in 2009 drilling.Holes SU-64, SU-87 and SU-90 show that the zone remains open to 
the east.The highlight was hole SU-87, which intersected 168 meters averaging 1.09 grams of 
gold per tonne and 4.04 grams of silver per tonne and ended in mineralization. 
 
Shore Zone 
 
Eight holes completed on the Shore Zone expanded it to the northwest, where the zone remains 
open and to depth. 
 
In addition to work completed on these four zones, other targets were defined on the property 
that will require future follow-up sampling and drilling.  
 
The author believes that drilling has been conducted using industry best practice guidelines.

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
At the end of each drill shift all core was transported by helicopter to the handling, logging, and 
storage facility on site.Prior to any geotechnical and geological logging, the entire drill core was 
photographed in detail with the digital colour photographic images for each interval of core filed 
with the digital geological logs. 
 
A trained geo-technician recorded the core recovery and rock quality data for each measured 
drill run.All lithological, structural, alteration, and mineralogical features of the drill core were 
observed and recorded during the geological logging procedure.This information was later 
transcribed into the computer using a program that was compatible with Gemcom software. 
 
The geologist responsible for logging assigned drill core sample intervals with the criteria that 
the intervals did not cross geologic contacts and the maximum sample length was 
two metres.Within any geologic unit, sample intervals of 1.5 m long could be extended or 
reduced to coincide with any geologic contact.Sample lengths were rarely greater than 
two metres or less than 0.5 m, and they averaged 1.52 m long. 
 
Upon completion of the geological logging, the samples were sawn in half lengthwise.One-half 
of the drill core was placed in a plastic sample bag and the other half was returned to its original 
position in the core box.The sample bags were consolidated into larger shipping containers and 
delivered to the assay laboratory. 
 
It is the author's opinion that the core logging procedures employed are thorough and provide 
sufficient geotechnical and geological information.There is no apparent drilling or recovery 
factor that would materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the drilling results.

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
The 2010 program on the Snowfield-Brucejack Project used ALS Chemex as the principal 
laboratory.The samples that were originally sent to ALS Chemex in Terrace, BC, for sample 
preparation were then forwarded to the ALS Chemex facility in Vancouver, BC, for analysis. 
 
ALS Chemex is an internationally recognized minerals testing laboratory operating in 
16 countries and has an ISO 9001:2000 certification.The laboratory in Vancouver has also been 
accredited to ISO 17025 standards for specific laboratory procedures by the Standards Council 
of Canada (SCC). 
 
Samples at ALS Chemex were crushed to 70% passing 2 mm, (-10 mesh).Samples were riffle 
split and 500 g were pulverized to 85% passing 75 µm (-200 mesh).The remaining coarse reject 
material was returned to Pretivm for storage in their Smithers warehouse for possible future use. 
 
Gold was determined using fire assay on a 30 gram aliquot with an atomic absorption (AA) 
finish.Copper was determined using four acid digest with either inductively coupled plasma 
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) or AA analysis.In addition, a 33 element package was 
completed using a four acid digest and ICP-AES analysis, which included the silver, 
molybdenum, and rhenium. 
 
It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures are 
satisfactory.

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
13.1 SITE VISIT AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLING 2010 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project was visited by Mr. Fred Brown, CPG, Pr.Sci.Nat.from 
September 3 to 5, 2010.Independent verification sampling was done on diamond drill core, with 
20 samples distributed in 20 holes collected for assay. An attempt was made to sample intervals 
from a variety of low and high-grade material. The chosen sample intervals were then sampled 
by taking the remaining half-split core. The samples were then documented, bagged, and sealed 
with packing tape and were brought by Mr. Brown to ALS Chemex in Terrace, British Columbia 
for analysis. 
 
At no time, prior to the time of sampling, were any employees or other associates of Pretivm 
advised as to the location or identification of any of the samples to be collected.  
 
A comparison of the P&E independent sample verification results versus the original assay 
results can be seen in Figure 13.1toFigure 13.7.

13.2 PRETIVM QUALITY CONTROL SNOWFIELD DEPOSIT 
 
The QA/QC program was maintained throughout the 2010 drilling. Certified reference material 
standards named CDN ME-4 and CDN ME-12 were purchased from CDN Resource Labs in 
Langley, British Columbia. Both of these standards were certified for gold, silver and copper. 
One standard sample, one blank sample and one field duplicate sample (1/4 split core) were 
inserted every 20 samples. In addition, the lab inserted their own internal QC, which included 
standards, blanks and both coarse reject and pulp duplicates.

13.2.1 2010 Data Verification Results Snowfield 
 
The QC program was monitored on a real-time basis by Pretivm throughout 2010 and any 
standards failing the QC protocols were re-run.The author received all the data for the 
2010 drilling and verified the performance of the standards, blanks and duplicates.  
 
13.2.2 Performance of Certified Reference Material 
 
Standard ME-4 had 338 data points for gold, copper and silver.None of the data points fell 
outside three standard deviations from the mean, though several were between two and three 
standard deviations.All data points for all elements passed the QC and no action was required. 
 
The ME-12 standard had 322 data points for gold, copper and silver.All data points passed the 
QC. 
 
13.2.3 Performance of Blank Material 
 
The blank material used for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 drill programs was ¾" crushed granite sold 
by Imasco Minerals as landscape material. 
 
There were 662 blank samples analyzed during the 2010 program. The average gold grade in the 
blanks was 0.003 g/t Au.One value was of concern, however upon investigation the high value 
was deemed a misallocation, and no further action was required.  
 
For copper, the average grade of the blank material was 0.0008%, with a high value of 0.007%. 
One hundred thirty one values were greater than the upper threshold of ten times detection limit, 
which was 10 ppm Cu.Pretivm re-ran many of the over-limit samples. The author considers that 
none of the gold or copper failures had any impact on the metal value of the deposit. 
 
13.2.4 2010 Duplicate Statistics 
 
For the 2010 drill program, there were 664 field core duplicate pairs, 456 pulp duplicate pairs for 
gold and 345 pairs for copper. There were no coarse reject duplicates done. 
 
Data for the gold duplicate types were graphed using simple scatter graphs. Even at the field 
duplicate level, gold showed almost a 1:1 correlation. At the pulp level the correlation was also 
1:1. 
 
The copper duplicates yielded a 1:1 correlation at both the field and pulp duplicate level. 
 
13.2.5 Check Samples Assayers Canada 
 
Approximately 510 of the 2010 pulps from Snowfield were sent to Assayers Canada Lab 
("Assayers") in Vancouver as a check on the principal lab.Results were graphed for gold, silver 
and copper and precision was acceptable, indicating the principal lab is doing a satisfactory job.

13.3 PRETIVM QUALITY CONTROL BRUCEJACK DEPOSIT 
 
The QA/QC program was maintained throughout the 2010 drilling. Certified reference material 
standards named CDN ME-1 and CDN ME-3 were purchased from CDN Resource Labs in 
Langley, British Columbia. Both of these standards were certified for gold, silver and copper. 
One standard sample, one blank sample and one field duplicate sample (1/4split core) were 
inserted every 20 samples. In addition, the lab inserted their own internal QC, which included 
standards, blanks and both coarse reject and pulp duplicates. 
 
13.3.1 2010 Data Verification Results Brucejack 
 
The QC program was monitored on a real-time basis by Pretivm throughout 2010 and any 
standards failing the QC protocols were re-run.The author received all the data for the 
2010 drilling and verified the performance of the standards, blanks and duplicates.  
 
13.3.2 Performance of Certified Reference Material 
 
Standard ME-1 had 660 data points for gold and silver.None of the data points fell outside three 
standard deviations from the mean, though several were between two and three standard 
deviations.All data points for all elements passed the QC and no action was required. 
 
The ME-3 standard had 643 data points for gold and silver.All data points passed the QC. 
 
13.3.3 Performance of Blank Material 
 
The blank material used for the 2008, 2009 and 2010 drill programs was ¾" crushed granite sold 
by Imasco Minerals as landscape material. 
 
There were 1,115 blank samples analyzed during the 2010 program.The average gold grade in 
the blanks was 0.005 g/t Au.Six high values were investigated and deemed to be sampling errors. 
 
For silver, the average grade of the blank material was 0.35 g/t Ag.One high value was 
investigated and no further action was required. 
 
13.3.4 2010 Duplicate Statistics 
 
For the 2010 drill program, there were 1,309 field core duplicate pairs, 843 pulp duplicate pairs 
for gold and 24 pulp duplicate pairs analyzed for silver.There were no coarse reject duplicates 
done. 
 
Data for the gold duplicate types were graphed using simple scatter graphs.At the field duplicate 
level, the precision for gold was poor.At the pulp level the correlation was excellent. 
 
The silver duplicates yielded poor precision at the field duplicate level and 1:1 precision at the 
pulp duplicate level.

14.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
Within the adjacent KSM property there are three notable copper-gold mineral deposits, namely 
Kerr, Mitchell, and Sulphurets.In 2010, a fourth deposit, name the Iron Cap Zone was 
discovered.All of these occurrences are situated within the claim holdings currently owned and 
operated by Seabridge Gold Inc., ("Seabridge"). 
 
Seabridge acquired the property from Placer Dome in June 2000.In 2009, Resource Modeling 
Inc. completed updated NI 43-101-compliant resource estimates for the Kerr, Sulphurets, and 
Mitchell zones.The Mitchell Resource was reported in a news release dated March 11, 2009, and 
the Kerr and Sulphurets Resources were reported in a March 25, 2009, news release. 
 
In June 2009, a Preliminary Assessment estimated a 30-year mine life recovering 19.3 M oz of 
gold, 5.3 B lb of copper, 2.8 M oz of silver, and 1.9 M lb of molybdenum.In 
April 2010, Seabridge published the results of a subsequent Pre-feasibility Study.These results 
indicate an estimated Reserve statement as shown in Table 14.1.All information for this section 
has been taken from the Seabridge website at www.seabridgegold.net.

On February 8, 2011, Seabridge announced an Indicated resource containing 5.1 million ounces 
of gold and 1.7 billion pounds of copper for the Iron Cap Zone at its 100% owned KSM 
project.The Iron Cap Zone is immediately adjacent to the Mitchell deposit.The Indicated 
resource is flanked by a halo of Inferred resources containing an additional 3.4 million ounces of 
gold and 1.3 billion pounds of copper.The Iron Cap resource estimate was prepared by Resource 
Modeling Inc. of Stites, Idaho and will be incorporated into an updated Preliminary Feasibility 
Study ("PFS") scheduled for completion in April 2011.The NI 43-101 compliant global resource

16.0 BRUCEJACK AND SNOWFIELD MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
16.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The mineral resource estimate presented herein has been prepared following the guidelines of the 
Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1 and in 
conformity with generally accepted "CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves 
Best Practices" guidelines.Mineral resources have been classified in accordance with the "CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definition and Guidelines" (2005): 
 

• Inferred Mineral Resource: "An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a 
mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the 
basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but 
not verified, geological and grade continuity.The estimate is based on limited 
information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations 
such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes." 

• Indicated Mineral Resource: "An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a 
mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and 
physical characteristics, can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to 
allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to 
support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.The 
estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for 
geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed." 

• Measured Mineral Resource: "A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a 
mineral resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and 
physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with 
confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit.The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes 
that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity." 

 
Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
There is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral 
reserve.Confidence in the estimate of Inferred Mineral Resources is insufficient to allow the 
meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of 
economic viability worthy of public disclosure. 
 
All mineral resource estimation work reported herein was carried out by Fred Brown, CPG, 
Pr.Sci.Nat., and Eugene Puritch, P.Eng., of P&E Mining Consultants Inc., independent Qualified 
Persons in terms of NI 43-101.This mineral resource estimate is based on information and data 
supplied by Pretivm.A draft copy of this report was reviewed by Pretivm for factual errors. 
 
Mineral resource modeling and estimation were carried out using the commercially available 
GEMS Gemcom v5.23 and Snowden Supervisor v 7.10.11 software programs.Pit shell 
optimization was carried out using Whittle Four-XSingle Elementv 1.10.

The Brucejack mineral resource estimate encompasses nine distinct modeled mineralization 
domains, viz. the West Zone, West Zone Footwall Zone, Shore Zone, Gossan Hill Zone, Galena 
Hill Zone, SG Zone, Valley of Kings Zone (VOK), Bridge Zone and Bridge Zone Halo (Figure 
16.1). The Valley of Kings zone has been modeled as four distinct sub-domains. The effective 
date of this estimate is February 18, 2011. 
 
At Brucejack, drilling coverage increased from the 844 diamond drillholes used in the previous 
mineral resource estimate to the 908drillholesused in the current mineral resource estimate. The 
Bridge Zone increased 53% by volume due to the additional drilling, Galena Hill 32% and 
Gossan Hill 275%. In addition, a new mineral resource, the Valley of Kings, was defined by 
Silver Standard geologists from drilling and surface mapping of structural features, and is 
characterized by multiple high-grade Au intersections.

16.2 PREVIOUS RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
A previous public mineral resource estimate for the Brucejack deposits dated April 16, 2001 was 
prepared by Pincock Allen & Holt Ltd1.The mineral resource estimate reported a total Measured 
and Indicated mineral resource of 421,400 oz Au and an Inferred mineral resource of 82,000 oz 
of Au (Table 16.1), based on a gold-equivalent cut-off derived from a Ag:Au equivalency ratio 
of 66:1.

A mineral resource estimate dated December 1, 2009 for the Brucejack Deposit was prepared by 
P&E Mining Consultants Inc2. The mineral resource estimate reported a Measured and Indicated 
mineral resource of 4.04 million ounces Au and an Inferred mineral resource of 4.87 million 
ounces Au (Table 16.2) using a cut-off of 0.35g/t AuEq. The estimate was based on the results of 
844 drillholes and constrained within an optimized conceptual pit shell.

16.3 SAMPLE DATABASE 
 
Sample data were provided by Silver Standard in the form of ASCII text files and Excel 
spreadsheets. Data included historical surface drilling records, historical underground drilling 
records, and current Silver Standard drilling records. 
 
The supplied databases contain records for 1,002 drillholes.Of these, 94 drillholes were outside 
the block model limits or had no reported assay data. 
 
The 908 drillhole records (Table 16.3) used for this mineral resource estimate contain collar, 
survey and assay data. Assay data fields consist of the drillhole ID, downhole interval distances,

sample number, Au grades and Ag grades.All data are in metric units and all collar coordinates 
were converted by Silver Standard to the UTM NAD27 system.

Total 908 

 
The database contains a total of 76,227 Au assays and 75,291 Ag assays. Due to the varying 
assay protocols in use during different project phases, the following low grade conversions were 
used: 
 

• For the historical drilling, Au assay grades less than 0.17g/t were converted to 
0.085g/t, and Ag assay grades less than1.71g/t were converted to 0.85g/t 

• For the current Silver Standard drilling program, Au assay grades less than 0.005 
g/t were converted to 0.003 g/t, and Ag assay grades less than 0.5 g/t were 
converted to 0.25g/t.  

 
Silver Standard also provided an AutoCAD format wireframe of the historical underground 
mining development at the West Zone. Historic mine plans were used to digitize the 
underground development. Underground workings were digitized on 44 east-west sections in the 
mine grid coordinate system using AutoCAD software.Section lines were generally spaced every 
10 m, with a reduction to 5 m spacing in areas of more complex development (i.e., in areas of 
multiple tunnels, junctions etc.).The digitized data were converted to UTM NAD27 coordinates 
using the McElhanney conversion factors, imported into the Gemcom mining software, a single 
three dimensional solid to represent the underground workings generated. 
 
16.4 DATABASE VALIDATION 
 
Industry standard validation checks were completed on the supplied database, and minor 
corrections made. P&E typically validates a mineral resource database by checking for 
inconsistencies in naming conventions or analytical units, duplicate entries, interval, length or 
distance values less than or equal to zero, blank or zero-value assay results, out-of-sequence 
intervals, intervals or distances greater than the reported drill hole length, inappropriate collar 
locations, and missing interval and coordinate fields. No significant discrepancies with the 
supplied data were noted. 
 
Downhole surveys for the current drilling were completed by Silver Standard with a Reflex EZ-
Shot magnetic instrument. Measurements were taken every 100m unless drastic deviations 
occurred, in which case additional measurements were taken every 50 m to eliminate error. 
Downhole survey data were examined by P&E for significant deviations.

Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

16.5 TOPOGRAPHIC CONTROL 
 
For the Snowfield-Brucejack Project, aerial photography specialists Aero Geometrics were 
contracted by Silver Standard to produce a topographic map of the property. Using high-
resolution photographs taken from a small airplane in 2008, a photo-mosaic was first made of the 
Brucejack and adjoining Snowfield properties. Using this photo-mosaic and elevation data 
obtained from 1:50,000 scale national topographic maps published in 1979 by the Surveys and 
Mapping Branch of the Department of Energy, Mines & Resources, Aero Geometrics digitally 
generated a contoured topographic map with contour lines spaced at two-meter intervals and 
presented this map as a digital elevation model, or DEM, in dxf (AutoCAD) format. In order for 
this topographic map to be consistent with the NAD27, Zone 9 UTM grid system being used by 
Silver Standard for the projects, it was necessary to make minor adjustments (vertical and lateral 
shifts) to the positioning of the DEM. These adjustments were carried out by various workers, 
including geological consultants and McElhanney technicians, and were checked against 
numerous topographic points (historic and 2009 Brucejack drill hole collars, the western 
shoreline of Brucejack Lake, historic mine grid stations) that had been surveyed by McElhanney 
field crews in 2009. 
 
16.6 DENSITY 
 
A total of 317 bulk density measurements were provided by Silver Standard, with an average 
bulk density of 2.81t/m3 (Table 16.4). Bulk density measurements were obtained from core 
samples by ALS Chemex. For the West Zone a value of 2.75 t/m has been used historically. A 
global bulk density of 2.80t/m3 was assigned to all lithologies for this mineral resource estimate.

16.7 BRUCEJACK DOMAIN MODELING 
 
Several discrete mineralization domains at Brucejack have been identified by Silver Standard, 
with the West Zone, Shore Zone and Valley of Kings Zone considered by Silver Standard as 
being predominately structurally controlled vein systems related to the north-trending Brucejack 
Fault and associated Reidel shear structures, and the other domains tentatively defined as 
mineralized stockwork/breccia/vein systems. (Pers. Comm. W Board 2010). 
 
The overall trend of the West Zone, West Zone Footwall Zone and Shore Zone mineralization is 
~135°, and modeling for these domains was generating from successive polylines spaced every 
ten meters and oriented perpendicular to the trend of the mineralization. The outlines of the 
polylines were defined by the selection of mineralized material at or above 0.5g/t Au with 
demonstrated continuity along strike and down dip. In some cases mineralization below 0.5g/t 
Au was included for the purpose of maintaining continuity. All polyline vertices were snapped 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 100 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

directly to drillhole assay intervals, in order to generate a true three-dimensional representation 
of the extent of the mineralization. 
 
The general trend of the Valley of Kings mineralization has been identified by Silver Standard 
geologists as predominantly east-west, with high-grade zones associated with internal Reidel 
shear structures. Four distinct sub-domains were modeled for the Valley of Kings Zone from 
successive polylines spaced every ten meters perpendicular to this trend. 
 
For the Gossan Hill Zone, Galena Hill Zone, SG Zone and Bridge Zone domains the 
mineralization models were generated from successive polylines spaced every 25 meters and 
oriented north-south. The outlines of the polylines were defined by the selection of mineralized 
material at or above 0.5g/t Au with demonstrated continuity along strike and down dip. In some 
cases mineralization below 0.5g/t Au was included for the purpose of maintaining continuity. All 
polyline vertices were snapped directly to drillhole assay intervals, in order to generate a true 
three-dimensional representation of the extent of the mineralization. 
 
In order to ensure that all potentially economic mineralization was captured for mineral resource 
estimation, a secondary mineralization halo for the Bridge Zone was subsequently modeled 
using a Au0.2g/t grade shell. Three-dimensional models of the low-grade mineralization domain 
were then created by combining successive polylines into wireframes. In addition, a profile of 
the glacier margins at Bridge Zone was constructed from ice/bedrock contacts logged during 
drilling, and the Bridge Zone and Bridge Zone Halo domains were clipped to this surface. 
 
16.8 COMPOSITING 
 
Assay sample lengths for the database range from 0.05 m to 48 m, with an average sample length 
of 1.50m. A compositing length of 1.50m was therefore selected for use. Length-weighted 
composites were calculated for Au and Ag within the defined mineralization domains. Missing 
sample intervals in the historical data were assigned a nominal background grade of 0.001g/t Au 
or 0.001g/t Ag. 
 
The compositing process started at the first point of intersection between the drillhole and the 
domain intersected, and halted upon exit from the domain wireframe. Composites that were less 
than 0.5m in length were discarded so as to not introduce a short sample bias into the estimation 
process. The wireframes that represented the interpreted mineralization domains were also used 
to back-tag a rock code field into the drillhole workspace.Composites were assigned a domain 
rock code value based on the domain wireframe that the interval midpoint fell within. The 
composite data were then exported to Gemcom extraction files for grade estimation.  
 
16.9 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
 
Summary assay statistics were calculated separately for surface and underground sample 
populations (Table 16.5), with fourteen surface drilling assay grades of 1000 g/t Au or higher, 
and four underground drilling assay grades reporting assays of 1000 g/t Au or higher. 
 
The correlation coefficient for the total Au and Ag sample populations is 0.19, indicating little 
correlation. However, for the surface assay sample population considered separately the 
correlation coefficient is 0.24, rising to 0.32 for the underground population.

Summary composite statistics were calculated by domain for each commodity (Table 16.6). A 
comparison of the domain averages demonstrates the differences in grade distributions between 
the defined domains, with the highest average composite grades occurring at the Valley of 
Kings, followed by the West Zone.

16.10 TREATMENT OF EXTREME VALUES 
 
The presence of high-grade outliers was evaluated by examining histograms and log-probability 
graphs of the domain-coded and composited grade data for the defined mineralization domains, 
and where possible the observed correlations between Au and Ag were also taken into account. 
For the West Zone, West Zone Footwall, Shore Zone and Valley of Kings Zone, estimation was 
done using Median Indicator Kriging, and thresholds for these domains were derived from the 
high-grade bin. Threshold values were selected that reduce the influence of high-grade outliers 
during linear estimation while minimizing changes in the composite sample distribution, and 
composites were capped to this value prior to estimation (Table 16.7).

16.11 CONTINUITY ANALYSIS 
 
For the Bridge Zone, Bridge Zone Halo, Galena Hill, Gossan Hill and SG Zone domains omni-
directional experimental semi-variograms were modeled from uncapped composite data using a 
normal-scores transformation (Table 16.8). The downhole variogram was viewed at a 1.5 m lag 
spacing (equivalent to the composite length) to assess the nugget variance. Nugget and 
standardized spherical models were used to model the experimental semi-variograms in normal-
score transformed space. Semi-variogram model ranges were then checked and iteratively 
refined for each model relative to the overall nugget variance. Back-transformed variance 
contributions were calculated for grade interpolation. Continuity ellipses based on the semi-
variogram models were then generated for each variable in each domain and used to define the 
appropriate search ellipses.

For the West Zone, West Zone Footwall, Shore Zone and Valley of Kings domains, median 
indicator semi-variograms were modeled from uncapped composite data based on observed 
breaks between high-grade and low-grade sample populations (Table 16.9). Normal-score semi-
variograms for each of the three principle directions were calculated, and in general the 
horizontal and across-strike directions were aligned with observed mineralization trends, with 
the dip-plane direction being variable.

16.12 BLOCK MODELS 
 
The identified Brucejackmineralization domains extend along a corridor 500 m wide and 
3,500 m in length. In order to facilitate mine planning and optimization, a single orthogonal 
block model was established across the property using a 10m x 10m x 10m block size (Table 
16.10). The block model consists of separate models for Au estimated grades, Ag estimated 
grades, indicator kriging probabilities, associated rock codes, percent, density and classification 
attributes and a calculated Au-equivalent ("AuEq") grade. A percent block model was used to 
accurately represent the volumes and tonnages that were contained within the respective 
mineralization domains. As a result, domain boundaries are properly represented by the percent 
model's capacity to measure infinitely variable inclusion percentages within a specific domain. 
The volume of the defined historical workings was also calculated for the West Zone and 
depleted from the model prior to estimation.

16.13 ESTIMATION& CLASSIFICATION 
 
The mineral resource estimate was constrained by wireframes that form hard boundaries between 
the respective composite data files. Individual block grades were used to calculate a Au-
equivalent (AuEq) block grade model. 
 
For the Bridge Zone, Bridge Zone Halo, Galena Hill, Gossan Hill and SG Zone mineralization 
domains, block grades were estimated using Ordinary Kriging of composite values. A two-pass 
series of expanding search ellipses with varying minimum sample requirements was used for 
sample selection, estimation and classification.  
 
During the first pass, eight to twelve composite values from three or more drillholes within a 
search ellipse corresponding to the defined ranges were required for estimation. All block grades 
estimated during the first pass were classified as Indicated. 
 
During the second pass, blocks not populated during the first pass were estimated. Three to 
twelve composite values from one or more drillholes within a search ellipse corresponding to 
about 200% of the defined range were required for estimation. All block grades estimated during 
the second pass were classified as Inferred. All SG Zone and Bridge Zone Halo mineral 
resources were all classified as Inferred. 
 
For the West Zone, West Zone Footwall, Shore Zone and Valley of Kings mineralization 
domains the block estimates were calculated using Median Indicator Kriging. Based on the 
defined indicator semi-variograms, for each block a high-grade probability, high grade estimate 
and low-grade estimate were calculated and then combined into a single block estimate. A three-

pass series of expanding search ellipses with varying minimum sample requirements was used 
for sample selection, estimation and classification: 
 
During the first pass, six to twelve composite values from two or more drillholes within a search 
ellipse corresponding to 50% of the defined range were required for estimation. All block grades 
estimated during the first pass were classified as Measured. This level of classification was 
applied only to the West Zone, where extensive surface and underground drilling has defined the 
continuity of the mineralization. 
 
During the second pass, blocks not populated during the first pass were estimated. Four to twelve 
composite values from two or more drillholes within a search ellipse corresponding to 100% of 
the defined range were required for estimation. All block grades estimated during the second 
pass were classified as Indicated. 
 
During the third pass, blocks not populated during the first or second pass were estimated. Three 
to twelve composite values from one or more drillholes within a search ellipse corresponding to 
about 200% of the defined range were required for estimation. All block grades estimated during 
the third pass were classified as Inferred. All Valley of Kings mineral resources were classified 
as Inferred. 
 
16.14 BRUCEJACK MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
In order to ensure that the reported mineral resources meet the CIM requirement for "reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction", conceptual Lerchs-Grossman optimized pit shells were 
developed based on all available mineral resources (Measured, Indicated and Inferred), using the 
economic parameters listed in Table 16.11. Commodity prices are based on the three-year 
trailing average as of 31 December 2010.The results from the optimized pit-shells are used 
solely for the purpose of reporting mineral resources that have reasonable prospects for 
economic extraction.

(1) Mineral resources for the February 2011 estimate are defined within a Whittle optimized pit shell that 
incorporates project metal recoveries, estimated operating costs and metals price assumptions. Parameters used in 
the estimate include metals prices (and respective recoveries) of US$1,025/oz. gold (71%) and US$16.60/oz. silver 
(70%). The pit optimization utilized the following cost parameters: Mining US$1.75/tonne, Processing 
US$6.10/tonne and G&A US$0.90/tonne along with pit slopes of 45 degrees.. Mineral resources which are not 
mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially 
affected by environmental, permitting, legal, marketing, or other relevant issues. The mineral resources in this news 
release were estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on 
Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve 
Definitions and adopted by CIM Council. 
(2) The quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has 
been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as an Indicated or Measured mineral resource and it 
is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured mineral resource 
category.

16.15 VALIDATION 
 
The block model was validated visually by the inspection of successive section lines in order to 
confirm that the block model correctly reflects the distribution of high-grade and low-grade 
samples.  
 
An additional validation check was completed by comparing model block grade estimates to the 
average grade of capped composites within a corresponding block (Table 16.15). For the 
domains estimated by Ordinary Kriging the observed differences in grades suggest a minimal 
bias. For the West Zone, West Zone Footwall and Shore Zone a high degree of correlation 
between the composite average grades and model block estimates was also observed. For the 
Valley of Kings model the presence of multiple very high-grade samples and mixed sample 
populations has biased the overall comparison of average grades, and indicates that moving 
forward additional work is indicated in order to further differentiate the high and low grade 
sample populations.

In order to evaluate the conditional bias associated with the use of small blocks across the project 
area, grade/tonnage curves were calculated against a series of Au cut-offs for both the 10m x10m 
x10m estimates, and for a series of 25m x25m x10m estimates for the Bridge Zone, Bridge Zone 
Halo, Galena Hill, Gossan Hill and SG domains. The results indicate that on a global scale the 
conditional bias is not significant at this stage (Figure 16.3).

16.16 SNOWFIELD MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
Silver Standard geologists identified two principle operational zones,the upper Snowfield and the 
lower Main Zone.Analysis of the assay data indicates that the Snowfield Zone is preferentially 
Au-enriched and Cu poor, while the Main Zone contains comparatively higher Cu grades on 
average. 
 
At Snowfield, drilling coverage increased from the 141 diamond drillholes used in the previous 
mineral resource estimate to the 192 drillholes used in the current mineral resource estimate. 
Definition of the mineralized zone expanded 196% by volume, primarily in the Upper Zone 
along the southern margin due to the additional drilling. Overall grades remained the same.

16.17 PREVIOUS RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
Subsequent to the initial mineral resource estimate undertaken on the Snowfield Project in 2006 
an updated mineral resource estimate dated April 21, 2008 was prepared by Minorex Consulting 
Ltd3. The mineral resource estimate reported a Measured and Indicated mineral resource of 3.08 
million ounces Au and an Inferred mineral resource of 0.47 million ounces Au in-situ (Table

16.18 SNOWFIELD SAMPLE DATABASE 
 
Sample data were provided by Silver Standard in the form of ASCII text files, Excel 
spreadsheets and Access databases.  
 
P&E prepared a Gemcom format Access database from the data supplied by Silver Standard. 
The 192 drillhole and fifteen sampling trench records contain collar, survey, lithology, alteration 
and assay data (Table 16.20). Assay data fields consist of drillhole ID, downhole interval 
distances, sample number, and Au, Ag, Cu and Mo grade fields.All data are in metric units and 
grid coordinates are in the UTM NAD27 system.Assay values equal to the lower detection limit 
were converted to half of the lower detection limit.

16.19 DATABASE VALIDATION 
 
Industry standard validation checks were completed on the supplied database, and minor 
corrections made. P&E typically validates a mineral resource database by checking for 
inconsistencies in naming conventions or analytical units, duplicate entries, interval, length or 
distance values less than or equal to zero, blank or zero-value assay results, out-of-sequence 
intervals, intervals or distances greater than the reported drill hole length, inappropriate collar 
locations, and missing interval and coordinate fields. No significant discrepancies with the 
supplied data were noted.  
 
Downhole survey measurements were completed by Silver Standard with a Reflex EZ-Shot 
magnetic instrument. Measurements were taken every 100m unless drastic deviations occurred, 
in which case additional measurements were taken every 50m to eliminate error. Downhole 
survey data were examined by P&E for significant deviations.  
 
16.20 TOPOGRAPHIC CONTROL 
 
Silver Standard Resources contracted McElhanney Consulting Services to produce a detailed 
topographic plan of the Snowfield project area.This plan, drafted at 1:2000 scale and displayed 
with the North American Datum 1927 (NAD27), Zone 9 UTM grid, covers an area of 
2.85 square kilometers, with the northwest corner of the area located at 423,900 mE, 
6,265,500 mN and the southeast corner having coordinates 425,400 mE, 6,263,600 mN.To 
generate the topographic contours for this area, with the contour interval being at one meter, 
McElhanney used a LIDAR satellite image of the area along with 36 field control points that 
were surveyed with a Leica 500 GPS instrument during the summer months of 2006 through 
2009.In addition, the locations of 101 diamond drill hole collars that were surveyed by 
McElhanney field crews during the four field seasons were incorporated into the database which 
generated the topographic contours.The McElhanney topography map was originally produced 
with a NAD83, Zone 9 UTM grid system and this was then converted to the NAD27 system 
using national Transformation Model NTv2Points.P&E compared the drillhole collar elevations 
to the topographic surface, and where the difference in elevation exceeded 2.00 m the collar 
elevation was converted to the topographic elevation. 
 
16.21 BULK DENSITY 
 
A total of 601 bulk density measurements were provided by Silver Standard, with an average 
bulk density of 2.79t/m3. Density measurements were obtained from core samples by ALS 
Chemex. Bulk density summary statistics were calculated across the deposit and by domain. No 
trend or significant difference was observed to the bulk density data across domains, and a value 
of 2.79 t/m3was applied globally (Table 16.21).

16.22 SNOWFIELD DOMAIN MODELING 
 
Silver Standard geologists identified two principle operational zones,the upper Snowfield and the 
lower Main Zone. Summary assays statistics by operational zone are tabulated in Table 16.22. 
Analysis of the assay data indicates that the Snowfield Zone is preferentially Au-enriched and 
Cu poor, while the Main Zone contains comparatively higher Cu grades on average (Figure 
16.4).

Regression coefficients were calculated by operational zone for theAu, Cu, Ag and Mo assay 
gradesin order to assess correlations between the variables (Table 16.23). The results indicate a 
moderate correlation between Au and Cu for the Main Zone. Additional analysis suggests that 
two distinct Au populations are present: a low-grade population associated with Cu 
mineralization and a higher grade Au population (Figure 16.5).

The total extent of the mineralization was defined by a 0.20 g/t Au mineralization halo, bounded 
by sub-vertical faulting and a lower basal fault. Within the mineralization halo a core domain, 
based on a 0.50g/t Au grade shell was delineated, reflecting the observed silica-dominated 
alteration zone.For Cu, the mineralization halo was split into upper and lower domains, based on 
an observed split between low grade and high grade Cu assay values at 0.10% Cu. 
 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 116 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

Mineralization domains were created by computer screen digitizing of successive polylines on 
sections spaced twenty-five meters apart.The outlines of the polylines were defined by the 
selection of mineralized material with demonstrated continuity along strike and down dip.In 
some cases mineralization below the selected threshold was included for the purpose of 
maintaining continuity.Sectional polyline interpretations were digitized from drillhole to 
drillhole and snapped directly to assay intervals, but typically not extended more than the 
distance between two sections.A three-dimensional wireframe was then created by combining 
successive polylines into a wireframe. Wireframes were clipped above an interpreted overburden 
surface, and below the basal fault 
 
16.23 COMPOSITING 
 
Assay sample lengths for the database range from 0.14 m to 13.11 m, with an average sample 
length of 1.52m. A total of 74% of the assays had a sample interval length of 1.50 m. A 
compositing length of 1.50m was therefore selected for use during estimation. 
 
Length-weighted composites were calculated for Au within the core and low-grade 
mineralization shell,and for Cu, Ag and Mo within the upper and lower Cu grade domains. The 
compositing process started at the first point of intersection between the drillhole and the domain 
intersected, and halted upon exit from the domain wireframe. A small number of unsampled 
intervals were treated as null values. Composites that were less than 0.5m in length were 
discarded so as to not introduce a short sample bias into the estimation process. The wireframes 
that represented the interpreted domains were also used to back-tag a rock code field into the 
drillhole workspace. Assays and composites were assigned a domain rock code value based on 
the domain wireframe that the interval midpoint fell within. The composite data were then 
exported to Gemcom extraction files for grade estimation.  
 
16.24 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
 
Summary composite statistics (Table 16.24) were calculated by domain for each commodity. 
Comparison of the data sets indicates that no significant bias was introduced from the 
compositing process. A comparison of the data sets also demonstrates the differences in grade 
distributions within the domains. 
 
Assay sample populations drawn from the trenching data and the drillhole data were also 
examined by commodity. The trenching assay data show a positive bias for Au and Ag when 
compared to the local drillhole data. A bias of this type often occurs in trenching data, and is 
typically the result of weathering, preferential sampling by the geologist, over-collection of 
softer mineralized material during sampling, or any combination of the above. The trenching 
data were therefore used while defining the extent of the mineralization, but were not used for 
mineral resource estimation.

16.25 TREATMENT OF EXTREME VALUES 
 
The presence of high-grade outliers was evaluated by examining mean and variance cutting 
graphs, histograms and log-probability graphs of the domain-coded and composited grade data, 
in order to limit the influence of extreme values during linear grade interpolation.Threshold 
values were selected that minimize changes in the composite sample distribution, and 
composites were capped to this value prior to estimation(Table 16.25).

16.26 CONTINUITY ANALYSIS 
 
Omni-directional experimental semi-variograms were modeled from uncapped composite data 
using a normal-scores transformation. The downhole variogram was viewed at a 1.5 m lag 
spacing (equivalent to the composite length) to assess the nugget variance. Nugget and 
standardized spherical models were used to model the experimental semi-variograms in normal-
score transformed space. Semi-variogram model ranges were then checked and iteratively 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 118 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

refined for each model relative to the overall nugget variance. Back-transformed variance 
contributions were calculated for grade interpolation. Continuity ellipses based on the semi-
variogram models were then generated for each variable in each domain and used to define the 
appropriate search ellipses (Table 16.26).

16.27 BLOCK MODEL 
 
An orthogonal block model was established across the property (Table 16.27), consisting of 
separate models for estimated grades, percent, density and classification attributes and a 
calculated Au-equivalent ("AuEq") grade. Separate rock code models were also defined for the 
Au domains and the Cu domains.A percent block model was used to accurately represent the 
volume and tonnage that was contained within the constraining mineralization halo. As a result, 
the mineral resource boundary was properly represented by the percent model's capacity to 
measure infinitely variable inclusion percentages.

16.28 ESTIMATION AND CLASSIFICATION 
 
Ordinary Kriging ("OK") of capped composite values was used for the estimation of block 
grades. Block discretization was set at 5x5x2 to reflect the selected block size. 
 
A three-pass series of expanding search spheres with varying minimum sample requirements 
were used for sample selection, estimation and classification.Composite data used during 
estimation were restricted to samples located in their respective domains. Individual block 
grades were then used to calculate a Au-equivalent block model.

During the first pass, seven to twelve composites from three or more drillholes within a search 
sphere 70m in diameter were required for estimation. All blocks estimated during the first pass 
were classified as Measured. 
 
During the second pass, seven to twelve composites from three or more drillholes within a search 
sphere 140m in diameter were required for estimation. All blocks estimated during the second 
pass were classified as Indicated. 
 
During the third pass, three to twelve composites from one or more drillholes within a search 
sphere 280m in diameter were required for estimation. All blocks estimated during the third pass 
were classified as Inferred. 
 
16.29 RHENIUM MODEL 
 
Silver Standard assayed a sub-set of the stored pulps for rhenium. P&E did not monitor or 
observe the re-sampling, and all data were provided by Silver Standard.The Re assay data were 
composited to 1.5 m intervals, creating7,724 recordsco-located with Mo and displaying a high 
degree of correlation with Mo (Figure 16.6). 
 
Figure 16.6 Co-located Re and Mo composite correlation graph 
 

 
 
In order to include rhenium in the mineral resource model, co-kriging of Recomposite data was 
used based on the observed correlation between Mo and Re.Summary statistics for the Re assay 
and composite data indicate that the compositing process did not introduce a significant bias

(Table 16.28).Experimental semi-variograms were derived for the total Mo composite data set, 
the co-located composite data sets for Mo and Re, and a cross-variogram for Re x Mo (Table 
16.29).

Re block grades relative to the total uncapped Mo composite data set and the co-located 
uncapped Re composite data set were estimated using the Stanford University GSLIB 
algorithms. As a check of the validity of the model, Re block grades were compared to blocks 
estimated using only the co-located data sets, as well as with a Nearest Neighbor model. No 
significant discrepancies were noted between the Re model results. 
 
16.30 SNOWFIELD MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
In order to ensure that the reported mineral resources meet the CIM requirement for "reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction" a conceptual Lerchs-Grossman optimized pit shell was 
developed based on all available mineral resources (Measured, Indicated and Inferred), using the 
economic parameters listed in Table 16.30. Commodity prices are based on the three-year 
trailing average as of 31 December 2010.The results from the optimized pit-shell are used solely 
for the purpose of reporting mineral resources that have reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction.

(1) Mineral resources for the February 2011 estimate are defined within a Whittle optimized pit shell that 
incorporates project metal recoveries, estimated operating costs and metals price assumptions. Parameters used in 
the estimate include metals prices (and respective recoveries) of US$1,025/oz. gold (71%), US$16.60/oz. silver 
(70%), US$3/lb. copper (70%), US$19/lb. molybdenum (60%) and rhenium US$145/oz (60%). The pit optimization 
utilized the following cost parameters: Mining US$1.75/tonne, Processing US$6.10/tonne and G&A US$0.90/tonne 
along with pit slopes of 45 degrees. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated 
economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, 
legal, marketing, or other relevant issues. The mineral resources in this news release were estimated using the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted 
by CIM Council. 
(2) The quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has 
been insufficient exploration to define these Inferred resources as an Indicated or Measured mineral resource and it 
is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to an Indicated or Measured mineral resource 
category. 
(3) Contained metal may differ due to rounding. "Moly" refers to molybdenum. "Rhen" refers to rhenium. 
 
Grade and tonnage estimates within the 0.3 grams of gold equivalent per tonne optimized pit 
shell at a cut-off grade of 0.5 grams of gold-equivalent per tonne contain 25.2 million ounces of 
Measured and Indicated gold resources and 6.8 million ounces of Inferred gold resources (Table 
16.32).

16.31 VALIDATION 
 
The block model was validated visually by the inspection of successive section lines in order to 
confirm that the block model correctly reflects the distribution of high-grade and low-grade 
samples. A validation check of the mineral resource estimate was completed by comparing 
average composite grades within a block to the average grade of the blocks containing the 
composites (Table 16.34). The observed differences in grades suggest a minimal conditional 
bias, and are deemed acceptable for mineral resource estimation. 
 
An additional validation check for global bias was also completed by comparing the OK block 
model estimates to a Nearest Neighbour block model estimate generated using the same search 
criteria and tabulated at a zero cut-off (Figure 16.7).Results demonstrated a minimal global bias 
and slight smoothing for the OK estimate as compared to the NN estimate, and correctly 
duplicate grade trends.

17.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
17.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
A Preliminary Assessment of the Snowfield-Brucejack Project was carried out by Wardrop in a 
report titled "Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment of the Snowfield-Brucejack Project" 
with an effective date of October 10, 2010. 
 
The Wardrop (2010) Preliminary Assessment of the Snowfield-Brucejack Project was based on 
the P&E Snowfield Mineral Resource Estimate dated July 27, 2010 and the P&E Brucejack 
Mineral Resource Estimate dated Dec. 1, 2009. The following is a brief summary of the Wardrop 
(2010) PA report. 
 
17.2 SNOWFIELD AND BRUCEJACK RESOURCES 
 
The Snowfield Mineral Resources, as shown in Table 17.1 below, were tabulated against a 
0.30 g/t Au-Eq cut-off, as constrained within the optimized pit shell. Gold, silver, copper, and 
molybdenum block grades were estimated using ordinary kriging (OK) of capped composite 
values. Rhenium block grades were estimated using co-kriging based on the observed correlation 
between molybdenum and rhenium. 
 
All Snowfield Mineral Resources were tabulated against a 0.30 g/t Au-Eq cut-off, as constrained 
within the optimized pit shell.Gold, silver, copper, and molybdenum block grades were estimated

17.3 MINING OPERATIONS 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack Project will be an open pit operation with a 27-year mine life and a 
total of 1,172 Mt of mineralization.Mining will be undertaken using 45 m3 electric cable 
shovels, 39 m3 diesel hydraulic shovels, 311 mm blasthole drills, and 363 t haul trucks with 
related support equipment over the life of the mine.Benches are planned to be 15 m in height and 
double benched to a total vertical height of 30 m between catch benches for the final pit. 
 
At Snowfield, the mineralized material and waste material will be mined in 15 m benches.A 
double-bench configuration was assumed for the final pit walls, resulting in 30 m vertical height 
between catch benches.At Brucejack, the mining configuration is dependent upon the size of 
each final pit.The smaller pits are mined in 10 m benches with 20 m between catch benches.Pits 
deeper than 200 m are mined as per Snowfield. 
 
Benches will be drilled on an 8.9 m x 10.2 m drill pattern to a depth of 16.8 m, including sub-
drill.All blast holes will be sampled and assayed.The holes will be loaded and shot with a 
combination of ANFO and emulsion. 
 
Assay analyses will provide grade control for mineralization.Primary crushers will be located at 
the Snowfield and Brucejack pits, which will shorten haul distances of the crushed materials. 
The scoping-level mine plan will be implemented by mining high net smelter return (NSR) value 
material during the early years of production.The mining of low NSR value material will be 
deferred to the later years of mine operations as per the optimized production schedule 
 
17.4 METALLURGICAL TESTWORK REVIEW 
 
Preliminary metallurgical testwork, including locked cycle tests, was carried out on Snowfield 
mineralization and Brucejack mineralization separately.The testing programs investigated 
mineralization characteristics and potential process technologies for the recovery of valuable 
elements from the two deposits and also determined some of process related data.The testwork 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 127 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

was focused on the zone composite samples; however, the testwork was also conducted on the 
sub-zone samples or drill interval samples.The testwork results show:  
 

• A combination of flotation and cyanidation can be used to recover gold, copper, 
silver, and molybdenum from the Snowfield mineralization.Gold recovery by 
gravity concentration from the reground rougher and scavenger concentrates may 
benefit downstream leaching process.It appears that rhenium can be recovered 
together with molybdenum into molybdenum concentrate. 

• A combination of flotation, gravity concentration, and cyanidation can be used to 
recover gold and silver from the Brucejack mineralization. 

 
The grindability test results showed that the mineralization is moderately hard, with an average 
Bond ball mill work index of approximately 16.0 kWh/t for both deposits.Further testwork is 
recommended to optimize the flotation, gravity, and cyanidation flowsheet. 
 
17.5 MINERAL PROCESSING 
 
The proposed concentrator will process the gold/copper/molybdenum mineralization from the 
Snowfield deposit and the gold-silver mineralization from the Brucejack deposit.The 
concentrator will be fed at a nominal rate of 120,000 t/d and with an availability of 92% 
(365 d/a).The feed materials from the two deposits will be processed separately in different time 
periods according to the mining schedule.The concentrator will produce: 
 

• A marketable copper concentrate containing gold and silver, a by-product 
molybdenum concentrate, and gold-silver doré from the Snowfield mineralization 

• A gold-silver doré only from the Brucejack mineralization. 
 
The process plant will consist of three stages of crushing, primary grinding, followed by flotation 
processes to recover copper, gold, silver, and molybdenum from the Snowfield material, or gold 
and silver only from the Brucejack material.The resulting bulk rougher/scavenger concentrates 
will be reground and gravity concentrated to recover free metallic gold. 
 
Due to a difference in the mineralization, the downstream processes for the Snowfield 
mineralization and Brucejack mineralization are slightly different: 
 

• For the Snowfield mineralization: a copper-gold-silver and molybdenum bulk 
cleaner flotation for the reground rougher concentrate and a copper-molybdenum 
separation circuit are proposed to produce a molybdenum concentrate and a 
copper concentrate containing gold and silver.The cleaner flotation tailing 
together with the reground rougher/scavenger concentrate will be cyanide leached 
to recover gold and silver.The recovered gold and silver will be refined on site to 
gold-silver doré.If gravity concentration is in operation, the gravity concentrate 
will be processed in an intensive leach circuit to recover gold and silver.  

• For the Brucejack mineralization: a conventional cyanidation will be used to leach 
the reground rougher and scavenger concentrates (after gravity concentration) to 
recover gold and silver and an intensive leach to recover gold and silver from the 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 128 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

gravity concentrate.The recovered gold and silver will be refined on site to gold-
silver doré. 

 
The copper-gold concentrate from Snowfield mineralization will be thickened, filtered, and sent 
to the concentrate stockpile.The molybdenum concentrate will be thickened, filtered, dried, and 
bagged.Both concentrates will be stored in the plant prior to subsequent shipping to smelters. 
 
There will be two separate primary crushing systems for the Snowfield site and the Brucejack 
site.Primary crushing at the Snowfield site will include two fixed gyratory crushers while two 
semi-mobile gyratory crushers will be installed at Brucejack site.Crushed material from the 
Snowfield site will be conveyed to the plant site via the main tunnel conveying system in a 
26 km-long tunnel (main tunnel).Crushed material from the Brucejack site will be conveyed to 
the transfer point within the main tunnel.The crushed Brucejack mineralization will be 
transferred onto the main tunnel conveying system at the transfer point. 
 
Secondary crushing by four cone crushers and tertiary crushing by four high pressure grinding 
rolls (HPGR) will be located at plant site to reduce the mill feed to a particle size suitable for ball 
mill milling.The crushed material will be further reduced to 80% passing 125 µm prior to the 
metal recovery by flotation, gravity concentration, and leaching. 
 
The final flotation tailings and leach residues will be transferred to and stored in a conventional 
tailings impoundment.  
 
17.6 TAILINGS AND WASTE MANAGEMENT 
 
All tailings will be contained within the Scott Creek Valley, located approximately 30 km east of 
the pits.A tailings storage facility (TSF) was designed in this valley to contain 1,172 Mt of 
tailings based on a mill throughput of 120,000 t/d for the 27-year mine life.During the life-of-
mine (LOM), tailings will be deposited within the valley and retained by four cross-valley 
tailings dams to be constructed over the mine life.A 177 m high starter dam will be constructed 
initially at the south end of the impoundment and raised in stages to an approximate height of 
300 m above centreline.The three additional dams must be constructed at the northern end of the 
impoundment during operations to provide containment. 
 
In addition to the tailings dams, the following auxiliary structures will be required for the TSF: 
 

• Spillways – a series of spillways on the right abutment will be constructed over 
the LOM to protect the integrity of the main tailings dam. 

• Operations Diversion Channels – diversion channels will be constructed above the 
west and east sides of the ultimate tailings pond to divert non-contact water 
around the impoundment during the LOM. 

• Seepage Recovery Facilities – seepage recovery systems will be constructed at the 
toe of each dam to collect potential seepage out of the dam.  

• Construction Diversion Tunnel – a diversion tunnel through the right abutment of 
the main starter tailings dam is required to convey flows from Scott Creek around 
the starter dam footprint during its construction.  

 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 129 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

Approximately 544 Mt of waste will be stripped at the Snowfield pit over the LOM, and hauled 
to two potential waste dumps. Approximately 645 Mt of waste will be stripped at the Brucejack 
pits over the LOM.Waste rock segregation is assumed to be accomplished depending on the 
potential of the rock to generate acid and other metals.For the PAG waste dump, steps will be 
implemented to divert groundwater and surface run-off away from the dump. 
 
17.7 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
An initial review of environmental conditions and planned project features indicates that 
proactive design and mitigation can successfully address environmental impacts associated with 
developing, operating, and closing the proposed Snowfield-Brucejack project.  
 
As with other projects in the northern Coast Range of BC, water management is a key issue.A 
suitable location at the Scott Creek valley, with a reasonably small catchment for the tailings 
storage facility, greatly aids in water management.Diversion channels upslope of the TSF will 
divert most natural run-off flows around the main dam. 
 
Drainage originating from waste rock, dewatering wells, and the pits will be piped through the 
access tunnel to the process plant near the TSF.This flow will eventually report to the TSF either 
directly as liquid or indirectly contained within the tailings slurry. 
 
Discharge from the TSF during operations will be accomplished with a floating decant 
structure.Installed floating clarifiers will be utilized if suspended solids concentrations are in 
excess of the mandated value.It is not anticipated that additional water treatment will be required.  
 
Upon closure, the pits will be flooded and excess water will be pumped to the TSF via the 
tunnel.The diversion channels at the TSF will be breached and discharge will be via a 
spillway.Protection of stream water quality and fisheries will be a key guiding principle from the 
earliest planning stages through closure. 
 
Throughout the project, the owner will strive to involve first nations in environmental plans to 
gain from their knowledge of the region, as well as to keep them informed of project goals. 
 
17.8 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The Snowfield-Brucejack site will be accessible by a planned permanent road constructed 
between a junction with Highway 37 and the plant site.Highway 37, a major road access to 
northern BC, passes approximately 24 km from the Snowfield-Brucejack Project plant site 
(Figure 17.1). 
 
The plant site is located 26 km east of the open pits area.Twin tunnels constructed with crosscuts 
will connect the plant site and the mine sites.One of the tunnels will be used for conveying the 
crushed material from the mine sites to the 30,000 t live capacity coarse stockpile at the plant 
site, and the second tunnel will provide a year-round access to the mine sites for the transport of 
the materials and workers.

At the Snowfield and Brucejack mine sites, two crushing facilities each housing two 60′ x 89′ 
gyratory crushers (fixed crushing station at the Snowfield site and semi-mobile crushing station 
at the Brucejack site) will be designed to crush the mineralization materials from the proposed 
mine.  
 
The plant site area will consist of the following facilities: 
 

• 30,000 t live coarse material stockpile (covered) and reclaim; 
• Secondary crushing; 
• 120,000 t fine material stockpile (covered) and reclaim; 
• Tertiary crushing; 
• Primary grinding and classification, flotation and regrinding; 
• Cyanide leaching and gold recovery; 
• Concentrate dewatering and handling; 
• Maintenance building; 
• Maintenance shop and warehouse; 
• Water services. 

 
The TSF is located approximately 5 km south of the mill site within the Scott Creek Valley. 
 
17.9 POWER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION 
 
Electrical power will be supplied from the proposed new Northwest Transmission Line 
(NTL).The NTL will be a 287 kV line running between Terrace and Bob Quinn Lake, a distance 
of approximately 335 km.The line to Snowfield-Brucejack Project from the Bell II substation 
will be approximately 45 km long, and terminate at a distribution substation at the Snowfield-
Brucejack plant site. 
 
There will be four main transformers feeding the plant site.The transformers will be sized to 
allow the plant to run with one transformer out of service. 
 
Power will be distributed around the sites using cables and overhead lines, at 25 kV and 
additional step-down transformers will be located near remaining loads. 
 
Two additional transformers will be provided at the Snowfield-Brucejack substation to step back 
up to 69 kV.This will be a suitable voltage to feed via cable through the tunnel to the pits, where 
it will be further stepped down to 25 kV, 4 kV and 600 V to feed shovels, drills, and the primary 
crushers. 
 
The tunnel conveyors will be fed from 25 kV cables from at each end of the tunnel.As this is a 
downhill conveyor, the conveyor drives will be arranged to serve as generators, generating up to 
3 MW to 4 MW of power.

18.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
18.1 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The current, updated resources on the Brucejack portion of the Project were derived from 
modeling nine zones and subsequently defining resources in optimized pits at 0.30 g/t AuEq cut-
off, 3.0 g/t AuEq cut-off and 5.0 g/t AuEq cut-off. The resources are defined within Whittle 
optimized pit shells that incorporate project metal recoveries, estimated operating costs and 
metals price assumptions. 
 
The current, updated resources on the Snowfield portion of the Project were derived from 
modeling the main Snowfield deposit and subsequently defining resources in optimized pits at 
0.30 g/t AuEq cut-off, 0.5 g/t AuEq cut-off and 1.5 g/t AuEq cut-off. The resources are defined 
within Whittle optimized pit shells that incorporate project metal recoveries, estimated operating 
costs and metals price assumptions.  
 
A positive Preliminary Assessment ("PA") for the Snowfield-Brucejack Project was delivered by 
Wardrop Engineering in October 2010, and was based on information up to the end of 2009. The 
drilling completed at the Project in 2010 allowed Pretivm to redefine resources based on lower 
cut-off grades.  
 
The PA recommended continuing with a pre-feasibility study at Snowfield.  
 
A new PA will be required at Brucejack however, in order to examine the economics of a higher 
grade mining operation there. 
 
18.2 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
For Snowfield it is recommended, based on the current updated resource estimate, to undertake 
the following: 
 

• Continue with engineering, environmental and metallurgical studies toward 
fulfilling the requirements for the pre-feasibility study; 

• Complete approximately 10,000 metres of diamond drilling in the recently 
outlined high grade copper zone in the south-eastern part of the deposit with the 
goal of expanding the zone.  

 
This work should be undertaken simultaneously at an approximate cost of $4 M. 
 
It is recommended, based on the current updated resource estimate, to undertake the following at 
Brucejack: 
 

• Complete a new PA, which examines the economics of a higher grade mining 
operation in the West Zone and VOK Zone; 

• Complete approximately 50,000 metres of diamond drilling in the known areas of 
high grade mineralization with the intention of : 
• Tightening the drill spacing to increase the levels of confidence to move 

Inferred resources into the Measured and Indicated categories and to 



 

P&E Mining Consultants Inc. Page 137 of 162 
Pretium Resources Inc. Snowfield-Brucejack Project Report No. 212 

improve knowledge of the continuity of the high grade mineralization for 
the VOK and other high-grade zones; 

• Testing the high-grade mineralization to depths greater than the current 
650 metres; 

• Following up on a number of high-grade intercepts encountered in the 
2009 and 2010 drill programs that are not sufficiently defined to be 
included in the high-grade resource. 

• Continue with the metallurgical work initiated prior to the PA; 
• Continue with the environmental work initiated prior to the PA. 

 
This work should all be undertaken simultaneously at an approximate cost of $16 M.
