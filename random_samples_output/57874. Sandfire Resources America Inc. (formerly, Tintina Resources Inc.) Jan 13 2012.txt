1.0 SUMMARY 

 
1.1 Location 

 
The Black Butte property, formerly called the "Sheep Creek" property, is located in 

Meagher County, Montana, U.S.A., about 20 miles north of the town of White Sulphur 
Springs.  The property is accessed by 1.5 miles of well maintained county graveled road 
which branches off from U.S. Highway 89, an all-weather state-maintained highway.  U.S. 
Highway 89 connects the property area with White Sulphur Springs, Montana, which has a 
population of approximately 984 residents.  Elevations in the resource area range from 
5,600 to 6,000 feet above sea level and the topography consists of gently rolling hills and 
valleys.  Timber cover consists primarily of Douglas fir on north facing slopes and grass 
and mountain sagebrush covered valley floors and draws (drainages) and open to partly 
timbered ridge tops.  Timber covers approximately 10% of the resource area. 

 
1.2 Land Status 

 
Tintina Alaska Exploration Inc. (Tintina), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tintina 

Resources Inc., controls the property, which consists of three leased tracts of fee-simple 
lands totaling 7,684.28 acres and 239 unpatented lode mining claims which are located on 
U.S. Forest Service lands totaling approximately 4541 acres.  The project is located in 
portions of Township 11 North, Range 5 East, Township 11 North, Range 6 East, 
Township 11 North, Range 7 East, Township 12 North, Range 6 East, and Township 12 
North, Range 7E.  The three fee simple tracts are held via lease agreements which 
stipulate an escalating schedule of advance minimum royalty payments.  The lessors also 
retain net smelter royalties (NSR) with buy-back provisions. 

 
There are no recognized significant environmental liabilities on the property.  Sheep 

Creek, a pristine mountain stream prized for stock water and for trout fishing flows through 
a portion of the Black Butte Copper Project area.  Any proposed mine development on the 
Black Butte Copper Project must be carried out in such a way as to protect the integrity of 
the Sheep Creek waterway.  Permitting for exploration and development drilling is granted 
by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, and the necessary permits for such 
drilling have been granted to the company. 

 
1.3 History 

 
According to Weed (1899) local hay ranchers located claims on copper-stained 

quartzite at the Virginia Mine and by 1894 had a 70 foot shaft with a 30 foot drift, but not 
much copper mineralization was exposed.  In 1910, a homesteader, Johnny Lee, sank a 
short shaft on cupriferous gossan along the Volcano Valley fault in the same area.  
Presumably, all of the workings were too shallow to penetrate below surface oxidation and 
encounter any sulfide.  This location is approximately 500 meters west of the present 
resource area.

During the first half of the 20th century, interest focused on extensive gossans 

developed on Iron Butte area and between Butte Creek and Sheep Creek (Goodspeed, 
1945; Roby, 1950).  This work resulted in surveying and patenting of a number of patented 
claims, both inside and adjacent to the Tintina lease area.  Work focused on the iron 
potential, and while prospectors dug a few prospect pits and drove a few small adits, no 
workings penetrated the redox boundary into sulfide-bearing rock.   

 
Cominco American Inc. (CAI) carried out the first modern exploration work on the 

property.  Exxon Minerals obtained a lease in 1981 and joint ventured it to CAI in late 
1984.  CAI joint ventured the entire property to Utah International Inc. (UII) in 1985, and UII 
was subsequently taken over by BHP.  UII/BHP operated the joint venture through early 
1988 and earned a 50% interest in the project, at which time operatorship reverted back to 
CAI.  Within the next two years, CAI purchased BHP's interest in the property and 
regained 100% control with no retained royalties or back-in rights.  CAI dropped the leases 
in the mid-1990's.  Approximately 66 diamond core holes were completed in the two lease 
areas by CAI and the CAI/BHP joint venture.   

 
1.4 Geologic Setting 

 
The Cu-Co deposits within the Black Butte Copper Project area occur in middle 

Proterozoic sediments of the Belt Supergroup which are extensively exposed in an 
eastward protrusion of the Rocky Mountain chain called the Helena salient in central 
Montana (Zieg and Leitch, 1993).  During formation of the Belt Basin, a deep water middle 
Proterozoic calcareous shale facies (Newland Formation) deposited in an embayment, 
known as the Helena embayment, which extended in trough-like fashion east into the 
craton through central Montana (Godlewski and Zieg, 1984).  The northern boundary of the 
deeper water portion of the Helena embayment lay along the southern flank of the Little 
Belt Mountains north of White Sulphur Springs, Montana.  During the Cretaceous 
Laramide orogeny, renewed faulting along the ancestral northern margin of the Helena 
embayment formed the Volcano Valley thrust fault (Winston, 1986).   The bedded massive 
sulfides of Black Butte are concentrated along the northern margin of the Helena 
embayment along the Volcano Valley fault zone 

 
The Newland Shale hosts the Black Butte massive sulfide deposits, and consists of 

a lower shale-dominated part which measures approximately 760 meters thick and an 
upper carbonate-dominated part which measures approximately 350 meters thick.  The 
shale is even laminated and was deposited as microturbidites in a sub-wavebase 
depositional setting.  Debris flow conglomerates punctuate the section along the northern 
margin of the embayment.  Though in places the lower Newland shale shows ubiquitous 
bedded pyrite throughout, more typically sulfides are concentrated in several discrete 
stratigraphic horizons of greater lateral extent.

1.5 Deposit Type 

 
The Black Butte bedded sulfide accumulations best fit a shale-hosted massive 

sulfide deposit type model.  The host rocks contain no volcanic component and in terms of 
setting and geometry, the sulfide occurrences are quite similar to typical Proterozoic and 
Phanerozoic shale-hosted Zn and Pb rich deposits.   However, the high concentrations of 
copper, cobalt, and barium are unusual in shale hosted sulfide occurrences. Mt. Isa 
(Perkins, 1984) and Walford Creek (Rohrlach, et. al. 1998) in Australia make reasonable 
analogies (Zieg, 1992).  Most geologists interpret the genesis of the Black Butte sulfides as 
having formed at sysnsedimentary hydrothermal vents sites during deposition of the host 
shale.  Sulfides are involved in soft sediment folding, and sulfide accumulations include 
evidence of vent biota grown over subaqueous hydrothermal hot springs.  These are 
intricate growths of tubes interpreted as having formed around algal or bacterial filaments 
and are most abundant with greater sulfide accumulations (McGoldrick and Zieg, 2004) 

 
The Black Butte exploration model is a middle Proterozoic synsedimentary 

subaqeous hydrothermal vent field developed at structural intersections during prolonged 
synsedimentary extensional faulting along the northern margin of the Helena embayment. 

 
1.6 Mineralization 

 
The focus of this report is on copper-cobalt mineralization hosted in calcareous 

shale of the lower Newland Formation within bedded sulfide horizons referred to as the 
Johnny Lee deposit.  Mineralization within the Johnny Lee deposit is referred to as the 
"Upper Copper Zone" (UCZ) and the "Lower Copper Zone" (LCZ).  Those zones of copper-
cobalt mineralization are located within broader stratabound sulfide accumulations 
(primarily pyrite) that are referred to as the "Upper Sulfide Zone" (USZ) and "Lower Sulfide 
Zone" (LSZ).  The Upper and Lower Sulfide Zone descriptions are still being used by 
Tintina staff members to define the thick bedded sulfide accumulations.  The Johnny Lee 
deposits consisting of the UCZ and LCZ assemblages are contained within the broader 
sulfide packages.  

 
In the Black Butte area north of the Black Butte Fault, four separate lenses of 

massive sulfide occur along this stratigraphic horizon and are separated by conglomerate 
lenses or cut into separate structural blocks by northeast trending, down to the southeast 
normal faults.  The USZ consists of a lens of fine grained bedded pyrite up to 55 meters 
thick containing up to three chalcopyrite-bearing horizons. Microscopic textures and 
species of sulfide minerals, primarily from copper-enriched horizons, have been well 
described by Himes and Petersen (1990). Pyrite occurs as laminations and beds of very 
fine grained pyrite as microcrystals and spheroidal aggregates as small as 1 micron and 
up to 25 or more microns in diameter. Some coarse euhedral pyrite clearly grew much 
later than fine grained pyrite varieties.  Pyrite and sometimes marcasite aggregates 
contain rims, patches, and sometimes cores of chalcopyrite and tennantite, and in many 
cases amorphous CuCoNiAs-rich material. Pyrite grain rims contain enrichments of Cu, Ni,

As, and Co. Chalcopyrite occurs as coarser grained veinlets and clots, in bedding parallel 
layers and bands, in quartz veinlets, and in barite veins and masses. In the southern part 
of the Johnny Lee USZ, copper zones can contain bornite as well as chalcopyrite. Bornite 
appears in small amounts and is locally important. Cobalt minerals remain unidentified, but 
are probably cobaltite or glaucodot.  Coarse grained barite occurs both intergrown with and 
often crosscutting pyrite. In a prevalent gangue-sulfide replacive texture, pyrite or 
chalcopyrite form one to five millimeter rims on rounded masses of gangue up to one 
centimeter across. Masses of this texture generally follow bedding and in some places 
crosscut pyrite beds.  Gangue mineralogy associated with such textures in the upper 
sulfide zone is usually barite; in other sulfide zones the gangue minerals are dolomite, 
calcite, or fine grained quartz. The upper part of the Johnny Lee USZ shows high 
concentrations of coarse grained barite.   

 
While local silicification occurs within the Cu-mineralized stratigraphy, most of the 

Cu-Co mineralization occurs within unsilicified to weakly silicified bedded pyrite.  Better 
grades are associated with barite-chalcopyrite veins and masses of intergrown pyrite, 
barite, and chalcopyrite that replace and crosscut the bedded sulfide. 

 
1.7 Project Status 

 
Since the latter part of 2010, Tintina has been conducting confirmation and infill 

drilling campaigns at the Black Butte Copper Project.  Their efforts initially concentrated on 
the Johnny Lee UCZ (first five drill holes) and then began drilling the Johnny Lee LCZ.  
Historic drilling data have provided Tintina personnel with an excellent understanding of 
the geometry of the copper-cobalt mineralization hosted in the Newland Formation.  The 
initial goal of the 2010 drilling program was to confirm the earlier CAI, UII, and BHP drilling 
results by twinning some of the old holes.  The historic drill hole spacing in the vicinity of 
the Johnny Lee USZ and LSZ's was somewhere between 150 to 300 meters.  That initial 
drill hole spacing has been reduced by Tintina's initial 2010 program and substantially by 
their 2011 drilling campaign.  Much of the 2011drilling campaign was devoted towards infill 
drilling of the Johnny Lee UCZ in order to update the estimate of mineral resources which 
is the focus of this report. 

 
Various metallurgical tests have been completed with additional testwork planned to 

help define potential processing scenarios.  A number of environmental studies are in 
progress including baseline data collection.  Stantec-Mining has been reviewing possible 
mining methods of the Johnny Lee UCZ.  All of these studies are anticipated to be 
discussed in a Preliminary Economic Assessment, which is anticipated to be completed 
during the third quarter of 2012. 

 
1.8 Metallurgy 

 
Mr. Arthur H. Winckers, P. Eng. was contracted by Tintina to conduct various 

metallurgical tests to determine the flotation response of a representative composite 
sample from the Johnny Lee UCZ.  The objective of the preliminary metallurgical program 



Black Butte Copper Project 
Meagher County, Montana 

 

 
Resource Modeling Inc. 5 January 13, 2012 
Arthur H. Winckers & Associates   
   

was to develop effective flotation conditions for the recovery of copper and other payable 
metals and to identify potential amenability problems. The testwork was conducted at the 
Metallurgical Division of Inspectorate Exploration and Mining Services Ltd, the analytical 
work by the Inspectorate Analytical Division which has ISO 9001 accreditation and uses 
standard QC and QA procedures. 

 
The samples selected for the testwork are believed to typical but not necessarily 

representative of the massive sulfide mineralization in the Upper Copper Zone of the 
Johnny Lee deposit; a much larger suite of samples taken from the across the 
mineralization in the zone is required to generate representative samples. 

 
The results of these investigations indicated that the Johnny Lee copper-cobalt 

mineralization is very fine grained and complex requiring a primary grind level of 80% 
passing 38micron and a rougher concentrate regrind of 80% passing 8micron for effective 
liberation and recovery of copper minerals to a marketable concentrate. 

 
The recovery of copper from concentrates is based on correlations from locked 

cycle test and is currently estimated to be 81%.  These tests, based on samples with a 
head grade of 2.24% copper, yielded a concentrate grade of 23.3% copper. 

 
The concentrate produced in the locked cycle tests contained very low levels of 

potentially deleterious elements; this provides a preliminary indication that the risk with 
regard to the effect of deleterious elements on the project economics is relatively low.  

 
1.9 Johnny Lee UCZ Mineral Resources 

 
Mr. Mike Lechner, P. Geo. was contracted by Tintina to review all applicable 

geologic and analytical data for the Johnnie Lee UCZ with the goal of estimating potential 
mineral resources.  To that extent, Mr. Lechner used available drill hole data and various 
geologic information to construct a three-dimensional block model.  Wireframes 
representing two copper-rich horizons were constructed by Tintina's technical staff and 
reviewed by Mr. Lechner.  Those wireframes were used to constrain the estimate of block 
copper and cobalt grades. 

 
A bulk density value of 3.93 based on 60 determinations was used to tabulate 

tonnage.  A cutoff grade of 1.6% copper was used to define estimated Indicated Mineral 
Resources of 8,483,000 tonnes with an average grade of 2.96% Cu, 0.12% Co, and 16.9 
g/t Ag.  In addition to the Indicated Resource, there is an estimated Inferred Resource 
containing 1,257,000 tonnes at an average grade of 2.64% copper, 0.10% cobalt, and 16.4 
g/t Ag using a copper cutoff grade of 1.6%.  The cutoff grade was established by using a 
copper price of US$2.75 per pound, a copper recovery of 81%, mining costs of 
US$59/tonne, processing costs of US$16.00/tonne, and G&A costs of US$5.00/tonne.  
The current undiluted Johnny Lee UCZ Indicated Mineral Resources and Inferred Mineral 
Resources are tabulated in Table 1-1 and 1-2, respectively using a copper cutoff grade of 
1.6%.

1.10 Johnny Lee LCZ Mineral Resources 

 
Tintina personnel constructed a three dimensional wireframe which represents a 

single copper-rich horizon within the Johnny Lee LCZ.  Mr. Lechner reviewed and 
confirmed the LCZ wireframe, performed various statistical studies, and estimated 
resources for the LCZ. 

 
A bulk density value of 3.80 based on 17 determinations was used to tabulate 

tonnage.  A cutoff grade of 1.5% copper was used to define an Inferred Mineral Resource 
of 2,462,000 tonnes with an average grade of 4.71% Cu, 0.06% Co, and 5.1 g/t Ag.  The 
cutoff grade was established by using a copper price of US$2.75 per pound, a copper 
recovery of 84%, mining costs of US$50/tonne, processing costs of US$16.00/tonne, G&A 
costs of US$5.00/tonne and refining costs of US$5.53/tonne.  The estimate of undiluted 
LCZ Inferred Mineral Resources is tabulated in Table 1-3.

The Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ Inferred Resources were calculated using copper 

cutoff grades of 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively.  The difference in cutoff grades are due to 
more current mining cost and copper recovery data that have become available since the 
Johnny Lee Inferred Resource was disclosed.

1.12 Conclusions 

 
The copper-cobalt mineralization in the Black Butte area has been recognized since 

the early to mid 1980's.  A significant amount of work was completed by major mining 
companies in developing a geologic model and testing that model with a number of core 
drilling campaigns. 

 
The Black Butte bedded sulfide accumulations best fit a shale-hosted massive 

sulfide deposit type model.  Most geologists interpret the genesis of the Black Butte 
sulfides as having formed at sysnsedimentary hydrothermal vents sites during deposition 
of the host shale.  Sulfides are involved in soft sediment folding, and sulfide accumulations 
include evidence of vent biota grown over subaqueous hydrothermal hot springs.  These 
are mat textures in bedded pyrite and intricate growths of tubes interpreted as having 
formed around microbial filaments and are most abundant with greater sulfide 
accumulations (McGoldrick and Zieg, 2004) 

 
Cominco American Inc. (CAI) developed preliminary "resource" estimates for the 

USZ and LSZ (Cominco American Inc., 1996).  These historic estimates are not 
considered to be compliant with NI 43-101.  CAI ultimately terminated their interest in the 
Black Butte area due to relatively low copper prices (less than US$ 1.00 per pound).  
Historical estimates described in this report have not been included in the Indicated and 
Inferred Resource estimates that are the subject of this report; however, underlying data 
used in the historical estimates have been confirmed by the author and have been 
subsequently used by the author in conjunction with newly acquired drilling information to 
estimate resources.  The author has not done sufficient work to classify the CAI historical 
estimate as current mineral resources and Tintina is not treating the historical estimate as 
current resources.  See Section 12.4 of this report for more information.   

 
Using both historic data and results from Tintina's 2010 and 2011 drilling programs, 

the author has estimated an undiluted Indicated Resource  of about 8.5 million tonnes

grading 2.96% copper for about 553 million contained pounds of copper for the Johnny 
Lee Upper Copper Zone.  In addition, there is an estimated undiluted Inferred Resource of 
about 1.3 million tonnes grading 2.64% copper for about 73 million contained pounds of 
copper for the Johnny Lee UCZ.  A copper cutoff grade of 1.6% was used to summarize 
the updated Johnny Lee Upper Copper Zone resources.  This report also describes 
previously disclosed resources for the Johnny Lee Lower Copper Zone (previously referred 
to as the Lower Copper Zone), which is distinct and separate from the Johnny Lee Upper 
Copper Zone Resource.  Using a copper cutoff grade of 1.5%, the author estimated an 
undiluted Inferred Resource of 2.46 million tonnes grading 4.71% copper for about 256 
million contained pounds of copper for the Johnny Lee Lower Copper Zone (Lechner, 
2011).   

 
1.13 Recommendations 

 
General Recommendations 
 
The author highly recommends that Tintina continue to obtain assay certificates and 

QA/QC data for the Cominco American, Utah International, and BHP drilling campaigns.  It 
is the author's opinion that data collected by these companies is valid.  By obtaining the 
assay certificates a significant portion of the older data could be verified and may minimize 
the amount of additional drilling that will need to be completed by Tintina. 

 
Tintina should continue collecting more bulk density data from unmineralized 

hanging wall material, massive sulfide zones, and unmineralized footwall material.  These 
determinations should be collected for all major rock types that may be mined.  In addition, 
Tintina should obtain confirmatory density determinations should from a certified laboratory 
for all representative rock types.  The costs associated with obtaining confirmatory bulk 
density determinations should not amount to more than US$5,000. 

 
Results from recent metallurgical work suggest the presence of several different ore 

types within the Johnny Lee UCZ.  Tintina's geologic staff should work with their 
metallurgical consultants to determine the characteristics of these possible ore types.  The 
goal should be to see if an ore type model can be constructed given the available data.  
After various ore types have been identified, representative samples (10-15 samples each) 
should be assembled from existing drill core and provided to Tintina's metallurgical team 
for testwork.  The costs for this activity are primarily associated with wages paid to 
Tintina's geologic staff members, although if insufficient core is available additional drilling 
maybe required to obtain sufficient material for testwork. 

 
Eventually Tintina will need a more detailed topographic map for the project area.  

The current surface used by RMI fits the surveyed drill hole collars reasonably well and 
this is not a material issue regarding the Inferred Resources that are the subject of this 
report.  In the author's opinion, a detailed aerial survey and subsequent digital terrain 
model will cost between US$15,000 and US$30,000.

Johnny Lee UCZ 
 
Tintina's should continue working on the Johnny Lee UCZ PEA.  This includes 

estimating mining and processing costs, continuing with metallurgical recovery studies, 
preparing a mine plan from the updated estimate of mineral resources, and continuing with 
ongoing environmental data collection and appropriate permitting activities.  The author is 
unable to estimate the costs for these activities. 

 
Johnny Lee LCZ 
 
In order to see if the current Johnny Lee LCZ Inferred Resources can be upgraded 

to higher confidence limits an infill drilling program must be completed.  A program 
designed to decrease the drill hole spacing in the Johnny Lee LCZ down to 100-meter-
centers is estimated to cost about US$1.8 million. 

 
Strawberry East 
 
Tintina has been drilling in the Strawberry East area during the later stages of the 

2011 drilling campaign.  As mentioned in Section 25, historic drilling in the Strawberry East 
area has identified possible LSZ and MSZ targets.  The data collected from the 2011 
drilling program will need to be evaluated and preliminary models of mineralized horizons 
constructed.  The cost for these interpretative activities is estimated to range between 
US$5,000 and US$10,000.  An estimate of potential mineral resources should be 
completed after all data and interpretative work have been completed.  The estimated cost 
to prepare an estimate of mineral resources is approximately US$15,000 to US$25,000. 

 
Mineral Processing 
 
A mineralogy study of the test feed sample indicated that a finer primary grind may 

be beneficial and should be investigated.  Related to this study, an evaluation should be 
completed to determine whether a split flow sheet could generate a copper pre-
concentrate produced at a coarser primary grind thus reducing the risk of overgrinding 
already liberated copper minerals. 

 
The regrind level in the locked cycle test was 8 microns while the mineralogy data 

suggest that a coarser regrind level may be acceptable but this needs to be confirmed by 
flotation tests. 

 
Testwork should be undertaken to determine if a various reagent alternatives should 

be evaluated to optimize silver and cobalt recoveries. 
 
Various equipment sizing tests need to be performed on representative samples on 

a pilot plant scale.  This will help establish items such as regrind mill power requirements, 
concentrate thickener and filter sizes.

The variability flotation testwork and mineralogy studies showed a significant 

difference in response to various sub-composite samples suggesting the presence of 
different ore types.  A larger suite of metallurgical samples should be collected from across 
the horizontal and vertical extents of the UCZ.  Approximately 10-15 samples from each 
identified ore type should be selected for ongoing testwork. 

 
Various comminution tests should be completed to establish the optimal grinding 

circuit design and to determine the variability in ore hardness across the deposit.  These 
tests would include a SAG mill design using HQ diameter core.  The Verti Mill should also 
be evaluated to see if it could serve as the final grinding stage. 

 
The "Galvanox" process should be evaluated to determine whether it would be 

suited to recovery copper and cobalt from the pyritic copper concentrates.  Using this 
process at the mine to treat a bulk rougher concentrate has the potential to increase the 
overall copper recovery and produce cobalt as a by-product. 

 
The total cost for these metallurgical studies is estimated to be US $710,000.

2.0 INTRODUCTION  

 
This Technical Report has been prepared for Tintina Alaska Exploration Inc. 

(Tintina), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tintina Resources Inc., by Mr. Michael J. Lechner, 
President of Resource Modeling Inc. and Mr. Arthur H. Winckers.  Mr. Winckers is 
responsible for portions of Sections 1, 25, and 26 along with all of Sections 13 and 17.  Mr. 
Lechner is responsible for portions of Sections 1, 25, and 26 and all other Sections.  This 
report discusses various aspects of the Black Butte Copper Project including location, 
history, exploration drilling results, metallurgical testwork, and describes the estimate of 
Mineral Resources for the Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ's. 

  
2.1 Terms of Reference and Purpose 

 
The purpose of this report is to describe the Black Butte Copper Project, discuss 

historic and current exploration work/results and to outline the work carried out by the 
authors in estimating mineral resources for the Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ.  These activities 
have been completed to comply with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the 
TSX Venture Exchange (TSX-V) Corporate Finance Manual and National Instrument 43-
101.  

 
2.2 Sources of Information 

 
RMI obtained electronic copies of drill hole data and various geologic maps/cross 

sections from Tintina personnel.  Tintina was able to obtain a significant amount of the 
historical information from the public domain.  In 1995 Cominco American donated drill 
core, the associated electronic database along with numerous cross sections and other 
geologic data to the University of Montana located in Missoula.  The core is stored in a 
warehouse located at Fort Missoula and is maintained by the Belt Research Center, which 
is associated with the University of Montana Geology Department and currently managed 
by Mr. Don Winston, a retired University of Montana Geology professor. 

 
Tintina provided RMI with assay certificates from their current drilling program.  

They also provided a number of plan maps and cross sections that appear in this report.    
 

2.3 Site Visits 
 
The author has visited the Black Butte Copper Project site on two occasions, the 

first visit was in October 2010 and the second visit occurred in September 2011. 
 
Prior to conducting the first site visit, the author met with Mr. Jerry Zieg, Vice 

President of Exploration for Tintina and examined historical drill core stored in Missoula, 
MT.  High-grade massive sulfide intercepts from historic drill holes SCC-17, SCC-23, and 
SCC-34 were examined.  These were three of the holes that Tintina twinned in 2010.  The 
author notes that the historic core is in various states of condition.  Sulfide horizons,

especially high-grade massive sulfide zones, tend to be well oxidized after 25 years of 
storage.  The core is not well organized but most of core boxes are somewhat in order and 
stored on sturdy racks.  Other "batches" of core still remain on pallets or stacked piles 
throughout the large warehouse facility. 

 
The author conducted his first site visit on October 21, 2010 with Mr. Zieg.  The 

cover photograph of this report was taken from U.S. Highway 89 looking west towards 
Black Butte and Strawberry Butte.  Several key outcrops were examined by the author in 
the vicinity of Strawberry Butte.  Figure 2-1 is a photograph showing silicified gossanous 
USZ in outcrop.  Potential decline and shaft collar sites were reviewed in the field.  The 
author was not able to observe drilling operations due to an equipment break-down, 
although the rig was located on a drill pad (SC10-005) as shown in Figure 2-2.  Each of the 
Tintina drill hole sites were driven to and briefly examined.

The author was able to examine Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ horizons from Tintina 

drill holes SC10-001 (386m to 415m), SC10-002 (429m to 462m), SC10-003 (429m to 
465m and 1136m to 1163m), and SC10-004 (348m to 397m and 1358m to 1376m).  
These intercepts were laid out in a core logging room in a rental house located near the 
project site. 

 
In addition to detailed logging of the Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ intervals, contract 

geologists for Tintina quick logged the remainder of the drill holes and marked out samples 
for sawing and assaying.  Bulk density determinations were completed by the contract 
geologists from select pieces of USZ samples. 

 
The author conducted another site visit on September 20, 2011.  Drill core 

processing procedures were reviewed at Tintina's office complex located in downtown 
White Sulphur Springs, MT.  Several recent core holes were examined which intersected 
the UCZ and LCZ.  Select massive sulfide intervals were examined from holes SC11-029 
(both UCZ and LCZ horizons), SC11-048 (LCZ horizon), and SC11-055 (UCZ).  The 
author compared drill logs and certified assays with the half split sawn core.  Figure 2-3 is 
a photograph showing Tintina's core logging facility located in White Sulphur Springs. 

 
Time was spent with Tintina's staff members reviewing geologic cross sections for 

the Johnny Lee UCZ, LCZ, and Strawberry East zone.  In addition to reviewing 
conventional paper cross sections, the author reviewed three physical sectional models 
that were constructed by Mr. Doyle Albers, a geologic contractor that has been working on 
the Black Butte deposits.  The sectional models were constructed on clear mylar and show 
drill holes, grade histograms, key stratigraphic contacts, sulfide zone contacts, barite 
horizons, and various structures.  These models provide Tintina's geologic staff with an 
excellent three dimensional reference for their various interpretative efforts.

The author visited the project site with Mr. Vince Scartozzi, a Senior Geologist with 

Tintina.  One of three Ruen's drill rigs, a track mounted LF-90, was visited while on site to 
observe drilling operations (hole SC11-085).  Figure 2-4 shows a photograph taken from 
the Strawberry East area looking northward at Tintina's newly constructed core 
storage/core logging facility. 

 
Several potential decline collar locations were examined along with other potential 

infrastructure elements.  A number of reclaimed drill sites (2010 and 2011 drilling 
programs) were observed.  Tintina is to be commended on their concurrent reclamation 
program which appears to be very successful.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

 
The author has not independently verified the legal status or ownership of the 

mineral properties, underlying lease option agreements, and validity of unpatented lode 
claims.  The author is relying on Tintina statements about the validity of the property 
position regarding the content of Section 4. 

 
The author discussed general permitting trends in Montana with Mr. Don ("Fess") 

Foster, an exploration/mining permit specialist located near Whitehall MT.  In particular, 
the author wanted to know if there is any current or proposed legislation that Mr. Foster is 
aware of that could affect the Black Butte Copper Project.  Mr. Foster did not know of any 
permitting issues that would prohibit or hinder the Black Butte Copper Project.  This 
reliance pertains to Section 20 of this report.

Tintina's land holdings are located in sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, and 

36, Township 12 North, Range 6 East, sections 19, 29, 30, 31, and 32, Township 12 North, 
Range 7 East, sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, and 13 Township 11 North, Range 6 
East, sections 5, 6, 7, 8, and 18 Township 11 North, Range 7 East, and section 1 and 12, 
Township 11 North, Range 5 East. 

 
The property consists of three tracts of fee-simple lands totaling 7684.28 acres and 

239 unpatented lode mining claims on U.S. Forest Service lands totaling approximately 
4541 acres.  For Tract 1 (so named for purposes of this description only) the Bar Z Ranch 
controls 100% surface and three members of the Hanson family share equal interest in 
100% of the mineral interest.  For Tract 2 Rose Holmstrom, a local rancher, controls 100% 
surface and 100% minerals.  For Tract 3, Steve Buckingham, a local rancher, controls 
100% surface and shares equal interest in the minerals with two siblings.  The 56 mining 
claims (named the SB claims) were staked by Tintina Alaska Exploration Inc., a wholly 
owned subsidiary of TintinaGold Resources, Inc. in November of 2010 for a total of 
approximately 1064 acres.   An additional 183 BSP claims were staked by Tintina Alaska 
Exploration Inc. in the spring of 2011 and total approximately 3477 acres.   

 
Tract 1, for which Tintina has one surface lease and three mineral leases, consists 

of 2594.28 acres of surface 100% owned by Bar Z Ranch, and includes the surface over 
2555 mineral acres covered by three mining leases with the Hanson family, each of whom 
own 1/3 of the mineral interest.  The additional 39.28 acres covered by the surface lease 
consists of two patented mining claims, the Copper Hill (Mineral Survey #10311) and Rio 
Tinto (Mineral Survey #10304).  The mineral rights for these two claims are owned by 
another party with whom Tintina has no agreement.  The surface lease requires lease 
payments of $50,000 on signing (May 2, 2010) and on each of the first four anniversary 
dates.   Payments on the fifth anniversary data and each anniversary data thereafter are 
$75,000.   

 
Each of the three mining leases for Tract 1 requires advance minimum royalty 

payments of $16,150 on signing (May 2, 2010) and on the first and second anniversaries; 
$32,300 on the third anniversary; $48,450 on the fourth anniversary; and $64,600 on each 
anniversary thereafter through the term of the lease.  The term is for 30 years and is 
renewable for subsequent periods of 10 years each.  The combined mineral interest has 
an NSR of 5%, with an option to buy this down to a 2% NSR for $5,000,000, thereby 
reducing each mineral lessors royalty to 0.6666% NSR in return for a payment of 
$1,666,666. Exercising the buy down option eliminates further advance minimum royalty 
payments. 

 
Tract 2 consists of 2120 acres and is subject to a single mining lease with Mrs. 

Rose I. Holmstrom for 100% surface and 100% mineral interest.  The agreement requires 
advance minimum royalty payments of $40,195 on signing (May 2, 2010) and on the first 
and second anniversaries; $80,411 on the third anniversary; $120,607 on the fourth 
anniversary; and $160,802 on each anniversary thereafter through the term of the lease.

The term is for 30 years and is renewable for subsequent periods of 10 years each.  The 
agreement has a 5% NSR with an option to buy this down to a 2% NSR for $5,000,000. 

 
Tract 3 consists of 2970 acres and is subject to a single mining lease with Mr. Steve 

Buckingham, 100% surface owner and 1/3 mineral owner, and his two siblings, Kathy 
Johnston and Marilyn Bodell, each 1/3 mineral owners.  The agreement requires advance 
minimum royalty payments of $5,000 on signing; $15,000 on or before six months after 
singing, $20,000 on or before the first and second anniversaries; $25,000 on or before the 
third through fifth anniversaries; $30,000 on or before the sixth through eighth 
anniversaries; $35,000 on or before the ninth through eleventh anniversaries; $40,000 on 
or before the twelfth through fourteenth anniversaries; and $50,000 per annum through the 
remainder of the lease term or until Commercial production.  The agreement has a term of 
30 years and a 5% NSR which can be bought down to 2% NSR for a payment of 
$5,000,000. 

 
The mineral owners warrant that there are no prior or underlying agreements 

encumbering the above described surface and mineral interest.  All agreements stipulate 
underground mining only. 

 
Property boundaries for Tracts 1, 2, and 3 are based on the government surveyed 

meridian, section, township, and range system marked at section corners and some ¼ 
section corners with permanent brass cap markers.  Ranch owners generally align fences 
along property boundaries based on these survey markers.   

 
There are no mine workings on the property.  The location of mineralized zones and 

resources is shown in Figure 4-2.  None of these zones have been developed.

There are no recognized significant environmental liabilities on the property.  Sheep 

Creek is a pristine mountain stream prized for stock water and for trout fishing, and any 
mine development on the properties must be carried out in such a way as to protect the 
integrity of the waterway.  Permitting for exploration and development drilling is granted by 
the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, and the necessary permits for such 
drilling have been granted to the company.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
Elevations in the resource area range from 1,700m to 1,850m above sea level and 

the topography is characterized by gently rolling hills and valleys.  Timber cover consists of 
primarily Douglas fir on north facing slopes and grass and mountain sagebrush covered 
valley floors and draws and open to partly timbered ridge tops.  Timber covers 
approximately 10% of the resource area.   

 
The property is accessed by 2.4km of graveled maintained fair-weather county road 

which branches from U.S. Highway 89, an all-weather state-maintained highway.  U.S. 
Highway 89 connects the property area with White Sulphur Springs, Montana, which lies 
32 km south of the project and has a population approximately 984.  This is the county 
seat of Meagher County which includes the project area and has a population of 1908.  
Along U.S. Highway 89 north of the project area in neighboring Cascade County are the 
communities of Belt, Montana, population 633, which lies 80km distant and has the 
nearest railhead; and Great Falls, Montana, with approximately 56,690 population, 132 km 
distant.  Great Falls has an international airport.   

 
Agriculture drives the local economy, and most agricultural operations specialize in 

cattle ranching but some produce grain.  The region has high quality hunting and fishing 
and some locals have outfitting businesses for both big game and for fishing, including 
some primarily utilizing the Sheep Creek drainage.   The few small logging operations in 
the area must haul logs to mills outside the valley, often for as much as 325 km.  The local 
sawmill closed 25 years ago after a lifespan of about 30 years. 

 
The climate is typical of uplands in central Montana with moderate summers and 

severe winters.  The average daily minimum and maximum January temperatures for 
White Sulphur Springs, elevation 1,609m feet above sea level, are -12 to 0 degrees C; for 
April -2 to 12 degrees C; for July 8 to 27 degrees C; and for October -1 to 14 degrees C.  
Temperature extremes can reach below -50 degrees C in winter and more than 38 
degrees C in summer.  The average annual precipitation at White Sulphur Springs is 
approximately 335mm.  The Black Butte property lies at an elevation of 1,700m to 1,850m 
above sea level, is deeper into the Little Belt Mountains, and has cooler temperatures and 
higher precipitation than White Sulphur Springs.  In spite of the severe winter conditions, 
proximity to the highway and the well kept branch roads make it possible to carry out 
drilling programs on the Black Butte property through the winter.   

 
Power is available from the local grid, and a 100Kv power line passes across U.S. 

Highway 89 16.9km straight line distance north of the project (by road) and 21.7km by 
highway.  Electrical power lines of a scale appropriate for domestic use service the ranch 
buildings on the property.

Water rights for surface water are held by the lessors of the mining leases and this 

water is available for Tintina's use.  Groundwater is abundant, resulting in some artesian 
flows in the Sheep Creek valley.   

 
The leased property has ample room outside the Sheep Creek valley bottom for a 

processing plant, mine waste and tailings, well away from active waterways.   
 
The small population of the local community requires that skilled mining personnel 

must come from other areas.  Because a number of underground mining operations are 
active within the Montana and Idaho region some skilled miners will likely be available.

6.0 HISTORY 

 
The ranch properties covered by the Hanson/Bar Z Ranch (Tract 1), Holmstrom 

(Tract 2) and Buckingham (Tract 3) leases were initially homestead properties and railroad 
lands, consolidated over time into the fee simple tracts now under lease, complete with 
mineral rights.  The same ranching families have controlled each tract throughout all 
exploration activities on them to date.   

 
The date of the first investigations of the Black Butte area (Figure 4-2) for mineral 

potential is unknown, but Weed (1899) notes that Messrs. Weir and Tyler, local hay 
ranchers, located claims on copper-stained quartzite at the Virginia Mine and by 1894 had 
a 70 foot shaft with a 30 foot drift, but not much copper mineralization was exposed.  
Presumably, the workings were too shallow to penetrate below surface oxidation and 
encounter any sulfide.  This location is approximately 500 meters west of the present 
resource area and is on the Holmstrom lease.    A homesteader, John Lee, settled on the 
property (E2SW4 and W2SE4 of section 24, T. 12 N., R. 6 E.) in1906 and continued to 
work on the copper-bearing gossan adjacent to the Volcano Valley Fault.  In 1910, he sunk 
a shaft, likely less than 50 feet in depth, near the area of earlier prospecting and continued 
occasional work on it into the 1920's (Hanson family, personal comm.).  Based on material 
on the dump, he failed to encounter unoxidized sulfide-bearing rock but did encounter 
copper carbonate minerals in hematite-limonite gossan.  The contributions of Mr. Lee have 
been recognized by Tintina by naming the copper bearing horizons in this part of the 
project as the Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ. 

 
During the first half of the twentieth century, interest focused on extensive gossans 

developed on Iron Butte area and between Butte Creek and Black Butte (Goodspeed, 
1945; Roby, 1950).  This work resulted in surveying and patenting of a number of patented 
claims, both inside and adjacent to the Hanson/Bar Z Ranch lease.  Work focused on the 
iron potential, and while prospectors dug a few prospect pits and drove a few small adits, 
no workings penetrated the redox boundary into sulfide-bearing rock.   

 
Cominco American Inc. (CAI) carried out the first modern exploration work on the 

property.  CAI leased Tract 1 and Tract 2 (see section 4) in 1977.  Exxon Minerals leased 
Tract 2 in 1981, and joint ventured it to CAI in late 1984.  CAI joint ventured the entire 
property to Utah International Inc. (UII) in 1985, and UII was subsequently taken over by 
BHP.  UII/BHP operated the joint venture through early 1988 and earned their 50% 
interest, at which time operatorship reverted back to CAI.  Within the next two years, CAI 
purchased BHP's interest in the property and regained 100% control with no retained 
royalties or back-in rights.  CAI dropped the leases in the mid-1990's.  No other companies 
have worked on either Tract.  In total, 38 diamond drill holes were completed on Tract 1 by 
CAI and the CAI/BHP joint venture.   Twenty-eight diamond drill holes and one rotary hole 
were completed on Tract 2 by the same parties.  Two drill holes were completed on Tract 
3.  To our knowledge, no other drilling has been completed on either tract.

The first drill hole in completed in Tract 1/Tract 2, DDH SC-8, was completed on 

Tract 1 in 1981.  DDH SCC-17, the first drill hole to encounter significant copper, was 
drilled on Tract 2 in 1985.  This was the second hole drilled in the CAI/UII joint venture and 
encountered 6.7 meters with 2.8% Cu and 0.19% Co in an upper sulfide zone and 4.3 
meters of 4.1% Cu in a lower sulfide zone.  Following this, an intensive drilling program 
over the next four years further outlined two shallowly dipping stratabound massive sulfide 
zones in what came to be called the Strawberry Butte area (Himes, et. al, 1988).  The 
Upper Sulfide Zone is a shallow, outcropping copper-cobalt-bearing sulfide zone which in 
this area extends from surface to a depth of 175 meters.   The Lower Sulfide Zone is a 
copper-cobalt-bearing sulfide zone which lies at depths between 335 and 430 meters.  
Within each sulfide zone are distinct zones of copper mineralization, described below.   In 
the Strawberry Butte area, the western portion of the east-west trending Lower Sulfide 
Zone underlies the north part of the Upper Sulfide Zone.   

 
Within the Upper Sulfide Zone are the Upper Copper Zone #1 and the Upper 

Copper Zone #2.  In the north end of the Upper Sulfide Zone resource, the Upper Copper 
Zone #1 is coincident with the Upper Sulfide Zone.  Further south, the Upper Copper Zone 
#1 lay at or near the base of the much thicker Upper Sulfide Zone, and Upper Copper 
Zone #2 lay separated from and above the Upper Copper Zone #1 but still within the 
Upper Sulfide Zone.  Upper Copper Zone #2 has a more limited areal extent than Upper 
Copper Zone #1.  An Upper Copper Zone #3 was also encountered and had more limited 
areal extent than Upper Copper Zone #2. 

 
CAI calculated a combined Upper Copper Zone #1 and Upper Copper Zone #2 

resource of 4.5 million tons grading 2.5% Cu and 0.12 % Co (Cominco American Inc., 
1996).  This resource is not compliant with NI 43-101 standards.  The author is not able to 
comment on the relevance and reliability of the historical estimate due to the fact that 
many of the key assumptions, parameters, and methods used to prepare the historical 
estimate were not disclosed and are no longer available.  The historical CAI estimate 
categorized the resource as a "drill indicated possible resource".   This is not a category 
that is recognized by National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 
Project (i.e. Section 1.2).  The author is not able to comment on the "resource" category 
that was mentioned in the historical estimate other than to say that it does not conform to 
current CIM definitions.  The author has not done sufficient work to classify the CAI 
historical estimate as current mineral resources and Tintina is not treating the historical 
estimate as current resources.  The author is unaware of any other more recent estimates 
or other data regarding resource estimates. 

 
Coincident with or toward the base of the Lower Sulfide Zone, CAI and BHP 

outlined a Lower Copper Zone.  It is fault bounded on its north and south margins.  The 
faults converge toward the west, so the Lower Copper Zone broadens toward the east.  
Three holes define a western lobe of the Lower Copper Zone, and six holes define an 
eastern lobe.  No drilling pierces the intervening projection.  CAI calculated a resource of 4 
million tons grading 4% copper in this zone (Cominco American Inc., 1996).  This resource 
is not compliant with NI 43-101 standards.  The author is not able to comment on the

relevance and reliability of the historical estimate due to the fact that many of the key 
assumptions, parameters, and methods used to prepare the historical estimate were not 
disclosed and are no longer available.  The historical CAI estimate categorized the 
resource as a "drill indicated possible resource".   This is not a category that is recognized

The author has not done sufficient work to classify the CAI historical estimate as current 
mineral resources and Tintina is not treating the historical estimate as current resources.  
The author is unaware of any other more recent estimates or other data regarding 
resource estimates.  

 
Exploration drilling also located several other bodies of copper mineralization on 

both Tract 1 and Tract 2.  At Strawberry West in Tract 1, 750 meters west of the 
Strawberry Butte resource area, two holes encountered a copper zone at 453 meters 
depth within massive sulfide of the Upper Sulfide Zone.  Additional sulfide zones were 
found in even stratigraphically higher positions in Strawberry West, but contained no 
appreciable copper.  Tract 3 shows evidence of copper-mineralized gossans on surface in 
outcrop and in soil geochemistry, but the two drill holes completed so far were some 
distance from this and encountered no copper mineralization.  

 
The Strawberry East area lies 1500 meters east and 600 meters south of the east 

end of the Strawberry Butte resource area.  At Strawberry East, drilling encountered 
additional Lower Copper Zone mineralization in Tract 2 in a widely spaced drill pattern of 
nine holes in a 650 meter by 400 meter area. The best intersections in the zone were 4.9 
meters with 4.5% Cu and 0.14% Co in DDH SCC-39 and 7.3 meters with 2.7% Cu and 
0.06% Co in DDH SC-75.  Depths for Lower Copper Zone in this area range from 475 to 
650 meters.  Also in Strawberry East, drilling encountered a thick zone of mineralization 
called the Middle Sulfide Zone which included as much as 52.1 meters of 2.7% Cu and 
0.11% Co from 391.4 to 443.5 meters in DDH SC-80.  Only three additional holes test this 
zone across an area of 300 meters by 200 meters, and the copper mineralization within 
the zone shows considerable grade variability.  A composite interval in SC-87 achieves 
200 meters containing 0.6% Cu.  The Upper Sulfide Zone in Strawberry East showed a 
thin Upper Copper Zone of limited lateral extent (with up to 1.2 meters grading 2.2 % Cu) 
in DDH SC-80.  Drilling also encountered significant mineralization in two stratigraphically 
higher zones, the 0/I zone (12.2 m @ 1.7% C and 0.1% Co in DDH SC-74) and the Ynu II

CAI carried out no further drilling on Tract 1, Tract 2, or Tract 3 after completion of 

DDH SC-89 in spring of 1991.  CAI dropped the property in the mid-1990's.  They donated 
all of the drill core and a basic dataset to the University of Montana.  CAI did not begin any 
engineering or base line environmental work.  They did complete preliminary resource 
calculations (mentioned above) and completed initial metallurgical testing.  These reports 
are proprietary and are not available to us.  There has been no further work on Tract 1, 
Tract 2, or Tract 3 since CAI gave up their lease, and there has been no development

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

 
7.1 Geologic Setting 

 
The Cu-Co deposits of Black Butte Copper Project occur in middle Proterozoic 

sediments of the Belt Supergroup which are extensively exposed in an eastward protrusion 
of the Rocky Mountain chain called the Helena salient in central Montana (Zieg and Leitch, 
1993).  During formation of the Belt Basin, a deep water middle Proterozoic calcareous 
shale facies (Newland Formation) deposited in an embayment, known as the Helena 
embayment, which extended in trough-like fashion east into the craton through central 
Montana (Godlewski and Zieg, 1984).  The northern boundary of the deeper water portion 
of the Helena embayment lay along the southern flank of the Little Belt Mountains north of 
White Sulphur Springs, Montana.  During the Cretaceous Laramide orogeny, renewed 
faulting along the ancestral northern margin of the Helena embayment formed the Volcano 
Valley thrust fault (Winston, 1986).   The bedded massive sulfides of Black Butte are 
concentrated along the northern margin of the Helena embayment along the Volcano 
Valley fault zone.  Figure 7-1 is a generalized geologic map showing a portion of the 
Helena Embayment.

The lowest unit of the Belt Supergroup in the Black Butte area is the Neihart 

Quartzite which measures approximately 240 meters thick at its type location 20 kilometers 
northeast of the property (Weed, 1900; Keefer, 1972) and is present in exposures and drill 
holes within the property area.   This unit rests unconformably on early Proterozoic granitic

gneiss and amphibolite.   Above the Neihart Quartzite is the Chamberlain Shale, a shallow 
water silty carbonaceous shale measuring approximately 700 meters thick and also 
present on the property.  The Newland Shale hosts the Black Butte massive sulfides, and 
consists of a lower shale-dominated part which measures approximately 760 meters thick 
and an upper carbonate-dominated part which measures approximately 350 meters thick.  
The shale is even laminated and was deposited as microturbidites in a sub-wavebase 
depositional setting.  Debris flow conglomerates punctuate the section along the northern 
margin of the embayment.  Though in places the lower Newland shale shows ubiquitous 
bedded pyrite throughout, more typically sulfides are concentrated in several discrete 
stratigraphic horizons of greater lateral extent.  The carbonate-rich upper Newland 
Formation is further divided into seven units as follows:  Unit I, a clean limestone or 
dolomite; Unit II, a silty calcareous or dolomitic shale similar to lower Newland shale; Unit 
III, a clean, black chert-bearing dolomite; Unit IV, a silty limestone and silty calcareous 
shale; Unit V, a non-calcareous silty shale very similar to Greyson Shale; Unit VI, a clean 
thin-bedded limestone; and Unit VII, a silty limestone and silty calcareous shale (Zieg, 
1981, 1986).   The Greyson Shale, a shallow water silty shale measuring approximately 
700 meters thick, overlies the Newland, and is in turn overlain by the Spokane Shale, a red 
argillite measuring at least 300 meter thick.  The latter formation is part of the Ravalli 
Group portion of the Belt Supergroup (Whipple, 1980; Connor, et. al., 1984). 

 
The Belt Supergroup rocks in this area have virtually no metamorphic grade 

(Maxwell and Hower, 1967).   The Belt stratigraphic section in the Helena embayment is 
significantly thinner than in the main Belt basin where rocks are metamorphosed to 
greenschist facies.  At Black Butte, very delicate sedimentary structures and other early 
fabrics are very well preserved.  Structural modification of the geology began with 
synsedimentary faulting along the north margin of the Helena embayment.  During Late 
Proterozoic time, the area hosted limited mafic magmatism, generally reported at 800 Ma 
(Reynolds, 1984).  A fault-bounded chlorite and carbonate altered basalt in a Black Butte 
drill hole produced a K/Ar date of 769 Ma (± 29Ma) (Himes and Peterson, 1990), and may 
reflect a local representative of this event.  No subsequent deformation or magmatism 
affected the area until Late Cretaceous regional compression, and at Black Butte, no 
intrusions accompanied this event.  Biotite-hornblende dacite dikes and sills on the 
property produce an Eocene date of 50.1 Ma (K/Ar date obtained by Cominco 
American/BHP JV).  Oligocene basaltic magmatism produced some basalt flows in the 
Black Butte area (Reynolds and Brandt, 2007).  Miocene extensional faulting has modified 
the landscape and drainage patterns to some extent in the Black Butte area.  Figure 7-2 is 
a district scale geologic map showing surficial geology in addition to drill hole locations.

The Volcano Valley thrust fault (VVF) forms the most mappable structure through 

the project area, as it carries Proterozoic sediments and crystalline basement complex on 
its south side against Paleozoic sediments on its north side.  Because regionally it cuts 
through the entire Paleozoic stratigraphic section and is intruded by Eocene intrusive, its 
age is best interpreted as Laramide (late Cretaceous).  Drilling at Black Butte shows that 
the VVF cuts, conceals, and apparently utilizes portions of earlier, Pre-Cambrian normal 
faults that form a north margin to most Newland Formation exposures.  The northernmost 
of these structures is known as the 'buttress' fault.  Allochthonous debris of a source-
proximal derivation is preserved in lower Newland shale along the east-west fault trend 
and shows that these Precambrian normal faults, which down-drop Belt stratigraphy on 
their south sides, approximate the middle Proterozoic northern margin of deeper water 
sedimentation in the Helena Embayment.  In the project area, the VVF has ramped up 
across a succession of 'stair stepped' down thrown fault blocks of Newland and 
Chamberlain shale as shown in Figure 7-3.  West of Butte Creek, the Copper Creek 
segment of the Volcano Valley fault shows an orientation of roughly N80E.  At Butte Creek, 
a N50E trending structure offsets the VVF in sinistral fashion to a point 1 kilometer 
northeast of its previous location.  From this point, the Black Butte segment of the VVF 
continues east north of Black Butte for approximately 2 kilometers and gradually arcs 
toward the southeast for 7 kilometers at bearing of S45E toward Newlan Creek.  From its 
entrance into the Newlan Creek valley, the Newlan Creek segment of the VVF continues 
with an easterly bearing for at least 16 kilometers.  The flexures  in the VVF at Butte Creek 
and at Newlan Creek are joined by a S65E trending northeast directed reverse fault called 
the Black Butte fault (BBF) which carries Chamberlain shale over Newland Shale.  The 
area enclosed between the Black Butte segment of the VVF and the BBF contains all 
currently known copper resources at the Black Butte Copper Project, and exhibits 
exposures of Newland formation ranging from the middle part of the lower Newland to Unit 
IV of the upper Newland.  In this copper mineralized block, three resource areas have 
been informally names Strawberry West, Strawberry Butte, and Strawberry East areas 
(Figure 7-3).  Each contains significant copper mineralization and some contain up to five 
copper-mineralized zones.

In and around the property area, bedded pyrite in the Newland shale persists along 

at least 25 kilometers of strike length, and in some places occurs intermittently across over 
900 meters of Newland Formation stratigraphy.  Drilling has shown as much as 25% pyrite 
across 700 meters of stratigraphy, and locally massive pyrite (>50%) can extend through 
as much as 250 meters of stratigraphy.  The lower Newland shale contains three discrete 
pyrite zones with important concentrations of copper and cobalt.  The lowest, dubbed the 
Lower Sulfide Zone (LSZ), lies just above the lower contact of the Newland Formation 
shales with the underlying Chamberlain Formation shale.  In most areas, debris flow 
conglomerates occur at this contact.    The LSZ is mainly known from drill testing in the 
Strawberry Butte and Strawberry East areas.  The next stratigraphically higher sulfide zone 
is the Middle Sulfide Zone (MSZ), a complex and very thick concentration of bedded and 
replacive pyrite that can occupy over 100 meters of lower Newland stratigraphy.  Though 
locally, the entire lower Newland can exhibit ubiquitous bedded pyrite, the MSZ shows 
greater concentrations and can have important concentrations of copper, cobalt, and zinc-
lead.  The MSZ is well developed at Butte Creek where it contains zinc-lead mineralization, 
and at Strawberry East where it contains abundant copper.  Higher in the stratigraphy,

from 30 to 60 meters below the top of the lower Newland shale, is the Upper Sulfide Zone 
(USZ).   The USZ is widely exposed in the region and drilling along 25 kilometers of the 
east-west strike length of the district shows it consists of highly variable thicknesses of 
laminated, thin bedded, and massive thicker-bedded pyrite with variable concentrations of 
zinc, lead, barium, and copper.   Copper mineralization is best developed in the USZ at 
Strawberry West, Strawberry Butte, and to some extent in the Strawberry East areas.  
These three zones are described in more detail in Section 9. 

 
Pyrite zones also occur between the USZ and Upper Newland Unit I (the 0/I sulfide 

zone) and in Upper Newland Unit II (the Ynu II sulfide zone) and can contain significant 
copper mineralization.  Additional pyrite zones without appreciable copper or zinc 
concentrations occur in Upper Newland Units III and IV.   

 
Most geologists interpret the genesis of the Black Butte sulfides as having formed at 

sysnsedimentary hydrothermal vents sites during deposition of the host shale.  Sulfides 
are involved in soft sediment folding, and sulfide accumulations include evidence of vent 
biota grown over subaqueous hydrothermal hot springs.  These are intricate growths of 
tubes interpreted as having formed around microbial filaments and are most abundant with 
greater sulfide accumulations (McGoldrick and Zieg, 2004).    Clearly, secondary pyrite, 
silicification, dolomitization, barite, and chalcopyrite all replaced the earlier pyrite 'muds' 
deposited at vent sites.   Pb isotope ratios from upper sulfide zone galena samples 
completed by Cominco American Inc. are consistent with a middle Proterozoic age for 
Black Butte mineralization (Zieg and Leitch, 1993).

7.2 Mineralization 

 
Upper Sulfide Zone (USZ): The USZ (Zieg, et. al. 1991) lies 60 to 90 meters below 

the contact between upper Newland and lower Newland and is hosted in lower Newland 
calcareous shale. In the Black Butte area north of the Black Butte Fault, four separate 
lenses of USZ occur along this stratigraphic horizon and are separated by conglomerate 
lenses or cut into separate structural blocks by northeast trending, down to the southeast 
normal faults. Only one lens, the Strawberry Butte USZ, contains enough drill hole 
information to allow some detailed definition of its geometry and compositional character. 
With the exception of its higher copper grades, the mineralogical and textural attributes of 
the Strawberry Butte USZ are typical of the USZ throughout the Black Butte area. The 
footwall of the Strawberry Butte USZ consists of Newland shale with abundant shale clast 
conglomerate layers.  The footwall to the USZ in this area contains no alteration or feeder 
structures.  Edges to the sulfide sheet, besides the Volcano Valley fault on the north, 
include an erosional trace on the east, a conglomeratic lens on the west, and an erosional 
surface cutting the sub-ore grade portion of the sulfide sheet on the south. The Strawberry 
Butte USZ consists of a lens of fine grained bedded pyrite up to 55 meters thick containing 
up to three chalcopyrite-bearing horizons. Microscopic textures and species of sulfide 
minerals, primarily from copper-enriched horizons, have been well described by Himes and 
Petersen (1990). Pyrite occurs as laminations and beds of very fine grained pyrite as 
microcrystals and spheroidal aggregates as small as 1 micron and up to 25 or more 
microns in diameter. Some coarse euhedral pyrite clearly grew much later than fine 
grained pyrite varieties.  Pyrite and sometimes marcasite aggregates contain rims, 
patches, and sometimes cores of chalcopyrite and tennantite, and in many cases 
amorphous CuCoNiAs-rich material. Pyrite grain rims contain enrichments of Cu, Ni, As, 
and Co. Chalcopyrite occurs as coarser grained veinlets and clots, in bedding parallel 
layers and bands, in quartz veinlets, and in barite veins and masses. In the southern part 
of the USZ, copper zones can contain bornite as well as chalcopyrite. Bornite appears 
characteristic of more distal mineralization. Cobalt minerals remain unidentified, but are 
probably cobaltite or glaucodot.  Coarse grained barite occurs both intergrown with and 
crosscutting pyrite. In a prevalent gangue-sulfide replacive texture, pyrite or chalcopyrite 
form one to five millimeter rims on rounded masses of gangue up to one centimeter 
across. Masses of this texture generally follow bedding and in some places crosscut pyrite 
beds.  Gangue mineralogy associated with such textures in the upper sulfide zone is 
usually barite; in other sulfide zones the gangue minerals are dolomite, calcite, or fine 
grained quartz. The upper part of the USZ shows high concentrations of coarse grained 
barite.   

 
Copper-enriched horizons, informally called (in ascending order) upper copper 

zones (UCZ) #1, #2, and #3, appear stratiform. These copper-rich horizons are now known 
as the Johnny Lee UCZ.  UCZ #1 (3D block model code 31) at the base of the upper 
sulfide zone pyrite sheet typically shows highest grades. UCZ #1 extends laterally at least 
1050 meters in a north-south direction and 540 meters in an east-west direction, ranges 
from approximately 1 to 29 meters in thickness, averaging about 8 meters thick. Hanging 
wall to footwall intersections within UCZ #1 reach up to 3.6% Cu and 0.54% Co although

individual assayed intervals often exceed 10% copper .  This zone lies approximately 107 
meters below the surface and outcrops along its eastern margin. Prior to the 2011 drilling 
program the UCZ #1 was thought to be thickest near its northern boundary where it is 
truncated by the Volcano Valley fault.  The zone is approximately 11 meters thick in that 
area.  Drill results from 2011 show what appears to be a thick mound along the southern 
end of the zone that approaches 30 meters in thickness.  UCZ #3 (drill hole code 33) 
appears locally in the northern area but UCZ #2 (block model code 32) is absent. 
Southward, where the USZ thickens to as much as 55 meters, UCZ # 1 rises from the 
base of the pyrite sheet, and UCZ #2 appears higher within the pyrite sheet. Further south, 
UCZ #2 disappears and UCZ #3 reappears.    Further to the south the copper-rich zones 
disappear.    

 
UCZ #1 and UCZ #2 have been modeled as three dimensional wireframes using a 

nominal 1% copper cutoff grade.  Within the wireframes the UCZ #1 lens contains about 
12.9 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.8% copper and the smaller, stratigraphically 
higher UCZ #2 lens contains about 3.2 million tonnes at an average grade of 2.1% copper.  
These tonnage/grade quantities were tabulated at a zero cutoff grade. 

 
Zoning patterns show higher concentrations of Cu, Co, and Ni in the north part of 

the Strawberry Butte USZ; highest barium concentrations on its western margin and in 
more southerly intersections; and further south, a drop in Cu, Co, and Ba and a rise in Pb, 
Zn, and Ag. Bulk Zn values within Cu mineralized areas of the USZ appear lower than in 
barren Newland shale, but Pb values maintain levels approximately ten times shale 
background. While local silicification occurs within the Cu-mineralized stratigraphy, most of 
the Cu-Co mineralization occurs within unsilicified bedded pyrite.  Better grades are 
associated with barite-chalcopyrite veins and masses of intergrown pyrite, barite, and 
chalcopyrite that replace and crosscut the bedded sulfide.  Beyond the conglomerate lens 
on the west lies an additional mass of upper sulfide zone with Cu-bearing bedded pyrite in 
the Strawberry West area. Two intersections of the Strawberry West mineralization exhibit 
nearly identical mineralogical and textural attributes to those at Strawberry Butte but here 
the USZ is thicker, reaching 115 meters thick.  One kilometer southeast of the Strawberry 
Butte USZ is an outcropping lens of USZ that has not been drilled.   To the south east 2.5 
kilometers in the Strawberry East area, another lens of USZ mineralization contains much 
lower Cu-Co concentrations.  A typical example of USZ copper mineralization is shown in 
Figure 7-7, which shows fine-grained chalcopyrite mineralization with a copper grade of 1 
to 2 percent.

Middle Sulfide Zone (MSZ): At Strawberry East, the MSZ begins about 30 meters 

below the USZ and consists of scattered silicified and pyritized conglomerate beds, 
bedded pyrite, and zones of intensely silicified and copper and barite mineralized 
conglomerate, shale, and crosscutting fragmental rock within at least 100 meters of 
stratigraphy.  Chalcopyrite occurs in the most silicified areas, and reaches its greatest 
concentrations in the thickest sections of silicified conglomerate and pyrite. This zone 
shows textural, mineralogical, and metallurgical similarities to both the upper and lower 
sulfide zones.  Historic drilling shows as much as 52.1 meters grading 2.72% Cu and 
0.11% Co in this zone at Strawberry East.  The VVF cuts the base of the thickest MSZ 
occurrences.   The MSZ shows extreme variability in thickness, sulfide content, copper and 
cobalt content, and degree of alteration over lateral distances of 200 meters or less, and 
appears best developed along NE trending high angle faults near the VVF.   In one part of 
Strawberry East, the USZ and the underlying MSZ merge with a resulting true 
(stratigraphic) thickness of approximately 220 meters of >50% sulfide.

Five kilometers west at Butte Creek, the MSZ shows massive pyrite beds and 

laminations with local concentrations of laminated sphalerite and galena but little copper.  
Here, a historic hole showed a true (stratigraphic) thickness of 300 meters of >50% sulfide, 
again a combination of USZ and MSZ stratigraphy.   Between Butte Creek and Strawberry 
Butte, MSZ correlative stratigraphy contains little or no sulfide, silicification, or other 
evidence of hydrothermal activity, though this same area has the most important 
concentrations of Cu-Co in its Upper and Lower Sulfide Zones.   

 
Lower Sulfide Zone (LSZ): The LSZ lies at or just above the Newland-Chamberlain 

contact. In the Strawberry Butte area the LSZ consists of a stratabound mass of 
silicification containing coarse grained pyrite and chalcopyrite that overprints a dolomite, 
dolomitic shale, and black shale protolith. The LSZ contains higher Cu grades and lower 
Co grades than does the USZ. Chalcopyrite is the only Cu mineral identified within the 
LSZ. Bedded pyrite does occur in the LSZ, but coarse grained chaotic fragmental or 
crosscutting sulfide textures dominate.  Up to four additional sulfide zones that lie in the 
hanging wall of the LSZ show more bedded pyrite, some replacive dolomite and pyrite 
intergrowths, occasional barite, and generally less chalcopyrite.  Generally, a Lower 
Copper Zone (LCZ) occurs in or coincides with the lowermost sulfide band of the LSZ.  
Some silicification can occur in hanging wall sulfide zones.  The LSZ footwall generally 
consists of silicified conglomerate, which contains relatively sparse quartz and dolomite 
veins with chalcopyrite and pyrite. Carbonate alteration, generally as coarse grained 
dolomite in crosscutting replacement veins and ribbons, porphyrotopes, and trains of 
porphyrotopes, occurs throughout the hanging wall of the lower sulfide zone for several 
tens of feet and overprints hanging wall zones. Carbonate alteration also occurs footwall to 
and distal to the LSZ but this distal alteration shows finer grain sizes and weak 
development.  The alteration can occur as calcite as well as dolomite, and associated 
mineralization commonly contains disseminated chalcopyrite, and in places sphalerite or 
galena. In more distal mineralization, barite can occur in a similar fashion to the carbonate.  
At Strawberry East, the footwall consists of shattered silicified sediment rather than 
conglomerate as is observed elsewhere. The footwall contains frequent chalcopyrite and 
pyrite stringers crosscutting this shattered texture. The top of this silicified and chalcopyrite 
mineralized shattered zone consists of vuggy, coarse massive pyrite, which is 
chalcopyrite-bearing in places and barren in others. Silicified conglomerate layers lie in the 
hanging wall of the LSZ and host some chalcopyrite. Also in the LSZ hangingwall, zones of 
silicification, replacive carbonate-sulfide masses, and scattered pyrite beds can contain 
ore-grade concentrations of chalcopyrite. Distal LSZ mineralization at Strawberry East 
appears similar to distal LSZ mineralization and hanging wall sulfide zones in the 
Strawberry Butte area where it often consists of layers of replacive barite or dolomite and 
pyrite intergrowths, zones of fine grained dolomite, calcite, or barite alteration, and 
scattered pyrite replacement veins. Distal LSZ mineralization typically lacks silicification. 
Anhydrite and gypsum veins, so far unique to Strawberry East, cut uppermost 
Chamberlain shale below the LSZ and its silicified footwall.   Capping the LSZ stratigraphy 
is a 60 meter stylolitic dolomite unit called the Hangingwall Dolomite.

 The greatest known concentrations of LCZ mineralization are in the Strawberry 

Butte area and to a lesser extent in the Strawberry East area where it has received less 
drilling.  In holes east and west of the historic LCZ resource at Strawberry Butte area, LSZ 
stratigraphy shows only weak copper mineralization, and holes in the east part of the 
Strawberry East area show only weak mineralization or alteration at LSZ stratigraphy.  
Only two holes test LSZ stratigraphy in the hangingwall of the VVF and neither show 
mineralization or alteration.   Exposures of LSZ stratigraphy locate near the surface south 
of the BBF show evidence of weak mineralization.  The copper-rich horizon within the LSZ 
is now referred to as the Johnny Lee LCZ. 

 
The Johnny Lee LCZ has been modeled as the three dimensional wireframe using a 

nominal copper cutoff of 2%.  The dimensions of the wireframe are approximately 1175m 
in the east west direction and approximately 125m in the north south direction.  The unit is 
wider on the far east end reaching about 300m in the north-south direction.  The LCZ is 
truncated by structures along its southern and northern boundaries.  Within the wireframe 
there are approximately 2.7 million tonnes of material at an average copper grade of 4.4% 
using a zero cutoff grade. 

 
An example of very high-grade copper mineralization from the LSZ is shown in 

Figure 7-10.  This interval ran about 15% copper.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

 
The Black Butte bedded sulfide accumulations best fit a shale-hosted massive 

sulfide deposit type model.  The host rocks contain no volcanic component and in terms of 
setting and geometry, the sulfide occurrences are quite similar to typical Proterozoic and 
Phanerozoic shale-hosted Zn and Pb rich deposits.   However, the high concentrations of 
copper, cobalt, and barium are unusual in shale hosted sulfide occurrences. Mt. Isa 
(Perkins, 1984) and Walford Creek (Rohrlach, et. al. 1998) in Australia make reasonable 
analogies (Zieg, 1992).   

 
The Black Butte exploration model is a middle Proterozoic synsedimentary 

subaqeous hydrothermal vent field developed at structural intersections during prolonged 
synsedimentary extensional faulting along the northern margin of the Helena embayment.  
At Black Butte, early stage pyrite was deposited in sub-wavebase calcareous muddy 
sediments over extensive areas.  Diagenetic sulfide and sulfate mineralization with 
silicification and carbonate (dolomite) alteration overprinted syngenetic pyrite beds and 
host muds.  Cu +/- Co and Ba replaced some pyrite zones proximal to hydrothermal vent 
centers at the seabottom.  In more distal areas, Zn, Pb, and Ag become more 
concentrated.  The process resulted in multiple stratabound zones of Cu-Co mineralization 
in at least five stratigraphic levels within the host shales.   In all bedded sulfide zones, a 
biogenic component to mineralization is evidenced by the abundant preservation of two 
early fabrics, microbial mats within the massive pyrite beds and abundant masses of 
pyritized microbial tubiform structures.  Such fabrics dominate the sulfide zones in areas 
where they are of increased thickness and higher sulfide concentrations, and are also 
present as clasts in debris flows.  Sulfide matrix debris flows suggest mound building and 
collapse.  The microbial textures indicate a concentration of these early thermophiles 
around seafloor hydrothermal vent centers.  Most sulfur at Black Butte is isotopically like 
that expected from biogenic reduction from seawater sulfate.  The role of microbial life 
forms appears to have been critical to both reduction of sulfate and as a substrate for 
much sulfide precipitation in the initial stages of development of the sulfide zones.   The 
lack of higher life forms during this time allows preservation of far greater quantities of 
microbial material than in Phanerozoic examples.   There is a clear spatial correlation 
between greater sulfide concentrations, abundance of microbial textures, and increased 
metal grades.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

 
Cominco American Inc., Utah International, and BHP conducted a variety of 

geological, geochemical, and geophysical programs between 1976 and 1993.    This 
historic work included surface mapping, surface soil and rock sampling, various 
geophysical surveys, and core drilling.  Geologic maps, down-hole geochemical data, 
some surface geochemical data, drill logs, some down-hole surveys, and various 
compilation maps from these programs were recovered from the University of Montana 
Belt Research center to which Cominco American Inc. donated core and geologic 
information at the end of their tenure at Black Butte.  No geophysical data is presently 
available.  Within the area described as "resource" by Cominco American Inc., the drill 
hole spacing was approximately 150 meters and 19 holes penetrated the Upper Copper 
Zone and sub zones, and 12 holes penetrated the Lower Copper Zone.  Only three holes 
encountered both zones.  64 holes in total were drilled on the present leases and an 
additional four holes were drilled on unpatented claims owned by Tintina. 

 
In 2011, Tintina began a more detailed compilation of all available geologic mapping 

data.  Historic maps included work that was completed by Cominco and BHP.  Tintina staff 
compiled a number of previous geologic maps of the district, focusing on areas located 
adjacent to known copper deposits at Black Butte, as well as areas that had historic 
drilling. 

 
Digitization of historical mapping showed some small differences between 

geological interpretations on adjoining maps.  Tintina's staff is addressing these and will 
field check areas of concern. 

 
Tintina also compiled previous soil geochemical data and conducted their own soil 

sampling program in 2011.  Tintina's staff compiled available historical soil geochemistry 
from the area and converted the older coordinates associated with those samples to UTM 
WGS 84 Zone 12N datum.  Previous soil sampling focused on areas where prospective 
Newland stratigraphy is near the surface. 

 
Tintina crews collected 744 soil samples over areas geologically permissive for 

mineralization but not covered by earlier surveys.    Field crews collected samples with a 
hand auger, and attempted to collect from the 'B' soil horizon.  If the B horizon was not 
present, samples were collected from the 'C' horizon.  The survey consisted of collecting 
soil samples from 19 north-south oriented lines.  These sample lines were spaced 300 
meters apart in most areas with samples collected at 60m intervals along the sample line.  
In areas which were thought to be more prospective, the line spacing was reduced from 
300m to 150m, with samples collected every 30m along the line.  Three east-west soil 
lines spaced 500m apart with samples collected at a spacing of 60 meters, covered ground 
with north-south striking stratigraphy.  Areal sample coverage ranged from 501650 E to 
506480 E and 5176000 N to 5180000 N.  Field crews located all sample sites with a hand-
held GPS unit.

ALS Minerals in Reno, NV, screened soil samples to 180 µm (PREP 41), digested 

them in aqua regia, and analyzed them for 51 elements with ICPMS (ME-MS41L) and for 
Au with ICP-AES (Au-ICP21).  Results from soil sampling are pending.

10.0 DRILLING 

 
10.1 Type and Extent of Drilling 

 
As described in Sections 6 and 9, there have been several drilling campaigns 

conducted at the Black Butte Copper Project by four different companies since the early 
1980's.  The majority of the diamond drilling data for the Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ have 
been collected by Tintina as a result of their 2010 and 2011 drilling campaigns.  
Approximately 65% of the UCZ drilling was completed by Tintina.  Drilling data collected by 
Cominco American Inc. (CAI), Utah International Inc. (UII), and BHP were also used by the 
author for estimating mineral resources for the Johnny Lee zones.  Drill hole data that were 
used for the Johnny Lee UCZ zone are summarized Table 10-1. 

  
Table 10-1:  Summary of Johnny Lee UCZ Drilling by Company  

 

 
 
  Table 10-2 tabulates the drill holes that were used to estimate mineral resources 

for the Johnny Lee LCZ.  Note that some of the holes that are summarized in Table 10-2 
are also included in Table 10-1. 

 
Table 10-2:  Summary of Johnny Lee LCZ Drilling by Company  

 

 
 
Table 10-3 is a complete drill hole collar listing for holes that were used to estimate 

resources for the Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ horizons.  This table includes XYZ collar 
locations, azimuth and dip of the hole at the collar, total depth, which zone or zones were 
tested, and which company drilled the hole. 

 
Figure 10-1 is a geologic plan map showing the location of drill holes in the area of 

the currently identified Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ units.  The holes are color coded by the 
company that drilled them.  There are more drill holes shown in Figure 10-1 within the UCZ 
than were used for the 2010 resource estimate.

10.2 Relevant Johnny Lee UCZ Results 

 
Samples were collected by Tintina, CAI, UII, and BHP from 73 diamond core holes 

from the Johnny Lee UCZ covering an area measuring about 550m (east-west) to 1065m 
(north-south).  Relevant samples from these drilling campaigns are summarized in Table 
10-4.  The intervals shown in Table 10-4 were used by Tintina's technical staff in 
developing two massive sulfide lenses (UCZ #1 and UCZ #2 referred to as UCZ 31 and 
UCZ 32, respectively).  The intervals shown in Table 10-4 were composited from individual 
core hole samples from the hanging wall to footwall contact.  Only composited samples 
above a 2% copper cutoff grade are shown in Table 10-4.  Individual copper assays from 
these composited intervals often exceeded 10% in grade.  The raw assay intervals were 
capped prior to creating 2m long composites that were used for block grade estimation as 
described in Section 14.4.

10.3 Relevant Johnny Lee LCZ Results 

 
Samples were collected by Tintina, CAI, UII, and BHP from 25 diamond core holes 

from the LCZ covering an area measuring about 1200m (northwest-southeast) to about 
100 to 250m (northeast-southwest).  Relevant samples from these drilling campaigns are 
summarized in Table 10-5 based on hanging wall to footwall composites.  The intervals 
shown in Table 10-5 were used by the author to estimate resources for a single massive 
sulfide horizon referred to as LCZ 10.   

   
Table 10-5:  Relevant Johnny Lee LCZ Intervals  

 
 

10.4 2010 Tintina Drilling 
 
In 2010, Tintina completed 1509.65 meters of core drilling in five holes to verify 

historic results obtained by Cominco American Inc., Utah International, and BHP (Lechner, 
2010).  The work was carried out on Tintina's behalf by Spring Valley Drilling from Hot 
Springs, Montana.  The contractor came well recommended and successfully completed 
each of the five holes using a truck mounted core drilling rig capable of recovering HQ 
(2.5") diameter core from the depths required.  In holes SC10-001 through -004, HQ-sized 
core was recovered; in hole SC10-005 drilling problems required reduction to NTW (2.25" 
diameter) core.  Core recoveries through the sulfide zones were excellent.  Down hole 
surveys were conducted using both Reflex and Devico multi-shot tools and down hole 
surveys show that the holes are reasonably straight.  Because of drilling problems, only 
two survey stations 70 meters apart were collected from the bottom of SC10-005.

10.5 2011 Tintina Drilling 

 
In 2011 Tintina contracted with Ruen Drilling Inc. from Clark Fork, ID.  Ruen used 

two track mounted Longyear LF-90's drills, a Longyear LF-70, a CS-1000 and two wheel 
mounted CS-1500's.  The hole collars were surveyed by WWC Engineering from Helena, 
MT, the same as in 2010.  The 2011 drill holes were surveyed down-the-hole using a 
Reflex tool.  The drills were manned by two crews that each worked 12 hour shifts. 

 
Drill core was delivered to Tintina's core logging facility located in White Sulphur 

Springs, MT twice daily during drilling operations by company employees.  The core was 
transferred to logging tables in the core storage warehouse where quick logs were 
generated by staff/contract geologists.  Various geologic information such as core 
condition, lithologic contacts, bedding orientation, estimate of sulfide content, structure, 
alteration, mineralization, barite content, vent fauna, presence of microbia mat structures, 
etc. were recorded into Microsoft Word documents as daily reports that were sent to 
corporate headquarters. 

 
After quick logging the core was transferred to a heated logging facility where more 

detailed core logging was completed.  Drilling depths from wooden run blocks were 
converted from Imperial to metric units.  Core recovery and RQD measurements were then 
made and recorded in a Microsoft Access database.  All core boxes were weighed and 
then photographed.  Detailed core logs (lithology, alteration, mineralization, structure, etc.) 
were electronically scanned and then recorded into an Access database by Tintina 
geologists or technicians.   

 
10.6 Sampling and Recovery Factors 

 
In general core recovery by all four companies was satisfactory to excellent.  There 

are no drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and 
reliability of the results. 

 
10.7 True Thickness 

 
As described in Section 7, mineralization is typically stratabound.  Banding of the 

bedded pyrite in the sulfide zones and host shale is assumed to be the true orientation of 
the mineralized horizon.  In all cases, the bedding and sulfide banding lies at 
approximately 80 to 90 degrees from core axis, and so the intersections represent near 
true thickness of the mineralization 

 
10.8 Significantly Higher Grade Intervals 

 
The selection of which drill hole intervals which were to be included in the Johnny 

Lee UCZ and LCZ wireframes was based on geology (i.e. bedded massive sulfide 
accumulations with visible copper mineralization) and assay results.  The author notes that 
in general, most of the individual assay intervals ranging for 0.25m to 2.0m contain copper

grades in excess of 1%.  A certain amount of internal dilution was allowed by including 
weakly mineralized intervals. 

 
The massive sulfide horizons show appreciable short range variability in grade but 

in most cases no single high-grade interval was allowed to be smeared out across the 
horizon so as to "carry" that intercept.

11.0 SAMPLING PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 

 
11.1 Historic Sample Preparation 

 
Historic sampling of core by Cominco American Inc. and Utah International/BHP 

was completed on all mineralized or altered sections of drill core and sample interval 
lengths were usually 5 feet (1.52m) or less.   In mineralized zones, Cominco used geologic 
boundaries to guide placement of sample interval breaks.  Utah International and BHP 
sampled on strict 2 foot (0.61m) sample intervals through mineralized zones. In all cases, 
a geologist logged and photographed the core, marked sample interval boundaries with 
flagging with footage written on the flagging, stapled a sample tag in the wax impregnated 
core box, and a geologic technician split the core as directed by the geologist. 

 
11.2 Tintina Sample Preparation 

 
In Tintina's drilling programs, sawn core samples were collected throughout the 

UCZ and LCZ's from HQ diameter drill intersections as a part of the 2010 verification 
drilling program and 2011 infill drill program.  Because the zones generally have some 
silicification, core recoveries are quite good throughout the mineralized zones.  Each box 
of core was photographed and logged by the geologist.   Sample boundaries were marked 
on core, sample numbers with beginning and ending meterages were marked on 
aluminum tags and stapled with sample card stubs onto the sides of core boxes.  Samples 
were collected continuously from the beginning to end of each mineralized zone with 
interval spacings typically less than 2 meters in length and usually broken at geologic 
boundaries.  No gaps were left between subsequent samples in any mineralized zone.  
Boundaries of mineralized zones were selected on the basis of a visual estimation of 
chalcopyrite content and a comparison with historic drill logs from the nearby twinned drill 
hole.  After logging the geologic data from the drill core, sampling began approximately 
thirty feet above where core appeared to consistently contain more than approximately 
0.5% chalcopyrite, and ended thirty feet below the last occurrence of mineralization.  
Sample cards were filled out with the hole number, date, and beginning and ending of 
interval, and samples were split with an electric powered tile saw either by the geologist or 
by a geologic technician under supervision of the geologist.  Every effort was made to get 
an unbiased representative sample of the core.  Because core recoveries have been good 
and core is generally only slightly broken if at all, samples are good quality.  The geologist 
marked the core for sampling, and stapled both the paper sample tags and an aluminum 
tag showing beginning and ending measurements in the wax-impregnated core box.   

 
11.3 Historic Sample Analyses 

 
In the Cominco American Inc. and Utah International/BHP core sampling programs, 

a geologic technician put the split core samples in marked bags and sealed them, then 
boxed or bagged them and shipped them via UPS to the laboratory of choice.  Labs used 
were Silver Valley Laboratories in Kellogg, Idaho; Bondar Clegg in Vancouver, B.C., and 
BHP's in-house lab at Sunnydale, CA.  A program of QA/QC involving regular injection of

blanks, standards, and duplicates was conducted by both companies.  Companies 
requested a variety of analytical suites with a minimum of a dozen elements including Cu, 
Co, Pb, Zn, Ag, Fe, As, and Ba.   Trace quantities of most metals were analyzed by atomic 
absorption, and 'over limit' quantities were completed by wet chemical and fire assay 
methods.  Details of procedures are no longer available, but interviews with individuals 
involved in the programs show that sampling was completed to the standards of the time.   

 
11.4 Tintina Sample Analyses 

 
In the 2010 Tintina core sampling program, the geologist, or a technician under the 

geologists supervision, bagged samples in marked bags, sealed the bags, put the 
individual sample bags in marked rice bags, sealed these bags, and arranged for a FedEx 
pickup on site for International FedEx next day delivery to the ALS Chemex laboratory in 
Vancouver, B.C.  Some samples were shipped via bundled pallets by UPS to the ALS 
Chemex lab in Reno, NV.  The samples sent to Reno were prepped and the pulps sent to 
the Chemex lab in Vancouver, BC.  ALS Chemex is an internationally recognized certified 
lab (ISO 9001:2000).  ALS Chemex crushes the core to 70% <2mm; pulverizes a 250 
gram split to 85% <75 um;  completes a four-acid digestion on a split, and carries out both 
a 33 element inductively coupled plasma analysis (ME-ICP61a) and an ore-grade copper 
assay routine (Cu-G62).   

 
At least one duplicate, blank, and standard reference material (SRM) was inserted 

into the sample number series for every 20 samples and included in the shipments.  The 
standard that was used for the 2010 Tintina drilling was purchased from WCM Minerals.  
This commercial standard (PB 134) has certified copper, lead, zinc, and silver values of 
0.58%, 0.91%, 1.72% and 184 g/t, respectively.  For the 2010 drilling program pieces of 
Newland Formation Unit VII were collected from accessible outcrops along the highway 
near the property and used as blank material. 

 
In 2011, Tintina purchased and began using three other certified standards that 

were purchased from WCM Minerals.  Table 11-2 summarizes the expected values from 
all SRM's used by Tintina.  Landscaping marble pieces purchased from a local hardware 
store were used for blank material in 2011. 

 
11.5 Tintina Sample Security 

 
The 2010 Tintina drill core was taken from the drill rig by Tintina personnel to a 

rental house located near the project site.  After logging, the core samples were placed in 
sealed bags prior to shipment by FedEx or UPS to ALS Chemex laboratories. 

 
Tintina has rented a core logging/processing/storage facility in White Sulphur 

Springs for their 2011 drilling campaign (see Figure 2-3).  Drill core is retrieved from the 
drill rigs twice a day by Tintina contractors and delivered to the core processing facility.  
The drill core is stored in a secure warehouse with the samples placed in sealed bags.

In the author's opinion, the Black Butte core is adequately secure and reasonable 

measures have been undertaken to ensure the safety and integrity of the samples. 
 

11.6 Historic Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
 
The majority of the Black Butte data were collected in the 1980's and 1990's by 

highly reputable major mining companies (i.e. Cominco American, Utah International, and 
BHP).  Tintina has made a concerted effort to obtain assay certificates and quality 
assurance/quality control (QA/QC) data from Teck-Cominco.  At the time of this report, 
Teck-Cominco has not provided Tintina with the requested data. 

 
11.7 Tintina Quality Assurance/Quality Control Program 

 
For their 2010 and 2011 drill campaigns Tintina submitted blanks and certified 

standards with the sawn drill core samples at a frequency of approximately one QA/QC 
sample per 20 core samples.  Tintina also requested that ALS Chemex prepare duplicate 
samples from the coarse reject that was left over from the initial sample preparation which 
was then submitted to Inspectorate Exploration & Mining Services Ltd.  A large percentage 
of representative splits from the original ALS Chemex pulps were submitted to 
Inspectorate for check assaying purposes.  Table 11-1 summarizes the number of QA/QC 
samples that were submitted by Tintina from their 2010 and 2011 drilling campaigns that 
are relative to this report. 

 
Table 11-1:  Summary of QA/QC Samples  

 

 
 

11.8 2010-2011 Tintina Blank Performance 
 
In 2010 four blanks were submitted by Tintina for the first four confirmation drill 

holes.  That blank material consisted of locally derived Newland Formation material.  
Several of the blanks that were assayed for copper returned values higher than 15 times 
detection limit.  However those values were significantly lower than 0.1% Cu and probably 
represent trace copper in the Newland Formation.  All of the cobalt blanks were less than 
10 times the detection limit.

For the 2011 drill campaign Tintina used commercially available landscape marble 

pieces which eliminated the anomalous copper values associated with the Newland 
Formation blanks used in 2010 Figures 11-1 through 11-4 show values obtained from 
blank material submitted for the 2010 and 2011 drill campaigns for Cu, Co, Ag, and Au, 
respectively. 

 
Figure 11-1:  Copper Blank Performance  

 

 
 
As can be seen in Figure 11-1 there were four apparent failures.  The Cu, Pb, and 

Zn values that were obtained from those four barren samples are very close to three of the 
standards that were used by Tintina.  Tintina's geologic staff was able to confirm that there 
was a clerical error in the database that switched the labels of blanks with standards.  The 
author notes that the Chemex returned higher copper values for the supposedly barren 
landscaping marble than would be expected.  This noise could also represent 
contamination of the crushing/grinding equipment.  The author recommends that Tintina 
pay close attention to the performance of blank material associated with future drilling 
campaigns.

11.9 2010-2011 Tintina SRM Performance 

 
For their 2010 and 2011 drilling programs Tintina submitted 326 standard reference 

materials (SRM's) along with their HQ-NQ diamond core hole samples that were submitted 
to ALS Chemex.  The certified SRM's were purchased from WCM Sales Ltd. (WCM 
Minerals) from Burnaby BC.  The insertion rate of the SRM's was approximately one SRM 
per 20 drill hole samples.  Table 11-2 summarizes the expected values for various metals 
for each of the SRM's along with their associated standard deviations.  The expected

The apparent failures of the copper SRM PB 134 are associated with the sample 

label switch that was previously discussed.  The author has confirmed with Tintina's 
geologic staff that this was due to the wrong label attributed to the SRM's and blanks.  
Chemex tended to return copper values that were higher than the expected value.  A few 
samples were slightly above +3 standard deviations which should be used as a failure 
limit.  The author has recommended that Tintina closely monitor SRM performance for all 
future drilling campaigns.  All samples outside of 3 standard deviations need to be 
compared against other QA/QC samples associated with that sample batch to see if there 
is a problem with the batch and if necessary have the lab re-assay the entire batch.

11.10 2010-2011 Tintina Duplicate Samples 

 
As a part of their QA/QC program Tintina notifies ALS Chemex that they should 

create a duplicate pulp from the coarse reject sample at an approximate frequency of one 
duplicate pulp for every 30 drill core samples.  For their 2010 and 2011 drilling campaigns 
a total of 321 duplicate pulp samples were prepared and assayed by Chemex.  Table 11-3 
summarizes basic descriptive statistics for the original and duplicate pulp for those 321 
sample pairs. 

 
Table 11-3:  Original-Duplicate Sample Comparison  

 

 
 
The original pulp tended to assay slightly below the duplicate pulp assay (e.g. the 

mean original copper pulp grade was 2% lower than the duplicate pulp).  The mean grade 
statistics are influenced by several high-grade samples.  Quantile-quantile (QQ plots) were 
drawn to compare the original pulp result (X-axis) with the duplicate pulp result (Y-axis).  
Figures 11-12 through 11-15 show QQ plots based on the original and duplicate pulp 
results for copper, cobalt, silver, and gold, respectively.

11.11 2010-2011 Tintina Check Assays 

 
Two different types of "check assays" were completed for Tintina's 2010 and 2011 

drilling campaigns.  The first set consists of HQ and NQ core that was prepped and 
assayed by ALS Chemex.  Tintina requested that Chemex create a split from select pulps 
which were then submitted to Inspectorate and assayed for a variety of metals.  A total of 
70 pulps were re-assayed by Inspectorate. 

 
The second set of check assays were prepared by Inspectorate and re-assayed by 

Chemex.  These samples represented PQ core from metallurgical holes that were 
submitted to Inspectorate for metallurgical recovery studies.  Each of the submitted core 
intervals were assayed by Inspectorate prior to compositing for metallurgical testwork.  
Tintina requested that Inspectorate split out a representative portion of the initial pulp 
which was then submitted to Chemex for re-assaying.  A total of 63 pulps were re-assayed 
by Chemex.  

 
Table 11-4 summarizes basic descriptive statistics for the 70 same pulp assays that 

were originally assayed by Chemex and later assayed by Inspectorate. 
 

Table 11-4:  Chemex vs. Inspectorate Same Pulp Assay Comparison  
 

 
 
The mean Chemex copper, cobalt, and silver grades are 8%, 6%, and 16% higher 

than Inspectorate.  There is no apparent significant bias between the two labs as illustrated 
by XY scatter graphs as illustrated in Figures 11-16 through 11-18 for copper, cobalt, and 
silver, respectively. 

 
Figures 11-16 and 11-17 suggest that the difference in mean copper and cobalt 

grades may be influenced by a handful of high-grade samples.  Other factors could be 
associated with how well the initial Chemex pulps were homogenized prior to creating a 
split for Inspectorate.  Differences in acid digestions and acid temperatures between the 
two labs could also add to the mean grade differences.  The author recommends that for 
future drilling campaigns that Tintina generate more pulps from the coarse reject and 
submit them to another commercial lab.  The author also recommends that Tintina send 
coarse reject splits to a secondary lab so that they can prep and assay their own 
independent sample.

11.12 Discussion 
 
Based on the information available to the author, CAI, UII, and BHP followed 

industry accepted procedures for sample preparation, analysis and security.  The author 
highly recommends that Tintina continue trying to obtain assay certificates and QA/QC 
data from Teck-Cominco and/or BHP for the older drilling data. 

 
The author believes that there are no material factors that could have affected the 

accuracy and reliability of the results from the various drilling campaigns.  Core recovery 
tends to be very good except in rare cases of shearing within fault zones. 

 
Based on twin hole comparisons (2010 Tintina versus older drilling data) and 

subsequent QA/QC results from Tintina's 2011 drilling campaign it is the opinion of the 
author that the Black Butte data are suitable for estimating Mineral Resources.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

 
12.1 Pre-Tintina Data 

 
Tintina obtained a copy of the electronic drill hole database along with other 

information (e.g. drill hole collar locations, down-hole surveys, and various maps) from the 
Belt Research Center located in Missoula, MT, which is managed by the University of 
Montana Geology Department.  Cominco American donated this data to the Belt Research 
Center after they terminated their interest in the Black Butte Copper Project.   

 
12.2 Tintina Confirmation Drilling 

 
As mentioned above, the author has not been able to verify the drilling data 

collected prior to 2010 because that data is not currently available.  In the absence of 
assay certificates and QA/QC results, Tintina drilled four twin diamond core holes in the 
northern portion of the Upper Sulfide Zone.  A fifth hole (SC10-005) was drilled to target 
the Lower Sulfide Zone and was not used by the author for this report.  The Tintina holes 
were drilled as part of a Phase I drilling campaign designed to verify older drill hole results 
that were obtained from the Upper and Lower Sulfide Zones.  Table 12-1 compares the 
2010 Tintina Upper Copper Zone intercepts with older Utah International intercepts.  These 
comparisons show that half of the new holes have higher grades and thicknesses than the 
older intercepts and half have lower grades and thicknesses.  Figure 12-1 shows the 
location of the 2010 Tintina confirmation drill holes.

Figure 12-1:  Tintina Confirmation Drilling Locations  

 

 
 
Each new hole twinned an historic hole drilled through either or both the Upper 

Sulfide Zone and Lower Sulfide Zone near Strawberry Butte in areas described as copper-
cobalt resources by Cominco American Inc.  In each twinning, the historic collar was 
located as closely as possible either by physical location of the historic collar or by 
resurveying the historic location.  New holes were collared three meters away from the 
historic location.  SC10-001 was located 3 meters south of the SCC-19 collar marker; 
SC10-002 was located 3 meters south of the SCC-23 collar marker; SC10-003 was 
located three meters south of the historic survey coordinates; SC10-004 was located three 
meters south of the historic SCC-34 collar marker; and SC10-005 was located three 
meters south of the historic survey coordinates.

Grades and grade x thicknesses for each of the confirmation twin holes are 

compared with the older holes in a series of down-hole copper grade histograms and 
cumulative grade-thickness plots in Figures 12-2 through 12-5. 

 
12.3 Tintina Assay Verification 

 
The author was able to verify 100% of the 2010 and 2011 Tintina electronic drill 

hole assays that were used for estimating Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ mineral resources by 
comparing the records stored in their electronic database against signed ALS Chemex 
assay certificates (Lechner, 2010) and (Lechner, 2011).  No errors were discovered. 

 
For this report the author randomly selected six 2011 drill holes that were used to 

define the Johnnie Lee UCZ (units 31 and 32).  Signed assay certificates for drill holes 
SC11-017, SC11-029, SC11-035, SC11-063, SC11-064, and SC11-072 were compared 
against Tintina's electronic assay database.  Only intervals from those holes that were 
used by the author for estimating mineral resources were checked.  A total of 80 intervals 
from zones 31 and 32 were checked for copper, cobalt, gold, and silver (320 entries).  No 
errors were discovered. 

 
12.4 Discussion 

 
The original assay certificates and associated QA/QC data were unavailable for the 

historic drilling.  However, the Tintina confirmation drilling results demonstrated that the 
older drilling is adequate for resource estimation purposes. 

 
While on site the author made some random checks of down-hole survey records 

from the drillers against the electronic database and discovered no discrepancies.  
 
The author has completed a representative review of Tintina's 2010 and 2011 

drilling campaigns and has been able to verify that their database is accurate.  The QA/QC 
results demonstrate that the assays are representative and reproducible. 

   
In the author's opinion, the drill hole data that were used to estimate mineral 

resources for the Black Butte UCZ and LCZ are adequate and reasonable.

13.1 Mineral Processing Investigations 

 
The objective of the preliminary metallurgy program was to develop effective 

flotation conditions for the recovery of copper and other payable metals and to identify 
potential amenability problems.  

 
The process development studies were conducted on a Master Composite followed 

by variability flotation response tests on the sub-composites. The effects of primary grind 
and regrind levels as well as pH levels and collector types on the metallurgy were 
investigated. Bond Rod and Ball Mill Work Index determinations were performed on the 
Master Composite. 

 
The testwork was conducted at the Metallurgical Division of Inspectorate 

Exploration and Mining Services Ltd, the analytical work by the Inspectorate Analytical 
Division which has ISO 9001 accreditation and uses standard QC and QA procedures. 

 
Initial work which included QEMSCAN mineralogy studies focused on the 

determination of optimum rougher flotation feed size and flotation conditions followed by 
developing cleaner conditions in batch flotation tests.   

 
The results of these investigations indicated that the Johnny Lee copper-cobalt 

mineralization is very fine grained and complex requiring a primary grind level of 80% 
passing 38micron and a rougher concentrate regrind of 80% passing 8micron for effective 
liberation and recovery of copper minerals to a marketable concentrate. 

 
A brief overview of these investigations follows:  
 
Primary grind size levels between 108 and 42 micron p80 were tested initially, 

flotation was conducted at a near neutral pH level using SIPX as the primary collector 
while exploring a number of alternate secondary collectors. A primary p80 grind level of 42 
micron and a combination of SIPX and A3894 were concluded to give the best 
results.A3894 is utilized as a CYTEC collector composed of Alkyl-alkyl thionocarbamate 
which is stated to be a good copper mineral collector selective against pyrite.  

 
The results of the grind sensitivity tests, conducted at pH 8.0-8.5 are shown in 

Figure 13-1.

Figure 13-1:  Rougher Mass Recovery vs. Grind  

 

 
 
A primary grind size level of 38-42micron was indicated and a very high mass 

recovery of about 30 percent to the rougher concentrate was required to achieve a 90 
percent copper rougher recovery; the ratio of concentration to achieve this recovery target 
is very low at about three. The silver and cobalt recoveries to the rougher concentrate 
were very low at about 50 percent.  These test results are in line with the mineralogy study 
data. 

 
Difficulties experienced in upgrading the rougher concentrate in subsequent cleaner 

tests prompted a mineralogy study to determine the mineral liberation and associations; at 
16micron about 60 percent of the copper sulfides in the concentrate are liberated and the 
balance was mostly associated with pyrite. The concentrate contained 63% cobaltiferous 
pyrite (containing over 40% of the cobalt in the concentrate) which was almost 80 percent 
liberated.  

 
The high collector additions in the roughers needed to achieve <90 percent copper 

recoveries resulted in very high recoveries of nearly barren pyrite and high collector 
concentrations in the cleaners which adversely affected the selectivity.  

 
More selective rougher conditions and finer re-grinding were considered to be 

necessary to improve selectivity in the cleaners. The results of tests F27 and F32 illustrate 
the effect of rougher conditions. The cleaner metallurgy of these tests is shown in Table 
13-1 and Figure 13-2. The regrind level and cleaner conditions in both tests were the 
same.

The more selective rougher conditions applied in F32 clearly produced superior 

overall Cu cleaner metallurgy, even though the rougher recovery F27 was four percent 
higher. The cobalt and silver rougher recoveries in F32 at about 30% were much lower 
than in F27 because the much of the cobaltiferous pyrite was rejected. 

 
The effect of a finer regrind and sodium cyanide addition levels were explored in 

next series of tests.  The first cleaner conditions and results are shown in Figure 13-3.

Figure 13-3:  Effect of Regrind and NaCN on Cleaning  

 

 
 
Test F34 with a 50g/t NaCN addition to the regrind mill produced the best results. 
 
In preparation for the locked cycle test two 3 stage batch cleaner tests were done 

generally following F35 conditions. In both tests the p80 primary grind size was reduced to 
37micron and in one of the tests (F37) the ratio between 3418A and SIPX was increased 
as summarized in Table 13-2. 

 
Table 13-2:  F34, F36, F37 Rougher Concentrates  

 

 
 
The finer primary grind slightly improved the copper, cobalt and silver rougher 

recoveries.  
 
The metallurgy balance of F36 is shown in Table 13-3. The table shows that the 

copper recovery decreases sharply at concentrate grades above 25% Cu.; the silver and 
cobalt recoveries to the cleaner concentrate are very low.

A minor element analysis was performed on the concentrates of the last three 

cycles of the test. The concentrate was found to contain very low levels of deleterious 
elements; the only element that may incur a penalty is arsenic which has a slightly 
elevated concentration of 0.28%.  Minor element concentrates are summarized in Table 
13-5. 

 
Table 13-5:  Minor Element Concentrations  

 

 
 

13.2 Basis for Predicting the Recovery 
 
In order to develop a concentrate grade recovery correlation from the locked cycle 

test the 2nd cleaner concentrate grade and recovery were calculated by making the 
assumption that the 2nd cleaner concentrate would comprise of the 3rd cleaner concentrate 
plus 50% of the copper contained in the 3rd cleaner tailing. The concentrate grade recovery 
equation developed from the two data sets is shown in Figure 13-4.

13.3 Origin and Representativeness of Metallurgical Samples 
 
Mineralized intervals of four diamond drill holes in the UCZ zone were selected for 

the study; the samples include hanging wall dilution amounting to 15 percent of the weight 
of the two meter interval above mineralization. The samples were selected to represent the 
typical massive sulfide copper mineralization in the UCZ zone and are summarized in 
Table 13-7.

A Master Composite was prepared from the sub-composites based on equal weight 

contributions.

The cyanide soluble silver content was determined to provide an indication of the 

exposed surface area of the silver containing minerals; a 25% cyanide soluble Ag content 
suggests that most of the silver is occluded in other minerals and not readily available for 
flotation.  

 
13.4 Mineral Processing Risk Factors 

 
The samples selected for the testwork are believed to typical but not necessarily 

representative of the massive sulfide mineralization in the Upper Copper Zone of the 
Johnny Lee deposit; a much larger suite of samples taken from the across the 
mineralization in the zone is required to generate representative samples. 

 
The process flowsheet and flotation conditions used in the tests on which the 

metallurgy projections are based are typical for the processing of complex massive sulfide 
ores and are used extensively in the industry, as such the process risk is considered to be 
low.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

 
Mr. Michael J. Lechner, President of Resource Modeling Inc. was contracted to 

prepare an estimate of Mineral Resources for the Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ within the 
Black Butte Copper Project area.  Mr. Lechner is a recognized Qualified Person (QP) by 
virtue of his education (B.A. Geology, University of Montana), experience (over 30 years of 
continuous employment in the fields of mineral exploration, mine operations, resource 
estimation and geologic consulting), and professional registration (P. Geo. in British 
Columbia, Registered Geologist in Arizona, Certified Professional Geologist from the 
AIPG, and a Registered Member of the SME).  Mr. Lechner has no interest in Tintina or 
owns any Tintina securities and has operated for them as an independent consultant. 

 
Mr. Lechner estimated resources for the Johnny Lee UCZ in late 2010 and prepared 

a Technical Report, which discussed that work (Lechner, 2010).  This report focuses on an 
update of the Johnny Lee UCZ based on a significant amount of Tintina infill drill hole 
results.  Sections 14.1 through 14.12 discuss the newly updated Johnny Lee UCZ 
resource estimate.  Mr. Lechner estimated resources for the Johnny Lee LCZ in late 2011 
which was disclosed in a Technical Report (Lechner, 2011).  Sections 14.13 through 14.22 
discuss the estimate of resources for the Johnny Lee LCZ. 

 
14.1 Drill Hole Data 

 
The author was provided with various electronic drill hole data for the UCZ and LCZ 

by Tintina personnel.  These data (drill hole collars, down-hole surveys, assays, geology, 
density, etc.) were provided as either Excel spreadsheets, ASCII CSV files, or as 
MineSight® drill hole files.  MineSight® is a commercial mine planning software package. 

 
All Black Butte Copper Project drill hole data are stored in an Access database that 

was constructed and is managed by database consultant Jack Cote. The database resides 
on the Tintina corporate ftp site as well as at the project site in Montana.  All assay results 
are loaded directly from electronic certificates that are issued by ALS-Chemex. Quality 
assurance/quality control reports are prepared for each certificate load.  Once the new 
assay data are loaded a copy of the updated database is uploaded to the project office and 
ftp site.  All data collected from core logging is hand entered by project personnel into the 
DDH3 Site Tool data entry program. This includes: RQD, specific gravity measurements, 
geologic coding of intervals, sample interval data, and collar and down-hole survey data.  

 
14.2 Johnny Lee UCZ Drilling Data 

 
As described in Section 10, most of the drilling data for the Black Butte area were 

collected by Cominco American, Utah International, and BHP.  Table 10-1 summarizes the 
drill hole data that were used by the author to estimate Mineral Resources for the Upper 
Copper Zone.  The aerial distribution of the holes shown in Table 10-1can be reviewed in 
Figure 10-1.

14.3 Johnny Lee UCZ Exploratory Data Analysis 

 
The Johnny Lee UCZ consists of several lenses of massive sulfide mineralization.  

Tintina's geologic staff generated three-dimensional wireframes which represent those two 
copper sulfide lenses.  Basic assay statistics for copper, cobalt, and silver are tabulated in 
Tables 14-1 through 14-3, respectively for the two Johnny Lee UCZ massive sulfide units.   

 
Table 14-1:  Johnny Lee UCZ Copper Assay Statistics  

 

 
 

As can be seen in Table 14-1, approximately 68% of the drill hole assays in the 
main sulfide bed (UCZ 31) are in excess of 1% copper and about 22% are above 3% 
copper.  The coefficient of variation (CV) for the UCZ copper assays is 0.96 suggesting 
that high-grade outliers are not a significant issue.

Roughly one third of the Johnny Lee UCZ cobalt assays are above 1000 ppm 

(0.10%).  Cobalt shows a slightly higher CV than copper but is not alarmingly high. 
 

Table 14-3:  Johnny Lee UCZ Silver Assay Statistics  
 

 
 
Only about 10% of the Johnny Lee UCZ silver assays are above 30 g/t (40% are 

above 15 g/t).  Silver shows the lowest CV of the three metals. 
 
14.4 Johnny Lee UCZ High-grade Outliers 
 
The author generated a series of cumulative probability plots after transforming the 

original copper, cobalt, silver, gold, and zinc assays using the cumulative normal 
distribution method.  Figure 14-1 and Figure 14-2 show copper and cobalt probability plots 
for UCZ unit 31, respectively.  The black circle shown in these figures are capping limits 
selected by the author to minimize the potential for over estimating contained metal.  Table 
14-4 summarizes the high-grade outlier capping limits that were established for copper, 
cobalt, and silver.  These limits were applied to the raw assays prior to creating drill hole 
composites.

14.5 Johnny Lee UCZ Domains 
 
Mr. Vincent Scartozzi, a Senior Geologist with Tintina, constructed a three-

dimensional wireframes to represent two Johnny Lee UCZ stratabound copper sulfide 
horizons.  The two horizons consist of a lower more extensive unit referred to as UCZ unit 
31, and an upper less extensive horizon referred to as UCZ unit 32.  The author reviewed 
the wireframes and requested that Tintina make minor changes to exclude and/or include 
several drill hole intervals.  XYZ hanging wall and footwall drill hole pierce points were 
used to create the initial wireframe solids.  Criteria such as minimum thickness 
(approximately 3 meters) and copper grade (roughly a 1% cutoff grade) were used in 
conjunction with logged lithologic/mineralization observations to construct the wireframe.  
The wireframe was extended approximately 30-40 meters outward from the perimeter drill 
holes that intersected the horizon.  Figure 14-3 is a perspective view looking N20W 
downward at the main and secondary UCZ wireframes.  The Volcano Valley Fault shown 
in blue was modeled as a thick zone of shearing and was used to clip the up dip portion of 
unit 31.  The Upper Sulfide Zone (USZ) was modeled as a separate wireframe that locally 
is coincident with the UCZ units but in general is more extensive than the actual copper 
zones and is shown as a light green semi-transparent wireframe.  Block grades were only 
estimated for UCZ units 31 and 32.  The percentage of each model block inside of the two 
UCZ's wireframes was stored in the block model for more accurate tonnage tabulations.

14.6 Johnny Lee UCZ Compositing 
 
One-meter-long drill hole composites were created starting and ending inside of the 

Johnny Lee UCZ wireframes (zones 31 and 32).  There were a total of 630 UCZ unit 31 
composites with 95% of them exactly 1 meter in length; approximately 4% were between 
0.50 to 1.0m in length, and about 1% less than 0.5m in length.  There were a total of 153 
UCZ unit 32 composites with 95% of them exactly 1 meter long, 3% between 0.50 and 1.0 
meter in length, and 2% less than 0.5m in length.  The grade estimate was weighted by 
composite length.

14.7 Johnny Lee UCZ Variography 
 
The author generated a number of variograms for the Johnny Lee UCZ using 

several software packages (MineSight and Sage 2001).  Copper grade, grade-thickness, 
and grade indicator variograms and correlograms were generated and modeled. Figure 
14-4 shows a copper grade relative variogram that was generated from 99 hanging wall to 
footwall composites that were generated from UCZ units 31 and 32.  An exponential model 
was used to fit the data points.  Vectors were drawn at 2/3 and 80% of the total variance 
(red bisectors) to show the spread of range.  Note that the effective or practical range for 
exponential models is 1/3 of the range shown along the X-axis.

14.8 Johnny Lee UCZ Grade Estimation 
 
The author constructed a three dimensional block model using MineSight® 

software.  Table 14-5 summarizes the limits of the model and size of the blocks. 
 

Table 14-5:  Johnny Lee UCZ Block Model Limits  
 

 
 
Because copper mineralization within the Johnny Lee zones occurs as distinct 

stratabound layers within thick bedded sulfide accumulations the author elected to use an 
estimation method which would provide constraints that would result in a distribution of 
block grades that closely follow bedding.  

 
This method is based on selecting eligible composites to estimate each block based 

on the relative distance between each model block and the copper zone hanging wall and 
footwall contacts.  The Cartesian distance between each block centroid and the upper and 
lower copper zone contacts was calculated and stored in the blocks.  The relative distance 
between the hanging wall and footwall surfaces for each block was calculated using the 
following expression:  relative distance (RELZ) = distance to footwall / (distance to footwall 
+ distance to hanging wall) * 100.  For example, RELZ value of 100 means that the block 
is located at the hanging wall contact while a RELZ distance of 0 means the block is 
located near the footwall contact.  This method allows for a more uniform position of the 
block relative to irregular hanging wall and footwall contacts.  The 1-meter-long drill hole 
composites were then backtagged with the block RELZ value.  This ensured that the 
position of both the blocks and the drill holes relative to the zone contacts was established 
and could be used to select composites within similar stratigraphic positions as the blocks. 

 
A two pass inverse distance estimation plan was used for estimating copper, cobalt, 

silver, gold, lead, zinc, iron, sulfur, and barium.  The first pass insured that blocks within 
the UCZ wireframes (units 31 and 32) were filled with estimated block grades.  The first 
pass used a maximum of three composites with no more than one composite per drill hole.  
The second pass required that at least two drill holes were required to estimate each 
block.  The second estimation pass locally overwrote many of the block grades that were 
estimated by the first pass.  The author experimented with numerous combinations of 
inverse distance power weights and minimum/maximum number of allowable samples.  
Comparisons were made between the inverse distance block and nearest neighbor model 
grades at a zero cutoff grade.  In order to minimize smearing of higher grade samples the 
author found that a limited number of samples should be used with a high inverse distance 
weighting power (5).

The relative elevation option available in MineSight® was used to further select 

eligible drill hole composites.  The actual Z or elevation coordinate for both the blocks and 
drill holes was substituted with the RELZ value that was previously described.  A 
parameter (PAR20) in the estimation routine allowed the author to open or restrict which 
composites could be used.  For example, a block with a RELZ value of 50 (half way 
between the hanging wall and footwall contacts) could be estimated by composites with 
RELZ values of 50 ± the PAR20 value of 10.  This means that the block with a RELZ value 
of 50 could be estimated by composites having RELZ values between 40 and 60, or 40 to 
60 percent of the distance from the footwall.  The resultant distribution of block grades 
appears to be very stratigraphic is thought to be a good representation of the actual 
distribution of copper grades. 

 
As previously mentioned, the model blocks were coded with the two UCZ 

wireframes so that an integer code (either 31 or 32) and the percentage of each block 
contained within the wireframes were stored.  Along the margins of the wireframes some 
blocks contain a partial percentage of the wireframe or a mineralized component and an 
unmineralized component.  Block grades were estimated for mineralized and 
unmineralized portions of each block using appropriate drill hole intervals (i.e. the 
mineralized portion of the block was estimated by drill hole composites located inside of 
the wireframe and the unmineralized portion of the block was estimated by only drill hole 
composites located outside of the wireframes).  Grades were also estimated for blocks 
with no proportion of UCZ horizon wireframes.  This strategy will allow mine planners to 
use local information for dilution estimates. 

 
The block estimation parameters are summarized in Table 14-6.  The number of 

composites and drill holes used to estimate each block were captured along with the 
distance to the closest composite.  These data were used to classify the blocks into 
Inferred Resources. 

 
Table 14-6:  Johnny Lee UCZ Inverse Distance Estimation Parameters  

 

 
 
14.9 Johnny Lee UCZ Grade Model Verification 
 
The estimated block grades were verified by visual and statistical methods.  The 

block grades were compared with the drill hole composite grades in section and plan.  It is 
the opinion of the author that the block grades look reasonable when compared with the 

Min Max Max/hole Major Axis Minor Axis Vert Axis

Nearest neighbor models were constructed for the primary metals of interest (i.e. 

copper, cobalt, and silver).  To check for possible global biases in the block model, the 
inverse distance and nearest neighbor grades were compared for all estimated blocks at a 
zero cutoff grade.  Table 14-7 compares copper and cobalt grades estimated by inverse 
distance and nearest neighbor methods. 

 
Table 14-7:  Johnny Lee UCZ Global Bias Check  

 

 
 

The data in Table 14-7 show a close comparison between the inverse distance and 
nearest neighbor grades and show that the model is globally unbiased.  Based on industry 
accepted practice models that show less than a 5% variance from a nearest neighbor 
grade model are unbiased. 

 
Johnny Lee UCZ copper drill hole composite grades were compared with the 

estimated copper block grades at a variety of cutoff grades.  That comparison shown in 
Figure 14-14, shows that there the model block grades closely follow the underlying drill 
hole composite grades.

The author also checked for local biases by creating a series of slices or "swaths" 

through the model columns (eastings), rows (northings), and levels (elevations) comparing 
the inverse distance and nearest neighbor grades.  Figures 14-12 through 14-13 show the 
local variation between the inverse distance and nearest neighbor copper models at a zero 
cutoff grade.  The inverse distance grade (cuidw) is shown in red, the nearest neighbor 
grade (cunn) is shown in blue and the number of blocks per "swath" are shown by the 
black line which is read from the right side Y-axis.

Figure 14-14:  Johnny Lee UCZ Copper Swath Plot – Elevation 

 

 
 
The swath plots shown in Figures 14-12 through 14-14 show some local variation 

with the nearest neighbor model grades showing more variation and the inverse distance 
grades showing some smoothing.  These graphs also provide an indication as to where 
higher grades exist. 

 
Based on a visual examination and comparisons with a nearest neighbor model, it is 

the opinion of the author that the model is globally unbiased and represents a reasonable 
estimate of undiluted in-situ resources. 

 
14.10 Johnny Lee UCZ Resource Classification 
 
Estimated blocks inside of the UCZ wireframes (units 31 and 32) were classified as 

Indicated Resources if 1) the block was estimated by two or more holes with one hole 
within 50m or 2) the block was estimated by one hole within 25m.  All other blocks inside of 
the two wireframes were classified as Inferred Resources. 

 
14.11 Johnny Lee UCZ Density Data 
 
Tintina personnel have obtained bulk density determinations from 349 pieces of drill 

core taken from their 2010 and 2011 drilling programs in the Johnny Lee zone.  The 
average bulk density from these 349 samples was 3.54 g/cm3.  These determinations are 
representative of the various lithologic units including UCZ massive sulfide horizons.  The 
core was not rigorously dried but was not thought to contain much moisture.  The core was

weighed in air and then weighed while submerged in water.  A relative bulk density 
calculation was then made (bulk density = weight in air/ (weight in air - weight in water). 

 
Based on 60 UCZ massive sulfide determinations, a bulk density value of 3.93 

g/cm3 was selected by the author for Johnny Lee UCZ horizons 31 and 32.  Based on 148 
determinations an average bulk density of 3.61 g/cm3 was selected for non-copper sulfide 
zones within the bedded sulfide package.  A bulk density value of 2.80 g/cm3 was assigned 
to all other model blocks. 

 
14.12 Johnny Lee UCZ-LCZ Topographic Data 
 
Surface topographic data were obtained from a USGS website (seamless.usgs.gov) 

by selecting an area of interest (AOI) around the Black Butte Copper Project area and 
downloading the data as a standard DEM file.  This data has a resolution of about 1/9 arc-
second or approximately 3-meters and was in NAD83 units.  The data was translated into 
WGS84 datum using Manifold GIS software (version 8).  The resultant XYZ topographic 
points were then triangulated into a surface using MineSight®.  The author compared the 
elevation of the surveyed drill hole collar locations against the topographic surface and 
found a close correspondence.

14.13 Johnny Lee UCZ Resource Summary 
 
A cutoff grade of 1.6% copper was used to define an undiluted Indicated Mineral 

Resource of 8,483,000 tonnes with an average grade of 2.96% Cu, 0.12% Co, and 16.9 g/t 
Ag.  In addition to Indicated Resources there is an Inferred Resource of 1,257,000 tonnes 
with an average grade of 2.64% Cu, 0.10% Co, and 16.4 g/t Ag using a 1.6% copper cutoff 
grade.  The cutoff grade was established by using a copper price of US$2.75 per pound, a 
copper recovery of 81%, mining costs of US$59/tonne, processing costs of 
US$16.00/tonne and G&A costs of US$5.00/tonne.    Table 14-8 summarizes Johnny Lee 
UCZ Indicated Resources at a number of cutoff grades.  The disclosed Johnny Lee UCZ 
Indicated Resource is highlighted in yellow.  No credit was given to cobalt or silver in 
determining the cutoff grade.

14.14 Johnny Lee LCZ Drilling Data 
 
Like the updated Johnny Lee UCZ resource, the Johnny Lee LCZ resource is based 

on a majority of drilling data that has been recently collected by Tintina.  Data collected by 
previous operators (i.e. Cominco American, Utah International, and BHP) were used in 
conjunction with the newly acquired Tintina drilling data to estimate mineral resources for 
the Johnny Lee LCZ.  Table 14-10 summarizes the drill hole data that were used by the 
author to estimate mineral resources for the Johnny Lee LCZ.  The information in Table 
14-10 includes the company that drilled the hole, beginning and ending depth of the 
horizon, the LCZ intersection length and average Cu, Co, Ag, and Au grades for the LCZ 
intersections.  The grades shown in Table 14-10 are based on capped raw assays (see 
Section 14.16 for capping limits).

14.15 Johnny Lee LCZ Exploratory Data Analysis 
 
The Johnny Lee LCZ consists of several lenses of massive sulfide mineralization.  

Only the thickest and most continuous horizon was modeled.  Basic assay statistics were 
tabulated at four different cutoff grades for uncapped copper, cobalt, silver, and gold in 
Table 14-11 (left portion of table).  The data summarized in Table 14-11 include the 
number of meters at each cutoff grade, mean grades, standard deviations, and coefficients 
of variation.  Incremental data (i.e. statistics for material between cutoff grades are also 
tabulated.  For example, 66% of the LCZ intersections are above a 1% copper cutoff 
grade, with 34% less than that cutoff.  Basic statistics are also summarized for grades after 
high-grade outlier values were capped (refer to Section 14-16 regarding grade capping). 

 
The coefficient of variation (CV), which is the ratio of standard deviation over the 

mean, for the Johnny Lee LCZ copper assays was reduced from 1.10 to 0.96 by grade 
capping.  Cobalt shows the highest CV suggesting that there are more outlier values in 
that population.  Silver grades are not particularly significant with only 2% of the LCZ 
assays above 15 g/t.  Approximately 10% of the LCZ gold assays are above 1 g/t.

The author generated a series of cumulative probability plots after transforming the 

original copper, cobalt, silver, and gold assays using the cumulative normal distribution 
method.  Figures 14-17, 14-18, and 14-19 show copper, cobalt, and gold probability plots 
for the Johnny Lee LCZ, respectively.  The black circle shown in these figures are capping 
limits selected by the author to minimize the potential for over estimating contained metal. 

 
Table 14-12 summarizes high-grade outlier capping limits for copper and cobalt for 

the Johnny Lee LCZ.  These limits were applied to the raw assays prior to creating drill

14.17 Johnny Lee LCZ Domain 

 
Mr. Vincent Scartozzi, a Senior Geologist with Tintina, constructed a three-

dimensional wireframe to represent the Johnny Lee LCZ stratabound copper sulfide 
horizon.  The author reviewed the wireframes and requested that Tintina make minor 
changes to exclude and/or include several drill hole intervals. XYZ hanging wall and 
footwall drill hole pierce points were used to create the initial wireframe solid.  Criteria such 
as minimum thickness (approximately 2 meters) and copper grade (roughly a 2% cutoff 
grade) were used in conjunction with logged lithologic/mineralization observations to 
construct the wireframe.  The wireframe was extended approximately 30-40 meters 
outward from the perimeter drill holes that intersected the horizon.  The Johnny Lee LCZ 
wireframe was then intersected with two district fault structures (the Volcano Valley Fault 
and the Buttress Fault).  Figure 14-20 is a perspective view looking N62E at the Johnny 
Lee LCZ horizon (red) which is shown to be truncated by the Volcano Valley and Buttress 
Faults shown in blue hues.  Block grades were only estimated for Johnny Lee LCZ.  The 
percentage of each model block inside of the Johnny Lee LCZ wireframe was stored in the 
block model for more accurate tonnage calculations.

14.18 Johnny Lee LCZ Grade Estimation 

 
The author constructed a three dimensional block model for the Johnny Lee LCZ 

using MineSight® software.  Table 14-13 summarizes the limits of the model and size of 
the blocks. 

 
Table 14-13:  Johnny Lee LCZ Block Model Limits  

 

 
 
The author constructed separate inverse distance estimation plans for estimating 

"base" metals (copper, lead, zinc, iron, sulphur, barium, and arsenic) and "precious" 
metals (gold, silver, and cobalt).  Inverse distance powers were 3 and 5 for base and 
precious metals, respectively.  These powers were selected based on grade comparisons 
were made with nearest neighbor models.  The number of composites and drill holes used 
to estimate each block were captured along with the distance to the closest composite.  
These data were used to classify the blocks into Inferred Resources.  

 
Tables 14-14 and 14-15 summarize inverse distance parameters for base and 

precious metals, respectively.

14.19 Johnny Lee LCZ Grade Model Verification 
 
The estimated block grades were verified by visual and statistical methods.  The 

block grades were compared with the drill hole composite grades in section and plan.  It is 
the opinion of the author that the block grades look reasonable when compared with the 
sample data.  Figures 14-21 and 14-21 are cross sections through the block model 
showing composite and block copper grades.  For reference, Figure 7-4 is a plan map 
showing the lines of section for Section D-D' and Section E-E'.  Figure 7-6 is a geologic 
cross section through D-D'.

Nearest neighbor models were constructed for the primary metals of interest (i.e. 

copper, cobalt, gold, and silver).  To check for possible global biases in the block model, 
the inverse distance and nearest neighbor grades were compared for Inferred blocks at a 
zero cutoff grade.  Table 14-16 compares copper and cobalt grades estimated by inverse 
distance and nearest neighbor methods. 

 
Table 14-16:  Johnny Lee LCZ Global Bias Check  

 

 
 

The data in Table 14-16 show a close comparison between the inverse distance 
and nearest neighbor grades and show that the model is globally unbiased.  Based on 
industry accepted practice models that show less than a 5% variance from a nearest 
neighbor grade model are thought to be unbiased. 

 
The author also checked for local biases by creating a series of slices or "swaths" 

through the model columns (eastings), rows (northings), and levels (elevations) comparing 
the inverse distance and nearest neighbor grades.  Figures 14-23 through 14-25 show the 
local variation between the inverse distance and nearest neighbor copper models at a zero 
cutoff grade.  The inverse distance grade (CUIDW) is shown in red, the nearest neighbor 
grade (CUNN) is shown in blue and the number of blocks per "swath" are shown by the 
black line which is read from the right side Y-axis.

Figure 14-25:  Johnny Lee LCZ Copper Swath Plot – Elevation 

 

 
 
The swath plots shown in Figures 14-23 through 14-25 show some local variation 

with the nearest neighbor model grades showing more variation and the inverse distance 
grades showing some smoothing.  These graphs also provide an indication as to where 
higher grades exist.  For example, copper grades tend to increase going from west to east 
(i.e. Figure 14-23).  Similarly, copper grades tend to be relatively high-grade at the far 
south end of the zone with a dramatic drop in grade around 5,180,750 North.  Copper then 
steadily increases in grade for about 250-300 meters before decreasing. 

 
Based on a visual examination and comparisons with a nearest neighbor model, it is 

the opinion of the author that the Johnny Lee LCZ model is globally unbiased and 
represents a reasonable estimate of undiluted in-situ resources. 

 
14.20 Johnny Lee LCZ Resource Classification 

 
Blocks that were estimated by one or more drill holes within 75 meters of a block 

were classified as Inferred Resources.  The author notes that no Inferred blocks were 
estimated by less than three drill holes and 83% of the Inferred Resource tonnage was 
estimated by five drill holes. 

 
According to the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) an 

Inferred Mineral Resource is defined as: "An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a 
Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of 
geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, 
geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited information and

sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes".  Based on that definition it is the author's opinion 
that a portion of the Johnny Lee LCZ Butte qualifies as an Inferred Resource.  There is 
ample geologic evidence for the bedded massive sulfide zones and sufficient drilling to 
demonstrate the extent and geometry of the mineralized system.  

 
14.21 Johnny Lee LCZ Density Data 

 
Tintina personnel obtained bulk density determinations from 17 pieces of drill core 

taken from their 2010 and 2011 drilling programs as summarized in Table 14-17.  These 
samples represent massive sulfide material from the Johnny Lee LCZ.  The core was not 
rigorously dried but was not thought to contain much moisture.  The core was weighed in 
air and then weighed while submerged in water.  A relative bulk density calculation was 
then made (bulk density = weight in air/ (weight in air - weight in water).   

 
Table 14-17:  Johnny Lee LCZ Bulk Density Determinations  

 

 
 

Based on these results, the author chose to use a bulk dry density of 3.80 for 
tabulating Inferred Resources for the Johnny Lee LCZ. 

 
14.22 Johnny Lee LCZ Resource Summary 

 
A cutoff grade of 1.5% copper was used to define an undiluted Inferred Mineral 

Resource for the LCZ of 2,462,000 tonnes with an average grade of 4.71% Cu, 0.06% Co, 
0.35 g/t Au, and 5.1 g/t Ag.  The cutoff grade was established by using a copper price of 
US$2.75 per pound, a copper recovery of 84%, mining costs of US$50/tonne, processing 
costs of US$16.00/tonne, G&A costs of US$5.00/tonne and refining costs of 
US$5.53/tonne.  Table 14-18 summarizes resources at several cutoff grades.  No credit 
was given to cobalt, gold, or silver in determining the cutoff grade since little metallurgical 
work has been completed at this stage of the project.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL  OR COMMUNITY 

IMPACT 
 
Tintina has initiated a number of baseline studies in support of a Preliminary 

Economic Assessment (PEA) report that was originally planned to be completed in fourth 
quarter of 2011. With an updated and larger resource based on the success of the 2011 
exploration program the PEA will be expanded and is expected to be completed in the third 
quarter of 2012.  The focus of the PEA will be an assessment of the Johnny Lee UCZ.  
Consultants Hydrometrics, based in Helena, MT, and Tetratech, based in Bozeman, MT 
have initiated a number of preliminary studies including, but not limited to, quarterly 
surface water sampling, ground water characterization, monitor well installation, wetlands 
survey, cultural survey, wildlife and vegetation survey.  All of these studies are ongoing 
and at this time no final reports have been issued. Tintina's surface drilling activities take 
place under the jurisdiction of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, 
Environmental Management Bureau, Hard Rock and Placer Exploration Section. This 
oversight includes sight inspections and review of reclamation practices. 

 
The authors are not aware of any current environmental liabilities associated with 

the Black Butte Copper Project.  Nor are the authors aware of any environmental issues 
that could impact the ability to develop this project.  The aforementioned consultants will 
be completing their initial reviews later this year.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

 
Within section 34, Township 12 North, Range 6 East, are a number of patented 

claims and unpatented load mining claims controlled by Holcim, a large Swiss cement 
company. Holcim operates a small open cut iron oxide mine on the patented claims and 
produce only a few thousand tons iron oxide ore per year from the mine.  The mine only 
operates during fair weather months.  The iron oxide is trucked to Holcim's cement plant 
near Three Forks, Montana.  Past drilling by Cominco American Inc. has shown that the 
iron oxide concentrations are gossans formed from weathering of the USZ.   The author is 
not aware of any resources located on adjacent properties.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 
25.1 Geologic Interpretation 

 
The copper-cobalt mineralization at Black Butte has been recognized since the 

early to mid 1980's.  A significant amount of work was completed by major mining 
companies in developing a geologic model and testing that model by a number of core 
drilling campaigns. 

 
The Black Butte bedded sulfide accumulations best fit a shale-hosted massive 

sulfide deposit type model.  The host rocks contain no volcanic component and in terms of 
setting and geometry, the sulfide occurrences are quite similar to typical Proterozoic and 
Phanerozoic shale-hosted Zn and Pb rich deposits.   However, the high concentrations of 
copper, cobalt, and barium are unusual in shale hosted sulfide occurrences. Mt. Isa 
(Perkins, 1984) and Walford Creek (Rohrlach, et. al. 1998) in Australia make reasonable 
analogies (Zieg, 1992).  Most geologists interpret the genesis of the Black Butte sulfides as 
having formed at sysnsedimentary hydrothermal vents sites during deposition of the host 
shale.  Sulfides are involved in soft sediment folding, and sulfide accumulations include 
evidence of vent biota grown over subaqueous hydrothermal hot springs.  These are 
intricate growths of tubes interpreted as having formed around algal or bacterial filaments 
and are most abundant with greater sulfide accumulations (McGoldrick and Zieg, 2004). 

 
The Black Butte exploration model is a middle Proterozoic synsedimentary 

subaqeous hydrothermal vent field developed at structural intersections during prolonged 
synsedimentary extensional faulting along the northern margin of the Helena embayment. 

 
25.2 Mineral Resource Estimates 

 
CAI developed preliminary "resource" estimates for the Johnny Lee UCZ and LSZ's.  

These historic estimates are not considered to be compliant with NI 43-101 (Cominco 
American Inc., 1996).  CAI ultimately terminated their interest in Black Butte due to 
relatively low copper prices (less than US$ 1.00 per pound). 

 
Using historic and more recent 2010-2011 Tintina drilling data have allowed for an 

estimate of mineral resources for the Johnny Lee UCZ and LCZ (Lechner, 2010), 
(Lechner, 2011).  The focus of this report is an updated estimate of mineral resources for 
the Johnny Lee UCZ.  Table 25-1 summarizes the current Black Butte Mineral Resource 
inventory (only copper grades and contained metal are shown in this table).

Note:  Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have 

demonstrated economic viability.  Inferred Mineral Resources have a high degree of 
uncertainty as to their existence, and a great uncertainty as to their economic and legal 
feasibility.  It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Resource will ever be 
upgraded to a higher category. 

 
A PEA study is currently in progress to address the viability of the Johnny Lee UCZ.  

That study is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2012.  
 
Tintina has been drilling in the Strawberry East area and is currently interpreting the 

new data.  It is anticipated that an estimate of mineral resources will be prepared for this 
area in the first quarter of 2012. 

 
25.3 Metallurgical Studies 

 
Preliminary testwork and mineralogy studies were performed on a Master 

Composite prepared from samples of typical massive sulfide Upper Copper Zone 
mineralization. 

 
 Chalcopyrite is the predominant copper mineral but a small amount of tennantite is 

present; this mineral may contribute arsenic to the copper concentrate. About 92% of the 
copper is contained in chalcopyrite whereas tennantite contains 7.5% of the copper. 

 
The cobalt minerals include cobaltite, carrolite and bravoite; cobaltite contains 42% 

of the cobalt. Pyrite represents 45 percent of the sample mass and about 45 percent of the 
cobalt was contained in pyrite at an average concentration of 1320ppm.

The mineral distribution by class of association shows a very complex sulfide 

mineralization; at a grind size of 62 micron chalcopyrite is poorly liberated and strongly 
associated with pyrite and complex multiphase associations. 

  
Cobalt minerals are extremely poorly liberated and strongly associated with pyrite. 

The association between chalcopyrite and cobalt minerals is very weak indicating that the 
recovery of cobalt to the copper concentrate will likely be poor. 

 
The results of these investigations indicated that the Upper Copper Zone copper-

cobalt mineralization is very fine grained and complex requiring a primary grind level of 
80% passing 38micron and a rougher concentrate regrind of 80% passing 8micron for 
effective liberation and recovery of copper minerals to a marketable concentrate using 
otherwise conventional flotation conditions including rougher flotation at pH 9.5 with SIPX 
and 3418A as collectors followed by regrinding and three stage cleaning at pH 11.0 with 
low cyanide additions. 

 
The results of the locked cycle test and the projected metallurgical recovery are 

shown in Table 25-2. 
 

Table 25-2:  Projected Metallurgy - Locked Cycle Test Results   
 

 
 
The results of the locked cycle tests are consistent with the conclusions of the 

mineralogy studies. The projected metallurgy based on the results of a single locked cycle 
tests is only an indication of the plant metallurgy for material of this composition. 

  
Minor element analysis of the concentrate indicated that it contained very low levels 

of potentially deleterious elements; the concentrations of arsenic at 0.4% and at 0.2% 
Co+Ni; are slightly elevated and may incur minor penalties.  The concentrate does not 
contain payable silver and cobalt values. 

 
25.4 Risks and Uncertainties 

 
Copper grades within the drilled mineralized horizons tend to be quite variable even 

within short distances, but in general, copper is typically in excess to 1-2% copper in 
relatively persistent lenses, locally spiking above 10%.  Close spaced drilling from 
underground drill stations will be required to predict local grades. 

 
As pointed out in Section 13, the current metallurgical work suggests that there may 

be several different ore types within the Johnny Lee sulfide system.  Tintina's geologic staff 
will need to coordinate with their metallurgical consultants to determine if an ore type

model can be constructed which will allow for more confidence in potential recoverable 
copper metal. 

 
The authors are not aware of any other significant risks associated with the current 

Indicated and Inferred Resources.  At this juncture there does not appear to be anything 
that would preclude the permitting of this project.  Ongoing testing and cost estimates 
associated will PEA will provide additional insight into the potential risks and uncertainties 
associated with this project.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

 
26.1 General Recommendations 

 
The author highly recommends that Tintina continue to obtain assay certificates and 

QA/QC data for the Cominco American, Utah International, and BHP drilling campaigns.  It 
is the author's opinion that data collected by these companies is valid.  By obtaining the 
assay certificates a significant portion of the older data could be verified and may minimize 
the amount of additional drilling that will need to be completed by Tintina. 

 
Tintina should review their assay QA/QC protocols and institute procedures that will 

allow them to more closely track the performance of blanks and standards.  Assay records 
imported into their database should be scanned for tolerance limits that will flag samples 
associated with blanks or standards that are under or over specified limits.  The cost for 
this are insignificant. 

 
Tintina should continue collecting more bulk density data from unmineralized 

hanging wall material, massive sulfide zones, and unmineralized footwall material.  These 
determinations should be collected for all major rock types that may be mined.  
Confirmatory density determinations should be completed by a certified laboratory for 
representative rock types.  These determinations will also provide an estimate of moisture 
content.  The cost for these tasks is nominal provided that geologists logging core or 
geologic technicians perform the task.  The costs associated with obtaining confirmatory 
bulk density determinations should not amount to more than US$5,000. 

 
Results from recent metallurgical work suggest the presence of several different ore 

types within the Johnny Lee UCZ.  Tintina's geologic staff should work with their 
metallurgical consultants to determine the characteristics of these possible ore types.  The 
goal should be to see if an ore type model can be constructed given the available data.  
After various ore types have been identified, representative samples (10-15 samples each) 
should be assembled from existing drill core and provided to Tintina's metallurgical team 
for testwork.  The costs for this activity are primarily associated with wages paid to 
Tintina's geologic staff members, although if insufficient core is available additional drilling 
maybe required to obtain sufficient material for testwork. 

 
Eventually Tintina will need a more detailed topographic map for the project area.  

The current surface used by RMI fits the surveyed drill hole collars reasonably well and 
this is not a material issue regarding the Inferred Resources that are the subject of this 
report.  In the author's opinion, a detailed aerial survey and subsequent digital terrain 
model will cost between US$15,000 and US$30,000.   

 
26.2 Johnny Lee UCZ 

 
Tintina's should continue working on the Johnny Lee UCZ PEA.  This includes 

estimating mining and processing costs, continuing with metallurgical recovery studies,

preparing a mine plan from the updated estimate of mineral resources, and continuing with 
ongoing environmental data collection and appropriate permitting activities.  The author is 
unable to estimate the costs for these activities. 

 
26.3 Johnny Lee LCZ 

 
In order to see if the current Johnny Lee LCZ Inferred Resources can be upgraded 

to higher confidence limits an infill drilling program must be completed.  A program 
designed to decrease the drill hole spacing in the Johnny Lee LCZ down to 100-meter-
centers is estimated to cost about US$1.8 million. 

 
26.4 Strawberry East 

 
Tintina has been drilling in the Strawberry East area during the later stages of the 

2011 drilling campaign.  As mentioned in Section 25, historic drilling in the Strawberry East 
area has identified possible LSZ and MSZ targets.  The data collected from the 2011 
drilling program will need to be evaluated and preliminary models of mineralized horizons 
constructed.  The cost for these interpretative activities is estimated to range between 
US$5,000 and US$10,000.  An estimate of potential mineral resources should be 
completed after all data and interpretative work have been completed.  The estimated cost 
to prepare an estimate of mineral resources is approximately US$15,000 to US$25,000. 

 
26.5 Mineral Processing 

 
For the next level of the study the following recommendations have been made: 
 
1) The locked cycle test was conducted at a primary grind p80 of 38 micron; at that 

grind level 87% of the copper was recovered to a rougher concentrate with a 
mass recovery of 19%.The mineralogy study of the test feed sample indicated 
that a yet finer primary grind may be beneficial; the optimum primary grind level 
therefore needs to be re-evaluated; 

 
2) The regrind level in the locked cycle test was 8 micron; the mineralogy data 

suggest that a coarser regrind level may be acceptable; this needs to be 
confirmed by flotation tests; 
 

3) Explore alternate reagent schemes to optimize silver and cobalt recoveries; 
 
4) Evaluate a split flow sheet to determine if a copper pre-concentrate can be 

produced at a coarser primary grind thus reducing the risk of overgrinding 
already liberated copper minerals; 

 
5) Sample production for equipment sizing. Tests by equipment suppliers to 

determine regrind mill power, concentrate thickener and filter sizes need to be 
performed on representative samples. These samples need to be produced on a

pilot plant from an overall composite under conditions optimized  in items 1) and 
2); 

 
6) The variability flotation testwork and mineralogy studies showed a significant 

difference in response between sub-composites suggesting the presence of 
more than one ore type; the small number of samples tested does not 
necessarily represent the mineralogy of the UCZ zone. It is therefore required to 
study a much larger suite of samples initially by mineralogy to identify the 
various ore types/ mineralogy present in the deposit. These samples should be 
selected across the horizontal and vertical extent of the mineralization and the 
grade range in order to be representative. About ten to fifteen samples of each 
ore type should be selected in this manner. Composites of each ore type would 
be prepared to determine the flotation response to the already developed 
processing conditions. Preliminary head grade recovery algorithms for each ore 
type will be developed from test results. 

 
7) Comminution tests work test work to determine grinding circuit design 

parameters and tests to determine the variability in ore hardness across the 
deposit; this will include SAG mill design tests on HQ core. Evaluate the two 
stage ball mill grinding circuit with a Verti Mill as the final primary grinding stage. 

 
8) "Galvanox" Process Evaluation. The "Galvanox" process is a hydrometallurgical 

process suited for the recovery of copper and cobalt from pyritic copper 
concentrates. Using this process at the mine site to treat a bulk rougher 
concentrate has the potential to increase the overall copper recovery and 
produce cobalt as a by-product. The evaluation would start with a small number 
of bench scale leach test and could be followed if the results are promising with 
a small scale pilot plant investigation in subsequent study. 

 
The cost estimate for the above scope of work is summarized in Table 26-1.

Activity Estimated Cost
Bench Scale Tests $500,000
Pilot Plant Run $75,000
Comminution Studies $100,000
Equipment Vendor Tests $25,000
Galvanox Bench Tests $10,000
Total $710,000
