SUMMARY 
The Fiskenæsset ruby project consists of three separate property blocks held under one 

exploration license, designated as the Fiskenaesset license 2003/3, totalling 110 square 

kilometres.  True North Gems Inc. acquired exclusive rights to explore and apply for 

development of the property on April 22, 2004 through an option agreement with Brereton 

Engineering and Developments Ltd., of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the underlying holder of the 

exploration license.  True North has prepared and submitted an application for the 

continuance of the exploration license for an additional five year term from 2008-2012, in 

parallel with license transfer application from Brereton to True North.  True North also holds 

the requisite prospecting license, designated 2006/01, granted in February 2006, for 

diamonds and coloured gemstones covering West Greenland.  Given the significant exploration 

potential of the ruby and pink sapphire mineralization in the Fiskenaesset area, True North 

has applied to acquire additional exploration prospects contained within one of the sub-areas 

of the 713 km2 Qaqqatsiaq license application registered by the BMP on June 1, 2007. 

True North's exploration license covers more than twenty ruby occurrences discovered near 

the village of Fiskenæsset.  The corundum occurrences range in size from a single isolated 

occurrence of less than one metre thick and less than 10 metres in length, to arrays of aligned 

occurrences, in parallel to en echelon structures, collectively up to 20 metres thick, and over 

100 metres in length.  The occurrences commonly are located at the upper contact of the 

Fiskenaesset layered anorthosite complex with Archean greenstone terrain, especially 

proximal to altered chrome-bearing ultramafic rocks spatially and genetically associated with 

the anorthosite. 

Corundum is intimately associated variably with chromite, olivine, gedrite, pargasite, 

sapphirine, kornerupine, red spinel, kyanite, fuchsite or mariposite (chrome-bearing mica), 

serpentine and phlogopite.  Of the corundum parageneses identified to date, only the 

hydrothermal and metasomatic styles contain significant concentrations of gem quality 

corundum.  Hydrothermal ruby occurs most notably in outcrop at Aappaluttoq and at several 

other discrete locations northwards along the Ruby Island Line, where euhedral phenocryst 

ruby crystals are enclosed within magnesite or dolomite clots and/or brilliant blue kyanite. 

In addition to detailed geological mapping and prospecting, True North has collected 3-tonne 

mini-bulk samples; in 2004, from Siggartartulik, in 2005 from Lower Angnertusoq, Upper 

Angnertusoq, Kigutilik, Ruby Island and Qaqqatsiaq; in 2006, 30 tonne bulk samples from 

Aappaluttoq and Kigutilik, and in 2007, another 85 tonnes of mineralized overburden and 

bedrock from Aappaluttoq. 

 1



At Siggartartulik, the ruby and pink sapphire combined gem and near-gem rough grade of 

11,878 g/t including 1,204 g/t gem from the measured 2.584 tonne sample clearly warranted 

further exploration.  Both Kigutilik and Upper Angnertusoq returned high rough grades and 

red/pink corundum ratios but a 100 kilogram discovery sample at Aappaluttoq returning 244 

grams of coarse gem grade material and 533 grams of total gem and near-gem highlighted the 

recent exploration efforts.  The 2006 Aappaluttoq bulk sample returned a ruby and pink 

sapphire rough grade of 4,600 g/t including 1,937 g/t gem.  Follow-up results for the 2007 

Aappaluttoq samples are pending though, of note, the processing has generated 574 kilograms 

of concentrates for sorting, rough grade determination, manufacturing tests and independent 

valuation of the clean rough and loose polished rubies and pink sapphires, from three priority 

occurrences. 

Preliminary cutting and polishing of selected rough from 2006 Aappaluttoq has returned gem 

quality faceted material to 5.70 carats valued at US$980 per carat, and independent 

valuations of individual polished stones to $US3,220 per carat reported for a 0.69 carat round 

ruby and $US460 per carat for a 0.96 carat pink sapphire. 

The 2007 diamond core drilling of the Host Zone at the Aappaluttoq occurrence intersected 

visible ruby and pink sapphire mineralization in 18 of 46 holes and extended the strike length 

of the Aappaluttoq occurrence from the known 15-20 metres exposed on surface in the main 

showing to more than 105 metres and to depths of more than 144 metres.  The drilling clearly 

intersected the Host Zone in up to six holes in multiple sections and, below an interval of 

anorthosite gneiss, was followed by a deeper and thicker interval of ultramafics, similar to the 

Host Zone, with phlogopite-rich or pargasite-rich mineralization.  Ruby mineralization within 

the interval, designated the Aappaluttoq Deep Zone, contains the largest ruby and pink 

sapphire crystals, and most abundant in terms of apparent grade, in the drill holes completed 

to date.  Both zones of mineralization are open to depth and along strike; the Aappaluttoq 

Deep Zone is open toward surface for up to 125 metres. 

True North continues to recognize new and growing potential value for the rubies and pink 

sapphires at Fiskenæsset, in part due to timely evolutionary changes in the global ruby trade 

and of course, due to the successful results of its exploration and processing efforts.  The 

Fiskenæsset gemstones respond well to processing, heat treatment, and polishing, and are 

well suited to production of commercial jewellery.  Given the number, rough grade and quality 

of ruby occurrences located in just three full seasons of exploration, the author believes that 

the evaluation of the coloured gemstone potential of the Fiskenæsset district by True North 

Gems is fully warranted, and recommends the exploration program and expenditures as 

outlined herein. 
 2



Wardrop Engineering, an internationally recognized engineering firm, is fully engaged as 

Independent Qualified Person to provide site due diligence, quality assurance, and preparation 

of a Preliminary Economic Assessment Report (PEAR) of the Aappaluttoq ruby occurrence.  

Ramboll Denmark is contracted to provide the requisite baseline data necessary to advance 

directly to supplementary studies comprising an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). 

The objectives of the 2008 exploration program will, to a major degree, build upon the 

successful results of 2004-2007 exploration sampling and the preliminary economic 

assessment report on the highest priority ruby occurrence, Aappaluttoq, known from among 

those located thus far in the Fiskenæsset ruby district of southwestern Greenland.  Key 

development program components will comprise advanced exploration and grade drilling, pilot 

processing, engineering and environmental studies, process flowsheet development, and 

process plant design engineering.  The property-scale exploration program will include 

exploration drilling and detailed mapping of the 1.5 kilometre strike length attributed to the 

folded limb of the Fiskenæsset layered complex containing the highly prospective 

Siggartartulik occurrence, additional property exploration on the Fiskenæsset license to follow 

up on significant results from the 2007 channel sampling, and regional exploration on the 

adjacent Qaqqatsiaq license, pending its approval. 

The proposed exploration budget for the 2008 True North Gems exploration program is 

approximately C$9,500,000 (DKK 47.500.000,00) with the field season running from June 1 

to September 30.

INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
True North Gems Inc., a Canadian company, commenced exploration of the Fiskenæsset ruby 

project with an option agreement, completed with Brereton Engineering and Holdings Ltd., to 

earn 100% interest on the Fiskenæsset exploration license in 2004. 

True North has carried out exploration programs in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 with 

expenditures increasing on an annual basis.  The increased scope and budget of the programs 

was fully warranted by the successful results, and was approved and recommended by the 

project manager, including the author during the recently completed 2007 program. 

The 2007 field schedule, including the forward site visits, ran from May 7th through to the 

final shipment of rock samples and drill core on October 24th and the final site management 

and storage of equipment and empty fuel drums on November 13th. 

This report, prepared by the author who held the position of True North project manager (see 

Statement of Qualifications), documents all 2006 and 2007 field activities completed on the 

Fiskenæsset ruby project on the southwest coast of Greenland with respect to gemstone 

exploration carried out on Prospecting License 2006/01 and Fiskenæsset exploration license 

2003/03.  This report was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 

regulations and companion policies regarding technical reporting in Canada, and is in 

accordance with annual reporting required by the Greenland Bureau of Mines and Petroleum 

(BMP).  The contained information is deemed complete for the period up to December 1, 2007. 

As per standard reporting protocols, this report also contains a compilation of information 

gleaned from two earlier 43-101 reports (Rohtert, 2005; Rohtert, 2006) which were prepared to 

cover exploration and mineral processing activities during 2004 and 2005 by True North 

Gems. 

This report also updates laboratory processing, manufacturing activity and initial independent 

valuation of loose polished goods from the 2004, 2005 and 2006 mini-bulk samples. 

To date, the 2007 concentrate samples are awaiting secure transport from Nuuk whereas the 

2007 bulk samples are in secure transit by container ship to Canada.  Secure delivery to 

Canada for all samples in transit is scheduled during December 2007. 

Qualified terms of reference used herein are consistent and common to the international 

gemstone trade and accordingly, are applied to international gemstone exploration.  

Specifically, for the purposes of this report, for all corundum reported from the field and 

laboratory observations up to and including all physical beneficiation processes, 'gem' refers to 

naturally transparent corundum; 'near-gem' refers to naturally translucent corundum; and 

 4



'non-gem' refers to naturally opaque corundum.  Additionally, the gemstones will be 

referenced under the following units of measure - rough material will be weighed in grams or 

kilograms, rough grades in grams per tonne or kilograms per tonne, whereas in the standard 

terminology for polished or otherwise finished goods, one carat refers specifically to 200 

milligrams or 0.20 grams in weight where the referenced value for the average density of 

corundum is 4.00 g/cm3. 

 

RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
The author has relied on field observations, geological, geochemical, metallurgical and

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

LOCATION 
The 3,600 square-kilometre Fiskenæsset layered complex is located on the southwest coast of 

Greenland, about 160 kilometres south-southeast of the capitol at Nuuk.  The Greenland 

location map is shown in Figure 1.  The general area of interest measures some 60 kilometres 

by 60 kilometres in plan, and covers portions of three (3) contiguous, regional 1:100,000 map 

sheets:  (1) Bjornesund 62 V. 1 Nord; (2) Graedefjord 63 V. 1 Syd; and, (3) Sinarssuk 63 V. 2 

Syd (GEUS 1980, 1982, 1985).  True North's 110 square kilometre exploration license, held 

under option agreement (Appendix 1) comprises three separate sub-areas covering parts 

within each of the three regional map sheets.  The principal sub-area is centred around 63 

degrees N longitude and 50 degrees 25 minutes W latitude. 

Overall, the largest sub-area of the exploration license is located from less than 2 kilometres 

to 22 kilometres from Fiskenaesset with the two smaller sub-areas located 40-kilometres and 

55 kilometres east of Fiskenaesset.  The focus of the exploration, currently at the Aappaluttoq 

occurrence, lies approximately 20 kilometres south-southeast from the village of Fiskenæsset.

Fiskenæsset serves as the forward base for True North's field operations and provides for local 

housing, office and plant facilities. 

CLAIM DESCRIPTION 
A Prospecting Licence is requisite for companies actively exploring for minerals in Greenland 

and grants the owner non-exclusive rights to explore for mineral resources outside of an 

exploration licence area.  Exploration licenses are required for exclusive access to an area and 

are acquired by application to the Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum (BMP) and the requisite 

Greenland and Denmark government departments, including the Joint Committee for Mineral 

Resources, with final approval by the Minister responsible for Mineral Resources and the 

Environment in Denmark. 

True North holds a Prospector's License, designated No. 2006/01, issued by the BMP in 2006, 

for all coloured gemstones in West Greenland (Appendix 2).  The area covers all of onshore 

Greenland south of 78°N latitude and west of 44°W longitude as shown in Figure 2. 

The Fiskenæsset ruby property currently consists of one Exploration License, designated No. 

2003/03, registered with the (BMP) of the Government of Greenland in the name of Brereton 

Engineering & Developments Ltd. (hereafter Brereton), of Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Figure 3, 

Appendix 3).  The option agreement between Brereton and True North is discussed under the 

section entitled "Current Agreements, Royalties and Encumbrances". 

An application for transfer of the license from Brereton to True North was submitted in 

November 2007, with all requisite documentation from both parties.  The application for 

transfer documents were prepared and reviewed by the author, and are available upon 

request. 

The license area is bounded by a polygon with the vertices listed in Table 1 and shown in 

Figure 3.

The original exploration license, which was granted for a five year period, was awarded to 

Brereton by the BMP in March 2003 and expires on 31 December 2007.  Due to the early filing 

and award dates, 2003 was designated as Year 1 in the term of the license.  Sub-areas 1 and 

2, comprising 95 square kilometres and 9 square kilometres, respectively, for a total 104 

square kilometres, were included in the initial license approval (see Figure 3). 

Sub-area 3, comprising an area of 6 square kilometres, was submitted for application by 

Brereton on behalf of True North, subsequent to the option agreement with Brereton in April 

2004 (see Figure 3).  Final approval for the inclusion of sub-area 3 within the existing 

exploration license 2003/03 was received from BMP in August 2004.  The expiry date for this 

enlarged license remained at December 31, 2007. 

In order to maintain the license in good standing, license fees and exploration expenditures 

must be incurred on an annual basis with reporting due by April 1st of the following year.  A 

fixed base fee, which increases during the term of the license, and a variable fee determined 

by a multiple of the size of the license in square kilometres, also increasing over the life of the 

license, together comprise the minimum expenditure required for the license.  The minimum 

expenditure required to meet the BMP guidelines for the Fiskenæsset license are summarized 

in Table 2 (average 2006/2007 exchange rate DKK5,00=CAD$1.00). 

Table 2.  Minimum Expenditure Requirements 

 Year Fixed Fee DKK Area Fee DKK ~CAD$ 
 1-2 100.000,00 110.000,00 42,000.00 
 3-5 200.000,00 550.000,00 150,000.00 
 6-10 400.000,00 1.100.000,00 300,000.00 
 

Carry-forward provisions are in effect for over-expenditures for a period of up to three years 

from the interval during which the expenditures were incurred.  This provision remains in 

effect for licenses subject to continuance from Year 5 to Year 6 and beyond as is the situation 

with the Fiskenæsset license.  To date, True North has documentation, received from BMP, to 

confirm such over-expenditures during the recent exploration seasons (see Table 5).  These 

documents have been reviewed and confirmed by the author, and are available upon request. 

The license holder is entitled to be granted a new license for the same area and mineral 

resources, in whole or in part, at the end of the license period provided timely receipt of the 

application to BMP prior to December 31 in Year 5 and provided all terms of the license 

remain in compliance with the BMP regulations. 

 9



Application to the BMP for continuation of the license for years 6 through 10 were prepared 

and submitted by the author in November 2007.  The application documents were prepared 

and approved by the author, and are available upon request. 

Given the significant exploration potential of the ruby and pink sapphire mineralization in the 

Fiskenaesset area, True North has taken steps to acquire additional exploration prospects not 

covered by current licenses, specifically the Fiskenaesset, Akunnaat and Allumersat licenses, 

held by True North through Brereton and the latter two by Crew Gold Corporation, 

respectively.  Both Bjornesund and Qororssuaq are contained within one of the sub-areas of 

the Qaqqatsiaq license application registered by the BMP on June 1, 2007 (see Figure 4).  The 

license area is bounded by a polygon with the vertices listed in Table 3. 

True North's application provides for acquisition of an additional 713 km2 exploration license 

contiguous with and adjacent to its 110 km2 Fiskenaesset license.  The license application 

consists of five separate property blocks (designated sub-areas) strategically located to cover 

known ruby occurrences and prospective geology for ruby mineralization in the Fiskenaesset 

District.  The formal ratification of the license application by the BMP and the requisite 

Greenland/Denmark government authorities, is expected in December 2007 and the 

acquisition will bring True North's total land position to 823 km2.

CURRENT AGREEMENTS, ROYALTIES AND ENCUMBRANCES 
The Fiskenæsset license is subject to an Option Agreement dated April 22, 2004 between 

Brereton Engineering and Developments Ltd. and True North Gems Inc., wherein True North 

has an option to acquire a 100 percent interest in the exploration license (see Appendix 1).  

The exploration license was approved initially by BMP in March 2003. 

Over a four year period, True North is required to pay Brereton CAD$150,000 and deliver 

CAD$150,000 worth of Company treasury shares as indicated in Table 4; to date, True North 

has met its obligations under the terms of the agreement and as of December 1, 2007 has 

paid CAD$100,000 and delivered CAD$100,000 worth of Company treasury shares. 

Table 4.  Option Agreement Payment Schedule 

 Schedule Cash Shares Status 
 Exchange Approval CAD$25,000 CAD$25,000  
 December 31, 2004 CAD$25,000 CAD$25,000  
 December 31, 2005 CAD$25,000 CAD$25,000  
 December 31, 2006 CAD$25,000 CAD$25,000  
 December 31, 2007 CAD$50,000 CAD$50,000 pending 
 

The final payment of CAD$50,000 and delivery of CAD$50,000 worth of Company treasury 

shares is due and payable on December 31,2007. 

True North will be required to complete all exploration and assessment work on the Property 

mandated by BMP, representing the Greenland government (see Table 4), to exceed a 

minimum of CAD$150,000 per year.  As of December 1, 2007, True North has exceeded its 

obligations for expenditures on an annual basis and currently maintains a credit balance of 

DKK33.773.270,00 (approx. CAD$6,725,000) from 2005 and 2006, as shown in Table 5, 

which remain in effect through 2008 and 2009, respectively. 

Table 5.  Exploration Credits on Fiskenaesset License 

 Year Credit DKK Credit CAD$ 
 2005 11.013.264,00 2,193,000 
 2006 22.760.005,00 4,532,000 
 

If at the end of four years, True North acquires the exploration license by fulfilling the terms of 

the option agreement, and then elects to advance the Property to an exploitation license, True 

North will disburse to Brereton a one-time payment of CAD$500,000 plus CAD$500,000 

worth of Company treasury shares.  If, however, True North acquires the exploration license, 

but elects not to advance to an exploitation license and, instead, extends the exploration 

 15



license, True North will continue to pay Brereton CAD$50,000 per year plus CAD$50,000 

worth of Company treasury shares for each annual extension. 

Based on the level of exploration expenditures, which has exceeded the terms of the option 

agreement and its forthright annual payments of common shares to Brereton, the author 

expects that True North will acquire the license by meeting, in full, the terms and obligations 

of the option agreement as of December 31, 2007 and to that end, has prepared the requisite 

documentation with respect to the pending acquisition.  As of November 2007, True North has 

prepared and submitted an application for the continuance of the exploration license, in 

parallel with license transfer documentation in preparation by both Brereton and True North. 

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND MINERAL TITLES 
The exploration license, designated 2003/03, is currently held in the name of Brereton 

Engineering & Developments, Ltd., of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, pending completion of the 

terms of Option Agreement between Brereton and True North. 

In the interim period, all of the exploration project documentation, such as the annual plan of 

operations submitted for approval by the BMP, are registered in the name of True North Gems 

Inc., of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  Timely review and distribution of pertinent 

documents, specifically relative to the annual plan of operations and financial matters, such 

as BMP oversight and approval of annual exploration expenditures, is afforded to True North 

by Brereton. 

An application for transfer of the license from Brereton to True North was prepared in 

November 2007, with all requisite documentation from both parties.  The application for 

transfer documents has been approved by Brereton and the author, and is available upon 

request. 

As noted in the previous sections, True North has taken steps to acquire additional 

exploration prospects not covered by current licenses, specifically the Fiskenæsset, Akunnaat 

and Allumersat licenses, held by True North through Brereton and the latter two by Crew Gold 

Corporation, respectively.  The Qaqqatsiaq license application was submitted on May 27, 

2007, was registered by the BMP on June 1, 2007 (see Figure 4) and final approval is expected 

in December 2007.  True North's application provides for acquisition of an additional 713 km2 

exploration license contiguous with and adjacent, in part, to its 110 km2 Fiskenæsset license.

ACCESSIBILITY, LOCAL RESOURCES & INFRASTRUCTURE 
The Fiskenæsset mining district encompasses 3,600 square kilometres along the southwest 

coast of Greenland (Illustration 1), about 160 kilometres south of the capital, Nuuk.  The 

capital city, with a population of approximately 16,000 people, provides the centre for the 

majority of the merchandising, financial, industrial, telecommunications, government, 

shipping, aircraft and other support services in Greenland.  Electrical power is provided via 

lines from hydroelectric facilities located approximately 55 kilometres south-southeast of 

Nuuk. 

Scheduled jet air service from Copenhagen, Denmark is the principal access to Kangerlussuaq 

or Narsarsuaq with turboprop access to Nuuk and the major outlying communities of 

Greenland. 

The village of Fiskenæsset (now known as Qeqertarsuatsiaat) shown in Illustration 2, lying at 

the northwest corner of the mining district, is the year-round home to some 240 inhabitants, 

who are employed mainly in the small scale fishing industry.  The government of Greenland 

maintains a medical clinic and an extended care treatment facility for the elderly at 

Fiskenaesset.  Electrical power is provided, as required by seasonal conditions, by one to four 

diesel generators and a relatively low level restricted grid. 

There is no air strip at Fiskenaesset, but the full-service commercial harbour is ice-free year 

round.  Regularly scheduled boat and helicopter service routinely move people, mail, and 

supplies along the southwest coast of Greenland, including the maritime ferry at the village of 

Fiskenaesset, the latter requiring a 7-12 hour trip from Nuuk.  Helicopter service is generally 

limited to medivac, or rarely, unscheduled charter operations.  Maritime freight services 

provide close to year round shipping services for importation of equipment and supplies, 

though offloading equipment is limited to ship-based cranes.  Barge shipments with forward 

doors for direct beach deliveries are required to provide the optimal system for major 

equipment shipments. 

Currently, there is no infrastructure of any kind on the license (Illustrations 3 and 4).  The 

nearest facilities are 2-15 minutes away by helicopter and 10-50 minutes by sea-going vessel 

from the license in the village of Fiskenaesset.  Travel to Nuuk by charter helicopter typically 

requires 45-60 minutes depending upon weather conditions, particularly fog, wind and snow 

squalls common during the summer field season.

The ruby occurrences identified to date in the Fiskenæsset district are best accessed by 

chartered helicopter, with flight distances from the village to the ruby occurrences ranging 

from 5 to 55 kilometres. 

In 2006, five True North personnel and up to ten local hires from Fiskenaesset and Nuuk 

worked on the exploration program.  The majority of the local personnel were contracted 

through Greenland Resources who co-ordinated project logistics, expediting, and 

subcontracting of labour and consultants.  Transport of crew, supplies and material to and 

from the field was by helicopter based from housing and office facilities in Fiskenaesset, 

primarily an A-Star Model B contracted from Air Greenland, and by fast boat contracted in 

Nuuk.  All personnel and operations were conducted in and from Fiskenaesset on a daily 

basis, weather permitting.  Based on the activity logs, more than twenty days were lost during 

the field season, running from June 19 to September 4, due to inclement weather with rain, 

high winds and/or fog. 

In 2007, True North managed operations from its small logistics base in the village of 

Fiskenaesset, which included the sample processing plant, and a geological base camp near 

Lake Tassiusa, close to the site of the exploration drilling program (see Illustration 5). 

In 2007, the helicopter, a B-3 A-Star with space for five persons including pilot, and an 

optimal lift capacity of approximately 1100 kilograms, was based at the Ruby Island field 

camp, within walking distance to Aappaluttoq, to facilitate expedited movement of the drill 

and geological personnel, particularly due to the detrimental impact of the maritime weather 

conditions on flight scheduling and minimum ceiling limits.  A Sikorsky S-61 was required for 

periodic special transport for site visits, secure shipment of drill core and concentrates with 

BMP representatives and supply support. 

Additionally, the base camp and ruby showings were accessed from numerous tidal fjords 

along the coastline by rental of small vessels with operators based in Fiskenaesset. 

The level of personnel in the overall field crew was approximately 30 individuals, of which 10-

12 were technical and 10-20 were support, and more than 70% are local Greenlanders or 

contracted through Greenlandic companies, including process plant and equipment operators, 

drilling assistants, geological support for drill core handling, cook, air transport, water 

transport, environmental consulting, permitting and expediting.  A crew rotation was utilized, 

as possible, to provide more opportunities for training of the Fiskenaesset villagers for process 

plant operations and diamond drilling.  Up to eight persons per day were required for the 

plant operations.  Of note, the people speak Greenlandic as their first language, Danish as 

 18



their second and a few people spoke a bit of English.  Two locals fluent in all languages were 

recruited on an ad hoc basis for translation of operational, safety and security issues. 

Supplies were purchased in Fiskenaesset, where possible, though the majority of the 

equipment, food and general construction supplies were expedited from Nuuk. 

Fuel, including diesel for the camp generator and jet fuel for the helicopter, was delivered by 

boat, or helicopter from Fiskenaesset as required, and was contained within a storage area 

located near Lake Tassiusa and near Tassiusa Gate at a location suitable for sea-going 

delivery and helicopter loading.  The fuel cache was shared with Crew Gold who also 

conducted exploration programs in the region during the 2007 operating season.  In return, 

Crew Gold's fuel supply in Fiskenaesset was used in full by True North Gems upon completion 

of Crew Gold's field program.  Fuel was shuttled, only as required, by long line sling to the 

field camp and the drill. 

The personnel, including all local hires, were trained fully in the safe handling and operation 

of plant and other equipment, helicopter operations including general access guidelines, 

management of heavy sling-loads and moving drills by personnel and contractors in their 

particular areas of expertise. 

The Air Greenland pilots were versed in company policy to ensure safe operations at all 

locations, particularly within the village of Fiskenaesset and while moving samples and 

equipment near the drilling and bulk sampling sites.  Extensive experience was gained by the 

Air Greenland pilots in slinging operations for samples, drill equipment and fuel.  All activities 

were carried out without incident during 355 hours recorded in the detailed flight log for True 

North Gems.  Approximately 24 hours were recorded for Crew Gold, during a period of shared 

services, in July 2007. 

In terms of Fiskenaesset-based activities, the plant site is located on property leased by and 

adjacent to the work shop of a local individual and the Nuuk Kommunea.  At the plant site, 

True North has use of an unfenced industrial section of land approximately 22 meters by 28 

meters therefore operational hours were constrained by noise concerns.  As electrical access to 

the Fiskenaesset grid was limited by line capacity, and time and cost constraints for 

preparation of a new, self contained and buried power line direct from the generators to the 

plant, a rental generator was required (see description of plant operations under Mineral 

Processing and Metallurgical Testwork).  To minimize noise levels in the community, the plant 

generator was normally operated only between the hours of 6 AM and 8 PM.  A small pond, 

located about 300 metres from the site, provided reasonable access to a fresh water supply for 

the plant.  Due to the small size of the plant site and the safety concerns associated with the 

 19



helicopter delivering bulk samples from the field to the plant site, the adjacent property was 

rented and used as a delivery point and storage location for bulk samples.  Both diesel and 

gasoline are purchased locally with other supplies on order from Nuuk and beyond.  The town 

garbage dump proved very helpful as a supply depot. 

Local equipment available for rental at commercial rates included the small Case 580 

backhoe, a small Hitachi EX 8 excavator with a Piccolo rock-breaker attachment and more 

recently, a Caterpillar 926 front end loader.  The Case backhoe worked well for feeding the jaw 

and cleaning out pond #1 and moving and cleaning up around the plant.  The small hoe with 

the rock-breaker was used for breaking over-sized boulders that were oversized for feeding the 

primary jaw.  The Nuuk Kommunea retains a two small 509 front end loaders, also for rental 

at commercial rates.  The latter worked well for moving super sacs of material and boulders to 

and from the storage area and to the large platform scale. 

The close proximity to the community, along with issues concerning physical space 

requirements for equipment, operations and sample storage, noise, mobile equipment access, 

lack of suitable road networks and maritime loading facilities, safety and security, helicopter 

access, electrical power, potential tailings facilities, and support facilities must be addressed 

as the project moves forward with exploration and development planning.  In short, in 

consideration of the proposed increase in bulk sampling for 2008 and beyond, including the 

requirements and limitations noted above, the author believes that True North would be better 

suited to ramping the scale of the process facilities in an alternate location. 

 20



CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
The climate of Fiskenæsset is identical to the climate of Nuuk, both are classified as:  Low 

Arctic Maritime.  Average monthly temperatures do not exceed 10 degrees Celsius and 

summer nights are typically frost-free for 60 days a year.  Winters lows are typically -8 to -12 

degrees Celsius.  At Summer Solstice, there are more than 20 hours of daylight.  Precipitation 

averages around 900 mm per year, mixed rain and snow, with most of the accumulation 

typically falling between August and November. 

The Irminger Current, a northern tongue of the warm Gulf Stream, is responsible for 

modulating the weather and keeping the sea lanes open.  Maximum historic tidal variations in 

the inner harbour of Fiskenaesset are up to three metres.  Conditions along the coast are 

often cloudy, with fog to the waterline, especially in the summer months.  Conditions are 

typically dryer and relatively warmer proceeding inland up the fjords, but inland under clear 

conditions extremely strong katabaric winds can flow off the icecap (Piteraq) or descend from 

mountain massifs (Foehn). 

Topographic relief in the Fiskenæsset district measures from sea level to 1,440 metres in 

elevation.  The majority of the area of interest ranges from <100 metres to 350 metres in 

elevation.  Aappaluttoq, the target of the Preliminary Economic Assessment is located 230 

metres to 240 metres above mean sea levels (see Illustration 3).  The highest peak summit is 

Qaqqatsiaq; Qaggse Mountain northwest of Lake Tassiusa exceeds 1,010 metres and was 

utilized for True North's wireless communications equipment during the 2007 operating 

season (see Illustrations 3 and 4, Figure 5). 

The richest plant growth is found in the sub-arctic belt, which includes only the southernmost 

part of Greenland and the inner fjords.  The majority of southern and southwestern Greenland 

has diverse mountain vegetation reminiscent of northern Europe though the driest inland 

areas exhibit vegetation similar to mountainous regions of North America. 

The vegetation in the specific area worked by True North is scarce.  Locally, one can observe 

dense bush patches no taller than 10cm and a predominance of local grasses, lichens and 

mosses.  An abundance of colourful and exotic flowers and berries occur during the short 

summer season. 

Local wildlife was limited to few sightings of reindeer, brown foxes and gulls, with small cod 

and Atlantic salmon/char reported from tidal Lake Tassiusa.  The local population are avid 

hunters and fishermen; reindeer hunting on the license area was reported near the base camp 

at Lake Tassiusa.

EXPLORATION HISTORY 

EXPLORATION 1966 - 2003 
Beginning in the mid-1960's and extending through the 1970's, the world-famous 

Fiskenæsset cumulate anorthosite complex was investigated extensively for its chrome and 

platinum potential by geoscientists from academia and industry, among them:  Ghisler and 

Windley (1967); Kalsbeek (1971); Windley and others (1973); Windley (1973); Walton (1973); 

Windley and Smith (1974); Kalsbeek and others (1974); Windley (1976); Ghisler (1976a, 

1976b); Steele and others (1977); Bishop and others (1980); Ackermand and others (1984); 

Meyers, 1985 and Appel (1992a-c) and Appel (1994). 

In summary, the studies referenced above described and identified a non-economic chromium 

deposit consisting of layered, chromite-cumulate horizons within anorthosite distributed over 

approximately 1,200 square kilometres.  At Qeqertarssuatsiaq, preliminary reserve estimates 

included the drill definition of 2.5 million tonnes with an average grade of 32.7 percent Cr2O3 

and a Cr/Fe ratio of 0.85/1.  Significant platinum, titanium, and vanadium values also were 

reported.  Metallurgical testwork reported low quality Cr concentrates, which were generally 

unsuitable for market, and further development of the region was abandoned. 

In 1966, ruby was discovered in outcrop on Ruby Island by Martin Ghisler with the Geological 

Survey of Greenland and Denmark (GEUS).  Ghisler's exploration team discovered ruby in 

association with sapphirine, kornerupine, pargasite and phlogopite, confirming six locations in 

the district. 

Intermittently, beginning in 1969 and extending through 1995, a succession of private 

Danish-Canadian companies, including Platinomino A/S and Fiscanex Ltd., both headed by 

Robert Geisler from Toronto, Canada, and Valhalla Mining Limited, a British Virgin Islands 

registered company, attempted to explore and commercialize the ruby occurrences at 

Fiskenæsset.  Geisler's companies (hereafter Geisler), succeeded in confirming gemstones at 

five of the six ruby occurrences reported by the GEUS, the Geological Survey of Greenland and 

Denmark (Geisler, 1976a, 1976b, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983).  A comprehensive summary 

of the early exploration and sample processing is provided by Anderson (1995). 

Based on Anderson (1995) and a review of the Geisler reports (Geisler, 1976a, 1976b, 1979, 

1980, 1981, 1982, 1983), it is reported that these companies extracted as much as 50 tonnes 

of ruby-bearing material from several separate ruby occurrences:  Siggartartulik; Upper 

Angnertusoq; Kangarssuk, Puilassut Qavat, Qaqqatsiaq (then called "Walton"); Frog, Beer 

Mountain and Kigutilik (then called "Tanqueray or Tanguay"). 

 23



Much of the tonnage removed in 1980, estimated at 33 tonnes, remains stored in Canada 

Samples were collected from Siggartartulik (18.6 tonnes), Upper Angnertusoq (2.7 tonnes), 

Walton (2.8 tonnes) and Tanguay (8.5 tonnes). 

Most importantly from a gemstone perspective, in 1979, Geisler succeeded in collecting a 1.36 

tonne mini-bulk sample at the Siggartartulik ruby occurrence that was processed down to 

72.3 kilograms of gravity concentrate.  The concentrate rendered 340 grams of ruby rough, 

including 21 grams of facet-grade polishing stock, which equals out to a reported 15.44 grams 

per tonne gem. 

A limited number of Greenland rubies were cut from the hand-select high grade by Tony 

Wobito, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The largest faceted gem produced by Wobito weighed 

1.51 carats, although the remainder of the stones were less than 50 points in weight.  Early 

cabochons were cut to 3 carats. 

Additional documentation of the processing conducted on these samples is discussed in the 

references noted above, though useful quantitative data is limited by a paucity of firm material 

balances.  Additionally, significant amounts of the mineralized material were released for 

marketing and process metallurgical testwork with incomplete or minimal reporting available 

in the public realm. 

Limited process testing was carried out during the late 1980's and early 1990's at Lakefield 

Research (now SGS Minerals Services), in part conducted by the author, while employed by 

Lakefield Research as a process mineralogist and project manager, primarily for the 

production of fine powder alumina oxide concentrates.  To the author's knowledge, the results 

have not been released to the public realm. 

Geisler's property holdings at Fiskenæsset lapsed in 1984, on expiry of the five year license 

granted in 1979, and the area sat idle until the economic potential of the ruby mineralization 

was evaluated by a small exploration program conducted in 1994 (Anderson, 1995). 

Geological mapping of three occurrences, Siggartartulik, Tanguay and Upper Angnertusoq, 

was completed with site visits completed to six of the known occurrences, including Lower 

Angnertusoq, Ruby Island and Puilassut Qavat, and the three fore-mentioned occurrences, 

and a follow-up proposal for the process testwork on the mini-bulk samples was prepared. 

The work identified Siggartartulik as the first priority target on the basis of continuity of 

mineralization, coloration and size of the contained rubies, along with Kigutilik, which 

displayed the best coloration and size of ruby mineralization though continuity of the 

occurrence along strike was limited.  Upper Angnertusoq exhibited approximately 200 metres 

 24



along strike with variable amounts of ruby mineralization whereas Lower Angnertusoq was of 

limited interest with its small extent and poor quality corundum.  Further work at Ruby 

Island, known the Rubin Ø showing, and Puilassut Qavat, was not warranted due, in the 

former, to lack of continuity and surface area, and, in the latter, paucity and small size of the 

corundum generally associated with structurally controlled platings on anorthosite.  The 

exploration highlighted the potential for additional showings and also for alluvial 

accumulations of rubies in lakes down slope from known occurrences, specifically 

Siggartartulik, though the potential for exposed and accessible occurrences are limited by the 

steep geomorphologies of the fjord-dominated shoreline. 

A total of 450 kilograms of ruby material, including 300 kilograms from Siggartartulik, 150 

kilograms from two sites at Tanguay (Kangarssuk) and 150 kilograms from two sites at Upper 

Angnertusoq, was extracted by the program operator, MPH Consulting Limited, based in 

Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  To the author's knowledge, no records of further work on the 

property or the samples extracted from the three occurrences were filed with the BMP. 

EXPLORATION 2003 - 2006 
A new exploration license for a similar area was awarded to Brereton Engineering and 

Developments Ltd., in March 2003, who had worked as subcontractors in the exploration and 

evaluation of the ruby property, through MPH Consulting, with both companies directed by 

the same management team. 

After a review of available information from the public filings and from the previous operators 

including Geisler and MPH, by True North during 2003 and 2004, and as noted in previous 

sections, in April 2004, True North entered into an option agreement with Brereton to operate 

the exploration and acquire the property subject to the requisite payments and expenditures. 

True North (Rohtert 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007; Rohtert and Pemberton, 2004) recognized 

new and growing potential value for the rubies and pink sapphires at Fiskenæsset in part due 

to timely evolutionary changes in the global ruby trade and of course, due to the successful 

results of exploration and processing, as discussed below. 

In 2004, the exploration program was focused on due diligence sampling of Siggartartulik and 

initial investigations of the known showings reported by the previous operators including the 

first six which were located on the license and an additional four other occurrences as 

tabulated below (Tables 6 and 7).

The principal purpose of the 2004 work program was to collect a mini-bulk sample, to confirm 

the quality and grade of the Siggartartulik material, and to provide feed material for 

beneficiation testwork and potential gemstone manufacturing experiments (heating, cutting, 

polishing, etc.).  For simplicity of presentation of several years of progressive geological 

studies, the geological mapping data is compiled under "Exploration 2007". 

During August 2004, True North's field crew collected a 3-tonne mini-bulk sample from the 

Siggartartulik ruby occurrence (Table 7).  It consisted of bedrock and float components 

comprising 2.6 tonnes and 0.45 tonnes, respectively.  Diamond chain saws were used to 

carefully excavate 2,584 kilograms of ruby mineralization from measured targets at four 

cutting sites separated along 120 metres of mineralized strike length.  In addition to the 

measured mini-bulk sample, True North also collected 450 kilograms of loose mineralized float 

from the surface in the immediate vicinity of the four cutting sites.  This comprised the 0.450 

tonne float 2004 mini-bulk sample.  The process metallurgy is described under the section 

"Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testwork".  To summarize the pertinent results, the 

ruby and pink sapphire combined gem and near-gem components reported a rough grade of 

11,878 g/t including 1,204 g/t gem.  A total of 3,109 grams of gem and 27,582 grams of near-

gem ruby and pink sapphire were recovered from the measured 2.584 tonne sample.  The 

quality and the grade of ruby and pink sapphire mineralization at Siggartartulik warranted 

further exploration.

In 2005, based on the successful results of the Siggartartulik sample program, True North 

expanded the reconnaissance of the Fiskenæsset district for diamond and coloured gemstone 

deposits.  Kigutilik and Aappaluttoq were re-discovered and officially reported to the 

Government of Greenland via the Bureau of Mines and Petroleum (BMP) by True North Gems 

Inc. in 2005.  Kigutilik had been worked briefly by Geisler's company Platinomino in the 

1980's (Geisler, 1981, 1982, 1983; Anderson, 1994).  Aappaluttoq had been noted briefly in 

the field sheets and geological maps by Pulvertaft (1970) and other Danish government 

geologists working with the GEUS in the early 1970's, but apparently was never published in 

any official reports.  Both of these important occurrences were confirmed in literature 

searches at GEUS in 2006 and 2007. 

Additionally in 2005, True North collected a suite of mini-bulk samples to test the value and 

the grade of five ruby and pink sapphire occurrences in the Fiskenæsset district (Table 7).  

The sampling program focused on several ruby and pink sapphire occurrences with the 

objective of determining the variability between showings.  A total of 15 metric tonnes, with 

three tonnes or one cubic metre (1m3) per site as per the standard sampling limitations 

approved by the BMP, were collected and all samples were shipped to Canada for initial 

processing followed by optical sorting at SGS Cornwall. 

In summary, the feed weighing 14.750 tonnes was reduced to 889 kilograms of DMS 

concentrate along with 29.3 kilograms of mixed hand selected mineralization and 9.6 

kilograms of liberated ruby and pink sapphire.  The combination of DMS, magnetics and 

optical sorting was highly successful in terms of weight rejection; the latter, in combination 

with tumbling, indicated excellent potential for the clean separation of dark red, red and pink 

components of the ruby and sapphire mineralization.  Weight recovery, after all stages of 

primary processing, ranged up to a maximum of 0.50% of the overall feed (Kigutilik) with 

highly variable proportions of ruby and pink sapphire by sample and size fraction. 

The best results were obtained from the Kigutilik and Upper Angnertusoq localities, with the 

former selected for large scale bulk sampling in 2006.  The process testwork program and 
 27



tabulated results are described under the section "Mineral Processing and Metallurgical 

Testwork". 

The highlight of the 2005 season was the August 16th discovery, of the Aappaluttoq ("Big Red") 

ruby occurrence about 3.5 kilometres south of Ruby Island, where rubies had been reported 

by Ghisler in 1966 and during geological mapping of the Ruby Island Line by Pulvertaft in 

1970 (Illustration 6).  Due to the constraints of scheduling and having achieved the 15 tonne 

sampling quota permitted for 2005, only a 1000 kilogram sample of regolithic material and the 

mantle talus was collected in 2005 to confirm the discovery.  During 2005, a 100 kilogram 

sub-sample was processed by screening in the field.  The remainder of the sample (900 kg) 

was stored under secure conditions in Fiskenæsset until June 2006; processing was 

undertaken with the 2006 Aappaluttoq material in the original on-site plant in July 2006.  In 

summary, hand washing, screening and sorting of the 100 kilogram discovery parcel returned 

244 grams of coarse gem grade material and 533 grams of total gem and near-gem.  

Additionally, a single 40 gram ruby recovered from the Aappaluttoq overburden in August 

2005.  The tabulated results are described under the section "Mineral Processing and 

Metallurgical Testwork". 

In addition to the soil and talus material collected from the surface immediately superjacent to 

the discovery outcrop, True North collected 1.7 tonnes of ruby-bearing rock material for 

geological assessment.  The 1,700 kg sample was processed as part of the 30 tonne sample 

collected from Aappaluttoq in 2006 and the results are provided in the section on "Mineral 

Processing and Metallurgical Testwork". 

Through 2005, prospecting and geological mapping efforts have confirmed eighteen ruby 

occurrences discovered or re-located in the district with thirteen occurrences lying within the 

Fiskenæsset license.  True North has focused primarily on the six occurrences, with five tested 

by 3 tonne mini-bulk samples collected in 2005, plus three additional occurrences scheduled 

for testing in 2006. 

These nine priority targets include Siggartartulik, tested in 2004; Lower Angnertusoq; Upper 

Angnertusoq; Kigutilik; Ruby Island, and Qaqqatsiaq, all tested in 2005; and Aappaluttoq, 

Qaqqat Aquleriit, and Kangarssuk, to be tested in 2006.  Of these, only Aappaluttoq and 

Kigutilik were bulk sampled in 2006 (see Table 8).

The principal goals and objectives of the 2006 exploration program were to continue 

reconnaissance exploration on a district scale, focus detailed mapping and bulk sampling on 

the two best ruby occurrences namely Aappaluttoq and Kigutilik, and process the bulk 

samples using a pilot facility in the village of Fiskenæsset.  Detailed geologic mapping was 

conducted with field coverage at 1:500 scale and compilation at 1:2,000.  The map area at 

Aappaluttoq was extended to include 2,600 metres to the NNE toward Ruby Island, whereas 

the map area at Kigutilik extends 600 metres to the WNW.  The width of mapping coverage 

averaged <100 metres at Aappaluttoq and 250 metres at Kigutilik. 

For simplicity of presentation for several years of progressive geological studies, the geological 

mapping data is compiled under "Exploration 2007". 

In 2006, reconnaissance exploration by True North increased the original tally of six (6) 

historical occurrences up to a total of 30 ruby and pink sapphire showings (Table 9 and 

Figure 6).  Additionally, five styles of corundum mineralization were suggested, including 

regional and contact metamorphic, metasomatic, hydrothermal and pegmatite (plumasite). 

During 2006, True North identified two corundum parageneses in the Fiskenæsset region 

including emery tactite formed by contact metamorphism (Kaadaaq) and plumasite formed by 

desilication of pegmatite along an ultramafic contact.  Potential economic importance is 

applied primarily to the hydrothermal and metasomatic occurrences (Rohtert, 2006, 2007).

Figure 6. Landsat Photograph of Fiskenaesset Area showing known ruby occurrences



At Aappaluttoq, mapping extends from Tasiussua to Lake Katrina, covering six (6) significant 

ruby occurrences in a strike length of 2,600 metres, including:  Aappaluttoq, Sarfaq, Rejane, 

Summit, Mikisoq and beyond.  Along the Ruby Island Line, intermittent ruby mineralization 

continues along trend and ruby is present locally on four parallel geologic contacts across a 

width of 100 metres, exposed over an elevation range of 340 metres. 

In 2006, as previously noted, True North expanded the sample size by one order of magnitude 

in order to investigate grade distribution at scale, and focused on the two best ruby and pink 

sapphire occurrences, Kigutilik, which had emerged as the highest grade occurrence based 

upon testing in 2004 and 2005 and Aappaluttoq exhibiting excellent gemstone potential based 

on the 100 kilogram surface sample, and colouration and tenor of exposed mineralization.  

Both samples were contained within apparently contiguous mineralization, for 15-30 metres of 

strike length at Aappaluttoq, and for up to 40 metres of strike length at Kigutilik.  Prior to 

excavation of the samples, detailed geologic mapping at each site defined the surface 

dimensions of exposed ruby mineralization and the associated alteration assemblage. 

The samples, totalling an estimated 59.7 tonnes, were delivered by helicopter; one bag 

comprising an excess of 720 kilograms from Kigutilik was donated to the local lapidary facility 

in Fiskenæsset.  As indicated, 2005 material stockpiled in Fiskenæsset was blended in for a 

total 2005-2006 Aappaluttoq sample weight of 30.00 tonnes.  The 30-tonne sample from 

Aappaluttoq 2005-2006 was processed to completion; an additional estimated 1.8 tonnes of 

coarse tailings (measured at 5.3 tonnes during 2007 processing) remained to be processed in 

2007 with final reconciliation of the concentrate proportions and gemstone recovery.  

Examination of the tailings by the author in May 2007 indicated the presence of abundant 

recoverable corundum.  The unprocessed 30-tonne sample from Kigutilik 2006 remained 

securely stockpiled in the village of Fiskenæsset for processing in 2007.  The detailed results, 

to date, for the 2006 Aappaluttoq and 2006 Kigutilik processing are provided, in chronological 

order, in the section on "Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testwork". 

In summary, to date, the Aappaluttoq primary concentrate products, weighing a combined 

717.21 kilograms from a 30 tonne feed, were partially sorted in Fiskenæsset, reducing the 

total concentrate to 592.21 kilograms for shipment to Canada  Secondary and tertiary 

processing resulted in gem and near-gem components weighing, in aggregate, 134.99 

kilograms of concentrate for HF leaching and final sorting.  The results indicated rough grades 

of 1,937 g/t gem and 4,500 g/t combined gem and near-gem, and clearly provided the 

impetus for the recommended 2007 bulk sampling and drilling program proposed and 

recommended by the project Qualified Person.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
In summary, the Fiskenæsset anorthosite complex is a layered cumulate igneous intrusion 

with a total folded strike length of 200 kilometres and an estimated maximum thickness of 

400 metres along its line of structural ascent on the northern margin of the district, thinning 

southward to a feather edge south of Bjornesund (Figure 7).  An excellent summary of the 

district geology, and geology of the ruby occurrences in the Fiskenaesset area of West 

Greenland, is afforded by Myers (1975, 1978, 1981) and Appel (1995), respectively, among 

several other literature references undertaken once the geology and economic potential were 

recognized in the early 1970's.  The Fiskenaesset complex exhibits similarities to other large 

layered complexes in terms of geology, metamorphic character and corundum mineralization 

such as the Sittampundi complex, India (Appel, 1992), Dwars River area of the Bushveld, 

South Africa (Appel, 1992), and others too numerous to mention herein, and some geological 

characteristics which occur in the ultramafic-hosted ruby deposits of the Ejeda-Fotadreva 

area of Madagascar (Mercier et al., 1999) and north Westland, New Zealand (Grapes and 

Palmer, 1996). 

The intrusive suite comprises gabbros, ultramafic rocks, leucogabbro and calcic anorthosite, 

listed in decreasing order of abundance.  The cumulate layered intrusive complex is generally 

zoned upwards from mafic to calcic units.  Six individual map units are recognized at regional 

scale as follows in Table 10. 

Table 10. Principal Geological Units of the Fiskenaesset Layered Complex 

Map Unit Lithology 
7 Upper Gabbro 
6 Anorthosite 
5 Upper Leucogabbro 
4 Middle Gabbro 
3 Lower Leucogabbro 
2 Ultramafic 
1 Lower Gabbro 

 

Ruby, as well as chromite, is largely confined to the upper Anorthosite member and, to a 

lesser extent, the underlying Upper Gabbro member (Myers, 1985) primarily where the Upper 

Gabbro is missing, and as such, the Anorthosite and contained ultramafic, and the 

supracrustal or greenstone-hosted amphibolite are in juxtaposition. 

The hangingwall contact is variably amphibolite, marble, meta-evaporite and pelitic schist, 

was intruded by the Fiskenæsset layered complex, or later granodiorite-tonalite, which 

 33



dominates the map area (Figure 7).  However, amphibolite is the predominant supracrustal 

component of the Fiskenaesset license identified in the area of the known mineralization. 

The cumulate layered Fiskenæsset anorthosite complex is 2.86 Ga, Mid-Archean in age, and is 

tectonically interleaved and folded with Early Archean supracrustals and 2.60 Ga Mid-

Archean gneissic basement. 

The entire terrane has been subjected to at least one episode of Late Archean, amphibolite to 

granulite facies metamorphism with retrograde amphibolite to upper greenschist facies 

metamorphism and involves at least 3 stages of regional folding (Figure 7) as follows in Table 

11 (Henriksen et al., 2000).  The principal elongation direction ENE on the Fiskenaesset 

license reflects the F2 structure with warping and minor offsets due to the F3 folding.  An 

overview of the major geo-structural features and air photo lineaments of Aappaluttoq area of 

the Fiskenaesset license is provided in Figure 8.

DEPOSIT TYPES 
Under the relevant deposit classification, the main ruby occurrences of Fiskenæsset are 

referred to as contact metasomatic replacements in micaceous anorthosite (Kievlenko and 

Soregaroli, 2003), though the local geology shows some considerable variance in this regard.  

Type localities for gem corundum deposits in this geologic class include Makr-Ruz in the Polar 

Urals Mountains and the Umba River Valley in Tanzania.  Other occurrences in this class 

include:  Kittila in Finland; Fiskenæsset in Greenland; Tatra in Czech Republic; and Hodono 

in Japan (Hughes, 1990, 1997). 

At these locations, economic gemstone mineralization is closely tied to the strength, 

abundance, and distribution of the hydrous phases in the metasomite, which apparently are 

related to the proximity of altered ultramafic rock where the growth of gem-quality corundum 

is favoured by late stage hydrothermal activity in the waning facies of amphibolite-grade 

metamorphism.  Walton (2004) suggested that growth of gem corundum is favoured by the 

chemical interaction of marble and ultramafic rocks, especially in zones of structural 

deformation, often with the formation of syntectonic sodic pegmatites invading along a mobile 

anorthosite intrusive contact.  Corundum deposits related to ultramafic rocks in high-grade 

metamorphic terrane have been described by various authors such as Lewis (1896) and 

Simandl and Paradis (1999). 

Gem quality corundum closely associated with kyanite and the chrome-mica, fuchsite, as 

noted by True North at Aappaluttoq and several other occurrences on the Fiskenaesset 

license, has been reported from Brazil by Schultz-Guttler (2005); from India by Quinn (2004); 

from Zimbabwe by Milisenda (2003) and from Wyoming by Hausel (2004). 

 

MINERALIZATION 
The unusually-rich gemstone mineral endowment of the Fiskenaesset district has reported by 

Herd et al. (1969) who described the petrogenesis of the sapphirine-bearing rocks; Geisler 

(1976) who first reported potentially economic concentrations of ruby; Goodger (1976), 

Ackermand et al. (1984) and Grew et al. (1987) who described boron-rich kornerupine from 

the Fiskenaesset type locality; and Petersen and Secher (1993) in their classic review 

publication "Minerals of Greenland".  Sapphirine, an extremely rare mineral species, was first 

discovered at the current type locality near Fiskenaesset in 1809 by K.L. Giesecke (Boggild, 

1953).  The association of sapphirine with ruby in the district was established by the 

 37



Geological Survey of Greenland and Denmark (GGU, now known as GEUS) in several 

references noted by Petersen and Secher (1993) among others. 

Corundum is intimately associated variably with chromite, olivine, gedrite, pargasite, 

sapphirine, kornerupine, red spinel, kyanite, fuchsite or mariposite (chrome-bearing mica), 

serpentine and phlogopite. 

To date, corundum paragenesis, in up to five regional and contact metamorphic environments, 

as metasomatic, hydrothermal, and pegmatite (plumasite) occurrences has been suggested by 

Rohtert (2006, 2007) and Ritchie (2006).  Of the ruby occurrences discovered in the 

Fiskenæsset district through 2006, seventeen appear to be primarily metasomatic in origin; 

two occurrences are regional metamorphic; two are contact metamorphic; one is a pegmatite 

(plumasite); and seven are hydrothermal, signifying favourable conditions for corundum 

crystal growth. 

The best type example of a metasomatic ruby occurrence remains Siggartartulik, with 

Kigutilik also in this class.  Regional metamorphic ruby outcrops at Qaqqat Aquleriit where 

extremely-large and abundant, opaque corundum formed in syntectonic boudinage within the 

layered cumulate.  Along primary cleavages, the magmatic anorthite matrix penetrates and 

dilates the corundum nodules.  Contact metamorphic ruby outcrops at Kaadaaq, where dense 

aggregates of anhedral, microcrystalline emery formed a reaction zone between anorthosite 

and barren pegmatite; very fine-grained to granular arrays of pink corundum were identified 

at Siggartartulik in 2007.  Rohtert (2006, 2007) reported that the regional and the contact 

metamorphic rubies are conspicuously uniform in colour, unlike the variably coloured 

gemstones from both the hydrothermal and metasomatic occurrence types.  At Tuk, an 

exceptionally coarse-grained plumasite-pegmatite dike invades the contact between 

anorthosite and ultramafic rocks. 

Hydrothermal ruby occurs most notably in outcrop at Aappaluttoq and at several other 

discrete locations northwards along the Ruby Island Line, where euhedral phenocryst ruby 

crystals are enclosed within coarse-grained magnesite or dolomite clots and/or by a coarse-

grained shell of brilliant blue, commonly transparent, kyanite.  The hydrothermal rubies, in 

general, are more transparent than corundum from other parageneses.  Hydrothermal 

corundum alone displays complex penetration twinning and delicate crystallographic growth, 

features absent in the far more common metasomatic type corundum occurrences. 

At this juncture, given the available exploration results, the hydrothermal gem quality ruby is 

the most economically significant of the known paragenetic types due to its capacity for 

producing abundant, large transparent gems.  The metasomatic paragenesis, such as 

 38



Siggartartulik and Kigutilik, displays considerable similarities in overall mineralogical 

character, though the gem quality clarity of the rubies, based only on the preliminary results 

to date, may be limited primarily to smaller goods with excellent colouration in hue and 

saturation, though coarse-grained ruby and pink sapphire mineralization was identified at 

both locations in 2007. 

The corundum showings in the Fiskenæsset district typically include occurrences of co-

existing red ruby and pink sapphire.  Gemstones range from microscopic in size, to crystals 

over 100 grams in weight.  The largest rubies are opaque porphyroblasts from regional 

metamorphic occurrences.  The larger euhedral gem stones recovered thus far from the 

hydrothermal occurrences typically range from around one to ten grams in weight; individuals 

subhedral to euhedral transparent ruby crystals to thirty-five grams have been identified from 

Aappaluttoq. 

The corundum occurrences range in size from a single isolated occurrence of less than one 

metre thick and less than 10 metres in length, to arrays of aligned occurrences, in parallel to 

en echelon structures, collectively up to 20 metres thick, and over 100 metres in length.  The 

ruby occurrences are planar to lenticular in surface exposure with oblate to locally prolate 

features locally associated with F1 and F2 folding, warping along F3 axes and commonly are 

situated conformable to moderately-dipping to steeply-dipping regional geological contacts.  

Ruby and pink sapphire mineralization at Fiskenæsset is located along and near the contact 

of the layered anorthosite complex, especially proximal to altered chrome-bearing ultramafic 

rocks spatially and genetically associated with the anorthosite. 

Mineralogical zonation associated with corundum mineralization is systematic and consistent, 

and particularly evident with the metasomatic or hydrothermal ruby occurrences, of the 

Fiskenæsset district. 

Mineral facies in individual occurrences are invariably zoned, typically proceeding from the 

anorthosite to the amphibolite or ultramafic contact or vice versa, which accounts in part for 

the designation of the original four type assemblages reported by Appel (1995).  These relate to 

the pargasite, gedrite, phlogopite and hornblende types, of which the initial three are 

associated with the most prospective occurrences to date.  Each of these minerals occurs in 

differing ratios co-mingling with a polymineralic suite of accessory to major modal minerals, 

such as sapphirine, cordierite, feldspar, and/or spinel. 

This zoning is best documented on the Qaqqatsiaq occurrence shown in Figure 9 though 

detailed mapping of several occurrences, including Kigutilik and Aappaluttoq, points to a 

similar sequence of mineral assemblages (Figures 10 and 11). 

 39



To date, each of the sampled occurrences (see description of sampling in "Exploration" and 

"Sampling Method and Approach", and results in "Mineral Processing and Metallurgical 

Testwork") has a differing ratio of ruby to pink sapphire which is independent of rough grade 

(Table 12).  The two corundums, ruby and pink sapphire, may display separate gemstone 

population characteristics in size and quality distribution. 

Table 12.  Ratio of Red to Pink Corundum for Rough Gem and Near-Gem Grade 

 Sample Red/Pink Grade (g/t) 
2004 Siggartartulik 1.78 11,878 
2005 Kigutilik 1.64 8,699 
2005 Ruby Island  2.12 2,855 
2005 Upper Angnertusoq 1.41 4,224 
2005 Lower Angnertusoq  0.00 141 
2005 Qaqqatsiaq 0.65 861 
2006 Aappaluttoq 0.36 4,498 

 

Indications from the previous field seasons suggests that corundum may exhibit different 

morphological features, for example, in the pargasite versus phlogopite zone, with anhedral to 

equant versus tabular to prismatic porphyroblasts, respectively.  The ratio of red to pink 

corundum colouration exhibits significant variability within and between zones, and may be 

influenced by gradients of chrome content, to a large degree, in addition to the spatially 

associated major mineral zoning.

CURRENT EXPLORATION 

EXPLORATION 2007 

OBJECTIVES 
The principal objective of the 2007 field program was to deliver a preliminary economic 

assessment report on the best ruby occurrence, Aappaluttoq, known from among the ruby 

occurrences located thus far in the Fiskenæsset ruby district of southwestern Greenland.  The 

author, acting as the Qualified Person (QP) for the Fiskenaesset ruby project, believes the 

program was fully warranted based on the results to date and fully endorsed the program 

outlined.  To meet this objective, True North's operational goals during the 2007 program were 

recommended as follows: 

 Complete the re-design, assemble and operate upgraded processing plant for the 
preparation of sized gravity concentrates 

 Complete optical sort processing of the gravity concentrates at a contract facility in 
Canada 

 Complete final sorting of optical sort concentrates in Vancouver 

 Complete Phase 1 detailed fence drilling program over the Aappaluttoq occurrence to 
outline the subsurface geology, gemstone continuity and distribution 

 Complete Phase 1 exploration drilling program over other promising occurrences to 
outline the subsurface geology, gemstone continuity and distribution, specifically 
targets along the Ruby island Line such as Mikisoq, Sarfaq and Rejaneq 

 Complete additional bulk sampling along each of the drilling fences to confirm surface 
mineralization 

 Complete additional bulk sampling at the Aappaluttoq occurrence to confirm grade and 
distribution data from the 2005 and 2006 sampling programs 

 Complete prospecting, geological mapping and channel sampling of known and any new 
occurrences 

 Complete processing of channel samples in the Fiskenaesset processing plant and 
prioritize additional targets for follow-up bulk sampling and/or drilling 

 Complete downstream processing of representative portions of the 2007 gravity 
concentrates to permit valuation and grade determination 

 Complete downstream processing of all samples collected prior to 2007 in Q1 2008 

 Continue third party valuations of loose polished wholesale (LPW) gemstones and, as 
approved by BMP, evaluation of market conditions through sales of gemstones on a 
LPW basis or within signature jewelry pieces 

 Engage third party, independent qualified person contracted through internationally 
recognized engineering firm to provide site due diligence, program oversight and quality 
assurance, and to prepare a scoping study in Q2 2008 

 

 44



All of the principal objectives of the field program were achieved; downstream analysis of the 

geological and environmental samples are in progress; project oversight and preparation of a 

scoping document by an independent engineering firm, Wardrop Engineering, are ongoing. 

To summarize the above task list, the re-design and capacity of the test plant was planned to 

permit enhanced processing in terms of time, process optimization and sample handling 

protocols.  Access to optical sorting facilities in Canada during 2007 were limited due to 

delays at the manufacturing source and is expected to be performed during 2008.  Drilling 

was recommended to comprise 5,000 metres with holes ranging from 30 metres to 125 metres, 

mainly on the Aappaluttoq occurrence.  The remainder of the drilling would be conducted on 

promising occurrences based on the results of 2007 channel sampling and geological 

mapping.  Bulk sampling was recommended to test Aappaluttoq and several other 

occurrences.  Proposals to the BMP planned for the excavation of up to 100 tonnes of rock and 

surface material during the 2008 season.  True North was to maintain efforts to advance the 

exploration and development of the ruby deposits at Fiskenæsset by continuing with:  (1) 

gemological testing; (2) manufacturing from all gemstone classes; (3) independent valuation of 

the loose polished goods; (4) fabrication of signature jewellery units for showcasing polished 

goods and eventually to independently quantify retail valuation; and, (5) analysis of the global 

ruby markets. 

An independent consulting geological and engineering firm was to be selected to conduct an 

exploration program review, site due diligence for exploration, processing, stone recovery, 

cutting, and quality control, and to provide oversight for baseline environmental, pre-

engineering and resource determination, prior to preparation of a scoping study scheduled for 

delivery in Q2 2008. 

Additionally, outreach programs with the local artisans would be under development via 

discussions with respect to individuals representing lapidary, design and goldsmithing skills, 

and the local groups represented by Nuuk Kommunea. 

The exploration budget for the 2007 True North Gems program was initially estimated at 

C$3,000,000 (DKK 15.000.000,00) with the field season running from June 1 to September 

30.  Based on the additional requirements for equipment, including air support for the sample 

handling and drilling, it was anticipated that a budget of C$4,000,000 (DKK 20.000.000,00) 

would be required to meet the objectives set out in the proposed programs.

PROJECT LOGISTICS 
All pertinent logistical data and information are provided under "Accessibility, Local Resources 

and Infrastructure", "Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testwork" and several of the 

upcoming sections in "Current Exploration".  As noted in the section "Reliance on Other 

Experts", True North contracted Wardrop Engineering, Ramboll Denmark, Air Greenland, 

Kluane Drilling and Greenland Resources as the principal players during the 2007 season.  

Kluane Drilling provided a heli-portable NTW drill rig for the 5,000 metre program (Illustration 

7) and Greenland Resources provided and constructed the base camp facilities (Illustration 5), 

and managed local equipment and human resources.  Several other Greenlandic contractors 

were required for supplies, construction, electrical services, equipment rental, boat, ship and 

barge rental. 

DIAMOND DRILLING 
To the author's knowledge, no historical drilling has been conducted at any of the Fiskenæsset 

ruby sites and none was completed as part of the 2004, 2005, or 2006 field exploration 

programs described herein.  The exploration program completed in 2007 comprised the first 

documented diamond drilling in the Fiskenaesset district. 

Diamond drilling was recommended to comprise 5,000 metres with holes ranging from 30 

metres to 125 metres.  Phase 1 detailed fence drilling program was planned over the 

Aappaluttoq occurrence to outline the subsurface geology, gemstone continuity and 

distribution.  The initial drilling was focused on the continuity of the shallow expression of the 

"Host Zone" mineralization from both a geological and an engineering perspective with deeper 

holes planned for Phase 2 drilling in 2008. 

On Aappaluttoq, a total of 4,501.7 metres were drilled in forty-six drill holes with the depth of 

individual holes ranging from 25.9 metres to 230.8 metres, as shown below in Table 13.  The 

holes were drilled in a northeasterly series of fences with a nominal 12.5 metre spacing 

targeting three to six pierce points per section through the projected Host Zone.  The collar 

map is shown in Figure 12.  Preliminary logging was completed at the Ruby Island base camp 

and detailed logging of selected intervals of the core will be completed in January 2008 upon 

receipt of the samples to a True North core processing facility in Delta, British Columbia.  Drill 

sections orthogonal to the strike of the Aappaluttoq occurrence have been prepared and 

structural interpretation is underway. 

A summary table of the forty-six drill holes completed on the Aappaluttoq ruby and pink 

sapphire occurrence during the 2007 field program is tabulated below (see Table 13).

Based on the geological mapping shown in Figure 11 and additional detailed geological and 

trench mapping conducted in 2007, all of the holes were collared within or at the western 

contact of the altered ultramafic and drilled southeast toward the hangingwall anorthosite 

gneiss. 

In summary, ruby and pink sapphire occur within a tightly folded series of distinct zones of 

phlogopite and pargasite-enriched alteration, referred to as the Host Zone, which is coincident 

with the geological contact between the ultramafic and anorthosite.  The Host Zone was 

intersected in up to six holes in a single drill section exhibiting a relatively shallow dip 

estimated at 50°-60° WNW; the intersections were bounded on the structural hangingwall by 

altered ultramafic generally composed of fine-grained to very coarse-grained sapphirine and 

gedrite orthoamphibole in variable proportions (Illustration 8).  Intervals with minor to 

elevated degree of phlogopitization and minor fuchsite/mariposite were common, progressing 

into a blackwall zone dominated by phlogopite.  Mica ranged from fine-grained to very coarse-

grained and exhibited a random orientation, which tended to hinder easy extraction, and 

subsequent rock breaking and DMS processing.  Ruby and pink sapphire typically occurred 

with the increased phlogopite component (Illustration 9).  Coarse granoblastic, quartz-feldspar 

pegmatite was intersected proximal to the ruby and pink sapphire mineralization though no 

similar geological unit was exposed near the surface outcrops (Illustration 10).  Further 

geological mapping of the Aappaluttoq area by the author identified several pods of pegmatite 

to the north of the main showing near the contact between the ultramafic, amphibolite and 

anorthosite gneiss.  The latter displays mineral compositions and proportions ranging from 

leucogabbro to gabbro and locally anorthosite.  Complex folding and mineralogical banding 

are ubiquitous and account for highly variable structural measurements along the core axis 

(Illustration 11). 

The drilling has intersected visible ruby and pink sapphire mineralization in 18 of the 46 holes 

and has extended the strike length of the Aappaluttoq occurrence from the known 15-20 

metres exposed on surface in the main showing to more than 105 metres.  Of particular note, 

is the identification of ruby and pink sapphire, directly below surface exposures of anorthosite 

gneiss to the north and south.  Though the structural features of the gneiss commonly display 

 49



steep fabrics defined by mineral banding, the presence of altered ultramafic and corundum 

mineralization suggests the presence of warping of the F2 limbs along WNW F3 planar features, 

and/or en echelon or boudinage features associated with one or both stages of folding.  The 

down dip projection of the mineralization appears to steepen from the known occurrence 

toward the south from 60°WNW to sub-vertical, and may rotate on strike from NNE to ENE 

moving from north to south as suggested by the outcrop mapping.  Local inflections are 

commonly represented by complex fold features; preliminary interpretation of the small 

structures points to a weakly N-plunging F2 antiform.  The effects of structural lineaments 

exhibiting E-W and WNW orientations crossing the Aappaluttoq peninsula remain to be 

investigated for potential offsets of the mineralization. 

The drilling clearly intersected an interval of anorthosite gneiss followed by a deeper interval of 

ultramafics similar to the Host Zone and adjacent feldspar and/or pargasite-rich 

mineralization.  Figures 13, 14 and 15 illustrate three drill sections through the Host Zone, 

intermediate anorthosite and Aappaluttoq Deep mineralization, associated once again with the 

ultramafic units.  The shallow Host Zone can be tracked through several holes dipping to the 

WNW and remains open to the west, north and south.  The Aappaluttoq Deep occurrence was 

identified in several of the deeper drill holes on the footwall contact of the anorthosite, again 

within heavily altered ultramafic comprised mainly of phlogopite-pargasite-sapphirine-gedrite.  

The ruby mineralization within the Aappaluttoq Deep intervals contain the largest ruby and 

pink sapphire crystals, and most abundant in terms of apparent grade, in the drill holes 

completed to date. 

The mineralization commonly occurred as fine-grained to medium-grained ruby and pink 

sapphire with phlogopite (Illustration 12).  Photographs of the Aappaluttoq Deep intersections 

display coarse ruby and/or pink sapphire  with phlogopite/fuchsite/mariposite (Illustration 

13) and locally up to 5% by volume of fine-grained corundum in phlogopite-pargasite 

(Illustration 14).  Clots of ruby and pink sapphire also occurred with sapphirine-gedrite units 

affected by incipient phlogopite to the hangingwall side of the blackwall alteration zone 

(Illustration 15). 

The distinct alteration zone that contains significant concentrations of ruby and pink sapphire 

("Host Zone") was identified in forty-three of the forty-six holes on the Aappaluttoq occurrence.  

Ruby and pink sapphire, identified in preliminary core logging, occurred within the Host Zone 

at intervals that varied from less than 1 to 12 metres in thickness and at down hole depths 

from 2.1 metres to 166.3 metres.  Individual crystals, visible to core logging, ranged in size 

from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in size and comprised from less than 0.5 percent to 5 percent 

 50



of ruby and sapphire by rock volume within these intervals.  Colouration ranged from dark 

ruby red to dark pink, pink, light pink to locally white, and zoning of crystals and aggregates 

was identified. 

As noted below in Table 14, multiple intervals with ruby and pink sapphire were documented 

in eleven drill holes (DDH GL-07-07, GL-07-11, GL-07-12, GL-07-13, GL-07-17, GL-07-18, 

GL-07-32,GL-07-35, GL-07-36, GL-07-38 and GL-07-39) of the eighteen drill holes that 

contain the visible corundum mineralization.

To date, drilling tested an area of the Host Zone over a 105 metre strike length and to a 

vertical depth of 144 metres below surface.  The Host Zone remains open to the north and 

south along strike and is open down-dip to the west.  In the case of the Aappaluttoq Deep 

Zone, the interval remains open both above and below the current intersections ranging from 

75-125 metres below the surface projection in the lake east of the surface showing at 

Aappaluttoq.  The lateral continuity and depth of ruby and pink sapphire mineralization 

within a structurally complex geological terrane is very encouraging, particularly with one of 

the thicker intervals, containing the highest content of ruby and pink sapphire, observed in 

the Aappaluttoq Deep drill intersections.  Further drilling is required and will be 

recommended for the 2008 program to examine the potential for additional mineralization in 

all directions from the known occurrence.

In addition, True North completed four exploration diamond drill holes on the Sarfaq and 

Ridgetop ruby prospects (see Table 15), which are two of the Ruby Island Line occurrences, on 

trend from Aappaluttoq, and in doing so, successfully confirmed extensions to the favourable 

Aappaluttoq Host Zone geology and additional ruby mineralization on surface.

The Sarfaq occurrence contains ruby and pink sapphire in surface outcrops and is located 

255 metres along strike to the northeast of Aappaluttoq.  Three drill holes in this prospect 

have confirmed the prospective geology and the distinctive sapphirine-gedrite-phlogopite-

pargasite alteration, similar to the Host Zone of the Aappaluttoq occurrence.  No ruby 

mineralization was noted in the drilling, however recent geological mapping between the 

Aappaluttoq and Sarfaq occurrences was successful in identifying surface float, containing 

ruby-pargasite mineralization in boulders weighing up to 800 kg, located up to 100 metres 

north of Aappaluttoq.  All three of the Sarfaq holes were collared within the hangingwall 

anorthosite gneiss and drilled northwest toward the altered ultramafic unit to test for 

similarities in geology to Aappaluttoq. 

The Ridgetop prospect consists of ruby-sapphire-pargasite occurrences in outcrop located 

1,200 metres to the north-northeast of the Aappaluttoq occurrence.  Drilling of one hole on 

this target tested two of these parallel alteration zones and was successful at intersecting 

these zones at depth without associated ruby-sapphire mineralization. 

At Sarfaq, mineralogy similar to the Host Zone was identified at intersections that varied from 

less than 0.8 metres to 1.8 metres in thickness and at down hole depths from 8.1 metres to 

13.8 metres in three drill holes (GL-07-48 to GL-47-50) as shown in Table 16.  A second 

phlogopite-rich intersection was identified in 97-07-49 at 123.4-125.2 metres. 

At Ridgetop, a pargasite-bearing unit was identified in drilling (GL-07-47) and occurred from 

11.7-19.0 metres and a second intersection, similar to the Host Zone, was intersected from 

132.7-138.1 metres as shown in Table 16.

The Sarfaq and Aappaluttoq ruby occurrences are separated by more than 200 metres along 

geological strike in an untested area largely covered by a lake.  With the known Aappaluttoq 

mineralization remaining open to the north and to depth, the identification of ruby-bearing 

boulders on surface, and a favourable structural and mineralogical trend defined by drilling 

and mapping, a high priority target area has now been identified to pursue in future drilling 

programs between the Aappaluttoq and Sarfaq occurrences. 

The initial drilling results, to date, are very encouraging and the results are considered to be 

very significant to the future of the Fiskenaesset Ruby Project.  Additional drilling will be 

required to provide data for a resource determination, specifically larger diameter core 

expected to be HTW, offering more weight per metre for sample processing to recover and 

quantify the content (rough grade in grams per tonne) of ruby and pink sapphire. 

Drill core, comprising in aggregate approximately 800 metres (8,900 kilograms), from the 

Aappaluttoq, Sarfaq and Ridgetop occurrences were packaged on pallets in the Ruby Island 

base camp, transferred by helicopter to Fiskenaesset and delivered to Nuuk for shipment by 

maritime container ship to Canada.  The core will be delivered to SGS in Delta, British 

Columbia, in December 2007, where True North will be preparing a secure core logging and 

sampling facility.  Mineralized core intervals of the Host Zone from the Aappaluttoq occurrence 

will be sampled and packaged during January 2008, under the auspices of Wardrop 

Engineering.  Processing of selected drill core intervals for recovery of ruby and pink sapphire, 

gemstone classification and rough grade determination will be initiated at independent 

laboratory facilities in Q1 2008.  Process flowsheet design is underway and results will be 

provided as available. 

As per the proposed program, surface sampling at drill cross sections for a 1-3 tonne mini-

bulk sample were not completed due to a lack of accessible bedrock exposure.  However, the 

principal 2007 Aappaluttoq 25 tonne bulk samples B1 and B2 were located directly up-dip 

from the two drill sections including DDH GL-04 through DDH GL-07-09.

BULK SAMPLING 
In 2007, further bulk sampling at the Aappaluttoq occurrence was carried out to confirm 

grade and distribution data from the 2005 and 2006 sampling programs; it should be noted 

herein that, to date, the final rough and polished grades, and its requisite size, coloration and 

valuation data are not yet complete for the 2005 and 2006 samples.  Rough grades and partial 

results for the beneficiation tests are provided under separate sections in this report. 

In 2007, the majority of the samples, including 53 tonnes of rock and 26 tonnes of soil, were 

collected from the Aappaluttoq occurrence (Illustration 16).  Together with material previously 

sampled in 2005, 2006 and 2007, True North has extracted a total of 116 tonnes of 

mineralized surface material and rock from the Aappaluttoq ruby occurrence as listed in Table 

17.

The in-place bedrock sample, was collected using diamond chain saws, to ensure grade and 

width control, and to confirm grade and stone distribution data garnered from the 2006 

exploration (Illustration 17).  The in-place bedrock sample (2007 B1) represents the main ruby 

and pink sapphire-bearing interval at the Aappaluttoq occurrence, measuring 1-2 metres in 

width.  The trench exposed by bedrock sampling is located from 1-2 metres down dip and up 

to 4 metres along strike in the area of the 2006 bulk sample.  Sample B1A was a high grade 

hand selected portion of B1 set aside for separate processing by the bulk sampling supervisor. 

The weathered sample of soil and broken rock (2007 Overburden) was collected from an area 

measuring 5 metres by 20 metres directly above several ruby-bearing intervals within the 

folded and altered ultramafic rocks at Aappaluttoq.  Ruby and pink sapphire occur within 

tightly folded zones of phlogopite and pargasite-enriched alteration (Illustration 18) coincident 

with the heavily zoned alteration occurring between the ultramafic and anorthosite. 

 57



The third bulk sample (2007 B2), collected from the Aappaluttoq occurrence, had a total 

weight of 27.8 tonnes and was collected from the bedrock exposure of the ruby and pink 

sapphire-bearing interval was collected from bedrock using focused, low intensity blasting 

with spaced charges of dynamite sticks to ensure grade and width control (Illustration 19)  

This occurrence is the most significant ruby prospect discovered to date on the property and, 

in this location, measures between one and two metres in width and contains ruby-magnesite-

kyanite in sapphirine-phlogopite exposed on the base of the blast area (Illustration 20).  The 

trench exposed by the 2006 and 2007 bulk sampling measures up to 3 metres in both depth 

and width, and up to 7 metres along strike; additional stripping has exposed the mineralized 

contact to 24 metres and along adjacent mineralized layers to 34 metres.  The outcropping is 

terminated by zones of coarse rubble both to the north and south which will require further 

excavation during the 2008 season. 

Sample 2007 B3 was a large boulder containing numerous bands of red to purplish rubies 

associated with pargasite.  The sample was discovered by the author during detailed mapping 

of the Aappaluttoq area, approximately 100 metres north of the known Aappaluttoq 

mineralization toward the Sarfaq occurrence. 

Interim results of the bulk sample processing are provided under "Mineral Processing and 

Metallurgical Testwork". 

PROSPECTING AND CHANNEL SAMPLING 
The regional "property-scale" geology program conducted had the goal of re-visiting the 

prospective areas of the Fiskenaesset license based on co-ordinates reported on the 2005 and 

2006 files, and to collect additional data, specifically mineral associations, dimensions and 

degree of mineralization potential, all related to the known corundum occurrences, and to 

conduct prospecting and sampling of any further discoveries.  In short, the channel sampling 

provides a mechanism for generating qualitative data on the corundum rough grades and gem 

class proportions, and with selected manufacturing from promising samples, will be used for 

target prioritization for bulk sampling and/or drilling in future programs.  It should be noted 

herein that there were no geological personnel returning from the previous years' programs. 

Additional geological mapping, prospecting and rock sampling was carried out throughout the 

License.  True North completed sixty channel samples, including those collected by diamond 

saw, Microblaster and float as required, and weighing from 5 kilograms to 350 kilograms from 

selected ruby and pink sapphire occurrences identified during the 2006 and 2007 mapping 

and prospecting programs.  One large sample weighing approximately 735 kilograms was 

 58



collected from the Siggartartulik area and comprised loose material from previous work, 

mainly from the pargasite rich zones. 

These samples, comprising an aggregate of 3.6 tonnes, were collected from several 

occurrences which include Mikisoq, Sarfaq, and Ridgetop, located on the 2.6 kilometre Ruby 

Island Line which adjoins and occurs along strike from Aappaluttoq.  Other prospects 

sampled include, Siggartartulik, Pupiq, Upper Angnertusoq East, and the Kangarssuk Main 

and East Occurrences.  All of these ruby and pink sapphire occurrences exhibit similar 

mineralogical and lithological parameters to those associated with the Aappaluttoq prospect, 

and included corundum occurrences from previous exploration (Rohtert, 2006, 2007).  The 

specifics on the sampling protocols are reported under "Sampling Method and Approach". 

Summary information on the specific locations is given below starting with the Ruby Island 

Line sampling listed in Table 18, Siggartartulik in Table 19 and Kangarssuk, Pupiq and other 

occurrences in Table 20.

The Sarfaq samples were comprised of mica rich sapphirine-gedrite material with mostly fine 

grained to lesser coarse-grained pink to red corundum, and mica-rich bands within pegmatite 

or coarsely crystallized anorthosite.  No samples were collected from the gedrite-sapphirine 

zone on the eastern flank of the occurrence.  The Rejaneq (formerly Rejane's occurrence) 

 59



samples comprised bright green amphibole within sapphirine-gedrite containing medium to 

deep pink corundum up to 1cm in diameter.  At Ridgetop, sampling of micaceous anorthosite 

with sparse pale to medium pink corundum to 1cm was completed.  At Mikisoq South, float 

samples, collected 3-4 metres down slope, contained drusy encrustation-like hot pink 

corundum, though some crystals to ½ to 1cm were observed.  The microblasted sample 

contained moderate to abundant corundum to 1cm.

At Siggartartulik, the whole zone extends over 800 metres from west to east and has 

numerous showings containing pink to red corundum in various densities.  Eight chain saw 

samples, and several float and gravel samples, were taken mainly in areas of historic 

exploration sampling.  The samples comprised micaceous anorthosite, locally enriched in pink 

corundum, micaceous sapphirine-gedrite band with minor pargasite with abundant corundum 

mostly <8mm and pale to medium pink in colouration, and similar pargasite-rich and 

 60



corundum-rich zones for a float sample and B3 mini-bulk sample.  Locally, corundum is pale 

to medium pink often appearing zoned to white on the rinds and varies widely in abundance 

to greater than 5%.  Locally the corundum is very densely populated.  The gravel sample was 

enriched in pink corundum to 1cm.  At Siggartartulik West, an "offshoot" from the main trend 

a subparallel zone was encountered with a 2 to 4 metre wide pegmatite and bands of variably 

micaceous sapphirine-gedrite within amphibolite.  Numerous large slabs showed red crystals 

to 2 to 4cm in length by 1 to 2cm, notably some of the largest rough ruby material observed to 

date on the project.  At Siggartartulik East, at a fold nose, numerous showings of corundum 

within micaceous anorthosite with bright green pargasite contained corundum crystals up to 

4 or 5cm in length, though most were pink in colouration.

At Kangarssuk, outcrop and float sampling was performed on 20-50cm band of pale pink 

corundum proximal to an amphibolite-pegmatite contact and a 1 metre band of sapphirine-

gedrite enriched in corundum.  At Kangarssuk East and the East Extension, an abundance of 

mineralized float and outcrop contained similar sapphirine-gedrite-corundum with a 20cm 

zone of bright green amphibole with red spinel and red corundum in the 1-3mm size range. 

At Pupiq, mineralization is >10 metres in width though individual corundum bearing zones 

tend to be narrow, generally up to a metre in width.  Samples were collected from micaceous 

sapphirine-gedrite containing pink corundum to ~1cm and adjacent to a large (3-4m wide) 

 61



pegmatite, and friable micaceous sapphirine-gedrite with abundant bright green pargasite.  

Corundum is up to ~2cm and is mostly pale to medium pink in colour.  At Upper Angnertusoq 

East, samples represented a micaceous zone with gedrite and minor sapphirine and pink 

corundum, and a second 50cm wide zone of corundum-bearing sapphirine-gedrite.  One new 

discovery in leucogabbro south of the Angnertusoq area (about 1.2km SE of Upper 

Angnertusoq East) contained corundum as medium pink to red coloured elongate crystals to 

1cm with plagioclase rinds.  Corundum was sparse but continuous over 75m of strike length 

with ultramafic spatially associated with pegmatite. 

The Fiskenæsset gravity plant did not treat channel samples from exploration sites due to the 

processing schedule.  However, the samples were submitted for primary and secondary jaw 

crushing to nominal 50mm and were re-packed and weighed for shipment to Canada for third 

party processing at a commercial facility.  True North shipped an aggregate weight of 3.4 

tonnes in eight sealed one-tonne bags comprising sixty "channel" samples from selected ruby 

and pink sapphire occurrences exhibiting mineralogy similar to the Aappaluttoq prospect.  

The samples are scheduled for delivery to SGS in December 2007.  Process flowsheet 

development, specific to the "channel" samples, is underway at SGS Minerals Services, 

Lakefield, Ontario.  Sample processing and primary ruby sorting is scheduled during the first 

quarter of 2008 and results will be provided in an updated 43-101 report. 

PROSPECTING 
Pertinent highlights of the prospecting exercises from the 2007 season are described below. 

Kangarssuk and Kangarssuk East defines a group of occurrences with the typical sapphirine-

gedrite-pargasite assemblage with a wide range of corundum morphologies and sizes in float 

and outcrop over several hundred metres of strike length.  Float locally indicates areas where 

corundum is larger in size with improved colour and transparency.  An area identified in 2007 

and designated 'better than Aappaluttoq' contained corundum in green amphibole and 

gedrite/sapphirine where the latter mineral is striking with its strong blue colour.  The 

corundum ranges from non-gem to gem, varying from light to dark pink, occasionally red, 

anhedral to euhedral and to >1cm.  Weathering of the mineralized rocks has produced a 

regolith rich in corundum.  A second area identified by geologists as 'Aappaluttoq II' contained 

abundant corundum-bearing float below outcrops with indigo blue sapphirine in massive 

agglomerates with gedrite and intense red, transparent to vitreous spinel.  Pargasite and 

corundum were spatially associated and the latter varies from pink to red in colour with high 

transparency indicating gem quality material.  In terms of size, it is observed that the large 

crystals are approximately 5cm measured in hexagonal cross sections of exposed crystals. 

 62



At Kangarssuk West, light pink sapphire occurred in sapphirine-gedrite near the anorthosite 

and amphibolite contact.  Pegmatite and/or pegmatitic anorthosite occur along the contacts 

adjacent to corundum-bearing sapphirine-gedrite lenses.  At Kangarssuk Far West, mapping 

identified a large pegmatite with amphibolite and anorthosite, with the latter containing light 

to dark pink anhedral corundum associated with fuchsite. 

At Laks Elv, anorthosite contained pargasite, sapphirine, gedrite, kyanite and fine-grained 

corundum anhedra ranging from light pink to red, mm size and anhedral crystals.  

Pupiq exhibits an abundance of boulders of sapphirine/gedrite and corundum-bearing 

pargasite up to 5 metres in diameter.  Complex zoning includes gneiss, pegmatite, gedrite-

sapphirine-phlogopite, and green amphibole/pargasite to 10cm with light pink to red 

corundum, subhedral to euhedral and mm to cm in size (Illustration 40).  Another unit of 

coarse gedrite-sapphirine-phlogopite contains pink corundum with blue colour zoning followed 

by pargasite and pegmatite, and additional zones of corundum-bearing gedrite-sapphirine-

phlogopite.  Chromite-bearing ultramafics and amphibolites are common.  Gem to near-gem 

corundum, locally in barrel shaped crystals, protrudes from the recessively weathering 

phlogopitized zones. 

Altiplano located between Pupiq and Siggartartulik contained typical occurrences with 

microcrystalline pink corundum and kyanite similar to the Mikisoq occurrences and euhedral 

to anhedral prisms to 1cm.  The corundum is mainly pink and show a strikingly strong bluish 

and/or purplish overgrowth texture. 

Siggartartulik East contained layers of phlogopite, sapphirine/gedrite, pargasite and 

anorthosite as described in other zones.  Corundum crystals are <3 cm in length, light pink 

and mostly opaque.  Siggartartulik West contained outcroppings of corundum crystals which 

are remarkably euhedral to 2cm across the hexagonal prisms and of a deep red colour 

associated with incipient alteration of anorthosite and pargasite-sapphirine-gedrite 

(illustration 39).  Similar deep red corundum was observed in Qaqqatsiaq in weakly to 

moderately phlogopite-bearing anorthosite (Illustration 41).  Further west, pink corundum is 

associated with narrow phlogopitised sapphirine and plagioclase banded with amphibole. 

At Northwest Angnertusoq, coarse sapphirine-gedrite occurred adjacent to anorthosite and 

amphibolite contact.  Gedrite crystals are up to 5cm formed with sapphirine.  Corundum is 

present as pink microcrystalline morphology.  At Upper Angnertusoq East, the corundum-

bearing phlogopite is part of a banded, intensely phlogopitised sapphirine/gedrite zone.  Fine 

corundum ranged from light to dark pink colour while the associated cordierite occurs as 

intensely fractured translucent gray crystals of up to 3cm in size.  Coarse mica is associated 

 63



with greyish-blue sapphirine and light brown gedrite up to several centimetres in length.  

Pargasite and garnet were identified.  Angnertusoq South is a new gabbro hosted corundum 

and pargasite occurrence measuring 75 metres in length and 1-2 metres in width.  The 

corundum crystals are pink to red in colour, euhedral to anhedral and centimetre sizes 

elongated on fabric. 

Tassiusa Gate North and South exhibited fine-grained pink microcrystalline corundum 

resembling Mikisoq, associated to fuchsite within the anorthosite near the amphibolite 

contact.  To the north of Puilassut Qavat and Nugussup Qavat, abundant occurrences of 

fuchsite and kyanite were identified.  At Nugussup Qavat, discontinuous occurrences of pink 

sapphire of centimetre size, anhedral and mostly opaque were associated with fuchsite.  Minor 

outcrops of phlogopitised sapphirine/gedrite were observed near a newly discovered 

corundum-bearing zone in a phlogopite-rich zone, with light to dark pink colour, opaque to 

translucent, subhedral to euhedral crystals. 

The recent property-scale geological exploration clearly raises the potential for prospective 

targets within the main area of the Fiskenaesset license and supports the collection of the 

large quantity of channel and float samples from many of these occurrences in 2007.  

Additional work, pending the gemmological analysis, is recommended particularly in terms of 

more detailed mapping and systematic channel sampling during the 2008 program.  The 

proximity of the occurrences also supports the prospect of multiple quarrying of bulk samples 

and a central processing facility, should the test results warrant. 

GEOLOGY 
The geological discussion is a compilation effort from 2005 through 2007 and, as such, to 

minimize repetition, will be provided wholly in the following section.  Regional and local 

detailed mapping of occurrences other than Aappaluttoq and Kigutilik have been discussed at 

length by Rohtert (2005, 2006, 2007) and Ritchie (2006).  As the focus of the project activities 

was more restricted during 2006 and 2007, the reader should refer to the authors given above 

for a more complete review of the geological mapping. 

At Aappaluttoq, the ruby showing is located on a small peninsula at the southern end of the 

Ruby Island Line.  This locality is the one of the most promising ruby occurrences in the 

Fiskenæsset District because of the size, quality and abundance of ruby and pink sapphire.  

The ruby mineralization occurs adjacent to a large gedrite-sapphirine-spinel-

fuchsite/mariposite body with an unaltered ultramafic (spinel peridotite) primarily along in its 

western portion.  The corundum is exposed in three or more distinct bands, trending north-

northeast, generally along the eastern margin proximal to the anorthosite.  Corundum can be 

 64



followed continuously in outcrop for 25m, and for more than 100 metres along the general 

NNE strike though several zones of mineralization some of which are not contiguous with the 

principal showing were identified in 2007.  The maximum width of the mineralized package is 

approximately twelve metres, in one to two metre intervals with the overall package apparently 

narrowing to the north along the shallow plunge of the F2 axial plane and/or F3 folds, and 

dipping steeply to the WNW. 

The western-most of these corundum-mineralized layers contains 2 to 3cm wide bands of dark 

pink to red corundum (Illustration 36) locally rimmed with white corundum, anorthite and 

magnesite or dolomite, and rimmed or intergrown with unusually vibrant kyanite (Illustration 

37) within the phlogopite and phlogopite-sapphirine zones.  Corundum is especially well 

crystallized with many crystals showing good transparency and exquisite, terminated 

prismatic crystal habit, including overgrowths and penetration twins.  The largest ruby 

specimen collected thus far from the Aappaluttoq occurrence, weighed in at 80 grams and was 

selected for carving (see "Manufacturing"). 

The pink sapphire collected in the colluvial gravel and soil overlying the outcrop are typically 

subhedral and locally fractured, commonly along the basal cleavage, but exhibit vibrant pink 

colours with a range from poor to moderate clarity.  The second corundum-bearing band 

appears to contain a larger proportion of pink sapphires, with lesser ruby, with white 

corundum and/or anorthite rinds and occurs in phlogopitized anorthosite.  The third band, 

nearest the lake to the east, consists of 10cm wide pargasite, phlogopite, and pink corundum, 

up to 5mm, in anorthosite horizon locally containing dark red garnets similar to those 

observed near the western band within 102 metres of the gedrite-sapphirine contact.  

Mineralization trends into the lake and is covered by overburden to the north.  Drilling 

suggests that the contact warps to the northwest, possibly along a F3 shear plane, and was 

intersected below the outcropping anorthosite gneiss. 

F3 or later faults may offset the mineralization at Aappaluttoq; offsets on these structures are 

generally minor based on the regional structural features though on an occurrence scale, 

displacements up to tens of metres are significant to the interpretation of the continuity of 

mineralization.  Illustration 38 shows similar structural features at Siggartartulik. 

At Kigutilik, ruby mineralization outcrops for a strike length of 650 metres over seven separate 

corundum showings, averaging up to 50 metres in strike length and 1 to 2 metres in width, 

between anorthosite and amphibolite, and within heavily altered ultramafic rocks surrounded 

by pegmatite.  The current area of interest measures 40 metres by 20 metres and comprises 

three main corundum-bearing zones - pargasite-type, phlogopite-type, and gedrite-type.  The 

 65



pargasite zone contained the most abundant corundum, which varies from dark pink to red, 

opaque to transparent, with crystal sizes that range up to ~1.5cm.  In the pargasite zone, 

corundum typically occurred as equant porphyroblasts.  The corundum in the phlogopite zone 

is typically tabular in form with the c-axis aligned perpendicular to foliation, ranged from dark 

red to light pink, with crystals up to 2cm.  Clarity is typically translucent to transparent with 

better quality in the smaller sizes. Zoning from large pink translucent corundum in the north, 

to smaller red transparent corundum in the south, was noted within the phlogopite zone.  The 

gedrite zone possesses minor pink corundum crystals, occasionally with sapphirine rims.  

Corundum also occurs as porphyroblasts in anorthositic gneiss with exceptionally-coarse 

crystal sizes up 40 grams.   

At Mikisoq, the corundum occurrence is tabular, steeply dipping, measures 0.8 to 2.4 metres 

in width, and can be traced through several occurrences for 280 metres on strike.  Corundum 

occurs in the same hydrothermal ruby-carbonate-kyanite association as that developed at 

Aappaluttoq.  The growth features of the rubies include very coarse euhedral crystals, 

penetration twinning, overgrowths, zoning and fracture filling.  Drusy fine-grained pink 

corundum is well exposed in many areas of the occurrences.  Until 2007, no sampling of the 

Mikisoq occurrence was completed; the results of the channel samples are pending. 

The most intense mineralization and the best quality corundum typically occur in the most 

deformed regions lying within the axial portions of the folds.  Ruby mineralization usually 

forms as a collection of tightly folded, parallel individual layers, where individual strands can 

range in average thickness from 0.01 metre to >4.0 metres, typically 1 metre, and with 

average strike length from under 3 metres to over 20 metres.  Mapping revealed planar 

elements at a regional scale, though discontinuous and intricately folded, when observed in 

detail. 

ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE STUDY 
True North continued, in conjunction with a Greenlandic consulting company, Greenland 

Resources with Ramboll Denmark as subcontractor and operator of an extensive 

environmental program, covering biological and water analysis, water quality and water 

balance measurements, to name a few, to establish and monitor environmental baseline data 

requisite to the advancement of the project, and more specifically to initiate the tasks required 

to meet the guidelines for application of a selected area or areas of the Exploration License to 

the status of Exploitation License.  Ramboll Denmark is a global service provider which offers 

specialized expertise in all aspects of environmental impact assessments (EIA), nature 

restoration and protection, and environmental management to the benefit of sustainable 

 66



projects, according to ISO 14001 and EMASII.  The proposal was reviewed and approved by 

the author and is available upon request. 

Ramboll Denmark completed the field components of an Environmental Baseline Study with 

two persons based in the Ruby Island camp during a ten day window in September 2007. 

The baseline study was an integral part of the 2007 exploration program which included bulk 

sampling and detailed drilling of the Aappaluttoq occurrence. This study will provide the 

requisite baseline data necessary to advance directly to supplementary studies comprising an 

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).  The EIA is a mandatory requirement for acquisition 

of an Exploitation License. 

The environmental program involved a multi-faceted approach which included regional 

background water sampling, and coastal marine and terrestrial biological surveys.  Detailed 

basin hydrometry, water quality profiling, water chemistry and biological sampling were 

undertaken in the lake adjacent to the Aappaluttoq occurrence, the main area of detailed 

exploration.  The principal sampling areas for the environmental baseline study, to date, are 

shown in Figure 16. 

Samples and measurements were collected as listed as listed in Table 21 shown below.

Discussion notes are in preparation for a preliminary water balance based on precipitation 

data and the two discharge measurements with a more comprehensive discharge model being 

planned for the 2008 program which will be produced based on data from two recording 

pressure transducers located in the lake. 

The water and biological samples were shipped in September for analysis in Denmark.  A total 

of 20 water samples were received and submitted for analysis for suspended matter and 

metals (As, Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Hg) and discussion noted are in preparation at the time of 

writing. 

All of the biological samples were frozen, dried or otherwise preserved for analysis; the author 

approved preparation of cost estimates for the analysis and the proposal is pending. 

The full report of the field studies with details on methods, sample positions, maps and photos 

also is pending. 

Ten acid rock drainage samples, from selected process products, and weighing in aggregate, 

14.25 kilograms, were collected by True North in part to provide baseline site information on 

typical mineralized material and for the potential disposal of tailings currently stored in 

Fiskenaesset.  The samples will be delivered to Vancouver with the drill core and will be 

submitted to a commercial laboratory for heavy metal analysis and acid generation potential. 

 

UNIVERSITY RESEARCH PROGRAMS 
True North has co-ordinated and supported graduate and post-graduate research on its 

projects in both Canada and Greenland since its inception in 2002.  During 2005 and 2006, 

True North sponsored research carried out at the University of Cambridge in the United 

Kingdom focusing on the three distinct styles of ruby mineralization on the Fiskenaesset 

license. 

The graduate level research at Cambridge was completed by Meghan Ritchie of Sechelt, British 

Columbia, Canada, for which she has been awarded the Master of Science degree in Geology.  

The MSc thesis, entitled: "Development of Multiple Parageneses of Corundum Mineralization 

in the Fiskenaesset Anorthosite Complex, Southwestern Greenland", summarized six months 

of research conducted under the direction of Dr. T.J.B. Holland (Ph.D.) at the Department of 

Earth Sciences of the University of Cambridge.  The report has been reviewed by the author 

and is available upon request. 

The general results of the work are incorporated into the geological commentary in the earlier 

sections.  Of note, chief among the results were the recognition of several modes of formation 
 69



for the corundum occurring within the Fiskenaesset layered complex, and their pertinent 

paragenetic assemblages, primarily for the Kigutilik and Aappaluttoq occurrences.  The report 

has significant implications for the specific conditions responsible for the development of gem 

quality ruby and pink sapphire and also for the exploration targeting mechanisms for 

evaluating prospective terrain in the Fiskenaesset layered complex.  In light of the positive 

data generated by the MSc study, further work was recommended by True North to 

complement the ongoing exploration efforts. 

As such, during this work in 2005, a PhD program was proposed and, upon acceptance by the 

incoming thesis supervisor, Dr. Emil Makovicky, and the Department of Geology, was initiated 

at the University of Copenhagen by the same author in the fall session of 2006.  Financial, 

geological and technical support was provided by True North. 

The critical tasks of the PhD program were (1) to fully characterise the P/T conditions of 

formation for the multiple parageneses of corundum observed in the Fiskenæsset district; (2) 

to determine the geologic controls on economic ruby mineralization and diagnose their genetic 

relationships to the regional evolution of the Fiskenæsset layered complex; and (3) to compare 

and contrast the geology, origin and economic potential of the Fiskenæsset ruby district with 

the other famous ruby districts of the world. 

The following items were requisite for the PhD level research of the Fiskenaesset ruby district. 

 Detailed geologic mapping of seven corundum occurrences in the Fiskenæsset district 

 Phase petrology - to be carried out using optical and electron microscopy of polished 
thin sections and mounted sections. 

 Mineralogy - to perform electron microprobe analysis, X-ray diffractometry and ICP-MS 
analysis of ruby, sapphire and corundum. 

 Isotopic dating (U-Pb and Ar-Ar) - to determine the ages of the ruby mineralization 
relative to the age of the anorthosite complex. 

 Light stable isotopic analyses - to characterise the nature and origin of the geo-fluids 
involved in the ruby mineralization. 

 Whole-rock analyses - to track the migration of chromophore elements through 
metamorphism, metasomatism and hydrothermal activity. 

 Fluid inclusion studies – to test the P/T conditions calculated for crystal growth on the 
basis of micro-geochemical analyses. 

Preliminary geological, petrographic and microanalytical work, principally electron microprobe 

analysis (EMPA), was completed during the period from September 2006 to March 2007.  In 

the spring of 2007, the PhD work was initially deferred and by May 2007, support for the 

project, under its current author, was terminated.  The samples were placed into storage at 

 70



the University of Copenhagen and discussions to confirm a new candidate are underway to re-

initiate research. 

Additionally, mineralogical research at the University of British Columbia was contracted to 

Dr. Lee Groat of the Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences.  The research was focused on 

mineralogical analysis and inclusion studies of selected corundums collected during 2004 and 

2005 from the Siggartartulik, Aappaluttoq and Kigutilik occurrences, specifically examples of 

material comprising untreated, hydrofluoric acid (HF) treated and heat treated ruby and pink 

sapphire.  The Aappaluttoq corundums were selected from the 100 kilogram regolith sample 

recovered near the end of the field season while the other samples were collected from their 

respective 3 tonne mini-bulk samples.  The studies investigated corundum mineral chemistry, 

by scanning electron microscope and electron microprobe analysis, to detect chromophore 

elements particularly Fe, Cr, V and Ti, and also to identify the inclusion suite, and to compare 

the relationships between inclusion chemistry and colouration of the rubies and pink 

sapphires with and without acid or heat treatment. 

In summary, the study identified anorthite, chlorite, chromite-hercynite, spinel, potassic 

feldspar, kaolinite, dolomite, calcite, phlogopite, zircon, rutile, galena and possibly barite 

inclusions in Siggartartulik; albite, nickel-bearing chromite-hercynite, spinel, cassiterite and 

possibly garnet or amphibole from Aappaluttoq; and nickel-bearing chromite-hercynite, spinel, 

potassic feldspar and anorthite from Kigutilik.  Spinels typically are Mg-poor.  Chrome 

content, as expected, is directly related to degree of colouration; additionally, rubies generally 

contain spinels whereas pink sapphires display fewer or finer grained spinels, though the 

clarity and hence quality, not the colouration of the corundum, is controlled by the type and 

size of the contained inclusions.  Acid treatment exhibited no effects on the corundum or 

contained spinels, though silicate inclusions, as expected, were affected in an adverse 

manner.  Heat treatment of the Siggartartulik ruby sample indicated a paucity of spinel 

inclusions and highly variable Cr distribution.  Further work in this area of study will be 

initiated during the 2008 program, in particular to catalogue the nature of the effects and 

their potential for use in target prioritization and predictive gemmology. 

 71



SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
The 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 samples from Fiskenæsset were collected by standard 

techniques and recovery procedures common to the modern diamond and coloured gemstone 

industry. 

With respect to the extraction of bulk samples, ruby-bearing material was collected in 

contiguous blocks from measured geologic targets sampled normal to texture, foliation, 

stratigraphy and structure.  Samples were designed and oriented to provide valid tests of 

much-larger packages of similar styles and grades of ruby mineralization in the immediate 

vicinity of the sample site.  The scale of the sampling has progressed, on a results driven 

basis, from sampling of 1-3 tonnes in 2004 and 2005, to larger 30 tonne samples in 2006 and 

2007. 

In 2006, the two thirty tonne mini-bulk samples were excavated in much the same manner as 

the 2004 and 2005 mini-bulk samples; i.e., using diamond chain saws, micro-blasters, and 

hand-mining quarry techniques.  True North collected a contiguous sample, each comprising 

10 cubic metres measured, about 30 tonnes estimated from the helicopter sling weight.  Both 

samples consisted of continuous surface excavations measuring 2 metres in depth, by 1 metre 

width, by 5 metres along strike length.  Extraction typically averaged about 1.5 tonnes per 

work day, ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 tonnes per shift.  Due to the thirty-three day timeline 

required for the Aappaluttoq sample collection, project records indicate that blasting was 

undertaken on several days during the Kigutilik sampling to minimize the sample collection 

period to only eleven days.  In addition, the four-to six man field crews also used an air-mobile 

portable track-hoe fitted with a pneumatic hammer to reduce the size of individual rock 

fragments before loading the shipping bags.  The helicopter lift scale was the primary control 

on extraction weight, and is accurate to only ±50 kilograms.  The differences between sampled 

weight and plant weights are due in part to the accuracy of the helicopter sling and the 

absence of a large scale for feed measurements at the process plant. 

In the proposal for the 2007 exploration program submitted to the BMP, the author 

recommended the additional bulk sampling to test Aappaluttoq and several other occurrences; 

a total of 100 tonnes was recommended, requested, and approved by BMP, including at least 

50 tonnes from the Aappaluttoq main site, 10 tonnes from the drill section points and 10 1-3 

tonne samples collected from new exploration sites. 

The larger sampling weight for the Aappaluttoq site was recommended and requested by the 

author to provide sufficient facetable gem quality material to confirm flowsheet design 

including optical sorting, gemological valuation and economic analysis of the Aappaluttoq site.  

 72



The site is known to contain very abundant ruby and pink sapphire though the vast majority 

of the material, recovered to date, is dominated by small goods and cabochon grade material.  

In order to provide an adequate size and quality distribution for the facetable portion, 

particularly for the coarser sizes and higher quality gem, larger samples must be processed to 

recover sufficient polished goods to adequately define a frequency and value curve for the 

independent economic evaluation of the project.  These data will be a key line item to move 

forward with the development of the project and are expected to be required by the regulatory 

agencies to fulfil documentation for a 43-101 compliant resource. 

As noted, the 2004 Siggartartulik mini-bulk sample, five 2005 three-tonne mini-bulk samples, 

2006 30 tonne bulk samples from Aappaluttoq and Kigutilik, and the 1st 2007 Aappaluttoq 25 

tonne bulk sample were excavated in the same manner by diamond chain saw, chisels, pry 

bars and a large variety of hammers operated by key personnel from True North and a number 

of Fiskenaesset-based residents (Illustration 17).  The 2nd 2007 27 tonne bulk sample was 

collected from bedrock using focused, low intensity blasting with spaced charges of dynamite 

sticks to ensure grade and width control (Illustration 19).  This blasted sample was collected 

to provide an analysis of the gemmological criteria and gemstone conditions that would occur 

under typical mining conditions.  In addition, data collected from this sample will be used to 

compare grade and stone distribution data garnered from the earlier 2006 sample and the 

2007 portion of the Aappaluttoq bulk sample collected with chain saws and chisels.  All 

samples were packaged under the auspices of the bulk sampling supervisor in 1 tonne super 

sacs for shipment (Illustrations 21 and 22).  In 2007, the helicopter was used for delivery of 

samples to the processing plant in Fiskenaesset (Illustrations 23 and 24) though a 1,500 

kilogram digital platform scale was purchased to weigh all super sacs before and during 

processing (Illustrations 25 and 26).  Photographs were collected for each bag and the scale 

readout. 

Additional details are covered in the section "Exploration 2003-2006" and Exploration 2007 

Bulk Sampling". 

Diamond drilling of the Aappaluttoq, Sarfaq and Ridgetop occurrences was carried out to 

confirm the subsurface extent and tenor of mineralization reported by the geological surveys 

and previous bulk sampling exercises.  The principal focus of the drilling program was on the 

prospective Aappaluttoq occurrence.  Sampling of the drill core, expected to be carried out in 

January and February 2008, will be targeting interval displaying visible corundum 

mineralization and those intervals exhibiting alteration assemblages consistent with ruby and 

pink sapphire exposed in the surface trenches at Aappaluttoq.

SECURITY 
Sample security is assured at all times by written chain of custody extending from the 

Qualified Person in the field representing True North Gems Inc., through to the laboratory's 

designated signing officer at SGS Lakefield, SGS Cornwall and Saskatchewan Research 

Council.  Additionally, these protocols are followed with the sample transmittal couriered via 

Brinks Security Ltd. International passing Peace Bridge Brokers International inbound to 

Canada, Blue Water Shipping in Nuuk and Secure Freight in Canada, Royal Arctic Lines and 

Eimskip Canada for maritime shipments to Halifax and via transport truck and train to SGS 

Lakefield, and Manitoulin Transport for truck shipments from SGS Lakefield to Vancouver, 

with all of the above terminating with logged-in reception by designated, and where available, 

qualified and/or independent monitoring and confirmation of delivery at True North Gems' 

Vancouver office. All samples are registered upon arrival at contract facilities and at the True 

North office in Vancouver.  All products leaving the Vancouver office are listed in transmittal 

letters and tracked from source to third party facility and on return to source.  Every effort is 

maintained to provide full material balances for each product. 

Export permits are required for all materials leaving Greenland, and all requisite permitting 

was submitted by the author, and approvals were completed from BMP prior to sample 

shipping from Nuuk. Additionally, quarterly reports are required by the BMP for all samples 

leaving Greenland accompanied by all tracking documentation, processing summaries and 

inventories of products at each stage of the processing stream from beneficiation to 

manufacturing and prototype jewellery production. 

In 2004 and 2005, all samples were sealed on site in 1-tonne poly bags and transported by 

helicopter to Fiskenaesset, and by ship to Nuuk, where they were loaded into locked sea-cans 

for the scheduled sealift to Canada.  The samples shipped to Canada were delivered to SGS 

Minerals Services in Lakefield, Ontario, for gravity concentration by standard DMS methods 

routine in the modern diamond industry. 

In 2006, concentrates from the on-site plant were shipped to Germany for optical sorting and 

to Vancouver for hand sorting, both via Brinks Security. 

In 2007, in terms of the project-wide emphasis on elevated sample security, all samples are 

numbered, tagged and packaged at the Ruby Island base camp and at the Fiskenaesset office 

with final oversight by BMP prior to delivery to Nuuk. 

In 2007, all concentrates from the new on-site plant were bagged, weighed and photographed 

prior to inspection and shipment with BMP oversight to the secure carrier in Nuuk and were 

forwarded by an international bonded maritime carrier, and by secure air shipment to 

 81



Canada.  Delivery of the rough concentrates to True North's Vancouver laboratory for primary 

sorting is expected on January 4, 2008.  All rough concentrate parcels will be thoroughly 

inspected and weighed, and chain of custody documentation will be completed by True North's 

Qualified Person and Wardrop Engineering. 

In 2007, intervals for detailed logging and sampling for contained rubies and pink sapphires 

were selected, all boxes sealed with lids and screws, and stacked on pallets for helicopter 

delivery to Fiskenaesset.  No core intervals were removed at site prior to shipping.  All pallets 

were sealed with heavy gauge wire prior to shipping. 

The unprocessed bulk sample (27.8 tonnes), drill core, and rock and channel samples from 

the 2007 exploration program were sealed and delivered by ferry to Nuuk, locked into four 

shipping containers, and forwarded by bonded commercial container ships to Canada.  

Additionally, True North shipped an aggregate weight of 3.4 tonnes in eight sealed one-tonne 

bags comprising thirty-two mini bulk and sixty-one channel samples from selected ruby and 

pink sapphire occurrences.  Sealed containers of bulk samples and drill core, from the 

Aappaluttoq, Sarfaq and Ridgetop occurrences, will be delivered to SGS Minerals Services 

facilities in Lakefield, Ontario and Delta, British Columbia in December 2007 and January 

2008, respectively.  All samples will be inspected on receipt and chain of custody 

documentation will be completed by True North, SGS and Wardrop Engineering. 

In Fiskenæsset, the security measures employed by True North include but are not limited to 

project management by a NI 43-101 qualified person (QP), specifically the author in 2007, and 

direct supervision upon a small, well-trained, well-known and reliable crew by senior plant 

manager, certified gemmologists and project QP.  As the process facilities are located in the 

village of Fiskenaesset, and the local custom of all open areas being for the use of any 

residents of Greenland, daily vigilance was required to minimize access for both safety and 

security issues.  One of the senior True North personnel was present during all operating 

hours.  Video security cameras (three) were fixed to the adjacent buildings in conspicuous 

locations.  Signs, in the Greenlandic language, indicating safety concerns were posted on the 

adjacent buildings, and continued communication with the local population with reference to 

safety issues and project security is conducted throughout the operating season.  Additionally, 

True North herein notes the strong support extended by the local population for employment 

and training initiatives developed by the Company in co-operation with the Nuuk Kommunea 

and the business community.  Periodic tours of the facilities, accompanied by the senior 

personnel, were provided to representatives of the Nuuk Kommunea, BMP and the Joint 

Committee.  All plant equipment and supplies were fitted in lockable sea containers.  These 

containers were kept locked when not in use and at night. 
 82



All collected rubies were kept under lock and key, and were deposited to the secure sorting 

facility on a daily or more frequent basis, as required, by the plant manager and/or project 

manager.  Storage of completed field concentrates utilized a safe with a key and number code 

entry, all within a double locked office with inside and outside security monitoring with 

multiple television feeds (four low light cameras) to the project manager's office. 

Similar diligence was enacted at the remote sampling site with senior geological personnel 

oversight on all daily activities and restriction of access to the area in non-working hours.  

Access to the site required either helicopter or boat; the latter was required when air access is 

limited by weather conditions.  Access to the Ruby Island base camp was restricted to 

helicopter service from Fiskenaesset, unless maritime access was approved due to weather 

conditions and environmental survey operations.  Search protocols are included with all 

contracts for employment. 

In Vancouver, the security procedures include but are not limited to registered take-in from 

international customs brokerage services delivered by bonded carriers, office delivery by 

licensed armed escort as required, vault storage behind bullet-proof security doors under 

continuous closed-circuit camera monitoring and multiple entry access codes, and detailed 

spreadsheet tracking of rough and polished products, all under the supervision of certified 

gemmologists and the project's designated qualified person (QP). 

The in-place procedures pass independent audit by consultation review from security experts 

active in the gemstone industry (Rohtert, 2007) and oversight by Wardrop Engineering and 

BMP during site visits to the Fiskenaesset process and sorting office facilities, field sampling 

area at Aappaluttoq, and Ruby island base camp.  Sample transfer of concentrates and drill 

core to and from the Vancouver office will be subject to oversight by Wardrop Engineering in 

conjunction with the author, True North's internal QP.

including the 43-101 reports prepared by the previous project manager and at the time, 

qualified person for True North, and is fully satisfied that the data discussed herein is true 

and accurate, is presented with complete disclosure and is expected to withstand any 

measure of scrutiny. 

All contained gemmological data has been reported by certified gemmologists, including both 

in-house and independent parties.  The author has reviewed the handling protocols for sample 

tracking and secure transport, material balance data, and reporting protocols for independent 

valuations, and is satisfied that the information presented herein is true and accurate. 

 

MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
This section provides a summary description of all process testwork carried out by True North 

during the past few seasons of the project.  The information contained herein includes 

processing carried out by SGS Minerals Services Lakefield, SGS Mineral Services Cornwall, 

Optosort now known as Kammann Optosort, and Scan and Sort, now known as Commodas, 

Saskatchewan Research Council, and at True North's facilities in Fiskenaesset, and at the in-

house sorting facilities of True North in Vancouver. 

All of the testwork reports have been reviewed by the author, and the author is satisfied that 

the reports are complete and accurately represent the scope and results from the Fiskenaesset 

samples.  Additionally, the author has no reason to believe that all of the testing activities will 

not withstand the utmost scrutiny. 

The protocols and results of testwork is provided in chronological order, and includes any and 

all physical beneficiation studies on samples collected from the Fiskenaesset license.  

Summary results of pertinent manufacturing tests and product valuations are included under 

"Other Relevant Data and Information". 

In 2004, multiple sample splits of the Siggartartulik measured sample (2.584 tonnes) were 

processed in parallel to test the recovery efficiency of different extraction methodologies at the 

laboratories of SGS Lakefield, exploring a variety of standard mineral processing techniques 

for commercial gemstone extraction (SGS, 2005a-b).  The float sample (0.45 tonnes) was 

utilized in a series of optic-sorting and attrition milling tests at Scan and Sort GmbH in 

 84



Hamburg, Germany (SGS, 2005b).  Final hand sorting of the gemstone concentrate was 

completed by True North's gemmologists in Vancouver, British Columbia. 

Mechanized processing involved iterative crush and hand select, wash and screen of a 

secondary crush to -9.5+2 mm, DMS dense media separation at nominal S.G.=3.1, dry high 

intensity magnetic separation at 13,000 Gauss, attrition milling, heavy liquid separation using 

methyl iodide at S.G.=3.25, and finally, hand and mechanized optic sorting (Rohtert, 2006). 

In all, SGS delivered 150 kilograms of rough concentrate from six separate process streams 

and three experimental test parcels.  True North focused its attention on the coarse-grained, 

high-grade hand-select, DMS-sink, non-magnetic, attritioned, cleaned ruby concentrate sorted 

into gem, near-gem and non-gem classes. 

The final tally of the useable clean rough concentrate, by weight and grade in grams per 

tonne, recovered from the measured 2004 measured mini-bulk sample at Siggartartulik is 

summarized in Table 22. 

Table 22.  2004 Summary Results – Measured Mini-Bulk Sample from Siggartartulik 

2.584 tonnes Gem Near-Gem Total 
Total Weight (grams) 3,109 27,582 30,691 
Grade (grams/tonne) 1,204 10,674 11,878 

 

Optical sorting tests of the Siggartartulik material indicated excellent potential for rapid and 

high recovery separation of ruby and pink sapphire from gangue minerals, including both 

liberated and partially liberated corundum, generally ranging in size from 1.7-6.3mm (SGS, 

2005b). 

In 2005, for the five mini-bulk samples collected at Upper Angnertusoq, Lower Angnertusoq, 

Kigutilik, Ruby island and Qaqqatsiaq, the volume was maintained constant at 1 cubic metre 

comprising approximately three tonnes.  The process flowsheet was similar to that described 

for the Siggartartulik sample.  The samples were reduced to a combined 884.85 kilograms of 

DMS concentrate at SGS Lakefield (Table 23) representing a 94.1% mass reduction.  All of the 

samples exhibited in excess of 90% weight rejection after DMS and magnetic separation 

followed by tertiary screening at 1.7mm to remove the fines fraction as shown in Figure 19 

(SGS, 2006a, 2006b). 

 85



Table 23.  2005 Mini-Bulk Samples and DMS Concentrates 

Prospect Mini-Bulk Sample (kg)* DMS Concentrate (kg) 

Kigutilik 2950 218.60 

Upper Angnertusoq 2975 283.75 

Lower Angnertusoq 2850 152.15 

Ruby Island 3000 135.05 

Qaqqatsiaq 2975 95.30 

 

Subsequently, optic sorting of the medium-grained and coarse-grained fractions of the DMS 

sink was completed by SGS Cornwall, whereas the fine-grained fraction was sorted optically at 

Scan & Sort.  Mechanized optical sorting results compared favorably with hand sort data 

prepared by True North gemmologists in Vancouver.  The results are summarized in Table 24 

and graphically represented in Figure 20.  The data clearly indicates significant variability 

between localities in both rough grade and colour proportion, i.e., ratio of ruby to pink 

sapphire, and points to the potential in terms of rough grade and proportion of ruby to pink 

sapphire for the Kigutilik and Upper Angnertusoq occurrences. 

Based upon detailed analysis of the successful 2005 results, only measured samples were 

collected in 2006, and only a single process flowsheet was utilized in the field facilities in 

Fiskenaesset and at the SGS facilities in Lakefield and Cornwall (SGS, 2006a-d). 

In addition to the concentrates derived from laboratory processing of the 2005 mini-bulk 

samples, True North also recovered 244 grams of coarse gem-grade material and 533 grams of 

total gem ruby and pink sapphire from hand washing and screening of the 100 kilogram 

discovery sample collected from the Aappaluttoq ruby occurrence as shown in Table 25. 

The stone count is particularly significant as both the large percentage of gem-quality stones 

and also the high percentage of gem crystals greater than 8 mm in size.  The average weight of 

the 113 stones that make up the combined +8 mm gem fraction is 2.25 grams with a range 

from 0.72 grams to 9.63 grams (Rohtert, 2006, 2007).  The excellent results from this initial 

Aappaluttoq surface sample were sufficient to justify bulk sampling of the occurrence in 2006.

The 2005-2006 Aappaluttoq bulk sample was processed by a four to six man crew using a 

conventional gravity wash plant.  The wash plant was in part designed, built and operated by 

SGS Minerals Services Europe, and the flow sheet is presented as Figure 9 (SGS, 2006d)  The 

wash plant consisted of two staged crushers, and two stacked, coarse and fine screen 

vibratory units, followed by a single hydraulic-powered jig; all unit processes are fed by hand 

contributing to the low throughput of less than 0.5 tonnes per hour. 

Primary rock breaking was accomplished in the field using the pneumatic hammer attached to 

the air-mobile track hoe, and in the yard using a hand-held pneumatic hammer and chisels.  

Five industrial tumblers and a modified cement mixer provided for further attrition of the 

concentrates prior to mineral selection.  The rectangular screens split the feed into three 

nominal grain sizes: +1.7 mm, +3.4 mm, and +6.3 mm, with a very coarse oversize at +10 mm 

sent back to re-crush using the small jaw crusher.  Approximately 8.4 tonnes (30 percent) of 

the sample weight was rendered to undersize during primary crushing. 

The hydraulic jig processed less than 0.5 tonnes of coarse and medium fraction per 10-hour 

shift; whereas the fine fraction jigged around 1.0 tonne per shift; in all approximately 12 

tonnes of material were processed through the jig during the 2006 season.  Some 445 

kilograms of scientific and diplomatic specimens were selected and removed from the run-of-

mine in advance of crushing operations; if possible, the majority of these samples which are 

still available will be in large part processed during 2007 and compiled with the 2006 sample 

results.  In fact, all but 2.2 kilograms of representative mineralized samples were re-processed 

during the 2007 season.  The low daily throughput required hand sorting of a total of 5.701 

tonnes of very coarse oversize (-10+6.3mm) after re-crush down to 230 kilograms of material 

containing ruby and pink sapphire. The individual gravity concentrates, typically delivered in 

batches of 10 to 20 kilograms, ranged from around 5 percent to up to 50 percent total 

corundum, depending on the grain size, the head grade, and the feed rate of the sample. 

 88



Fine-grained, corundum-rich samples processed carefully attained up to 50% content, 

whereas coarse-grained, leaner samples processed quickly typically reported only better than 

5% corundum content. 

In all, 655.2 kilograms of hand sort and gravity sink product was collected from the 21.593 

tonnes processed through the wash plant.  The remainder of the 30 tonne samples reported to 

the -1.7mm fines fraction.

In Fiskenaesset, a total of 186.5 kilograms of primary concentrate was sorted, which included 

the 31.3 kilograms of material hand-mined from Aappaluttoq, the 5.3 kilograms of material 

removed after crushing, and 149.9 kilograms of concentrate from the wash plant. 

The primary hand sorting yielded 61.49 kilograms of ruby rough with 8.548 kilograms of "eye-

clean" gem, 11.484 kilograms of gem and 16.031 kilograms of near-gem.  Interim cleanup with 

grain separation and removal of matrix using vibratory tumblers commonly demonstrated 

potential quality class upgrades. 

Additional hand sorting in Vancouver and optical sorting in Germany reduced the 530.72 

kilograms of concentrate to 134.99 kilograms of gem (58.1 kg), and near-gem (76.9 kg) ready 

for HF treatment, tumbling and subsequent cutting.  Optical sorting by OptoSort GmbH was 

conducted successfully on its portion approximately 80.5 kilograms of -3.4+1.7mm fine 

concentrate (Table 26); drying and screening at 1.7mm reduced the initial concentrate weight 

to 67.15 kilograms.  Successful separation by both gem class (clarity or transparency) and 

colour were identified, and further optimization of the sorting instrumentation was expected to 

enhance the product quality.  Optic sorting products were subsequently rationalized with 

hand-sorting products based upon similarity in size, colour, and clarity. 

A very small suite of exceptional goods were selected for direct cutting prior to further 

processing of the concentrate products; the results of the cutting and independent valuation 

are provided in "Other Relevant Data and Information".

Hydrofluoric acid treatment at SRC and tumbling exercises in Vancouver resulted in a 

reduction to 85.66 kilograms of clean rough ready for shipment to cutting.  Of this total, two 

representative 1/8th splits were taken for direct cutting of the entire segment, without 

additional preparatory treatment.  The second 1/8th split was shipped for independent rough 

valuation.  The remaining 6/8th sample has been submitted for cutting and partial results 

have been received; final results for these fractions of the 2006 Aappaluttoq bulk sample will 

be provided in an updated 43-101 report. 
 92



As noted, a portion of the loose polished goods, totalling 324.1 carats in 9,601 pieces, was 

utilized for preparation of prototype jewellery as described in the section "Other Relevant Data 

and Information". 

As noted, the partial results indicated high grade, excellent separation response, successful 

manufacturing tests and a suitability for commercially acceptable jewellery production.  An 

escalated program of bulk sampling and drilling on the Aappaluttoq occurrence was 

warranted, recommended and approved for the 2007 program. 

In 2007, the re-design and increased capacity of the existing test plant permitted enhanced 

processing in terms of time, process optimization and sample handling protocols; the plant 

was completely redesigned with electrical (generator power source), new primary and 

secondary crusher, jigs, rebuilt screens and tertiary crushers.  All of the equipment other than 

the large primary crusher were housed in sea containers and fully wired for electrical hook-

ups for equipment and lighting.  Portable security cameras were located at three points of 

oversight at the plant area. 

The new processing plant is comprised of a large capacity jaw for two stage primary crushing 

of nominal -30 cm (-12 inch) feed (Illustration 27), hand cobbing of the oversize material for 

large rubies and pink sapphires (Illustrations 28 and 33), jaw and roll for secondary and 

tertiary crushing (Illustration 29), two double-deck washing and sizing screens (Illustration 

30), and two Denver duplex mineral jigs (Illustration 31), which concentrate the ruby and pink 

sapphire by gravity separation (Illustration 32).  Primary drying, screening and sorting of 

selected concentrates was carried out in secure facilities in Fiskenaesset (Illustration 34). 

Commissioning of the new plant was carried out successfully using 5 tonnes of process 

tailings from the 2006 Aappaluttoq bulk sample.  Since commissioning, True North completed 

processing of its outstanding 2006 Kigutilik 30 tonne bulk sample, the 800 kg Siggartartulik 

channel/mini-bulk sample, the 2007 Aappaluttoq 30 tonne sample, 2006 Aappaluttoq 5 tonne 

soil sample and the 2007 Aappaluttoq 30 tonne soil sample. 

The detailed sample weights, for the 102 tonnes processed in 2007, are provided in Table 27.

All of the concentrates were sealed and delivered by helicopter, under BMP oversight, to Nuuk 

and were forwarded by Blue Water Shipping, an international bonded carrier, to be shipped by 

secure air shipment to Canada (Illustration 35).  Delivery to True North's Vancouver 

laboratory for primary sorting is expected in January 2008.  A summary of all process 

products and unprocessed samples which were prepared for shipment is provided in Table 29.  

All samples remaining on site in Fiskenaesset are shown in Table 30.

The overall performance of the bulk sample collection and the design upgrades to the 

Fiskenaesset processing plant realized excellent processing results despite the late start of 

plant operations due to the international shipping timelines and complete re-construction of 

the equipment including all design and electrical requirements.  The processing has generated 

significant volumes of high quality concentrates for sorting, rough grade determination, 

manufacturing tests and independent valuation of the clean rough and loose polished rubies 

and pink sapphires, from three priority occurrences. 

By comparison, the first 2007 Aappaluttoq bedrock sample returned lower volume, though 

higher grade, process concentrate than the 2006 sampling.  In both cases, rough grades 

continue to be measured in kilograms per tonne ruby and pink sapphire.  Further results 

from the processing and sorting operations will be provided in an updated 43-101 report. 

 

MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
To date, no independent mineral resource or mineral reserve has been identified or defined on 

Fiskenaesset exploration license 2003/03. 

As of the report date, geological mapping and diamond drilling information for the Aappaluttoq 

occurrence is being compiled for the independent qualified person to generate a three 

dimensional geological model with view to preliminary determination of resource potential.  

The results of the initial modelling exercise, with the current geological database, including 

the 2006 and 2007 bulk sampling programs, are expected in the second quarter of 2008. 

 95



As noted previously, Wardrop Engineering, an internationally recognized engineering firm, is 

engaged as Independent Qualified Person to provide site due diligence, quality assurance, and 

preparation of a Preliminary Economic Assessment Report (PEAR) of the Aappaluttoq ruby 

occurrence.  Wardrop's scope of services for the initial phase of the engineering program was 

reviewed and approved by the author.  The documentation for the study is available upon 

request. 

 

OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
The following relevant data and information have been considered for inclusion in this report. 

As gemmology, manufacturing and mineral valuation data have no formal section under the 

43-101 guidelines, a summary of the first two subjects along with three reports dealing with 

the independent valuation of loose polished goods, representing manufactured products from 

the Fiskenæsset license, are presented herein. The section "Valuation" describes only those 

subsets of polished rubies and pink sapphires which, to date, have been forwarded for 

independent valuations. 

GEMMOLOGY 
Due in large part to the quality of the rough concentrates, loose polished goods and gemstone 

potential recognized at Aappaluttoq, the following commentary on colouration and gem quality 

classification is focused on the Aappaluttoq corundum recovered during the 2005 and 2006 

sampling programs.  Similar activities and protocols are performed on all gemstone products 

from channel, mini-bulk and/or bulk samples from each locality, and differences in optical 

and morphological characteristics, specific to metasomatic and hydrothermal parageneses, 

will be defined, quantified and documented, to a greater degree, during the 2008 season. 

Native gemstones from Aappaluttoq cross six pages in colour space, from Orangey Red to 

Purple, with most of the population lying on the three pages from Magenta to Slightly Purplish 

Red.  High saturations at light tones are seen in the native state for ruby and pink sapphire in 

contiguous, but strictly to the definition, non-overlapping colour fields (GemDialog, 1982). 

The "Gem" class is noteworthy for four features including transparency and semi-

transparency within the native state, requiring no heat treatment; directional diaphaneity 

prominent in red and weak in pink; larger grain sizes and better qualities report to pink than 

to red; and, predominance of red in the specials, though coarse-grained pink prismatic 

subhedra also have been observed.  Red gem is most clear on the A-pinacoid, and least on the 

C axis.  Pink gem is most clear on the C axis, and least on the A-prism (Rohtert, 2006, 2007). 

 96



The "Near-Gem" is excellent to high to moderate quality material, commonly consisting of 

mixed liberated corundum and partially liberated corundum with minor attached gangue 

minerals, sorted from the top-down.  When worked by tumbling, re-crushing and/or HF 

leaching, portions of the near-gem upgrade to gem.  The remainder will yield rough stock for 

cabochons, beads, and carvings. 

The "Non-Gem", or coloured waste, in certain occurrences, commonly contains minor to trace 

amounts of gem-quality blue kyanite, and gem quality yellow green kornerupine and bright 

green pargasite, along with attached silicate gangue minerals. 

The "Morphologies", which were collected as a separate component only during 2006, include 

a high percentage of red gem, especially in the dentes or "Teeth", which are clean, broken or 

doubly-terminated spar-tip prisms. 

HISTORIC VALUATION 
From a historical perspective, the first known valuation of rubies from the Siggartartulik 

occurrence was reported by Geisler (1981) on a small number of rubies cut from 108.48 grams 

the hand selected high grade material (Anderson, 1995).  The largest faceted gem weighed 

1.52 carats, with the remainder less than 0.50 carats.  The polished goods, grading from 

commercial quality to rare fine quality gemstones, valued wholesale to collectors, at an 

average price of approximately CAD$30 per carat for cabochons and CAD$45 per carat for 

facet goods in 1980 dollars.  Of significance, the rubies were native gemstones, untreated and 

with no enhancement.  No discrete valuation report was available for public review; the data is 

not considered 43-101 compliant and is provided, only for completeness of disclosure, as per 

the assessment report prepared, for the BMP in Greenland, by Geisler (1981). 

MANUFACTURING 
The polishing of the test samples, of ruby and pink sapphire clean rough, selected from the 

Siggartartulik and Aappaluttoq mini-bulk and bulk sample concentrates, was completed at 

independently operated facilities in Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and Canada.  The test parcels, 

to date, have been subjected to HF cleaning, heat treatment and/or cutting and polishing, to 

allow for the experimentation, documentation and optimization of the downstream production 

for gem quality, colouration, clarity, cuttability, yield and value. 

To date, manufacturing tests have been conducted on selected ruby and pink sapphire rough 

material originating from the 2004 Siggartartulik, 2005 Kigutilik, 2005 Upper Angnertusoq, 

2005 Aappaluttoq and 2006 Aappaluttoq samples.  In addition, the largest ruby specimen 

collected thus far from the Aappaluttoq occurrence, weighed in at 80 grams and was selected 

 97



for carving; a 302 carat carving was completed by Tom McPhee, a renowned artist located on 

Vancouver Island. 

A review of the detailed tabulations describing individual shipments, facilities and general 

protocols, and loose polished goods has been reviewed by the author and is available upon 

request.  To date, manufacturing, in terms of cutting tests or for determination of polished 

yields and grades, has not yet been completed on any of the 2004-2007 bulk samples 

described herein and, as such, summary discussion of loose polished goods will be provided in 

an updated 43-101 report upon their completion.  Discussion only for independently valued 

packages of loose polished goods is provided in the following section. 

Transmittal documents accompany each shipment and waste material, loose polished goods 

and transmittal documents are returned to True North in Vancouver.  The author has 

reviewed the transmittal documents, and True North sample tracking and inventory 

documentation, and the information is available for review upon request. 

Additionally, the author has no reason to believe that all of the sorting, manufacturing and 

valuation activities will not withstand the utmost scrutiny. 

Examples of the loose polished goods produced from the Aappaluttoq occurrence, specifically 

the 2006 bulk sample, including both facet goods (Illustration 42) and faceted and calibrated 

melee, generally consisting of small goods of less than 10 points or the equivalent 0.10 carats 

(Illustration 43), are provided herein. 

As an integral part of the 2006 product valuation and corporate marketing program, True 

North has manufactured through facilities in China, a suite of eight necklace and earring sets 

containing a total of 9,601 rubies and pink sapphires set in white, yellow and/or pink gold 

(see Illustrations 44 and 45).  All of the contained rubies and pink sapphires were sourced 

from a single screen size fraction of a 6/8th representative split of the 2006 Aappaluttoq bulk 

sample (see sections on sample split preparation in "Exploration 2007 - Bulk Sampling" and 

"Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testwork". 

The finished products have been well received by the jewellery and gemstone industry, and the 

investment community, and clearly exhibit the potential for the production of jewellery for 

commercial purposes, though these pieces, to date, have not been submitted for independent 

valuation or appraisal. 

INDEPENDENT VALUATION 
In the period up to December 1, 2007, three independent reports have been completed on 

rubies and pink sapphires recovered from the Siggartartulik and Aappaluttoq occurrences.  

 98



The valuations were performed on loose polished goods, including both faceted stones and 

cabochons. 

The valuation experts worked separately and independently, and may differ in their pricing 

methods going to context and conditions of sale, and sources of baseline pricing information. 

Wholesale valuation methods commonly employed include: (1) Rigorous gemological grading 

followed by strict comparison to the price-point matrices published quarterly by the wholesale 

gemstone industry; (2) Cursory grading followed by comparison to national import prices 

published annually (e.g., United States) to assign a value consistent with the global trade; 

and, (3) Casual grading followed by comparison to the current spot market. 

The reports were completed by two qualified independent professional gemmologists, Warren 

Boyd of Oakville, Ontario, Canada and John Mattinson of Vancouver, British Columbia (Boyd, 

2005; Mattinson, 2007a, 2007b).  Boyd (2005) and Mattinson (2007a, 2007b) rely primarily on 

current stone traffic through all market channels by monitoring sales of comparable rubies 

and pink sapphires at the wholesale level. 

The independence, qualifications, methodologies and reports prepared by both gemmologists 

have been reviewed and approved for distribution by the True North's in-house graduate 

gemmologists and by the author.  The full reports are appended (Appendices 4, 5 and 6).  

Tabulations of the principal datasets are included in this section. 

Boyd (2005) evaluated a suite of 30 polished rubies and pink sapphires originating from the 

2004 Siggartartulik 3-tonne mini-bulk sample.  This material was a hand picked parcel and is 

not considered to be statistically representative of the gem class material recovered from the 

Siggartartulik mini-bulk sample.  The rubies displayed a deep red colouration with a slight 

purplish overtone and clarity was poor.  All rubies were designated as commercial quality with 

a value of US$30 per carat. 

Two pink sapphires exhibiting optical properties comparing favorably with similar goods 

sourced from Sri Lanka, Madagascar and East Africa and, as such, values of US$400 and 

US$600 per carat. 

Boyd also reported that the natural and untreated condition of the sapphires point to the 

potential for value-added premiums. 

 99



The results are summarized in Table 31.

2004 Siggartartulik   ruby  28 0.14-1.91 30  $                   671  

 

Mattinson (2007a) completed the independent valuation of a second selected sample of 

twenty-seven (26) untreated, polished rubies and pink sapphires from the Aappaluttoq ruby 

occurrence, and one (1) pink sapphire from the 2004 Siggartartulik occurrence.  The loose 

polished goods were selected from the 2004 Siggartartulik (0.71 carats), 2005 Aappaluttoq 

(5.29 carats) and 2006 Aappaluttoq samples (27.59 carats) as indicated in Table 32.  This 

material was a preliminary hand picked parcel and is not considered to be statistically 

representative of the gem class material recovered from the above noted bulk samples.  The 

rubies and pink sapphires were graded from commercial to fine and valued at wholesale 

prices.

2004 Siggartartulik   pink sapphire  1 0.71 120  $                     85  
 

The wholesale valuation was highlighted by a 0.69 carat fine ruby valued at US$3,220 per 

carat and a 0.96 carat fine pink sapphire valued at US$460 per carat, both sourced from the 

2006 Aappaluttoq bulk sample (see Illustration 42).  The largest ruby, 5.70 carats, was priced 

at US$980 per carat for a total of US5,586, the highest dollar value for an individual stone on 

the project to date.  Of note, the 0.71 carat pink sapphire from Siggartartulik was valued at 

US$120 per carat whereas Boyd (2005) reported a value of US$600 per carat.  This difference 

in value underscores the requirement for multiple valuations of the loose polished goods due 

in part to the subjective nature of the evaluation and in part due to the subtle variances in the 

assignment of value per stone.  The results from the first parcel of the 2006 Aappaluttoq bulk 

 100



sample, indicate an average value of US$1,008.52 per carat for faceted rubies and US$328.02 

for faceted pink sapphires.  The parcel returned an average value for all stones of US$795.41 

per carat and a total value of US$20,952. 

Mattinson (2007b) completed the independent valuation of a second selected sample of four 

hundred and two (402) untreated, polished rubies and pink sapphires from the Aappaluttoq 

ruby occurrence, specifically the 2006 bulk sample as indicated in Table 32. 

In this case, a total of 400 pieces of rough weighing 221.7 grams were submitted for polishing 

in Sri Lanka, and a total of 402 polished rubies and pink sapphires, weighing 310.31 carats 

including both faceted and cabochon cut stones, were returned.  This material was a 

preliminary hand picked parcel and is not considered to be statistically representative of the 

gem class material recovered from the 2006 Aappaluttoq bulk sample.  The rubies and pink 

sapphires were graded from commercial to fine and valued at wholesale prices. 

Table 33.   Summary of Mattinson Valuation (2007b)

 2006 Aappaluttoq   pink sapphire  20 NA 30-65  $                   667  

 

The results from the second parcel of the 2006 Aappaluttoq bulk sample, indicate an average 

value of US$75.77 per carat for faceted stones and $36.46 for cabochons.  The parcel returned 

an average value for all stones of US$54.78 per carat and a total value of US$17,000.  Overall, 

to date, the results from 208 faceted stones and 210 cabochons from the 2006 Aappaluttoq 30 

tonne bulk sample have returned a loose polished wholesale value of US$37,952 from a total 

of 337.90 carats of polished rubies and pink sapphires. 

The loose polished wholesale valuations are considered highly relevant to the potential for the 

ruby and pink sapphire mineralization on the Fiskenaesset license, provide the underlying 

basis for the escalating exploration expenditures reported from 2004 through 2007 and, as 

warranted by the author, provide the stimulus for the recommendations and budgets for 

continued work programs in 2008.

ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
There are no adjacent properties, designated in Greenland as exploration licenses, or to the 

author's knowledge, subject specifically to ruby exploration in West Greenland.  As such, no 

significant discussion of adjacent licenses or properties is deemed appropriate for this report. 

Two exploration licenses in the Fiskenaesset area, designated Akunnaat and Allumersat, held 

by Crew Gold Corporation, are undergoing active exploration for platinum group elements 

(PGE) and gold (Au)(personal communication, Blomsterberg, 2007); the exploration model for 

the former follows the Fiskenaesset layered complex centred on areas with stratigraphically 

and structurally thick exposures and known chromitite horizons.  No information on the 

current exploration is available in the public domain. 

Reconnaissance exploration was carried out by True North Gems in these areas under its 

prospecting license, prior to the application for exploration licenses during 2006 by a third 

party, Crew Gold Corporation.  As noted, the Fiskenaesset layered complex contains 

ultramafic lithologies, commonly associated with the presence of ruby corundum, proximal to 

areas prospective for platinum group elements (PGE), chrome, nickel, copper and other minor 

metals.  Minor exploration successes have been reported for these metals during the 1960's 

and 1970's (refer to section on Exploration History).  Gold typically is associated spatially with 

the relict greenstone belts though no significant or anomalous gold occurrences were noted 

during a preliminary review of the available literature. 

Several historical occurrences of corundum were documented (e.g. Rivalenti, 1974; Herd et al., 

1969, 1972, 1973; Walton, 1973) and others discovered by True North, primarily during its 

2005 exploration program, within the Fiskenaesset layered complex in the area now covered 

by the Akunnaat license.  These occurrences have been designated as Tuk, Pikiniq, 

Ivnaarssuunguaq, Sungasa Nuat and Lichtenfels.  In light of the active third party exploration 

of the adjacent Akunnaat license, it is deemed inappropriate, at this juncture, to report in 

detail on the exploration results from the True North reconnaissance program conducted on 

that area of its non-exclusive prospecting license.  However, summary information on the five 

occurrences of interest is provided below (Rohtert, 2006, 2007). 

Tuk, also known as Rivalenti's pegmatoid occurrence, contains corundum occurs in a set of 

desilicified pegmatites intruded into an ultramafic body in contact with an anorthosite 

horizon.  The corundum in these zones is largely non-gem, with rare near-gem to gem 

material. 

 102



Pikiniq, located in a region also known as "Rivalenti's fold nose", exhibited corundum at four 

localities on the contact of amphibolite with anorthosite in a large fold.  The corundum 

mineralization is restricted to phlogopitised anorthosite at several occurrences with pargasite, 

cordierite, red spinel and sapphirine in altered anorthosite (p. comm. Windley and Herd, 

2005). Corundum varies from pink in the phlogopitised anorthosite to dark pink with 

pargasite and cordierite. 

Ivnaarssuunguaq, similar to other promising occurrences on the Fiskenaesset license, 

occurred in an ultramafic body occurs adjacent to an anorthosite horizon, resulting in an 

alteration assemblage including phlogopite, anorthite, kornerupine, pargasite, sapphirine and 

corundum.  The corundum mineralization is dominated by pargasite zone type with dark pink 

crystals and near- to gem quality though the southern zone is dominated by phlogopitised 

anorthosite with sapphirine and pale pink corundum. 

The Lichtenfels occurrence lies is located close to the historical missionary site at the original 

location of the town that became Fiskenaesset.  It consists of two small, 2 metre x 4 metre 

zones of sapphirine and gedrite, with rare pink corundum.  The mineralized zones occur on 

the margins of a large, >5 metre by >100 metre chromite body contained within the 

anorthosite.  The corundum is less than 1.5cm on its maximum dimension, pale pink and 

opaque to translucent. 

At Sungasa Nuat, corundum was observed at one locality which was reported to be the most 

significant sapphirine showing in the Fiskenaesset district.  The mineralized zone comprised a 

2 metre by 5 metre gedrite and phlogopite alteration within anorthosite 50 metres from the 

amphibolite contact.  The corundum is dark pink and up to 1cm in maximum dimension.  

Clarity ranges from opaque to translucent. 

Two further occurrences of corundum were reported within the Fiskenaesset layered complex 

and within the Bjornesund greenstone belt, both located to the east and southeast of the 

Fiskenaesset license, respectively, during reconnaissance exploration conducted in 2005.  The 

occurrences were identified as Bjornesund and Qororssuaq.  The former was prospected by 

Geisler (1980) and co-ordinates were cited by Anderson (1994) though no specific information, 

other than the spatial coordinates and footprint of 8 metres by 500 metres, on the type of 

occurrence was reported.  Reference to the Bjornesund mapping project was provided in Appel 

(1992a) though the report has not been fully reviewed by the author at this time.  Based on its 

dimensions, this occurrence would represent one of the larger surface expressions for the 

known individual occurrences and warrants further investigation. 

 103



At Qororssuaq, preliminary investigations identified two large E-W-striking amphibolite 

horizons with an intervening, heavily foliated anorthosite, and several small ultramafic bodies 

contained within the anorthosite.  The northernmost of the two amphibolites may include an 

interleaved metasedimentary horizon, according to the regional geological mapping (GEUS, 

1985).  This unit was not confirmed by the prospecting group.  Both contacts of the 

anorthosite with amphibolite show mineralization.  Four corundum localities were reported by 

geologic mapping in the 1970's (Appel, 1995), though only one was confirmed in the current 

program.  The latter occurred on the northern amphibolite-anorthosite contact and was 

adjacent to an ultramafic body.  The corundum is fine-grained, granular, rusty-coloured, and 

was enveloped within a coarse, amphibole-rich host.  The zone of mineralization outcrops for 6 

metres along strike with an average width of 1 metre.  The Qororssuaq valley, located to the 

north-northeast of the occurrence, exhibited extensive braided stream networks covering a 

large region comprised of thick fluvial to glaciofluvial deposits (see Appel, 1995) which 

warrants examination for alluvial heavy mineral accumulations, including ruby corundum. 

As noted in previous sections, given the significant exploration potential of the ruby and pink 

sapphire mineralization in the Fiskenaesset area, True North has taken steps to acquire 

additional exploration prospects not covered by current licenses, specifically the Fiskenaesset 

and Akunnaat licenses, held by True North through Brereton and Crew Gold Corporation, 

respectively.  Both Bjornesund and Qororssuaq are contained within one of the sub-areas of 

the Qaqqatsiaq license application registered by the BMP on June 1, 2007.  True North's 

application provides for acquisition of an additional 713 km2 exploration license contiguous 

with and adjacent to its 110 km2 Fiskenaesset license.  The license application consists of five 

separate property blocks (designated sub-areas) strategically located to cover known ruby 

occurrences and prospective geology for ruby mineralization in the Fiskenaesset District.  The 

formal ratification of the license application by the BMP and the requisite 

Greenland/Denmark government authorities, is expected in December 2007 and the 

acquisition will bring True North's total land position to 823 km2. 

Further a field in Greenland, GEUS field geologists (van Gool, 2006) officially confirmed, via an 

internal report, the discovery of ruby and pink sapphire in metamorphic rocks encountered in 

2004 and again in 2006 at a new locality in the Nuuk district approximately 150 kilometres 

north of Fiskenæsset.  Previously, Herd et al. (1969) had reported corundum from elsewhere 

in the same district and, along with Petersen and Secher (1993), also reported corundum from 

the Sukertoppen or Maniitsoq district, about 160 kilometres NNW of the capitol of Nuuk.  As 

such, there are now three (3) districts in Greenland reporting ruby and pink sapphire:  (1) 

Fiskenæsset; (2) Nuuk; and, (3) Maniitsoq.  All three occurrences lie upon the Archean craton 

 104



of southwest Greenland (see Figure 21).  Of note, ruby-pargasite boulders were reported in the 

Isukasia area between Nuuk and Maniitsoq near the Inland Ice (Appel, 1995). 

A compilation of ruby occurrences in the Fiskenaesset area was published by GEUS (Appel, 

1995) and an update by Appel, Herd and Windley is in press, with completed publication 

expected by the end of 2007.

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
First and foremost, given the significant exploration potential of the ruby and pink sapphire 

mineralization in the Fiskenaesset area, True North has applied to acquire additional 

exploration prospects contained within one of the sub-areas of the 713 km2 Qaqqatsiaq license 

application registered by the BMP on June 1, 2007.  Additionally, True North has prepared 

and submitted an application for the continuance of the exploration license for an additional 

five year term from 2008-2012, in parallel with license transfer application from Brereton to 

True North. 

True North's exploration license now covers more than twenty ruby and pink sapphire 

occurrences discovered near the village of Fiskenæsset.  Of the corundum parageneses 

identified to date, only the hydrothermal and metasomatic styles contain significant 

concentrations of gem quality corundum.  Hydrothermal ruby occurs most notably in outcrop 

at Aappaluttoq and at several other discrete locations northwards along the Ruby Island Line. 

The 2007 diamond core drilling of the Aappaluttoq occurrence has successfully intersected 

westerly-dipping ruby and pink sapphire mineralization, identified during core logging in 18 of 

46 holes, and has extended the strike length of the Aappaluttoq occurrence from the known 

15-20 metres exposed on surface in the main showing to more than 105 metres and to depths 

of more than 144 metres.  The drilling clearly intersected the Host Zone in up to six holes in 

multiple sections and, below an interval of anorthosite gneiss, was followed by a deeper and 

thicker interval of ultramafics, similar to the Host Zone, with phlogopite-rich or pargasite-rich 

mineralization.  Ruby mineralization within the interval, designated the Aappaluttoq Deep 

Zone contains the largest ruby and pink sapphire crystals, and most abundant in terms of 

apparent grade, in the drill holes completed to date.  Both zones of mineralization are open to 

depth and along strike; the Aappaluttoq Deep Zone is open toward surface for up to 125 

metres. 

The identification of the previously unrecognized Aappaluttoq Deep mineralization will 

contribute to a significant potential increase in target dimensions based on the strength and 

thickness of the mineralized intervals.  With the known Aappaluttoq mineralization remaining 

open to the north and to depth, the identification of ruby-bearing boulders on surface, and a 

favourable structural and mineralogical trend defined by drilling and mapping, a high priority 

target area has now been identified to pursue in future drilling programs between the 

Aappaluttoq and Sarfaq occurrences. 

True North continues to recognized new and growing potential value for the rubies and pink 

sapphires at Fiskenæsset, in large part due to the successful results of its exploration and 

 107



processing efforts.  Rough grades are highly significant and are reported from numerous 

occurrences.  At Siggartartulik, the ruby and pink sapphire combined gem and near-gem 

rough mini-bulk sample grade of 11,878 g/t including 1,204 g/t gem clearly warranted 

further exploration.  Both Kigutilik and Upper Angnertusoq returned high rough grades (see 

Table 34) and red/pink corundum ratios but a 100 kilogram discovery sample at Aappaluttoq 

returned 244 grams of coarse gem grade material and 533 grams of total gem and near-gem 

was the highlight of the 2005 exploration efforts.  The 2006 Aappaluttoq bulk sample then 

returned a ruby and pink sapphire rough grade of 4,600 g/t including 1,937 g/t gem.  In 

2007, on-site processing has generated 574 kilograms of heavy mineral concentrates for 

downstream processing from Aappaluttoq, Kigutilik and Siggartartulik. 

The results from bulk sampling, shown in Tables 34, clearly point to the potential of the 

project, particularly with the high grade and gem quality of the Aappaluttoq and Siggartartulik 

occurrences.  The former contains a coarser size distribution though recent exploration at the 

latter has identified new localities with large rubies to accompany the predominant smaller 

goods.  In general, the 2007 geological program has discovered several promising occurrences 

which confirms the continued prospectivity of the main area of the Fiskenaesset license. 

Table 34.   Summary Grade Comparison- Gem and combined Gem & Near Gem, Red/Pink 

Sample Gem + Near-Gem (kg/t) Gem (kg/t) Red/Pink 
2004 Siggartartulik 11.878 1.204 1.78 
2005 Kigutilik 8.688 1.056 1.64 
2005 Lower Angnertusoq 0.141 0.000 2.12 
2005 Upper Angnertusoq 4.717 0.994 1.41 
2005 Ruby Island 2.855 0.117 0.00 
2005 Qaqqatsiaq 0.861 0.102 0.65 
2006 Aappaluttoq 4.498 1.937 0.36 

 

Despite the small volumes of carats produced to date, the project exhibits significant potential 

for the presence of large and valuable gems; individual gem to near-gem, euhedral ruby and 

pink sapphire crystals to more than 20 grams have been recovered from the colluvium directly 

overlying the Aappaluttoq occurrence.  Preliminary cutting and polishing of selected rough 

from 2006 Aappaluttoq has returned gem quality faceted material up to 5.70 carats valued at 

US$980 per carat, and independent valuations of individual polished stones to $US3,220 per 

carat reported for a 0.69 carat round ruby and $US460 per carat for a 0.96 carat pink 

sapphire.  The predominance of smaller goods is common to similar paragenetic models from 

other global occurrences. 

 108



Given the number, rough grade and quality of ruby occurrences located in just three full 

seasons of exploration, the author believes strongly in the coloured gemstone potential of the 

Fiskenæsset district.  Of particular note, the Fiskenaesset rubies and pink sapphires respond 

well to beneficiation, optical sorting, concentrate processing, heat treatment, and polishing, 

and are well suited to production of commercial jewellery. 

Initial testing of the optical sorter technology for the recovery of rubies and pink sapphires 

returned excellent separation results despite less than optimum operating conditions and 

further testwork will be conducted on the 2007 bulk sample concentrates.  This technology 

will be key element in the development of the process design and, based on the initial results, 

will contribute to optimization of liberation yields, particularly for the coarse size fractions. 

The 2008 exploration program will build upon a successful results of 2004-2007 exploration 

sampling on the highest priority ruby occurrence, Aappaluttoq, known from among those 

located thus far in the Fiskenæsset ruby district of southwestern Greenland. 

In short, it was recommended herein to proceed on the Aappaluttoq occurrence with 

additional bulk sampling and detailed large diameter (HTW) diamond drilling with a view to 

resource definition which will meet the geospatial criteria necessary for a scoping study, 

specifically a Preliminary Economic Assessment Report (PEAR) and, if positive, moving forward 

directly with development plans via a subsequent pre-feasibility analysis. 

 109



RECOMMENDATIONS AND BUDGET 
The objectives of the 2008 exploration program will, to a major degree, build upon a 

successful results of 2004-2007 exploration sampling and the preliminary economic 

assessment report on the highest priority ruby occurrence, Aappaluttoq, known from among 

those located thus far in the Fiskenæsset ruby district of southwestern Greenland.  Key 

development program components will comprise advanced exploration and grade drilling, 

engineering and environmental studies, process flowsheet development, and process plant 

design engineering.  The property-scale exploration program will include exploration drilling 

and detailed mapping of the 1.5 kilometre strike length attributed to the folded limb of the 

Fiskenaesset layered complex containing the highly prospective Siggartartulik occurrence, 

additional property exploration on the Fiskenaesset license to follow up on significant results 

from the 2007 channel sampling, and regional exploration on the adjacent Qaqqatsiaq license, 

pending its approval. 

In 2008, the recommended exploration program for the Fiskenaesset license will be 

highlighted by several milestones, as follows, with the focus on the continued development of 

the Aappaluttoq occurrence. 

 Complete DMS, magnetic and optical sort processing of the 2007 mini-bulk and bulk 
concentrates at contract facilities in Canada and additional confirmatory design tests at 
manufacturing operations in Germany 

 Complete processing of 2007 channel samples and prioritize additional targets for 
follow-up bulk sampling and/or drilling 

 Complete final sorting of hand sort and optical sort concentrates in Vancouver 

 Complete downstream processing of representative portions of the 2007 gravity 
concentrates to permit valuation and grade determination 

 Complete the first year Environmental Baseline Study 

 Complete the Phase 1 Aappaluttoq engineering study 

 Confirm engagement of the Phase 2 Aappaluttoq engineering study to include resource 
determination, site pre-engineering and mine plan design, process plant design, initial 
permitting, environmental and socio-economic planning and development 

 Complete not less than 3,000 metres of HTW or PQ, primarily for grade sampling, over 
the Aappaluttoq and Aappaluttoq Deep occurrences to outline the subsurface geology, 
gemstone continuity and distribution, including down-dip drilling of the known 
mineralization to permit a maximum amount of core for additional grade evaluation 

 Complete stripping of Aappaluttoq occurrence over a 150 metre strike length 

 Complete mini-bulk sampling of the Aappaluttoq occurrence along the exposed strike 
length sufficient for grade determination; a series of samples over 10m intervals is 
recommended to evaluate grade, rough value, polished yield and value, and size 
distribution curve variability 

 110



 Complete processing of up to 500 tonnes of mini-bulk and bulk samples in a modular 
gravity plant 

 Completion of the second year Environmental Baseline Study leading to an 
Environmental Impact Assessment meeting NERI guidelines 

 Complete 5,000 metres of exploration drilling on the Siggartartulik occurrence and 
several adjacent satellite occurrences 

 Complete geological studies, channel and mini-bulk sampling, and processing on the 
Siggartartulik and other priority exploration targets 

 Complete Phase 3 exploration drilling program over the Aappaluttoq occurrence to 
extend the subsurface geology to the south and to explore the region north to the 
Sarfaq occurrence, gemstone continuity and distribution 

 Complete the re-design, assemble and operate upgraded field processing plant for the 
preparation of sized gravity concentrates 

 Initiate Phase 3 exploration drilling program over the Aappaluttoq occurrence to extend 
the subsurface geology to the south and to explore the region north to the Sarfaq 
occurrence, gemstone continuity and distribution 

 Complete downstream processing of all samples collected prior to 2007 

 Continue third party valuations of final clean rough concentrates and loose polished 
wholesale (LPW) gemstones and, as approved, evaluation of market conditions through 
sales of gemstones on a LPW basis or within signature jewelry pieces 

 Initiate university-based research into the ruby paragenesis, inclusion analysis and 
predictive gemmology primarily for optimized target generation and analysis, and 
downstream product planning and yield management 

 

The Greenland field program is expected to begin on June 1st and is projected to continue to 

September 30th.  The principal area of exploration lies forty-five minutes by helicopter, and 

four hours by boat, south of Nuuk.  The technical crew will be based in the Ruby Island base 

camp, which lies only two minutes from Aappaluttoq and five minutes from Siggartartulik, 

and only 18 kilometres from Fiskenaesset.  A second camp will be based at Siggartartulik for 

the drilling and mapping program.  The temporary field camps are proposed for up to 30 

persons as needed on a short-term seasonal basis, primarily geologists, drillers, miners, 

helpers, surveyors, cooks, and pilots, and will be serviced by helicopter and as required by 

boat, to support the geological mapping, prospecting, drilling and sampling operations. 

The bulk samples will be transported by helicopter to barges for transport to the processing 

facility. 

Bulk sampling is recommended to test Aappaluttoq and several other occurrences; a total of 

not more than 250 tonnes is recommended mainly from the Aappaluttoq main site with 

several 3 tonne samples collected from new exploration sites. 

 111



The complement of exploration and support personnel will emphasize local hires, including a 

wide range of geological and environmental consultants, and companies offering maritime and 

air transport, construction, blasting and logistics services, as per the standard operating 

parameters for True North's projects.  Outreach programs with the local artisans will continue 

and discussions with respect to individuals representing lapidary, design and goldsmithing 

skills will be initiated in the near future. 

The summary budget distribution for the Fiskenaesset project is given below.  Detailed 

monthly cost, task and personnel GANNT charts are in the planning stages. 

 Project Management C$     500,000 
 Project Logistics and Equipment 750,000 
 Camp Operations 1,250,000 
 Bulk Sampling 500,000 
 Processing and Sorting 750,000 
 Diamond Drilling 2,000,000 
 Transportation – air, maritime 2,000,000 
 Engineering and Environmental Studies 750,000 
 Property Exploration 250,000 
 Regional Exploration 250,000 
 Contingency 500,000 
 Total C$ 9,500,000 
 

The author, as Qualified Person (QP) and project manager of the Fiskenaesset ruby 

exploration project prepared the 2008 exploration program and budget, and believes that the 

advanced exploration leading from the 2007/2008 scoping study to a pre-feasibility study in 

2009 is fully warranted based on the results to date and fully endorses the program outlined.
