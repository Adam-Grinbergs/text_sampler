1 Executive Summary 

1.1 Introduction 

JDS Energy & Mining Inc. (JDS) was commissioned by Constantine Metal Resources Ltd. (Constantine or 

the Company) to manage and compile a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Palmer Project 

(Palmer or the Project), the results of which are summarized in this Technical Report as per the guidelines 

of the Canadian Securities Administrator's National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Form 31-101F1. Other 

contributors to this PEA include Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd., Core Geoscience Services Inc., and Advantage 

Geoservices Ltd.  

The PEA is a preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too 

speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them and cannot be categorized as 

Mineral Reserves. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not demonstrate economic viability. 

There is no certainty that the economic projections presented in the PEA will be realized. 

1.2 Project Description and Ownership 

The Palmer Project is located 60 km northwest from Haines, Alaska in the Alaska panhandle. It lies 2 km 

from the Haines Highway, which links the deep-sea port of Haines, Alaska, USA with Haines Junction, 

Yukon, Canada on the Alaska Highway.  

The Project consists of a contiguous block of land consisting of 340 federal unpatented lode mining claims, 

which cover an area of approximately 6,765 acres (~2,738 hectares or 27 km2) and 63 state mineral claims 

that cover an area of approximately 9,200 acres (~3,680 hectares or 37 km2). These core claims are 

surrounded by land leased by the Company from the Alaska Mental Health Trust which total 65,772 acres, 

giving a Project total of 81,737 acres (~ 33,078 hectares or 330 km2). Constantine, through its wholly owned 

US subsidiary Constantine North Inc., has a 99-year Mineral Lease Agreement on the 340 federal 

unpatented lode mining claims with Alyu Mining, Inc. and Haines Mining-Exploration Inc. (collectively the 

"Owners"), both of Haines, Alaska. 

The host rock at Palmer is the same late Triassic volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) belt as the high-

grade producing Greens Creek Mine and the Windy Craggy copper deposit. 

Constantine signed an Option and Joint Venture Agreement (Agreement) with Dowa Metals & Mining Co., 

Ltd. of Japan (Dowa) on February 1st, 2013. Under the terms of the Agreement, Dowa had the option to 

earn a 49% interest in the Project by making aggregate expenditures of US$22,000,000 over a four-year 

period. On January 5th, 2017, the Company announced that Dowa had completed its US$22 million earn-

in to the Project and had exercised its option to participate as a partner in the Project. A Joint Venture was 

formed (the Dowa JV) for the purpose of further exploring and developing Project, with Constantine owning 

a 51% participating interest and Dowa owning a 49% participating interest.  

Total expenditures on the Project to the end of 2018 have been US$46.1 million (as of January 31st, 2019).

1.3 Geology and Mineralization 

The Project lies within a mafic-dominated, bimodal sequence of submarine volcanic rocks host to VMS 

mineralization. These rocks are part of a ~600 km-long, discontinuously exposed belt of Late Triassic, rift-

related volcanic and sedimentary rocks belonging to the Alexander Terrane. Throughout southeast Alaska 

and northwest British Columbia, the Alexander Terrane hosts numerous VMS occurrences, prospects and 

deposits, including the giant Windy Craggy Cu-Co-Au deposit in British Columbia, and the precious metals-

rich Ag-Zn-Pb-Au Greens Creek Mine in southeast Alaska (Taylor, 1997). The Project area itself is underlain 

by Paleozoic and lower Mesozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks that have been intruded locally 

by Cretaceous and Tertiary granitic plutons.  

The Project hosts two known VMS deposits, the Palmer deposit, which consists of the South Wall and RW 

Zones, and the newly discovered AG Zone deposit, located three km to the southwest (At the South Wall 

and RW Zones, six mineralization styles have been identified and are grouped according to dominant 

mineral assemblages and texture and include: Barite mineralization (Zn-rich), Massive Pyrite Mineralization 

(Cu-rich), Semi-massive and Stringer-style Mineralization, Massive Pyrrhotite Mineralization, Carbonate 

Mineralization and Barite-Carbonate Mineralization. At the AG Zone deposit, mineralization consists of 

Massive and Semi-massive sulfide and barite, and feeder-style stringers and replacement. Four alteration 

facies are associated with the known mineralized zones and include: Quartz-Pyrite, Muscovite, Carbonate-

Chlorite and Epidote.  

The South Wall Zones (SWZI, SWZII-III, SWEMZ) are located on the south-facing, steeply dipping limb of 

megascopic, deposit-scale anticline, disrupted by recognized thrust faulting, normal faulting and strike-slip 

faulting. The RW Zones (RW East, RW West, RW Oxide) are located on the north-facing, gently dipping 

upper limb of the same anticline. The RW Oxide Zone is the near surface equivalent of the RW East Zone 

where sulfide minerals of massive barite-sulfide mineralization have been oxidized and leached, depleting 

the zone of copper and zinc and enriching the silver and gold grades. The AG Zone deposit (including the 

AG Main Lens and AG Footwall Zone) is located three km m to the southwest, on a steep Nunatak between 

the Saksaia and South Saksaia Glaciers.  

Drilling to date has defined a total plunge length of near-continuous South Wall mineralization of 700 m, 

and a total strike length to 550 m, with exhalative mineralization occurring at more than one stratigraphic 

level. The RW Zones have been defined over a dip length of 325 m, and a total strike length of 800 m. The 

new AG Zone deposit has a strike length of 550 m and a vertical extent of 250 m. Reconstruction of the 

primary depositional environment of the Palmer Deposit (via unfolding and restoration of post-mineralization 

fault offset) yields a single continuous mineralized system that is over 1.5 km in length. The known zones 

are open to expansion in multiple directions, and most notably, the thickest mineralized intersection is 

located at the lower limit of the South Wall drilling done to date.  

Figure 1-1). Numerous other mineralized prospects are also present throughout the property and share 

similar alteration and mineralogical characteristics to the known zones, suggesting a large-scale, property-

wide Late Triassic mineralizing event.  

At the South Wall and RW Zones, six mineralization styles have been identified and are grouped according 

to dominant mineral assemblages and texture and include: Barite mineralization (Zn-rich), Massive Pyrite 

Mineralization (Cu-rich), Semi-massive and Stringer-style Mineralization, Massive Pyrrhotite Mineralization, 

Carbonate Mineralization and Barite-Carbonate Mineralization. At the AG Zone deposit, mineralization 

consists of Massive and Semi-massive sulfide and barite, and feeder-style stringers and replacement. Four

1.4 Metallurgical Testing and Mineral Processing 

Three test programs were completed by SGS Mineral Services (SGS) in 2013, 2018 and 2018 (AG Zone 

mineralogy).  

The most recent test program to evaluate the Palmer deposit was completed by SGS Canada Inc. in 2018. 

The program included mineralogy, comminution, and rougher/cleaner Cu, Zn, Py and Ba sequential

flotation. One composite, the High Ba composite, representing the Palmer Deposit was tested to confirm a 

preliminary recovery flowsheet and associated flotation conditions for Cu and Zn using the criteria from the 

SGS 2013 program. The tailings generated from the Cu/Zn flotation were used to develop the Ba flowsheet 

and flotation parameters. The optimized conditions from the program were applied to locked cycle tests for 

all three saleable concentrates. 

QEMSCAN analysis of the High Ba composite, representing the Palmer deposit and prepared at a grind 

size of 80% passing (P80) of 70 µm, shows that the sulfide material content is mainly barite, pyrite, sphalerite 

and chalcopyrite with the remaining material mostly gangue. Mineralogy indicates chalcopyrite and 

sphalerite liberation ranges from 79% to 90%. Barium is predominately associated with barite (99.1%) and 

95.4% liberated. A second sample representing the AG Zone deposit was analyzed using QEMSCAN by 

SGS. The results indicate the sample has similar mineral content and liberation to the Palmer deposit 

except for higher galena and very low chalcopyrite (0.01%) content. Copper in the AG Zone is mainly 

associated with tennantite-tetrahedrite. Liberation was similar for both samples. 

Comminution test work found that the A x b was 89.6, the bond ball mill work index (BWi) performed at a 

grind of 106 µm produced results of 6.3 kWh/t and 6.9 kWh/t and the abrasion index (Ai) was 0.119 g. The 

Palmer Deposit can be classified as soft to very soft and mildly abrasive. 

Based on the results from SGS (2018), saleable Cu, Zn and Ba concentrates can be produced at a primary 

grind size of 80% passing (P80) 72 µm, and rougher concentrate regrind sizes of P80 35 µm for Cu and 50 

µm for Zn. For the High Ba composite, locked cycle flotation test results achieved recoveries of 88.9% Cu, 

93.1% Zn and 91.1% Ba at concentrate grades of 24.5% Cu, 61.3% Zn and 52.4% Ba. The calculated head 

grades for the High Ba samples were 1.66% Cu, 10.3% Zn and 29.2% Ba. A summary of the SGS-14063-

002 locked cycle test (LCT) results is shown in Table 1-1.

Test work to provide flotation results have not been completed on the AG Zone. The results from the Palmer 

deposit and mineralogical analysis of the AG Zone deposit were used to predict the estimated Cu, Zn and 

Ba concentrate grades and recoveries for the economic model. 

1.5 History, Exploration and Drilling 

Base-metal sulfides and barite were first discovered in the Glacier Creek prospect area in 1969 by local 

prospector Merrill Palmer. Exploration work by historic operators from 1969-1999 at Palmer included a 

variety of property-wide geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys and diamond drilling. Total 

drilling by all historical operators was 7,545 m in 37 holes.

Constantine was formed out of Rubicon Minerals Corporation in 2006 with the primary purpose of exploring 

the Palmer Exploration Project. Constantine has completed a variety of exploration surveys and 

approximately 60,200 m of drilling in 156 holes to the end of 2018. This work has led to the discovery of 

massive sulfide deposits at the Palmer deposit (including the South Wall and RW Zones) in the Glacier 

Creek Prospect area, and the AG Zone deposit at the Nunatak Prospect Area. Total cumulative diamond 

drilling by the Company since 2006 is 60,200 m in 156 drill holes with total cumulative diamond drilling by 

all operators at 67,745 m in 193 completed holes. 

1.6 Mineral Resource Estimates 

1.6.1 Palmer Deposit Resource Estimate 

Following completion of the 2017 drilling campaign, an independent mineral resource estimate for the RW 

and SW Zones in the Palmer main area (Palmer deposit) was prepared by James N. Gray, P. Geo., of 

Advantage Geoservices Ltd. in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' NI 43-101 and 

conforms to the Canadian Institute of Mining "Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best 

Practices" guidelines. The resource incorporates all exploration drilling in the Palmer deposit area 

completed to the end of 2017. One hundred and eight exploration (108) diamond drill holes for 44,900 m 

and geological surface mapping were used to generate the geological and structural model for the South 

Wall and RW zones. Sixty (60) of the holes intersect the interpreted mineralized solids. Outlier assays were 

capped and all assays within the mineralized zones composited to 1.5-m lengths. Metal grades were 

estimated using inverse distance cubed interpolation into a 3D block model with block dimensions of 6 x 6 

x 6 m. Density was estimated by inverse distance squared interpolation, with unique density values 

determined by conventional analytical methods for virtually all assay samples. Three dimensional geologic 

solids were constructed by Darwin Green, Vice President of Exploration and reviewed by Ian Cunningham-

Dunlop, P.Eng., Vice President, Advanced Projects, and, in general, were limited to material grading > 0.5% 

Cu or > 2% Zn that could be demonstrated to be correlative with definable stratabound zones. As a general 

rule, solids were extended no more than 50 m up-dip, down-dip and along strike from a drill hole except 

where geology supports extension in the plunge direction of mineralization. A total of four solids were 

constructed for sulfide mineralization: South Wall Zone 1, South Wall Zone 2-3-EM, RW West, and RW 

East. 

Indicated Resources include only a portion of the upper part of the South Wall Zone, where drill density and 

confidence in the geological model are highest. Indicated Mineral Resource blocks meet the criteria of being 

a minimum 25-m distance away from the outer edge of the mineralized geological solid, estimated by a 

minimum of three holes, and have an average distance to three holes of less than or equal to 50 m; 

remaining estimated blocks are classified as Inferred Mineral Resource.  

The Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource for the RW and South Wall Zones is tabulated below in Table 

1-2 for a range of NSR (Net Smelter Return) cut-off values. Based on assumed underground mining and 

milling costs, the resource utilizes a base case cut-off of $75 per tonne. The resource has an effective date 

of September 27th, 2018 based on a data cut-off of May 1st, 2018.

Notes 

1. The cut-off date for drill data included in the resource is May 1st, 2018.  

2. Net Smelter Return (NSR) equals (US$16.01 x Zn% + US$48.67 x Cu% + US$23.45 x Au g/t + US$0.32 x Ag g/t). NSR 
formula is based on estimated metallurgical recoveries, assumed metal prices, and assumed offsite costs that include 
transportation of concentrate, smelter treatment charges, and refining charges.  

3. Assumed metal prices are US$1.15/lb for zinc (Zn), US$3.00/lb for copper (Cu), US$1250/oz for gold (Au), US$16/oz for 
silver (Ag).  

4. Estimated metal recoveries are 93.1% for zinc, 89.6% for copper, 90.9% for silver (70.8% to the Cu concentrate and 
20.1% to the Zn concentrate) and 69.6% for gold (49.5% to the Cu concentrate and 20.1% to the Zn concentrate) as 
determined from metallurgical locked cycle flotation tests completed in 2018.  

5. Barite is not included in the NSR value. 

6. Zinc equivalent (ZnEq%) and Copper equivalent (CuEq%) values calculated based on the NSR formula above plus an 
assumed net-value for barite as described below (e.g. CuEq = (total NSR value + BaSO4 net-value)/US$48.67. 

7. BaSO4 net-value equals US$0.566 x BaSO4% (e.g. a resource grade of 24% BaSO4 x $0.566 = US$13.6 per tonne or 
0.85% ZnEq). Formula based on barite recovery of 91.1% from metallurgical tests, assumed wholesale drilling-grade 
barite price in nearest North American markets of US$227/metric tonne, and assumed all-in transportation cost of 
US$150/tonne.  

8. Mineral resources as reported are undiluted. 

9. Mineral resource tonnages have been rounded to reflect the precision of the estimate.  

Source: Constantine (2019) 

Palmer Deposit mineral resource highlights include:  

 Indicated Resource of 4,677,000 tonnes grading 11.67% zinc equivalent (3.84% CuEq). This 

represents the first Indicated Resource for Palmer, and accounts for 47% of the total resource. 

 Inferred Resource of 5,338,000 tonnes grading 9.90% zinc equivalent (3.26% CuEq). This includes 

the addition of new areas of Inferred resource totaling 1.89 million tonnes, for a total tonnage 

increase of 23%*.  

 First resource to report barite mineralization for the Palmer deposit, highlighting the opportunity for 

barite to contribute value as an industrial mineral co-product. 

*Previous resource estimate of 8.125 million tonne Inferred grading 1.41% copper, 5.25% zinc, 

0.32 g/t gold and 31.7 g/t silver (Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop, 2015). 2015 resource estimate 

utilizes an NSR cut-off of US$75/t with assumed metal prices of US$1200/oz for gold, US$18/oz

for silver, US$2.75/lb for copper, and US$1.00/lb for zinc, and estimated metal recoveries 

determined from metallurgical locked cycle flotation tests. 

1.6.2 AG Zone Deposit Resource Estimate 

Following completion of the 2018 summer drilling campaign, an independent mineral resource estimate for 

the AG Zone deposit was prepared by James N. Gray, P. Geo., of Advantage Geoservices Ltd. in 

accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' NI 43-101 and conforms to the Canadian Institute of 

Mining "Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines. The AG Zone 

deposit mineral resource incorporates all exploration drilling in the AG Zone deposit area completed since 

initial discovery in 2017. Twenty-nine (29) exploration diamond drill holes for 10,766 metres and geological 

surface mapping were used to generate the geological and structural model for the AG Zone deposit. 

Twenty (20) holes intersected the interpreted mineralized solids. Outlier assays were capped and all assays 

within the mineralized zones were composited to 1.5-metre lengths. Metal grades were estimated using 

inverse distance cubed interpolation into a three-dimensional (3D) block model with block dimensions of 6 

x 6 x 6 metres, which is consistent with the main Palmer deposit. Density was estimated by inverse distance 

squared interpolation with unique density values determined by conventional analytical methods for all 

assay samples. Three dimensional geologic solids were constructed by Darwin Green, Vice President of 

Exploration, and reviewed by Ian Cunningham-Dunlop, P.Eng., Vice President, Advanced Projects, and, in 

general, were limited to material grading > 2% Zn or > 60 grams per tonne (g/t) Ag that could be correlated 

with definable stratabound zones. As a general rule, solids were extended no more than 50 metres up-dip, 

down-dip and along strike from a drill hole except where geology supported extension between holes in the 

trend of mineralization. Two (2) solids for sulfide mineralization were included in the Inferred Mineral 

Resource: the AG main lens, and the AG footwall zinc zone.  

The Inferred Mineral Resource for the AG Zone deposit is tabulated below in Table 1-3 for a range of % 

ZnEq cut-off values. Based on assumed underground mining and milling costs, the resource utilizes a base 

case cut-off of 5.0% ZnEq. The AG Zone deposit mineral resource has an effective date of December 18th, 

2018 based on a data cut-off of November 15th, 2018.

1.6.3 Total Palmer Project Mineral Resources 

The Palmer Project Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource includes the RW, South Wall and AG Zones 

as presented in Table 1-4. Copper equivalent grade is also included in the table due to the importance of 

copper in the SW Zone.

Total Palmer Project mineral resource highlights include:  

 Indicated Resource of 4,677,000 tonnes grading 10.21% zinc equivalent (3.92% copper 

equivalent).  

 Inferred Resource of 9,594,000 tonnes grading 8.87% zinc equivalent (3.4% copper equivalent). 

This includes the addition of new areas of Inferred Resource totaling 4.256 million tonnes, for a 

total tonnage increase of 80%*.  

 SW, RW and AG Zones confirm the multi-deposit district potential of the Palmer Project.  

 Opportunity to discover additional deposits and expand the two known key resource areas is 

considered excellent. 

*Previous Inferred mineral resource estimate of 5.338 million tonnes grading 0.96% copper, 5.20% 

zinc, 0.28 g/t gold and 29.2 g/t silver (Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop, 2018). The 2018 Inferred 

mineral resource estimate utilizes an NSR cut-off of US$75/t with assumed metal prices of 

US$1250/oz for gold, US$16/oz for silver, US$3.00/lb for copper, and US$1.15/lb for zinc, and 

estimated metal recoveries determined from metallurgical locked cycle flotation tests. 

1.7 Mining Methods 

The Palmer Project consists of two deposits, the Palmer and the AG Zone, and is proposed to be mined 

with transverse and longitudinal longhole (LH) stoping.

The mine will be accessed with an exploration drift, driven at 5 m wide (W) x 5 m high (H) from the 680 

Exploration Portal, which is located at 680 m above sea level (masl). This drift will act as a haulage route 

from the AG Zone deposit to the underground crusher located near the Palmer deposit. A second portal, 

the 510 Conveyor Drift will transport material from the underground crusher to the process plant. The 510 

Conveyor Drift is 6 m W x 5 m H and will act as secondary egress for the Palmer deposit. The third portal 

required is the 1000 portal and will act has the secondary egress for the AG Zone deposit. All accesses 

have been sized to accommodate the necessary ventilation ducting and services. 

Vertical development will include a raise to transport mineralized material and ventilation raises in both the 

Palmer and AG Zone deposits. 

Stope sub-levels are 5 m W x 5 m H and spaced at 20 m vertical increments. Transverse stopes will be 16 

m W x 24 m long (L), while longitudinal stopes will be 12 m W x 18 m L. This produces a typical hanging 

wall (HW) and footwall (FW) exposure of 16 m W x 20 m H and 18 m W x 20 m H for transverse and 

longitudinal stopes respectively. 

Stopes have been categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary stopes will be mined first and the 

void will be filled with cemented paste backfill before the adjacent secondary stope is mined. 

The mine plan is shown by resource classification in Table 1-5. This does not constitute a mining reserve, 

as the table contains inferred resources.

Diesel trackless equipment will be used throughout the mine. The total haulage fleet will consist of seven 

(7) 30 tonne (t) haul trucks, four (4) 10 t load haul dump machines (LHD), and one (1) 4.5 t LHD. The four 

10 t LHDs will have remote capability.  

The mine will require a full-time work force of mining, maintenance, services, technical and administrative 

personnel. Mine operations will run 365 d/a at 22 h/d through two – 11-hour shifts, allowing one hour for 

smoke clearing at each shift change.

Surface facilities will be located at the 680 Exploration Portal and/or at the mill site. Underground facilities 

will include a shop and booster pump stations for the paste backfill. 

Mine production is expected to commence in year 1 at approximately 2,700 tonnes per day (t/d), with full 

production in years 3 to 11 at an average rate of approximately 3,400 t/d. The mine will be in production for 

11 years, with production ending in Q2 of Year 11. A summary of annual mine production is presented in 

Figure 1-2.

1.8 Recovery Methods  

Material from the mine will feed a single-stage crushing plant located underground. The crushed product 

will be conveyed from underground to feed the process plant at a rate of 3,500 t/d producing saleable Cu, 

Zn and Ba concentrates. The process plant will operate 24 h/d, 365 days per year, with an estimated 

availability of 92%.  

The primary grinding circuit will consist of a semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill operating in open circuit 

followed by a ball mill operating in reverse closed circuit with cyclones to achieve a target grind size of 80% 

passing (P80) 72 µm. The material will then be fed to sequential Cu and Zn rougher / cleaner flotation 

circuits. The Cu and Zn regrind circuits will further liberate the rougher concentrates, with target P80 grind 

sizes of 35 µm and 50 µm, respectively. The tailings from the Zn rougher and first cleaner flotation will feed 

the pyrite (Py) rougher flotation followed by Ba rougher / cleaner flotation circuits. 

The Cu, and Zn flotation circuits will consist of rougher flotation followed by rougher concentrate regrind 

and three stages of cleaning. The Ba circuit will include rougher flotation and three stages of cleaning with

no regrind. The final concentrates will be thickened then filtered to the targeted moisture content of 8% for 

Cu and Zn and loaded into trucks as a bulk concentrate for transport to a local port and sent to smelters. 

Ba will be further dried to 1% moisture and bagged before being transported to Haines for barging to 

railhead at Prince Rupert, BC. The Py rougher concentrate will be filtered and mixed as paste for deposition 

underground. The tailings from the process will be dewatered and either filtered for stacking in the filtered 

tailings facility or mixed as part of the paste and pumped underground. 

1.9 Project Infrastructure 

The Project infrastructure is designed to support the operation of a 3,500 t/d mine and processing plant, 

operating on a 24 hour per day, seven day per week basis. The Project envisions the upgrading or 

construction of the following key infrastructure items: 

 Crushed mineralized rock bin, and mill feed conveyor 

 Process plant and re-agent storage warehouse 

 Liquid natural gas (LNG) fuel power generating plant and LNG storage facility 

 On-site power distribution with overhead power lines 

 Tailings filtering and paste backfill plant 

 Tailings management facility / waste rock storage facility (TMF/WRSF) 

 Temporary mine rock stockpile (TMRS) 

 Water treatment plant (WTP) 

 Administration and mine dry building 

 Warehouse 

 120,000 L of on-site fuel storage and distribution 

 Industrial waste management facilities such as the incinerator, and 

 Site water management facilities. 

1.9.1 Tailings and Waste Rock Management 

The majority (78%) of tailings will be utilized as underground backfill. The pyrite tailings separated by 

flotation and potentially acid generating (PAG) waste rock will be placed underground as components of 

backfill. 

A filtered tailings management facility / waste rock storage facility (TMF/WRSF) has been designed at a 

site approximately 6 km from the Conveyor Portal to store the remaining portion of tailings and non-

potentially acid generating (NPAG) waste rock not going underground. Tailings, and the portion of NPAG 

rock required for the construction of the TMF/WRSF, will be hauled and placed by truck. 

Due to desulfurization and removal of deleterious minerals by flotation, tailings stored on surface are NPAG. 

The TMF/WRSF is therefore not expected to require water treatment.

For CONSTANTINE METAL RESOURCES LTD. 

Page 1-30 

 

1.9.2 Water Management 

Drainage from the Exploration Portal constructed within NPAG rock is not expected to require water 

treatment and will be directed to a settling pond prior to discharge to a land application disposal (LAD) 

system. If treatment is required, flows can be directed to the mill site Water Treatment Pond (MWTP) by 

gravity pipeline and then to the Water Treatment Plant (WTP). Drainage from the Conveyor Portal and mill 

site will be conveyed to the MWTP and directed to the WTP for treatment. Treated water will be discharged 

to a LAD. 

Runoff from the lined TMF/WRSF will be collected and directed to a Contact Water Collection Pond (CWCP) 

and discharged to a LAD system if water quality is suitable or directed to treatment if required. 

1.9.3 Mill Foundations 

For initial estimation of potential costs for mill foundations, it was determined that the mill building may 

require a concrete raft foundation and compacted structural fill. Although a final design for mill foundation 

may also include piers and a locally thicker slab under heavy equipment and thinner sections in non-load 

bearing regions, for PEA costing an average thickness of concrete of 1 m is assumed with 100 kg of steel 

reinforcing per m3. 

1.10 Environment and Permitting 

The Company has carried out ongoing environmental baselines studies to support permitting, exploration 

and engineering activities. Such studies include hydrology, hydrogeology; acid rock drainage potential, 

vegetation and wildlife, cultural resources, environmental liabilities, and annual environmental monitoring.  

Constantine is currently exploring the Project under an approved Federal Mine Plan of Operations and 

Environmental Assessment (DOI BLM-AK-A020-2016-006-EA) granted on August 23rd, 2016, as amended 

under the Constantine Mine Plan 2017 Modification and Environmental Assessment on September 21st, 

2017 (DOI-BLM-AK-010-2017-025-EA). The Company also holds various permits and licenses from the 

State of Alaska including: Plan of Operations for Surface Exploration (Uplands Lease 9100759), Plan of 

Operations for Surface Construction (Uplands Lease 9100759), Multi-Year (2019-2023) Land Use Permit 

for Hardrock Exploration and Reclamation and three Temporary Water Use Authorizations for supplying 

water to drills. Constantine elected to utilize the Statewide Bond Pool and is currently bonded for 40.0 acres 

of disturbance.  

Constantine has conducted community relations activities since 2006. As part of their ongoing efforts, the 

Company conducts regular stakeholder meetings, maintains community outreach materials, hosts project 

site tours, attends and supports local programs and events, supports local hire and procurement, and 

participates in local community organizations. 

1.11 Capital and Operating Cost Estimates 

1.11.1 Capital Costs 

The initial, sustaining and closure capital costs with no escalation are shown in Table 1-6. All capital costs 

are in 2019 US Dollars and are considered Class 4 estimates (-20%/30%).

The capital cost estimate was compiled using a combination of quotations, database costs, and scaling 

factors.  

The capital cost estimate includes the costs required to develop, sustain and close the property for a 

planned 11 Year mine life. Initial capital costs are expensed over a 24-month pre-production construction 

and commissioning period. The sustaining capital is carried over operating Years 1 through 11, and closure 

costs are incurred in Year 12. 

1.11.2 Operating Costs 

The operating cost estimates are based on a combination of experiential judgment, reference to similar 

operating projects, budgetary quotes and factors as appropriate with a PEA study.  

Preparation of the OPEX is based on the JDS philosophy that emphasizes accuracy over contingency and 

utilizes defined and proven Project execution strategies. 

The LOM costs are summarized in Table 1-7.

In addition to the OPEX, the sustaining cost averages $11.23/tonne over the LOM. The total operating 

cost-plus sustaining cost totals $65.40/tonne over the LOM. 

1.12 Economic Analysis 

An economic model was developed to estimate annual cash flows and sensitivities of the project. Pre-tax 

estimates of project values were prepared for comparative purposes, while after-tax estimates were 

developed and to approximate the true investment value. It must be noted, however, that tax estimates 

involve many complex variables that can only be accurately calculated during operations and, as such, the 

after-tax results are only approximations. 

This PEA is preliminary in nature, it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 

speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 

them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and, as such, there is no certainty that the PEA results 

will be realized. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated 

economic viability. 

1.12.1 Main Assumptions 

Metal prices were selected based on the average of three years past and projected two years forward by 

analysis of London Metal Exchange futures as of April 15th, 2019. These have been compared to the spot 

prices at the close of London Metal Exchange on April 15th, 2019. The Barite price used in this PEA study 

was selected based on an average price of competitive current wholesale prices of Barite Concentrate. 

Table 1-8 outlines the metal prices and exchange rate used in the economic analysis. 

Table 1-8: Metal Price and Exchange Rates Used in Economic Analysis

Copper Price US$/lb 2.82 2.93 

Zinc Price US$/lb 1.22 1.36 

Silver Price US$/oz 16.26 15.00

Barite Price US$/tonne 220 220 

Exchange Rate US$:C$ 0.75 0.75 

Source: JDS (2019) 

No market studies have been completed for the project at this time. Except for barite, all commodities 

considered in this Study are regularly sold commercially on vast international markets. The terms selected 

are in-line with current market conditions. 

This PEA has assumed that all zinc and copper concentrates are transported and smelted in Asia. CMR 

has an agreement with Dowa that includes the right of first refusal on the zinc concentrate. 

The barite concentrate will be dried and bagged on site and trucked to Haines, where they will be loaded 

onto a barge to Prince Rupert. It will then be distributed to markets across North America and Canada via 

rail.

1.12.3 Sensitivities 

A univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to examine which factors most affect the project economics 

when acting independently of all other cost and revenue factors. Each variable evaluated was tested using 

the same percentage range of variation, from -20% to +20%, although some variables may actually 

experience significantly larger or smaller percentage fluctuations over the LOM.

The analysis revealed that the project is most sensitive to overall metal prices, followed by zinc metal price 

specifically, operating costs, head grade and capital costs. Of those elements tested, the Project showed 

the least sensitivity to copper metal price. 

1.13 Interpretation and Conclusions 

1.13.1 Risks 

There are several risks associated with the Project that should be considered. Some are generic and shared 

by nearly all mining projects, including: 

 Sensitivity to metal pricing (as discussed in Section 22.6 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 1-38 

 

 Cost escalation 

 Permitting difficulties, costs, and delays, and 

 Efficiency of construction management: a project can be properly estimated and improperly 

constructed, resulting in significant construction cost overruns. 

There are also several site-specific risks that are identified and discussed in detail in the following sections. 

It should be noted that the project is not sensitive to any exchange rates, as all revenues and nearly all 

capital and operating cost items were sourced in $US rather than converted from other currencies. 

 Avalanche 

Glacier Creek valley is subject to snow avalanches between October and June with the most active periods 

between November and April, owing to high snowfall and steep terrain. Constantine has been studying the 

local avalanche cycles since 2010 in order to understand and mitigate avalanche risk. The results of that 

monitoring program suggest that the access road to the 680 Exploration Portal site is subject to periodic 

avalanches that could restrict access both during periods of high avalanche danger and during snow 

clearing operations after avalanches. The monitoring program has also informed design and placement of 

proposed mine infrastructure.  

The mill site, backfill plant and LNG power plant have been located in areas mapped as low hazard zones. 

Metal shed coverings were assumed for both the 680 Exploration Portal and the 510 Conveyor Portal for 

the protection of workers and equipment. Secondary egress and/or ventilation adits for both mines were 

located in low risk rock outcrop areas. 300 Kt of NPAG rock in the development schedule was assumed to 

be used for construction activities during the pre-production period, including the construction of avalanche 

deflection berms as required. 

An Operational Avalanche Safety Plan will be required during winter operation, which will include site-

specific weather and avalanche forecasting, road closures and artificial triggering and cleanup. No 

operational downtime or special equipment other than the usual snow removal fleet was included for 

avalanche control measures, as the mines can be accessed from separate portals. It is assumed that mine 

entry via the 510 Conveyor Portal will be possible during periods of time when the road to the 680 

Exploration Portal is blocked from the clean-up activities after intentionally triggered avalanches. 

 510 Conveyor Portal Construction 

The 510 Conveyor Portal is determined by the location of the processing plant and the centroid of the 

orebody. The talus slope it is collared into is less than ideal for the construction of a mine adit and could 

prove to be more costly and time-consuming than currently considered in the PEA. This was mitigated by 

using a ground penetrating radar analysis, supported by one visual outcrop, to locate the portal in the 

minimum depth of talus based on existing information. 

 AG Metallurgical Response 

The test work completed on the AG Zone deposit is limited to mineralogy. Recoveries for the deposit were 

based on a comparison of the AG Zone deposit mineralogy to the Palmer deposit and existing flotation test 

work performed on Palmer deposit mineralization. The copper and zinc recoveries were discounted for the 

AG Zone deposit because the copper is lower grade and present as tennantite rather than chalcopyrite.

Page 1-39 

 

The actual recovery of copper in the AG Zone deposit will only be confirmed through testwork. This impacts 

the recovery of copper, but also the loss of zinc to the copper concentrate. This risk is further complicated 

by the high lead grade in the AG Zone deposit, as compared to the Palmer deposit, which may require a 

combined lead-copper flotation or separate lead flotation circuit. 

 Site Surface Geotechnical Conditions  

No site-specific subsurface information is currently available in the vicinity of the mill site or TMF/WRSF 

except for a single line of geophysical surveying near the mill site.  

Characterization of foundations is a key step during design to identify potential critical conditions. In the 

PEA design, foundation conditions are largely assumed based on surface observations. Key design 

considerations for foundation characterization include: 

 Potential presence of weak layers that could govern stability of the TMF/WRSF, pond 

embankments and other structures on site 

 Potential presence of soft or weak layers that could result in differential or excess settlement of 

building foundations 

 Potential for foundation strength loss or liquefaction (static or dynamic) which could govern stability 

of all structures, and 

 Hydrogeologic conditions, particularly beneath the TMF/WRSF pile and collection ponds (i.e. 

influencing uplift of liner during construction).  

The processing plant is located on deep till. Rafting foundations have been assumed for the larger 

equipment and adequate allowances have been included in the design and costs estimate to allow for this 

requirement.  

 Water Management 

The risks associated with water management on site are as follows: 

 Basic assumptions were made for surface and underground water flows based on preliminary 

drilling and hydro-geologic information.  

 Flows from the AG Zone workings are not yet defined and have not been addressed in the water 

balance. The impact of AG Zone inflows on water management facility design and water treatment 

requirements are not known.  

 Little information is available on the hydraulic conductivity of deeper sections of the ore deposits. 

Consequently, estimates of potential inflows are restricted to approximate assessments of recharge 

based sustained average flows and little information is available on peak flow rates. 

 The underground water collection and treatment strategy includes identification of water requiring 

treatment and separation from water that does not. Inability to differentiate would increase the 

amount of water requiring treatment and associated cost.  

 Geochemical test work to date indicates runoff from tailings will be relatively benign and operational 

controls will be in place for geochemical monitoring and management to confirm this. Therefore, 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 

Prepared by JDS ENERGY & MINING INC. 

For CONSTANTINE METAL RESOURCES LTD. 

Page 1-40 

 

the PEA design includes discharge of contact water collected at the CWCP after settlement to the 

TMF/WRSF LAD without additional treatment either during operations or upon closure. Additional 

tailings and waste rock characterization and more detailed operational planning will be required in 

future design stages to confirm indications of initial test work. Future results may indicate that water 

treatment at the TMF/WRSF may be necessary. 

 Seismicity 

Stability analysis indicates that under maximum design earthquake (MDE) loadings, seismic displacements 

of the TMF/WRSF are possible. Deformations could impact pile integrity, pile infrastructure (roads, 

pipelines, etc.) and liner and drainage systems. Other site structures may also be impacted by seismic 

loading. 

 Geochemical Management (Waste Materials) 

Geochemical testing to date on tailings is limited to initial pilot plant samples, and geochemical 

characterization of all waste rock has not yet been carried out. The limited testing represents uncertainty 

related to geochemical management. However, preliminary results from tailings testing indicate that the mill 

circuit is successful at removing the majority of sulfides from the tailings and the material is relatively benign. 

Pyrite tailings will be stored underground. A portion of PAG waste rock will be temporarily stored at the mill 

site before being placed underground later in operations.  

 TMF/WRSF Dust Management 

Wind-blown tailings could impact and exceed air quality standards if areas of the TMF/WRSF pile are left 

unmitigated. Although the TMF/WRSF design includes progressive reclamation and waste rock armoring 

of pile slopes, filtered tailings can be susceptible to dusting if left exposed. Temporary dust management 

alternatives prior to placement of a reclamation cover include: synthetic dust suppressants, wind fences 

and temporary sand and gravel erosion protection layers. 

 TMF/WRSF Post-Closure 

Long-term closure goals for the TMF/WRSF include providing a stable pile and limiting long-term risk to 

the downstream environment (safety, water and air quality). The PEA design addresses these goals by 

eliminating ponded water on the TMF/WRSF pile surfaces, routing water around the pile and 

progressively covering the pile with a low-permeability cover to limit water and oxygen ingress. Pile drain 

down water will be greatly reduced upon closure due to the completion of the low-permeability cover. 

Long-term risks to water quality are not fully defined by short-term geochemical testing and the need for 

additional long-term measures is uncertain. Differential settlement of tailings has the potential to modify 

drainage paths resulting in formation of localized ponds. 

1.13.2 Opportunities 

The Project has several opportunities to improve the current results that should be investigated further as 

part of the ongoing development of the Project.

 Expansion and Definition of Resources 

The simplest and most obvious opportunity is to continue to explore the property to expand and better 

define the resources. The current level of drilling is sufficient to define a resource but has certainly not 

closed off either deposit and there is ample opportunity to either or both. An expansion of mineral resources 

would allow the mine plan to contemplate either a higher mining rate, longer mine life, or some combination 

of both. Increased resource definition through tighter drill spacing would allow the resource to form the basis 

of a reserve for a PFS or FS. 

 Sale of Pyrite 

The current study treats pyrite as a waste product that must be returned underground as paste backfill 

because of its acid-generating potential. Pyrite is a saleable commodity, however, as it is used to generate 

sulfuric acid. As the pyrite is already ground, floated, and filtered there would be no incremental processing 

costs associated with making the product saleable. If a contract could be arranged with an adequate margin 

to ship the product to a smelter, this could be a significant opportunity.  

There will be 3.0 Mt of pyritic tails generated over the LOM. This total exceeds the quantity of material 

(NPAG rock and de-sulfide tails) sent to the TSF. As such, it is possible that pyrite sales could result in the 

elimination of a TSF for surface waste storage. As such, it may even be beneficial to the Project to sell the 

pyrite at a loss. 

 AG Zone Deposit Metallurgy 

While the limited testwork for the AG Zone deposit has been identified as a risk in Section 25.1.3, it must 

also be considered an opportunity. AG Zone deposit recoveries were estimated by applying a 10% 

deduction recovery to the copper (from 89% to 79%) and a 5% to the zinc from the AG zone deposit (from 

93% to 88%). Should testwork prove these deductions to be conservative, the economics of the AG Zone 

deposit will improve. Similarly, the increased presence of lead may impose a complication on the copper 

recovery, but it may also provide an additional revenue stream from the sale of a lead concentrate or a 

combined copper-lead concentrate. 

 Good Used Equipment 

The purchase and employment of good used equipment is always a consideration to be made to reduce 

capital costs. In general, this should not be considered for the mobile mining, as the savings do not warrant 

the reduction of availability, making production targets hard to achieve. However, much of the major 

equipment list for the processing plant, backfill plant, the surface fleet, and power generation and 

distribution could be comprised of used units should suitable unit be available at the time of procurement. 

Realistic assumptions and expectations should be applied to the purchase of used equipment, as there are 

usually significant costs for rebuilding, retrofitting, or modernizing componentry.  

 Conveyor for AG Zone Deposit 

Haulage costs for the AG Zone deposit are significant due to the long haulage distance. A trade-off study 

should be performed to determine if a second conveyor should be installed to replace the truck haulage. 

This would require that a second crusher installation be installed for the AG Zone deposit to size rock for 

the conveyor.

 Dust 

Wind-blown tailings could impact and exceed air quality standards if areas of the TMF/WRSF pile are left 

unmitigated. Although the Project design includes progressive reclamation and waste rock armoring of pile 

slopes, filtered tailings can be susceptible to dusting if left exposed. Temporary dust management 

alternatives prior to placement of a reclamation cover include synthetic dust suppressants, wind fences and 

temporary sand and gravel erosion protection layers. Pile staging during operations should be optimized to 

advance waste rock and progressive reclamation as early as possible and minimize areas with exposed 

tailings. 

 Post Closure 

Long-term closure goals for the TMF/WRSF include providing a stable pile and limiting long-term risk to the 

downstream environment (safety, water and air quality). The PEA design addresses these goals by 

eliminating ponded water on the TMF/WRSF pile surfaces, routing water around the pile and progressively 

covering the pile with a low-permeability cover to limit water and oxygen ingress. Pile drain down water will 

be greatly reduced upon closure due to the completion of the low-permeability cover. Long-term risks to 

water quality are not fully defined by short-term geochemical testing and the need for additional long-term 

measures is uncertain. Differential settlement of tailings has the potential to modify drainage paths resulting 

in formation of localized ponds. 

Resiliency must be included in closure design and construction to accommodate tailings consolidation 

(cover design and material specifications). Additional geochemical characterization of tailings is required to 

confirm that long term water quality criteria will be met for discharge to the environment. 

1.14 Recommendations 

1.14.1 General 

The primary finding of this PEA is that the Project has the potential to be economic based on the data 

acquired to-date and the mine model that was produced for this evaluation. Accordingly, it is recommended 

that exploration continue on the Project and that the Company continue to advance its permits and baseline 

environmental data collection with the ultimate goal of constructing the mine and putting it into production. 

To this end, the Authors believe continued delineation drilling is warranted and has the potential to expand 

the known resource and increase its confidence. Once this is done, it would be worthwhile to replace this 

PEA with a pre-feasibility study (PFS) or feasibility study (FS) that includes a mining reserve based on a 

mine model applied to the expanded resource. 

Given the mountainous terrain, this drilling can only be effectively achieved from underground development. 

There is also significant potential to discover additional mineralized zones within the greater Palmer Project. 

Accordingly, the planned exploration adit, drift, and underground drill program is recommended. 

1.14.2 Recommended Work Plan – Exploration Program 

The following activities are recommended as part of the next exploration program, currently anticipated for 

summer 2019: 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

For CONSTANTINE METAL RESOURCES LTD. 

Page 1-43 

 

 Review the option of a lateral underground exploration adit to provide access to the mineral 

resource area for delineation drilling, hydrological and geotechnical studies, and metallurgical 

testing. This may be more cost effective for drilling on close-spaced centers for conversion from 

Inferred to Indicated mineral resource categories than drilling from surface and would also facilitate 

year-round drilling, which is currently impractical during the winter months.  

 Geotechnical, hydrogeological, engineering, environmental, avalanche risk studies and permitting 

work to aid in the assessment of a conceptual underground exploration development. 

 Prepare and submit a Plan of Operations permit application in support of the conceptual 

underground exploration program.  

 10,0000 m of resource-scale definition and exploration drilling on 100 m and 50 m nominally spaced 

centers to test the limits of the known mineralized zones. Priority drill areas would include the on-

strike and down-dip extensions of the collective South Wall and RW Zones¸ with emphasis on the 

potential 200 m down-dropped faulted offset of the Zone II-III-EM.  

 Drill test existing regional exploration targets.  

 Development of new regional exploration targets within the Federal and State mining claims, and 

within the greater Mental Health Trust Lands that are under lease. 

1.14.3 Recommended Work Plan – Pre-feasibility or Feasibility Study 

The logical next step for the project is to produce a pre-feasibility study (PFS) or Feasibility Study (FS). This 

effort would require the following field programs and engineering evaluations: 

 Complete geotechnical characterization program for the PEA underground mine and infrastructure 

including geotechnical core drilling and oriented core and/or televiewer; 

 Investigation of the talus slope to finalize the location of the 510 Conveyor Portal. 

 Ongoing metallurgical testwork to confirm the flotation characteristics of the AG Zone deposit 

through lock-cycle test. 

 Ongoing metallurgical testwork on blended samples of Palmer deposit and AG Zone deposit 

mineralization, matching the production forecast to simulate the predicted scheduled mill feed. 

 A new avalanche hazard analysis should be performed now that site facilities have been generally 

located to identify specific concerns and countermeasures that should be applied to the next level 

of study. This would include design and location of avalanche deflection berms to protect the site 

roads, industrial complex, water treatment ponds and the two portals. 

 The 510 Portal location should be finalized, and a detailed engineering design should be completed 

for a snow cover shed and avalanche deflection structure(s). 

 Hydrogeological studies of AG Zone to assess flow rates and treatment requirements will be 

required. Potential measures to reduce inflows during operation such as construction of bulkheads 

between operational and depleted zones should be investigated. 

 Continue to advance understanding of geochemistry and waste management strategies. Include 

TMF/WRSF water treatment as a contingency in project costing estimates if required. Continued

collection and analysis of data relating to underground, and surface water needs to be continued 

on-site over the near-term to enhance the local hydrological knowledge. 

 It is recommended that a site investigation program to characterize the foundations and potential 

borrow materials be conducted. A detailed site investigation plan has not been prepared as part of 

the PEA, but would likely include the following: 

o Drilling to perform penetration tests (correlated to soil density), visually describe the soils, 

collect samples for laboratory testing, measure in-situ hydrogeologic properties of the soils 

and install geotechnical instrumentation (inclinometers and vibrating wire piezometers) or 

groundwater monitoring wells. Shear wave velocity measurements could be collected in 

standpipe piezometers to inform SSHA and liquefaction triggering assessments. 

o Cone penetration testing (CPT) to provide continuous soil classification that can be used 

in part of liquefaction triggering assessments. Shear wave velocities may also be 

measured. 

o Geophysics to infill data between drill holes and CPT soundings.  

o Test pits to characterize borrow sources.  

 Mitigation measures for foundation improvement could be developed (weight drop or other 

foundation densification, stone columns, etc.), or if impractical, re-siting of the mill site, TMF/WRSF, 

CWCP and other structures could be required as a result of the investigation findings. 

 Site-specific seismic hazard assessment (SSHA) to characterize seismic hazard to assess if MDE 

adopted is appropriate. Perform deformation analysis to quantify the magnitude of seismic 

deformations. If required, revise designs to reduce deformation to acceptable levels. Conduct a 

site-specific seismic hazard assessment to establish seismic loadings for structures and site 

facilities. Perform stability assessments to confirm designs comply with design criteria for static and 

seismic stability.  

 Develop temporary storage contingencies outside of the TMF/WRSF for periods when pyrite 

tailings cannot be placed immediately underground. Options could include use of the lined 

temporary PAG rock / ore stockpile adjacent to the mill, a storage shed or a separate, contained 

area or section of the TMF/WRSF. 

 Install instruments to establish baseline water quality and hydrogeological conditions. 

 Optimize site-wide water balance to evaluate interactions between surface water storages and how 

the water management system will perform under prolonged dry or wet conditions, flood events, at 

different stages of the mine life, and following an operational upset of the WTP.  

 Conduct additional testing on tailings and waste rock to define geotechnical properties. The next 

design stages for the TMF/WRSF should also anticipate settling and provide long term positive 

drainage to prevent ponding. 

 Conduct additional testing on tailings and waste rock to further define geochemical properties. 

Assess tailings effluent quality to inform water management designs and water treatment needs. 

 Conduct wind tunnel trials to assess dusting potential and appropriate mitigation strategies for the 

filtered tailings.

 Complete a constructability review, including material requirements and preparation of an 

execution plan, for the TMF/WRSF design to define risks to cost, schedule and identify areas for 

potential optimization. 

 Undertake an operations review of the TMF/WRSF to assess whether adequate flexibility and 

management of risk have been incorporated into the design. 

 Review the effect of tailings consolidation and differential settlement between structural and non-

structural zones on closure cover design,  

 Undertake a Failure, Modes, and Effects Analysis (FMEA) of the TMF/WRSF and other project 

components specific to technical assessments of risks, consequence, design resilience and 

potential operational failure modes. Results of the FMEA can be used (1) to provide guidance for 

instrumentation monitoring during operations; (2) to establish a surveillance program; and (3) to 

screen out failure modes that can be effectively managed by the Observational Method during 

operations. 

The following trade-off evaluations should be performed as part of the next phase of work on this Project: 

 The construction of a loading terminal in Haines to replace the Skagway facility. 

 The optimal end-product form and packaging of the barite to maximize the sales margins. 

 The best processing option for the AG Zone deposit should be evaluated, including preparation of 

a lead concentrate, suppression of the lead in the floatation circuits to maintain the value of the 

copper concentrate, or the generation of a cooper-lead concentrate. 

 The economic viability of selling pyrite for the production of sulfuric acid off-site instead of returning 

it to the mine as backfill. Environmental baseline studies to include water quality sampling, species 

of interest studies, environmental rock geochemistry studies, and meteorological data collection.  

 Continued ABA testwork to chemically characterize the TSF. 

 Ongoing engagement with community, local stakeholders and governments with continued local 

hiring practices.

4.3 Property Interests, Royalties, and Other Legal Obligations 

Constantine Metal Resources Ltd., incorporated March 3rd, 2006, was created for acquiring a 100% interest 

in the Palmer Project held by Toquima North Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Toquima Minerals 

Corporation (Toquima). Constantine acquired Toquima's interest by means of a Plan of Arrangement and 

assignment of its interest in Toquima North Inc., now Constantine North Inc. 

Constantine, through its wholly owned US subsidiary Constantine North Inc. (formerly Toquima North Inc.), 

has a 99-year Mineral Lease Agreement on the 340 federal unpatented lode mining claims. The Mineral 

Lease, dated effective December 19th, 1997 and originally signed by Rubicon Minerals Corporation, is with 

Alyu Mining, Inc. and Haines Mining-Exploration Inc. (collectively the "Owners") both of Haines, Alaska. 

The material terms of the Mineral Lease are as follows in Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2. 

4.3.1 Advance Royalty Payments to the Owners 

Constantine North Inc. is to make annual aggregate advance royalty cash payments to the Owners of 

$42,500. The initial advance royalty payments are to be paid in quarterly tranches of $10,625 each, 

commencing on November 10th, 1997 and continuing up to and including the 98th anniversary of the Mineral 

Lease. The advance royalty payments are fully paid to date. To maintain the Mineral Lease, Constantine 

North Inc. is also required to make annual maintenance fee payments to the Bureau of Land Management 

("BLM"). Maintenance fee payments are currently $155/claim*, totaling $52,700 per year.

4.3.2 Net Smelter Return Royalty 

The Owners will each be entitled to half of a 2.5% net smelter return royalty on the Palmer Project. The 

advance royalty cash payments shall be recouped from the net smelter return royalty payable in that year 

or in subsequent years; however, in no year shall the amount of the aggregate of the net smelter return 

royalty and the advance royalty cash payment be less than US$ 42,500. The obligation to pay annual 

advance royalty cash payments shall be extinguished once the Owners have received a total of US$ 

4,500,000 in advance royalty cash payments. Constantine North Inc. has a right of first refusal to purchase 

the net smelter return royalty, or any portion thereof, at any time during the term of the mineral lease. 

4.3.3 Option Agreement with Dowa Mining & Metals Co., Ltd. 

Constantine signed an Option and Joint Venture Agreement (the "Agreement") with Dowa Metals & Mining 

Co., Ltd. of Japan (Dowa) on the Project on February 1st, 2013. 

Under the terms of the Agreement, Dowa had the option to earn a 49% interest in the Project by making 

aggregate expenditures of US$ 22 M over a four-year period. Included in the aggregate expenditure were 

cash payments to Constantine totaling US$ 1,250,000 over four years. The Agreement also included terms 

allowing Dowa to acquire 100% of the zinc off-take rights at arms-length commercial terms 

On January 5th, 2017, the Company announced that Dowa had completed its US$ 22 million earn-in to the 

Project and had exercised its option to participate as a partner in the Project. A Joint Venture has now been 

formed (the Dowa JV) for the purpose of further exploring and developing the Project, with Constantine 

owning a 51% participating interest and Dowa owning a 49% participating interest.  

Approximately US$ 2 M in unspent earn-in funds were used to form the starting cash balance of the Joint 

Venture.  

4.3.4 Other Underlying Agreements or Obligations 

There are no other underlying agreements or obligations encumbering the Project. As the claims are 

unpatented, no local or county-based property taxes have been assessed against them. 

The federal claims are located on federal lands that are managed (both surface and mineral estates) by the 

United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management ("BLM"). The State claims are 

located on Alaska State lands that are managed by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. Both 

state and federal claims are in good standing as of the date of this report. 

4.4 Alaska Mental Health Trust Land 

During Alaska's transition to a state, the US Congress passed the Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 

1956 (http://mhtrust.org/about/history/). This act transferred the responsibility for providing mental health 

services from the federal government to the territory of Alaska and ultimately the state, by creating the 

Alaska Mental Health Trust ("(AMHT or MHT). To fund it, the state selected one million prime acres of land 

that would be managed to generate income to help pay for a comprehensive and integrated mental health 

program in Alaska. 

Though the Alaska Legislature held a fiduciary responsibility to manage the land on behalf of Alaskans with 

mental disabilities, it did not do so. Instead, by 1982, only about 35 percent of the trust land remained in 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

For CONSTANTINE METAL RESOURCES LTD. 

Page 4-9 

 

state ownership. Most of the land had been transferred to individuals or municipalities, or designated as 

forests, parks or wildlife areas. 

In 1982, Vern Weiss filed a lawsuit on behalf of his son, who required mental health services that were not 

available in Alaska. Other beneficiary groups joined Weiss v State of Alaska in a class action suit. The case 

was ruled on in 1984 by the state Supreme Court, which ordered that the original trust be restored. Ten 

years later in 1992, a final settlement reconstructed the Trust with 500,000 acres of original Trust land and 

500,000 acres of replacement land, plus $200 million in cash. As part of the settlement, the Trust's cash 

assets are managed under a contract with the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, and the land and non-

cash assets are managed under a contract with the Trust Land Office within the Department of Natural 

Resources. The settlement also established an independent board of trustees, which is appointed by the 

governor and confirmed by the Legislature. 

The AMHT lands in the region surrounding the Project were selected based on their mineral resource 

potential. The AMHT selection also includes area that overlaps the Project federal claims. Under the terms 

of the grant, mineral title of any lapsed federal claim would automatically revert to AMHT. 

In 2014, Constantine was the successful applicant in a competitive lease process for the 'Haines Block' 

(MH Parcels C81209, C81210 and C70451) offered by the AMHT (Figure 4-3). The Trust owns the 

subsurface mineral estate of the Haines Block, and for a small subset of the block, located adjacent to the 

Palmer Project, land is held fee simple for which the Trust owns both the surface and subsurface estate. 

The Upland Mining Lease MHT No. 9100759 was finalized and signed with an effective date of September 

1st, 2014, thereby consolidating a district-scale property position totaling approximately 108,000 acres (circa 

2014), inclusive of the Palmer state and federal claims (Figure 4-3). Acquisition of the Haines Block lands 

provides protection of existing interests, unfettered access for ongoing exploration and future development, 

and strategic control of the entire tract of land with known volcanogenic massive sulfide potential.  

The Haines Block occurs within the Area of Interest of the Palmer Project Option and Joint Venture 

Agreement with Dowa.  

4.4.1 MHT Location Overview  

The Mental Health Trust lands (the Trust) are located on the flanks of the Chilkat Mountains in the Juneau 

Mining District, 30 miles northwest of Haines, Alaska, USA comprising approximately 99,257 acres in three 

parcels, of which 65,772 acres in two parcels are currently under lease to the Company for mineral 

exploration and development. This land package is referred to as the "Haines Block" (Figure 4-3).  

A small portion of the Haines Block, near the Palmer Project, is held fee simple with the Trust owning both 

the surface estate and subsurface mineral estate (dark purple). For most of the acreage, the Trust owns 

the mineral estate and the State of Alaska owns and manages the surface. Near the Palmer Project, the 

Haines Block is subject to mining claims controlled by Constantine North Inc.  

The Haines Block is situated in the Porcupine mining district which has recorded intermittent production of 

approximately 82,489 ounces of placer gold but no lode gold.

4.4.2 Description of the MHT Leased Lands ("Haines Block") 

The subject parcels are in the Copper Skagway C-3, C-4, B-3, and B-4 quadrangle, Alaska, USA and 

originally included parcels C81210, C70451 and C81209 (now dropped) totaling 99,257 acres (now 65,772 

acres). Portions of parcel C81210, specifically the East ½ Section 11, West ½ Section 12, West ½ Section 

13, and East ½ Section 14, T 29 S, R. 54 E, CRM are subject to a placer mining lease with Blue Ribbon 

Gold, Inc. Four federal mining claims on Cahoon Creek constitute a federal in-holding in this area. Near the 

Palmer Project, the Trust's mineral estate is subject to the federal mining claims owned by Alyu Mining Inc.

and Haines Mining-Exploration, Inc., which are under lease to Constantine North Inc. These federal mining 

claims and the lands they encumber are managed by the BLM. 

4.4.3 Terms of MHT Lease Agreement ("TLO Lease") 

The Upland Mining Lease MHT. No.9100759 between the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority acting by 

and through the State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, Mental Health Trust Land Office 

{collectively the "TLO") and Constantine North, Inc. (Lessee) was made effective September 1st, 2014 {the 

TLO Lease). 

A general summary of the TLO Lease terms includes annual rental of US$25,000 per year for the initial 3-

year TLO Lease term, US$40,000 for years 4 to 6, US$55,000 for years 7 through 9, with work commitments 

of US$75,000 per year, escalating US$50,000 annually. There is a mandatory acreage reduction of 25,000 

acres at the end of the first and second 3-year TLO Lease terms. The TLO Lease can be extended beyond 

year 9 by making annual rental payments and continuing to diligently pursue exploration and development 

on the TLO Lease. Annual rental payments are replaced by royalty payments upon achieving commercial 

production. Production royalty's payable to the TLO include a sliding scale 1% to 4.5% royalty for gold 

based on gold price, and a 3.5% royalty on minerals other than gold. The TLO Lease in its entirety is 

provided as a reference and forms part of the Selection Agreement. 

4.4.4 Description of the MHT Leased Lands added to the Dowa JV ("Selection Area") 

In a letter dated October 16th, 2014, the Company advised Dowa that they were a successful applicant in 

a competitive lease offered by TLO and that they had signed a lease (the TLO Lease). On January 19th, 

2015, Dowa advised the Company that Dowa had selected a portion of the TLO Lease area (Selection 

Area) to be included as part of the Project for which expenditures will apply to Dowa's 49% Earn-in 

Expenditures during the Option phase of the Agreement. The Selection Area that was requested by Dowa 

and accepted by the Company constitutes part of the Project as represented in the TLO Lease by parcel 

C70451 with surface and mineral estate (to the extent owned by the State of Alaska, Department of Natural 

Resources, Mental Health Trust Land Office (TLO) and comprising approximately 3,483 acres that lies 

within T.028S., R.053E. Sections 33, 34 and 35, T.029S., R.053E. Section 1 and T.029S., R.054E. Section 

6 (Figure 4-4). 

Upon the formation of the Dowa JV, the Company assigned the Selection Area to the Joint Venture, such 

that the interest that Dowa had earned pursuant to the Agreement would include a 49% interest in the 

Selection Area, subject to the approval of the TLO at the time, as provided for in Section 15 of the TLO 

Lease. 

4.4.5 Terms of Amended MHT Lease Agreement  

The Upland Mining Lease MHT No. 9100759 was amended on September 1st, 2017 when the Company 

notified TLO of their intent to drop MHT Parcel C81209 on the north side of the Klehini River, and reduced 

the TLO Lease from three parcels to two (Figure 4-4) including:  

1) C70451 surface and mineral estate comprising approximately 3,483 acres and  

2) C81210 mineral estate comprising approximately 62,289 acres.

In addition to rental payments, annual labour of $400/quarter section ($25,200 total) is due November 30th 

of each year. Work expenditure performed on adjacent Federal claims or MHT lands can be applied to 

State claims to satisfy this requirement. Excess work expenditures can be carried forward and be applied 

in subsequent years for as many as four years. Credits from previous years were available and 

expenditures from the 2017 drilling program were filed for future use. An Affidavit of Annual Labour was 

recorded with the State prior to November 30th, 2018. Sufficient credits have been incurred to cover work 

expenditure requirements for the next four years.  

4.5.3 Mental Health Trust Lands 

The Upland Mining Lease MHT no. 9100759 (the Lease) was made between Constantine North Inc. and 

the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority on September 1st, 2014. Pursuant to the Lease, Constantine is 

required to surrender a minimum of 25,000 acres at the end of the three-year term. On September 1st, 2017, 

an amendment (amendment No. 1) was made effective to the Lease to exclude Trust Parcel C81209 (26, 

493 acres) from the Leased Area. The Lease term was also extended for an additional three years, and the 

new expiry date for the remaining two Trust parcels is August 31st, 2020. On August 31st, 2020, the 

Company is required to surrender another minimum of 25,000 acres and can then renew the Lease for 

another three-year term (and longer) after which there are no additional requirements to reduce the land 

package.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 

Infrastructure and Physiography 

The Project is located adjacent to the paved all-weather Haines Highway (Alaska Highway #7), which 

connects the town of Haines, AK, USA situated 65 km to the southeast, with the town of Haines Junction, 

YK, Canada located 200 km to the north.  

Access to the northern, central and eastern portions of the Project from the Haines Highway is achieved by 

crossing the Klehini River via the Porcupine Bridge located at '26 Mile' (or 42 km from Haines). Travel 

continues westward along the graded Porcupine Creek access road for 11 km to the Company's camp at 

the Big Nugget mine site located on private land in the Porcupine Creek Valley (Figure 5-1). Travel from 

camp to the centre of the Project area (an additional 11 km) is afforded by a series of logging roads 

maintained by the Haines Borough, which connect to the Glacier Creek Access Road which was 

constructed (and is currently maintained) by the Company.  

The Glacier Creek Access Road provides 2-wheel drive access to within a short distance of the mineral 

resource. However, practical access to majority of the Project, including nearly all exploration drill sites, is 

by helicopter. Drill core and camp facilities are currently based at the Big Nugget Camp. 

The nearest major economic centers are Whitehorse, YK (400 km by paved road), and Juneau, AK (4½ 

hours by ferry). Daily scheduled flights connect Haines, AK with Juneau, AK which, in turn, has daily 

connections with the continental US, and via Whitehorse, YK to Vancouver, BC in Canada.  

Haines (population 2,400) is a year-round deep-sea port at the north end of the Alaska Marine Highway, 

and the town boasts infrastructure to support exploration and mining operations. Many residents commute 

daily via ferry to Juneau to the Kensington Gold Mine, operated by Coeur Mining, and the Green's Creek 

Silver-Gold-Lead-Zinc Mine operated by Hecla Mining Company.  

Temperatures are typical of the north coast of Southeast Alaska, with lows of -25º C in the winter, to highs 

of 25º C in the summer. At higher elevations, fieldwork is limited to late May through early October because 

of snow. Recent warming trends have resulted in rapid glacial retreat and better outcrop exposure over the 

past years.

6 History 

6.1 Historical Work Completed by Previous Owners 

Previous exploration work on the Project is summarized in Constantine Metal Resources Ltd. was formed 

out of Rubicon Minerals Corporation in 2006 with the primary purpose of exploring the Palmer Exploration 

Project. Constantine have completed a variety of exploration surveys and approximately 51,239 m of 

diamond drilling in 131 holes to the end of 2017. This work has led to the discovery of the massive sulfide 

deposits at the South Wall and RW Zones at the Glacier Creek prospect area and the AG Zones in the 

Nunatak prospect area.  

A summary of previous exploration programs can be found in Table 6-5.  

Total cumulative diamond drilling by the Company is 60,200 m in 156 drill holes to the end of 2018. Total 

cumulative diamond drilling on the Project by all operators to the end of 2018 is 67,745 m in 193 drill holes. 

All drilling has been summarized in Table 6-6.  

Based on the encouraging exploration results to date, the Authors believe that continued delineation drilling 

is warranted and has the potential to increase the size of the known mineral resources laterally and to 

depth. There is also potential to discover additional mineralized zones within the greater Project area 

6.1.1 1960s and 1970s 

 Base metal sulfides and barite were first discovered in the Glacier Creek prospect area (Main and 

Upper Main occurrences) in 1969 by local prospector Merrill Palmer. Palmer staked the discoveries 

and continued to prospect the area in subsequent years.  

 Barite was the original focus of exploration and prospecting led to the discovery of outcropping 

massive barite beds (+/- sphalerite/galena/sulfosalts) at the Nunatak Showing in eight distinct 

locations with individual barite lenses ranging in thickness from 0.5 to 6.0 m within a thick (>100 m) 

section of intensely QSP-altered basalt and rhyolite. 

 A 91 kg (200 lb) bulk sample from one of three stacked barite beds at the Nunatak showing yielded 

an average grade of 11.84 oz/ton Ag and 0.092 oz/ton Au (Tobey 1988).  

 Merrill Palmer arranged for tests to be conducted on bulk samples by B.P. Alaska Inc. and Lutak 

Trading & Stevedoring Company. Although the baritic material was determined to be suitable for 

production of drilling mud concentrates, none of the prospects were developed.  

Discovery History 

 From 1969 to 1971, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) completed regional mapping, 

which provided a geological framework for the Project (MacKevett et al., 1974).  

 Subsequent grab samples collected by the USBM at the Nunatak showing graded up to 335.3 ppm 

Ag (10.8 oz/ton), 2.58 ppm Au (0.083 oz/ton), 2.38% Zn, 0.18% Cu, 2.0% Pb and 48% Ba (Still, 

1991).

 In 1979, Anaconda Copper Company drilled the first three (3) diamond drill holes (totaling 801 m) 

on the Project. Although all holes failed to intersect the main mineralized barite and base metal 

sulfide horizons, one hole (GC-2) cored 426m of rock containing pyrite and sericite alteration, and 

the hole reportedly ended in siliceous sulfide breccia containing pyrite and sericite. Anaconda 

began a mapping program the following year (1980) in efforts to resolve structural problems during 

the drill program; however, Anaconda terminated the option before follow-up drilling. 

6.1.2 1980s 

 In the early 1980s, exploration successes at nearby Windy Craggy and Greens Creek improved 

the understanding and base metal potential at Palmer.  

 In 1983, high-grade massive sulfide boulders up to 1.8 m (6 ft) in diameter, and grading up to 33% 

Zn and 2.5% Cu, were discovered at the base of a small ice sheet near Mount Henry Clay (Still et 

al., 1991). Twenty-six (26) samples of various boulders collected by the U.S. Bureau of Mines 

returned an average grade of 19.3% Zn, 1.0% Cu, 0.4% Pb, 38.2 g/t Ag, 0.22 g/t Au, and 20.6% 

Ba (Still, 1984). The discovery of these boulders was followed up with four consecutive drill 

programs by operators Bear Creek Mining/Kennecott (1984 and 1985), Granges Exploration Inc. 

(1989), and Rubicon Minerals Corporation (1999). Over this period, a total of thirteen (13) holes 

were drilled and totaled 2,958 m of core. None of the drill programs located the source of the 

boulders. 

 In the mid-late 1980s, Newmont Exploration Ltd. conducted exploration on the Project, and focused 

primarily on the Cap and Nunatak prospects. The Cap prospect was drilled by Newmont in 1988 

and again by Rubicon in 1998, with the best intercept of the four (4) holes containing 23.2 m @ 

134 g/t Ag within massive pyritic barite and baritic breccia. At the Nunatak prospect, a bulk sample 

(91 kg (200 lb) divided into thirteen separate samples) returned an arithmetic average grade of 

11.84 oz/ton Ag and 0.092 oz/ton Au. 

6.1.3 1990s 

 In the early 1990s, ice retreat exposed an outcrop of massive sulfide in the Glacier Creek prospect 

area that is now known as the Little Jarvis occurrence. The best grades received by Kennecott from 

chip samples from the Little Jarvis occurrence contained up to 4.6 m @ 13.0% Zn, 7.0% Cu, 0.02 

oz/ton Au, and 7.0 oz/ton Ag; (Wakeman, 1995); however, Rubicon Minerals Corp were 

unsuccessful at reproducing these grades, with their best grade containing 3.05 m @ 10.8 % Zn, 

0.27% Cu, 0.17 ppm (0.005 oz/ton) Au, and 44.2 ppm (1.29 oz/ton) Ag. 

 In 1999, Rubicon Minerals Corp. interpreted that the Little Jarvis occurrence was correlative with 

the Upper Main occurrence on the other side of the mountain to the southeast, which led to the 

discovery of the RW Zone. Semi-massive to massive sulfide and leached, oxidized equivalent of 

the RW Zone was intersected in six (6) drill holes and was open at depth. No additional drilling 

occurred on the Project until the acquisition by Constantine in 2006. 

 Several geophysical surveys have been conducted on the Palmer Project over time, the most 

significant of which was a helicopter-borne magnetic-EM survey, planned by Kennecott in the mid-

1980's, and it covered most of the main mineral occurrences. A follow-up survey was conducted in 

1991, and Cominco detailed three of the airborne EM surveys with TDEM (EM-37) ground surveys.

One of the TDEM surveys confirmed that an airborne EM anomaly 750 m eastward along strike of 

the mineral occurrences at the Glacier Creek prospect represented a significant conductor, with a 

geophysical signature consistent with that of a large massive sulfide deposit (Cominco, 1993). 

Cominco Alaska proposed three drill holes to test the different geophysical interpretations of the 

conductor (based on spatial orientation; flat lying versus steeply dipping), however, the holes were 

not drilled before Cominco's option lapsed. 

 In 1993, Kennecott drilled one hole (P94-1) to test an interpretation that the conductive anomaly 

was flat-lying and in 1998, Rubicon Minerals drilled a second hole (RMC98-4). No significant 

mineralization was intersected in either hole. It was proposed that significant problems with locating 

the original survey grid may have been a factor in the holes missing their intended target. 

6.1.4 Early 2000s 

No significant field work was carried out on the Project. 

6.2 Historical Work by Constantine Metal Resources Ltd.  

6.2.1 2006 Field Season 

Constantine Metal Resources Ltd. was formed in 2006 with the primary purpose of exploring the Palmer 

Project. Three (3) holes (CMR06-01 to 03) were drilled totaling 829 m, all of which targeted the eastern 

extension of RW Zone mineralization that was discovered by Rubicon Minerals Corporation in 1999. Two 

(2) drill holes intersected baritic massive sulfide mineralization, with grades including: 5.1 m @ 0.25% Cu, 

11.18% Zn, 0.14 g/t Au, and 47.6 g/t Ag. 

6.2.2 2007 Field Season 

Seven (7) drill holes (CMR07-04 to 10) were drilled totaling 2,314 m, two of which targeted the Cap prospect 

and five targeted the Glacier Creek prospect area. Two holes in the Glacier Creek area contained significant 

massive sulfide intercepts in two separate horizons referred to the 'RW' and 'South Wall' zones including:  

 14.0 m @ 4.09% Cu, 7.35% Zn, 0.40 g/t Au and 50.9 g/t Ag, in hole CMR07-07 and  

 24.2 m @ 1.21% Cu, 7.15% Zn, 0.78 g/t Au and 55.4 g/t Ag, in hole CMR07-09 

These two holes were most significant drilled to date and provided recognition of the potential for a major 

massive sulfide deposit, with all subsequent drilling focused entirely on deposit definition and expansion 

within the Glacier Creek prospect area. 

6.2.3 2008 Field Season 

Twelve (12) holes (CMR08-11 to 22) were drilled totaling 4,241 m, rapidly expanded the known extent of 

mineralization. 

Between the 2006 and 2008 exploration programs, an 11 line-km grid was established down slope in 

vegetated cover along trend to the east of the South Wall Zones. The area covered the projected mineral 

horizons and was utilized for collection of soil samples as well as conducting geophysical surveys. Soil 

samples were collected at 25 m intervals along the 100 m spaced grid lines and identified several multi-

element geochemical anomalies. Ground magnetic and CSAMT (Controlled Source Audio-Magneto

Telluric) geophysical surveys were completed over the grid area. Two additional CSAMT lines were 

completed over known, or suspected, RW Zone mineralization at higher elevations.  

6.2.4 2009 Field Season 

Ten (10) drill holes (CMR09-23 to 32) were completed totaling 4,561 m. The results of the 2008 and 2009 

drilling rapidly expanded the known extent of mineralization and provided sufficient drill density to calculate 

a mineral resource estimate for the deposit (see below). Eight of the ten holes drilled in 2009 were surveyed 

using 3D downhole Time Domain Electro Magnetic (TDEM) geophysics, which proved to be effective at 

identifying copper-rich portions of South Wall Zone massive sulfide. 

Regional geological field mapping and prospecting was completed over the federal lode mining claims 

throughout the 2007, 2008 and 2009 exploration programs and aided the understanding of the regional 

geological setting. Surface samples collected from the JAG showing, exposed 535 m to the southeast of 

the Nunatak showing on the southern slope of the Nunatak above South Saksaia Glacier with outcroppings 

of barite and massive galena + sphalerite, returned assays up to 10.4% Zn, 20% Pb, 537 g/t Ag, and 0.73 

g/t Au (Wasteneys, 2009)  

High-definition metallurgical and mineralogical work and benchmarking was completed on six core samples 

of mineralization from South Wall Zones I and II (SGS Canada Inc., 2009). The samples were chosen to 

represent the main styles of mineralization recognized in drilling to date. Although preliminary in nature, the 

work suggested that the mineralogy was simple, with coarse grained sulfides that would likely yield good 

recoveries and high-grade concentrates having low milling costs. 

Following completion of the 2009 drill campaign, independent consultant Gary Giroux, P. Eng. of Giroux 

Consultants Ltd. was commissioned to prepare an NI43-101 compliant initial resource estimate for the 

Palmer project (Grieg and Giroux, 2010). The Inferred mineral resource estimate for the RW and South 

Wall Zones is outlined in Table 6-1 for a range of NSR (Net Smelter Return) cut-offs. 

Table 6-1: 2010 Inferred Mineral Resource 

 
Source: Giroux (2010) 

Notes 

1. Assumed metal prices for gold (Au), silver (Ag), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) were US$700/oz, US$12/oz, US$2.25/lb, US$0.85/lb, 
and estimated metal recoveries were 55%, 55%, 90%, 90% respectively.  

2. The NSR formula equaled US$36.87 x Cu% + US$9.54 x Zn% + US$11.12 x Au g/t + US$0.18 x Ag g/t. NSR formula was based 
on assumed values for offsite costs, metal recovery, and metal prices. Offsite costs included transportation of concentrate, smelter 
treatment charges, and refining charges. An [2010] NSR cut-off grade of US$50 per tonne was considered appropriate for reporting 
the base case resource considering the likely underground mining extraction scenario envisioned for the project. 

3. Forty-six (46) diamond drill holes were used in generating the 2010 geological model for the South Wall and RW Zones, with 26 
of the holes (9,302 m) included in the resource estimate. Outlier assays were capped and all assays within the mineralized zones 
composited to 1.25 m lengths. Metal grades were estimated using inverse distance squared interpolation into a 3D block model 
with block dimensions of 10 x 10 x 5 m. Three dimensional geologic solids were constructed by Qualified Person, Darwin Green, 
VP-Exploration for Constantine and, in general, were limited to material grading > 0.5% Cu or > 2% Zn that could be demonstrated 
to be correlative with definable stratabound zones. As a general rule, solids were extended no more than 50 m up-dip, down-dip 
and along strike from any drill hole.

6.2.5 2010 Field Season 

Ten (10) diamond drill holes (CMR10-33 to 42) were completed, totaling 4,017 m. Drilling resulted in the 

successful expansion of both the RW and South Wall mineralization zones and opened up expansion 

possibilities down dip and down slope on the South Wall mineralization.  

Highlights included:  

 10.4 m @ 0.30% Cu, 4.18% Zn, 0.42% Pb, 81.60 g/t Ag and 0.87 g/t Au, in CMR10-34B (SWZI)  

 7.10 m @ 2.10% Cu, 1,52% Zn, 16.80 g/t Ag and 0.18 g/t Au, in CMR10-035 (RW Zone)  

 23.80 m @ 0.36% Cu, 2.95% Zn, 0.96% Pb, 123.10 g/t Ag and 0.82 g/t Au, in CMR10-38B (RW 

Oxide)  

 20.80 m @ 1.03% Cu, 5.01% Zn, 11.30 g/t Ag and 0.14 g/t Au, in CMR10-040 (SWZI) and  

 17.40 m @ 0.16% Cu, 2.25% Zn and 1.60 g/t Ag, in CMR10-040 (SWZIII) 

The program included both surface and downhole electro-magnetic (EM) geophysical surveys. Downhole 

EM surveys were completed on six of the ten holes drilled in 2010. Surface-based EM surveys totaled 

approximately 37-line km and covered areas immediately along trend from the 4.75 million tonne Inferred 

resource, as well as the Mount Henry Clay (MHC) prospect located 4.5 km to the west.  

6.2.6 2011 and 2012 Field Seasons 

No field work completed.  

6.2.7 2013 Field Season 

Ten (10) drill holes (CMR13-43 to 52) were completed totaling 3,747 m and targeted open edges of the 

South Wall and RW Zones, with step-out distances ranging from 30 to 100 m and elevations above the 

1100 m level. The program was highly successful in expanding the mineralized zones with significant 

mineralization intersected in seven of ten holes (including five high-grade intersections of >20 m in width). 

The drilling also helped confirm a revised geological model for the South Wall environment, and better 

constrain the structural controls on the geometry and location of massive sulfide mineralization.  

Highlights included:  

 21.71 m @ 2.36% Cu, 9.06% Zn, 0.13% Pb, 28.8 g/t Ag and 0.33 g/t Au, in CMR13-45 

 20.58 m @ 0.92% Cu, 7.18% Zn, 0.25% Pb, 45.3 g/t Ag and 0.32 g/t Au, in CMR13-46 and 

 24.66 m @ 2.02% Cu, 8.47% Zn, 31.7 g/t Ag and 0.51 g/t Au, in CMR13-49 

The 2013 program included surface geological mapping, borehole geophysical surveying of seven drill 

holes, completion on a M.Sc. thesis (Steeves, 2013), boulder sampling at Mount Henry Clay, metallurgical 

studies, initiation of access road construction, and numerous baseline environmental and geotechnical 

studies, community relations activities.  

A total of 311 mineralized boulders were recorded over two days at the MHC prospect (ranging in size 

(length) from 7 cm to 240 cm. Sphalerite content averaged 24.6%, chalcopyrite 3.6%, barite 59%, and pyrite 

19%. Of the 102 boulders mapped as Massive Sulfide, sphalerite content averages 37.1%, chalcopyrite

4.2%, barite 35% and pyrite 27.3%. The largest concentration of mineralized boulders defined a roughly 

50 m wide east-northeast to northeast trending corridor over approximately 250 m and suggested a bedrock 

source located to the southwest in the area with the greatest density of past drilling at MHC. 

The 2013 metallurgical program, which included the first flotation test work done on the deposit, was carried 

out by SGS Canada Inc. (2013), in Vancouver, under the supervision and direction of metallurgists from 

Dowa. The test work demonstrated that the deposit responds very well to conventional metallurgy. Locked 

cycle flotation tests yielded smeltable copper and zinc concentrates, with high metal recoveries (e.g. 89.6% 

Cu, 84.9% Zn, 89.7% Ag, 75.0% Au) produced at moderate grind sizes.  

Environmental work focused on data collection necessary for permitting an access road up Glacier Creek 

valley. This work included an aquatic biology survey, including fish presence or absence determinations, 

and wetlands delineation studies. A road layout consultant was also contracted to establish the road 

alignment and stream crossing requirements.  

6.2.8 2014 Field Season 

Sixteen (16) exploration drill holes (CMR14-53 to 68) and one geotechnical hole (GT14-01) totaling 9,796 

m (32,136 feet) targeted the deeper portion of the South Wall mineral resource, and the Option 9 proposed 

exploration drift alignment. The program resulted in the intersection of a major new zone of massive sulfide 

in the South Wall area corresponding to the modeled SW EMZ geophysical target and on trend of the 

existing mineral resource. Massive sulfide and/or sulfide-rich massive barite was intersected in five drill 

holes within the SW EMZ target (CMR14-54, 63, 64, 65, 66) defining a strike length of 225 m and a vertical 

distance of 150 m.  

The thickest mineralization was intersected on the east side of the SW EMZ target with: 

 22.10 m @ 2.48% Cu, 4.05% Zn, 24.00 g/t Ag and 0.39 g/t Au, in CMR14-54 and  

 89.00 m @0.79% Cu, 5.03% Zn, 21.10 g/t Ag and 0.31 g/t Au, in CMR14-65 

The 89 m intersection was the widest drilled to date on the Project (approximately twice the length of the 

next widest intersection with a minimum true width of 65 to 75 m). Mineralization was interpreted to be an 

extension of SWZII and SWZIII and extends the total plunge length of continuous South Wall mineralization 

to 700 m. Deep step-out holes on the SW EMZ target (holes CMR14-56, 58 and 62) revealed the presence 

of a steep, east-southeast trending fault (the 'Kudo fault') which was interpreted to offset the down-dip 

extension of the massive sulfide horizon.  

The 2014 field program included surface geological mapping and geochemical sampling, borehole 

geophysical surveying of six drill holes, numerous baseline environmental and geotechnical studies, 

community relations activities, and construction of the new gravel 3.6 km Glacier Creek access road and 

supply yard to connect the core of the Project to the existing Haines Borough logging road network.  

Geotechnical studies focused on data needs to support design and permitting of an extended access road 

and preliminary assessment of underground exploration access. Work included the completion of a sub-

horizontal geotechnical drill hole (GT14-01) at the Option 9 exploration portal site, hydrology test work and 

groundwater studies (SRK, 2014), surface mapping of fractures and joints, acquisition of LIDAR data for 

detailed topography, avalanche studies, slope stability analysis and road design work. Surface samples 

collected by the Company at the Nunatak showing assayed up to 1275 g/t Ag, 1.0 g/t Au, 3.7% Pb, and 

1.6% Zn (CEM, 2014).

Environmental studies consisted of both long-term baseline data collection and near-term data needs to 

support permitting in 2015. Work included water quality sampling, aquatic survey work, wildlife observations 

and habitat mapping, weather station installation, acid base accounting, cultural resource studies 

(archeology), and hydrology work. 

Following completion of the 2014 drilling campaign, an independent NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource 

estimate was prepared by James N. Gray, P. Geo., of Advantage Geoservices Ltd. (Gray and Cunningham-

Dunlop, 2015). The Inferred Mineral Resource for the RW and South Wall Zones is tabulated below in Table 

6-2 for a range of NSR (Net Smelter Return) cut-off values based on assumed underground mining and 

milling costs. The resource utilized a base case cut-off of $75 per tonne. A comparison to the 2010 

Resource is shown in Table 6-3.

1. Assumed metal prices are US$2.75/lb for copper (Cu), and US$1.00/lb for zinc (Zn), US$1200/oz for gold (Au), US$18/oz for 
silver (Ag). Estimated metal recoveries are 89.6% for copper, 84.9% for zinc, 75% for gold (61.5% to the Cu concentrate and

from the 2013 metallurgical locked cycle flotation tests.  

2. The 2015 NSR equals (US$45.69 x Cu% + US$11.70 x Zn% + US$25.04 x Au g/t + US$0.43 x Ag g/t). NSR formula is based 
on assumed values for offsite costs, metal recovery, and metal prices. Offsite costs include transportation of concentrate, 
smelter treatment charges, and refining charges.  

3. An [2015] NSR cut-off grade of US$75 per tonne was considered appropriate for reporting the base case resource considering 
the likely underground mining extraction scenario envisioned for the project. 

4. Eighty-two (82) diamond drill holes were used in generating the geological model for the South Wall and RW zones, 48 of which 
intersect the interpreted mineralized zones in 19,000 m of core. Outlier assays were capped, and assays were composited to 
1.5 m lengths within the boundaries of interpreted mineralized zones. Three dimensional geologic solids were constructed by 
Darwin Green, Vice President of Exploration and reviewed by Ian Cunningham-Dunlop, P. Eng., Vice President, Advanced 
Projects, and, in general, were limited to material grading > 0.5% Cu or > 2% Zn that could be demonstrated to be correlative 
with definable stratabound zones. As a general rule, solids were extended no more than 50 m up-dip, down-dip and along strike 
from a drill hole; the Inferred Mineral Resource includes only mineralization within 75 m of a drill hole. A total of five solids were 
constructed for sulfide mineralization: South Wall Zone 1, South Wall Zone 2-3, South Wall EM Zone, RW West, and RW East. 
Metal grades were estimated using inverse distance cubed interpolation into a 3D block model with block dimensions of 6x6x6 
m. 

Source: Constantine (2018)  

The 2015 resource estimate significantly increased the size of the deposit, highlighting the success of the 

prior drill campaigns and the growing potential of the project. The resource was interpreted as open for 

expansion in most areas with the thickest part of the deposit located at the down-dip limit of the South Wall 

Zone. Barium content within the resource averaged approximately 13 to 15%, equating to a barite mineral 

content of approximately 22 to 25% by weight. 

6.2.9 2015 Field Season 

Ten (10) drill holes (CMR14-56Ext, CMR15-69 to 76) totaling 7,735.8 m (25,380 feet) were completed at 

the South Wall resource area. The primary objective was the expansion of the South Wall Zone with focus 

on targets surrounding the 2014 South Wall EM Zone discovery area, and areas south of the Kudo fault to 

define extensions of the EM Zone at the Lower Offset target. South Wall EM Zone mineralization was 

successfully intersected in three holes, extending the known extent of the mineralized system approximately 

100 m east (CMR15-72 and CMR15-73) and 65 m up dip (CMR15-75).  

Significant intersections include:  

 4.2 m @ 0.5% Cu, 3.98% Zn, 60.4 g/t Ag and 0.65 g/t Au, in hole CMR15-72 

 3.0 m @ 2.32% Cu and 14.9 g/t Ag, in hole CMR15-75 

Drill hole CMR15-69 was planned to test eastern extensions of the EM Zone and intersected EM Zone 

equivalent stratigraphy and mineralization at greater depth, south of the North Kudo fault and within the 

Lower Offset target area and returned 7.2 m @ 0.43% Cu and 0.46% Zn and intense footwall QSP

alteration, in hole CMR15-69. Three holes planned to test the Lower Offset target area, south of the Kudo 

fault, did not intersect South Wall mineralization, alteration or obvious mineralized horizon stratigraphy 

suggesting that the postulated movement on the Kudo Fault was incorrect. Borehole and surface EM 

geophysical surveys were completed on eight holes and over 7.5 surface line km. Data collected suggested 

that conductors are beyond the depth of the deepest holes drilled and therefore the exact definition of these 

conductors remains ambiguous. 

The 2015 program also included regional geological mapping at the Glacier Ck (South Wall)/Red 

Creek/Flower Mountain/Jasper Mountain areas, detailed geological mapping at the Little Jarvis prospect 

areas in support of a B.Sc. thesis, surface electromagnetic and seismic geophysical surveys, downhole 

electromagnetic surveys of eight drill holes, exploration access road construction, and ongoing engineering, 

environmental, geotechnical, permitting and community relations-related work.  

6.2.10 2016 Field Season 

Seven (7) diamond drill holes totalling 1,967.7 m were completed, including four holes (CMR16-78 to 

81B)/1,464.7 m of exploration drilling on the South Wall QSP, Pump Valley and Cap targets and three holes 

(GT16-02 to 04)/502.0 m of geotechnical drilling. No significant results were returned from drilling at the 

South Wall or Pump Valley, while drilling at the Cap target successfully expanded the known extent of the 

mineral system with a 21-m section of chert +/- semi-massive pyrite returning 3.1 g/t Ag over 7.7 m, 

including 0.5 m of 10 g/t Ag, in hole CMR16-79.  

Other field work included downhole electromagnetic surveys of three drill holes, regional geological 

mapping at the Nunatak prospect area, structural studies on the South Wall resource area, access road 

construction, and ongoing engineering, environmental, geotechnical, permitting and community relations-

related work.  

The detailed mapping and sampling work at the Nunatak prospect refined the understanding of the 

geological stratigraphy and the potential controls on mineralization. Notably, the work revealed the width of 

the barite-sulfide beds to be thicker than previously thought, with true-width sections measuring up to 5 m 

or more at both the upper and lower showings. Chip sampling across the beds has yielded up to 4.7 m @ 

128 g/t Ag, 0.49 g/t Au, 0.29% Zn, 0.59% Pb and 39.1% Ba. Individual samples from the prospect area 

assay as high as 778 g/t Ag, 0.89 g/t Au, 4.04% Zn, 3.53% Pb and 44.3% Ba. The inferred surface trace 

of the folded upper mineral horizon from the northernmost outcrop exposure to the southernmost outcrop 

exposure was found to be ~ 275 m in length, and extending over an elevation range of ~ 90 m. It was 

interpreted that the scale of the alteration system at Nunatak, coupled with the extent of the barite-dominant 

mineralization, supported potential for a significant massive sulfide system at Nunatak and a 

recommendation for follow-up drilling was made. 

6.2.11 2017 Field Season 

Thirty-two (32) diamond drill holes totaling 10,631 m, including 26 holes (CMR17-82 to 107)/9,221.9 m of 

exploration drilling and six holes (GT17-05 to 10)/1,409.1 m of geotechnical drilling, were completed. The 

top priority was given to the preliminary testing of the Nunatak Prospect Area, as well as, follow-up drilling 

at the Cap target, and ongoing resource infill and expansion drilling of the South Wall Zone II-III zones. The 

results from South Wall Zones II/III were very encouraging with holes CMR17-82, 84 and 86 intersecting 

wide intervals of chalcopyrite- and sphalerite-rich baritic massive sulfide overlying massive pyrite and 

chalcopyrite which dramatically increased the width and grade of mineralization on section 4211000E.

Holes CMR17-95, -97, and -100 along section 421050E also successfully extended South Wall Zones II/III 

by 50 to 60 m to the west and confirmed continuity of wide high-grade mineralization over a dip length of 

approximately 90 m.

The Nunatak prospect area was drilled for the first time with 13 drill holes that resulted in the discovery of 

the new AG Zones. Mineralization was intersected over an area measuring approximately 225 m x 50 m, 

and over a vertical distance of approximately 200 m (vertical dip length ~ 275 m) and remained open in all 

directions. Mineralization consists of stacked massive and semi-massive sulfide and barite, and feeder-

style stringers and replacement, including a high-grade silver-gold upper zone, and a zinc-rich lower zone.  

Significant upper silver-gold zone intersections include:  

 9.2 m @ 312 g/t Ag and 0.9 g/t Au, in CMR17-89 

 24.6 m @ 260 g/t Ag, 0.5 g/t Au, 1.4% Zn and 0.5% Pb, in CMR17-94

 41.3 m @ 5.8% Zn, 0.2% Pb, 0.1% Cu, 9 g/t Ag and 0.1 g/t Au, in CMR17-96 

The 2017 field program also included downhole electromagnetic surveys of three drill holes, a 1,137 line 

km SkyTEM airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey, ongoing geological mapping and rock sampling 

at the Nunatak prospect area, structural studies at the South Wall resource area, detailed geological 

mapping at the AG Zone areas in support of an Applied Master's thesis project, a subglacial sampling 

program at Mount Henry Clay, access road construction, and a wide range of engineering, environmental, 

geotechnical, permitting, and community relations-related work. The engineering work in 2017 included a 

focused effort on evaluation of underground exploration options and collecting data necessary for design, 

decision making, and potential future permitting.  

A preliminary scoping level barite metallurgical test program on the Glacier Creek deposit was initiated in 

March 2018 with the primary objective of determining if the deposit can produce a marketable barite 

concentrate as a co-product for the copper-zinc-gold-silver flotation process. A secondary objective was to

collect additional copper-zinc flotation data based on fresher sample material than was used in the previous 

metallurgical program. Detailed testwork included: sample preparation; sample characterization; grindability 

testing; copper and zinc rougher/cleaner/locked cycle testing with up to ten (10) preliminary cleaner flotation 

tests and six (6) locked cycle tests; followed by barite rougher/cleaner/locked cycle testing with up to eight 

(8) preliminary cleaner flotation tests and six (6) locked cycle tests. The final barite concentrates also 

underwent QEMSCAN™ mineralogical testing. SGS (2018) reached the following conclusions based on 

their test program: 

 Mineralogy indicated that the economically recoverable minerals in the High Ba Composite head 

sample are chalcopyrite (5.07%), sphalerite (13.4%), barite (40.9%), and less than 1% of galena 

(0.66%) 

 A Bond Ball Mill Work Index test found the sample to be categorized as very soft with a BWI of 6.3 

kWh/t 

 The final copper concentrate projected recovery was 88.9% at a grade of 24.5% Cu and a final zinc 

concentrate projected recovery was 93.1% at a grade of 61.3% Zn 

 The developed flowsheet for barite recovery involved a pyrite pre-float prior to barite flotation stage, 

and the barite rougher concentrate was cleaned in three stages, producing a final barite 

concentrate projected recovery of 91.1% at a grade of 52.3% Ba (88.8% BaSO4). Analysis of a final 

concentrate by the more reliable XRF76V method reported a higher final concentrate grade of 

55.9% Ba (95.0% BaSO4) and 

 Mineralogy indicates that the final barite concentrate is 95.6% barite with the remainder comprised 

of various silicates and other minerals. Barite is 99.8% liberated with very trace attachments of 

0.2%. Silicates and other minerals in the concentrate are also well liberated. 

Following completion of the 2017 drilling campaign, an independent mineral resource estimate was 

prepared by James N. Gray, P. Geo., of Advantage Geoservices Ltd. (Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop, 

2018). The resource incorporates all exploration drilling in the Palmer deposit area completed to the end of 

2017. The Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource for the RW and South Wall Zones is tabulated below in 

Table 6-4 for a range of NSR (Net Smelter Return) cut-off values. Based on assumed underground mining 

and milling costs, the resource utilizes a base case cut-off of $75 per tonne. The resource had an effective 

date of September 27th, 2018 based on a data cut-off of May 1st, 2018.

Notes 

1. The cut-off date for drill data included in the resource is May 1st, 2018.  

2. Net Smelter Return (NSR) equals (US$16.01 x Zn% + US$48.67 x Cu% + US$23.45 x Au g/t + US$0.32 x Ag g/t). NSR formula 
is based on estimated metallurgical recoveries, assumed metal prices, and assumed offsite costs that include transportation of 
concentrate, smelter treatment charges, and refining charges.  

3. Assumed metal prices are US$1.15/lb for zinc (Zn), US$3.00/lb for copper (Cu), US$1250/oz for gold (Au), US$16/oz for silver 
(Ag).  

4. Estimated metal recoveries are 93.1% for zinc, 89.6% for copper, 90.9% for silver (70.8% to the Cu concentrate and 20.1% to 
the Zn concentrate) and 69.6% for gold (49.5% to the Cu concentrate and 20.1% to the Zn concentrate) as determined from 
metallurgical locked cycle flotation tests completed in 2018.  

5. Barite is not included in the NSR value. 

6. Zinc equivalent (ZnEq%) and Copper equivalent (CuEq%) values calculated based on the NSR formula above plus an assumed 
net-value for barite as described below (e.g. CuEq = (total NSR value + BaSO4 net-value)/US$48.67. 

7. BaSO4 net-value equals US$0.566 x BaSO4% (e.g. a resource grade of 24% BaSO4 x $0.566 = US$13.6 per tonne or 0.85% 
ZnEq). Formula based on barite recovery of 91.1% from metallurgical tests, assumed wholesale drilling-grade barite price in 
nearest North American markets of US$227/metric tonne, and assumed all-in transportation cost of US$150/tonne.  

8. One hundred and eight exploration (108) diamond drill holes for 44,900 m and geological surface mapping were used to generate 
the geological and structural model for the South Wall and RW zones. Sixty (60) of the holes intersect the interpreted mineralized 
solids. Outlier assays were capped and all assays within the mineralized zones composited to 1.5-m lengths. Metal grades were 
estimated using inverse distance cubed interpolation into a 3D block model with block dimensions of 6 x 6 x 6 m. Density was 
estimated by inverse distance squared interpolation, with unique density values determined by conventional analytical methods 
for virtually all assay samples. Three dimensional geologic solids were constructed by Darwin Green, Vice President of 
Exploration and reviewed by Ian Cunningham-Dunlop, P.Eng., Vice President, Advanced Projects, and, in general, were limited 
to material grading > 0.5% Cu or > 2% Zn that could be demonstrated to be correlative with definable stratabound zones. As a 
general rule, solids were extended no more than 50 m up-dip, down-dip and along strike from a drill hole except where geology 
supports extension in the plunge direction of mineralization. A total of four solids were constructed for sulfide mineralization: 
South Wall Zone 1, South Wall Zone 2-3-EM, RW West, and RW East. 

9. Indicated Resources include only a portion of the upper part of the South Wall Zone, where drill density and confidence in the 
geological model are highest. Indicated Mineral Resource blocks meet the criteria of being a minimum 25-m distance away from 
the outer edge of the mineralized geological solid, estimated by a minimum of three holes, and have an average distance to three 
holes of less than or equal to 50 m; remaining estimated blocks are classified as Inferred Mineral Resource. 

The 2018 mineral resource highlights include:  

 Indicated Resource of 4,677,000 tonnes grading 11.67% zinc equivalent (3.84% CuEq). This 

represented the first Indicated Resource for Palmer, and accounts for 47% of the total resource. 

 Inferred Resource of 5,338,000 tonnes grading 9.90% zinc equivalent (3.26% CuEq).  

 First resource to report barite mineralization for the Palmer deposit, highlighting the opportunity for 

barite to contribute value as an industrial mineral co-product.

6.2.12 2018 Field Season 

Constantine completed exploration, definition and geotechnical drill programs during 2018 field season. 

The Company drilled 30 new diamond drill holes totaling 10,359 m since the last NI 43-101 technical report 

(Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop, 2018) for a cumulative total of 67,745 m in 193 diamond drill holes since 

start of drilling on the Project in 1979. Drilling focused on the Palmer deposit, the Nunatak-AG Zone, and 

the Boundary Prospect.  

Infill drilling at the Palmer deposit was successful with holes CMR18-108/CMR18-108W, CMR18-111 and 

CMR18-113 demonstrating continuous zinc and copper mineralization down-dip from historic hole CMR14-

59 in the western down-plunge portion of SWZ II/III. Drill hole CMR18-129, in the eastern up-plunge portion 

for SWZ II/III, also intersected 80 meters of stringer-style mineralization. Significant 2018 SW Zone II/III 

assay intersections include: 

 15.5 m @ 4.8% Zn, 1.6% Cu, 24.6 g/t Ag, 0.1 g/t Au, in hole CMR18-108, including  

 4.1 m @ 15.9% Zn, 0.3% Cu, 5.3 g/t Ag, and  

 6.1 m @ 3.6% Cu, 0.3% Zn, 56.0 g/t Ag, and 0.2 g/t Au 

 1.3 m @ 1.7% Zn, 0.2% Cu, 7.1 g/t Ag, and 0.1 g/t Au, in hole CMR18-111 

 10.9 m @ 1.8% Zn, 0.3% Cu, 6.1 g/t Ag, in hole CMR18-113, including 

 5.3 m @ 1.7% Zn, 0.5% Cu, 9.9 g/t Ag 

 12.2 m @ 3.1% Zn, 0.4% Cu, 7.0 g/t Ag, 0.1 g/t Au, and   

 6.0 m @ 3.1% Zn, 0.4% Cu, 5.2 g/t Ag, 0.1 g/t Au, and 

 3.9 m @ 1.1% Zn, 1.4% Cu, 17.0 g/t Ag, 0.1 g/t Au, in hole CMR18-129 

The Kudo Wedge Target, a postulated offset of the Palmer deposit between the Kudo North and Kudo Main 

Faults was tested with drill hole, CMR18-123, a 150 m deep eastern step-out from CMR14-69 and 

intersected 15 meters of jasper/chert at the projected target horizon along with strong footwall alteration but 

with no significant base metal mineralization.  

The 2018 drilling program on the AG Zone deposit was highly successful and effectively tripled the strike 

length and vertical extent of mineralization from 180 m x 50 m to a minimum of 550 m x 250 m. 

Mineralization at the AG Zone deposit consists of massive and semi-massive sulfide and barite, and feeder-

style stringers and replacement, including a high-grade silver-gold upper zone, and a zinc-rich lower zone. 

Highlights from 2018 AG Zone deposit drill holes included:  

 4.8 m @ 436 g/t Ag, 1.3 g/t Au, 3.6% Zn, 1.6% Pb and 61.6% barite, and  

 12.5 m @ 217 g/t Ag, 1.8 g/t Au, 5.2% Zn, 0.7% Pb and 29.7% barite, in CMR18-109 

 43.3 m @ 143 g/t Ag, 0.5 g/t Au, 6.5% Zn, 2.5% Pb and 41.1% barite, in CMR18-110, incl.  

 28.8 m @ 141 g/t Ag, 0.5 g/t Au, 9.0% Zn, 3.5% Pb and 21.5% barite

Drilling at the new Boundary Prospect Area with four drill holes (CMR18-117/119/121/122) successfully 

intersected the targeted contact between graphitic argillite and QSP-altered rhyolite and pyrite stringers 

with local barite, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and sulfosalt mineralization. While massive sulfide mineralization 

was not encountered and the EM anomalies may reflect graphitic argillite, barite-sulfide stringer and thin 

massive barite mineralization was intersected, the source of the high-grade boulders and the massive 

hydrothermal carbonate still remains a target and the prospective stratigraphy, strong and widespread 

hydrothermal alteration of the rhyolite with trace base and precious metal mineralization distributed 

throughout remains encouraging.  

The 2018 field program also included downhole electromagnetic surveys of three drill holes, a 1,137-line 

km SkyTEM airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey, ongoing geological mapping and rock sampling 

at the Nunatak prospect area, structural studies 

6.2.13 Ongoing Exploration Access Road Construction 

The Glacier Creek access road was extended to the head of Glacier Creek valley in 2018, for a total length 

of 5.9 km to provide access to MHT fee-simple lands near the base of the South Wall resource (Figure 6-1). 

Construction was completed in three phases, with 0.6 km completed in 2015, 1.4 km in 2016, 0.5 km in 

2017, and 0.92 km in 2018. The road is single-lane with a 4.5-m wide running surface and passing pull-

outs spaced approximately 300 m apart. Laydown areas for equipment and supply storage were also built.  

The Glacier Creek access road connects with existing gravel logging roads to the all season paved Haines 

highway. Total road distance from the end of Glacier Creek road to Haines is approximately 60 km.

6.2.14 Ongoing Geotechnical and Engineering 

Many geotechnical and engineering studies have been completed in support of assessing options for 

advanced exploration and potential future preliminary economic assessment to feasibility level analysis. 

Evaluation of a conceptual exploration drift for continued drill expansion and drill definition on the deeper 

portion of the existing resource was a focus of several of the studies. Key studies completed to date have 

included: 

 geotechnical drilling for rock quality, hydrogeology, and environmental geochemistry 

 shallow seismic surveys for determination of overburden depth  

 options assessment of potential exploration portal site and access drift locations 

 avalanche studies and protection berm design 

 civil engineering for road alignments and water collection systems 

 soils studies and infiltration tests 

 hydrogeology studies and modelling ground water flow to conceptual exploration drift  

 glacier ice depth studies, and 

 scoping level assessment of potential infrastructure sites for mining operations

6.2.15 Summary of Historic Work  

Constantine Metal Resources Ltd. was formed in 2006 with the primary purpose of exploring the Palmer 

Exploration Project. Constantine have completed a variety of exploration surveys and approximately 51,239 

m of diamond drilling in 131 holes to the end of 2017. This work has led to the discovery of the massive 

sulfide deposits at the South Wall and RW Zones at the Glacier Creek prospect area and the AG Zones in 

the Nunatak prospect area.  

A summary of previous exploration programs can be found in Table 6-5. 

Total cumulative diamond drilling by the Company is 60,200 m in 156 drill holes to the end of 2018. Total 

cumulative diamond drilling on the Project by all operators to the end of 2018 is 67,745 m in 193 drill holes 

(Table 6-6). 

Based on the encouraging exploration results to date, the Authors believe that continued delineation drilling 

is warranted and has the potential to increase the size of the known mineral resources laterally and to 

depth. There is also potential to discover additional mineralized zones within the greater Project area.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Palmer Project is underlain by a mafic-dominated, bimodal sequence of submarine volcanic rocks that 

host volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) mineralization. These rocks are part of a ~600-km-long, 

discontinuously exposed belt of Late Triassic, rift related volcanic and sedimentary rocks belonging to the 

Alexander Terrane. Throughout southeast Alaska and northwest British Columbia, the Alexander Terrane 

hosts numerous VMS occurrences, prospects and deposits, including the giant Windy Craggy deposit in 

British Columbia, and the precious metals-rich Greens Creek deposit in southeast Alaska (Taylor, 1997) 

(Figure 7-1). 

The Alexander Terrane (Figure 7-2) extends along the coast of northwest British Columbia northward 

through the Alaskan panhandle (southeast Alaska), through the Saint Elias Mountains of British Columbia 

and the Yukon, and westward into the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska (Wheeler and McFeely, 1991). The 

Alexander Terrane evolved along a convergent plate margin from the Precambrian-Cambrian to Early 

Devonian, with continuous deposition of arc-type igneous and sedimentary rocks (Gehrels and Berg, 1994). 

The latest Precambrian and early Paleozoic strata were subsequently deformed and metamorphosed 

during Middle Cambrian-Early Ordovician and Middle Silurian-earliest Devonian orogenies (Gehrels and 

Berg, 1994). During a period of relative tectonic stability from Middle Devonian to Early Permian, shallow 

marine carbonates, clastic rocks and mafic-intermediate volcanic rocks were deposited (Gehrels and 

Saleeby, 1987). Late Triassic rift-related volcanic and sedimentary rocks were deposited unconformably 

over the Permian and older rocks (Gehrels et al., 1986). Overprinting deformation and metamorphism 

occurred mainly throughout the mid-Jurassic to Cretaceous accretion of the Alexander Terrane to inboard 

Cordilleran terranes (Berg et al., 1972; Coney et al., 1980), with further dismemberment occurring along 

regional-scale right-lateral strike slip faulting during Tertiary to Recent time.

7.2 Property Geology 

The Project is underlain by Paleozoic and lower Mesozoic metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks that 

have been intruded locally by Cretaceous and Tertiary granitic plutons (Figure 7-3). Thin-bedded limestone 

and massive marble that contain fossils of Devonian to Carboniferous-age appear to be the oldest rocks in 

the area, and they are apparently conformably overlain by pelitic rocks of the Porcupine Slate, which are of 

probable Late Triassic age (Redman et al. 1985; MacKevett et al. 1974). The hosts to VMS mineralization 

at the Project, a dominantly mafic volcanic package, are the youngest stratified rocks in the area, and they 

are locally interbedded with rocks of the Porcupine Slate (Redman et al., 1985). The previously assumed

Late Triassic age of the mafic volcanic sequence was confirmed by microfossil data and U-Pb dating of 

volcanic rocks from the Glacier Creek prospect area (Green, 2001). Elsewhere in the Alexander terrane, 

an unconformity separates Late Triassic from Paleozoic rocks (Gehrels et al., 1986) but this has yet to be 

recognized on the Project. 

Figure 7-3: Geological Map of the Palmer Project. Modified from Redman et al. (1985) 

 
Source: Redman et al. (1985) 

The aforementioned Late Triassic rocks predominate on the Project and consist of massive to pillowed 

basalt, fragmental basalt, and possible andesite, with intercalations of calcareous siltstone and tuff, and 

rare rhyolite flows and dykes. Folding and faulting likely repeats stratigraphy and may in part be responsible 

for the broad distribution of exhalative mineralization and associated quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration across 

the Project. Alteration is commonly several hundred meters in extent and is of such strong intensity that 

discrimination of the protolith is difficult without the use of immobile element geochemistry. 

7.3 Metamorphism 

Late Triassic rocks on the Project have undergone lower to mid-greenschist facies regional metamorphism 

(Green et al., 2003). 

7.4 Structural Geology 

The rock units on the Project record at least three different episodes of deformation.

a. The earliest and most evident deformation event (D1) is a north-south contractional event 

characterized by a slatey to schistose cleavage (S1), which is likely axial planar to south-verging 

folds and thrust faults (Lewis, 1998). Fabric intensity is highly variable, reflecting the strong contrast 

in rheology between massive basalts and thin-bedded silty rocks comprising most of the section. 

In most places, preservation of primary rock textures is very good, although the rocks are locally 

deformed beyond recognition of the protolith. In general, the S1 fabric is most strongly developed 

within sedimentary strata and intensely altered volcanic rocks. Map-scale D1 folds have km-scale 

wavelengths, close to tight forms, and are commonly overturned. Outcrop-scale D1 folds are rare, 

and typically restricted to intercalations of sedimentary strata.  

b. The second phase of deformation (D2) is less readily observed and has no associated fabric. It is 

evidenced by map-scale folds that affect bedding and S1 foliation. The folds are generally tight and 

have sub-angular hinges with axes that plunge variably to the northwest. Although important at the 

property scale, the effects of the D2 deformation event are not apparent in the Glacier Creek 

prospect area.  

c. The D3 deformation is manifest by weakly developed north-easterly trending crenulation fabrics 

that are present locally within some of the more schistose rocks (Lewis, 1998). They are interpreted 

to post-date the D2 event because the orientation of the crenulation cleavage is independent of 

position on D2 folds. Regional strain associated with D3 is minor and does not appear to have 

produced any megascopic structures. 

In a regional structural context, the Project host rocks are correlative with the Hyd formation in central and 

southeastern Alaska (Loney, 1964; Gehrels et al. 1986), as well as with the informally named Tats group, 

exposed in the Saint Elias Mountains of British Columbia within fault bounded blocks to the northwest of 

the Project (MacIntyre, 1986; Mihalynuk et al., 1993). The Hyd formation hosts the Greens Creek deposit, 

and the Tats group hosts the Windy Craggy deposit. After restoration of 150 km of Tertiary dextral offset 

along the Chatham Strait – Denali fault system (Hudson et al., 1982), the Project would be located less 

than 50 km from the Greens Creek deposit, and perhaps not surprisingly, the two share similarities in their 

style of alteration and mineralization. 

7.5 Local Geology of the Glacier Creek Prospect 

The Glacier Creek prospect, host to the South Wall and RW Zones (collectively known as the Palmer 

deposit), is exposed on flanks of Mount Morlan (Figure 7-4, Figure 7-8, and Figure 7-9). The structure of 

Mount Morlan is that of a large, overturned, south verging anticline with an axial plane that dips moderately 

to the northeast. The stratigraphic section (Figure 7-5) is dominated by massive to pillowed basalt flows, 

with subordinate impure carbonate rocks, tuff, and felsic volcanic rocks. The rocks have undergone 

prolonged hydrothermal activity and host stacked zones of massive sulfide.  

7.5.1 Hanging Wall Units 

Younger, amygdaloidal, massive to pillowed and locally spherulitic basalts are considered the unaltered 

hanging wall sequence. These basalts can be differentiated chemically and also appear on the steeper 

South Wall limb.

7.5.2 Mineralized Horizon 

VMS mineralization at the RW zone is hosted by rhyolite while the massive sulfide unit at South Wall 

consists of stratiform massive barite and sulfide, and rare black shaley limestone.  

7.5.3 Footwall Units 

Feldspar-phyric basalt underlies the host rhyolite and the RW Zone. Intense alteration footwall obscures 

primary protolith stratigraphically below the South Wall Zones, although it appears to be similar to the 

footwall rocks to the RW Zone; the primary difference being that the stratigraphic footwall to the South Wall 

Zones, has a lower volume of feldspar-phyric rocks, a much greater proportion of fragmentals 

(volcaniclastic), and a higher percentage of aphyric basalt. The extent and intensity of quartz-sericite-pyrite 

alteration may be controlled by the permeability of the volcanic precursor, with volcaniclastic units likely 

being the focus of more widespread alteration. 

7.5.4 Structure 

Prospect-Scale Anticline – The large, overturned, northeast trending, south-verging anticline (the 

"Anticline") is the dominant feature of the Glacier Creek prospect area (Figure 7-6). The stratigraphy of the 

upright fold limb around the RW Zone is generally intact and has been relatively undisturbed by folding or 

faulting. The upper limb is upright, moderately northeast dipping, and host to RW Zone mineralization. The 

lower limb is overturned to sub-vertical, and is host to South Wall zone mineralization 

MZ Fault – A poorly constrained, shallow, prospect-scale thrust fault (termed the "MZ Fault" or "Main Zone 

Fault") with an orientation similar to the axial plane of the Anticline offsets the upper limb from the lower 

limb of the fold (Figure 7-6). Offset on the thrust is 'top to the south' with an estimated 300 m or less of 

displacement. A single, discrete, clearly defined structure representative of the thrust fault and that can be 

correlated from drill hole to drill hole has not been observed in the mineral resource area drilling; instead, 

the thrust fault appears to be manifest as a structural zone of variable thickness, characterized by a highly 

strained variety of feldspar-phyric basalt; referred to as 'FP Lentil' for its characteristic flattened and 

lenticular shaped feldspar phenocrysts.

Footwall Fault – The area between massive sulfide lenses within the South Wall Zones (subdivided as 

Zones I, II and III) is also complicated by structure. Recent work by Steeves (2013) strongly supports all 

three zones being located within the steep overturned lower limb of the prospect-scale anticline, and that 

the three zones are crudely time-stratigraphic equivalent. A moderate to steep north dipping, normal fault 

(termed the "Footwall Fault") is interpreted to offset Zone I from Zone II, which are believed to have originally 

been contiguous (Figure 7-6). An extension of this interpretation is that South Wall Zones I, II, III and EM 

Zone, and the RW Zones all represent, more or less, a single time/stratigraphic equivalent body of 

mineralization (Figure 7-7).  

Kudo Fault – The lower portion of the South Wall resource area has been offset by a major, steeply dipping, 

east-west striking fault system termed the "Kudo Fault". Displacement is interpreted to include both reverse, 

~180 m north-side up, and left-lateral, strike-slip, with movement interpreted to be on the order of ~350 m 

(Proffett, 2016, see Figure 7-6).

7.6 Local Geology of the Nunatak Prospect 

The Nunatak prospect area, host to the AG Zones, is located 3 km southwest from the South Wall zones, 

on a steep Nunatak between two branches of the Saksaia Glacier. The area is underlain by a folded 

sequence of bimodal volcanic flows, fragmental volcanic units, volcaniclastics, tuffs, and limey argillites and 

siltstone (Figure 7-10, Figure 7-11, Figure 7-13, and Figure 7-12).  

VMS mineralization, mainly massive barite beds with variable base and precious metal mineralization 

hosted in sphalerite, galena and sulfosalts, outcrops in several places on the north-northwestern flanks of 

the mountainside. The eastern aspect of the slopes at the "Jag" showing includes an outcrop of barite and 

massive galena with sphalerite. Talus and glaciers cover a large portion of the prospect area and limits the 

ability to confidently demonstrate continuity of the mineral horizons between outcrops, creating the potential 

for differing geological interpretations. Nevertheless, it is clear that exhalative mineralization along this 

horizon is widespread both on surface and at depth, and also attains significant width.  

7.6.1 Hanging Wall Units 

The immediate hanging wall to AG Zones mineralized horizon is a thick sequence of mafic volcaniclastics 

and coherent massive, pillowed and amygdaloidal basalts with local jasper beds/lenses. A distinct 

spherulitic basalt unit is also observed above the mineralized zone in places but is also observed within 

and below the mineralized zone. These mafic volcanic rocks are, in turn, overlain by mixed sedimentary 

rocks (limestone and siltstone) and mafic tuffs that are intruded by abundant dykes of various compositions. 

Faulted and folded limey argillites overlie the mixed sedimentary package. 

7.6.2 Mineralized Horizon 

The AG Zones are spatially associated with rhyolite and is hosted within a folded and faulted, steeply 

dipping exhalative chert-barite horizon and that is stratigraphically underlain by a massive pyrite-rich sulfide 

zone and an extensive discordant sulfide stringer zone. The AG Zones consists of two major components:  

 An upper, Ag+Au-rich folded barite bed defined by a tight synform and antiform pair with fold axial 

traces trending WNW-ESE (supported by both surface mapping and drilling). The large-scale 

anticline is defined by an upright, moderately SW dipping south limb and an overturned steeply SW 

dipping north limb. This upper stratigraphy is interpreted to be displaced from the lower zone by a 

shallow, normal, listric fault (dubbed 'McFault') and  

 A lower, sheet-like, Zn-rich baritic core that is slightly warped (by probable broad D2 folds) and dips 

steeply back and forth towards the NE and SW. The mineralization is stratigraphically underlain by 

a massive pyrite-rich sulfide zone and an extensive discordant Zn-Pb-rich stringer zone.

The immediate hanging wall to the mineralized horizon is dominated by mafic volcaniclastics that are locally 

altered to a distinct assemblage of quartz-sericite-magnetite+/-chlorite+/-iron-carbonate+/-jasper (referred 

to as "QSM"). This package of intense QSM alteration also occurs between what is interpreted as two 

separate stratigraphic units of mineralization.  

7.6.3 Footwall Units 

The footwall sequence is composed of fragmental to coherent strongly quartz-sericite-pyrite (QSP) altered 

rhyolites, minor exhalative chert deposits, and a thick sequence of variably QSP-chlorite altered 

heterogeneous basaltic flows that have textures ranging from massive to pillowed, amygdaloidal, 

spherulitic, and brecciated. The volcanics were geochemically identified as tholeiitic to calc- alkaline 

bimodal volcanic flows (Doherty, 2018). Massive to pillowed and amygdaloidal basalt is dominant in outcrop 

in the southern part of the map area and is interpreted as the footwall to the mineralized horizon. The 

footwall alteration has a large surface footprint of ~500 x 200m.  

7.6.4 Structure 

Two-fold generations are observed. F1 folds are the most easily visible in outcrop and have amplitudes 

ranging from several metres to tens of metres, with small parasitic folds with amplitudes of tens of 

centimetres. F1 folds are parasitic folds on the north-facing limb of a north-closing synform with the hinge 

interpreted to occur below the Saksaia glacier to the north and stratigraphy is repeated around the CAP 

prospect on the other limb of the synform. F1 folds are refolded by open F2 folds with poorly understood,

N-NW trending fold axial traces. Fold interference and faulting complicates mapping and correlation of 

surface geology to drill holes. 

Upper Zone - The dominant structural style of the upper zone consists of tight folds with fold axial traces 

trending WNW-ESE and folds plunging to the ESE. Distribution of rock units is dominated by a large-scale 

anticline defined by an upright, moderately SW dipping south limb and an overturned, steeply SW dipping 

north limb. Synclines are mapped to the south and north of the anticline. Small scale parasitic folds are also 

inferred based on mapped distribution of rock units and bedding measurements. A second phase of 

deformation (noted to be manifested in a macroscale and NNW trending in R. Greig's 2014 mapping), may 

be the cause of further deformation/warping of the stratigraphy in the map area. 

Lower Zone - The lower zone is steeply dipping, well zoned, and comprises a large majority of the drill 

defined extent of the AG Zone deposit. The zone has a northwesterly trend (~310-320 deg Az) and a dip 

that changes orientation along strike, presumably the result of a second deformation event. The northwest 

half of the zone is sub-vertical to locally overturned with a southwest dip, whereas the southeast half is 

upright with a moderate to steep dip to the northeast. To date, the thickest and best developed 

mineralization is defined in the southeast from holes drilled in 2018.  

7.6.5 Alteration 

Footwall alteration at the AG Zone deposit is similar to the Palmer deposit, dominated by sericite-pyrite-

quartz alteration increasing in intensity towards mineralization. Hanging wall alteration is typified by 

magnetite, jasper, Fe-carbonate, minor chlorite, and locally sericite alteration up to tens of meters above 

mineralization.

7.7 VMS Mineralization  

The Project hosts two known volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits, the Palmer deposit, which 

consists of the South Wall and RW Zones, and the newly discovered AG Zone deposit located 3 km to the 

southwest. Numerous other mineralized prospects are also present throughout the property. The various 

prospects and deposits share similar alteration and mineralogical characteristics, suggesting a large-scale, 

property-wide Late Triassic mineralizing event with multiple hydrothermal vent centers. 

South Wall and RW Zone mineralization is the best studied, and a summation of principal mineralization 

styles, metal zonation and alteration can be found below. A more detailed description can be found in the 

Master of Science thesis completed on the Glacier Creek prospect by Nathan Steeves (2013). Descriptions 

of the regional mineral prospects on the Project can be found in the NI 43-101 technical report by Greig 

and Giroux (2010). 

Six mineralization styles have been identified and are grouped according to dominant mineral assemblages 

and texture (Figure 7-14, Table 7-1, and Table 7-2). More details can be found in Gray and Cunningham-

Dunlop (2015).

Figure 7-14: Principal Mineralization Styles with Typical VMS Lens 

 
Source: Constantine (2018) 

7.7.1 Barite Mineralization (Zn-rich) 

Barite-rich ores contain abundant pale honey-brown, low-Fe sphalerite with variable amounts of pyrite, 

locally minor galena, tetrahedrite, arsenopyrite and variable concentrations of late chalcopyrite. Barite ores 

contain >50% barite and 30-50% sulfides and resemble some types of "black ore" in the Kuroko deposits 

(Eldridge et al., 1983). Barite is the dominant gangue mineral. Compositional bands dominated by either 

barite, sphalerite, pyrite or chalcopyrite occur locally. This compositional banding is likely primary, by 

comparison with Kuroko analogs, but may have been enhanced by deformation. The Barite-rich mineralized 

rock grades locally into massive pyrite mineralized rock as sulfide content increases and quartz becomes 

the dominant gangue. Barite mineralized rock also grades into a barite-carbonate mineralized rock at the 

upper limits and flanks of South Zones I, II and III, with carbonate increasing in abundance at the margins 

of the lens. 

7.7.2 Massive Pyrite Mineralization (Cu-rich) 

Massive pyrite mineralization typically occupies the core of the lens and is dominant in SW Zone I and parts 

of SW Zones II and III. They are classified as having >50% sulfide content, typically as pyrite and 

chalcopyrite with lesser sphalerite and associated minor quartz and/or barite gangue. These ores resemble 

the 'yellow ore' of the Kuroko deposits (Eldridge et al., 1983). The massive pyrite ores commonly exhibit 

compositional banding with variable amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite. They also show fine-grained, 

dispersed pyrite followed by later, coarser, anhedral pyrite-with remobilized intergranular chalcopyrite or 

sphalerite. 

7.7.3 Semi-massive and Stringer-style Mineralization 

Semi-massive and stringer-style pyrite ± sphalerite ± chalcopyrite zones stratigraphically underlie and form 

the feeder-zones to massive sulfide mineralization. They consist of 30-50 vol.% and 15-30 vol.% sulfide, 

respectively. Pyrite grains occur as very fine disseminated grains and as coarser grains within stringers. 

Sphalerite and chalcopyrite are also disseminated with pyrite and within stringers. Locally, stratigraphically

below SW Zone I/II/III massive sulfide mineralization and within the alteration zone, stringer-style 

mineralization is dominated by pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite, rather than pyrite-sphalerite. This facies is 

characterized by <50 vol.% sulfides as stringer-style and stockwork veins and >50 vol.% gangue of quartz 

and muscovite. The chalcopyrite content ranges from 3 to 15 vol.%, with pyrrhotite content up to 40 vol.%. 

Trace sphalerite is present in most samples as dark red, anhedral grains.  

7.7.4 Massive Pyrrhotite Ore 

Massive pyrrhotite ores occur both above and below massive pyrite ores and barite ores (Figure 7-14) 

within SW Zones I and II, and generally represents a volumetrically small portion of mineralized zones. 

They contain >50 vol.% sulfide with up to 15 vol.% chalcopyrite, up to 20 vol.% sphalerite and <1 vol.% 

pyrite. Chalcopyrite and sphalerite occur within massive pyrrhotite and in fractures in pyrrhotite. The 

dominant gangue minerals are quartz and carbonate with minor very fine-grained muscovite. Trace 

hematite and rare molybdenite are present within muscovite-rich patches cross-cutting quartz and sulfide 

grains. 

7.7.5 Carbonate Ore 

Carbonate-rich ores are found at the stratigraphic top of SW Zone I. Carbonate ores typically contain 60 

vol.% coarse-grained carbonate, with minor quartz, muscovite and dark green chlorite, up to 35 vol.% dark 

red-burgundy sphalerite and up to 5 vol.% chalcopyrite. Trace amounts of partially replaced (Ba-K) feldspar 

are also observed. More massive carbonate contains relatively coarse, subhedral to euhedral, interlocking 

crystals of calcite (up to 3 mm). Late chalcopyrite stringers cross-cut carbonate as thin veinlets, and 

sphalerite is disseminated throughout, locally as relatively coarse anhedral to euhedral grains (up to 1 mm) 

forming aggregates. These rocks appear to be highly recrystallized. 

7.7.6 Barite-Carbonate Mineralization (Tuffaceous and Re-sedimented) 

At the margins of SW Zone I and SW Zone II and to a lesser extent in SW Zone III, there is a mix of 

carbonate-rich and sulfide-rich mineralization. These include a finely-layered barite-carbonate-sulfide 

facies, some sulfide-clast and barite crystal-rich facies, and a variably mineralized tuffaceous and cherty 

facies. Barite mineralized rock grades outward into a barite-carbonate mineralized rock as the disseminated 

carbonate content increases and gradually becomes more tuffaceous, with interlayered barite and 

carbonate laminae.  

Above this unit is a weakly mineralized, barite-free tuffaceous horizon. This capping tuffaceous horizon 

overlies the entire lens and is characterized by weak mineralization, (Ba-K)-feldspar, barian muscovite, 

local albite, cherty patches/layers and is strongly calcaerous. It is intercalated with cherts and altered 

volcaniclastics and may continue laterally along the mineral horizon. Cherts and tuffaceous units above SW 

Zones I and II are locally cross-cut by thin pyrite ± sphalerite stringers containing quartz, carbonate, albite 

and muscovite, which is suggestive of continued hydrothermal activity after to the deposition of each lens. 

Tuffaceous units locally contain chalcopyrite, possibly as replacement of amygdules and/or feldspars and 

sphalerite. 

Locally within SW Zone II, the barite-carbonate mineralized rock has a distinctive clastic texture. These 

rocks contain euhedral, and locally broken, barite crystals and clasts of massive barite, sulfide and/or quartz 

within a very fine-grain carbonate matrix. Massive barite clasts are irregular, angular and can reach up to 1 

cm across. Other minerals include minor to trace albite, muscovite and chlorite. Sulfides are dominantly

pyrite and pale honey-brown sphalerite, with minor to trace chalcopyrite, galena, tetrahedrite, and 

arsenopyrite. Chalcopyrite typically replaces pyrite, which is framboidal and less recrystallized than in the 

main massive sulfide lenses. The clastic nature of this facies and the abundant broken crystals of barite 

suggest that this material was re-sedimented.

7.8 VMS Metal Zonation 

Massive sulfide lenses SWZII and SWZIII exhibit typical, vertical metal zonation, with Cu-rich zones 

underlying Zn-rich zones and zones elevated in Pb. SWZI is the exception with generally Cu-rich 

mineralization at the tops of the drill holes and Zn and Pb enrichment at the bottom, suggesting that the 

lens is overturned (Steeves, 2013). 

The RW Zone (both East and West zones) show unequivocal metal zonation (i.e., Cu below Zn below Pb, 

with a deeper stringer zone). The RW Zone is spatially associated with a large rhyolite body and may 

represent a more proximal setting during deposition. Massive sulfides have been intersected both above 

and below the rhyolite unit. This contrasts with the clastic-associated, locally re-sedimented SWZI, SWZII 

and SZWIII mineralized intersections, which may have formed in topographic lows or on the flanks of the 

volcanic center. 

No large, significant, pipe-like feeder zone has been discovered at the deposit to date. This may be due to 

a lack of focused, high temperature hydrothermal up-flow through the permeable volcaniclastic rocks, that 

host SWZII and SWZIII (and part of SWZI) or transposition of originally discordant stringer networks 

(Steeves, 2013). Local, small stringer zones have been intersected below the RW Zone and SWZI, within 

more competent feldspar-phyric basalts and further exploration may reveal more feeder-style mineralization 

and the roots to the system.  

7.9 VMS Alteration 

Four alteration facies are associated with the mineralized zones; Quartz-Pyrite, Muscovite, Carbonate-

Chlorite, and Epidote (Table 7-3). The laterally extensive alteration zone is typical of VMS deposits with 

permeable volcaniclastic footwalls (Franklin et al., 2005; Large et al., 2001c).  

7.9.1 Quartz-Pyrite Facies 

Quartz-pyrite facies occurs immediately below massive sulfide mineralization, and forms partially 

transposed feeder zones to the mineralized lenses. Quartz is extensively recrystallized and forms 

polygonal, granoblastic texture of varying grain size. Directly underlying the center of SWZI, this quartz-

pyrite dominated assemblage contains minor chlorite associated with stringers. The quartz-pyrite facies 

likely grades into the pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite stringer zone underlying SWZI. 

7.9.2 Muscovite Facies 

The dominant footwall facies is a muscovite>quartz+pyrite assemblage which forms a large alteration zone 

referred to as QSP (quartz-sericite-pyrite) schist. In general, alteration intensity increases towards ore. 

Muscovites throughout the deposit are barium-rich and will be discussed below. Rocks show a simple 

mineralogy and, in strongly altered zones, have lost nearly all primary textures. Within weakly altered 

feldspar-phyric basalts, muscovite selectively replaces the igneous feldspar. In the moderately altered 

volcaniclastic rocks, muscovite replaces the matrix or clasts. Locally quartz alteration may also be selective, 

replacing clasts, amygdules or matrix material. 

7.9.3 Carbonate-Chlorite Facies  

Moderately altered rocks containing minor carbonate ± chlorite (up to 10 vol.%) form a stratabound 

alteration facies 20-40 m below SWZII and just below SWZIII massive sulfide lenses. This facies is also

observed locally below SWZI. Carbonate and chlorite are also found enveloping massive sulfide lenses 

where the rocks are thought to be tuffaceous. This carbonate alteration may be from an earlier alteration 

phase or even diagenesis of the volcanic precursor.  

7.9.4 Epidote Facies  

Stratigraphically below the mineralized zones (>100 m), muscovite+quartz+pyrite alteration grades into an 

epidote+muscovite+quartz+pyrite/pyrrhotite alteration facies. The least altered volcanic rocks typically have 

a greenschist facies metamorphic mineral assemblage of chlorite, carbonate, feldspar and locally minor 

quartz and epidote. These least altered rocks are typically relatively calcareous, magnetic and are cut by 

numerous thin calcite veinlets.  

Alteration zonation, except for weakly transposed quartz-pyrite facies 'conduits', appears to be parallel 

stratigraphy and may outline previous lithologies (Steeves, 2013).

7.10 Principal Mineralized Zones 

The Palmer deposit (or main area) consists of six distinctive zones (lenses) of strataform massive sulfide-

sulfate. South Wall Zones I, II-III and EM lenses, located on the south-facing, steeply dipping limb of 

megascopic, deposit-scale anticline, disrupted by significant faulting, are referred to as the 'South Wall' 

(Figure 7-15). The RW Zones, which includes RW East, RW West, and RW Oxide, are located on the north-

facing, gently dipping upper limb. The RW Oxide Zone is the near surface equivalent of the RW East Zone 

where sulfide minerals of massive barite-sulfide mineralization have been oxidized and leached, depleting 

the zone of copper and zinc and enriching the silver and gold grades.

7.10.1 South Wall Zones 

Drilling to date at South Wall has defined four zones of VMS-style mineralization with a total plunge length 

of ~ 700 m and the total strike length ~ 550 m. All four zones are open to expansion along strike, and both 

up and down dip. 

South Wall Zone I (SWZI) occurs at the up-dip, overturned, edge of the South Wall and consists of a single 

tabular lens of massive sulfide. SWZI is interpreted to be offset from stratigraphically correlative 

mineralization in South Wall Zone II ("WZII) and South Wall Zone III (SWZIII) by normal displacement along 

the high angle 'footwall fault'. Exhalative mineralization occurs at more than one stratigraphic level within a

section that measures 40 to 80 m in thickness. SWZIII is located at the stratigraphic top near the contact 

with overlying argillite, whereas SWZII is stratigraphically lower and is generally the thicker and better 

developed of the two. In places, the two zones merge or coalesce into a single sulfide body. This feature 

occurs up-dip toward SWZI and may reflect proximity to the axis or core of the mineralizing system. South 

Wall EM Zone (SWEMZ) is located down-dip of SWZII and SWZIII and based on additional drilling in 2017 

is now demonstrated to be contiguous with them. Like SWZII and SWZIII, the SWEMZ includes an upper 

and lower exhalative horizon. In one drill hole (CMR14-65), replacement and stringer-like sulfide 

mineralization links the upper and lower massive sulfide lenses to produce a continuous zone of 

mineralization with a true width of 65 to 75 m. Continuity of mineralization is good between drill holes, which 

are generally spaced 50 to 100 m apart.  

Details of the SW Zones are given below and shown in Figure 7-16, Source: Constantine (2018) 

Figure 7-17 and Figure 7-19, and Figure 7-20. A typical cross-section is shown in Figure 7-19. 

 SWZ1  

South Wall Zone I outcrops for over 120 m along the southern slope of Mt. Morlan where it is largely oxidized 

and leached of sulfide (Greig and Giroux, 2010). The massive sulfide lens is located at the core of the 

deposit-scale anticline and appears to be bound above and below by faults (thrust fault above, footwall fault 

below). SWZI has an approximate maximum true thickness of 30 m, dip length of 220 m, and strike length 

350 m (based on resource wireframes). It is composed mainly of massive pyrite (Py>Cpy>Qtz), semi-

massive pyrite (Py>Qtz>Cpy-Sph) and massive to layered barite mineralization (Brt>Sph~Py>Cpy). 

Pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite and pyrite±sphalerite stringers overlie and underlie massive pyrite and barite ores. 

Cherty, tuffaceous, or carbonate-rich ores presently underlie the massive ores, supporting the interpretation 

that SWZI is overturned and on the south-facing limb of the anticline. 

 SWZII / SWZIII 

South Wall Zone II-III outcrops discontinuously for over 100 m as a 2-3 m thick, leached, stratiform massive 

barite-sulfide and chert horizon (Greig and Giroux, 2010). SWZII-III have an approximate combined 

maximum true thickness of 24 m, dip length of 350, and strike length of 425 m (based on resource 

wireframes). Most of SWZII and SWZIII consists of massive, mineralized barite ore, with thin mineralized 

chert and carbonate horizons stratigraphically above and below. SWZIII also contains significant re-

sedimented barite-sulfide mineralization, like that seen in several Kuroko-style deposits in Japan (Eldridge 

et al., 1983). 

 SWEMZ  

South Wall EM Zone has a more moderate dip than the overlying steeply dipping SWZII and SWZIII, which 

may suggest the presence of a synclinal hinge to the south. SWEMZ has an approximate maximum true 

thickness of 74 m, dip length of 250 m, and strike length 370 m (based on resource wireframes). SW EMZ 

is composed of most of the same mineralization as those present in SWZI, SWZII and SWZIII, and includes 

both lateral and vertical mineral zonation within the massive sulfide lenses. A well-developed copper-rich 

footwall stringer zone has yet to be defined at SW EMZ. The down-dip edge of SW EMZ is truncated by a 

high angle north dipping reverse fault referred to as the Kudo fault. Apparent vertical offset of approximately 

200 m is estimated for the fault, and a component of left-lateral strike-slip displacement is also interpreted. 

Strong QSP alteration and lower grade mineralization (e.g. 7.3 m @ 0.43% copper and 0.46% zinc in hole

CMR15-69) has been identified on the south side of the Kudo fault, suggesting potential for continuation of 

the South Wall zone.  

Mineralogy 

Primary mineralogy of the South Wall Zones consists of barite, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, quartz, and 

galena, with lesser calcite, magnetite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, chalcocite, tetrahedrite and tenantite. Typical 

zoning consists of copper-rich massive pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization grading laterally and vertically 

outwards into zinc dominant barite-sphalerite-pyrite +/- chalcopyrite mineralization. Further outward, 

mineralization locally grades into massive carbonate-sphalerite or variably precious-metal enriched low 

sulfide chert-barite mineralization. Other types of mineralization include copper-rich pyrite and/or pyrrhotite 

stockwork, and massive pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite. Continuity of mineralization is good between drill holes, 

which are generally spaced 50 to 100 metres apart. All three zones are open to expansion along strike, and 

both up and down dip.

7.10.2 RW Zones 

The RW Zone, on the upright limb of the prospect-scale anticline, was the initial massive sulfide lens 

discovered at Glacier Creek. The RW Zone outcrops discontinuously along both the western and southern 

faces of Mt. Morlan. A coherent rhyolite flow is associated with RW Zone mineralization. Exhalative massive 

barite-sulfide occurs at both the upper and lower contact of the rhyolite, with RW West predominantly 

overlying the rhyolite and RW East predominantly underlying the rhyolite or occurring east of where the 

rhyolite pinches out. The western and eastern sections of the RW Zone have been partially defined and 

traced to within approximately 100 m of one another but have yet to be demonstrated to be contiguous by 

drill holes. A large portion of the eastern section, the RW Oxide Zone, has been oxidized and leached of 

much of its sulfide content. The mineralized zone grades laterally and vertically into tuffaceous and 

argillaceous rocks, much like the other lenses (Green, 2001).  

Details of the various RW Zones are given below and shown in Figure 7-16, Figure 7-17, Source: 

Constantine (2018)

 RW Zone West 

RW Zone West has an approximate maximum true thickness of 6 m, a strike length of 375 m, and a dip 

length of 325 m (based on resource wireframes). It remains open both up and down dip, and along strike. 

 RW Zone East 

The RW East Zone has an approximate maximum true thickness of 11 m, a strike length of 150 m, and a 

dip length of 165 m (based on resource wireframes). It remains open along strike and down-dip. Notably, 

the area between the RW East and the RW West Zones is untested except for one hole (RMC99-14) that 

intersected 25.2 m of stockwork mineralization @ 0.52% copper and 0.40% zinc. 

 RW Oxide Zone 

The RW Oxide Zone transitions to oxide facies mineralization to the south and east consisting of vuggy, 

porous silica-barite rock in which primary sulfide minerals have been oxidized and largely leached away in 

the near surface environment. It has an approximate true thickness of 24 m, a strike length of 190 m, and 

a dip length of 260 m. Oxidized parts of the RW Zone typically contain negligible copper and zinc, whereas 

lead, gold, and silver grades remain similar or higher than those of non-oxidized parts. Locally, remnant 

blocks or lenses of weakly oxidized to unoxidized RW zone sulfide mineralization are also present. 

 RW Zone Surface Occurrences 

Well exposed on the west side of Mt. Morlan at the Little Jarvis occurrence, where it can be traced 

discontinuously along the slope for about 50 m, varying in thickness from 4-5 m to a few tens of cm. On the 

southeast side of Mt. Morlan, the RW Zone is exposed at the Upper Main and UMP (Upper Merrill Palmer) 

occurrences, as well as in local exposures in between.  

 Mineralogy 

The primary (hypogene) mineralogy of the RW Zone consists of relatively coarse-grained barite, sphalerite, 

pyrite, chalcopyrite, quartz, and galena, with lesser calcite, magnetite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, tetrahedrite 

and tenantite. Overall character of the mineralization is like the South Wall Zones. Exhalative chert is 

common distal to massive barite-sulfide.

7.10.3 AG Zones 

 Introduction 

The AG Zone deposit is located three km southwest from the Palmer deposit on the north and northwestern 

flanks of a steep Nunatak between the Saksaia and South Saksaia Glaciers (aka the Nunatak Prospect 

Area). Drilling to date has defined a combined total strike length of ~ 550 m within two zones and a vertical 

dip length of 250 m. 

The Nunatak Prospect Area was drilled for the first time in 2017 and targeted the downdip extension of the 

exposed barite beds while drilling across an interpreted anticline-syncline fold pair to test for possible 

repetition of the mineralized zone. The drilling was highly successful with the upper sections of initial drill 

holes intersecting gold- and silver-rich beds of massive barite within an area referred to as the Upper Zone. 

The Upper Zone consists of a folded massive barite+/-sulfide bed(s) that is structurally offset along a 

shallow angle (~35o) normal fault, north-side down, from a steeply dipping, relatively planar zone of 

mineralization at depth. 

Deeper sections of initial drill holes, and subsequent drilling thereafter has defined the main body of 

mineralization at AG Zone deposit. It consists of strataform massive barite-sulfide, the AG Main Lens, and 

feeder-style replacement and stringer mineralization in the stratigraphic footwall referred to as the AG 

Footwall Zinc Zone. 

Details of the various zones are given below and shown in Figure 7-16, Figure 7-17, and Figure 7-18. A 

typical cross-section is shown in Figure 7-23. An aerial view of the AG Zone deposit appears in Figure 7-24.  

 AG Main Lens 

The AG Main Lens has a drill defined strike length of approximately 500 m, vertical extent of approximately 

400 m, maximum true thickness of approximately 35 m, and remains open to expansion in most directions 

(all dimensions as defined by 3D resource wireframes). The zone has a northwesterly trend (~310-320 deg 

Az) and a dip that changes orientation along strike, presumably the result of a second deformation event. 

The northwest half of the zone is sub-vertical to locally overturned with a southwest dip, whereas the 

southeast half is upright with a moderate to steep dip to the northeast. To date, the thickest and best 

developed mineralization is defined in the southeast from holes drilled in 2018. Mineralization is stratiform 

and varies from silver-rich massive barite to zinc-lead rich massive sulfide, with both vertical and lateral 

zonation between these two end members. 

 AG Footwall Zinc Zone 

The AG Footwall Zinc Zone has a drill defined strike length of approximately 365 m, vertical extent of 

approximately 315 m and maximum true thickness of approximately 14 m. It is located 5 to 40 m 

stratigraphically below the AG Main Lens and has the same general trend and orientation (320 deg Az and 

80 deg dip north). The Footwall Zinc Zone is typically zinc +/- lead rich, with significantly lower grade 

precious metals than observed in the AG Main Lens. Mineralization is characterized by veins, irregular 

seams and patches, and what appears to be replacement of a volcaniclastic protolith.

 Mineralogy 

Primary mineralogy of the AG Zone deposit includes zinc occurring in low-Fe sphalerite, lead within galena 

and within the sulfate anglesite, silver predominantly in tetrahedrite-tennantite and in the rare lead-silver-

antimony sulfosalt, diaphorite, lesser copper in chalcopyrite and rare gold in discrete grains of electrum. 

Barite is abundant in the AG Main Lens and locally as stringers and patches in the footwall. Pyrite is 

common but occurs in significantly lower concentration than barite within the AG Main Lens. Doherty (2018) 

noted that nearly all sulfide phases in the AG Zone deposit were fully recrystallized during regional 

greenschist metamorphism, which resulted in coarsening of grain sizes and the simplification of mineral 

boundaries.  

 Alteration 

Footwall alteration at AG Zone deposit is similar to the Palmer deposit, dominated by sericite-pyrite-quartz 

alteration increasing in intensity towards mineralization. Hanging wall alteration is typified by magnetite, 

jasper, Fe-carbonate, minor chlorite, and locally sericite alteration up to tens of meters above mineralization.

The Project hosts a significant number of regional mineralized prospects, six of which (Cap, HG, MHC, 

Boundary, Red Creek, and Gullies are shown in Figure 7-25 and described briefly below. Only two of the 

prospects, Cap and MHC, have been tested with drilling.

The Cap prospect is a silver-rich, barite-dominated system that contains locally elevated concentrations of 

zinc, lead, and gold. Base and precious metal mineralization is hosted within veined and brecciated, 

intensely QSP altered basalt, which is in turn "capped" by a bed of massive pyritic barite.  

The target includes an upper horizon composed of several 5-8 m thick beds of Ag-rich, variably pyritic 

massive barite within brecciated and veined QSP. Sample highlights include 23.2 m @ 134 g/t Ag in hole 

CAP01, 90.6 m @ 31 g/t Ag in hole RMC98-01, a surface grab sample of 1,828 g/t Ag, 11.2 g/t Au and 

0.83%, and a 5.5 m continuous channel sample averaging 265 g/t Ag and 0.27% Zn. The upper horizon 

mineralization is open down-dip of the horizon to the northwest and north-northwest. A deeper, less-

understood, stratabound horizon of semi-massive to massive sulfide bands/veins hosted within intensely 

siliceous and altered amygdaloidal basalt returned the highest base metal values along with elevated 

precious metal values (1.9 m @ 3.75% Zn, 1.91% Pb, 92.1 g/t Ag, 0.47 g/t Au in hole CMR07-04). The 

lower horizon mineralization is open to the west.  

Regionally, the CAP stratigraphy is postulated to be on the southwestern limb of a regional-scale synform, 

which may connect the mineralized horizon at CAP with the mineralized, discontinuous sulfide-bearing 

barite lenses exposed in QSP-altered rocks at HG.  

The Cap prospect was drilled by Newmont in 1988, by Rubicon in 1998, and the Company in 2016-2017, 

with the best intercept containing 23.2 m @ 134 g/t Ag, in hole CAP-01, within massive pyritic barite and 

baritic breccia. Both surface and drill data suggest that the hydrothermal system is diminishing in strength 

along strike to the northeast, but down-dip and to the southwest (below the ice), it maintains its intensity 

and has been only partially tested with drilling. 

7.11.2 Hanging Glacier ("HG") Occurrence 

The HG occurrence, located 2 km southwest of the Glacier Creek Prospect, consists of discontinuous 

sulfide-bearing barite lenses up to a few metres thick over 610 m strike length. The mineral horizon dips 

steeply to the north within the overturned northern limb of a large-scale syncline. Mineralization occurs 

stratigraphically above an extensive zone of strong QSP +/- chlorite alteration and is overlain by calcareous 

siltstone and black, slatey limestone and interbedded pillow basalt flows and associated fragmental units. 

Grab samples contain up to 0.36% Cu, 14.1% Zn, 2.3% Pb, 198.9 ppm Ag, and 1.58 ppm Au (Still et al., 

1991). No drilling has been completed at HG.  

The west-northwest extension of the HG alteration zone projects beneath the glacier in the direction of the 

Mt. Henry Clay Prospect, located 2 km away. Results from the 2017 Airborne EM survey show a large 

conductive response under the ice in this same area (HG West) which warrants follow-up. 

The HG occurrence is interpreted to be stratigraphically equivalent to the CAP prospect on the southern 

limb of the same regional syncline, located 1100m to the south and 700m lower in elevation. A large area 

of the target mineral horizon is preserved in the syncline between HG and CAP (estimated at +2000m of 

dip length and +2000m of strike). The majority of this key stratigraphy is accessible to exploration with 

moderate length holes. If an interpretation of normal offset on the Kudo fault system is assumed, then the 

HG mineral horizon may also be stratigraphically equivalent to the South Wall – RW zones and is perhaps 

the fault displaced down plunge continuation of the South Wall system.

7.11.3 Mount Henry Clay ("MHC") Prospect 

High-grade massive sulfide boulders were discovered by prospector Merrill Palmer at the base of a 

stranded glacier at the Mt. Henry Clay Prospect in 1983. The average grade of several types of boulders, 

as sampled by the United States Bureau of Mines (USBM) (Still, 1984), are as follows: 

 26 Boulders of Barite-sulfide (zinc-rich):  

o 1% Cu, 0.4% Pb, 19.3% Zn, 38.2 g/t Ag, 0.22 g/t Au, and 20.6% Ba 

o 33% Zn, 2.5% Cu, and 5% Ba from a 6.0 ft (1.83 m) chip of the largest boulder. 

 4 Boulders of massive pyrite and chalcopyrite:  

o 5.18% Cu, 0.03% Pb, 1.00% Zn, 44.1 g/t Ag, tr. Au, and 0.12% Ba 

 6 Boulders of mineralized volcanic host rocks (lacking barite):  

o 2.83% Cu, 0.02 % Pb, 3.90% Zn, tr Au, 9.8 g/t Ag, and 0.41% Ba. 

 The mean grade of all the boulders sampled by the USBM:  

o 18.5% Zn, 0.87% Cu, 1.3 oz/ton Ag, 0.02 oz/ton Au, and 5.9% Ba 

The MHC mineralization appears to be comprised of primary sphalerite, chalcopyrite, barite, and pyrite with 

minor late stage galena, tetrahedrite, native silver, and quartz-carbonate gangue. Two principle styles of 

mineralization occur on the prospect: (1) stratiform Zn-Cu-Ba {sphalerite, chalcopyrite, barite), and (2) 

stringer (feeder zone) chalcopyrite. MHC is associated with thin intercalated beds of volcanic flows, 

carbonates, and elastic rocks and conglomeratic textures are frequently observed in the sulfide boulders.  

The MHC massive sulfide target has not been located in outcrop although the high-grade Zn-Cu-rich and 

precious metals-enriched massive sulfide boulders found scattered along the margins and near the 

terminus of the MHC glacier suggest a source beneath the glacier. Thirteen (13) holes for a total of 2,957 

m; seven holes by Kennecott Exploration, four holes by Granges Exploration Ltd, and two holes by Rubicon 

Minerals Corporation. The drilling identified two mineralized horizons beneath the MHC Glacier but did not 

intersect mineralization with grades equivalent to those in the boulders. Several holes did intersect lower-

grade mineralization within broad pyrite-sericite alteration zones, including 49.1 m @ 0.19% Cu in hole 

K85-3, 10.7 m @ 0.44% Cu in hole K84-2, and 36.6 m @ 0.29% Cu in hole G89-9 (Still et al., 1991 and 

Rubicon, 1998). Annually retreating ice led to a discovery by Rubicon Minerals Corporation of an intensely 

foliated chlorite-sericite ~alteration zone containing pyrite-chalcopyrite stockwork veins that was dubbed 

the 'P2' zone. It is speculated that the P2 zone may represent footwall feeder mineralization and alteration 

to the horizon from which the high-grade boulders were sourced (Bull, 1998). As ice continues to retreat, 

high-grade boulders appear to be vectoring back towards their bedrock source. Results from the Company's 

2017 MHC subglacial sampling program showed a distinct anomalous Zn trend and a potential sub-ice 

sulfide source in the vicinity of borehole BH13. Further work was recommended to target this area.  

7.11.4 Boundary Occurrence 

The Boundary target is defined by mineralized boulders, favourable stratigraphy including the thickest bed 

of rhyolite on the Palmer property, the presence of chalcopyrite-stringers and anomalous barium in outcrop, 

altered volcanics, and EM anomalies at depth (Figure 7-27).

Page 7-38 

 

The Boundary prospect is exposed as a ridge of outcrop in a large ice field near the international border. It 

consists of chalcopyrite mineralization and anomalous barium within quartz-sericite-pyrite schist and 

rhyolite that is intermittently exposed over a distance of 2-3 km. A marker bed of iron-stained meta-

sediments (phyllite, pelitic schist, argillaceous sediments) are overlain by unaltered hanging wall basalt and 

underlain by the altered rhyolite. The stratigraphy may be correlative to occurrences outside the Property 

(e.g. the Herbert showings), located by Stryker resources Ltd. on the Canadian side of the border 

(McDougal et al., 1983). 

Grab samples returned up to 6.6% Cu, 3610 ppm Zn, 12 ppm Ag, and 1.98 ppm Au (Wakeman, 1995). 

More recently, prospecting by Constantine has documented barite-sulfide boulders grading up to 2.28% 

Cu, 19.7% Zn, 49.7 ppm Ag and 0.61 ppm Au. The mineralized boulders are located directly downslope 

from the fall-line of the upper contact of the rhyolite.  

Two EM anomalies are located at depth, somewhat along the projection of the upper rhyolite contact, which 

may correlate to massive sulfide mineralized bodies (Figure 7-28). Rhyolite is documented to occur spatially 

proximal to base- and precious-metal mineralization elsewhere on the Palmer property (RW Zone, AG 

Zones, MHC). Regionally, the Boundary stratigraphy is near the base of the Triassic section.

8 Deposit Types 

The Palmer Project is host to volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) style mineralization. As a group, VMS 

deposits are stratiform accumulations of sulfide minerals that formed on or near the seafloor, by 

precipitation near a discharge site, or vents, of hydrothermal fluids (Franklin et al., 1981, see Figure 8-1). 

They form polymetallic mineralized bodies, and commonly contain economic concentrations of Zn, Cu, Pb, 

Ag, and Au. Many VMS deposits occur in clusters, with several individual mineralized bodies occurring 

within a radius of a few km, and they are often stacked above one another at different stratigraphic levels. 

Late Triassic, rift-related volcanic and sedimentary rocks within the Alexander Terrane are host to numerous 

VMS occurrences, prospects, and deposits throughout southeast Alaska and northwest British Columbia. 

Major deposits in the belt include the Windy Craggy Cu-Co-Au deposit, the fourth largest VMS deposit by 

size in the world, and the largest of the copper-rich (Besshi-type) VMS deposits, and the Greens Creek Ag-

Zn-Pb-Au Mine, one of the world's richest large tonnage VMS deposits (Galley et al., 2007). 

The Project most closely resembles the Greens Creek deposit. Significant differences exist however, most 

notably the much higher copper/zinc and zinc/lead ratios present at Palmer, which more closely resemble 

deposits in Noranda, Quebec or at Kidd Creek, Ontario. Zinc is the dominant base metal at both the Greens 

Creek deposit (Swainbank et al., 2000) and the Palmer. Silver grades are locally similarly enriched but are 

much lower within the mineral resource area at Palmer than at Greens Creek. Gold grades are commonly 

elevated at the Palmer (e.g. 0.5 to 1.5 g/t) but are lower than the average at Greens Creek (0.12 oz/ton 

(4.11 g/t)). Barite is common in both and is the dominant gangue mineral for parts of the ore body at the 

Greens Creek deposit. Deformation at the Greens Creek deposit is much more ductile in style than at the 

Palmer, resulting in sometimes tight and complex folding of the mineralized zones and host stratigraphy at 

Greens Creek.

9 Exploration 

Constantine, including its current JV partner, Dowa Metals & Mining Co. Ltd., and predecessor company 

Rubicon, have carried out approximately US$ 46.1 million in exploration work over a 20-year period from 

1998 to the end of 2018, including US$ 9.1 million in Project expenditures incurred in 2018. The work has 

included prospecting, regional and detailed geological mapping, structural studies and thesis work, line 

cutting, soil and rock sampling, airborne, ground and downhole geophysics, satellite imagery, diamond 

drilling, geotechnical, metallurgical, engineering and environmental baseline studies, and access road 

construction.  

During the June to September 2018 summer field season, continued exploration included detailed 

geological mapping at the Nunatak and Boundary Prospects, and Terminus, East Pump Valley, Khyber 

Pass Areas, diamond drilling at the Palmer and AG Zone deposits and the Boundary Prospect, glaciology 

studies included ground penetrating radar over the Saksaia and South Saksaia Glaciers, ongoing 

engineering, environmental, geotechnical, permitting and community relations-related work.  

The Glacier Creek access road was extended 0.92 km to the head of Glacier Creek valley and the terminus 

of the Saksaia Glacier, for a total length of 6.83 km (see Figure 9-1 for an aerial view and Figure 9-2 for a 

plan map). This final road section provides exploration access to MHT fee-simple lands near the base of 

the Palmer deposit mineral resource area with a total road distance to Haines, Alaska of approximately 60 

km.  

Further details of the 2018 Exploration and Development Programs can be found in Gray and Cunningham-

Dunlop (2019) and in Section 6.2.12.

10 Drilling 

Diamond drilling programs have been carried out on the Project over a period of 40 years since 1979. Total 

cumulative diamond drilling by the Company since 2006 is 60,200 m in 156 drill holes. Total cumulative 

diamond drilling on the Project by all operators is 67,745 m in 193 drill holes (Table 6-6). 

No new diamond drilling has been completed by the Company since the issuance of its most recent NI43-

101 technical report on January 31st, 2019 (Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop, 2019).  

In its most recent phase of drilling in June to September 2018, the Company carried out exploration, 

definition and geotechnical programs on the Palmer deposit (comprised of the RW and SW Zones), the AG 

Zone deposit, and the Boundary Prospect. The primary goals of the 2018 drill program were:  

 Definition and expansion drilling on the Palmer deposit mineral resource and conversion of Inferred 

to Indicated categories within the South Zone 

 Infill/step-out drilling on the AG Zone deposit to support an initial mineral resource estimate 

 Testing of new property-wide targets such as the Boundary Prospect 

 Geotechnical drilling to support ongoing engineering and permitting for the Option 7 proposed 

exploration portal site near the terminus of the Saksaia Glacier 

The Company drilled a total of 30 diamond drill holes totaling 10,094 m, including 28 exploration holes 

(CMR18-108 to 134B; 108W) totaling 9,694 m and two geotechnical holes (GT18-11 to 12) totaling 400 m. 

The Company met its seasonal objectives with encouraging drill hole intercepts at both the Palmer deposit 

and the AG Zone deposit (See Significant Intersections in Table 10-1 and Table 10-2. The new results 

expanded the SW Zone at the Palmer deposit to the west and confirmed continuity of grade and width 

down-plunge to the southwest towards the deeper SW EM zone. The Palmer deposit is open along strike 

and at depth and the potential to expand the known zones is considered good. The 2018 drill results also 

expanded the strike length of AG Zone deposit mineralization to over 550 meters and included multiple, 

thick, high-grade intersections of massive barite-sulfide mineralization with excellent continuity between 

holes. The AG Zone deposit remains open along strike and at depth.  

Based on the results of the 2017 and 2018 drilling campaigns, the Company completed the following tasks:  

 An updated mineral resource estimate for the Palmer deposit (Figure 10-1) by the Company on 

September 27th, 2018 (based on a data cut-off of May 1st, 2018) with a NI43-101 Technical Report 

issued by the Company on November 9th, 2018 (Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop, 2018); and  

 A new mineral resource estimate for the AG Zone deposit (Figure 10-2) by the Company on 

December 18th, 2018 (based on a data cut-off of November 15th, 2018) with a NI43-101 Technical 

Report issued by the Company on January 31st, 2019 (Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop, 2019) 

Further details of the 2018 Drilling Program can be found in Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop (2019) and in 

the History Section 6.2.12. Drill hole collar information can be found in Appendices I and II, significant assay 

intercepts are in Appendices III and IV, and representative drill cross-sections can be found in Appendix V.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

11.1  Sample Collection and Security 

Since 2006, samples collected have been prepared by properly trained and supervised Constantine 

employees at a secure facility on site. Sample collection and security has been undertaken in accord with 

currently acceptable methods and standards in use in the mining exploration industry. The sampling 

methodology and approach applied by Constantine are deemed by the Authors to be appropriate for the 

styles of mineralization exhibited on the Project. 

11.1.1 Soil Geochemical Sample Collection 

Any soil geochemical samples were collected from the B horizon, or C horizon in underdeveloped soil if on 

talus slopes, at an average depth of 10 to 15 centimetres. A shovel or mattock was used to dig a hole at 

each station, and the soil was placed in a standard kraft paper soil sample bag that was labeled with a 

sample number. 

11.1.2 Rock Geochemical Sample Collection 

Any surface rock geochemical sampling included grab samples of alteration and mineralization in outcrop 

and float, and randomly spaced grab samples of outcrop for alteration and lithogeochemical discrimination 

studies. Rock chip sampling was carried out along outcrops of prospective rocks, for geochemical 

characterization.  

11.1.3 Drill Core Sample Collection 

All 2018 drill core samples were selected by core logging geologists based on mineralization, alteration and 

lithology observations. All samples were analyzed by 4-acid digestion multi-element ICP, most were 

analyzed by gold fire assay, and select samples were analyzed with a complete lithogeochemical 

characterization package, including whole rock by XRF. This is used to obtain major oxide XRF data plus 

additional elements (i.e. rare earths, volatiles, and some trace elements such as Hg and Tl) and is 

particularly useful for identifying different basaltic flows. Samples through significant mineralization were 

also analyzed for barium by XRF 

Samples were prepared by properly trained and supervised Constantine employees at a secure facility on 

site. Samples of drill core were cut by a diamond blade rock saw, with half of the cut core placed in 

individually labeled and sealed polyurethane bags and half placed in the original core box for permanent 

storage. Sample lengths typically vary from a minimum 0.3 m interval to a maximum 2.0 m interval, with an 

average 1.0 to 1.5 m sample length. Samples were placed in sealed woven plastic bags and driven by 

Constantine personnel to Manitoulin Transport in Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada. Drill core samples were 

trucked by Manitoulin to the ALS Geochemistry prep facility in Kamloops, BC, Canada, and analyzed at 

ALS Minerals Canada Ltd., in North Vancouver, BC, Canada. Rock samples were trucked by Manitoulin to 

ALS Minerals Canada Ltd., in North Vancouver, BC, Canada for prep and analysis. 

Sample collection and security were undertaken in accordance with currently acceptable methods and 

standards in use in the mining exploration industry.

The sampling methodology and approach applied by Constantine are deemed by the Authors to be 

appropriate for the styles of mineralization exhibited on the Project. 

11.2 Sample Preparation and Analyses 

All 2018 drill core samples were prepped by ALS Geochemistry in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada 

and analyzed by ALS Minerals Canada Ltd. (ISO 9001) in North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 

For samples not being analyzed by metallic screening, the raw samples were crushed in an oscillating steel 

jaw crusher (>70% of the sample passing through a 6 mm screen), followed by a riffle split of 250 grams 

using a Boyd crusher/rotary splitter combination, then pulverized in a chrome steel ring mill (>85% of the 

sample passing through a 75 μm screen) (ALS prep codes: CRU-21q, PUL-31, SPL-22Y, WEI-21). 

For samples analyzed by metallic screening, the raw samples were crushed in an oscillating steel jaw 

crusher (>70% of the sample passing through a 2 mm screen), followed by a riffle split of 1000 grams using 

a Boyd rotary splitter, then pulverized in a chrome steel ring mill (>85% of the sample passing through a 75 

μm screen) (ALS prep code: PREP-31B).  

Gold analysis was performed on a 30 g sub-sample using ALS Method Au-AA23; fire assay fusion with 

atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish.  

Metallic screening (ALS method ME-SCR24) was performed for analysis of samples with coarse-grained 

Au and Ag mineralization. The method utilizes 1000 g of prepared pulp material screened through a 100 

micron stainless steel mesh to separate the oversize fractions. Any material larger than 100 microns is 

analyzed by fire assay fusion with gravimetric finish and reported as the positive fraction result. Material 

that is smaller than 100 microns is then homogenized, and two sub-samples are analyzed using fire assay 

with gravimetric finish. The average of the two sub-samples' gravimetric results is reported as the negative 

fraction result. Results of all three analyses are used to calculate the metal content across the positive and 

negative fractions. 

Four acid digestion ICP (ALS method ME-ICP61) was performed for analysis of 33 elements: Ag, Al, As, 

Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sc, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, 

and Zn. The method utilizes inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) 

conducted on 0.25 g of prepared sample digested in perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acids. 

For samples in which Cu, Zn, Pb, or Ag values exceeded the ME-ICP61 upper detection limit, ALS Method 

OG62 was utilized – a four-acid ICP-AES technique calibrated for potentially economic grade 

mineralization. For samples in which Zn or Ag exceeded the OG62 upper detection limits, Zn titration (ALS 

method Zn-VOL50) or Ag by fire assay and gravimetric finish (Ag-GRA21) were used, respectively.  

A complete characterization package (ALS method CCP-PKG03) that consists of several methods was 

performed for the analysis of 65 oxides and elements. This analytical package also includes measurement 

of loss on ignition (LOI). Individual methods consist of ALS methods ME-XRF26, ME-MS81, ME-4ACD81, 

ME-MS42, and ME-IR08. ALS method ME-XRF26 is a 13-element oxide package where the sample is 

prepared utilizing lithium borate fusion into a fused disc where it is then analyzed by XRF spectrometry. 

This method yields Al2O, BaO, CaO, Cr2O3, Fe2O3, K2O, MgO, MnO, Na2O, P2O5, SO3, SiO2, and TiO2. 

The ALS Method ME-MS81 is a 31-element package that includes Ba, Ce, Cr, Cs, Dy, Er, Eu, Ga, Gd, Hf, 

Ho, La, Lu, Nb, Nd, Pr, Rb Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, Tm, U, V, W, Y, Yb, Zr is a lithium borate fusion technique 

followed by acid dissolution and ICP-MS analysis. The elements As, Bi, Hg, In, Re, Sb, Se, Te and Tl were 

analyzed using the aqua regia digestion and ICP-MS method (ALS method ME-MS42) while elements C,

and S were analyzed by combustion furnace (ALS method ME-IR08). The ME-4ACD81 is an identical 

method to the main four acid digestion ICP method (ME-ICP61) except it yields results for only 10 elements: 

Ag, Cd, Co, Cu, Li, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sc, Zn. This method is already built into the whole-rock characterization 

package in ALS Minerals' price schedule and is more cost-efficient to process this method despite the 

duplicate analyses. 

The barium analysis utilized lithium borate fusion into fused discs for XRF analyses (ALS Method ME-

XRF26). 

All pulps and selected coarse rejects that may merit additional analyses or are near or within the zone of 

mineralization were retrieved from the lab and stored in Constantine's storage locker in Vancouver.

12 Data Verification 

Previous Authors Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop (2019), Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop (2018), Gray and 

Cunningham-Dunlop (2015), Greig and Giroux (2010) and Greig (2006) all performed verification of the 

diamond drilling data that supports the Palmer Exploration Project mineral resource estimate. 

12.1 Drill Hole Database 

The Project data is stored in a custom Microsoft Access® (Access) database (termed the "database"). This 

database is secure, operated by a single database administrator, and contains data checking routines 

designed to prevent common data entry errors.  

An export of the database was provided to the Authors for auditing purposes and mineral resource 

estimation. This audit consisted of checking the digital data against source documents to ensure proper 

data entry, as well as, data integrity checks (checking for overlapping intervals, data beyond total depth of 

hole, unit conversion, etc.). Minor errors identified during this review were corrected within the master 

database and passed back to the Company. All original assay certificates have been found and catalogued 

for drill holes included within the mineral resource estimate. 

12.2 Drill Hole Collar and Downhole Surveying 

All drill hole collar and down-hole surveys were loaded into the database by the database manager.  

In 2016, the Company undertook a drill hole collar survey program to convert the existing Project survey 

datum from UTM NAD27 to UTM NAD83 (Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop, 2018). Out of 134 known drill 

hole collars, 101 were re-surveyed. The priority was to acquire drill hole collar coordinates for holes that 

contributed to the mineral resource estimate and these holes were successfully surveyed. Fifteen holes (13 

from MHC plus CMR06-01 and CMR06-02) had coordinates that did not change and were identical to the 

pre-2016 coordinates. Eighteen holes (18) had co-ordinates adjusted on a case-by-case basis. To assess 

the quality and accuracy of the 2016 collar re-survey program, a selection of the 2014 monuments (14-01, 

14-07 and 14-09) were also surveyed each day. Based on the known locations of the 2014 monuments, 

the 2016 survey returned an average x,y positional accuracy to within 1-2 cm and an average elevation 

accuracy to within 2cm. All the results from the 2016 collar re-survey program have been incorporated in 

the database.  

The Authors are confident that the Company has made best efforts to confirm all existing drill hole collar 

locations and that the resulting data was acquired using adequate quality control procedures that generally 

meet industry best practices for a drilling-stage exploration project, and the data are adequate for purposes 

of mineral resource estimation. 

12.3 Drill Hole Logs 

All drill logs including collar, lithology, alteration, and geotechnical data were loaded into the database by 

the database manager from the Microsoft Access tables generated by Constantine geological staff. 

Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop (2019) reported that 5% of the Project drill holes were selected and content 

of the original drill logs were compared against the records in the database. No significant issues were

noted and the lithology codes in the drill logs matched the records in the database. These drill logs were 

used to inform the geological model used in mineral resource estimation.  

Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop (2019) also reported that drill core from selected drill holes was reviewed 

from each year's drill campaign and compared against logged lithologies in the database and that the data 

concurs with the descriptions. 

12.4 Drill Hole Assays 

Drill Assays were loaded into the database in their original units from files received directly from the assay 

laboratories. 

Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop (2019) reported that 5% of the Project drill holes were randomly selected 

and values in the original assay certificates were compared against the records in the database and no 

significant data entry errors were found. 

12.5 Specific Gravity 

12.5.1 Field Specific Gravity Measurements 

Bulk specific gravity (SG) is measured by trained and qualified Company personnel performing the industry 

standard "weight-in-water/weight-in-air". Representative sections of halved core, generally consisting of 

one to five 10-30 cm long pieces, are measured and averaged for all assay sample intervals within 

mineralized intersections with the potential to be included in resource wireframes. SG measurements are 

also carried out on wall rock adjacent to mineralized intervals. Samples containing significant void space, 

such as those from the RW Oxide Zone, are first coated in paraffin wax to ensure more accurate and 

representative SG measurements.  

A project total of 3,911 specific gravity measurements have been carried out on core samples with an 

overall average SG of 3.21 (average is inclusive of unmineralized wall rock). In the opinion of Gray and 

Cunningham-Dunlop (2019), the number of SG measurements is adequate to support mineral resource 

estimation.  

12.5.2 Laboratory Specific Gravity Measurements 

Field SG measurements were verified by ALS Minerals Canada Ltd. who used a pycnometer to measure 

specific gravity for randomly selected sample pulps from the mineralized zones (ALS Method OA-GRA08).  

A project total of 232 laboratory specific gravity measurements have been carried out. Gray and 

Cunningham-Dunlop (2019) reviewed the laboratory SG results which generally showed good correlation 

and validated the field measurements. It should be noted that whole core samples were used to obtain field 

data and sample pulps were used to obtain laboratory data. Void space error was minimized in the field by 

using the wax immersion method, and therefore field data are considered more accurate and representative 

than the laboratory method. 

12.6 Assaying and Quality Control-Quality Assurance (QA-QC) 

Quality control data for the Project has included both internal and external quality control measures. ALS 

Minerals Canada Ltd. implemented internal laboratory measures consisting of quality control samples 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

For CONSTANTINE METAL RESOURCES LTD. 

Page 12-3 

 

(blanks and certified reference materials and duplicate pulp) within each batch of samples submitted for 

assaying.  

All results have been recorded in an Excel document containing all QA/QC data and charts by the 

Company's database manager and vetted by Senior Company technical staff. In the opinion of Gray and 

Cunningham-Dunlop (2019), the current analytical quality control program developed by Constantine for 

the Project is mature and is overseen by appropriately qualified geologists. The exploration data was 

acquired using adequate quality control procedures that generally meet industry best practices for a drilling-

stage exploration project, and the data are adequate for the purposes of mineral resource estimation. 

12.7 Metallurgy 

Metallurgical test data was verified through a review of testwork reports and an analysis of the new results 

from the 2018 metallurgical testwork program completed by SGS, specifically: 

 SGS Canada Inc, "The Recovery of Copper, Zinc, Silver and Gold from the Palmer Samples", 

Project No. 14063-001, (Issued: 28 October 2013) 

 SGS Canada Inc, "Barite Metallurgical Testwork on the Palmer VMS Project", Project No. 14063-

002, (Issued: 30 July 2018) 

 SGS Canada Inc, "Comminution and Mineralogy on the Palmer VMS Deposit", Project No. 14063-

03 Revision 1, (Issued: 14 December 2018) 

Metallurgical test data was verified through a review of testwork reports and an analysis of the new results 

from the 2018 metallurgical testwork program completed by SGS. The sample selection for the 2013 test 

program was representative of the Palmer deposit. The 2018 samples were limited to two drill holes from 

one area of the mineralized zone but produced similar results to previous test work. The samples tested 

had head grades much higher than those anticipated from the mine plan and recoveries may be lower than 

the results indicate. Any studies and reports referred to were thoroughly reviewed and align with the PEA 

metallurgical design and analysis in this report. All metallurgical data was verified and is adequate for this 

Preliminary Economic Assessment Technical Report as required by NI 43-101 guidelines. 

12.8 Mining and Underground Geotechnical 

Mining and geotechnical data was verified during the site visit, through review of previous studies and 

historical data and is adequate for the PEA as required by NI 43-101 guidelines. 

12.9 Surface Geotechnical 

With the exception of limited geophysical survey information near the mill site, no subsurface information 

currently exists to allow for geotechnical characterization of mill site foundations or the TMF/WRSF. 

Therefore, geotechnical engineering design parameters were assumed based on experience from other 

projects and the current understanding of the site geologic setting. Surface conditions and the geologic 

setting were confirmed by the QP during his site visit and engineering parameters selected are adequate 

for PEA design. Geotechnical investigation and testwork will be required to support future studies.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

13.1 Introduction 

Metallurgical testing was performed on Palmer samples by SGS Canada Inc. (SGS), Burnaby, BC, in 2013 

and 2018. The most recent test program was completed by SGS in 2018 and was used as the basis for the 

process design and recovery method outlined in Section 17. A full breakdown of the results for each test 

program can be found in the following reports: 

 SGS Canada Inc, "The Recovery of Copper, Zinc, Silver and Gold from the Palmer Samples", 

Project No. 14063-001, (Issued: 28 October 2013) 

 SGS Canada Inc, "Barite Metallurgical Testwork on the Palmer VMS Project", Project No. 14063-

002, (Issued: 30 July 2018) 

 SGS Canada Inc, "Comminution and Mineralogy on the Palmer VMS Deposit", Project No. 14063-

03 Revision 1, (Issued: 14 December 2018) 

Based on the results from SGS a Cu, Zn, Py and Ba sequential flotation can produce saleable concentrates 

at a primary grind size of 80% passing (P80) 72 µm, and rougher concentrate regrind sizes of 35 µm for Cu 

and 50 µm for Zn. Locked cycle flotation test results carried out on the High Ba Composite achieved 

recoveries of 88.9% Cu, 93.1% Zn and 91.1% Ba at concentrate grades of 24.5% Cu, 61.3% Zn and 52.3% 

Ba. 

13.2 Summary of SGS Test Program (2013) 

The following section summarizes the main results from the metallurgical test programs conducted by SGS 

Canada Inc. in 2013. The results were previously reviewed in Section 13 of the Palmer 43-101 Technical 

Report and Updated Resource Estimate for the Palmer Exploration Project May 11th, 2015. 

13.2.1 SGG Test Program (2013) 

Approximately 500 kg of the Palmer deposit material from exploration rejects was used to create a master 

composite for flotation testwork. Drill holes CMR08-11B, 17, 19, 22 and CMR09-23B, 24, 26, 28 were 

blended to make up the master composite used in the test program. The location of the drill holes are shown 

in Figure 13-1. The composite assayed 1.56% Cu, 6.47% Zn, 0.19 g/t Au, 28.5 g/t Ag, 0.20% Pb, 13.1% 

Fe and 19.2% S. The test program included mineralogical analysis and sequential flotation of the Cu and 

Zn which included rougher flotation, cleaner flotation and locked cycle tests (LCT). The mineralogy indicated 

the material is relatively coarse grained with most of the Cu as Chalcopyrite and the Zn as Sphalerite. 

Secondary Cu minerals were noted in the mineralogy and depressant reagents were required to reduce Zn 

activation. Of the material tested at P80 target grind size of 72 µm results indicated that sequential Cu, Zn 

flotation could achieve recoveries in the range of 87% to 93% Cu and 90% Zn in concentrate grades of 

27% to 30% Cu and 55% Zn. Further optimization of the flowsheet was recommended moving forward in 

addition to variability testwork and mapping of secondary minerals throughout the deposit that could 

influence recovery. The averages of the two LCTs completed are shown in Table 13-1.

13.3 Summary of SGS (2018), 14063-002 

In March 2018, a metallurgical test program was commenced at SGS in Burnaby, BC (Project No. 14063-

002). Drill core rejects from two drill holes were used to blend a High Ba composite that was submitted for 

metallurgical testing in support of this preliminary economic assessment. The test program focused on 

mineralogy and sequential flotation of Cu, Zn, Py and Ba. 

13.3.1 Sample Selection 

A blend of exploration reject material from two drill holes CMR17-82 and CMR17-97 were used to create 

the High Ba composite. The location the two drill holes are shown in Figure 13-2.

Copper is associate with chalcopyrite (Cp) (96.5%) and to a minor extent tennantite-tetrahedrite (Tn) 

(2.8%). The Cp and Tn were equally distributed between the two size fractions with respect to Cu 

deportment. Zinc was predominately associated with sphalerite (Sp) (98.6%) and to a lesser extent 

smithsonite (1.1%). Approximately 89.6% of the Sp was liberated indicating high recovery potential. 

Sphalerite was evenly distributed between +38 µm and -38 µm size fractions. Previous mineralogy indicated 

a coarse grind could produce high recoveries. Based on the 2013 test program a target grind size of P80 72 

µm was chosen with minimal regrind. The Ba mineralogy indicates the majority of the Ba is associated with 

Barite and is 95.4% liberated. The Ba final concentrate was analyzed and the majority of the sample (95.6%) 

was barite. 

13.3.3 Comminution 

A bond ball mill work index (BWi) test was completed on the High Ba composite at a sieve size of 106 µm. 

The results are summarized in Table 13-4. The results indicate the sample can be classified as very soft.

13.3.4 Flotation 

Rougher and cleaner flotation tests were conducted on the High Ba composite to refine the test conditions 

from the 2013 program for Cu and Zn. From the Zn tailings a pyrite rougher floatation and Ba flotation tests 

were completed to investigate the parameters and flowsheet that would produce a saleable Ba concentrate. 

Locked cycle testing was completed to produce results closer to what would be expected in an operating 

plant for Cu, Zn and Ba concentrates. 

 Cu-Zn Rougher Flotation 

Rougher flotation tests were completed as a confirmation of the previous test program (SGS 14063-001). 

The main conditions included a primary grind size targeting a P80 of 72 µm followed by sequential rougher 

flotation of the Cu and then Zn. Other important parameters tested included PAX as a collector, MIBC as a 

frother, the effect of sodium cyanide (NaCN) and ZnSO4 dosage on Zn depression, CuSO4 as a depressant 

in the Zn circuit and lime as a pH modifier. The results from the rougher test work indicated a lower 

depressant dosage improved Cu recovery.  

After completing Cu rougher flotation, the pH of the flotation pulp was adjusted up to 11.5 with lime, and 

copper sulfate was added to activate sphalerite. Initial Zn rougher tests indicated relatively good Zn rougher 

performance with conventional reagent dosages. Overall recoveries in the mid 90's were achieved to the 

Zn rougher concentrate. 

 Cleaner Flotation 

Two batch cleaner flotation tests were conducted to determine if higher concentrate grades could be 

achieved while maintaining Cu and Zn recovery. Sequential Cu and Zn flotation at primary P80 grind size 

target of 72 µm was completed with 3 stages of cleaning. The rougher concentrates regrind sizes of 44 µm 

and 30 µm for the Cu circuit and 62 µm and 40 µm for the Zn circuit were tested. In the first cleaner test 

(CF1) no NaCN was added to the grinding stages for Cu and a coarser regrind size was targeted for both 

Cu and Zn. The final Cu recovery was 81.3% at a grade of 23.1% Cu. There were minimal losses of Zn to 

the Cu concentrate. The Zn recovery was low at 57.2% at a grade of grade of 64.7% Zn. The second 

cleaner test (CF2) carried out with NaCN added to the primary grinding and copper regrind stages as well 

as at a higher PAX dosage in the copper rougher flotation stage. The main changes to CF1 for the Zn circuit 

included a higher CuSO4 dosage in the rougher flotation circuit and lime was added to the regrind mill. The 

final Cu concentrate recovered 84.4% Cu at a grade of 24.9% Cu. The Zn concentrate recovered 40.3% 

Zn at a grade of 62.8% Zn. The stage recovery for Zn in CF2 was slightly higher at 74.3% compared to 

70.3%. 

Three additional cleaner tests were completed (F10-5, F10-8 and F10-9) to produce a bulk sample for the 

Ba flotation test work. The tests were also used for additional optimization to improve the Cu and Zn 

concentrate recoveries. The best results were produced using conditions from test F10-8 with a final Cu

 Py-Ba Rougher Flotation 

Five rougher flotation tests were completed using the Zn bulk tailings sample from Tests F10-5, 8 & 10. 

The initial stage includes flotation of the pyrite to produce a pyrite concentrate that could potentially be acid 

generating material (PAG) for deposition underground as paste followed by Ba flotation to produce a 

saleable cleaner concentrate. The chemical analysis of the Zn tailings sample feeding the Py rougher 

flotation circuit is shown in Table 13-7.

Of the five rougher tests, Ba-RF1 through Ba-RF5, only Ba-RF2 included a pyrite flotation prior to the Ba 

float. PAX and MIBC were used to produce the Py concentrate. The results indicate that 64.5% S and 3.0% 

Ba reported to the Py concentrate. The Ba rougher flotation tests were carried out using Soda Ash, Aero 

845, Fuel Oil, MIBC and Guar Gum at varying dosages and float times (12 to 16 minutes) maintaining a pH 

of 10. The tests produced similar mass pulls and grades for Ba to the concentrate. The Ba-RF2 and Ba-

RF3 were the only tests where the recovery curves leveling off after the final stage of flotation. The mass 

versus recovery and grade versus recovery curves are shown in Figure 13-6 and Figure 13-7. Parameters 

from rougher tests Ba-RF2 and Ba-RF3 parameters were used for the rougher flotation in the next stage of 

test work.

 Ba Cleaner Flotation 

A total of eight cleaner tests were completed on the Zn tailings sample (Ba-CF1 through Ba-CF8). The test 

work included three to five stages of cleaning at varying slurry densities utilizing Aero 845, Fuel Oil, MIBC 

and Sodium Silicate to facilitate the upgrade of the rougher concentrate. The tests were run at a pH in the 

range of 9.2 to 9.7 with the exception of test Ba-CF7 where lime was added to maintain a pH of 10.5. The

Test Ba-CF8 included a pyrite rougher flotation stage with the rougher tailings feeding the Ba rougher 

circuit. The rougher flotation was followed by five stages of cleaning. The addition of sodium silicate as a 

depressant in the first cleaner and performing the tests at a low slurry density of 20% solids provided the 

best conditions. The test parameters are shown in Table 13-8 and the results in Table 13-9.

13.3.5 Concentrate Quality 

The Cu and Zn concentrates from locked cycle testing were not analyzed for minor elements in the 2018. 

The SGS 2013 program did an ICP scan of the LCT2 concentrates and the results indicate relatively high 

As (2,210 ppm) in the Cu concentrate and Cd (2,720 ppm) in the Zn concentrate. A multi-element analysis 

was completed on the SGS (2018) Py rougher concentrate and Ba-CF2. Elements were analyzed using 

lithium borate fusion and ICP or ICP mass spectroscopy. The results for the final Ba concentrate are 

summarized in Table 13-12.

13.4 Summary of SGS (2018), 14063-03 

Samples from the AG Zone deposit were sent to SGS by Constantine for comminution and mineralogical 

analysis. The SMC and bond ball mill work index test work was completed on the 'South West' sample. 

Mineralogy was also the focus with no flotation test work. 

13.4.1 Comminution 

Drill core, CMR18-110, from the AG Zone was collected by Constantine and sent to SGS for comminution 

test work. The work included SMC, abrasion index and bond ball mill work index test work. The results 

indicate the mineralized rock is soft with an A x b value of 89.6 and mildly abrasive with an abrasion index 

(Ai) of 0.119 g. The bond ball mill index work index indicates the material is very soft with a BWi of 6.9 

kWh/t at a P80 of 79 µm. Similar results, BWi 6.3 kWh/t, were produced as part of the SGS (2013) test work. 

The results are shown Table 13-13.

13.4.2 AG Zone Mineralogy 

Coarse rejects representing the AG Zone were collected by Constantine and sent to SGS for mineralogical 

analysis using QEMSCAN. The analysis indicated that the copper mineral was predominately tennantite-

tetrahedrite (0.6%), zinc mineral was sphalerite (11%), barite content was 38% and the main sulfide mineral 

was pyrite (25%). In addition to these minerals lead was present as galena (3%) and the main non-sulfide 

minerals are mica (14%) followed by quartz (6%). 

The mineralogy indicates tennantite-tetrahedrite is 80.9% liberated (76.9% fully exposed) and sphalerite is 

92.5% liberated (88.6% exposed). Liberation was higher in the -38 µm size fraction for both tennantite-

tetrahedrite and sphalerite. Barite was found to be 97% liberated (94.5% exposed). The results indicate 

minimal regrind will be required to recover Cu, Zn and Ba. Similar liberation results were seen for the High 

Ba composite for sphalerite and barite. 

A comparison of mineral content in the AG Zone, High Ba composite and Master composite (SGS 2013) is 

shown in Table 13-14. Copper in the AG Zone was mainly associated with tennantite-tetrahedrite (0.62%) 

followed by chalcopyrite (0.01%) and the High Ba composite copper was mainly associated with 

chalcopyrite (5.07%). In the AG Zone there was 3.30% galena (61.4% liberated) and minimal galena in the 

Palmer deposit. Sphalerite and Barite have similar mineral mass with a few percent lower in the AG Zone 

compared to the High Ba composite. Pyrite content was approximately 25% for both 2018 samples.

13.5 Relevant Results 

Based on the results from the SGS (2018) test program, the process flowsheet will include one stages of 

crushing underground. Through the test work, the material will then be processed through two stages of 

grinding to achieve a target P80 of 72 µm. The grinding circuit will be designed using SMC results and Bond 

ball mill work index of 6.9 kWh/t.  

Cyclone overflow from the secondary grinding circuit will then be subjected to Cu, Zn, Py and Ba sequential 

flotation. To improve concentrate grade, Cu and Zn rougher concentrates will be reground to P80 grind sizes 

of 35 µm and 50 µm respectively, before being cleaned in three stages of cleaner flotation. Tailings from 

the Zn rougher and 1st cleaner circuits will be combined and feed the Py rougher flotation circuit. The 

rougher concentrate will be filtered and mixed as paste for deposition underground. The Py rougher tailings 

feeds the Ba rougher flotation circuit. The Ba concentrate will be upgraded in three stages of cleaning and 

the Ba tailings will be processed as filtered tailings. The test conditions from SGS (2018) LCT1 (F10-8) for 

Cu and Zn and LCT1 (BA-CF8) for Py and Ba were used to size the flotation circuit and predict reagent 

consumable rates. Section 17 provides more detail on each process unit operation. 

A preliminary estimate of Cu, Zn and Ba recoveries and concentrate grades are summarized in Table 13-16 

and provide the basis for the economic analysis presented in Section 22. These projections are a 

combination of SGS (2018) locked cycle test results and SGS (2018) "Mineralogy and Benchmarking on 

Palmer AG Zone report". The test results were conducted on samples with head grades that are higher 

than the average life-of-mine (LOM) head grades and additional test work at varying head grades is 

recommended to confirm the concentrate grades and recoveries. Test work has not been completed on AG 

Zone and the results are only estimates based on SGS 14063-03 (2028) mineral analysis and SGS (2018) 

benchmarking comparisons to previous test work and similar projects.

14 Mineral Resources Estimate 

14.1 Introduction 

This mineral resource estimate is an update of the resource documented in the NI 43-101 Technical Report 

by Gray and Cunningham-Dunlop dated November 9th, 2018. That report described the Mineral Resource 

in the RW and SW areas – collectively referred to here as the main area (or the Palmer deposit). This 

update includes that documentation in Section 14.1, but also describes the estimation of the additional AG 

Zone (or the AG Zone deposit) Mineral Resource, released December 18th, 2018, in Section 14.2. The 

Palmer Project Mineral Resource Statement is found in Section 14.3.  

Figure 14-1 highlights the location of the RW/SW & AG Zones Mineral Resource areas.

14.2 RW and SW Zones Resource Estimation 

14.2.1 Currently Available Drill Data and Model Setup 

The Mineral Resource Estimate for the RW and SW Zones is based on assay data available as of May 1st, 

2018. Results from 44,900 m of diamond drilling in 108 holes have been used in the interpretation of geology 

in support of this resource estimate; 60 holes (23,700 m) intersected the mineralized zones and have been 

used for grade estimation. This includes 26 holes that have been drilled since the previous main area 

resource, reported in 2015. Figure 14-2 illustrates drill hole locations, the extents of the resource block 

model and the interpreted zones of mineralization; holes drilled since the 2015 resource are shown in red. 

Table 14-1 lists the main area block model setup.

14.2.2 Geologic Model 

Consistent with previous estimates, the geologic model used for control of grade interpolation was derived 

from wireframes constructed by Constantine personnel. Darwin Green, P. Geo, Vice President of 

Exploration, oversaw development of the mineralization solids. As a general rule, mineralization included 

in sulfide zone wireframes was limited to material grading >0.5% copper or >2% zinc, and that could be 

demonstrated to be correlative with definable stratabound zones. In some cases, lower grade material was 

included where geology was clearly correlative (i.e. massive barite and/or barren pyrite) and its inclusion 

supported a more meaningful and geologically consistent volume. Distances applied in the interpretation of 

geologic units were based on geologic understanding of the type of mineralization being enveloped. For 

example, stringer style would not be as laterally persistent as strong massive sulfide mineralization. 

Mineralization was outlined in five zones. Previous geologic models have separated the lower portion of 

Zone 2-3 as the EM Zone; subsequent drilling supports interpretation as a single mineralized zone. 

A zone of significant stringer mineralization has been intersected by a single hole in the lower portion of 

Zone 2-3. This zone has been separately wireframed and is included in the Inferred Mineral Resource (Zone 

2-3 Mid). An RW Oxide zone has been wireframed as in the 2015 model. Estimation of this zone is 

documented here; however due to uncertain metallurgical properties, it is not included in the Mineral 

Resource Estimate. 

Separate 'fringe' wireframes were developed as part of 2018 geologic model that essentially envelope the 

main mineralization solids. Interpolation of grade and density values inside the fringe wireframes was 

carried out separately and have been included in this resource estimate where mineralization is less than 

3 m in horizontal thickness or where horizontal gaps in the mineralized zones are less than 3 m; in this way, 

the tabled resource reflects a minimum 3 m mineralization thickness as well as internal dilution where 

unmineralized zones are less than of 3 m in horizontal thickness (not left as pillars on mining). The main 

purpose of the modelled 'fringe' material will be to quantify mining dilution in the upcoming PEA study. 

14.2.3 Assay Compositing 

Assays were composited to a length of 1.5 m within the bounds of the mineralized wireframes. A 1.5 m 

composite length was chosen based on the fact that 1.5 m was the most common assay interval as well as 

its correspondence to the selected resource bock size (4:1). 

As was the case for the 2015 resource estimate, less than half-length composites (<0.75 m), resulting from 

compositing within the mineralized solids, were handled in such a way as to appropriately preserve their 

influence. The composite length across these zone intersections was recalculated such that composite

lengths were equal, and as close to 1.5 m as possible. This technique resulted in composite lengths ranging 

between 0.76 and 1.72 m. 

Correlation between grade and density indicated that the calculation of density weighted grade composites 

was appropriate. Ninety-five (95) percent of assays inside the reported resource volumes have density 

measurements; for those without a measured density value, the average density per mineralized solid, was 

used in the compositing process. This approach is also consistent with the 2015 estimate. 

14.2.4 Grade Capping 

Grade capping is used to control the impact of extreme, outlier high-grade samples on the overall resource 

estimate. For this estimate, assay grades were examined in histograms and probability plots to determine 

levels at which values are deemed outliers to the general population. These cap values were applied by 

metal, by mineralized zone prior to compositing (see Table 14-2). Uncapped and capped composite 

statistics are presented in Table 14-3. 

Table 14-2 Grade Capping Levels 

 

Source: Constantine (2018)  

The impact of grade capping can be measured by comparing estimated uncapped and capped block grades 

above a zero cut-off. At Palmer, metal removed by capping is very low reflecting the fact that relatively few 

assays were capped. Metal removed through the capping process amounts to: 0.5% for copper, 0% for 

zinc, 0.4% for silver, 2.0% for gold and 0.7% for barium.

14.2.5 Grade Estimation 

The generally narrow and branching nature of massive sulfide mineralization at Palmer make the calculation 

and meaningful interpretation of variograms difficult. Global variograms are useful for directional analysis; 

however, there are insufficient sample numbers to fit compelling variogram models. Grades were therefore 

interpolated by inverse distance cubed weighting (ID3). Examination of downhole variograms and the 

comparison of ID3 and inverse distance squared (ID2) estimates, led to the choice of interpolation by ID3. 

At the current drill density, the ID2 estimate appeared unrealistically smooth between drill intersections. 

Sample search distances and orientations were derived to best fit the zones of mineralization. Search 

details are presented in Table 14-4. 

Table 14-4 Main Area Estimation Search Parameters 

 

Source: Constantine (2018)  

Grades for all elements were estimated using a minimum of two and a maximum of 16 samples and a 

maximum of six samples per hole; except for the interpolation of zinc grade where estimation by a maximum 

of 24 samples produced results that were deemed more valid. All grade estimates were hard-bounded by 

mineralized zone. 

14.2.6 Density Interpolation 

In total, 1,105 density measurements have been made on core samples within the main area mineralized 

zones (1,091 excluding RW Oxide Zone). The abundance of samples coupled with their variability illustrated 

that interpolation of density values was more appropriate than assignment of a mean value by zone. Density 

values were estimated by inverse distance squared weighting, within each wireframe domain using a

14.2.7 Model Validation 

Estimated grades for all elements were validated visually by comparing composite to block values in plan-

view and on cross-sections. There is good visual correlation between composite and estimated block 

grades for all modelled elements. 

Two additional check models were estimated for all metals. To appropriately match the composite length, 

a nearest neighbour model (NN) was estimated using a block size of 6 x 6 x 1.5 m and then re-blocked 

(4:1) to the resource model grid. Another estimate was made by compositing single intervals across 

mineralization intersections and interpolating grade with a nearest neighbour approach. This zone 

composite model (ZC) produces results akin to a polygonal estimate. All models were hard-bounded by 

mineralized zone. 

The ID3 estimates were compared spatially to the check models, using swath plots and deemed 

appropriately smooth. Globally, model average grades above zero cut-off (shown on swath plots) compare 

very closely, indicating no bias (Table 14-6).

14.2.8 Resource Classification and Tabulation 

Additional drilling since the 2015 estimate has given sufficient confidence in the geologic continuity to 

upgrade a portion of the steeply dipping South Wall mineralization (Zones 1 and 2-3) to Indicated Mineral 

Resource. As a test of confidence in geologic interpretation, the 2015 mineralized solids were pierced by 

new drilling to allow comparison to intervals actually encountered in Zones 1 and 2-3. Results showed that

new drilling enlarged the extents of mineralized zones in some cases, and while not always intersected at 

exactly the predicted depth, intersected widths were always present and generally thicker that predicted by 

the 2015 solids. This exercise qualitatively led to confidence in the continuity of the mineralized zones as 

interpreted from drilling. 

Blocks were classified as Indicated Mineral Resource where: 

 They are ≥ 25 m inside the extents of mineralized solids, 

 They are estimated by composites from at least three holes, and 

 The average distance to three holes is ≤ 50 m. 

Remaining estimated material within the interpreted wireframes constitutes the Inferred Mineral Resource. 

Measures were taken to ensure the Mineral Resource meets the condition of "reasonable prospects of 

eventual economic extraction" as required under NI 43-101. Potential extraction of the resource will be by 

underground techniques and while the 6 x 6 x 6 m block size is not a true underground selective mining 

unit, it is deemed reasonable to tally the resource by NSR cut-off, by-block. 

As a selectivity test, of by-block versus some larger mining volume, the resource was broken down into 

groups of contiguous blocks and tabled by NSR cut-off. For the grouping, blocks were accumulated by 

model column/level through the mineralized solids (model rows). Grouped in this way, the 36,700 blocks 

were assigned to 11,700 units of grouped blocks. At a $75 NSR cut-off, the value of blocks totalled in this 

way was within 1% of the total by-block, giving credibility to the by-block tabulation presented here. 

Block NSR value (US$/t) was calculated using a formula supplied by Constantine based on metallurgical 

test work to date, as well as other relevant project experience. The calculation includes metal price and 

recoveries as listed in Table 14-7 as well as offsite costs that include concentrate transportation, smelter 

treatment charges and refining charges. Block NSR was calculated as follows: 

NSRblock= $48.67 x %Cu + $16.01 x %Zn + $0.32 x g/t Ag + $23.45 x g/t Au 

Table 14-7 NSR Parameters

The main area resource is stated at a cut-off of US$ 75/tonne (Table 14-8). This is considered appropriate 

given the likely costs of underground mining and processing of the Palmer deposit. Table 14-9 represents 

the 2018 estimate at a range of NSR cut-offs. Barite is included in the tables below as opposed to barium, 

as that is the mineral that will be marketed. The conversion from Ba to BaSO4 is 1.7 times (based on atomic 

weights).

14.3 AG Zone Resource Estimation 

14.3.1 Currently Available Drill Data and Model Setup 

This AG Zone resource estimate for the Palmer Exploration Project is based on assay data available as of 

November 15th, 2018. Results from 10,800 m of diamond drilling in 29 holes have been used in the 

interpretation of geology in support of this resource estimate; 20 holes (7,400 m) intersected the mineralized 

zones and have been used for grade estimation. Figure 14-3 illustrates drill hole locations, the extents of 

the resource block model and the interpreted zones of mineralization. Table 14-11 lists the AG Zone block 

model setup.

14.3.2 Geologic Model 

Consistent with the Palmer main area resource estimate, the geologic model used for control of grade 

interpolation was derived from wireframes constructed by Constantine personnel; Darwin Green, P. Geo, 

Vice President of Exploration, oversaw development of the mineralization solids. As a general rule, 

mineralization of >2% zinc or >60 g/t silver was used to define solids. In several cases, grade cut-off criteria 

are overruled on the basis of geology where mineralization and rock types are deemed to be geologic 

horizon equivalents. For example, below cut-off semi-massive to massive sulfide-barite or equivalent 

exhalative mineralization (e.g. chert). An attempt was made to include all intersections of massive 

barite/sulfide within the mineralized wireframes. 

The AG Zone consists of four mineralized zones: 

 A single large lens of massive-barite sulfide – AG_Main lens; 

 A separate zinc-rich footwall zone of stringer/feeder and replacement style mineralization - the 

AG_Zinc zone; 

 The upper NW corner of the deposit is cut by a shallow angle fault, with two small mineralized 

solids defined above the fault – the Hinge_Zone; and 

 The AG_Upper zone 

As was done in the Palmer main area resource estimate, a separate 'fringe' wireframe was developed that 

essentially envelopes the AG Zone mineralization solids. Interpolation of grade and density values inside 

the fringe wireframes was carried out separately and will be used to quantify mining dilution in the upcoming 

PEA study. 

14.3.3 Assay Compositing 

Assays were composited to a length of 1.5 m within the bounds of the mineralized wireframes. A 1.5 m 

composite length was chosen based on the fact that 1.5 m was the most common assay interval as well as 

its correspondence to the selected resource bock size (4:1). 

As was the case for the Palmer main area resource estimate, less than half-length composites (<0.75 m), 

resulting from compositing within the mineralized solids, were handled in such a way as to appropriately 

preserve their influence. The composite length across these zone intersections was recalculated such that 

composite lengths were equal, and as close to 1.5 m as possible. This technique resulted in composite 

lengths ranging between 1.33 and 1.73 m.

Correlation between grade and density indicated that the calculation of density weighted grade composites 

was appropriate. Ninety-seven (97) percent of assays inside the AG Zone resource volumes have density 

measurements; for those without a measured density value, the average density per mineralized solid, was 

used in the compositing process. This approach is consistent with the main area resource estimate. 

14.3.4 Grade Capping 

Grade capping is used to control the impact of extreme, outlier high-grade samples on the overall resource 

estimate. For this estimate, assay grades were examined in histograms and probability plots to determine 

levels at which values are deemed outliers to the general population. These cap values were applied by 

metal, by mineralized zone prior to compositing (see Table 14-12). Uncapped and capped composite 

statistics are presented in Table 14-13. 

Table 14-12 AG Zone Grade Capping Levels 

 

Source: Constantine (2018)  

The impact of grade capping can be measured by comparing estimated uncapped and capped block grades 

above a zero cut-off. At Palmer's AG Zone, metal removed by capping is very low reflecting the fact that 

relatively few assays were capped. Metal removed through the capping process amounts to: 0% for zinc, 

3.6% for copper, 0.2% for lead, 4.0% for silver, 0% for gold (uncapped) and 0.1% for barium.

14.3.5 Grade Estimation 

Compared to the Palmer main area resource estimate, the AG Zone is presently interpreted as consisting 

of zones of more continuous mineralization. At the present drill spacing the branching nature of 

mineralization, seen in the main area, is not apparent. Despite that fact, at present there is insufficient 

drilling to calculate meaningful variograms and estimation has been carried out by geometric methods. 

Examination of downhole variograms and based on the experience in the main area, grades were 

interpolated by inverse distance cubed weighting (ID3). Sample search distances and orientations were 

derived to best fit the zones of mineralization. Search details are presented in Table 14-14. 

Table 14-14 Estimation Search Parameters – AG Zone 

 

Source: Constantine (2018)  

Grades for all elements were estimated using a minimum of two and a maximum of 16 samples and a 

maximum of six samples per hole. All grade estimates were hard-bounded by mineralized zone. 

14.3.6 Density Interpolation 

In total, 528 density measurements have been made on core samples within the AG Zone mineralized 

wireframes. The abundance of samples coupled with their variability illustrated that interpolation of density 

values was more appropriate than assignment of a mean value by zone. Density values were estimated by 

inverse distance squared weighting, within each wireframe domain using a minimum of two and a maximum 

of 24 samples and the same geologic controls as for grade estimation – hard bounded by mineralized 

domain. Table 14-15 lists simple statistics of available density measurements, as well as the average 

interpolated block values, by mineralized zone.

14.3.7 Model Validation 

Estimated grades for all elements were validated visually by comparing composite to block values in plan-

view and on cross-sections. There is good visual correlation between composite and estimated block 

grades for all modelled elements. 

As was done for the Palmer main area resource estimate, two additional check models were estimated for 

all metals. To appropriately match the composite length, a nearest neighbour model (NN) was estimated 

using a block size of 6 x 6 x 1.5 m and then re-blocked (4:1) to the resource model grid. Another estimate 

was made by compositing single intervals across mineralization intersections and interpolating grade with 

a nearest neighbour approach. This zone composite model (ZC) produces results akin to a polygonal 

estimate. All models were hard-bounded by mineralized zone.  

The ID3 estimates were compared spatially to the check models, using swath plots. Rather than reproduce 

the plots here, Table 14-16 list results comparing the ID3 estimates to the test models by mineralized 

domain. Globally, model average grades above zero cut-off (shown in the table below) compare very 

closely, indicating no bias. Swath plots did indicate that ID estimates are appropriately smooth in 

comparison to the check models.

14.3.8 Resource Classification and Tabulation 

The current density of exploration drilling is sufficient only for the declaration of an Inferred Mineral 

Resource in the AG Zone; estimated blocks inside the mineralized wireframes are assigned as Inferred 

where estimated by: 

 At least two holes the closest of which is within 75 m (98%), or 

 Composites from at least three holes (1%), or 

 A single hole within 30 m (1%).

Of blocks classified by the first criterion above, 98% of those were estimated by three or more holes. 

AG_Upper blocks were not included in the declared resource as there is presently only one drill intercept 

in the zone. 

Measures were taken to ensure the Mineral Resource meets the condition of "reasonable prospects of 

eventual economic extraction" as required under NI 43-101. Potential extraction of the resource will be by 

underground techniques. The 6 x 6 x 6 m block size is not a true underground selective mining unit and as 

a selectivity test, of by-block versus some larger mining volume, the resource was broken down into groups 

of contiguous blocks and tabled by ZnEq cut-off. For the grouping, blocks were accumulated (at zero cut-

off) by model column/level through the mineralized solids (model rows). Grouped in this way, the 14,700 

blocks were assigned to 4,250 units of grouped blocks. At a 5% ZnEq cut-off, the tonnage and metal content 

of blocks totalled in this way was within 4% of the total by-block, giving credibility to the by-block tabulation 

presented here. 

Block ZnEq values (%) were based on 100% recovery and payable for zinc, copper, lead, silver and gold, 

and metal prices of: 

 Zinc – US$ 1.15/lb 

 Copper – US$ 3.00/lb 

 Lead – US$ 1.00/lb 

 Silver – US$ 16/oz 

 Gold – US$ 1250/oz 

The zinc equivalence formula is: 

ZnEq = (25.3 x Zn% + 66 x Cu% + 22 x Pb% + 0.51 x Ag g/t + 40.19 x Au g/t)/25.3 

The AG Zone resource and contained metal is stated at a cut-off of 5% ZnEq (Table 14-17). A range of cut-

offs are presented for comparison. Barite is included in the tables below as opposed to barium, as that is 

the mineral that will be marketed. The conversion from Ba to BaSO4 is 1.7 times (based on atomic weights).

15 Mining Reserve Estimate 

No Mineral Reserve has been established at the Palmer Project in this report. 

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and have no demonstrated economic viability. This Preliminary 

Economic Assessment does not support an estimate of mineral reserves, since a Pre-feasibility or 

Feasibility Study is required for reporting of mineral reserve estimates. This report is based on mine plan 

tonnage (mine plan tonnes and/or mill feed). 

Mine plan tonnes were derived from the resource model described in the previous section. Measured, 

indicated and inferred mineral resources were used to establish mine plan tonnes. 

Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations 

applied to them that will enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that 

all or any part of the mineral resources within the PEA mine plan will be converted into mineral reserves.

16 Mining Methods 

16.1 Summary 

Mining of the Palmer Project will be conducted using underground mining methods. The potential mine will 

be accessed using the 680 Exploration Portal which will connect with the Palmer deposit at 845 masl. This 

ramp will serve as a personnel and material entry point to the mine, the haulage route from the AG Zone 

deposit to the Palmer deposit, and the primary fresh air source. The transportation of mineralized material 

from the mine to the mill will take place in the 510 Conveyor Drift.  

The Palmer Project hosts two deposits; the Palmer deposit and the AG Zone deposit. The Palmer deposit 

is segregated into three zones; Lower Zone 2-3, Zone 2-3, and Zone 1. All production levels are referenced 

to the drift elevation in regard to elevation in meters above sea level (masl). The Lower Zone 2-3 extends 

from the 848 Level to 628 Level. Zone 2-3 extends from 848 Level to 1128 Level. Zone 1 extends from 

1130 to 1330 Level. The AG Zone deposit extends from the 1000 Level to the 1280 Level. Mining of both 

the Palmer deposit and AG Zone deposit will occur in 20 m vertical increments, and will be connected by a 

primary spiral ramp, sized at 5.0 m W x 6.0 m H and located in the footwall of the deposit. 

The selected mining method for the Palmer deposit will be transverse and longitudinal LH mining with paste 

backfill in the mined-out voids with a primary-secondary stoping sequencing. Thinner portions of the deposit 

will be mined using longitudinal longhole.  

The mine production rate is approximately 3,400 t/d once full production is established in year 3. The 

mineralized material will be crushed underground and transported via the 510 Conveyor Drift to the mill. 

Mineralized material from the Palmer deposit will be fed into the conveyors via the production pass system; 

the AG Zone deposit material will be hauled to the production pass in the Palmer deposit.  

Once a mining panel has been exhausted, the void will be backfilled with a cemented paste backfill 

composed of pyrite tails, de-sulfide tails and run of mine waste rock that is potentially acid generating (PAG). 

Paste backfill originating from pyrite tails will be prioritized for primary stopes. Paste for secondary stopes 

will be composed of the remaining pyrite tails and supplement with de-sulfide tails. Run of mine PAG will 

be deposed in any available open void. The remaining de-sulfide tails will be filtered and placed at the 

tailings storage facility (TSF).  

Non-potentially acid generating (NPAG) rock generated from the mine will be used in the construction of 

site infrastructure and the TSF.  

16.2 Geotechnical Analysis and Recommendations 

16.2.1 Geotechnical Data and Characterization 

Geotechnical specific drilling and testing programs have not yet been carried out for the project; however, 

preliminary geotechnical logging of resource core has been carried out by Constantine since acquiring the 

project. The geotechnical logging was conducted according to the Q rock mass classification system 

(Barton & Grimstad, 1994) including the joint set number (Jn), joint roughness (Jr), and joint alteration (Ja) 

parameters as well as rock quality designation (RQD) and total core recovery (TCR).

The Constantine geotechnical database includes intervals from a total of 11 drillholes within the SW Zone 

1, 21 drillholes from SW Zone 2/3, 4 drillholes from RW East and 6 drillholes from the RW West Zone. 

Complete geotechnical data was available for intervals from four drillholes piercing the southeast AG Zones 

with partial data available for several others. JDS has estimated geotechnical logging parameters using 

core photographs for an additional four drillhole pierces through the AG Zones northwest section in order 

to develop PEA geotechnical design recommendations.  

A scoping-level geotechnical assessment was carried out for the project by Henry Bogert, Ph.D., P.E. 

(Bogert, 2018). The Constantine geotechnical database through end of the 2017 was assessed and data 

was grouped into hanging wall (5 to 6 m), footwall (5 to 6 m) and resource zone for the study. A single Q 

value was calculated from the database to represent the hanging wall, footwall and resource zone for each 

drillhole by averaging the drillhole runs within the respective zone. Each interval was weighted equally, 

regardless of length. Empirical stope design analyses were not carried out as part of the 2018 geotechnical 

scoping assessment. 

It was noted by JDS during review of the database that the Jn parameter used in the Q calculation was 

typically logged by core run rather than by rock type or zone. Often not all joint sets present in a rock mass 

on a stope wall scale are observed in a single run length which can lead to fewer joint sets being logged 

than are actually present. As a result, the Jn values used in the scoping assessment calculations (typically 

0.5 to 3) may be lower than actually exist resulting in unconservatively high Q values. This would likely bias 

the upper bound Q values reported in the scoping study to be higher than actual in-situ values. As a result, 

unusually high values of Q noted in the database were excluded from the statistical calculations used for 

the PEA stope design. The Jn values will need to be reconciled as the project advances to further stages 

of study but are considered reasonable for a PEA-level assessment. 

JDS has used the data developed by Bogert (2018) as the basis of the PEA geotechnical design. The 25th 

and 75th percentile Q' values were used to estimate the range of rock mass quality that may be anticipated 

on a stope wall scale for each zone. The average Q' value as well as the 25th and 75th percentiles are 

summarized in Table 16-1 by zone and deposit. The Q' value, which excludes the third quotient in the Q 

equation (stress reduction factor, Jw/SRF), was used rather than Q, which includes the third quotient, as 

stresses are accounted for separately in the empirical analyses by use of the 'A' (stress) parameter. For 

the mostly shallow deposits at Palmer, the use of the Q value as input to the empirical analyses may result 

in overly conservative estimates of stable stope dimensions.

With the exception of the AG Zone deposit, the overall rock mass quality between the various deposits 

appears to be consistent but highly variable at all of the deposits, based on the geotechnical data available. 

It does not appear that the hanging wall, footwall or mineralized zones consistently exhibit better or worse 

rock quality when compared to the other zones. The rock mass is generally of 'Fair' to 'Good' quality 

according to the Q (Barton & Grimstad, 1994) rock mass classification system. The 'Poor' rock quality zones 

encountered are anticipated to represent local shears or heavily fractured zones. Major fault structures 

have not been modeled for the project to date. 

Based on the available geotechnical data, the southeast portion of the AG Zone deposit appears to be of 

significantly lower rock quality than the northwest portion and the other deposits at Palmer. The rock mass 

at the AG southeast zone is typically of 'Poor' to 'Fair' rock quality according to the Q (Barton & Grimstad, 

1994) rock mass classification system. 

16.2.2 Stope Dimensions 

Maximum stope dimensions were estimated using the Potvin (2001) method for the anticipated range of 

ground conditions and stope dimensions. The Trueman & Mawdesley (2003) 'Stable' line was then used 

as a check against the Potvin (2001) results. Empirical factors used in the calculation of stability numbers 

(N') were based on the following assumptions:  

 Induced stress parameter (A) varied depending on the depth of the stope below ground surface. A 

value of 1.0 (least conservative) was used for the shallow, SW Zone 1, RW and AG stopes, 0.6 to 

0.8 was used for the upper SW Zone 2/3 and 0.4 to 0.6 for the lower SW Zone 2/3 

 Joint orientation factor (B) was set to 0.2 (most conservative) for the stope hanging walls and 

footwalls based on the dominant discontinuity orientation (bedding) being sub-parallel to the 

mineralization and stope walls and,

 Gravity factor, C for stope walls, except for the footwall, was calculated based on the dip of the 

particular wall using the equation: C =8 – 6 cos (face dip angle). The footwall is assigned the 

maximum C value of 8.0 because of its favourable orientation. 

The maximum level spacing was set at 20 m (floor to floor) and the maximum stable lengths and widths 

were then estimated from the stability graph for the stope hanging walls and backs. A maximum hydraulic 

radius was then provided for each stope wall and deposit to be used for mine design as summarized in 

Table 16-2. Figure 16-1 contains output plots from a typical empirical stope stability analysis for transverse 

LH mining of the SW Zone 2/3 deposit, Lower portion.

A minimum 30 m thick crown pillar for SW Zone 1 was estimated based on currently planned stope spans 

and strike lengths, at the top of the deposit. The crown pillar estimate was based on the scaled span method 

(Carter et al, 2008).

16.2.3 Ground Support 

Based on the range of anticipated rock quality (Q' values) as well as the size and expected life and use of 

the various mine openings, ground support requirements were initially assessed according to the Barton & 

Grimstad (1994) criteria. The Q-system also accounts for the life and use of the opening (ex. man-entry or 

equipment only) with the excavation support ratio (ESR) parameter. The ESR is used to adjust the design 

span, in order to obtain the equivalent span for use in the Q Support Diagram; in effect, it imposes a higher 

factor of safety on critical structures with long life (such as an underground nuclear power station with an 

ESR rating of 0.5 to 0.8) than on temporary tunnels (such as temporary mine workings with an ESR rating 

of 2 to 5). An ESR of 1.6 was used for permanent development and man-entry stope development with 

temporary, non-entry stope development assessed assuming an ESR of 3.  

Based on the Barton & Grimstad (1994) criteria, most of the temporary and permanent, non-intersection 

development would require only spot bolting as a minimum to remain serviceable; however, pattern bolting 

and welded wire mesh are recommended to control loose material for all development where miners will 

enter. The ground support recommended for each type of permanent and temporary/ore development 

include: 

 Permanent Development (5 m W x 5 H):

o 2.4 m long #7 resin bolts on 1.5 m ring spacing and 1.5 m within the ring with 6-gauge welded 

wire mesh in back to within 1.5 m of floor 

o Assume 15 % of the all permanent development intersections will require 5 cm of shotcrete in 

addition to bolting 

o Assume 20 % of the all permanent development in the AG Zone deposit will require 5 cm of 

shotcrete in addition to bolting 

 Temporary / Stope Development (5 m W x 5 H): 

o 2.4 m long, 39 mm split sets on 1.5 m ring spacing and 1.5 m within the ring with 6-gauge 

welded wire mesh in back to within 1.5 m of floor 

o No shotcrete required in temporary/ore development. 

16.3 Mine Access and Development 

16.3.1 Portals 

The Mine will have three points of access. The 680 Exploration Portal will grant access for haulage and 

secondary equipment. A cross-cut near the portal entry will be blasted for installation of the main fans and 

heater for fresh air feed. The 510 Conveyor Drift will be used strictly for the transport of mineralized material 

out of the mine and secondary egress for the Palmer deposit. The AG 1000 Ramp will be used for secondary 

egress.  

The portal laydown for the 680 Exploration Portal and 510 Conveyor Drift have been designed with a rock 

slope of 4:1 vertical:horizontal (V:H) with a 5 m catch bench in 10 m vertical intervals. Due to the relatively 

steep terrain, rock fill slopes have been set to 1:1.25 V:H. The 1000 Level Ramp is located on flat terrain, 

no major excavation will be required. A general arrangement of the portals is shown in Figure 16-2 and 

Figure 16-3.

16.3.2 Lateral Development 

The 680 Exploration Portal will be driven to the 848 Level in Palmer deposit, a linear distance of 1,600 m. 

It will be driven with an arched profile at 5.0 m W x 5.0 m H, sized to accommodate the necessary ventilation 

ducting, services and mobile equipment. The ramp will be used for haulage between the AG Zone deposit 

and the Palmer deposit. It will also act as a fresh air feed into the mine, with the primary fan and heater 

located at the portal. Pull outs have been designed every 100 m and the ramp has been designed at a 

maximum gradient of 15%. A general cross section of the mine development headings is shown in Figure 

16-4.

Each working level of the mine will be connected using a 6.0 m W x 5.0 m H spiral ramp located in the 

footwall of the deposit. The spiral ramp will provide fresh air and will connect all levels of the mine, from 

628 masl to 1330 masl. Access to the production pass is at every other level, the spiral ramp will be used 

for haulage of waste and mineralized material to the production pass. The ramp has been designed at 

gradients of 12-15% to accommodate the relatively close level spacing of 20 m with a minimum turning 

radius of 20 m on centre.  

Each mining level will have a 6.0 m W x 5.0 m H footwall drive to allow haul trucks and production LHD's 

to access the stoping cross-cuts. The profile of these will also be arched and shall be located at a minimum 

offset of 10 m from the deposit in the footwall. Stope sill drifts will be driven at 5.0 m W x 5.0 m H with a flat 

back to accommodate remote LHD entry. The sill drift will be spaced in 16 m intervals along the footwall 

drift and driven through the deposit to the hanging wall. The footwall drives will house the majority of 

services including remuck bays, ancillary bays, ventilation raise access, and production pass access. The 

stope sill drifts will be driven for LH drilling, mineral extraction and backfill placement. The footwall drift will 

also contain the electrical sub-stations and a refuge bays, the locations will vary based on current mining 

activities. A plan view of a typical level is shown in Figure 16-5.

16.3.3 Vertical Development 

Vertical development will include a production pass and ventilation raise system for the Palmer deposit and 

the AG Zone deposit. 

The production passes and ventilation raises will be drop raises. A grizzly will be installed at the top of the 

production pass to remove oversize material. In the Palmer deposit, every other level connects to the 

production pass which feeds the jaw crusher. Crushed material is then transported to the mill via the 510 

Conveyor Drift. 

In the AG Zone deposit, the production pass will be fed directly from drives located off the footwall. At the 

bottom of the production pass, material will be loaded onto 30 t trucks and hauled to the production pass in 

the Palmer deposit. 

Fresh air will intake via the 680 Exploration Portal. In the Palmer deposit, the vent raise system will exhaust 

to the adit located at 1230 Level. The secondary egress to the mine will be the 510 Conveyor Drift. 

For the AG Zone deposit, the vent raise system will exhaust to the 1000 Level Ramp. All ventilation raises 

will be equipped with ladders. 

A summary of all vertical development is shown in Table 16-4.

16.4 Mining Method Selection 

Given the outcropping nature and deep vertical extension of the Palmer deposits, several zones were 

reviewed for both open pit and underground potential. Open pit methods were discarded due to the high 

probability of avalanche occurrences, the large disturbance area and high strip ratios. 

16.4.1 Underground Mining Methods 

Longhole stoping was selected for both zones of the Palmer deposit as the principal mining method. In the 

planned LH stopes, a top and bottom drift delineates the stope and blast holes are drilled between the two 

sub-levels via a LH drilling machine. The blast holes are loaded with explosives and the stope is blasted. 

The blasted material is extracted from the bottom drift by conventional and remote mucking with LHDs. 

Several variations of LH stoping will be applied at Palmer, specific to the geotechnical and geometric 

properties of the resource zones. 

 Transverse Longhole 

Where ground conditions are good and the resource average thickness is greater than 8 m but less than 

20 m) as is the case with Zone 1 and 2-3 from the Palmer deposit and the SW zone of AG, transverse LH 

stoping will be used. Transverse LH stopes are mined in a primary / secondary fashion whereby primary 

stopes are mined and filled with a cemented paste backfill. Transverse LH stoping requires a footwall 

access to be driven parallel to the resource to provide cross-cut entries evenly spaced along strike. As 

such, this method requires more non-mineralized development than longitudinal LH stoping but offers 

higher productivity and selectivity given the ability to mine several high grade stopes at once. 

 Longitudinal Longhole 

Where ground conditions are less favourable and the resource width is less than 8 m, longitudinal LH retreat 

(LHR) will be used. LHR mining is a variation on sub-level LH stoping where the long axis of the stope is 

along strike of the mineralized zone. LHR stopes are mined, retreating from the outside-in towards the level 

access. As LHR stopes are mined, they are simultaneously backfilled. Disadvantages to LHR mining 

include higher backfill dilution, lower mineral recovery, and limited selectivity and productivity. Advantages 

include less non-mineralized development.  

The LH mining methods are illustrated in Figure 16-8.

16.5 Mine Design Parameters 

16.5.1 Dilution and Mining Recovery 

Unplanned dilution was estimated for stope hanging walls and footwalls using the equivalent linear 

overbreak / slough (ELOS) method. The rock quality at Palmer is variable between mineralized zones and 

over break parameters were developed for each zone. Each stope received unique dilution parameters 

depending on the geotechnical conditions and orientation. Three types of dilution were evaluated for each 

stope: 

 Floor Dilution – Mucking backfill from the stope below 

 Wall Fill Dilution – Over breaking into adjacent stopes, and 

 Hanging Wall / Footwall Dilution – Over break from the hanging wall and footwall. 

Hanging wall and footwall dilution grades were assigned to all applicable stopes. Average dilution grades 

were derived for each stope from the resource block model. An ELOS value was developed for each zone 

to determine the amount of over break of the HW and FW. Backfill dilution was modelled based on stope 

length and an assumption of 0.5 m dilution from all backfill wall planes. Floor backfill was estimated at 0.3 

m.  

Dilution parameters are listed in Table 16-5 and Table 16-6.

16.5.3 Mine Plan 

To determine the mine plan tonnes at the Palmer deposit, the following process was utilized: 

 Analyze the geologic resource model for geometric properties, such as mineralized zone width, 

depth, length, and continuity 

 Select the mining methods best suited for the deposit based on geometry, economics, and 

geotechnical parameters 

 Determine an economic COV based on expected operating cost, mining recovery, mining dilution, 

and commodity price assumptions 

 Identify the blocks in the model that are above COV, and design production stope shapes around 

these blocks 

 Query the production stope shapes for in-situ tonnage and grade data, apply mine dilution, and 

check the diluted stope grades against the COV, removing all stopes that fall below cut-off and 

 Develop a mine plan around the economically viable production stopes and run economic models 

on various production scenarios. 

The mine plan for the Palmer deposit is a product of multiple runs of Vulcan Underground Stope Optimizer© 

software.  

The total resource contained in the mine is summarized in Table 16-9. These results are based upon 

preliminary mineable stope designs and incorporate the factors for recovery and dilution noted in Section 

16.5.1. This does not constitute a mining reserve, as the mining factors and geometries have been applied 

to inferred resources which are not considered to be sufficiently proven geologically for reliance in an 

economic model.

16.6 Material Handling 

16.6.1 Mineralized Material 

Mucking will be carried out using 10 t LHDs with remote tramming capabilities. Levels with a production 

pass connection, the mineralized material will be trammed and dumped into the production pass system. 

Levels that are not connected to the production pass system, will have mineralized material trammed to a 

re-muck, loaded onto 30 t haul trucks, and hauled and dumped to the nearest production pass. The material 

will be collected at the loading pocket on the 628 Level, crushed and transported out of the mine via 

conveyor to the mill for processing. 

16.6.2 Waste Material 

Development waste rock is classified as one of two types: 

 Non-potentially acid generating (NPAG) and 

 Potentially acid generation (PAG). 

Waste rock will be mucked using 10 t LHDs and will be loaded at cross cuts, into 30 t haul trucks.  

NPAG waste rock will transported to surface via conveyor. This material will be re-handled by the surface 

fleet, primarily to construct the TSF, avalanche berms and other earthworks. 

PAG waste rock will be dump in empty stopes by an LHD were it will mix with the paste backfill. No PAG 

rock will remain on surface at the end of mine life. 

16.7 Backfill 

16.7.1 Paste Backfill 

Paste backfill has been chosen as the primary backfill method. Paste will be distributed throughout the mine 

using overhead steel piping with thicknesses and strengths matched to pressure requirements. The paste 

plant has been sized for a maximum batch production rate of 1,000 m³/d.  

Backfill will consist of cemented paste and run of mine PAG. Primary stopes will be filled with self-standing 

cemented paste backfill composed primarily of pyrite tailings. Secondary stopes will be filled with a 

cemented paste composed of pyrite and de-sulfide tailings. PAG material from development will be 

disposed in any available void. All pyrite tailings and PAG waste will be consumed placed as backfill. De-

sulfide tails will be used to supplement any shortages of pyrite tails and PAG material. 

For primary stopes, a cement binder content of 4% for pyrite tailings and 3% for de-sulfide tailings was 

assumed. For secondary stopes, a cement binder of 1% was assumed for both pyrite and de-sulfide tailings. 

No cement will be added to PAG run of mine material placed as backfill. To contain the paste within the 

stope void, engineered bulkheads will be constructed this will be required for each stope sill drift. 

Paste backfill will be produced on surface at a batch plant located adjacent to the mill. The slurry will be 

pumped via 6-inch pipe. Booster pumps will be located underground to distribute the paste to the desired 

void.

16.8 Mine Services 

16.8.1 Ventilation 

Airflow requirements were estimated based on Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) diesel 

ventilation regulations. Where the engine model could not be sourced in the regulations, Canadian diesel 

ventilation regulations was used. The ventilation requirement was then multiplied by the overall equipment 

utilization and the estimated diesel engine utilization. 

Ventilation for the Mine will be managed through a series of raises and one fresh air intake located at the 

680 Exploration Portal. The Conveyor Drift will act as a secondary egress in the Palmer deposit and the 

1000 Level Ramp will act as a secondary egress for the AG Zone deposit. The fan locations and duty points 

are shown in Table 16-10.

The underground workings will receive fresh air from the Exploration incline cross-cut, with 2 x 250 HP fans 

mounted in parallel. This system will provide approximately 355,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm) of fresh air. 

The air will travel through the decline and will exhaust out at the 1230 Level adit, 1000 Level Ramp, and 

the 510 Conveyor Portal. Exhaust fans will be installed at the 1230 Level adit and 1000 Level Ramp, each 

drawing 175,000 cfm with a 250 HP fans. The ventilation schematic during production is shown in Figure 

16-9 and Figure 16-10. 

The internal ventilation drop raises will be from level to level, with a square 5.0 m x 5.0 m profile. These will 

be developed as the mine progresses and will act as the temporary ventilation network until the mine can 

reach its steady state connection. Regulators will be installed at the entry to the raise to control air flow to 

the desired level. Refer to Table 16-11 for the mine wide airflow requirements.

The above ventilation requirements are the maximum required between the Palmer deposit and the AG 

Zone deposit. First principles ventilation calculations were used to estimate power requirements for the 

ventilation network. Fans were planned as multiples in parallel rather than a single large fan to aid in future 

fan servicing and replacement.

16.8.2 Mine Air Heating 

Mine air would be heated to a minimum +2.0°C by a direct-fired propane heater located at the fresh air 

intake off the exploration ramp. The air would be pulled into the heater drift by the main ventilation fan. 

Intake air would require heating to prevent water from freezing underground and to provide acceptable 

working conditions during operations. Heating calculations were based on average monthly temperatures 

collected at the site weather station. It was estimated that an average 51,700 m3 of propane would be 

required annually. 

16.8.3 Electrical Power 

The majority of electrical power consumption at the mine would arise from: 

 Main and auxiliary ventilation fans 

 Mine air compressors 

 Crushing and conveying 

 Drilling, explosives loading and ground support equipment 

 Dewatering pumps and 

 Refuge stations. 

High-voltage cables would enter the mine via the Exploration and Conveyor portals and would be distributed 

to electrical sub-stations near the mining zones. High-voltage power would be delivered at 4160 V and 

reduced to 480 V at electrical sub-stations. Each working level will include a primary sub-station and power 

panel off the spiral ramp where power will be further stepped down and distributed to the working faces.

16.8.4 Compressed Air and Service Water Supply 

Compressed air will be supplied throughout the mine from a surface compressor. To maintain consistent 

pressures, underground surge tanks will be positioned in ancillary bays at strategic positions throughout 

the mine.  

Service water for drilling and dust control would be sourced from a sump and distributed in 50 mm diameter 

steel piping. 

All water used for underground operations will be drawn from collected mine inflow after solids settlement 

and filtration and re-distributed to the working faces through 152 mm diameter overhead water lines. 

16.8.5 Dewatering 

Groundwater inflows into the mine will vary throughout the year. Increased flow rates can be expected 

during the snowmelt in spring. An average groundwater inflow of 500 gpm (31 L/s) has been assumed from 

the exploration adit and a similar amount from the mining operations at Palmer and AG deposits (estimated 

at 30 L/s). Small sumps have been strategically designed on each level for both the Palmer deposit and the 

AG Zone deposit; these will be gravity fed via boreholes. A main water collection sump would be installed 

at the bottom of the mine near the 510 Conveyor portal. Water collected in the sump would either return 

underground for use or be piped to the water treatment plant. 

Sumps not connected via bore holes will incorporate a small portable 22 kW submersible pump to facilitate 

water flow down to the main collection sump. Portable pumps will be used at the working face to handle 

water from drilling and other mining activities. Other small pumps will be installed in underground 

infrastructure such as shops and crusher chambers. The location of the main collection sump is shown in 

Figure 16-11.

16.8.6 Explosives Storage and Handling 

Primary explosives storage magazines would be located on surface and transported to secondary 

underground magazines. Secondary magazines would be located underground to provide explosives 

storage for up to seven days. Bulk explosives and detonators would be stored in two separate facilities. 

A combination of bulk emulsion and ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) would be used as for mine 

development and production. Explosives handling, loading, and detonation would be carried out by trained 

and authorized personnel.

16.8.7 Fuel Storage and Distribution 

Major mobile equipment, such as haul trucks, LHDs and auxiliary mobile equipment would be re-fueled on 

surface at a fuel station from an Enviro-Tank located close to the 680 Exploration Portal. Drilling equipment 

would be re-fueled underground with a fuel / lube truck. 

16.9 Mine Personnel 

The mine will require a full-time work force of mining, maintenance, services, technical and administrative 

personnel. Mine operations will be run 360 days per annum, 22 hours per day (2 x 11-hour shifts), and 

allowing one hour for smoke clearing between shifts. Mine operations will consist of personnel working two 

different rosters: 

 Two weeks on / two weeks off (2x2): Mine Operations, Maintenance, Construction Labor, Site 

Services (11-hour shifts) 

 Two weeks on / two weeks off (2x2): Mine Technicians, Surveyors, and Grade Control (12 hours 

shift, day shift only) and 

 Four days on / three days off (4x3): Engineering, Administrative, and Management (12-hour shifts, 

day shift only). 

During full production the mine will require 94 people on site, including those on 4x3 rotations, and a total 

payroll of 184 workers.  

Staffing will be ramped up to full production requirements during the first year of operations. Certain 

production related positions are not expected to be necessary during pre-production mine development and 

construction. 

Similarly, some positions, such as training, have been reduced and/or eliminated during the winding down 

period of the final years of operations.  

A summary of the daily on-site personnel required in the ramp-up, peak production and final years is 

presented in Table 16-12. Refer to Figure 16-12 for annual labour requirements.

16.10 Mine Equipment 

16.10.1 Mobile Equipment 

Diesel and electric hydraulic equipment will be employed throughout the mine. The primary haulage fleet 

will consist of 30 t haul trucks and 10 t LHDs for the mineralized material, waste handling, secondary tasks, 

and backfill. Development drilling will be conducted using two-boom jumbos and longhole drilling will be 

conducted using Sandvik DL311 or equivalent drills.  

Equipment requirements were developed from first principles, based on the maximum annual duty hours 

for an individual piece of equipment, modified for mechanical availability and projected utilization. A list of 

the underground production and support equipment and respective factors used in the mine plan are shown

16.11 Mine Plan 

16.11.1 Mine Development Schedule 

The mine development schedule is based on developing the mine to maintain peak production rates. As 

LH stoping is a bottom up mining method and the highest-grade stopes are located at the top of the deposit, 

prioritizing the development for the highest-grade stopes is limited. The schedule has also been designed 

to provide secondary egress and positive ventilation flow throughout the mine prior to production.  

Unit rates for each development and production activity are shown in Table 16-14. The development 

schedule is summarized in Figure 16-13 and Table 16-15.

16.11.2 Mine Production Schedule 

Mine production is expected to commence in year one, at 990 kt mined, approximately 81% of the steady-

state production rate. At steady-state production, the mine is expected produce approximately 1,175 kt per 

annum for 8 years (Years 3 to 11 with production ending in Q2 of Year 11.  

Determining the production rate was a build-up of the various mining activities, including: cycle times for 

the different mining activities, tonnes per vertical metre, and the layout of the mine. The lower production 

rates in Year 1 and 2 are a result of no AG Zone deposit feed. Development to the AG Zone deposit doesn't 

commence until Year 1. 

A summary of the mine production schedule is presented in Figure 16-14 to Figure 16-16 and Table 16-16.

16.11.4 Backfill Schedule 

Backfill will consist of cemented paste and run of mine PAG material. Primary stope will be filled a self-

standing cemented backfill paste composed pyrite tailings. Secondary stopes will be filled with a cemented 

backfill composed of a combination of a pyrite and de-sulfide tailings. Run of mine PAG will be disposed in 

any available open void. All pyrite tailings and PAG run of mine will be consumed within the backfill. De-

sulfide tailings will be used as backfill to supplement any shortages of pyrite tailing and PAG run of mine.

17 Recovery Methods 

The Palmer deposit will process Cu, Zn and Ba concentrates. The recent metallurgical test program on 

Palmer deposit 14063-002 completed at SGS in Burnaby, BC, summarized in Section 13, demonstrates 

that standard Cu, Zn, Py and Ba sequential flotation can produce saleable concentrates. Results from this 

test program were used to develop the corresponding process design criteria, mass balance, mechanical 

equipment list, flowsheet and operating costs. 

The process plant will include:  

 Primary crushing (underground) 

 Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG) mill operating in open circuit 

 Ball mill grinding in reverse closed-circuit with cyclones 

 Sequential Cu, Zn, and Ba flotation circuits, each incorporating conventional flotation, regrind for 

Cu and Zn and three cleaning stages 

 Py rougher flotation, rougher concentrate dewatering and filtration for paste mixing 

 Concentrate dewatering and filtration 

 Concentrate storage and load-out facilities, and 

 Tailings dewatering and filtration for deposition in the filtered tailings facility or paste for 

underground. 

The material from underground from the Palmer deposit at average LOM head grades of 0.81% Cu, 4.24% 

Zn, 13.31% Ba, 0.33 g/t Au and 49.56 g/t Ag will provide a total throughput of 3,500 t/d to the process plant 

for the first few years of the mine life. The same flowsheet will be used for the AG Zone deposit expected 

to be mined at the end of Palmer deposit. The process plant will operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per 

year at an availability of 92%. 

Primary crushing will reduce the material down to a product size of 80% passing (P80) 110 mm. The 

subsequent two stage grinding circuit will target a P80 grind size of 72 µm, before Cu, Zn and Ba are 

recovered into concentrates using sequential flotation. Py concentrate, designated as paste, and Ba 

rougher and Ba 1st cleaner tailings, designated as final tailings, will be pumped to the paste plant for 

dewatering and filtration. 

The process plant will consist of grinding as well as Cu, Zn, Py and Ba flotation circuits. The Cu, Zn and Ba 

will include rougher and cleaner flotation. The Py circuit will produce a rougher concentrate that will be 

mixed with cement to produce paste material for deposition underground. The three saleable concentrates 

will be dewatered in concentrate thickeners and pressure filters to produce a target moisture content of 8% 

and the Cu and Zn will be loaded into bulk concentrate trucks. The Ba concentrate will be dried to a target 

1% moisture, bagged and trucked to Haines for barging to Prince Rupert, BC. 

17.1 Introduction 

The processing facilities will consist of the following unit operations:

17.4 Process Plant Description 

17.4.1 Crushing 

The crushing plant will be located underground and will include a 30" x 42" jaw crusher with an installed 

power of 110 kW. The jaw crusher will process 194 t/h and with a closed side setting (CSS) of 125 mm will 

produce a final product P80 of approximately 110 mm. 

17.4.2 Grinding  

The grinding circuit will consist of a SAG mill followed by a secondary ball mill. The primary SAG mill will 

operate in open circuit, while the secondary ball mill will operate in reverse closed circuit with a cluster of 

hydrocyclones. The grinding circuit has been designed to process a nominal throughput of 159 t/h (fresh 

feed) and produce a final product P80 of 72 µm.  

Product from the crushing circuit will be conveyed from a storage bin to a 4.9 m diameter by 2.7 m long 

SAG mill with an installed power of 895 kW motor. A belt-scale on the feed conveyor will monitor the feed 

rate. Water will be added to the SAG mill to maintain the slurry charge in the mill at a constant density of 

70%. Slurry will overflow from the SAG mill at a transfer size (T80) of approximately 800 µm will flow into 

the cyclone feed pump box.  

Product from the SAG mill screen discharge will combine with the ball mill discharge before being pumped 

up to a cluster of hydrocyclones for size classification. The coarse underflow will flow by gravity to the 

secondary ball mill, 3.4 m diameter by 5.5 m long ball mill with an installed power of 1,119 kW, for additional 

grinding. The fine cyclone overflow, at a final product P80 of 72 µm, will report to the Cu Conditioning Tank. 

The hydrocyclones have been designed for a 300% circulating load. 

17.4.3 Flotation 

 Copper Circuit 

Cyclone overflow will flow by gravity to a Cu conditioning tank, which will provide 2 minutes of conditioning 

time prior to Cu flotation. Frother methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), sulfide collector sodium xanthate (PAX), 

Zn depressant sodium cyanide (NaCN), pH modifier soda ash and zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) will be added to the 

copper circuit. The slurry will then gravitate to the rougher flotation circuit, which consists of five 30 m3 

flotation tanks cells operating in series. 

Cu rougher concentrate will be collected in a common launder and pumped to the regrind circuit. The 

rougher concentrate will feed the regrind mill with the cyclone underflow at a density of 65% solids. The 

cyclone overflow will have a target grind size of P80 of 35 µm and report to the first cleaner flotation circuit. 

Regrind product and the Cu second cleaner tailings will feed seven 10 m3 Cu first cleaner tank cells. The 

Cu first cleaner concentrate will be collected in a common launder and fed to the Cu second cleaner flotation 

circuit. The Cu first cleaner tailings will combine with the Cu rougher tailings and be pumped to the Zn 

conditioning tank. 

The Cu first cleaner concentrate will combine with the Cu third cleaner tailings and flow into the first of four 

5 m3 Cu second cleaner flotation tank cells. The Cu second cleaner concentrate will be collected in a

common launder and pumped to the third cleaner flotation cells, while the Cu second cleaner tailings will 

flow back to the Cu first cleaner flotation feed box. 

The Cu second cleaner concentrate will flow into the first of three 5 m3 Cu third cleaner flotation tank cells. 

The Cu third cleaner concentrate will be collected in a common launder and pumped to the Cu concentrate 

thickener, while the Cu third cleaner tailings will flow back to the Cu second cleaner flotation feed box. 

Cu concentrate from the third cleaners will report to a 6 m diameter Cu thickener. The thickener overflow 

will be sent to the process water tank. Thickened Cu concentrate will be pumped to an 8-hour stock tank 

that feeds a pressure filter for further dewatering. Cu final concentrate, at approximately 8% moisture, will 

be loaded into trucks for transportation to the port for shipment to overseas smelters. 

 Zinc Circuit 

Tailings from the rougher and first cleaner copper flotation circuits will feed a Zn conditioning tank, which 

will provide 3 minutes of conditioning time prior to Zn flotation. Frother methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), 

PAX, pH modifier lime and copper sulfate (CuSO4) will be added to the zinc circuit. The slurry will then 

gravitate to the rougher flotation circuit, which consists of five 20 m3 flotation tanks cells operating in series. 

Cu rougher concentrate will be collected in a common launder and pumped to the regrind circuit. The 

rougher concentrate will feed the regrind mill with the cyclone underflow at a density of 65%. The cyclone 

overflow will have a target grind size of P80 of 50 µm and report to the first cleaner flotation circuit. 

Regrind product and the Zn second cleaner tailings will feed seven 10 m3 Zn first cleaner tank cells. The 

Zn first cleaner concentrate will be collected in a common launder and fed to the Zn second cleaner flotation 

circuit. The Zn first cleaner tailings will combine with the Zn rougher tailings and be pumped to the Py 

rougher circuit. 

The Zn first cleaner concentrate will combine with the Zn third cleaner tailings and flow into the first of four 

10 m3 Zn second cleaner flotation tank cells. The Zn second cleaner concentrate will be collected in a 

common launder and pumped to the third cleaner flotation cells, while the Zn second cleaner tailings will 

flow back to the Zn first cleaner flotation feed box. 

The Zn second cleaner concentrate will flow into the first of four 5 m3 Zn third cleaner flotation tank cells. 

The Zn third cleaner concentrate will be collected in a common launder and pumped to the Zn concentrate 

thickener, while the Zn third cleaner tailings will flow back to the Zn second cleaner flotation feed box. 

Zn concentrate from the third cleaners will report to an 11 m diameter Zn thickener. The thickener overflow 

will be sent to the process water tank. Thickened Zn concentrate will be pumped to a pressure filter for 

further dewatering. Zn final concentrate, at approximately 8% moisture, will be loaded into trucks. 

 Pyrite Circuit 

Tailings from the rougher and first cleaner zinc flotation circuits will be pumped to the pyrite rougher flotation 

which will consists of five 30 m3 flotation tanks cells. Frother methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) and PAX will 

be added to aid in flotation. The rougher concentrate, approximately 24% mass pull, will be thickened in an 

11 m diameter thickener and then filtered. The filtered concentrate, potentially PAG material, will be 

processed as paste for deposition underground. The rougher tailings will feed the Ba flotation circuit.

 Barite Circuit 

Pyrite rougher tailings will feed the Ba rougher flotation circuit, which consists of six 10 m3 flotation tanks 

cells operating in series. Frother methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC), Fuel Oil, Lime and Aero 845 will be added 

to the rougher circuit. 

Rougher concentrate and the Ba second cleaner tailings will feed seven 10 m3 Ba first cleaner tank cells. 

The Ba first cleaner concentrate will be collected in a common launder and fed to the Ba second cleaner 

flotation circuit. The Ba first cleaner tailings will combine with the Ba rougher tailings and be pumped to the 

dewatering circuit for processing as filtered tailings. 

The Ba first cleaner concentrate will combine with the Ba third cleaner tailings and flow into the first of four 

10 m3 Ba second cleaner flotation tank cells. The Ba second cleaner concentrate will be collected in a 

common launder and pumped to the third cleaner flotation cells, while the Ba second cleaner tailings will 

flow back to the Ba first cleaner flotation feed box. 

The Ba second cleaner concentrate will flow into the first of four 10 m3 Ba third cleaner flotation tank cells. 

The Ba third cleaner concentrate will be collected in a common launder and pumped to the Ba concentrate 

thickener, while the Ba third cleaner tailings will flow back to the Ba second cleaner flotation feed box. 

Ba concentrate from the third cleaners will report to a 14 m diameter Ba thickener. The thickener overflow 

will be sent to the process water tank. Thickened Ba concentrate will be pumped to a pressure filter for 

further dewatering. Ba filtered concentrate will be fed into a rotary dryer to reduce the moisture content to 

approximately 1% moisture, bagged and transported to Haines, Alaska. 

17.4.4 Tailings Management Facility 

Ba rougher tailings and Ba first cleaner tailings will combine in the final tailings pump box and be pumped 

to the paste backfill building. The slurry will be dewatered in a 14 m diameter thickener and then filtered. 

The filtered tailings will be either trucked to the filtered tailings facility or processed as paste and pumped 

underground. The thickener underflow and filtrate water will be reclaimed as process make-up water in the 

plant. 

17.4.5 Reagents Handling and Storage 

Reagents added to the flotation circuits will be prepared and distributed from the reagent handling facility. 

This area includes various mixing and storage tank units. All reagent areas will be bermed with sump 

pumps, which can transfer spills to the final tailings pump box or back to the corresponding mix tank. The 

one exception will be the Flocculant preparation area. Flocculant spillage will be returned to the storage 

tank. The reagents will be mixed, stored and then delivered through individual supply loops with dosage 

controlled by flow meters and manual control valves. The reagent storage tanks have been sized with 

capacity to handle one day of production. The reagents will be delivered to the mine site either in powder 

form or as solutions.  

Table 17-2 summarizes the reagents used in the plant and their estimated daily consumption rates. The 

table also includes other major process consumables.

18.2 Roads 

18.2.1 Access Roads 

Access to the Palmer Project will be via Hwy from Haines Alaska, approximately 40 km north to the start of 

an existing gravel access road. From the turnoff, the existing gravel site access road to the project site is 

approximately 20 km. Vehicles are likely to be a combination of buses, personal vehicles (cars, pick-up 

trucks), tractor-trailers, and equipment.  

Improvements to the existing road will be constructed as necessary including proper gradients, widening 

and general cut / fill operations. The road upgrade is approximately 10 km in length. 

18.2.2 Haul and Service Roads 

Haul roads are planned to be upgrades of the existing site exploration access road, and new roads 

constructed for transporting mined material and waste to their designated destinations. The roads will 

connect the mine portals, plant site, mine rock stockpile and TMF/WRSF for the transport of mineralized 

mine rock and waste. Mine haul roads are planned to be constructed to accommodate 35-tonne trucks. 

18.3 Power Supply and Distribution 

18.3.1 Power Generation 

Power necessary to support the Project operation will be supplied by on-site generator sets. A single power 

plant set up comprising five natural gas-fired reciprocating engine generator sets (gensets) in a N+2 

arrangement will provide electricity to operate the mine, processing plant and site infrastructure. Each 

genset will be driven by a 2,500-kW cat engine G3520H (or equivalent) operating at 1,500 rpm and 

generating power at 4.16 kV. 

The power plant and switchgear rooms will be modular units. They will be packaged in walk-in, sound-

attenuated enclosures that are constructed, assembled and tested prior to shipment to site. They will be 

installed with interconnecting all weather walkways as a complete self-contained facility at site. 

An LNG storage facility will be installed ate the power plant site with capacity for approximately 1 week of 

operation. The fuel storage facility will include a vaporizer plant to gasify the LNG before use. The fuel will 

be sourced from existing liquefaction plants in Canada and use tractor trailers for highway transport to the 

project site, via Skagway, then barge to Haines.  

18.3.2 On-site Power Distribution 

On site power will be distributed from the generation station to the plant and portals at 4.16 kV on overhead 

lines. The process plant and site infrastructure facilities will have localized substations to step down voltage 

from 4160 V as required. 

18.4 Process Plant Facility 

The process plant facility will consist of a crushed mineralized rock storage bin, feed conveyor, mill 

processing plant, and tailings filter plant. Refer to Section 17 for the full process plant description.

Page 18-5 

 

The mineralized rock storage bin will be store 24 hrs of material, 3,500 t. The bin will have two reclaim 

feeders, 1 operating and one standby, transferring material to the plant feed conveyor. The plant feed 

conveyor will be 265m long from the mineralized rock bin feeders transfer to the SAG mill feed. 

The process plant building, as shown in Figure 17-2, will be approximately contain the grinding circuits, 

flotation circuits, and concentrate filtration equipment. It will also contain the concentrate load out stations 

for the copper, zinc and barite concentrates. Thickeners and large tanks will be outside along the building, 

within a concrete containment area. Pumps and piping associated with the tanks and thickeners will be 

inside the building or enclosed within the insulated thickener skirting. 

A filtration plant will be located next to the paste plant, which will dewater the tailings and pyrite process 

streams. The pyrite and tailings stock tanks and thickeners will be outside within and concrete containment 

area. The filtration plant building will contain the filtration equipment, pumps and auxiliary equipment, and 

filtration discharge. Filtered pyrite tails will be kept within a contained area before reclaiming to use as paste 

backfill. Filtered tails material will be stockpiled outside and reclaimed for either paste backfill or loaded 

onto haul truck for delivery to the TMF/WRSF. Filtered tailings and pyrite material handling will be by site 

services mobile equipment and operators for transfer to the paste plant or the tailings facility. 

18.5 Ancillary Facilities 

18.5.1 Warehouse and Maintenance Shop Building 

A separate building will be on the plant site for warehouse storage and the plant and surface facilities 

maintenance. It will have concrete foundation and concrete slab floor, lighting, heating and ventilation.  

18.5.2 Cold Storage Warehouse 

A sprung structure building will be erected for storage of parts and bulk materials requiring protection from 

the elements. It will be unheated with gravel floor, and concrete block foundation. 

18.5.3 Assay Laboratory 

An assay laboratory will be located in a separate building or attached to the main office / warehouse. This 

facility will serve the plant's assay, environmental, metallurgical requirements and underground grade 

control needs. The laboratory will consist of pre-fabricated modules and ancillary equipment, such as drying 

ovens, dust and fume control, and heating equipment. 

18.5.4 Mine Dry and Office Complex 

A separate two storey pre-engineered building will be on the plant site for operations office and mine dry 

facility. The lower level will serve as the personnel dry for the plant and mine operations, and the upper 

level will serve as the site administration and technical office facility. 

The mine dry facility will service construction and operations staff during the life of the project. It will be set 

up with the following, with separate areas for male and female staff: 

 Change areas with lockers and hanging baskets 

 Showers and washroom facilities

 Operations line-up area 

18.5.5 Fuel Storage 

On-site diesel fuel storage will be installed on site with approximately one-week supply capacity. Two 

40,000 L tanks will be installed within a lined containment berm, in addition to the existing tank already in 

use for exploration. Fuel dispensing equipment for mining, plant services, and freight vehicles will be located 

adjacent to the fuel tank bund and the fueling area will drain into the bund. A fuel transfer module will 

provide fuel to the power plant day tank and diesel consumers in the process plant.  

18.6 Development Waste Rock Management 

Potentially acid generating (PAG) waste rock from underground workings will primarily be disposed of as 

backfill in the underground workings. During the initial years, some PAG waste rock will be temporarily 

stored, until adequate space is available underground, in a segregated lined PAG rock storage / ore 

stockpile facility (capacity 400 kt) located on-surface at the processing plant. Runoff from the temporary 

facility will be treated by a Water Treatment Plant (WTP) located in the process plant. 

The majority (93%) of non-potentially acid generating (NPAG) waste rock from development drifting will be 

disposed of on-surface and used for construction of protective outer berms around the perimeter of the 

TMF/WRSF. Based on geochemical testing, for the PEA it was assumed that neutral leaching will not occur 

from the NPAG waste rock and this material can be placed in the TMF/WRSF.  

18.7 Tailings and Waste Rock Facilities 

Design of a non-sulfide tailings management and NPAG waste rock storage facility (TMF/WRSF), along 

with the associated surface water management features, were developed by Klohn Crippen Berger Ltd. 

(KCB). The TMF/WRSF is located approximately 6 km northeast of the Conveyor Portal (see Figure 18-3).

18.7.1 Site Selection 

Conceptual designs for tailings and waste rock management alternatives were developed by KCB for twelve 

candidate sites. These siting alternatives along with potential tailings disposal methods were assessed 

using a screening approach to review siting and disposal alternatives against design criteria requirements. 

Filtered tailings with waste rock placed as outer containment berms in the same lined facility was selected 

as the preferred waste management method.  

The five siting alternatives that passed initial screening were ranked using a semi-quantitative Multi-Criteria 

Analysis (MCA) method to score and select the preferred site. The ranking criteria used included: permitting 

(land tenure, wetlands); social (visibility from highway); environmental (presence of wetlands and 

watercourses, footprint size); water management (catchment area); geotechnical foundation conditions 

(based on assumed interpretation of sites); constructability (% structural fill based on topography); closure; 

total capital; and operational costs (based on haul distance, ratio of structural to non-structural zones and 

potential need for ground improvement).  

The ranked merit scores developed within the MCA indicated that a TMF/WRSF site in the TMF-7C area is 

the preferred site (see Figure 18-4). An additional design optimization process was completed to develop 

a TMF/WRSF design that completely avoids water courses and an unconnected wetland adjacent to the 

area.

18.7.2 Design Basis 

A flotation process that produces a desulfurized tailings stream and a pyrite tailings stream will be used in 

the plant. Approximately 78% of the tailings production will be used for paste backfill. The pyrite tailings 

stream will be only used for backfill. The desulfurized tailings are classified as NPAG and do not have 

neutral leaching characteristics based on geochemical testing performed to date. Initial geochemical 

laboratory testing on tailings samples included acid base accounting (ABA), inductively coupled plasma 

(ICP), whole rock characterization, shake flask and quantitative x-ray diffraction (XRD). Only desulfurized 

tailings will be stored on surface in the TMF/WRSF. 

Life of mine total tailings production requiring storage on surface will be approximately 1,830,000 tonnes 

along with 1,110,000 tonnes of NPAG waste rock also stored on surface. The following summarizes the 

design basis for the TMF/WRSF: 

 The TMF/WRSF will have capacity to store the tailings and NPAG waste rock that is not used in 

backfill operations.  

 The TMF/WRSF will not be constructed over areas that may be considered "jurisdictional" wetlands 

by the USACE, or over "intermittent streams", as identified in mapping by HDR (2018). 

 1,830,096 tonnes of non-sulfide tailings will be stored in the TMF/WRSF. The assumed average 

dry density of the tailings is approximately 1.7 t/m3, resulting in a volume of 1,101,884 m3. 

 1,108,065 tonnes of NPAG waste rock will be stored in the TMF/WRSF. The assumed dry density 

of the waste rock is 2.1 t/m3, resulting in a volume of 540,520 m3. 

 Tailings filter presses located at the mill site will be used to dewater tailings and prepare them for 

transport to the TMF/WRSF or for use in backfill.  

 A tailings storage shed located at the mill site will provide capacity for approximately 5 days of 

tailings production destined for the TMF/WRSF in the event of an operational upset or inclement 

weather that prevents transportation and placement of tailings at the TMF/WRSF.  

 The base of the TMF/WRSF will be lined with an engineered low-permeability layer to limit migration 

of tailings and waste rock-impacted seepage into the groundwater. At closure, the TMF/WRSF will 

be covered with a low-permeability closure cover and protected from erosion. 

 The TMF/WRSF will meet applicable regulatory and guideline stability requirements. The maximum 

design earthquake (MDE) is defined for the PEA as the 1 in 2,475-year return period event (with 

PGA = 0.7 g, based on USGS mapping). 

 Contact water from the TMF/WRSF will be collected in ditches and a pond and either treated or 

discharged, depending on water quality.  

 Non-contact water will be diverted around disturbed areas where practical. 

 The environmental design flood (EDF) (1 in 200-yr return period event) is defined as the flood event 

that must be stored and routed through a treatment facility. The inflow design flood (IDF) is defined 

as the 1 in 1,000-yr return period event.  

18.7.3 Design Features 

Key features of the TMF/WRSF during start-up and operations are shown on Figure 18-5 and include:  



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

For CONSTANTINE METAL RESOURCES LTD. 

Page 18-11 

 

 Riprap-lined diversion ditches upstream of the pile to convey non-contact water around the pile. 

 A waste rock and filtered tailings pile that includes both structural and non-structural zones. Waste 

rock is assumed to be placed in structural zones due to its coarser gradation, which makes it less 

susceptible to over-wetting and greater frictional strength compared to filtered tailings. 

 Underdrain system comprised of a network of rockfill underdrains installed in the native foundation 

materials that reduce uplift pressure on the low-permeability layer during construction. Water 

collected in the underdrains will be discharged to the environment.  

 Low-permeability layer (assumed to be a geomembrane liner) placed over the prepared foundation 

of the TMF/WRSF to prevent migration of tailings/waste rock impacted water into the groundwater. 

The liner is underlain by a granular bedding layer placed over the foundation to provide access for 

liner installation equipment and a smooth surface for liner deployment. The requirements for the 

low-permeability layer will be reviewed in future design stages once the geochemical risk of the 

waste rock and tailings is better understood.  

 Service layer comprised of granular fill placed on top of the low-permeability layer to allow 

construction equipment to access the TMF/WRSF without damaging the low-permeability layer. A 

potential optimization to consider is use of tailings for the service layer, which may aid to reduce 

seepage rate through liner defects. 

 Above liner drainage system comprised of rockfill finger drains and/or blanket drains in the footprint 

of the waste rock structural zones to provide pile toe area drainage. Water collected in this drainage 

system will report to the collection pond. 

o Modeling of tailings-liner-drain systems by KCB in conjunction with laboratory testing at 

Queen's University (Joshi and McLeod 2018) has shown that in contrast to typical landfill 

design, liners under tailings perform better without above liner drainage, since tailings more 

effectively seal liner defects if there is no above liner drainage present. For this reason, the 

above liner drainage system is not extended under the tailings portions of the pile. 

 Geomembrane or concrete-cloth lined collection ditches downstream of the pile to collect pile runoff 

that report to the collection pond. 

 A Contact Water Collection Pond (CWCP) located downstream of the pile to collect contact water 

conveyed by contact water ditches and the above liner drainage system. Water collected in the 

pond can be treated and/or discharged, depending on water quality. For the PEA it is assumed that 

the water is discharged to a land application disposal (LAD) downstream of the CWCP. 

 Geochemical analysis of tailings samples indicate that the tailings are NPAG and of low risk for 

neutral leaching; therefore, treatment of contact water is assumed not to be required. However, the 

tailings, waste rock and associated water management facilities have been designed to allow for 

collection of contact water should treatment be necessary. 

 A truck wash is assumed to not be required at the TMF/WRSF based on geochemical 

characterization of the tailings and waste rock. As the geochemical characterization of the materials 

placed in the TMF/WRSF is advanced, this assumption should be revisited.

18.7.4 Construction Methods 

Placing tailings and waste rock in the same facility, and utilizing waste rock in exterior structural zones, has 

several desirable features. These include: 

 The higher hydraulic conductivity of the outer berms of waste rock results in well-drained perimeter 

slopes which improves stability. 

 Waste rock is more erosion resistant than tailings and, when placed at the closure slope angle, 

allows for the reclamation cover to be progressively extended during operations. Depending on the 

gradation of the waste rock, a filter zone(s) may be required between the filtered tailings and waste 

rock to prevent tailings migration. 

 Presence of the higher strength waste rock in structural zones reduces the requirements for tailings 

compaction, which allows tailings placement under a wider range of climatic conditions. Note that 

tailings may also be used for structural zones, as is the case at the Greens Creek facility (Condon 

and Lear 2006), provided weather conditions are amenable to achieving sufficient compaction to 

preclude liquefaction. 

 The availability of waste rock allows for construction of waste rock roads on the tailings surfaces, 

which improves trafficability and facilitates tailings placement. 

 The production rate of waste rock will vary throughout the mine life with a greater production rate 

in the initial development years and a lower production rate towards the end of the mine life. Waste 

rock berms can be placed in outer sections of the pile in advance of tailings placement to reduce 

the need for stockpiling and double handling and may be utilized to construct a waste rock toe 

starter berm that can facilitate initial placement of tailings.  

18.7.5 Layout and Staging 

The three-dimensional modeling software, Muck 3D (Minebridge 2017), was used to develop the 

TMF/WRSF layout (see Figure 18-5) based on the volume requirements and other design criteria. Key 

observations from the modeling include: 

 The maximum toe-to-crest height of the pile is approximately 50 m.  

 The maximum thickness of the tailings is approximately 30 m.  

 For modelling purposes, the pile was assumed to be constructed in horizontal lifts. Stage-storage 

curves based on horizontal raising for the structural and non-structural zones based are shown on 

Figure 18-6. The structural zone of compacted tailings is approximately 55% of the total pile 

volume.

18.7.6 Pile Stability 

A section through the highest portion of the TMF/WRSF pile was selected as the critical stability section as 

shown on Figure 18-7. Stability of the pile was assessed using the limit-equilibrium modeling software, 

Slope/W (GeoStudio 2018) for the following scenarios:  

 Static: effective friction angles applied to both waste rock and tailings; no seismic loading. 

 Liquefied/post cyclic: effective friction angle applied to waste rock; liquefied/residual undrained 

shear strength applied to tailings in non-structural zones; no seismic loading. 

 Pseudo-static: 80% of the effective friction angle applied to tailings and waste rock; horizonal 

seismic coefficient equal to 50% of the peak ground acceleration (PGA) (0.7 g).

The target limit-equilibrium Factors of Safety (FOS) are summarized in Table 18-1 along with the calculated 

FOS. Key conclusions from the analysis are summarized below: 

 The critical slip surface for scenarios analyzed was along the geomembrane liner interface.  

 Stability criteria were achieved for the static and post-cyclic/liquefaction scenarios assuming a 

structural zone constructed from waste rock, with the dimensions and slope angles as shown on 

Figure 18-7. 

 The analysis assumes that the foundation will be non-liquefiable by either static or seismic loading. 

The pile was strategically sited on the glacial moraine terraces as these materials are less likely to 

be potentially liquefiable than the alluvial sediments on the lowlands closer to the Klehini River. If 

potentially liquefiable materials are identified in future site investigations, mitigations such as 

foundation improvement techniques, shallowing of outer slopes or installation of a foundation shear 

key may be required.

18.7.7 Water Balance  

The CWCP has a peak monthly excess of water of 85 L/s. The highest monthly average flow is the 28 L/s 

freshet flow in April. The annual average excess of water is 6 L/s. The LAD was designed to discharge the 

peak monthly excess with some contingency (100 L/s).  

18.7.8 Closure Plan 

The TMF/WRSF will be constructed in a phased approach to allow progressive covering and reclamation. 

Once mine production is complete the TMF/WRSF will be entirely covered with a low permeability cover, 

an erosion protective layer and revegetated. Upon closure there will be no exposed tailings and contact-

water runoff will cease. The period of post-closure TMF/WRSF water management will depend primarily on 

pile seepage water volume and quality. Long-term water treatment or monitoring is not expected to be 

required.  

                                                      
1 Pseudo-static analyses are not intended to simulate limit equilibrium conditions but, rather, are considered to provide a preliminary 
seismic deformation screening analysis. Indeed, the various methods of pseudo-static analyses published in the literature are often 
associated with a particular magnitude of seismic deformation which is purported to not be exceeded if the seismic coefficient and 
material strength parameters are selected in accordance with the particular method and the specified minimum pseudo-static FOS is 
met. A pseudo-static FOS below criterion does not indicate failure but, rather, indicates that the seismic deformations could exceed 
those implied by the particular method used. In that case, a more rigorous seismic deformation analyses should be conducted. This 
will be assessed for the Project in future design stages.

18.8 Water Management 

Using site climate data, longer term climate databases and climate models conducted a hydrology 

assessment was conducted and compiled storm runoff and snow accumulation as inputs to a site wide 

monthly water balance used to inform facility design. Water management facilities are shown on Figure 

18-3. 

The site wide water balance includes recharge-based estimates of sustained flows from the Exploration 

Portal and Conveyor Portal and effects of precipitation (i.e., runoff from TMF/WRSF facility, direct 

precipitation on the associated pond, mill site runoff, process reclaim and excess waters and underground 

drill water).  

18.8.1 Surface Water Management 

The primary objectives of the surface management are to: 

 Minimize short and long-term geochemical and water quality risks; 

 Divert as much non-contact water around disturbed areas as practical to reduce contact water 

volumes, limit erosion and ponding/flooding; and maintain flow in natural watercourses; and 

 Collect contact water that may contain high concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) for 

settlement and/or other contaminants for treatment if required.  

Key features of the site-wide surface water management include are summarized below. Surface water 

management features associated with the TMF/WRSF are described in Section 18.7: 

 A WTP located at the mill site with associated collection ponds: the Millsite Water Treatment Pond 

(MWTP) and Millsite Sediment Pond (MSP). 

 A diversion ditch located upslope of the mill site that diverts non-contact water from the upstream 

catchment to natural water courses. 

 Contact water ditches that surround the mill site and report to associated collection ponds. 

 Ditches currently in place that flank the Access Road / Transportation Corridor. 

A general arrangement, highlighting the locations of most of these water management features is shown 

on Figure 18-3. Mill site surface water management features are shown on Figure 18-8.

18.8.2 Management of Underground Water 

Exploration Portal 

Hydrogeological studies and flow estimates for the Exploration Portal outflows were completed by Tundra 

Consulting (Tundra 2018). This study was based on hydraulic conductivity measurements from packer 

testing, water levels and analytical calculations based on a conceptual hydrogeology model. An analytical 

estimate for the first 1.25 km section of adit was completed.  

Outflows estimated by Tundra were used by BGC (BGC 2018) as a basis to design sediment ponds for 

outflows from the Exploration Portal. For conservativism, a sustained flow rate of 32 L/s from the entire 

Exploration Portal was assumed by Constantine as a basis for this work. For sizing of pumping and ponds, 

a flow rate of 190 L/s was assumed to account for potential higher hydraulic conductivities in the final 

sections of the adit and provide a factor of safety for design. Pond storage capacity was designed by BGC 

to contain the 100-year return period 24-hr storm from inflow to the surface catchment of the pond. The 

emergency spillway was designed for the 190 L/s design flow rate.  

Outflow from the ponds will be routed via a gravity pipeline to a LAD with peak LAD capacity of 50 L/s (BGC 

2018). KCB water management designs added a pipeline between the Exploration Adit Settling Pond 

(EASP) and the Mill Site Water Treatment Pond (MWTP), which can be used during periods when inflow 

rate to the EASP exceeds LAD capacity (see Figure 18-9). This pipeline can also be used to route drainage 

from the lined temporary PAG rock storage pad (located next to the EASP) to the MWTP if treatment of pad 

runoff is required. 

Conveyor Portal 

The geometry of the mine workings will include a lower production portal for the ore transport conveyor and 

spiral ramps providing access to SW and RW zone stopes situated both above and below the exploration 

adit. At the PEA level, it is appropriate to estimate portal outflows from the development of the workings 

using a water balance approximation based on recharge from total annual precipitation applied to 

appropriate infiltration areas. This approach allows the estimation of an upper bound of sustainable steady 

state flows.  

Conservatively assuming a high annual infiltration fraction of 0.5 of total precipitation (fractured alpine 

terrain with little or no fines in soil), the estimated sustained outflow from the mine workings is 15 L/s. To 

allow for potential uncertainties the flow estimate was doubled (to 30L/s) which is comparable to the flow 

rate used for design of the Exploration Portal LAD (BGC 2018).  

Given that the estimated flow from the workings are comparable to the flow used in the design of the LAD 

system, these additional flows will be treated by a comparable LAD section in an extension to the LAD 

system (see Figure 18-9).  

18.8.3 Water Treatment 

Flows from the Conveyor Portal, wastewater from the mill, and runoff from the temporary PAG waste rock 

storage pile are assumed to require treatment. Treatment will be provided by a WTP located at the mill site, 

with design details developed by JDS. It is planned to be a high-density sludge (HDS) treatment system to 

remove metals, with allowances for micro filtration, clarification, and dewatering of the resultant sludge. The 

design of the WTP allows for the following: 

 Multimedia filtration (MMF) 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 18-19 

 

 Chemical and pH treatment to promote metals precipitation 

 Clarification 

 Sludge dewatering of clarifier underflow and MMF backwash 

 Ammonia removal 

 pH control prior to release to environment 

The WTP monthly water balance has a peak monthly excess of water of 67 L/s. The highest monthly 

average flow is the 40 L/s freshet flow in April. The annual average excess of water is 32 L/s.  

To provide capacity above the peak flows, the WTP is assumed to require a peak capacity of 70 L/s. 

Discharge from the WTP is directed to an extension of the LAD as shown on Figure 18-9. The LAD facilities 

situated above the mill site were initially designed by BGC and subsequently expanded by KCB to increase 

capacity for discharge of excess project water.

18.9 Temporary Mine Rock Stockpile 

JDS has provided a preliminary design for a temporary mine rock stockpile (TMRS) that will be set up near 

the plant site to store PAG mine rock temporarily. Mined mineralized rock and waste will both be stored at 

this location before being reclaimed for processing or use underground as backfill. The facility will be 

constructed and operated to store the materials separately and avoid contact between them. 

18.9.1 Design Features 

The facility will be designed and constructed to accommodate approximately 40,000 m3 of mineralized rock 

and 160,000 m3 of PAG mine development rock, for a total of 200,000 m3 capacity. It includes a High-

Density Polyethylene (HDPE) geomembrane liner lain atop a gravel cushion to contain contact material and 

water. Specific features of the design include: 

 Foundation drainage system 

 Fully lined area to minimize seepage losses 

 PAG material water collection drain system and ditch conveyance to the MWTP 

 Foundation Drain 

A foundation drain will be installed below the geomembrane liner to collect groundwater flows and seepage. 

Collected water will drain to a contact water conveyance ditch.  

The foundation drain comprises interconnected perforated pipes surrounded by drain gravel. The 

foundation drain will be constructed using processed material generated from local borrow sources and will 

be constructed beneath the TMRS liner bedding layer. 

 HDPE Liner 

The entire area, including the upstream face of the storage pads and the downstream collection ditches of 

the PAG storage area, will be lined with 80-mil HDPE geomembrane. The liner system incorporates a 

prepared subgrade comprising processed bedding material, which is expected to be fine-grained material 

with no rocks that can damage the HDPE liner. The HDPE geomembrane is effectively impermeable, with 

seepage only possible through defects that may occur during fabrication and/or installation. 

 Rock Storage Underdrain 

A rock storage area underdrain will be installed above the geomembrane to collect contact water and 

convey it to the contact water conveyance ditch. The conveyance ditch will drain to the MWTP. 

The underdrain will be constructed using processed material from local borrow sources. The underdrain 

includes perforated drainpipes within a free draining surround. A 300 mm thick layer of filter material will be 

placed around the drainpipes to assist in providing drainage and protecting the HDPE geomembrane liner. 

18.10 Off-site Facilities 

18.10.1 Accommodations 

The operation personnel will be largely will be based on personnel living in or nearby Haines. Transportation 

via bussing will be provided for employees from Haines to site during operations.

19 Market Studies and Contracts 

19.1 Market Studies 

No market studies have been completed for the project at this time. Except for barite, all commodities 

considered in this Study are regularly sold commercially on vast international markets. As the Palmer 

concentrates are clean, that is relatively free of contaminants, competitive treatment charges are anticipated 

with relatively easy sales to open markets. 

19.2 Contracts

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or 

Community Impacts 

This section summarizes the existing environmental information for the Palmer Project area, describes the 

major mine permits that may be required to develop the Project into a mine, and describes social and 

community considerations for the Project. 

20.1 Environmental Studies 

The Palmer Project area includes lands within Glacier Creek valley within the Klehini River drainage.  

Environmental baseline monitoring has been conducted in the area starting in 2008 with formal reporting 

starting in 2013. The primary objectives of the baseline monitoring are to characterize the natural 

environment and identify reference locations for comparison throughout the Project life to assess impacts.  

To date, a moderate amount of baseline environmental data collection has occurred in the area including 

surface water quality sampling, surface hydrology monitoring, wetlands mapping, stream flow monitoring, 

aquatic life surveys, avian and mammal habitat surveys, cultural resource surveys, hydrogeology studies, 

meteorological monitoring, and acid base accounting studies. The existing data are summarized in Sections 

20.1.1 to 20.1.9. 

20.1.1 Surface Hydrology  

Constantine has been monitoring surface water flows (aka hydrology) at 11 sites in Glacier Creek since 

2014. These monitoring sites and two USGS stream gauge sites are illustrated on Figure 20-1.  

The Palmer Project is centered within the Glacier Creek watershed that drains into the Klehini River. The 

Klehini River flows into the Chilkat River approximately 14 miles downstream of confluence of Glacier Creek 

with the Klehini River. The Klehini River follows a large braided channel that runs from west to east along 

the northern property boundary. Within the larger Palmer property, the names of the stream systems are 

Jarvis Creek, Little Jarvis Creek, Sarah Creek (also informally called Pump Valley Creek), and Glacier 

Creek. Outside the project area water levels are measured at two USGS stations and Constantine's station 

P14B and water flow is measured at Constantine station KR (Figure 20-2).  

Glacier Creek and its tributaries provide the primary drainage within the Palmer project boundary, ultimately 

flowing into the Klehini River. Individual flow measurements on Glacier Creek from 2015 and 2016 ranged 

from 41 ft3/s to 471 ft3/s, roughly 10% to 20% of the Klehini River discharge volume.

Figure 20-1: Surface Water Flow Monitoring Stations 

 
Source: Constantine (2019) 

The highest discharge measurements in the Glacier Creek drainage were collected in the month of June, 

while the lowest discharge was measured in October, like the regional patterns observed in the Klehini 

River hydrograph. 

Integral Consulting Inc. evaluated regional (Chilkat River and Klehini River) and localized (Glacier Creek 

and tributaries) surface water hydrology patterns based on stream discharge and meteorological data 

(Integral, 2016). The following paragraphs are excerpted from their report. Surface water in the region 

exhibits seasonal and diurnal patterns due to the influences of snowmelt, rainfall events, and ambient air 

temperature. 

Integral interprets the hydrograph data to recognize two seasonal patterns. The first pattern illustrates the 

dominant character of the Klehini River watershed, whereby snowmelt runoff drives annual peak stream 

discharge in the spring. The onset of peak flow occurs quickly in the late spring to early summer months, 

generally late April through June. The onset of peak flows also occurs when average daily air temperatures 

routinely exceed freezing and when total monthly precipitation is lowest. The combined effect of above-

freezing temperatures and low precipitation is reflected in the sharply rising limb of the discharge 

hydrograph. During the period following peak flow (the declining limb), beginning in the early summer 

months until early fall, stream discharge gradually declines as the snowpack recedes and average daily air 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 20-3 

 

temperatures approach freezing. Klehini River discharge remains near base flow throughout the winter and 

early spring months, typically from November to April. During this time, individual precipitation events 

produce short-lived increases in stream discharge above base flow. 

A second seasonal pattern can be seen in the Klehini River hydrograph for most years, when river discharge 

shows a secondary peak in late fall. The late fall peak discharge events occur when total monthly 

precipitation begins to increase and before average daily temperatures dip below freezing. The increase, 

and subsequent decline in late fall discharge, occur over a much shorter period of time than the first peak 

discharge cycle because individual precipitation events, rather than snowmelt runoff, provide runoff for the 

late fall peak flow.  

Stream discharge measurements taken at Glacier Creek downstream stations P6 and LG and midstream 

station GC show seasonal changes like the Klehini River hydrograph. The higher discharge measured at 

Glacier Creek stations in summer months corresponds to periods of peak flows driven by snowmelt, but 

little rainfall. The relatively lower discharge measured in October 2016 corresponds to the decreasing limb 

of the Klehini River hydrograph as temperatures cool, snowpack is diminished, and the influence of 

snowmelt decreases. 

Integral (2016) also recognized diurnal trends. During the warmer spring, summer, and fall months, when 

average air temperature remains above freezing, diurnal discharge patterns are apparent for the Klehini 

River. Hourly Klehini River stage and ambient air temperature measured from. For example, during the 

period May 20th to 27th, 2015, during a period of peak stage and when there was no measurable 

precipitation, daily maximum air temperatures occurred in the late afternoon, while daily maximum stage 

was observed from late night to early morning. This diurnal pattern suggests gradually increasing rates of 

snowmelt runoff through the daylight hours in response to increasing air temperature followed by a lag in 

the peak stage (Integral 2016). Peak stage and streamflow discharge lag peak temperature because of 

increased travel times required for runoff to move through tributaries upstream from the Klehini River gage 

station. Average daily temperatures are below freezing from December through March. Clear diurnal 

patterns are not apparent during these colder winter months. 

20.1.2 Surface Water Quality  

Constantine has been monitoring surface water quality by collecting samples from up to 27 stations since 

2008. Those stations are illustrated in Figure 20-2. Constantine's consultant, Integral Consulting, prepared 

a summary water quality memorandum for the period 2008 – 2016. Surface water samples are collected 

from flowing water (away from eddies and interferences). Unfiltered surface water samples are collected 

as grabs (not composited) from the stream using native-water rinsed non-reactive collection containers. 

Filtered surface water samples are collected using a peristaltic pump with a 0.45-µm filter placed in-line at 

the tubing outlet to filter samples immediately before the water was discharged into the sample bottle. 

Alternatively, if an in-line filter and peristaltic pump was not available or practical for the sample collection, 

samples were filtered manually through a 0.45-µm syringe filter. Immediately after filling, the sample 

containers were capped, labeled, and placed inside a cooler. Detailed sample collection, handling, and 

analysis information is presented in the Palmer project Quality Assurance Protection Plan (QAPP).

Figure 20-2: Surface Water Quality Sample Location Map 

 
Source: Constantine (2019) 

Measurements of conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity were collected in the field 

at all sampling stations in accordance with the QAPP. A YSI 556 multi-probe was used for dissolved oxygen, 

pH, temperature, and conductivity measurements. A LaMotte 2020 turbidity meter was used for turbidity 

measurements. Measurements were recorded when the field instrumentation readings stabilized. Field 

instruments were maintained, cleaned, and calibrated with standard reference solutions per the 

manufacturer's specifications. Field instrument standard operating procedures (SOPs), manuals, and 

calibration log forms are presented in the Palmer project QAPP. Solids settling samples were collected in 

the field and analyzed as described within the project QAPP. 

The following parameters are typically measured in baseline surface water samples:  

 Field parameters – Field measurements of general water quality characteristics, including 

conductivity, dissolved oxygen, oxygen-reduction potential (ORP), pH, temperature, and turbidity, 

were taken at all sampling stations, in accordance with the QAPP (Integral 2015).  A YSI 556 multi-

probe was used for dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and conductivity measurements. A LaMotte 

2020 turbidity meter was used for turbidity measurements. If these instruments were not available, 

equivalent instruments that meet method requirements were used and calibrated per the 

manufacturer instructions.  

 Conventional parameters – Conventional analyses performed by the ALS laboratory included 

acidity, hardness as CaCO3, total dissolved solids (TDS), and total suspended solids (TSS).  



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 20-5 

 

 Solids Settling– Solids settling results are presented with conventional parameters. The solids 

settling samples were collected in the field and analyzed following Standard Method 2540F (SM 

1997). The solids settling analysis was performed as soon as possible following the sampling event. 

Solids settling concentrations were determined using the Imhoff cone volumetric technique to 

measure the mass of solids that settle from 1 L of water in a 60-minute period. The solids settling 

measurement SOPs are presented in the Palmer project QAPP (Integral 2015).  

 Cations/anions – Major cations and anions typically analyzed included alkalinity as CaCO3, 

bromide, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, combined nitrate/nitrite, sulfate, and ammonia.  

 Total/Dissolved Metals – Thirty-three metals were analyzed for both the total and dissolved fraction. 

For all metals except cadmium, the laboratory reports and/or validator-assigned concentration detection 

limits are below the Alaska water quality standards. This indicates that the analytical methods used meet 

the Data Quality Objectives (DQO) outlined in the project QAPP are appropriate, and that the baseline data 

set is acceptable for comparison to aquatic life standards. For dissolved cadmium, four samples were 

undetected by the laboratory at a detection limit of 0.25 µg/L: samples P8 and P14 for the August 2009 

sampling event, and samples P1 and P7 for the June 2011 sample event. The hardness- based chronic 

aquatic life standard for these four samples ranged from 0.18 µg/L to 0.25 µg/L. Typical detection limits for 

cadmium for this project have ranged from 0.005 µg/L to 0.1 µg/L; detection limits greater than the aquatic 

life standards have not been observed in subsequent sampling events (Integral, 2016). 

Background surface water concentrations for metals are compared with the freshwater aquatic life criteria 

in Table 20-1. 

As summarized by Integral (2018), the surface waters in the project area generally exhibit high-quality 

water. Some natural exceedances of aquatic life water quality standards for metals were observed during 

one or more sampling events including: dissolved cadmium and zinc in Oxide Creek (P2), total selenium in 

Argillite Creek (P4), and total aluminum and iron at multiple stations. For the individual surface water 

samples that exceeded aquatic life standards, these relatively higher concentrations are representative of 

the background water quality conditions of each location. Groundwater seepage near the P2A location (see 

inset, Figure 20-2) may be a source of dissolved cadmium and zinc to the naturally elevated concentrations 

observed for the Oxide Creek (P2) drainage. Total aluminum and iron concentrations show a clear positive 

correlation with Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and a pattern of higher concentration in upstream locations 

relative to the paired downstream locations, which suggests that solids associated with glacial and 

snowpack melt add particle-bound aluminum and iron to the streams at their headwaters. Although the 

Oxide Creek and Argillite Creek tributaries to Glacier Creek exhibited naturally elevated concentrations of 

cadmium, selenium, and zinc, these parameters did not exceed aquatic life standards in Glacier Creek (i.e. 

P27) (Integral 2016). 

Integral (2018) observed a large variability in the concentrations of many water quality parameters between 

locations and at different times of year. Differences in local geology and mineralization, as well as the 

variable proportion of glacial melt/surface runoff and base flow comprising streamflow, are expected to 

influence water quality and drive variations in conventional, major ion, and metal concentrations between 

sampling locations. Larger, glacier-fed streams (the Klehini River, the Jarvis and Little Jarvis Creek system, 

and Glacier Creek) tend to carry higher amounts of suspended solids during periods of snowmelt (late 

spring through summer) and during precipitation events. Smaller tributaries generally have lower

suspended solid loads, clearer waters, and lower flow volume; water chemistry in these streams may be 

more heavily influenced by groundwater and local geology. 

Now that Constantine has characterized the baseline water quality in the broader Palmer Project area, the 

Company now plans to reduce the total number of surface water quality sample sites. Reductions in the 

scope of environmental baseline monitoring are common for advanced exploration projects following 

collection of sufficient data to characterize an area somewhat larger than the anticipated footprint of the 

Project. Constantine will continue monitoring at sites P1 and P27 in upper and mid-Glacier Creek, 

respectively. These sites are the most relevant sites for detecting any significant change in water quality, 

over time that may be concomitant with any proposed underground exploration activities in the upper 

Glacier Creek area.

20.1.3 Wetlands Surveys 

Constantine engaged consultant HDR, Inc. to perform wetlands delineation work in 2013 including mapping 

approximately 233 acres of land along a corridor for the proposed Glacier Creek access road. That segment 

of the road was constructed in 2016 to 2018. In 2014 and 2017, HDR also completed an office-based 

wetland mapping effort that focused on an area comprising 12,800 acres. In 2018, HDR prepared a 

wetlands jurisdictional determination report encompassing certain areas included in the previous studies 

and new areas surrounding them for a total 2017 study area of 4,580 acres (HDR, 2018). The wetlands 

work performed to date covers all the areas that are part of Constantine's proposed underground 

exploration program and those areas that would host the potential mine facilities contemplated in this PEA 

(Figure 20-3).

20.1.4 Aquatic Life Surveys 

Constantine initiated aquatic surveys in the Palmer project area using consultant Tetra Tech in 2013. Tetra 

Tech performed fish presence surveys in tributaries along the southeast side of Glacier Creek as part of 

planning for the Glacier Creek access road. The road has since been constructed along Glacier Creek on 

Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands and Mental Health Trust (MHT) lands. The final portion 

of the road, terminating at the portal site, is under construction at the time of this writing, as authorized by 

the MHT Plan of Operations Approval in April 2018. No species of salmon were recorded during sampling 

efforts on Glacier Creek or any of the 15 tributaries to Glacier Creek that were surveyed (Tetra Tech, 2013).  

In 2014, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) -Habitat Division performed fish studies along 

the proposed Glacier Creek access road alignment. They identified 23 drainages that cross the road 

alignment, including ephemeral and perennial streams, none of which were documented to contain 

anadromous fish. They did identify Dolly Varden trout in three of these streams but did not identify any fish

at or above the road alignment. Because of that work, ADF&G determined that fish habitat permits were 

not required for any of the proposed stream crossings (ADFG, 2014) along the proposed road alignment. 

In addition, ADF&G made a formal submission to modify the Alaska Anadromous Fish Catalog, by moving 

the upstream extent of Coho salmon presence downstream on Glacier Creek, to an unnamed stream below 

the washed-out bridge on Porcupine Road. Figure 20-4 illustrates the extent of resident fish and the 

modifications to the catalog for anadromous fish along lower Glacier Creek.

ADF&G made trips to the site again in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 for the purposes of furthering their survey 

work. ADF&G published reports titled Glacier Creek Aquatic Studies for their work in 2016 and 2017 that 

are available online at: http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=habitat_publications.main

20.1.5 Hydrogeology Monitoring, Testing and Modeling 

Constantine has performed several hydrogeology tests and computer modeling to estimate the seepage 

water inflow rates into a proposed underground exploration ramp as discussed below. In addition, it has 

been monitoring seasonal fluctuations in the groundwater levels (water table) in several holes. 

 Hydrogeology Testing 

Beginning in 2016, Constantine performed a series of hydrogeology tests in drill holes including isolated 

interval tests (packer tests) and flow / shut-in tests.  

Based on the results of the 2016 program, Tundra (2017) concluded that groundwater flow is largely 

vertical, as a function of the steep character of bedrock faulting. Groundwater flow along the faults varies 

seasonally. The work also suggested that the reservoir capacity of the faults is low and that after an initial 

inflow of underground seepage water from these structures, they should drain down relatively quickly, and 

base flow rates may be relatively low. The 2016 program was focused on a proposed exploration ramp 

alignment option on the north side of Glacier Creek Valley that has since been dropped from further 

consideration due to geotechnical considerations but the general characterizations of the rock mass and 

controls on hydrogeology remain valid. 

In 2017, the hydrogeology program re-focused on a different proposed exploration ramp alignment near 

the terminus of Saksaia Glacier on the south side of Glacier Creek. That program included 19 packer tests 

and one 52-day flow/shut-in test. The program is described by Tundra Consulting (2018). The packer tests 

were conducted in three drillholes located near the alignment of the proposed underground ramp and 

provide high-quality hydrogeology data for the Jasper Mountain Basalt. Three additional packer tests were 

performed in a fourth drillhole with one test each in the Hanging Wall Basalt, the SW mineralized zone, and 

in the footwall schist. Hydraulic conductivity (K) values from the packer tests ranged from 5.51 x 10-6 meters 

per day (m/d) to 7.10 x 10-1 m/d for the Jasper Mountain Basalt and a single value of 6.35 x 10-1 m/d for the 

Hanging Wall Basalt. Data analysis indicates that the Jasper Mountain Basalt can be subdivided into two 

hydraulic units; a shallow unit (less than 110 m below the ground surface) that has an average K of 0.102 

m/d, and the remainder of the Jasper Mountain Basalt which has a K of 4.34 x 10-4 m/d. 

 Groundwater Level Monitoring 

Constantine has measured groundwater levels in ten drillholes (Figure 20-5) using pressure transducers 

and continues to do so in eight of these as listed in Table 20-2. The original wells have more than a three-

year water level record.

The groundwater level monitoring well data are evaluated on a two-year cycle. The last full evaluation was 

in 2017 (Tundra 2018). Findings from water level monitoring include:  

 The piezometric surface (upper surface of groundwater) is irregular, but generally parallels the 

ground surface. It is deepest at high elevations and closer to the surface at lower elevations and 

on steep hillsides.  

 The groundwater levels show a pronounced seasonality with high and variable water levels in the 

summer, a steady drop in water levels starting in early winter, very low levels in late winter, and 

rapidly rising levels in the spring. These water levels correspond to recharge patterns including; 

unrestricted summer recharge, freeze-up and snow accumulation in the early winter, and rapid 

snow melt in the spring.  

 During the summer, the water levels in the wells have broadly correlative highs and lows that only 

generally correspond to recharge. Summer water-level patterns correspond poorly between wells 

in detail, however, suggesting that multiple factors control observed water levels in the summer 

including recharge, structure, location (dominantly elevation), proximity to glaciers and permanent 

snowfields, and well construction.  

 The seasonal pattern seen in the monitoring well hydrographs group by elevation.  

 Wells located at higher elevations show an extreme seasonal range with over 37 m of drawdown 

in the winter, and high and variable summer water levels. This pattern suggests filling and draining 

of fracture systems. 

 Mid-elevation wells show moderate seasonal variation and small variation in the summer water 

levels. The moderately low-elevation wells also appear to group and have a different pattern than 

the other wells, but the period of record is too short to draw inferences currently. 

These data suggest that Constantine should anticipate higher seepage inflows underground during spring 

thaw, potentially during intervals of high rainfall, but that seepage should be significantly lower during the 

winter when recharge rates are lowest. 

 Groundwater Modeling 

Tundra (2018) used a transient analytical flow model to estimate natural groundwater inflows into the 

proposed exploration ramp. The method incrementally estimates flow as the ramp is advanced. The 

analysis is most sensitive to K and pressure head above the ramp (i.e., saturated thickness above the ramp) 

and is less sensitive to the storage capacity of the rocks and the ramp radius. Sufficient data are available 

to estimate inflows for the first 1,250 m of the ramp (Jasper Mountain Basalt) which would take almost a 

year to excavate. The estimated flow for this portion of the ramp would peak at approximately 200 gpm and 

settle at a sustained rate of approximately 160 gpm during the first year of ramp development. It should be 

noted that short-term higher flow rates will likely occur from faults and fracture zones. Insufficient data are 

currently available to perform a flow estimation for the remainder of the ramp. However, based on the 

hydrogeological model and the available data for the Hanging Wall Basalt, Tundra (2018) suggests that a 

high flow rate is expected for the remainder of the ramp. 

Constantine should monitor the quantity of underground seepage water inflows underground as part of the 

ongoing monitoring and this data will be used to inform future mine planning.

20.1.6 Cultural Resources Data 

Archeological surveys have been performed within areas of potential disturbance by exploration activities 

in 2014 and 2017 by consultant Northern Land Use Research Alaska (NLURA). NLURA refers to these 

areas as Areas of Potential Affect (APE). No cultural sites or artifacts were identified in the 2014 and 2017 

pedestrian surveys. In both surveys NLURA concluded that "no cultural resources were encountered, and 

the likelihood of buried (unknown) cultural features is low, NLURA recommends a finding of no historic 

properties affected (36 CFR 800.4(d)(1)). In our opinion, no further fieldwork is required in advance for this 

proposed project." These surveys were performed under the permit authority of the Office of History and 

Archaeology/State Historic Preservation Office. Additional surveys may be required to cover areas 

contemplated for future mine development including areas slated for siting of the major mine facilities in 

this PEA. There are five historic sites within approximately five miles of the project area, two of which are 

listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and another site (SKG-00026) is considered 

eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Four of these sites relate to activities associated with the Klondike gold 

rush (turn of the 20th century), the construction of the Haines-Fairbanks pipeline (1950's), and WWII era 

road construction. The fifth is a historic campsite that, "from time immemorial been an important place for 

the Natives of Klukwan. It was the highest campsite to which the Natives could get by canoe" located at 

confluence of Porcupine Creek with Klehini River (NLURA, 2015). 

20.1.7 Wildlife, Endangered Species, Migratory Birds, and Bald and Golden Eagle Protection 

Wildlife and Terrestrial studies were initiated by consultant Hemmera in 2014 and performed seasonally 

through 2018. Wildlife habitat mapping and assessment for suitability for wildlife species of interest was 

done and resident species of interest were identified. Bird surveys (songbirds and birds of prey) were also 

completed. Mountain Goat populations in the project area are seasonally surveyed via fixed-wing aircraft 

(since 2014). Incidental wildlife observations are reported by Palmer Project employees using digital geo-

referenced reporting forms. Constantine personnel have identified the following wildlife in the area: black 

and brown bear, mountain goat, coyote, wolf, red fox, moose, Steller's Jay, Rock Ptarmigan, Belted 

Kingfisher, Golden Eagle, Red-tailed Hawk, Hoary Marmot and ground squirrels. The data for these surveys 

is in the form of trip reports and summaries for the goat surveys, a baseline summary report and a digital 

file of incidental wildlife observations. Constantine intends to continue with seasonal goat surveys. 

Constantine also has developed an invasive species management plan for the BLM (developed for the first 

portion of the Glacier Creek access road which is on BLM land) and the entire project will benefit from its 

implementation regardless of land ownership. Golden eagles have been observed in Glacier Creek and 

their nests have been identified but are outside the area of current activities. As part of permitting any future 

mining project, the USD&F will be consulted with regard to protection of migratory birds and Golden and 

Bald eagles 

20.1.8 Acid Base Accounting Data  

Constantine initiated acid base accounting studies in 2014. The purpose of the program was to characterize 

the various rock types at Palmer in terms of their capacity to generate acid rock drainage and/or metals 

leaching (ARD/ML) into the environment if they were subjected to the surface weathering environment. The 

study was expanded in 2017 to include additional core and surface outcrop samples that are representative 

of the rock types that Constantine anticipates intersecting with the proposed exploration ramp. It is important 

to understand that much of this work was directed specifically at rocks that would be encountered during 

an underground exploration program and did not fully consider the character of waste rock and tailings that

NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 20-13 

 

would be encountered under a future mining scenario. Additional studies will be required to expand the 

characterization of wastes.  

To date, 101 rock samples have been collected from drill core and surface outcrops that are interpreted as 

representative of the rock units that the proposed exploration ramp would pass through (see Figure 20-6) 

ARD/ML study work was performed by pHase Geochemistry and the final report was completed in 2018 

and included an assessment of 101 samples that are representative of the lithologies that are going to be 

intersected by the proposed underground ramp.  

Figure 20-6: ABA Results by Rock Type for Planned Exploration Ramp Representative Sample 

 
Source: Constantine (2018) 

The ARD/ML studies included acid base accounting (ABA), which includes geochemical analyses that help 

define the constituents of the rock samples and their relative abilities to generate and/or neutralize acid in 

the weathering environment. ABA analyses were followed with several kinetic tests (humidity cell tests) that 

mimic the weathering environment and the resultant leachate is analyzed for mobilized metals and pH. A 

third aspect of the ARD/ML study is the determination of the mineralogy of the samples. Finally, four (4) 

barrel tests, which are a form of long-term kinetic tests, were initiated at the Palmer site in 2017. 

Acid base accounting (ABA) results for the 101 rock samples are summarized in Table 20-3. Buffering 

capacity, or neutralizing potential (modified NP), of the 101 samples is generally high with a range of 6 to 

651 kg CaCo3/t. The limey argillites had the highest modified NP. Nearly all the neutralizing potential (NP) 

is contributed by carbonate minerals as indicated by a strong correlation between modified NP and 

carbonate NP. Trace amounts of iron carbonate were visually logged and a minor amount of ankerite was 

identified in the limey argillite. Iron carbonate minerals are not net neutralizing under oxygenated conditions.

However, calcite is predominant in those samples and contributes to the overall neutralizing potential. 

Screening criteria as provided by the Mine Environment Neutral Discharge Program (MEND, 2009) 

guidelines and the Global Acid Rock Drainage (GARD) Guide (INAP, 2009) were adopted in this 

assessment whereby a sample is considered:  

 Potentially acid generating (PAG) if acid neutralization potential ratios (NPR) are < 1, 

 Non-potentially acid generating (non-PAG) if NPR is > 2, and  

 Uncertain (UC) if NPR is between 1 and 2. 

Table 20-3: ABA Results by Rock Type for Exploration Ramp Representative Samples 

 
Source: pHase (2018) 

The ABA data indicate that the lithologies that Constantine will intercept in the proposed exploration ramp 

can all be classified as non-PAG, with acid neutralization potential (NPR) ratios ranging from 2.5 to 381 

with a median of 3, an indication of excess neutralizing capacity in the samples.  

As shown in Figure 20-7, the ABA results indicate that all the samples classify as non-PAG (pHase, 2018).

20.1.9 ASTM Phase I Environmental Site Assessment 

Stantec Consulting Services, Inc. ("Stantec") completed an ASTM Phase I Environmental Site Assessment 

(ESA) on November 11th, 2015. The ESA was conducted to identify if there are historical and/or current, 

potential on-site and/or nearby, off-site environmental concerns that might pose possible impact to the 

Project. Stantec performed the ESA in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM Practice 

E1527-13. 

In summary, Stantec did not identify any on-site or off-site Recognized Environmental Concerns that might 

impact the Project detrimentally (Stantec, 2015). Stantec's analysis of data and information reviewed as 

part of the ESA, as well as visual observations during the site visit, did not identify any indications of 

stockpiled, waste rock or similar, prospect-related material, nor released hazardous or petroleum product 

constituents, in any quantity deemed of potential environmental concern. 

20.1.10 Additional Baseline Data requirements  

For the current stage of the Palmer exploration program, Constantine has initiated a robust environmental 

baseline program and is addressing the key needs for current permitting and for some aspects of future 

mine permitting. As described above Constantine will likely need to expand some aspects of the baseline 

work as future development plans are better defined. This would include a broader ARD/ML program to 

characterize waste rock and tailings waste streams, and further evaluation of the potential need to treat and 

release mine drainage water.

20.2 Permitting 

20.2.1 Exploration Permits 

Exploration permit-types are dictated by land ownership which is varied in the Project area. Constantine 

performs mineral exploration at the Palmer Project under State of Alaska, Mental Health Trust Land Office, 

and Federal (BLM) permits as described below.  

 Surface Exploration Program 

Constantine has been performing surface exploration consisting of surface mapping and sampling, 

geophysics and diamond drilling on State, Mental Health Land Trust (Trust) and Federal land since 2008. 

Constantine controls the mineral rights under these surface estates through their ownership of state mining 

claims (State manages both surface and mineral estates), federal mining claims (Federal government 

manages the surface and mineral estates) and through an Upland Mining Lease with the Trust where the 

Trust owns the mineral estate. 

The Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) authorizes surface exploration activities where the federal 

government owns the surface estate (federal mining claims). The State of Alaska authorizes exploration 

activities where the state owns the surface estate (state mining claims and Trust split estate where Trust 

only owns the mineral estate) and the Mental Health Land Trust authorizes surface exploration where the 

Trust owns the surface estate.  

The BLM authorized surface exploration activities on federal mining claims through a Record of Decision 

(ROD) approving the Plan of Operations on August 18th, 2016 (Case file AA-094088). The BLM also 

authorized a modification of the Plan of Operations through another ROD on September 21st, 2017. These 

ROD's approve all the surface exploration activities (mostly core drilling) planned for the federal claims for 

the next few years. A lawsuit was filed in 2017 by SEACC et al. against the BLM for their 2016 and 2017 

Palmer Project Plan of Operations approvals, claiming the BLM failed to consider the future impacts of mine 

development before approving the exploration plans. Other parties in the suit are Lynn Canal Conservation, 

Rivers without Borders, and the Chilkat Indian Village of Klukwan. In March 2019, the lawsuit was decided 

in favor of the BLM, upholding their NEPA analysis and approval of exploration work, however an appeal 

was filed by SEACC et al. and is pending. Of note, the access road construction authorized under BLM's 

2016 and 2017 Plan of Operations approvals is now complete and the ongoing litigation does not impede 

exploration activities.  

Exploration on State of Alaska mining claims and Mental Health Trust lands where the Trust only owns the 

mineral estate (State retains surface ownership) is authorized under State of Alaska Miscellaneous Land 

Use Permit - APMA #5690, which was renewed in 2019 for another five years with a current expiration date 

of December 31st, 2023.  

On Mental Health Trust lands where the Trust owns the surface and subsurface estates, surface and 

underground exploration activities are authorized under Upland Mining Lease #9100759 issued by the 

Trust. The lease has an effective date of September 1st, 2014 and a three-year term with two extensions of 

three years (for a total of nine years). The lease can be further extended indefinitely as long as the project 

is being advanced. Under the terms of the lease Constantine is required to submit a Plan of Operations to 

the Trust annually for approval. On lands where the Trust only owns the mineral estate, and the State of 

Alaska retains ownership of the surface estate, then the Trust Plan of Operations Approval would only 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 20-17 

 

approve underground activities and the State Miscellaneous Land Use Permit would authorize the surface 

activities.  

Surface exploration activities require use of some surface water for drilling. Constantine is in possession of 

several Temporary Water Use Authorizations (TWUA) issued by Alaska Department of Natural Resources' 

(ADNR) Water Section. Constantine currently has authorization for designated water source locations 

under two temporary water use authorizations - TWUA F2014-102 and F2015-080 to support potential 

drilling activities at various locations across the property. TWUA F2014-102 expired on December 31st, 

2018; F2015-080 expires on July 13th, 2020. The TWUA's contain 27 conditions that must be complied with, 

including conditions designed to protect water quality and aquatic resources. 

 Advanced Underground Exploration Program 

Constantine is permitting an advanced underground program in two Phases. Phase I includes development 

of the access road and other surface civil construction in preparation of facility construction which will follow. 

All these activities are on Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority (MHT) lands. The Phase I Plan of Operations 

was approved by the MHT in April 2017. The associated Reclamation Plan and was approved by ADNR in 

May 2017. 

The Phase II Plan of Operations and associated Reclamation Plan were submitted to the MHT and ADNR 

in December 2018 and approvals are anticipated by May 2019. Constantine also submitted the engineered 

design drawings for a water management and disposal system to ADEC in December 2018 for their review 

and approval. The Phase II Plan of Operations will approve construction of facilities, developing the 

underground exploration ramp and executing the underground exploration drilling program. 

The schedule would have Constantine receiving all Phase II exploration approvals by May 2019 and 

initiating surface facility construction then and collaring the portal shortly thereafter. The proposed 

underground exploration ramp will take a bit over one year to develop.  

20.2.2 Major Mine Permits 

The following discussion identifies the major permits and approvals that will likely be required for the Palmer 

Project to be developed into an operating mine. 

The types of major mine permits required by this project are largely driven by the underlying landownership; 

regulatory authorities vary depending on land ownership. The Palmer Project area includes: 

 Federal land administered by the BLM - controlled by Constantine through federal mining claims. 

 State of Alaska land administered by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources – controlled by 

Constantine through state mining claims. 

 State of Alaska land administered by the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority – controlled by 

Constantine through mining with the Trust. 

The present facility layout shows that the 540 Conveyor and the 540 Access Portals, the mill and power 

plant facilities will be located on BLM lands while the tails dewatering plant and tailings management facility 

will be located on State of Alaska land. The 680 Portal will be located on MHT land. 

A list of likely major mine permits required to develop the mine is included in Table 20-4.

Under the scenario contemplated in this technical report it is likely that Constantine would develop a single 

Plan of Operations for the entire mining project and that this could be used by the MHT, ADNR, ADEC and 

BLM to authorize the activities that occur on their respective lands or the activities they are authorized to 

manage across land ownership lines.  

The BLM would be authorizing all surface activities on their lands including reclamation of the land. ADNR 

would be authorizing all activities on their land including reclamation of their land and MHT and BLM lands. 

The MHT would be approving all activities on their land. ADEC would be authorizing all waste management 

activities (i.e. waste rock and tailings management), any point source water discharges, reclamation of 

these waste management facilities and any long-term water treatment plans, regardless of land ownership.  

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) would require a Clean Water Act Section 404 permit for 

dredging and filling activities in Water of the United States (WOTUS) including jurisdictional wetlands. To 

minimize environmental impacts the PEA mine design deliberately located facilities to avoid WOTUS. A 

404 permit may not be required. 

The USACE Section 404 permitting action and the BLM's decision to approve the Plan of Operations would 

require both agencies to comply with the National Environmental Policies Act (NEPA) and, for a project of 

this magnitude, the development of an environmental impact statement (EIS). The BLM would likely be the 

lead federal agency for the NEPA process. The NEPA process will require an assessment of direct, indirect 

and cumulative impacts of the Palmer Project and the identification of project alternatives, and include 

consultation and coordination with additional federal agencies, such as the USF&W and National Marine 

Fisheries Service, and with the State Historic Preservation Office and Tribal Governments under Section 

106 of the Historical and Cultural Resources Protection Act.

As part of the Section 404 permitting process, the Palmer Project will have to meet USACE wetlands 

guidelines to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts to wetlands. The USACE may require Constantine to 

develop a compensatory wetlands mitigation plan for mitigating unavoidable wetlands impacts. The USACE 

is required to identify the least environmental damaging practicable alternative (LEDPA) for the project. 

The overall timeline required for permitting would be largely driven by the time required for the NEPA 

process, which is triggered by the submission of the 404-permit application to the USACE or the Plan of 

Operations submittal to the BLM. The timeline includes the development and publication of a draft and final 

EIS and ends with a Record of Decision, and 404-permit issuance. In Alaska, the EIS and other state and 

federal permitting processes are generally coordinated so that permitting and environmental reviews occurs 

in parallel. The NEPA process could require between 1.5 to 3 years to complete and could potentially take 

longer. 

"Major" permits generally define critical permitting path. Additional "minor" permits are also required. 

20.3 Social or Community Considerations 

The nearest communities to the Project are Klukwan and Haines. Klukwan is a Chilkat Indian Village located 

approximately 15 road miles southeast of the Project and Haines is located 35 road miles southeast of the 

project. These two communities are likely to see the biggest effects from any future mine development at 

Palmer. Constantine has recognized the importance of community considerations since beginning 

exploration in 2006. Dedicated community relations staff and consultants have been engaged and a local 

office was opened in 2015. The Company plans to continue efforts in 2019 to further strengthen stakeholder 

communications and relations, with the goal of maximizing mutual benefits and finding solutions to any 

concerns as the project design advances. 

A new mine at Palmer would bring some social and economic changes to both communities. The Palmer 

Project has the potential to significantly improve work opportunities for both communities. A new mine could 

generate approximately 260 direct full-time jobs plus the indirect jobs in the support and services industries. 

Regional engagement by Constantine has encountered a strong desire for the economic benefits that come 

with mining projects.  

Constantine's exploration activities have already had an economic impact on the communities. Constantine 

has hired locally since 2006 for the seasonal jobs including field and camp support, geological and 

environmental technicians, drill helpers, and road construction. These local employees comprise more than 

50% of the Palmer Project workforce. Through wages and purchase of supplies Constantine estimates it 

contributed more than US$1.7 million directly to local Haines economy in 2018 from its exploration program. 

Annual economic input has been maintained at similar levels since 2013. 

Constantine participates in local economic development organizations and job fairs to maximize business 

and employment opportunities. As part of their ongoing efforts, the Company conducts regular stakeholder 

meetings, maintains community outreach materials, hosts project site tours, attends and supports local 

programs and events, supports local hire and procurement, and participates in local community 

organizations. 

The BLM conducted an Environmental Assessment of proposed exploration activities in 2015 (amended in 

2017). The Assessment included public comment, government-to-government consultation with local tribes, 

and an analysis of potential effects of project activities on key social and environmental factors. The 2015

Page 20-20 

 

and 2017 Environmental Assessments both resulted in a 'Finding of No Significant Impacts' (FONSI). A 

NEPA analysis for a mine will examine larger impacts than those for an exploration program.  

In 2018, Constantine donated over US$12,000 to support local community and educational programs, 

events, charities and service organizations. It also provided comprehensive project site tours for 

approximately 50 community members including local community leaders and elected officials, Tribal staff 

and Council members, area users and residents, environmental NGO members, and students. Donations 

and site tours have been maintained at similar levels since 2013. 

In 2017, Rain Forest Data generated a memo called The Economic Impact of the Mining Industry in Haines 

Alaska, 2016. They conclude that the seventh largest wage providing industry in the Haines community is 

the mining sector, accounting for 8% of all workforce earnings in the Haines Borough. In 2016, mine workers 

in Haines directly earned $3.4 million. Mining represents 4% of all Southeast Alaska wages – which means 

mining is twice as important in Haines as an overall driver of the economy as it is for the region as a whole.  

These Haines mining jobs are commuter miners working at the Greens Creek and Kensington mines 

(located 80 and 32 miles south of Haines, respectively), road builders, quarry workers and placer miners, 

as well as employees on the Palmer exploration program.  

In general terms, rural Alaska residents are often concerned about potential mining impacts to wildlife and 

fish for those projects within their traditional use areas. Constantine acknowledged these concerns and is 

taking substantive steps to address them during the current exploration stage of the Project. 

Local community concerns will also be formally recognized during the development of the Project 

Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Early in the EIS process, the lead federal permitting agency will 

hold scoping meetings to hear and record the concerns of the local communities so that the more significant 

of these concerns can be addressed during the development of the EIS. In addition, the lead federal agency 

would have government-to-government consultations with the Tribal Councils in each of the villages, as 

part of the EIS process, to discuss the project and hear Council concerns. 

20.4 Mine Reclamation and Closure 

20.4.1 Reclamation and Closure Plan 

Mine reclamation and closure are largely driven by state regulations (11 AAC 86.150, 11 AAC 97.100-910, 

and 18 AAC 70) and statutes (AS 27.19) and Federal Regulations Title 43, Subtitle B, Chapter 11, Subpart 

C, Part 3800. A detailed reclamation plan will be submitted to the state and federal agencies for review and 

approval in the future, during the formal mine permitting process. The approval process for the plan varies 

somewhat depending on the land status for any mine. Because the Palmer Project is likely to have facilities 

on a combination of federal, state and MHT lands, it is likely that the Reclamation Plan will be submitted as 

part of the Plan of Operations and may be subject to review and approval from more than one agency.  

20.4.2 Reclamation and Closure Financial Assurance 

There are two State of Alaska agencies and one federal agency that require financial assurance in 

conjunction with approval and issuance of large mine permits.  

The ADNR requires a reclamation plan be submitted prior to mine development and requires financial 

assurance, typically prior to construction, to assure reclamation of the site. The ADEC requires financial 



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 

Prepared by JDS ENERGY & MINING INC. 

For CONSTANTINE METAL RESOURCES LTD. 

Page 20-21 

 

assurance both during and after operations, and to cover short and long-term water treatment if necessary, 

as well as reclamation costs, monitoring, and maintenance needs. The State requires that the financial 

assurance amount also include the property holding costs for a one-year period.  

The BLM has its own requirements for reclamation financial assurance which is generally aligned with the 

State's needs and a single reclamation plan and reclamation cost estimate is generally prepared in a 

manner that it meets the regulatory requirements of all agencies, eliminating the need for multiple financial 

assurance instruments. There is precedence for the BLM and State to rely on a single financial assurance 

to meet the requirements of both agencies.  

The final financial assurance amount will be calculated through the process of reviewing and approving the 

Palmer Project reclamation plan during the formal permitting process. In general, the approach is to 

combine the reclamation costs, post-closure monitoring costs and the long-term annual water treatment 

costs (if any) into a financial amount that includes deriving the NPV of the long-term costs and combining 

that with the reclamation cost.  

Constantine may satisfy the state financial assurance requirement by providing any of the following: 

1. A surety bond; 

2. A letter of credit; 

3. A certificate of deposit; 

4. A corporate guarantee that meets the financial tests set in regulation by the ADNR commissioner; 

5. Payments and deposits into the trust fund established in AS 37.14.800; or 

6. For the TSF or ADEC-related obligation - any other form of financial assurance that meets the 

financial test or other conditions set in regulation by the ADNR or ADEC commissioners and the 

BLM.  

The adequacy of the reclamation plan, and the amount of the financial assurance, are reviewed by the state 

and federal agencies at a minimum of every five years and may be reviewed whenever there is a significant 

change to the mine operations, or other costs that could affect the reclamation plan costs. 

Since no reclamation plan was developed for this PEA, no reclamation cost estimate was calculated. 

However, it is not unreasonable to make a comparison with the Greens Creek Mine located near Juneau 

Alaska about 97 miles (156 km) south of the Palmer Project. Greens Creek is an underground Pb-Zn-Ag-

Au mine that mines at a rate of approximately 3,000 t/d, utilizes flotation, produces and ships concentrate 

and disposes of its tailings in a dry stack facility. Unlike Palmer, the mine has a recognized need for long-

term water treatment. The 2014 cost estimate for the Greens Creek mine reclamation, excluding long-term 

water treatment, is $75.2 M. In the absence of a reclamation cost estimate specific to the Palmer project 

the 2014, estimated costs for the Greens Creek mine is reasonable basis to use to estimate closure costs 

for the Palmer PEA.  

For the purposes of this PEA, the Greens Creek direct cost items have been summarized by area and 

scaled according to the projected TSF and surface building footprints. The summary of the closure estimate 

is shown in Table 20-5. Indirect costs have been derived by scaling the direct costs using the factors shown 

in the table.

All capital cost are in 2019 US Dollars. 

LOM project capital costs consist of the following distinct components: 

 Pre-production Capital Development – includes all costs to develop the property to production, a 

mining and milling rate of approximately 2,712 tpd in Year 1. Initial capital costs are expensed over 

a 24-month pre-production construction and commissioning period 

 Sustaining Capital Cost – includes all costs related to the development, acquisition, replacement, 

or major overhaul of assets during the mine life required to sustain operations. Sustaining capital 

costs are expended in operating years 1 through 11 and 

 Closure Cost - includes all costs related to the closure, reclamation, and ongoing monitoring of the 

mine, post operations. Closure costs are incurred in Year 12. 

The capital cost estimate was compiled using a combination of quotations, database costs, and scaling 

factors.

21.1.4 Underground Mine CAPEX 

Capital cost estimates are based on a combination of budgetary quotes from equipment suppliers, in-house 

cost databases, and by comparison to similar mines in Alaska and Western Canada. Table 21-2 

summarizes the combined capital cost estimates for the two mines.

 Mobile Equipment and Replacement 

Underground mining equipment quantities and costs were determined through buildup of the mine plan 

quantities and associated equipment utilization requirements. Budgetary quotes were received and applied 

to the required quantities. Mobile equipment for the mine will be leased as required. Costs for the mobile 

equipment lease are a combination of the initial down payment and the lease payments. Leasing terms 

were based on the assumption of 20% down payment and an APR of 8% for 96 months. Equipment 

replacements and rebuilds have been calculated based on manufactures recommendations. 

 Fixed Equipment 

Budgetary quotes or database cost were used for major infrastructure components including the 

underground crusher, ventilation fans, heaters, pumps, paste plant, conveyor system, and communications 

system. The cost of construction and/or installation of the various fixed equipment has been included.  

 Lateral and Vertical Capital Development 

Lateral Development includes all main haulage ramps and accesses to ventilation and other raises. A total 

of 7,747 m of lateral and 190 m of vertical development will be driven during the pre-production period. An 

additional 10,961 m of lateral and 1,774 m of vertical development will be driven as sustaining capital during 

the operating years. Approximately 51% of all lateral development in the mine has been capitalized, the 

remaining 49% is captured in the operating cost. 

All vertical development has been capitalized. 

 Capitalized Pre-production Operating Costs 

Capitalized operating costs are defined as mine operating expenses (operating development, mine 

maintenance, and mine general cost) incurred prior to and during commissioning and cease at the 

commencement of commercial operations and generation of project revenues begins. Once commissioning

is complete and the processing begins, these costs transition to operating expenses. During pre-production, 

120,000 tonnes of mineralized rock is mined and stockpiled until it is processed in Year 1. 

The bases of these cost are described in Section 22, Operating Costs, as they are estimate in the manner. 

Capitalized product cost is included in the asset value of the mine development and are depreciated over 

the LOM.

 Surface Construction Sustaining Capital 

Sustaining capital costs are included in the estimate for yearly construction of the TMF/WRSF. The balance 

of the facility is expanded yearly throughout the LOM to provide storage capacity based on the mine plan 

material balance.  

Allowances are provided in the initial years for additional avalanche protection construction, using NPAG 

waste rock from the mining operation. 

The sustaining capital cost estimate also includes allowances for the processing plant, power generation 

and on-site infrastructure for major equipment overhauls, minor capital projects and upgrades.

Closure Costs have been estimated at 30.8 $M for all closure activities, including:  

 Removal of all surface infrastructure and buildings 

 Closure and capping of the TMF/WRSF 

 Re-vegetation and seeding allowance, and 

 Ongoing site monitoring. 

These costs were estimated based on scaling the existing bonding requirements of Greens Creek Mine by 

proportionate building sizes, TMF/WRSF footprint, etc. See section 20 for details on the closure cost 

estimate.  

21.1.10 Cost Contingency 

An overall contingency of 13.3% was applied to the initial capital costs of the project. LOM project 

contingency amounts to $32.2M, or approximately 11.8% of initial capital costs. The overall contingency is 

a blend of separate factors that were applied different areas as follows: 

 Mining Development – 20% 

 Underground infrastructure – 5% 

 Process Plant, Site Infrastructure and Project Indirect Costs – 15% 

 Civil Works and Tailings Management – 15% and 

 Indirect and Owners Costs – 15%. 

A growth allowance of 15% was applied to civil earthworks quantities prior to the application of the 

contingency, to reflect uncertainties in design material take offs. 

21.1.11 Infrastructure Capital Costs 

The infrastructure capital cost is provided in Table 21-6.

21.2.3 Process Operating Costs 

Process operating costs were estimated to include all lead and zinc recovery steps required to produce 

saleable concentrates. The process plant was designed to process 3,500 t/d at a 92% availability. Labour 

rates and benefit packages were based on industry information compiled by JDS. Power costs were 

calculated from the total installed power assuming $0.15/kWh. Liner pricing and Vendor recommended 

spare parts for one year of operation were used to estimate mill wear costs. Costs for media were 

determined using engineering calculations based on mill power draw, abrasion index and vendor quotes 

for media as a cost per tonne. Reagent costs were developed using the metallurgical test results 

summarized in Section 13 and pricing supplied by Vendors. Equipment maintenance was calculated by 

applying a factor of 4% to major process equipment cost. A breakdown of the process operating costs is 

summarized in Table 21-15.

22 Economic Analysis 

This PEA is preliminary in nature and includes the use of inferred mineral resources that are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that 

would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the results 

of this PEA will be realized. 

An economic model was developed to estimate annual cash flows and sensitivities of the project. Pre-tax 

estimates of project values were prepared for comparative purposes, while after-tax estimates were 

developed and to approximate the true investment value. It must be noted, however, that tax estimates 

involve many complex variables that can only be accurately calculated during operations and, as such, the 

after-tax results are only approximations. 

Sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in the zinc metal price, copper metal price, all metal 

prices, head grade, operating costs and capital costs to determine each item's relative importance as a 

project value driver. 

This technical report contains forward-looking information regarding projected mine production rates, 

construction schedules and forecasts of resulting cash flows as part of this study. The mill head grades are 

based on sufficient sampling that is reasonably expected to be representative of the realized grades from 

actual mining operations. Factors such as the ability to obtain permits to construct and operate a mine, or 

to obtain major equipment or skilled labour on a timely basis, to achieve the assumed mine production rates 

at the assumed grades, may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in this economic 

analysis. 

The estimates of capital and operating costs have been developed specifically for this project and are 

summarized in Section 21 and Section 22 of this report (presented in 2019 US dollars). The economic 

analysis has been prepared on a constant dollar base, without allowances for inflation or escalation. 

22.1 Assumptions 

The model excludes all exploration and sunk costs up to the start of detailed engineering (i.e. exploration 

and resource definition costs, engineering fieldwork and studies costs, environmental baseline studies 

costs, financing costs, etc.). This includes all costs associated with the upcoming 2019 exploration program. 

As such, the 680 portal, exploration drift, 848 diamond drill drift and all supporting services are assumed to 

be existing at the start of this PEA construction. Costs for these exploration elements have been specifically 

excluded from the PEA estimates even though they have not been occurred.  

Table 22-1 outlines the metal prices and exchange rate assumptions used in the economic analysis. The 

base case metal prices were selected based on the average of three years past and projected two years 

forward by analysis of London Metal Exchange futures as of April 15th, 2019. These have been compared 

to the spot prices at the close of London Metal Exchange on April 15th, 2019. These parameters are in line 

with other recently released comparable Technical Reports.  

The reader is cautioned that the metal prices and exchange rates used in this study are only estimates 

based on recent historical performance and there is absolutely no guarantee that they will be realized if the 

project is taken into production. The metal prices are based on many complex factors and there are no 

reliable long-term predictive tools.

Other economic factors include the following: 

 Discount rate of 7%; 

 Closure cost of $30.8 M (pre-contingency); 

 Nominal 2019 US dollars; 

 Revenues, costs, taxes are calculated for each period in which they occur rather than actual 

outgoing / incoming payment; 

 Working capital calculated as three months of operating costs (mining, processing, and G&A) in 

Year 1; 

 Results are presented on a 100% ownership basis; and 

 No management fees or financing costs (equity fund-raising was assumed). 

22.2 Processing and Concentrate Terms 

Mine revenue is derived from the sale of copper concentrate and zinc concentrate into the international 

marketplace. Barite concentrate will be sold to bulk barite suppliers to the North American oil rig service 

industry. The concentrate is in a 'drill-mud' ready powder form and does not require any additional 

processing. 

No contractual arrangements for refining exist at this time. Details regarding the terms used for the 

economic analysis can be found in the market studies (Section 19) of this report. 

Table 22-2 outlines the recoveries, payable terms, treatment charges and transportation costs used in the 

economic analysis.

22.7 Sensitivity Analysis 

A univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to examine which factors most affect the project economics 

when acting independently of all other cost and revenue factors. Each variable evaluated was tested using 

the same percentage range of variation, from -20% to +20%, although some variables may actually 

experience significantly larger or smaller percentage fluctuations over the LOM.  

The analysis revealed that the project is most sensitive to overall metal prices, followed by zinc metal price 

specifically, operating costs, head grade and capital costs. Of those elements tested, the Project showed 

the least sensitivity to copper metal price. Table 22-7 and Figure 22-4 show the results of the sensitivity 

tests. 

The economic cash flow model for the project over the LOM is illustrated in Table 22-8.

23 Adjacent Properties 

There are no properties of merit in the immediate area of the Palmer Exploration Project. However, there 

are two VMS deposits in the greater district with some similarities to Palmer.  

23.1 Greens Creek Ag-Zn-Pb-Au VMS Deposit, Admiralty Island, Alaska, USA  

The Greens Creek Mine, owned by the Hecla Greens Creek Mining Company, is located 175 km southeast 

of the Palmer Project on Admiralty Island, Alaska. It is one of the largest and lowest-cost primary silver 

mines in the world. In 2017, Greens Creek produced 8.4 million ounces of silver at a cash cost, after by-

product credits, per silver ounce of US$0.71 (a non-GAAP measure), and 50,854 ounces of gold (Table 

23-1). Production in 2018 is expected to be 7.5 to 8.0 million silver ounces at a cash cost, after by-product 

credits of US$0.50 an ounce.

The Greens Creek deposit is a polymetallic, stratiform, massive sulfide deposit located within the Admiralty 

sub-terrane of the Alexander Terrane (similar to Palmer). The host rock consists of predominantly marine 

sedimentary, and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks, which have been subjected to multiple 

periods of deformation. These deformational episodes have imposed multiple folding of the mineralized 

bodies to create a complex geometry. Mineralization occurs discontinuously along the contact between a 

structural hanging wall of quartz mica carbonate phyllites, and a structural footwall of graphitic and 

calcareous argillite. 

Ore lithologies fall into two broad groups: massive ores with over 50% sulfides and white ores with less 

than 50% sulfides. The massive ores are further subdivided as either being base-metal or pyrite dominant. 

Massive ores vary greatly in precious-metal grade from uneconomic to bonanza Au (>.5 opt) and Ag (>100 

opt). White ores are subdivided into three groups by the dominant gangue mineralogy white carbonate, 

white siliceous, and white baritic ore. These ores tend to be base-metal poor and precious-metal rich. Major 

sulfide minerals are pyrite, sphalerite, galena, and tetrahedrite/tennantite. 

Greens Creek is an underground mine which produces approximately 2,100 to 2,300 tons of ore per day. 

The primary mining methods are cut and fill and long hole stoping. 

Information with respect to proven and probable ore reserves, measured, and inferred resources is set forth 

below in Table 23-2. (As of December 31st, 2017, unless otherwise noted).

23.2 Windy Craggy Cu-Co-Au VMS Deposit, BC, Canada 

The 297 million tonne Windy Craggy deposit, located 60 km northwest of the Palmer Project, is the world's 

fourth largest VMS deposit by size, and tops the list as the largest of the copper- rich (Besshi type) 

category of VMS deposits. It is situated in the Alsek-Tatshenshini River area of the St. Elias Mountains, 

within the confines of the Tatshenshini-Alsek Provincial Park, designated World Heritage Site by UNESCO. 

Windy Craggy lies within the allochthonous Alexander terrane (similar to Palmer) which comprises a thick 

succession of complexly deformed Proterozoic to Permian basinal and platformal carbonate and clastic 

rocks with a subordinate volcanic component. These rocks have been subject to relatively low-grade 

metamorphism and are unconformably overlain by a Late Triassic succession of calcareous turbidites and 

a mafic volcanic suite which host the Windy Craggy deposit. 

Continuous massive sulfide mineralization is developed over a minimum strike length of 1600 m, at least 

600 m vertical extent, and greater than 200 m in width. It appears to consist of two discrete sulfide bodies, 

the North and South Sulfide Bodies, each with a variably developed stockwork/stringer zone. The tabular 

to lenticular, concordant North Sulfide Body is about 120-150 m thick by 500 m in diameter. The body is 

elongated in a WNW direction and dips moderately to steeply to the NNE. The South Sulfide Body is more 

deformed, is lensoidal and plunges steeply to the SE, extending to the SE as a series of 15 to 60 m wide 

massive sulfide lenses. The massive sulfides and enclosing hosts have been subjected to two phases of 
deformation producing isoclinal and open folds respectively. The main faults close to the deposit strike are 

steeply dipping and strike NW, subparallel to the strike of the host rocks.  

Measured geological reserves at the Windy Craggy deposit have been quoted at:  

 297 Mt @ 1.38% Cu, 0.2 g/t Au, 3.83 g/t Ag and 0.069% Co using a 0.5% Cu cut-off, to 

 198 Mt @ 1.75% Cu using a 1.0% Cu cut-off, or 

 139 Mt @ 1.96% Cu using a 1.5% Cu cut-off.  

This summary is based on the more detailed online British Columbia Geological Survey MINFILE record 

summarizing this deposit.

25 Interpretations and Conclusions 

25.1 Risks 

There are several risks associated with the Project that should be considered. Some are generic and shared 

by nearly all mining projects, including: 

 Sensitivity to metal pricing (as discussed in Section 22.6) 

 Cost escalation 

 Permitting difficulties, costs, and delays 

 Efficiency of construction management: a project can be properly estimated and improperly 

constructed, resulting in significant construction cost overruns. 

There are also several site-specific risks that are identified and discussed in detail in the following sections. 

It should be noted that the project is not sensitive to any exchange rates, as all revenues and nearly all 

capital and operating cost items were sourced in $US rather than converted from other currencies. 

25.1.1 Avalanche 

Glacier Creek valley is subject to snow avalanches between October and June with the most active periods 

between November and April, owing to high snowfall and steep terrain. Constantine has been studying the 

local avalanche cycles since 2010 in order to understand and mitigate avalanche risk. The results of that 

monitoring program suggest that the access road to the 680 Exploration Portal site is subject to periodic 

avalanches that could restrict access both during periods of high avalanche danger and during snow 

clearing operations after avalanches. The monitoring program has also informed design and placement of 

proposed mine infrastructure.  

The mill site, backfill plant and LNG power plant have been located in areas mapped as low hazard zones. 

Metal shed coverings were assumed for both the 680 Exploration Portal and the 510 Conveyor Portal for 

the protection of workers and equipment. Secondary egress and/or ventilation adits for both mines were 

located in low risk rock outcrop areas. 300 Kt of NPAG rock in the development schedule was assumed to 

be used for construction activities during the pre-production period, including the construction of avalanche 

deflection berms as required. 

An Operational Avalanche Safety Plan will be required during winter operation, which will include site-

specific weather and avalanche forecasting, road closures and artificial triggering and cleanup. No 

operational downtime or special equipment other than the usual snow removal fleet was included for 

avalanche control measures, as the mines can be accessed from separate portals. It is assumed that mine 

entry via the 510 Conveyor Portal will be possible during periods of time when the road to the 680 

Exploration Portal is blocked from the clean-up activities after intentionally triggered avalanches. 

25.1.2 510 Conveyor Portal Construction 

The 510 Conveyor Portal is determined by the location of the processing plant and the centroid of the 

orebody. The talus slope it is collared into is less than ideal for the construction of a mine adit and could

Page 25-3 

 

prove to be more costly and time-consuming than currently considered in the PEA. This was mitigated by 

using a ground penetrating radar analysis, supported by one visual outcrop, to locate the portal in the 

minimum depth of talus based on existing information. 

25.1.3 AG Metallurgical Response 

The test work completed on the AG Zone deposit is limited to mineralogy. Recoveries for the deposit were 

based on a comparison of the AG Zone deposit mineralogy to the Palmer deposit and existing flotation test 

work performed on Palmer deposit mineralization. The copper and zinc recoveries were discounted for the 

AG Zone deposit because the copper is lower grade and present as tennantite rather than chalcopyrite. 

The actual recovery of copper in the AG Zone deposit will only be confirmed through testwork. This impacts 

the recovery of copper, but also the loss of zinc to the copper concentrate. This risk is further complicated 

by the high lead grade in the AG Zone deposit, as compared to the Palmer deposit, which may require a 

combined lead-copper flotation or separate lead flotation circuit. 

25.1.4 Site Surface Geotechnical Conditions  

No site-specific subsurface information is currently available in the vicinity of the mill site or TMF/WRSF 

except for a single line of geophysical surveying near the mill site.  

Characterization of foundations is a key step during design to identify potential critical conditions. In the 

PEA design, foundation conditions are largely assumed based on surface observations. Key design 

considerations for foundation characterization include: 

 Potential presence of weak layers that could govern stability of the TMF/WRSF, pond 

embankments and other structures on site; 

 Potential presence of soft or weak layers that could result in differential or excess settlement of 

building foundations; 

 Potential for foundation strength loss or liquefaction (static or dynamic) which could govern stability 

of all structures; and 

 Hydrogeologic conditions, particularly beneath the TMF/WRSF pile and collection ponds (i.e. 

influencing uplift of liner during construction).  

The processing plant is located on deep till. Rafting foundations have been assumed for the larger 

equipment and adequate allowances have been included in the design and costs estimate to allow for this 

requirement.  

25.1.5 Water Management 

The risks associated with water management on site are as follows: 

 Basic assumptions were made for surface and underground water flows based on preliminary 

drilling and hydro-geologic information.  

 Flows from the AG Zone workings are not yet defined and have not been addressed in the water 

balance. The impact of AG Zone inflows on water management facility design and water treatment 

requirements are not known.  



 
 

PALMER PROJECT 
NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 

Prepared by JDS ENERGY & MINING INC. 

For CONSTANTINE METAL RESOURCES LTD. 

Page 25-4 

 

 Little information is available on the hydraulic conductivity of deeper sections of the ore deposits. 

Consequently, estimates of potential inflows are restricted to approximate assessments of recharge 

based sustained average flows and little information is available on peak flow rates. 

 The underground water collection and treatment strategy includes identification of water requiring 

treatment and separation from water that does not. Inability to differentiate would increase the 

amount of water requiring treatment and associated cost.  

 Geochemical test work to date indicates runoff from tailings will be relatively benign and operational 

controls will be in place for geochemical monitoring and management to confirm this. Therefore, 

the PEA design includes discharge of contact water collected at the CWCP after settlement to the 

TMF/WRSF LAD without additional treatment either during operations or upon closure. Additional 

tailings and waste rock characterization and more detailed operational planning will be required in 

future design stages to confirm indications of initial test work. Future results may indicate that water 

treatment at the TMF/WRSF may be necessary. 

25.1.6 Seismicity 

Stability analysis indicates that under maximum design earthquake (MDE) loadings, seismic displacements 

of the TMF/WRSF are possible. Deformations could impact pile integrity, pile infrastructure (roads, 

pipelines, etc.) and liner and drainage systems. Other site structures may also be impacted by seismic 

loading. 

25.1.7 Geochemical Management (Waste Materials) 

Geochemical testing to date on tailings is limited to initial pilot plant samples, and geochemical 

characterization of all waste rock has not yet been carried out. The limited testing represents uncertainty 

related to geochemical management. However, preliminary results from tailings testing indicate that the mill 

circuit is successful at removing the majority of sulfides from the tailings and the material is relatively benign. 

Pyrite tailings will be stored underground. A portion of PAG waste rock will be temporarily stored at the mill 

site before being placed underground later in operations.  

25.1.8 TMF/WRSF Dust Management 

Wind-blown tailings could impact and exceed air quality standards if areas of the TMF/WRSF pile are left 

unmitigated. Although the TMF/WRSF design includes progressive reclamation and waste rock armoring 

of pile slopes, filtered tailings can be susceptible to dusting if left exposed. Temporary dust management 

alternatives prior to placement of a reclamation cover include: synthetic dust suppressants, wind fences 

and temporary sand and gravel erosion protection layers. 

25.1.9 TMF/WRSF Post-Closure 

Long-term closure goals for the TMF/WRSF include providing a stable pile and limiting long-term risk to the 

downstream environment (safety, water and air quality). The PEA design addresses these goals by 

eliminating ponded water on the TMF/WRSF pile surfaces, routing water around the pile and progressively 

covering the pile with a low-permeability cover to limit water and oxygen ingress. Pile drain down water will 

be greatly reduced upon closure due to the completion of the low-permeability cover. Long-term risks to 

water quality are not fully defined by short-term geochemical testing and the need for additional long-term

Page 25-5 

 

measures is uncertain. Differential settlement of tailings has the potential to modify drainage paths resulting 

in formation of localized ponds.  

25.2 Opportunities 

The Project has several opportunities to improve the current results that should be investigated further as 

part of the ongoing development of the Project. 

25.2.1 Expansion and Definition of Resources 

The simplest and most obvious opportunity is to continue to explore the property to expand and better 

define the resources. The current level of drilling is sufficient to define a resource but has certainly not 

closed off either deposit and there is ample opportunity to either or both. An expansion of mineral resources 

would allow the mine plan to contemplate either a higher mining rate, longer mine life, or some combination 

of both. Increased resource definition through tighter drill spacing would allow the resource to form the basis 

of a reserve for a PFS or FS. 

25.2.2 Sale of Pyrite 

The current study treats pyrite as a waste product that must be returned underground as paste backfill 

because of its acid-generating potential. Pyrite is a saleable commodity, however, as it is used to generate 

sulfuric acid. As the pyrite is already ground, floated, and filtered there would be no incremental processing 

costs associated with making the product saleable. If a contract could be arranged with an adequate margin 

to ship the product to a smelter, this could be a significant opportunity.  

There will be 3.0 Mt of pyritic tails generated over the LOM. This total exceeds the quantity of material 

(NPAG rock and de-sulfide tails) sent to the TSF. As such, it is possible that pyrite sales could result in the 

elimination of a TSF for surface waste storage. As such, it may even be beneficial to the Project to sell the 

pyrite at a loss. 

25.2.3 AG Zone Deposit Metallurgy 

While the limited testwork for the AG Zone deposit has been identified as a risk in Section 25.1.3, it must 

also be considered an opportunity. AG Zone deposit recoveries were estimated by applying a 10% 

deduction recovery to the copper (from 89% to 79%) and a 5% to the zinc from the AG Zone deposit (from 

93% to 88%). Should testwork prove these deductions to be conservative, the economics of the AG Zone 

deposit will be improved. Similarly, the increased presence of lead may impose a complication on the 

copper recovery, but it may also provide an additional revenue stream from the sale of a lead concentrate 

or a combined copper-lead concentrate. 

25.2.4 Good Used Equipment 

The purchase and employment of good used equipment is always a consideration to be made to reduce 

capital costs. In general, this should not be considered for the mobile mining, as the savings do not warrant 

the reduction of availability, making production targets hard to achieve. However, much of the major 

equipment list for the processing plant, backfill plant, the surface fleet, and power generation and 

distribution could be comprised of used units should suitable unit be available at the time of procurement.

Page 25-6 

 

Realistic assumptions and expectations should be applied to the purchase of used equipment, as there are 

usually significant costs for rebuilding, retrofitting, or modernizing componentry.  

25.2.5 Conveyor for AG Zone Deposit 

Haulage costs for the AG Zone deposit are significant due to the long haulage distance. A trade-off study 

should be performed to determine if a second conveyor should be installed to replace the truck haulage. 

This would require that a second crusher installation be installed for the AG Zone deposit to size rock for 

the conveyor.

26 Recommendations 

26.1 General 

The primary finding of this PEA is that the Project has the potential to be economic based on the data 

acquired to-date and the mine model that was produced for this evaluation. Accordingly, it is recommended 

that exploration continue on the Project and that the company advance its permits and baseline 

environmental data collection with the ultimate goal of constructing the mine and putting it into production. 

To this end, the Authors believe continued delineation drilling is warranted and has the potential expand 

the known resource and increase its confidence. Once this is done, it would be worthwhile to replace this 

PEA with a pre-feasibility study (PFS) or feasibility study (FS) that includes a mining reserve based on a 

mine model applied to the expanded resource. 

Given the mountainous terrain, this drilling can only be effectively achieved from underground development. 

There is also significant potential to discover additional mineralized zones within the greater Palmer 

Property. Accordingly, the planned exploration adit, drift, and underground drill program is recommended. 

26.2 Recommended Work Plan – Exploration Program 

The following activities are recommended as part of the next exploration program, currently anticipated for 

summer 2019: 

 Review the option of a lateral underground exploration adit to provide access to the mineral 

resource area for delineation drilling, hydrological and geotechnical studies, and metallurgical 

testing. This may be more cost effective for drilling on close-spaced centers for conversion from 

Inferred to Indicated mineral resource categories than drilling from surface and would also facilitate 

year-round drilling, which is currently impractical during the winter months.  

 Conduct geotechnical, hydrogeological, engineering, environmental, avalanche risk studies and 

permitting work to aid in the assessment of a conceptual underground exploration development. 

 Prepare and submit a Plan of Operations permit application in support of the conceptual 

underground exploration program.  

 Conduct 30,000 m of resource-scale definition and exploration drilling on 100 m and 50 m nominally 

spaced centers to test the limits of the SW, RW and AG mineralized zones. Priority drill areas would 

include the on-strike and down-dip extensions of the Palmer deposit¸ with emphasis on the potential 

200 m down-dropped faulted offset of the SWZII-III-EM Zone, as well as, the expansion of the AG 

Zone deposit along strike and at depth, and the conversion of Inferred to Indicated mineral 

resources.  

 Conduct 10,000 m of exploration drilling to test existing regional exploration targets.  

 Develop of new regional exploration targets within the Federal and State mining claims, and within 

the greater Mental Health Trust Lands that are under lease. 

 Update the mineral resource estimate to form the basis of a new PFS or FS Study.

26.3 Recommended Work Plan – Pre-feasibility or Feasibility Study 

The logical next step for the project is to produce a pre-feasibility study (PFS) or Feasibility Study (FS). This 

effort would require the following field programs and engineering evaluations: 

 Complete geotechnical characterization program for the PEA underground mine and infrastructure 

including geotechnical core drilling and oriented core and/or televiewer; 

 Investigation of the talus slope to finalize the location of the 510 Conveyor Portal. 

 Ongoing metallurgical testwork to confirm the flotation characteristics of the AG Zone deposit 

through lock-cycle test. 

 Ongoing metallurgical testwork on blended samples of Palmer deposit and AG Zone deposit 

mineralization, matching the production forecast to simulate the predicted scheduled mill feed. 

 A new avalanche hazard analysis should be performed now that site facilities have been generally 

located to identify specific concerns and countermeasures that should be applied to the next level 

of study. This would include design and location of avalanche deflection berms to protect the site 

roads, industrial complex, water treatment ponds and the two portals. 

 The 510 Portal location should be finalized, and a detailed engineering design should be completed 

for a snow cover shed and avalanche deflection structure(s). 

 Hydrogeological studies of AG Zone to assess flow rates and treatment requirements will be 

required. Potential measures to reduce inflows during operation such as construction of bulkheads 

between operational and depleted zones should be investigated. 

 Continue to advance understanding of geochemistry and waste management strategies. Include 

TMF/WRSF water treatment as a contingency in project costing estimates if required. Continued 

collection and analysis of data relating to underground, and surface water needs to be continued 

on-site over the near-term to enhance the local hydrological knowledge. 

 It is recommended that a site investigation program to characterize the foundations and potential 

borrow materials be conducted. A detailed site investigation plan has not been prepared as part of 

the PEA, but would likely include the following: 

o Drilling to perform penetration tests (correlated to soil density), visually describe the soils, 

collect samples for laboratory testing, measure in-situ hydrogeologic properties of the soils and 

install geotechnical instrumentation (inclinometers and vibrating wire piezometers) or 

groundwater monitoring wells. Shear wave velocity measurements could be collected in 

standpipe piezometers to inform SSHA and liquefaction triggering assessments. 

o Cone penetration testing (CPT) to provide continuous soil classification that can be used in part 

of liquefaction triggering assessments. Shear wave velocities may also be measured. 

o Geophysics to infill data between drill holes and CPT soundings.  

o Test pits to characterize borrow sources.

 Mitigation measures for foundation improvement could be developed (weight drop or other 

foundation densification, stone columns, etc.), or if impractical, re-siting of the mill site, TMF/WRSF, 

CWCP and other structures could be required as a result of the investigation findings. 

 Site-specific seismic hazard assessment (SSHA) to characterize seismic hazard to assess if MDE 

adopted is appropriate. Perform deformation analysis to quantify the magnitude of seismic 

deformations. If required, revise designs to reduce deformation to acceptable levels. Conduct a 

site-specific seismic hazard assessment to establish seismic loadings for structures and site 

facilities. Perform stability assessments to confirm designs comply with design criteria for static and 

seismic stability.  

 Develop temporary storage contingencies outside of the TMF/WRSF for periods when pyrite 

tailings cannot be placed immediately underground. Options could include use of the lined 

temporary PAG rock / ore stockpile adjacent to the mill, a storage shed or a separate, contained 

area or section of the TMF/WRSF. 

 Install instruments to establish baseline water quality and hydrogeological conditions. 

 Optimize site-wide water balance to evaluate interactions between surface water storages and how 

the water management system will perform under prolonged dry or wet conditions, flood events, at 

different stages of the mine life, and following an operational upset of the WTP.  

 Conduct additional testing on tailings and waste rock to define geotechnical properties. The next 

design stages for the TMF/WRSF should also anticipate settling and provide long term positive 

drainage to prevent ponding. 

 Conduct additional testing on tailings and waste rock to further define geochemical properties. 

Assess tailings effluent quality to inform water management designs and water treatment needs. 

 Conduct wind tunnel trials to assess dusting potential and appropriate mitigation strategies for the 

filtered tailings. 

 Complete a constructability review, including material requirements and preparation of an 

execution plan, for the TMF/WRSF design to define risks to cost, schedule and identify areas for 

potential optimization. 

 Undertake an operations review of the TMF/WRSF to assess whether adequate flexibility and 

management of risk have been incorporated into the design. 

 Review the effect of tailings consolidation and differential settlement between structural and non-

structural zones on closure cover design,  

 Undertake a Failure, Modes, and Effects Analysis (FMEA) of the TMF/WRSF and other project 

components specific to technical assessments of risks, consequence, design resilience and 

potential operational failure modes. Results of the FMEA can be used (1) to provide guidance for 

instrumentation monitoring during operations; (2) to establish a surveillance program; and (3) to 

screen out failure modes that can be effectively managed by the Observational Method during 

operations.

The following trade-off evaluations should be performed as part of the next phase of work on this Project: 

 The construction of a loading terminal in Haines to replace the Skagway facility. 

 The optimal end-product form and packaging of the barite to maximize the sales margins. 

 The best processing option for the AG Zone deposit should be evaluated, including preparation of 

a lead concentrate, suppression of the lead in the floatation circuits to maintain the value of the 

copper concentrate, or the generation of a cooper-lead concentrate. 

 The economic viability of selling pyrite for the production of sulfuric acid off-site instead of returning 

it to the mine as backfill. Environmental baseline studies to include water quality sampling, species 

of interest studies, environmental rock geochemistry studies, and meteorological data collection.  

 Continued ABA testwork to chemically characterize the TSF. 

 Ongoing engagement with community, local stakeholders and governments with continued local 

hiring practices.
