1 SUMMARY 
 

1.1 INTRODUCTION 

 

In May 2010, TechnoMine Services, LLC ("TechnoMine") was retained by Jaguar Mining Inc. ("Jaguar" 

or the "Company") to prepare an independent NI 43-101 compliant feasibility study technical report (this 

"Feasibility" or "Report") on its Gurupi Gold Project (the "Project") located in the state of Maranhão, 

Brazil.  The Project includes the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits and is controlled by MCT Mineração 

Ltda. ("MCT"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  

 

In December 2009, Jaguar acquired the Project from Kinross Gold Corporation ("Kinross") and 

commissioned Pincock, Allen & Holt ("PAH") to prepare an independent NI 43-101 resource estimate 

technical report for the Project (the "PAH Report").  Jaguar also commissioned AMEC International 

(Chile) SA ("AMEC") to prepare an independent NI 43-101 prefeasibility technical report on the Project 

(the "AMEC Prefeasibility").  The PAH Report and the AMEC Prefeasibility were filed on SEDAR on 

December 4, 2009 and May 11, 2010, respectively. 

 

During 2010, Jaguar proceeded with the permitting and licensing of the Project.  As part of the process of 

completing this Feasibility, the Company also completed studies on Project improvements from the 

AMEC Prefeasibility, which are included in this Feasibility and summarized below. 

 

• The option for a 230-kV power line from the Encruzo Substation to the Project Main 

Substation (40 km), instead of the 69-kV that was considered in the AMEC Prefeasibility; 

• The inclusion of Secondary Crushing and a High Pressure Grinding Roll ("HPGR") replacing 

a SAG Mill;  

• The inclusion of Vertical Mills replacing Ball Mills; and  

• The utilization of Intensive Concentration technology.  

 

Based on the results of this Feasibility, Jaguar intends to proceed with the development of the Cipoeiro 

and Chega Tudo deposits and the construction of a Flotation-Gravity circuit followed by an Adsorption – 

Desorption – Recovery ("ADR") Carbon-in-Pulp ("CIP") Processing Plant.  The Project estimated 

nondiscounted CAPEX is US$ 345.7 million, out of which about US$ 278 million correspond to 

preoperational investments.  The estimated LOM is 13 years and the average adopted design production 

is 5 Mtpy (corresponding to 148,690 oz of gold per year).

1.2 GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION   

 

The Gurupi Project area lies within an elongate northwest–southeast-trending shear zone developed along 

the boundary between a Lower Proterozoic metamorphic belt (Gurupi greenstone belt) and the 

southwestern margin of the Archaean São Luis craton. Most of the gold deposits and showings of the 

Gurupi greenstone belt, including Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro, are hosted in structures associated with the 

strike-slip, sinistral Tentugal shear zone.  The Project deposits are considered to be typical of 

mesothermal vein-style, or orogenic-style gold deposits. 

 

Chega Tudo is hosted in a dacite metavolcanic unit. Intrusive gabbro, extrusive andesite, and arkosic 

arenite rocks are in structural contact with the dacite. Rocks in the deposit area have been widely affected 

by hydrothermal alteration. Mineralization is emplaced mainly in dacite and found solely within zones of 

quartz–sericite–pyrite alteration and is closely related to the amount of pyrite introduction.  Typically, 

mineralization forms en-echelon pods elongated with the shear foliation and persisting for tens to 

hundreds of meters of strike and a similar distance down dip.  These northwest-trending, steeply 

southwest-dipping mineralized zones range from a few meters to as much as 30 m in width and can form 

multiple pods that can be as much as 100–200 m wide. 

 

Two main litho-types are recognized at Cipoeiro, a tonalite and an arkosic fine-grained arenite with thin 

quartz–pebble conglomerate layers.  The primary mineralization is hosted by a coarse equigranular 

intrusive of tonalitic composition. The hydrothermal system at Cipoeiro was chemically similar to that at 

Chega Tudo.  Silica flooding and replacement of the tonalite is more intense and more widespread than 

seen in the metavolcanics at Chega Tudo.  However, gold remains most closely associated with sulfide 

(pyrite) introduction and quartz–sericite alteration. Two zones of mineralization have been defined, the 

Contact Ore Zone on the south and the Blanket Ore Zone to the north.  The zones are separated by the 

Central Fault Zone (CFZ).

1.3.2 Mineral Reserves Estimates 

 

Probable mineral reserves were estimated based on indicated mineral resources only, using 

Lerch-Grossman ("L-G") constraining pit shells.  Gold unit price adopted for the base case is 

US$ 950 / oz Au.  The reserve base (probable mineral reserves only) was selected on the basis of 

incremental NPV values analysis, performed for a gold unit price varying from US$ 300 / oz Au 

to US$ 1,135 / oz Au.   This range includes the unit gold price adopted in this Feasibility (sales): 

US$ 1,066 / oz.  

 

MICROMINE ® pit optimization tool was used to design a set of pits, which were constrained 

via the utilized L-G algorithm. The Pit Optimization main results are shown in Table 17.2.1.

Based on the selected haulage equipment, the width of the mines haul roads was set at 22 m, 

while the slope of the access ramps into the pits was limited to 10%.  The final pits designs were 

created based on the latter criteria and on the optimized pit parameters.  

 

The estimated Probable Mineral Reserves for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits are 

summarized on Table 1.3.2.2.

1.4 PROJECT SUMMARY DATA 

 

The adopted price for the base case scenario has been US$ 1,066 / oz Au.  This value 

corresponds to the expert-agreed gold projected average price over 2013 through 2025, by 

Consensus, on December 16, 2010. Therefore, the Project total estimated nondiscounted 

"monetizable" (salable) amount of gold (1,932,920 oz Au) would yield a total nondiscounted 

gross revenue of US$ 2,060.5 million.  As a result, the average annual gross revenue would 

amount to US$ 158.5 million, i.e., US$ 2,060.5 million/13 years.

1.5 PERMITTING 

 

1.5.1 Exploration and Mining Licensing 

 

The Project comprises 32 mineral properties.  This Feasibility relates to only two (2) of these 

mineral properties: DNPM 800.180/1990 (Cipoeiro) and DNPM 800.090/1985 (Chega Tudo).  

The remaining mineral properties represent a future upside to the Project.  The mineral rights 

(Applications for Mining Concessions) in connection with the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits 

are in good standing.  The Company expects to receive the Mining Concessions in October 2011. 

 

1.5.2 Environmental Permits 

 

In November 2010, Jaguar filed the required environmental studies with the appropriate 

environmental agency in the state of Maranhão to obtain the Previous License ("LP").  The 

Company expects that a public hearing in connection with the Project LP will be held by mid-

February. 



8 
 

 

After the LP is granted, Jaguar will start the process of obtaining the Installation License ("LI").  

Jaguar expects to apply for the LI by March 2011 and be granted the license by July 2011.  The 

Operation License ("LO") will be required after the LI is granted and after implementation of the 

Project.  The Company expects to apply for the LO by August 2012 and be granted the license 

by October 2012. 

 

1.5.3 Land Tenure 

 

The Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits are located in an area that belongs to the National 

Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform ("INCRA").  Jaguar filed a request for release of 

land tenure from INCRA in February 2010.  On December 28, 2010, INCRA has issued a ruling 

that entitles Jaguar to start negotiations with landowners and settlers.  The Company has carried 

out a socioeconomic evaluation in the area and completed a comprehensive resettlement project 

that has been well received by the landowners and settlers. 

 

1.5.4 Power Supply 

 

In December 2010, Jaguar filed an application with the Ministry of Mines and Energy ("MME") 

to receive a connection to the national 230-kV transmission network.  The MME has requested 

additional information, which was provided on January 14, 2011.  Jaguar expects to be granted 

the authorization to connect to the national 230-kV network (via a ca 40-km 230-kV 

transmission line to be constructed by Jaguar, that will link the Project Substation to the existing 

Encruzo Substation), by the end of February 2011. 

 

1.6 Project Status 
 

With the completion of this Feasibility, Jaguar has reported that it intends to proceed with the 

Detailed Engineering Design Phase, in order to implement the Project, in accordance with the 

schedule shown in Appendix 21 – Project EPC Schedule.

1.10 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

 

It is TechnoMine's conclusion that the Gurupi Gold Project is low-risk and robust.  It represents 

an improved undertaking as compared with the Project as presented in a previous in-house 

developed, unpublished Feasibility Study (Kinross, 2005) and in the AMEC Prefeasibility. 

 

While completing this Feasibility, TechnoMine and the Company also completed studies on 

Project improvements from the AMEC Prefeasibility, which are included in this Feasibility and 

summarized below. 

 

• The option for a 230-kV power line from the Encruzo Substation to the Project Main 

Substation (ca 40 km), instead of the 69-kV option that was considered in the AMEC 

Prefeasibility.  The adopted 230-kV transmission option led to an estimated average 

energy cost of US$ 0.075 / kWh, over the Project LOM that radically reduced the 

Project OPEX. 

 

• The inclusion of Secondary Crushing and a High Pressure Grinding Roll replacing a 

SAG Mill, along with the inclusion of Vertical Mills replacing Ball Mills introduced 

an overall reduction to comminution costs of approximately 25% over the previous 

adopted size reduction process routes.  

 

• The utilization of Optimized Flotation Circuit in the context of Intensive 

Concentration technology conveyed, in addition to a more reliable concentration 

recovery rate, a dramatic reduction of the environmental risks and associated 

liabilities.  The sound testwork-supported process route guarantees that about 74% of 

the Mill Feed (solids) will consist of  cyanide-free material that will be disposed in a 

rejects dam (first eight years) and in a rejects disposal facility (last five years).  Only 

26% of the Mill Feed will be cyanided and go through an activated carbon CIP-ADR 

circuit.  The tailings will be detoxified by a TBD state-of-the-art process and 

conveyed to a 2.5-mm thick geomembrane lined tailings dam.  The Project has been 

studied at length from a technical standpoint and is supported by wide-ranging 

exploration, detailed and in-depth metallurgical testwork, and conceptual and basic 



14 
 

engineering, in addition to special front-end engineering tests and studies.  The 

aforementioned testwork and for this enhanced process route Project has been 

performed by reputable entities in Brazil, Canada, Germany, and Australia.  The 

New Process Route Plant OPEX (US$ 6.70 / t) is significantly smaller (over the 

LOM) than the AMEC-determined one: US$ 9.93 / t.  

 

• Most CAPEX and OPEX estimates are supported by vendor quotes, contracts, and 

receipts.  Cost estimates are based on solidly supported process routes, mining 

methods, and plans, within the +/- 15% accuracy range. 

 

Based on the aforementioned conclusions and on the strong economic results yielded from the 

cash flow model and sensitivity analysis, TechnoMine considers the Project to be feasible and 

attractive.  Related technical and economic risks are small. 

 

1.11    RECOMMENDATIONS 

 

 TechnoMine recommends Jaguar to move toward the Project's implementation and 

start-up. 

 

 The Project is feasible and robust at its current size (5.0 Mtpy) and ramp-up profile 

(See Appendix 02 – Cash Flow and Sensitivity Analysis Base Case Scenario).   

However, it is recommended that exploration efforts continue not only at the Project 

properties, but also at other nearby areas. An increased resource base will give rise, 

via further consolidated studies, to increased reserves, which, in turn, may 

significantly augment the Project life and improve the financial performance of an 

extended project. 

 

 The same or higher technical standards related to the front-end engineering activities 

(such as exploration, metallurgical testwork, and conceptual and basic engineering), 

along with the required special front-end engineering tests and studies, should be 

maintained for an augmented project size.  

 



15 
 

 The recommended additional exploration and remaining front-end engineering 

activities should start as soon as possible in order to support a technically sound 

transition to any expanded Project.

2 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

 
TechnoMine was retained by Jaguar to prepare this Feasibility addressing its Cipoeiro and Chega 

Tudo Ore Bodies, located in the municipalities of Centro Novo do Maranhão and Centro do 

Guilherme, respectively, in the state of Maranhão, Brazil.  The properties mining concession 

rights have been applied for, and are owned by MCT, a fully-owned subsidiary of Jaguar.   

 

Ivan C. Machado, M.Sc., P.E., P.Eng. is the author and overall Independent Qualified Person for 

this Feasibility.  Mr. Machado is independent of the Issuer applying the tests set out in section 

1.5 of National Instrument 43-101, as set forth in Chapter 23 – Certificate of Author.  Mr. 

Machado serves as a Principal of TechnoMine and has conducted site visits, the last of which 

took place on December 15, 2010.  Mr. Machado has reviewed the property mineral rights, 

licenses, permits, and exploration work carried out thus far.  

 

During preparation of this Feasibility and site visits, discussions were held by Mr. Machado and 

other TechnoMine's professionals with: 

 

Adriano L. Nascimento  Vice-President, Exploration & Engineering, Jaguar 

Wilson Miola, Ph.D.   Director of Engineering, Jaguar 

Jaime Duchini    Director of Geology, Jaguar  

Eli Leite    Manager of Technical Services, Jaguar 

Mauro Miranda Salim   Manager of EPCM, Jaguar

17 
 

The preparation of this Feasibility, starting in July 2010, was an endeavor by TechnoMine, the 

Jaguar team of professionals, Jaguar and TechnoMine consultants and consulting companies, and 

independent laboratories, under the coordination and technical supervision of the Author of this 

Feasibility.  TechnoMine supervised and reviewed the preparation of all segments of the 

Feasibility as an independent engineering company.  Jaguar's Team was internally led by Dr. 

Wilson Miola. 

 

The Feasibility includes several improvements over the AMEC Prefeasibility comminution 

circuit. Based on sound additional testwork, SAG and Ball milling have been replaced with 

Secondary Crushing, HPGR, and Vertical Mills.  A stage of intensive concentration through 

flotation and continuous discharge gravity concentration was included in the process route that 

proved to reduce solids mass to undergo the leaching process.  

 

These improvements will result in a reduction of cyanide tailings disposal mass to approximately 

74% of the total mill feed (solids) and significantly reduce operating costs. 

 

Power supply is now envisioned to utilize a to-be-constructed 40-km, 230 kV transmission line 

from the Eletrobrás Encruzo Substation to the Project site.  This alternative will significantly 

reduce the power cost (estimated average at US$ 0.075 / kWh).

4.2 TENURE HISTORY 

 

In 1985, Sierra Mineração Ltda. ("SML") applied for mineral rights around garimpeiro workings 

at Chega Tudo.  Companhia Nacional de Mineração ("CNM"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of 

TVX Gold Inc. ("TVX"), acquired an interest in the mineral rights through an agreement with 

SML. 

 

In 1995, TVX joint-ventured the Project with Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation ("Santa Fe"). 

Santa Fe was acquired by Newmont Mining Corp. ("Newmont") in 1997. 

 

In 1999, TVX entered into a strategic business partnership with Normandy Mining Ltd. 

("Normandy"), forming TVX Normandy Americas, which controlled the Project.  In 2002, 

Newmont acquired Normandy.  As a result, TVX Normandy Americas became 49.9% owned by 

Newmont and 50.1% owned by TVX. 

 

In 2003, TVX purchased Newmont's interest in TVX Normandy Americas for US$180 million. 

Also in 2003, TVX, Kinross Gold Corp. ("Kinross") and Echo Bay Mines Ltd. ("Echo Bay") 

merged and the resulting entity, Kinross, took ownership control of the Project. 

 

In November 2009, Kinross sold the Project to Jaguar for US$42.5 million.  The current status of 

the mineral tenure is described in Chapter 6 – History. 

 

4.3 REVIEW OF MINERAL PROPERTY AND TITLES IN BRAZIL 

 

In 1995, a constitutional amendment granted foreign (non-Brazilian) companies the right to hold 

majority ownership in Brazilian mineral projects.  In addition, the amendment gave foreign 

companies similar fiscal and economic treatment as those given to Brazilian entities. 

 

The 1988 Federal Constitution defines mineral resources as assets that belong to the Federal 

Government.  The Federal Government has the sole right to legislate on deposits, mines, mineral 

resources and mineral processing.  States may enact amendments to existing legislation but 

cannot create their own mining laws. 



22 
 

 

Mining is administered by a number of agencies, including: 

 

• The Ministry of Mines and Energy ("MME"): responsible for executing Government policies 

and ruling guidelines on Brazilian mineral resources, production, distribution, trade and 

consumption of mineral products. 

 

• The Brazilian Government Mining Authority ("DNPM"): planning, promoting and inspecting 

mining exploration and exploitation activities in Brazil, collection and management of statistical 

data, administration of mining-related lease grants and compliance. 

 

• The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources ("IBAMA"): 

enforces environmental laws. 

 

• State environmental authorities: establish specific regulations concerning state environmental 

licensing procedures.  State regulation must observe the minimum standards set forth by the 

Federal Government. 

 

4.3.1 Mineral Rights Tenure 

 

Exploration Licenses and Mining Concessions can be obtained by foreign mining companies.  

License holders are not subjected to statutory minimum expenditure requirements, but are 

required to comply with reporting requirements and pay annual DNPM fees.  The initial license 

is granted on a priority of application basis, that is, the "first-in" application registered with the 

DNPM is awarded the license. 

 

Exploration Licenses (granted by DNPM) 

 

The size of properties covered by exploration licenses will vary depending on the state in which 

the property is located.  In the Amazonia region of Brazil, which includes the states of 

Amazonas, Pará, Mato Grosso, Amapa, Rondonia, and Roraima, the maximum property size is 



23 
 

10,000 ha.  In other parts of the country, including the state of Maranhão where the Project is 

located, the maximum property size is 2,000 ha.   

 

Exploration licenses are granted for three (3) years and can be extended for a maximum 

additional three-year term, subject to DNPM approval.  An exploration license allows the holder 

to explore for minerals in the area of the license, but not to conduct commercial mining.  Some 

exceptions apply. 

 

Exploration License applications must include the applicant's detailed information, the elements, 

substances, or metals to be explored for, and the intended exploration area.  They must be 

accompanied by well-defined technical documents that must be prepared by a licensed 

professional geologist or mining engineer.  Such documents must include an exploration plan 

and its related budget, property maps, hard evidence of the payment of governmental fees, and 

evidence that the applicant has sufficient funds or financing to cover the budget set forth in the 

proposed exploration plan.  Licenses are deemed to have been granted when published in the 

Government Official Daily Newspaper ("DOU"). 

 

The key elements of an exploration license are as follows: 

 

• Exploration activities must commence no later than 60 (sixty) days after the exploration license 

has been published in the DOU; 

 

• Exploration cannot be halted or suspended for a period exceeding three (3) months or 120 

nonconsecutive days without due reason; 

 

• Exploration activity must be undertaken under the supervision of a professional geologist or 

mining engineer who is suitably qualified (licensed) under Brazilian and state laws; and 

 

• The DNPM must be informed whenever a mineral, metal, or mineral substance not listed in the 

exploration license is discovered during exploration.  In most cases, it is possible to amend the 

exploration license to include the additional mineral, metal or mineral substance. 

 



24 
 

A final exploration program report must be prepared and filed with the DNPM.  An exploration 

license holder has one (1) year from approval of the exploration report to apply for a Mining 

Concession or to transfer its application rights to a qualified third party.  The application period 

may be extended for longer than a year at the discretion of the DNPM. 

 

Mining Concession Title (granted by the MME, by a ministerial act that awards the mining right 

(Portaria de Lavra – "PL"). 

 

If the exploration program carried out under the Exploration License results in mineralization 

that supports mining activities, the license holder must complete the following: 

 

• An exploration study to prove the existence of mineral resources; 

 

• A feasibility study to confirm mineral reserves and their commercial viability; and 

 

• Obtaining an environmental Implementation License ("LI") to put into operation the mining 

undertaking. 

 

The MME is obliged to grant a mining concession title if the required studies have been 

completed and indicate a commercially viable mining operation.  The Mining Concession Title 

can be denied in some circumstances, as in the case of public interest taking precedence over 

mineral exploitation.  The Brazilian Government must compensate mining concession holders 

when mining licenses are denied. 

 

Once the legal and regulatory requirements are met, including the proper environmental 

licensing, and the Feasibility Study is approved by the DNPM, the mining concession is granted 

through a Ministerial Act that grants the mining right  ("Portaria de Lavra" in Portuguese).  

Concessions are deemed granted when published in the DOU. 

 

Mining licenses can only be granted to companies authorized to act as a mining company in 

accordance with Brazilian law.  Foreign investors and/or companies wishing to invest in Brazil 

will either establish a Brazilian company or subsidiary or purchase shares of an existing 



25 
 

company.  There are no limits with respect to payment of dividends abroad, provided such 

dividends are paid equally to Brazilian and foreign shareholders. 

 

Mining Concessions typically cover areas between 2,000 ha to 10,000 ha, depending on the 

location.  Mining Concessions permit the holder to implement the mining project, conduct 

mining activity and extract minerals from the mining area. 

 

The following are standard conditions in connection with mining concessions: 

 

• The proposed mining activity must be carried out within the concession area; 

 

• Mining activities set forth in the submitted feasibility study has to commence no later than six 

(6) months from the date of publication of the mining concession grant (DOU-published PL).  In 

the event of force majeure, the six-month time frame may be extended; 

 

• Mining activity must not cease for more than six (6) consecutive months once the operation has 

begun, except when  there is proof of force majeure; 

 

• The holder must follow a DNPM-approved mining plan and provide annual operational reports 

to the DNPM; 

 

• Mining activity must be carried out in accordance with environmental protection standards set 

forth in the environmental license; 

 

• The holder must pay the Compensação Financeira pela Exploração de Recursos Minerais 

("CFEM") royalty to the Brazilian Government, which is set at a maximum of three (3) percent 

of net revenue; and 

 

• At least fifty percent (50%) of the CFEM must be paid to the concession's landowner.  This 

percentage can be higher if negotiations between the concession holder and the landowner so 

dictate. 

 



26 
 

The CFEM is further explained under item 4.3.2 Annual Statutory Payments (Royalties). 

 

License Forfeiture 

 

Section 65 of the Brazilian Mining Code establishes five (5) grounds for forfeiture: 

 

• Formal abandonment of the mine;  

 

• Failure to start the exploration or mining activities as determined by the license / PL, despite 

being formally served and fined; 

 

• Conducting exploration activities that are not in accordance with the exploration license, 

despite being formally served and fined; 

 

• Continuously carrying out "ambitious mining" or conducting mining activities out of the 

concession area, despite being formally notified and fined; and 

 

• Three (3) repeated cases of failure to comply with a mine Inspector's requests or observations 

within a one-year period, despite being formally served and fined. 

 

The Brazilian Mining Code also states that any failure to comply with the obligations associated 

with exploration licenses and mining concession titles will trigger penalties, including 

notification, fines and forfeiture, in increasing order of severity. 

 

4.3.2 Annual Statutory Payments (Royalties) 

 

There are two (2) main types of fees payable by mining companies: an annual tax per hectare 

("TAH") and the CFEM. 

 

The TAH, which is payable by the concession holder annually to the DNPM, is set at R$1.90 per 

hectare for the duration of the original concession grant term.  The tax increases to R$2.87 per 

hectare for licenses that have been extended. 



27 
 

 

The CFEM is calculated based on the net revenue from the sale of a mineral product, defined as 

total of sales less tax and transportation and insurance expenses.  CFEM rates vary in accordance 

with the mineral product as follows as of the date of this Feasibility: 

 

• Gold: 1% 

• Bauxite, manganese ore, rock salt and potassium: 3% 

• Precious carbon, colored dimension stones and precious metals: 0.2%; 

• Iron ore, fertilizers, l coal and other mineral substances: 2%. 

 

Penalties are imposed if payments are not made and can vary from a notification letter to 

forfeiture of the mineral concession. 

 

4.3.3 Surface Rights 

 

Under Brazilian law, mineral rights and surface rights are distinct.  A mining company may hold 

valid mineral rights but must still negotiate with the surface rights owner or landowner.   

 

For exploration licenses, the holder is expected to pay the landowner compensation for land 

usage and any damage caused by exploration activities.  In cases where an agreement is not 

reached between the involved parties (mining company and landowner) with regards to the 

amount to be paid and/or if the landowner does not allow the company to access the area, there is 

a provision in the law that allows the parties to find a solution through the legal courts. 

 

For mining concessions , the holder must pay the landowner 50% of the CFEM as previously 

stated. Having a formal agreement with the landowner is a prerequisite for mining concession 

grant.  

 

4.3.4 Water Rights 

 

Under Brazilian Law, a number of water usages are regulated, including: 

 



28 
 

• Deviation or impounding of an existing water body for consumption, including public 

consumption or production process; 

 

• Impounding of water from an underground water body for final consumption or productive 

process; 

 

• Disposal of sewage waste and other liquid or gaseous residues, whether treated or not, into a 

water body; and 

 

• Other uses that alter the system, quantity or quality of a water body. 

 

A Water Permit (in Portuguese "Outorga") has a maximum term of 35 years and can be renewed.  

Permits typically have conditions, which primarily relate to compliance with the Water 

Resources National Plan and water quality maintenance.  Exploitation of water resources is 

under the jurisdiction of the DNPM and is subject to similar reporting and jurisdictional 

requirements as mineral resources. 

 

4.3.5 Environmental Regulations 

 

The Brazilian Constitution addresses environmental and social impacts of mining projects. 

Environmental regulations are established by the Ministry of Environment.  The National 

Environmental Council ("CONAMA") formulates the standards and policies under which 

environmental regulations are implemented. 

 

Actual control and supervision of the environmental licensing process is the responsibility of the 

Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Resources ("IBAMA").  In certain 

situations IBAMA is the lead licensing entity but in general, IBAMA oversees the review and 

authorization of environmental licenses by state environmental protection agencies. 

 

A Mining Company - as defined by the Brazilian Mining Law - that intends to implement a 

mining project in Brazil must first apply for the environmental permit known as the Previous 

License ("LP").  Typically, LP applications are submitted during the Feasibility Study stage.   



29 
 

 

In the state of Maranhão, in order to be awarded an LP, the mining company must complete the 

appropriate application and submit an Environmental Impact Study ("EIA") and an 

Environmental Impact Report ("RIMA") that are prepared using guidelines established by 

CONSEMA – Maranhão State Council for  the Environment.   All pertinent information about 

the project must be disclosed in the application, including project ownership, deforestation, and 

water usage.  Licenses are reviewed by the Secretariat for Environmental and Natural Resources 

of the state of Maranhão ("SEMA") or by the Regional Offices for the Environment 

("DREMAs").   

 

The EIA and RIMA are reviewed and analyzed by either SEMA or DREMAs.  In some cases, 

when the area has already been impacted or the soil has already been modified, environmental 

authorities can allow submittal of only an Environmental Control Report ("RCA"). 

 

After analyses by SEMA or DREMAs and after a public hearing takes place, a decision will be 

made regarding the granting of the LP.  Once the LP has been secured, the Company will apply 

for the Implementation License ("LI").  The LI will sanction the completion of important works 

in the project area, such as the erection of the mineral processing plant, construction of rejects 

and tailings dams and other disposal facilities, - access roads construction, development of 

underground, surface, and/or open pit mines, installation of the infrastructure, preparation of 

waste dump areas, etc.  Typically, LI applications are submitted during the detailed engineering 

phase.  Its award is mandatory for construction and field erection purposes.   

 

As required in the LI application form, the Company must submit an Environmental Control 

Plan ("PCA"), which addresses control issues and plans to minimize the potential impacts caused 

by the project.  The LI application and the PCA are also reviewed and analyzed by either SEMA 

or DREMAs; however, SEMA is the authority that grants the LI.  

 

After the implementation of the aforementioned project works, and, provided all environmental 

requirements are met, the Company will apply for the Operation License ("LO").

4.4 MINERAL TENURE 

 

Jaguar currently holds 32 mineral properties totaling ca 166,513 ha.  Titles are registered in the 

name of Mineração Serras do Oeste Ltda. ("MSOL") and MCT, both wholly-owned subsidiaries 

of Jaguar, and CNM.  A complete list of the mineral rights and their status and chain of 

ownership is presented in Chapter 6 of this Feasibility. 

 

4.5 ROYALTIES

4.6 SURFACE RIGHTS 

 

Jaguar currently holds no surface rights in the Project area. Jaguar is currently in negotiations 

with the local farming and garimpeiro communities to complete agreements with regards to the 

necessary surface rights for Project development. 



31 
 

 

Section 21.4 describes the process undertaken by Jaguar to guarantee land tenure.  

 

4.7 WATER RIGHTS 

 

A permit to extract water from the Gurupi River and from wells to support mining and plant 

operations will be required, as the use of all water sources, surface and underground, requires 

approval from the Natural Resources Department of SEMA, the state environmental authority.  

 

4.8 ENVIRONMENTAL 

 

Environmental considerations, studies and action plans are described under Section 21.4 of this 

Feasibility.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 

5.1 ACCESSIBILITY 

 

The Project is presently accessed via the Maracaçumé–Chega Tudo village road, a single lane 

municipal dirt road.  The Project is approximately 55 km from the paved BR316 highway 

highlighted in Figure 5.1.  The Cipoeiro deposit is 55 km from BR316 and Chega Tudo deposit 

is 64 km off the highway.  About 8 km, and a river, separate the deposits.  The international 

airport of Marechal Cunha Machado is located in São Luis, the capital of the state of Maranhão, 

located 500 km to the northeast of the Project (refer to Figure 5.1).  The city of Belém also has 

an international airport with direct daily flights to the United States.  In addition, there is a small 

airstrip for light passenger aircraft near the town of Maracaçumé.

5.2 CLIMATE 

 

The climate in the Project area is equatorial, dry in winter, and with a rainy period in summer 

(December to May). Average monthly temperatures range from 25.8°C in March to 

approximately 27.4°C in October and November.  Temperature extremes range from 17.2°C to 

37.7°C.  Rainfall in the Project area can range between 1,200 mm and 3,200 mm, averaging 

2,000 mm. Winds commonly come from the northeast and range from 1.7 m/s to 3.0 m/s.  

Mining operations are expected to be able to be conducted year-round.  Exploration field seasons 

are usually limited to the dry season as activities can be dependent on rainfall intensity.  

 

5.3 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

 

The closest town that can provide local supplies is Maracaçumé, 48 km to the northeast and the 

nearest large community is Centro Novo. 

The terrain surrounding the deposits is adequate for construction of administration, camp, mine, 

plant, tailings and rejects, and waste rock disposal facilities. At the effective date of the report, 

Jaguar holds sufficient tenure that would accommodate the required infrastructure, but has no 

surface rights currently. 

 

5.3.1 Roads 

 

Road and bridge rebuilding would be required for the Project site to have a direct link to the 

highway system.  Currently the site is accessed from paved state highway BR316 at 

Maracaçumé. From Maracaçumé access is via a single-lane, 6.5–7.5 m wide municipal dirt road 

to the village of Chega Tudo.  Cipoeiro is accessed from Chega Tudo via a 5.5 m wide dirt road. 

Seven wooden bridges and one concrete bridge occur between Cipoeiro and Maracaçumé. Both 

the bridges and the roads require upgrading to support the anticipated increase in both truckload 

size, and traffic frequency expected during mine construction and operations. 

 

  



34 
 

5.3.2 Port 

 

The recommended main supply port for the Project is the Porto Itaqui, located close to the city of 

São Luis in the State of Maranhão, and about 500 km from the Project.  The port has an annual 

capacity of 15.15 Mtpy, receives about 50 ships per month, with a maximum depth of 19 m, and 

permits ship sizes of up to Aframax class (160,000 deadweight ton).  The port is appropriately 

equipped to handle supplies for the Gurupi Project. 

 

5.3.3 Power 

 

Power to the project site is currently supplied by the local utility company CEMAR.  For 

development and operations, power will be delivered at 230 kV via a new overhead line sourced 

from the SE Encruzo substation, a total distance of about 40 km.  Emergency power will be 

provided by diesel backup generators. 

 

5.3.4 Water Supply 

 

Fresh water to the plant will be provided by Gurupi River, which is about 14 km from the Plant 

Site (See Appendix 19 – Project General Plans).  A ca 14-km pipeline will be constructed by 

Jaguar in order to provide up to 300 m3 /h from a pumping station located at the Gurupi River 

(See Appendix 05 – Project Water Balance).  A water treatment system will be installed at the 

plant site to provide proper potable water supply.   

 

5.4 PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

The physical relief in the project area varies from virtually flat to low rounded hills with about 

30 m of relief.  Secondary-growth tropical bush and open grass lands cover the vast majority of 

the area. Most of the area adjacent to the Project site is used for cattle ranching, farming, and 

logging activities.  Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro areas are crossed by small intermittent streams and 

have rural villages on the margins of the northern extent of the mineralization.

6 HISTORY 
 

Gold was first discovered in the Project area in the 17th century by colonial settlers.  During the 

early 1900s and again in the mid-1980s, intermittent small-scale production took place as part of 

a region-wide rush of artisan miners, known in Brazil as garimpeiros.  Gold was exploited from 

oxidized and weathered material, including alluvium, saprolite, and saprolite-hosted quartz veins, 

mostly from open pits limited to about 40 m in depth. Underground galleries have been of much 

lesser importance.  There are no historical records from this period; however, the production of 

about 200,000 ounces of gold has been estimated through these small-scale efforts over the past 

century or so.  This estimate is based on information passed on by long-time workers in the area.  

 

CNM Companhia Nacional de Mineração Ltda. ("CNM") commenced exploration in 1994, and 

subsequently, TVX in 1995.  Later that year, a joint venture between TVX and Santa Fe was 

established.  The Chega Tudo deposit was first drilled by targeting the known garimpo pits in the 

vicinity of the Chega Tudo village.  At Cipoeiro, mineralization was first drilled in late 1996 

following the onset of garimpeiro activity. 

 

From 1994 to 1997, exploration work programs comprised soil, saprolite, rock chip and channel 

sampling, information acquisition from airborne-photogrametry programs, topographic data 

generation, ground magnetic geophysical surveys, reconnaissance geological mapping, airborne 

magnetic and gamma-ray surveys, core and reverse circulation (RC) drilling, and metallurgical 

testwork.  The resulting data enabled a first-time mineral resource estimate. 

 

In 1996, Santa Fe hired Kilborn Engineering to perform a scoping study.  Kilborn's work 

suggested a carbon-in-leach ("CIL") processing facility to treat 30,000 tpd.  The design 

metallurgical recovery, at scoping level, was estimated at about 94%. 

 

In 1997, Newmont purchased Santa Fe and assumed control of the Project.  Between 1997 and 

2000, Newmont conducted exploration work at the property, including geological mapping, 

geochemical sampling, airborne electromagnetic survey, ground magnetic and induced 

polarization ("IP") surveys, core and RC drilling, core re-logging program, metallurgical 



36 
 

testwork with a strong focus on comminution indices, construction of geological models, and 

estimation of mineralized bodies' resource grades and tonnages (referred to as "reserve" 

estimates in internal documents at the time). 

 

In 1999, TVX ordered an independent mineral reserve estimate.  

 

In 2000, Newmont put the Project on care-and-maintenance.  

 

In 2003, Kinross acquired 100% of the Project, following a merger with TVX, which had 

repurchased the Newmont interest.  Kinross completed infill and definition core drill programs at 

the Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro Targets, metallurgical testwork, bulk and solids density 

determinations, and updated the mineral resource estimates.  In 2005, an unpublished feasibility 

study was commissioned and completed by AMEC.  This study indicated the Project yielded no 

significant profit.  

 

The AMEC feasibility study envisioned mining to be performed by conventional open pit 

techniques, while the process route considered a Primary Crushing, Semi-Autogenous Grinding 

("SAG") Mill, Ball Milling, and Stripping and Electrowinning Plant following a Leaching-CIP 

circuit. 

 

From 2006 through 2008, Kinross resumed mineral exploration for the Project with the intention 

of investigating other potential targets that could increase mineral resources.    

 

In 2009, Jaguar entered into negotiations with Kinross to acquire MCT Mineração Ltda. 

("MCT"), the Kinross Brazilian subsidiary that controlled the Project.  Jaguar then 

commissioned Pincock, Allen and Holt ("PAH") to conduct a re-estimation of mineral resources, 

which was completed in early December 2009 and filed on SEDAR.  Shortly thereafter Jaguar 

acquired MCT and commissioned AMEC to prepare a prefeasibility study to identify cost-

savings areas and additional requirements to proceed to feasibility study level.  AMEC's 

prefeasibility was completed and filed on SEDAR in May 2010.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 

7.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 

 

The Gurupi Project area lies within an elongate northwest–southeast-trending shear zone 

developed along the boundary between a Lower Proterozoic metamorphic belt (Gurupi 

greenstone belt) and the southwestern margin of the Archaean São Luis craton (Figure 7-1). 

 

The São Luis Craton comprises suites of calc-alkaline granitoids that range in age from 2165–

2149 Ma and intruded older greenschist to lower-amphibolite facies metavolcano–sedimentary 

rocks dated at 2,240 Ma. Schists of variable compositions, metavolcanic and metapyroclastic 

rocks, as well as subordinate quartzite, metachert and metamaficultramafic rocks form the 

metavolcano–sedimentary succession of the Aurizona Group. 

 

The Tromaí Intrusive Suite is the largest unit of the craton, forming composite batholiths of 

tonalite, trondhjemite, granodiorite and minor monzogranite with variable textural and structural 

aspects. 

 

The Gurupi greenstone belt may represent a portion of a fold belt that surrounded the craton and 

once constituted its foreland.  It comprises north-northwest–south-southeasttrending volcano-

sedimentary and metasedimentary sequences that are tectonically intercalated with amphibolite 

facies gneisses and were intruded by different generations of granitoids. 

 

The volcano-sedimentary sequence (Chega Tudo Formation) consists of alternating felsic to 

mafic volcanic rocks and detrital (± chert) sedimentary rocks that underwent metamorphism 

under greenschist to lower-amphibolite conditions. Most of the rocks show a well-developed 

schistosity and/or mylonitic fabric, and locally can be folded. 

 

The metasedimentary rocks consist of two sequences.  The Gurupi Group is composed of detrital 

rocks of variable composition, including carbonaceous phyllite and schist, and coarser-grained 

quartz–mica schist, recording metamorphism under sub- to uppergreenschist conditions.  The 



46 
 

second assemblage comprises amphibolite facies schists and feldspathic to aluminous quartzites 

grouped as the Marajupema Formation. 

 

Age dates of 2,148–2,160 Ma have been returned from the volcanic units, whereas the sediments 

returned age dates indicating deposition in the Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic. 

 

Figure 7.1: Regional Geological Map 

 
 

Orthogneisses of the Itapeva Complex (ca. 2,167–2,594 Ma), which are middle to upper 

amphibolite facies, foliated and banded rocks that show localized migmatization, are tectonically 

intercalated with the supracrustal rocks (Figure 7-2).  Granitoids of variable chemical affinities 



47 
 

and ages (2,100 to 2,080 Ma) intruded and/or were tectonically intercalated within the 

supracrustal sequences and the gneisses. Large wedges of the calc-alkaline granitoids have been 

strongly affected by the Tentugal shear zone in the boundary zone between the São Luís craton 

and the Gurupi belt and have been incorporated into the framework of the belt. 

 

Two Neoproterozoic intrusions are known to occur in the greenstone belt, a granite and a 

metamorphosed nepheline–syenite body.  Small sedimentary basins, formed in depressions of 

both the São Luís craton and the Gurupi belt and likely represent postorogenic basins related to 

the final stages of Neoproterozoic events.  The basins comprise sandstones, arkoses and 

conglomerates, with subordinate occurrences of pelites, representing continental clastic 

sediments deposited in semi-arid conditions. 

 

Most of the gold deposits and showings of the Gurupi greenstone belt, including Chega Tudo and 

Cipoeiro, are hosted in structures associated with the strike-slip, sinistral Tentugal shear zone. 

The shear zone is continuous for over 120 km and in places reaches 30 km in width, forming a 

corridor of shear zones with variable structural aspects that were developed under ductile–brittle 

and greenschist facies conditions.  The highly-strained rocks correspond to metapelites and 

metavolcanic rocks of the Chega Tudo Formation, whereas the less deformed rocks correspond 

to coarse-grained tonalites of the Tromaí Intrusive Suite (refer to Figure 7-2). 

 

7.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY 

 

7.2.1 Chega Tudo Deposit 

 

7.2.1.1 Lithologies 

 

The dacite metavolcanic unit is the primary host for mineralization.  It is well foliated, almost 

schistose with occasional mylonitic bands.  Small, 1 mm to 2 mm stretched quartz eyes are a 

diagnostic feature, as is abundant sericite. Mafic minerals are rare, with chlorite and biotite 

present in areas of shearing or lesser alteration.  The rock is primarily composed of quartz, 

sericite and plagioclase.  Where mineralized, pyrite reaches 1% or more in abundance, along 

foliation seams and less commonly with quartz as cross-cutting veinlets. 



48 
 

 

The dacite unit reaches 100 m in thickness and can be followed for about 2 km of strike. The 

units appear to be thin or absent along the Tentugal shear away from the Chega Tudo deposit. 
 

Figure 7.2: Geology Map, Southeastern Gurupi Belt 

 
 

A series of dark mafic igneous rocks intersected in drill core have been described as gabbros. 

The rocks do not host any significant mineralization and appear to cause pinchouts and 

terminations of mineralized pods.  Where least altered, the unit is a coarsely crystalline 

pyroxene–plagioclase intrusive rock.  It becomes increasingly fine-grained toward its contacts, 

which are typically sheared. The gabbro is commonly altered to a carbonate–chlorite assemblage. 

The mafic unit tends to pinch and swell rapidly along strike and although generally conformable 

with the shear-foliation of the Tentugal zone, it crosscuts older units and ranges from a few 

meters to as much as 100 m in thickness. 



49 
 

 

The second metavolcanic unit is interpreted to be an andesite.  The unit consists of a dark green 

fine-grained rock of igneous origin present on the west, above the dacite metavolcanics. The unit 

hosts some mineralization, but tends to be a less preferred mineralization host, with chlorite–

carbonate alteration predominating.  The andesite is not continuous along the shear zone, but 

appears to be attenuated and boudinaged on a large scale. 

 

The eastern contact of the Tentugal Shear is formed by a 50 m to 200 m thick package of fine- to 

medium-grained arkosic arenite.  This metasedimentary unit forms a 30 m topographic high 

elongated parallel to the shear.  Sericite to coarse muscovite is common, along with bands and 

layers of magnetite.  The arenite hosts a very minor amount of mineralization, typically as 

discrete quartz veins up to 2 m in width and persisting along a few hundred meters of strike. 

 

Structurally above the dacite–andesite–gabbro package that contains the Chega Tudo 

mineralization is a thick sequence of very fine-grained sedimentary rocks that have strongly 

developed foliation.  Lithologies vary from chlorite schist to graphite schist and sericite schist. 

The section hosts gold mineralization along most of its known strike-length of 20+ km; however, 

the occurrences tend to consist of narrow quartz veins of limited strike length. 

 

Figure 7.3 shows the local geology of the Chega Tudo deposit area.  Figure 7.4 presents a cross-

section through the deposit.  A drill intercept correlation plan is shown in Figure 7.5.  This plan 

displays the grade and thicknesses for the deposit over an approximate 400 m of strike.

expected pit limits. Gold mineralization outlines shown in red on the drill hole traces represent 

the mineralization that grades above the 0.2 g/t Au assay cutoff. 

 

7.2.1.2 Alteration 

 

Rocks in the deposit area have been widely affected by hydrothermal alteration. A wide variety 

of alteration assemblages have developed depending upon the original lithology; however, these 

have been assigned within two mappable zones: 

 

• Quartz–sericite–pyrite; 

• Chlorite–carbonate–epidote. 



52 
 

 

Mineralization is found solely within zones of quartz–sericite–pyrite alteration, whereas the 

chlorite–carbonate–epidote alteration extends throughout the Tentugal shear zone. 

Mineralization is very closely related to the degree of pyrite introduction. Sericite and quartz 

replacement forms a broader more diffuse halo beyond the limits of potentially economic gold 

deposition. Pyrite occurs as thin stringers and disseminations along the foliation planes; to a 

lesser degree it occurs with quartz as thin veinlets conformable to locally cross-cutting foliation. 

Pyrite contents range from zero to upwards of 5% and typically average about 1% to 2% with 

mineralization.

53 
 

7.2.1.3 Structure 

 

The Chega Tudo deposit occurs within the central core of the 120 km long Tentugal shear zone. 

Gold occurrences are known throughout the entire length of this major greenstone belt shear and 

are concentrated within the highest-strain portion that can reach 300 m in width. 

 

The shear has produced intense foliation and cleavage planes striking at 320° and dipping steeply 

west to vertical. Zones of gold mineralization are closely conformable with the foliation.  No 

cross faults have been mapped in the deposit area due to the paucity of outcrop.  Northwest-

trending faults are interpreted to cut the deposit based on topographic features and rapid changes 

in the width of rock units. 

 

7.2.1.4 Mineralization 

 

The Chega Tudo deposit comprises a series of discontinuous mineralized zones that are confined 

to highly strained rocks related to 50–150 m wide shear zones developed over the volcano-

sedimentary rocks of the Chega Tudo Formation at the contact between this formation and 

tonalites of the Tromaí Intrusive Suite.  Mineralized zones are broadly conformable to the 

subvertical mylonitic foliation, parallel to the strike and have irregular to lensoidal shapes. 

 

Gold is associated with quartz–sericite–pyrite alteration that is generally conformable to the 

N40W, 80–90SW foliation trend of the shear zone.  Typically, mineralization forms enechelon 

pods elongated with the shear foliation and persisting for tens to hundreds of meters of strike and 

an unknown distance down dip. These northwest-trending, steeply southwest-dipping 

mineralized zones range from a few meters to as much as 30 m in width and can form multiple 

pods that can be as much as 100–200 m wide. 

 

7.2.1.5 Weathering 

Surficial weathering has completely destroyed the original mineralogy and textures, forming a 

saprolitic clay to depths as great as 40 m with an average of approximately 25 m.  In this 



54 
 

saprolite zone, gold occurs as free grains, in an oxidized matrix.  Laterite is absent over the 

deposit area. 

 

7.2.2 Cipoeiro Deposit 

 

7.2.2.1 Lithologies 

 

Two main litho-types are recognized at Cipoeiro, a tonalite and an arkosic fine-grained arenite 

with thin quartz–pebble conglomerate layers.  The arkosic unit is correlated with the bounding 

arkose at Chega Tudo. 

 

The primary mineralization host is a coarse equigranular intrusive of tonalitic composition. 

Plagioclase of calcic affinity is the most abundant mineral phase, with up to 15% biotite and 

lesser amphibole dispersed in a fine grained quartz–feldspar matrix.  Occasionally where matrix 

is predominant, the rock becomes slightly porphyritic.  In other areas, the coarse, equigranular 

tonalite is mixed with fine equigranular, dark, mafic tonalite.  The rock presents moderate 

pervasive saussurite feldspar alteration overprinted by strong to intense silica–sericite–chlorite 

alteration related to ductile shearing.  The tonalite is recessive and strongly weathered to 

saprolite to depths of 5 m to 30 m.  Based on geophysical data and drill intercepts, the tonalite 

forms a large intrusive body that is elongated in a north-westerly direction.  The body extends for 

several tens of kilometers and may be as much as 4 km wide. 

 

The west side of the deposit is bounded by a thick package of fine- to medium-grained arkosic 

arenite with common magnetite layers and cross-bands and minor bands of quartz–pebble 

conglomerates.  The clastic sediment unit is several hundred meters thick, strikes parallel to the 

northwest-trending Tentugal shear zone and dips moderately to the southwest.  The contact with 

the tonalite is marked by 5 m to 20 m of brittle shearing, chlorite alteration and variable 

silicification. 

 

Figure 7.6 shows the local geology of the Cipoeiro deposit area.  Figures 7.7 and 7.8 present 

cross-sections through the deposit.

expected pit limits.  Gold mineralization outlines shown in red on the drill hole traces represent 

the mineralization that grades above the 0.2 g/t Au assay cut-off. 

 

7.2.2.2 Alteration 

 

The hydrothermal system at Cipoeiro was chemically similar to that at Chega Tudo.  Silica 

flooding and replacement of the tonalite is more intense and more widespread than seen in the 

metavolcanics at Chega Tudo.  However, gold remains most closely associated with sulfide 

(pyrite) introduction and quartz–sericite alteration. Chloritic alteration is strong within the core 



58 
 

of the ductile shears and as a widespread sausseritic halo affecting the biotite and amphibole 

mafic minerals, together with carbonate alteration of the feldspars. 

 

7.2.2.3 Structure 

 

The Central Fault Zone (CFZ) separates the two main mineralized zones in the Cipoeiro deposit. 

The fault strikes at approximately 100° azimuth, dipping steeply to the south–southwest.  The 

fault zone is characterized by a strong brittle deformation zone (10 m interval) with chlorite–

kaolinite ± quartz ± carbonate ± pyrite and intense fracturing. 

 

The North Fault Zone (NFZ) is interpreted from an offset of about 450 m on the surface contact 

between arenites and tonalite.  The fault zone trace has an approximate strike azimuth of 100° 

and dips gently (30° to 40°) to the south–southwest. 

 

Both the CFZ and NFZ are considered to be post-mineralization in age.  The contact between the 

tonalite and arenites is faulted.  The shearing is brittle–ductile and forms a zone ranging from a 

few meters to as much as 30 m.  The sheared zone is called the Contact Fault (CF) and has both 

pre-mineral and post-mineral movement components.  The fault zone is marked by strong 

chlorite–sericite alteration as well as by meter-scale to sub-meter scale massive quartz veins.  

The fault zone has a 330° azimuth in the southern part of the deposit, whereas in the northern 

part of the deposit, the azimuth is about 40°.  The CF has a steep dip (80°), that can be to either 

the east–southeast, or east–northeast.  Near the intersections with the CFZ and NFZ the dip angle 

becomes more gentle (30°) because of the drag fault effects. 

 

7.2.2.4 Mineralization 

 

Gold mineralization at the Cipoeiro deposit is confined to ductile–brittle shear zones within a 

tonalite intrusive adjacent to its structural contact with arenaceous metasediments. Gold 

concentrations are associated with pyrite veinlets and quartz–sericite alteration which have 

developed in the tonalite where it is moderately foliated due to ductile shearing. Figure 7.9 

shows a set of sections that display the grade and thicknesses for the deposit over an approximate 

150 m of strike. 



59 
 

 
Figure 7-9: Drill Hole Intercept Correlation Plan 

 

 
Note: Figure prepared in 2008 by Kinross; assay results and drilled thicknesses from the drill hole marked "pending" are in line with  
expectations of grades and thicknesses as indicated in the figure. 

 

Two zones of mineralization have been defined, the Contact Ore Zone on the south and the 

Blanket Ore Zone to the north.  The zones are separated by the Central Fault Zone (CFZ). 

 

The Contact Ore Zone consists of a series of small shears and zones of quartz–sericite–pyrite 

alteration that intensifies towards the tonalite–arenite contact.  Anomalous gold levels occur 

from the contact outwards for about 100 m, with economic concentrations forming lensoid 

bodies from a few meters to as much as 60 m in width, generally parallel to the shear contact. 

The main mineralized zone has a strike length of 600 m and is open at depth, below the current 

limit 150 m limit of drilling. Mineralization appears to weaken and pinch out on the south and 

terminates at the CFZ to the north. 

 



60 
 

The Blanket Ore Zone has a semi-convex shape with a 40° azimuth and 10° to 50° southeasterly 

dip that flattens eastward, away from the tonalite–arenite fault contact. 

 

Mineralization follows a diffuse ductile shear that cross-cuts the tonalite and is associated with 

quartz–sericite–pyrite alteration within moderately to strongly foliated tonalite.  The Blanket Ore 

Zone ranges from a few meters to as much as 50 m in width. It has a strikelength of about 800 m, 

crops out on surface to the west, and is open down-dip, at depths below 150 m, on the east.  It is 

bounded on the south by the CFZ and on the north by the NFZ. 

 

7.2.2.5 Weathering 

 

The saprolite at Cipoeiro is only thinly preserved over the arkosic arenite and persists to depths 

of 1 m to 30 m over the tonalite. 



61 
 

8. DEPOSIT TYPES 

 

The Project deposits are considered to be typical of mesothermal vein-style, or orogenic-style 

gold deposits. The discussion below is sourced from Moritz (2000), Goldfarb et al., (2005), and 

Groves et al., (1998; 2003).  Orogenic deposits have many synonyms, including mesozonal and 

hypozonal deposits, lode gold, shear zone-related quartz–carbonate deposits, or gold-only 

deposits. 

 

Orogenic gold deposits occur in variably deformed metamorphic terranes formed during Middle 

Archaean to younger Precambrian, and continuously throughout the Phanerozoic. 

 

The host geological environments are typically volcano-plutonic or clastic sedimentar terranes, 

but gold deposits can be hosted by any rock type.  There is a consistent spatial and temporal 

association with granitoids of a variety of compositions.  Host rocks are metamorphosed to 

greenschist facies, but locally can achieve amphibolite or granulite facies conditions. 

 

Global examples of these deposits include Muruntau (Uzbekistan), Golden Mile (Australia), 

Hollinger–McIntyre–Moneta (Canada), Jamestown (USA), and Obuasi (Ghana).  

 

Gold deposition occurs adjacent to first-order, deep-crustal fault zones.  These first-order faults, 

which can be hundreds of kilometers long and kilometers wide, show complex structural 

histories.  Economic mineralization typically formed as vein fill of second- and third-order 

shears and faults, particularly at jogs or changes in strike along the crustal fault zones. 

Mineralization styles vary from stockworks and breccias in shallow, brittle regimes, through 

laminated crack-seal veins and sigmoidal vein arrays in brittle-ductile crustal regions, to 

replacement- and disseminated-type orebodies in deeper, ductile environments. 

 

Mineralization can be disseminated, or vein hosted, and displays a timing that is structurally late, 

and is syn- to post-peak metamorphic.  Quartz is the primary constituent of veins, with lesser 

carbonate and sulfide minerals.  Minor accessory albite, chlorite, white mica (fuchsite in 

ultramafic host rocks), tourmaline, and scheelite can accompany the veins.  Carbonates include 



62 
 

calcite, dolomite, and ankerite.  Sulfide minerals can include pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, 

galena, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite.  Gold is usually associated with sulfide minerals, but can 

occur as free gold. 

 

In volcano-plutonic settings, pyrite and pyrrhotite are the most common sulfide minerals in 

greenschist and amphibolite grade host rocks, respectively.  Arsenopyrite can be the predominant 

sulfide mineral in mineralization hosted by sedimentary rocks.  Gold-to-silver ratios typically 

range from 5:1 to 10:1 and, less commonly, the ratios can reach 1:1. 

 

Most orogenic gold deposits contain 2% to 5% sulfide minerals and gold fineness >900. 

Alteration intensity is related to distance from the hydrothermal fluid source, and typically 

displays a zoned pattern.  Scale, intensity, and mineralogy of the alteration are functions of wall 

rock composition and crustal level.  The main alteration minerals include carbonate (calcite, 

dolomite, and ankerite), sulfides (pyrite, pyrrhotite or arsenopyrite), alkali-rich silicate minerals 

(sericite, fuchsite, albite, and less commonly, K-feldspar, biotite, paragonite), chlorite, and 

quartz. 

 

The larger examples of orogenic deposits are generally 2 km to 10 km long, about 1 km wide, 

and can persist over 1 km to 2 km vertical extents.

9 MINERALIZATION 

 

A discussion of the mineralization styles and related depth, width (thickness), orientation and 

continuity is presented for the Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro deposits in Chapter 7.  The discussion 

in this section of this Feasibility relates to the mineralization type, character, and mineralogy of 

the deposit. 

 

Gold occurs in various forms and associations within the metadacite, andesite, arenite and 

tonalite units and their weathered, saprolitic derivatives. 

 

In saprolite, the host rock is almost entirely kaolinitic clays and oxidation of the original sulfides 

is total.  Gold is present as small free grains.  Metallic screen analysis of saprolitic mineralization 

above both deposits has found no significant coarse (+150 mesh) gold component. 

 

Below the weathered zone, sulfides are preserved and consist largely of fine-grained anhedral 

pyrite, with very minor pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, and chalcopyrite.  Trace lead-silver tellurides 

have been noted.  Gold in polished sections occurs as micrometer-size grains associated with 

pyrite and the trace chalcopyrite.  The very fine particles typically are found within the pyrite 

and on fractures within the pyrite. 

 

Coarse gold is not seen in drill core, not even in the high-grade intervals.  The auriferous pyrite 

tends to be disseminated along foliation, reaching volumes estimated at 0.5% to 5%. 

 

Klein et al., (2008), concluded, following detailed studies using fluid inclusion and stable isotope 

(O, H, C, and S) data, that deposition of auriferous quartz veins and stringers of auriferous pyrite 

occurred in dilatational sites (fractures, foliation openings, vein-wall rock contacts) under 

fluctuating pressure conditions. 

Mineralization at Chega Tudo occurred in response to complex and concurrent processes 

involving fluid immiscibility, fluid-rock reactions, and possibly fluid mixing. Mineralization at 

Cipoeiro was precipitated at a narrow temperature range of 305–319ºC, from a reduced fluid.

10 EXPLORATION 
 

Exploration was undertaken by TVX, Santa Fe, Newmont or Kinross, using their  own personnel 

or  contractors.   

 

Exploration activities on the Project have included acquisition of airborne photogrammetry base, 

topographic data, reconnaissance, regional and detailed geological mapping, soil, saprolite, rock 

chip and channel sampling, ground and airborne geophysical surveys, reverse circulation ("RC") 

and diamond drilling, mineralization characterization studies and metallurgical testing of 

samples. Petrographic, fluid inclusion, stable isotope studies, and density measurements on the 

different lithologies have also been carried out. 

 

10.1 GRIDS AND SURVEYS 

 

Initial exploration activity used a local grid.  During the initial Project work, about 1,603 line 

kilometers of grid were cut. 

 

During 2004, Kinross performed a 2 m-resolution topographic survey of the garimpeiros' pits. 

Topography was checked based on field surveys completed by licensed Brazilian surveyors 

using modern Total Station survey instruments. The field surveys confirmed the current limits of 

the garimpeiros' pits in the topographic surface. 

 

Jaguar has contracted licensed surveyors to check coordinates of topographic landmarks, and 

monuments, and to install new landmarks for the Detailed Engineering phase. TechnoMine has 

reviewed the surveyors work, and confirmed that accuracy is sufficient for a feasibility level of 

confidence. For Detailed Engineering another survey with the appropriate level of accuracy is 

planned. 

 

  



65 
 

10.2 GEOLOGICAL MAPPING 

 

Regional and detailed geological mapping was completed in several phases.  Map scales varied 

from regional (1:50,000) to local (1:500). Regional scale mapping was based on a 

photogrammetry base; prospect-scale mapping used grids for control. 

 

Map results were used to identify areas of quartz veining, alteration, and sulfide outcrop that 

warranted additional work. Interpretation of air photoswas used to vector into areas that required 

more detailed geological mapping and sampling. 

 

10.3 GEOCHEMISTRY 

 

Soil, saprolite, rock chip and channel sampling were used to evaluate mineralization potential 

and generate targets for RC and diamond drilling. A total of 42,024 soil, rock chip, and saprolite 

samples were taken, primarily in areas of known garimpeiros workings.  Channel sampling of 

the garimpeiros pits and excavations totalled 6,277 samples.  

 

10.4 GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS 

 
Airborne geophysical surveys, comprising magnetic, radiometric and electromagnetic ("EM") 

data acquisition, treatment, and interpretation were used to vector into mineralization and 

generate targets for drill programs.  Surveys were performed by contract expert geophysical 

firms. The airborne magnetic and radiometric survey covered about 10,180 line km, in an area of 

about 1,900 km2. The EM Survey covered an area of about 497 km2, corresponding to 

approximately 2,655 line km.  Airborne geophysical anomalies were checked on the ground 

using ground geophysics Magnetics and Induced Polarization ("IP") surveys. 

 

Ground surveys were performed by Newmont and Kinross personnel. Ground magnetic surveys 

were performed at Chega Tudo, covering 43 line km and an area of approximately 10 km2.  A 

total of 64 line km of IP surveys were completed at Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo, covering a total 

area of 22 km2. 

 



66 
 

Geophysical surveying has been effective in mapping sulfide mineralization that could include 

gold mineralization associated with regional structural trends and associated splay structures.

10.5 DRILLING 

 

Drilling completed on the Project is discussed in Chapter 11 of this Report. 

 

10.6 DENSITY 

 

Density data collected to date on the Project are discussed in Chapter 12 of this Report. 

 

10.7 GEOTECHNICAL AND HYDROLOGY 

 

Geotechnical and hydrological studies were performed in the period 2003–2005, and by Jaguar 

in 2010,  to support the design of open pits, ore and waste stockpiles, tailings and rejects storage 

facilities, water discharge, sediment control, other environmental controls, and monitoring 

systems for this Feasibility. This work is discussed in Sections 21.1, 21.2 and 21.4. 

 

10.8 OTHER STUDIES 

 

The Brazilian Geological Service ("CPRM") undertook detailed geological, mineralogical, 

isotopic and age-dating studies on the Gurupi Belt, which included generating chemical data for 

hydrothermal chlorites and stable isotope (O, H, C, S) compositions of silicate, carbonate, and 

sulfide minerals from the Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro deposits. These chemical and isotopic 

results, in addition to field, structural, and petrographic information, enabled the CPRM staff 

participating in the studies to discuss petrogenesis-related variables of the Cipoeiro and Chega 



67 
 

Tudo deposits, including temperature and redox conditions of mineralization, as well as possible 

sources for fluids and metals. 

 

Such data have a major influence on metallogeny models for exploration, and therefore on 

exploration program layouts. 

 

Five mineralization samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy to aid in gold 

mineralogy determinations.  The results were used to define the mineralogy described in Chapter 

9. 

  



68 
 

 

11 DRILLING 
 

Drilling on the Project has consisted of 448 core holes (67,940.70 m) and 258 reverse circulation 

("RC") drill holes (27,518.66 m) for a total 706 holes drilled (95,495.36 m). 

 

A drill location plan for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits is included as Figure 11.1. 

 

11.1 DRILL CONTRACTORS 

 

The two (2) main drill contractors have been Geosol - Geologia e Sondagens S/A and WFS 

Sondagens Ltda - Servitec.   

 

11.2 DRILL METHODS 

 

The RC holes were drilled using 3.5-inch (88.9 mm) rods with a nominal 4.5-inch (114.3 mm) 

diameter hole. RC samples were collected at regular 1-m intervals in plastic bags at the sample 

cyclone. The entire sample was then transported back to the field sample preparation facility for 

drying, splitting and preparation. 

 

Core diameters are consistently HQ (63.5 mm) diameter core from surface through the saprolite 

to bedrock. At depths of about 1 m to 3 m into bedrock the holes were reduced to NQ (47.6 mm) 

diameter to the final hole depth. 

 

Core was transferred to wooden core boxes and brought to the Project core processing facility 

where it was photographed, logged for geological and geotechnical information, and sampled. 

Transportation of core boxes to the Newmont-built, well-organized and well-maintained Core 

Shed was done by personnel from the company that was managing the drill program, or the 

drilling supervisor. 

 



69 
 

11.3 GEOLOGICAL LOGGING 

 

Logging of RC drill cuttings and core utilized standard logging procedures. Initial logging 

utilized paper forms, with manually-entered data into a database from the form. 

 

Samples were geologically logged with a system for identifying lithologies, alteration 

assemblage, degree of ductile shearing, quartz veining, and sulfide content. Kinross added 

geotechnical logging to the program in 2003. 

 

Figure 11.1: Drill Hole Location Plan, Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo Deposits 

 
 

In 1998 Newmont relogged all of the drill core and select RC hole samples from Cipoeiro. The 

relogging focused on identifying and coding into a drill sample database some key features 

associated with the mineralization including: sulfide percent, quartz–sericite alteration and shear 

foliation. 

 



70 
 

All drill cores were photographed prior to splitting and a photographic record is kept with all 

drill logs. 

 

11.4 COLLAR SURVEYS 

 

Drill collar coordinates were gathered during the 1990s drill campaigns using hand-held GPS 

instruments. 

 

Drill collars for the 2003 to 2008 drill holes were surveyed prior to the rig occupying the site and 

after completion of the hole. Surveys were performed using digital GPS and Total Station 

instruments.  Only the final completed hole survey was used in the Project database. 

 

11.5 DOWNHOLE SURVEYS 

 

Down hole surveys of core holes have been performed using Ezy-shot and Tropari instruments. 

RC holes were not typically down-hole surveyed. 

 

11.6 RECOVERY 

 

Detailed measurements of core recovery have been routinely recorded on geological logs for 

virtually all the core holes. 

 

Tonalite and dacite recoveries generally exceeded 95%.  Although in near-surface, saprolitic 

material core recovery varied considerably, the overall recovery consistently exceeded 85% to 

90%. 

 

11.7 DEPOSIT DRILLING 

 

Drill holes have been drilled on oblique northeast–southwest 50-m drill fences, with holes drilled 

at 50-m intervals along these sections. 

 



71 
 

At Chega Tudo the majority of drill holes have angles between 40º to 60º to the southwest; 

however, due to restrictions on drill hole collar locations in areas close to Chega Tudo village, 

some drill holes were directed to the northeast. Several holes have been directed in slightly 

varied orientation to the fences. Mineralization at Chega Tudo typically dips approximately 

80ºSW with a true thickness of 10–50 m, comprising individual "lodes" ranging in thickness 

from 2–20 m. 

 

Drill holes within the Chega Tudo deposit are based on a grid line that has a baseline with a 

northwest–southeast orientation. Sections along the base line have irregular spacings, ranging 

from 25 m to 80 m. Drill holes are spaced along the lines at 30–60 m spacings.  Drilling that 

supports estimation comprises 42 RC holes (3,426 m) and 83 core holes (11,727 m). 

 

The majority of drilling directed at the Contact Zone mineralization within Cipoeiro has a 60º 

angle to the southwest.  The drilling directed at the Blanket Zone has a variety of angle due to the 

varying dip of the deposit.  Almost all of the drilling is directed to the southwest.  At Cipoeiro, 

the Contact Zone dips to the NE at approximately 45º to 60º, while the Blanket Zone has a 

variable dip to the south between 10º to 50º. 

 

The Cipoeiro drill holes fall within two drilling grids.  The first grid, covering an area of 2,450 m 

x 380 m within the Contact Zone, has a base line that is oriented north–northwest–south–

southeast. Section lines within the grid are irregular; line spacings range between 50 m and 100 

m. Drill holes are typically spaced at 50 m along the lines.  The second grid covers the Blanket 

Zone and covers an area of about 1,100 m x 600 m. The grid base line has a north–northeast–

south–southwest alignment. Section lines are spaced irregularly along the baseline, varying from 

60 m to 90 m. Drill hole spacing along the lines ranges from 40 m to 80 m. Drilling that supports 

estimation comprises 40 RC holes (4,086 m) and 124 core holes (19,164 m). 

 

A drill hole location plan for the Chega Tudo deposit is included as Figure 11.2. The drill hole 

locations for the Cipoeiro deposit are included in Figure 11.3.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 

12.1 GEOCHEMICAL SAMPLING 

 

Geochemical samples were collected during early-stage exploration and where not used for 

resource estimation.  

 

12.2 CHANNEL SAMPLING 

 

Channel samples were typically systematically sampled and assayed over a one-meter interval 

with the objective of providing representative samples of the saprolite-hosted mineralization. 

These channel samples were collected using standard sample procedures, considered of 

acceptable quality and suitable for use in mineral resource estimation during the previous studies. 

 

For this Feasibility, channel samples were used as a guide for interpreting geology and grade 

wireframes, and were not used for gold grade estimation. 

 

12.3 RC SAMPLING 
 

RC cuttings were continuously sampled at one-meter intervals from the collar to the end of each 

drill hole. The material was then transported back to the field sample preparation facility where it 

was dried and then split by cone-and-quartering methods. 

 

RC samples were collected and placed in marked plastic bags which were placed in sacks and 

then shipped to the assay laboratory. Sample submission forms listed the samples included in the 

shipment. Any discrepancies were reported by the laboratory once the sample consignments 

were received. 

 

  



75 
 

12.4 CORE SAMPLING 
 

All diamond drill hole core, since the Project inception, has been sampled by sawing the core 

into halves. One-half is then collected for analysis and one-half kept in the core box for storage 

at the Project Site-located Core Shed. 

 

Core is typically continuously sampled at one-meter intervals from the collar to the end of each 

drill hole. Where required by changes in lithology, mineralization, or alteration, core samples 

may be shorter or longer than the typical 1 m; samples in the database have a minimum core 

length of 20 cm, and a maximum core length of 2 m. 

 

Core samples were collected and placed in marked plastic, in sacks, and shipped to the assay 

laboratories further defined herein.  Sample submission forms listed the samples included in the 

shipment. Any discrepancies were reported by the laboratory once the sample consignments 

were received. 

 

12.5 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 

 

The quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) programs for the Project are discussed in 

Chapter 13. 

 

12.6 SOLIDS DENSITY DETERMINATIONS  

 

The Project density contains 327 determinations for Chega Tudo and 230 for Cipoeiro. 

Determinations were primarily on half-cores.  Some measurements were performed on bulk 

samples taken from the garimpeiros pits.  All measurements were made using water-immersion 

techniques. Measurements were performed by Newmont and Santa Fe personnel, Zonge 

Engineering, and Lakefield-Brasil Laboratory. 

 

For the purposes of the unpublished 2005 feasibility study, a total of 50 density measurements 

were made for the saprolite at Chega Tudo. Both wet and dry density measurements were carried 

out. The average wet density was 1.95 g/cm3; the average dry density was 1.59 g/cm3. 



76 
 

 

A total of 278 wet density measurements were made, that represent the various bedrock units 

identified at Chega Tudo. The resulting wet density average, for each lithological unit defined,is, 

in g/cm3   (or t/m3):      

 

Andesite    2.80  

Metavolcanics   2.72  

Dacite tuff   2.70  

Gabbro    2.80  

Graphite schist   2.69  

Dacite porphyry   2.69  

Metasediments   2.74  

 

An average 2% moisture content was estimated for the bedrock units at Chega Tudo. 

 

A total of 26 density measurements were made from the saprolite at Cipoeiro, for the 2005 in-

house feasibility study. Both wet and dry density measurements were made. The average wet and 

dry densities were 1.88 g/cm3and 1.53 g/cm3, respectively.  A total of 60 density measurements 

were made from the tonalite unit.  The average wet density obtained for the tonalite was 2.72 

g/cm3.  An average moisture content of 2% was estimated for the tonalite based on the dry 

density results. 

 

After the 2005 feasibility study, Kinross personnel produced a global value for each of oxide, 

transition and sulfide mineralization within the two deposits.  These are summarized in Table 

12.1. 

Table 12.1: Density Summary Table 
 

Area                       Oxide              Transition             Sulfide

Cipoeiro                  1.53                   2.30                       2.72 

 

The averages shown in Table 12.1 were used in the Mineral Resource estimates reported in  

Chapter 17. 



77 
 

 
13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
 

From Project inception, Project staff employed by TVX, Santa Fe, Newmont, Kinross, and 

Jaguar (metallurgical sample preparation only) were responsible for the following: 

 

• Sample collection 

• Core splitting 

• Preparation of samples for submission to the analytical laboratories 

• Sample storage 

• Sample security 

 

In 1996, Santa Fe established a sample preparation facility at the project site to handle the core, 

RC, and surface geochemical samples collected during exploration programs managed by Santa 

Fe and later Newmont. Company personnel were responsible for sample preparation from 1996–

2000. 

 

13.1 ANALYTICAL LABORATORIES 

 

There is no record of the analytical laboratories prior to 1996. 

 

Core, RC, and surface geochemical samples (from the Santa Fe and Newmont programs (1996–

2000) were dispatched to Nomos Análises Minerais Ltda. ("Nomos") in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. 

Samples generated by Kinross exploration and drill delineation programs between 2003 and 

2008 were prepared and analysed by Lakefield–Geosol Laboratories (Lakefield), also in Belo 

Horizonte. 

 

Check sampling has been undertaken by ALS Chemex, Bondar Clegg and Cone Laboratories.  

 

Lakefield is independent of Kinross, and was ISO-certified at the time of analysis. Lakefield was 

acquired by the SGS Laboratory Group during 2004. 

 



78 
 

Bondar Clegg was an independent, ISO-certified laboratory group that was acquired by ALS 

Chemex in 2001. The ALS Chemex laboratories maintain independence and ISO certification. 

Cone Laboratories certification at the time of analysis is unknown. 

 

13.2 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 

 

Extensive documentation for the sample preparation by Santa Fe and Newmont at the on-site 

laboratory preparation facility was reviewed for the purposes of the in-house 2005 feasibility 

study.  Methods utilized conform to standard industry practices. 

 

Drill samples were crushed to minus10 mesh; then a 2-kg split was pulverized to a nominal 90% 

passing 150 mesh using a ring pulverizer. An assay split of 250 g was collected from the pulp 

and shipped to Nomos for a 50-g fire assay digestion, and atomic absorption (AA) determination 

for gold. 

 

Results greater than 10.0 g/t Au were re-assayed with a gravity finish. 

 

Results were received by facsimile from the Nomos laboratory and analytical certificates made 

available as hard copies. Sample rejects are stored at the Project site. 

 

Kinross' diamond core samples were prepared and assayed at Lakefield's Belo Horizonte 

laboratory. The sample preparation and assay procedures were similar to those by Santa Fe and 

Newmont. . 

 

Samples were crushed and pulverized in their entirety to 95% passing 150 mesh using a ring 

pulverizer. A 250-g sample pulp was then collected for analysis. Lakefield employed the same 

50-g fire assay digestion and subsequent AA determination method to complete each analysis. 

 

Results were received via email and hard copy certificate. Data were entered into the Project 

database from the emailed file. Reject pulps were stored at Lakefield's facility. 

 



79 
 

13.3 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAMS 

 

13.3.1 2004 Kinross Review 

 

To support feasibility-level studies, in 2004 Kinross compiled all existing quality assurance and 

quality control (QA/QC) data to that point in time. 

 

Records for the QA/QC procedures for Santa Fe were noted to be not well organized. Newmont 

only began following the procedures outlined towards the end of their drilling campaigns. 

 

Blank control samples were typically inserted into the sample stream. Review of the blank 

results performed by AMEC in 2005 indicated that the sample preparation process was free of 

contamination. 

 

Santa Fe and Newmont completed a number of analytical checks and studies: 

 

• Assay of ¼ -split core versus original ½-split core 

• Metallic screen assays after original 50-g fire-AA assays 

• Duplicate pulps from single sample with multiple assays 

• Metallurgical drill sample composite assays compared against weighted average original 

assays 

• Second laboratory check assays (ALS Chemex, Bondar Clegg and Cone) 

• Sieve examination of pulp size distribution. 

 

Results from the check programs indicated no appreciable coarse gold component to the deposits 

(AMEC 2005, unplublished). Reproducibility of individual sample assays was generally good 

with reasonable correlation. 

 

13.3.2 Kinross QA/QC Programs 

 

With each batch of 70 to 180 drill core samples per drill hole, a set of two (2) blank rock samples 

and four (4) to six (6) pulp gold standards were introduced into the sample stream. 



80 
 

 

Gold standards used were purchased from Rocklabs, New Zealand, and have grade ranges that 

are appropriate to the ranges noted within the deposits. 

 

In addition to Kinross' standards and blanks, Lakefield performed a check of the pulverization 

quality by screening one (1) in every twenty (20) samples and inserting their own laboratory 

blanks, standards, and duplicates to monitor  laboratory quality. 

 

13.4 DATABASES 

 

Entry of information into databases utilized a variety of techniques and procedures to check the 

integrity of the data entered. The current Project database is in MS Access. 

 

Geological data from early drill programs were entered into spreadsheets in a single pass. Assays 

were received electronically or by disc from the laboratories and imported directly into the 

database. 

 

Drill hole collar and down-hole survey data were manually entered into the database. 

 

Data were verified prior to Geological Modeling and Mineral Resource estimation by means of 

in-built program triggers within software. Checks are performed on surveys, collar co-ordinates, 

lithology data, and assay data. 

 

Documentation for the pre-Kinross programs is generally available, but not comprehensive. 

Typically, geological logs, and analytical data are preserved for all drill holes; however collar 

data is partially missing. 

 

Paper records were kept for all Kinross assay and QA/QC data, geological logging and density 

information, downhole and collar coordinate surveys. All paper records were filed by drill hole, 

for quick spotting and retrieval of any information desired. Assays, downhole surveys, and collar 

surveys were stored in the same file as the geological logging information. In addition, sample 

preparation and laboratory assay protocols from the laboratories were monitored and kept on file. 



81 
 

 

13.5 SAMPLE SECURITY 

 

Documentation outlining the security of the on-site facilities for the period from 1995 through to 

1998 could not be found in the file archives. This was not uncommon during that period  

(unrestricted access by all personnel to the logging and sampling facilities). 

 

During the 2003–2004 and 2007–2008 Kinross drill programs, cores were kept at the drill rig 

until the end of each shift. They were then delivered to the logging facility and placed on 

benches for photography and logging. The core was typically sawed and sampled within a three-

day period. During the various stages of this process, the access to the core was available to 

assigned drill crew, supervisors, and Project staff. 

 

During shipment of samples to Belo Horizonte the sample sacks were typically accessible to a 

limited number of transportation personnel. Chain of custody procedures consisted of filling out 

sample submittal forms that were sent to the laboratory with sample shipments, to make assured 

that all samples were received by the laboratory. 

 

13.6 SAMPLE STORAGE 

 

Assay pulps and crushed reject material are stored off-site. Core is stored in wooden core boxes 

on steel racks in the buildings adjacent to the core logging and cutting facilities. The core boxes 

are racked in numerical sequence by drill hole number and depth. 

 

  



82 
 

14 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

A number of data verification programs and audits have been performed over the Project history 

by Newmont, Kinross and independent consultants. 

 

14.1 VERIFICATION PERFORMED AS PART OF 2003 ACQUISITION (KINROSS) 
 

After Kinross acquired the Project, data validation of all data and compilation of all QA/QC data 

was completed. Data validation completed by Kinross included the review of all hardcopy collar 

location records and the assays from a selection of 38 pre-Kinross holes, and 16 from 2003 and 

2004 Kinross holes (5,800 assays total) were compared against hardcopy assay certificates. Only 

eight (8) minor errors were found and were rectified. 

 

14.2 VERIFICATION PERFORMED AS PART OF 2005 UNPUBLISHED FEASIBILITY STUDY 
(KINROSS/AMEC) 
 

14.2.1 Collar Surveys 
 

Kinross completed a program of drill collar inspections and re-surveys to confirm the 1995 to 

1997 hole locations. Approximately 75% of collar locations inspected had cement markers 

locating the hole collar. The remainder had been destroyed, either by later earthworks or by local 

residents. 

 

Kinross re-surveyed the collars of 60 holes at Cipoeiro and 50 holes at Chega Tudo in 2003. The 

check surveys identified a 2-m to 4-m offset in the Cipoeiro drill collar locations. The source of 

the error could not be isolated with any certainty. Kinross did not consider the error to be 

material. 

 

At Chega Tudo the drill hole collars from the TVX and Newmont programs were found, by 

Kinross, to be within 0.5 m of the documented location in all cases. 

 

For this Feasibility, Jaguar has contracted licensed surveyors to check coordinates of topographic 

landmarks and monuments, and to install new landmarks for the Detailed Engineering phase.  



83 
 

For Detailed Engineering another survey with the appropriate level of accuracy is planned. 

 

14.2.2 Downhole Surveys 
 

Downhole surveys from 30 pre-Kinross holes were examined by comparing the values recorded 

in the database to the information recorded on the drill logs. The database entries matched the 

original data. Kinross' downhole survey data was entered manually into the database and later 

verified versus the original data source. 

 

14.2.3 Lithologies 
 

Lithological and alteration codes assigned to each drill sample in the database were subject to 

random inspection during the process of cross sectional interpretation and deposit modeling. The 

reviews found no discrepancies with the database versus the geologic logs. However, there were 

instances of disagreement with the interpreted rock type and/or alteration value.  

 

14.2.4 Twin Drill Holes 
 

A total of nine (9) drill holes were twinned on the Project. In general, twin-hole results 

confirmed the location and grade of gold mineralization in the original drill holes. 

 

Santa Fe and Newmont completed seven (7) twins that were largely focused on confirming RC 

drill results. The Santa Fe and Newmont results suggest that the RC-related gold grade results are 

10% higher than the core assays. 

 

Kinross twinned three (3) core holes (one at Cipoeiro, two at Chega Tudo) to confirm earlier drill 

results. Results from two (2)_of the holes (one each at Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo) confirmed the 

location and grade  of the original assays, whereas the second Chega Tudo core hole returned 

assay values that were appreciably different from the initial assays. PAH considered that the 

difference in the twinned holes was not a conclusive argument that there is a bias, as similar 

patterns were observed in the core twin holes.  

 



84 
 

14.2.5 Assays 
 

Approximately 2,000 assay entries from the pre-Kinross database were randomly compared to 

the original laboratory assay certificates. Only one error was found and corrected. 

 

The assay database from the 2003 to 2004 drilling was examined for six (6) randomly selected 

holes and compared against the assay certificates. No discrepancies were found. 

 

Kinross considered the analytical database in 2005 to be sufficiently free of errors to support 

resource estimation for feasibility study purposes. 

 

14.3 VERIFICATION PERFORMED AS PART OF 2009 TECHNICAL REPORT (PINCOCK, ALLEN 
AND HOLT) 
 

14.3.1 QA/QC 
 

Review of the Kinross drill program QA/QC data was performed as part of preparation of the 

2009 technical report prepared by Pincock, Allen and Holt (PAH; Clark and Stone, 2009). 

 

A review of the results of the QA/QC program indicated that of the 800 standards and blanks 

submitted, 36 returned values outside the acceptable limits. All batches that contained poor 

standard reconciliations were re-assayed from pulps and compared well with the original assays. 

Overall analysis of the Lakefield laboratory suggested to PAH that a slight bias low can be 

found. In the opinion of PAH, this interpretation was supported by the consistent low values of 

the standards compared to the recommended values, and to the re-assay values reported by ALS 

Chemex. 

 

PAH suggested the bias was consistent between grades and could represent about 5%. PAH 

reported the bias result to be within acceptable limits of assaying. 

 

  



85 
 

14.3.2 Analytical Precision 
 

PAH noted that some issues on precision were found in the data from varying analytical 

laboratories, particularly Lakefield.  These were not documented in the 2009 technical report. 

However, PAH concluded that: 

 

14.3.3 Twin Drill Holes 
 

A number of drill holes have been twinned to test the validity of the original assays and the 

representativeness of the core and RC drilling techniques. 

 

PAH noted the results of the twinned holes as variable. The RC versus core drill holes had 

similar widths; however, RC assays were consistently higher by 10% to 20%. The comparison of 

twinned core holes to core holes completed pre-Kinross and by Kinross revealed good 

corelation; however, some show similar variability to that shown in the RC versus core twin 

data. 

 

PAH indicated that further analysis was needed to determine any potential bias. The data 

currently available indicate any potential bias would result in only minimal impact to the global 

resource estimates.  

 

PAH considered that the difference in the twinned holes was not a conclusive argument that 

there is a bias, as similar patterns were observed in the core twin holes.  

 

14.3.4 Topography 
 

An issue with the topography used to estimate the Cipoeiro deposit was noticed by PAH. 

Communication with Kinross suggested that this resulted from an inaccurate geo-reference and 

the resultant transformation from the new grid system to the old. The drill hole collars are known 

points with accurate surveys, so to minimize errors, MCB and PAH agreed that modifying the 

existing topography to include the drill hole collars for the purposes of the 2009 technical report, 

would result in the most accurate representation of the topography in the old grid system and for 

the 2009 PAH Mineral Resource estimate. 



86 
 

 

A review of the modified topography by PAH indicated that this surface represents the 

topography appropriately. Although there were some problematic areas, PAH was of the opinion 

that these areas were not material to the Cipoeiro deposit and would not result in inclusion or 

exclusion of significant amount of material. This approach was maintained for the 2009 PAH 

Mineral Resource estimate. 

 

For this Feasibility, Jaguar has contracted licensed surveyors to check coordinates of topographic 

landmarks and monuments, and to install new landmarks for the Detailed Engineering phase.  

For Detailed Engineering another survey with the appropriate level of accuracy is planned.

16.1.1 Hazen, 1995 

 

Hazen, in 1995, determined the Bond ball mill Work Index (BWI) for a number of Cipoeiro composite 

samples: 

 

• Cipoeiro saprolite:  1.5 kWh/t 

• Remaining ore types (ACT, ROCK, OXBR): 10.1 kWh/t 

• Cipoeiro hard rock (TON only):  18.6 kWh/t 

 

16.1.2 Santa Fe, 1996–1997 

 

The 1996–1997 testwork commissioned by Santa Fe was conducted by the following test laboratories: 

Metais Especiais, McClellan, and Hazen.  Work was comprised of: 

 

• Gravity tails tests using carbon-in-leach (CIL) recovery at various grind sizes (100 mesh, 
150 mesh, 200 mesh, 325 mesh). 

• Bond Ball Work Index ("BWI") 

• Flotation tests 

• Column leach tests (no report available) 

• High-pressure grind roll (HPGR) testwork (no report available)  

• Agglomeration tests (no report available)  

 

Results of gravity tails tests indicated that gold recovery from tonalite samples were sensitive to grind 

size, whereas recoveries from oxide, saprolite, and transition mineralization were relatively insensitive to 

grind size and retention time.   

 

BWI were determined as follows:  

 

• Bond ball mill work index, Cipoeiro:  18.6 kWh/t 

• Bond rod mill work index, Cipoeiro:  19.9 kWh/t 

• Abrasion index:  0.297 g 

 

Flotation tests on tonalite and oxide material indicated similar recoveries to those achieved using 

Gravity/CIL.  Flotation tests on saprolite material resulted in poor recoveries.  

 



 

92 
 

Column leach data are not available; however, the heap leach option was not considered further due to 

the regionally high rainfall.  

 

HPGR data are no longer available for review.  

 

Agglomeration test results are not available for review. 

 

16.1.3 Kinross, 2004 

 

16.1.3.1 Knelson Research & Technology Centre 

 

In 2004, Knelson evaluated the amenability of the hard rock and saprolite ores from Cipoeiro and Chega 

Tudo Targets to gravity recovery (Report KRTC 2004).  The purpose of the testing was to determine if a 

gravity plant could improve gold recovery.  Results for Gravity-Recoverable Gold (GRG) averaged 28%, 

ranging from 13.5% to 40.2%.  Knelson did not identify which sample was hard rock and which sample 

was saprolite. The complete results are presented in Table 16.1.3.1.1. The poor performance for both 

Cipoeiro ores ruled out a gravity separation plant.

Composite 4 Chega Tudo 1.58 40.0 

 

16.1.3.2 SGS Lakefield Research Limited 

 

Four composites (hard rock and saprolite) from Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro were submitted to SGS 

Lakefield for research and development of a process route.  

 

The chemical characterization of those four composites is presented in Table 16.1.3.2.1.

Sieve Analysis Tests indicated that no appreciable difference in gold grade between the pulp solids (-150 

mesh) and the metal-bearing fractions (+150 mesh). Furthermore, no significant coarse gold component 

was detected in these samples.   

 

Saprolite at both the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits is a completely oxidized and intensely weathered 

material, consisting almost entirely of kaolin clays.  Sieve Analysis Tests showed that the Chega Tudo 

saprolite sample contained approximately 81% passing 75 μm, while the Cipoeiro saprolite sample 

contained approximately 68% passing 75 μm.  Both saprolite material types will require very little 

grinding energy. Hazen, in 1995, determined the representative Bond Ball Work Index for the Cipoeiro 

saprolite to be 1.5 kWh/t. 

 

The Cipoeiro bedrock is composed entirely of unweathered hydrothermalite (tonalite), lying beneath the 

saprolite.  The Cipoeiro bedrock material is characterized as hard and abrasive. 

 

The Chega Tudo bedrock is composed of unweathered dacite, lying beneath the saprolite.  The Chega 

Tudo bedrock material is softer while at the same time more abrasive than the Cipoeiro bedrock material. 

BWI and Abrasiveness tests performed by SGS Lakefield and Dawson are summarized in Table 

16.1.3.2.2.

SGS Lakefield evaluated two flowsheet alternatives to whole ore cyanidation:  

 gravity separation plus gravity tailing cyanidation and;  

 gravity separation plus gravity tailing flotation and cyanidation of the flotation concentrate.   

 

Gravity separation was not approved due to very low gold recoveries (<10%) achieved in three of the 

four composites tested, thereby confirming the Knelson results. Cipoeiro hard rock gold recovery was 

only 6.3%. 

 

Flotation performed poorly in the case of both saprolite composites, and it was not possible to produce a 

float tailing, with an acceptably low gold concentration, to be discarded.  In addition, the Chega Tudo 

saprolite sample had a very high mass pull (more than 25% mass).  Despite the fact that flotation gold 

recovery was much better in the case of the bedrock composites, Kinross decided to not proceed with this 

process route. Complete results of the gravity plus flotation tests are presented in Table 16.1.3.2.3. 

Reagents used in flotation tests were potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) as collector, A208 as promoter, and 

MIBC as frother. Flotation time was 25 min.

Cyanidation tests on whole ore samples indicated that gold recoveries in the low to high 90% range could 

be achieved quite readily and under fairly mild leaching conditions (90% to 98% from the saprolites and 

85% to 96% from the tonalite and dacite composites, see Figure 16.1). The indication was that 

cyanidation of the whole ore (or gravity tailing) was universally applicable to the various mineralization 

types. 

       

Figure 16.1 – Gurupi Cyanide Leach Kinetics 

 
 

Additional testwork was performed by SGS Lakefield on the whole ore in order to develop a conceptual 

cyanidation flowsheet. The testwork was comprised of grind-size tests, cyanide concentration tests, pulp 

density tests, oxygen addition tests, and assessment of carbon-in-leach (CIL) versus direct leaching 

followed by carbon adsorption (carbon-in-pulp or CIP).  Leach residence times were fixed at 6, 16 and 24 

hours.   

 

Some results of a conventional whole ore cyanidation at pH 10.5 – 11.0, 0.5 g/L NaCN and 24 hours 

residence are presented in Table 16.1.3.2.4. Pulp density in % solids (wt) ranged from 45% and 50%.

The saprolite composites were naturally very fine and the effect of grind size was not evaluated.  It was 

observed that reducing the grind size for the hard rock samples had a significant impact on gold recovery 

(Figure 16.2).   

 

No improvement in leach extraction was noted in the tests completed with carbon (CIL) versus straight 

cyanidation, indicating that the samples did not have preg-robbing characteristics. Gold recovery was not 

significantly affected by changes in cyanide concentration, pulp density, or oxygen addition. 

 

Results of CIP modeling on the Gurupi mineralized materials indicated there would be fairly minor 

differences in the CIP operating parameters for hard rock and saprolite samples to achieve the same 

overall gold extraction efficiency. Both conventional and pump-cell, carousel-type CIP contactors were 

modeled, and the results indicated use of either plant type would result in acceptable performance. 

Nevertheless, pump-cell carousel-type is recommended to protect carbon against degradation during 

transfer of the carbon from tank to tank (ascendant stream).

Reagent requirements for the Gurupi cyanide leach circuit were determined from the 2004 SGS Lakefield 

testwork program. A summary of the unit consumption rates for the saprolite and hard rock materials is 

presented in Table 16.1.3.2.5.

Total) to levels below the Brazilian Codes target value of 1 mg/L. The consumption of SO2 was in the 

range 4.5 to 5.5 g per g of destroyed cyanide, which is at the high end of the range (3 g/g to 5 g/g), 

considered to be normal for the gold industry. Further optimization will probably reduce the 

aforementioned SO2 consumption, by backing off on the reagent addition rates. It must be noted that this 

testwork was of a preliminary nature and that minimal circuit optimization was possible within the scope 

and timeframe. 

 

16.1.3.3 Other Studies 

 

Flocculant tests were conducted and a medium charge density, high molecular weight anionic flocculant, 

was selected as the most suitable for all of the Gurupi composites. Thickening testwork was conducted on 

slurry samples at both natural and elevated pH (10.5 to 11.0) in order to evaluate thickening under 

conditions of cyanidation feed and discharge, respectively. 

 

Overall, the saprolite composites required higher doses of flocculant than the hard rock composites. The 

underflow solids densities achieved for the saprolite samples ranged from 40.6% to 46.5%, whereas 

higher underflow solids densities, between 65.5% and 70.3%, were achieved with the hard rock 

composites. 

 

Rheology testing was conducted using a slurry at elevated pH (10.5 to 11.0), representing the conditions 

that will exist in the cyanidation/CIP part of the process. Flocculated with 35 g/t Percol 156, the critical 

solids density (CSD) of the saprolite composites was in the range of 45% to 47%, which was consistent 

with the thickening tests described previously. The CSD achieved with the hard rock composites, 

flocculated at 15 g/t P156, was 60% to 62%. This was lower than the achievable solids densities exhibited 

during liquid solid separation tests, indicating that the thickeners should be operated at lower solids 

density than the maximum achievable, in order to ensure good pumpability of the underflow, and good 

mass transfer kinetics in cyanidation and CIP. 

 

The threshold viscosity for optimum kinetics of carbon adsorption (2 Pa*s) was achieved at a slurry 

density of approximately 35% solids for the saprolite composites and approximately 59% solids for the 

hard rock composites. 

 

Dawson, under the supervision of consultants Starkey and Associates, performed testwork to determine 

appropriate semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill design, so as to always meet the nominal production 

requirements of 651 t/h at 80% passing 75 μm.   



 

99 
 

 

Dawson used a two-stage SAGDesign test, which was specifically developed to design grinding circuits 

with SAG mills.  The first stage simulates coarse grinding down to 1.7 mm.  The second stage comprises 

a standard Bond test using the product from the first stage with the +6 mesh material being crushed.  The 

results from the tests represent the total energy required when a two-stage grinding circuit is planned to 

be used.  

 

Motor and grinding mill sizes were recommended based on the tests.   

 

16.1.4 Projected Gold Recoveries 

 

The 1997 Hazen work and the 2004 SGS Lakefield metallurgical test program have both shown that the 

Gurupi mineralized material is amenable to simple cyanide leaching and CIP gold recovery. Gold 

recovery varies by material type, leach time and grind size. Table 16.1.4.1 presents the projected gold 

recovery rates for a nominal 24-hour leach and a grind size of 80% passing 75 μm.  The projected gold 

recovery is based on the direct cyanidation results from the SGS Lakefield optimization testwork, taking 

into account the impact of the feed grade, finer grinding, and losses associated with gold recovery in CIP.     

 

Table 16.1.4.1 - Projected Gurupi Gold Recovery 

Material Type Projected Feed Grade (g/t) Gold Recovery 

Cipoeiro Saprolite 1.2 94.6% 
Cipoeiro Tonalite 1.2 89.1% 
Chega Tudo Saprolite 1.0 97.0% 
Chega Tudo Dacite 1.0 92.5% 

 

16.1.5 Mineralogical Studies 

 

Estudio Calcagráphico completed an ore mineralogy study on four Gurupi samples in August 2004.  The 

mineralogy study concluded that the gold consists of both fine grained free particles and fine grained 

particles in association with pyrite and chalcopyrite.

16.2.1 HPGR Evaluation by KHD Humboldt – Report No. B.09.1075.7.001 dated April 08, 2010 

 

About 1,500 kg of Cipoeiro Tonalite drill core samples were sent to KHD Humboldt in Cologne, 

Germany for a test program to evaluate the application of HPGR in the comminution circuit of Gurupi 

Project. 

 

The testwork consisted of: 

 

 A series of single pass (open circuit) tests to evaluate the effect of roll speed, press force, and feed 

size in an open circuit situation; 

 A series of closed circuit HPGR grinding tests in combination with a 3.0 mm wet screening of the

16.2.1.1 Open Circuit Tests 
 

Table 16.2.1.1.1 presents the open circuit results.  Open circuit pilot HPGR grinding tests for a coarse 

feed of 100% <40 mm indicated a linear dependency of the specific power consumption with the applied 

pressure, from 1.66 kWh/t to 2.43 kWh/t over an increase in specific pressure from 2.8 N/mm2 to 4.9 

N/mm2.  For a finer feed of 100% <25 mm a parallel trend was seen, at a slightly lower level of between 

1.54 kWh/t to 1.91 kWh/t.

Increasing the specific pressure resulted in a lower specific throughput from 260 ts/hm3 to 247 ts/hm3 for 

pressure range tested. For the finer feed a similar decrease in specific throughput was observed, from 259 

ts/hm3 to 249 ts/hm3. 

 

The specific energy consumption did not significantly change with roll speed, but a decrease was seen in 

the specific throughput. For the 40 mm feed, an increase in roll speed from 9 RPM to 21 RPM resulted in 

a decrease in specific throughput from 263 ts/hm3 to 246 ts/hm3. 

 

The open circuit pilot HPGR grinding tests of the Gurupi ore indicated a relatively small dependency on 

HPGR size reduction parameters to applying a finer feed. From a feed of 100% <40 mm a center product 

was generated with a P80 size about 7.4 mm, and with a mass proportion of 56% smaller than 2.8 mm. 

From a feed of 100% <25 mm the center product P80 size was about 5.8 mm, with a 62% minus 2.8 mm 

fraction. 

 

Figures 16.3 and 16.4 show the net specific energy and specific throughput as a function of specific 

pressure and roll speed.

16.2.1.2 Closed Circuit Tests 
 

Four (4) closed circuit tests were carried out according Figure 16.5.

Table 16.2.1.2.1 presents the closed circuit results. 

 

  



 

103 
 

Table 16.2.1.2.1 – Closed Circuit HPGR Test Results 

 
 

Using the finer feed of 100% <25 mm, a series of closed circuit grinding tests were carried out in 

combination with wet screening on a 3.0-mm cut size screen. For a specific pressure of 2.5 N/mm² or 4.0 

N/mm², the specific throughput was 245 ts/hm³ and 242 ts/hm³, respectively, at a net specific energy 

consumption of 1.19 kWh/t and 1.83 kWh/t.  A lower pressure thus resulted in a significant reduction 

(less 35%) in energy absorbed.  

 

The mass percentage <2.8 mm in the center discharge approached about 60% for the 4.0 N/mm² 

conditions, and coarsened to 52% <2.8 mm for the lower pressure. The HPGR product thus became 

coarser at a lower pressure. This fact was reflected in the changing 3-mm screen mass split, where the 

overflow mass proportion increased from 45% to 53%. As a consequence, the recycle mass (within the 

limitation of the pilot test conditions) increased from an average 81% to 111%.  

 

As a crude balance, for processing equal units of material, a hypothetical HPGR unit in closed circuit 

with 3-mm screening would have to run about 16% faster, but consume 24% less energy, for the same < 

3-mm product. A more complete evaluation of these consequences should be engaged during the scale-up 

calculations and final HPGR sizing.  

 

The 3-mm-wet screen undersize product was 80% <1.9 mm and 50% < 0.8 mm. Figure 16.6 shows the 

size distribution and curves of feed, oversize, and undersize (product of HPGR).

16.2.1.3 Flake Strength 

  

It was observed that only a moderate proportion, ca 5%-15% (by volume), of relatively weak and brittle 

flakes were generated, at approximately 20 mm-25 mm in thickness.  

 

Standard flake strength measurements indicated an average flake strength of near 85%, and drop tests 

indicated the efficiency of dry desagglomeration (on a particle cut size of 3 mm) was about 93% of 

average.  

 

However, since wet screening of the HPGR discharge is considered, desagglomeration will not be an 

issue, as the dispersion of the material upon submersing in water is almost instantaneous. In wet 

screening only a minimal carry-over of residual flake fragments would be expected. Therefore a 



 

105 
 

desagglomeration stage will not be a necessity; solely a pre-soaking of the HPGR discharge ahead of 

screening will be sufficient.  

 

16.2.1.4 Roll Surface Wear Rate 

  

To indicate the expected wear life of the HPGR roll surface, several factors have to be taken into account, 

such as Quartz content, wear rate from testing, flake formation, formation of an autogenous wear lining, 

and material slippage or extrusion.  

 

Gurupi samples were observed to develop a good wear layer during the short test runs, covering the full 

width of the rolls, and no significant slippage was observed.  

 

For the anticipated operating conditions, an abrasion wear index of 0.0122 g/min was measured, at an 

assayed quartz free content of 21.2%. Combined with observations on autogenous layer embedding, a 

preliminary expectation of service wear life for rolls equipped with a KHD STUD-PLUS wear surface 

would be approximately 13,000 operating hours.  

 

This value would serve as a first indication only. Guarantees will only be given after the final operating 

conditions are determined. 

 

16.2.1.5 Ball Mill Grindability Reduction  
 

Bond Ball Mill Work Index ("BWI") was measured for a product size of 125 μm, both before and after 

HPGR grinding. This indicated a reduction of the BWI. The Gurupi tonalite ore showed a modest 

reduction, by 5%, from 17.2 kWh/t to 16.4 kWh/t.  

 

Conclusions have been that in addition to the reduction in the Work Index, the large proportion of fine 

particle sizes in the roller press product, as compared against the product from conventional crushing, 

may assist in a reduction in the required number of grinding mill units to be installed. Part of the HPGR 

product may be able to bypass the grinding circuit.

16.2.2 SGS MINERALS SERVICES Flotation / Leaching Testwork – Support to the Definition of 

the New Process Route 

 

16.2.2.1 Testwork with 2004 Kinross Core Drilling Samples 

 

Using the 2004 Kinross drill cores, coarse ore samples from Cipoeiro (tonalite) and Chega Tudo (dacite) 

were taken for the studies by SGS Lakefield and by Gekkos' Laboratory at Australia. An oxide Cipoeiro 

(saprolite) sample was also sent to Gekko.  

 

As the flotation tests conducted by SGS were promising (excellent mass pull with reasonable gold 

recovery), Jaguar decided to investigate this route, but add the additional step of gravity concentration 

using a continuous discharge centrifugal concentrator.  However, the process flowsheet did not 

considered the use of gravity separation in the grinding plant.  The concept was: 

 

 Grinding at various P80 sizes: 75 µm (fine), 106 µm (medium), and 150 µm and 212 µm (coarse); 

 Exhausted kinetic flotation tests, collecting concentrates at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 min., using 

Potassium Amyl Xanthate (PAX) as collector, Cytec 208 dithiophosphate (DTP) as promoter and 

MIBC as frother; 

 Gravity concentration of the flotation tailings with L40 Falcon Concentrator (four passes), 

simulating the continuous discharge machine; 

 Leaching of the reground concentrate. 

 

The target was a concentrate with 15% mass pull maximum and 90% gold recovery minimum. Therefore, 

about 85% of the coarse ore (tonalite) mill feed would be cyanide-free rejects to be disposed in a non-

lined rejects dam or filtered to be disposed of in piles. 

 

As the saprolite ore will not be concentrated, the data of the SGS LR10871-001 – Report No. 1 dated 

February 3, 2005 will be used for this ore. The scrubbed and screened saprolite ore (cut size 400 µm) will 

be leached together with the reground concentrate. The coarse oversize of the trommel and primary 

screen will join the crushed tonalite ore. The oversize of the secondary screen will join the flotation 

concentrate to be reground. 

 

The chemical characterization of the Cipoeiro (tonalite) and Chega Tudo (dacite) samples is presented in 

Table 16.2.2.1.1.

The screened metallics for gold test showed that the coarse material (+150 mesh) is higher grade than the 

head grade: 2.55 g/t versus 1.15 g/t for Cipoeiro and 4.55 g/t versus 1.32 g/t for Chega Tudo. However, 

the majority of the gold by mass is present in the fine fraction (-150 mesh) for both Cipoeiro and Chega 

Tudo. 

 

However, these flotation results were most definitely not similar to the 2005 SGS Report, mainly the 

mass pull. The mass pull of all these tests varied from 27% to 67%, for flotation only. These results are 

much above of the 15% maximum targeted. The results are presented in Table 16.2.2.1.2 and Figure 16.7. 

At that point, Jaguar elected to not continue the study with these old core drilling samples.

Old Core Drilling Samples 

 

 
 

The use of activators was tested with CuSO4 and Na2S without success. The mass pull was reduced to 

11% and 16%, but gold recovery was negatively affected. 

 

All techniques used by Gekko Laboratory resulted in poor gold recovery and high mass pull. These 

results are not presented in this report.  

 

16.2.2.2 Testwork with 2010 Jaguar Core Drilling Samples 

 

In 2010, Jaguar decided to execute two (2) twin core drill holes at Cipoeiro, as well as another two twin 

core drill holes at Chega Tudo. The purpose of these new drill holes was to produce new tonalite and 

dacite ore samples. These samples were used in SGS testing to develop the process route using intensive 

concentration: flotation followed by gravity separation of the flotation tailings, using a continuous 

discharge centrifugal concentrator prior to cyanidation of the reground concentrate.

The Cipoeiro sample was crushed to minus 6.0 mm and the resultant sample weighed about 240 kg. 

Likewise a 50 kg sample was produced and delivered to SGS-Lakefield.  The Chega Tudo sample 

preparation followed the same procedure as the Cipoeiro sample. 

 

16.2.2.2.1 Characterization of the Samples 

 

The chemical characterization of the 2010 Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo samples is presented in Table 

16.2.2.2.1.1.  SGS named these samples as CIP-B and CT-B

The screened metallics for gold test showed that the coarse material (+150 mesh) has much higher grade 

than the head grade for the Cipoeiro sample - 3.20 g/t versus 1.04 g/t.  However, differently from the 

previous sample the coarse material grade was almost the same as the head grade for the Chega Tudo 

sample - 1.16 g/t versus 1.20 g/t.  Again, for Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo, the majority of the gold mass was 

in the fine fraction (-150 mesh).   Very recently, SGS advised Jaguar to disregard any results related to 

Chega Tudo because they are under review.  Jaguar has informed the author of this Feasibility that SGS-

revised results have not been received until the date of this Feasibility (January 31, 2011). 

 

16.2.2.2.2 Flotation and Gravity Separation 

 

The conditions applied in the SGS tests were generally as indicated in Table 16.2.2.2.2.1.

Table 16.2.2.2.2.1  Typical Flotation Conditions applied in this Program 

 
 

The concentration results by flotation and gravity separation for the Cipoeiro sample are presented in 

Table 16.2.2.2.2.2 and Figure 16.8. The gravity concentration step was reduced from four (4) to two (2) 

passes only. The back-calculated head assay gold grade ranged from 1.08 g/t to 1.23 g/t, with a tails assay 

gold grade ranging from 0.13 g/t to 0.18 g/t. The tests on the Cipoeiro sample resulted in flotation plus 

gravity gold recoveries of 89% to 91.8% and mass pulls ranging from 30% to 34%. These mass pulls are 

much higher than was foreseen. For the next tests, the flotation time was reduced to 25 min.

Figure 16.8 – Mass Pull versus Gold Recovery from Flotation and Gravity Concentration Tests – 
2010 Cipoeiro Sample 

 
 

To produce concentrates for cyanidation tests, two (2) grinding sizes were evaluated. These grinding 

sizes were 75 µm and 106 µm. For each grinding size four (4) flotation and gravity tests with 2 kg 

samples were performed. To control the mass pull, the flotation time of these tests was reduced from 35 

min. to 25 min. and the gravity concentration was maintained at two (2) passes only, but reducing the 

mass yield of this step to about 5%. Due to the flotation time reduction, the reagents addition was also 

reduced. All the concentrates of each grinding size (without scavenging) were included in the cyanidation 

testing, described in Section 16.2.2.2.3 below. The concentration results are presented in Table 

16.2.2.2.2.3.

Per each tonne of flotation feed (tonalite mill feed), the predicted flotation reagent consumptions are: 

 

 Collector: 30 g/t of potassium amyl xanthate 

 Promoter: 30 g/t of Cytec A-208 

 Frother: 30 g/t of MIBC 
 

Considering all concentrates (flotation and gravity) as rougher (no scavenging), the gold recovery was 

about 90% for both grinding sizes with a higher than expected mass pull.  The resultant mass pulls ranged 

from 18% and 22% versus the anticipated 15%. It should be noted that when the flotation step was not 

efficient (F10), the gravity concentration process using a continuous discharge machine (Falcon C or 

Knelson CVD) could recover the gold not recovered by flotation. After the aforementioned testing the 

grinding size of P80 = 106 µm, mass pull of 18%, and gold recovery of 90% were assumed for the 

Project. 

 

16.2.2.2.3 Cyanidation 

 

The concentrates were reground to P80 = 38 µm target; however, a finer reground (19 µm and 25 µm) 

product resulted. The cyanidation tests conditions and results are presented in Table 16.2.2.2.3.1. 

 

Table 16.2.2.2.3.1 – Concentration and Leaching Results with Cipoeiro Sample 

 
 

The reground concentrate was leached with 1 g/L NaCN solution for 48 hours at 50% solids (wt) at pH 

10.5 – 11 solely with lime. Timed samples were taken to determine leach kinetics. Kinetic data, as shown 

in Table 16.2.2.2.3.1, indicated that only 91%-92% of the gold contained in the float concentrate was 

extracted after 24 hours of leaching. Since the gold extraction was not effectively complete at this stage, a

24-hour leach cycle is neither technically feasible nor cost-effective. Hence, a 48-hour leach cycle was 

adopted as the cyanidation time, since the gold extraction was 95%.   

 

Therefore, the gold recovery by cyanidation (48-hours retention time) of 95% and the regrinding size of 

P80 = 25 µm were adopted for the Project.  

 

The adopted reagent consumptions for the Project are 600 g of sodium cyanide and 1,500 g of lime per 

each tonne of float concentrate fed into the leaching circuit. For saprolite ore leaching, the results in 

Table 11 of SGS LR10871-001 – Report No. 1 from February 3, 2005 were considered. The gold 

recovery assumed is 95% and the reagent consumptions are 350 g of sodium cyanide and 4,500 g of lime 

per each tonne of saprolite ore fed in the leaching circuit. Therefore, the reagent consumptions per tonne 

of total ore fed to the plant assumed for the Project are: 

 

 Cyanide = (600 g/t * 4,500,000 tpy * 0.18 + 350 g/t * 500,000 tpy) / 5,000,000 tpy = 132 g/t (661 

tpy) 

 Lime = (1,500 g/t * 4,500,000 tpy * 0.18 + 4,500 g/t * 500,000 tpy) / 5,000,000 tpy = 693 g/t 

(3,465 tpy) 

 

16.2.3 TESTWORK Desenvolvimento de Processo Ltda.  

 

A representative 25-kg sample of Cipoeiro Tonalite was taken from the 240-kg bulk sample (the same as 

the SGS-Lakefield sample) and delivered to TESTWORK (Nova Lima-Brazil) to perform settling and 

flotation test at P80 = 106 µm to produce concentrate and rejects. The concentrate was reground for 

settling and cyanidation tests at P80 = 25 µm. The rejects were cycloned for partition determination and 

settling tests performed on the overflow mass. The settling tests were for thickeners sizing (flotation feed, 

reground concentrate, and rejects overflow cycloning) and the cyanidation tests were for gold adsorption 

rate tests.

16.2.3.2 Gold Adsorption Rate and Equilibrium Testes - Report No. MCT-010-RL-002 dated 

January 12, 2011 
 

 The carbon adsorption rate and kinetic tests were performed by TESTWORK using a solution from 

cyanide leach tests performed on a flotation concentrate and saprolite ore blend, as described in the 

previous sections.  

 

PICA G209 8 by 16 mesh carbon, which had been pre-attritioned and presoaked in cyanide, was used in 

the test. The leach solution was placed into an agitated beaker and the carbon was added. Solution 

samples were removed from the test after 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours of reaction. The solution samples were 

submitted for Au analysis by AA. The carbon was submitted for Au analysis by standard fire assay 

procedures. 

 



 

119 
 

It should be noted that a rather small carbon to solution ratio (0.24 g/L) was used for the purposes of this 

test. Typical industrial figures range from 20 to 60 g/L.   

 

Results indicated that the carbon had absorbed about 3,339g of Au per SI tonne of loaded carbon (118 

oz/st), after 8 hours. This was about 43% of the gold available in the leach solution. About 26% of the 

gold had loaded onto the carbon after 2 hours. The feed solution assayed 1.84 mg/L, and the final solution 

assayed 1.05 mg Au/L. The amounts of Au adsorbed at the various sample times are shown graphically in 

the figure 16.10. 

 
Figure 16.10 – Adsorption Rate 

 
 

Au Adsorption Equilibrium tests were conducted on a solution filtered from the leached pulp containing 

flotation concentrate and saprolite ore was used for the equilibrium test. Measured amounts of the 

solution were placed into five separate bottles. Weighed amounts of carbon were then placed into the 

respective bottles to give solution to carbon ratios of 4226, 2113, 1014, 507, and 254. This correlates to 

gold to carbon ratios ranging from a high of 7,776 g/t (250 oz/st) to a low of 467 g/t (15 oz/st). The

bottles were then placed on a set of rolls and turned for 48 hours. The solutions were then filtered, and 

submitted for Au assay by AA analysis, and the carbon submitted for Au assay by standard fire analysis. 

  

Results indicated carbon loadings ranging from 467 g/t to 6,750 g/t (15 to 217 oz Au per ton of carbon),

16.2.4 Metso Minerals Industries, Inc. – Crushability Test – Report No. 1460 dated 12/08/2010  
 
A representative 25-kg sample from Cipoeiro Tonalite was taken from the 240-kg bulk sample (the same 

of SGS-Lakefield sample) and delivered to Metso (Sorocaba-Brazil) for crushability test. The crushability 

test performed by Metso is a series of tests to determine the behavior of the ore during the crushing and 

milling. The results are presented in Table 16.2.4.1.

The Ball Work Index of 16.53 kWh/st is close of KHD Work Index of 16.1 kWh/st, both @ 106 µm. 

Applying 5% reduction over Metso Work Index, the HPGR product would have Work Index = 15.70

Figure 16.12 – Schematic Project Process Flowsheet 

 
 

The main steps of the flowsheet consist of: 

 

 Two-stage  crushing to produce a  100% <38 mm product; 

 HPGR primary grinding to produce a 100% <3.0 mm (P80 = 1.9 mm) product; 

 Vertimills® secondary grinding to produce a P80 = 106 µm; 

 Flotation and gravity separation (centrifugal continuous discharge);

 Leaching / CIP of the reground concentrate and whole saprolite ore. 

 

16.2.6 Estimated Overall Metallurgical Recovery 
 

Using TechnoMine's testwork-based recovery estimates, the Overall Gold Recovery adopted for the 

Process Route is: 

 

Recovery = {[(0.90 * 4.5 Mtpy + 1.00 * 0.5 Mtpy) / 5.0 Mtpy] * 0.95 * 0.99} * 100 = 85.6%;

17 MINERAL RESOURCES AND RESERVES 
 

17.1 MINERAL RESOURCES  

 

Mineral resources estimates were firstly prepared by MCB Serviços e Mineração Ltda. ("MCB") 

Principal and Chief Resource Geologist, Rogério Moreno, under the supervision of Jaguar's Chief 

Geologist, Jaime Duchini for the AMEC Prefeasibility.  The MCB-adopted methodology and criteria for 

said mineral resources estimates are presented in Appendix 01 – MCB Mineral Resource Estimate Report 

(Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo).  

 

The aforementioned MCB Report served as the main basis for the Project's Indicated and Inferred 

Mineral Resources Estimates stated in this Feasibility.  TechnoMine and the author of this Feasibility, 

however, decided to not use pit shell constraints for the resources estimation methodology, as proposed 

by MCB in its Resource Estimation Report.   The actual Mine Designs for the two (2) Open Pits reported 

in this Feasibility (Section 21.1 – Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo Open Pit Mines) demonstrate the technical 

and economic viability of the mining operations.  It is worth noting that MICROMINE ® Pit 

Optimization tool was used to design a set of pits with the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm, based on which, 

the Optimized Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo Pits were established, as farther reported in this Feasibility.   

 

Mining Viability, along with a testwork-supported Feasible Process Route and a thorough overall costing, 

inclusive of the required infrastructure, in conjunction with an Economic Analysis, support the technical 

and economic feasibility of the Gurupi Gold Project Undertaking.  

 

The cutoff grades that allow the economic exploitation and processing of the future Cipoeiro and Chega 

Tudo Open Pit Mines are further demonstrated in Sections 21.1 – Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo Open Pit 

Mines and 21.2 Ore Processing and Metallurgy of this Feasibility.   

 

Tables 17.1.1 through 17.1.3 show the Mineral Resources Estimates for the Gurupi Gold Project.

17.2 MINERAL RESERVES ESTIMATES 
 
 
Mineral reserves estimates were prepared by Minere's Principal and Chief Mining Engineer, Reinaldo 

Nogueira Magalhães, under the supervision of the author of this Feasibility. Mr. Magalhães has over 

thirty (30) years of professional experience and is an in-good-standing Licensed Professional Mining 

Engineer registered with the state of Minas Gerais Board of Professional Engineers ("CREA-MG" – 

License 21.678/D.) 
 

Probable mineral reserves were estimated based on indicated mineral resources only, using Lerch-

Grossman ("L-G") constraining pit shells.  Gold unit price adopted for the base case is US$ 950 / oz Au.  

The reserve base (probable mineral reserves only) was selected on the basis of incremental NPV values 

analysis, performed for a gold unit price varying from US$ 300 / oz Au to US$ 1,135 / oz Au.  This range 

includes the unit gold price adopted in this Feasibility (sales): US$ 1,066 / oz, as addressed in Section 

21.8 - Gold Price and Revenue Estimates (also see Appendix 02 - Cash Flow and Sensitivity Analysis - 

Base Case Scenario.) 

 

MICROMINE ® pit optimization tool was used to design a set of pits, which were constrained via the 

utilized L-G algorithm. The Pit Optimization main results are shown in Table 17.2.1.

Based on the selected haulage equipment, the width of the mines haul roads was set at 22 m, while the 

slope of the access ramps into the pits was limited to 10%.  The final pits designs were created based on 

the latter criteria and on the optimized pit parameters.  

 

The estimated Probable Mineral Reserves for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits are summarized on 

Table 17.2.2.

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 

18.1 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

 

18.1.1 Power   

  

Electrical power will be supplied through direct link to the Brazilian national grid at 230 kV voltage 

class.  The point of connection will be the new Encruzo Substation as shown in Figure 18.1.  

 

The Gurupi Project region is well known for its poor quality distribution power grid.  Industrial projects 

cannot be supported since the transmission system is limited in its capacity.  However, an ongoing 

development will afford the local transmission system the capability to support new projects.   

 

        Figure 18.1– Regional Power System showing the Planned and Existing Power Lines 

                   
 

The existing power line connects the northwestern region of Maranhão to CEMAR's (a private power 

distribution company with operations in the state of Maranhão) Santa Inês Substation.  This existing 

Substation has 30-MVA capacity at 69 kV and is located approximately 200 km from the Encruzo 

Substation.  Jaguar expects to connect the Project to the Encruzo Substation.

129 
 

The Santa Inês Substation is connected to Miranda do Norte Substation that is part of the Eletronorte grid 

(a Generation and Transmission Company controlled by The Brazilian Government) in the country's 

northeastern region.  This Eletronorte subsystem does not support industrial projects, especially mid-

sized mining projects like Gurupi.  

 

The solution will be provided by a new Eletronorte 230-kV transmission line that will connect the 

Miranda do Norte Substation directly to the Encruzo Substation, which will have its capacity expanded to 

100 MVA at 69 kV level and to 300 MVA at 230 kV level.  The new and existing power lines are shown 

in Figure 18.1. 

 

The construction of the Eletronorte new line and the expansion of the Encruzo Substation started in 

August 2010, supported by a Power Supply Contract executed between the Brazilian Energy Minister and 

Eleknor Serviços Ltda. ("Eleknor").  Eleknor is a public company listed in the Madrid Stock Exchange. 

Its Brazilian subsidiary specializes in construction and operation of generation and transmission power 

systems.  Eleknor owns and operates assets totaling R$ 1 billion in Brazil.  The company has committed 

to complete its project in Maranhão by September 2012.  

 

This Feasibility considered power supply to the Project through a 230-kV, 40-km Power Line designed to 

cope with an initial demand of about 20 MW and a maximum demand of 100 MW.  The construction and 

commissioning of said power line will demand 18 months to be concluded.  

 

Simultaneously to the construction of this line, the construction of a new substation with 35 MVA / 32.2 

MW capacity at 230 kV in the Project Site will take place, in order to serve the Gurupi industrial complex 

with an initial contracted demand of 30 MW, aiming at coping with a to-be-contracted demand of 30 

MW: The initial Project Power System Demand is comfortably limited to 32.2 MW (Contractual Power 

Factor = 92%). 

 

This substation will be powered by two (2) 35-MVA transformers working in parallel, in a hot standby 

mode, such that, if one transformer is down or disconnected, the other can handle the project's entire 

demand without interruption of the production process.  

 

The substation's capacity can be expanded in the future to cope with a 60 MW demand with the 

installation of a third 35-MVA transformer.  This substation powers the Metallurgical Plant's main 

electrical room as well as the electrical rooms for the other areas in the industrial complex as shown in 



 

130 
 

The Main SE and the Plant Single Line Diagrams presented in Appendix 04C – Project Single Line 

Diagrams. 

 

The industrial demand from the Gurupi Project has been estimated according to the Metallurgical Process 

Route design and Open Pit Mines design (a minor power demand: ca 170 kW).  For mining activities, 

three (3) lighting towers and most pieces of equipment are envisioned to be diesel-powered.  However, 

the Mine Drainage Systems and the Fixed Lighting Network are foreseen to be powered by a portable 

substation. 

 

The production scale of 5 million tonne of ROM (dry basis) per year (5 Mtpy) is the base line.  The 

design assumptions also consider a possible expansion to 10 Mtpy.  The Estimated Project Electrical 

Demand for the 5-Mtpy scale is presented in Table 18.1.1.1.

18.1.2 Access Roads  

 

The main town in the Gurupi Project region is Maracaçumé.  Its population is about 25,000 and its 

infrastructure entails one hospital, elementary and high schools and main suppliers.  There are two main 

options to access Maracaçumé and the Project site, as shown in Figure 18.2. 

 

Belém do Pará Route: Belém is the capital city of the Pará State.  It is a city with an important 

infrastructure: International Airport with daily flights to the main cities in Brazil and weekly flights to 

North America and Europe.  Belém and Maracaçumé are linked by a federal paved road of approximately 

450 km. 

 

São Luis do Maranhão Route: São Luis is the capital city of the Maranhão State.  All of the Project 

interfacing with state agencies such as environmental, mining and fiscal will be held in this city.  São 

Luis is a 450,000-inhabitant city that has a strong infrastructure including a national airport with daily 

flights to the main cities in Brazil.  The Itaqui Port is an important logistic hub that serves Vale and other 

mining companies that operate in the region.  

 

A 24-km dirt road links Maracaçumé to the Project Site nearest town, Centro Novo.  The road is being 

paved by the state government.  Paving completion is anticipated to occur before the start of the Project 

construction activities. 

 

An in-good-shape 22-km dirt road links Centro Novo to the Project site.  Jaguar will improve drainage 

systems and the five (5) existing small bridges in order to make the access to the site permanent year 

round, even in the rainy season.

18.1.3 Communication System 

 

The Project Communication System will be based on micro-wave proprietary link that will connect data 

and voice from the Gurupi Project Site to the Jaguar Headquarters in Belo Horizonte.  The public carrier 

will be Embratel, which already supports Jaguar operations in the Southeast of Brazil.  This architecture 

(See Figure 18.3) will support a data bandwidth of 8 MB and up to 60 voice channels.

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

It is TechnoMine's conclusion that the Gurupi Gold Project is low-risk and robust.  It represents an 

improved undertaking as compared with the Project as presented in a previous in-house developed, 

unpublished Feasibility Study (Kinross, 2005) and in a Prefeasibility Study developed by AMEC for 

Jaguar and filed on SEDAR on May 11, 2010. 

 

While completing this Feasibility, TechnoMine and the Company also completed studies on Project 

improvements from the AMEC Prefeasibility, which are included in this Feasibility and summarized 

below. 

 

• The option for a 230-kV power line from the Encruzo Substation to the Project Main 

Substation (ca 40 km), instead of the 69-kV option that was considered in the AMEC 

Prefeasibility.  The adopted 230-kV transmission option led to an estimated average energy 

cost of US$ 0.075 / kWh, over the Project LOM, which radically reduced the Project OPEX. 

 

• The inclusion of Secondary Crushing and a High Pressure Grinding Roll ("HPGR") replacing 

a SAG Mill, along with the inclusion of Vertical Mills replacing Ball Mills introduced an 

overall  reduction to comminution costs of approximately 25% over the previous adopted size 

reduction process routes.  

 

• The utilization of Optimized Flotation Circuit in the context of Intensive Concentration 

technology conveyed, in addition to a more reliable concentration recovery rate, a dramatic 

reduction of the environmental risks and associated liabilities.  The sound testwork-supported 

process route guarantees that about 74% of the Mill Feed (solids) will consist of cyanide-free 

material that will be disposed in a rejects dam (first eight years) and in a rejects disposal 

facility (last five years).  Only 26% of the Mill Feed will be cyanided and go through an 

activated carbon CIP-A-DR circuit.  The tailings will be detoxified by a TBD state-of-the-art 

process and conveyed to a 2.5-mm thick geomembrane lined tailings dam.  The Project has 

been studied at length from a technical standpoint and is supported by wide-ranging 

exploration, detailed and in-depth metallurgical testwork, and conceptual and basic 

engineering, in addition to special front-end engineering tests and studies.  The 

aforementioned testwork and for this enhanced process route Project has been performed by 

reputable entities in Brazil, Canada, Germany, and Australia. The New Process Route Plant 



 

137 
 

OPEX (US$ 6.70 / t) is significantly smaller (over the LOM) than the AMEC determined 

one: US$ 9.93 / t.  

 

• Most CAPEX and OPEX estimates are supported by vendor quotes, contracts, and receipts. 

Cost estimates are based on solidly supported process routes, mining methods, and plans, 

within the +/- 15% accuracy range. 

 

 Based on the aforementioned conclusions and on the strong economic results yielded from the cash flow 

model and sensitivity analysis, TechnoMine considers the Project to be feasible and attractive.  Related 

technical and economic risks are small. 

  



 

138 
 

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

 TechnoMine recommends Jaguar to move toward the Project's implementation and start-up. 

 

 The Project is feasible and robust at its current size (5.0 Mtpy) and ramp-up profile (See 

Appendix 02 – Cash Flow and Sensitivity Analysis Base Case Scenario).  However, it is 

recommended that exploration efforts continue not only at the Project properties, but also at 

other nearby areas.  An increased resource base will give rise, via further consolidated studies, 

to increased reserves, which, in turn, may significantly augment the Project life and improve 

the financial performance of an extended project. 

 

 The same or higher technical standards related to the front-end engineering activities (such as 

exploration, metallurgical testwork, and conceptual and basic engineering), along with the 

required special front-end engineering tests and studies should be maintained for an 

augmented project size.  

 

 The recommended additional exploration and remaining front-end engineering activities 

should start as soon as possible in order to support a technically sound transition to any 

expanded Project.

21 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR TECHNICAL 

REPORTS ON DEVELOPMENT ISSUES 
 

21.1  CIPOEIRO AND CHEGA TUDO OPEN PIT MINES 

 

21.1.1  Introduction 

 

The Project encompasses two (2) gold mineralized deposits: Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro, situated at a 10-

km distance from each other.  They will be mined by the Open Pit Method.  The Chega Tudo deposit will 

be mined using one (1) open pit and the Cipoeiro deposit will be mined using (2) two open pits (the 

Contact Zone to the west and the Blanket Zone to the east). 

 

The main pieces of equipment for the fleet used in the open pits will be 100 t off-road trucks, front end 

loaders and hydraulic excavators. The saprolite zone will be mechanically excavated and its bedrock will 

be drilled and blasted. The pit slope design parameters for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo pits were based 

on the Golder Associates Ltd ("Golder") geotechnical report RT-049-5134-1410-0010-00-B (GURUPI 

PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "REPORT ON PIT SLOPE DESIGN PARAMETERS"), dated 

February 2005. Report RT-049-5134-1410-0010-00-B refers to data from the report DT-049-5134-1410-

0011-00-B (GURUPI PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATIONS") 

prepared by Golder, dated February 2005, as shown in Appendix 08 – Geotechnical Studies Final 

Reports.  

 

Haul roads and in-pit ramps were designed with a 10% inclination and with a width of 22 m, based on 

approximately three and half times the width of a Caterpillar 777 haul truck (6.1 m). This will not only 

provide sufficient width for two (2) lanes of traffic, but will also allow sufficient room for a drainage 

ditch and a safety berm. 

 

21.1.2 Geological Characteristics of the Ore Bodies 

 

The Project area lies within a northwest–southeast trending shear zone developed along the boundary 

between a Lower Proterozoic metamorphic belt (Gurupi Greenstone Belt) and the southwestern margin of 

the Archaean São Luis Craton. Most of the gold deposits and outcroppings of the Gurupi greenstone belt, 

including Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro, are hosted in structures associated with the strike-slip, sinistral 

Tentugal shear zone.  



 

140 
 

The Project's deposits are considered to be typical of mesothermal vein-style, or orogenic-style gold 

deposits.  

 

Chega Tudo is hosted in a dacite metavolcanic unit. Intrusive gabbro, extrusive andesite, and arkosic 

sandstone rocks are in structural contact with the dacite. Rocks in the deposit area have been widely 

affected by hydrothermal alteration. Mineralization is found solely within zones of quartz–sericite–pyrite 

alteration and is closely related to the amount of pyrite introduction. Typically, mineralization forms in 

en-echelon pods elongated with shear foliation and persisting for tens to hundreds of meters of strike and 

a similar distance down dip. These northwest-trending, steeply southwest-dipping mineralized zones 

range from a few meters to as much as 30 m in width and can form multiple pods that can be as much as 

100 to 200 m wide.  

 

Two main lithology types are recognized at Cipoeiro, a tonalite and an arkosic fine-grained sandstone 

with thin quartz–pebble conglomerate layers. The primary mineralization host is a coarse equigranular 

intrusive of tonalitic composition. The hydrothermal system at Cipoeiro is chemically similar to that at 

Chega Tudo. Silica flooding and replacement of the tonalite is more intense and more widespread than 

seen in the metavolcanics at Chega Tudo. However, gold remains most closely associated with sulfide 

(pyrite) introduction and quartz–sericite alteration. Two zones of mineralization have been defined, the 

Contact Ore Zone on the west and the Blanket Ore Zone to the east. The zones are separated by the 

Central Fault Zone ("CFZ"). 

 

21.1.3 Mineral Resources 

 

MCB prepared three-dimensional grade shell models based on a 0.25 g/t Au cutoff grade for both the 

Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro deposits. MCB interpreted polygons for three (3) domains: Oxide, Transition, 

and Sulfide mineralization. Saprolite mineralization was interpreted as supergene enrichment. It was 

combined with the oxide for the purposes of domaining.  

 

Each sample was composited at 5 m intervals. The saprolite zones for the Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro 

datasets were compared to data from the primary sulfide mineralization, and a hard boundary was 

established for estimation purposes at the interpreted base of weathering. Grade caps were applied to raw 

assay data, based on oxide, transition or sulfide material.  

 

Semi-variograms were calculated for Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro by combining composite data from all 

domains, except saprolite.  



 

141 
 

 

Average density values used for the Cipoeiro deposit were 1.53 g/cm3 for the oxide, 2.30 g/cm3 for the 

transition and 2.72 g/cm3 for the sulfide domain. The saprolite material at Chega Tudo was assigned an 

average density of 1.59 g/cm3. The average value used for the oxide domain was 1.59 g/cm3; a value of 

2.19 g/cm3 was used for the transition domain and 2.69 g/cm3 for the sulfide domain.  

 

Estimation was confined to within the defined grade shells. MCB used ordinary kriging with two (2) 

incremental search radii passes. To be estimated in the first pass, a block required a minimum of eight 

(8), and a maximum of twelve (12) composites within the search ellipsoid. A maximum of four (4) 

composites could be used from any individual drill hole. The second run required only two (2) 

composites within the search ellipsoid to estimate a block. 

 

The Block Model was verified using visual inspection, statistical comparisons of raw data, composite 

data and block estimates. The results show a smoothing of kriged grades within the estimated blocks as 

compared with the raw data and composite values.  

 

No Measured Mineral Resources have been classified. An Indicated Mineral Resource classification has 

been given where mineralization displays geological and grade continuity, within the wire-framed grade 

shell, and has been estimated in the first kriging pass. All other blocks within the grade shells estimated 

during the second kriging pass were classified as Inferred Mineral Resources.  

 

The Project estimation of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources reported in this Feasibility did not 

use any pit shell constraints as proposed by MCB in its Resource Estimation Report, attached hereto as 

Appendix 01 – MCB Mineral Resource Estimate Report (Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo). The actual Open Pit 

Mine Designs reported in this Feasibility demonstrate the technical and economic viability of the mining 

operations (MICROMINE ® Pit Optimization tool was used to design a Set of Pits with the Lerchs-

Grossman algorithm), which, along with a testwork-supported Process Route and a thorough overall 

Costing inclusive of the required Infrastructure and an Economic Analysis support the technical and 

economic feasibility of the Gurupi Project Undertaking, as reported herein. The cutoff grades that allow 

the economic exploitation and processing of the future Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo Open Pit Mines are 

further demonstrated in this Section and in Section 21.2 - Ore Processing and Metallurgy.

21.1.4 Production Plan 
 

The Processing Plant is planned to start up in January 2013 with a 4,000,000 t processing feed.  In the 

second year the Plant will process 4,500,000 t and 5,000,000 t in following years.  The Project life is 

planned to be approximately 13 years. 

 

The Run of Mine ("ROM") to be processed will be produced at the Cipoeiro open pit during the initial 

eight (8) years and then will be produced at the Chega Tudo open pit (for the remainder of the life of 

mine ("LOM") , i.e., approximately 5 years). 

 

During the first two (2) years, approximately 4,961,000 t of low-grade sulfide ore with an average grade 

of ca 0.58 g/t will be mined and stockpiled.  This stockpiling affords a Mill Feed grade of 1.47 g/t and 

1.61 g/t in the first and second years of operations, respectively. Also during the first year, about 

3,127,900 t of oxidized ore will be mined and stockpiled.  It will feed the processing plant at a later time, 

at a maximum rate of 500,000 tpy (tonne per year).  The low grade stockpiled ore will be reclaimed and 

from the third to the thirteenth year be blended with the tonalite ore being mined, to compose the feed to 

the Processing Plant. A Mine Call Factor (MCF) of 97% was used to account for total contained ounces 

of gold lost during the transfer of ore from the mine to the mill.  MCF is essentially a loss of gold, and is 

therefore expressed as a reduction in grade, during the Load-Haul-Dump cycle.  During the Hauling 

Operations ore can be lost through spillage, accidents, aeolic action, and other similar actions, while less 

than 100% of the "on the mine ground" ROM is typically retrieved during the Loading Operations.

Studies Final Reports.  

 

21.1.6 Mining Method Selection 

  

The mining method to be used in the Gurupi Project will be open pit. 

 

Conventional off-road truck and excavator open pit mining method will be used at each of the pits 

(Contact Zone, Blanket Zone - collectively the Cipoeiro pit - and Chega Tudo). The saprolite zone will be 

dug by hydraulic excavator; and the bedrock will require drill-and-blasting. The pit slope design 

parameters for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo pits are based upon Golder geotechnical report RT-049-

5134-1410-0010-00-B (GURUPI PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "REPORT ON PIT SLOPE DESIGN 

PARAMETERS"), dated February 2005, as shown in Appendix 08 – Geotechnical Studies Final Reports.  

 

Haul roads and in-pit ramps were designed with a 10% gradient and with a width of 22 m, based on 

approximately three and half times the width of a Caterpillar 777 haul truck (approximately 6.1 m). This 

will provide sufficient width for two (2) lanes of traffic and also allows space for a drainage ditch and 

safety berm. 

 



 

149 
 

Jaguar designed the open pit slope angle based on Golder geotechnical report RT-049-5134-1410-0010-

00-B (GURUPI PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "REPORT ON PIT SLOPE DESIGN 

PARAMETERS") dated February 2005, as shown in Appendix 08 – Geotechnical Studies Final Reports.  

 

Pit slope designs varied from 35–48º in saprolitic and oxidized material, to 46º in transitional material, to 

46–53º in fresh rock. The final bench heights varied from 10 m in saprolite to 20 m in fresh rock. Haul 

roads were designed with a width of 22 m and a maximum ramp grade of 10%. Safety berm widths vary 

from 6 to 12 m and the minimum mining width was assumed to be 20 m. Dilution was input in the block 

model through a diluted block grade estimation of 18% dilution in Cipoeiro and 13% dilution in Chega 

Tudo. Therefore, adding more mine dilution would penalize block grades beyond reasonable estimates. 

The Mining Recovery for the Cipoeiro Open Pits are estimated at 91.6%. For the Chega Tudo Open Pit it 

is estimated at 90.4%. 

  

The water management system deals with the drainage of the spring and rain water in the open pit, waste 

dump areas, process plant area, tailings basin area and on the Chega Tudo to Cipoeiro haul road.  

 

21.1.7 Probable Mineral Reserve Estimates 

 

Probable Mineral Reserves were estimated based on Indicated Mineral Resources only, using Lerch-

Grossman ("L-G") constraining pit shells. The gold unit price adopted for the base case is US$ 950 / oz 

Au. The reserve base (probable mineral reserves only) was selected on the basis of incremental NPV 

analysis, performed for a gold unit price varying from US$ 300 / oz Au to US$ 1,135 / oz Au. This range 

includes the unit gold price adopted in this Feasibility (sales): US$ 1,066 / oz Au, as addressed in Section 

21.8 Gold Price and Revenue Estimates (See Appendix 02 - Cash Flow and Sensitivity Analysis - Base 

Case Scenario.) 

 

MICROMINE ® Pit optimization tool was used to design the Set of Pits constrained via the utilized L-G 

algorithm.  The Pit Optimization main results are shown in Table 21.1.7.1.

Based on the haulage equipment selection, the mine haul roads width was set at 22 m, while the slope of 

the access ramps into the pits was limited to a 10% grade. Based on these criteria and on the optimized pit 

results, the final pit designs were created.  

 

 The estimated Probable Mineral Reserves for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits are summarized on

Based on the production plan and on the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo reserves, the life of mine (LOM) will 

be 13 years.  

 

The Cipoeiro reserves will be mined in two (2) adjacent pits. The west pit has been named Contact Zone 

and the east pit has been named Blanket Zone.

21.1.8 Development Plan 

 

The processing plant will be built near the Cipoeiro deposit; therefore production will be initiated in this 

area. The Chega Tudo open pit is located 10 km from the processing plant. 

 

It is planned to start the Cipoeiro mine stripping with equipment six months before the start up of the 

processing plant. 

 

Contractors will be used in the years 2, 10 and 11 for the stripping and waste disposal of 10 Mt during 

year 2 and 5 Mt/y for years 10 and 11 (20 Mt total over all three years). 

 

During the first two years it is planned to extract approximately 4,961,000 t of sulfide ore with a grade of 

0.58 g/t (low grade ore) to be stored and gradually blended with the R.O.M. from the third year onwards. 

Thus, the ore to be processed will have an average grade of 1.47 g/t in Year 1 and 1.61 g/t in Year 2. 

Detailed tables of the mining plan including stockpile sizes and grades, total tonnage to be mined, a 

production plan, and a full breakdown of tonnage to be mined for both the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo pits 

are located in Appendix 15 - Development and Mining Plans. 



 

153 
 

Also during the first year approximately 3,127,900 t of oxidized ore will be mined and stockpiled, and 

fed to the processing plant later, at a maximum rate of 500,000 tpy.  

 

The Chega Tudo open pit is planned to begin in Year 8. 

 

Final pit configurations and cross-sections of each pit are presented in Appendix 06 - Mining Drawings. 

Figures 21.3 - 21.4 show the mining sequence. The mining sequence figures are in Appendix 07 - Mining 

Operations Sequencing Drawings.

21.1.9 Waste Stockpile 

 

The Waste dump design criteria are based on the Golder report RT-049-5134-1410-0007-00-B (GURUPI 

PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "WASTE DUMP DEPOSITION STUDIES"), dated February 2005. 

This report RT-049-5134-1410-0007-00-B refers to data from the reports DT-049-5134-1410-0011-00-B 

(GURUPI PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATIONS") and RT-049-

5134-1410-0009-00-B (GURUPI PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "REPORT ON GEOTECHNICAL 

GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION") prepared by Golder, dated February 2005 as shown in 

Appendix 08 – Geotechnical Studies Final Reports..  Dumps are planned to be located adjacent to each 

pit. For the saprolite waste Jaguar uses the parameters that are specified by Golder. The bedrock waste 

design parameters were adjusted slightly to better reflect the angle of repose for broken waste rock, 37º.

21.1.10 Summary Description of the Mining Method and Operations 

 

Conventional off road truck and excavator open pit mining method will be used for all pits (Contact 

Zone, Blanket Zone – collectively, the Cipoeiro pits - and Chega Tudo). The saprolite zone will be 

excavated by hydraulic excavator and the bedrock will require drilling and blasting. Pit slope design 

criteria for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo pits were based on a geotechnical study and report carried out 

by Golder report RT-049-5134-1410-0010-00-B (GURUPI PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "REPORT 



 

161 
 

ON PIT SLOPE DESIGN PARAMETERS"), dated February 2005. as shown in Appendix 08 – 

Geotechnical Studies Final Reports.  

 

Haul roads and in-pit ramps were designed at 10% gradient and with a width of 22 m, based on 

approximately three and half times the width of a Caterpillar 777 haul truck (approximately 6.1 m). This 

will provide sufficient width for two (2) lanes of traffic and also allows space for a drainage ditch and 

safety berm. 

 

The water management system deals with the drainage of the spring and rain water on the open pit, waste 

dump areas, process plant area, tailings basin area and on the Chega Tudo to Cipoeiro haul road.  

 

Mining equipment selection was based on the use of diesel-powered, rigid-framed haul trucks, front-end 

loaders and excavators. The pieces of equipment are assumed to be Owner-operated.  

 

Contractors will be used in the Years 2, 10 and 11 for the stripping and waste disposal of 10 Mt during 

year 2 and 5 Mt/y for Years 10 and 11 (20 Mt total over all three years). 

 

The stripping costs in these years are estimated to be 60% higher than if the stripping would be carried 

out by the owner fleet. Manpower inputs were calculated based on the equipment selection and on the 

shift roster schedule permitted by Brazilian labor laws.  

 

A mine schedule was developed for the three pits, one at Chega Tudo and two at Cipoeiro, based on an 

assumption of three 8-hour shifts per day, seven days per week. The mine schedule was stated using a 10-

m operational bench height and ore zones within each of the pits interpreted as being continuous. This 

allows flexible sequencing of ore and waste as required for mill feed. The ore and waste quantities in the 

schedule were reported separately for both the saprolite and bedrock material types. 

 

Mining is planned to commence in the Cipoeiro region due to its proximity to the process plant and the 

higher-grade ore in those pits. The mining start-up in this region also allows the mill to be commissioned 

using the lower-grade saprolite ore. An additional benefit of starting in Cipoeiro is that mining of higher-

grade bedrock ore will commence sooner in the mining schedule. Chega Tudo mining is scheduled to be 

initiated during year 8. Mining is gradually introduced at Chega Tudo to reduce the impact on the 

trucking requirements and to limit the number of benches mined later in the mine life. 

 

  



 

162 
 

21.1.11 Mine Schedule 

 

A mine schedule was developed for the three pits based on an assumption of three 8-hour shifts per day, 

seven days per week. The mining schedule is based on 7,665 available hours per year and assuming a 

12.5% loss in production hours: 

365 days x 24 h x 0.875= 7,665 h. 

 

The mine schedule was reported using 10-m operational bench heights and the pit slope conditions for 

each of the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo mining areas. 

 

Ore zones within each of the pits were interpreted as being continuous, allowing for flexible sequencing 

of ore and waste as required for mill feed. The ore and waste quantities in the schedule were reported 

separately for both the saprolite and bedrock material types. 

 

Chega Tudo mining is scheduled to be initiated during Year 8. Mining is gradually introduced at Chega 

Tudo to help reduce the impact on the trucking requirements and to limit the number of benches mined 

later in the mine life. 

 

The total LOM is 13 years.  

 

The criteria and constraints considered for the conceptual mining schedule include: 

 

• Mining is proposed to begin in 2012 (Year 1) with pre-stripping of 7 Mt of waste from the 

Cipoeiro pit region. 

• In 2013, or Year 1, ore will be sent to the mill at a proposed rate of 11,000 tpd and 10.5 Mt of 

waste will continue to be stripped from the Cipoeiro pit region 

• In 2014, or Year 2, it is presumed the mill will be fed with 12,250 tpd of ore, and a continued 

waste stripping of 80,000 t/d. 

• In 2015, Year 3, the mill is scheduled be at full production and will receive 13,700 tpd of ore, 

while stripping continues to uncover ore. 

• For the rest of the project life, the mill feed will remain the same as year 3. 

 

The detailed Production Plan is presented in Table 21.1.11.1.

21.1.12 Rock Mechanics Considerations 

 

Pit slope design criteria for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo pits were based on a study by Golder: report 

RT-049-5134-1410-0010-00-B (GURUPI PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE "REPORT ON PIT SLOPE 

DESIGN PARAMETERS"), dated February 2005. This report RT-049-5134-1410-0010-00-B refers data 

from the report DT-049-5134-1410-0011-00-B (GURUPI PROJECT FEASIBILITY PHASE 

"GEOTECHNICAL INVESTIGATIONS"), prepared by Golder, dated February 2005, as shown in 

Appendix 08 – Geotechnical Studies Final Reports.  

 

The field investigation consisted of one vertical drill hole and eleven inclined diamond drill holes, five 

vertical piezometer installations, infiltration and packer testing, and collection of soil and rock samples 

for laboratory testing. The results of the investigations were used as the basis for formulating the 

Engineering Geology and Engineering Hydrogeology Models, defining the design criteria and for 

providing the recommendations for the pit slopes.  

 

This report presents the results of the geotechnical component of this investigation. A separate report, 

also by Golder, U04-1170-051-2000 (GURUPI PROJECT "HYDROGEOLOGIC CONDITIONS AT 

CIPOEIRO AND CHEGA TUDO PITS), dated February 2005 as shown in Appendix 09 – Hydrogeology 

Study Report, describes the hydrogeology setting of the proposed open pits, and provides an estimation of 

steady-state groundwater inflows to these pits and a discussion of dewatering/depressurization methods, 

which could be used to manage groundwater inflows to the pits.  

 

The planned pits in the Chega Tudo area are underlain by three main rock types, referred to as Andesite, 

Dacite and Metasediments (Sandstone). The Andesite and Dacite tend to occur to the west and the 

Sandstone to the east. Within the Cipoeiro pit areas, two main rock types, Metasediments (Sandstone – to 

the west) and Tonalite (to the east and around the pit in the Blanket Ore Zone), are expected to daylight 

on the pit walls. 

 

Based on the investigation results, geological and geotechnical maps and vertical cross sections were 

prepared to formulate the Engineering Geology Model, considering that the slope walls will ultimately be 

comprised of a weathering profile, divided into three geotechnical zones referred to as the Weathered 

Zone, Slightly Weathered Zone, and Fresh Bedrock Zone. 

 

The Weathered Zone includes the Overburden (or transported soils), Saprolite ore (weathered rock) and 

Saprock ore (moderately to highly weathered rock) layers. The total thickness of the Weathered Zone 



 

165 
 

varies according to the host rock from about 19 m (above the tonalite in the Cipoeiro area) to 36 m 

(above the dacite/andesite in the Chega Tudo area).  

 

The total thickness of the Slightly Weathered Zone varies from 6 m to 9 m at the Chega Tudo and 

Cipoeiro, respectively. The Fresh Bedrock Zone is found typically below 45 m and 25 m, respectively at 

the Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro pit areas. 

 

In general, the potential for instability within the Weathered Zone will be primarily through the soil 

materials (i.e., rotational failure). For the lower portion of the Weathered Zone (i.e., within the Saprock), 

instability may also occur by a combination of rotational failure and planar failure through pre-existing 

("relic") discontinuities. 

 

For the rock slope configurations, the planned Gurupi pits were divided into 4 and 8 sectors for the Chega 

Tudo and Cipoeiro pits, respectively, depending on the direction that the slope is facing. Kinematic 

analyses was carried out to estimate stable pit slope geometries for each of these pit sectors, using the 

structural rock fabric for each main rock type expected to daylight on the pit wall. Vertical bench 

separations of 10 m and 20 m were considered for the slope within the Weathered and Slightly Weathered 

Zones and Fresh Bedrock Zone, respectively. 

 

The results are summarized on Table 21.1.12.1.

An assessment of the overall quality of the rock masses that comprise the Gurupi Open Pits has been 

prepared using the Bieniawski (1976) Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system for rock mass classification. The 

classification considers average rock mass conditions. In addition, no distinction has been made in terms 

of the saprolite as a function of its parent rock. 

 

Tables 21.1.12.2 and 21.1.12.3 summarize the RMR ratings for the Weathered, Slightly Weathered and 

Fresh Bedrock Zones estimated for the Gurupi pit walls, using the Bieniawski (1976) rock mass 

classification. 

 

The Weathered Zone (comprised of Saprolite and Saprock), as shown in Table 21.1.12.2, has average 

RMR values of 18 to 24 for the Saprolite and Saprock rock units, respectively. These RMR values 

classify the rock mass as very poor (Class V) to poor (Class V-IV). 

 

Table 21.1.12.2 also shows fair rock mass quality for the Slightly Weathered Zone, where the weathering 

decreases, the strength increases, but the rock mass is, in general, fractured to very fractured.

21.1.13 Hydrological Considerations 

 

The water management system deals with the drainage of the spring and rain water in the open pit, waste 

dump areas, process plant area, tailings basin area and on the Chega Tudo to Cipoeiro haul road.  

 

The climate in the Gurupi area is equatorial. The area receives about 2,000 mm of precipitation annually 

based on data collected at two nearby meteorological stations (Maracaçumé and Zé Doca). Average 

monthly precipitation ranges from about 21 mm to 364 mm. Most of the rain falls between December and 

June, when average monthly precipitation ranges from about 100 mm to over 350 mm. During the 

remainder of the year (July through November), average monthly precipitation is less than 50 mm. 

Annual potential evapotranspiration was estimated to be about 1,666 mm.  

 

The average annual temperature near the Project site is about 26 oC to 27 oC. 

 

Groundwater occurs in saprolite, saprock and underlying bedrock. The saprolite and residual soils are 

generally low permeable and form aquitards. The saprock and the upper 5 to 10 m of the bedrock surface 

(weathered and slightly weathered zone) are moderately permeable and form an aquifer. The bedrock has 

low permeability below the upper 5 to 10 m (fresh bedrock zone), except in highly fractured areas. The 

depth to groundwater across the site is generally within a few meters to 15 meters from the ground 

surface. This provided for the completion of wells for lowering the water table. Hydrogeology data and 

studies are based on the Golder report U04-1170-051-2000 (GURUPI PROJECT "HYDROGEOLOGIC 

CONDITIONS AT CIPOEIRO AND CHEGA TUDO PITS), dated February 2005 as shown in Appendix 

09 – Hydrogeology Study Report. 

 

A detailed description of the sediment control structures is in section 24.4.9.4. Structures would vary in 

size; some would be temporary and only in service during the construction and development phases, 

others would be permanent and provide sediment control over the LOM.  

 

The mining activity will encompass the garimpo areas and may result in mobilization of some historical 

pit water mercury contamination. For this reason, treatment of pit dewatering water should also address 

Hg removal to a level of 0.0002 mg/l to ensure compliance with Brazilian environmental legislation. For 

purposes of this feasibility study, the assumption is that the pit water would be treated, if needed, in an in-

pit sump where metals would be precipitated by the addition of appropriate reagents, likely to be lime. 

However, this is considered an unlikely scenario due to the attenuation expected.  

 



 

176 
 

Golder estimated the average dewatering flow rates to be 86 m3/h from the Chega Tudo pit, and 123 m3/h 

from the Cipoeiro pit. The pumping system has been designed to manage 200 m3/h for each pit. The 

groundwater dewatering of the pit will effectively lower the phreatic surface around the mine area. The 

groundwater pumped from the mines will not serve the plant (See Appendix 05 – Project Water Balance).  

Instead, this water will be used either for processing plant supply when applicable, for dust suppression, 

or discharged to the stone check dams built for sediment control. 

 
 Storm water management, from large storm events, will require in-pit management, using a combination 

of mine planning, operational techniques and mobile pumps. In the case of a storm, two systems may be 

used simultaneously in one of the pits (to be defined by the technical operating staff). The supply to the 

processing plant will be secured with material to be stocked in Year 1 (1,577,000 t) and Year 2 

(2,150,000 t.) 

 

Based on acid-base accounting and net acid generating tests conducted, acid generation from waste and 

tails is not expected to be a problem during operations. 

 

21.1.14 Equipment Selection 

 

21.1.14.1 Introduction 

 

Mining equipment selection is based on the use of diesel-powered rigid-frame haul trucks, front-end 

loaders, excavators and hydraulic drilling. Equipment types were determined based on the experience of 

Minere, and of the Jaguar team and the analysis of the compatibility to production schedule, operational 

constraints and optimization of financial results. They have been fully reviewed by TechnoMine. For a 

full and detailed backup of the mining equipment selection, see Appendix 10 - Sizing of Mining 

Equipment. 

 

The Owner production fleet will consist of 100 t (nominal payload class) haul trucks (CAT 777 F or 

equivalent) and a front-end loader (CAT 992 K or equivalent for loading ore). Waste will be moved using 

the same truck fleet but using an excavator (Liebherr R 984 C or similar) for loading. The estimated 

Owner's production fleet also includes production drills for the bedrock mining. It has been assumed that 

the saprolite will not require drilling. Drilling in the bedrock zone will be carried out by a hydraulic top 

hammer drill (Sandvik–DP 1500i or similar). 

 



 

177 
 

The drilling requirements were estimated using basic drill-and-blast assumptions for similar rock types. 

Penetration rates are based on rock quality designation and information provided by the manufacturer. 

Preliminary blasting designs and powder factor assumptions are based on the experience of the Jaguar 

team and the existing technical bibliographies. 

 

Contractors will be used in the Years 2, 10 and 11 for the stripping and waste disposal of 10 Mt during 

year 2 and 5 Mt/y for Years 10 and 11 (20 Mt total over all three years).  

 

21.1.14.2 Ore Loading Equipment: Front-End Loaders 

 

The loader productivity was calculated using Caterpillar Simulator, assuming a haul truck fleet made up 

of CAT 777F trucks. Loader cycle time and bucket fill factor were taken from the Caterpillar 

Performance Handbook, based on the appropriate material types. The saprolite ore is 10.7% of the all 

existing ore in Cipoeiro deposit. Therefore, the loader productivity was calculated using compact ore 

(bedrock) data.

Based on the monthly production plan, the operational loader capacity and its operating rate (information 

from the manufacturer), the number of loaders was calculated for the project.

21.1.14.4 Haul Trucks (CAT 777F) 

 

Haul truck productivity rates were calculated by Caterpillar Simulator, using the average haulage profile 

for ore and waste, based on the annual mining sequence design. The cycle times were calculated using 

travel times plus loading cycle times  and dump and maneuver times. The hauler payload for ore is 91.97 

t / cycle and for waste is 97.60 t / cycle.

21.1.14.5 Drills 

 

Drilling requirements were estimated based on basic drilling and blasting parameters. The 

parameters of blasting design for sub-grade drilling and hole diameters, were defined according 

to the bench height, stated as 10 m.  

 

For the drilling it was specified to use a top-hammer hydraulic rock drill, manufactured by 

Sandvick, model DP 1500i (or similar). Based on experience and information obtained from drill 

suppliers, the penetration rate was assumed to be 30 m per hour. This became the basis for 

estimating drilling hours to meet the planned production. These hours were then used to 

determine the number of required pieces of equipment.

• Rock blasting 

• Ore and waste loading and hauling 

• Wind erosion on bare surfaces (gravel road, waste dumps, benches) 

 

Rock drilling generates most of the dust that affects workers at surface mines.  

 

The operation will use a hydraulic drilling machine with a dry drilling system. This machine 

shall have a special system of hole drilling dust collection and storage and an enclosed and air 

filtering operating cab. The dry dust collection system requires an enclosure around the area 

where the drill stem enters the ground. This enclosure is constructed by hanging a rubber or cloth 

shroud from the underside of the drill deck. The enclosure is then ducted to a dust collector, the 

clean side of which has a fan. The fan creates negative pressure inside the enclosure, capturing 

dust as it exits the hole during drilling. The dust is retained in the collector and clean air is 

exhausted through the fan and a baghouse. 

 

The dust control during blasting will be done by optimizing the blast design and using high 

quality explosives and accessories. A very effective way to reduce dust emissions during hauling 

is to use proper and well gradated aggregate in the gravel road construction. The gravel used for 

the roads will be a mixture of three sizes or types of aggregate: stone, sand, and fines. The sand 

fills voids between the stones to give the road stability and the fines perform as a cement to bind 

the three materials together. This creates a strong and cohesive road that will keep a tight surface, 

even during periods of dry weather. 

 

So a good quality gravel that is well graded with the proper percentage of plastic clay will be 

used for road surfacing associated with continuous water sprinkling of the mine to plant roads.  

 

A fleet maintenance program associated with constant operator training will be used to minimize 

the effects of gases and particulates from the diesel engines. The excavator, loader and truck 

operators will work inside enclosed cabs with filtered air. 

 



 

188 
 

Additional care will be carried out to minimize the dust in the air by growing grass and trees over 

the waste dump and mine benches as soon as they are at their final configuration and available 

for reforestation. 

 

The operation will deploy a program of monitoring and controlling of dust emissions in 

accordance with the Brazilian standards and codes (Code: NRM 9). Details of the standards and 

other parameters that will be utilized by Jaguar to control dust emissions is provided in Appendix 

11- Mining Dust Control - Brazilian and English Codes.

21.1.19 Mining Operating Costs Estimate (Mine OPEX) 

 

The mining unit costs were developed from year to year, reflecting the development of the mine. 

Costs for Chega Tudo are significantly higher than the costs for Cipoeiro as a consequence of the 

10-km haul from the proposed pit to the plant. See Appendix 14 - Mining CAPEX and OPEX 

Estimates. 

 

Final unit mining costs are summarized in Table 21.1.19.1.

21.2 ORE PROCESSING AND METALLURGY 

 

21.2.1 Process Route  

 

Section 21.2.2 of this Report describes the process route in detail, while an overall view is 

portrayed in this item. 

 



 

194 
 

The process route described in Sections 21.2.1 and 21.2.2 and portrayed in Appendix 16 – 

Process Flow Diagram, refers to Stage-1 processing, which is processing of Tonalite ore.  The 

ore-hosting rock at the Cipoeiro Open-Pit Mine is Tonalite, while Dacite plays this role at the 

Chega Tudo Open-Pit Mine.  Dacite will be processed in Stage 2 only, starting in 2020.  

However, the ore type that poses the greater technical challenge for a given processing unit 

operation always dictates the processing equipment selection and operations regime.  

 

The mineral processing route will consist of the following sequence of macro unit operations:   

 

Block 1: 100% of the Total Mill Feed (solids of Tonalite and Transition Ore) and 100% of the 

Total Feed to the Saprolite Scrubbing and Classification Plant – No cyanide addition. 

  

 Crushing and Screening, including HPGR as tertiary crusher;  

 Grinding, Cycloning, and Thickening;  

 Flotation and Gravity Concentration of the Flotation Rejects ; 

 Rejects Cycloning and Thickening Plant fed by the Gravity Circuit Rejects (about 

82% of the Total Mill Feed - solids); 

 Regrinding, Cycloning and Thickening of the Flotation Concentrate; 

 Saprolite Scrubbing and Classification Plant. 

 

Block 2: 18% of the Total Mill Feed (solids) and 100% Saprolite Mill Feed (solids) – Cyanide 

addition. 

 

 Hydrometallurgy - via a conventional Leaching and ADR 

(Adsorption/Desorption/Recovery) Carbon-in-Pulp (CIP) Process of the 

reground/thickened flotation concentrate and saprolite ore feed. Recovery will be 

performed by an Electrowinning (EW) Circuit, after Elution (Desorption; Stripping) 

of the CIP loaded carbon; 

 Cyanide Destruction Plant for the CIP Tailings pulp. 

 



 

195 
 

It is worth noting that the adopted Overall Metallurgical Recovery (flotation/gravity 

separation/leaching/ADR) is 85.6%.  The metallurgical recovery was embraced based on testwork 

carried out by SGS Lakefield, Canada ("SGS"), Knelson Research & Technology Centre – 

Langley, BC, Canada ("KNELSON") - See Chapter 16 – Mineral Processing and Metallurgical 

Testing, and SGS/KNELSON/TechnoMine's interpretations of the testwork results.  

 

The complete Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Plant Process Flow Diagrams (with Mass 

Balances) are presented in Appendix 16 – Process Flow Diagrams, while the supporting 

calculations used to size the most important systems and pieces of process equipment are shown in 

Appendix 17 – Process Equipment and Supporting Calculations.   

 

21.2.2 Process Description  

 

21.2.2.1 Introduction 

 

The Project LOM will be approximately thirteen (13) years.  It is anticipated that operations will 

start in the first quarter of 2013 with a forecasted production for that year of 4,000,000 t.  In 

2014, the forecasted production is 4,500,000 t of ROM, increasing to 5,000,000 t yearly from 

2015 to 2021.  The LOM will be completed with the following production for the remaining 

years: 5,200,000 t in 2022, 5,256,650 t in 2023, and 4,900,000 t in 2024 and 2025.  The total 

ROM production of 63,756,700 t should contain about 2,327,930 oz Au at an average grade of 

1.14 g/t. 

 

The estimated Mill Feed grade is 1.10 g/t (MCF = 97%).  An estimated Overall Metallurgical 

Recovery of 85.6% ("metallurgical recovery") is expected, based on extensive testwork carried 

out by world-class laboratories and research centers in Canada, Germany (HPGRs viability), 

Australia, and Brazil (See Appendix 03 – Recent Metallurgical and Environmental Tests 

Reports) and further TechnoMine's interpretations of the reported testwork results.  Hence, the 

Project is expected to produce a total salable amount of approximately 1,932,920 oz Au.  This 

corresponds to an average gold output of about 148,690 opy (troy ounces per year) over the 

LOM (~13 years). 



 

196 
 

 

The following calculation is a check for the Mill Feed contained gold:  

 

63,756,700 t * 1.10 g/t * 0.856 / 31.1 g/oz = 1,930,330 oz Au over the 13-year LOM. 

 

The ore processing plant will include five (5) main industrial units: saprolite (scrubbing and 

screening), crushing and screening, grinding and cycloning, flotation and gravity separation, and 

regrinding-thickening-hydrometallurgy that encompasses a leaching line of the flotation 

concentrate and all saprolite and an ensuing CIP ("Carbon-in-Pulp") - ADR 

("Adsorption/Desorption/Recovery") circuit.  The CIP tailings pulp will be conveyed to a Detox 

Plant, from where the treated pulp will be transported directly to the lined TUDO AZUL Tailings 

Dam.  The tests related to the cyanide destruction process route in the Detox Plant will be carried 

out by either CyPlus GmbH in Germany or by AMMTEC Ltd. in Australia.  

 

Properly sized pontoon-mounted pumping stations will pump the supernatant water from TUDO 

AZUL back to the plant. 

 

The cyanide-free rejects pulp will be conveyed to a thickening plant, which consists of cyclones 

and a thickener. The cyclones' underflow stream, with approximately 72% (wt) solids, 

corresponds to about 66% of the Project's tonalite ore mill feed solids mass. The cyclones 

overflow stream, containing highly water-diluted fine solid particles (16% of the tonalite ore mill 

feed solids mass) will be conveyed to a 150-ft diameter flocculant-added high capacity Rejects 

Thickener for water recovery.  The thickened underflow stream – in excess of 37% solids (wt) – 

will join the cyclones' underflow stream.  The resulting stream (60.6% solids – wt) will be 

pumped to the cyanide-free BARRO LIMPO Rejects Dam (Cipoeiro Mine ore rejects) and to the 

POÇÃO Rejects Disposal Facility (Chega Tudo Mine ore rejects).   

 

Properly sized pontoon-mounted pumping stations will pump the supernatant water from 

BARRO LIMPO and POÇÃO back to the plant. 

 



 

197 
 

The crushing plant for tonalite ore will be designed for 4.5 Mtpy and will operate 365 days per 

year, using three (3) eight (8)-hour shifts: three (3) crews – on a thirty (30) effective days/month 

regime.  Based on a Utilization Factor ("UF") of 84.7% and a General Electromechanical 

Availability Factor ("GEMAF") of 85%, the number of effective daily hours has been calculated: 

(24 hours/day) * (0.847) * (0.85) = ~ 17.28 hours/day.  Since the crushing plant will produce ca 

4,500,000 tpy (solids) at 365 days/year, the crushing plant nominal solids throughput will be 

about 713.5 tph: (12,330 tpd) / (17.28 h/day).  A design capacity of 856 tph (solids) has been 

adopted for the crushing plant, corresponding to a design factor of 1.20.  The assumed effective 

Operating Efficiency ("OE") = (UF * GEMAF) is: (0.847) * (0.850)*(100) = 72.0%. 

 

For tonalite ore, the High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) circuit and the grinding plant will 

operate 365 days/year, with three (3) 8-hour shifts per day (four (4) eight (8)-hour shift crews).  

The actual operating regimes for the HPGR circuit and the grinding plant contemplate an UF and 

a GEMAF of 97.5%, corresponding to an Operating Efficiency of 95% [(0.975)*(0.975)*(100)], 

equivalent to 8,322 operational hours.  Therefore, the nominal solids throughput will be about 

541 tph (= 4,500,000 t/year / 8,322 h/year).  A design capacity of 649 tph (solids) was adopted 

for this section of the process, corresponding to a design factor of 1.20.  

 

The saprolite comminution plant (scrubbing and screening) has been designed for 500,000 tpy 

(solids) and will operate in the same basis as the tonalite ore grinding plant, equivalent to 8,322 

operational hours per year.  Therefore, this plant will produce a nominal solids throughput of 

about 60 tph: (1,370 tpd).  A design capacity of 72 tph (solids) has been adopted for this section 

of the process, corresponding to a design factor of 1.20. 

 

The hydrometallurgical route starts at the Flotation Plant, which is fed by the Grinding Plant 

closed-circuit cyclones overflow, after it is thickened.  The Gravity Separation Plant uses 

continuous discharge centrifugal concentrators to separate the final rejects (gravity rejects) from 

the scavenger flotation rejects.  The gravity concentration will be recycled to the Grinding Plant.  

A Leaching-CIP-ADR circuit of the reground flotation concentrate and ground saprolite ensues.  

The route finishes with the smelting of cathodes into gold bullion, using an Induction Furnace.  



 

198 
 

The Hydrometallurgical Plant will operate 8,322 hours/year: (365 days / year) x (24 hours / day) 

x (0.95). 

 

The adopted value (~ 95%) for the hydrometallurgical plant Operating Efficiency - the same 

value adopted for the grinding plant - corresponds to the product of the UF by the GEMAF: 

(0.975)*(0.975) = 0.9506.  

 

Consequently, the anticipated gross nominal hourly gold production rate will be approximately 

17.87 oz Au/h for the anticipated annual Project production (148,690 opy) at 8,322 hours/year.  

The Hydrometallurgical Plant has been sized for 23 oz Au/h (design capacity). 

 

As shown in Item 21.2.2.12 of this section, a flotation/gravity/leaching metallurgical recovery of 

about 85.6% was adopted for the Project, based on the interpretation of the testwork carried out 

by SGS using representative samples of the Project Mill Feed, entailing both the Cipoeiro and 

Chega Tudo Ore Bodies.  

 

Unless otherwise indicated, the plant process equipment was sized by TechnoMine (see 

Appendix 17 – Process Equipment Supporting Calculations). 

 

21.2.2.2 Crushing and Screening Plant 

 

The Tonalite Ore crushing and screening plant includes a primary crusher (jaw) and a pair of 

secondary cone crushers.  The ROM (Top Size = 500 mm and F80 = 12") will be discharged 

directly into the hopper with a 200-t capacity, from which it will feed the crushing and screening 

plant at a nominal rate of 747 tph (total mass), a UF of 85% and a GEMAF of 85% were 

considered - Design Feed Rate = 897 tph (total mass).  The crushing plant area includes ROM 

Surge Dumps, totaling about 3,000 t (approximately 30 truck charges capacity).  

 

The ROM will feed a vibrating Grizzly that will scalp the minus 7" fraction (approximately 374 

t/h (total mass) = 50% scalping).  The oversize of the Grizzly feeds the primary crusher, a Metso 



 

199 
 

C145 or similar, by gravity ("rolling over").  A dedicated hydraulic hammer will be installed to 

break lumps of ROM that may come from the mine.  

 

The undersize of the Grizzly feeds the same belt conveyor that receives the primary crusher 

product (nominal flow rate = 374 tph total mass @ 100% minus 7").  The primary crusher has 

been sized for 450 tph (total mass) and will operate with CSS at 5". Both grizzly undersize and 

crusher product will feed two banana screens.  The conveyor belt that transports this material 

will have an integrating scale.  The oversize of the screens will feed the secondary cone crushers 

hopper.  A magnetic extractor and a metal detector will be installed (in this sequence) over the 

conveyor belt that transports this oversize.  Vibrating feeders will feed two Metso HP-300 or 

similar cone crushers, which discharge will be fed to the same belt conveyor that feeds the 

banana screens.  

 

The 2-deck banana screens (two units) that will be placed before the secondary crusher have the 

function of scalping the secondary crusher feed from the minus 25.0 mm (P80 cut size) material, 

which is the secondary crushing plant product size.  The relief deck cuts the feed at 3" and the 

second deck cuts the feed at 1 ½", and their oversize feed the secondary crushers' hopper.  The 

undersize of the screens (cut at 1 ½"  P80 "mesh" size = 25.0 mm) will be transported to the 

25,000 t total capacity stockpile (about 44 operational hours).  The live capacity will be about 

10,800 t (about 19 operational hours).  Four (4) variable-speed belt feeders will be installed 

under the surge pile, to reclaim the crushed ore and feed the hopper at the HPGR facility. 

 

A magnetic extractor and a metal detector will be installed (in this sequence) over the conveyor 

belt that transports the secondary crushing plant product from the stockpile to the hopper at the 

HPGR facility. 

 

21.2.2.3 Saprolite Ore Plant 

 

The Saprolite Ore Plant will include a scrubber with trommel followed by a primary screen and a 

secondary screen.  The ROM (Top Size = 500 mm and F80 = ~ 5") will be heaped in a 3,500-t 

capacity dump piles (about total 58 hours nominal capacity). 



 

200 
 

 

A dedicated front end loader will select the occasional lumpy ore and will put it out in another 

pile.  This same front end loader will feed a hopper and an apron feeder at a nominal rate of 60 

tph of solids on a dry basis (71 tph on a wet basis).  The Design Feed Rate to the scrubber is 72 

tph (dry basis).  

 

The scrubber will have a trommel (cut size 25 mm), which oversize will be stockpiled. The 

trommel undersize will feed the 1-deck-primary screen (cut size 12 mm) which oversize will join 

to the trommel oversize to be stockpiled.  The primary screen undersize will feed the 1-deck-

high-frequency-secondary screen (cut size 0.4 mm) which oversize will be conveyed to the 

flotation-concentrate-regrinding plant.  The underflow, about 45% solids (wt), will be 

conditioned with lime at pH 11.0 in a 50-m3 agitated conditioner (around 30 minutes of residence 

time).  Variable speed pumps (one in operation and one in standby) will pump the saprolite ore 

pulp to the third leaching tank.  A flowmeter, a densimeter, and an automatic sampler will be 

installed in the piping to control the saprolite ore fed to the leaching circuit. 

 

The stockpiled coarse material will be recovered by the front end loader and transported by 

trucks to the tonalite ore surge pile facility.  The occasional lumpy ore selected, if gold bearing, 

will feed the primary jaw crusher from the tonalite ore crushing plant. 

 

21.2.2.4 High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) and Classification (Screening) Plant 

 

From the HPGR plant hopper, the crushed ore (80% minus 25 mm) will be fed at a nominal 

solids rate of 541 tph rate (design feed rate = 650 tph solids), through variable speed belt feeder.  

An integrating scale will be positioned on the belt conveyor that feeds the HPGR. 

 

HPGR product will pass through a flakes "destroyer" before feeding the 2-deck vibrating 

screens.  These screens cut the HPGR discharge at 1/2" (relief deck) and 3.0 mm and their 

oversize circulates back to the HPGR.  The undersize of the screens (cut at 3.0 mm  P80 

"mesh" size = 1.9 mm) will discharge into a sump with variable speed pumps (VS pumps), one 

in operation and one in standby.  



 

201 
 

 

The speed of the VS pumps is determined online by the Regulatory Control System that actuates 

in their motors' frequency inverters.  VS pumps will feed the Vertimills® discharge sump.  

 

21.2.2.5 Grinding and Classification (Cycloning) Plant 

 

Cycloning and overflow settling tests were carried out by TESTWORK Ltda, a local 

metallurgical laboratory, under TechnoMine's supervision (methodology) to generate results to 

support the dimensions of the thickener, as well as the best flocculant type and dosage.  

 

From the HPGR sump, the pulp (80% minus 1.9 mm) will be pumped at a nominal solids rate of 

541 tph (design feed rate = 650 tph solids) to the discharge sump of the grinding and 

classification plant, through variable speed pumps.  This stream, which is pumped to the 

discharge-sump of the Vertimills®- five (5) operating in parallel, will have a flowmeter and a 

densimeter to control the mass flow rate online.  This flow rate will automatically adjust, via the 

control system, the feed rate to the HPGR. 

 

 HPGR, Grinding and Flotation Plants Nominal Solids Throughput   

            = {[4.5 Mtpy / [(365 days/year) * (24 hours/day)]} / (0.975 * 0.975) = 541 tph.  

            Utilization Factor (U F) and General Electromechanical Availability Factor  

(GEMAF) = 97.5%;  

 Flotation Mass Recovery = 18%; 

 Hydrometallurgical Plant Nominal Solids Throughput = (541 tph) * (0.18) = 97.4 tph; 

 Grinding and Flotation Design Solids Throughput = (541 tph) * (1.20) = ~650 tph, design 

factor = 1.20; 

 Hydrometallurgical Design Solids Throughput = (541 tph) * (0.18) * (1.20) = 117 tph, 

design factor = 1.20. 

 

The grinding plant will have five (5) Vertimills® Metso VTM-1500, or similar, (1500 HP each 

one) operating (130 tph solids – design) in parallel.  

 



 

202 
 

The Bond Ball Work Indices for a representative Project Tonalite sample were determined by 

KHD-Humboldt (on the HPGR product) to be: 16.4 kWh/t or 14.9 kWh/st at 125 µm.  The 

calculated Work Indices were: 16.1 kWh/st at 106 µm and 19.2 kWh/st at 75 µm.  

 

Each Vertimill® will operate in reverse and closed circuit with an ordinary cyclone cluster, sized 

to cut the solids fraction at 80% minus 106 μm, which has been determined by TechnoMine to 

be the optimum size for the subsequent flotation process.  The flotation/leaching tests were 

performed by SGS (See Appendix 03 – Recent Metallurgical & Environmental Tests Reports).  

The cyclones' overflow, about 22% solids (wt), will be fed to a trash screen, followed by a 75-ft 

diameter flocculant-added high-capacity thickener (Flotation Thickener), which underflow 

stream will feed the flotation plant. 

 

The underflow stream of the cyclone cluster will be the circulating load of the Vertimills®.  A 

distributor with five (5) outlet pipes will be installed to receive the cyclone cluster underflow.  

Each outlet pipe will have a pneumatic valve that will feed an individual Vertimill®. 

 

A Particle Size Analyzer ("PSA") will be positioned at the cyclone cluster overflow stream for 

the online measurement of milled material size (P80).  The PSA will supply online data for the 

grinding and classification plant control system.  The Vertimills® discharge sump will have 

automatic water addition system.  The plant control systems (Regulatory and Online Optimizing, 

in the future) will determine the set-points online for the water addition system. 

 

The sump that feeds the cyclones cluster will have variable speed pumps (VS pumps). The speed 

of the VS pumps will be determined online by the Regulatory Control System that actuates in 

their motors' frequency inverters.  One pump will be in operation and one in standby mode.  The 

feed stream to the cyclones cluster will have a flowmeter and a densimeter to control the 

cyclones performance via feed mass flow rates.  The overflow of the cyclones cluster will feed a 

trash screen, followed by a high-capacity 75-ft diameter thickener (Flotation Thickener), which 

underflow stream (40% solids – wt) will feed the flotation plant. 



 

203 
 

 

21.2.2.6 Flotation Circuit 

 

The overflow of the cyclones cluster, after passing through a trash screen to remove organics and 

the flocculant-added conventional high-capacity thickener for % solids adjustment, will feed the 

flotation conditioner.  Collector (PAX) and Promoter (Cytec A-208 or Danaflot D468) will be 

added in the conditioner, while the frother (MIBC) will be added in the outlet thereof.  The use 

of sulfide activator, such as copper sulfate, is not anticipated.  All reagents will have staged 

additions. 

 

Since the total nominal solids feed rate to the flotation circuit is 617 tph, the solids density equals 

2.75 t/m3 and pulp density is 40% solids (wt), the total feed rate of the flotation is ca 1,147 m3/h 

(1,109 m3/h feed from thickener underflow plus 38 m3/h scavenger recycle feed).  The total 

residence time (rougher and scavenger) is 25 minutes.  Therefore, the required nominal volume 

for the flotation is 478 m3 or 16,880 ft3 [(1,147 m3/h) * (25 min) * (1 h / 60 min)].  Taking into 

account a design factor of 1.20 the required design volume is 574 m3 or 20,271 ft3.  Therefore, 

adopting 100-m3 Tank Cells, six (6) units are required.  

 

Rougher residence time will be about 20 minutes.  Since a cleaner stage is not contemplated, the 

rougher concentrate will feed directly to the regrinding circuit.  The expected mass recovery is 

about 18% containing ca 90% of the gold fed to the flotation circuit. 

 

Scavenger concentrate will be recycled to the rougher stage.  An alternative route will exist to 

allow the scavenger concentrate to be sent to the rougher concentrate sump. This alternative 

route may be necessary depending on the flotation selectivity at any given time.  The scavenger 

concentrate must be circulated (high mass pull) or alternatively can be final concentrate (low 

mass pull) to be reground and leached. 

 

The flotation rejects (nominal 498 tph solids at 40% solids - wt) will be pumped to the 

continuous centrifugal concentrators cluster.  Five (5) Falcon C4000, or similar, units will be 



 

204 
 

required.  The gravity concentrate will be recycled to the Vertimills® distributor to improve the 

gold and sulfides liberation.  

 

The gravity rejects (nominal 443 tph solids diluted at 30% solids - wt) will be pumped to a 

cycloning facility that will split the +325 mesh material (66% of the Tonalite ROM tonnage 

delivered to the Plant).  The overflow (split the -325 mesh material – 16% of the Tonalite ROM 

tonnage to be delivered to the Plant) will be thickened before joining the cycloning underflow.  

The resulting stream at about 61% solids – wt will be pumped to the BARRO LIMPO Cyanide-

free Rejects Dam. 

 

The flotation cyanide-free rejects cycloning operation overflow stream will be thickened in a 

150-ft diameter flocculant-added high-capacity thickener.  This thickening will be undertaken in 

order to generate recoverable water and to thicken the cyanide-free rejects to a density in excess 

of 37% solids (wt) before pumping them, joined with the cycloning underflow, to the bare 

(nonlined) BARRO LIMPO Cyanide-free Rejects Dam at about 61% solids - wt.  The total solids 

mass to be conveyed to the BARRO LIMPO Cyanide-free Rejects Dam corresponds to 82% of 

the Tonalite ROM tonnage delivered to the Plant.  After the Cipoeiro Mine is exhausted, the pit 

(POÇÃO) will be used to dispose the cyanide-free rejects from the Chega Tudo Mine. 

 

21.2.2.7 Regrinding and Thickening of the Flotation Concentrate 

 

The flotation rougher concentrate stream will feed the regrinding Vertimill® discharge sump.  

The saprolite ore (secondary-screen oversize) will be fed through the distributor to the regrinding 

Vertimills®.  Variable speed pumps ("VS pumps" – one in operation and one in standby) will 

feed the cyclones cluster.  The overflow stream (P80 = 25 µm) will feed a 150-ft flocculant-

added high-capacity thickener (Concentrate Thickener). The thickener underflow stream will 

feed the distributor to the regrinding Vertimills®: Three (3) Metso VTM-1500 (or similar) units 

shall be required. 

 

Lead nitrate is not predicted to be added to the Regrinding Circuit. 

 



 

205 
 

Variable speed pumps ("VS pumps") will pump the underflow, 45% solids (wt), of the thickener 

to feed the pre-lime tank.  A flowmeter and a densimeter will be placed on this stream, in order 

to control the feed mass flow rate of the hydrometallurgical plant. The overflow will be recycled 

to the 3500-m3 capacity Industrial Water Tank. 

 

21.2.2.8 Leaching and CIP-ADR Processes 

 

21.2.2.8.1 Leaching Circuit  

 

After grinding, flotation, and gravity separation, the flotation concentrate will be reground to 

80% minus 25 µm and then thickened.  The slurry (45% solids by weight) will be pumped from 

the 150-ft high-capacity Regrinding Circuit Thickener (Concentrate Thickener) to the pre-lime 

Agitator (level 8 of agitation) tank.  The pH adjusted and aerated pulp flows by gravity to the 

first Leaching Agitator (level 8 of agitation) of the five-tank leaching train.  An automatic 

sampler will be positioned on this stream beyond the flowmeter and densimeter.  Lime 

[Ca(OH)2] will be added to the first tank to increase pH, which is a critical factor for the 

appropriate leaching kinetics to take place.  From the first tank ("Pre-Lime" – 2,250 m3 - live), 

the pulp overflows to the second tank and so on (2,250 m3 each one – live) until the fifth (last) 

leaching tank. The pre-conditioned (pH-adjusted) pulp from the Saprolite Ore Plant (secondary 

screen undersize) will join the feed of the third leaching tank.  An automatic sampler will be 

positioned on this stream.  The cyanidation process begins in the second tank, via the addition of 

sodium cyanide (NaCN) solution, and continues through the sixth tank.  

 

Hydrated lime and sodium cyanide solution addition is also predicted for the other tanks in order 

to fine tune the pH and the cyanide concentration. 

 

Since the process consumes oxygen at a large scale, compressed air will be injected in all the 

tanks of the cyanidation circuit (including pre-lime tank) through their lateral side near the 

bottom at a total calculated rate of 3,000 Scfm (0.375 m3 of air / live m3 of pre-lime and leaching 

tanks).  From the last tank, the leached pulp is pumped to the multi-feeder of the Kemix 

Pumpcell® circuit.  The residence time of the pulp in the cyanidation process is approximately 48 



 

206 
 

hours for the flotation concentrate and 16 hours for saprolite feed, in addition to about a 14-hour 

flotation concentrate pre-lime period. All inter-tank pre-lime and leaching transfer will be by 

gravity.  In the Kemix Pumpcell®  all tanks are at the same elevation; therefore, the inter-tank 

pulp transfer will be performed by pumping after passing though the rotating circular screen. 

 

The chemical equation (Elsner Equation) that represents the unit operation of leaching (via 

cyanidation) is:  

 

4 Au (s) + 8 (CN)- (aq) + O2 (aq) + 2 H2O = 4 [Au(CN)2]- (aq) + 4 (OH)- (aq). 

 

It is thus a selective dissolution reaction, via gold complexification by cyanide ions in a highly 

ionizable salt, in a high pH range (10 to 11) aerated cyanide solution. 

 

The three critical factors that affect cyanidation are: 

 

The concentration of the cyanide ions is generally in the range of 0.03% to 0.15%.  The ideal 

value has to be determined in situ by hydrometallurgical tests, depending on the gold's 

dissolution kinetics.  The NaCN consumption will be around 130 g/t of total mill feed [(600 g/t * 

4,500,000 tpy * 0.18 + 350 g/t * 500,000 tpy) / 5,000,000 tpy]. 

 

The optimum pH value (in the range 10 to 11) will be determined by in situ hydrometallurgical 

tests.  An appropriate pH is mandatory to guarantee the stability of the cyanide ions.  Relatively 

low pH values favor the formation of HCN (hydrocyanic acid), a very volatile substance that is 

fatal if inhaled. The Ca(OH)2 consumption is expected to be around 690 g/t of total mill feed 

[(1,500 g/t * 4,500,000 tpy * 0.18 + 4,500 g/t * 500,000 tpy) / 5,000,000 tpy].  Higher pH values 

favor less cyanide consumption, but can reduce the gold's dissolution kinetics. 

 

An appropriate supply of oxygen: gold becomes salt-complexed in the presence of cyanide ions 

only when dissolved oxygen is also present.  The maximum expected consumption of 

compressed air per cubic meter of pulp is: 0.375 Nm3/hr per cubic meter of tank, design factor 



 

207 
 

included.  Hence, the cyanidation tank train call for (6 tanks) * (2,250 m3/tank) * [(0.375 m3 / h 

air) / (live m3 of tanked pulp)] = 5,060 m3 / h = ~3,000 Scfm.  

 

The expected gold recovery in the cyanidation circuit is 95.0%, according to SGS's tests and 

TechnoMine's interpretation of the results. 

 

21.2.2.8.2 CIP Kemix Pumpcell® - Adsorption Circuit  

 

The leached pulp will be pumped from the last cyanidation tank to the Kemix Pumpcell ® multi-

feeder of the six-tank adsorption train.  The Adsorption Agitators (Kemix Pumpcell®) sizing was 

defined by the supplier based on the kinetic adsorption test results (each tank is estimated to have 

live volume of 100 m3, enough for 2-hours residence time).  

 

A Kemix Pumpcell® CIP provides for adsorption of the gold by the activated carbon (new and 

regenerated) with a size distribution in the range of six (6) to sixteen (16) mesh and an estimated 

pulp concentration of 60-80 g/L.  The gold-bearing pulp is pumped from the first to the last 

adsorption tank after passing through inter-stage 20-mesh rotating-circular screens.  Activated 

carbon (new and regenerated) is added to all the adsorption tanks.  In the Kemix Pumpcell® the 

pulp and carbon are not pumped in countercurrent through the adsorption tanks.  The multi-

feeder can feed all six tanks. When the carbon from the first tank needs to be moved to the 

elution column, the first tank is bypassed and the second tank becomes the first tank receiving 

the feed.  After all the pulp from the first tank is pumped to the carbon screen, this tank becomes 

the last tank in the sequence.  Therefore, this "rotation" enables each tank to take all the positions 

eventually, but sustains the sequence of all the tanks. 

 

Consequently, as the process continues, the pulp that flows from the first to the last adsorption 

tank will become spent since the gold it carries is being adsorbed by the activated carbon.  At the 

same time, the carbon carries more gold as its position changes from the last to the first 

adsorption tank.  Thus, once the adsorption cycle is completed, pulp with the loaded carbon 

approximately 3.4 kg/t (109 troy oz of gold per tonne of loaded carbon) is pumped by a recessed-

impeller pump from the bottom of the operational first adsorption tank to the activated carbon 



 

208 
 

classification screen before undergoing the subsequent operations of elution and electrowinning.  

The screen underflow recycles to the last leaching tank. 

 

The adsorption circuit tailings (154 tph solids at 42% solids) will pass though a 35 mesh carbon 

safety screen.  The oversize (carbon fines loaded with gold) will be stored for further gold 

recovery.  The undersize (pulp) will be detoxified before being pumped (about 4.9 km) to the 

geomembrane-lined TUDO AZUL Tailings Dam.  An appropriately sized pontoon-mounted 

pumping station – sized for a design flow rate of 250 m3/h, will pump the supernatant solution 

back to the plant.  Detoxification tests will be performed by either CyPlus GmbH in Germany or 

AMMTEC in Australia, to establish a technically feasible and cost effective process. 

 

21.2.2.9 Elution and Electrowinning 

 

The pulp with loaded carbon will be pumped from the first adsorption tank by recessed impeller 

pumps and will feed a 30-mesh screen, which undersize is a pulp that will be redirected to the 

last leaching tank.  The oversize makes up the loaded carbon (approximately 3.4 kg of gold per 

tonne of loaded carbon / 8 hours), which after having passed through a storage tank, feeds the 

elution columns.  The six (6) elution columns are predicted to work in groups, three (3) running 

the stripping process and three (3) being loaded.  The estimated carbon load in each column 

(1.25 m in diameter and 6.25 m high) is approximately 3.3 t.  From a heated caustic soda Tank, a 

NaOH solution at 1% concentration (wt) with 400 L of ethylic alcohol (per batch) kept at 95 oC 

is pumped to the elution columns, where gold will be stripped from the activated carbon. The 

caustic solution is injected into the elution columns from the bottom and flows out the top.  After 

elution, the pregnant solution will pass through a stainless steel (316 L) 30 mesh strainer and will 

be transported by gravity from the top of the elution columns to a pregnant solution box, located 

in the "Strong Room".  The overflow from this box will go to the electrowinning system, which 

operates with six (6) cathodes and seven (7) anodes, using a current of 360 A and a voltage of 

3.5 to 4.0 V.  From the electrowinning cells, the solution recycles to the heated caustic soda 

solution tank (following 40-hour cycles).  An exhaust system will remove vapors (water, 

hydrogen, oxygen, and ammonia) from the Electrowinning System.  Another central exhaust 

system will remove the residual vapors from the entire Strong Room. 



 

209 
 

 

The saturated cathodes, made of carbon steel-wool, are removed and acid attacked before been 

melted in an induction furnace.  The bullion bars are sent to be refined into commercial gold 

bars.   

 

The expected gold recovery in the ADR circuit is 99.0%. 

 

21.2.2.10 Acid Washing 

 

The activated carbon first undergoes the stripping process in the elution columns where the 

adsorbed gold will be removed by a NaOH 1% concentration (by weight) alcoholic solution at 95 
oC, as previously stated.  It is then conveyed to a surge tank and conveyed via an ejector to a 14-

m3 fiberglass acid washing column.  Acid washing is necessary to maintain the loading capacity 

of the activated carbon since the mineral matrix possesses other cations such as calcium, iron, 

copper, zinc, lead, etc. that compete with gold in the interstices of the activated carbon.  The acid 

washing is completed by passing an HCl solution at 10% through the acid washing column, 

removing the impurities that diminish the capacity and kinetics of the carbon to adsorb gold, 

which are mainly carbonates and ions from basic metals. 

 

The acid solution of HCl at 10% (by weight) will be prepared in a fiberglass tank by adding 

water and HCl at 33%, by weight.  This solution will be injected by pumping into the bottom, 

and discharging at the top, of the acid washing column.  The overflow will return to the HCl 

solution tank by gravity.  The time involved in the acid washing is approximately five (5) hours.  

 

Once the acid washing is completed, the acid solution will be conveyed towards a neutralization 

pond.  The carbon will be washed and neutralized with a 1% (wt) NaOH solution using a 

procedure identical to the one used for the acid solution.  The neutralization time will range from 

one (1) to two (2) hours, depending on the pH control of the recycled solution.  The remaining 

solution is also drained to the neutralization pond.  Thereafter the carbon will be washed with 

water in an open circuit with regard to the neutralization pond.  This operation lasts 

approximately two (2) hours.  After these stages, the carbon is transferred to the 18-mesh linear 



 

210 
 

vibrating screen to remove carbon fines and can be conveyed either to the thermal regeneration 

process, which is performed in a regenerating kiln, or to the carbon addition circuit via the 

volumetric control vessel, and then to the last adsorption tank in the CIP Kemix Pumpcell® 

circuit. 

 

21.2.2.11 Carbon Regeneration Circuit 

 

The activated carbon will be transferred to a thermal regeneration system, which includes a 

regeneration kiln, after having undergone acid washing and passing the 18-mesh linear vibrating 

screen.  The ensuing thermal regeneration will give rise to volatilization and/or thermal 

decomposition of organic compounds and the pyrolisis of other compounds.  This allows the 

carbon to regain its original pore structure, thus recovering almost all of its original gold 

adsorption capability. 

 

The envisioned carbon regeneration kiln will have a 150 kg/h-carbon regeneration capacity (wet 

basis) and will be able to operate 24 hours a day, having an electrical heating system and rotating 

retort furnace.  The anticipated carbon regeneration residence time will range from 30 minutes to 

40 minutes.  The carbon will be heated gradually until it reaches 600 oC to 700 oC in a slightly 

oxidizing (steam) atmosphere. The carbon (at 250 °C to 350 °C) will be discharged into a water 

tank ("Quench" Tank).  

 

The carbon will then be conveyed through an eductor towards the 18-mesh linear vibrating 

screen, which oversize creates the regenerated carbon stream and is conveyed by gravity to the 

volumetric control vessel and then to the last tank of the CIP Kemix Pumpcell® circuit. 

 

21.2.2.12 Cathode Treatment and Smelter 

 

The cathodes loaded with deposited gold will be periodically removed from the electrowinning 

cells.  They will be acid attacked (HCl or H2SO4), filtered and the gold sludge will be melted in 

an induction furnace, obtaining the bullion bars.  The bullion bars will be sent out in order to be 

refined into commercial gold bars.   



 

211 
 

 

21.2.2.13 Overall Metallurgical Gold Recovery 

 

The adopted overall gravity/flotation/leaching/ADR metallurgical gold recovery for this 

Feasibility is:  

 

R = {[4.5 Mtpy*(0.90) + 0.5 Mtpy] / 5 Mtpy}* (0.95) * (0.99) * (100) = 85.6 %   

 

 Tonalite Ore Feed = 4.5 Mtpy 

 Flotation – Gravity Concentration = 90.0% 

 Saprolite Ore Feed = 0.5 Mtpy 

 Leaching of the reground concentrate = 95.0% 

 ADR (Adsorption, Desorption, Electrowinning) = 99.0% 

 

SGS tests were performed on a representative blend sample from the Project Cipoeiro and Chega 

Tudo Ore Bodies and the scaling was carried out by TechnoMine for P80 = 106 μm.  

 

21.2.2.14 Process Control Philosophy 

 

 General 

 

A process control system will be implemented at regulatory and supervisory levels via a 

conventional PLC system.  It will be based on a process control philosophy compatible to 

harboring an Online Optimizing System (Advanced Control System – "ACS" also referred to as 

Online Optimization System) in the future.  The ACS will entail Expert and AI-based levels, the 

highest objective-function being gold production (throughput and recovery).   

 

PIMS (Plant Information Management System), LIMS (Laboratory Information Management 

System), and MES (Manufacturing Execution System) Corporate Systems are also envisioned to 

be implemented in the future, when appropriate.  Appendix 18 shows the Gurupi Project Control 

Systems Architecture defined for the Project Control Systems from field to corporate levels. 



 

212 
 

 

The Main Control Room will be located close to the hydrometallurgical plant and will have six 

(6) computers: two (2) "servers"; three (3) "client computers"; and one (1) stand alone for the 

energy management system.   

 

One additional control room, for the Primary and Secondary Crushers and for Mine Dewatering 

and Drainage Systems will be installed close to the Crushing Area and will have one client 

computer. 

 

All automation computers will have the following minimum specifications: 

 

 Servers, including:  

 

Processor: 2.0 GHz Quad Core; Video: 800 MHz 

Cache: 2 MB 

Memory: 4 GB 

Hard Drive: 500 GB  

Optical Drive: DVD-RW 

Monitor: 22", LCD  

Keyboard: Brazilian Code ABNT II Space 

Mouse: Optic 

Operational System: Windows Server 

Connections: 04 USB 

 

 Client Computers , including:  

 

Processor: 2.0 GHz Duo Core; Video: 800 MHz 

Cache: 2 MB 

Memory: 3 GB 

Hard Drive: 250 GB  

Optical Drive: DVD-RW 



 

213 
 

Monitor: 22", LCD  

Keyboard: Brazilian Code ABNT II Space 

Mouse: Optic 

Operational System: Windows 7 Professional 

Connections: 04 USB 

 

Fourteen (14) dedicated PLCs will control the ore processing unit operations: the Mine Phreatic 

Surface Lowering System, Mine Drainage System, and the Crushing Plant (1); the HPGR (High 

Pressure Grinding Roll) Circuit (1 – by the supplier); the Saprolite Scrubbing and Classification 

Plant, the Grinding Plant, and the Flotation Feed Thickening Circuit (1); the Regrinding Circuit, 

Reground Concentrate Thickening, Flotation-Gravity Rejects Thickening, and Flotation Circuits 

(1); the Gravity Concentration Circuit (2 - by the supplier); the Hydrometallurgical Plant (1); the 

Elution Plant, the Electrowinning Plant, the Acid Wash Plant, and the Utilities Circuits (1); the 

Carbon Regeneration Plant (1 – by the supplier); the Smelting Plant (1 – by the supplier); the 

Electrical System (1); and the Water System (3), respectively.   

 

The electrical equipment control will be performed by smart MCCs (Motor Control Center) 

using all the resources yielded by smart relays, frequency drives and soft starters connected by a 

DEVICENET network.  In this way, via the control room operating station, one can have real 

time monitoring of many equipment parameters (voltage, current, status).  This makes it possible 

to know the actual situation of each piece of equipment in order to prevent downtime caused by 

equipment stops. 

 

The plant process control will be performed through various instruments, such as, density meters, 

flowmeters, thermometers, pressure gauges, control valves and others. These instruments will be 

connected through PROFIBUS networks to the PLCs and the control room operating station, 

where one can monitor, supervise and optimize all process variables. 

 

The automation system has two redundant servers to prevent downtime due to failure of one of 

the servers.  In case of server failure, the extra server will continue to work without any loss in 



 

214 
 

the production process.  These servers are connected to the corporate network, which will 

provide process information to other management systems that can be installed in future. 

 

The engineering room will be attached to the plant control room.  From the engineering room, 

process and operation supervisors can monitor and optimize the process without interference 

from the control room operator. 

 

A MMI (Man Machine Interface) is also envisioned to serve each of the aforementioned process 

areas.  Communication with the control system will be established via an OPC (OLE - Object 

Linking and Embedding - for Process Control) or data interface over the Ethernet.  

Communication with the future PIMS, LIMS, and MES will be established via an ODBC (Open 

Database Connectivity) data interface over the Ethernet.  

 

A review of the main process control features is presented below and is intended to represent the 

Project's plant process control philosophy. 

 

 Crushing and Screening Plant 

 

The product of the primary crusher will be conveyed to the primary 2-deck banana screen.  An 

integrating scale will be placed at the conveyor belt that transports the product of the primary 

crusher and scalping (80% minus 150 mm) to the primary screens.  

 

A magnetic extractor and a metal detector will be installed, in this sequence before the secondary 

crushers' hopper, over the conveyor belt that transports the oversize of the primary 2-deck 

banana screens.  This hopper will have level sensors (low and high) to control the feed rate of 

primary crusher.  Furthermore, cameras will be installed in the primary crusher area, primary 

screen area, and secondary crushers' area. 

 

Each of the two (2) secondary cone crushers will be fed via a variable speed vibrating feeder. 

 



 

215 
 

The undersize of the primary screen (crushing product – 80% minus 25 mm) will be stockpiled.  

Under this pile, four (4) variable speed belt feeders will be installed to feed the HPGR hopper 

facility. 

 

 HPGR and Screening Plant 

 

The product of the crushing plant will be stockpiled in a surge pile facility.  Under this pile, four 

(4) variable speed belt feeders will be installed to feed the HPGR hopper facility.  A magnetic 

extractor and a metal detector will be installed (in this sequence) over the conveyor belt that 

transports the feed to the HPGR hopper facility. 

 

The HPGR hopper facility will have a level sensor (low and high) to control the speed of the belt 

feeders installed under the stockpile. 

 

The HPGR will be fed via a variable speed belt feeder, which is fed by the HPGR hopper 

facility.  An integrating scale will be placed on the conveyor belt that transports the feed to the 

HPGR.  

 

The HPGR discharge will feed the high-frequency secondary wet screen, whose undersize (P80 

minus 1.9 mm – 45% solids wt) is the HPGR product.  The sump that will feed the grinding mills 

discharge sump will have VS pumps: One (1) in operation and one (1) in standby.  The pumped 

feed stream to the grinding mills discharge sump will have a flowmeter and a densimeter to 

control the feed mass flow rate.  

 

 Grinding and Cycloning Plant 

 

From the HPGR plant sump, the pulp (P80 minus 1.9 mm – 45% solids wt) will feed the grinding 

mills discharge sump.  The sump that feeds the cyclones cluster will have VS pumps: One (1) in 

operation and one (1) in standby.  The feed stream to the cyclones cluster will have a flowmeter 

and a densimeter to control the cyclones performance via feed mass flow rate.  

 



 

216 
 

The required slurry density will be achieved via water addition to the grinding mills sump, 

through a variable-flow-rate valve, whose opening will be determined as a function of the 

"reading" (signal) of the cyclones feed stream densimeter.  

 

A Particle Size Analyzer (PSA) will be positioned in the cyclones cluster overflow stream for 

online measurement of milled material size (P80 control).  The PSA will supply online data for 

the grinding and classification plant control system.  

 

 Flotation Thickener 

 

The cyclones overflow of the grinding circuit will feed a Flocculant-Added-High-Capacity 

Thickener (Flotation Thickener), which underflow will feed the Flotation circuit with a 

consistent density of around 40% solids (wt).  The recovery and transfer of the underflow pulp 

from the thickener to the flotation circuit will be performed by VS pumps: One (1) in operation 

and one (1) in standby.  The control system, based on PLC-determined mass flow rate, will 

dictate the speed.  Thus, it is anticipated that a magnetic flowmeter and a densimeter will be 

placed on the Flotation Thickener underflow stream.  An automatic sampler will also be 

positioned on this stream.  The overflow will be recovered to an Industrial Water Tank. 

 

 Flotation Plant  

 

All Tank Cells will be aerated and will have pulp level control.  The pulp will pass through a 

conditioner before the rougher tank cells, where collector and promoter are added.  Frother 

addition will be performed in the outlet stream of the conditioner.  All reagents will be added in 

the other rougher and scavenger tank cells.  Therefore, each reagent addition will be performed 

by a peristaltic pump (See Area 220 PFD – Note 7). The control of dosage will be performed by 

a dedicated PLC according to the grinding-fed mass flow rate. 

  

Automatic samplers will be installed to control the flotation metallurgical recovery: feed, 

reground concentrate, and final rejects streams. 

 



 

217 
 

 Continuous Gravity Separation Plant  

 

The gravity circuit will have its own control system provided by the supplier. 

 

 Regrinding and Cycloning Plant  

 

The flotation concentrate will feed the regrinding circuit sump – a grinding-cycloning reverse 

circuit.  Two (2) VS pumps will be available to feed the cyclones cluster: one (1) in operation 

and one (1) in standby.  The feed stream to the cyclones cluster will have a flowmeter and a 

densimeter in order to control the cyclones performance via feed mass flow rate. 

 

The required slurry density will be achieved via automatic water addition to the sump, through a 

variable-flow-rate valve, whose opening will be determined online as a function of the "reading" 

(signal) of the cyclones feed stream densimeter.  

 

 Thickeners (Concentrate, Rejects, and Reground Concentrate) 

 

The gravity rejects (nominal 443 tph solids at 38% solids - wt) will be pumped to a cycloning 

facility that will split the +325 mesh material (50% of the ROM tonnage delivered to the Plant).  

The cycloning operation overflow (32% of the ROM tonnage delivered to the Plant) will be 

thickened in a Flocculant-Added-High-Capacity Thickener, in order to generate recoverable 

water and to thicken the cyanide-free rejects to a density in excess of 37% solids (wt) - before 

pumping them (joined with the cycloning underflow) to the bare (nonlined) BARRO LIMPO 

Cyanide-free Rejects Dam, located about 1.0 km from the Cycloning Plant (see Appendix 19 – 

Project General Plans).  The total solids mass to be conveyed to the BARRO LIMPO Cyanide-

free Rejects Dam corresponds to 82% of the ROM tonnage delivered to the Plant (Mill Feed) 

corresponding to about 450 m3 of slurry per hour, at a nominal solids density of 60.6% (wt).  A 

magnetic flowmeter and a densimeter will be placed on the Thickener underflow stream.   

 

The cyclones overflow of the regrinding circuit will feed a Conventional Flocculant-Added-

High-Capacity Thickener (Concentrate Thickener), which underflow will feed the leaching 



 

218 
 

circuit, with a consistent density around 45% solids (wt).  The recovery and transfer of the 

underflow pulp from the thickener to the leaching circuit will be performed by VS pumps: One 

(1) in operation and one (1) in standby.  The control system, based on PLC-determined mass 

flow rate, will dictate the speed.  Thus, it is anticipated that a magnetic flowmeter and a 

densimeter will be placed on the Concentrate Thickener underflow stream.  An automatic 

sampler will also be positioned on this stream.  The overflow will be recovered to the Industrial 

Water Tank. 

 

 Saprolite Scrubbing and Screening Plant 

 

A variable speed apron feeder will dictate the feed rate of the scrubber. 

 

The transfer of the saprolite ore pulp from the conditioner to the third leaching tank will be 

performed by VS pumps: One (1) in operation and one (1) in standby.  The control system, based 

on PLC-determined mass flow rate and tank level, will dictate the speed. Thus, it is anticipated 

that a magnetic flowmeter and a densimeter will be placed on this stream.  An automatic sampler 

will also be positioned on this stream. 

 

 Leaching-CIP Circuit 

 

It is foreseen that the leaching circuit will have three (3) pH-meters in addition to one two-

channel online cyanide analyzer and one (1) two-channel online dissolved oxygen analyzer.  The 

cyanide analyzer will send signals to the PLC every four (4) minutes.  The Regulatory Control 

System will be programmed to manipulate variables, such as reagent addition rates, in order to 

stabilize the circuit and consistently yield the best possible gold recovery.  Compressed Air will 

be injected through the lateral side near the bottom of each leaching tank through air-flow-rate 

controlling valves, in order to maintain the online-measured dissolved oxygen at the desired set-

points. 

 

 Cyanide Destruction Plant ("CDP") 

 



 

219 
 

The Cyanide Destruction Plant will have its own control system provided by the supplier.  The 

CDP will treat the tailings pulp from the CIP Plant, which will then be conveyed to the TUDO 

AZUL Tailings Dam.  The supernatant of the TUDO AZUL Tailings Dam will be pumped back 

to the Plant. 

 

21.2.3 Plant Production Plan 
 

The Project LOM will be approximately thirteen (13) years.  It is anticipated that operations will 

start in the first quarter of 2013 with a forecasted production of 4,000,000 t for that year.  In 

2014, the foreseen production is 4,500,000 t of ROM, increasing to 5,000,000 t per year from 

2015 to 2021.  The LOM will be completed with the following production: 5,200,000 t for 2022, 

5,246,650 t for 2023, and 4,900,000 t per year in 2024 and 2025.  The total ROM production of 

ca 63,756,700 t should contain about 2,327,930 oz Au at an average grade of 1.14 g/t. 

 

The estimated Mill Feed grade is 1.10 g/t (MCF = 97%). An estimated Overall Metallurgical 

Recovery of 85.6% ("metallurgical recovery") is expected, based on extensive testwork carried 

out by world-class laboratories and research centers in Canada, Germany (HPGRs viability), 

Australia, and Brazil (See Appendix 03 – Recent Metallurgical and  Environmental Tests 

Reports) and further TechnoMine's interpretations of the reported testwork results. Hence, the 

Project is expected to produce a total salable amount of approximately 1,932,920 oz Au.  This 

corresponds to an average gold output of about 148,690 opy (troy ounces per year) over the 

LOM (13 years).   

 

The ROM will be produced by the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo open pit mines.  The mines will 

produce about 15,000 tpd of ROM in the cruise production.  

 

 Hence, the Project is expected to produce a total salable amount of approximately 

1,932,920 oz Au.  This corresponds to an average gold output of about 148,690 opy (troy 

ounces per year) over the LOM (13 years).   

 



 

220 
 

 The crushing plant will operate 365 days per year, using three 8-hour shifts (3 crews – on 

a 30 effective days/month regime).  The exclusion of peak power consumption hours (3 

hours/day) and crew feed time (1 hour/shift) will lead to 17.28 effective hours/day, 

implying a UF of 84.7% and a GEMAF of 85%: [(24 h/day * (0.847) * (0.85)] = 17.28 

hours/day.  Since the crushing plant will produce 375,000 t/month at 365 days/year 

(12,329 tpd), the crushing plant nominal solids throughput will be about 713.5 tph: 

(12,329 tpd) / (17.28 h/day). A design capacity of 856 tph (solids) has been adopted for 

the crushing plant, corresponding to a design factor of 1.20.   

 

 The grinding plant (HPGR and Vertimills®) will operate 365 days/year, with three (3) 8-

hour shifts per day (four 8-hour shift crews).  The operating regime for the grinding plant 

will contemplate an UF and a GEMAF of 97.5%, equivalent to a yearly 8,322 operational 

hours (0.975 x 0.975 = 95.06% uptime). Therefore, for the tonalite ore grinding plant the 

nominal solids throughput will be about 541 tph (= 4,500,000 t/year / 8,322 h/year).  A 

design capacity of 649 tph (solids) was adopted for this section of the process, 

corresponding to a design factor of 1.20.  

 

 The Flotation, gravity separation, and Regrinding Plants will operate on the same regime 

as the Grinding Plant. 

 

 The leaching and CIP process routes will operate on the same regime as the Grinding 

Plant, starting with a 150-ft diameter high-capacity Concentrate Thickener fed by the 

regrinding circuit-closing cyclones overflow and finishing at the bullion bars shipment.  

 

The adopted value (95%) for the hydrometallurgical plant Operating Efficiency ("OE") - the 

same value adopted for the grinding plant - corresponds to the product of the UF by the GEMAF: 

(0.975)*(0.975) = 95.06%. 

  



 

221 
 

21.2.4 Plant Personnel 
 

The number of operations personnel to be allocated to the Crushing, HPGR, Grinding, Flotation, 

Leaching / CIP / Stripping / EW / Carbon Regeneration, Acid Wash and other process ancillary 

circuits, and Cyanide Destruction plants and to tailings and rejects management has been 

determined based on Jaguar's and TechnoMine's experience in similar projects and is presented 

in Table 21.2.4.1. 

 

The plant operations labor estimate was based on the assumption that the plant control 

philosophy presented in sub-item 21.2.2.14 of the process description section will be fully 

complied with.  The 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. shift is considered the first one and is operated by the 

1st crew.

21.2.6 Process Investment (CAPEX)  

 

The Metallurgical, Cyanide Destruction, Tailings Management, and Effluent Treatment Plants 

total nondiscounted CAPEX has been estimated at US$ 205.3 million.  This figure includes 

preoperational investments (US$ 172.6 million), as shown in the breakdown Table 21.2.6.1.  It is 

worth noting that the Preoperational Process CAPEX corresponds to 62.1 % of the Total Project 

Preoperational CAPEX (US$ 278 million) and that the Total Process CAPEX corresponds to 

59.4% of the Total Estimated Project CAPEX (US$ 345.7 million).

21.2.7 Process Operating Costs (OPEX) 

 
 

The Project's traditional metallurgical route (Leaching + ADR), Detox and Tailings Management 

Plants Total OPEX was estimated at US$ 9.94/t (AMEC's Prefeasibility Study, dated April 13, 

2010.)   

 

The introduction (in this Feasibility) of the Intensive Concentration (flotation and continuous 

discharge gravity separation), High Pressure Grinding Rolls ("HPGR") for tertiary crushing and 

Vertical Mills for grinding and regrinding, and a reduced power cost (230-kV transmission line 

option has been adopted) led to a Total OPEX estimate of US$ 6.70/t at an adopted exchange 

rate of US$ 1.00 = R$ 1.90.  



 

227 
 

 

Table 21.2.7.1 shows a breakdown of the Plants' OPEX estimate which totaled US$ 6.70 per 

processed tonne at a readjusted exchange rate of US$ 1.00 = R$ 1.90.  

 

Power accounts for as much as 33.4% of this cost, while grinding media accounts for about 

22.6%, chemical & reagents consumption corresponds to 14.2%, maintenance for 6.6%, and 

operations personnel for about 3.7%.

21.3    OPERATION SUPPORT FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS AND ANCILLARY BUILDINGS  
 
21.3.1 Operation Support Facilities 
 
21.3.1.1 Maintenance Shop and Warehouse 
 
The Project contemplates the construction of a single central building to be used for all 

mechanical and electrical maintenance needed by the Plant and Open Pit Mines.  It will be 

located near the industrial area, in a strategic position with regard to the mines, thus facilitating 

logistic operations.  

 

The building will be built in mixed structure: steel structure for maintenance shop and warehouse 

and concrete masonry for offices.   

 

The Warehouse and offices for maintenance, supplies and warehouse administrative personnel 

will be constructed right next to the Maintenance Shop building.  Interconnecting these units 

aims at facilitating interaction between plant's operation and maintenance units.

21.3.1.2  Water and Wastewater Systems  
 
21.3.1.2.1  Gurupi River Water Suction Station 
 
Raw water suction for the Project will be placed on the Gurupi River - which is the border 

between the states of Maranhão and Pará in that area -  about 14 km from the Plant.  The 

estimated captured water flow is 300 m3/h. 

 

The installation of a water pumping system is envisioned to pump water to a lift station located 

near river bank. From this station the water will be pumped to a reservoir built in a region near 

the Plant with an adequate elevation to efficiently distribute water by gravity (Water Industrial 

Tank).  

 

An automated control system will allow for monitoring, interlock, and remote operation from the 

Plant's main control room.  The control architecture envisioned, will afford the pumps in the lift 

station to respond automatically to level changes in the raw water tank, in addition to operator 

commands. 

 

21.3.1.2.2   Water Treatment Plant and Drinking Water Distribution System 
 
Drinking water will be obtained from a Water Treatment Plant (WTP).  All required treatment 

stages will be considered such as coagulation, flocculation, sediment removal, disinfection, 

fluoridation and pH correction. 

 



 

231 
 

The Water Treatment Plant will be fed by the raw water tank.  A Water Storage Tank will store 

the drinking water.  From this tank water will be distributed to smaller water containers located 

near the Ancillary Buildings. 

 

21.3.1.2.3   Sewage Treatment System 
 
A Sewage Treatment System (STS) will be implemented to treat residual water or sanitary 

sewage coming from the Ancillary Buildings, so that they can be later discharged into the 

environment, in compliance with the standards required by current legislation. 

 

All required treatment stages will be installed. 

 

21.3.1.2.4  Tailings and Rejects Dams and Water Recovery Suction Stations  
 
Supernatant water from the TUDO AZUL cyanide-bearing tailings dam, the BARRO LIMPO 

cyanide-free rejects dam and the POÇÃO rejects disposal facility will be recovered for the 

industrial process. Each facility will have a pumping system to pump water to the Industrial 

Water Tank, from where it will be distributed through the Plant. 

 

The recovery of 300 m3/h of water is envisioned for the TUDO AZUL cyanide dam. The 

pontoon-mounted pump at this dam will be located about 6.5 km away from the Industrial Water 

Tank.  

 

The recovery of 200 m3/h of water is envisioned for the BARRO LIMPO cyanide-free dam.  The 

pontoon-mounted pump at this dam will be located about 4.0 km away from the Industrial Water 

Tank.  

 

The recovery of 200 m3/h of water is envisioned for the POÇÃO cyanide-free rejects disposal 

facility (exhausted Cipoeiro Pit).  The pontoon-mounted pump at this dam will be located about 

1.7 km away from the Industrial Water Tank.  

 



 

232 
 

The control system envisioned for the suction pumps will allow for monitoring, interlock and 

remote operation from the plant's control room.

execution and later on, the Warehouse and operations. It will be built near the Maintenance 

Shop-Warehouse complex. 

 

21.3.2  Ancillary Buildings 
 

The Ancillary Buildings have been located in the industrial area, in a strategic position, in order 

to facilitate, reduce and control vehicle traffic and human circulation. 

 

Every access to the unit will be controlled and monitored by the Main Gate House, built near the 

ancillary buildings. This will aid employees and suppliers to their desired destination and prevent 

unneeded human circulation in production areas, thus reducing the risk of accidents.

21.4 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 

21.4.1 Environmental Permits, Including Operation License Requirements in Brazil 

 

A Mining Company - as defined by the Brazilian Mining Law - that intends to implement a 

mining project in Brazil must first apply for the environmental permit known as the Previous 

License ("LP").  Typically, LP applications are submitted during the Feasibility Study stage.   

 

In order to be awarded an LP, the project owner or operator ("Owner"; "Operator"; "Company") 

must complete the appropriate application and submit an Environmental Impact Study ("EIA") 

and an Environmental Impact Report ("RIMA") that are prepared using guidelines established by 

CONSEMA – Maranhão State Council for  the Environment.   All pertinent information about 

the project must be disclosed in the application, including project ownership, deforestation, and 

water usage.  Licenses are reviewed by the Secretariat for Environmental and Natural Resources 

of the state of Maranhão ("SEMA") or by the Regional Offices for the Environment 

("DREMAs").   

 

The EIA and RIMA will be reviewed and analyzed by either SEMA or DREMAs.  In some 



 

239 
 

cases, when the area has already been impacted or the soil has already been modified, 

environmental authorities can allow submittal of only an Environmental Control Report 

("RCA"). 

 

After analyses by SEMA or DREMAs and after a public hearing takes place, a decision will be 

made regarding the granting of the LP.  Once the LP has been secured, the Company will apply 

for the Implementation License ("LI").  The LI will sanction the completion of important works 

in the project area, such as the erection of the mineral processing plant, construction of rejects 

and tailings dams and other disposal facilities, access roads construction, development of 

underground, surface, and/or open pit mines, installation of the infrastructure, preparation of 

waste dump areas, etc.  Typically, LI applications are submitted during the detailed engineering 

phase.  Its award is mandatory for construction and field erection purposes.   

 

As required in the LI application form, the Company must submit an Environmental Control 

Plan ("PCA"), which addresses control issues and plans to minimize the potential impacts caused 

by the project.  The LI application and the PCA are also reviewed and analyzed by either SEMA 

or DREMAs; however, SEMA is the authority that grants the LI.  

 

After the implementation of the aforementioned project works, and, provided all environmental 

requirements are met, the Company will apply for the Operation License ("LO").  

  

21.4.2 Environmental Plans and Studies Review  
 

Applications for mining concessions are required to include an environmental plan that must 

address water treatment, soil erosion, air quality control, revegetation, reforestation (where 

necessary), and restoration.   

 

During the environmental licensing process, it is necessary to present studies that address an 

environmental assessment, predicted impacts that may occur during the implementation and the 

operation of the mining project, as well as mitigative and compensational measures for the 



 

240 
 

referred impacts.  In addition, the studies must address the necessary actions for the rehabilitation 

of degraded areas, mine closure, etc. 

 

During the LP process, the EIA/RIMA or the RCA must be presented depending on the extent of 

predicted modification to the project area.   These studies rely on environmental experts to assess 

the environmental feasibility of the project. Additionally, these expert studies present the 

environmental diagnosis of the area, considering physical, biological, and anthropological 

ecosystems, as well as the predicted impacts and their mitigative and compensational measures. 

 

The PCA is submitted during the LI phase.  It contains detailed designs and project plans related 

to environmental control and compensational measures.  In addition, the Degraded Areas 

Recovery Plan ("PRAD") is presented.  The PRAD essentially addresses the post-project 

topographic contour design, drainage control, and future utilization of the area.  During this 

phase, reports detailing compliance with the requirements imposed during the LP process must 

be presented.  

 

During the phase of obtaining the LO, verification is carried out for compliance of all projects 

proposed in the PCA, along with compliance of compensational measures and requirements 

imposed by the previous licensing stages.  The LO is valid for a minimum of four (4) years and a 

maximum of eight (8) years.  The Company must renew the LO upon its expiration.  Submittal 

of an Environmental Performance Assessment Report ("RADA") is required.  This report is 

analyzed from legal and technical standpoints before the LO renewal can be granted. 

 

It is worth noting that the environmental licensing process is dynamic and can be reviewed or 

reassessed during the validity term of the licenses, provided that supporting technical reasons for 

modifications exist and that proposed changes do not aggravate the environmental conditions of 

the subject area.  

 

  



 

241 
 

21.4.3 Mining Concessions and Exploration Permits Review: Interfaces with 

Environmental Permitting 

 

In Brazil, mining activity requires an agreement with landowner(s) and granting of mining 

concessions from the DNPM, an agency of the Brazilian federal government responsible for 

controlling and enforcing the Brazilian Mining Law.  DNPM permits essentially consist of 

exploration awards, exploration licenses or permits, and mining concessions, which are 

henceforth referred to in the text under their original terms or the general term "permits".  It is 

worth noting that the English term "exploration" is translated as "pesquisa mineral" in 

Portuguese, which concept entails both "prospecting" ("prospeção") and "mineralized body 

technical and economic evaluation" ("exploração").  Typically, the area covered by concessions 

is up to 10,000 ha for the Amazon region and 2,000 ha for the rest of the country.  However, they 

may be smaller, depending on the region where the concession is situated. 

 

An application for prospecting/exploration must be supported by a location map, exploration 

plan, justification report, and must comply with certain other requirements.  All documentation 

must be prepared by or under the supervision of an authorized professional such as a professional 

geologist or mining engineer.   

 

The DNPM would normally grant a permit on a date / time of application precedence, provided 

the area of interest is not already covered by a pre-existing application or exploration permit, and 

that all the requirements are met.  Applications are sequentially numbered and dated upon filing 

with the DNPM; however, this is neither a rule nor a regulation any longer.  Applications for 

exploration permits in important areas are treated as technical bids.  Fundamentally, the holder of 

an exploration permit must carry out the work necessary to determine the existence and extent of 

a mineral deposit and to assess its exploitability (or mineability) in economic and technical 

terms.  This work must be carried out within the geographical area covered by the exploration 

permit, pursuant to an exploration plan that the applicant must present to the authorities upon 

filing the application for the exploration permit. A properly filed and stamped application for an 

exploration permit establishes the presumption that the applicant has a priority over the area 

covered by the application for the time period in which the application is subject to review by the 



 

242 
 

authorities.  However, as previously reported herein, applications for exploration permits in 

important areas and/or projects are treated as technical bids. 

 

Exploration permits are granted for a period of two (2) or three (3) years, which may be extended 

for an additional period - usually for an additional two (2) or three (3) years, upon application to 

the DNPM and presentation of technical justifications.  Exploration work must begin within 60 

days of the issuance of the permit and must not be suspended for more than three (3) consecutive 

months or 120 non-consecutive days.  The DNPM does not have the legal power to terminate the 

license, unless obligations are not fulfilled during the implementation of the exploration plan or 

legal requirements are not met.   

 

It is the DNPM's responsibility to supervise all mineral (exploration/mining) activities in Brazil, 

but above all, the DNPM is interested in encouraging mining development in the country.  A 

permit that is terminated may be reapplied for.  The DNPM must also be advised of any changes 

to exploration plans, including the interruption of work.  Upon completion of exploration, a final 

report must also be filed stating geological findings and an assessment of the economic 

feasibility of the area.  The DNPM has the right to inspect the area to validate the report before 

accepting it.  New licenses will not be issued if a final exploration report is not filed. 

 

Upon completion of the exploration work, the holder of the exploration permit must produce a 

Final Exploration Report and a Mining Plan (in essence, the two reports may be seen as a 

Feasibility Study) for review by the authorities.  Mining Concessions may only be obtained by 

corporations that qualify as Mining Companies under Brazilian law.  A Mining Company 

normally has one (1) year from receipt of DNPM's approval of the exploration report to apply 

for the mining concession for the intended area.  The application must include a mining plan and 

an economic feasibility analysis, which in either case may be prepared by the applicant, under 

the supervision of in-good-standing Board-registered professional geologists and mining 

engineers.  The DNPM may request any additional information deemed necessary.  

 

If the Final Exploration Report and Mining Plan Report are approved, and there are no reasons of 

public interest dictating otherwise, and provided the Company presents to the DNPM the proper 



 

243 
 

LI, the authorities will award a Mining Concession consistent with the Final Exploration Report 

and Mining Plan.  After the concession is published in the Brazilian Official Gazette ("DOU"), 

the mining company has 90 days to request the physical possession of the mineral lode or deposit 

to be mined ("Imissão de Posse") and six (6) months to start the preparatory work foreseen in the 

Mining Plan.  This term can be extended for another six (6) months, once or more times, 

provided there are reasons, such as market restrictions, Acts of God, etc. that justify such 

extensions.  Once mining has started, it may not be interrupted for any period longer than six (6) 

consecutive months, unless for the reasons cited above; otherwise, the concession may be 

revoked.   

 

The mining company is also required to file detailed operations statistical reports annually with 

the DNPM on the mine's (or mines') production and performance.  Mining concessions are not 

limited in time and will remain valid until full depletion of the mineral(s) of interest in the mine. 

Mining concessions can be transferred between parties qualified to hold them.  The Brazilian 

Federal Constitution states that a transfer of a mining concession requires authorization from the 

pertinent governmental authorities.  Once a mining concession is granted, the mining company is 

required to obtain an LO issued by the environmental agency for each future operating mine.  

The operating permit is renewed every four (4) to eight (8) years, depending on the complexity 

of the project, at the discretion of the environmental agency.  Mining operations may not start 

prior to the issuance of the LO grant.  

 

As previously stated herein, the obligations to retain any mining property include the preparation 

and submittal, to the DNPM, of a detailed Annual Operations Report.  In addition, the mine and 

processing plant must be operated as per the approved operations plan and per the generally 

accepted good engineering practice standards.  Furthermore, operations must comply with safety 

and environmental legislation.  The expiration date of claims, licenses, and other tenure rights, 

according to the Brazilian Mining Law, coincide with the termination of the mining operations 

and legally required post-operational activities (e.g., mine closure), provided all Annual Reports 

have been approved by the DNPM. 

 



 

244 
 

The mineral rights are distinct from the surface ownership and rights.  The property's surface 

rights (including ownership) generally belong to a third party ("Mineral Property Landowner"). 

In the case of gold mining operations, if acquisition is not negotiable, the Mineral Property 

Landowner is entitled to a rent and royalty of 0.5% on net revenue due monthly during the 

project's life, starting with the first gold sale. 

 

During exploration, the landowner also has the right to receive compensation for occupation and 

indemnity for surface usage.  If there is a contested agreement between the parties in regards to 

surface occupation and usage during exploration, the county court will assign an expert to 

evaluate damages and determine the amount of the indemnity.  The maximum amount of 

indemnity cannot exceed the market value of the used surface area. 

 

21.4.4 Past and Current Permitting Situation 

 

21.4.4.1 Mining Permits 

 

As shown in Table 21.4.4.1.1, the Gurupi Project comprises 32 mineral properties.  This 

Feasibility relates to only two (2) of these mineral properties: DNPM 800.180/1990 (Cipoeiro) 

and DNPM 800.090/1985 (Chega Tudo).  The remaining mineral properties represent potential 

upside to the Project.   

 

The mineral properties mentioned above that cover the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo deposits are in 

good standing.  Jaguar has submitted applications to receive the Mining Concessions, which the 

Company expects to receive in October 2011. 

 

Table 21.4.4.1.1 below provides the status of all mineral properties.

21.4.4.2 Environmental Permits 
 

The filing of the EIA / RIMA at SEMA in November 2010 was a mandatory step towards granting of 

the LP.  According to Maranhão state law, The LP for the Project is expected to be granted to MCT 

within 90 days of filing.  However, SEMA decides about the environmental license only after public 

hearings take place.  Public hearings are expected to take place mid-February 2011.  The purpose of the 

public hearings is to supply information about the Project and its possible environmental impacts, as 

well as allow discussion and public debate about the RIMA and the EIA.  The EIA and RIMA have been 

prepared by Brandt Meio Ambiente Ltda. ("Brandt"), a local environmental consulting company with an 

international reputation.  Brandt has 22 years of experience with environmental projects and studies in 

Brazil and other countries, prominently in Africa.  Brandt has a highly-skilled multidisciplinary team, 

which allows for development of projects with quality and efficiency.  The ISO 9001:2008 certification, 

which Brandt holds, reflects a modern management system and certification to international standards of 

quality. 

 

After the LP is granted, Jaguar will start the process to obtain the LI, which requires the filing of a PCA 

to comply with the requirements of the CONAMA Resolution.  The Company expects to apply for the 

LI by March 2011 and receive it by July 2011.  

 

After receiving the LI, Project implementation may begin.  Start of operations will require the grant of 

an LO.  To apply for the LO, the Company is required to comply with the environmental conditions set 

forth in the LI.  It also needs to present a consolidated technical report containing a closure plan for the 

Project, including mitigation measures and a production schedule.  The Company expects to apply for 

the LO by August 2012 and receive it by October 2012.  

 

21.4.5 Environmental Aspects 
 

The Project will use an area of approximately 1,167 ha (ADA- area directly affected) and will comprise 

the following units: 

 

 Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo Open Pits; 



 

257 
 

 Crushing, grinding, flotation, gravity separation, and a hydrometallurgical plant – CIP- ADR – 

process; 

 Saprolite Waste Pile; 

 Tonalite Waste Pile; 

 TUDO AZUL Cyanide Tailings Dam; 

 BARRO LIMPO and POÇÃO Cyanide-free Rejects Dam and Disposal Facilities; 

 Water Supply System; 

 Access and Internal Roads; 

 Ancillary buildings: maintenance shop, offices, change house, cafeteria, etc. 

(See Section 21.3 – Infrastructure and Ancillary Buildings). 

 

The most important environmental-related aspects of the Project are summarized below. 

 

The Chega Tudo and Cipoeiro Ore Bodies will be mined using the open pit mining method. Benches are 

designed to have a slightly inclined (1.0%) berm, to allow drainage of storm and ground water.  While 

mine work is being performed on the benches, drainage water will be directed to sumps that will be 

installed at the pit bottom, where it will accumulate allowing for settling of fines.  Whenever required, 

the accumulated water will be pumped from the bottom of the pit to the retention sumps located on the 

surface. 

 

Mine waste will be disposed in Tonalite and Saprolite waste stockpiles.  After exhaustion of the waste 

stockpiles capacity, the waste will be disposed at the, then exhausted, Cipoeiro Pit.  

 

The area where the open pits are located belongs to the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian 

Reform ("INCRA").  The Company has submitted a request to INCRA for approval of the resettlement 

of the area's inhabitants.  The Company expects to receive approval at the end of January 2011.  

Negotiations with landowners and settlers will then commence.  A relocation project study has been 

completed and is included in the Project implementation schedule.  

 

The tailings containing cyanide-bearing detoxified pulp will be disposed in the TUDO AZUL Tailings 

Dam.  Cyanide-free rejects will be disposed in the BARRO LIMPO and POÇÃO Cyanide-free Rejects 



 

258 
 

Dam and Disposal Facilities.  During the operation of the Cipoeiro Open Pit Mine, the cyanide-free 

rejects will be disposed in BARRO LIMPO.  The Cipoeiro exhausted open pit (POÇÃO) will be used to 

dispose the cyanide-free rejects from the Chega Tudo Mine. 

 

• Cyanide-free Rejects Dams (BARRO LIMPO and POÇÃO) 

 

The cyanide-free Cipoeiro Mine ore rejects (Project's Concentration Plant rejects – corresponding to 

82% of the tonalite ore mill feed solids mass) will be disposed in a Cyanide-free Rejects Dam (BARRO 

LIMPO).  This dam will have an initial capacity of 3.9 Mm³ (110 m elevation – 2 m free board) and a 

water surface area of 1.3 Mm2.  This dam will be expanded in successive lifts to afford the total 

accumulation of approximately 25.0 Mm³ (120.1 m elevation, included a 2-m free board), which is 

enough to accommodate the 9.1 years of Cipoeiro Mine operation: [(41.2 Mt x 0.82) / 1.36 t/m3] = 24.8 

Mm3.  The estimated final water surface area is 2.3 Mm2.  The Chega Tudo Mine ore cyanide-free 

Concentration Plant rejects will be disposed in the exhausted Cipoeiro open pit (POÇÃO Cyanide-free 

Rejects Facility), which will have a live volume of 82.6 Mm3.  This volume is sufficient to 

accommodate the cyanide-free rejects to be produced by the Concentration Plant (Flotation and Gravity 

Separation) over the remaining years of the Project's life (3.9 years out of 13 years):  

 

{[(57.4 Mt – 42.1 Mt) x 0.82] / 1.36 t/m3} = 9.2 Mm3. 

 

The cyanide-free rejects pulp will be conveyed to a thickening plant, which consists of cyclones and a 

thickener.  The cyclones' underflow stream, with approximately 72% (wt) solids, corresponds to about 

66% of the Project's tonalite ore mill feed solids mass.  The cyclones overflow stream, containing highly 

water-diluted fine solid particles (16% of the tonalite ore mill feed solids mass) will be conveyed to a 

High Capacity Conventional Thickener for water recovery.  The thickened underflow stream – in excess 

of 37% solids (wt) – will join the cyclones' underflow stream.  The resulting stream - corresponding to 

82% of the Project's tonalite ore mill feed solids mass and averaging 60.6 % solids (wt) - will be 

pumped to the cyanide-free BARRO LIMPO Rejects Dam (Cipoeiro Mine ore rejects) and to the 

POÇÃO Rejects Disposal Facility (Chega Tudo Mine ore rejects).  Properly sized pontoon-mounted 

pumping stations will pump the supernatant water from BARRO LIMPO and POÇÃO back to the 

Project's plant. 



 

259 
 

 

• Cyanide Tailings Dam (TUDO AZUL) 

 

The Leaching Circuit cyanide-tailings (corresponding to 18% of the tonalite ore mill feed plus 100% of 

the saprolite mill feed solids mass) will be disposed in a 2.5-mm thick geomembrane-lined dam (TUDO 

AZUL Tailings Dam).  This dam will have an initial capacity of 2.0 Mm³ (108 m elevation, included a 

2-m free board) and a water surface area of 0.36 Mm2.  TUDO AZUL will be expanded in successive 

lifts to afford the total accumulation of approximately 13.4 Mm³ (125 m elevation, included a 2-m free 

board), which is enough to accommodate the entirety of the Project's cyanide rejects, over its 13-year 

LOM: {[(57.4 Mt x 0.18) + 6.4 Mt] / 1.25 t/m3} = 13.4 Mm3.  The estimated final water surface area is 

879,000 m2. 

 

The undersize of the carbon safety screen (cyanide pulp tailings) will be treated in a Cyanide 

Destruction Plant ("DETOX Plant") before being pumped to the TUDO AZUL Tailings Dam. Properly 

sized pontoon-mounted pumping stations will pump the supernatant water back to the plant.  

 

Detoxification (cyanide species destruction) tests will be performed by CyPlus in Germany and/or by 

AMMTEC in Australia, aiming at establishing the most effective process route. Typically, hydrogen 

peroxide (H2O2), Sodium Bisulfite (NaHSO3), and Caro's Acid (H2SO5) are used as and tested for 

cyanide oxidants. 

For the implementation phase of the Gurupi Project, water from existing deep wells in the Cipoeiro area 

will be used.  However, with the progress of studies and Project activities, the installation of new wells 

to meet the demand for supplementary water may be required.  Electrical power will be supplied by a 

230-kV transmission line, which is currently in the licensing stage.  The use of generators installed near 

the village of Cipoeiro is planned during the first few months of implantation. 

During operations, water will be available through a Suction Station at the Gurupi River, which is 

currently under study, to check for the required water flow rate availability and viability. Electrical 

power will be supplied by tying the anticipated 230-kV transmission line  from the Encruzo Substation 

to the Project Main Substation, located about 40 km away. 



 

260 
 

At the peak of construction, the expected labor pool will be approximately 750 workers, including both 

MCT employees and contractors.  

 

21.4.6 Closure Plan   

 

The Gurupi Project will require a special treatment after the completion of mining activities. 

 

Part of the pits will receive waste material.  Exposed banks and the verges must be revegetated with 

grasses initially and then with native trees.  The waste piles will receive the same treatments. 

 

Part of the plant and the infrastructure will be demobilized, the buildings removed and the area will be 

revegetated with grasses initially, and after one (1) or two (2) years, will be revegetated with trees. 

 

The water monitoring operation of the areas, where earthworks and drainage systems were implemented, 

will continue for five (5) years after closure, at which time all the structures are anticipated to be fully 

stabilized. 

 

Revegetation of the areas will be conducted during the rainy season and grasses will be planted during 

the first year.  One (1) or two (2) years later and depending on the stabilization of the area, tree species 

will be planted.  Additionally, monitoring of revegetation will be performed for five (5) years after 

closure.  At that point, it will be determined if transplanting and replanting is necessary. 

 

It is important to note that revegetation will be conducted as the areas are released during operation of 

the Project.  These areas include the banks below, the waste dump, the upper slopes of the pit, and 

others. 

 

Specialized studies and projects will be required for closure of the tailings and rejects dams. These 

projects will be implemented gradually over the life of the dams, contemplating the final configuration 

of the dam and environmental agreements that will occur during the life of the mine. 

 



 

261 
 

Closure of the dams was considered during the design process.  Therefore, a minimum number of tasks 

will remain at the end of the life of the mine to safely disable the waste disposal system. 

 

The geometry of the dam, filters and drainage systems, and protection of upstream and downstream 

slopes were considered as control parameters to ensure protection against possible landslides at the end 

of the useful life of the dam. 

 

Seepage and stability analysis studies show that the dams are safe in the long term.  During the 

operation, monitoring systems and safety inspections will indicate if mitigative measures are needed or 

not for the tailings and rejects disposal systems.  These inspections will be performed in such a way that 

the minimum safety conditions, in connection to the closure of this structure, are guaranteed. 

 

The plans for closure should include the following steps: 

 

• The complete drainage of water within the reservoir.  To complete the draining of water within 

the reservoir, the geometry of the reservoir should be set by lowering the crest of the spillway so 

that it will be transformed into a large drainage channel with sufficient flow capacity to prevent 

the future formation of a lake. 

• A conventional earth dam, as described on Golder Associates Report RT-049-5134-1410-0006-

00-B of February 2005 (See Appendix 03 – Recent Metallurgical and Environmental Testwork)  

will be adopted.  The dam will use saprolite soil in the Project area, both within the reservoir area 

that will be utilized for starter dam construction, and as waste, from the Cipoeiro pit. It will be 

used to raise the dam to its final configuration. Revegetation of the dam's areas will be 

performed with top soil stored during the pre-stripping of the mine.  

• The Golder report, mentioned above, states: "In conclusion, the dam foundation will be on 

residual soil of good strength and low permeability compatible with the dam design." 

Nevertheless, for safety against environmental risks, the cyanide tailings dam will be lined with a 

2.5 mm thick geomembrane.  The appropriate conditions will be evaluated during the Project's 

detailed engineering phase.

21.4.8 Socioeconomic Considerations  

 

Jaguar put together a group of expert professionals to carry out the Socioeconomic Evaluation. The 

Evaluation took place between January 2010 and June 2010 and entailed a well-planned Field Survey, 

which was conducted by a team of in-house professionals during the April-May 2010 period.   

 

The team responsible for the Socioeconomic Evaluation and interpretation was composed of five people, 

two (2) of which are experts in this field: Marcos Welby Muniz de Souza (Secretary of Industry and 

Commerce of Maranhão) and Geraldo Barbosa (Professional Lawyer at Terra, Chaves, Souza e Barbosa 

Advogados Ltda. law firm).  The team was led by Nivio Lasmar, Jaguar's Manager of Sustainable 



 

263 
 

Development, who is the professional in charge of –the Socioeconomic Evaluation Final Report 

presented in Appendix 22 to this Feasibility.  

 

The professionals in charge of the Socioeconomic Evaluation, including the Field Survey, and their 

respective duties were:  

 

• José Carlos Vicente Silva - Field and office activities coordinator;  

• Edvan Amorim Mesquita - Topographic team member - Perform the topographic surveying;   

• Edvan Amorim Mesquita - Draftsman – Create the residential and urban sketches; 

• Maria Goreth Moreira Alves – Community relations coordinator; 

• Geraldo Barbosa - Part-time Lawyer – Legal support to the team. 

 

The house and farming-lot price evaluations were made by Vaz de Mello Consulting, which is currently 

under review.  The professionals in charge are: 

 

Danilo Antônio Menezes Mota – Principal Coordinator 

Antônio Claudio Andrade Brum – Evaluator Engineer 

Carlos Henrique de Souza Epifânio – Agronomist Engineer 

 

The Socioeconomic Evaluation Final Report (text only) is presented in Appendix 22 – Socioeconomic 

Evaluation Final Report. All annexes to the aforementioned report are thoroughly organized and at the 

disposal of any pertinent authority for inspection and review. 

 

The EIA Evaluation Area impacted by the Project is located in the municipalities of Centro Novo do 

Maranhão ("Centro Novo"), Centro do Guilherme, Maracaçumé and Governador Nunes Freire.  Centro 

Novo do Maranhão and Centro do Guilherme are the municipalities where the mining activities will take 

place.  

 

Governador Nunes Freire has the largest population with ca 24,530 people, followed by the Maracaçumé 

municipality with ca 18,420 inhabitants.  The municipality of Centro Novo do Maranhão has ca 15,670 

inhabitants and the municipality of Centro do Guilherme has a population of ca 7,430 inhabitants.  The 



 

264 
 

Project will affect an estimated total population of about 66,100 inhabitants (2009 Census from IBGE 

(Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística – a Brazilian governmental organization in charge of 

population surveys)). 

 

The municipalities of Centro Novo do Maranhão and Centro do Guilherme have been studied more 

thoroughly because a portion of their territories will be occupied for the implementation of the Project.  

 

The data that characterizes these areas were collected through the Field Survey referred to in the 

introductory paragraph of this item, as part of the overall Socioeconomic Evaluation carried out in the 

first semester of 2010.    

 

2.4.8.1. Socioeconomic Considerations of Cipoeiro Community 

 

The Cipoeiro community, entirely located in the Project Area, has ninety-four (94) houses, and one (1) 

building serving as a school.  

 

The main economic activities in the Cipoeiro community are gold digging, small-scale farming and 

livestock production.  Additionally, there are also people who perform public service work such as 

teachers, health professionals, and an IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) technician.  

It is important to note that there are employment opportunities arising from timber production.  

 

Income for 36% of the families in the Cipoeiro community lies between one (1) and two (2) monthly 

Brazilian minimum wages (one Brazilian minimum wage = R$ 510 / month as of the date of this 

Feasibility), while 23.6% of the families make less than one (1) minimum wage per month, 22.4 % have 

incomes greater than three (3) times the minimum wage and the remaining 18% is composed of families 

who receive two (2) to three (3) minimum wages per month.  

 

The families that represent the 94 households that will have to be resettled have agreed to relocate.  

Eighty have agreed to be resettled in the Cipoeiro Housing Village (the "Village").  Six (6) are 

undecided as whether to take a cash indemnity or to resettle in the Village.  The other eight (8) 

households have decided to receive a cash indemnity.  



 

265 
 

 

2.4.8.2. Socioeconomic Consideration of the Chega Tudo Community  

 

Since Chega Tudo will be mined from 2020 onwards, the Socioeconomic Evaluation concerning the 

Chega Tudo Community was not developed to the same extent as the one performed for Cipoeiro.  The 

socioeconomic situation at the Chega Tudo impact area is similar to the one prevailing for Cipoeiro with 

regards to the quality of housing and type of economic activity.  

 

The Chega Tudo economy is also based on gold digging, extraction and processing of timber, and small-

scale livestock farming.  One hundred households are estimated to be resettled from this community.  

 

21.4.9 Discharge Water Quality, Discharge Limits and Monitoring Program  

 

21.4.9.1 Discharge Water and Effluents Sources   

 

The Golder Report indicates a need for sediment control for the disturbances created by the process 

plant, pits, and for control of materials deposited in waste dumps, and tailings and rejects facilities.  

Three (3) tailings and rejects storage facilities (TRSF) were designed, and documented in this Report 

under Appendix 20 - Tailings and Rejects Disposal Systems Main Design Features.  

 

Based on data from the Golder Report, Jaguar and TechnoMine evaluated five (5) alternative locations 

for the TRSFs within five (5) km of the Cipoeiro processing plant and pits, and selected the options that 

provided the appropriate tradeoff between storage capacity, dam construction fill, both from mined 

saprolite waste or from the deposition basin.  In addition, the selected sites have reduced or eliminated 

the watershed area, eliminating the need for a spillway by design; therefore, eliminating the need for 

treatment of effluent discharge. 

 

Under peak rainfall (deca-millennial rainfall peaks), the design of the tailings and rejects dams' 

embankments incorporate a 2 m extra height (freeboard) to accommodate total yearly rainfall in one (1) 

hour.  Given this design, there should not be discharge of tailings, rejects or water from the TRSFs to 

natural drainages.  Several studies have been conducted and reported in 2005, by MWH Americas 



 

266 
 

("MWH") and Golder, to geochemically characterize the waste dumps and tailings.  Acid–base 

accounting (ABA) reports show a very low acid rock potential (ARP) and that the waste might be self 

neutralizing. 

    

Saprolite ore and its tailings tend to be strongly net-neutralizing, without the potential to generate ARD.  

Although Bedrock ore and its tailings have more sulfide, the reports show low-to-none potential for 

ARD. 

   

Net acid-generating (NAG) tests also show that the bedrock does not have the potential to generate 

ARD. 

 

The screening-level characterization of surface water, sediment, fish tissue, and groundwater by MWH 

showed that pH, NO, SO, total dissolved solids (TDS), Al, As, Ba, Cd, Cr (tot), Cu, Pb, Ni, Se, Ag, and 

Zn did not exceed the Class II Standards.  Sediment analyses presented high aluminum and iron 

concentrations, while cadmium, selenium, and silver contents were below detection limits. 

 

Therefore, based on the water and effluent data, Golder and MWH concluded that no evidence existed 

for the need of water treatment of effluent streams from tailings discharge and seepage, waste dump 

seepage, or pit dewatering, because water from precipitation, groundwater and runoff would dilute 

spillage from tailings, waste dumps and pits.  Wetlands may be used to passively treat effluents, if 

needed in the future.  

 

21.4.9.2 Discharge Water Quality, Discharge Limits 

 

The BARRO LIMPO Rejects Dam ("RSF") will contain cyanide-free rejects from flotation.  In the event 

of accidental spillage, the water and rejects from this RSF could be discharged in the area around the 

RSF. 

 

The TUDO AZUL Tailings Dam ("TSF") will receive the cyanide tailings from the CIP plant.  A 

DETOX plant has been contemplated in the project design Process Flow Diagrams, and budgeted for the 

sake of safety, and for the Water Balance developed for this Feasibility.  Precipitation, groundwater and 



 

267 
 

run-off contributing to the contents of the geomembrane-lined cyanide tailings dam is not foreseen to 

generate discharge, even during intense storm events.   

 

After year 2021, the pits from Cipoeiro will be exhausted and serve as another RSF called POÇÃO for 

the rejects of the flotation plant.  By design, POÇÃO contains the same freeboard extra height that will 

prevent spillage. 

 

Geochemical characterization studies were performed by SGS on tailings composite samples that had 

been treated by the Inco SO2/air process for cyanide detoxification.  These samples were representative 

of Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo saprolite and rock ore types.  The results of these studies, on the samples 

tested, are as follows: 

 

• The EPA Modified Acid-Base Accounting Test indicated that the acid rock potential of the 

samples tested is low. 

 

• Whole Rock Analysis indicated that relatively high levels of arsenic in the Chega Tudo tailings 

may represent a potential for the development of high levels of arsenic in the settled tailings and 

rejects.  

 

• The relatively high concentrations of copper, zinc and chromium in the leaching tailings might 

present a risk of high levels of these metals in the tailings effluent.  

 

Because the detoxified tailings from Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo will be deposited in geomembrane-lined, 

spillage-free TSF, the risk of spillage and need for effluent treatment is eliminated. 

 

The results of Simulated Rainfall Leach Tests indicated that insignificant concentrations of trace metals 

could be leached by rainfall at atmospheric conditions. 

 

  



 

268 
 

21.4.9.3 Monitoring Program  

 

The monitoring performed assesses the Project's influence, from the standpoint of SEMA, which 

addresses rules for classifying river water, water quality standards, and discharge of effluents into water 

bodies defined at a federal level by CONAMA Resolution number 357 / year 2005. 

 

The monitoring program consists of a network of six (6) points for analysis of surface water and two (2) 

for underground water.  For the TRSFs, monitoring wells will be installed to detect any interference that 

may be caused by infiltration.  Sampling will be done on a monthly basis, and the parameters to be used 

are listed below.  

 

Control Parameters for surface and underground water are: pH, Color, Chlorides, Electrical 

Conductivity, Sulfate, Turbidity, Total Arsenic, Soluble Arsenic, Copper, Soluble Iron, Manganese, Free 

Cyanide, Total Cyanide, Ammoniac Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Total Dissolved Solids, Sediment 

Solids, Total Solids, Oils and Fats, Total Zinc, and Nitrates. 

 

Proposed Control Parameters for monitoring the TRSFs are: pH, eH, Chlorides, Electrical Conductivity, 

Sulfate, Sulfide, Total Arsenic, Soluble Arsenic, Total Cyanide, and Nitrates.  

 

The Project's area of influence is part of the Gurupi River water receiving basin.  At the Cipoeiro and 

Chega Tudo mines, creeks and flood areas shall be monitored.  The monitoring network for each mine 

has four (4) points of surface water and one (1) point of underground water (pumped from the mine).  

The Control Parameters analyzed at all points are: Soluble Arsenic, Total Arsenic, Soluble Copper, 

Total Copper, Total Coliforms, Fecal Coliforms, Electrical Conductivity, Color, Soluble Iron, Total 

Iron, Total Phosphate, Soluble Manganese, Total Manganese, Ammoniac Nitrogen, Total oils and fats, 

Dissolved Oxygen, in-natura pH, Total Dissolved Solids, Total Suspended Solids, Sulfates, Hydrogen 

Sulfide, Turbidity, BOD, and Fecal Streptococcus. 

 

  



 

269 
 

21.4.9.4 Sediment Control Structures 

 

Sediments from the waste dumps for the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo mines will be controlled through 

dikes.  Additional dikes and check dams will control sediment during the tailings and rejects dams 

construction and during the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo pit development phases.  

  

The check dams and dikes will not require excavation of sediment as these structures will be sized to 

handle the sediment generated during the temporary construction and development phases.   Upon 

completion of these phases, the structures will no longer be necessary and can be reclaimed in place. 

 

Dikes shall be constructed of riprap and using 2.5:1 side slopes or flatter.  As riprap has draining 

capability, the reservoir will always be drained out, giving volume to new runoffs and retaining 

sediment. 

 

Check dams are usually constructed of riprap, logs, sandbags, and/or straw bales.  As riprap will be 

available when the early pits development starts, this material should be the most appropriate 

construction material.  

 

Stone check dams should use side slopes of 2:1 or flatter.  The maximum height should be 60 cm at the 

center of the check dam, and the minimum height should be 25 cm lower than the shoulders to act as 

spillway for runoff.  

 

When the drainage area for a stone check dam exceeds 0.2 km², multiple check dams should be placed 

in line with the bottom elevation of the upper dam at the same elevation or higher as the top elevation of 

the next in line check dam. 

 

21.4.9.5     Sediment Control for the Main Haul Road 

 

The main haul road will require source control, or field Best Management Practices (BMPs).  This road 

will be sloped or crowned to allow for collection of runoff in adequately sized roadside ditches.  These 



 

270 
 

roadside ditches will discharge to small sediment control ponds, or other appropriate structures, at 

certain intervals.  All field BMPs will be cleaned and maintained regularly to ensure proper function. 

 

21.4.10   Description of the ARD Potential Assessment Program 

 

There is no potential for acid mine drainage in this Project.  The ABA (Acid Base Accounting) and 

NAG (Net Acid Generation) – USEPA Standard – United States Environmental Protection Agency -  

tests were performed SGS.  The Golder Report RT-049-5134-1410-0006-00-B, item 5.2 Geochemical 

Characterization presents the tests. 

 

Even though test results point to very low risk of acid water generation potential, a monitoring program 

is in place for the Project with main activities described in the following subsection 21.4.10.1 Control 

Plan for Acid Water Generation Potential.  

 

21.4.10.1  Control Plan for Acid Water Generation Potential 

 

In order to control and monitor the acid water generation potential risks at the Cipoeiro and Chega Tudo 

Mines, a monitoring plan has been created.  The plan encompasses the monitoring and control of the 

Acid Drainage Potential, through the implementation of the activities included in the following phases: 

 

• Investigation and Sampling 

 

• Geological Mapping of the Ongoing Excavations 

 

All the excavations will be systematically mapped.  Lithology and the structural aspects of the 

mineralization shall be tracked.  It is worth noting that all the mineralization is already mapped, 

including sulfide rocks. 

 

• Chemical and Mineralogy Analyses 

 



 

271 
 

Drill cuttings and working faces material shall be sampled in a regular pattern for Au and other elements 

grade control, or when the geological mapping identifies sulfide-bearing rocks.  All the samples shall be 

taken to the lab for mineral and chemical analyses.  The pattern can be modified should the geology so 

require. 

 

• Static Tests  

 

Based on the results of the aforementioned analyses and on the identification of the range where the 

sulfide rocks occur, a static test shall be established in order to define the acid water generation 

potential. 

 

• Kinetic Tests  

 

In addition, and based on the static tests results, areas that may show the potential of acid water will 

undergo kinetic tests. 

 

• Actions 

 

All the waste material generated from the areas showing acid water potential will be placed on a 

controlled stockpile.  Ore will be sent to the plant.  

 

In order to implement this procedure, a controlled stockpile will be designed and its location will be 

previously prepared.  The ground will be sealed in order to dispose the material and after disposal, a 1-m 

thick clay layer will be placed on the pile. 

 

• Reports to  SEMA 

 

Quarterly reports will be sent to SEMA describing the results achieved from the established procedures.  

 

21.4.11  Seismic Conditions 

 



 

272 
 

The Gurupi Project site lies on the Brazilian Shield, which is a large region of geologically stable rocks 

that comprises much of northeastern South America.  Records of historic earthquake locations indicate 

that the region surrounding the Project site has very low seismicity.  For example, only 11 earthquakes 

have been recorded within 1,000 km of the site since 1973.  Only two of these earthquakes were less 

than 500 km from the site.  The latest (1977) officially registered tremor was a Richter 4.8 magnitude 

scale quake.  The quake epicenter was about 490 km from the Gurupi Project site. 

 

The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Project (GSHAP, 1999) provides estimates of seismic hazard 

for all regions of the world.  Estimates are standardized to a peak horizontal ground acceleration (PGA) 

with a 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years.  This probability is equivalent to a return period of 

475 years.   GSHAP hazard estimates for the Gurupi Project area show a very low, 475-year return 

period PGA of 0-0.02 g.  The low hazard estimate reflects the lack of recorded historic seismicity and 

known active faults within about 1,000 km of the Project site. 

 

21.4.12  Seismic Risk 

 

From a tectonic point of view, the Brazilian territory is located almost entirely within the South 

American Plate, far from its east and west borders, represented by the Middle Atlantic Ridge and the 

Andes subduction zone, respectively.  This fact explains the relatively low seismicity in Brazil, when 

compared to the Andes region. 

 

However, seismic activity is considered significant once earthquakes of magnitude above 5.0 have 

occurred.  Therefore, although the seismic risk is low, it cannot be ignored. 

 

The majority of Brazilian quakes are of small magnitude (< 5.0 Richter).  The tremors usually occur at 

shallow depth (< 30 km), and therefore, are felt only a few kilometers from their epicenters.  This is the 

typical seismic pattern for regions within the plates. 

 

Due to the low seismicity in Brazil, scarce data exists for more elaborate studies in the Project site. 

 



 

273 
 

For the Gurupi Project TUDO AZUL Cyanide Tailings Dam design and the reject dams' designs, a 

value of 0.05 g for horizontal seismic load will be used following the recommendations from the 

Brazilian Committee on Large Dams (CBDB-Eletrobrás, 2003). 

 

21.4.13   Review of Equator Principles Application ("EPA") 

 

The "EQUATOR PRINCIPLES", executed on June 4th, 2003, is an industry approach for financial 

institutions in determining, assessing, and managing environmental and social risks for project financing 

purposes. 

 "Potential impact is considered sensitive if it may be irreversible (e.g., leading to loss of major natural 

habitat) or affect vulnerable groups or ethnic minorities, involve involuntary displacement or 

resettlement, or affect significant cultural heritage sites.  These impacts may affect an area broader than 

the sites or facilities subject to the physical works.  The EPA for a Category A project examines the 

project's potential negative and positive environmental impacts, compares them with feasible 

alternatives (including, the "without project" situation), and recommends any measures needed to 

prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental 

performance.  A full environmental assessment is required and part of the EIA." 

Mining activities, including underground mining and wet ore treatment require environmental licensing 

according to the "Normative Deliberation" 74/2004.  All the licensing processes must be accomplished 

in compliance with the applicable municipal, state and federal Laws, Codes, and Regulations.  For the 

Gurupi Project, the environmental authorities requested the preparation of an EIA/RIMA to subsidize 

the analysis of the main impacts and the necessary mitigating and compensatory measures.  The 

EIA/RIMA was filed with SEMA on November 2010. 

In the EIA/RIMA an environmental diagnostic was performed and, based on this diagnostic, the impacts 

related to the operation and implantation of the operation were defined, taking into account the physical, 

biotic, and anthropic environment. 

 



 

274 
 

In relation to the aspects of hygiene, safety and health at work, as well as fire prevention, the adopted 

criteria have been those dictated by the Regulating Code for Health and Safety at Work NR 22 – 

Occupational Safety and Health in Mining (Work and Employment Secretariat). 

 

21.5 EPC SCHEDULE 
 

A Precedence Diagram is shown in Appendix 21 – Project EPC Schedule, which includes all 

implementation activities such as engineering, procurement, construction, and start-up.  It can be seen as 

a summary of the Project Implementation Plan.  

 

The duration of the various activities were estimated based on Jaguar's and TechnoMine's experience 

with engineering, procurement, and construction conditions for similar projects in Brazil. 

 

21.6 PROJECT CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES 

 

21.6.1 Capital Cost Estimates Accuracy 

 

The methodology used to cost the Project's CAPEX items and the resulting cost accuracies are 

compatible with a full-blown bankable feasibility study.  Vendor firm quotes, contracts, agreements, 

receipts, and other documentation are attached to this Report (Volume III) and serve as hard backup for 

the cost estimates. 

 

Capital cost (based on suppliers' firm quotes) and operating cost estimates were prepared to an accuracy 

of +/- 10%. Costs have been detailed by engineering discipline and by category (materials, labor, 

subcontracts, etc.) for each area of the Project. These costs are presented in a logical and concise manner 

that can be clearly understood and can be verified by outside review. 

 

Subcontractors familiar with local labor conditions and labor productivity, specific project permit 

requirements, applicable regulations and schedule requirements, were consulted.  The capital cost 

estimates include, among others, the following items: 

 



 

275 
 

- engineering, procurement, and construction management 

- process and service equipment costs 

- contractor mobilization and demobilization 

- contractors' fees 

- liability insurance, erection, and installation labor hours and costs 

- power supply system 

- process and fresh water supply system 

- infrastructure costs necessary to operate and maintain the Project during its life 

- commissioning costs 

- freight to site and packing 

- all applicable taxes, duties, and tariffs 

- consumables of capital nature 

- capital spares 

- permits and fees

21.7 OPERATING COST ESTIMATE 

 

21.7.1 Operating Cost Estimates Accuracy 

 

The methodology used to cost the Project's OPEX items and the resulting cost accuracies are compatible 

with a full-blown bankable feasibility study. Vendor firm quotes, contracts, agreements, receipts, and 

other documentation are attached to this Report (Volume III) and serve as hard backup for the cost 

estimates. 

 

Operating cost estimates were also prepared to an accuracy of +/- 15%. Costs have been detailed by 

engineering discipline and by category (power, reagents, labor, subcontracts, etc.) for each area of the 

Project.  These costs are presented in a logical and concise manner that can be clearly understood and 

can be verified by outside review.  The operating cost estimates include, among others, the following 

items: 

 

- operating and maintenance labor 

- supervisory and administrative personnel 

- fringe benefits 

- water supply 

- power supply 

- operating supplies (expendables/reagents/chemicals/wear items/utilities/repair 

  supplies/spares/consumables) 

- laboratory costs 

 



 

277 
 

21.7.2 Estimated Operating Costs 

 

The total nondiscounted life-of-mine operating cost for the Project has been estimated at US$ 859.8 

million, as shown in detail in Appendix 02 – Cash Flow Model and Sensitivity Analysis - Base Case 

Scenario. 

 

21.8 GOLD PRICE AND REVENUE ESTIMATES 

 

The Project product is gold bullion, to be obtained from an induction furnace that will melt the loaded 

cathodes of the EW Circuit. 

 

The adopted price for the base case scenario has been US$ 1,066 / oz Au. This value corresponds to the 

expert-agreed gold projected average price over 2013 through 2025, by Consensus, on December 16, 

2010. Therefore, the Project total estimated nondiscounted "monetizable" (salable) amount of gold 

(1,932,920 oz Au) would yield a total nondiscounted gross revenue of US$ 2,060.5 million. As a result, 

the average annual gross revenue would amount to US$ 158.5 million, i.e., US$ 2,060.5 million/13 

years.
