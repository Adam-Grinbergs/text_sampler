1 Summary 

1.1 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND OWNERSHIP 

The Granada Gold Mine property is located 5 kilometres south of the city center of Rouyn-Noranda in 
northwestern Quebec and 1.5 kilometers south east of the borough of Granada.  

The Property is located in the municipality of Rouyn-Noranda (Granada sector) in northwestern Québec, 
the area is centered at 48°10' N Latitude and 79°01' W Longitude in National Topographic Map. This 
property comprises NTS map sheet 32D02 and 32D03. 

The property covers a total area of 10061.22 ha (100.6 km2) and comprises 246 staked mining claims 
divided in 3 contiguous groups of 27, 98 and 121 claims, held 100% by Gold Bullion Development Corp. 
(TSX-V: GBB). 

Claims are all in good standing with renewals at variable due dates. A total of 101 claims are up for 
renewal in the 2014 year, and the rest between 2015 and 2023. The claims within the Granada Property 
are held 100% by Gold Bullion. The mining lease BM #813 covering 21.12 hectares and BM # 852 
covering 22.47 hectares have a 3% NSR payable to Mousseau Tremblay Inc. 

The claims are valid for two-year periods and convey only exploration rights, no surface rights.  The claims 
are in a good standing according to the claim system registry of Québec (Gestim). In general an average 
of $1200 work in exploration for each claim is required to maintain them in good standing. An assessment 
report must be filed with the MERN (Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles) with appropriate 
proof of exploration expenses. Grupo Moje Ltd. is responsible for the submission of the assessment work 
for Gold Bullion and will be filing the assessment work. 

1.2 SCOPE OF WORK 

The initial PFS mandate from Gold Bullion to SGS Geostat was to prepare an on-site mill scenario; the 
scope of work has changed during the preparation of the study by GBB in order to bring the project into a 
Phase I – Open Pit with custom milling i.e. the rolling start. Gold Bullion wants to become a gold producer. 

The current report presents the scenario of Phase I – Open Pit with custom milling to IamGold Westwood 
(former Doyon) mill in Abitibi. The scenario schedules to produce 550 tpd of ore over 3 years which should 
be hauled to the Iamgold mill and process in batches with assistance in the preparation of the Certificate 
of Authorization. 

1.3 GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 

The Granada Mine property is situated within rocks of the Temiscaming group, on the south limb of the 
regional east-west trending Granada synclinorium whose axial trace is located south of the Cadillac Fault. 
The property is underlain principally by east-west-trending, north-dipping interbedded-polymictic 
conglomerate, porphyry-pebble conglomerate, greywacke and siltstone-mudstone of the Granada 
Formation. 

The Cadillac Fault traverses the northern part of the property. Within the Granada mine site itself a parallel 
set of shears (Granada Shear Zone) occur over a zone of 500 m in width. The shears are characterized by 
intense sericite, iron carbonate plus minor chlorite alteration with disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite and 
host quartz veins and stringers. The veins comprise boudinaged or en-echelon quartz lenses within the 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 2
 

sediments and more continuous veins in the syenite intrusive bodies. A series of northeasterly trending 
sigmoidal faults occur between the Cadillac Fault and the Granada Shear Zone due to late shearing. This 
late shearing also imparted the fracturing and dilatancy in the quartz veins. 

The gold mineralization is hosted by east-west trending smokey grey, fractured quartz veins and stringers. 
Free gold occurs at vein margins or within fractures of the quartz veins or sulphides. Late northeasterly-
trending sigmoidal faults also host high grade gold mineralization. Accessory minerals include tourmaline, 
carbonate, chlorite, and disseminated sulphides. Pyrite is the dominant sulphide typically occurring within 
the immediate wall rock to the quartz veins. Minor pyrite does occur within the veins themselves. 
Additional sulphides such as chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite sphalerite, and galena are present in trace 
amounts. Fuchsite (chromium mica) is present in the immediate wall rock to the quartz veins.  

The gold grade at Granada varies due to coarse free gold in the mineralized structures. Apparently 
discontinuous, the mineralized structures are relatively continuous; this is shown by assay grade continuity 
on cross section and the associated geometry of the underground workings. 

The mineralized zones are being cut in blocks which are shifted in majority to the north. 

In a cross-sectional view near shaft #1, the extent of the vein is over 250 m, supported by drillhole data. 
An important point to mention is the fact that previous operators did not extract all the gold. It is possible to 
see the drift projection between recent mineralized core intersections into the foot wall vein. 

1.4 EXPLORATION AND DRILLING 

The Granada property has been explored by Gold Bullion Development Corp. throughout the last seven 
years by Gold Bullion Development Corp. Geological and structural studies were done by EarthMetrix 
Technologies Inc. in order to determine optimal exploration targets for the discovery of significant gold 
mineralization on the D2D3 group of properties from available data (Assessment work files from the 
MRNF), structural interpretations using the technology developed by Technologies EarthMetrix Inc. by 
integrating all results coming from different interpretations. Maps are defined by the property limits. 

A 140,000 tonnes bulk sample was processed by Gold Bullion in 2007 from an open pit at the Granada 
Mine, of which 30,000 tonnes were processed using an on-site mill. The average gold grade from this 
large sample was 1.62 g/t with a 90-percent rate gold recovery. The waste from this bulk sample, along 
with the waste stockpile from past bulk sampling programs at the Granada mine by previous operators 
were also assayed and returned an average grade of 1.75 g/t Au. This confirms the presence of gold 
mineralization between the vein structures, which trend east-west as one large overall structure.  

In early 2013, SGS discovered shallow high grade zones using assay results from previous exploration 
campaigns. In May 2013, Gold Bullion Development Corporation contracted SGS Geostat to perform 
channel sampling on the Granada Gold property. The campaign focused on developing the newly 
discovered high grade zones identified in drillholes. Assays from channel samples taken from the trenched 
areas varied from 22.42 g/t Au over 1.04 metres to 0.01 g/t Au over 0.82 metres. 

The Company has carried out three phases of exploration starting in 2009, another in 2010 and the third in 
2011. All exploration work, especially drilling was completed under supervision and management of the 
Company's previous consultant. The drilling was done by diamond-drill using NQ core size. 

• Phase 1: the company drilled 25 shallow holes from December 2009 to January 2010 at the 
Granada Gold Property. A total of 2,817 metres was drilled. 

• Phase 2: the Company launched a 20,000 metres drill program at the Granada Gold Project in 
early May 2010, which was extended by 5,000 metres in September due to encouraging early 
results.  

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 3
 

• Phase 3: Gold Bullion Development has completed nearly 11,000 metres of drilling at its Granada 
Gold Property as of January 21, 2011, with intersecting new mineralized structures throughout the 
LONG Bars Zone (main Granada mineralized structure package). From that drilling mineralization 
remains open in all directions at Granada.  

The deep and shallow drilling programs were initiated in 2012 under Claude Duplessis recommendation to 
test structures and gold mineralization presence on the north and west extension of the Granada Property. 
The spring 2012 drilling program was intended to enlarge the gold mineralization envelope of the 
expanded LONG Bars zone resource to the north at depth and near surface to the west. A total of 8339.25 
metres in 23 holes was drilled on the Granada Property in 2012. 

No exploration work is present 

1.5 HISTORICAL TAILINGS AND WASTE PILE 

Part of the Property is recovered by historical tailings and there are tailings in one of the old open pits, 
now filled with water. The old tailings belong to the "Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles, 
secteur Mines" (orphan site). Gold Bullion is taking actions to take care of them in direct communication 
with the MERN and MDDELCC.  

Regarding the onsite waste pile, legacy of previous open-pit operations, Gold Bullion can use the rock for 
access road construction and it is also being used by local contractors for fill. An application for a 
Certificate of Authorization (C of A) is underway for the use of this material. Galarneau has just received 
its C of A to crush and screen aggregate.  He has a contract 70,000 tonnes and to the author's knowledge 
has a C of A for this independent operation but the Company needs another C of A for the remaining fines 
which is being prepared by Goldminds Geoservices with SODAVEX. 

Permits for exploration drilling to the north of the property are in good standing. 

The property is outside Joannès wildlife preserve located to the east. A potential risk exists with a 
proposed Bill n°14 (An Act respecting the development of mineral resources in keeping with the principles 
of sustainable development) that gives more power to Municipalities and MRC. Since these entities do not 
have qualified persons to review mineral projects it is one of the main concerns of the mineral industry. 
This situation applies to all mining and exploration projects in the Province of Québec and is not specific to 
the Granada property. 

1.6 MINERAL PROCESSING, METALLURGICAL TESTING AND RECOVERY METHODS 

Metallurgical testing done at SGS Lakefield and at the URSTM1 of Rouyn-Noranda on the Granada ore 
suggests that 95% gold recovery is easily attainable by gravity separation followed by cyanidation of the 
gravity tailings. 

Since Gold Bullion (GBB) chose to have its Granada ore to be custom processed at the Iamgold-
Westwood mill (IMG-formerly Doyon), the ore will be transported a distance of approximately 43 km from 
Granada and stockpiled at Doyon. A schedule of processing from a minimum  30,000  tonnes of ore are 
stockpiled is in completion, actual schedule for October 2014 for 30,000 tonnes while batches in April, July 
and November 2015 and beyond should be in the 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes batches. Iamgold will stop 
milling the Westwood ore to batch mill the Granada material. For the purpose of this report, batches of 

1 Unité de Recherche en Technologie Minérale is affiliated to the Quebec University in Abitibi-
Témiscamingue.

Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 4
 

35,000 tonnes are proposed at a mill feed rate of 2,400 tpd, meaning more or less 15 days of continuous 
runs. Because the Iamgold-Doyon mill is proven to be very efficient, SGS Geostat believes that the gold 
recovery will be at least what was obtained at the metallurgical testing level. 

Gold settlement between IMG and GBB will be done by the computation of the daily tonnage, the daily mill 
sampling, and the weighing and analysing of the doré bars. Moreover the mill will be surveyed and gold 
inventory will be taken at the beginning and end of each of the batches.  However because it is not 
possible to avoid some ore mixing at the beginning and end of each batches, GBB an IMG will have title to 
and ownership of the doré bars on a pro rata basis based on the respective amounts of refined gold 
attributable to each of them. 

1.7 MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATES 

SGS has conducted extensive validation and database construction to prepare a reliable resource 
estimate for the Granada Gold project. SGS considers the resource estimate to have been reasonably 
prepared and to conform to the current CIM standards and definitions for estimating resources, as 
required under NI 43-101 "Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects." Therefore, SGS accepts the 
public disclosure of the resource estimate as the basis for ongoing exploration at the Granada. However, 
the reader should be cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. 

In order to address mining underground, mineralized zones have been remodelled with 3 to 4 meters 
horizontal width below elevation 237.5 metres. Estimated underground mineral resources of the Granada 
gold project are simply obtained by adding resources in blocks with an estimated grade above any given 
cut-off. Resource tonnage of a block is: 2.5m×1.25m×1.25m×2.7t/m3 = 10.55t for a full block (100% below 
overburden/topo surface). 

In the context of re-engineering to increase robustness of the Granada project, Mineral resources have 
been remodeled with mineral zones having a minimum horizontal width of 7m down to elevation 237.5m. 
This resource model has been used for pit optimization and design for the "Rolling Start" project. This 
model starts from the surface and pit bottom to elevation 237.5 metres. 

A cut-off grade of 1.69 g/t was used in the resource estimation and composites were capped at 30 g/t. A 
density of 2.7 t/m3 was used in the calculation of tonnage. The outcome is displayed in Table 1-1.

In order to address mining underground, mineralized zones have been remodeled with 3 to 4 meters 
horizontal width below elevation 237.5 metres. Estimated underground mineral resources of the Granada 
gold project are simply obtained by adding resources in blocks with an estimated grade above any given 
cut-off. Resource tonnage of a block is: 2.5m×1.25m×1.25m×2.7t/m3 = 10.55t for a full block (100% below 
overburden/topo surface). 

A cut-off grade of 3 g/t was used in the resource estimation and composites were capped at 30 g/t. A density 
of 2.7 t/m3 was used in the calculation of tonnage. The outcome is displayed in Table 1-3. The outcome of the 

combined underground (resource beneath the pit to a maximum depth of 237.5 m, CoG of 1.69 g/t, and 
resource beneath the depth of 237.5, CoG of 3 g/t) is displayed in Table 1-4. 

Highlights include a Measured and Indicated combined underground gold resource of 325,450 ounces of 
gold at an average grade of 5.10 g/t gold plus 25,700 ounces Inferred at a grade of 7.14 g/t gold. The 
combined underground measured resource is 107,600 ounces (763,500 tonnes grading 4.38 g/t), 
indicated resource is 217,600 ounces (1,221,000 tonnes grading 5.54 g/t), inferred resource is 25,700

Note and considerations: rounded numbers. The historical production of 51,476 ounces (181,744 sT @ 
0.28 oz/sT) from 1930 to 1935 is included in the resource statement (cannot physically remove from 
measured, indicated or inferred) as the historical opening cannot be placed in 3D. Moreover, the historical 
mining apparently extents to the west where no mineral resources have been estimated due to 
impossibility to drill from old tailing surface. The author also wants to remind that grade estimations comes 
from Gold Bullion recent drilling, hence gold grades do not comes from historical data in the mined out 
sector. 

1.8 MINERAL RESERVES ESTIMATES 

The reserves derived from the detailed pit design have been estimated in accordance with the definitions 
and guidelines adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM Standards on 
Mineral Resources and Reserves). The reserves are based entirely on measured and indicated resources 
and were converted as probable and proven reserves respectively.  

The mineral reserves (with dilution and ore loss) is therefore equal to 569,000 tonnes of ore at an average 
grade of 4.24 g/t Au using cut-off grades of 1.69 g/t and represents an operation of 3.0 years. The entire 
reserve comprises 77,500 ounces of gold (before processing recovery). Total waste, including rock, 
inferred resources and overburden, is 9.3 Mt; resulting in a waste to ore ratio of 16:3. The detailed mineral 
reserve estimate is shown in Table 1-5: 

Table 1-5: Granada Project Reserves (presented as mill feed) 

 

1.9 MINING 

The mining of Granada deposit will follow the standard practice of an open-pit operation with the 
conventional drill and blast, load and haul cycle, using a drill / truck / excavator mining fleet, and supported 
by a fleet of auxiliary equipment. The run-of-mine (RoM) will be drilled, blasted and loaded by hydraulic 
excavators and delivered by trucks to an ore stockpiling area. The ore will then be loaded onto transport 
trucks and delivered to the Iamgold processing plant, approximately 43 km from the mine site. Waste rock 
material will be hauled to the waste disposal areas near the pits or backfilled into the mined pits. It has 
been assumed that the mining of the Granada deposit will be carried out by a mining fleet that will be 
leased and maintained by the Owner. 

A preliminary pit optimisation was performed to outline the mineral resource that demonstrates a prospect 
for economical extraction. The resulting shell was then used to design a final open-pit including a ramp 
and safety berms. The mineral resource, which can be converted into reserve in this PFS, contained in the 
final pit is summarized in Table 1-6.

Table 1-6: In-pit reserves 

 

A mine production schedule was prepared for the development and the operation of the Project. The 
mining production schedule for the open pit is based on a pre-stripping period of approximately 3 months. 
The results of the developed schedule are summarized in Table 1-3. Key findings include:  

• Project life of 3 years, with an ore mining rate of approximately 550 tonnes per day ;  
• Mill feed over the Project life of 569,000 tonnes at 4.24 g/t Au;  
• Gold production of 73,600 ounces.  

The following Table 1-7 is summarizing the production, the waste removal, and the average grade over 
the mine life. 

 

Table 1-7: Mine Development and Production Data 

 

The proposed schedule for the open-pit operations is based on two 8-hour shifts per day, 7 days a week 
and 350 days per year. The mining operations at Granada will use conventional mining methods, including 
drilling and blasting sequences, loading with hydraulic excavators, and hauling with off-road mining trucks. 
The selection of two 8-hour shifts is based mainly on the fact that this schedule will avoid any possible 
disturbing of the neighbourhood during the night. 

The main mining fleet will consists of hydraulic excavators with a 5 tonnes bucket capacity, and 35 tonnes 
off-road trucks. The Table 1-8 is listing the main open-pit equipments.

between 60,000 to 70,000 t).The distance is estimated at 46 km Pad to Pad and an estimated traveling 
time of one hour one direction. The detailed finale schedule is not completed yet. GBB with its consultants 
have contacted the School board and summer camp responsible of the town of Rouyn-Noranda to 
address traffic time concerns. The company do not intend to haul material during the night as well as there 
is limited to no traffic haulage during kids arrival and departure of the Granada school. Alternative routes 
have been studied and the presented path is the one which meets regulations to the provincial and 
municipal level. The path has been studied with the technical counsel of the town of Rouyn-Noranda. 

1.12 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT  

The design and the environmental management of the project facilities and activities will be done in 
accordance with this legal framework. According to the ore production rate (550 t/d) and the 
characteristics of the project, one certificate of authorization (CA) from the MDDELCC under Section 22 of 
the Environmental Quality Act, will be required in order to carry out the Granada Project.  

Other permits, authorizations and approvals required include: 

• authorization under Section 32 of the EQA will be needed for the treatment of potable water 
(including for toilets and showers) and the treatment of wastewaters,  

• approval of the location of the waste dumps; 

• mining lease for the small open-pit outside of GBB existing leases; 

• lease for the occupation of the domain of the state for infrastructures outside of the mining leases 
(waste dumps, overburden dump, polishing pond); 

• approval of the rehabilitation plan. 

At the federal level, considering ore production rate, the Granada Project is not a designated project and it 
will not consequently have to go through the Canadian environmental assessment process. 

Ore and waste rock material were characterized regarding environmental issues. Three (3) ore samples 
and eight (8) waste rock samples were selected by GBB geologists for geochemical characterization. The 
samples were subjected to testing to assess their metal content; metal leaching potential and acid rock 
drainage potential. The results of the testing indicated that waste rock is considered as «low risk», and ore 
is «acid generating» according to the classification of mining waste of the Directive 019. Therefore, no 
special measures for the protection of groundwater and surface waters are required for percolation waters 
from the waste dumps. A geomembrane liner will be installed at the temporary ore stockpile area in order 
to collect percolation waters and treat them if necessary to respect Directive 019 requirements for effluent 
before discharge in the environment.   

Additionally, studies were carried out to collect baseline data on the physical (hydrology, hydrogeology, 
water and sediment quality) and biological (terrestrial and aquatic habitats; wetlands; wildlife, special-
status studies; protected areas) environments. Socio-economic data were also collected on the Abitibi-
Témiscamingue Administrative Region, more specifically the Granada District of the town of Rouyn-
Noranda where the project is located. Description of the bio-physical and socio-economic components of 
the study area environment was based on information collected from various sources: field surveys; aerial 
photographs and/or satellite images, maps, and geomatics tools; information gathered from various 
governmental agencies; studies from the scientific and technical literature. 

The project area considered for the project impact study extends 8 km by 8 km and is centered on the 
projected mine site. The most important rivers and lakes present in the project area are the Pelletier and 
Bruyère lakes, and the La Bruère and Beauchastel rivers. Other rivers and lakes are also present, but are 
of smaller size.   

The project area is part of the continuous boreal forest sub-zone. The area is dominated by mixed forests 
(about 50%), mostly dominated by deciduous species, such as trembling aspens. The second most 
abundant type of stands is mixed regenerating forest (about 10%). Otherwise, white birch, black spruce 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 10
 

and balsam fir stands are observed. Wetlands cover about 6 % of the total project area, and already 
disturbed areas cover almost 8% of the territory. No special-status plant species are known to occur in the 
project area. 

The project region is known for its diversified terrestrial and freshwater aquatic wildlife. Some species 
were reported in the project area with regards to special-status wildlife species (red and hoary bats, 
woodland caribou). The bald eagle is a species designated as vulnerable at the provincial level and is 
known to occur in the Pelletier Lake area. Also, the channel darter is designated as threatened species at 
the federal level. Finally, legally-designated wildlife habitats are located at the borders of the project area, 
i.e. three waterfowl gathering areas and one muskrat habitat. Those two areas are protected under the 
Regulation respecting wildlife habitats. 

Since the project is located near the town of Rouyn-Noranda, GBB has carried out several public 
consultations, notably with: authorities of the town of Rouyn-Noranda, including the mayor; 
representatives of the Rouyn-Noranda Snowmobile Association; representatives of the Rouyn-Noranda 
School Board; representatives of the Rouyn-Noranda Recreation Service. Public presentations of the 
project have also been held. Participation of residents living in the area of the project has been important. 
Furthermore, an information letter has been sent to the Timiskaming First Nation Council in Notre-Dame-
du-Nord, 80 km south-west of Rouyn-Noranda.  

Lastly, concepts of rehabilitation have been prepared for the project. The rehabilitation plan includes 
mitigation measures for the remaining waste rock piles and hauls roads surfaces. Most of the mining 
infrastructures will be dismantled and managed according to regulatory requirements (disposed of or 
recycled off-site). Once the mining activities cease, the pit will gradually fill up to its equilibrium level with 
rainfall and groundwater. Fences will be installed around the open-pits for security purpose. Whenever 
possible, the surface water drainage pattern will be re-established to a condition similar to the original 
hydrological system.  

As per to Directive 019, a monitoring program will be implemented following the mine closure to account 
for all the requirements specified in that Directive, especially with regards to surface and ground water 
quality, physical stability of the waste rock piles, and effectiveness of the re-vegetation. 

1.13 CAPITAL COSTS 

The total capital expenditures cost (CAPEX) is estimated at an overall accuracy of ±25%, which is the 
standard for a pre-feasibility study. The CAPEX was defined by SGS using an in-house database, seller 
bids, and the Mine & Mill Equipment Costs Estimator's Guide: Capital & Operating Costs (2012) annexed 
to 2014. The total required investment is estimated at 6.70 M$. Please refer to the Table 1-10 for the 
CAPEX breakdown.

This capital requirement does not include: 

• Costs to obtain permits; 
• Any provision for changes in exchange rates; 
• GST/QST; 
• Project financing and interest charges; 
• Price/cost escalation during construction; 
• Import duties and custom fees; 
• Sunk cost; 
• Exploration activities; 
• Severance cost for employees at the cessation of operations; 
• Any additional costs (but can partly be absorbed in contingency allowance). 

1.14 SUSTAINING CAPITAL COSTS 

Each mining operation has to inject a certain yearly amount of investment, defined as sustaining capital 
costs, in order to keep its operation up and running, to respect regulations, etc. At the inverse of the 
CAPEX, theses cost are occurring after the start of the operation. SGS estimates this sustaining capital 
cost to be 2.90 M$ divided in 3 main items; financial guarantee for site rehabilitation, overburden stripping, 
and others. Table 1-11 outlines the estimates for the cost per year of operation.  

Table 1-11: Estimates cost per year of operation 

 

1.15 OPERATING COSTS  

Mine operating costs were calculated using a list of equipment and manpower prepared by SGS. Mining 
operating costs include; the leasing costs for the main mining equipments, the equipment operating cost, 
the salaries, the cost for blasting and other services. The equipment cost and blasting cost are based on 
Supplier's budgeted price and a fuel price of C$1.30 per liter of fuel. Average salaries are based upon a 
discussion between SGS and Gold Bullion Development Corporation and include an average of 30% 
fringe benefits. Equipment unit operating and maintenance costs were developed from quotations 
received from supplier cost estimation guides and from experience and personal contacts within the 
mining industry; other sources of information are from an internal database on similar projects. The global 
hard rock mining costs are summarized in the Table 1-12.

1.16 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS  

SGS made a numbers of assumptions in order to develop the Granada Project financial model:  

• price of gold at $1,400.00 CDN per ounce troy;  
• 3.0% NSR is attributable to a third party;  
• processing rate of 192,500 tonnes per year (equivalent to approximately of 550 tonnes per day);  
• constant exchange rate of $0.90 (CDN$:US$);  
• discount rate of 5.00 %;  
• sunk costs and owner's costs are not included in the model;  
• 3 years of mining operation;  
• initial capital cost will be spend before the first year of production (year -1 in the model); 

A summary of the base case results is given in Table 1-13.

The sensitivity of the Net Present Value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) were evaluated for 
changes in key variables and parameters such as:  

• Capital investment (CAPEX);  
• Gold price; 
• Operating cost;  
• Head grade; 
• Processing recovery.  

For simplification purpose, this sensitivity was prepared using only the pre-tax values. The result of the

Figure 1-1: Sensitivity analysis 

It can be seen that the gold price, the head grade and the processing recovery have the greatest impact 
on project NPV and IRR. The project becomes uneconomic when the gold price, the head grade, or the 
processing recovery drops by about 27.5 %. Overall, the project is sensitive to each of the major variables. 
This sensitivity analysis clearly demonstrates that the gold price needs to remain over 1,000 $CDN/oz 
troy; in order to keep the project economically viable.

1.17 OTHER RELEVANT DATA (PROJECT SCHEDULE) 

 
Figure 1-2: Project schedule 

 

1.18 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

1.18.1 CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE ESTIMATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES 
In the context of re-engineering to increase robustness of the Granada project, Mineral resources have 
been remodelled with mineral zones having a minimum horizontal width of 7m down to elevation 237.5m. 
This resource model has been used for pit optimization and design for the "Rolling Start" project. This 
model starts from the surface and pit bottom to elevation 237.5 metres. Lower grade is now excluded from 
the mineral resource statement. No gold loss has occurred from the PEA resource model to the actual 
presentation. It is all a matter of the mineral cut-off grade used with the associated economic scenario. 

In order to address mining underground, mineralized zones have been remodelled with 3 to 4 meters 
horizontal width below elevation 237.5 metres. Highlights include a Measured and Indicated combined 
underground gold resource of 325,450 ounces of gold at an average grade of 5.10 g/t gold plus 25,700 
ounces Inferred at a grade of 7.14 g/t gold. The combined underground measured resource is 107,600 
ounces (763,500 tonnes grading 4.38 g/t), indicated resource is 217,600 ounces (1,221,000 tonnes 
grading 5.54 g/t), inferred resource is 25,700 ounces gold (112,000 tonnes grading 7.14 g/t Au) using a 
cut-off grade of 0.40 g/t.  

Previous small open pits have been taken into account and are starting surfaces of optimization. The 
historical production of 51,476 ounces (181,744 sT @ 0.28 oz/sT) from 1930 to 1935 is included in the 
resource statement and the author cannot physically remove it from the measured, indicated or inferred 
categories. As the historical opening cannot be placed in 3D. Moreover the historical mining apparently 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 16
 

extent to the west where no mineral resources have been estimated due to impossibility to drill from old 
tailing surface. The author also wants to remind that grade estimations comes from Gold Bullion recent 
drilling, hence gold grades do not comes from historical data in the mined out sector. 

• Accuracy of the disclosure on what has been mined out underground. The amount of material 
mined out is limited, however it could be a bit more than disclosed but not to a huge extent since it 
would be reflected with a much larger tailing footprint. 

• Combination of additional factors which could materially affect the resources are: 
o The presence of old orphan tailings 
o The presence of arsenic in the rock at Granada 

1.18.2 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
The mineral reserve (with dilution and ore loss) is equal to 569,000 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 
4.24 g/t Au using cut-off grades of 1.69 g/t and represents an operation of 3.0 years. The entire reserve 
comprises 77,500 ounces of gold (before processing recovery). This reserve is dated to the effective date 
of this report. Reserves are based on a cut-off grade and there is always a possibility that the cut-off grade 
varies over time. The majors factors that could affect the cut-off grade, and thus directly the ore reserves, 
are a change in the gold price, a change in the processing recovery, a change in the operating costs (such 
as processing, G&A, transport, etc.), a different mining dilution that the one used in this report, etc.  

1.18.3 MINING METHODS 
As describe previously in this section, the mining of Granada deposit will follow the standard practice of an 
open-pit operation with the conventional drill and blast, load and haul cycle, using a drill / truck / excavator 
mining fleet, and supported by a fleet of auxiliary equipment. The run-of-mine (RoM) will be drilled, blasted 
and loaded by hydraulic excavators and delivered by trucks to an ore stockpiling area. The ore will then be 
loaded onto transport trucks and delivered to the Iamgold processing plant, approximately 43 km from the 
mine site while the waste rock material will be hauled to the waste disposal areas near the pits or 
backfilled into the mined pits. 

During this study, SGS came to the conclusion that the riskier item associated to mining is the control of 
the mining dilution during the operations. The ore zones are relatively thin following a 45-55 degrees dip 
and are favorable to an important dilution. In this study, SGS estimated the dilution to 25% at a gold grade 
of 0.00 g/t. Based on our experience and on similar operations, these estimates are judged acceptable but 
a considerable effort will be required during the operations to achieve these values. The effect of an 
increase in mining dilution is to lower the average mill feed grade and directly affect the project 
profitability. As is can be seen in the sensitivity analysis, the overall project profitability is extremely 
sensitive to the mill feed grade. SGS recommends to pursue the analysis of calculating the mining dilution 
during a feasibility study by considering various approaches such as lower the height of the benches in 
ore material, do in-fill drilling, increase the assaying of the ore zones, control and follow the ore blasts 
movements, etc. 

Another aspect that requires attention is the old underground openings. It has been since 1930 that the 
Granada project is sporadically mined. Consequently, old underground excavations are present and need 
to be considered if mining is re-started. The first pit is in a Greenfield zone where no underground mining 
has proceed. It is scheduled to proceed with 3D scanning of openings and survey once water level allows 
access to the openings. Old underground drift location have been put in plan but exact position are not 
considered exact for the mining operation and the company should complete a detailed survey once 
access is possible using laser scanner, surface survey with GPR to model openings. Procedures will have 
to be put in place for the accurate survey of the openings before getting into their vicinity. As the mining 
width of the old time is relatively thin and no huge openings are present in documents, the procedure 
should be relatively simple and limited ore drop to the level should occur.  It is important to mention that as 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 17
 

per existing information only a portion of the bottom of the pit to the west should cross small underground 
openings. 

1.18.4 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
The financial analysis of the Granada Project for the base case scenario demonstrates the profitability of 
the project using the assumptions made in this report with a pre-tax NPV of 24.7 M$ and a pre-tax IRR of 
169%. However, there is always a possibility that such values vary more or less, and thus depending on 
several factors as has been shown in the sensitivity analysis. It is important to remember that the project is 
very sensitive to the gold price, the head grade and to the processing recovery. As per example, if one of 
these values varies by +27.5 % or by -27.5 %, the project NPV became 49.2 M$ and 0.0 M$ respectively. 

Note: At the moment of completing this report, final discussions on the custom milling agreement were 
underway. In the author's opinion (Claude Duplessis, Eng.) who have participate in providing the technical 
information between the parties and continuous discussions between responsible of IMG & GBB, there is 
actually no reason to believe that the custom milling agreement between IMG & GBB should not take 
place and believe it should be signed within the next 2 to 3 weeks to the latest. 

 

1.19 RECOMMENDATIONS 

1.19.1 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE ESTIMATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES 
It is recommended to undertake negotiation and clean-up of the orphan tailings (dating from 1935) with the 
Ministry of Natural Resources Quebec in order to enable exploration drilling to the northwest of existing 
drilling to validate extension of the mineralized package at depth (old tailings location). It is also 
recommended to do additional drilling to improve resource estimates in the open pit area lateral extension. 
It is also recommended to complete the drilling to the west, to the north and to the east on a 40 to 50 m 
grid of surface holes drilling southward at 55 degrees dip. A few infill holes where gap exists and 3 cross-
sections of 3 holes on 100 m line to tests mineralization on the claims to the west. There are 3 target 
depths which merit additional drilling. One is near surface which we can define as 0-100, from 100 to 400 
meters and deeper which is 400 to 1000 meters vertical depth, The deep drilling of 2012, the DUP holes 
have confirmed extension of gold mineralisation at 1Km vertical depth showing the system is still open. 
The author also wants to mention that the property has not been explored extensively by diamond drilling 
and some budget should be put on testing extensions when the economic conditions allows for that type 
of work. 

 

The exploration work program & others – Step 1 – 2014/2015 is estimated as follow: 

Exploration Budget on the Granada Project (CAN$) 

Trenching (exploration)    $75,000 

Drilling (definition, exploration (0-400m))         $2,500,000 

Geotech Drilling (try to increase pit slope)          $75,000 

Laboratory met testings   $50,000 

Supervision and Technical reports             $150,000 

Deep drilling program Phase 2 targeting mineralization depth (400-1000m) $5,000,000 

Estimated total cost         $7,850,000

1.19.2 MINING 
The Granada PFS is comprised of mining work that has been selected, designed and estimated in a way 
to meet industry standards. For this level of study, SGS has provided a mining plan for the future 
operation. SGS has provided a list of recommendations, which would be beneficial if contemplated during 
detailed engineering phase. These mining engineered recommendations include:  

• Developing strategic mine schedule in short-term detail (quarterly, monthly); 
• Identifying opportunities for in-pit dumping; 
• Review the estimation of the mining dilution and ore loss with a detailed mining approach for ore 

material; 
• Complete a geotechnical study to optimize the open-pit slopes; 
• Perform trade-off study for mining equipment selection and size; 
• Consider the underground mining method as a serious alternative; 
• Perform trade-off study to outline the optimal transition between open-pit and underground mining. 

 

The authors recommend to Gold Bullion to proceed with the development of the project conditional to the 
recommended program of work which includes: definition and geotechnical drilling specific to the pit, in 
addition to the detailed engineering while permitting process takes place.

2 Introduction 

The Granada Gold Project is located in Abitibi, 5 km south of the city of Rouyn-Noranda, Québec. This NI 
43-101 Report was prepared by SGS Geostat for Gold Bullion Development Corporation for the Phase I – 
Open Pit project. It includes information from the update of the Mineral Resources which was completed 
and filed on May 06rd 2014, portion of the Preliminary Economic Assessment PEA study completed on 
February 2013 and all information from then to now. The mineral resource model has been redone in the 
Phase I open pit custom milling scenario which is also named the rolling start. 

2.1 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATION 

This technical report was prepared by SGS Canada Inc. – Geostat ("SGS Geostat") for Gold Bullion 
Development Corporation ("Gold Bullion") to support the disclosure of mineral resources for the Granada 
property ("Property" or "Project"). The report describes the basis and methodology used for modelling and 
estimation of the Granada gold deposit located on the property from drillholes completed by Gold Bullion 
during the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 exploration programs (data received and validated on cut-off date 
of November 7th 2012). The report also presents a review of the history, geology, sample preparation and 
analysis, and data verification of the project. The report also provides recommendations for future work. 

SGS Geostat was initially commissioned by Gold Bullion in 2011 to prepare an independent estimate of 
the mineral resources of the Granada deposit and in 2012 for an update of resources with remaining back 
log and new drilling of 2012 under SGS Geostat staff supervision.  

The reader must be advised that the content of this technical report is an update of the previously filed 
report on February 4nd 2013. Some sections remain the same and the new information has been added in 
the respective sections. 

The mineral resource estimates prepared in the PEA were aiming at a high tonnage low grade scenario 
with an on-site mill with low selectivity. As market conditions were deteriorating and gold price were 
getting lower, GBB management asked SGS Geostat to prepare a rolling start open pit scenario Phase I 
capable to support adverse market conditions and relatively low gold price. This has required the 
remodelling of the mineral resources for higher selectivity with higher grade zones, leaving behind low 
grade mineralisation which was included in the previous PEA disclosure. 

2.2 PREFEASIBILITY STUDY (PFS) REPORT 

Following the completion of the updated mineral resource report, Gold Bullion Development Corporation 
("Gold Bullion") has mandated SGS Canada Inc. – Geostat (SGS Geostat) to complete a PEA study 
compliant to NI 43-101 including a Technical Report (The Report) in 2013. This report was based on the 
assumptions that the Granada gold deposit could be put in production at a rate of 7,500 tonnes per day 
over a period of 11years. An on-site concentrator with gravity-cyanidation processing was included in the 
economic study. 

Production was to come from an open pit designed to supply 6,500 tonnes per day (tpd) and an 
underground (U/G) mine supplying 1,000 tpd. The underground operation was planned to operate from a 
main ramp only, avoiding the cost of sinking a shaft. Two mining methods were proposed for the UG 
production, both as variants of the Cut-and-Fill methods. The economic results were shown in an annual 
cash flow with NPV discounted at 5.5%, sensitivity analysis, IRR, and payback period were also included 
in the report. This 2013 PEA Technical Report was filled on February 2013.

The current report presents the scenario of Phase I – Open Pit with custom milling to IamGold Westwood 
(former Doyon) mill in Abitibi. The scenario schedules to produce 550 tpd of ore over 3 years which should 
be hauled to the Iamgold mill and process in batches.

2.4 SOURCE OF INFORMATION 

The information comes from the previous technical report and the new information was developed during 
SGS Geostat deep hole drilling program and the western extension drilling campaign in 2012. 

Drillholes were surveyed by Mazac independent surveyor. 

Historical holes were integrated into the database in 2012, however decision was made by the author not 
to use the historical data of the 90's for resource estimation since drill cores were not sampled in full and it 
was not possible to carry a QA/QC program at this stage and significant difference in holes elevation was 
observed. Moreover, the new Gold Bullion drilling program covered the 90's drilling area and much more. 
Only one historic hole (90-01) to the north west was used to complete information between new deep 
drilling and the intensively drilled area.  

Information in this report is based on critical review of the documents, information and maps provided by 
the personnel of Gold Bullion and independent 3rd parties like commercial laboratories, Quebec Ministry 
of Natural Resources and surveyors.

3 Reliance on Other Experts 

The authors of this technical report are not qualified to comment on issues related to legal agreements, 
royalties, permitting, taxation and environmental matters. The authors have relied upon the 
representations and documentations supplied by the Company management and third parties. The 
authors have reviewed the mining titles, their status, the legal agreements and technical data supplied by 
Gold Bullion Development Corp, and public sources of relevant technical information. 

As for common metals, precious metal like Gold is sold on public exchanges and evaluating their prices is 
relatively straightforward. Prices of metals tend to fluctuate strongly due to 1) market conditions; 2) 
European & USA debt crisis; 3) speculation as to the future demand. For this study metal prices were 
derived from a three year weighted average obtained from index Mundi. 
http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=gold&months=60 

Comparisons were made with other recent technical reports and price assumptions available which 
showed that the price assumptions were well within range of other experts. These prices were used to 
establish a minimum cut-off grade for the Gold. 

The author relies on independent surveyor (Mazac Geoservice inc.) for the accuracy of the diamond 
drillhole positions and gyroscopic down-hole orientation surveys for the deep holes. 

The author relies on the commercial Laboratories used for the assays results. On the taxation portion, the 
author relies on Mrs. Lucie Chouinard, M. Fisc., CPA, CA Associée / Fiscalité from Deloitte Rouyn-
Noranda office.

Figure 4-2: Claims of the Granada property from GESTIM Québec April 14th 2014. 

Claims are all in good standing with renewals at variable due dates. A total of 101 claims are up for 
renewal in the 2014 year, and the rest between 2015 and 2023. The claims within the Granada Property 
are held 100% by Gold Bullion. The mining lease BM #813 covering 21.12 hectares and BM # 852 
covering 22.47 hectares have a 3% NSR payable to Mousseau Tremblay Inc. The detailed definition of the 
NSR could not be verified by the author, the author has no confirmation the NSR is registered to the MRN. 
The locations of these Mining Leases as per MRN Gestim system are presented in the following Figure 
4-3. 

There are no additional royalties to the author's knowledge.  

The claims are valid for two-year periods and convey only exploration rights, no surface rights.  The claims 
are in a good standing according to the claim system registry of Québec (Gestim). In general an average 
of $1200 work in exploration for each claim is required to maintain them in good standing. An assessment 
report must be filed with the MERN (Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles) with appropriate 
proof of exploration expenses. Grupo Moje Ltd. is responsible for the submission of the assessment work 
for Gold Bullion and will be filing the assessment work.

In writing of this report update, SGS Geostat is not aware of any additional royalties, back-in rights, 
payments or other agreements, encumbrances and environmental liabilities to which the Property could be 
subject. 

Part of the Property is recovered by historical tailings and there are tailings in one of the old open pits, 
now filled with water. The old tailings belong to the "Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles, 
secteur Mines" (orphan site). Gold Bullion is taking actions to take care of them in direct communication 
with the MERN and MDDELCC. Test work has been undertaken at SGS Lakefield Laboratories indicating 
that it is viable to produce a marketable product.  

Regarding the onsite waste pile, legacy of previous open-pit operations, Gold Bullion can use the rock for 
access road construction and it is also being used by local contractors for fill. An application for a 
Certificate of Authorization (C of A) is underway for the use of this material. Galarneau has just received 
its C of A to crush and screen aggregate.  He has a contract 70,000 tonnes and to the author's knowledge 
has a C of A for this independent operation but the Company needs another C of A for the remaining fines 
which is being prepared by Goldminds Geoservices with SODAVEX. 

Permits for exploration drilling to the north of the property are in good standing. 

The property is outside Joannès wildlife preserve located to the east. 

Figure 4-4 presents parts of the property which under urbanisation (green perimeter) exists and where 
outdoor activities (yellow perimeter) occur. 

A potential risk exists with a proposed Bill n°14 (An Act respecting the development of mineral resources 
in keeping with the principles of sustainable development) that gives more power to Municipalities and 
MRC. Since these entities do not have qualified persons to review mineral projects it is one of the main 
concerns of the mineral industry. This situation applies to all mining and exploration projects in the 
Province of Québec and is not specific to the Granada property.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 

Parts of this section were summarized from previous reports after validation for accuracy. 

5.1 TOPOGRAPHY & PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The topography is characterized by low-lying lightly forested areas separated by low ridges. The property 
is traversed by rare creeks which occupy swampy, shallow valleys. Relief is low, ranging from 274 m to 
315 m above sea level, predominantly gentle sloping (Figure 5-1). 

The property is located within the Abitibi clay belt, the remnant of the glacial Ojibway Lake. Clusters of 
isolated rock outcrops are found locally. In the main active exploration area, natural overburden is thin; 
typically ranging from 0 to 5 m in zones of interest. 

5.2 ACCESS 

Access to the property is provided by the Rouyn-Granada asphalt road, which is adjacent to the property 
and is 630 m west away from the existing gate. The connexion to the road is gained by a gravel roads and 
a regional snowmobile trail in winter.

5.3 CLIMATE 

The Granada property area and vicinity has a subarctic climate an intermediary between the temperate 
and polar climate (Dfb: Humid Continental Climate according to the Köppen climate classification). 
Summers are hot and winters are more severe than in most temperate climates. The vegetation is boreal 
and mixed in some places. The average temperature ranges between -18º C and -19º C in January to 
between 16º C and 17º C in July with cold and hot records such as -49.5º C in 1984 and 34.5º C in 1995. 
In winters it is more common to encounter temperatures around -10 and -20º C as summers become 
warmer, in general the temperatures are between 20 to 25º C, often with a Humidex index. 

Average annual rainfall is approximately 976 mm and snowfall 258 cm.  Winters are harsh and often lead 
to poor flying conditions. The practical field season is from May through October. Snowfall in November, 
December, January and February generally exceeds 55 cm per month and the wettest summer months 
are August and September with average rainfalls of 100 mm. Lake thaw usually in early April, and freeze-
up in November. These are normal climatic conditions for the Abitibi region, where exploration work is 
usually conducted year round. 

5.4 INFRASTRUCTURES  

All the required services are provided on the property. Depending of the required volume, water supply is 
available from either Pelletier and/or Beauchastel Lake. Most services and manpower necessary for a 
mining operation are already offered in Rouyn-Noranda and vicinity. Rail transportation is also available. 
Rouyn-Noranda is also serviced by an airport located 13 km in straight line from the old pit. 

A 25,000-volt transmission line parallels the above Rouyn-Granada road and can provide up to 12,000 kW 
to the property. An electrical sub-station in the range of 3,000 kW should be installed if additional power 
be required in the future. A natural gas pipeline services the borough of Granada and the headwaters to 
the La Bruere River originate along the western margin of the property. This being said, it is also known 
that additional electric power investment by Hydro Quebec for the region is required due to the booming of 
large scale high energy consuming projects and other high tonnage/low grade ventures at the 
development stage which may come to production in the coming years depending strongly of gold price 
and market conditions. 

The area of the property is sufficient for an eventual mining operation with all required installations for 
mining personnel, potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas, heap leach pad areas, 
and potential processing plant site. An aerial view of the existing infrastructures (2010 photograph) is 
presented in the Figure 5-2. The RSW-Beroma's (UMCO) mobile gold mill used in 2000 has been recently 
dismantled and removed (2013-2014). 

The existing office administrative building and conference room are made of mobile trailers. A core logging 
facility with garage and dry with washroom exist as a separate building. 

The sanitary system has been damaged by diamond drilling under responsibility of previous consultant 
and will require some changes prior to operation.

6 History 

Parts of this section were summarized from previous reports, from D. Robinson, October 2006, 
after being validated for accuracy and previous SGS reports. All numbers related to resources and 
reserves in this historical section past 2012 are not NI 43-101 compliant and investors should not 
rely upon them. 

The Granada Mine was one of the three first gold mining ventures in the Abitibi Belt of Northwestern 
Quebec along with O'Brien in Cadillac and Siscoe mine near Val D'Or. 

1922-1923: WA and RC Gamble marked out the property. During these two years, exploration work was 
done, leading to the discovery of the vein #1. 

1924-1925: McIntyre Porcupine Mines Limited dug several trenches and exploration wells to better define 
the veins, but dropped the option in 1925. 

1927-1929: Granada Rouyn Mining Company Ltd resumed the option. The company drilled a first shaft on 
a dark vein #1; it reached a depth of 129 m. The vein was developed on five levels. In 1929, a mill with a 
capacity of 63 tonnes per day was built. Vein #2 is discovered. 

1930-1935: Granada Gold Mines Ltd replaced Granada Rouyn Mining Company Ltd and deepened the 
first Shaft up to 200 m. Shaft #2 on the vein #2 was built in 1933. Latter was inclined and reached a 
vertical depth of 488 m. Lateral work stretched out 7,925 m and 11 levels. In 1934, the mill capacity was 
increased to 181 tonnes per day. From 1930 to 1935, Granada Gold Mines extracted 164,816 tonnes of 
ore at an average grade of 9.7 g/t Au and 1.5 g/t Ag. This ore came primarily from vein #2. Tailings of this 
ore were deposited in a tailing pond covering an area of approximately 50,000 m2 and located just north 
of the old mill 

1947-1950: Old Mill Gold Mines Limited carried out geophysical surveys. In 1950, shaft #1 was dewatered 
until 5th level, but no work was performed. 

1967-1968: In 1967, the claims were submitted to the crown (failure to pay taxes) and were then acquired 
by several individuals who formed the company Stanford Mines Limited. In 1968, The Gamble acquired 
claims and conducted geophysical surveys and exploratory surveys. 

1972-1980: Goldsearch acquired ownership and made some exploration work. New reserves of 294,835 
tonnes 12g/t Au the vein #2 were then calculated. 

1981-1991: In 1981, Kewagama Gold Mines (hereinafter by KWG Resources Inc.) and Goldsearch signed 
an agreement that allows Kewagama Gold Mines to acquire a 50% stake in the project Granada. In 1982, 
the mine was dewatered and underground and surface rehabilitation works were made. In 1983, 
Goldsearch obtained a certificate of approval for the development of the mine and reported to the vein #2 
reserves 102,512 tonnes to 13.37 g/t Au and 3.43 g/t Ag. During the years 1989-1990, 27 surface drill-
holes were performed as well as geophysical surveys throughout the property. In 1991, SEG Exploration 
Inc. acquired Goldsearch stakes. 

1992: At the beginning of the taxation year 1992, KWG Resources drilled 69 holes totalling 2,973 m on the 
veins #1 and veins #2. During the same summer, KWG Resources and Exploration SEG performed 
stripping work of 4,078 m2 in order to make a bulk sample. 

1993: July 16, 1993, MRN issued to KWG Resources Inc. and SEG Resources Inc. Mining Lease 813 
which covers most of the mineral resources of the Granada mine.  

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 43
 

In July 1993, Granada Resources becomes 100% owner of the Granada property by buying Exploration 
SEG and KWG Resources stakes. In May 1994, the agreement was signed giving exploitation operation 
to KWG Resources. 

Between 1992 and 1994, an overall assessment of the economic potential of Granada mine took place, 
along a resource estimate of the property undertaken by the firm A.C.A. Howe (1990, 1993a, 1993b and 
1994). 

1994: Granada Resources extracted a bulk sample of 87,311 tonnes grading 5.17 g/t Au pit #1. This 
generated 139,856 tonnes of waste have been piled on a sterile tailings located east of the pit #1. 

1995: Met-Chem Pellemon produced an assessment of an operating vein #2 project through two open pits 
shallow (26 m). The amount of ore contained in these pits is estimated at 105,000 tonnes at an average 
grade of 3.45 g/t Au. 

1996: Granada Resources extracted a bulk sample of 22,095 tonnes grading 3.46 g/t Au pit #2. This has 
also generated 4,309 tonnes of waste have increased the size of a sterile dumps to 1.2 hectares. In 
addition, 8,822 tons of ore were crushed and used in a trial separation using an optical sorting machine 
("ore sorter," rented from a firm in Denver, Colorado). In principle, based on the color of crushed 
fragments, the unit separates fragments of quartz veins (high gold content) and fragments of rock (low 
gold content). The results of this trial have not been reported and the unit was returned to Denver. The 
crushed material resulting from this test was the sterile dumps located northwest of the pit #1. 

1997: KWG Resources Inc. sold 100% of Granada Resources Inc. (a subsidiary company of KWG 
Resources Inc.) to Mousseau Tremblay Inc. (MTI). 

1998: August 16, 1998, a commercial contract of sale and purchase of ore was made by Mousseau 
Tremblay Inc. Company RSW-Béroma. The latter wished to use the site Granada mine to demonstrate its 
concept Factory Modular Concentration ore Gold (UMCO). 

1999: On 31 August 1999, RSW-Béroma and MTI applied to the Ministry of Environment Quebec for a 
certificate of authorization (C of A) in order to install a UMCO on Granada mine site and to conduct the 
following operations: 

• extract 105,000 tonnes of ore pits #2 (55,000 tonnes) and #2A (50,000 tonnes); 
• treat ore in the UMCO; 
• carry out cyanides destruction (by S02/air method) in the final waste before its release in the pit 

#1. 

On 21 September 1999, the certificate of authorization 7610-08-01-70063-24 was issued to this effect. 

From September 1999 to January 2000, RSW-Béroma build its UMCO prototype. It is a plant with a 
capacity of 175 tonnes per day, using the method of direct cyanidation with gold precipitation by zinc 
powder (Merrill-Crowe process). Concurrently with the construction of the UMCO, operation of the pit #2 
took place between October 1999 and January 2000. This generated 55,000 tonnes of ore and 121,000 
tonnes of waste. Added sterile rock extended the tailings pond to an area of 1.8 hectares. The ore was 
processed in the newly installed UMCO to demonstrate its effectiveness. On 16 September 1999, a plan 
to restore the Granada mine site at the end of the planned operations was submitted to the Ministry of 
Natural Resources of Quebec. This plan was approved by the MRNQ November 7, 2000. 

2000: From February to October 2000, 27,313 tonnes of ore were processed in I'UMCO Granada. The 
total production was 2,032 ounces of gold at an average grade of 2.51 g/t Au with a recovery of 92.2%. 
The UMCO had demonstrated its ability to achieve excellent recovery, despite a relatively low mineral 
content. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 44
 

On 19 July 2000, an initial agreement for the sale of sterile Mousseau Tremblay Inc. operated between 
RN and Aggregates Inc. 

On 23 July 2000, the MRN issues in Granada Resources mining lease 852 adjacent, east 813 mining 
lease. 852 mining lease contains extensions to the east of all the veins of the Granada mine. 

2001: January 1, 2001, the company merged Granada society Mousseau Tremblay Inc. Granada mining 
property was transferred to Mousseau Tremblay Inc. and becomes the sole owner of said property. 

Fall 2001, the UMCO capacity was increased from 175 to 250 tonnes per day following addition of larger 
semi-autogenous mill. From December 2001 to March 2002, 24,638 additional tonnes of ore from the pit 
#2 were treated in the UMCO. Total production was 1,122 ounces of gold at an average grade of 1.80 g/t 
Au with a recovery of 78.6%. The lower recovery than during the first phase of processing is explained by 
the lower ore grade. 

2003: an intensive waste testing program was instituted to obtain a certificate of authorization to operate 
waste rock. This certificate was received May 29, 2003. Certificate contained certain covenants that limit 
the use of waste, especially fine particles less than 2 mm. 

2005: the agreement between Mousseau Tremblay Inc. and Agrégats R-N, which allows the latter to 
exploit the mine tailings of Granada, was renewed on 1 March 2005 for a period of five years, until March 
1, 2010. 

2006: the Granada UMCO remained inactive from March 2002 to May 2006. Due to a rise in gold prices, 
the firm Consolidated Big Valley Resources (CBVR) approached RSW-Béroma to buy the UMCO, in early 
2006. An agreement was signed in July 2006. Meanwhile, in March 2006, a lease-purchase of the 
property was signed by Mousseau Tremblay Inc. and CBVR. This agreement allowed CBVR to resume 
activities that RSW-Béroma was interrupted in 2002. The agreement also provides to CBVR the possibility 
of buying mining leases 813 and 852 which represent the main Granada mine site. The contract provide 
use of all facilities available on site (including pit #1 to store the residues resulting from the treatment of 
ores in CBVR plant) by CBVR. 

It should be noted that the firm CBVR changed its name to Gold Bullion Development Corporation (GBDC) 
in February 5, 2007. 

Mining activities resulting from the agreement signed in 2006 between Mousseau Tremblay Inc. and Gold 
Bullion Development Corporation were as follows: 

The UMCO was put into operation on 23 May 2006, with the start shakedown testing. At first, it deals a 
small amount of ore from the pit #2 (approximately 3,000 tonnes) which had been left behind by RSW-
Béroma at the end of its operations in March 2002; 

At the same time GBDC began operating Vein #2 in the open pit #2A, located in Test Pit #2 operated by 
RSW-Béroma in 1999-2000 . At the origin, pit #2A exploitation would generate 50,000 tonnes of ore and 
70,000 tonnes of waste. However GBDC decided to use a broader and deeper pit in order to recover 
some gold veins presenting high in the roof and the wall of the main mineralized zone. Consequently, pit 
#2A exploitation produced 141,000 tons of ore and 288,000 tonnes of waste. Ore pit #2A was treated in 
the UMCO at the rate of 250 tons per day; 

Waste was added to the existing dumps. The addition of the 288,000 tonnes of waste has the effect of 
increasing the area of the tailings pond, which rose from 1.8 hectares to 3.2 hectares; 

Plant rejects were pumped into the pit #1, after cyanide destruction. At the end of operations RSW-
Béroma in March 2002, the pit #1 contained approximately 52 000 tonnes of solid waste occupying a 
volume of 16,800 m3. This corresponds to approximately 21% of the volume of the pit #1 (80 000 m3) as

measured by RSW-Béroma who performed the complete emptying of 21 September to 21 November 
1999. This means that the resumption by GBDC in May 2006, the pit #1 could still accept nearly 196,000 
tons of treatment plant rejects; 

In addition to the ore from Granada property GBDC planned to eventually treat ore from other mining 
properties located in Abitibi. To do so, the firm filled in February 2007, a certificate of authorization for the 
collection of a bulk sample of 40,000 tonnes of the Val St-Gilles property, located north of La Sarre. This 
ore was sent to Granada and treated in the UMCO. 

In May 2007, the MRN accepted the Mousseau Tremblay and RSW-Béroma restoration plan. Gold Bullion 
paid the deposit guarantee of $ 171.800 January 23, 2011. 

On 3 June, 2009, at the request of Gold Bullion, the 7610-08-01-70063-24 C of A for the operation of the 
treatment plant is revoked. 

On November 25, 2010, Mousseau Tremblay Inc. transfers to Gold Bullion Development Corp. GBDC) all 
of its 26 mining claims (claims) and its two mining concessions on the mining property Granada. 

On 1 February, 2011, Mousseau Tremblay sent to MERN for a certificate of release of Granada mine site 
and a requested for transfer of responsibility Mousseau Tremblay and RSW-Béroma Gold Bullion 
pursuant to section 232.10 of the Act mines. 

The November 7, 2011, Mousseau Tremblay Inc. wrote a letter to Gold Bullion in which it transfers the 
rights and privileges conferred by the certificate of authorization 7610-08-01-70063-25 for recovery of 
waste on the Granada property. 

The November 21, 2011, Mousseau Tremblay sent to the MDDEP an assignment of the certificate of 
authorization. The application closed before conclusion due to lack of information. 

In April 2nd, 2012, SGS Canada Inc. produced a resources estimation of the Granada gold project were 
simply obtained by adding resources in blocks with an estimated grade above any given cut-off. Resource 
tonnage of a block was: 5mx5mx5mx2.8t/m3 = 350t for a full block (100% below overburden/topo surface).

The resource took into consideration the same open-pit shell than the one used on the previous resource 
estimation report (April 2nd, 2012). In order to have an appraisal of resources within a potential open pit, a 
whittle pit optimizer has been run with the following parameters. An in-pit resource within a Whittle-

On 14 May 2013, Mousseau Tremblay sent to MDDEFP a new transfer requested in Gold Bullion 
Certificate 7610-08-01-70063-25 authorization for recovering the sterile. Gold Bullion refused the transfer 
of C of A to reapply for the treatment of C of A by gravity tailings for less than 2mm. 

During the summer of 2013, RSW-Béroma finished dismantling its factory in accordance with the terms of 
the agreement of 14 November 2006 concerning the rental of its factory in Gold Bullion. 

On 15 May 2013, the company Galarneau sent a certificate request for a crushing and enhancement of

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

Parts of this section were summarized from previous reports mainly D. Robinson, October 2006 and 
Couture, et al., 1997 after validation for accuracy with additional opinions and observations of the author.  

7.1 REGIONAL 

The Granada Mine property lies within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt of the Superior Province (Figure 7-1 
and Figure 7-2). The oldest rocks in the immediate area are schists and migmatites belonging to the 
Pontiac Group. These are located from 100-200 metres south of the property. They are overlain by 
conglomerates, sandstones and siltstones of the Temiscaming Group. The contact between the latter and 
Temiscaming sediments exposed for over 400 m as an intensely altered 10-75 m wide shear zone. This 
group is capped by the Larder Lake Break rocks comprising carbonate rocks, talc-chlorite and chlorite, 
and minor sandstone interbeds. The Larder Lake Break rocks were laid down on Temiscaming 
paleosurfaces and thus belong to that group. The Temiscaming Group is in contact to the north with the 
Blake River Group. The contact area is composed of clastic sedimentary rocks (source to the south) with 
intercalated volcaniclastics and sediments derived from Blake River volcanism.

Figure 7-2: Regional geology (after ET91-04, MRNQ) 

7.2 LOCAL  

The Granada Mine property is situated within rocks of the Temiscaming group, on the south limb of the 
regional east-west trending Granada synclinorium whose axial trace is located south of the Cadillac Fault 
(Figure 7-2). The property is underlain principally by east-west-trending, north-dipping interbedded-
polymictic conglomerate, porphyry-pebble conglomerate, greywacke and siltstone-mudstone of the 
Granada Formation. It has been reported by Wilson in 1962 that the conglomerate units had different 
fragment compositions on opposing limbs of the Granada synclinorium. Conglomerate on the north limb 
(La Brure Formation) is characterized by jasper fragments which are absent from the south limb and 
contain scattered magnetite pebbles (Granada Formation). 

The Granada Formation is intruded by northerly-trending Proterozoic diabase dykes, felsic dykes, sills and 
stocks. Sill-like syenitic bodies are concentrated throughout the immediate area of the mine property. The 
syenite bodies are aphyric to porphyritic with up to 10% tabular centimetre-scale feldspar phenocrysts in 
an aphyric to slightly porphyritic groundmass. The syenite bodies are slightly oblique (040°-050°) to 
bedding (050°-060°) and exhibit schistosity (045°-060°). On alkali-silica diagrams the syenitic bodies show 
four compositional facies: monzonite, syenite, quartzmonzonite and granite, similar to that of most other 
Temiscaming intrusive rocks from Ontario as sourced from Siriunas, 1994, in previous report. The

principal structural feature in the area is a penetrative schistosity affecting all lithologies. This fabric is 
usually parallel to stratigraphy. The flattening intensity of pebbles and cobbles increases from south to 
north towards the Cadillac Fault. Locally, the intensity of the regional schistosity strengthens into discrete 
shear zones that are emphasized by hydrothermal alteration. In the area of the mine workings, there is a 
prominent zone of deformation, hydrothermal alteration and quartz veining which extending over 5 km. 
Figure 7-3 presents the local geology with the historic property outline (much smaller than the current 
property). 

Structural analysis from outcrop data indicate that the Temiscaming sedimentary rocks are isoclinally 
folded about east-west trending, with a gently east plunging fold axes. This early fold pattern has been 
subsequently modified by a set of north-westerly trending folds. A series of late northeast trending faults 
horizontally offset the stratigraphy, the quartz veining and the alteration by a magnitude of 30-50 m 
typically displaying a dextral motion but sinistral is also observed. All the lithologies in the area of the 
Granada property, with the exception of the Pontiac Group, are metamorphosed to greenschist facies.

7.3 PROPERTY 

The Cadillac Fault traverses the northern part of the property. Within the Granada mine site itself a parallel 
set of shears (Granada Shear Zone) occur over a zone of 500 m in width. The shears are characterized by 
intense sericite, iron carbonate plus minor chlorite alteration with disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite and 
host quartz veins and stringers. The veins comprise boudinaged or en-echelon quartz lenses within the 
sediments and more continuous veins in the syenite intrusive bodies. A series of northeasterly trending 
sigmoidal faults occur between the Cadillac Fault and the Granada Shear Zone due to late shearing. This 
late shearing also imparted the fracturing and dilatancy in the quartz veins (Howe, 1994). The following 
figure presents mapping and geological interpretation of individual veins and mineralized zones with the 
trace of the NNE faults showing with displacement of the mineralized zones accordingly. 

 
Figure 7-7: Detailed mapping and geological interpretation in plan by KWG in 1992

and thin mineralized structures.

7.4 MINERALIZATION 

7.4.1 GENERAL 
As presented in the Figure 7-8, gold mineralization is hosted by east-west trending smokey grey, fractured 
quartz veins and stringers. Free gold occurs at vein margins or within fractures of the quartz veins or 
sulphides. Late northeasterly-trending sigmoidal faults also host high grade gold mineralization. Accessory 
minerals include tourmaline, carbonate, chlorite, and disseminated sulphides. Pyrite is the dominant 
sulphide typically occurring within the immediate wall rock to the quartz veins. Minor pyrite does occur 
within the veins themselves. Additional sulphides such as chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite sphalerite and galena 
are present in trace amounts. Fuchsite (chromium mica) is present in the immediate wall rock to the quartz 
veins.  

7.4.2 DESCRIPTION OF MORE RELEVANT VEINS AS PER HISTORICAL WORKS  
7.4.2.1 Vein #1 

Vein # 1 was the original discovery vein on the property. It extends for 600 m across the property. Vein 
width can vary from greater than 1 m to a couple of centimetres. Gold grades are very erratic from nil to 
greater than 100 g/t Au. Shaft #1 was sunk to exploit this vein during the underground operations of 1930-
1935. The vein only contributed to approximately 5% of the gold production during this period due to the 
vein's erratic grade. The vein was later the target of open pit operations by KWG Resources during 1993 
and 1994. 

7.4.2.2 Vein #2 

Vein #2 is more correctly described as a mineralized zone of two parallel quartz veins, one in the hanging 
wall and the other in the footwall, separated by a zone of millimetre-scale quartz veinlets in altered 
conglomerate. The two main veins are lenticular, locally measuring greater than 1 m in width with metre-
scale portions thinning to several centimetres. The hanging wall vein is generally thicker, more continuous 
and of higher grade (6 to 10 g/t Au) than the footwall vein. The hanging wall vein, plus associated veinlets 
and pyritic alteration halo averages 3 m in thickness. The intervening zone of quartz veinlets averages 5 m 
in width and is locally auriferous in the order of 0.7 to 0.8 g/t Au. The footwall vein is generally boudinaged 
with associated veinlets and pyritic alteration halo averaging 2 m in thickness yielding on average assay 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 57
 

grades of 4 to 5 g/t Au. The entire vein #2 zone averages 10 m in width averaging 3.5 to 4 g/t Au. This 
vein system was the principal sources of ore for the historical underground operations and open pit 
production for KWG Resources. The bulk of the historical underground production came from this zone. 
The heterogeneous distribution of gold grade along strike within the Vein #2 zone resulted in the selective 
mining of the zone from two shallow pits by RSW-BÉROMA in the year 2000. A western extension of the 
#2 zone was partially drill defined by KWG Resources in 1995 with the proposed pit referred to as 2B. 
RSW-BÉROMA calculated a non NI 43-101 compliant geological resource of 28,501 tonnes at 2.4 g/t Au 
(Trudel, 2000). 

7.4.2.3 Vein #3 

Vein # 3 was discovered during underground exploration by KWG Resources while drifting on the fifth 
level between Vein #1 and #2. It is described as a large shear zone containing numerous quartz veinlets 
hosting free gold.  

7.4.2.4 Vein #5 

Vein #5 is the most continuous vein of the Granada property. It has been traced by drillholes from surface 
to the seventh level of the mine (213 m vertical). It is hosted within the conglomerate along the northern 
contact with a porphyritic syenite sill. On surface, trench samples of Vein #5 yielded weakly anomalous 
assays of 0.51 g/t Au over 15 m. Underground development reported visible gold when the vein was 
encountered.  

7.4.2.5 Vein A & B 

Both Veins A and B were discovered after underground operation ceased. Little descriptive information is 
available for these zones. Vein A outcrops on surface just east of the waste rock pile at 900E and 425N in 
a trench.  

7.4.3 THE NEW APPROACH – THE GBB APPROACH 
Gold Bullion's first approach was to look at developing the property as an open pit large tonnage with 
lower grade operation instead of mining individual veins. The higher value of gold supports this approach. 
The drilling and exploration focused on drilling the whole mineralized package and analyzing all material 
between the veins. An Example of coarse gold observed in a small vein at Granada in drillhole GR-10-62 
is pictured in Figure 7-9. 

The mineralization zones in this report include the veins, the stockworks, the alteration zones with 
disseminated gold in sulphides is shown in the typical cross-sections in the following figures. 

 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 58
 

Figure 7-9: Gold mineralization in Quartz vein 

The gold grade at Granada varies due to coarse free gold in the mineralized structures. Apparently 
discontinuous, the mineralized structures are relatively continuous as demonstrated by assay grade 
continuity on the following cross section and the geometry of the underground workings. Due to the 
continuity of the structures, it was decided to remodel the mineralization in thin, higher-grade zones for 
more concentrated mining as shown in Figure 7-12. 

The mineralized zones are being cut in blocks which are shifted in majority to the north. 

In cross-sectional view such as Figure 7-11 presenting section 18 east of shaft #1, the extent of the vein is 
over 250 m and supported by drillhole data. An important point to mention is the fact that previous 
operators did not extract all the gold. It is possible to see the drift projection in grey into the foot wall vein.

Figure 7-13: Plan view of historical drift and pit #2 with trace of NNE faults in colors. 

The above figure demonstrates the segmentation of the mineralized zones between faults. Adding 
together the segments shows a length in the order of 540 m in an easterly direction from historical 
workings. With the additional 2012 drilling this mineralized length was increased to 1100 m. The old 
workings also show the existence of mineralization 500 m down plunge as shown in previous cross-
sections.  

The sub-vertical NNE faults affect the plunge and the author believes it is steeper with depth as per 
historical records of fault intersections in underground workings and observations in cross-sections. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 60
 

The thickness of the conglomerate unit hosting the mineralized zones is over 300 metres. Within this 
package, it has been possible to observe different distinct mineralized zones with disseminated gold 
grades between the zones as shown in the previous cross-sections (Figure 7-11 and Figure 7-12). 

Most of the economic mineralization on the Granada property is related to late quartz veining. Several sets 
of veins have been recognized on the property. From north to south, historically the more important vein 
sets are referred to as: 5, B, A, 1, 3 and 2. The veins trend generally east-west direction and dip between 
35° to 50° to the north. They are sub-concordant with sedimentary contacts. Quartz veins within syenite 
dykes and sills tend to follow the trend of the unit. The author has observed gold grains along a cobble 
from conglomerate surface outcrop within a dilatation zone across the schistosity. Mineralization is also 
associated with the presence of porphyry. 

A portion of the gold occurs as free coarse gold while the remaining is mostly associated with sulphides. 
Additional discussion on the gold characteristics can be found in the section 13 of this report.

8 Deposit Types 

The Granada deposit is a quartz-vein mesothermal gold deposit hosted by late Achaean Temiscaming 
sedimentary rock and younger syenite porphyry dykes dated at 2673±3 Ma as per works by Davis in 1991. 
The dykes belong to a late tectonic alkaline magmatic suite that hosts the mesothermal gold 
mineralization in the Kirkland Lake and Timmins gold camps of Ontario and also of Duparquet which is 
north of Rouyn-Noranda, in the Province of Quebec. The mineralization is mainly confined to the 
conglomerate/greywacke package of event S1 of the Granada Formation as shown in Figure 8-1.                    

The exploration model consists of shallow gold resources realistic to initiate open pit mining while 
extension at depth of the high grade structures continues to be tested for eventual underground operation.

9 Exploration 

The company had requested an analysis of the mineral potential across the property by spectral analysis.  
The company carried out geological and structural studies of its D2 D3 group which are Gold Bullion 
properties in Rouyn-Noranda area. These studies were performed by EarthMetrix Technologies Inc. 

Photonic Knowledge studied Granada drill cores with the objective of assisting in the interpretation and 
localization of mineralized and alteration zones using spectrometry. The company also completed a bulk 
sample in 2007. 

9.1 GEOLOGICAL & STRUCTURAL STUDY BY EARTHMETRIX 

On behalf of Gold Bullion Development Corp., a geological and structural study has been realized on the 
D2D3 group of properties (see Figure 9-1) using available data including assessment work files coming 
from the MRNF (Quebec), satellite imagery and data covering the property coming from different sensors 
(including SPOT-5 and WorldView-1) compiled by Technologies EarthMetrix inc. between January 2011 
and June 2011. 

The D2D3 Group of Properties consist of 3 separate claims blocks totaling 107.33km2: Kekeko South 
property (12.95 km2) in Beauchastel and Montbeillard townships, Beauchastel Syenite property (49.23 
km2) in Beauchastel, Rouyn, Montbeillard and Bellecombe townships, Adanac Extension property (45.15 
km2) in Rouyn, Joannes and Bellecombe townships. The D2D3 Group of Properties are situated just 
southwest, south and southeast of the town of Rouyn-Noranda (downtown) in Abitibi-Temiscamingue 
(NTS Sheet Map 32D02/32D03). Major secondary roads and all weather gravel roads traverse the 
properties. 

The main objective of this study was to determine optimal exploration targets for the discovery of 
significant gold mineralization on the D2D3 group of properties from available data (Assessment work files 
from the MRNF), structural interpretations using the technology developed by Technologies EarthMetrix 
Inc. by integrating all results coming from different interpretations. Maps are defined by the property limits. 

This report presents results obtained from this study, mainly exploration targets areas that should be 
considered for more detailed exploration on the D2D3 Group of properties. Alain Moreau has briefly visited 
the properties in June 2011.

The list of targets will have to be visited in the field prior to drilling and this will be included in the 
recommendation section. 

To the authors' knowledge, other than a limited stripping and surface mapping north of existing pit #2 no 
significant rudimentary exploration work has been conducted; not including exploration drilling. 

9.2 BULK SAMPLE 2007 

A 140,000 tonnes bulk sample was processed by Gold Bullion in 2007 from an open pit at the Granada 
Mine, of which 30,000 tonnes were processed using an on-site mill. The average gold grade from this 
large sample was 1.62 g/t with a 90-percent rate gold recovery. The waste from this bulk sample, along 
with the waste stockpile from past bulk sampling programs at the Granada mine by previous operators 
were also assayed and returned an average grade of 1.75 g/t Au. This confirms the presence of gold 
mineralization between the vein structures, which trend east-west as one large overall structure.  

The Company management claim that the bulk sample and Phase 1 drill results confirmed that gold at 
Granada is not just confined to the quartz-carbonate vein network but is also present in significant 
amounts within the iron-rich sulphurized wall rock (the material between the veins).  

The details of the bulk samples were not provided to the author and the numbers could not be verified. 

However the author agrees with this disclosure of the company regarding the occurrence of gold 
mineralization between the main veins at Granada as observed in assay results and visible gold found in 
drill core.

9.3 EXPLORATION 2007 – 2012 

From 2007 to 2012 exploration holes were drilled and are discussed in the drilling section. 

9.4 EXPLORATION 2013 

In early 2013, SGS discovered shallow high grade zones using assay results from previous exploration 
campaigns. In May 2013, Gold Bullion Development Corporation contracted SGS Geostat to perform 
channel sampling on the Granada Gold property. The campaign focused on developing the newly 
discovered high grade zones identified in the following drillholes: GR-12-413, GR-10-21, GR-11-380, GR-
11-313 GR-10-104, GR-10-105, GR-10-125, GR-10-97, GR-10-53 and GR-10-100. 

In order to confirm shallow high grade zones, a total of 8 test pits were mechanically shovelled on the 
property. Pits are located on existing drill pads of the above mentioned holes. Excavation was done to 
bedrock at each pit in order to take samples. Sample channels were drawn to cross the mineralized zone 
(identify as Quartz Veins zone) and neighbouring sterile zones. Channels were divided in 1 metre 
samples, surveyed and sent to Accurassay laboratory for XRF analysis. For QA/QC validation, 3 blanks 
and 2 standards were inserted. A total of 53 samples (including blanks and standards) were sent to the 
lab. 

Assays from channel samples taken from the trenched areas varied from 22.42 g/t Au over 1.04 metres to 
0.01 g/t Au over 0.82 metres. The higher grades were from samples in the eastern section of the extended 
LONG Bars zone. Significant visible gold was also encountered very near surface (at a depth of 10 
centimetres) in the western area of the trenching.

10 Drilling 

The Company has carried out three phases of exploration starting in 2009, another in 2010 and the third in 
2011. All exploration work, especially drilling has been done under supervision and management of the 
Company's previous consultant. The drilling was done by a diamond-drill using NQ core size. 

10.1 PHASE 1 

The company drilled 25 shallow holes in the Phase 1 drill program (see Figure 10-1) from December 2009 
to January 2010 at the Granada Gold Property. A total of 2,817 metres was drilled and was successful at 
testing for structures. The program also revealed a possible substantial new discovery of shallow depth 
mineralization northeast of the historic and past producing Pits #2 West (Pit 2A) and #2 East (Pit 2B).  

 
Figure 10-1: Layout of the phase 1 drilling campaign 

Drilling highlights include drillhole GR 10-17 located over 300 metres from the edge of Pit #2 East, 
intersected 65.5 metres of 1.21 g/t Au gold (from 3.5 to 69 metres depth) within a wider interval grading 
0.95 g/t Au over 99.2 metres. This hole, reported March 1 2010, was collared 103 metres southeast of 
GR-10-15 which returned 73.8 meters of 0.88 g/t Au as reported February 8 2010.  

Three (3) other Phase 1 holes in the company named "LONG Bars Zone Eastern Extension" also came 
back with encouraging results. GR-10-18, collared 125 metres southwest of GR-10-17, intersected 19 
metres of 1.02 g/t Au. GR-10-14 and GR-10-16 returned lower gold values over shorter intersections but 
confirmed the continuity of mineralization in this newly discovered area.  Some highlights of that campaign 
are: 

GR-10-21 Fifty (50) metres outside the western boundary of the zone and nearly 
800 metres from GR-10-17, intersected 65.5 metres grading 0.72 g/t Au (from 
3.50 to 69 metres) including 20 metres of 2.20 g/t Au. 

GR-10-13 located between Pit #1 and Pit #2 inside the zone, returned 27.75 metres 
grading 1.27 g/t Au within a wider interval of 66 metres grading 0.56 g/t Au;

GR-10-12 located north of Pit #2 East and 300 metres southwest of GR-10-17, 
intersected 68.8 metres of 1.07 g/t Au (from 16.2 to 85 metres) including 44 
metres grading 1.54 g/t Au and 14 metres grading 4.28 g/t Au; 

GR-09-08 46 metres east-southeast of GR-10-12, returned 32.5 metres of 1.27 g/t Au, 
also at shallow depth, within a wider interval of 0.92 g/t Au over 51 metres; 

GR-09-05 75 metres northeast of GR-09-08, graded 0.92 g/t Au over 31 metres between 
92 and 123 metres; 

GR-09-02 at the western edge of the waste pile east of Pit #1, returned 32.5 metres of 
1.74 g/t Au between 15.5 and 48 metres; 

GR-09-01 25 metres north of GR-09-02, intersected 14.7 metres of 1.60 g/t Au over a 
wider interval of 61.7 metres averaging 0.56 g/t Au between 6.3 meters and 68 
metres 

10.2 PHASE 2/PHASE 3 DRILLING 

The Company launched a 20,000 metre Phase 2 drill program at the Granada Gold Project in early May 
2010, which was extended by 5,000 metres in September due to encouraging early results. The two-
pronged strategy was to both a) conduct infill drilling as well as further exploratory drilling within the main 
zone as a first step toward an eventual NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate and b) significantly expand 
the overall LONG Bars Zone mineralized area. Some deeper drilling was also planned, and has taken 
place, within both the main zone and the Eastern Extension in order to test the Granada structure at 
depth. This was done in part since most drilling at the property both historically and in Gold Bullion's 
Phase 1 program has been shallow (predominantly less than 100 metres vertical depth). 

Gold Bullion Development has completed nearly 11,000 metres of Phase 3 drilling at its Granada Gold 
Property as of January 21, 2011, with Phase 2 and Phase 3 drilling intersecting new mineralized 
structures throughout the LONG Bars Zone (main Granada mineralized structure package). From that 
drilling mineralization remains open in all directions at Granada.  

In November 2011, Gold Bullion reported the discovery of significant mineralization northeast and 
southeast of its LONG Bars Zone and the Granada Gold Property as a whole. 

GR-10-108, collared 30 metres north of GR-10-55, delivered the longest mineralized intersection to date 
at Granada (356.6 metres @ 0.60 g/t Au), returned an interval of 141.7 metres grading 0.70 g/t Au.  

One of the goals of Phase 3 drilling was to expand the continuity of the feldspar porphyry and quartz 
veining in this particular area. GR-10-108 was collared 150 metres northeast of the main zone. 

Meanwhile, nearly 500 metres south of GR-10-108, GR-10-86 returned 84.6 metres grading 1.00 g/t Au 
within a total near-surface interval of 127.5 metres (4.5 metres to 132 metres) grading 0.76 g/t Au as 
reported November 19, 2010. This hole was drilled toward the south and was collared approximately 180 
metres southeast of Gold Bullion's Preliminary Block Model. The discovery of near-surface mineralization 
in the deep-south of the Eastern Extension is considered a significant development. 

All Phase 2 drilling was completed by late October 2010 and more than 20% of the Phase 3 program was 
completed by January 21, 2011.

Gold Bullion reported September 9, 2010 that their previous geological consultant had observed visible 
gold and disseminated sulphides, along with large alteration zones, within feldspar porphyry in numerous 
holes drilled in Phase 2.  

The fact that porphyry is hosting gold is an interesting development for the Granada deposit as a 2006 
Technical Report on the property stated that all economic mineralization at Granada was related to quartz 
veining. 

Other results; GR-10-53, collared 88 metres southeast of GR-10-41  and near Pit #2 East, intersected 
68.3 metres of 2.16 g/t Au, including a high grade section of 4.60 g/t Au over 26 metres, within a wider 
near-surface interval of 110.5 metres (3.5 metres to 114 metres depth) grading 1.34 g/t Au. This hole was 
drilled perpendicular to Vein #2 and is believed to closely approximate true width. Alteration dominated by 
intense sericitization and silicification was encountered in this hole along with quartz veining and abundant 
pyrite.

Most of the drillholes have been drilled at a roughly perpendicular angle to the veins. The core lengths are 
generally 85% to 90% of the true width for drillholes drilled south-southwest. The holes which were drilled 
southeast have approximately 75% true width as per current modelling. The shallow holes are closer to 
true width; deep holes were drilled on a steeper angle. 

The previous consultant responsible for the execution and management of the Phase 1, 2 and 3 drilling 
campaigns for the Gold Bullion misjudged the amount of work, drilled holes at incorrect orientations, and 
drilled holes outside the property boundary. The author is confident that most of the hole collars were 
drilled at the right place and that the core is representative of what is in the ground at Granada. It is 
important to recall that not all drillholes were used in the current resources estimation; only holes of which 
the author and his colleagues were able to validate. 

Figure 10-2 presents the holes drilled and the holes which have been used in the first resource estimate.

10.3 2012 DRILLING PROGRAM - NORTH AND WEST EXTENSION 2012 PROJECT 

The deep and shallow drilling programs (Figure 10-4) were initiated by GBB in 2012 under Claude 
Duplessis recommendation to test structures and gold mineralization presence on the north and west 
extension of the Granada Property.  The spring 2012 drilling program was intended to enlarge the gold 
mineralization envelope of the expanded LONG Bars zone resource to the north at depth and near surface 
to the west. 

The original drill plan on the northern deep drilling area was designed to have three deep holes (DUP-12-
01, DUP-12-02 and DUP-12-03) each hole with one wedge. The program commenced with planned 
drillhole DUP-12-03.  Due to excessive deviation, this hole was consequently abandoned at 378m. In 
order to continue the drill program, hole DUP-12-03A, located 400 metres NNE (12° North) of hole GR-11-
390 was drilled 25 metres to the west of DUP-12-03 to a final depth of 1347 m. Following this, three 
wedge holes W1, W2 and W3 were placed into DUP-12-03A. 

Hole DUP-12-02, located 830 metres NNE (24° North) of hole GR-11-390 was drilled down to 1593 m with 
one wedge added, W1. 

These deep drillholes have expanded the mineralization by 650 metres to the north and an additional 600 
metres in depth where the mineralization envelope remains open for expansion. 

Due to the success of DUP-12-03A, DUP-12-02 and the associated wedges demonstrating continuation at 
depth of gold mineralization the drill was reassigned to the western extension to further evaluate near-
surface mineralization. Planned hole DUP-12-01 was put on hold for these reasons. The observation of

visible gold and typical alteration zones present in the western extension holes GR-11-375 and GR-11-
363 from the backlog program have helped to establish the new targets in this area. 

 
Figure 10-4: New 2012 Diamond Drillholes Location Map on Granada Property 

A total of 8339.25 metres in 23 holes was drilled on the Granada Property. The drilling contractor was 
Landdrill International Ltd. of Notre-Dame-Du-Nord, Quebec, which provided two surface diamond drill rigs 
(Marcotte Hydraulic model). 

The drilling started on March 5, 2012 and concluded on July 6, 2012. All the drillholes were orientated 
south and drilled with different ranges of dip and length (see Table 10-2 and Table 10-3 for more details). 
Deep holes were spotted and surveyed by Mazac Geoservices Inc and the GR-12 holes were located by 
SGS Geologists using a handheld GPS.  Down-hole oriention surveys were carried out by both Gyro and 
Reflex EZ-trac for the deep holes and only Reflex EZ-trac for the western extension holes.

This drill results confirm specific high grade zones at depth with thickness and grade suitable for 
underground mining. Down hole core length is close to true thickness and uncut. 

10.4 CORE RECOVERY 

In this project, the core recovery is about 99% with some losses generally occurring in the beginning of the 
hole and also near shears or faults zones. Rock Quality Designation (RQD) measurements indicate that 
the rocks units observed in the Granada property are very competent.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

11.1 CONTEXT 

The previous consultant responsible of the drilling campaign management and execution did not prepare a 
formal report on the subject from 2009 to 2011. This section will present what the author has been able to 
discover on the subject. From the beginning of author's involvement in the project it was clear that not all 
information would be retrieved. This initiated an extensive independent sampling program, the details of 
which are available in the data verification section of this report. 

11.2 DRILL CORE SAMPLING PROTOCOL 

During the 2009 to 2011 drill campaign, samples of NQ size core were systematically assayed for gold 
and occasionally for arsenic and silver with multi-element packages. 

All core samples assays from the exploration programs were performed by 4 various laboratories: 

• Lab-Expert in 2009-2010 
• Swastika in 2010 
• ALS-Chemex in 2010-2011 
• Accurassay in 2010-2011 

These laboratories have facilities in Quebec, Ontario and BC: Rouyn, Swastika, Val D'Or and Vancouver. 
The sampling procedures included the systematic inclusion of standards and property specific blank 
samples. The drillhole core samples were split in half with a rock saw. One half was sent for assaying 
while the second half was retained as a witness sample for future geological reference or for re-assaying 
should it be deemed necessary. Sampling was conducted not only on core with visible evidence of 
mineralization such as: veins, stringers, and alteration zones, but also on barren looking core to preserve 
the sampling continuity between mineralized zones and to test for broad zones of lower grade material. 

The core sampling protocol used by the previous consultants is presumed as follows: 

• The core is logged by geologist. 
• For mineralized intervals of NQ sized core, the drill core samples have a minimum sample length 

of 30 cm and a maximum length of 1.5 m.  
• Photos of the main mineralized intersections are taken using a digital camera. 
• Core is split in half with a rock saw by GBB technicians at the project site. 
• Half core samples are retained for future references and are returned to the core box along with 

their respective serialized assay tag. 
• Samples are bagged at the project site and delivered by commercial courier to the lab facilities. 
• The sampling procedure includes the insertion of commercially prepared standards and property 

specific blanks collected from similar geological units, at regular intervals. 
• (Key information table to retrieve this information was not found).  

The information recorded in the drill log by the project geologist describing the core normally includes: the 
from-to, depth, core length, true width, as well as observations concerning rock type, deformation, 
alteration, fault zones and nature of mineralization , the name of the vein if possible, and core angles. All 
observations are normally entered into drillhole database management software. 

All core boxes are stored outside on site. Each individual core box is identified with aluminum tags labelled 
by a Dymo® label writer including the drillhole number. The boxes are stored on core racks. The site has 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 91
 

constant security surveillance. Due to the large number of relevant samples included in the resource 
estimate the remaining core intersections and composites have not been tabulated in this section or in this 
report. 

 
Figure 11-1: Permanent core racks and mobile core racks 

From the picture in Figure 11-1 it can be seen that core has not been cut and the entire core is in the 
mobile racks. 

11.3 CHANNEL SAMPLING PROTOCOL 

During the 2013 channel sampling campaign, core samples were systematically assayed for gold with 
multi-element package by Accurassay laboratory in Rouyn Noranda. The sampling procedure included 
insertion of standards and blanks. The channel samples were made with a mechanical saw and sectioned 
in 1 metre long samples. Samples were identified, packaged and sent to Accurassay lab. Each sample 
was surveyed by a surveyor (location of "from" and "to"). 

• The trench locations were identified by the geologist. 
• The trenches were dug by a shovel operator. 
• The bedrock was cleaned using water hoses.  
• The channels were set by technician and sectioned into metres. 
• Photos of the channel were taken using a digital camera. 
• Rock samples were cut using a rock saw. 
• Samples were bagged at the project site and delivered directly to the lab facilities by the 

technician. 
• The sampling procedure included the insertion of commercially prepared standards and property 

specific blanks collected from similar geological units, at regular intervals. 

 

11.4 ANALYSES 

Sample preparation and assaying procedures for 2009 through 2011 have changed.  

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 92
 

As we understand there was one standard procedure for regular samples however when visible gold was 
observed in core a secondary procedure was adopted which include a complete pulp metallic (screen 
metallic) assay on the whole sample. 

Sample preparation includes the following procedures and operations; however they may not have been 
performed on all samples but for the majority of them: 

• Log sample into the tracking system. 
• Record the weight of material received from the client. 
• Crush drill core samples to finer than 70% passing 2 mm. 
• Split sample using a riffle splitter. 
• Pulverize the split (up to 250 g) to a particle size finer than 85% passing 75 μm. 

Once the sample is pulverized the following assay methods are then applied to the sample: 

• Gold assays are routinely performed using fire assay (FA) with atomic absorption (AA) finish. High 
gold assays are automatically re-assayed using a FA with gravimetric finish. 

• A multi-element geochemical package was used to determine As, Ag and others elemental 
concentrations. 

In the context the author and team have focused all its work on retrieving the gold data. 

11.5 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC) PROGRAM 

The previous consultant for GBB had implemented a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program 
for the Granada project at the beginning of the 2009 to 2011 drill program. 

It was found that it was consisting of the insertion of commercially prepared reference material. 

The exact structure (list-computerized table) for the insertion of standards and blanks into the sampling 
sequence is not available. Regardless, the physical sample tags with: drillhole numbers, from-to depths, 
and unique sample number referring to the from-to depths that were used to rebuild the database 
independently of the QA/QC assay, they were put aside. 

This being said it was possible to build a table to check QA/QC from the ALS–Chemex laboratory's 
internal blanks and standards data. The following table confirms there was apparently no failure in terms 
of contamination at the ALS laboratory. 

Not having the target value it is difficult to judge, however we can observe that the SF 30 was likely two 
different reference materials and that OXL 78 standard had one failure. The source samples and the 
follow-up actions are unknown regarding this batch.

drilling program. 

11.6 SECURITY 

If we put aside that there has been a security failure at site when the previous consultant took off site 
critical project data during a weekend in autumn 2011. The author is of opinion that a chain of custody was 
probably in place prior to occurrence of problems between the service provider and the company. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 94
 

In the author's opinion the sample preparation was adequate as far as we have been able to verify with 
the laboratories, however it appears to have changed over time to accommodate bigger amount of rock 
crushed and pulverized prior to splitting, which is good. As for security there is no reason to believe that 
tampering has occurred as per arguments of the next section and the physical observation of gold in core 
at the site. The gold fire assay and screen metallic are industry standard for analysis of gold and are 
acceptable. 

The reader should keep in mind that this property is not a green field and mining activities have taken 
place and previous owners had demonstrated the presence of gold in the ground. 

An extensive independent sampling program has been put in place right at the beginning of the mandate 
in order to compensate the lack of follow-up on previous QA/QC, which also built confidence on the data 
for preparation of the resource estimate in the context of a nuggety gold project. 

11.7 QAQC PROGRAM 2012 

Gold Bullion Development Corp adhered to a quality control procedure, including inserting standards, 
blanks and duplicate samples. This section represents a comment of the QAQC data available to the 
author at the moment of the update resource estimation. 

11.7.1 ANALYTICAL STANDARDS 
One (1) sample out of every 26 is an established standard purchased from either Ore Research, 
Exploration or from Accurassay and inserted by SGS Geostat. The inserted standard is one of the 
standards listed in the following table. The standards were inserted in a predefined sequence, as standard 
15d and 2Pd were exhausted they were replaced by HGS1 and HGS3 respectively in the quality control 
sequence.

Each of the seven standards were sorted by hole number, and plotted on graphs (Figure 11-3, Figure 
11-4, Figure 11-5, Figure 11-6, Figure 11-7, Figure 11-8, Figure 11-9) with their performance gates (and 
measured and expected mean values).  A sign test was conducted for each standard to measure if there 
was bias; a summary of the sign test is in (Table 10-4). None of the standards indicated serious bias 
based on the results of the sign test, the only standard to fail the sign test was the OREAS 15f standard 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 95
 

which was slightly biased high. This bias can in part be explained by 2 anonymously high values and 
another high value that appears to be a mislabelled standard. Even though there is a slight bias high, 
OREAS 15f has the lowest absolute and relative amount of QC failures and almost all the data falls 
between the mean and 2nd standard deviation. The results of the data for the standards indicate that 
control has been established and there is no significant bias.

Three (3) standards (samples 1332010, 1292428, and 1373653) were removed from the population due to 
sequence errors in the laboratory, this was determined when they all came back low, and upon review of 
the results it was determined that there was a sequence error at the laboratory. These samples were 
removed from the statistical population; however the results were not removed from the block model. 
These three (3) errors will not have significant effect on the block model; through inspection of the results 
in the sample batches these errors have no effect on mineralized intervals.  

Samples 1345376, 1293029, 1373310, 1132923 were removed from the statistics population because 
there was insufficient material for assay.  

Samples 1333037, 1293057, 1294437, 1295253, 1295513, 1295985, 1301012, 1301409, 1301528 have 
been identified as mislabels and with supporting evidence have been changed before final QAQC 
analysis. Other samples that are suspected to be mislabels have been left in the population due to a lack 
of proof to relabel the samples.  

Standards that had very high percent difference from the mean value were investigated on an individual 
basis. The results of this investigation are summarized; 

From work order 1155-201250303, sample 1294929 identified as a STD 15h had a Au value failure, 
however the geochemical signature matched other 15h standards for non gold responses. Based on the 
other results of the work order, the failure should not affect the block-model and control is re-established 
by surrounding control sample. 

From work order 1155-201250388, sample 1295961 identified as a STD 15h had a Au value failure, the 
subsequent sample had a Au value of 7.314 g/t. The following sample is not likely a mislabel, there is the 
possibility of having a bias low and effect could be underestimating the gold value.  

From work order 1155-201250402, sample 1332010 identified as a STD 15h had a Au value failure. It 
appears there is a sequence error at the laboratory and that sample 1332009 is indeed the standard, the 
sequence error is contained within the previous and next control samples, the possible effect upgrading 
the deposit but not significantly. 

From work order 1155-201250249, sample 1292428 identified as a STD 15h had a Au value failure. After 
investigating it appears to be a sequence error at the laboratory, the error is contained within the last and 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 100
 

next control samples, and it is likely sample 1292429 should be the STD15h through matching the 
geochemical signature, and the sample 1292428 more closely matches the signature of the deposit. The 
effect is a possible upgrading of the deposit, though the error has been realized the model has not been 
changed since the resulting effect is close to negligible. 

From work order 1155-201250408, sample 1300356 identified as a STD 2Pd had a Au value failure. It 
appears to be an unknown failure; no other irregularities appear in the sample sequence, geochemical 
values for all other reported elements appear normal. Although there is potential to cause a bias low in 
gold results, the range of there error is unlikely to affect the overall database.  

From work order 1155-201250414, sample 1300536 identified as a STD 2Pd had a Au value failure. There 
are no apparent discrepancies, and geochemistry matches standard for all other recorded elements. Due 
to the range of control loss, this should have insignificant contribution to the model. 

From work order 1155-201250384, sample 1378309 identified as a STD HGS1 had a Au Value failure. No 
other apparent errors in surrounding analytical sequence. There is potential to cause a bias low in gold 
results, however no potential to produce significant bias in the block model. 

From work order 1155-201250248, sample 1293453 identified as a STD HGS1 had a Au Value spike. The 
result has potential to cause a bias high in the database, however no samples of significance are affected 
in the surrounding sequence, there is insignificant impact on database before control is re-established. 

From work order 1155-201250377, sample 1332957 identified as a STD HGS3 had a Au value failure. 
There is potential to cause a bias low for gold result, however there are no values of significance in the 
sequence before control is re-established. 

From work order 1155-201250342, sample 1261352 identified as a STD 15d had a Au value failure. There 
is potential to cause a bias low for gold result, however there are no values of significance in the sequence 
before control is re-established. 

From work order 1155-201250123, sample 1373653 identified as a STD 15d had a Au value failure. 
Through investigation it is determined the most likely a sequence error occurred in the lab, and the 
probable value for STD15d is sample 1343652. Control is re-established by the previous and next control 
samples, this should not create major bias in data. Even though we are aware of a potential sequence 
error, the model has not been recalculated and the bias will not be of significance. 

From work order 1155-201250290, sample 1333133 identified as a STD 15d had an Au value spike. The 
geochemical signature is consistent with other STD 15d's for elements other than gold. This result could 
indicate that there is a bias high in the batch sequence results, however no samples of interest are 
present in the following sequence and effect on the database is minimal. 

It is a possibility that unknown spikes and failures of gold values in standards could be caused by 
unintentional shaking of standards and creating a nugget effect through gravity separation. 

11.7.2 ANALYTICAL BLANKS 
Six (6) of every 200 samples were sent to the laboratory as blank material. The material is a marble 
purchased from the local hardware store and inserted by SGS Geostat. A total of 340 blanks are in the 
assay database.

Figure 11-10: Blanks Analytical Results for Au 

Of the 340 blanks only one blank analyzed produced a result over 5x the detection limit and was not an 
appreciable gold response. The blanks consistently provided control as a blank material. There was no 
mislabels or sequence errors for blank material. 

11.7.3 CORE DUPLICATES 
Gold Bullion implemented a double duplicate method for core duplicates. A total of 350 assays were 
compared with 1400 duplicate assays.  

11.7.3.1 The Double Duplicate Method 

A quarter core split is taken and sent to the laboratory blind as the original for duplicate comparison. An 
additional half core is sampled and sent to the laboratory with the title "DDUP", and a quarter core remains 
as a witness sample. The DDUP samples have special laboratory instructions: 

• Each sample bag will contain 4 tickets and their corresponding ticket numbers are written on the 
bag. The tickets will be in pairs, stapled together; the first pair will be labelled 1A and 1B 
respectively, and the second pair will be labelled 2A and 2B respectively. These pairing ensure 
that each pair belongs to a single pulp. 

• The contents of one sample bag will be crushed in entirety.  
• Instead of one split, two splits will be created both of 250g, if the case where there is less than 

500g of crush the split will be two equal portions. From this point, one pair of tickets will 
accompany first split, and the other pair will accompany the second split. 

• Each of the splits will be then pulverized. 
• From each pulverized split there will be two assays, 1 assay for each ticket. The assays will all be 

done by the same method.  
• They will be reported by the ticket number. 

See Figure 11-11 for a simplified flowsheet of the process.

11.7.3.2 The Double Duplicate Results 

Scatter plots of the ¼ core split gold values versus each of the duplicated values (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B) (Figure 
11-12) were created to check if there is the expected linear relationship. Most of the values did not match 
on a 1:1 line or within the 20% variance, displaying that there appears to be a nugget effect within the 
deposit. However by comparing the results on a line chart there is a definite relationship with the duplicate 
results.  The nugget effect hypothesis is further solidified by comparing the duplicates that came from the 
same pulp, the 1A and 1B results (Figure 11-13) and also the 2A and 2B results. When comparing 
samples produced from the same pulp, the results plot closer to a 1:1 relationship. This indicates there is 
much less variation within the individual pulps as compared to the entire sample.

11.8 SECURITY 

There was a security failure in autumn of 2011 when the previous consultant removed critical project data 
during a weekend autumn 2011. The author is of the opinion that a chain of custody was probably in place 
prior to the occurrence of problems between the service provider and the company.  

In the author's opinion the sample preparation was adequate as far as we have been able to verify with 
the laboratories, it was apparently changed over time to have larger amount of rock crushed and 
pulverized prior to split which is good. As for security there is no reason to believe tampering has occurred 
as per arguments of the next section and the physical observation of gold in core at the site. The gold fire 
assay and screen metallic are industry standard for analysis of gold and are acceptable. 

The reader should keep in mind that this property is not a green field, mining activities have taken place 
and previous owners have demonstrated the presence of gold in the ground. 

An extensive independent sampling program has been put in place right at the beginning of the mandate 
in order to compensate the lack of follow-up on previous QA/QC, and also built confidence on the data for 
preparation of the resource estimate in the context of a nuggetty gold project.

12 Data Verification 

12.1 THE INDEPENDENT ANALYTICAL PROGRAM 

Since it was not possible to have access to all data up to date, an extreme independent sampling program 
was set-up.  A selection of holes and intersections throughout the deposit was done; a quick log of the cut 
witness core with checking of the assay tags took place. Afterward the half core samples were bag sealed 
and sent to SGS laboratory in Toronto. Both 50 gram gold fire assays followed by a screen metallic on 
500g to 1 kg sample were requested for each individual sample. Photographs of the core were taken prior 
to sampling.  In addition to this program, sample pulps from the four (4) laboratories were selected for 
reanalysis. It is important to mention that sample selection was done prior to the final preparation of the 
database. This has led to the discard of control data could not be matched at the moment of writing the 
report. 

12.1.1 THE DATABASE 
The following details the required steps to produce a usable geological database from the received 
information sets. 

After receiving basic information, a field inspection took place to verify the location of drillhole collars in the 
field. There were two collar information files from the independent surveyor Mazac Geoservices. One was 
from August 2011 and the second from October 2011. These files have been used as the base for the 
creation of the new drillhole database. The Geotic file received from Gold Bullion dated September 2011 
was incomplete and errors between the drillhole names were observed, in particular between the field 
survey files and the Geotic log. Moreover, coordinates for some holes in the Geotic file had discrepancies 
over 1000 m in position while several were in the 5 to 10 meters range. The errors may have occurred by 
using a combination of the planned collar positions and final surveyed positions from Mazac, particularly in 
the case when inclinations (dips) were not surveyed and the FlexIT data was not available. Validation of 
the deviation data along the hole in the Geotic database could not be completed due to the absence of 
magnetic field measurements. 

It was also observed in the assays of Geotic that gold (Au) and beryllium (Be) columns were interchanged. 
Ian Lafrance from SGS Geostat initiated the tedious quest of rebuilding the database from assay 
certificates and a partial list in a key Excel file of from-to values, to accurately match the proper gold 
values to depth. 

The blanks and standards reference list were not available. In the file provided approximately 80% of 
from-to's was relocated and appropriate assay result from original assay certificate have been matched. 
However, approximately 18,000 m of assays results could still not be matched. The investigation work was 
performed between November 2011 and February 2012. In February 2012, the company received 
additional information in paper form of non-validated logs from the previous consultant. Some of this 
added information was used to extend the database. SGS geologists were sent to the site for quick 
logging and retrieval of from-to values for certain drillholes to complete the database for the first resource 
estimate. Even though geological logs were limited, combining the information from the paper logs 
supplied in February 2012, SGS could removing the incomplete and/or doubtful non validated holes 
bringing the count of usable holes from the 400's to the 300's. 

An additional difficulty arose in the preparation of the assay database: the same sample numbers were 
used for different holes with different from-to values and from different laboratories. The date of results 
from the laboratory and drillhole drilling timing was used to organize the data. Partial FlexIT data was 
provided in February 2012 which helped the validation of certain deviation surveys in some of the holes.

12.1.2 DATABASE VALIDATION 2014 
Between Jan 24 2014 and Feb 05 2014 Matthew Halliday GIT from SGS Geostat conducted further 
validation on the geological database. The database contained some overlapping assay data and as such 
informed decisions had to be made to better prepare and eliminate overlapping assays from entering 
block model. Twenty-three samples were identified as potential errors. Eleven samples appear to be 
simple transcription errors causing very small overlaps, after confirming with excel drillhole logs these 
values were corrected. Hole number GR-10-17 had multiple overlaps because there were duplicate 
assays from the analytical lab, the newest values were kept except for one value which came from a 
larger sample more representative sample. Samples numbered 30058-30061 were removed from GR-10-
17. Three more assays were deleted from three other holes for similar reasons. These changes are 
assumed to not cause any significant changes to the dataset in terms of grade. Addition overlap checks, 
collar depths were checked to verify no end of hole depths were smaller than the last assay. This 
validation was performed by incorporating techniques within the GeoBase Validation tool, Access, and 
Excel. 

Using the information from the current validation, minor changes were made to the deviations and 
lithology tables. For the deviations table, a review of possibly erroneous deviations was conducted and 
compared to nearby surveys, 80 particular deviations were selected. Of those 80 only a small fraction 
were selected to be "inactive". Similarly the modifications to the Lithology table were equally minor, most 
modifications were to change the geological level of lithologies to avoid any potential overlaps, and some 
faults were given a 1 cm dimensionality. Most of these errors were minor overlap issues, however 19 
errors were outside the drillhole limits, in such cases the drill logs were consulted and the appropriate 
changes made, typically this discrepancy type was within 3m or 1 drill run. 

At this time, only the changes to the assays table have been used in the 3d modelling environment, 
however the other corrections are available for future use. 

12.1.3 THE PULP 
A decision was made in 2011 to perform a random selection of the pulps stored at site from the four (4) 
different laboratories. Initially, 646 pulps were selected and taken for 50 gram gold fire assay and even 
pulp from screen metallic of Accurassay. The picture below (Figure 12-1) presents the storage of pulp 
crates in the containers, the wood crates were brought inside the logging facility where pulps were sorted, 
recorded in a computer and bagged for shipping to the SGS Laboratory in Toronto.

The following page presents comparison table from GBB originals versus SGS control. 

 
Figure 12-2: Screenshot of comparison pulps database  

In the process of trying to connect the pulp assay numbers with reliable data in the database, we ended 
up with only 588 pulps for comparison for which we could trace with confidence. 

The average gold grade of the pulps from the four (4) labs is 252 ppb where as SGS produced 266 ppb. 
The bias could not be demonstrated with the sign test on these pairs. 

12.1.4 THE CORE 
A decision was made in 2011 to select continuous samples representing zones instead of selecting 
individual random samples. Holes and depth intervals were selected from the Geotic based on coverage 
of the deposit independently of which lab made the analyses. A total of 1,393 assays including inserted 
blanks were sent to the SGS laboratory in Toronto for sample preparation followed by both a 50 g fire 
assay and a Screen metallic on 500 to 1kg depending on sample size.

Figure 12-3: Sample of the comparison database 

Removing the samples unmatched with originals or blanks, the initial 1,393 assays is reduced to 1,341 
usable assays for comparison. A total sample length of 1,598.31 meters was taken for independent 
sampling in this phase of the program. This represents nearly 4% of the drill core used in the resource 
estimate for that part only. If the pulp and the total gold tests core lengths are added to this, then over 5% 
of drill core in the resource estimate has been tested in the author's independent sampling program. If the 
previous consultant had completed their work in full, a significantly smaller amount of independent control 
samples would have been required.  

In comparing all the original assays with the controls, no bias has been detected with the Sign test.

Figure 12-4: Correlation between original sample and control sample half core 

The independent sampling of the witness core shows that the original data can be used to produce 
resource estimates. The author is aware of the variation from taking the second half of core and being in a 
context of gold with presence of coarse grains. 

The average gold grade of the independent sampling is higher than the average grade of the original data. 
So the existing database is more conservative than highly promotional and can now serve as a base for 
resource estimation.

A comparison between SGS fire assay and Screen metallic was also been done. 

When sorted on screen metallic (SM- Au Calc g/t) and using only results above zero, we get 1,196 screen 
metallic results received at the time of analysis (108 assay results were not included at time of analysis). 
The average grade for Original Gold Bullion is 0.42 g/t, SGS FA is 0.60 g/t and the screen metallic 
average grade is 0.56 g/t. 

The exercise of selecting only the comparison assay for SGS SM having a grade above zero in the 
metallic portion was also done. This gives us 478 samples to compare. The average grade for Original 
Gold Bullion data for these is 0.90 g/t, SGS FA is 1.40 g/t and the screen metallic average grade is 1.32 
g/t., the average grade of the metallic component for these is 7.64 g/t. 

Based on these comparisons it appears that actual GBB gold grades are underestimated and requires 
additional investigation.

Figure 12-5: Correlation between SGS FA and SGS SM 

During the investigation process a second Fire Assay was requested to SGS laboratory, where the first 
SGS Fire Assay results contained grades above 0, 1,235 assays were compared. In the second set of fire 
assays three (3) of the 1,235 samples came back below detection limit of 5 pbb; those values were 
replaced with 3 ppb. The average grades are: the original GBB assays is 410 ppb or 0.41 g/t, first SGS FA 
assay 621 ppb or 0.62 g/t and the second SGS FA  646 ppb or 0.65 g/t.  In addition to the 738 assays 
below detection limit of first SGS FA run, 3 came back with 12, 17 and 36 ppb which are not significant in 
author's opinion. 

12.1.5 TOTAL GOLD TEST 
In addition to pulp and core sampling, total gold tests on 29 composites were also conducted. The total 
gold test was carried out on a zone which was composited and the entire composite is processed to define 
the total amount of gold in the rock. The composite lengths are 8 to 14 meters of core and represent

The comparison of the average original Gold Bullion Fire Assay versus the SGS Lakefield total gold test 
show the FA are higher than the average total gold. This justifies the application of capping on individual 
fire assay even if individual assay shows average lower grade than control SGS individual assays bring 
confidence to the Gold Bullion exploration data.  

With the observations and conclusions from the exhaustive independent sampling program, the newly 
validated Gold Bullion database can be used for resource estimation (RE) with confidence. The deep 
holes of Phase 1 to 3 without reliable surveys (not used in the current RE) will have to be resurveyed 
along the hole or discarded, unless original Reflex measurements with magnetic field readings are found. 
The 2012 deep holes are reliable for resource estimation.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

13.1 SGS LAKEFIELD TESTWORK- PROJECT 13526-001 (DECEMBER 2011 – 
JANUARY 2012) 

A series of metallurgical tests were carried out at SGS Lakefield on 29 composite samples from the 
Granada deposit in order to determine the most probable head grade of the mineralization. The samples 
in their entirety were processed through gravity separation followed by cyanide leaching of the gravity 
tailings. An overall gravity separation plus cyanidation metallurgical balance was applied to calculate the 
head grade of each composite sample. The results are shown in Table 13-1 below.

Because of a possible misinterpretation of the block model by a former company, it was discovered 
afterward that some of the composite samples came from drillholes that were outside the known boundary 
of the deposit. In order to correct the situation and to come up with a more exact deposit head grade, 
composite samples 3, 5, 7, 17, and 21 were discarded from the SGS Lakefield met tests.

13.1.1 METALLURGICAL TESTING 
The prime objective of the metallurgical testwork was to determine the head grade of each composite by 
subjecting the entire sample to gravity concentration of the coarse gold followed by cyanide leaching of 
the gravity tailings. An overall (gravity plus cyanidation) gold metallurgical balance was applied to 
calculate the head grade of each sample and the total gold recovery. 

13.1.1.1 Gravity Separation  

For the gravity testwork, each composite sample was ground in a laboratory rod mill to a target of P80 
particle size of 75 µm. The mill product was passed through a 3-inch Knelson concentrator. The Knelson 
concentrate was cleaned on a Mozley table. Both the Mozley and Knelson tailings were combined and 
submitted to cyanide leaching. 

The gold recovery to the gravity concentrates ranged from 29.6% to 78% with an average of 54.0%. 

13.1.1.2 Cyanidation 

The combined Knelson and Mozley table tailings were subjected to cyanide leaching under the following 
conditions: 

 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 126
 

Pulp density 40% solid 
Particles size P80 75 µm 
pH 10.5 to 11.0 maintained with hydrated lime 
Cyanide concentration 0.5 g/L NaCN 
Cyanidation time 48 hours 
Air addition ≈2 L/min 
Test mode Reactor vessel with mechanical agitator 

The extraction of gold by cyanidation ranged from 83.5% to 94% with an average of 89.3%. The NaCN 
and lime consumptions ranged from 0.03 to 1.40 kg/t and 0.21 to 0.70 kg/t respectively. The overall 
extraction, gravity plus cyanidation ranged from 90.0 to 98.5% with an average of 94.9%. 

13.1.2 SGS LAKEFIELD TESTWORK - PROJECT 14041-001 (MARCH – APRIL 2013) 
The purpose of this second test program was to determine the amenability of the sample to coarse gravity 
separation and flotation. The original test program included dense media separation, flash flotation and 
cyanidation testwork. The sections below present and summarize the results of testwork that was 
completed on these new Granada samples. 

13.1.2.1 Specific Gravity 

Seventeen (17) of the individual core samples which were used for the Master Composite were submitted 
for density measurements. The initial rock weight, weight in water and water displacement was recorded. 
The weights were then used to calculate the specific gravity of the ore which was found to be 2.78. 

13.1.2.2 Head Analysis 

Four (4) gold size fraction analyses were completed on the Master Composite sample. The gold head 
grade for the -¼" Master Composite sample was 1.39 g/t. The gold head grade for the three size fractions 
which were created by screening at 4 mm and 1.18 mm ranged from 0.43 g/t to 1.35 g/t. 

13.1.2.3 Comminution 

The Master Composite sample was submitted for a standard Bond abrasion test. The results of this test 
can be used to determine steel media and liner wear in crushers, rod mills and ball mills. The Abrasion 
Index (AI) was 0.247 g and the sample was classified as medium abrasive. 

A Bond low-energy impact test was performed on twenty rock samples from the Granada site. Twenty 
rocks in the range of 2" to 3" were selected and shipped to Phillips Enterprises LLC for the completion of a 
Bond low-energy impact test. The CWI average was 19.2 kWh/t and fell in the very hard hardness-range. 

13.1.2.4 Heavy Liquid Separation 

Two samples (-¼" +4 mm and -4 mm +1.18mm) were submitted for heavy liquid separation (HLS) testing. 
The samples were placed in separatory funnels containing heavy liquid (methylene iodide) at six specific 
gravities, 3.1, 3.0, 2.9, 2.8, 2.75 and 2.7. The test was carried out sequentially starting with the sample run 
of highest SG (3.1), creating a float and sink fraction. The float fraction was cleaned, dried, weighed and 
then run at the next lowest SG. The minerals lighter than the heavy liquid specific gravity floated and those 
denser sank. The sink fraction and final float (2.7 SG) from each test were submitted for gold analysis. 

The results indicated that 69.2% of the gold was recovered at a mass recovery of 30.6%. In order to get a 
higher gold recovery a larger mass recovery is required. 

The results for the -4 mm +1.18 mm Master Composite test indicated that there was improved separation 
at a finer fraction compared to the coarser fraction (-¼" + 4 mm). A mass recovery of 30.5% yielded a gold 
recovery of 79.3%, approximately 10% higher than the coarser fraction results. It should also be noted that 
the 2.70 float was very low grade, 0.05 g/t Au. Additional testwork at a finer crush size (6 mesh) was 
recommended by SGS.

13.1.2.5 Metallurgical Testing 

The original testwork program included dense media separation (DMS) testwork on the -¼" +4 mm and -
4 mm +1.18 mm samples. Dense media separation was going to be used to preconcentrate the minerals 
and reject gangue materials prior to flotation testwork (float fraction) and cyanidation testwork (sink 
fraction). Based on the HLS test results Gold Bullion decided not to engage in the DMS testwork. 

A Wilfley shaking table was used to complete one single pass Wilfley test on the -1.18 mm Master 
Composite sample. The target concentrate weights were 1%, 2%, 5%, 10% and 15% of the feed weight. 
The concentrates from the test were going to be used for cyanidation testwork and the Wilfley tailings 
were going to be used for flotation and cyanidation testwork. The Wilfley table products were dried, 
weighed and assayed for gold. 

Eight (8) concentrate samples were collected during the Wilfley test and combined to create weight 
fractions close to the target values. These concentrates were dried, weighed and assayed for gold. The 
calculated gold head grade for the -1.18 mm Master Composite sample was 1.31 g/t which compared well 
to the gold size fraction analysis value, 1.35 g/t Au.

testwork. 

13.1.3 GEKKO SYSTEMS PTY. LIMITED TESTWORK – REPORT T1037 (APRIL – JULY 2013) 
The purpose of Gekko's testwork was to build upon the previous scoping program, which found that the 
Gold Bullion Granada ore was amenable to coarse gravity recovery and fine flotation. Additional tests 
such as gravity (Falcon), coarse flotation and leaching were added to the original scope of the testwork. 

13.1.3.1 Head Grade Analysis 

The head grade analysis of the dense media separation feed at a crushed size range of -4 mm to +1.18 
mm showed a head assay of 1.23 g/t whilst the calculated grade was 0.47 g/t Au. In one of the four (4) 
repeat fire assays, a reading of 3.75 g/t Au was evident, which indicates a presence of coarse or 'spotty' 
gold in the dense media separation feed sample. 

The table feed crushed to 100% passing 1.18 mm, also indicated the presence of spotty or coarse gold. 
The average head assay was 1.03 g/t and a calculated grade obtained by the feed sizing was 0.97 g/t Au. 
This is supported by the higher LeachWell grade (2.06 g/t) than the fire assay grade of the single pass 
table feed sizing; this can be caused by 'spotty' gold that is captured by the LeachWell test but may be 
exacerbated in a 50 g fire assay. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 128
 

13.1.3.2 Comminution 

The sample had an impact crushing work index of 19.3 kWh/tonne with a range from of 6.1 to 33 
kWh/tonne. The abrasion index of the sample was 0.287. 

Vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushing (Barmac) produced high circulating loads that indicated low 
amenability to this comminution technique. 

13.1.3.3 Dense Media Separation 

Dense media separation tests indicated gold recovery to be at 70% in a mass yield of 4.3% of the feed at 
a cumulative grade of 19.4 g/t. Approximately 70% of the feed material resided in the -4 mm to +1.18 mm 
size fraction for DMS cyclone test. The total calculated grade (tail grade) of sinks (SG of 2.9) to floats (SG 
of 2.7) was 0.35 g/t Au. A tail grade of 0.35g/t was attributed to the residual material from the dense media 
separation test. This represented approximately 96% of the test mass. 

13.1.3.4 Gravity Recovery 

The optimum single pass table gold recovery for the sample at 100% passing 1.18 mm was 56.2% into 
15% of the feed mass at a grade of 4.2 g/t Au. The table tails grade was 0.58 g/t, therefore gravity 
recovery methods were employed in order to minimize the loss of gold to tails. 

A Falcon batch centrifugal concentration was used on the gravity tails and selected gravity concentrates 3, 
4 and 5, to increase the recovery of gold into a smaller mass. The Falcon was able to recover 22.1% of 
the gold into 0.5% of the feed mass at a grade of 30.8 g/t Au. While the concentration of the ore via Falcon 
is considered low on its own, its contribution to overall gold recovery via gravity is significant. 

13.1.3.5 Flotation 

Coarse flotation completed on the Falcon tails at P100 = 600 μm recovered 51.1% of the gold into 7.8% of 
the feed mass for a grade of 2.49 g/t Au. Whilst flotation completed on the Falcon tails that was ground to 
P100 = 125 μm recovered 57.1% of the gold into 11.8% of the feed mass achieved a grade of 2.27 g/t Au. 
The tails grade for both the coarse and fine flotation tails were consistent with one another, at 0.20 g/t Au 
and 0.23 g/t Au respectively. 

13.1.3.6 Cyanidation 

Intensive cyanidation tests were carried out on the combined gravity and flotation tests to determine leach 
amenability. 

13.1.3.7 Total Gold Recovery (Table, Falcon, Flotation, Cyanidation) 

The recovery of gold for combined table, Falcon and coarse flotation concentrate was 82.7% at a grade of 
8.20 g/t into 10.5% of the feed mass whilst the overall gold recovery of combined table, Falcon and fine 
flotation concentrates of 82.6%, at a grade of 6.45 g/t into 14.4% of the feed mass. 

Combined gravity, Falcon and fine flotation concentrate (LGOLD 02) displayed higher recoveries. Over 24 
hours gold leach recovery for LGOLD 01 was 74.2% and over the same time period, gold leach recovery 
for LGOLD 02 was 90%.

13.1.4.10 Gravity-cyanidation duplicata 

Out of the 23.5 kg of sample received by the URSTM, some 19.4 kg was used for the above tests thus 
leaving approximately 6.1 kg untouched. Because of the problem of conciliating the ore geological and 
mining grades to the tests head grades, probably due to a bad nugget effect, the URSTM was asked to do 
another gravity-cyanidation test employing the rest of the sample. 

Same protocol as the one used at Article 13.4.5 above was employed. Results are summarized in the 
following table:

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 

The mineral resource estimates are derived from a computerized resource block model. The construction 
of that model starts with drillhole data, which serves as the basis for the definition of 3D mineralized 
envelopes in which resources are limited to the material inside those envelopes. The next step is the 
selection of drillhole data within the mineralized envelopes in the form of fixed length composites and then 
the interpolation of the grade of blocks on a regular grid and filling the mineralized envelopes from the 
grade of the composites in the same envelopes. All the interpolated blocks between the 
overburden/bedrock contact and the pit bottom surface make the in-pit mineral resource (see Reserves 
section, no dilution or mining loss shown in this section). 

It was not possible to model the historical mined out area. Historical drillhole data was integrated but not 
used for the resource estimates. The limited historical production has to be removed from the resource 
statement. 

A resource model for the Rolling Start Project and a resource model for mining underground are 
presented in the following section. 

14.1 RESOURCE MODEL FOR THE ROLLING START PROJECT 

14.1.1 DRILLHOLE AND SAMPLE DATA 
Data used in the 2013 resource estimate was taken from a previous SGS assignment in which data was 
provided by Gold Bullion Development Corporation and validated by SGS employees. Four hundred and 
twenty-four (424) drillholes totaling 88,580 m of drill core and 62,387 analyses were exported from 
GoldBullion_DB_January15_2013.accdb for use in the resource estimation. The drillhole database 
includes date from 2009 to 2012; historical drillhole data was not used in the modeling or resource 
estimation with the exception of 1 hole from 1990 and 6 holes from 1994. These holes were included as 
drilling in the far north and west is sparse. The collar locations were confirmed, paper log copies exist on 
site, and resources around the historic holes are inferred only. Drillholes used in the estimation are 
presented in Figure 14-1 and all drillholes in the database (including historical holes) are presented in 
Figure 14-2 and Figure 14-3. Drillhole deviation data was recorded using various instruments totaling 
6,787 measurements. Mineralized intervals generated by SGS were used to create envelopes respecting 
a horizontal mining width of 7-10 m. Envelopes were designed to contour mineralized structures therefore 
waste material was included. The 3D modeling and resource estimation were completed using Genesis, 
software designed and owned by SGS.  

14.1.1.1 Topography 

The topography at the time of this resource estimation had been surveyed using Lidar. The majority of 
drillhole collars were resurveyed using a DGPS system with centimetre accuracy and are considered to 
be reliable. Overburden lithologic units within the drillhole logs were used to generate a surface from 
which the resource block model was limited. Underground drifts and shafts in 3D were provided by 
Richard Laprairie in a DXF file format.  

14.1.1.2 Density  

Historical densities used by Metchem Pellemon range from 2.91 to 3.1 g/m3. Independent density 
measurements taken by SGS range from 2.68 to 2.9 g/m3 with a mean of 2.8 g/m3. Additional 
measurements taken in 2012 have lowered the average to 2.7 g/m3. It is thought that the density is 
related to rock type and alteration. The Author recommends additional SG measurements on the various 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 134
 

sectors to examine if variable density should be used. A density of 2.7 g/m3 was used based on historical 
measurements used by Metchem Pellemon and additional measurements taken by SGS in 2012.

14.1.2 GEOLOGICAL AND BLOCK MODELING 
14.1.2.1 Overview 

This resource estimate presents an alternative to the estimate of February 2013. High-grade structures 
were modelled individually as opposed to the previous bulk mineralization resource. No new drillhole or 
analytical data was added to generate this selective mining scenario.   

The mineral resource was estimated by Claude Duplessis, Eng., consulting Geological Engineer for SGS 
Canada Inc., with the assistance of Amanda Landriault, Geologist of SGS Canada Inc. Mr. Duplessis is an 
independent qualified person (QP) as per section 1.4 of the NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 
Projects. 

14.1.2.2 Modelling 

Cross sectional views oriented NNE looking WNW and 25 m apart were used to study mineralization 
patterns and group assays into mineralized intervals. Prisms were created by snapping to the mineralized 
intervals, which were diluted to respect a minimum mining width of 7 to 10 m. A cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t 
was considered while modeling however, waste was included for structure continuity. Mineralized solids 
were generated based on the linked prisms and faults were designed based on historical records of fault 
intersections in underground workings and historic geologic plan maps (Figure 14-4). The faults are 
discussed in further detail in section 7 – Geological Setting. A Boolean solid consisting of all the 
mineralized solids was generated. Equal-length composites of 1 m were produced from the mineralized 
intervals and were capped at 30 g/t. 

 
Figure 14-4: Plan view of the mineralized solids including NNE-trending, sub-vertical faults 

The material within the resource model is discretized with the blocks of 5m (E-W) by 2.5m (N-S) by 5m 
(Vert.). The 5m vertical side corresponds to the bench height of the future open-pit operation. The 5m E-W 
dimension corresponds to about quarter the minimum spacing between GBB surface holes. The 2.5m N-S 
dimension accounts for the perceived greater grade variability along that direction. With fixed density of 
2.7 t/m3, each full block (5mx2.5mx5m) represents about 168.75 tonnes and it is assumed reasonable for 
the selective mining unit (SMU) or minimum size block which can be selectively extracted as ore or waste 
in a future potential open-pit operation. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 137
 

The block model grid extends from UTM 646,000E to 647,800E and 5,337,600N to 5,339,100N from 325 
m to -800 m above sea level, where site surface elevation is approximately 320m.  

14.1.2.3 Compositing, statistical analysis and capping 

Since original assay intervals did not have the same lengths, composites were created to standardize that 
length. The grades of these fixed length intervals were used in the interpolation of the average grade of 
nearby 5×2.5×5 m blocks. This exercise was done with 1 m down-hole composites. This composite size 
was selected as the uniform length which best matched most of the original samples and the 5 m N-S 
thickness of the 5×2.5×5 m resource blocks to be interpolated. By selecting a composite with a smaller 
length to that of mineralized block intercepts, we have to increase the number of composites in the 
estimation to warrant that the grade dilution originating from the block size will be included in the grade of 
samples used to interpolate the grade of blocks.  

Most gold values in the drillhole assay intervals are low grade however there are a few individuals with 
extremely high values which require capping before those gold values are used in block grade 
interpolation. A standard approach to high grade capping consists of examining the high end of gold 
distributions in search for any natural gap in those distributions. 

14.1.2.3.1 Capping 

A capping study was performed on the composite data. A discontinuity is apparent in Figure 14-5 at high 
grade values of 30 g/t, as well as 40 g/t. The values were capped at 30 g/t to be conservative but 40 g/t 
could be considered in future after further exploration.

14.1.3 BLOCK GRADE INTERPOLATION 
14.1.3.1 Variography 

Although the inverse distance squared method was used to estimate the block model, a variography study 
was performed to confirm respectable search ellipsoid parameters. Figure 14-6 displays the variography 
results on 1 m composites capped at 30 g/t. The results confirm the search ellipsoid parameters of the 
"Down Dip" oriented ellipse remain the strongest. The nugget effect and the range are approximately 28 % 
and 65 m respectively.

14.1.3.2 Estimation parameters 

The 1 m composites were restricted to the limits of the Boolean solid and a block model of 5 x 2.5 x 5 m 
was generated. The resource estimate was calculated using the inverse distance squared method and two 
passes of disc ellipses, oriented down-dip as supported by the variographic analysis. Figure 14-7 displays 
the block model generated. Table 14-1 outlines the estimation parameters.

Figure 14-8 and Figure 14-9 display the ellipsoid used for pass 2 in the block model estimation. The 
primary ellipsoid axis was oriented down dip and an attempt was made to align the secondary axis

of neighbouring mineralized solids.

14.1.4 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
In this study the block resources in any given block are classified in an automatic manner and are not 
adjusted manually.  

The Granada Gold deposit was classified using three passes of disc ellipsoids. The parameters are 
outlined in Table 14-2.

As usual, the automatic classification has its drawbacks but in general reflects the level of confidence 
even if we observe "Swiss cheese" or "spotted dog" patterns with patches of measured alternating with 
patches of indicated or inferred resource categories.

14.2 UNDERGROUND RESOURCE MODEL  

14.2.1 DRILLHOLE AND SAMPLE DATA 
Data used in the 2013 resource estimate was taken from a previous SGS assignment in which data was 
provided by Gold Bullion Development Corporation and validated by SGS employees.  

Between Jan 24 2014 and Feb 05 2014 Matthew Halliday GIT from SGS Geostat conducted further 
validation on the geological database. The database contained some overlapping assay data and as such 
informed decisions had to be made to better prepare and eliminate overlapping assays from entering 
block model. See section 12 – Data Verification for more details. 

Four hundred and twenty-four (424) drillholes totaling 88,577 m of drill core and 62,375 analyses were 
exported from GoldBullion_DB_Jan29_2014_MH_Fulledits.accdb for use in the resource estimation. 
The drillhole database includes date from 2009 to 2012; historical drillhole data was not used in the 
modeling or resource estimation with the exception of 1 hole from 1990 and 6 holes from 1994. These 
holes were included as drilling in the far north and west is sparse. The collar locations were confirmed, 
paper log copies exist on site, and resources around the historic holes are inferred only. Drillhole deviation 
data was recorded using various instruments totaling 6,777 measurements. 

Mineralized intervals generated by SGS were used to create envelopes respecting a horizontal mining 
width of 3-4 m. Envelopes were designed to contour mineralized structures therefore waste material was 
included. The 3D modeling and resource estimation were completed using Genesis, software designed 
and owned by SGS.  

14.2.1.1 Topography 

The topography at the time of this resource estimation had been surveyed using Lidar. The majority of 
drillhole collars were resurveyed using a DGPS system with centimetre accuracy and are considered to be 

237.5 m

reliable. Overburden lithologic units within the drillhole logs were used to generate a surface from which 
the resource block model was limited. Underground drifts and shafts in 3D were provided by Richard 
Laprairie in a DXF file format.  

14.2.1.2 Density  

Historical densities used by Metchem Pellemon range from 2.91 to 3.1 g/m3. Independent density 
measurements taken by SGS range from 2.68 to 2.9 g/m3 with a mean of 2.8 g/m3. Additional 
measurements taken in 2012 have lowered the average to 2.7 g/m3. It is thought that the density is related 
to rock type and alteration. The Author recommends additional SG measurements on the various sectors 
to examine if variable density should be used. A density of 2.7 g/m3 was used based on historical 
measurements used by Metchem Pellemon and additional measurements taken by SGS in 2012. 

14.2.2 GEOLOGICAL AND BLOCK MODELING 
14.2.2.1 Overview 

This resource estimate presents an alternative to the estimate of February 2013. Mineralized zones have 
been remodeled with 3 to 4 metres horizontal width below elevation of 237.5 m.  High-grade structures 
were modelled individually as opposed to the previous bulk mineralization resource. No new drillhole or 
analytical data was added to generate this selective mining scenario.   

The underground mineral resource was estimated by Claude Duplessis, Eng., consulting Geological 
Engineer for SGS Canada Inc., with the assistance of Lyne Maître, M. Sc. Env of SGS Canada Inc. Mr. 
Duplessis is an independent qualified person (QP) as per section 1.4 of the NI 43-101 Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects. 

14.2.2.2 Modelling 

Cross sectional views oriented NNE looking WNW and 25 m apart were used to study mineralization 
patterns and group assays into mineralized intervals. Prisms were created by snapping to the mineralized 
intervals, which were diluted to respect a minimum mining width of 3 to 4 m. A cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t was 
considered while modeling however, waste was included for structure continuity. Mineralized solids were 
generated based on the linked prisms and faults were designed based on historical records of fault 
intersections in underground workings and historic geologic plan maps (Figure 14-22). The faults are 
discussed in further detail in section 7 – Geological Setting. A Boolean solid consisting of all the 
mineralized solids was generated. Equal-length composites of 1 m were produced from the mineralized 
intervals and were capped at 30 g/t. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 148
 

 
Figure 14-22: Plan view of the mineralized solids including NNE-trending, sub-vertical faults 

The material within the resource model is discretized with the blocks of 2.5m (E-W) by 1.25m (N-S) by 
1.25m (Vert.). The 1.25m N-S dimension accounts for the perceived greater grade variability along that 
direction. With fixed density of 2.7 t/m3, each full block (2.5mx1.25mx1.25m) represents about 10.55 
tonnes and it is assumed reasonable for the selective mining unit (SMU) or minimum size block which can 
be selectively extracted as ore or waste in a future potential open-pit operation. 

The block model grid extends from UTM 646,000E to 647,800E and 5,337,600N to 5,339,100N from 325 
m to -800 m above sea level, where site surface elevation is approximately 320m.  

14.2.3 COMPOSITING, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND CAPPING 
Since original assay intervals did not have the same lengths, composites were created to standardize that 
length. The grades of these fixed length intervals were used in the interpolation of the average grade of 
nearby 2.5×1.25×1.25 m blocks. This exercise was done with 1 m down-hole composites. This composite 
size was selected as the uniform length which best matched most of the original samples and the 1.25 m 
N-S thickness of the 2.5×1.25×1.25 m resource blocks to be interpolated. By selecting a composite with a 
smaller length to that of mineralized block intercepts, we have to increase the number of composites in the 
estimation to warrant that the grade dilution originating from the block size will be included in the grade of 
samples used to interpolate the grade of blocks.  

Most gold values in the drillhole assay intervals are low grade however there are a few individuals with 
extremely high values which require capping before those gold values are used in block grade 
interpolation. A standard approach to high grade capping consists of examining the high end of gold 
distributions in search for any natural gap in those distributions. 

14.2.3.1 Capping 

A capping study was performed on the composite data. A discontinuity is apparent in Figure 14-23 at high 
grade values of 30 g/t. The values were capped at 30 g/t.

14.2.4 BLOCK GRADE INTERPOLATION 
14.2.4.1 Variography 

Although the inverse distance squared method was used to estimate the block model, a variography study 
was performed to confirm respectable search ellipsoid parameters. Figure 14-24 displays the variography 
results on 1 m composites capped at 30 g/t. The results confirm the search ellipsoid parameters of the 
"Down Dip" oriented ellipse remain the strongest. The nugget effect and the range are approximately 59 % 
and 90 m respectively.

14.2.4.2 Estimation parameters 

The 1 m composites were restricted to the limits of the Boolean solid and a block model of 2.5 x 1.25 x 
1.25 m was generated. The resource estimate was calculated using the inverse distance squared method 
and two passes of disc ellipses, oriented down-dip as supported by the variographic analysis. Figure 
14-25 displays the block model generated. Table 14-3 outlines the estimation parameters.

Figure 14-26 and Figure 14-27 display the ellipsoid used for pass 2 in the block model estimation. The 
primary ellipsoid axis was oriented down dip and an attempt was made to align the secondary axis 
(azimuth) along the strike of the mineralized solids to reduce the risk of populating blocks with composites 
of neighbouring mineralized solids.

14.2.5 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
In this study the block resources in any given block are classified in an automatic manner and are not 
adjusted manually.  

The Granada Gold deposit was classified using three passes of disc ellipsoids. The parameters are 
outlined in Table 14-4.

As usual, the automatic classification has its drawbacks but in general reflects the level of confidence 
even if we observe "Swiss cheese" or "spotted dog" patterns with patches of measured alternating with 
patches of indicated or inferred resource categories.

14.3 GLOBAL RESOURCES 

Estimated mineral resources of the Granada gold project are simply obtained by adding resources in 
blocks with an estimated grade above any given cut-off. Resource tonnage of a block is: 
5m×2.5m×5m×2.7t/m3 = 168.75t for a full block (100% below overburden/topo surface). 

In the context of re-engineering to increase robustness of the Granada project, Mineral resources have 
been remodeled with mineral zones having a minimum horizontal width of 7m down to elevation 237.5m. 
This resource model has been used for pit optimization and design for the "Rolling Start" project. This 
model starts from the surface and pit bottom to elevation 237.5 metres. 

A cut-off grade of 1.69 g/t was used in the resource estimation and composites were capped at 30 g/t. A 
density of 2.7 t/m3 was used in the calculation of tonnage. The outcome is displayed in Table 14-5.

In order to address mining underground, mineralized zones have been remodeled with 3 to 4 meters 
horizontal width below elevation 237.5 metres. Estimated underground mineral resources of the Granada 
gold project are simply obtained by adding resources in blocks with an estimated grade above any given 
cut-off. Resource tonnage of a block is: 2.5m×1.25m×1.25m×2.7t/m3 = 10.55t for a full block (100% below 
overburden/topo surface). 

A cut-off grade of 3 g/t was used in the resource estimation and composites were capped at 30 g/t. A 
density of 2.7 t/m3 was used in the calculation of tonnage. The outcome is displayed in Table 14-7. The 
outcome of the combined underground (resource beneath the pit to a maximum depth of 237.5 m, CoG of 
1.69 g/t, and resource beneath the depth of 237.5, CoG of 3 g/t) is displayed in Table 14-8. 

Highlights include a Measured and Indicated combined underground gold resource of 325,450 ounces of 
gold at an average grade of 5.10 g/t gold plus 25,700 ounces Inferred at a grade of 7.14 g/t gold. The 
combined underground measured resource is 107,600 ounces (763,500 tonnes grading 4.38 g/t), 
indicated resource is 217,600 ounces (1,221,000 tonnes grading 5.54 g/t), inferred resource is 25,700 
ounces gold (112,000 tonnes grading 7.14 g/t Au) using a cut-off grade of 0.40 g/t.

Note and considerations: rounded numbers. The historical production of 51,476 ounces (181,744 sT @ 
0.28 oz/sT) from 1930 to 1935 is included in the resource statement (cannot physically remove from 
measured, indicated or inferred) as the historical opening cannot be placed in 3D. Moreover, the historical 
mining apparently extents to the west where no mineral resources have been estimated due to 
impossibility to drill from old tailing surface. The author also wants to remind that grade estimations comes 
from Gold Bullion recent drilling, hence gold grades do not comes from historical data in the mined out 
sector. 

14.4 CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE ESTIMATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES 

In the context of re-engineering to increase robustness of the Granada project, Mineral resources have 
been remodeled with mineral zones having a minimum horizontal width of 7m down to elevation 237.5m. 
This resource model has been used for pit optimization and design for the "Rolling Start" project. This 
model starts from the surface and pit bottom to elevation 237.5 metres. Lower grade is now excluded from 
the mineral resource statement. No gold loss has occurred from the PEA resource model to the actual 
presentation. It is all a matter of the mineral cut-off grade used with the associated economic scenario. 

In order to address mining underground, mineralized zones have been remodeled with 3 to 4 meters 
horizontal width below elevation 237.5 metres. Highlights include a Measured and Indicated combined 
underground gold resource of 325,450 ounces of gold at an average grade of 5.10 g/t gold plus 25,700 
ounces Inferred at a grade of 7.14 g/t gold. The combined underground measured resource is 107,600 
ounces (763,500 tonnes grading 4.38 g/t), indicated resource is 217,600 ounces (1,221,000 tonnes 
grading 5.54 g/t), inferred resource is 25,700 ounces gold (112,000 tonnes grading 7.14 g/t Au) using a 
cut-off grade of 0.40 g/t.  

Previous small open pits have been taken into account and are starting surfaces of optimization. The 
historical production of 51,476 ounces (181,744 sT @ 0.28 oz/sT) from 1930 to 1935 is included in the 
resource statement and the author cannot physically remove it from the measured, indicated or inferred 
categories. As the historical opening cannot be placed in 3D. Moreover the historical mining apparently 
extent to the west where no mineral resources have been estimated due to impossibility to drill from old 
tailing surface. The author also wants to remind that grade estimations comes from Gold Bullion recent 
drilling, hence gold grades do not comes from historical data in the mined out sector. 

• Accuracy of the disclosure on what has been mined out underground. The amount of material 
mined out is limited, however it could be a bit more than disclosed but not to a huge extent since it 
would be reflected with a much larger tailing footprint. 

• Combination of additional factors which could materially affect the resources are:

o The presence of old orphan tailings 
o The presence of arsenic in the rock at Granada 

14.5 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE ESTIMATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES 

It is recommended to undertake negotiation and clean-up of the orphan tailings (dating from 1935) with the 
Ministry of Natural Resources Quebec in order to enable exploration drilling to the northwest of existing 
drilling to validate extension of the mineralized package at depth (old tailings location). It is also 
recommended to do additional drilling to improve resource estimates in the open pit area lateral extension. 
It is also recommended to complete the drilling to the west, to the north and to the east on a 40 to 50 m 
grid of surface holes drilling southward at 55 degrees dip. A few infill holes where gap exists and 3 cross-
sections of 3 holes on 100 m line to tests mineralization on the claims to the west. There are 3 target 
depths which merit additional drilling. One is near surface which we can define as 0-100, from 100 to 400 
meters and deeper which is 400 to 1000 meters vertical depth, The deep drilling of 2012, the DUP holes 
have confirmed extension of gold mineralisation at 1Km vertical depth showing the system is still open. 
The author also wants to mention that the property has not been explored extensively by diamond drilling 
and some budget should be put on testing extensions when the economic conditions allows for that type 
of work. 

The exploration work program & others – Step 1 – 2014/2015 is estimated as follow: 

 

Exploration Budget on the Granada Project (CAN$) 

Trenching (exploration)    $75,000 

Drilling (definition, exploration (0-400m))         $2,500,000 

Geotech Drilling (try to increase pit slope)          $75,000 

Laboratory met testings   $50,000 

Supervision and Technical reports             $150,000 

Deep drilling program Phase 2 targeting mineralization depth (400-1000m) $5,000,000 

Estimated total cost         $7,850,000

15 Mineral Reserve Estimates 

The reserves derived from the detailed pit design have been estimated in accordance with the definitions 
and guidelines adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM Standards on 
Mineral Resources and Reserves). The reserves are based entirely on measured and indicated resources 
and were converted as probable and proven reserves respectively.  

The mineral reserves (with dilution and ore loss) is therefore equal to 569,000 tonnes of ore at an average 
grade of 4.24 g/t Au using cut-off grades of 1.69 g/t and represents an operation of 3.0 years. The entire 
reserve comprises 77,500 ounces of gold (before processing recovery). Total waste, including rock, 
inferred resources and overburden, is 9.3 Mt; resulting in a waste to ore ratio of 16:3. The detailed mineral 
reserve estimate is shown in Table 15-1:

16 Mining Methods 

The mining of Granada deposit will follow the standard practice of an open-pit operation with the 
conventional drill and blast, load and haul cycle, using a drill / truck / excavator mining fleet, and supported 
by a fleet of auxiliary equipment. The run-of-mine (RoM) will be drilled, blasted and loaded by hydraulic 
excavators and delivered by trucks to an ore stockpiling area. The ore will then be loaded onto transport 
trucks and delivered to the Iamgold processing plant, approximately 43 km from the mine site. Waste rock 
material will be hauled to the waste disposal areas near the pits or backfilled into the mined pits.  

It has been assumed that the mining of the Granada deposit will be carried out by a mining fleet that will 
be leased and maintained by the Owner. An alternative option would be to contract out all activities related 
to mining, but this was not incorporated into the PFS.  

16.1 OVERALL PIT SLOPE ANGLE 

SGS mandated GoldMinds to assist with the pit and waste dump slope design component of the Pre-
Feasibility Study. The objectives of the study were to model and provide parameters for designs. 

 Soil and rock characterization; 
 Overburden slope configurations; 
 Rock slope configurations; 
 Recommendations concerning slope stability. 

 

SGS/GoldMinds carried out preliminary site investigation field visits in 2013 especially for site location for 
an onsite mill scenario and a tailing ponds possible location. A geotechnical drilling program was 
prepared. As scenario was about to change to custom milling, the extensive geotechnical program was 
postponed. As the scenario has changed not as much room was required. Information gathered in the field 
has allowed selection of the sites with the most favourable parameters in terms of stability and the lowest 
impact on the environment and the community. 

A short geotechnical drilling program will be required in order to increase the pit slope if client wishes to 
have steeper walls. This is in addition to complementary geotechnical drilling for the north end of the North 
dump to verify if installation of a geotechnical key will be required. Sum portions have soil between 
outcrops and may require local fine tuning.   

16.1.1 OVERBURDEN 
Overburden in the pit area is mainly made of glacial till with sand and gravels. Of course a portion of the 
overburden in the sector of the study is made of older waste rock making a patio. 

Overburden is relatively shallow compared to other projects in the Abitibi region.  

In the waste dump sectors significant amount of outcrops are present. The first dump to be used is the 
most eastward and overburden thickness is less than a 1 meter. The top soil and base till with clayish 
content should be bulldozed and preserve for reclamation.  As well as the first dump, the covers should be 
stripped for further use. This should basically bring most of the waste dump to sit directly on the bedrock 
or overburden less than 2 meters. As previously mentioned should a sector with greater overburden be 
encountered during site preparation, specific localised geotechnical drilling may be required to increase 
the stability by preparation of a Key at the bottom of the slope. For those not familiar with the geotechnical 
key in a waste dump; it is the extraction of the soil by trench and replacement by rock of coarse size to 
increase friction. The position of the Key is usually covered by a minimum of one bench of material to 
increase its shear resistance. The author has already used this technique to guarantee stability of dumps 
at Bedford and Marbleton Québec. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 164
 

The observed overburden in the area of the project is not considered sensitive. 

The contact between the bedrock and overburden is sharp, with the bedrock along the contact showing a 
slight weathering profile consistent with increased fracturing and slightly weaker material. The rock shows 
good rock mass quality. The main geological feature that will be seen along the pit walls at Granada is the 
bedding of the conglomerates which strikes east-west and dips northward (i.e., strike/dip = 260°/45°-65°) 
and is characterized by hydrothermal alteration around the quartz vein system. There are also some NNE-
SSW faults and some minor faults. The Granada conglomeratic formation occurs south of the Cadillac 
Fault. 

16.1.2 OVERBURDEN SLOPE CONFIGURATION 
The pit slope recommendations for the overburden are: 

 Maximum slope height of 10 m; 
 Bench face (or batter) angles of 38°  
 Bench heights of 5 with 2 meters berm with an overall slope of 31° should generally be suitable 

within the material observed at the areas of work. 
 

The excavability, workability and trafficability of the overburden during the pit development and the stability 
of the overburden slopes are strongly dependent upon the location of the phreatic surface/groundwater 
level in each of the main soil units. Adequate drainage of overburden slopes, both during and after 
excavation, is necessary to minimize pore pressures in the slope face and maintain slope stability. 

Recommendation concerning the overburden slope stability should be oriented at preparing drainage 
ditches which should be installed along the outside perimeter of the pit in order to collect and channel 
surface water away from the pit slopes;  

16.1.3 ROCK SLOPE CONFIGURATION 
The main consideration for the rock slope configurations within the planned Granada small pits within the 
fresh bedrock remain for rock slope failure mechanisms would be to structurally control mechanisms 
(kinematics), including planar, wedge and toppling. Review of similar conditions has been done in addition 
to validation of the existing slope that was achieved without failure in the old pit number one. The current 
configuration as shown in design sections in dry conditions brings the safety factor above 2 overall. This 
does not prevent local wedging events and the personal will have to monitor the pit slope for verification of 
the wall conditions. 

16.1.4 PIT SLOPE PARAMETERS 
The slope specifications and benching arrangements were provided by GoldMinds Geoservices Inc. Slope 
analysis by GoldMinds relies on RQD data analysis and mostly existing pit slope conditions which were 
proved stable at Granada. The slopes were provided as constant values for the entire pit (i.e. there were 
no sector divisions). The slopes and the definition of each technical term relating to benching configuration 
are shown in the Figure 16-1. 

 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 165
 

 
Figure 16-1: Definition of Slope and Benching Configuration 

GoldMinds Geoservices provided recommendations for overburden slope of 30°, a bench face angle of 
85°, inter-ramp angle of 55°, and a double-benching configuration (10m). The block height in the model is 
5m; therefore the design assumption is that berms of 7.4m will appear at intervals of two block heights 
(10m bench height).  

The recommended slopes are assuming dry conditions. Particular attention should be made to the 
dewatering of the pit, for each phase of excavation. In addition to follow-up on the behaviour of the NNE 
fault system which could generate wedges. Possibility to increase slope angle on the north wall, it will 
require additional drilling and oriented core at the scheduled face.  

Regarding the pits which will mine over old workings of 1935, the detailed procedures will have to be put 
in place for the second year of operation since the first pit is into a never before mined sector. Basically 
once dewatering of the old pit (exception of old pit number one) investigation by CMS and laser scanning 
will be possible. The authors do not recommend the use of SONAR within drillhole for now as existing old 
workings could temporarily be accessed by Men in proper security conditions. Existing historical plans 
show that these openings should only be encountered at the bottom of the Western pit East of old pit 
number one. They should not affect significantly the mining operations as they are thin at 45 to 55 degrees 
but will require proper identification in 3D with procedures prior to operation in their vicinity.

16.2 PIT OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE AND PARAMETERS 

In order to develop an optimal engineered pit design for the Granada deposit, an optimized pit shell was 
first prepared using the Lerchs-Grossman 3D routine in Gems Whittle ("LG 3D"). The basic optimization 
principle of the algorithm operates on a net value calculation for each block in the model, in other words 
revenue from sales less total operating cost; mining, processing, and general and administration costs. 

In accordance with the guidelines of the NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mine Metallurgy and 
Petroleum Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, blocks classified in the 
Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories are allowed to drive the pit optimizer for a Preliminary 
Economic Assessment Study. 

For the initial optimization, the required parameters were selected by SGS to evaluate the most economic 
open-pit profile. Although these parameters are not necessarily final, a reasonable degree of accuracy is 
required, since the analysis is an iterative process. The economic and operating parameters used in the 
initial optimization are given in the Table 16-1. 

 

 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 168
 

 

 

Table 16-1: Open pit Optimization Parameters 

 

Note: The economic and operational parameters used at the time of the pit optimization do not necessarily 
confirm those stated in the economic model 

 

16.3 THEORETICAL PIT SHELL 

Using the parameters presented above, the LG 3D pit optimizer was carried out to generate an optimum 
pit shell having the highest undiscounted cash flow. A three dimensional (3D) and plan view of the 
resulting LG 3D pit shells are shown in Figure16-5. As can be seen in the Figure 16-5, the optimized pit 
shell of the Granada deposit is divided into few separated mining areas and is overlapping, in some 
locations, on the old open-pits. 

 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 169
 

 
Figure 16-5: 3D and Plan view of the optimized shell 

The theoretical pit shell resulting from the LG 3D optimization is only preliminary in nature and does not 
represent a practical design for mining, since it does not include an access ramp system or proper 
detailed pit slope and benching arrangement. The optimized pit shell will be used to serve as a guide for 
the engineered mine design, completed with the required operational haulage ramp, proper pit slope, and 
benching arrangement as presented in next section. 

16.4 DETAILED MINE DESIGN 

Using the base case shell as reference, an open-pit including a ramp and safety berms was designed to 
develop a more realistic mining scenario. The new designed pit will account for the additional waste 
material coming from the addition of a ramp to the base case shell. The design parameters used are 
defined as: 

• Overall slope angle: 45°- 50° (depending of the ramps locations) 
• Face angle:  85° 
• Bench height:  10 m in waste and 5 m in ore 
• Safety berm:  7.5 m width (1 safety berm at each 10 m vertically) 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 170
 

• Ramp grade:  12.0 % (single lane) and 10.0 % (two-lane) 
• Ramp width:  13.5 m (single lane) and 18.3 m (two-lane) 

 

The following figures (Figure 16-6 and Figure 16-7) showed a section view of the hauling ramp and the 
designed open-pit with his dimensions.

Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 171
 

 
Figure 16-7: 3D and Plan view of the detailed pit 

As it can be seen in Figure 16-7, four (4) pits were created. The numbers of isolated pits is lower that the 
optimization output. SGS decided to not consider some of them due to their high stripping ratio and their 
low profitability. 

The in-pit haulage two-lane ramp, having a 10% slope, is designed at 18.3 m wide to accommodate two 
35 tonne class mining trucks, with allocation for safety berms. This ramp will provide sufficient room for 
two-way traffic to maximize the truck cycle time and productivities. A single lane ramp of 13.5 m wide and 
having a 12.0 % slope will be used for the last benches in the pit bottom, where double lane traffic is not 
required. This is to minimize the overall stripping ratio of the pit. SGS tried to exit the ramps to the north 
sides of the pits to facilitate an easy and short access to the waste rock piles.  

The dimensions of the four (4) pits are presented in the following Figures, as the in-pits resource blocks 
above a cut-off grade of 1.69 g/t Au.

16.5 DILUTION AND ORE LOSS 

Using the designed open-pits, SGS reviewed the estimation of the mining dilution and ore loss that was 
presented in section named Pit Optimization Procedure and Parameters. 

SGS came to the conclusion that given the pits shapes, size and geometrical characteristics of the 
deposit, the mining dilution and ore loss factors have been assumed at 25.0 % at 0.0 g/t Au and 10.0 % 
respectively. These assumptions are based on a comparison of the characteristics of the deposit and the 
mining method with similar projects. 

 

16.6 MARGINAL CUT-OFF GRADE 

The marginal cut-off grade or milling cut-off grade (CoG) is used to classify the material inside the pit limits 
as in-pit reserve or waste. Since the material is located inside the pit, the marginal cut-off grade excludes 
the mining cost and corresponds to the grade required to cover the costs of processing, G&A, and other 
costs related to transport. The marginal cut-off is defined as: 

 

Resulting Marginal CoG =
Total Resource Based Cost x (1 + %Mining Dilution)

Resulting Metal Price x Processing Recovery
 

 

During the preparation of this PFS and with the consideration of the detailed open-pits, SGS reviewed the 
estimation of the total ore based cost that was presented in section named Pit Optimization Procedure and 
Parameters to an updated value of 57.75 $/t (refer to section 21 for the details of the construction of this 
cost). 

The resulting cut-off grade (CoG) is therefore equal to: 

 

Resulting Marginal CoG =
57.75 $/t x (1 + 25 %)
44.89 $/gram x 95 %

= 1.69 g t⁄ Au 

 

16.7 TONNES WITHIN PIT DESIGN 

Based on the previously defined mining dilution, ore loss and marginal cut-off grade, the tonnage 
contained inside the pit design is presented in Table 16-2. For clarification purposes, the term pit design 
represents the summation of the 4 isolated pits presented previously.

16.8 MINE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 

A mine production schedule was prepared for the development and the operation of the Project. The 
mining production schedule for the open pit is based on a pre-stripping period of approximately 3 months. 
The results of the developed schedule are summarized in Table 16-3 and presented by next Figures 
(Figure 16-9, Figure 16-10, Figure 16-11 and Figure 16-12). Key findings include:  

 

• Project life of 3 years, with an ore mining rate of approximately 550 tonnes per day;  
• Mill feed over the Project life of 569,000 tonnes at 4.24 g/t Au;  
• Gold production of 73,600 ounces.

16.9 MINE OPERATIONS 

The proposed schedule for the open-pit operations is based on two 8-hour shifts per day, 7 days a week 
and 350 days per year. The mining operations at Granada will use conventional mining methods, including 
drilling and blasting sequences, loading with hydraulic excavators and hauling with off-road mining trucks. 
The selection of two 8-hour shifts is based mainly on the fact that this schedule will avoid any possible 
disturbing of the neighborhood during the night. 

16.9.1 DRILLING 
Blast holes drilling will be performed by diesel drilling units. All holes will be drilled with a diameter of 5.0 
inch (12.7 cm), on a 4.0 m x 4.0 m pattern. Due to the overall average low dip of the mineralized zones, 
between 35° to 50°, the working bench height is planned at 5.0 m. Table 16-4 is a summary of the 
parameters selected for the blast hole drilling. 

 
Table 16-4: Drilling Parameters & Assumptions 

 
The total number of drills required for the maximum production is estimated at one unit, as shown in the 
Table 16-5, for a daily tonnage varying from 7,500 to 10,500 tonnes per day.

16.9.2 BLASTING 
This operation will be under a subcontract with an explosive contractor (supplier) that will take control of all 
blasting operations, explosive and detonators supply and loading and connecting the blasts. The project 
will benefit from being close to major suppliers with blasting supplies and experience. The regular powder 
factor is estimated at 0.30 kg/tonne, both in ore and waste, using emulsion type explosive having a density 
of 1.28 g/cm3. Table 16-6 summarizes the parameters retained for the production estimations. 

Table 16-6: Blasting parameters 

 

Emulsion-type explosive were selected due to his good water resistance and its better overall 
performance when compared to other explosives like the Amex products. Non electric detonators, like the 
Nonel type are recommended. Blasting results will determine if electronic detonators should be preferred. 

 

16.9.3 FLEET REQUIREMENTS 
Production will be accomplished using a fleet of 35 tonnes capacity haul trucks and hydraulic shovels with 
a 5 tonnes bucket capacity. This fleet combination should allow for 5-6 pass loading of trucks hauling 
mineralized material and waste for a loading time estimated at 3.5 minutes. The requirements for the 
primary mining equipment include; a fleet of drills haul trucks, shovels, and one supporting wheel loader, 
which are based on the haul distances, equipment availability, utilization, and overall productivity data. 
Availability profiles for major equipment have been estimated using SGS's database and internal 
operational experience.  

The truck fleet consists of units having a payload capacity of 35 tonnes (Volvo A35 or equivalent). A 
maximum of seven (7) trucks will be necessary to support the mine productivity at year 2, along with the 
waste removal schedule (rock and overburden). Operating truck requirements were determined using the 
appropriate operating time parameters, fill factors, haulage distances and cycle times, and tonnes to be 
moved by material type. The truck fleet size was calculated using a mechanical availability of 90% and an 
efficiency of 85 %. The gross operating hours used for the operating truck calculation are based on a 2 x 8 
hours shift work schedule and depend upon the variable mechanical availability. 

The proposed hydraulic shovel fleet consists of 5 tonnes front-end configured units for loading the blasted 
ore, waste rock, and overburden. Annual shovel productivity was determined using the appropriate 
operating time parameters, fill factors, material properties, and bucket capacities. Two shovels will be 
required for the entire duration of the operation. In addition, one wheel loader will assist in the loading of 
ROM in cases where the main loading equipment is temporarily unavailable or when temporary additional 
loading production is required. 

One operating drill is also required to satisfy production.

Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 180
 

 

Notes: 

The reason behind the small mechanical crew is due to proximity of the services available in Rouyn-
Noranda. During peak periods, external mechanical would be requested to assist.  

16.10 PIT DEWATERING 

According to the Roche Ltd Consulting Group preliminary report, dated October 02, 2013, a constant 
pumping water flow rate of 1,240m3/day (228 US GPM) will maintain the future open pits dry. For the PFS 
estimation of dewatering costs and pump purchase a maximum water flow rate of 2,500m3/day was 
retained, which represents twice the estimated constant flow rate. In accordance to the Roche study, the 
Bruère River was chosen as the discharge area. This area is located at a distance of 1,600 m north east 
and about 35 m below the existing and future pits. To proceed with the safe dewatering of the production it 
is recommended to have a spare pump for every active pump. 

It is assumed that the water lines and accessories used during the existing pits dewatering will be left in 
place for the future pits production. The dewatering is planned to be done with submersible type pumps 
only. 

 

16.11 ORE LOADING AND TRANSPORT 

As discussed previously, ore material will be put on the temporary stockpile (Pad capacity of 15,000 to 
20,000 t) on-site for short period of time as the main ore stockpile should be located at IMG gold milling 
facility (Pad capacity between 60,000 to 70,000 t). A transport contractor will take care of transporting the 
run-of-mine ore to the selected processing plant by highway trucks (using 35 tonnes trucks). The distance 
is estimated at 46 km Pad to Pad and an estimated traveling time of one hour one direction. The detailed 
finale schedule is not completed yet. GBB with its consultants have contacted the School board and 
summer camp responsible of the town of Rouyn-Noranda to address traffic time concerns. The company 
do not intend to haul material during the night as well as there is limited to no traffic haulage during kids 
arrival and departure of the Granada school. Alternative routes have been studied and the presented path 
is the one which meets regulations to the provincial and municipal level. The path has been studied with 
the technical counsel of the town of Rouyn-Noranda. 

 
Figure 16-13: Ore transport from mine to processing plant 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 181
 

Moreover there are actually discussions with the town of Rouyn technical team on modification of a small 
portion of the identified route at Granada village. This change would be made to accommodate concerns 
of resident of the Granada village about long term haulage trucks in the village. After second public 
meeting GoldMinds for GBB has identified an alternative route where trucks could by-pass the village of 
Granada and avoid circulation near the school. This modified path is currently under evaluation and 
discussion with the town of Rouyn and would not require significant investment. 

The project mining and haulage schedule which subject to signature of the final custom milling agreement 
and reception of the Certificate of Authorisation from the MDDELCC is shown in Figure 16-14. 

 
Figure 16-14: Project mining and haulage schedule 

 

16.12 OLD UNDERGROUND EXCAVATIONS 

It has been since 1930 that the Granada project is sporadically mined. Consequently, old underground 
excavations are present and need to be considered if mining is re-started. 

The first pit is in a Greenfield zone where no underground mining has proceed. It is scheduled to proceed 
with 3D scanning of openings and survey once water level allows access to the openings. Old 
underground drift location have been put in plan but exact position are not considered exact for the mining 
operation and the company should complete a detailed survey once access is possible using laser 
scanner, surface survey with GPR to model openings. 

Procedures will have to be put in place for the accurate survey of the openings before getting into their 
vicinity. As the mining width of the old time is relatively thin and no huge openings are present in 
documents, the procedure should be relatively simple and limited ore drop to the level should occur.  

It is important to mention that as per existing information only a portion of the bottom of the pit to the west 
should cross small underground openings.

17 Recovery Method 

17.1 GENERAL 

At least for some time, all ore from the Gold Bullion project will be processed in batches at the Iamgold-
Doyon mill (IMG) (Figure 17-1). The mill originally built in the 1970's was completely refurbished between 
2011 and 2013 in order to efficiently process the Westwood ore. 

The actual scenario for Gold Bullion (GBB) is to mine by open pit between 175,000 and 200,000 tonnes of 
ore per year at a rate of 550 tonnes per day and have the ore processed at IMG. The IMG mill has ample 
capacity to process some 2,420 tonnes of ore from the Westwood Mine every day. But for the first two 
years, due to mine development, the ore from the Westwood Mine will be processed at a rate of only 
600,000 tpy or some 2,380 tpd, five days per week. Subsequently, the tonnage will eventually increase 
gradually to reach the annual nominal capacity of 850,000 tpy at the beginning of the fourth year. In the 
mean time the Gold Bullion ore will permit to close part of the gap between the Westwood Mine 
throughput and the IMG mill nominal capacity of 3,200 tpd. 

The original scenario between GBB and IMG was in line with 50,000 tonne batches, every 63 to 64 days 
IMG would stop milling the Westwood ore for a period of 15 days and will process the GBB ore at a rate of 
2400 tpd, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. To ensure that the IMG mill never runs short of ore during 
the 15 days allotted to GBB, the mill will stop processing the Westwood ore only when at least 30,000 
tonnes of the GBB ore will be stockpiled at Doyon and another 20,000 tonnes stockpiled at Granada. 

As per recent discussion between GBB and IMG at the moment of completing this report, 3 periods to 
process the ore in batches are now identified. A minimum of 30,000 tonnes still exist, the new batches 
aimed at processing 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes batches in April, July & November. This to avoid any 
freezing muck issues in the ore bins. The general schedule is presented in previous section 16.2. 

In order for GBB and IMG to settle for the gold and silver recovered from GBB's ore, in addition to the 
tonnage calculation, the normal daily mill sampling, the weighing and the analysing of the doré bars, the 
mill will be surveyed and gold inventory will be taken all over the mill at the beginning and end of each 
batches.

Figure 17-1: Doyon site – Surface plan 

17.2 ORE HANDLING – CRUSHING – GRINDING - GRAVITY 

The ore having an average grade of 4.24 g/t will be hauled by trucks on a distance of approximately 43 km 
from the Granada mine to IMG and discharged on a dedicated pad nearby the crusher house. When 
convenient, the ore will be dumped directly on the 27" aperture crusher hopper grizzly by the incoming 
trucks. If not, the ore will be retrieved from the pad and delivered to the surface crusher with a front end 
loader. Oversize will be left aside or break with the existing hydraulic rock breaker. Crushing is done with a 
1.07 m x 1.22 m jaw crusher and the crushed ore is conveyed to the two 2,800 tonne mill ore bins. 

Grinding of the Granada ore will be done using the 2,700 HP SAG mill in close circuit with a primary 
battery of 500 mm hydrocyclones. Cyclones overflow feeds a 1,000 HP ball mill in close circuit with a 
secondary battery of 600 mm hydrocyclones. Because of the smaller size of the Knelson concentrator 
(30"), it is possible that only a portion of the secondary hydrocyclones underflow will pass by the gravity 
separator to be followed by a Gemini shaking table. The other portion, or the whole gravity separator 
tailings, as the case may be, will report to the 1,000 HP ball mill. The gravity circuit concentrate will go 
directly to the refinery.  Secondary cyclone overflow reports by gravity to the 27 m leaching thickener. 

For the purpose of this report, it is assumed that the Granada ore grinding characteristics are similar to the 
Westwood and Doyon ores. The targeted grinding size is 80% passing 74 microns (200 mesh). 

(Drawing GR 2014-01)2  APPENDIX 2 

2 Mill flowsheets are included less for their exactitude but to give an idea of the mass and water balance. 

 

 

                                                      



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 184
 

17.3 CARBON IN LEACH – CARBON IN PULP 

The existing leaching circuit remained the same as it was when Doyon was processing its own ore. The 
circuit has a 60-hour retention time at the mill nominal feed rate of 3,200 tpd. Since the Granada ore 
needs only 48 hours to get +95% gold dissolution, in order not to over cyanide and risking to reprecipitate 
the gold in the in the last leaching tanks, tanks 155 and 160 may be bypassed. The circuit will thus 
comprise 5 primary and 2 secondary CIL tanks followed by 5 CIP tanks. Loaded carbon is screened and 
reports to the loaded carbon tank. Leaching tails undergo the cyanide destruction circuit. 

(Drawing GR 2014-02) APPENDIX 2 

17.4 CARBON ELUTION – REFINING 

The carbon elution – refining circuit comprises mainly a loaded carbon tank, an acid wash tank, a carbon 
strip vessel, a bank of electrowinning cells and an induction furnace. Stripped carbon is reactivated in a 
horizontal kiln, quenched and classified. Classifier oversize is ready to be reused while very fine carbon 
particles are filtered in a filter press and sent to the Xstrata Horne smelter. 

(Drawing GR 2014-03) APPENDIX 2 

17.5 CYANIDE DESTRUCTION – DESULFURIZATION - TAILINGS 

The tailings from the CIP circuit will be treated in the mill SO2-AIR cyanide destruction plant to eliminate 
the cyanide. The cyanide destruction circuit comprises mainly two 250 m3 reactors in parallel in which 
SO2 is added probably on the form of sodium bisulphite. Air is injected to the reactors with a blower. If 
needed, some lime and copper sulfate could be added to the reactors. 

If required by IMG, prior to be sent to the tailings ponds the mill tailings will be desulfurized. Main 
desulfurization machinery includes two 2.8 m x 3 m conditioners, one 20 m3 rougher unit cell and 2 banks 
of four DR-180 scavenger flotation cells. Concentrate will be pumped to the Westwood 20 m paste backfill 
thickener while the desulfurization tailings will report to the main tailings pond. 

The flotation (desulfurization) tailings will be pumped to the tailings pond 3 West and allowed to settle. 
Supernatant water will then be pumped to the polishing pond 3 East. Clear water from the polishing pond 
will finally be pumped to the process water reservoir. 

(Drawing GR2014 – 04) APPENDIX 2 

17.6 GOLD RECOVERY 

Based on previous metallurgical testing (See Chapter 13) it is probable that 50% of the gold will be 
recovered at the gravity circuit and out of the remaining 50%, another 90% will be recovered from the 
leaching of the gravity tailings for a total gold recovery of 95%. 

17.7 GOLD PRODUCTION SETTLEMENT 

Because it is not possible to avoid some ore mixing at the beginning and end of each batches, GBB an 
IMG will have title to and ownership of the doré bars on a pro rata basis based on the respective amounts 
of refined gold attributable to each of the companies.

18 Project Infrastructure 

The Granada Project will require the construction of several components and facilities which will all be 
located at the mine site. The following section describes the major components of the required 
constructions and the general layout is shown in the Figure 18-1. 

 
Figure 18-1: Aerial view of site layout of Granada project 

18.1 PROCESSING FACILITIES 

No processing facilities will be erected on site as all the ore material will be treated at an external plant. 
Please refer to section 17 for a complete presentation of this specific item. 

18.2 OFFICES 

Considering the short mine life, a series of office trailer, as shown in the Figure 18-2 below, will be used as 
offices. The advantage of using this kind of offices is that they are cheap to buy or they can be rented 
depending on the needs. Actually, two of these trailers are currently on the site and it is planned to acquire 
3 others to accommodate the staff personal. In addition to the two actual trailers, a steel cladding and 
roofing building is currently (Figure 18-3) on site and is planned to be used for the sanitary facilities and 
mine dry, first aid facilities, small repair shop and secondary warehouse.

18.3 MECHANICAL GARAGE 

A ±1,200 m² building will be used as mechanical garage (Figure 18-4). The building will a dome type 
structure composed of high tension galvanized steel frame and a reinforced polyethylene cover. The 
mechanical garage will be filled with standard mechanical tools and a lift truck will be used to manipulate 
heavy parts. A used oil recovery system will be built adjacent to the building. The garage will be 
constructed directly on compacted gravel covering a geo-textile membrane.

Figure 18-4: Example of a dome type mechanical garage 

18.4 WAREHOUSE/LAYDOWN YARD 

A ±1000 m² building will be used as main warehouse. The building will a dome type structure composed of 
high tension galvanized steel frame and a reinforced polyethylene cover. An outside area, adjacent to the 
warehouse building will be reserved to store large size consumables, such as drill rods, steel products, 
etc. 

18.5 POWERLINE 

A 280 m powerline extension will be required to connect the planned infrastructures to the actual power 
line following the Granada Avenue. This extension will remain basic with a requirement of approximately 5 
wood poles and a small portable power center including transformers and output circuit of approximately 
400 kW. The portable power center will be covered and will also be isolated with metallic fencing (Figure 
18-5).

Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 188
 

18.6 EXPLOSIVES MAGAZINES  

Two small explosive magazines will be required to store standard explosive accessories such as 
detonators and boosters. These magazines (Figure 18-6) will have to be strategically located and isolated 
with a berm in order to respect safety regulations. Bulk explosives will be transported by truck by an 
explosive contractor so there is no need for bulk storage. 

 
Figure 18-6: Example of an explosive magazine 

18.7 FUEL FARM  

A 15,000 gallons fuel tank will be required on site in order to fuel the vehicles and the mining equipment. 
The fuel tank (Figure 18-7) will be annexed to a pumping station and an environment friendly arrangement 
will be built using a geo-textile membrane to contain any potential spill. The fuel tank will be fuelled from 
local distributors that will go on site upon request. 

 
Figure 18-7: Example of a fuel farm arrangement 

18.8 ON-SITE ROADS  

An arrangement of gravel road will be built on site using waste rock coming from the mining exploitation. 
The roads will be built progressively depending of the mining sequence. The base of the roads will be 
composed of run-of-mine material and the top will covered with crushed rock. A total of approximately 1.5 
km of road will be required. The width of these roads will be wide enough to accommodate 3 times the 
operating width of the biggest hauling equipment, so approximately 15 m (3 times 5 meters). 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 189
 

18.9 WASTE MATERIAL STOCKPILES 

18.9.1 SLOPE PARAMETERS 
The slope specifications and benching arrangements were provided by GoldMinds Geoservices Inc. Slope 
analysis by GoldMinds relies on presumed coarse muck size and mostly existing waste dump slope 
conditions which were proved stable at Granada at 45 degrees. The slopes were provided as constant 
values for the entire dumps (i.e. there were no sector divisions). For the foundation as previously 
mentioned above, most of the dumps should be sitting directly on the competent bedrock and/or 
overburden less than 2 meters. Waste dump stability should not be an issue at Granada. In fact overall 
slope configuration has been prepared not as optimizing the slope but more in reducing the slope to have 
a suitable slope for reclamation and long term stability. 

The overburden dump is designed (Figure 18-8) as a heritage hill, but in reality most of the material will be 
used for reclamation purposes during the life of the project with progressive reclamation. Most of the pile 
will site on the Bedrock foundation or overburden less than 2 meters. 

Overburden dump parameters: 

• Berms: 2 meters 
• Bench height: 5 meters 
• Batter angle 38 
• Overall angle maximum 31 
• Maximum height 35 meters

• Overall angle 24 
• Maximum height 45 meters 

 

 

 

Figure 18-9: Waste Dump profiles number 1 and number 2 

 

18.9.2 WASTE ROCK STOCKPILE  
Two waste rock material stockpiles will be erected at the proximity of the open-pit. These stockpiles will be 
composed of rock material that does not contain enough mineralized material to be economically 
processed. The piles will be strategically located to minimize hauling distances, and thus the size of the 
mining fleet. The piles will be deserved by a 10 % access ramp having a width of 18.3 meters. The piles 
(refer to next Figure) will have the following configuration (Table 18-1 and Figure 18-1):

Figure 18-10: Proposed rock waste dumps locations 

 

18.9.3 OVERBURDEN STOCKPILE  
An overburden material stockpile will be erected at the North of the property. This stockpile will be primary 
composed of top soil material that will need to be removed in the first operational years in order to reach 
hard rock material containing mineralization. The pile will be strategically located to minimize hauling 
distances, and thus the size of the mining fleet. The pile will be designed with a 10 % access ramp having 
a width of 18.3 meters. The pile will have the following configuration shown in Table 18-2 and in Figure 
18-11:

18.9.4 SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS 
The slope stability analysis has been done with reduced material properties in order to increase the level 
of the security factor for the long term at the beginning from the analysis of existing slope conditions at the 
site for the waste dump.  

The analysis is based on a hill of 38 m in height with an overall slope angle presumed after reclamation of 
25 degrees sitting on 1.8 meters of sand and gravel which is on bedrock. The top surface layer of organic 
reclamation material has not been included as non-significant for the slope stability at larger scale. The 
GoldMinds slope stability analysis has been performed with the software Slide developed by Rocscience.

The static analysis presents a Security Factor (SF) above 1.5 (see Figure 18-12). For the analysis with 
seismic activity and a saturated sand-gravel unit, the SF remains above 1.25 (see Figure 18-13). An 
additional forced failure with irregular path within the base with saturated overburden and light seismic 
activity shows a SF of 1.48 (Figure 18-14).

Figure 18-14: Slope stability analysis with seismic activity and saturated overburden in force failure plane 

 

GoldMinds concludes that supplied designs for the dumps and pits are adequate in a context where 
surface water is controlled. Water pressure could reduce slope stability of the presented designs. It is 
unlikely that waste dumps will be submerged, however attention to pit walls during operation should take 
place and the operator should control and maintain low water pressure in the pit walls to secure long term 
stability. 

18.10 ORE STOCKPILE PAD 

An ore stockpile will be required in order to store the ore material prior to transport. Mining hauling trucks 
will dump the ore material to a specific location near the open-pit (the ore stockpile pad) and the transport 
contractor will load his highway trucks from there. The pad will be built with aggregate material covering a 
geo-textile membrane. The membrane will be required to contain the runoff water that will flow through the 
mineralized material. The area reserved for the ore stockpile will allow a quantity of approximately 15,000 
tonnes stored, which is equivalent to 25 days of ore mining.  

18.11 ACCESS ROAD AND PARKING 

An upgrade of the actual access road will be done in order to accommodate any type of vehicles. The 
access road will be upgraded/built with aggregate and will have a standard width of approximately 12 
meters. A parking lot will also be constructed with aggregate in order to accommodate approximately 40 
vehicles. A second lane should be developed on the Granada Avenue in order to give time and room to 
resident to pass haulage trucks entering the Avenue on the northern direction. 

18.12 WATER POND – POLISHING POND 

The polishing pond has an initial capacity of approximately 21,000 cubic meters for a 1.5 meters depth, 
the design by GMG presents a design for approximately 40,000 cubic meters at 3 meters deep. It is 
located in the north east part of the project. Water pumped from the pits dewatering process and operation 
will travel by pipe into the basin.

The Figure 18-15 and Figure 18-16 present the preliminary design in plan view and typical profile of the 
dyke making the pond. 

The exit design is to be completed prior to construction as a concrete sill with rock embankment (riprap) or 
entirely with rock embankment. The syphon approached is not considered for this design. The design for 
chemical addition if necessary is not included in the drawing as the system will be a solution provider 
based and he has not been selected yet.

19 Market Studies and Contracts 

At this date, Gold Bullion does not have a contract with a refinery to treat (and pay for) its anticipated gold 
production from the Granada Project. However as per custom milling agreement for metal balance and 
gold refining, the production will be refined at the same place as Iamgold Westwood production unless 
there is a change. 

G gold market is categorized as an open-market and for the purpose of this study, SGS made the 
assumption that Gold Bullion will sell all its production to regular gold buyers. The 14 years trend in Figure 
19-1 shows average gold price has significantly increased from the year 2000. After reaching stellar price 
per ounce in the 1800$Us/Oz the recent years price has stayed in the 1200 to 1400US$/Oz range. 

 

 
Figure 19-1: Gold price chart (2000-2014) 

 

The gold metal bullions and bars can be sold on spot market or by contract. The author is not aware of 
any specific contract at the moment of completing this technical report. Historically the precious metals 
price retained in economical studies was the average spot prices of the last three years, which is made of 
1572US$/Oz for 2011, 1669US$/Oz for 2012 and 1411US$/Oz for 2013 complete years, for 2014 up to 
now average is 1289US $/oz Au, as shown below in Figure 19-2, Figure 19-3, Figure 19-4, and  Figure 
19-5 from Kitco. The 3 years average 2011-2013 gives 1550 US$/Oz. Adding the 2014 as a full year 
weight, would bring the average gold price to 1485 US$/Oz. 

Gold Bullion management has required SGS Geostat to present a robust rolling start and for this reason 
the gold price per ounce of 1260US$/Oz was selected. As the mine is in Canada, exchange rate of 0.9 US 
to Can was used. The gold base price of the study is Can$1400/Oz of Au. 

The graph of the 2014 US$ Gold price shows relative stability for the first half of the year as shown in 
Figure 19-6.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community 
Impact 

20.1 JURISDICTIONS AND APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS  

The legal framework for the construction and operation of the projected facilities is a combination of 
provincial, national, and municipal policies, regulations and guidelines. The design and the environmental 
management of the project facilities and activities must be done in accordance with this legal framework. 

20.1.1 PROVINCIAL FRAMEWORK 
20.1.1.1 Recent Modifications to the Mining Act 

The Quebec Mining Act has been substantially amended and modernized by Bill 70, which the Quebec 
National Assembly adopted on December 9, 2013. This fourth attempt to update Quebec's mining 
legislation follows on the heels of the defeat of Bill 43 and that of Bills 79 and 14 in previous legislative 
sessions. Within the specific context of the Granada Gold Project, the following amendments are relevant: 

• Provisions specific to aboriginal communities and referring to an aboriginal community 
consultation policy specific to the mining sector (obligation to consult aboriginal communities and 
requires the Minister to consult aboriginal communities separately if the circumstances so 
warrant). 

• On each anniversary date of a mining lease or mining concession, the lessee or grantee will have 
to send the Minister a report showing the quantity of ore extracted during the previous year, its 
value, the duties paid under the Mining Tax Act during that period and the overall contributions 
paid. 

• Mining leases to be issued will require the prior approval of a rehabilitation and restoration plan 
and the issue of a certificate of authorization under the Environment Quality Act, unless the time 
needed to obtain a certificate is unreasonable. 

On July 23, 2013, the Government of Quebec first passes amendments to the Regulation respecting 
mineral substances other than petroleum, natural gas and brine in order to set new rules concerning the 
financial guarantees required for the restoration of mining sites. Among other things, those result in an 
increase of the financial guarantee from 70% to 100% of the projected costs for the work required under 
the rehabilitation and restoration plan. The guarantee must cover not only restoration costs associated 
with the accumulation areas, but all costs for the entire mine site and associated infrastructures. It must be 
paid in three annual instalments. The first instalment corresponds to 50% of the total amount of the 
guarantee and must be paid within 90 days following the receipt of the approval of the plan. The second 
and third instalments each represent 25% of the guarantee and must be paid in full by the first and second 
anniversary date. 

Lastly, Bill 70 amends the Regulation respecting environmental impact assessment and review in order to 
require an environmental impact assessment for all metalliferous ore processing plant construction 
projects, all metalliferous mine opening and operation projects where the processing or production 
capacity of the plant or the mine is 2,000 metric tons or more per day. 

20.1.1.2 Québec Procedure relating to the Environmental Assessment of the Project 

Section 31.1 of the Environment Quality Act (EQA) states that "No person may undertake any 
construction, work, activity or operation, or carry out work according to a plan or program, in the cases 
provided for by regulation of the Government without following the environmental impact assessment and 
review procedure and obtaining an authorization certificate from the Government." 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 204
 

Moreover, section 2 of the Regulation respecting Environmental Impact Assessment and Review provides 
the list of projects subject to the environmental impact assessment and review procedure, namely: 

"(n.8) the construction of an ore processing plant for metalliferous ore or asbestos ore, where the 
processing capacity of the plant is 2,000 metric tons or more per day, except in the case of rare 
earth deposits; 

(p) the opening and operation of a metals mine or an asbestos mine that has a production 
capacity of 2,000 metric tons or more per day, except in the case of rare earth deposits; 

Thus, since the Granada Gold Project will have a processing capacity of 550 metric tons per day, it is not 
subject to the provincial environmental impact assessment and review procedure. 

20.1.1.3 Certificates of Authorization (CA) 

General Mining Certificate 

In order to carry out the Granada Gold Project, one or more certificates of authorization (CAs) will be 
required from the MDDELCC under Section 22 of the EQA. A form to which are attached the documents 
and information set out in sections 7 and 8 of the Regulation respecting the Application of the Environment 
Quality Act is included with a C of A application. For mining activities, C of A applications must also 
comply with the Directive 019 requirements.  

Authorization for Water Supply Intakes and Devices for the Treatment of Potable Water and Disposal of 
Wastewater  

An authorization under Section 32 of the EQA is needed for the treatment of potable water (including for 
toilets and showers) and the treatment of wastewaters. Forms must be completed and signed by the 
project engineer, and the required documents must be attached to them. The required documents are 
administrative documents and a technical document to be signed by the project engineer. The application 
for an authorization must be submitted to the MDDELCC regional branch. 

20.1.1.4 Approval  

Approval for the Location of the Waste Dumps 

Under Section 241 of the Mining Act, "Every person responsible for the management of a concentration 
plant, refinery or smelter shall, before commencing activities, have the site intended as a storage yard for 
tailings approved by the Minister. The same applies to every holder of a mining right, owner of mineral 
substances or operator who intends to establish a mine tailings site".  

It should be noted that by definition "tailings" means rejected mineral substances, sludge and water, 
except the final effluent, from extraction operations and ore treatment, and slag from pyrometallurgy 
operations. Therefore, the location of the waste dumps on a mining right must be approved. 

20.1.1.5 Permits 

Forest Management Permit for Mining Activities 

Under Section 73 of the Sustainable Forest Development Act holders of mining rights can obtain forest 
management permits relating to mining activities in order to exercise their rights under the Mining Act. This 
permit holder is allowed to cut timber on the land covered by its mining rights for the construction of 
buildings or any other operations necessary for its mining activities, in compliance with the Sustainable 
Forest Development Act and its regulations. The applicant must have already obtained the right to operate 
the site for mining purposes, a right which is granted by the Mines Division of the MRN. Prior to 
proceeding with its timber cutting operations, the holders of mining rights must submit a written request to 
the MRN forest management unit in order to obtain a permit for its mining operations. The request can be 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 205
 

for the clearing of a site for mining activities, the exploratory boring of a gravel bed or the clearing of a 
gravel or sand pit.  

Due to the design of the Granada project, no commercial forest will be removed.  

High-Risk Petroleum Equipment Operating Permit 

Under Section 120 of the Safety Code, "The owner of a petroleum equipment installation that includes at 
least one component that is high-risk petroleum equipment must obtain a permit for the use of all the high-
risk petroleum equipment situated at the same address, until the equipment is removed from its respective 
place of use". 

A "high-risk" petroleum equipment as defined in Section 8.01 of the Construction Code is having one of 
the following characteristics: 

• For aboveground storage systems: 
o Capacity of 2 500 or more litres, used to store gasoline; 
o Capacity of 10 000 or more litres, used to store diesel; 
o Capacity of 10 000 or more litres, used to store heating oil and heavy fuel oil except for 

equipment used for heating a residential single-family dwelling; 
• Storage tanks used to store gasoline, diesel, heating oil and heavy fuel oil for profit, regardless of 

their capacity. 

The "Application for a Permit for the Use of a High-Risk Petroleum Equipment" form must be completed 
and submitted to the Régie du bâtiment. This application must include all of the information and 
documents identified in Section 121 of the Safety Code. A permit is valid for 24 months. The issuing and 
renewal of a high-risk petroleum equipment permit are subject to compliance and performance monitoring 
under the provisions of the Construction Code and the Safety Code. 

Explosives Permit 

Under the Act respecting Explosives, no person shall possess, store, sell or transport any explosives 
unless he is holding a permit for such purpose. There will be no explosive storage in the Granada project. 

20.1.1.6 Leases 

Mining Lease 

Under Section 100 of the Mining Act, "no person may mine mineral substances, except surface mineral 
substances, petroleum, natural gas and brine, unless he has previously obtained a mining lease from the 
Minister or a mining concession under any former Act relating to mines." 

GBB already have the mining leases for the Granada project except for the small open-pit located west of 
the actual leases. 

Non-Exclusive Lease for the Mining of Surface Mineral Substances 

The mining of sand and gravel located outside of mining leases requires a non-exclusive lease for the 
mining of surface mineral substances, under Section 140 of the Mining Act. The applicant must make a 
request for a non-exclusive lease by completing the "Application for Non-Exclusive Lease (BNE) for 
Mining Surface Mineral Substances" form and providing the documents identified in Section 3 of the form. 

Lease for the Occupation of the Domain of the State 

Under Section 239 of the Mining Act, "the holder of mining rights or the owner of mineral substances may, 
in accordance with the Act respecting the lands in the domain of the State (Chapter T-8.1), obtain that 
public lands be transferred or leased to him to establish a storage site for tailings, or a site for mills, shops 
or facilities necessary for mining activities". Several components of the Granada Project (waste dumps, 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 206
 

overburden dump, polishing pond) might be located outside of the lands covered by the mining lease. 
Since a portion of the project is located on public lands, the land in question will need to be leased under 
Section 47 of the Act respecting the Lands in the Domain of the State.  

20.1.1.7 Rehabilitation and Mine Closure Plan 

Section 232.1 of the Mining Act states that: 

The following persons must submit a rehabilitation and restoration plan to the Minister for approval and 
carry out the work provided for in the plan: 

 (1) every holder of mining rights who engages in exploration work determined by regulation or 
agrees that such work be carried out on the land subject to his mining rights; 

 (2) every operator who engages in mining operations determined by regulation in respect of 
mineral substances listed in the regulations; 

 (3) every person who operates a concentration plant in respect of such substances; 

 (4) every person who engages in mining operations determined by regulation in respect of 
tailings. 

The obligation shall subsist until the work is completed or until a certificate is issued by the 
Minister under section 232.10. 

As stated in Section 101, "the [mining] lease cannot be granted before the rehabilitation and restoration 
plan is approved in accordance with this Act, and the certificate of authorization mentioned in section 22, 
31.5, 164 or 201 of the Environment Quality Act (chapter Q-2) has been issued."  

Hence, a rehabilitation plan will have to be prepared as part of the project and approved by the MRN. The 
rehabilitation and restoration plan should be elaborated in accordance with the provincial Guidelines for 
Preparing a Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan and General Mining Site Rehabilitation Requirements (1997) 
which provides to the proponents the rehabilitation requirements. This study accounts for costs of all 
works needed for the rehabilitation of a mining site following the Regulation respecting Mineral 
Substances other than Petroleum, Natural Gas and Brine. 

20.1.2 FEDERAL FRAMEWORK 
20.1.2.1 Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 

The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA 2012) was introduced on July 6th, 2012. 
Consequently, projects are now examined according to the requirements of this new law. Thus, under the 
CEAA 2012, an environmental assessment focuses on potential adverse environmental effects that are 
within federal jurisdiction, including: 

• Fish and fish habitat; 
• Other aquatic species; 
• Migratory birds; 
• Federal lands; 
• Impacts that will or could potentially cross provincial or international boundaries; 
• Impacts on Aboriginal peoples, such as land use and traditional resources; 
• Impacts that are directly linked or necessarily incidental to any federal decisions about a project. 

An environmental assessment will consider a comprehensive set of factors that include any cumulative 
effect, mitigation measure and comment received from the public.  

Regulations Designating Physical Activities determines the specific activities which constitutes designated 
projects that may require an environmental assessment by the Canadian Environmental Assessment 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 207
 

Agency (hereinafter the CEA Agency) or by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission or the National 
Energy Board. It should be noted that this Regulation was officially amended on October 24, 2013 
(Regulation amending the Regulations Designating Physical Activities). The schedule specifies the 
designated projects that may require an environmental assessment under the responsibility of the CEA 
Agency (Sections 1 to 30), the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (Sections 31 to 38) or the National 
Energy Board (Sections 39 to 45). With regards to the Granada Project, it has been determined that the 
following designated activities are to be considered: 

 "16. The construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of a new […] (c) rare earth 
element mine or gold mine, other than a placer mine, with an ore production capacity of 600 t/day 
or more." 

However, considering the above information, recent experience with the CEAA 2012 and the proposed 
process capacity (550 metric tons per day), the Granada Project is not a designated project and it will not 
consequently have to go through the Canadian environmental assessment process. 

20.1.2.2 Authorization to Alter Fish Habitat 

Section 35 of the Fisheries Act specifies that: 

(1) No person shall carry on any work, undertaking or activity that results in the harmful alteration 
or disruption, or the destruction, of fish habitat. 

(2) A person may carry on a work, undertaking or activity without contravening subsection (1) if: 

(a) the work, undertaking or activity is a prescribed work, undertaking or activity, or is carried on in 
or around prescribed Canadian fisheries waters, and the work, undertaking or activity is carried on 
in accordance with the prescribed conditions; 

(b) the carrying on of the work, undertaking or activity is authorized by the Minister and the work, 
undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the conditions established by the Minister; 

(c) the carrying on of the work, undertaking or activity is authorized by a prescribed person or 
entity and the work, undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the prescribed 
conditions; 

(d) the harmful alteration or disruption, or the destruction, of fish habitat is produced as a result of 
doing anything that is authorized, otherwise permitted or required under this Act; or 

(e) the work, undertaking or activity is carried on in accordance with the regulations. 

When a project includes a known risk of affecting fish and fish habitat, such a project must be submitted to 
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) for its review.  

However, Granada project design was done in a way that no fish habitats will be directly impacted by the 
implementation of any accumulation areas. 

Licence for Explosives Factories and Magazines 

Under Section 7(1) a) of the Explosives Act, a licence issued by the Minister of Natural Resources Canada 
is required for the operation of explosives plants and magazines in Canada. 

However, there will be no explosives plant on site.  

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 208
 

20.2 ORE AND WASTE ROCK ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERIZATION 

20.2.1 METHODOLOGY 
• Three (3) ore samples and eight (8) waste rock samples were selected by Gold Bullion Corp's 

geologists for geochemical characterization. The following geochemical tests have been 
performed on all samples for the environmental characterization of the mining material: 

• Metal contents were determined by partial digestion using aqua regia followed by measurements 
of metals, according to Method MA. 200 – Mét. 1.2 and Method MA. 200 Hg 1.1 for mercury; 

• US EPA Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP 1312) leaching tests were performed 
to simulate the effects of acid rain, according to Method MA.100-Lix.com.1.0 and measurement of 
metals in leachates according to CEAEQ Method MA. 200 – Mét. 1.2 and Method MA. 200 Hg 1.1 
for mercury; 

• Neutralization Potential (NP) according to Modified Sobek ABA Method and Acidification Potential 
(AP) by ASTM Method D-2492-02.   

SPLP test was favored to the US EPA Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP 1311) leaching 
test since it is known to be more representative of future climatic conditions expected over mining 
residues. Furthermore, TCLP test is known to underestimate the arsenic leaching potential, which is an 
important issue to consider in the project since the ore contains arsenopyrite.  

20.2.2 RESULTS 
20.2.2.1 Ore 

Metal Content (environmentally available): The most important metals encountered in the three ore 
samples tested were: iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium and manganese (Table 20-1). Other metals 
were measured at median concentrations lower than 100 mg/kg. 

Concentrations exceeding the A criteria of the Quebec's Soil Protection and Rehabilitation of 
Contaminated Sites Policy (SPRCSP) were measured in at least one sample for arsenic (3), copper (1), 
nickel (1), silver (1) and selenium (1). For most of the parameters, with the exception of arsenic, median 
and average values are below the A criteria. Average arsenic content is 1 400 mg/kg, which exceeds 
significantly the A criteria (5 mg/kg). 

Acid Generating Potential: Sulfides content in the three samples varied from 0.12 to 2.17% with an 
average of 1.03%, which is above the 0.3% criteria of Directive 019 (Table 20-2). Individually, two samples 
present NP/AP ratio (3.1 and 3.2) slightly above Directive 019 criteria (3.0). However, average neutralizing 
potential (NP) is 58.5 mgCaCO3/t, whereas mean acid generation potential (AP) is 32.1 mgCaCO3/t. 
Therefore the NP/AP ratio of all samples was 1.82, which is below the Directive 019 criteria. 

Furthermore, cyanide testing was performed in 2013 at URSTM laboratory on a ore composite sample. 
Sulfides content was1.23 % with an AP of 38.4 mgCaCO3/t and a NP of 65.2 mgCaCO3/t (NP/AP ratio = 
1.7). These results were similar to the results of individual samples.  

Leaching Potential:  Most of the metals analyzed indicated concentrations below SPRCSP criteria for the 
protection of groundwaters (Table 20-3). Only one sample displayed an aluminum concentration (1.1 mg/l) 
exceeding the associated criteria (0.75 mg/l). However, the average aluminum concentration (0.66 mg/l) of 
the three samples is below the criteria. Although arsenic content is typically high in the ore, the low 
concentrations measured during testing (0.043 mg/l, 0.11 mg/l and 0.13 mg/l) suggested that this element 
should not leach into groundwaters and surface waters.

arsenic, median and average values are below the A criteria. Average and median arsenic contents were 
95 mg/kg and 15 mg/l, respectively, which exceed A criteria (5 mg/kg). 

Acid Generating Potential: The average sulfides content in the samples was low (0.40%) ( 

 

 

 

 

Table 20-5). The average neutralizing potential (NP) estimated (57.1 mgCaCO3/t) was significantly higher 
than the average acidification potential (AP) estimated (12.6 mgCaCO3/t). The average NP/AP ratio was 
about 4.55, which is above the ratio recommended in Directive 019 (3.0). Only one of eight samples 
exhibited an acid generating potential as per Directive 019 criteria. These results validated the MDDELCC 
decision to authorize the actual operation of a waste rocks quarry on the site for construction materials 
purpose. 

Leaching Potential: Several metals indicated concentrations above SPRCSP criteria for the protection of 
groundwaters, i.e.: aluminum (7 of 8 samples), silver (1 of 8) and iron (1 of 8) (Table 20-6).  For most of 
the parameters, with the exception of aluminum, median and average values were below the 
corresponding criteria.  

Average and median aluminum content were 1.7 mg/l and 1.2 mg/l, respectively (criteria is 0.75 mg/l). 
However, it is assumed that aluminum leaching would not be expected in the course of kinetic testing and 
real storage conditions, since is recognized that static tests overestimate leaching potential. 

Furthermore, it is worthed reminding that during a TCLP testing performed on 2 waste rock samples for a 
previous request of authorization for waste rock beneficiation, leachate concentrations in arsenic were 
0.030 and 0.049 mg/L.

20.2.2.3 Ore and waste rock management 

According to the classification of mining waste of the Directive 019, waste rock is «low risk» and ore is 
«acid generating». 

Therefore, no special measures for the protection of groundwaters and surface waters (except control of 
suspended solids) are required for percolation waters from the waste dumps.

A geomembrane liner will be installed at the temporary ore stockpile area in order to collect percolation 
waters and treat them if necessary to respect Directive 019 requirements for effluent before discharge in 
the environment.   

20.3 ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE STUDIES 

The Project area considered as part of this study extends 8 km by 8 km and is centered on the projected 
mine site. 

Description of the bio-physical and socio-economic components of the study area environment was 
described based on information collected from various sources:  

1. Field surveys;  
2. Aerial photographs and/or satellite images, maps, and geomatics tools;  
3. Information gathered from various governmental agencies;  
4. Studies from the scientific and technical literature. 

20.3.1 SOCIO-ECONOMIC COMPONENTS 
The project is located in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue Administrative Region (08), more specifically in the 
Granada District of the town of Rouyn-Noranda. The city, which is an important center for the Quebec 
mining industry, has a population of just over 41,000 people. 

In recent years, the economic situation in the region has fluctuated, alternating between slowdowns and 
recoveries. Since 2010, the region has returned to growth with employment and unemployment rates 
improving significantly compared to the Province. Historically, and still today, Rouyn-Noranda's economic 
activity is based on the industrial sector, dominated by the mining industry as well as medium and small 
businesses servicing the mines. 

According to the zoning plan of Rouyn-Noranda, the project is located partly in an "exploitation of 
resources" (ER-2) area and partly in an "industrial" area (I-2). The "mining" use is compatible with the 
current zoning, insofar as the city is informed in advance of any mining development project. 

There are about twenty houses in a radius of one kilometer from the Granada property.  Residents use 
wells to meet their water needs. On Rang Lavigne, there are about 30 houses within a radius of 2 km 
around the pits; these residents also use private wells for their drinking water supply. In addition to the 
residential areas, there are a few public infrastructures such as a church, a cemetery and a primary school 
northwest of the proposed site. According to Rouyn-Noranda's Master Plan, the Granada district has a 
good potential for residential, recreational (e.g. bike path) and industrial developments.  

The La Bruère River and its surroundings are used both by hunters and anglers. The Centre de plein air 
de Granada, offering hiking, snowshoeing, cross-country and nordic skiing is located more or less 1 km 
south of the mine site at the junction of the Granada avenue and Rang Lavigne. Furthermore, during 
winter, several snowmobile and ATV trails are used in the vicinity of the project site. During the summer 
months, ATV uses the same route as in winter, but only east of Granada Avenue. 

No known sector or archaeological site is located near the proposed mine site. 

20.3.2 PHYSICAL COMPONENTS 
20.3.2.1 Hydrology and Hydrogeology 

Locally, surface waters flow towards Beauchastel and Bruyère Lakes. A small portion of the flow drains to 
the North towards Pelletier Lake. A few streams of various sizes are flowing in the area, notably the 
Beauchastel and Pelletier Rivers. The nearest stream to the project site is the Bruère River, which flows 
towards Bruyère Lake. The project site is located in the headwaters of the Bruère River. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 215
 

Typically, the geological units encountered in the study area display limited hydraulic properties. Indeed, 
these rocks have a low «primary» porosity related to the characteristics of their rock matrix, which inhibits 
their capacity to store large volumes of water and to facilitate groundwater flow. The hydraulic properties 
of these types of rock are associated with a «secondary» type porosity, generated by fractures and faults 
in the rock mass. The density and connectivity of the fracture network will control groundwater flow, and 
allow locally the storage of significant volumes of water. The occurrence of the Cadillac Fault located in 
the vicinity of the project area may influence locally the fracture network. 

20.3.2.2 Groundwater Quality 

There were no monitoring wells specifically installed for the project. However, groundwater samples were 
first collected in four (4) mineral exploration boreholes in June 2013 in order to obtain a preliminary 
assessment of the groundwater quality. 

All groundwater samples showed concentrations below the effluent criteria of the MDDELCC Directive 
019, and the aquatic life protecting acute toxicity criteria, with the exception of one sample that displayed a 
copper content (0.0145 mg/l) slightly above the acute toxicity criteria for the protection of aquatic life 
(0.0146 mg/l). Concentrations exceeding drinking-water criteria were detected in all samples for 
manganese; and in one sample for iron and arsenic. However, iron and manganese are only aesthetical 
parameters.  

Two (2) other boreholes were sampled in September 2013 and May 2014. All samples displayed 
concentrations in dissolved manganese above MDDELCC drinking water criteria. One sample also 
exhibited arsenic content above the drinking water criteria; and one sample a silver content (0.0019 mg/l) 
exceeding the acute toxicity criteria (0.00062 mg/l).  

Lastly, groundwater from most of the private wells in the project area was sampled in March 2014, and 
results were sent to owners. Results indicated numerous arsenic concentrations, and a few lead 
concentrations exceeding the drinking water criteria. Arsenic concentration pattern agrees with the known 
contaminated area. High lead concentrations measured in some samples are assumed to be associated 
with house plumbing. 

20.3.2.3 Surface Water Quality 

Six (6) surface water sampling sites were established along the most important streams in the project 
area. Samples were collected in accordance with applicable provincial and federal guidelines. Water 
quality was examined according to Canadian recommendations for water quality/aquatic life protection 
and surface water quality criteria from the MDDELCC. 

Surface waters are relatively turbid, mildly acidic and have high buffering capacities. Hardness is highly 
variable: from very soft waters to hard waters.  Surface waters are characteristics of shallow aquatic 
environments rich in organic matter.  

Concentrations of metals measured in the surface water samples were variable. Aluminium, arsenic, 
copper, cadmium, chromium, iron, manganese and zinc were detected in several samples at levels 
exceeding MDDELCC criteria and CCME recommendation on surface water quality for the protection of 
aquatic life.  

Petroleum hydrocarbon contamination was detected in two samples. The hydrocarbon content of 0.2 and 
0.1 mg/l exceeded the chronic toxicity criteria for the protection of aquatic life (0.010 mg/l).  

20.3.2.4 Sediment Quality 

Sediment samples were collected at the same six (6) sampling sites used for water quality assessment. 
Results have been compared to freshwater sediment quality criteria from Environment Canada and 
MDDELCC.  

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 216
 

Typically, the sediment samples collected consisted mainly of silt (57.2 to 72.1 %), clay (16.5 to 30.4 %) 
and sand (6.7 to 12.4 %).  The most abundant metals in the sediments were iron and magnesium. Metal 
concentrations were above freshwater sediment quality criteria in one or more sampling sites for: 
chromium (6 samples); arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead and zinc (4 samples); nickel and mercury (1 
sample). One sample contained 238 mg/kg of petroleum hydrocarbon.  

20.3.2.5 Existing Open-Pit Water Quality 

Water from the existing open pits was sampled in March 2013. Three (3) samples were collected in each 
pit. Overall, results were similar for each distinct pit. All results indicated concentrations below the 
Directive 019 effluent criteria. 

Typically, water pH was slightly alkaline (± 7.8), and hardness was high (127 mg CaCO3/l to 263 mg 
CaCO3/l). Average arsenic content was 0.044 mg/l, which is significantly smaller than the aquatic life 
protection criteria (acute toxicity) (0.34 mg/l), but higher than the drinking water criteria.  Finally, biotesting 
performed in May 2014 on pit water samples indicated no toxicity for the rainbow trout and Daphnia 
magna. 

According to the results, only total suspended solids (TSS) must be controlled prior to discharge in surface 
waters during the dewatering phase.  

20.3.3 BIOLOGICAL COMPONENTS 
20.3.3.1 Terrestrial Habitats and Wetlands 

The Project is located within the balsam fir / white birch stand domain. This bioclimatic domain is located 
just south of the spruce-moss forest domain and is part of the continuous boreal forest sub-zone. Within 
the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, balsam fir / white birch stands covers about half of the area following 
information provided by the Québec Department of Forest, Wildlife and Parks in its Regional Portrait 
(MRNF, 2006)3. Such type of stands is of course dominated by balsam firs and white birches, but the 
presence of white spruces, black spruces, jack pines, trembling aspens and tamaracks can easily be 
observed. Commonly, balsam fir and white birch stands, in which occur white spruces, are associated with 
mesic environments while poorly drained sites are dominated by the spruce-moss forest, in which also 
grow tamaracks, or by wetlands. Well-drained sites host mostly jack pines and balsam fir stands.  

Based on local ecoforestry maps produced by the MFFP using aerial photos, the Project area is 
dominated by mixed forests (about 50%), mostly dominated by deciduous species such as trembling 
aspens (40%). The second most abundant type of stands is mixed regenerating forest (about 10%). 
Otherwise, white birch, black spruce and balsam fir stands are observed. Already disturbed areas cover 
almost 8% of the Project area. 

Wetlands do cover about 6 % of the total Project area. Those are alder forests (shrub swamps), peatlands 
and floodplains (about 2% each). The ecological value of those wetlands was evaluated by Genivar (2012) 
as part of the Rouyn-Noranda Wetland Management Plan. That analysis was completed in line with the 
guidelines established by MDDELCC which considers both biotic and abiotic aspects. Most wetlands 
identified as part of that study within the Project area are of medium ecological value.

Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 217
 

Relatively speaking, the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region is known for its diversified wildlife with four (4) large 
mammal, thirty-two (32) small mammal and twenty (20) fur-bearing mammal species present or potentially 
present at the regional scale. The most abundant among those are the white-tailed deer, moose, black 
bear, snowshoe hare, American porcupine, American beaver, American red squirrel, Canada lynx, river 
otter, American marten, fisher, muskrat, and American mink.  

Within the vicinity of the Project area, hunting and trapping data for the 2000-2012 period provided by the 
MFFP have confirmed the presence of black bears and white-tailed deer. According to the OBVT (2011) 4, 
the white-tailed deer is at its northern limit of distribution in the Rouyn-Noranda area. A muskrat habitat, 
considered as a legally designated wildlife habitat following the Act respecting the conservation and 
development of wildlife, is located at the limit of the Project area, near Bruyère Lake.   

Amphibians and Reptiles 

Considering the relatively harsh climate typical of the region, amphibians and reptiles are poorly diversified 
in the area. According to the OBVT (2011), blue-spotted salamander, green frog and leopard frog are 
present in the area.  

Avifauna 

More than 280 bird species are known to be present in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region, among which 
20 are considered as rare (OBVT, 2011). Several of those species are aquatic (ex. waterfowl species such 
as the common loon). The Témiscamingue watershed, within which Rouyn-Noranda is located, is included 
in the tundra swan and sandhill crane migratory corridors (OBVT, 2011). Other bird species include forest 
birds (ex. warblers, sparrows, grouses) and prey birds (ex. bald eagle).  

Three waterfowl gathering areas, considered as a legally designated wildlife habitat following the Act 
respecting the conservation and development of wildlife, are located at the borders of the Project area: 
one at Pelletier Lake; another at Hollen Creek; and a final one at Bruyère Lake. A wetland managed by 
Ducks Unlimited Canada is also located at the northern border of the Project area, the Stadacona pond.  

Fisheries and Fish Habitats 

Since the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region hosts a large amount of lakes, rivers and creeks, the freshwater 
aquatic wildlife is relatively diversified. A total of 49 species are known to be present in the region's lakes 
and rivers (OBVT, 2011), among which the most abundant are: walleye, sauger, lake trout, brook trout, 
catfish, and northern pike (MRNF, 2006).  

The most important rivers and lakes present in the Project area are the Pelletier and Bruyère lakes and 
the La Bruère and Beauchastel rivers. Other rivers (mostly creeks) and lakes are also present, but are of 
smaller size (ex. Gamble, Françoise and Ted lakes; Demers and Cousineau creeks).  

Fisheries assessments were completed by the MFFP within the Beauchastel and La Bruère rivers as well 
as in Gamble Lake. No trout species were captured as part of those works. Species fished as part of those 
assessments are: white sucker, channel darter, logperch, trout-perch, catfish, and mottled sculpin. Except 
for the channel darter, those species are all typical at the regional level.  

20.3.3.3 Special-Status Species 

Based on data provided by the Centre de données sur le patrimoine naturel du Québec (CDPNQ), no 
special-status plant species are known to occur in the Project area. With regards to special-status wildlife

species, the CDPNQ databank identified two provincially-designated bat species (red and hoary bats) in 
the Pelletier Lake vicinity, about 3.5 km north-west of the projected mine site.  

Based on information provided by the MFFP in its Regional Portrait (MRNF, 2006), a woodland caribou 
herd, a special-status species designated at both provincial and federal levels, is present in the vicinity of 
Val-d'Or, near the Decelles Reservoir (OBVT, 2011), about 100 km east of the Project area. It is important 
to note that the MFFP and the CDPNQ have not confirmed the presence of woodland caribou in the 
Project area when specifically asked about it. In fact, the Abitibi region is considered by the MFFP to be at 
the southern limit of distribution of this species in the province of Québec.  

The bald eagle, a bird species designated as vulnerable at the provincial level, is also known to occur in 
the Pelletier Lake area, about 3.5 km north-west of the projected mine site.  

Finally, the channel darter is designated as threatened at the federal level. In Canada, the channel darter's 
occurrence is uncommon, but fragmented populations exist in several areas of Ontario and Quebec. In 
Quebec, the species is found in the St. Lawrence River and also in tributaries of four hydrographic 
regions, among which the Ottawa River hydrographic region which includes the Rouyn-Noranda region.  

20.3.3.4 Protected Areas 

As previously mentioned, legally-designated wildlife habitats are located at the borders of the Project area, 
i.e. three waterfowl gathering areas and one muskrat habitat. Those two areas are protected under the 
Regulation respecting wildlife habitats.  No other protected areas (ex. national parks, ecological reserve, 
exceptional forest ecosystem, etc.) are located in the Project area or its immediate vicinity.  

20.4 MINING SITE REHABILITATION CONCEPTS 

The rehabilitation and restoration plan concept is summarized as follows: 

• Waste rock piles will be covered with a layer of top soil/overburden and revegetated when 
feasible. 

• Haul roads surface will be scarified and revegetated. 
• No building will be left in place. Whenever possible, buildings will be sold with the equipment they 

contain, completely or partially. During dismantling works, beneficiation/recycling of construction 
material will be maximized. Remaining waste will be disposed of in an appropriate site.  

• All equipment and machinery will be disposed of or recycled off-site.  
• The drinking water supply and domestic wastewater treatment facilities will be dismantled. 
• Infrastructure relating to electricity supply and distribution will be dismantled with the exception of 

Hydro-Québec requirements. 
• Once the mining activities cease, the pit will gradually fill up to its equilibrium level with rainfall and 

groundwater.  
• Fences will be installed around the open-pits for security purpose 
• Whenever possible, the surface water drainage pattern will be re-established to a condition similar 

to the original hydrological system. 
• Waste material from demolition activities will be decontaminated when required, recycled when 

cost-effective or buried in an appropriate site.  
• Facilities containing petroleum products, chemicals, solid waste, hazardous waste, and/or 

contaminated soil or materials will be dismantled and managed according to regulatory 
requirements.  

• All hazardous waste will be managed according to existing laws and regulations and will be 
transported off site. 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 219
 

• As per to Directive 019 for the mining industry, a Monitoring Program will have to be implemented 
during the mine operation to account for all the requirements specified in that Directive, especially 
with regards to noise levels, vibrations, surface and ground waters.  

• The physical stability of the waste rock piles will need to be assessed, and signs of erosion will be 
noted. This monitoring will be conducted on an annual basis for a minimum of five years following 
mine closure. 

• Monitoring of the water quality (surface and groundwater) will continue for a minimum of five years 
after the completion of the restoration work.  

• The agronomic monitoring program is designed to assess the effectiveness of the re-vegetation 
which will be done as part of mining rehabilitation efforts. To document the success of the re-
vegetation efforts over the waste dumps areas, an agronomic monitoring will be undertaken 
following the establishment of a vegetative cover on the areas subject to the progressive 
restoration program. This monitoring will be conducted annually for three years following the 
revegetation efforts. Reseeding will be carried out, as required, in areas where re-vegetation is 
found unsatisfactory. 

20.5 RELATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS 

GBB has carried out consultations with: 

• Authorities of City of Rouyn-Noranda, including the mayor; 
• Representatives of the Rouyn-Noranda Snowmobile Association; 
• Representatives of the Rouyn-Noranda School Board; 
• Representatives of the Rouyn-Noranda Recreation Service. 

Public presentations of the project have been held on February 26, 2014 and May 21, 2014. Participation 
of residents living in the area of the project has been important.  

Finally, an information letter has been sent to the Timiskaming First Nation Council in Notre-Dame-du-
Nord, 80 km south-west of Rouyn-Noranda.

21 Capital and Operating Costs 

21.1 CAPITAL COSTS 

The total capital expenditures cost (CAPEX) is estimated at an overall accuracy of ±25%, which is the 
standard for a pre-feasibility study. The CAPEX was defined by SGS using in-house database, seller bids 
and the Mine & Mill Equipment Costs Estimator's Guide: Capital & Operating Costs (2012) annexed to 
2014. The total required investment is estimated at 6.70 M$. Please refer to the Table 21-1 for the CAPEX 
breakdown.  

Table 21-1: CAPEX Summary 

 

This capital requirement does not include: 

• Costs to obtain permits; 
• Any provision for changes in exchange rates; 
• GST/QST; 
• Project financing and interest charges; 
• Price/cost escalation during construction; 
• Import duties and custom fees; 
• Sunk cost; 
• Exploration activities; 
• Severance cost for employees at the cessation of operations; 
• Any additional costs (but can partly be absorbed in contingency allowance). 

21.1.1 WORKING CAPITAL 
Considering that the processing plant that will treat the Granada ore will do so by batch, (ie. at each 3 
months approximately), SGS considered a cost related to the working capital of 3.5 M$ that will cover all 
mining activities for the first 3 months period. 

21.1.2 PRE-PRODUCTION SALARIES 
SGS considered that the operator will need a part of his staff prior the start of the mining operation and 
obviously prior its first gold payment. For this reason, SGS considered a provision of 0.60 M$ that will 
cover the salaries of the key personal for a 6 month period in order to bring the project into production.  

21.1.3 OVERBURDEN STRIPPING 
SGS assumed that all the overburden covering the first isolated pit to be mined will be removed prior the 
operation. For this reason and as it often the case in a mining project, the overburden stripping is 
considered as capital expenditure. The cost of such a work is calculated at 0.60 M$. 

21.1.4 INITIAL CAPITAL 
As presented in Table 21-2, the initial capital required is estimated at 2.00 M$ and includes a contingency 
of 25.0%. This cost, detailed in the following Table 21-2, was developed from quotations received from 

Item Cost
Working capital (3 months guarantee) 3,500,000$          
Pre-production salaries 600,000$              
Overburden stripping 601,595$

CAPEX, theses cost are occurring after the start of the operation. SGS estimates this sustaining capital 
costs to 2.90 M$ divided in 3 main items; financial guarantee for site rehabilitation, overburden stripping, 
and others. The Table 21-3 shows the estimated cost per year of operation.  

Table 21-3: Estimates cost per year of operation 

 

 

21.2.1 REHABILITATION AND MINE CLOSURE CAPITAL COSTS  
The cost for site rehabilitation and mine closure was developed by SGS and Roche. These costs shown in 
the Table 21-4 are mainly related to the permanent closure of the stockpiles and dismantling of site 
infrastructure. This cost has been calculated to 1.24 M$.  

Table 21-4: Cost for site rehabilitation and mine closure 

 

It was assumed that the buildings will be sold at the end of the mine life and that the revenues will cover 
the cost of dismantling. Also, it is planned to make the progressive re-vegetation/rehabilitation and it is for 
this reason that the reclamation cost only is related to a 500m by 500m area. 

For the purpose of this Study and to be in line with the actual regulation, it was assumed that this 1.24 M$ 
would be spread over the 3 first years of operation as 50%, 25% and 25% respectively. 

 

21.2.2 OVERBURDEN STRIPPING AND OTHERS 
As the first year of overburden stripping was incorporated as a capital cost, SGS assumed that the 
remaining overburden will be treated the same, so it was considered as a sustaining capital cost. 

An additional provision of 50,000 $ per year was allowed for in the case of any unplanned expense.

Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 223
 

21.3 OPERATIONAL COSTS 

The total capital expenditures cost (CAPEX) is estimated at an overall accuracy of ±25%, which is the 
standard for a pre-feasibility study. The CAPEX was defined by SGS using in-house database, seller bids 
and the Mine & Mill Equipment Costs Estimator's Guide: Capital & Operating Costs (2012) annexed to 
2014. 

The operating costs do not include:  

• Any provision for inflation;  
• Any provision for changes in exchange rates;  
• GST/QST;  
• Corporate administration and head offices costs; and  
• Exploration activities.  

21.3.1 MINING COST – HARD ROCK (WASTE AND ORE) 
Mine operating costs were calculated using a list of equipment and manpower prepared by SGS. Mining 
operating costs include the leasing costs for the main mining equipments, the equipment operating cost, 
the salaries, the cost for blasting and other services. The equipment cost and blasting cost are based on 
Supplier's budgeted price and a fuel price of C$1.30 per litre of fuel. Average salaries are based upon a 
discussion between SGS and Gold Bullion Development Corporation and include an average of 30% 
fringe benefits. Equipment unit operating and maintenance costs were developed from quotations 
received from Supplier cost estimation guides and from experience and personal contacts within the 
mining industry; other sources of information are from an internal database on similar projects. The global 
hard rock mining costs are summarized in the Table 21-5. 

 

Table 21-5: Mining Cost Subdivision 

 

The construction of these is available at request. 

 

21.3.2 MINING COST – OVERBURDEN 
SGS assumed that the cost of mining the overburden material would be the same as waste mining but 
without the cost for drilling and blasting. Based in this assumption, SGS calculated the overburden mining 
cost at 2.51 $ per tonne mined. 

21.3.3 ORE LOADING 
This task is planned to be performed by the transport contractor. Ore material will be mined from the pits 
and stored on-site prior transport to the processing plant. Based on contractors bids, SGS assumed an

Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 224
 

ore loading cost of 1.25 $ per tonne of ore. This cost includes the loading equipment operational cost as 
the operator salaries. 

21.3.4 ORE TRANSPORT 
This task is planned to be performed by the transport contractor. Ore material will be transported from the 
mine site to the processing plant, located approximately at 43 km, by highway trucks. Based on 
contractors bids, SGS assumed an ore transport cost of 4.75 $ per tonne of ore. This cost is considered 
as all-inclusive. 

21.3.5 ORE CRUSHING 
From discussions with transport contractor, the highway trucks that will be transporting the ore material 
could transport blasted material of a certain size, (ie. There is no need to crush prior loading). However, it 
is planned that some rocks will be oversize. These rocks will be stockpiled separately and an excavator 
will break them using a hammer. A provision of 0.25 $ per tonne of ore was assumed for this item. 

21.3.6 ORE PROCESSING 
As it was presented in Section 17, the cost of processing per tonne of ore including G & A is 51$/tonne. 
For the purpose of this PFS, this cost is considered as all-inclusive. 

According to requests from the Gold Bullion and Iamgold, the processing cost should not be clearly stated 
in this report. However, SGS considered this cost in the economic analysis of the project. 

21.3.7 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION (G&A) 
The total G&A cost was calculated on a cost per tonne of ore through the life of the mine(included with the 
disclosed processing cost). This cost includes the salaries of the staff personal as well as other general 
expenses required to maintain the operating up and running. The following Tables (Table 21-6 and Table 
21-7) present the construction of this cost.

• constant exchange rate of $0.90 (CDN$:US$);  
• discount rate of 5.00 %;  
• sunk costs and owner's costs are not included in the model;  
• 3 years of mining operation;  
• initial capital cost will be spend before the first year of production (year -1 in the model);

Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 228
 

22.4 TAXES, ROYALTIES AND INTERESTS 

22.4.1 TAXES  
The Granada Project will be subject to current and planned Federal and Quebec tax rates and related tax 
rules. At the date of this report, the applicable tax rates are:  

 

 

Federal income tax rate: 15.0 %  

Provincial income tax rate: 11.9 %  

Quebec mining tax: 16.0 % (Quebec levies mining taxes under the Mining Tax Act at a 
flat rate of 16.0 % since 2012 for all material extracted from 
Quebec soil)  

A mining corporation in Quebec will be subject to mining taxes on the annual profit earned on its property 
that is reasonably attributable to the mine and that can be reasonably be attributable to the operations of 
the mine. For the purpose of the Mining Tax Act, annual profit is determined by subtracting from gross 
revenue the operating expenses and allowances directly related to the mine, including:  

• exploration and development expenses;  
• depreciation;  
• a processing allowance;  
• an additional allowance for a mine located in the North or mid North (not applicable).  

Important note: 

On May 6th 2013, the Quebec Government has tabled legislation that modifies the royalty/tax regime 
associated to the mining industry. According to documents submitted by the Government, the new mining 
royalty regime will ensure that all operators (mining companies producing cash flow) have to pay a 
minimum tax based on revenue. The new regime proposes the imposition of an additional minimum 
royalty based on the value of the ore extracted by a mining company from the Quebec soil (run-of-mine 
ore). If the production value is less than 80 M$, the royalty will amount to 1% and if the production value is 
greater than 80 M$, the royalty will be 4% of the value of the ore mined. In addition, the Quebec 
Government proposes to implement a progressive mining tax rate (instead of actual flat rate of 16 %) for 
companies that generate profits and that will not be subject to the minimum royalty. The mining tax will be 
16% if the profit margin of the company is between 0% and 35%. If profit is between 35% and 50% the tax 
will be 17.8% and if the profit is between 50% and 100%, the tax will be 22.9%. This represents tabled 
legislation by the Government which will need to be voted into law before it can be implemented. If 
accepted, the new tax regime is expected to be implemented in 2014. 

The tax model that was presented in previous section was prepared by an accountant from Deloitte in 
Rouyn-Noranda. In order to come up with an estimation of the possible taxes, the following assumptions 
were made: 

• The Granada   project  is a new mine for tax purposes , there were no production in commercial 
quantities in the past on the  property; 

• The expense incurred in the years considered will not be renounced in favor of FTS investors; 
• The year one occurs in 2014; 
• The income for tax purposes is based on the information that appear on  the mine plan cash flow 

worksheet; 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 229
 

• The commercial production begins on year 1; 
• All the depreciable assets incurred before year 1 relates to a new mine and are situated on the 

site of the mine; 
• Only for the taxation purpose, the overburden incurred in year 1 has been considered as 

expenses engaged for the purpose of developing the mine and as a operating expense for the 
other years; 

• The drilling campaign and miscellaneous has been considered as operating expense; 
• The financial guarantee has  been considered  has an expense in year 3; 
• All the development expenses (year 0) except depreciable assets are incurred for the purpose of 

bringing a new mine in production in reasonable commercial quantities but before the beginning of 
such production; 

• All the expenses are not deductible expenses for mining duty tax purposes because they are 
considered as per 8.0.1 of the law as "an expense, except to the extent that it was incurred by the 
operator in respect of a mining operation to realize the gross value of the annual output from the 
mining operation and provided that the expense relates directly thereto" or "an expense incurred 
for constitution, organization or reorganization or other non deductible expense mentioned in 
section 8.0.1. of the law". 

• 50 % if the G&A expenses were considered as non deductible expenses for mining tax purposes; 
• The income tax rate is 26.9% (2012 federal and Québec tax rate); 
• The entity does not operate any mine nor any related party to it; 
• The  depreciable assets are considered not  in use during preproduction period; 
• The beginning of year tax pools (CEE - CDE) and tax credit are related to the Granada property 

so that we used the past year expenditures to reduce the income tax burden; 
• There is no administration expenses related to exploration; 
• The entity is an eligible operator till year 1. 

22.4.2 ROYALTIES  
A 3.00 % NSR is applicable to the Granada project and has been considered in the present economic 
analysis. 

22.4.3 DEBT AND INTERESTS  
SGS has for opinion that a PFS should measure the inherent value of a mineral project, not the ability of 
an owner to finance a project on favourable terms. For this reason, the economical analysis presented in 
this study is supposing 100% equity cashflows, so no interest attributable to capital financing was 
considered. 

22.5 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 

The sensitivity of the Net Present Value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) were evaluated for 
changes in key variables and parameters such as:  

• Capital investment (CAPEX);  
• Gold price; 
• Operating cost;  
• Head grade; 
• Processing recovery.  

For simplification purpose, this sensitivity was prepared using only the pre-tax values. The result of the 
sensitivity is presented by the next Figure: 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 230
 

 
Figure 22-1: Sensitivity analysis 

It can be seen that the gold price, the head grade and the processing recovery have the greatest impact 
on project NPV and IRR. The project becomes uneconomic when the gold price, the head grade or the 
processing recovery drops by about 27.5 %. Overall, the project is sensitive to each of the major variables. 
This sensitivity analysis clearly demonstrates that the gold price needs to remain over 1,000 $CDN/oz 
troy; in order to keep the project economically viable.

23 Adjacent Properties 

In Abitibi, most properties on the Cadillac trend are surrounded by others. The Gold Bullion Property is not 
an exception. The following map presents the property in red surrounded by others, most of them being 
public companies. Since the majority of these companies are active and have a public web site the author 
recommends the reader to visit their websites for the most recent information and developments.  

• The adjacent property close to the known mineralized zone of Granada belongs to Adventure 
Gold. No declared work from their side on this property named Granada Extension. 

• To the north the Astoria property of Yorbeau has declared resource statement in 2005 in the 
700,000 to 1 Million gold ounces range. The resource is in a different geological context 
associated with the Cadillac fault. The technical report can be downloaded from their web site. 
The author is aware Yorbeau is conducting some diamond drilling on their property in 2014. 

• To the north east Threegold Resources Inc. has discovered a mineralized trend along the Adanac 
Shaft, a figure from their web site is presented on the next page. 

• RT Minerals is North East between Threegold and Gold Bullion close to McWatters, no recent 
work disclosed on the web site.

24 Other Relevant Data and Information 

The author is aware that the owner of the mill at Granada has dismantled the mill. 

Regarding the onsite waste pile, legacy of previous open-pit operations, Gold Bullion can use the rock for 
access road construction and it is also being used by local contractors for fill. An application for a 
Certificate of Authorization (C of A) is underway for the use of this material. Galarneau has just received 
its C of A to crush and screen aggregate.  He has a contract 70,000 tonnes and to the author's knowledge 
has a C of A for this independent operation but the Company needs another C of A for the remaining fines 
which is being prepared by Goldminds Geoservices with SODAVEX. 

Photonic Knowledge has conducted core mapping and information is not for public disclosure. The author 
has not relied on the core scan information from Photonic Knowledge to prepare the resource estimate. 

Note: At the moment of completing this report, final discussions on the custom milling agreement were 
underway. In the author's opinion (Claude Duplessis, Eng.) who have participate in providing the technical 
information between the parties and continuous discussions between responsible of IMG & GBB, there is 
actually no reason to believe that the custom milling agreement between IMG & GBB should not take 
place and believe it should be signed within the next 2 to 3 weeks to the latest. 

 

24.1 PROJECT SCHEDULE 

SGS judged relevant to prepare a schedule that will show the next tasks or items to be completed in order 
to bring the Granada deposit into production. This schedule was prepared using Microsoft Project and is 
presented below:

25 Interpretations and Conclusions 

25.1 CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE ESTIMATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES 

In the context of re-engineering to increase robustness of the Granada project, Mineral resources have 
been remodeled with mineral zones having a minimum horizontal width of 7m down to elevation 237.5m. 
This resource model has been used for pit optimization and design for the "Rolling Start" project. This 
model starts from the surface and pit bottom to elevation 237.5 metres. Lower grade is now excluded from 
the mineral resource statement. No gold loss has occurred from the PEA resource model to the actual 
presentation. It is all a matter of the mineral cut-off grade used with the associated economic scenario. 

In order to address mining underground, mineralized zones have been remodeled with 3 to 4 meters 
horizontal width below elevation 237.5 metres. Highlights include a Measured and Indicated combined 
underground gold resource of 325,450 ounces of gold at an average grade of 5.10 g/t gold plus 25,700 
ounces Inferred at a grade of 7.14 g/t gold. The combined underground measured resource is 107,600 
ounces (763,500 tonnes grading 4.38 g/t), indicated resource is 217,600 ounces (1,221,000 tonnes 
grading 5.54 g/t), inferred resource is 25,700 ounces gold (112,000 tonnes grading 7.14 g/t Au) using a 
cut-off grade of 0.40 g/t.  

Previous small open pits have been taken into account and are starting surfaces of optimization. The 
historical production of 51,476 ounces (181,744 sT @ 0.28 oz/sT) from 1930 to 1935 is included in the 
resource statement and the author cannot physically remove it from the measured, indicated or inferred 
categories. As the historical opening cannot be placed in 3D. Moreover the historical mining apparently 
extent to the west where no mineral resources have been estimated due to impossibility to drill from old 
tailing surface. The author also wants to remind that grade estimations comes from Gold Bullion recent 
drilling, hence gold grades do not comes from historical data in the mined out sector. 

• Accuracy of the disclosure on what has been mined out underground. The amount of material 
mined out is limited, however it could be a bit more than disclosed but not to a huge extent since it 
would be reflected with a much larger tailing footprint. 

• Combination of additional factors which could materially affect the resources are: 
o The presence of old orphan tailings 
o The presence of arsenic in the rock at Granada 

 

25.2 MINERAL RESERVES ESTIMATES 

The mineral reserve (with dilution and ore loss) is equal to 569,000 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 
4.24 g/t Au using cut-off grades of 1.69 g/t and represents an operation of 3.0 years. The entire reserve 
comprises 77,500 ounces of gold (before processing recovery). Total waste, including rock, inferred 
resources and overburden, is 9.3 Mt; resulting in a waste to ore ratio of 16:3. The detailed mineral reserve 
estimate is shown in Table 25-1: 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 235
 

Table 25-1: Granada Project Reserves (presented as mill feed) 

 

This reserve is dated to the effective date of this report. Reserves are based on a cut-off grade and there 
is always a possibility that the cut-off grade varies over time. The majors factors that could affect the cut-
off grade, and thus directly the ore reserves, are a change in the gold price, a change in the processing 
recovery, a change in the operating costs (such as processing, G&A, transport, etc.), a different mining 
dilution that the one used in this report, etc.  

25.3 MINING METHODS 

The mining of Granada deposit will follow the standard practice of an open-pit operation with the 
conventional drill and blast, load and haul cycle, using a drill / truck / excavator mining fleet, and supported 
by a fleet of auxiliary equipment. The run-of-mine (RoM) will be drilled, blasted and loaded by hydraulic 
excavators and delivered by trucks to an ore stockpiling area. The ore will then be loaded onto transport 
trucks and delivered to the Iamgold processing plant, approximately 43 km from the mine site. Waste rock 
material will be hauled to the waste disposal areas near the pits or backfilled into the mined pits. It has 
been assumed that the mining of the Granada deposit will be carried out by a mining fleet that will be 
leased and maintained by the Owner. The main mining fleet will consists of hydraulic excavators of 5 
tonnes bucket capacity, and 35 tonnes off-road trucks. 

A mine production schedule was prepared for the development and the operation of the Project. The 
mining production schedule for the open pit is based on a pre-stripping period of approximately 3 months. 
Key findings include:  

• Project life of 3 years, with an ore mining rate of approximately 550 tonnes per day;  
• Mill feed over the Project life of 569,000 tonnes at 4.24 g/t Au;  
• Gold production of 73,600 ounces.  

The proposed schedule for the open-pit operations is based on two 8-hour shifts per day, 7 days a week 
and 350 days per year. The selection of two 8-hour shifts is based mainly on the fact that this schedule will 
avoid any possible disturbing of the neighborhood during the night. 

During this study, SGS came to the conclusion that the riskier item associated to mining is the control of 
the mining dilution during the operations. The ore zones are relatively thin following a 45-55 degrees dip 
and are favorable to an important dilution. In this study, SGS estimated the dilution to 25% at a gold grade 
of 0.00 g/t. Based on our experience and on similar operations, these estimates are judged acceptable but 
a considerable effort will be required during the operations to achieve these values. The effect of an 
increase in mining dilution is to lower the average mill feed grade and directly affect the project 
profitability. As is can be seen in the sensitivity analysis, the overall project profitability is extremely 
sensitive to the mill feed grade. SGS recommends to pursue the analysis of calculating the mining dilution 
during a feasibility study by considering various approaches such as lower the height of the benches in 
ore material, do in-fill drilling, increase the assaying of the ore zones, control and follow the ore blasts 
movements, etc.

Another aspect that requires attention is the old underground openings. It has been since 1930 that the 
Granada project is sporadically mined. Consequently, old underground excavations are present and need 
to be considered if mining is re-started. The first pit is in a Greenfield zone where no underground mining 
has proceed. It is scheduled to proceed with 3D scanning of openings and survey once water level allows 
access to the openings. Old underground drift location have been put in plan but exact position are not 
considered exact for the mining operation and the company should complete a detailed survey once 
access is possible using laser scanner, surface survey with GPR to model openings. Procedures will have 
to be put in place for the accurate survey of the openings before getting into their vicinity. As the mining 
width of the old time is relatively thin and no huge openings are present in documents, the procedure 
should be relatively simple and limited ore drop to the level should occur.  It is important to mention that as 
per existing information only a portion of the bottom of the pit to the west should cross small underground 
openings. 

25.4 RECOVERY METHOD 

The milling of the Granada ore is straightforward and SGS Geostat does not foresee any particular milling 
problems. The Iamgold-Doyon mill having a nominal capacity of 3,200 tpd is in operation and has been 
since early 1980 and enjoys an excellent reputation. Because of the mill feed rate and the Granada ore 
characteristics, some minor adjustments will have to be made to the mill. The most important being the 
volume of grinding balls in the SAG and ball mill, the number of cyclones and the number of leaching 
tanks (CIL) to be used. Since these adjustment have probably already been implemented for the milling of 
the Westwood ore, no other major changes to the mill are foreseen at this time. 

25.5 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The financial analysis results of the Granada Project for the base case scenario are calculated as:  

• 24.7 M$ net present value (19.5 M$ after tax) at 6.00 % discount rate;  
• 169 % internal rate of return (136 % after tax); 
• 6.0 months payback period (8.5 months after tax).  

The principal assumptions made in order to obtain these values are the following: 

• price of gold at $1,400.00 CDN per ounce troy;  
• 3.0% NSR is attributable to a third party;  
• processing rate of 192,500 tonnes per year (equivalent to approximately of 550 tonnes per day);  
• constant exchange rate of $0.90 (CDN$:US$);  
• discount rate of 5.00 %;  
• sunk costs and owner's costs are not included in the model;  
• 3 years of mining operation;  
• initial capital cost will be spend before the first year of production (year -1 in the model); 

In order to assess the sensitivity of the Net Present Value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) of the 
project, SGS varied the key variables that had the biggest chances to affect the project economic, i.e. the 
Capital investment (CAPEX), the Gold price, the operating cost, the head grade and the processing 
recovery. For simplification purpose, this sensitivity was prepared using only the pre-tax values. The result 
of the sensitivity is presented by the Figure 25-1: 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 237
 

 
Figure 25-1: Sensitivity analysis 

It can be seen that the gold price, the head grade and the processing recovery have the greatest impact 
on project NPV and IRR. The project becomes uneconomic when the gold price, the head grade or the 
processing recovery drops by about 27.5 %. Overall, the project is sensitive to each of the major variables. 
This sensitivity analysis clearly demonstrates that the gold price needs to remain over 1,000 $CDN/oz 
troy; in order to keep the project economically viable.

26 Recommendations 

26.1 RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE ESTIMATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES 

It is recommended to undertake negotiation and clean-up of the orphan tailings (dating from 1935) with the 
Ministry of Natural Resources Quebec in order to enable exploration drilling to the northwest of existing 
drilling to validate extension of the mineralized package at depth (old tailings location). It is also 
recommended to do additional drilling to improve resource estimates in the open pit area lateral extension. 
It is also recommended to complete the drilling to the west, to the north and to the east on a 40 to 50 m 
grid of surface holes drilling southward at 55 degrees dip. A few infill holes where gap exists and 3 cross-
sections of 3 holes on 100 m line to tests mineralization on the claims to the west. There are 3 target 
depths which merit additional drilling. One is near surface which we can define as 0-100, from 100 to 400 
meters and deeper which is 400 to 1000 meters vertical depth, The deep drilling of 2012, the DUP holes 
have confirmed extension of gold mineralisation at 1Km vertical depth showing the system is still open. 
The author also wants to mention that the property has not been explored extensively by diamond drilling 
and some budget should be put on testing extensions when the economic conditions allows for that type 
of work. 

 

The exploration work program & others – Step 1 – 2014/2015 is estimated as follow: 

 

Exploration Budget on the Granada Project (CAN$) 

Trenching (exploration)    $75,000 

Drilling (definition, exploration (0-400m))         $2,500,000 

Geotech Drilling (try to increase pit slope)          $75,000 

Laboratory met testings   $50,000 

Supervision and Technical reports             $150,000 

Deep drilling program Phase 2 targeting mineralization depth (400-1000m) $5,000,000

The Granada PFS is comprised of mining work that has been selected, designed and estimated in a way 
to meet industry standards. For this level of study, SGS has provided a mining plan for the future 
operation. SGS provide a list of recommendations, which would be beneficial if contemplated during 
detailed engineering phase. These mining engineered recommendations include:  

• Developing strategic mine schedule in short-term detail (quarterly, monthly); 
• Identifying opportunities for in-pit dumping; 
• Review the estimation of the mining dilution and ore loss with a detailed mining approach for ore 

material; 
• Complete a geotechnical study to optimize the open-pit slopes; 
• Perform trade-off study for mining equipment selection and size; 

 

 



Prefeasibility Study (PFS) Phase I – Open Pit Granada Gold Project, Rouyn-Noranda 239
 

• Consider the underground mining method as a serious alternative; 
• Perform trade-off study to outline the optimal transition between open-pit and underground mining. 

 
 

The authors recommend to Gold Bullion to proceed with the development of the project conditional to the 
recommended program of work which includes: definition and geotechnical drilling specific to the pit, in 
addition to the detailed engineering while permitting process takes place. 

 

26.3 RECOVERY METHOD 

Unless between batches the mill is stopped and thoroughly emptied of all ore, solid and liquid, there is no 
other choice but to accept some mixing of ores and other in-process material from different mines. 
Experience has shown that if clashes arise between a client and a mill owner it is most of the time related 
to the mill survey and sampling between these batches. SGS Geostat recommends that GBB has at all 
time a representative in the mill while milling the Granada ore. 

Because of the coarse free gold particles in the ore, all effort should be made to pass all of the secondary 
cyclones underflow through the 30" Knelson concentrator. Even if the IMG-Doyon leaching circuit is very 
efficient, SGS is of the opinion that the gold trapped early in the circuit cannot be lost later at the leaching. 

Just in case that for some reason IMG or GBB decides not to have the Granada ore custom milled or 
sometime in the future to discontinue the milling of the ore, the pre-feasibility report already started writing 
for the mill on site should be resumed. 

26.4 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

Regarding the environmental issues, the recommendations are: 

• Carry out kinetic testing (humidity cells or column) in order to determine the real metal 
leaching/acid rock drainage potential of the ore. The static testing performed is not conclusive 
(uncertainty regarding ARD potential according to Price (2009) classification used in the rest of 
Canada; 

• Prepare a request of Certificate of Approval for the beneficiation of the waste rocks according to 
the «Guide de valorisation des matières résiduelles inorganiques non dangereuses de source 
industrielle comme matériau de construction». 

• Continue the contacts with the stakeholders. 

 

The environmental studies, permitting and social or community impact program is estimated as follow: 

 

Environment Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact Budget the Granada Project 
(CAN$) 

Costs of kinetic testing (2)  $30,000 

Cost for application of Certificate of Authorization for valorisation and testing     $25,000 

Estimated total cost         $55,000
