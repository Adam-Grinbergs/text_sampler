1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

This technical report of the Fisher Canyon project was prepared by Mine Development Associates 

("MDA") at the request of Dreamweaver Capital Corporation ("Dreamweaver"), a Canadian capital pool 

corporation listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, in connection with its proposed "qualifying 

transaction".  The purpose of the report is to provide a technical review of the Fisher Canyon project for 

the qualifying transaction that describes the geologic setting of the project area as well as past 

exploration history and results.  The technical report is written in compliance with disclosure and 

reporting requirements set forth in the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 

("NI 43-101"), Companion Policy 43-101CP, and Form 43-101F1.  MDA has made such independent 

investigations as deemed necessary in its professional judgment to be able to reasonably rely on existing 

information to make the conclusions and recommendations presented in this report.   

 

It is proposed that NV Gold Corporation (USA) ("NV Gold"), a private Nevada corporation that holds 

leases and claims that make up the Fisher Canyon project, will complete a business combination with 
Dreamweaver.  Following the amalgamation, Dreamweaver will change its name to NV Gold 
Corporation, which will be listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX Venture Exchange).   

   
The Fisher Canyon property is located in central Pershing County, Nevada, approximately 32 kilometers 

(20 miles) east of Lovelock, the county seat of Pershing County.  The property is located on the 

southeast flank of the Humboldt Range within the Antelope Springs mining district.  The property is 

situated in all or portions of Sections 31 and 32, Township 28 North, Range 35 East, and Sections 4, 5, 

6, 7, 8, 17, and 18, Township 27 North, Range 35 East, Mount Diablo Base and Meridian.  Exploration 

activity to date has been centered at approximately 40
°
 12' North latitude, 118

°
 5' West longitude.  The 

location is favorable for exploration and mining year-around; other large mining operations are active 

within the area.   

 

The Fisher Canyon property consists of 98 unpatented lode mineral claims located on land controlled by 

the U.S. Department of Interior Bureau of Land Management.  NV Gold controls approximately 827 

hectares (2,043 acres) of claims in two non-contiguous blocks.  The claims are controlled through a 

purchase agreement with Evolving Gold Corp. and a lease agreement with Mountain Gold Exploration 

Inc. and Thomas Mancuso.    

 

The project area is located on the southeastern end of the Humboldt Range.  The overall geologic 

framework of the Humboldt Range is antiformal, cored by Permian-Triassic Koipato Group 

metavolcanic rocks that are progressively overlain by the Prida, Augusta Mountain, and Cane Spring 

formations of the Star Peak Group and the Grass Valley Formation of the Auld Lang Syne Group.

Stratigraphy in the Fisher Canyon project area generally dips eastward.  The oldest rocks are Weaver 

rhyolite of the Koipato Group, exposed in the northwestern part of the area.  Units of the Prida 

Formation, Augusta Mountain Formation, and Cane Spring Formation are exposed to the southeast.  

These Triassic units, while comprised of a number of distinct lithologies, are dominantly limestone, 

dolomite, and impure limestone.  In the region of the Humboldt Range, the Augusta Mountain 

Formation includes kilometer-scale lenses of basalt flows and volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks 

interbedded with the dominant carbonate lithologies.   

 

Hydrothermal alteration and geochemical gold enrichment have been identified over an area extending 

approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) north-south by 1.6 kilometer (1 mile) east-west.  Alteration 

recognized at Fisher Canyon occurs predominantly within the units of volcanic and volcaniclastic rock 

and immediately adjacent limestone within the Augusta Mountain Formation.  This hydrothermal 

alteration includes silicification, clay alteration, and introduction of disseminated pyrite.  Weathering of 

the pyrite-bearing rocks produces iron oxides, which create a visually striking rusty landscape.    

 

The Fisher Canyon prospect was identified through drainage BLEG (Bulk Leach Extractable Gold) 

sampling, and claims were staked in 2007.  Exploration of the property by prior owners included rock-

chip geochemistry and one phase of reverse-circulation percussion drilling.  Rock-chip geochemical 

sampling outlined a large area with significant enrichment in gold, silver, and particularly arsenic. 

 

The Fisher Canyon property was drill-tested with an initial reconnaissance-scale drilling program in 

December 2007.  The drill program consisted of 971 meters (3,186 feet) of reverse-circulation 

percussion drilling in 13 holes, ranging from 40 meters (130 feet) to 137 meters (450 feet) in depth, with 

holes grouped within a single target area.  Twelve of the 13 drill holes encountered gold values ranging 

from 0.1 to 4.14 g Au/t over the individual 1.52-meter (five-foot) sample intervals.   

 

Since acquiring its initial interest in the property in June 2009, NV Gold has obtained high-resolution 

satellite imagery of the project area and completed rock-chip and soil geochemical programs.  The 

satellite imagery has a resolution of approximately 0.5 meters that exhibits exceptional color fidelity.  

Soil geochemical programs collected and analyzed 669 soil samples covering an area of approximately 

270 hectares (667 acres) on rectangular grids of 50 x 50 meters or 50 x 100 meters.  Samples contain 

significant enrichments of gold and pathfinder elements; notable results include 21 samples that assayed 

greater than 50 ppb gold, 13 samples that returned greater than 0.5 ppm silver, and 53 samples that 

contain greater than 100 ppm arsenic.  Rock geochemical programs collected and analyzed 57 rock 

samples.  Results of note include a maximum gold concentration of 9.7 ppm gold, with 7 samples 

reporting greater than 1 ppm gold; 15 samples contain greater than 1000 ppm arsenic and 13 contain 

greater than 0.5 ppm silver.  The map patterns of geochemical enrichments in rocks and soils are similar 

and provide evidence of stratigraphic and structural controls to mineralization.  

 

Known geology, hydrothermal alteration, and mineralization styles at Fisher Canyon suggest potential 

for discovery of disseminated gold mineralization hosted by sedimentary rocks, commonly referred to as 

Carlin-type gold mineralization.  Carlin-type gold deposits are largely replacement bodies with visually 

subtle alteration and gold contained in solid solution or as submicron particles in disseminated pyrite.  

 

The Fisher Canyon gold exploration property represents a property of merit that warrants continued 

exploration.  The authors recommend that NV Gold proceed with a systematic, staged exploration

program to define and prioritize prospects for early drill testing.  The recommended program includes 

geological mapping, additional rock and soil geochemistry, and reverse-circulation drilling.  A prudent 

first-phase exploration program conducted with funding on the order of USD$550,000 should 

substantially improve understanding of the economic mineral potential of the Fisher Canyon property 

and provide a drill test of the highest priority targets.

2.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 

Mine Development Associates ("MDA") has prepared this technical report for the Fisher Canyon 

project, located in Pershing County, Nevada, at the request of Dreamweaver Capital Corporation 

("Dreamweaver"), a Canadian capital pool corporation listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, in 

connection with its proposed "qualifying transaction".  Following the qualifying transaction, 

Dreamweaver proposes to amalgamate with NV Gold Corporation (USA) ("NV Gold"), a private 

Nevada corporation that holds leases and claims that make up the Fisher Canyon project.  The 

amalgamated company then plans to change its name to NV Gold Corporation, which will be listed on 

the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX Venture Exchange).       

 

The technical report is written in compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in the 

Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), Companion Policy 43-

101CP, and Form 43-101F1.   

2.1 Project Scope and Terms of Reference 

 

The purpose of this report is to provide a technical review of the Fisher Canyon project that describes 

the geologic setting of the project area, summarizes completed exploration activities, and presents 

recommendations for future exploration of the property.  Both Odin D. Christensen and Michael M. 

Gustin, the authors of this report, are Qualified Persons under NI 43-101.  While Mr. Christensen is the 

senior author of this report and initially began his technical review of the project as an independent 

representative of MDA, he subsequently agreed to join the future board of directors of NV Gold 

Corporation.  Since this could be perceived as compromising his independence with respect to NV Gold, 

Mr. Gustin takes full responsibility for this report.  There is no affiliation between Mr. Gustin and 

Dreamweaver or NV Gold except that of an independent consultant/client relationship. 

 

The scope of this report included a review of pertinent technical reports and data provided to MDA by 

NV Gold relative to the general setting, geology, project history, exploration activities and results, 

methodology, quality assurance, and interpretations.  MDA received a digital database of drill and 

surface geochemical data from NV Gold, upon which the authors have relied.  The authors' mandate 

was to comment on substantive public or private documents and technical information listed in Section 

21.0.  The mandate also required on-site inspection and the preparation of this independent technical 

report containing the authors' observations, conclusions, and recommendations.  Both authors have 

considerable geological experience in Nevada, particularly with gold deposits in Nevada.  The 

conclusions and recommendations made in this report are based on the authors' review of the historical 

exploration data tempered by their personal experience.   

 

NV Gold acquired a portion of its interest in the Fisher Canyon property from Evolving Gold Corp. 

("Evolving Gold"), and much of the technical information reviewed was provided to NV Gold by 

Evolving Gold.  Mr. Christensen spent one day in the field at Fisher Canyon on April 8, 2009, with Mr. 

John Watson of NV Gold and Mr. Quinton Hennigh, President and Chief Geologist of Evolving Gold, 

reviewing field exposures and related technical information.  Mr. Christensen also visited the site on 

May 21 through 25, August 3 through 5, and September 3, 2009, during which he completed geological 

reviews, reconnaissance geological mapping, and geochemical sampling.  Mr. Gustin visited the 

property on September 1, 2009.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Location 

 

The Fisher Canyon property is located in central Pershing County, Nevada, approximately 32 kilometers 

(20 miles) east of Lovelock, the county seat of Pershing County (Figure 4.1).  The property is located 

within the Antelope Springs mining district (Johnson, 1977; Tingley, 1985) on the east flank of the 

Humboldt Range, overlooking Buena Vista Valley to the east.  Elevations at Fisher Canyon range from 

4,400 feet to 8,800 feet above mean sea level.   

 

Exploration activity to date has been centered within the drainage of Cow Canyon at approximately 40
°
 

12' North latitude, 118
°
 5' West longitude, or UTM coordinates 407,000 East, 4,451,500 North, North 

American Datum 1927, Zone 11.  The Fisher Canyon and Fitting 7.5-minute topographic maps of the 

United States Geological Survey ("USGS") cover the project area; the site lies on the Lovelock 1
°
 x 2

°
 

map sheet of the USGS.   

4.2 Land Area 

 

The Fisher Canyon property consists of 98 unpatented lode mineral claims located on public lands 

administered by the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") in Sections 31 and 32, Township 28 North, 

Range 35 East; and Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16, and 17, Township 27 North, Range 35 East, Mount Diablo 

Base and Meridian (Figure 4.2; "CC" = Crackle Canyon claims; "CCN" = Cow Canyon claims; "RC" = 

RC claims).  NV Gold controls approximately 2,043 acres (827 hectares).  The claims are in two non-

contiguous blocks, as shown on Figure 4.2.  Claims currently controlled by NV Gold are listed with 

details in Appendix B.  The public land records of the BLM and Pershing County were reviewed by Mr. 

Christensen in order to superficially review the status of the project claims; no discrepancies or 

omissions from the information provided herein were noted.

4.3 Agreements and Encumbrances 

 

NV Gold's interests in the 98 unpatented lode mining claims that comprise the Fisher Canyon property 

are based upon a number of underlying agreements.  The authors are not experts with respect to land and 

legal matters in Nevada.  The following information has been summarized from information and 

documents provided by NV Gold to the authors and it is presented here without opinion.   

 

The Crackle Canyon unpatented lode mining claims were located by Mr. Marcus H. Smith of Castle 

Rock, Washington.  These eleven claims were acquired by Evolving Gold from Mr. Smith as per the 

terms of a binding Letter of Intent executed February 19, 2008.  Under the terms of this agreement, 

Evolving Gold can acquire 100% right, title, and interest to the specified claims for certain cash 

payments over two years.  Mr. Smith retained a 3% Net Smelter Return ("NSR") production royalty 

interest in the claims; this royalty may be bought down to 1.5% for certain cash payments for three years 

from the date of execution of the Letter of Intent.   

 

In addition to the Crackle Canyon claims, Evolving Gold controls 79 RC unpatented lode mining claims 

at Fisher Canyon that were located in March 2007 by Mr. Quinton Hennigh as agent for Evolving Gold. 

 

Evolving Gold and John E. Watson executed a purchase and sale agreement dated June 1, 2009.  For 

specified payments over a period of five years, Watson has the right to acquire all right, title and interest 

to the Fisher Canyon claims controlled by Evolving Gold, subject to an NSR Royalty retained by 

Evolving Gold.  The defined property includes the 79 RC claims and the 11 Crackle Canyon claims, as 

shown on Figure 4.2 and listed in Appendix B.  In addition to the underlying royalty held by Mr. Smith, 

Evolving Gold retained a 3.0% NSR Royalty; Watson has the right to reduce the royalty to 1.0% 

through certain specified payments at any time during the five-year purchase period.    

 

Eight CCN claims were located by Mountain Gold Exploration Inc. at Fisher Canyon in September 

2005.  An Exploration and Mining Lease and Option to Purchase Royalty Agreement was executed on 

August 3, 2009 between John E. Watson and the owners of the CCN claims, Mountain Gold Exploration 

Inc., a Nevada Corporation with an undivided 50% interest in the claims, and Thomas Mancuso, in 

individual with an undivided 50% interest in the claims.  Under terms of the agreement, the owners lease 

the property to Mr. Watson for the purpose of mineral exploration, development, and extraction of 

minerals for a period of 20 years subject to a 3% NSR royalty; a schedule of advance royalty payments 

is defined in the agreement.  One percent of the 3% NSR royalty may be purchased for a period of three 

years from the date of execution, and an additional one percent for a period of five years from the date 

of execution.  In addition, Mr. Watson is obligated to expend specified amounts on exploration activity 

on the property each year as follows:  $100,000 by the first anniversary of the agreement, an additional 

$50,000 by the third anniversary of the agreement, and an additional $100,000 by the fifth anniversary 

of the agreement.  Work expenditures in excess of the work commitment requirement for that year will 

be credited against the work commitment for subsequent years.  

 

Mr. Watson's interests in the lease and purchase agreements summarized above were assigned to NV 

Gold in September 2009.

4.4 Environmental Permits and Potential Liabilities 

 

Exploration drilling at the Fisher Canyon property will require approval of a Notice of Intent from the 

BLM.  Two such Notices, one each for two areas of proposed drilling, were prepared by 

Enviroscientists, Inc. of Reno, Nevada and hand-delivered to the BLM office in Winnemucca on August 

20, 2009. 

 

Other than disturbance related to previous drilling on the property, which includes drill access roads and 

drill sites, MDA is not aware of any material environmental liabilities at the Fisher Canyon property.

5.0 ACCESS, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Access 

 
The Fisher Canyon property is readily accessible year-round from Lovelock or Winnemucca, Nevada 

(Figure 4.1).  From Lovelock, one drives north on Interstate 80 approximately 10 kilometers (six miles)  

to the Coal Canyon exit; then east approximately 21 kilometers (13 miles) on a paved road up Coal 

Canyon and crossing the West Humboldt Range; then turning and winding north and east around the 

south end of the Humboldt Range on paved road for approximately 10 kilometers (six miles); then north 

along the all-weather dirt Old Emigrant Trail for 12 kilometers (eight miles); then turning westward on a 

dirt track climbing gently to the property at a distance of approximately five kilometers (three miles) 

(Figure 4.1). 

 

From Winnemucca, the property can be reached by driving approximately 50 kilometers (30 miles)  

westward on Interstate 80 to the Mill City exit; then south on Nevada 400 approximately 60 kilometers 

(38 miles ) following the Old Emigrant Trail; then turning westward on a dirt track to access the 

property in approximately five kilometers (three miles ).   

 

Reasonable dirt tracks extend up Cow Canyon and Fisher Canyon; rugged jeep tracks extend up several 

other small valleys.  Access to remote parts of the property on these tracks requires a sturdy four-wheel-

drive vehicle; much of the property can currently be reached only on foot.  Except for occasional days of 

exceptional snow or rain, the property is accessible for exploration all year.  Several large precious-

metal mining operations are currently active nearby in Pershing and Humboldt counties.   

5.2 Climate 

 
The climate is typical for the arid high desert of the Great Basin, characterized by warm, dry summers 

with intermittent thunderstorms.  Winters are typically cool and relatively dry, although the high peaks 

of the Humboldt Range can be covered with snow for several months.  In all seasons, daily temperature 

ranges can be extreme.  For the closest reporting weather station in Lovelock, 20 miles distant at an 

elevation of 1,212 meters (3,975 feet), the average daily minimum temperature varies from -8°C 

(17.6°F) in December to 12.7°C (54.8°F) in July; the average daily maximum temperature varies from 

5.2°C (41.3°F) in January to 33.2°C (91.7°F) in July.  Lovelock receives annual average precipitation of 

13.5 centimeters (5.3 inches), which is distributed relatively uniformly throughout the year.  For 

Winnemucca, 100 kilometers (60 miles) distant at an elevation of 1,310 meters (4,297 feet), average 

daily minimum temperatures vary between -8.5°C (16.7°F) in January to 9.3°C (48.7°F) in August; 

average daily maximum temperatures vary between 5.6°C (42.1°F) in January to 33.9°C (93.0°F) in 

July; annual average precipitation at Winnemucca is 20.8 centimeters (8.2 inches).  There is greater 

precipitation on the high peaks of the Humboldt Mountains, estimated up to 51 centimeters (20 inches) 

per year.   

 

Vegetation is sparse, consisting primarily of low-growing Big Sage, Antelope Bitterbrush, Rabbitbrush, 

Winterfat, Russian Thistle, and grasses of various types on the pediment, while the slopes of the range

contain similar shrubs and sparse Juniper trees.  Wildlife includes antelope, wild horses, rabbits, coyote, 

rattlesnakes, various rodents, and a variety of birds.   

 

The location and climate are favorable for exploration and mining year-round without particular weather 

difficulties.   

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

 

Lovelock, with a population of 2,880, is the county seat and service center of Pershing County.  

Agriculture is the most important element of the local economy.  Services are limited, although motel 

accommodations are considerable.  Winnemucca, the county seat of Humboldt County with a population 

of 7,175, is a regional service center.  Although agriculture is important, Winnemucca is also an active 

mining center, servicing large gold mines located between Winnemucca and Battle Mountain.  There is 

a workforce skilled and experienced in mineral exploration and mining.  Both Lovelock and 

Winnemucca are served by Interstate Highway 80 and by the Union Pacific Railroad.   

 

Reno, with a population of 220,600 in the city proper, is located 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of 

Lovelock.  Although known as a gaming center, Reno is also a major warehouse and distribution center 

for the western United States and it hosts an international airport.  Elko, Nevada, located 320 kilometers 

(200 miles) to the east of Lovelock, is a major mining center, with vendors for most equipment and 

consumables required for gold exploration and production.   

 
Electrical power is available within the region from high-tension transmission lines running generally 

along the Interstate 80 corridor.  Some mines in northern Nevada receive power from the grid; others 

have their own electrical generation facilities.   

 

Large precious-metal mining operations active or semi-active within 100 kilometers (60 miles) of Fisher 

Canyon include the Florida Canyon gold, Rochester gold-silver, and Relief Canyon gold mines.   

 

5.4 Physiography 

 

The Fisher Canyon property is located on the eastern flank of the Humboldt Range, one of the north-

south-elongate mountain ranges stepping across the Basin and Range from the Wasatch Front in central 

Utah to the Sierra Nevada in western Nevada.  The eastern limit of the Fisher Canyon property lies on 

the gentle pediment slope of the Humboldt Range, along the remnant shoreline of Pleistocene-Holocene 

Lake Lahonton, at an elevation of about 1,340 meters (4,400 feet).  The western side of the property lies 

on the moderately mountainous slopes of the Humboldt Range, extending to an elevation of 2,680 

meters (8,800 feet).   

 

Although the property is cut by several prominent east-directed valleys, there are no active streams on 

the property.  Valleys fill with water only during storm events, with evidence of episodic flash floods.   

 

The authors have no specific information regarding potential water sources.  Water for exploration 

drilling can be purchased in Lovelock.  Scattered natural springs and agricultural wells to the east of the

property in Buena Vista valley indicate that groundwater sources may be present at reasonable depths.  

It might be expected that groundwater is present within the alluvial fill of valleys crossing the property, 

but this has not been tested.

6.0 HISTORY 

6.1 Antelope Springs District 

 

Pershing County, including the Humboldt Range, has been prospected for minerals since the mid-1800s 

when prospectors and miners swarmed throughout Nevada following discovery of the spectacular silver 

deposits of the Comstock Lode.  The Antelope Springs mining district, including a number of mines in 

the low hills at the southern end of the Humboldt Range, has historically been noted for production of 

mercury, antimony, silver, and fluorspar (Tingley, 1985).  The road from Coal Canyon to the Fisher 

Canyon property passes through this district of historic abandoned mines. 

 

Antimony, the first commodity discovered in the district, was found in 1864.  Total antimony production 

from the district has amounted to over 466 tonnes of metal from several mines.  Numerous small 

antimony mines produced intermittently through the 1950s.  Rich silver ore was discovered in 1869 at 

the Relief mine, originally known as the Batavia and Pacific; the mine is estimated to have produced 

between $200,000 and $2,500,000 of silver, largely during the 1870s.  Mercury was discovered in the 

district in 1907, although little or no ore was produced before 1914.  Between 1914 and 1969, especially 

during times of high mercury prices, mines in the district were worked extensively (Johnson, 1977). 

 

The Relief Canyon gold mine is located about five kilometers (three miles) west of Fisher Canyon.  This 

prospect was originally known as the Bohannon fluorite prospect.  Gold was discovered by Duval 

Corporation in 1979; the deposit was subsequently explored, developed, and mined by Lacana Mining 

Inc. ("Lacana") (Fiannaca and McKee, 1983).  Pegasus Gold Inc. purchased the property from Lacana in 

1986 and mined it until 1989.  An estimated 141,000 ounces of gold were extracted from the property 

between 1986 and 1989 (Firstgold Corp. 2009).   

 

The Rochester silver-gold mine in the Rochester mining district lies about 10 kilometers (six miles) to 

the northeast of the Fisher Canyon property high on the west flank of the Humboldt Range.  Silver was 

discovered in the Rochester district in the early 1860s, and production has continued intermittently 

through the present.  The major silver deposits of the district are hosted in Permian-Triassic rhyolite of 

the Koipato Group.  Deposits include silver- and gold-bearing quartz-tourmaline veins and vein 

stockworks.  Early selective mining followed individual veins; modern mining has involved open-pit 

extraction of lower-grade material.  To date, the Rochester district has produced some 4.5 million 

ounces of gold and 130 million ounces of silver.   

 

There are numerous prospect pits and scrapes on the Fisher Canyon property for which no record 

remains.  Many tested small occurrences of quartz veins, and it is considered likely that the objective of 

the prospectors was antimony or perhaps mercury.  In the area of the CCN claims, there exists a sinuous 

network of historic roadways and bulldozer scrapes exceeding two kilometers in length.  Seven 

collapsed percussion drill holes are noted on these roadways, and the presence of drill cuttings suggests 

the presence of numerous additional drill holes.  We estimate that at least 20 holes were drilled in the 

area.  No record of this work is known.  The old disturbance appears on air photos taken in 1975; some 

of the old roads are now inaccessible by vehicle.

6.2 Fisher Canyon Property 

 

The Fisher Canyon property was identified as a gold exploration target by a BLEG (Bulk Leach 

Extractable Gold) drainage-sediment sampling program completed by Newcrest Mining Limited 

("Newcrest") in the early 1990s.  Newcrest did not pursue the property, however, due to depressed 

industry conditions at the time.   

 

Evolving Gold returned recognized important alteration characteristics exposed in rock outcroppings at 

the property in 2007 and staked 179 claims in late March 2007.  This property position was subsequently 

reduced to the 79 claims now controlled by NV Gold.   

 

6.2.1 Rock-Chip Geochemistry 

 

Evolving Gold geologists completed two programs of rock-chip geochemical sampling within and 

surrounding the Fisher Canyon property.  A total of 167 rock-chip samples were collected from the 

current property area.  The samples, which were selectively taken by geologists on the basis of visual 

manifestations of possible alteration and mineralization, are shown on Figure 6.1.  The samples contain 

significant concentrations of gold and pathfinder elements, notably:  

 

 The maximum gold value is 11.65 ppm Au; 

 7 samples contain greater than 2 ppm Au; 

 25 samples contain greater than 1 ppm Au; 

 36 samples (21%) contain greater than 0.5 ppm Au; 
 

 6 samples contain greater than 20 ppm Ag; 

 71 samples (42%) contain greater than 1 ppm Ag; 
 

 13 samples contain greater than 5000 ppm As; 

 70 samples contain greater than 1000 ppm As. 
 

These surface concentrations of gold, silver, and pathfinder elements are anomalous.

6.2.2 Evolving Gold Drilling 

 

The Fisher Canyon property was tested with a reconnaissance-scale drilling program by Evolving Gold 

in December 2007.  This program is discussed in greater detail in Section 11.   

 

The Evolving Gold holes were grouped within a single target area along the north side of Cow Canyon.  

According to Evolving Gold (2008), all holes penetrated a sequence of marly shale and basalt and 

terminated in footwall crystalline limestone.  Twelve of the 13 drill holes encountered gold values 

ranging from 0.1 to 4.14 g Au/t over individual 1.52-meter (five-foot) sample intervals.   

 

NV Gold has access to all data from this drilling program, including lithology chip trays.

7.0 GEOLOGIC SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geologic Setting 

 

The Fisher Canyon property is located in northwestern Nevada at the southern end of the Humboldt 

Range within the Basin and Range physiographic province.  Johnson (1977) summarized the geology of 

Pershing County, from which the following discussion is taken except as referenced. 

 

During Paleozoic time, western Nevada was the site of deep-water sedimentation and local marine 

volcanism, while to the east of Pershing County predominantly carbonate rocks were deposited on the 

continental shelf.  East-directed compression transported rocks of the western assemblage to the east on 

the Roberts Mountains thrust during the Late Devonian to Early Mississippian Antler Orogeny.  A 

second compressional episode during the Permian-Early Triassic Sonoma Orogeny produced more east-

directed transport on the Golconda thrust, which lies to the west of the Roberts Mountains thrust.  The 

Sonoma Orogeny also resulted in accretion of a Paleozoic oceanic arc to the continental margin 

outboard of the Golconda allochthon (Figure 7.1) (Jones, 2008; Wyld, 2000). 

 

The sedimentary environment changed in the Early Triassic with deposition of a thick non-marine 

sequence of rhyolitic and andesitic volcanic rocks over much of what is now Pershing County.  

Subsequent uplift and erosion were followed by a long period of sedimentation that began in the late 

Early Triassic and deposited lithologically variable marine and non-marine sedimentary sequences at 

first, followed by more uniform carbonate deposits, including the Augusta Mountain and Cane Spring 

formations (together formerly called the Natchez Pass Formation) of the Fisher Canyon area.  Generally 

speaking, in the Early Triassic there was a shelf terrane to the east with abundant carbonate lithologies; a 

volcanic-rich marine succession to the west; and an intervening basinal terrane with a deep-marine 

basinal succession dominated by fine-grained siliciclastic rocks (Figure 7.1) (Wyld, 2000).  From 

Middle Triassic to Early Jurassic time, there were uplifts that resulted in the deposition of near-shore 

deltaic deposits of mudstone, shale, and sandstone that include the Grass Valley Formation of the Fisher 

Canyon area. 

 

A third episode of pre-Cenozoic deformation occurred during the Jurassic and Cretaceous during the 

Nevadan Orogeny, which was characterized by low-grade regional metamorphism, variably directed 

folding and thrust faulting, and extensive intrusion of granodiorite in the region.   

 

Several episodes of plutonism are recorded in this region, ranging in age from Early Triassic to Tertiary.  

Early Triassic leucogranites and rhyolite porphyries were associated with contemporaneous volcanism.  

During the Middle Jurassic, gabbro was widely intruded as sills in the south-central part of the county, 

south and southwest of the Fisher Canyon area.  Late Cretaceous granitic stocks are present in the 

Humboldt Range along with numerous diabase dikes associated with these stocks.  Other Cretaceous 

and Tertiary granodiorite plutons are exposed in the region. 

 

During the Cenozoic, basaltic, andesitic, and rhyolitic flows, breccias, and tuffs, with intercalated 

lacustrine deposits, fanglomerate, and fluvial sand and gravel, were deposited across the county.  

Quaternary alluvial deposits fill the structural basins between ranges in Pershing County, and they are 

also exposed on the flanks of the ranges.

September 22, 2009 10/12/09 8:46 AM 

The structural regime changed dramatically during extensional tectonism in the Cenozoic.  High-angle 

normal faulting and tilting of Tertiary units exemplify this period of regional extension that resulted in 

the present physiography of the Basin and Range Province.

7.2 Local Geology 

 

The following subsection is based largely on Wyld (2000). 

 

The Fisher Canyon property lies on the eastern flank of the southern Humboldt Range.  The Humboldt 

Range itself is the product of Cenozoic high-angle normal faulting, and as such is one of the typical, 

generally north-trending fault-bounded ranges of the Basin and Range Province.  The overall geologic 

framework within the Humboldt Range is antiformal, cored by Paleozoic rocks deformed during the 

Sonoma Orogeny (Golconda terrane) and by Permian-Triassic Koipato Group metavolcanic rocks.  The 

Koipato Group consists of a thick (>3 kilometers) sequence of rhyolitic and less common mafic volcanic 

strata that were deposited in a shallow-marine to subaerial environment during an episode of block 

faulting that was probably related to regional extension.  Subsequent erosion of the Koipato Group 

occurred in the earliest Triassic, prior to deposition of the Star Peak Group. 

 

The Koipato Group is overlain by the Star Peak Group, which represents a marine carbonate platform 

developed over the volcanic rocks in the Middle Triassic (Nichols and Silberling, 1977).  Formational 

names within the Star Peak Group are somewhat confusing, with different names historically applied in 

different ranges.  What is now mapped as the middle and upper members of the Augusta Mountain 

Formation and the overlying Cane Spring Formation was formerly called the Natchez Pass Formation in 

the Humboldt Range; Natchez Pass Formation is the formational name used on the geologic map of 

Wallace et al. (1959; 1969), which is shown in Section 7.3 of this report. 

 

The Prida, Augusta Mountain, and Cane Spring formations make up the Star Peak Group.  The basal 

Prida Formation consists of a mixture of carbonate and locally derived clastic rocks deposited in a 

shallow-marine to subaerial environment. With subsidence of this shelf terrane, calcareous shale 

intercalated with fossiliferous, thin- to medium-bedded, fine-grained limestone of the middle member of 

the Prida was deposited.  Basinal conditions continued in the western part of the shelf with deposition of 

dark limestone and intercalated chert as the upper member of the Prida Formation.  With repeated 

episodes of uplift and erosion, the carbonate platform margin migrated westward with deposition of 

shallow-marine to supratidal carbonates of the Augusta Mountain Formation and the Cane Spring 

Formation.  Carbonate deposition was interrupted in the Late Triassic by a period of relative uplift that 

created a regional unconformity and by episodic influx of coarse siliciclastic material.  Again, volcanism 

affected the shelf region as is manifested by the widespread presence of mafic lavas, breccias, and tuffs 

(Figure 7.3).   

 

Depositional processes changed substantially in Late Triassic when siliciclastic material of the Auld 

Lang Syne Group overwhelmed carbonate deposition.  Auld Lang Syne deposition continued into the 

Early Jurassic.  Units consist largely of shale with subordinate quartz sandstone.  Clastic detritus was 

derived from the continental interior to the east and was deposited in a shallow-marine deltaic 

environment. 

 

The Triassic marine province was terminated in the Jurassic by compressional deformation.  The 

principal manifestation of this deformation in the Humboldt Range is the Luning-Fencemaker fold-and-

thrust belt, which involved thrusting of the basinal terrane over the shelf terrane; this deformation is

7.3 Fisher Canyon Prospect Geologic Setting 

 

The general geology of the Fisher Canyon property is shown on the geologic map of Figure 7.3, 

modified from Wallace et al. (1959; 1969).  Although Wallace et al. (1959; 1969) used the name 

Natchez Pass Formation on their map, in this report the current terminology of Augusta Mountain and 

Cane Spring formations is used for the same units. 

 

Stratigraphy in the Fisher Canyon project area generally dips eastward and is limited to Triassic and 

Quaternary units.  The oldest rocks are Weaver rhyolite of the Koipato Group exposed in the 

northwestern corner of the map area, immediately west and northwest of the northwestern corner of the 

property (Figure 7.3).  In sequence up stratigraphy to the southeast are exposed units of the Prida, 

Augusta Mountain, and Cane Spring formations of the Star Peak Group, followed by the basal unit of 

the Auld Lang Syne Formation.  The Star Peak Group is dominantly a unit of limestone, except in this 

portion of the Humboldt Range, where it also contains lenses of volcaniclastic sediments and flows of 

andesitic to basaltic composition.  The presence of pillows and amygdaloidal basalt indicates that these 

volcanic rocks were deposited in shallow water.  The volcanic rocks of the Star Peak Group form giant 

lenses within the carbonate section, with dimensions of several kilometers along strike and up to about 

200 meters thick.  Within the volcanic rock lenses, the different lithologies are generally stratified and 

appear to form an irregular stack of small lenses and channels. 

 

The following units make up the Star Peak Group in the Fisher Canyon area; lithologic descriptions are 

from Wallace et al. (1959; 1969) but with the currently used formation names: 

 

Prida Formation:  The Prida Formation, basal unit of the Star Peak Group, consists of a basal unit 

composed mainly of grit and pebble conglomerate with fragments of Koipato rhyolite in a siliceous 

matrix, with subordinate thin-bedded sandstone and siliceous argillite.  These are overlain by shale, silty 

limestone, calcareous siltstone, and silty and sandy dolomite.  Limestone and dolomite dominate the 

upper part of the Prida Formation. 

 

Augusta Mountain Formation (formerly called Lower Natchez Pass Formation):  The Augusta Mountain 

Formation consists of massive gray limestone and dolomite, mostly thick- and very thick-bedded, that is 

bioclastic in part.  Interlayered within the limestone are lenses of altered andesite flows, volcanic 

breccia, tuffaceous sandstone, and tuffaceous siltstone.  The volcaniclastic rocks are variably calcareous.  

Volcanic rocks are non-porphyritic, with or without vesicles or amygdules, and occasionally include 

pillow lavas and peperite.  Within the Fisher Canyon claim area, volcaniclastic sandstone, siltstone, and 

mudstone comprise approximately three-quarters of the Triassic volcanic section within the Augusta 

Mountain Formation.  The gold prospects identified and drill tested by Evolving Gold in 2007 are all 

located within the Augusta Mountain Formation. 

 

Cane Spring Formation (formerly called Upper Natchez Pass Formation):  The Cane Spring Formation 

consists of two mappable units.  The lower unit (Trnu1) is thin- to thick-bedded impure limestone.  The 

unit is predominantly grayish-brown weathering and forms smooth slopes with an evenly bedded 

appearance.  The upper unit (Trnu1) is massive gray limestone, thick- and very thick-bedded, that forms 

prominent gray outcrops and ridges.

September 22, 2009 10/12/09 8:46 AM 

Overlying the Star Peak Group is the Late Triassic Auld Lang Syne Group, of which only the basal 

Grass Valley Formation is present in the Fisher Canyon area.  The olive-gray to brownish-gray Grass 

Valley Formation is finely fractured slate and micaceous siltstone with subordinate interbeds of light-

colored micaceous sandstone.   

 

Quaternary basalt occurs as isolated caps on hills within the area.  The tilting of these young basalt caps 

demonstrates large-scale movement on extensional faults bounding the ranges. Thick sequences of lake 

sediments from Pleistocene Lake Lahontan cover the floor of Buena Vista Valley.   

 

The stratigraphy within the Fisher Canyon area has been significantly disrupted by faulting.  Prominent 

faults shown on Figure 7.3 are dominantly north-south oriented, although other orientations are present.  

Field reconnaissance suggests that low-angle faults may be present and may represent exploration 

targets.

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPES 

8.1 Carlin-Type Sedimentary-Rock-Hosted Disseminated Gold Deposits 

 

Known exposed geology, hydrothermal alteration, and mineralization styles at Fisher Canyon suggest 

potential for discovery of disseminated gold mineralization hosted in sedimentary rocks, commonly 

referred to as Carlin-type gold mineralization.  Carlin-type gold deposits are largely replacement bodies 

with visually subtle alteration that is dominated by decarbonatization of silty carbonate host rocks, and 

they contain gold in solid solution or as submicron particles in disseminated arsenical pyrite or marcasite 

(Cline et al., 2005).  Current production from Carlin-type deposits dominates gold production from 

Nevada and constitutes about 9% of world production.   

 

In northern Nevada, the largest number of Carlin-type gold deposits and the largest deposits are 

localized along several linear groups or "trends", notably the Carlin, Battle Mountain and Getchell 

trends.  Other significant gold deposits, however, are situated off these trends, and exploration continues 

to discover new deposits in new districts.   

 

Although Carlin-type sedimentary rock-hosted disseminated gold deposits generally share common 

attributes, each deposit presents a unique assemblage of features.  The following discussion largely 

follows that of Cline et al. (2005).  Carlin-type mineralization is characterized by disseminated, gold-

bearing, and trace element-rich pyrite that occurs in replacement bodies in carbonate sedimentary host-

rock sequences.  The various forms of individual deposits (tabular, stratabound, carrot-shaped, T-

shaped, irregular) reflect local zones of porosity and permeability that result from favorable lithologic 

features, high- and low-angle faults, and especially intersections of these features.  Largely low-angle 

and stratiform bodies may have root zones, such as high-angle solution feeder faults.   

 

Deposits are commonly elongate parallel to high-angle structures and are frequently capped by less-

permeable horizons.  The highest-grade mineralization is often concentrated within domes or anticlines, 

where high-angle structures acted as feeders in a style similar to that of petroleum reservoirs.   

 

While igneous rocks are present in some deposits, they are absent (or hidden at great depth) in others.  

Deposit mineralogy and geochemistry reflect the association of gold with arsenic, antimony, thallium, 

and mercury in preference to base metals and silver.  Most gold was deposited with main-stage minerals, 

including arsenian pyrite and marcasite, quartz, kaolinite, dickite, and illite.  While obviously important, 

these main-stage minerals are fine grained and volumetrically minor in comparison to host-rock 

minerals such as quartz, micas and clay minerals, calcite, dolomite, and carbon.  Mineralized rock may 

be visually indistinguishable from non-mineralized rock, especially when it is unoxidized.   

 

Gold is interpreted to have been transported as a soluble bisulfide complex in hydrothermal solutions.  

Interaction of the sulfide in solution with reactive iron in the rock host caused precipitation of pyrite and 

gold.  It is commonly observed that higher gold grades occur in rock with greater concentrations of 

reactive iron.     

 

Late-stage minerals, which frequently fill late brittle veins and can serve as exploration guides, include 

calcite, pyrite, quartz, orpiment, realgar, barite, and stibnite.

September 22, 2009 10/12/09 8:46 AM 

Wall rock alteration in Carlin-type gold deposits may be subtle.  Carbonate minerals were dissolved in 

nearly all deposits and locally replaced by quartz to form jasperoid.  Intense carbonate dissolution 

produced collapse breccias in some deposits, significantly enhancing porosity, permeability, and fluid-

rock reaction.  Host rocks are argillized where susceptible silicate minerals were present to be altered.  

Elsewhere, clay-rich rock that may be described as argillized is often more accurately described as the 

insoluble residue from dissolution of an impure carbonate host lithology.  Silicification accompanies 

some, but not all, gold deposition and is manifest by the presence of jasperoid and, to a lesser extent, 

fine quartz druses that line vugs.  Ore-stage quartz veins are not common in this type of deposit.  

Although many Nevada Carlin-type gold deposits occur in carbon-rich rocks, important deposits also 

occur in rocks low in carbon.   

 

Recent studies of Carlin-type deposits in Nevada have convincingly demonstrated a chronological, 

spatial, and presumably genetic connection between these gold deposits and Eocene magmatism.  In the 

field, however, this connection is not apparent and is not a useful exploration guide.   

8.2 Sedimentary-Rock-Hosted Gold Deposits in the Humboldt Mountains 

 

There are several important historic and currently active gold mines in the Humboldt Mountains 

exploiting gold deposits hosted in sedimentary rocks.  The Florida Canyon mine, located at the north end 

of the Humboldt Range and currently owned by Jipangu Inc., has produced more than two million 

ounces of gold.  Mineralization is hosted within argillite, siltstone, and shale of the Triassic Grass Valley 

Formation.  Carlin-type gold mineralization at the Standard mine, along the west side of the Humboldt 

Range, occurs at the apparently conformable contact between the Cane Spring Formation and overlying 

Grass Valley Formation.   

 

Just five kilometers (three miles) to the west of Fisher Canyon is the Relief Canyon gold deposit, 

recently returned to production by Firstgold Corp.  Gold mineralization at Relief Canyon is low-grade 

disseminated epithermal mineralization in sedimentary rocks (Lowe et al., 1985; Wittkopp et al., 1984a; 

Wittkopp et al., 1984b).  The Relief Canyon gold deposit formed in a limestone solution breccia 

developed at the contact between the Cane Spring Formation and the overlying Grass Valley Formation.  

Limestone immediately beneath the contact was reduced to unconsolidated, unsorted rubble of limestone 

fragments in a matrix of mud and clay.  In places, overlying Grass Valley beds collapsed into the large 

pipe-like caverns, forming a chaotic jumble of small fragments.  Hydrothermal fluids, introduced along 

high-angle faults, permeated the cave-fill sediment.  Auriferous late-stage jasperoids formed along the 

fault zones and in irregular blankets at the contact.  In plan, the host breccia unit has the form of an 

irregular triangular wedge, the apex of which is located at the central east limit of the deposit.  The unit 

reaches a thickness of about 60 meters (200 feet).  Surface guides to the deposit included bold outcrops 

of jasperoid and widespread iron-oxide staining (Wallace, 1989). 

 

Exploration by NV Gold at Fisher Canyon will focus on discovery of Carlin-type disseminated gold 

mineralization.  As discussed above, the Triassic stratigraphic section present on the property hosts this 

style of gold deposits elsewhere in the Humboldt Range.  Hydrothermal alteration features and 

geochemical enrichments present in the property are important exploration guides for this deposit type.

9.0 MINERALIZATION 
 

Currently recognized gold mineralization at the Fisher Canyon prospect occurs mainly within the mixed 

volcanic, clastic, and carbonate lithologies of the Augusta Mountain Formation.   

 

Fine casts of iron oxide after disseminated pyrite are common within the altered volcanic rock, staining 

outcrops with limonite.  Locally greater concentrations of iron oxide have created gossanous weathering 

exposures, many of which have been cut open by prospectors.  All of the zones of anomalous 

geochemistry highlighted by rock and soil geochemical work to date occur within and surrounding areas 

of volcanic rocks.  Local geologic settings apparently favorable for gold concentration include: 

 

 porous volcaniclastic sedimentary rock beneath coherent basalt flow units; 

 high-angle faults and quartz-vein-filled faults; and 

 the contact of the volcanic rock section with overlying limestone.   
 

Alteration styles observed include:   

 

 penetrative and fracture-controlled carbonate dissolution (decalcification) and silicification of 
limestone; 

 clay alteration of volcanic rock; 

 sulfidation of volcanic rock to form disseminated pyrite; and 

 supergene oxidation of pyrite to form iron oxides.   
 

Some outcrops with gold enrichment are cut by white quartz veins and veinlets.  Whether these veinlets 

are associated with gold mineralization or represent another hydrothermal event (perhaps with antimony 

mineralization) has yet to be determined.   

 

Jasperoid outcrops are not common on the property.  Rather, it seems likely that altered and mineralized 

rock may be recessive weathering.   

 

Gold mineralization is accompanied by enrichments in other elements commonly associated as 

pathfinder elements with sedimentary-rock-hosted disseminated gold deposits (see Section 6.2.1).  

Arsenic, in particular, is extremely enriched in the district.  Antimony and mercury are widely enriched 

within the southern Humboldt Range and may prove to be useful exploration guides at Fisher Canyon.   

 

As currently known, the zone of hydrothermal alteration and pathfinder element enrichment extends 

approximately four kilometers (2.5 miles) north-south with a width of 1.6 kilometers (one mile) east-

west.

10.0 EXPLORATION BY THE ISSUER 
 

Since acquiring its interest in the Fisher Canyon property, NV Gold has purchased high-resolution 

satellite imagery of the project area and has completed two programs of geochemical sampling.  The 

geochemical programs were designed to highlight areas of gold and pathfinder element enrichments in 

soil and rock as a guide for exploration drilling.   

10.1 Satellite Imagery 

 

NV Gold acquired high-resolution color satellite imagery for the project area from GeoEye, 

headquartered in Dulles, Virginia.  The imagery has resolution of 0.5 meters and exceptional color 

fidelity.  The images will facilitate geological mapping and land-use planning and permitting.  When 

required, the imagery will be used to prepare a high-resolution digital elevation model of the project 

area.  The imagery extends well beyond the current property limits, and it will also be utilized in 

regional exploration activities.   

 

10.2 Soil Geochemistry 

 

NV Gold has completed two programs of soil geochemical exploration covering approximately one-

third of the claim area.  The company completed the larger soil geochemical survey in June and August 

2009.  Geochemical sampling was contracted to North American Exploration Inc. of Kaysville, Utah.  

Soil samples were collected on a rectangular grid at intervals of 50 meters on east-west-oriented lines 

spaced at 100 meters.  This grid was tightened to a spacing of 50 meters by 50 meters in a central area of 

greater interest.  A total of 617 soil samples were collected in this program.   

 

A more limited program of soil geochemical sampling was completed over the area of the CCN claims.  

A total of 52 samples were collected by Mr. Christensen on a 50-meter-by-50-meter square grid.  

Together, the two soil geochemical programs covered approximately 270 hectares (667 acres).  The 

distribution of gold in soil as determined by these two sampling programs is illustrated in Figure 10.1.

The soils from these two programs confirmed geochemical enrichment, particularly in gold and arsenic.  

Of note, for the 669 total combined soil samples: 

 

 the maximum gold concentration is 0.47 ppm Au; 

 6 samples contain greater than 100 ppb Au; 

 21 samples contain greater than 50 ppb Au; 

 139 samples contain greater than 10 ppb Au; 
 

 the maximum arsenic concentration is 5790 ppm As; 

 53 samples contain greater than 100 ppm As; 

 102 samples contain greater than 50 ppm As; 
 

 13 samples contain greater than 0.5 ppm Ag. 
 

The map patterns of gold, arsenic, and silver distributions define areas of greater surface enrichment of 

these elements and indicate favorable stratigraphic and structural controls on mineralization.   

10.3 Rock Geochemistry 

 

Select rock samples were collected during both of the soil geochemical sampling programs discussed in 

the previous section.  Most rock samples were collected as 1.5 to six-meter chip-channel samples across 

outcrops and road cuts.  Eleven rock chip samples were collected by North American Exploration Inc. 

personnel in Section 16, T27N, R35E.  These were select samples to test rock outcrops of quartz-

cemented fault breccia.  In the other program, 46 rock-chip samples were collected by Mr. Christensen 

in Sections 7 and 8, T27N, R35E.  These 46 rock samples were distributed about the area of recognized 

alteration and mineralization, with the objective of defining trends or centers of greater gold enrichment.   

 

The distribution of gold in rocks for these two sampling programs is illustrated on Figure 10.2.

September 22, 2009 10/12/09 8:46 AM 

Analytical results from these two rock geochemical programs confirmed geochemical enrichment, 

particularly in gold and arsenic.  Of note, for the 57 total rock samples: 

 

 the maximum gold concentration is 9.7 ppm Au; 

 7 samples contain greater than 1 ppm Au; 

 18 samples contain greater than 100 ppb Au; 
 

 arsenic concentrations exceed the analytical limit of 10,000 ppm As; 

 14 samples contain greater than 5000 ppm As; 

 90 samples contain greater than 1000 ppm As; 
 

 the maximum silver concentration is 9.7 ppm Ag; 

 13 samples contain greater than 0.5 ppm Ag. 
 

The spatial distribution of geochemical enrichments in rock samples is similar to those of the soil 

samples and provides evidence of stratigraphic and structural controls to mineralization.  Several 

groupings of rock and soil samples with enrichments of gold and pathfinder elements clearly define 

areas for exploration focus.

11.0 DRILLING 
 

Historic drill roads and collapsed percussion drill collars in the CCN claim area are evidence of past 

drilling for which no records can be found.  We estimate that at least 20 holes were drilled.  Air photo 

evidence demonstrates this work to have been conducted prior to 1975.   

 

A portion of the Fisher Canyon property was drill-tested with a reconnaissance-scale drilling program by 

Evolving Gold conducted in December 2007.  The program consisted of 971 meters (3,186 feet) of 

reverse-circulation percussion ("RC") drilling in 13 holes, ranging from 40 meters (130 feet) to 137 

meters (450 feet) in depth.  The holes were grouped within a single target area along the north side of 

Cow Canyon (Figure 11.1).  The distance from the northernmost hole to the southernmost hole was 

approximately 500 meters (1,640 feet).   

 

Drilling was conducted by Diversified Drilling of Missoula, Montana, using a Foremost Prospector 

W750 articulated buggy drill.  This equipment was selected to reduce the environmental footprint of the 

drilling activity.  This, in turn, facilitated permitting and site reclamation.   

 

According to Evolving Gold (2008), all holes penetrated a sequence of marly shale and basalt and 

terminated in a footwall crystalline limestone.  Twelve of the 13 drill holes encountered gold values 

ranging from 0.1 to 4.14 g Au/t over the individual 1.52-meter (five-foot) sample intervals.  The 

anomalous gold values were generally associated with elevated values of arsenic.  Evolving Gold 

suggested that the gold tenor in the drilling appeared to increase to the east in the drill holes, providing a 

possible vector for follow-up drilling.

NV Gold has access to all data from this drilling program, including lithology chip trays. 

 

It is worth noting that the area of Evolving Gold drilling was largely selected for reasons of accessibility.  

Other areas with surface geochemical enrichment on the property were not drilled for considerations of 

time and effort.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

12.1 Rock Geochemical Samples 

 

Rock-chip samples were collected by Evolving Gold geologists, North American Exploration personnel, 

and Mr. Christensen in the three sampling programs discussed in this report.  Sample sites were chosen 

by geologists in the field based upon their experience and visual observations.  Sampled outcrops were 

often those that showed some evidence of hydrothermal alteration.  Surface contamination – vegetation, 

soil, weathering crusts, etc. – was removed from the outcrop.  Numerous small rock chips – about the 

size of a walnut – were aggregated to form one sample of about one kilogram.  Samples were collected 

in clearly labeled cloth sample bags and secured with ties.  Field locations were noted by GPS 

coordinates, and sample sites were marked in the field with aluminum tags.  Samples were transported 

by geologists to a storage location in Lovelock and later to the ALS Chemex Laboratories ("Chemex") 

sample preparation facility.  Field notes documenting the geologists' observations are contained within 

the sample database.   

12.2 Soil Geochemical Samples 

 

Soil samples were collected by North American Exploration personnel and Mr. Christensen.  Samples 

were collected at predetermined grid sites, located in the field using hand-held GPS instruments with an 

estimated horizontal accuracy of 3-5 meters.  Samples were collected from the base of the "B" soil 

horizon, where this could be determined, or from an average depth of about 25 centimeters (10 inches).  

Samples were placed in cloth sample bags, organized in the field, and secured in polypropylene rice 

bags for transport by geologists to the Chemex laboratory in Reno, Nevada.   

12.3 Reverse-Circulation Drill Samples 

 

All drilling at the Fisher Canyon property was dry RC drilling.  Sample returns from the drill string were 

settled from the high-velocity air stream in a cyclone.  Cyclone discharge was split through a riffle 

splitter to recover approximately two kilograms.  One assay sample was collected for each 1.52-meter 

(five-foot) drill interval.  Samples were collected in labeled plastic bags, secured with ties, and 

transported by the geologists to a secure storage location in Lovelock.  A total of 637 samples were 

collected during the drilling program.  A smaller sample of drill chips was collected from the splitter 

discard in a kitchen strainer, washed, and retained as a lithologic sample in a plastic chip tray.   

 

Personnel involved with the drilling relate that there was significant loss of dust from the cyclone, 

creating a dust cloud and perhaps introducing some loss of sample representativity.   

 

Samples were submitted to the Chemex sample preparation facility in Elko, Nevada.  Evolving Gold 

inserted Certified Reference Standard pulps and blanks into the sample submittal lots for quality control 

purposes at a rate of about one quality-control sample for every 20 drill samples.  The standards and 

blanks were acquired from Minerals Exploration and Environmental Geochemistry ("MEG") of Reno, 

Nevada, and consisted of rhyolite blank material and synthetic standards with gold values of 0.2, 2.0, 

and 6.0 g Au/t.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

13.1 Rock Samples 

 

Rock-chip samples from all three rock geochemical programs were prepared and analyzed by Chemex.  

Rock samples from Evolving Gold were prepared in the Chemex sample preparation facility in Elko, 

Nevada, while the samples collected by North American Exploration and Mr. Christensen were prepared 

by the Chemex facility in Reno, Nevada.  Samples were received, inventoried, and coded by Chemex.  

Samples were crushed to 70% passing 2mm or better, split to 250 grams using a riffle splitter, and 

pulverized to 85% passing 75μm (200 mesh).  Gold was determined by 30-gram fire assay with ICP-

AES finish (Chemex method Au-ICP21).  The nominal detection limit for this method is one ppb Au.  

All samples were also analyzed for a trace-level multielement suite using an aqua regia digestion 

(Chemex method ME-ME41).  Elements determined include: Al, Ag, As, Au, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, 

Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ge, Hf, Hg, In, I, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nb, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Re, S, Sb, Sc, Se, 

Sn, Sr, Ta, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn, Zr, Dy, Er, Eu, Gd, Ho, Lu, Nd, Pr, Sm, Tb, Tm, and Yb.   

 

Although some base metals may dissolve quantitatively with the aqua regia digestion, in the majority of 

geological matrices, data reported by an aqua regia digestion may not yield the total concentration of a 

particular analyte in the sample.  The recovery percentages for many analytes from more resistive 

minerals can be very low.  However, the aqua-regia-leachable portion can also be an excellent 

exploration guide.   

 

The suite of rock samples submitted by Mr. Christensen included several blank and standard samples 

(standards from CDN Resource Laboratories).  Analytical results for these standards were within 

expected ranges.   

 

Analytical results for 2009 sampling programs were received by NV Gold and Mr. Christensen in 

electronic format directly from the laboratory. 

13.2 Soil Samples 

 

Soil samples for both soil geochemical programs were prepared and analyzed by Chemex in Reno, 

Nevada.  Soil samples were logged into the laboratory, dried, weighed, and sieved at -180 microns (-80 

mesh).  Both sieve fractions were retained, and the fine fraction was further split for analysis.   

 

Gold in the soil samples was determined on a 15-gram aliquot with aqua regia extraction and ICP-AES 

finish.  A 51-element suite was determined by combination ICP-AES and ICP-MS on a five-gram 

aliquot with aqua regia digestion.   

 

Analytical results were received by NV Gold and Mr. Christensen in electronic format directly from the 

laboratory.

13.3 Drill Samples 

 

Drill samples were transported by Evolving Gold to the Chemex facility in Elko, Nevada.  Samples were 

received, inventoried, and coded by Chemex.  Samples were crushed to 70% passing 2mm or better, 

split using a riffle splitter, and pulverized to 85% passing 75μm or better.  Analysis was for gold only by 

30-gram fire assay with ICP-AES finish.  The nominal detection limit for the method is one ppb Au.   

 

Evolving Gold inserted 30 Certified Reference Standard pulps for quality control with the drill samples 

delivered to Chemex.  These MEG standards included rhyolite blank material and synthetic standards 

with gold values of 0.2, 2.0, and 6.0 g Au/t.   

 

The authors of this report have reviewed the results for the standard determinations reported by Chemex.  

Overall, the Chemex results are about 5% low (Figure 13.1).  At the gold concentrations present in the 

Fisher Canyon drill samples, however, the laboratory results are satisfactory.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

Evolving Gold provided NV Gold with digital copies of all laboratory Certificates of Analysis for all 

rock-chip and drill-cutting analyses.  The authors have verified that the values contained within the 

digital database are consistent with those reported by the laboratory.  Evolving Gold included adequate 

quality control procedures during the drill test of the Fisher Canyon property, as discussed in the 

previous section, although future drilling programs should include additional quality control measures 

(e.g., coarse blank material, field duplicates, pulp duplicates, third-party check assaying).  The location 

of all of the Evolving Gold drill holes were verified in the field. 

 

Analytical results for the 2009 rock and soil geochemical programs were delivered from the laboratory 

in electronic format to both NV Gold and Mr. Christensen.   

 

The procedures involved in the rock and soil geochemical programs and drill testing of the Fisher 

Canyon property were appropriate and appropriately executed.  A representative selection of the rock 

chip and soil sample sites were verified, and analytical results from samples collected by the authors is 

consistent with the grades of the sampling reported herein. 

 

There were no limitations on the verification process implemented by the authors.

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 

The authors are unaware of any active exploration being undertaken on properties immediately adjacent 

to Fisher Canyon.   

 

Field evidence suggests that there has been historic prospecting and drilling on the Fisher Canyon 

property.  The authors have been unable to ascertain the intent and persons or companies responsible for 

this work.  The age of vegetation on the disturbed areas indicates that this past exploration was 

undertaken at least 25 years ago.

19.0 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

The Fisher Canyon gold exploration property of NV Gold is located on the southeastern end of the 

Humboldt Range in the Antelope Springs mining district, Pershing County, Nevada.  This area has been 

prospected intensively in the past for antimony and mercury, but apparently has not been subjected to 

extensive modern gold exploration.   

 

The Humboldt Range can be described as exhibiting a generally antiformal structure, with a core of 

Permian-Triassic Koipato Group metavolcanic rocks surrounded by overlying Triassic strata dipping 

away from this core on both sides of the range.  Strata within the Fisher Canyon prospect include Prida 

Formation clastic and carbonate strata overlain by the Augusta Mountain and Cane Spring formations 

with dominant limestone, dolomite, and impure limestone.  Occurring within the Augusta Mountain 

Formation are kilometer-scale lenses of basalt flows and volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks.  These 

volcaniclastic units appear to be the most favorable hosts for gold enrichment at Fisher Canyon.  

Faulting within the project area has disrupted this overall geologic setting, creating potential mineral-

feeding and mineral-trapping structures.   

 

Rock and soil geochemistry over the claim area reveal anomalous concentrations of gold and pathfinder 

elements, especially arsenic.  Map patterns of geochemical distributions are similar for soils and rocks 

and define several areas for exploration focus.  Critical examination of the rocks reveals alteration 

characteristic of Carlin-type gold systems, including carbonate dissolution, argillization, silicification, 

and iron-oxide staining (from oxidation of finely disseminated pyrite).  First-stage RC drilling by 

Evolving Gold, concentrated within a limited prospect area, demonstrated the presence of gold 

enrichment in 12 of 13 shallow holes.   

 

The known geology, hydrothermal alteration, and mineralization styles at Fisher Canyon suggest 

potential for discovery of sedimentary-rock-hosted disseminated Carlin-type gold mineralization.   

 

Fisher Canyon is an early-stage exploration property.  Positive attributes include: 

 the project setting within an historic mining district, with a several historic and active precious 
metal mines nearby; 

 favorable stratigraphy known to host gold mineralization in a number of deposits within the 
Humboldt Range; 

 anomalous concentrations of gold, silver, and pathfinder elements in soil and rock chip samples 
over an area of several square miles; 

 recognized subtle alteration of a style characteristic of Carlin-type gold mineralization; 

 anomalous gold intercepts from a first-phase exploration drilling program; 

 a prospect with these favorable attributes that has not been intensively explored; and 

 a favorable location within a favorable state (Nevada) for exploration and mining.   
 

The caution to match this encouragement is the observation that gold exploration always has long odds 

of success, regardless of the location and the attractiveness of the target.

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

The Fisher Canyon gold exploration property represents a property of merit that warrants continued 

exploration.  Encouraging results have been obtained from rock and soil geochemical sampling and first-

stage exploration drilling, which have encountered concentrations of gold and pathfinder elements in 

hydrothermally altered favorable host rocks.   

 

The authors recommend that NV Gold proceed with a systematic exploration program.  Exploration 

should proceed with staged information gathering to develop an understanding of the geologic 

architecture of the property and the geochemical enrichment patterns, in order to define and prioritize 

prospects for more detailed investigation and drill testing.    

 

The first step is to extract the maximum amount of knowledge from the information already available 

for the property.  NV Gold geologists should reexamine the Evolving Gold drill cuttings to confirm the 

earlier observations and calibrate their eyes to the character of mineralized rock.  The multielement rock 

and soil data undoubtedly contain additional clues to the underlying geology and hydrothermal alteration 

to be discovered by critical spatial and statistical evaluation.   

 

The only existing geologic maps of the area are the 1959 and 1969 USGS maps of the Buffalo Mountain 

quadrangle, completed to illustrate the geologic framework of a large area and not designed for mineral 

exploration (Wallace et al., 1959; 1969).  NV Gold should commission an experienced geologist(s) to 

complete a project-scale geologic map of the area.  Mapping should be particularly focused on the 

structure and distribution of alteration.  Mapping should be done on the high-resolution satellite image 

of the property at a scale of 1:5000.  More detailed mapping may later be warranted within specific 

prospect areas.   

 

Rock and soil geochemical work completed to date have been focused on the areas with the most 

visually obvious alteration.  For reasons of economy, NV Gold limited this work to approximately one-

third of the property area.  It is recognized that the extent of alteration and geochemical enrichment is 

larger than the area currently covered by systematic geochemical work.  Geochemical sample grids 

should be extended to cover the larger prospective area.   

 

Geological mapping and soil geochemistry will highlight and constrain specific areas warranting drill 

testing.  For this exploration stage, drill testing should be conducted using RC drilling to maximize the 

number of holes and footage tested while recovering large sample volumes.  RC drilling is the most 

cost-effective and rapid drilling method at this stage of exploration.  NV Gold has designed and is 

permitting such a drilling program.  The location of planned holes is shown on Figure 20.1.

September 22, 2009 10/12/09 8:46 AM 

A recommended first-stage exploration budget for the Fisher Canyon property includes the following: 

 

 Geologic mapping at 1:5000 ("project-level detail") by experienced geologist(s) emphasizing 
structure and alteration:   USD$25,000 

 Rock-chip geochemical analysis: 100 samples @ $57:  USD$5700 

 Soil geochemical survey covering three square kilometers at 50 x 100 meters: 600 samples @ 
$20 collection + $57 analysis:  USD$46,000 

 RC drilling: 30 holes @ 300 feet with supervision and analysis:  USD$480,000 
 

These figures can be adjusted to accommodate the objectives and capabilities of the company and 

should be modified as knowledge of the property grows.  A prudent exploration program conducted with 

funding on the order of USD$550,000 would substantially improve understanding of the economic 

mineral potential of the Fisher Canyon property and provide a drill test of the highest-priority targets.
