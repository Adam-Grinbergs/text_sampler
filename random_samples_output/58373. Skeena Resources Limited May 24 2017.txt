SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

1 SUMMARY 

1.1 Issuer 

This technical report has been prepared at the request of the issuer, Skeena Resources Ltd. (the 

"Company") that is incorporated in British Columbia, Canada ("B.C.").  The Company has its 

offices at Vancouver, B.C., and it is listed on Tier 1 of the TSX-V (trading symbol: SKE).  The 

Company is focused on developing three projects located in the Golden Triangle of northwest 

B.C., including the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au project that is the subject of this technical report. 

1.2 Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

The Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au project area (the "Project Area") comprises a combination of the 

properties that the Company previously reported as the Spectrum property or project and the GJ 

property or project.  The amalgamation of the two properties reflects the Company's plan to jointly 

exploit mineralization contained in the Central Zone located on the Spectrum claims block (the 

"Central Zone") and the Donnelly deposit located on the GJ claims block (the "Donnelly 

Deposit").  The two deposits of interest are approximately 14 km apart. 

The Project Area is located in the Liard Mining Division within the Stikine River region of 

northwest B.C., approximately 200 km north of Stewart, B.C.  It comprises 99 mineral claims that 

cover a total of 42,825.736  ha, centred on Latitude 57º 39' 21" North and Longitude 130º 15' 41" 

West.  The Company holds a 100% interest in 96 of the claims, which cover the entirety of the 

project areas of interest, and a 50% interest in the three claims of the Nuttlude Group that cover an 

area of 1,298.811 ha, or approximately 3% of the Project Area.  The balance of interest (50%) in 

the Nuttlude Group is held by Colorado Resources Ltd.   

Project development to date includes: exploration drilling, data verification and Mineral Resource 

estimation for both deposits of interest; and completion of a preliminary economic assessment 

("PEA").  The PEA encompasses openpit mining on the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit, with 

metallurgical processing at a single, central plant.  The principal product will be a bulk Cu-Au-

(Ag) concentrate; a gravity gold concentrate will be produced in the first five years followed by 

doré gold-silver for the remaining project life. 

A phased approach to project development was adopted for purposes of the PEA, following 

preliminary analyses of potential project development options.  The results identified the benefits 

of a combined operation designed to limit operational, technical and capital risks that are typical 

of greenfield mine start-ups.  Production starts at 10,000 tpd at Donnelly Pit, ramping up to 20,000 

tpd in Year 6 when Spectrum Pit (exploiting the Central Zone) comes on-line, and reaching 30,000 

tpd in Year 12.  The overall planned project life is 25 years, inclusive of two years of processing 

stockpiled marginal grade material at the end of the planned mine life, at a rate of 30,000 tpd. 

1.3 This Technical Report 

This technical report has been prepared with the purpose of providing National Instrument ("NI") 

43-101 disclosures of the Company's 2017 Mineral Resource updates for the Central Zone and the 

Donnelly Deposit, and the results of the PEA outlined above.  Details of exploration drilling and 

data verification to January 06, 2017 are provided (i.e. to the effective date for the Mineral 

Resource updates presented herein), along with details of: the 2017 Mineral Resource updates; 

completed metallurgical testwork; mine design, planning and scheduling; preliminary process 

designs; project infrastructure planning; cost and price assumptions; marketing plans; risks and

opportunities; pre- and post-tax cashflow modelling; and financial outcomes, including sensitivity 

analyses. 

1.4 First Nations Involvement 

The Spectrum-GJ project lies within the asserted traditional territory of the Tahltan Nation.  The 

Company has committed to work closely with the Tahltan Central Government, with its agencies 

and with Tahltan Nation-owned businesses to identify and maximize employment and contracting 

opportunities arising from its mineral exploration and project development activities.  To this end, 

the Company and the Tahltan Central Government (the "Parties") have signed a Communications 

Agreement that provides a framework for the sharing of information and for joint participation in 

communications with Tahltan membership and communities regarding the Company's activities 

in Tahltan Territory (see the Company news release dated January 24, 2017). 

1.5 2017 Mineral Resource Updates 

The Mineral Resources that are the subject of this Technical Report (Table 1.1) were prepared in 

accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum standards on Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves (2014), by application of cut-off grades that incorporate cost and 

process recovery parameters.  The estimate for the Central Zone is based on 164 diamond drillholes 

(88 completed by the Company) totalling 34,597.54 m and 22,581 assay intervals.  The estimate 

for the Donnelly Deposit is based on 176 diamond drillholes (eight completed by the Company) 

totalling 48,325.27 m and 16,410 assay intervals.  The estimated Mineral Resources are 

constrained to pit shells based on commodity prices, metallurgical recoveries and operating costs.  

Long-term metal prices of US$2.75/lb Cu, US$1,250/oz Au and US$17.75/oz Ag were applied, 

along with metallurgical recovery rates of 90% for copper, 73% for gold and 50% for silver (i.e. 

the projected, long-term recovery rates established by means of metallurgical testing).  The stated 

Mineral Resources have an effective date of January 06, 2017.

Basis of Estimate 

QP Thomas reviewed the Company's QA/QC programs on the Mineral Resources data.  After removing samples with data 

quality issues, the QP concludes that the collar, survey, assay, and lithology data are adequate to support Mineral 

Resources estimation. 

Domains were modelled in 3D to separate mineralized rock types from surrounding waste rock.  The domains were 

modelled based on a combination of lithology, copper grades and gold grades.  

Raw drillhole assays were composited to 4 m lengths broken at domain boundaries.  Capping of high grades was considered 

necessary and was completed for each domain on assays prior to compositing. 

Block grades for gold and silver were estimated from the composites using an ordinary kriging interpolation method into 

4 m x 4 m x 4 m blocks for Central Zone, and into 10 m x 10 m x 8 m blocks for the Donnelly Deposit.

Dry bulk density varies by domain.  The dry bulk densities are based on 858 specific gravity measurements for Central 

Zone and 1,316 measurements for the Donnelly Deposit. 

Blocks were classified as Indicated and Inferred in accordance with CIM Definition Standards, 2014.  

For Central Zone, the results of a comparison with the previous Mineral Resource model, a drillhole spacing study and 

conditional simulation of gold grades were used to support the classification of Indicated Mineral Resources (Indicated 

Mineral Resources are classified on the basis of blocks falling within a drillhole spacing of 40 m x 40 m).  Inferred Mineral 

Resources are classified on the basis of blocks falling within a drillhole spacing which varied by domain - for Domains 2 

and 3 a spacing of 150 m was used and for Domains 4 and 5 a drillhole spacing of 75 m was used. 

For the Donnelly Deposit, Indicated Mineral Resources are classified on the basis of blocks falling within a drillhole 

spacing of 75 m.  Inferred Mineral Resources are classified using a drillhole spacing of approximately 150 m. 

The Mineral Resource estimate is constrained within optimized pits with average slope angles of 45°.  Metal prices of 

US$1,250/oz Au, US$2.75/lb Cu and US$17.75/oz Ag were used along with metallurgical recovery rates of 90% for copper, 

73% for gold and 50% for silver and the estimated on-site operating costs. 

Cautionary Notes 

The contained copper, gold and silver values shown on Table 1.1 are in situ.  No assurance can be given that the estimated 

quantities will be produced.  All values have been rounded to reflect accuracy and to comply with securities regulatory 

requirements.  Summations within the tables may not agree due to rounding. 

Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of Mineral 

Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or other 

relevant issues. 

The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are conceptual in nature.  There has been 

insufficient exploration to define these resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if 

further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral resource category. 

Minimum Grade Cut-off  

Minimum grade cut-offs for the Mineral Resource estimates were determined using the metal prices, metallurgical recovery 

rates and operating costs as outlined above, as well as smelter terms and applicable royalties applied to the following 

formula, the result of which is multiplied by 31.1035 to yield a precious metal cut-off but divided by 2,204.62 (assuming the 

metric system) and then multiplied by 100 to yield a base metal cut-off:  

  Xc = [(Mm - Mw) + (Po - Pw) + (Oo - Ow)] / {[r · (V – R)] · (1 – Gr)} 

where: 

Mm = the all-in unit cost of mining and delivering one ton of material to the primary crusher  

Mw = the unit cost of mining, transporting and dumping one ton of waste on the waste dump  

Po = the unit cost of processing one ton of material (from primary crushing to production of a final, saleable product, 

inclusive of supervision and labour costs, consumables) 

Pw = the unit cost of processing one ton of waste (inclusive of labour costs and consumables associated with avoiding 

 potential water contamination and/or acid generation, as well as to satisfy any other applicable regulatory and 

  environmental requirements) 

Oo = on-site general and administrative costs ("G&A") 

Ow = the unit cost of the additional on-site G&A associated with processing one ton of waste 

r = recovery, or % of valuable product recovered on processing the mined material to a final saleable product 

V = the value of one unit of the final saleable product 

R = smelting, refining, transportation and other costs incurred per unit of final saleable product 

Gr = payable net smelter return royalty (percent) 

Grade Equivalence 

Grade equivalence for the Mineral Resource estimates were determined using the metal prices and metallurgical recovery 

rates summarized above, as well as smelter terms applied to the following formula: 

AuEq = Au grade + [(Ag grade · (Ag revenue / Au revenue)] + [Cu grade · (Cu revenue / Au revenue)] 

CuEq = (Cu grade + [(Au grade · (Au revenue / Cu revenue)] + [Ag grade · (Ag revenue / Cu revenue)] 

where: 

Au revenue = (1 / 31.1035) · Au plant recovery · Au smelter recovery · Au refinery recovery · unit Au price 

Ag revenue = (1 / 31.1035) · Ag plant recovery · Ag smelter recovery · Ag refinery recovery · unit Ag price 

Cu revenue = 2,204.62 · 0.01 · Cu plant recovery · Cu smelter recovery · Cu refinery recovery · unit Cu price

1.6 Preliminary Economic Assessment 

Figure 1.1 shows the general layout of the planned infrastructure for the Spectrum-GJ Au-Cu 

Project, as well as the locations of the planned openpits.  The main infrastructure area is where all 

the major infrastructure elements will be located, including the camp, central processing plant and 

main maintenance facilities.  Standard truck and shovel openpit mining is planned.  Production 

from Spectrum Pit has been limited to 5,000 tpd, for the reasons described in Section 16.  Upside 

potential exists, both in terms of project longevity and the assumed production rates, the former 

by exploiting mineralization contiguous to both planned pits and the latter by means of trade-off 

and optimization studies that are planned for completion during the pre-feasibility study stage.  

Selective underground mining beneath the completed pits might also be possible, to extract known 

higher-/high-grade areas. 

Table 1.2 provides a summary of the key inputs and outputs of and for the planned, 25 year life-

of-mine project.  Table 1.3 summarizes the cash costs and all-in costs per payable pound of copper 

and per payable Troy ounce of gold, net of by-product credits.  Figures 1.2 through 1.4 summarize 

the quantities of payable metal by production year.

1.6.1 Environmental Design Principles 

Even at this preliminary design stage, significant effort has been expended to integrate 

environmental design principles into the project layout and operating concept. This 

approach aims to limit adverse impacts to biophysical, economic, pre-existing land use and 

heritage & cultural environments within the Project Area.  The following were achieved 

within the scope of the PEA: 

 to the extent that is possible and practicable, infrastructure is located in one drainage 
basin (the only exceptions include portions of the site access road and powerline, a 

security gate and a take-off sub-station from the Northwest Transmission Line); 

 viewscape values – to the extent that is practicable and sustainable, planning kept 
infrastructure visibility to a minimum; 

 footprint values - to the extent that is possible, safe and practicable, existing 
infrastructure within the project area was utilized; 

 wildlife conservation - off-pit muck handling systems have been planned to limit 
potentially adverse wildlife interactions, especially on Klastline Plateau on which the 

Donnelly Pit is located; 

 project consolidation - a single, consolidated, life-of-of mine tailings storage facility 
has been identified and planned, the maximum capacity of which could accommodate 

additional tailings generated from expanded Spectrum and Donnelly openpits; 

 archaeology & heritage – infrastructure planning encompasses considerations of 
identified archaeological and heritage resources, future project planning includes 

continued evaluations and the modification of infrastructure layouts that might 

reasonably be required; and 

 design for closure - to the extent that is practicable, the project has been designed for 
closure and to minimize the risk of post-closure active management. 

1.6.2 Metallurgy and Processing 

The PEA process design and metallurgical forecast are based on a metallurgical testwork 

program conducted in late 2016 and Q1, 2017.  Bond Ball Mill Work Index tests indicate 

an average Work Index for the Central Zone composites of 18.4 kWh/t and 19.8 kWh/t for 

Donnelly Deposit composites.  The results reflect moderately hard material that is quite 

close to the median hardness levels for the B.C. copper-gold industry. 

A series of conventional gravity, flotation and cyanidation tests were completed.  The 

results show that the optimum grind size is P80 120 microns and that a commercially viable 

bulk Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate could be produced, along with gold-silver rich doré. 

Consideration of project economics resulted in the deferment of the CIL plant and doré 

recovery circuit to Year 6, prior to which a gravity gold concentrate is produced and sold. 

Owing to its far greater tonnage contribution to the plant feed mix, metallurgy is mainly 

dictated by material from Donnelly.  Consequently, to align with the PEA mine production 

schedule, metallurgical performance was projected for plant feed comprising 100% 

Donnelly material during Stages 1 and 3, and for co-mingled plant feed containing 75% 

Donnelly material and 25% Spectrum material during Stage 2.  Table 1.4 summarizes the

metallurgical forecast by production stage.  The overall average, life-of-project 

metallurgical recovery rates are 72.3% Au, 57.1% Ag and 89.2% Cu.

A ramp-up in throughput on start-up has been assumed, with a target of 80% of nameplate 

throughput being achieved in Production Year 1.  In reality, all selected major equipment 

is rated to achieve throughput rates slightly higher than those projected in both Stage 1 

(10,000 tpd) and Stage 2 (20,000 tpd, including 5,000 tpd from Spectrum Pit).  A ramp-up 

in recoveries has also been assumed on start-up, based on published, post-start up 

performance numbers for a selection of operating B.C. copper mines. 

The as-designed process flow is essentially the same as many copper-gold circuits currently 

operating in B.C.  Figure 1.5 summarizes the Stage 3 (30,000 tpd) process flow.  The main 

product will be a bulk Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate that PEA planning assumes will be shipped 

to smelters located in the Far East.  Tailings will be deposited in an adjacent, life-of-mine 

tailings storage facility with an estimated maximum capacity of 375 Mt ± 35 Mt.

Two small departures from common convention are included in the process flow.  The first 

is driven by the need to design a processing facility capable of milling at three different 

throughput rates, defined as Stages 1 through 3.  This has led to the use of the larger ball 

mill to act as a primary mill during Stage 1 (10,000 tpd), receiving feed from two stages of 

crushing. While currently unusual, such a circuit was widely used in the mining industry 

throughout most of the last century.  This potentially reduces the project's technical risk 

by allowing the mine to operate prior to purchasing the semi-autogenous grinding ("SAG") 

mill, which in turn allows for more extensive sampling of the active pit and more careful 

checking of SAG mill sizing than would be otherwise be possible. 

The second departure is the use of CIL processing of pyrite-rich products arising from the 

flotation circuit, which products have been demonstrated to be amenable to leaching.  The 

CIL process involves: tailings from the copper rougher float being subjected to bulk 

sulphide flotation; and the bulk sulphide concentrate being combined with the copper 

cleaner tails, thickened and leached in a small CIL circuit to recover gold and silver.  The 

carbon is treated at site to extract the gold (and minor silver), which is smelted and sold as 

doré.  This approach yields a non-acid generating bulk tailings which is beneficial for the 

operation and ultimate closure of the tailings facility. 

1.6.3 Capital Costs 

Table 1.5 provides a summary of the estimated capital costs for the planned Spectrum-GJ 

project; Figure 1.6 summarizes the capital expenditures by production year.  The amounts 

include contingencies that reflect the level of uncertainty of the estimate: 15% 

contingencies have been applied to those estimates based on vendor or contractor quotes 

or on InfoMine's 2016 CostMine models; whereas 25% contingencies have been applied 

where experience-based and bench-marked estimates are used.

It should be emphasized that the low pre-production capital requirement (C$216.05 

million) reflects one of the benefits of the phased approach adopted as regards project 

development: significant capital can be and has been deferred to the benefit of project 

economics.  This has in part been achieved through the PEA planning process that 

encompasses considerations of the types of practical, physical and operational risks that 

are inherent to any new, start-up operation (a wealth of global mining experience shows 

that lengthy lead times are invariably required before such risks can be overcome and 

optimal results can routinely and sustainably be achieved, especially with greenfield 

projects).  In combination, these and related issues form a central objective of the PEA: to 

engineer solutions that ensure practicably achievable and environmentally sustainable 

outcomes. 

1.6.4 Operating Costs 

Operating costs have been estimated in Q1, 2017 US dollars and do not include allowances

1.7 Conclusions and Recommendations 

In the opinion of the Principal Author (Qualified Person Stephen Godden, C. Eng.), the financial 

outcomes of the PEA that is the subject of this technical report reflect a robust project that should 

be advanced to the pre-feasibility level of project development.   Various risks and opportunities 

are identified in Section 25, based on the results of the PEA studies reported in this technical report.  

Mitigation of the risks and assessment of the opportunities form the basis for the pre-feasibility 

study surveys and studies recommended in Section 26, the objectives of which are to capture 

necessary baseline data, to resolve various technical and operational issues, and to optimize 

production throughputs, recovery rates and the life of project.  Additional drilling is also 

recommended to define Indicated and Measured Mineral Resources within the ultimate pit shells. 

The project undoubtedly benefits from existing infrastructure that includes Highway 37 and the 

Northwest Transmission Line located to the immediate east of the Project Area, as well as an 

industrial road that extends to within approximately 10 km of the planned location of the central 

processing plant (approximate straightline distance).  The proximity of the Port of Stewart also 

enhances the project, insofar as it is an established deep water port from where the planned, bulk 

Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate could be shipped to markets located in the Far East.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

2 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Issuer 

This Technical Report has been prepared at the request of the issuer, Skeena Resources Limited 

(the "Company") that is incorporated in British Columbia, Canada ("B.C.").  The Company's 

corporate head office is at Suite 650, 1021 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, B.C. and it is listed 

on Tier 1 of the Venture Exchange of the Toronto Stock Exchange, with the trading symbol SKE. 

The Company is focused on developing three projects located in the Golden Triangle region of 

northwest B.C.: 

 evaluation and development of the Spectrum-GJ Copper-Gold project that is the subject of this 
Technical Report; 

 exploration on the past-producing Snip gold mine, which was optioned from Barrick Gold 
Corporation ("Barrick") (see the Company's news release dated March 23, 2016); and 

 exploration on the past-producing Porter Idaho silver mine, acquired from Mount Rainy Silver 
Inc., in which the Company holds a 100% interest (see the Company's news releases dated 

August 10, 2016 and September 23, 2016). 

Under the terms of the option agreement with Barrick (the "Agreement") and subject to TSX 

Venture Exchange approval, the Company will acquire a 100% interest in the Snip property when 

the following conditions have been met: 

 issuance to Barrick of up to 3,250,000 common shares of the Company (of which 2,000,000 
shares have been issued; the balance [1,250,000 shares] will be issued once all other conditions 

of the option agreement have been met); 

 a work commitment by the Company of C$500,000 within the first 12 months of the 
Agreement (complete – on January 24, 2017, the Company provided Barrick with notice of 

approximately C$3.0 million spending on the Snip property); and 

 an additional work commitment by the Company of C$1,500,000 within 30 months of the 
Agreement. 

Barrick retained a 1.0% net smelter return ("NSR") royalty interest on commercial production 

from the Snip property.  Subject to exercise of the option and to the Company delineating in excess 

of 2.0 Moz of gold, Barrick may exercise a back-in right to purchase a 51% interest in the property 

in return for a payment of three times the Company's cumulative expenditures, following which 

the parties will form a joint venture. 

In addition to the above and by virtue of acquiring all of the issued and outstanding common shares 

of Sona Resources Corporation ("Sona", see the Company news releases dated June 29, 2016 and 

September 09, 2016 and September 15, 2016): 

 the Company holds a 100% interest in the past-producing Blackdome gold mine and its related 
infrastructure ("Blackdome"), located in the Clinton Mining District of southwest B.C.; and 

 the Company has an option to acquire a 100% interest in the Elizabeth gold property located 
in the Lillooet Mining District of southwest B.C.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

The Company's interest in the Elizabeth gold property stems from its proximity to Blackdome (the 

historical workings are approximately 30 km apart), hence the potential for a combined 

Blackdome-Elizabeth operation, with processing taking place at the Blackdome processing plant. 

2.2 Spectrum-GJ Copper-Gold Project 

The Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au project area (the "Project Area") comprises a combination of the 

properties that the Company previously reported as the Spectrum property or project and the GJ 

property or project (for example, see the technical reports referenced in Section 2.5).   The Project 

Area is located in the Liard Mining Division within the Stikine River region of northwest B.C., 

approximately 200 km north of Stewart, B.C. (straightline distance).  It comprises 99 mineral 

claims that cover a total of 43,518.849 ha in a single, contiguous block centred on Latitude 57º 39' 

21" North and Longitude 130º 15' 41" West, which is the approximate centre point of the planned 

Donnelly openpit (see Section 16 for details of mine planning). 

The Company acquired a 100% interest in ten of the mineral claims that comprise the portion of 

the Project Area called the Spectrum claims block during October 2014, following completion of 

the terms of an acquisition agreement with Eilat Exploration Ltd. (see Sub-Section 6.2.9 and the 

Company news release dated October 27, 2014).  One additional claim was staked by the Company 

on December 14, 2017, thereby completing the Spectrum claims block detailed in this Technical 

Report (see Sub-Section 4.3.1). 

The Company also holds a 100% interest in 85 of the mineral claims that comprise the portion of 

the Project Area called the GJ claims block, and a 50% interest in the remaining three mineral 

claims of the Nuttlude Group that completes the Project Area: 

 80 of the GJ property mineral claims were transferred under option to the Company on 
November 03, 2015 (see the Company's news release dated November 04, 2015), contingent 

on completion of the terms of an October 05, 2015 Asset Purchase Agreement between Teck 

Resources Limited ("Teck"), its 49% joint venture partner NGEx Resources Inc. and the 

Company (see Sub-Section 4.3.2 and the Company's news release dated October 27, 2014); 

 five of the GJ Property mineral claims were staked either by the Company or on behalf of the 
Company (see Sub-Section 4.3.2); and 

 the balance of interest (50%) in the three mineral claims that comprise the Nuttlude Group is 
held by Colorado Resources Ltd., from which the Company acquired its interest (see Sub-

Section 4.3.3). 

The three, non-contiguous claims of the Nuttlude Group cover an area of 1,298.811 ha, or 

approximately 3% of the Project Area.  The Company acquired the claims to make the Spectrum 

and GJ claim blocks contiguous, for the purpose of mineral tenure assessment work filing, and to 

provide mineral tenure coverage over the full length of possible access routes to the Spectrum 

claims block area. 

2.3 Terms of Reference 

The amalgamation of the Spectrum and GJ claims blocks into a single, contiguous Project Area 

reflects the Company's plan to jointly exploit mineralization contained in the Central zone located 

on the Spectrum claims block (the "Spectrum Central Zone" or "Central Zone") and the Donnelly

deposit located on the GJ claims block (the "Donnelly Deposit").  Mining by openpit methods is 

planned, with run-of-mine ("ROM") feed processed at a single plant facility located centrally 

between the two planned openpits. 

2.3.1 Approach 

A phased approach to project development was adopted for purposes of the preliminary 

economic assessment that is the subject of this Technical Report (the "PEA").  It was 

adopted following preliminary analyses, by the Company, of potential project development 

options that identified the benefits of a combined operation designed to limit operational, 

technical and capital risks by: 

 limiting early mine production to achievable and sustainable levels; 

 scheduling production from the two deposits to optimize early cashflows; and 

 phasing capital expenditures by employing either a modular or progressive approach 
(as appropriate) to the development of plant throughput capacities, production fleet size 

and camp capacity in particular. 

The alternatives – the development and construction of separate operations or the 

development of openpit mines with production capabilities sufficient to fill an ultimate 

capacity plant early in the project life – were considered inappropriate.  The principal 

reasons include: 

 the much increased personnel, infrastructure, support facilities and equipment 
requirements (hence costs) that two separate operations would require, despite their 

close proximity (the straightline distance between the two deposits is approximately 14 

km); and/or 

 the pre-production lead time and substantial capital that the construction of an 
ultimate/maximum capacity plant and related infrastructure would require; coupled 

with 

 the technical and operational risks inherent to any new, start-up operation (a wealth of 
global mining experience shows that lengthy lead times are invariably required before 

such risks can be overcome and optimal results can routinely and sustainably be 

achieved, especially with greenfield projects). 

2.3.2 Objectives 

The principal objectives of the PEA were to engineer solutions that, to the extent possible 

within the scope of the PEA and the timeline available for its completion (approximately 

six months): 

 reflect the benefits of economies-of-scale realized through the joint exploitation of the 
Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit; 

 encompass safety considerations; 

 consider practical, physical and operational constraints, thereby to ensure practicably 
achievable and environmentally sustainable outcomes;

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 encompass and address Tahltan First Nation concerns; and 

 exceed minimum study requirements for preliminary economic assessments. 

2.3.3 Tahltan First Nation 

The Company recognizes and respects the fact that the Project Area lies within the asserted 

traditional territory of the Tahltan First Nation.  The Company continues to work closely 

with the Tahltan Central Government and its agencies as regards its exploration activities 

on and development plans for the Project Area.  The scope of the Company's commitments, 

agreements and interactions with the Tahltan First Nation are discussed in Section 4.9. 

2.3.4 Study Scope and Outcomes 

A preliminary economic assessment is defined in NI 43-101 (Section 1.1) as 'a study, other 

than a pre-feasibility or feasibility study, that includes an economic analysis of the 

potential viability of mineral resources'.  In the opinion of the principal author of this 

Technical Report (Qualified Person Stephen Godden, C. Eng., the "Principal Author"), this 

may be interpreted to mean a study intended to demonstrate that the economics of a mining 

project are sufficiently robust (or not) to advance the project to the pre-feasibility stage (or 

not). 

In the Companion Policy (43-101CP) to NI 43-101, it is further stated that 'A preliminary 

economic assessment might be based on measured, indicated, or inferred mineral 

resources, or a combination of any of these'.  Inferred Mineral Resources are used within 

the scope of the PEA reported herein, by definition they are defined by virtue of geological 

evidence that is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity.  

In other words, the quantities and grades of Inferred Mineral Resources are conceptual in 

nature.  Uncertainty therefore exists as to whether additional exploration would result in 

the upgrading of Inferred Mineral Resources into the Indicated or Measured Mineral 

Resource categories. 

Accuracy in cost estimation is advanced by the Association for the Advancement of Cost 

Engineering ("AACE"), which is a recognized and world-renowned organization that the 

industry looks to for guidance in defining the accuracy of estimates.  Guidance is provided 

by AACE's system of five classes of cost estimate, where Class 1 is the most accurate and 

Class 5 the least accurate.  It is AACE's system that has been applied within the scope of 

the PEA. 

Particular effort was expended within the scope of the PEA when considering the key study 

outcomes of infrastructure planning, mine planning, production scheduling and mineral 

processing.  The objective in each case was to ensure outcomes that exceed the minimum 

requirements of a preliminary economic assessment, inclusive of cost estimation accuracy.  

In the Principal Author's opinion, this study objective has been achieved.  Despite this and 

for the reasons outlined above, the PEA outcomes are neither final nor definitive and they 

should be considered as such.  Additional technical studies are required and various trade-

off studies are recommended, for consideration at the pre-feasibility study stage, before an 

elevated level of confidence could be placed in the financial results.  The required and 

recommended studies are summarized in Section 26.

3 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

The Principal Author relied almost entirely on information derived from work completed by the 

authors of published data sources, Company staff members and Company consultants.  Although 

the Principal Author has reviewed much of the available data and has visited the Project Area, 

these tasks only validate a portion of the entire dataset.  The Principal Author has made judgements 

about the general reliability of the underlying data that is assumed to be both accurate and valid, 

based on the professional status of the reports' authors and the nature of their reports. 

Details of the mineral claims that comprise the Project Area are based on information sourced from 

B.C. Mineral Titles Online ("MTO") and supplied by the Company.  The claims information was 

cross-checked by reference to information contained on the MTO website (www. 

mtonline.gov.bc.ca).  No attempt was made by the Principal Author to verify legal ownership of, 

or title to, the various claims that comprise the Project Area, although a letter dated March 09, 

2015 from Vector Corporate Finance Lawyers, relating to legal title of the Spectrum claims block, 

was reviewed. 

Signed copies of the various inter-company agreements relating to the Company's acquisition of 

the blocks or groups of mineral claims that comprise the Project Area were seen by the Principal 

Author.  They were used to compile the agreement-related information contained in parts of 

Sections 4 and 6 of this Technical Report.  The Principal Author is not, however, qualified to 

assess the validity of the agreements or the information contained therein. 

The QP for Sections 4.7, 4.8 and 20 (John Brodie, P. Eng.) has made no attempt to verify or assess 

environmental issues or liabilities on the Project Area.  When compiling Sections 4.7, 4.8 and 20 

of this Technical Report, the QP instead relied on information contained in: 

 the Company's year-end reports to the B.C. Ministry of Energy and Mines referenced in 
Section 2.5; and 

 the Greenwood Report that is also referenced in Section 2.5.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The Principal Author is responsible for the following Sections 4.1 through 4.6 and Section 4.9.  

The QP for Sections 4.7 and 4.8 is John Brodie, P. Eng. ("QP Brodie").  The text was compiled 

from various internal Company documents, from observations made during the Principal Author's 

site visits, from information contained in the Greenwood Report referenced in Section 2.5 and 

from information contained in the April 2016 and May 2016 Technical Reports.  Past information 

was updated only when it was relevant to do so and/or when it was clear that additional information 

was required. 

4.1 Property Area and Location 

The Spectrum-GJ property is a combination of the previously reported Spectrum and GJ properties 

and projects, as described in the May 2016 Technical Report for the Spectrum property and the 

April 2016 Technical Report for the GJ property.  Six claims were added in 2016 to the previously 

reported mineral claims that now form a single contiguous block that herein is called the Project 

Area. 

Figures 4.1 and 4.2 are regional and area location plans, respectively, for the Project Area that is 

located in the Liard Mining Division within the Stikine River region of northwest B.C.  The 

location point for the Project Area (the notional centre point) is at Latitude 57º 39' 21" North and 

Longitude 130º 15' 41" West, which is the approximate centre of the planned Donnelly Pit that, 

by road, is approximately 300 km north of Stewart, B.C.  It may be seen that the Project Area 

covers a significant part of Klastline Plateau to the east; to the south it extends to the junction of 

the Iskut and Little Iskut rivers.  The western boundary adjoins Mount Edziza Provincial Park (see 

Sub-Section 4.2.2).  The Project Area as a whole falls within the asserted traditional territory of 

the Tahltan Nation (see Section 4.9). 

4.2 Mineral Tenures 

The Project Area comprises 99 contiguous mineral claims covering 43,518.849 ha on B.C. 

government claim map sheets 104G048, 104G049, 104G059, 104G060, 104G068, 104G069, 

104G070, 104G078, 104G079 and 104G080.  Seventeen of the claims are of the four-post located 

variety (now referred to as legacy claims), while the remaining 82 mineral claims are of the cell 

variety that are located online using the MTO system.  The boundaries of individual legacy claims 

have not been surveyed, but the co-ordinates of a number of legal corner posts have been 

established by the Company, using Differential Global Positioning System ("DGPS") technology. 

The identifying numbers, names, issue dates, expiry dates (the "good-to dates") and areas for each 

of the 99 mineral claims are listed by claims block on Table 4.1, which is in two parts due to its 

overall length.  Figure 4.3 is a generalized mineral tenure plan that shows the boundary of the 

Project Area and the distribution of claims contained therein.  To facilitate legibility, the overall 

area is split into a North Block and a South Block on Figures 4.4 and 4.5, respectively.  It is on 

these figures that the individual mineral claims listed on Table 4.1 are identified.

As part of as wider due diligence process undertaken by the Principal Author, details of the 

Company's overall claim area were analyzed and reviewed.  This led to: 

 removal of errors concerning the areas of the 17 four-post located ("legacy") mineral claims 
(see Section 4.2.1); 

 removal of the overlaps between various cell-based MTO mineral claims and the boundary of 
Mount Edziza Provincial Park, resulting in adjustments to the boundary of the Project Area, 

hence an adjustment to the overall area in which project development activities can (and will) 

take place (see Sub-Section 4.2.2); and 

 staking, during December 2016, of three additional claims that are identified in Section 4.3. 

4.2.1 Individual Claim Areas 

The adjusted claim areas stated on Table 4.1 were defined by the Company using ArcGIS 

geometry calculations in B.C. ALBERS projection, the latter being the standard projection 

used by the B.C. government.  The calculated areas of all the cell-type claims are the same 

as those stated on the MTO system.  However, the calculated areas for the 17 legacy 

mineral claims differ from those stated on the MTO system: legacy claims are defined from 

unsurveyed physical claim posts, so the areas are only estimated.  The calculated areas of 

the 17 legacy mineral claims are detailed on Table 4.2.  It may be concluded that if the 

MTO mineral claim areas were used, the Project Area would comprise 43,549.177 ha rather 

than the 43,518.849 ha defined by the areas stated on Table 4.1 (it is the latter value 

[43,518.849 ha] that is stated above and in Section 2.2).

4.2.2 Claims Block Boundary 

It may be seen on Figure 4.3 that the boundaries of the claims around the Spectrum claims 

block, the boundary of the Designated Access Corridor, a portion of the western boundary 

of the North Block of the GJ claims block and various claims of the Nuttlude Group 

(highlighted by RED cross-hatching on Figures 4.3 through 4.5) differ from the defined, 

overall Project Area boundary.  This is because the claims defined on the MTO system

overlap the boundary of Mount Edziza Provincial Park and/or the Mount Edziza Protected 

Area (the Designated Access Corridor). 

Individual claims comprise up to 100 complete or partial adjoining cells that are not 

adjusted to reflect the boundaries of areas such as parks.  However, it is stated in the 

Mineral Tenure Act Regulation 'B.C. Reg. 529/2004' (the "MTA Regulation") that 'Parks, 

Protected Areas, Ecological Reserves and Conservancies are considered Alienated Land'.  

In Section 1 (Definitions) of the MTA Regulation, Alienated Land is defined as: 

'(a)  land in a park established under an Act of British Columbia or Canada; 

(a.1) land in a conservancy established under an Act of British Columbia; 

(b) an ecological reserve established under an Act of British Columbia or Canada; 

(c) an area in which mining activity is prohibited under the Park Act or under an order 

     under the Environment and Land Use Act; or 

(d) Indian reserve land'. 

In Section 4 (Registrations of New Claims) of the MTA Regulation it states under Point 

(2) that 'No mineral or placer rights in respect of alienated land are acquired by 

registering a cell claim under this section'.  It is for this reason that the boundary of the 

mineral claims comprising the Project Area has been adjusted on Figure 4.3 to adjoin the 

boundary of Mount Edziza Provincial Park, not overlap it.  The MTA Regulations can be 

located at http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/529_2004).   

The mineral claims that are subject to the boundary adjustment are listed on Table 4.3 on 

which, for purposes of comparison, the claim areas, determined by means of ArcGIS 

geometry calculations in B.C. ALBERS projection, are also detailed.  It may be seen that 

the adjustments reduce the total Project Area from 43,518.849 ha, as defined by the 

individual claim boundaries (and adjusted to preclude overlaps), to 42,825.736 ha, as 

defined by the adjusted, overall claims area boundary, per Figure 4.3.  It is the latter area

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

4.3 Tenure Ownership 

The registered, 100% owner of 96 of the Project Area claims is the Company.  The remaining three 

claims (Nutt 6, GJ Key and GJ Key 2, which together form the Nuttlude Group) are 50% owned 

by the Company and 50% owned by Colorado Resources Ltd., pursuant to a Purchase Agreement 

between the Company and Colorado dated November 03, 2016 (see Sub-Section 4.3.3). 

4.3.1 Spectrum Claims Block 

The 11 contiguous mineral claims that comprise the Spectrum claims block (3,685.150 ha, 

adjusted to 3,226.143 ha for the reasons described in Sub-Section 4.2.2) are listed at the 

top of Table 4.1.  All but one of the 11 mineral claims were held at different times by 

different companies (see Section 6.1).  The exception (mineral claim 1048411 called Sliver 

2 and comprising 17.304 ha) was staked by the Company on December 14, 2016, to 

consolidate the overall claim boundary in the area of the Designated Access Corridor 

described in Sub-Section 4.9.3. 

4.3.2 GJ Claims Block 

The 85 contiguous mineral claims that comprise the GJ claims block (38,534.888 ha, 

adjusted to 38,428.390 ha for the reasons described in Sub-Section 4.2.2) form the bulk of 

the claims listed on Table 4.1.  The registered, 100% owner of all 85 claims is the 

Company.  Eighty of the mineral claims that comprise the GJ claims block were transferred 

to the Company on November 03, 2015, contingent on completion of the terms of an 

October 05, 2015, Asset Purchase Agreement between Teck, NGEx and the Company (see 

the Company's news release dated October 27, 2014).  Under this Agreement, the 

Company may purchase a 100% interest in the North and Remaining claims (Figures 4.6 

and 4.7), subject to royalties described in Section 4.5, by making the following payments 

to Teck and NGEx and in proportions that reflect their joint venture agreement (Teck 51%, 

NGEx 49% - see the Company's news release dated October 27, 2014): 

 C$1,500,000 payable on closing, with C$500,000 payable in cash and C$1,000,000 

payable by the issuance of Company shares to the Sellers with a market value of 

C$1,000,000 (paid); and 

 on or before the date that is 24 months from the closing date, C$1,500,000 payable by 

the issuance of Company Shares to the Sellers with a market value of C$1,500,000; 

and 

 on or before the date that is 60 months from the closing date, C$1,500,000 payable by 

the issuance of Company Shares to the Sellers with a market value of C$1,500,000; 

and 

 on or before the date that is within 45 days of the commercial production date, 

C$4,000,000 in cash. 

An additional three mineral claims were acquired on behalf of the Company by Mr. M. S. 

Cathro, P. Geo., on October 29, 2015 (mineral claim numbers 1039624 called Kakiddi, 

1039625 called Kiddi and 1039626).  All three mineral claims were transferred to the 

Company on November 08, 2015.  Mineral claim 1047873 (called Sliver 1) was acquired 

by the Company on November 15, 2016, to consolidate a thin sliver of land that was not 

covered by the adjacent claims.  Mineral claim 1048397 (called Fork in the Road) was

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

acquired by the Company on December 13, 2016, to consolidate the area of the planned 

Northwest Transmission Line take-off sub-station, as well as to provide lay-down areas for 

mine site powerline construction. 

4.3.3 Nuttlude Group 

The three mineral claims that comprise the Nuttlude Group (mineral claim 603611 called 

Nutt 6, 1039785 called GJ Key and 1044199 called GJ Key 2, totaling 1,298.811 ha and 

adjusted to 1,181.204 ha for the reasons described in Sub-Section 4.2.2) are listed at the 

base of Table 4.1.  Their locations are identified by RED cross-hatching on Figures 4.3 

through 4.5.  Pursuant to the terms of a purchase agreement between Colorado Resources 

Limited ("Colorado") and the Company, dated November 03, 2016, the Company acquired 

a 50% interest in the Nuttlude property claims by paying Colorado a total of C$5,000. 

4.4 Surface Rights 

Surface rights are not specifically included as part of the Project Area.  However, mineral claims 

located in B.C. are administered by the B.C. Ministry of Energy and Mines, according to the 

Mineral Tenure Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act").  It is through the 1996 Act that a mineral title holder 

is granted the right to use the surface of the held claim or claims for the exploration and 

development or production of minerals and all operations related to the business of mining.  In the 

opinion of the Principal Author, there is no readily identifiable reason to suppose that surface rights 

across the Project Area will be constrained in any way. 

4.5 Royalties 

To the Principal Author's best knowledge and understanding, no outstanding compensation 

agreements are in place as regards the Project Area, other than those relating to the GJ claims 

block, as specified in an Asset Purchase Agreement between Teck, NGEx and the Company (see 

Section 4.3.2). 

4.5.1 Spectrum Claims Block 

NSR royalties on all but two mineral claims of the Spectrum claims block amount to 1.75%.  

The two exceptions are mineral claim numbers 1039623 (called NUT) and 1048411 (called 

Sliver 2) to which no royalties apply.  The 1.75% NSR royalty comprises a combination of 

the royalties held by Sandstorm Gold Limited (1.65%), Troon Ventures Limited (0.05%), 

International Northair Mines Limited (0.03%) and Silver Standard Resources Incorporated 

(0.02%). 

4.5.2 GJ Claims Block  

Figures 4.6 and 4.7 are mineral claims plans for the North Block (Figure 4.6) and South 

Block (Figure 4.7) portions of the Project Area, as earlier outlined.  They summarize the 

applicable royalty types by mineral claim.  It may be seen that in a few cases no royalties 

apply to the mineral claims that comprise the GJ claims block, but that in the majority of 

cases royalties are payable to different entities.  In summary and as regards royalties, the 

GJ claims block may be described as comprising six distinct parts: 

 a total of five mineral claims to which no royalty applies (mineral claim numbers 
1039624, 1039625, 1039626, 1047873 and 1048397);

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 a total of one legacy claim (mineral claim number 413153) and 65 MTO, cell-type 
claims (called Remaining Claims on Figures 4.6 and 4.7), including those claims 

covering the Donnelly Deposit, to which a 2% NSR royalty applies, in favour of Teck 

and NGEx. (1% [or half] of the NSR royalty on the Remaining Claims can be bought 

back at any time for C$2.0 million, paid in proportions that reflect their joint venture 

agreement (Teck 51%, NGEx 49%); 

 a total of six legacy claims, which were – 

o originally held by 650399 BC Ltd. and which were subject to a previous agreement 
that includes an underlying NSR royalty in favour of the successor to 650399 BC 

Ltd., and 

o variously converted by NGEx into MTO cell-type claims (mineral claim numbers 
508187, 508121, a portion of 507681 and a fraction of 511073 of the Remaining 

Claims group) and to which an NSR royalty applies, in favour of Teck, NGEx and 

the successor to 650399 BC Ltd.; 

 14 legacy claims (called North Claims on Figures 4.6 and 4.7) that were included in 
the same previous agreement noted above and to which the same underlying NSR 

royalty applies, in favour of Teck, NGEx and the successor to 650399 BC Ltd.; 

 an underlying 1% NSR royalty is held in favour of the successor of 650399 BC Ltd., 
on the area shown by red cross-hatching on Figure 4.7; and 

 a 1% NSR royalty in favour of Teck and NGEx exists on the North Claims shown on 
Figure 4.7. 0.5% (or half) of the NSR royalty on the North Claims can be bought back 

at any time for a payment of C$1 million, paid in proportions that reflect their joint 

venture agreement (Teck 51%, NGEx 49%). 

For the year ended December 31, 2016, AuRico Metals Inc. ("AuRico") reported that on 

November 10, 2016, it completed an acquisition from NGEx of a 0.98% NSR on what 

Aurico calls the GJ Northern Block (described above as the Remaining Claims) and a 

0.49% NSR royalty on the GJ Northern Block property (described above as the North 

Block), respectively.  The project owner has the right to buy-back half of one or both 

royalties (see http://www.auricometals.ca/royalties/GJ-Royalty/default.aspx).

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

4.5.3 650399 BC Limited  

650399 BC Limited was a numbered company that was a wholly owned subsidiary of 

SpectrumGold Inc., which in turn was controlled by NovaGold Resources Inc.  Its 

emergence as a holder of an NSR royalty starts with the staking in 1975 and 1976 of the 

first mineral claims (GJ, Spike #1 and Spike #2, to cover what is now known as the GJ 

Zone) that made up part of the present GJ claims block.  The claims were subsequently 

acquired (in the early 1980s) by Curator Resources Ltd. ("Curator"), which became 

International Curator Resources Ltd. ("International Curator") in October 1985 and 

subsequently Canadian Gold Hunter Corp. ("CGH") in December 2003. 

In 2000, International Curator added to its holdings by staking the DJ and BJ claims west 

and northwest of the GJ claim to cover the Donnelly target.  Further increases in the claims 

area were realized when:  

 the OJ claim was staked to the north to cover approximately 75% of what is now called 
the North or Camp Zone; 

 the JJ claim was staked (in 2003) immediately east of the GJ and Spike #2 claims, to 
cover the eastward projection of the GJ Zone; 

 the LJ claim was staked (in 2004) immediately west of the BJ and DJ claims, to cover 
the westward projection of the Donnelly Zone; and 

 the KJ was staked (in 2004) approximately 8 km to the north-northwest to cover a 
possible south-westward extension of the QC porphyry target. 

Growing interest in the area was further reflected in March, 2002 when Viceroy Resource 

Corporation ("Viceroy") staked 27 claims (13,200 ha) to the north and north-east of 

International Curator's holdings, effectively covering the remaining portion of Klastline 

Plateau.  A few months later (in May 2002) Viceroy granted an option to Consolidated 

Earth Stewards Inc. ("CEW") of Kelowna B.C. to earn a 100% interest in the property by 

making various share capital payments and by granting Viceroy a 1% NSR on production 

from any of the 27 mineral claims (i.e. not to any of the ground covered by the original 

Curator claims or claims subsequently acquired by CGH).  CEW retained an option to pay 

Viceroy C$500,000 to buy back one-half of the NSR, over an option term of 25 years. 

As part of a corporate reorganization, CEW subsequently changed its name to Royal 

County Minerals Corp. ("Royal County").  Approval from the TSX Venture Exchange for 

the Viceroy agreement was received in January, 2003 and the first 100,000 share payment 

was made.  Later in 2003, Viceroy was reorganized into a number of different companies, 

with the underlying ownership of the 27 claims on Klastline Plateau ultimately being 

transferred to 650399 BC Ltd.  

On August 4th, 2003, International Curator and Royal County merged into a single entity 

on the basis of one share of Royal County for every five shares of International Curator.  

The resulting company retained the name International Curator Resources Ltd. 

In December, 2003, International Curator underwent a corporate re-organization and share 

consolidation, again on the basis of one new share for five old shares.  At the same time 

the company changed its name to CGH.  As a result of the merger with Royal County and 

subsequent 5:1 rollback in CGH, an outstanding (January 2004) payment of 100,000 shares

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

of Royal County stock to 650399 BC Ltd. was converted to 80,000 shares of CGH stock.  

On January 21, 2005, CGH made the final 80,000 share payment to 650399 BC Ltd. to 

acquire a full 100% interest in the property, subject to the 1% NSR in favour of 650399 

BC Ltd.  As of 31 December 2014, 650399 BC Ltd. became Alexco Keno Hill Mining 

Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexco Resource Corporation. 

4.5.4 Nuttlude Group 

To the Principal Author's best knowledge and understanding, no royalties are payable in 

respect of commercial production from any of the three mineral claims comprising the 

Nuttlude property. 

4.6 Other Encumbrances 

To the Principal Author's best knowledge and understanding, the only encumbrances, other than 

the royalties described above, that apply to the Project Area relate to claims maintenance fees and 

government taxes.  These are described below. 

4.6.1 Claims Maintenance 

To maintain a mineral claim, the holder must, on or before the good-to date, either:  

a) perform, or have performed, exploration and development work on that claim and 
register such work online; or 

b) register a payment instead of exploration and development work (cash in lieu). 

Failure to maintain a claim results in automatic forfeiture at the end (midnight) of the expiry 

date.  No notice of forfeiture is provided to the claim holder, prior to forfeiture.  All claim 

assessment requirements were reset to the first year when assessment fees were changed in 

2012 (B.C. Regulation 89/2012).  The new assessment work requirements are:  

 C$5.00 per hectare for Anniversary Years 1 and 2; 

 C$10.00 per hectare for Anniversary Years 3 and 4; 

 C$15.00 per hectare for Anniversary Years 5 and 6; and 

 C$20.00 per hectare for subsequent anniversary years. 

At the time of writing (February 2017), according to information sourced online at 

www.mtonline.gov.bc.ca, all of the 99 claims listed on Table 4.1 were in good order.  In 

the case of 96 of the 99 mineral claims that comprise the Project Area, the good-to dates 

extend to at least March 17, 2026.  The three exceptions are those staked by the Company, 

using the MTO system, late in 2016 (mineral claims 1047873 called Sliver 1, 1048411 

called Sliver 2 and 1048397 called Fork in the Road), which have good-to dates in late 

2017.  The Company has advised the Principal Author that the good-to dates for these 

mineral claims will be amended, in accordance with the 1996 Act, when Statements of 

Work for the 2017 exploration season are filed.  It is anticipated that the good-to dates for 

the three mineral claims outlined will, at that time, be extended to 2026.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

4.6.2 Government Taxes 

Neither provincial nor federal royalties are levied on metallic mines located in 

B.C.  However, B.C.'s Mineral Tax Act defines two taxes that are applicable specifically 

to mining operations in the province: Net Current Proceeds Tax ("NCP tax"); and Net 

Revenue Tax.  NCP tax is levied at 2% of the gross revenue of an operation, less non-

capital reclamation costs and operating expenses excluding rental costs, exploration costs, 

capital costs and pre-production development costs.  NCP tax is fully creditable against 

Net Revenue Tax that is levied at 13% and which applies to net current proceeds of an 

operation, minus rental costs, exploration costs, capital costs and pre-production 

development costs. 

In addition to the B.C. mining tax system, the Canadian corporate income tax system 

imposes profit-based taxes on mining operations.  A combined federal and provincial 

income tax rate of 26% is expected to apply to net taxable income from the Spectrum-GJ 

project.  B.C. mineral taxes are deductible from income that is subject to federal and 

provincial income tax. 

4.7 Existing Environmental Liabilities 

The following text was compiled from information contained in the Company's 2015 and 2016 

year-end, Annual Summary of Exploration Activities reports (for the Spectrum-GJ property) to the 

B.C. Ministry of Energy and Mines. 

To the best of the QP Brodie's knowledge and understanding, no production facilities have ever 

been established on the Project Area.  Such environmental liabilities that may exist are believed to 

be related in general to either forestry activities and/or historical exploration, hence small-scale 

trenching, drillpad construction, trail construction and the provisioning of various exploration 

camp sites.  In addition, historical exploration activity on the Spectrum claims block included the 

completion of approximately 313.5 m of exploration drifts and related exploration development 

on the Hawk Vein, as described in Section 6. 

4.7.1 Spectrum Claims Block 

As insurance against future environmental liabilities under its mineral exploration permit, 

the Company posted a C$90,000 bond with the B.C. government before commencing field 

work in 2015.  A further C$23,000 was posted prior to commencement of the 2016 

exploration program, thereby bringing the total amount to the required C$113,000 level 

(see Sub-Section 4.8.2). 

During the Company's 2015 exploration program Company personnel cleaned-up and 

burned all of the camp materials, a small amount of garbage and all the drilling platform 

timbers left by previous operators.  All six drillpads from the Company's 2014 drilling 

program were dismantled, cleaned-up and re-contoured, along with 52 of the 58 drillpads 

constructed during the 2015 season.  Four helicopter pads constructed during 2015 were 

left in place for use in 2016. 

During the Company's 2016 exploration program the previously utilized Mountain 

Exploration Camp (Figure 4.8) was reclaimed and a new exploration camp (called Valley 

Exploration Camp, Figure 4.9) was established.  On completion of their intended use, the 

following surface disturbances were also cleaned up and re-contoured: five of the 

remaining 2015 drillpads; the four helicopter pads constructed in 2015; 23 of the 24

drillpads built during the 2016 exploration season and two of the four helicopter pads built 

during 2016.  The Company has advised QP Brodie that the remaining one 2015 drillpad 

and one 2016 drillpad, along with the remaining two helicopter pads, will be dismantled, 

cleaned-up and re-contoured following completion of work at the site.

4.7.2 GJ Claims Block 

Following its acquisition of the GJ property, Company personnel winterized the then-

existing exploration camp (Figure 4.10) and completed brushing of and minor repairs to 

the Willow Creek Forest Service Road (the "Willow Creek Road"), which affords access 

to more-or-less the geographic centre of the Project Area (see Section 5.3).  As insurance 

against future environmental liabilities under its mineral exploration permit, the Company 

posted a C$103,000 with the B.C. government before commencing field work in 2016, 

which is the total required amount (see Sub-Section 4.8.3). 

During the 2016 field season, a staging area and small diesel fuel tank farm were 

established at the end of the Willow Creek Road, from which the Company's two Project 

Area exploration camps are supported by helicopter.  A portion of the then existing 

exploration camp was reclaimed and the remaining, helicopter-supported portion was 

utilized.  Eight drillpads were built and, at the end of the 2016 season, reclaimed once 

drilling was completed.  The Company has advised QP Brodie that the 1.45 ha of historical, 

un-reclaimed surface disturbances, left by previous operators, will be reclaimed (cleaned-

up and re-contoured) following completion of work at the site.  Apart from the remaining 

exploration camp, the historical surface disturbances include temporary trails for drill 

access, a drillcore storage facility, drillpad clearing, trenching and diamond drilling.

4.7.3 Nuttlude Group 

To the best of QP Brodie's knowledge and understanding, no exploration activity has taken 

place on the Nuttlude Group of mineral claims.  No environmental liabilities are, therefore, 

believed to exist.

4.8 Required Permits 

The following text was compiled from information contained in various company documents, 

including the Company's 2015 and 2016 year-end, Annual Summary of Exploration Activities 

reports (for the Spectrum-GJ property) to the B.C. Ministry of Energy and Mines.  Reference was 

also made to the Greenwood Report referenced in Section 2.5. 

Exploration, development and mining on a mineral claim must be carried out in compliance with 

the 1996 Act, the Health Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in B.C. and other applicable 

legislation.  A Notice of Work and Reclamation ("NWR") must be filed with the Regional 

Inspector of Mines for any work that requires this under Section 10 of the 1996 Act.  No 

mechanical disturbance of the ground and no excavation work can be carried out on a claim or 

lease without valid authorization.   

4.8.1 Exploration Activity 

In addition to a 1996 Act permit, an Occupant License to Cut ("OLTC") from the B.C. 

Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations is required for the removal of 

up to 500 m3 of timber.  A Road Use Permit ("RUP") is required for Willow Creek Road. 

4.8.2 Current Status – Spectrum Claims Block 

Exploration activities by the Company to date on the Spectrum claims block has been 

carried out under Multi-Year, Area-Based ("MYAB") Permit Number MX1-813 for Mine 

Number 0100702.  It was issued to the Company on July 15, 2010; it is updated annually 

to reflect the following season's planned exploration activities.  The Company has also 

been issued an OLTC and a RUP for Willow Creek Road and, as earlier outlined, the 

Company has lodged a reclamation bond of C$113,000 with the B.C. Minister of Finance, 

which is the assessed amount required for reclamation of the exploration camp and drilling 

areas located on the Spectrum claims block.  

Permit Number MX1-813, relating to the Company's NWR and Reclamation dated April 

08, 2016, has been reviewed by QP Brodie.  It permits the following activities through 

March 31, 2019: 

 one 50 person camp and core logging facilities on the Spectrum claims block; 

 a staging area and bulk storage of fuel at the end of Willow Creek Road; 

 50 line kilometres of ground geophysical surveys (Induced Polarization or "IP"); 

 surface drilling on up to 150 helicopter-supported drill sites / pads; 

 excavation by hand and/or using a Candig mini-excavator of up to 50 small trenches; 

 re-opening of 6.0 km of an historic mountain trial and 1.0 km of trail construction; and 

 the cutting of up to 400 m3 of timber. 

According to the Company's analysis, as of the end of the 2016 exploration season: 

 the balance of the Spectrum OLTC allows for the cutting of an additional 366.2 m3 of 
timber; and

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 the balance of the Spectrum MYAB permit allows for 34.4 line kilometres of 
geophysical surveys, drilling at 62 sites, trenching at 50 sites (2,500 m), the re-opening 

of 6.0 km of an historic mountain trial and the construction of 1.0 km of trail. 

4.8.3 Current Status – GJ Claims Block 

MYAB Permit Number MX-1-613, first issued on April 01, 2004 and relating Mine 

Number 0100700 on the GJ claims block, was transferred from Teck to the Company on 

October 20th, 2015.  At the same time, a reclamation bond in the amount of C$103,000 

was posted by the Company with the B.C. Minister of Finance, to replace Teck's bond and 

to cover the estimated cost of reclamation of the exploration camp and drilling areas (per 

MYAB Permit Number MX-1-613).  Permit Number MX1-613, relating to the Company's 

NWR dated February 29, 2016, has been reviewed by QP Brodie.  It permits the following 

activities through March 31, 2021: 

 one 30 person camp and core logging facilities on the GJ claims block; 

 200 line kilometres of ground geophysical (IP) surveys, with no timber cutting; 

 surface drilling on up to 100 helicopter-supported drill sites / pads; 

 excavation by hand and/or using a Candig mini-excavator of up to 100 trenches or 
5,000 m of trenching; 

 the cutting of up to 50 m3 of timber per year. 

According to the Company's analysis, as of the end of the 2016 exploration season and 

apart from maintenance of an exploration camp and core logging facilities: 

 the balance of the GJ MYAB allowed for 200 line kilometres of ground geophysical 
(IP) surveys, with no timber cutting; 

 drilling at 92 helicopter-supported drill sites / pads; and 

 trenching at 100 sites (5,000 m). 

No timber cutting has taken place to date, not least because the area of exploration activity 

is above the tree line. 

4.8.4 Future Exploration Activities 

In the opinion of QP Brodie, the existing MYAB permits adequately cover the Company's 

short-term exploration plans for the Project Area.  The Company has advised QP Brodie 

that further annual amendments will be sought, as appropriate, to cover future exploration 

activities.  In QP Brodie's opinion, there is no readily identifiable reason to suppose that 

approvals for such amendments to the MYAB permits would not be secured. 

4.8.5 Future Project Development Activities 

The permit requirements, timelines and costs associated with project advancement through 

mine development to production and closure are discussed and described in Section 20.

4.9 Other Factors and Risks 

Excerpts from applicable resource and protected areas management plans were used to compile 

the following text, along with information contained in the August 2014, April 2016 and May 2016 

Technical Reports and the Greenwood Report that is referenced in Section 2.5. 

4.9.1 Applicable Resource and Protected Areas Management Plans 

The Project Area falls within the Cassiar Iskut-Stikine Land and Resource Management 

Plan ("CIS LRMP"; B.C. ILMB, 2000).  LRMPs are sub-regional, integrated resource 

plans that establish the framework for land use as well as resource management objectives 

and strategies.  The CIS LRMP (B.C. ILMB, 2000) was completed in October 2000, it 

encompasses an area of 5.2 million hectares that overlaps with the western portion of the 

Project Area (see also Sub-Section 4.9.2). 

The CIS LRMP acknowledges the mineral and energy resource potential within the plan 

area.  Under the plan, exploration and development of mineral deposits, as well as 

construction of access roads, are allowable activities outside of protected areas, providing 

they take place in full observance of relevant legislation.  The CIS LRMP designated the 

area of the Spectrum claims block (defined in the plan as 'a developed gold-copper 

prospect') as an Area-Specific Resource Management Zone called the Mount Edziza Zone. 

This zone is approximately 3,400 ha in size and includes specific objectives and strategies 

for distinct values including aquatic ecosystems and riparian habitat, recreation/tourism, 

visual quality, access management, mineral and energy resources and timber. The 

following abstracts are applicable to the Mount Edziza Zone: 

 'The intent of this zone is to promote a cooperative approach to managing mineral 
exploration, development and reclamation adjacent to a park.  While mineral 

development is currently allowed in this zone, the intent in the long term is for the area 

to become part of Mount Edziza Provincial Park.  To this end, any development in this 

zone should be undertaken in consideration of its eventual park status'; and 

 'This zone will be available for staking, mineral exploration, and mine development for 
a period of 20 years from the date of LRMP approval.  At the end of 20 years, if there 

are no mineral tenures in place, the zone will be added to Mount Edziza Provincial 

Park.  If there are tenures in place 20 years from plan approval, the zone will be added 

to the park once tenures lapse'. 

The mineral claims that comprise the Spectrum claims block were, in the 1990s, included 

within the Mount Edziza Recreation Area.  According to the Stikine Country Protected 

Areas Management Plan (2003) the Recreation Area status has been rescinded over the 

Spectrum claims block and the area is now designated as a Resource Management Zone.  

In this regard it is stated in the Stikine Country Protected Areas Management Plan (2003) 

that 'The Cassiar Iskut-Stikine Land and Resource Management Plan ("LRMP") also 

directed that a portion of Mount Edziza Provincial Park be converted to ELU Act protected 

area status to provide land access to mineral claims in the Mount Edziza Resource 

Management Zone (formerly the Mount Edziza Recreation Area) if required.  If a road 

corridor is established, the balance of the protected area will be returned to Class A park 

status' (non-staking reserve number 394436, called the Designated Access Corridor).

4.9.2 Mount Edziza Provincial Park Boundary 

It is established in Sub-Section 4.2.2 that three sides of the Spectrum claims block, portions 

of the western margin of the North Block of GJ claims block and portions of the Nuttlude 

Group of claims are bounded by Mount Edziza Provincial Park.  In the opinion of the 

Principal Author, this does not represent a significant factor or risk that will affect access, 

title or the right or ability to perform planned future work on the property, inclusive of 

openpit mining.  This is stated because: 

 the Project Area boundary has been adjusted such that it adjoins the boundary of Mount 
Edziza Provincial Park (i.e. it does not overlap it), per the discussions of Sub-Section 

4.2.2; 

 work, including openpit mining, is neither planned nor envisioned in areas immediately 
adjacent to the modified Project Area boundary (all project-related infrastructure and 

related activities have been planned such that they are as far away from the park 

boundary / the Project Area boundary as is practicably feasible); and 

 as previously pointed out by Lally (2012), other mines located in B.C. operate within, 
or close to, Provincial Parks without difficulty (for example and as cited by Lally, Myra 

Falls Mine on Vancouver Island produces 1.4 Mt of Zn-Cu-Au-Ag mineralized 

material annually and is surrounded by the Strathcona Provincial Park 

[http://www.infomine.com]). 

4.9.3 Access to the Spectrum Claims Block 

Figures 4.2 and 4.3 identify a Designated Access Corridor to the Spectrum claims block, 

which extends over Mount Edziza Provincial Park land immediately south of the local 

Project Area boundary.  The block of ground is designated as a Mount Edziza Protected 

Area under the Environmental Land Use Act and has a No Registration Reserve (#394436) 

under the Mineral Tenure Act.  It has been set aside for possible future access to the 

Spectrum claims block, per the CIS LRMP.  In the opinion of the Principal Author, this 

does not represent a significant factor or risk that will affect access, title or the right or 

ability to perform planned future work on the property, inclusive of openpit mining.  This 

is stated because the access corridor was established in line with the CIS LRMP.  No 

practicable alternative for accessing the Spectrum claims block to that described in Section 

18 exists and, in any event, the following are stated in the CIS LRMP (BC ILMB 2000) 

and Stikine Country Protected Area Management Plan (BC WLAP, 2003): 

 'Access Management -  Manage public use of any new access cooperatively between 
BC Parks and the responsible agencies in consideration of the park management plan 

for Mount Edziza Provincial Park'; (BC ILMB 2000; page 102) 

 'Recommend that permits for a road through Mount Edziza Provincial Park be issued 
in a timely manner in the event of mine development being approved in the Mount 

Edziza Resource Management Zone. For advanced mineral exploration e.g., bulk 

sampling, consider allowing roaded access through Mount Edziza Park where 

reasonable review determines that no practicable alternative exists. Any decision to 

put a road through the park should be accompanied by an appropriate public review 

process.' (BC ILMB 2000; page 102)

 'Where roaded access is required, plan road layout to minimize visual impacts from 
Nuttlude Lake (e.g. using forest screening).' (BC ILMB 2000; page 102) 

 'Work with the mining company and other land management agencies to minimize and 
mitigate impacts from access, mining exploration and mining activities on Mount 

Edziza Provincial Park and proposed Mount Edziza Protected Area values.' (BC 

WLAP 2003, page 106) 

 'Install a gate on any road into and through the proposed Mount Edziza Protected 
Area. Deactivate the road after use associated with mining ends.' (BC WLAP 2003, 

page 106). 

It is further stated in the Stikine Country Protected Area Management Plan (BC WLAP, 

2003) that if a road corridor is established and finalized, the balance of the access corridor 

will be upgraded to Class A Provincial Park and amalgamated into the Mount Edziza 

Provincial Park.  The Principal Author has confirmed that the Company is aware of this 

requirement.  However an easement totaling at least 25 m either side of the planned access 

road will be required for reasons of safety and to facilitate the location and construction of 

any future infrastructure that might include, but might not be limited to: 

 a covered, overland conveyor to transport ROM material from the Spectrum 

Infrastructure Area ("SIA") to the Main Infrastructure Area ("MIA") for processing at 

the planned, central plant facility; and 

 a powerline to supply electricity to the SIA. 

Within the scope of the PEA, infrastructure planning is limited to an 8.0 m wide access 

road (graded dirt comprising non-acid generating rock) and two new, related bridges 

described in Section 18.  This might in future change for the reasons described in Section 

16. 

4.9.4 General and Area-Specific Land Management Direction Components 

The CIS LRMP defines specific land and resource management objectives and includes 

three management categories: General Management Direction; Area-Specific 

Management; and Protected Area Management.  Objectives and strategies of the General 

Management Direction apply throughout the plan area, outside of Protected Areas, and 

include the following components: 

 'Biodiversity - Avoid disturbance of red- and blue-listed plants and plant communities 
when locating roads and mine infrastructure; 

 Wildlife - Avoid disruption of the mineral lick along Tennaya Creek' and 'Locate roads 
and mine infrastructure to minimize disruption of wildlife, in particular mountain goats 

during kidding season and the use of spring and summer range by mountain ungulates; 

 Aquatic Ecosystems and Riparian Habitat - Maintain water quality and fisheries 
values, including within the Nuttlude Lake chain and its tributaries;

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 Hunting, Trapping, Guide-Outfitting, Fishing' - as per the General Management 
Direction ("GMD") that requires 'Backcountry and frontcountry protected areas in the 

Cassiar Iskut-Stikine LRMP Planning Area and Boya Lake Provincial Park will be 

managed to conserve natural, cultural and outdoor recreation values; 

 Recreation/Tourism - Minimize potential to damage or destroy unique volcanic 
features (e.g. Pipe Organ Rock) during blasting; 

 Visual Quality - As per GMD' and 'where road access is required, plan road layout to 
minimize visual impacts from Nuttlude Lake (e.g., using forest screening); and 

 Timber - Minimize the harvesting of timber during mine development (e.g., only harvest 
timber where necessary to clear mine sites and access roads). Timber required for mine 

construction should be harvested from outside the zone'. 

The GMD components summarized above, along with Heritage and Archaeology (see Sub-

Section 4.9.10), have been considered within the scope of options analysis and related risk 

assessments for infrastructure planning for the Project Area (see Section 18). 

4.9.5 Wildlife 

Wildlife has been identified as an important environmental component for the Project Area 

and region, including the presence of large ungulates, grizzly bear and fur-bearers.  

Wildlife baseline studies on the Project Area have included: mountain ungulate summer 

aerial field study (Rescan, 2008); mountain ungulate winter aerial field study (RTEC, 

2012a); mountain ungulate management plan (Hemmera, 2015); and mountain ungulate 

flight management plan (RTEC, 2016a).  The studies found that significant populations of 

mountain goat and Stone's sheep appear to be distributed within the northern part of the 

study area, on Klastline Plateau, along with moose and a number of wolves (during the 

winter of 2012).  Additional details on the wildlife studies and other environment baseline 

programs that have been completed to date (March, 2017) are provided in Section 20.1. 

The Company respects and acknowledges the presence of wildlife on the Project Area and 

intends fully to ensure that its planned activities will incur the minimum practicable 

impacts on wildlife, within the Project Area.  To this end, the Company has developed and 

implemented an Ungulate Management Plan that includes designated flight paths for 

helicopter activity during exploration, as well as consideration of potential wildlife impacts 

as part of the planning process for Project Area infrastructure.  

4.9.6 Commercial Hunting and Guiding Rights 

The Company acknowledges that Kinaskan Lake Outfitters holds the commercial hunting 

and guiding rights for Klastline Plateau and the areas of the Donnelly Deposit and Central 

Zone.  As part of its work on the Project Area, the Company has verbally agreed to discuss 

its operations and mitigation of the potential effects of its activities on the Project Area on 

Kinaskan Lake Outfitters' operations.  In the opinion of the Principal Author, this does not 

represent a significant factor or risk that will affect access, title or the right or ability to 

perform planned future work on the property, inclusive of openpit mining, the areas of 

which will be secured to preclude potentially adverse human and wildlife interactions.

4.9.7 Aboriginal Land Claims, Rights and Title  

The Company recognizes and respects that the Project Area lies within the asserted 

traditional territory of the Tahltan Nation.  The Tahltan collectively hold rights to hunt, 

fish, trap and harvest berries and other food and medicinal plants throughout their asserted 

traditional territory.  As far as is known by the Company, the Tahltan Nation is the primary 

claimant of Aboriginal rights and title in the Project Area. 

Aboriginal Rights and Title is a complicated matter.  The following information is 

extracted from AME B.C. Aboriginal Engagement Guidebook (http://www.amebc.ca/ 

docs/default-source/AE-Guidebook/aboriginal-engagement-guidebook-(revised-may-

2015).pdf?sfvrsn=0).  It is provided for information purposes only and may, therefore, not 

be complete, accurate or current: 

'The provincial and federal governments have a duty to consult, and where appropriate, 

accommodate Aboriginal peoples whenever they consider a decision or activity could 

impact Aboriginal or treaty rights. This duty stems from Canadian common law as 

expressed in court decisions. While the Province of British Columbia (or the federal 

government, as appropriate) is ultimately responsible for ensuring adequate and 

appropriate consultation and accommodation, the government often requests and 

encourages the company to contribute to the consultation process by engaging with 

potentially affected Aboriginal communities. Aspects of the consultation process involves: 

 providing information about the proposed project to First Nations early in the planning 
process; 

 obtaining and discussing information about specific Aboriginal interests that may be 
impacted with First Nations; 

 considering modifications to plans to avoid or mitigate impacts to Aboriginal Interests;  

 documenting engagement, specific Aboriginal Interests that may be impacted, and any 
modifications to address concerns; and 

 providing this documentation to local Aboriginal groups and appropriate government 
agencies'. 

The Tahltan traditional territory encompasses approximately 93,500 km2 and the Tahltan 

population is estimated by the Tahltan Central Government ("TCG") to total  

approximately 5,000 people, of which an estimated 1,000 people live within the Tahltan 

traditional territory at three communities located at Dease Lake, Telegraph Creek and Iskut 

(see Section 5.2).  These communities rely primarily on the public sector and natural 

resource industries for economic opportunities (TNDC, 2007; ATCO Group, 2011). 

The Tahltan traditional territory is rich in mineral resources and as such, the Tahltan have 

a long history of cooperation with the mining and exploration sectors.  The Tahltan are also 

an important source of both skilled and semi-skilled labour.  The Tahltan Nation 

Development Corporation ("TNDC"), a local and regional employer, has been involved in 

mining, road construction, hydroelectric power generation, forestry, catering, custodial 

work, heavy construction, road development and transportation (TNDC, 2007; ATCO 

Group, 2011).  Mining projects with which TNDC has been involved have included the 

Snip, Eskay Creek, Red Chris and Golden Bear mines.

4.9.8 First Nations Land Use 

The Tahltan Nation people have historically traveled extensively throughout their territory, 

based on seasonal cycles of fishing and hunting, to collect obsidian and to trade with other 

native groups. Fishing is an important traditional activity for the Tahltan who have 

numerous fish-bearing river systems running through their territory. Wildlife species 

important to Tahltan traditional culture include moose, black bear, grizzly bear and 

mountain goat.  Caribou might traditionally have also been highly valued in some areas of 

the Tahltan territory.  Generally, wild game provides the bulk of the diet for Tahltan 

families.  Both hunting and fishing continue to be important subsistence activities.   

The Company understands and respects that Tahltan Nation land use in their traditional 

territory includes camping, subsistence fishing, hunting, access trails, plant and berry 

harvesting and trapping.  In this regard the Company understands and respects the fact that 

Tahltan members of local communities regularly hunt moose, caribou, sheep, goat and 

groundhog in the vicinity of the Project Area.  The Company further understands that 

Tahltan people are active users of the Stikine Country Protected Areas and are interested 

in commercial opportunities within the protected areas systems. 

4.9.9 First Nations Commitments and Agreements 

Tahltan governance is administered through the band system under the Federal Indian Act 

(1985), with an elected chief and council who oversee the daily social and economic affairs 

of the community.  The Tahltan Nation is comprised of two bands, the Iskut First Nation 

and the Tahltan Band (MARR 2008).  The TCG represents the two bands and is governed 

by an Executive Committee and a Board of Directors comprised of family representatives, 

with an Elders Advisory Council providing guidance. The Tahltan Heritage Resources 

Environmental Assessment Team ("THREAT") represents the TCG on matters related to 

consultation and engagement with resource development. 

In addition to the Company's environmental commitments stated above, the Company has 

committed to work closely with the TCG, with its agencies and with Tahltan Nation-owned 

businesses to identify and maximize employment and contracting opportunities arising 

from its mineral exploration and project development activities.  To this end the Company 

and the TCG (the "Parties") have signed a Communications Agreement (see the Company 

news release dated January 24, 2017), which provides: 

 guidance to the Parties for on-going discussions and engagement regarding the 
Company's projects in Tahltan Nation traditional territory; 

 a framework for the sharing of information and for joint participation of the Parties in 
communications with Tahltan Nation membership and communities regarding the 

Company's activities in the territory; and 

 the Company's on-going dialogue with THREAT ensures wildlife, environment and 
heritage values are readily identified and considered. 

4.9.10 Heritage and Archaeology 

The Heritage Conservation Act protects all archaeological sites, whether on provincial or 

private land, that predate AD 1846 (i.e. pre-contact).  Burial sites and rock art sites are 

protected, regardless of age.

Archaeological Overview Assessments 

In 2007, CGH contracted Rescan Tahltan Environmental Consultants ("RTEC") to 

complete an Archaeological Overview Assessment (the "AOA") of the area of the 

Donnelly Deposit.  The AOA consisted of several components including: background 

research on the Project Area; a field visit to assess archaeological potential of the terrain; 

compilation of the information to assess the potential for archaeological resources; and the 

development of recommendations for further work, if required.  No archaeological 

materials were located.  However, at the south end of the Project Area a deeply incised trail 

was observed, following along the edge of Klastline Plateau, immediately south of the 

proposed location for the exploration camp, from where it travels west along a rock outcrop 

before descending towards Kakiddi Lake (RTEC, 2007).  The top of the outcrop provides 

an excellent look-out over the plateau area, thereby providing a viewpoint to scout for game 

animals.  Additional research would be needed to confirm whether this was a trail created 

and/or used by people pre-contact. 

Archaeological Impact Assessments 

RTEC (2007) reported that there likely is a moderate to high archaeological potential in 

the Project Area and recommended that prior to any ground altering activities, an 

Archaeological Impact Assessment ("AIA") should be carried out, which was duly the case 

in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, the latter two years as part of the Company's due 

diligence prior to drilling or other ground disturbance during the Company's exploration 

programs. 

AIAs are carried out under a Section 14 Permit, pursuant to the Heritage Conservation Act. 

The assessment typically involves low-slow aerial surveys, followed by pedestrian surveys 

in areas of potential interest and subsurface testing (shovel tests) to find potential buried 

archaeological remains.  Once sites have been identified as archaeological sites, the area 

with a 50 m buffer zone is marked as a No Work Areas on relevant plans.  Should further 

work or ground altering activities be planned in these areas, a Site Alteration Permit under 

Section 12 of the Heritage Conservation Act ("SAP") would be applied.  SAPs detail the 

management, mitigation and monitoring steps that are deemed appropriate for the site.  The 

Company has advised the Principal Author that it will continue to complete AIAs, as 

required under the Heritage Conservation Act.  Further to RTEC's recommendations, the 

Tahltan Archaeological Chance Find Procedure was developed to address the possibility 

of archaeological materials being encountered during exploration activities.  The Company 

has adopted the Tahltan Archaeological Chance Find Procedure throughout the Project 

Area. 

Site Alteration Permits 

Once an area has been identified as an archaeological site, the area within a 50 m buffer 

zone is marked as a No Work Area on relevant plans.  Should further work or ground 

altering activities be planned in these areas, a SAP would be applied.  SAPs detail the 

management, mitigation and monitoring steps that are deemed appropriate for the site.   

Current Status 

Overall and to date, 14 archaeological sites have been identified throughout the Project 

Area (RTEC 2011e; 2012b; 2012c; 2013; 2015; 2016b; 2017).  The sites primarily 

comprise of obsidian artifacts called lithic find and lithic scatter. RTEC (2013; 2015;

2016b) reported that such lithic finds are primarily debitage, which are waste flakes, chips 

and spalls produced during the manufacture and maintenance of lithic tools.  The artifacts 

are believed by RTEC (RTEC, 2015) to either be carried by fluvial action from a site or 

obsidian source, or be carried from obsidian quarries located within Mount Edziza 

Volcanic Complex, at least 10 km southwest of the Project Area. 

The Principal Author has confirmed that the known archaeological sites have been marked 

as No Work Areas on relevant Project Area maps.  At the request of the Tahltan Nation, 

the locations of the archaeological sites is kept confidential and is not shown on any maps 

or plans intended for public dissemination. 

PEA and General Project Planning 

To the extent possible (and limited only by available data), consideration of heritage and 

archaeology formed part of the Project Area infrastructure planning process described in 

Section 18.  If areas identified for planned infrastructure have not had AIAs carried out, 

the Company confirmed that they will be completed at the appropriate time or times and 

infrastructure planning will be adjusted, as appropriate and if required.  Additional details 

of the heritage and archaeology of the Project Area are presented in Section 20.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 

INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Principal Author is responsible for this section of this Technical Report.  He compiled portions 

of the text from information contained in the Bridge Inspection Reports and Winter Trail Report 

referenced in Section 2.5, as well as information contained in the April 2016 and May 2016 

Technical Reports.  Various additional data was sourced on-line, from the websites cited in the 

following text.  Key elements of the presented data were verified by the Principal Author, through 

observations made during his October 2015 and October 2016 site visits and by means of 

conversations held with Company personnel.  Past information has been updated only when it was 

relevant to do so and/or when it was clear that additional information was required. 

5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The Project Area is located in the Northern Boreal Mountains Ecoprovince and lies in the Northern 

and Central Plateaus and Mountains physiographic region that is dominated by folded and faulted 

volcanic and sedimentary rocks originated in the Mesozoic era (Valentine et al., 1978).  The 

topography changes dramatically across the Project Area, from the gently rolling hills of the 

southern portion of Klastline Plateau in the east, to the lowland valleys of the Iskut and Little Iskut 

rivers to the south, and the more mountainous and moderately rugged area to the west.  Deeply 

incised creek valleys cut into the margins of Klastline Plateau, thereby creating locally steep slopes 

and cliffs.  A few small glaciers and permanent snow fields are present in the general vicinity of 

the Project Area, but not in the areas of the proposed pits or related infrastructure. 

The western margin of the Project Area is defined by the eastern slope of a small, flat-topped 

mountain that is dissected by east- to northeast-flowing streams and their tributaries.  The Project 

Area is bounded by the Kinaskan, Tatogga and Eddontenajon lakes to the east and the Nuttlude, 

Kakiddi, Mowchilla and Mowdade lakes to the west.  Glaciers occur at higher elevations to both 

the west and northwest. 

The area is moderately rugged with elevations ranging from approximately 760 m to the south to 

2,100 m in the plateau area and approximately 2,500 m on local mountain tops.   The mineralization 

that is the subject of this Technical Report is located at elevations of approximately 1,550 m in the 

west (Spectrum Pit) and between approximately 1,400 m and 1,740 m across the plateau area to 

the east (Donnelly Pit). 

Klastline Plateau is dominantly characterized by the Boreal Altai Fescue Alpine and Spruce 

Willow Birch biogeoclimatic ecosystem classification zones, with a variety of vegetation ranging 

from alpine graminoid and forb meadows, rock and lichen, with occasional shrubs and stunted 

spruce in hollows or wind-protected areas.  The lower elevations fall within the Spruce-Willow-

Birch zone, where birch and slide-alder are common at the lower elevations along creek valleys, 

while spruce and sub-alpine fir are common along the steeper slopes.  The tree line is at 

approximately 1,370 m a.m.s.l. 

The Boreal White and Black Spruce zone is also present within the Project Area, at lower 

elevations near lakes to the north, as are the Engelmann Spruce Subalpine Fir and Sub-boreal 

Spruce zones.  The dominant tree species are Engelmann spruce, sub-alpine fir and pine.  Much of 

the southern portion of the Project Area has been affected by a recent forest fire, salvage logging 

and forest development, resulting in a large area of low elevation, early seral stage vegetation 

(Rescan, 2008).

5.2 Population Centres and Transport 

5.2.1 Terrace and Smithers 

Terrace, B.C. ("Terrace") and Smithers, B.C. ("Smithers") are the main population centres 

in the general area of the Spectrum-GJ property.  Smithers is approximately 377 km to the 

south-southeast of the Project Area's centre point (the "Property Centre").  Terrace is 

approximately 362 km from the Property Centre (Figure 5.1).  According to available 

census results (source: http://www.bcstats.gov.bc.ca/StatisticsBySubject/Census/2011 

Census/PopulationHousing/MunicipalitiesByRegionalDistrict.aspx), in 2011 Terrace had 

a population of 11,310 people and Smithers had a population of 5,404 people. 

Figure 5.1 A Google Earth Image Showing the Locations of the Spectrum-GJ Project Area and 

Major Regional Centres 

 

A broad range of facilities are available at both Terrace and Smithers, including airport 

facilities with regular flights to major centres such as Vancouver, B.C. and Toronto, 

Ontario.  Both Terrace and Smithers are served by a railway line that is owned by CN 

Railway Company ("CN Rail").  The line extends from Prince Rupert on the B.C. coast 

and is linked to the North American rail network. 

A railway roadbed, including many of the required bridges, was constructed in the mid-

1980s, approximately 30 km east of the Project Area.  This was part of BC Railway 

Company's ("BC Rail") plan to extend track to Dease Lake.  In 2004, BC Rail was 

purchased by CN Rail.  To the Principal Author's best knowledge and understanding, there 

are at present no plans to make this railway line operational.

5.2.2 Dease Lake 

Dease Lake, located approximately 89 km to the north-northeast of the Property Centre 

(Figure 5.2), is the largest settlement on Highway 37.  It is the service and government 

centre for residents of the region.  The seasonally variable population peaks during summer 

months at around 450 people.  The settlement includes a hardware and grocery store, 

banking services, a nursing station, a school, gas station, hotels and a seasonal restaurant.  

Recreation facilities include a community hall, a public library, an indoor skating rink and 

a school gym. 

Figure 5.2 A Google Earth Image Showing the Locations of the Spectrum-GJ Project Area and 

Local Population Centres 

Tahltan Reserve No. 9 is located at Dease Lake, as are the offices of TNDC and the TCG.  

The B.C. government has a Service B.C. office offering licenses, permits and other 

services.  It also serves the communities of Lower Post, Good Hope Lake, Telegraph Creek 

and Iskut.  Other public offices include School District No. 87, Northern Lights College, 

an RCMP detachment, a health clinic, a B.C. Ambulance Unit and, during summer months, 

a provincial forest fire fighting base. 

Helicopter and fixed-wing charter air services are available at the Dease Lake airport 

(IATA: YDL, ICAO: CYDL).  The airport has a paved runway capable of handling small 

commercial aircraft.  A scheduled service from Prince George is operated during spring 

and summer months. 

5.2.3 Iskut 

The nearest significant settlement to the Project Area is the village of Iskut, located some 

26 km to the northeast of the Property Centre (Figure 5.2).  Most of the population of

approximately 330 people are members of the Iskut Band of the Tahltan Nation.  Iskut has 

a post office, gas station/grocery store, a school, fire station, community centre with an ice 

arena, community health facility and a Band office.  The community serves as a staging 

area for the Mount Edziza and Spatsizi Plateau wilderness parks. 

5.2.4 Telegraph Creek 

A third Tahltan Nation community is located at Telegraph Creek, some 60 km to the west-

northwest of the Property Centre and some 112 km from Dease Lake.  It is situated beside 

Stikine River, at the foot of Stikine River Canyon, and it has a population of approximately 

350 people.  The majority of the residents are members of the Telegraph Creek Band of 

the Tahltan Nation.  The settlement includes an airstrip, store and cafe, post office, police 

station, school, church and a small museum, as well as a nursing station. 

5.2.5 Tatogga and Eddontenajon 

Limited seasonal accommodation, communications and garage facilities are available at 

Tatogga Lake Resort, located approximately 19 km north-northeast of the Property Centre, 

as well as at Eddontenajon, some 2 km south of Iskut.  There are helicopter staging areas, 

covered storage and local expediting services at both Tatogga and Eddontenajon, which 

are often used to assist with both the receiving and shipping of supplies and samples to and 

from Terrace or Smithers.  

5.3 Means of Access 

5.3.1 By Air 

There is a scheduled air service, three times a week during the spring and summer months 

only, to Dease Lake from Prince George.  As previously noted (Sub-Section 5.2) charter 

aircraft, both helicopter and fixed-wing, are available at Dease Lake Airport, which has a 

year-round and regularly maintained airstrip.  Similar facilities are available at the unpaved 

Iskut airstrip and at the unpaved Bob Quinn Lake airstrip, located some 75 km due south 

of the Property Centre, adjacent to Highway 37.  Infrastructure planning for project 

development includes the use of the airport facilities at Dease Lake and/or Bob Quinn Lake 

as staging posts for personnel, materials and equipment, with personnel bussed to the 

Project Area and materials and equipment trucked to the Project Area, as appropriate. 

5.3.2 By Highway 

Access to the general Project Area is gained via the two lane, paved Highway 37 (Stewart-

Cassiar or Dease Lake Highway) that extends north from Kitwanga, B.C. ("Kitwanga", 

Figure 5.1) to the Alaska Highway, near the Yukon community of Watson Lake.  Kitwanga 

is located adjacent to Provincial Highway 16 (Yellowhead Highway), some 242 km by 

road from Prince Rupert and some 486 km by road from Prince George in central B.C.  

5.3.3 Willow Creek Road 

During the exploration phase of project development, access to more-or-less the 

geographic centre of the Project Area was by Willow Creek Road (Figures 5.3 and 5.4), a 

public, 4.0 m wide, graded dirt road with a maximum gradient of approximately 10%.  The 

Company holds a non-exclusive Road Use Permit for industrial use of this road, issued by 

the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources Operations, and is responsible for its

maintenance.  The road extends approximately 23.5 km from its turning off at Highway 37 

to the Company's staging and fuel storage area (see Figure 5.3).  It is from the Company's 

staging post that, starting in 2016, the Company's exploration camps and drillpads, etc 

were supported by helicopter. 

Bridges cross Iskut River and Little Iskut River.  The former comprises three spans of 'I' 

section steel over 57.7 m (see Figures 5.5 and 5.6) and the latter comprises one span of 'I' 

section steel over 56.4 m (see Figures 5.7 and 5.8).  Both bridges were inspected in 2014, 

by a professional engineer from B.C. Forestry and Range (the Certificates of Inspection 

have been reviewed by the Principal Author).  Both bridges were found to be in fair to good 

condition; the need for some minor repairs was identified.  Both bridges were rated as 

having Gross Vehicle Weight ("GVW") carrying capacities of 68 t. 

A replacement date of 2034 was identified in the 2014 inspection report for Iskut River 

Bridge and a replacement date of 2040 was identified for Little Iskut River Bridge.  

Infrastructure planning for project development includes additional professional bridge 

inspections, upgrades as identified and required by virtue of the inspections, and bridge 

replacements on or before the stated replacement dates.  Details of this planning are 

presented in Section 18, which planning for project development through to production 

also includes: 

 upgrades to Willow Creek Road and construction of new road sections to by-pass the 
planned tailings storage facility ("TSF") and to extend across the Designated Access 

Corridor to the Spectrum claims block (which alignment requires the construction of 

two new bridges); and 

 construction of internal access roads leading to the planned operations' centres, pit 
areas and surface water by-pass ditches.

In the opinion of the Principal Author, there is no practicable alternative to using the 

Willow Creek Road and its planned extensions for accessing the Project Area, 

infrastructure areas and deposits of interest.  Similarly, there is no readily identifiable 

reason to suppose that the existing access roads and bridges, their planned upgrades and 

the planned extensions to Willow Creek Road will not be sufficient to meet at least the 

Company's medium-term needs.  The heaviest vehicles that are planned to use Willow 

Creek Road and its extensions will be loaded and covered B-Train type road trucks with 

GVWs limited to 45 t (thereby allowing for safety factors approximating to 1.5 for the 

bridges' GVW ratings stated above).  Where possible, planning encompasses the transport 

of heavy equipment, during the construction phase of project development, in lots weighing 

no more than 45 t, inclusive of the transport vehicle.  If heavier loads are anticipated or 

required, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure regulations will be followed as 

appropriate and for the individual case.  For example and as minimum, when total weights 

greater than 45 t are moved across the existing bridges, a suitably qualified and certificated 

supervising engineer will be present at all times.  The bridges will also be strengthened 

with stiffening plates and/or bracing, in accordance with the requirements or 

recommendations of the transportation contractor and/or supervising engineer. 

5.3.4 Winter Trail and Other Trails 

The Winter Trail extends from the end of Willow Creek Road, through the heart of the 

Project Area and to the southern shore of Nuttlude Lake (Figure 5.3).  It comprises an 

extensively overgrown, 1.0 m to 3.0 m wide, mostly ungraded cat trail with several sections 

of graded fire breaks.  Its alignment has been overflown (by helicopter) by the Principal

Author and it has been walked by Company Geologists.  While significant lengths of its 

alignment can clearly be seen from the air, it can be difficult to follow on the ground.  

Overall its alignment contains many steep up-slope and down-slope sections, as well as 

many sharp turns.  Figure 5.9 is a collage of five photographs that demonstrate the variable 

conditions along the existing trail.  Several other cat trails or rough roads access the Central 

Zone and Donnelly Deposit area. Their condition is poor, except in the immediate area of 

the Donnelly Deposit where they are in reasonable condition and passable by small utility 

vehicles.

5.4 Climate and Operating Season 

The climate in northwest B.C. is northern temperate to subarctic, with moderately warm summers 

and dry, cold winters.  Climatic longitudinal and elevation gradients are located throughout the 

area due to influences such as mountain ranges, valley confluences, rain shadows and wind 

conditions, resulting in local climatic variations and even micro-climates.  During the winter, 

temperature inversions can result in colder temperatures in valley bottoms than on the peaks, and 

chinook winds can result in rapid temperature changes. 

Dease Lake is the closest population centre for which climate data is available (see 

http://www.deaselake.climatemps.com), but the weather patterns are sufficiently dissimilar to 

those found across the Project Area that the available data are not presented here.  The Principal 

Author has instead relied on information contained in a consultancy report prepared for Teck by 

RTEC entitled 'GJ/Kinaskan Copper-Gold Porphyry Project, 2005 to 2008 Meteorology Data 

Report' and dated October 2011 (RTEC, 2011a).  The data contained therein was captured from 

an automated meteorological weather station, located on Klastline Plateau, that 'collected data for 

the following parameters; wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity, 

precipitation, and snow depth' (see also Section 20). 

5.4.1 Average Temperatures 

Typical daily average temperatures across the Property Area vary between minus 18°C in 

winter (November through January) and plus 13°C in summer.   The average, minimum 

and maximum monthly temperatures recorded by the meteorological station on Klastline 

Plateau ranged from minus 15.6°C to plus 12.8°C, minus 17.8°C to plus 11.4°C and minus 

13.4°C to plus 17.8°C, respectively.   

5.4.2 Wind Direction and Speeds 

It is stated in RTEC (2011a) that 'The predominant wind direction was from the south' and 

'The predominant wind speed on Klastline Plateau is greater than 6 m/s and occurred 

approximately 30% of the time.  Wind speeds were calm (i.e. hourly average wind speed 

less than 1 m/s) only about 3% of the time.  The maximum wind speed was 47.9 m/s and 

was recorded during July 2008'.  A maximum instantaneous wind speed of 47.9 m/s 

equates to a wind speed of 172 kph. 

5.4.3 Rainfall 

A rain shadow effect caused by the Boundary Ranges limits the amount of moisture (hence 

snow) carried from the coast by the prevailing winds.  The Stikine Plateau has a similar but 

moderated hydrologic regime with the spring freshet being the most common peak flood 

event of the year.   

Rainfall is highest from May to September; it averages approximately 500 mm per year 

across the western portion of the Property Area and approximately 650 mm to the east (it 

is stated in RTEC, 2011, that 'Annual precipitation ranged from 567 to 574 mm during the 

two complete calendar years (2006 and 2007) but was likely affected by undercatch due to 

rime icing and high wind speeds').  Fall precipitation events can generate large annual peak 

flows, but they are infrequent (Melymick, 2013).  Unverified information suggests that 

rainfall during storm events can total at least 50 mm in approximately 12 hours.

5.4.4 Snow 

Snow typically falls across the Project Area between October and April.  In common with 

rainfall, the amount reflects the local topography: it typically varies from fairly thick 

accumulations across the west of the Property Area to, at worst, moderate accumulations 

in the valleys and on Klastline Plateau in the east.  RTEC states that 'The maximum annual 

snow depths recorded during the measurement period (on Klastline Plateau) ranged from 

85 cm to 110 cm and were recorded during mid-April' (RTEC, 2011a).  Overall, the Project 

Area is in the rain shadow of Mount Edziza, with the result that it receives significantly 

less snow than the Coast mountain range to the west. 

The evidence of tree growth patterns suggests that a minor snow avalanche hazard exists 

on the west slopes of the Spectrum claims block, due mainly to the steep slope gradients.  

The avalanche season typically begins in early October at the higher elevations, and it often 

extends until late June or early July.  Avalanches may be experienced from late October to 

late May in valet bottoms (Canadian Avalanche Association, 2017).  Start zones are 

generally above 1,400 m within the alpine zone (Schwab, 2015). 

5.4.5 Fieldwork and Operating Seasons 

Fieldwork can normally start at lower elevations in early June and at upper elevations by 

July.  Cold weather, winds and snow squalls can make fieldwork difficult at upper 

elevations past September, although drilling has continued into November on Klastline 

Plateau. 

In the opinion of the Principal Author, there is no readily identifiable reason to suppose 

that with the exception of periods of extreme weather, mine production activities could not 

continue year round.  Occasional and minor snow avalanches could, however, affect 

production activities in the planned Spectrum Pit.  Both fieldwork and mine production 

activities are facilitated by the annual average of 12 daylight hours per day, rising to 

approximately 14.7 hours per day through June to early November. 

5.5 Surface Rights, Power, Water and Personnel 

5.5.1 Surface Rights 

The existence of the Spectrum-GJ mineral claims is recognized within the CIS LRMP (see 

also Section 4.9).  Mineral exploration, mine development and associated access continue 

to be recognized as appropriate activities within the CIS LRMP. 

To the Principal Author's best knowledge and understanding, no restrictions as regards 

access to the Property Area or access within and across the Property Area exist, the latter 

for the reasons described in Section 4.4: 

 save for the Nuttlude Group of mineral claims in which the Company has a 50% 
interest, the Company is the 100% owner of the mineral claims that comprise the 

Property Area; 

 mineral claims are administered by the B.C. Ministry of Energy and Mines, according 
to the 1996 Act;

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 it is through the 1996 Act that a mineral title holder is granted the right to use the 
surface of the held claim or claims for the exploration and development or production 

of minerals and all operations related to the business of mining; 

 nearly all of the planned infrastructure for project development through to production 
is located on mineral claims that are 100% owned by the Company (the exception is 

the Designated Access Corridor identified on Figure 5.5 and discussed in Sub-Section 

4.9.3); and 

 as previously stated (Sub-Section 4.2), all project-related infrastructure and related 
activities have been planned such that they are as far away from the park boundary/the 

Project Area boundary as is practicably feasible. 

As previously noted (Section 5.3), access to the Spectrum Pit area will require the 

construction of a new road and two new bridges within the Designated Access Corridor 

identified on Figure 5.5 and discussed in Sub-Section 4.9.3.  This and related infrastructure 

planning for project development through to production is described in Section 18. 

5.5.2 Power Supply 

Hydroelectric power is available through B.C. Hydro's 287 kV Northwest Transmission 

Line (see Figure 5.3 and BC Hydro's news release dated August 13, 2014 available on 

www.bchydro.com).  Infrastructure planning for project development includes a new off-

take sub-station located on a Company mineral claim, adjacent to the Willow Creek Road 

turnoff from Highway 37, as well as a new, approximately 32 km long powerline extending 

to a project site sub-station located at the MIA.  It is at the MIA where the camp, plant and 

other key infrastructure will be located (see Section 18). 

5.5.3 Water Supply 

No specific plans concerning mining, process, potable and fire water supplies have been 

formulated within the scope of the PEA.  However, abundant water is locally available.  In 

the Principal Author's opinion, there is no readily identifiable reason to suppose that 

sufficient water resources to service the needs of the planned Spectrum-GJ operations 

could not be secured from a combination of waterwells and runoff.  Infrastructure planning 

for project development includes recycling water pumped from the planned TSF.  A formal 

waterwell location study, pumping test program and other hydrogeologic studies are 

recommended, going forward (see also Section 5.9). 

5.5.4 Personnel 

A number of experienced and qualified operators, who were trained and are (or were) 

working at active and closed mines in the general region of the Spectrum-GJ project, are 

based in the Tahltan Nation communities at Dease Lake, Iskut and Telegraph Creek.  

Unskilled and skilled personnel are also available at many regional and provincial centres 

such as Terrace, Smithers and Prince George. 

The Company has advised the Principal Author that it intends to continue to maximize 

employment opportunities for Tahltan Nation members at the Spectrum-GJ project, subject 

to skills and suitability, by actively recruiting and training employees from the local area.  

This will form a key element of the Company's overall project development plan that

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

includes the fly-in/fly-out cycling of appropriately skilled crews and staff to the airport 

facilities at either Dease Lake and/or Bob Quinn Lake, from where personnel will be bussed 

to site where they will be accommodated at a central camp facility.  Bussing personnel 

from the local population centres at Iskut, Telegraph Creek, Eddontenajon and Tatogga 

and will also be carried out, as required and appropriate. 

Expediting services, drilling contractors and heavy equipment services can be sourced out 

of Terrace and Smithers, as well as through TNDC based at Dease Lake.  The Company 

has advised the Principal Author that: 

 it intends to contract for goods and services, as required, using industry-accepted 
tendering practices, with awards made based on price, quality, safety, value, 

availability and schedule; 

 the letting of contracts for the provision of materials, labour, equipment, services or 
construction will be conducted in a competitive, businesslike, morally and ethically 

responsible manner; 

 Tahltan Nation businesses will be provided competitive access to such economic 
opportunities, provided always that the Company is satisfied that the terms of the 

contract are competitive in all respects as to price, delivery, capability, performance 

and quality.  

5.5.5 Communications 

A local, land-based telephone service is provided by Northwestel, which operates 

throughout northern B.C.  Mobile telephone services are not currently available in the 

region, except through local wi-fi.  Northwestel also provides high- and low-capacity 

digital radio at Dease Lake and Iskut, respectively, as well as a satellite earth station in 

Telegraph Creek.  All local communities have access to high-speed internet.  Infrastructure 

planning for project development includes the installation of project-dedicated 

communications systems. 

5.6 Tailings, Waste and Plant Areas and Sites 

In the Principal Author's opinion, there is ample room to locate and construct: 

 all infrastructure required to safely sustain the planned production from Spectrum Pit, inclusive 
of ROM production handling facilities, mine offices, tank farms, a warehouse and a 

maintenance shop; 

 all infrastructure required to safely sustain the planned production from Donnelly Pit, inclusive 
of a marginal grade material dump, a waste dump and ROM production handling facilities; 

 all infrastructure related to the delivered ROM production from both planned pits, including 
ROM production storage areas and surge bins, an appropriately dimensioned plant facility 

(inclusive of a laboratory and reagent handling facility) located at the MIA; 

 the construction of an appropriately laid-out MIA where, in addition to the plant and related 
infrastructure, mine site sub-station and distribution system will be located along with the main 

project warehouse and maintenance facility, cold storage room, fuel and water tank farms and 

distribution facilities, mine dry, main administration offices and camp;

 appropriately dimensioned and located explosive storage and handling facilities at both 
planned pit sites; and 

 a life-of-mine TSF with surface water run-off by-pass ditches, an overflow by-pass channel, a 
polishing pond, recycled water pumping facility and a water treatment plant. 

Figure 5.10 provides a general summary of the planned infrastructure, the majority of which is 

located on the Company's 100% owned mineral claims - the only exception is the portion of the 

access road to the Spectrum Pit area that extends over the Designated Access Corridor identified 

on Figure 5.10 and described in Sub-Section 4.9.3.  Details of the planned infrastructure (and the 

related, risk-based planning process) are presented in Section 18. 

Planning for project development to production does not include considerations of heap leaching, 

hence the need for heap leach pads and related infrastructure.  However, from Year 5 a gold 

leaching plant will be located within the MIA and in an engineered containment area to ensure that 

there is no risk of release of leachate (cyanide) to the environment in the event of an upset 

condition. 

5.7 Seismicity 

A formal seismic risk assessment for the Project Area has not been carried out within the scope of 

the PEA.  It is, however, known (and acknowledged by the Company) that the Project Area is 

located in a moderately high, seismic risk zone.    

The national seismic hazard map produced by the Geological Survey of Canada for use in the 2015 

National Building Code of Canada (source: www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/hazard-

alea/zoning-zonage/NBCC2015maps-en.php), indicates that the Project Area is located in 

Acceleration Zone 2.  At the location of the notional centre point of the Project Area (Latitude 57º 

39' 21" N, Longitude 130º 15' 41" W), Natural Resources Canada's 2015 seismic risk calculator 

reports a peak horizontal ground acceleration of 0.044 g (g = 9.81 m/s2) with a 2% chance of 

exceedance in 50 years (0.000404 per annum, or 1 in 2,475). 

The Company has advised the Principal Author that it acknowledges that infrastructure for future 

mining that is located on the Project Area, and most especially the TSF dam, must be designed, 

constructed, operated and maintained to meet in full the applicable best practice standards. 

5.8 Watersheds and Drainage Patterns 

Two main watersheds are developed in the Project Area: 

 the Stikine River system that covers the northwest of the Project Area, which drains to the 
north in the immediate vicinity of the Project Area and which includes the Mowdade, 

Mowchilla, Kakiddi and Nuttlude lakes; and 

 the Iskut River system to the south and east of the Project Area that drains to the south-
southwest in the immediate vicinity of the Project Area and which includes Eddontenajon, 

Tatogga and Kinaskan lakes (Figure 5.11). 

Consideration of the watersheds identified on Figure 5.11 formed part of the planning process for 

Donnelly Pit described in Section 16.  It also formed part of the risk analyses employed within the 

scope of the infrastructure planning process described in Section 18.

5.9 Qualified Persons' Opinion 

In the Principal Author's opinion, there is no readily identifiable reason to suppose that the 

Company's Spectrum-GJ project development plans reported herein could not successfully and 

safely be carried out in an environmentally sustainable manner.  Furthermore: 

 there is sufficient area to allow construction of all required Project infrastructure, the vast 
majority of which will be located on claims that are 100% held by the Company (the only 

exception is that portion of the access road to the Spectrum Pit area that extends over the 

Designated Access Corridor); 

 it is expected that any future mining operations could be carried out year-round, with only 
minor breaks caused by adverse weather conditions; and 

 the Company has advised the Principal Author that it intends to file for mining leases, as and 
when appropriate.  

In the opinion of the Principal Author, the planned infrastructure, availability of staff, the existing 

power, water and communications facilities, and the methods whereby goods and equipment could 

be transported to the proposed infrastructure sites are sufficient to support the declaration of 

Mineral Resources and a PEA for the Spectrum-GJ project.  The requirement for supporting studies 

going forward is understood by the Company, in which regard the Principal Author understands 

that the Company will undertake, at the appropriate time and as required: 

 confirmation drilling at the key infrastructure locations (especially the MIA and planned TSF 
described in Section 18); 

 geotechnical studies, soil and vegetation characterizations, and geohazard assessments, as 
appropriate for the key infrastructure areas; 

 suitable waterwell siting, pumping and drawdown studies designed to identify and prove-up 
water resources suitable to sustain the planned operations and camp facilities, inclusive of 

considerations of water balances and water recycling; 

 hydrogeologic studies in and around the planned pit areas to establish pit dewatering 
requirements and pumping capacities; 

 a location-specific seismicity risk assessment for application in infrastructure design, as 
appropriate; and 

 the environmental baseline studies and surveys actions plans described in Section 20. 

It is further noted that: 

 the main economic activities of the general region of the Project Area are mining, limited 

forestry and seasonal tourism; 

 a considerable amount of mining exploration has taken place in the region in recent years that 

has resulted in the spin-off of local support and service sectors;

 the CIS LRMP states that the area is endowed with provincially to globally significant 
mineralization and rich energy values and that the region has had several productive operating 

mines, including most notably the Red Chris and Brucejack mines (under construction), as well 

as Eskay Creek that closed in 2003; 

 according to government statistics, at over 10% on average, unemployment rates in the region 
are high compared with the B.C. provincial average of approximately 6%, especially for males 

under 24 years of age (data as at February 2017); 

 according to available census data, the levels of education attainment in the local communities 
are in general lower than the B.C. averages, but that a higher percentage than the provincial 

average have apprenticeships, trade or college certificates and diplomas, which suggests a 

skilled industrial workforce that is well-suited to the work-related demands of the development 

and operation of openpit mines; and 

 TNDC has a long and successful history of mine contracting in the region, including at the 
Snip, Eskay Creek, Red Chris and Golden Bear mines.

6 HISTORY 

The Principal Author is responsible for this section of this Technical Report, except for Section 

6.2 for which David Thomas, P. Geo. ("QP Thomas") is responsible.  The text was compiled from 

abstracts taken from the April 2016 and May 2016 Technical Reports.  Past information has been 

updated only when it was relevant to do so and/or when it was clear that additional information 

was required. 

As part of a larger due diligence process, the Principal Author cross-referenced information 

contained in the April 2016 and May 2016 Technical Reports with the Company's drillhole 

database, and plotted the collar positions and drill strings using ArcGIS to ensure they intersected 

the stated mineralized occurrences.  It is the validated data relating to the mineralized occurrences 

noted in the following text that is reported here. 

6.1 Background 

The Project Area is located in a region known for its sub-alkalic to alkalic intrusions, associated 

porphyry Cu-Au mineralization and peripheral gold- and silver-bearing quartz veins.  Geological 

mapping of the region was first carried out in the 1950s and 1960s by the Geological Survey of 

Canada (Souther, 1972).  This was followed by airborne magnetic surveys carried out between 

1975 and 1978, the results of which are detailed on Geophysical Series Map 9217G – Kinaskan 

Lake, Sheet 104 G/9.  A regional geological mapping program (1:50,000 scale) over the Tatogga 

Lake area, including Klastline Plateau, was also carried out in 1997 by the B.C. Ministry of Energy, 

Mines and Petroleum Resources (Ash et al., 1997b). 

Figures 6.1 and 6.2 are plans of the Spectrum claims block (Figure 6.1) and GJ claims block 

(Figure 6.2) on which are identified the mineralized occurrences and zones cited in the following 

text.  In the case of the Spectrum claims block, the cited occurrences and zones reflect historical 

nomenclature: the Company's current Central Zone geological model includes the 500 Colour, 33, 

Skarn and Porphyry zones, which were previously considered to be separate mineralized 

occurrences.  The 300 Colour and East Creek zones remain separate from the Central Zone. 

6.2 Previous Owners and Exploration Activity 

6.2.1 1950s and 1960s 

The first recorded work within the Project Area dates from 1957 when Torbit Silver Mines 

Limited ("Torbit") carried out initial evaluation work on the Hawk vein, which is located 

in the far north of the current Spectrum claims block (see Figure 6.1).  No further work 

appears to have been carried out by Torbit and its Hawk claim was allowed to lapse. 

Shawinigan Mining and Smelting Company Limited re-staked the Hawk claim in 1967 and 

was reported to have drilled X-ray holes on the Hawk vein.  Subsequent exploration activity 

focused mainly on what was then known as the Central showing (i.e. what eventually 

became known as the Central Zone), following the discovery in 1969 of a large gossan and 

porphyry-type copper mineralization to the southwest of Nuttlude Lake, by Spartan 

Explorations Limited ("Spartan").  It was shortly after the discovery that Spartan staked an 

area covering the mineralized occurrences outlined.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

The first recorded exploration work in the eastern portion of the Project Area was in 1964 

when Conwest Exploration Co. Ltd. ("Conwest") carried out a regional evaluation of 

Klastline Plateau.  Several porphyry Cu-Au and precious metal shear-vein targets were 

identified, including the GJ and QC porphyry systems and the Horn Silver prospect 

(Hedley, 1966).  Claims were staked over these prospects and a preliminary soil survey 

and a ground magnetic survey were carried out on the QC showing. 

In 1965, Huntec Limited ("Huntec") carried out 2.19 line kilometres of IP and 1.83 line 

kilometres of ground magnetometer surveys along two lines on the QC claims, on behalf 

of Conwest.  Huntec interpreted 'the high apparent chargeability readings to be caused by 

extensive sulphide mineralization. The magnetometer and resistivity I.P. readings were 

very flat' (Dodds, 1965).  Conwest also completed three AQ diameter diamond drillholes 

on the Horn Silver prospect (325.83 m).  No details of Conwest's drillholes seem to have 

survived and they do not appear in the Company's drillhole database. 

In 1969, additional silt sampling, geological mapping, soil sampling and a ground 

magnetometer survey were carried out by Conwest over the azurite-stained QC gossan 

zone. 

6.2.2 1970s – Central Showing and Hawk Vein 

In the 1970s, exploration activity gathered pace on the Central showing and Hawk vein, 

starting with Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company Limited that carried out geological, 

geochemical and geophysical surveys.  In 1971, Imperial Oil Limited ("Imperial") optioned 

what had become known as the Spectrum property and carried out geological mapping 

along with additional geochemical and geophysical surveys.  Imperial followed this up 

with four BQ diameter diamond drillholes totaling 463.44 m, thereby defining low-grade 

copper mineralization in monzonite with adjacent potassic-altered volcanics.  Assays for 

gold were also completed, but the confidence in the results is low with the result that the 

data was not used in the Mineral Resource estimate presented in Section 14 (see also 

Sections 11.5 and 12.4).  Imperial's claims were allowed to lapse in 1973. 

In 1975, Racicot Syndicate re-staked the area of what was then considered the Central 

showing and named the Red Dog claims.  Later in 1975 the property was optioned to Canex 

Placer who subsequently relinquished the claims.  Consolidated Silver Ridge Mines Ltd 

("Silver Ridge") optioned the Red Dog claims in 1977 and in 1978 added the Pink and Red 

claims, following geological mapping and surface geochemistry.  Silver Ridge also 

completed 73 m of exploration drift (2.0 m by 2.6 m) along the Hawk vein and completed 

an unknown number of underground drillholes.  This was followed up in 1979 with the 

Camp claim, staked to cover the exploration camp area and airstrip adjacent to Nuttlude 

Lake.  An access road was constructed from the camp to the Central showing, following 

which a ten hole drilling program was completed for a total of 832.20 m (Table 6.1).

Exploration activity also gathered pace from 1970 on the GJ property to the east of the 

Project Area.  Amoco Corporation ("Amoco") initially optioned the property from 

Conwest, following which geological mapping was carried out and approximately 16 km 

of rough access road were constructed from Kinaskan Lake.  A five hole diamond drilling 

program was completed on the original GJ showing (Carter, 1971), as well as a seven hole 

diamond drilling program on the QC showing for a total of 3,255.87 m (Table 6.2).  An 

additional hole (QC-BC-70-1) was started, but no records exist, other than a comment to 

the effect that it did not reach the target mineralization.

In 1971, Amoco constructed a rough access road from the southwest end of Kinaskan Lake 

to the south end of Klastline Plateau from where it extended north across the plateau to the 

GJ showing and the headwaters of Groat Creek.  Amoco carried out geological, 

geochemical and geophysical surveys and completed the 14 hole, 2,479.12 m drilling 

programs summarized on Table 6.3.

The Amoco claims were allowed to lapse in October 1975, after which a 12 unit GJ claim 

was staked over the GJ showing by United Mineral Services Ltd. ("UMS") (Good and 

Garratt, 1977).  No exploration activity appears to have been carried out by UMS.  

However, in 1976 Great Plains Development Corp. ("Great Plains") optioned the GJ claim 

and carried out geological mapping, geochemical surveys and 22 m of trenching.  A 15.5 

km picket-line grid was also constructed for purposes of carrying out a ground magnetic 

survey (Winter et al., 1976).  During the following year, Great Plains carried out an IP 

survey over the 15.5 km GJ grid (Walcott, 1977) and an overburden geochemical sampling 

program (Good and Garratt, 1977).  Great Plains dropped their option and, in October 1978, 

its assets were transferred to its parent company, Norcen Energy Resources Ltd. 

TexasGulf Canada Ltd. ("TexasGulf") acquired the QC property in the mid-1970s (date 

unknown) and completed a small field program (geological mapping, sampling) before 

letting it go in favour of other prospects in the region (Newell, 1978).  

6.2.4 1970s – Donnelly, North Donnelly and Wolf Zone 

Subsequent to UMS staking its claims over the GJ showing, TexasGulf staked claims to 

the west, north and northeast, thereby effectively covering what are now known as the 

Donnelly and North Donnelly deposits, as well as part of the Wolf area (Donnelly, et al., 

1976), a small portion of the Wolf area being already covered by an internal claim (Racicot, 

1976).  In his report, Racicot mentioned that two short pack-sack holes were drilled, but 

very little core was recovered.  No further details were provided. 

In 1976 TexasGulf constructed 10.6 km of picket-line grid over the Donnelly showing, 

completed IP and ground magnetic surveys over the grid and carried out geological

mapping and 51 m of trenching (Peatfield and Donnelly, 1976).  The picket-line was 

extended by 13.1 km in 1977 on which 18.5 km of IP surveys were carried out and 75 

bedrock surface samples were collected using a hand-held, gas powered Pionjaar drill.  The 

ten hole, 1,523.90 m drilling program summarized on Table 6.4 was also completed 

(Forsythe et al., 1977).

No further work appears to have been carried out on the Donnelly showing until 1980 when 

TexasGulf drilled five, BQ diameter holes for 1,114.90 m in, including four new holes for 

965.00 m and the deepening of hole TG-77-04 by 149.90 m (Peatfield, 1980).  TexasGulf 

became Kidd Creek Mines Ltd., which was ultimately acquired by Falconbridge Limited 

("Falconbridge").  In line with its corporate decision to discontinue exploration in B.C., 

Falconbridge did not carry out any further exploration work in the Project Area, prior to 

allowing its claims to lapse in 2000. 

6.2.5 1980s – Spectrum Claims Block 

In 1980, Silver Ridge completed an additional 240.5 m of exploration drifting and crosscut 

development on the Hawk Vein, along with nine underground drillholes (on the Hawk 

vein) totaling 430.20 m.  These holes do not appear in the Company's drillhole database as 

no assay data is available.  Silver Ridge also completed the 18 hole, 2,399.90 m drilling 

program summarized on Table 6.5.  Silver Ridge relinquished its option over the Spectrum 

claims block in 1981, which then comprised the Red Dog, Pink, Red and Camp claims. 

No further exploration activity was carried out in the Spectrum area until Cominco Ltd. 

("Cominco") optioned the property in 1984 and completed a surface sampling program and 

a geophysical (very low frequency magnetic, or "VLF-Mag") surveys over the Central 

showing.  In 1989, Cominco completed the ten hole, 1,199.0 m diamond drilling program 

summarized on Table 6.6.

If the 1980 to 1989 drillhole numbering sequences detailed on Tables 6.5 and 6.6 are 

considered, it may be seen that the possibility exists that an additional four holes were 

drilled (S80 or S89-29 through -32).  No records for such holes exist. 

Between 1987 and 1989, under an option agreement with Cominco, Moongold Resources 

Ltd. ("Moongold") completed rock and soil sampling, as well as VLF-mag and resistivity 

surveys over the Hawk vein.  Moongold did not, however, pursue its option further. 

6.2.6 1980 Through 1991 – GJ Claims Block 

In 1979, Dimac Resources Corp. ("Dimac") purchased the GJ claims from UMS and, in 

1981, optioned them to Canorex who drilled seven NQ diameter diamond drillholes for 

1,865.07 m in the GJ showing, thereby earning a 50% interest in the property (McInnis,

1981).  Dimac subsequently declared bankruptcy and, following reorganization of Canorex 

and the purchase of Dimac's interest in the GJ claims from the Royal Bank of Canada, 

Curator Resources Ltd., (which became International Curator in October 1985) emerged in 

1983 as the sole owner of the GJ property.  

Between July 20 and August 15, 1981, following a preliminary stage of geological 

mapping, prospecting and trenching, Tenajon Silver Corporation ("Tenajon") drilled a total 

of seven BQ diameter holes (710.94 m) on their five claim package that both covered and 

surrounded the Horn Silver showing.  The Horn mineral claim was originally staked in 

1979 and it was transferred to Tenajon in 1980 (previously ERL Resources Ltd.), which 

then located Silver Claims-1 through -4 (Thompson, 1981).  Although no information is 

available, it is assumed that after 1981 Tenajon either sold the claims or allowed them to 

lapse. 

In 1988, Geological Survey of Canada ("GSC") released the results of a regional stream 

sediment sampling program (National Geochemical Reconnaissance, 1988). Teck staked 

the QC l to QC15 claims in the Quash Creek area, to cover copper-gold geochemical 

anomalies resulting from the GSC survey. Teck did some silt and soil geochemical 

sampling which led to the discovery of Au-Ag-Cu-Zn veins 5.5 km northwest of the QC 

Porphyry Zone; four vein systems (Main, Top, Gordon's, Upper Gordon) were exposed by 

hand trenching (Delaney, 1988).  Teck was reported to have done no work on the QC zone. 

In 1989, Ascot Resources Ltd. ("Ascot") optioned a large number of claims covering the 

eastern half of Klastline Plateau, plus the GJ claims block from International Curator.  

Fieldwork in 1989 (under the direction of R. K. Netolitzky, now Chairman of the 

Company) included 73 silt samples from drainages around the GJ target and 62 rock chip 

samples from exposures along creek drainages.  A flagged grid was also constructed, from 

which 389 bedrock surface rock chip samples were collected using a gas powered Wacker 

drill (Mehner, 1990).  The following summer Ascot collected 274 soils from contour lines 

along the plateau edge and carried out 20.7 line kilometres of IP and ground magnetic 

surveys on a flagged grid.  Before dropping the option, Ascot also completed the 12 hole, 

1,921.20 m drilling program summarized on Table 6.7 (Mehner, 1991).

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

In 1990, Triumph Resources Ltd. ("Triumph") optioned the QC claims from Teck, carried 

out silt, contour soil and rock geochemical surveys over the QC zone and resampled the 

vein showings (Konkin, 1990).  In September 1990, Dryden Resource Corporation 

optioned ten claims covering the QC showing from Teck, the 90% owner of the claims, 

Silver Standard Resources Ltd, the 10% owner of the claims and Triumph Resource 

Corporation that had an option to earn up to 50% of Teck's interest in the claims.   To 

satisfy the option terms, Dryden carried out silt, soil and rock geochemical sampling and 

drilled three holes (546.80 m) into what is now known as the GJ showing, as well as two 

holes (174.64 m) into the western edge of a copper-gold anomaly identified in talus fines 

by Triumph (Mehner, 1991a), which anomaly is now known as the Gordon Vein.  There is 

no record of Dryden's actions following its 1991 field program; it is assumed that the 

claims were allowed to lapse. 

6.2.7 1990 Through 2010 – Spectrum Claims Block 

The Spectrum claims block was optioned by Columbia Gold Mines Ltd. ("Columbia") in 

1990.  Columbia subsequently completed a trenching program and the 20 hole, 2,364.28 m 

diamond drilling program summarized on Table 6.8.  It was in consequence of the 1990 

drilling program that the main mineralized zones found on the Spectrum claims block were 

first identified as distinct mineralized occurrences – previous drilling programs were of a 

more general nature with the identifying names of the mineralized zones and occurrences 

attributed after the fact.

In 1991 Columbia followed up its 1990 programs with the 24 hole, 3,967.50 m diamond 

drilling program summarized on Table 6.9.  Results were consolidated with the results of 

previous surface drilling programs and an initial Mineral Resource estimate for Central 

Zone was compiled (see Section 6.3).  In 1992 Columbia added the six hole, 710.33 m, 

drilling program summarized at the foot of Table 6.9.  At the same time, Columbia carried 

out a limited prospecting program to identify northerly extensions of what was now called 

the Central zone.

Columbia's 1992 work program marked the end of exploration activity on the Spectrum 

claims block, at least until 2014 when the Company gained a 100% interest in the property.  

Efforts were instead focused on lobbying the B.C. government to amend the Mount Edziza 

Provincial Park boundary, thereby to allow access and further mineral exploration work on 

the Spectrum property.  Lobbying was first done by Arkaroola Resources Ltd., which 

purchased the property from Columbia in 1996, and then by Seeker Resources Corp. 

("Seeker") when it took up ownership in 2002.  During this process it was reported that 

Seeker's Spectrum property was maintained in good standing by cash payments in lieu of

exploration work.  The lobbying was ultimately successful as the Designated Access 

Corridor described in Section 4.9.3 was established. 

Up to 2011 Seeker also carried out baseline environmental studies, applied for drilling and 

archaeological permits (in 2009), posted a C$20,000 bond with the B.C. government and 

optioned its Spectrum property holdings to Transpacific Mining Ltd. ("TPM").  TPM re-

estimated the Mineral Resources for Central Zone and undertook a petrographic study, but 

did not pursue its option further.  

6.2.8 1992 Through 2010 – Expanded GJ Claims Block 

No further work on the GJ claims block appears to have been carried out following 

Dryden's 1991 program, until 2000 when International Curator collected 18 rock and 61 

soil samples from newly staked ground covering the Donnelly and North targets.  This was 

followed in 2002 with the first program of a multi-year, systematic evaluation of the Cu-

Au porphyry mineralization that characterizes the Donnelly and North Donnelly deposits.  

The 2002 work program involved the construction of a picket-line grid and the completion 

of 17.85 line kilometres of IP and ground magnetic surveys over the Donnelly target. 

In mid-2003, by merging with Royal County, International Curator acquired claims 

covering most of the remaining portions of Klastline plateau, including those immediately 

east and north of the North and GJ zones.  The 2003 work program included extension of 

the Donnelly picket grid both east and north, thereby to cover the North Zone.  Geological 

mapping, prospecting, hand trenching and sampling, contour soil sampling, bedrock 

surface (Wacker drill) sampling and 18.35 line kilometres of IP and ground magnetic 

surveys (Mehner, 2004) were also carried out.  In the fall of 2003, an airborne magnetic 

survey was flown over the entire Klastline plateau area.  In December 2003, International 

Curator underwent a corporate re-organization and changed its name to CGH.  

In 2004, CGH extended the picket-line grids north of the Donnelly grid, as well as east and 

south of the North grid.  A further 17.45 line kilometres of IP and 24.5 km of ground 

magnetic surveys were completed, additional Wacker drilling in the North, GJ East and 

Donnelly zones was carried out and detailed silt sampling programs in the drainages 

coming from the porphyry zones were completed, along with rock and soil sampling.  The 

20 hole, 4,241.51 m drilling program summarized on Table 6.10 was also completed 

(Mehner, 2005; Mehner and Peatfield, 2005). 

In January 2005, CGH merged the GJ, JJ, BJ, LJ, DJ, OJ, Spike #1, Spike #2, T1 to T4 and 

SH3 and SH4 into new mineral claims using the MTO tenure management system 

implemented by the B.C. Ministry of Energy and Mines.  CGH also acquired four new 

claims totaling 1,471.79 ha in the southwest portion of the GJ claims block.  CGH also 

accelerated its exploration program in 2005, concentrating mainly on diamond drilling, as 

suggested by the numbers and total length of completed holes summarized on Table 6.10 

(Mehner, 2006; Mehner and Peatfield, 2006).  In addition to drilling, CGH also: 

 completed 11.3 line kilometres of IP and 34.9 line kilometres of ground magnetometer 
surveying to expand and fill-in previous coverage; 

 expanded the previous soil sampling surveys; 

 excavated and sampled 13 hand trenches totaling 784 linear metres; and

ha).  The 62 hole, 18,133.22 m drilling program summarized on Table 6.10 was also 

completed (Mehner, 2007; Mehner et al., 2007), with an additional 80 holes completed in

Zone was prepared and announced, prior to CGH changing its name to NGEx Resources 

Inc. ("NGEx") in September 2009 (see Sub-Section 6.2.3). 

On 01 June 2010, Linda Marie Twerdohlib, on behalf of Teck, registered the 48 WILLOW 

claims that now form part of the GJ claims block.  In August 2010, Teck entered into an 

Option Agreement with NGEx, in the process forming the 51% (Teck) : 49% (NGEx) joint 

venture agreement referred to in Section 2.2.

Eilat Exploration Ltd. ("Eilat") took over the block of ten Spectrum mineral claims 2011, 

with a 10% stake held by Keewatin Consultants (2002) Ltd. ("Keewatin").  An airborne 

magnetic survey was completed in 2012 (flown by Fugro Airborne Surveys). 

On April 14, 2014, the Company entered into a Conditional Asset Purchase Agreement 

("CAPA") with Eilat and Keewatin with respect to the acquisition of a 100% interest in the 

Spectrum claims block.  The Company was granted 100% ownership on October 27, 2014 

(see the Company's news release dated October 27, 2014), following completion of the 

terms of CAPA, which required the Company to issue an aggregate of 80 million common 

shares of the Company at a deemed issue price of C$0.06 per common share.  Sixty four 

million of these shares were issued to Eilat, with the balance (16 million shares) issued to 

Keewatin.

The WILLOW claims were transferred to NGEx by a Bill of Sale registered on 21 March, 

2011, but it was Teck that explored the GJ property from 2011 through 2013.  Teck's work 

included the drilling campaigns summarized on Table 6.11, as well as a considerable 

amount of ancillary studies, including: 

 geological mapping in several areas to augment previous work; 

 a major program of re-logging of historic drillcore; 

 various ground and airborne geophysical surveys; 

 surface soil geochemical studies; 

 an overview of archaeology pertinent to the property; and 

 the collection of material for metallurgical testwork. 

As part of Teck's work, the then existing camp facility was replaced by a more permanent 

facility (Hollis, 2011; Hollis, 2012; Hollis and Bailey, 2013; Hollis, 2014; and Hollis et al.,

6.3 Historical Mineral Resource Estimates 

The QP for this section of this Technical Report is David Thomas, P. Geo. ("QP Thomas").  He 

has not done sufficient work to classify the historical Mineral Resource estimates for Central Zone 

and Donnelly Deposit, presented in the following sub-sections, as current Mineral Resources.  In 

consequence of this, the Company is not treating the historical estimates summarized here as 

current Mineral Resources.  The historical Mineral Resources are, in any event, superseded by the 

2016 Mineral Resource stated in the May 2016 Technical Report for the Central Zone and in the 

April 2016 Technical Report for the Donnelly Deposit.  The 2016 Mineral Resource estimates are 

in turn superseded by the 2017 Mineral Resource updates that are the subject of this Technical 

Report (see Section 14).

6.3.1 1991 Estimates, Central Zone 

Two Mineral Resource estimates were completed in 1991, for what at the time was defined 

as the Central zone, first by Columbia and then by Orcan Mineral Associates ("Orcan"), 

an independent engineering firm, for Columbia-Eurus Corporation.  A subsequent report, 

completed in 1994 by Orcan, was never filed for assessment and it is presumed to be lost. 

The 1991 estimates are summarized on Table 6.12 that was compiled from data contained 

in the May 2016 Technical Report that in turn was sourced from Kilby, Casselman and 

Roberts (1991) and from Saunders and Budinski (1991).  The estimates were classified as 

Inferred, for reasons of 'poor correlation of high-grade gold zones between sections'.   

In QP Thomas's opinion, the 1991 estimates summarized on Table 6.12 do not meet the 

current criteria for Mineral Resource estimation, as defined in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NI 

43-101.  The reader should, therefore consider the Mineral Resources stated on Table 6.12 

with caution, not least as they cannot be relied upon for the reasons described in the 

following Sub-Section 6.2.2.

6.3.2 2003 Review and Estimate, Central Zone 

In 2003, Mining Associates Pty Ltd. ("Mining Associates") was contracted by TPM to 

review the 1991 Mineral Resource estimates and complete a new estimate to JORC Code 

reporting standards.  At the time, TPM was considering listing on the Australian Stock 

Exchange, which requires Mineral Resource estimates to be compiled using the JORC 

code.  JORC is recognized as a Mineral Resource reporting standard by most international 

financial institutions and is accepted by stock exchanges in Australia, London, Hong Kong 

and Canada (under some circumstances).   

Mining Associates (2004) found that Columbia's 1991 estimate was affected by some 

estimation errors as regards vein true widths and grade, as well as a lack of a grade top-cut. 

The average grade estimated by Mining Associates was the same as that estimated by 

Orcan (11.3 g/t Au, at a 5.0 g/t Au grade cut-off) but, at 474,615 t, the quantity of estimated 

Mineral Resources was approximately 20% lower.  Mining Associate's estimate was 

classified as Inferred because of 'poor correlation of high-grade zones between drill 

sections' and because the historic drill data was not validated. 

In QP Thomas's opinion, Mining Associates' 2003 Mineral Resource estimates do not meet 

the requirements of NI 43-101 and cannot, therefore, be relied upon.  This is in part 

emphasized because drilling and geological interpretation completed by the Company 

since its acquisition of the Spectrum claims block in 2014 has shown that:

 the geological models used by the historical operators were over-optimistic with respect 
to the interpreted continuity of high-grade zones; and 

 high-grade intervals are less continuous and are not confined to five discrete 
mineralized panels, as was interpreted by Columbia. 

Instead of a high-grade, narrow-vein type deposit, the Company believes (and QP Thomas 

agrees) that Central Zone is a stockwork or porphyry-style occurrence with a significant 

amount of high-grade material present (see Sections 7 and 8).  It is in consequence of this 

that the updated (2017) Mineral Resource estimate, that is the subject of this Technical 

Report, reflects lower average grades but a much higher tonnage than the historical 

estimates summarized above. 

6.3.3 Donnelly Deposit 

Historical Mineral Resource estimates for the Donnelly Deposit have been reported by 

Mehner and Peatfield (2005); Mehner and Peatfield (2006); Mehner, Giroux and Peatfield 

(2007); and in an NGEx news release dated 07 October 2008 (see the NGEx website news 

release archive for 2008).  These historical estimates are summarized on Table 6.13.

The 2005 estimate was based on drilling to the end of the 2004 exploration season to which 

a manual, sectional polygonal method was applied with intercepts chosen by eye, based 

primarily on copper grades.  Simple polygonal blocks were created around the intercepts 

and distances of influence were chosen arbitrarily, based on drilling density and the 

assumption of good continuity of mineralization between holes.  It should also be 

emphasized that for the 2005 estimate 'it was necessary to assign assumed gold and silver 

grades to TexasGulf samples where none existed' as 'To not do this would cause an 

unacceptably low bias for the overall grades for these two metals in the resource estimate' 

(Mehner and Peatfield, 2005).  Mehner and Peatfield (2005) also state that 'The question 

of in-situ bulk density (or specific gravity) is not fully resolved'.  It is mainly for these 

reasons that, in QP Thomas's opinion, the 2005 estimate does not meet the current criteria

for Mineral Resource estimation, as defined in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NI 43-101.  The 

2005 estimate cannot, therefore, be relied upon. 

The 2006 estimate was based on drilling to the end of the 2005 exploration season.  A 

similar methodology was applied as that summarized above for the 2005 Mineral Resource 

estimate, although slightly different mineralized zones were defined and both Indicated and 

Inferred Mineral Resources were estimated.  Despite this, in QP Thomas's opinion, the 

2006 estimate suffers from the same limitations as the 2005 estimate, with the result that it 

too cannot be relied upon. 

The 2007 estimate was based on drilling to end 2006 exploration season.  Computer-based 

modelling was used to define a three-dimensional solid of the mineralized Donnelly 

Deposit.  Copper and gold grades were interpolated into blocks containing some proportion 

of mineralization by ordinary kriging.  A 'comprehensive program of collecting bulk 

density data was completed on the GJ Project' during the 2005 and 2006 exploration 

programs.  In the opinion of QP Thomas, the 2007 Mineral Resource may be relied upon, 

based on the likely reliability of the underlying data that is assumed to be both accurate 

and valid, as well as the professional status of the reports' authors and the nature of their 

reports. 

Although there is no readily identifiable reason to question the veracity of the 2008 Mineral 

Resource estimate, few technical details are available.  It is in consequence of this that, in 

QP Thomas's opinion, the 2008 Mineral resource estimate should be considered with 

caution as its basis and the applied assumptions cannot be verified. 

6.4 Historical Mineral Reserve Estimates 

To the Principal Author's best knowledge and understanding, no Mineral Reserve estimates have 

been compiled in respect of any mineralization located within the Project Area. 

6.5 Mineral Production 

To the Principal Author's best knowledge and understanding, no formal mineral production has 

taken place on the Project Area.  An unknown quantity of mineralized material was, however, 

extracted by Silver Ridge in the 1970s and 1980 from the 313.5 m of exploration drift and crosscut 

development on the Hawk Vein, as described in Sub-Sections 6.1.2 and 6.1.5.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

David Mehner, P. Geo. ("QP Mehner") is responsible for this Section of this Technical Report.  

Most of the descriptive information presented in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 has been compiled from 

Mehner et al. (2007), the April 2016 Technical Report and the May 2016 Technical Report, with 

minor changes or confirmations derived from recent work by Teck and the Company.  It should, 

however, be noted that much of the published work for the region (for example, Ash et al. [1995, 

1996, 1997a, 1997b], Logan et al. [2000] and Evenchick and Thorkelson [2005]) uses the 

previously accepted 208±7.5 Ma Triassic-Jurassic Boundary assignment of Harland et al. (1990), 

rather than the more recently proposed 200±1.0 Ma designation (see Okulitch [1999] and Pálfy et 

al. [2000]).  For the purposes of the following text, QP Mehner has used the more recent 

chronology.  The Stuhini Group strata and associated intrusive rocks are, therefore, referred to as 

Triassic and the overlying Hazelton rocks as Jurassic in age. 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Project Area is located in the north-east part of the Stikine Arch within Stikine Terrane (or 

"Stikinia") rocks of the Canadian Cordillera.  Figure 7.1 is a regional geology plan, as mapped by 

Souther (1972) and Ash et al. (1995; 1996; 1997a; and 1997b).  
 

7.1.1 Stratigraphy 

The regional stratigraphy may be summarized as follows: 

 Upper Triassic Stuhini Group marine clastic sedimentary rocks (pelagic to fine grained 
wackes with minor volcanic conglomerate, limestone and mafic volcanics); 

unconformably overlain by 

 Lower Jurassic strata (a lower volcaniclastic and derived epiclastic sequence of 
trachyandesite composition overlain by a bi-modal, basalt–rhyolite suite consisting of 

augite-andesite flows, pillow lavas, pyroclastics and derived volcaniclastic rocks 

alternating with felsic flows and pyroclastics); and, to the south, 

 unconformably overlain by a chert pebble conglomerate, grit, greywacke and siltstone 
of the Middle Jurassic Bowser Lake Group (Ash et al., 1997a). 

The Lower Jurassic strata are considered by most to correlate with the (Jurassic) Hazelton 

Group.  Transecting the Upper Triassic to Middle Jurassic assemblage are a distinctive 

suite of massive, flow-banded and locally spherulitic rhyolites and associated pyroclastics 

that have been variously interpreted as Lower Jurassic (Read, 1984) or Upper Cretaceous 

to Lower Tertiary (Souther, 1972) in age. 

Capping the stratigraphy outlined at the higher elevations are Upper Tertiary and Pliocene 

to Recent basalt and olivine basalt flows, commonly (but not always) exhibiting columnar 

jointing.  In the Spectrum claims block, the basaltic sequence is represented by the ca. 7.5 

Ma Mount Edziza Volcanic Complex, which forms a non-columnar basalt cap to the 

mountain on which the Central Zone is located (Figure 7.2).

7.1.2 Intrusive Rocks 

The intrusive rocks in the general Project Area fall within the Stikine Arch structural 

domain, a regional  feature along which Late Triassic-Early Jurassic intrusive and related 

(island arc type) volcanic activity took place.  The intrusives are typically fine to medium 

grained dykes, sills and plutons of Early Jurassic age (Ash et al., 1997b), with compositions 

varying from diorite to granodiorite, monzodiorite, monzonite and syenite.  A U-Pb zircon 

determination of 205.1 + 0.8 Ma for the Groat Stock near the Donnelly Deposit (Friedman 

and Ash, 1997) dates this intrusive as probably Late Triassic and suggests that it is slightly 

older than the presumed lower volcaniclastic sequence in the Hazelton Group, from which 

a U-Pb zircon date of 202.1 + 4.2 Ma was obtained from "…quartz-phyric alkali trachyte 

clasts from the volcanic breccia unit…" (Friedman, 1995, quoted in Ash et al., 1997b).  

This occurrence is on the north side of Ealue Lake, some 12 km northeast of the Groat 

Stock.  Friedman and Ash (1977) also reported a U-Pb age of 203.8 ± 1.3 Ma for the Red 

Stock, which hosts the Cu-Au mineralization at the producing Red Chris Mine to the 

northeast of the Project Area (see Section 23).  More detailed dating information on the 

Groat Stock and its associated mineralization is presented in Section 7.2. 

A sample for radiometric dating was collected from the monzonite intrusion at the Central 

Zone by the B.C. Geological Survey in 2016.  At the time of writing (February 2017) the 

results are pending.  However, this intrusion is interpreted to be coeval with the Groat 

intrusion dykes, based on the similarity of their lithologies and textures. 

A younger intrusive suite includes alkali-granite to felsite dykes that range from a few 

metres to over a kilometre in width and are coeval with felsic volcanics in the upper

rhyolite (181.0 +5.9/-0.4 Ma) within the Hazelton sequence (Ash et al., 1997b).  The 

youngest intrusions in the area comprise mafic dykes associated with Miocene to Recent 

Mount Edziza volcanism. 

7.1.3 Mineralization 

The quartz deficient, alkalic and sub-alkalic intrusive rocks, including the Groat Stock and 

related dykes and sills located in the Project Area, typically have associated Cu-Au 

porphyry and/or precious metal vein systems.  The younger, felsic intrusives are also 

mineralized with finely disseminated pyrite, with or without chalcopyrite, which contains 

elevated copper and gold values.  These sulphides commonly occur in silicified zones 

within the dykes and adjacent country rocks. 

7.2 Property Geology 

Due to its steep topography the Central Zone area is covered by thin deposits of scree or colluvium 

that masks the outcrop.  On the adjoining GJ claims, the gently undulating Klastline Plateau is 

blanketed by thin till deposits (generally less than 5 m) with scree and colluvium developing within 

the steep, deeply incised drainages that cut the margins of the plateau. 

Parts of the Project Area have been mapped by Ash et al. (1997) and Oliver (2015).  The results 

are presented as Figures 7.3 and 7.4.  The Project Area is primarily underlain by Stuhini Group 

strata intruded by various diorite, monzodiorite to monzonite dyke and stock-like bodies.  On the 

east side of the Project Area, the Stuhini Group is unconformably overlain by Lower Jurassic 

Hazelton Group volcanic rocks.  On the west side of the property, Stuhini Group strata are 

unconformably overlain to the west and north by volcanic rocks of the Mount Edziza Volcanic 

Complex.  Porphyry-style alteration and Cu-Au mineralization occur within and adjacent to the 

dyke and stock-like bodies in the Stuhini Group rocks, but not in the Hazelton volcanic sequence. 

7.2.1 Spectrum Claims Block 

Mapping by Oliver in 2015 on the Spectrum claims block defined a 1,000 m to 1,500 m 

thick Triassic volcanic sequence (Stuhini Group) which varies from mafic volcanic and 

sedimentary strata at its base, through a middle sequence of intermediate tuffaceous 

volcanics and culminating in a calcareous sedimentary sequence with minor limestone at 

the top.  Recognized in diamond drillcore, syn-volcanic feldspar-porphyritic intrusions 

occur as dykes and sills within the volcanic stratigraphy and may represent the feeder 

system for the Stuhini volcanics.  Four key units were recognized in the Triassic package, 

from bottom to top, as follows: 

 pyroxene porphyritic mafic flows; 

 finely bedded, well-stratified siltstones, argillites and sporadic ash tuffs; and 

 fine grained plagioclase phyric tuffs with occasional clastic interbeds (a volcanic 
dominant sequence that is the main host of the Central Zone mineralization); and 

 calcareous lithic wackes, volcanic wackes and lesser limestones (a clastic dominant 
sequence that is typically poorly  bedded and transitional to fine-grained plagioclase 

phyric flows near its lower stratigraphic contact).

Stuhini Group volcanics are unconformably overlain to the west and north by 

comparatively flat-lying Miocene and younger volcanic rocks of the Mount Edziza 

Volcanic Complex.  Lower Jurassic Hazelton Group strata have not been identified in the 

area.  However, Stuhini Group volcanics are known to be intruded by north-trending, Late 

Triassic to Early Jurassic dyke-like bodies emplaced along zones of structural weakness.  

Three intrusive phases have been mapped: monzonite; diorite; and granodiorite, the oldest 

of which is thought to be a monzonite dyke intersected by drilling in the Central Zone. 

There are currently no age dates for any of the intrusive suites described above, but they 

are interpreted to be coeval with those identified in the area of the Donnelly Deposit.  A 

sample for radiometric dating was collected by the B.C. Geological Survey in 2016.  At 

the time of writing (February 2017) the results are pending.  Stuhini Group volcanic strata 

and associated intrusives are also cut by less than one to two metre wide mafic dykes 

associated with the Mount Edziza Volcanic Complex. 

7.2.2 GJ Claims Block 

On the east side of the Project Area, Stuhini Group strata comprise a mixture of distal, deep 

marine basin sediments characterized by massive to thinly bedded cherts and graphitic 

cherts interbedded with minor siliceous siltstones, mudstones, feldspathic wackes, rare 

limestone and occasional augite phyric basalt flows over the GJ Zone and eastern portions 

of the Donnelly Zone.  The strata grade to predominantly feldspathic wackes interbedded 

with siltstones, massive to laminated basalt tuff, lapilli tuff and volcanic breccia with 

discontinuous lenses of poorly sorted coarse sandstones to polymictic, pebble and cobble 

conglomerates over the west central portion of the Donnelly Deposit.  These rocks have 

been intruded by the Groat Stock. 

The siltstones vary from buff to light grey and pale green, cherts vary from white to black  

and the wackes vary from grey to brown depending on biotite content.  Radiolarian fauna 

extracted from these fine grained sediments near the southwestern boundary of the Groat 

Stock are Middle(?) to Late Triassic in age (Ash et al., 1997b). 

Conglomerates correlated to the Stuhini Group are reworked mafic to intermediate 

volcaniclastics and siltstones, likely representing debris flows or lahars related to intra-

basinal slumping. Compositions of clasts(?) vary from laminated siltstones to augite 

porphyry basalt to probable andesite or trachyandesite.  Some of these, which Mehner et 

al. (2007) interpreted as correlative with the Stuhini Group, may have been included by 

Ash et al. (1997a; 1997b) in the lower volcanic suite of the Hazelton Group.  The strata 

vary from matrix- to clast-supported, with clasts ranging from millimeter size grains 

through pebbles to cobbles and locally boulders.  The unit is typically light grey to grey-

green. 

The best exposure and thickest occurrence of the conglomerates occurs immediately 

northeast of the North Zone, the location of which is identified in Section 7.7.  Similar but 

much thinner intervals of conglomerate interbedded with siltstones and wackes were 

intersected in drillholes in the central part of the North Zone and throughout the central and 

western portions of the Donnelly Deposit.

The basalt flows are dark grey to green or black.  They appear to be massive, contain augite, 

with or without plagioclase phenocrysts, and are restricted to the GJ Zone and both northern 

and southern limits of the Donnelly Deposit.  They vary from weakly altered and barren to 

strongly altered with quartz-chalcopyrite-pyrite and/or chalcopyrite-pyrite veining. 

The basalt tuffs, lapilli tuffs and volcanic breccias vary from massive, dark grey-green-

black, to thinly bedded dark grey to black with pale green siltstone to feldspathic wacke 

interbeds.  Lapilli and volcanic fragments are generally difficult to identify.  Intervals of 

pyroclastic basal strata are largely restricted to the western half of the Donnelly Deposit. 

Intruding the entire Stuhini Group sedimentary-volcanic stratigraphy are a number of dark 

grey to black, massive, augite phyric basalt dykes that are best exposed in outcrop along 

the banks and bottom of Groat Creek. Distinguishing basalt dykes from flows is highly 

subjective as it is seldom possible to determine whether the unit is or is not conformable 

with the stratigraphy. 

In the area of the Donnelly Deposit, the Stuhini Group strata is intruded by pre- to post-

mineralization sills, dykes and small stocks of the Groat Stock comprised of fine to medium 

grained, equi-granular to rarely porphyritic monzodiorite with minor diorite, quartz diorite 

and monzonite phases. East and south of the North Zone, a large body of post-

mineral Groat Stock outcrops as an elongate, east-west oriented, weakly altered, massive, 

medium grained, quartz-deficient diorite.  Through the North zone, GJ zone and Donnelly 

Deposit, the Groat Stock occurs as numerous fault-bounded, pre- to syn-mineral dykes and 

sills up to 100 m thick that roughly parallel bedding in the host sedimentary rocks. 

The east-west orientation of each of the North, Donnelly and GJ zones along with the east-

west orientation of the post-mineral diorite phase of the Groat Stock is interpreted to be 

controlled by long lived, pre-, syn- and post-mineral, sub-parallel strike-slip faults, possibly 

related to the regional Ealue Lake fault. 

The pre- to syn-mineralized monzodiorite phase of the Groat Stock, the primary 

mineralogy consists of between 25% to 55%, 1.5 mm to 2.0 mm euhedral plagioclase 

phenocrysts and 5% to 20% of similarly sized subhedral hornblende phenocrysts set in a 

very fine grained to aphanitic groundmass composed of anhedral K-feldspar, plagioclase, 

hornblende and/or biotite.  This unit typically has a trachytic texture.  Other intrusive 

phases are very similar and without rock staining, particularly given the intensity of 

alteration, it is often difficult to distinguish them.  So-called diorites tend to have a slightly 

higher mafic content and often a weakly developed felted texture.  Monzonites are typically 

more leucocratic.  The distinctions are subtle and probably not of major significance. 

Table 7.1 provides details of various radiometric dates obtained from rocks and associated 

minerals in the Groat Stock, as compiled from Appendix 16-1 in Bailey, et al. (2014).

Further north, in the QC area, the Stuhini Group strata are comprised of a thick andesitic 

volcaniclastic package overlain by a thick sedimentary sequence comprised of a thin wacke 

– siltstone turbiditic sequence.  This in turn overlain by thick feldspathic wackes to 

conglomerates and well-bedded quartz wackes and siltstones (Devine et al., 2013).   Stuhini 

Group strata has been intruded by a series of sub-vertical, northwest trending diorite, 

monzodiorite to monzonite dykes that are up to 100 m wide and which are emplaced in a 

four kilometre long, east-west oriented structural zone.  Two age dates determined by Teck 

in 2011 and 2012 yielded conflicting results with a U-Pb age of 203.55 ± 0.16 Ma and a 

Re/Os age of 216.1 ± 0.9 Ma.  It is possible the Re/Os age could be suspect due to the small 

amount of sample used in the analysis.  

Unconformably overlying both the Stuhini Group and the Groat Stock are grey to maroon 

volcaniclastics and flows of the Hazelton Group that include black shales, poorly sorted 

andesitic sandstones and debris flows, augite-phyric basalt flows, plagioclase with or 

without hornblende-phyric andesite flows, pyrite-bearing dacite lapilli tuffs, flows and 

high-level intrusives.  They all occur within a flat to shallow, southwest dipping sequence 

that caps the underlying units.  Aside from a few narrow shears that contain minor 

chalcopyrite-pyrite-malachite-chalcocite and the dacitic units which contain up to 4% 

finely disseminated pyrite, Hazelton Group strata are largely unaltered and un-mineralized.  

This is best seen in drillholes at the west end of the Donnelly Deposit and in outcrop at the 

YT showing (the location of which is identified in Section 7.7) where unmineralized, 

unaltered Hazelton Group strata overlie Cu-Au mineralization.  This unconformity, north-

northwest of the Donnelly Deposit, is illustrated in Hollis (2011). 

7.3 Structural Geology 

Rocks throughout the property are affected by large scale, open folding or warping and significant 

high-angle faulting. 

7.3.1 Folding 

Evidence of folding in thick bedded sequences is largely based on observations in the thinly 

bedded sediments where general variations in strikes and dips have been used to infer 

folding.  In the North-GJ-Donnelly Deposit area, dips and strikes within the sediments

differ substantially over short distances.  However, at locations progressively more distal 

from the Groat Stock, bedding consistently strike approximately east-west.  Dips to the 

north are generally between 55º to 75º to the north, while to the south of the Groat Creek 

they are between 55º to 75º to the south.  This change is interpreted to suggest a broad 

anticline, with the Groat Stock localized along the hinge zone.  Further north, in the QC 

area, the strata are moderate to steeply north dipping and disrupted by east-west structural 

breaks, resulting in localized panels of overturned strata.  To the west, in the Spectrum 

claims block, Triassic Stuhini Group strata are gently folded around shallow southwest-

plunging fold axes and dips shallowly to the west and northwest. 

7.3.2 Faulting 

Faulting is widespread throughout the Project Area.  It extends along three principal 

directions with evidence for multiple periods of activity.  In no particular order, the first 

major fault system strikes north-south to north-northeast.  The Central Zone is associated 

with a north-south oriented structural zone.  In the Donnelly and QC areas, faults of this 

orientation post-date emplacement of the intrusive bodies and Cu-Au mineralization.  At 

the east end of the property, in the Wolf area, left lateral movement along these late faults 

is interpreted to have been responsible for the one kilometre offset between the relatively 

massive intrusive outcropping on Wolf Plateau and the more elongate sills and dykes 

observed in the Donnelly-GJ-North zones.  In the Donnelly and North Donnelly Deposits, 

vertical movement appears to dominate along steeply west-dipping normal faults that are 

interpreted to define the eastern margins of a north-trending graben that developed after 

deposition of the Hazelton Group strata.  It is likely the graben is part of the Middle Jurassic 

Eskay Creek Rift (Alldrick, et al., 2004 and 2005) which Alldrick traced north from the 

Eskay Creek deposit to within a few kilometres south of the Project Area.  Late, north 

trending, post Cu-Au mineralization quartz-carbonate and dolomite veins, many with 

significant gold + arsenic + zinc + silver values, are observed throughout the property and 

are believed to be related to this fault system. 

A second generally east-west striking fault system forms a splay off the regionally 

prominent east - north-east trending Ealue Lake fault.  Emplacement of the Groat Stock 

and strike-slip faulting, related to this fault orientation, is interpreted to comprise the 

structural control that gave rise to the stock's elongated shape.  Porphyry Cu-Au 

mineralization at Donnelly and other occurrences related to emplacement of the stock, is 

interpreted to be related to this long-lived, pre-, syn- and post-mineralization fault 

direction. 

The east-northeast oriented fault set is regionally important in that it defines the northwest 

edge of the Bowser Basin (Evenchick and Thorkelson, 2005).  It is especially prominent at 

the Red Chris deposit, where it is represented by the presently active South Boundary fault 

system (Newell and Peatfield, 1995; Rees, et al., 2015).  This fault system follows the 

general trend of the Todagin Creek Valley and lies parallel to and about 19 km southeast 

of the Ealue Lake fault system.  Hollis and Bailey (2013) make the point that the Ealue 

Lake fault system appears to horsetail in the vicinity of the Groat Stock and that 'This type 

of horsetailing is typically accompanied by zones of local dilation that could have been an 

important control on the emplacement of the Groat Stock'.  The east-west orientation is 

also prominent at the QC prospect area where an east-west oriented structural corridor is 

interpreted to have controlled the emplacement of intrusive bodies and porphyry-style

mineralization and alteration.  Further west in the Spectrum area, post mineral east-west 

oriented structures are interpreted to have been responsible for offsets in the north-south 

trending Central Zone; quartz-sulphide veining in the West Creek area occurs along an 

east-west, subvertical orientation. 

Finally, a northwest oriented, steep northeast to southwest dipping structural trend, 

exemplified by the northwest trending fault system and its associated quartz-sericite-pyrite 

alteration, cuts through the Central Zone.  Other north-northwest oriented structures have 

been inferred from air photo interpretations and topographic lineaments, as well as from 

offsets in geophysical and geological data at the south end of the Central Zone and from 

drillholes at the west end of the Donnelly Zone, where Hazelton Group strata appears to be 

down-dropped along these normal faults.  In a lineament analysis in the Spectrum claims 

block area by Oliver and Walcott (2016), one of their conclusions suggested that the three 

dominant structural directions formed under trans-tensional conditions and maximum 

dilation will likely be associated with extensional arrays, particularly northwest and east-

west oriented faults.   

7.4 Mineralization 

The Project Area hosts two principal styles of mineralization that have been the target of past and 

current exploration.  The first and older style is porphyry Cu-Au mineralization related to intrusion 

and alteration by Late Triassic alkalic to sub-alkalic diorite to monzonite dykes and stocks 

exemplified by the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit.  The second comprises later, structurally-

hosted and high-grade gold zones associated with shearing, fracture zones and quartz-carbonate 

vein/fault controlled pyrite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, galena and chalcopyrite hosted by altered 

volcanic units and monzonite dykes. 

7.4.1 Porphyry-Style Mineralization - Central Zone 

Porphyry-style Cu-Au mineralization occurs within a north-south trending, moderately 

west dipping and fault-bounded structural panel of Triassic Stuhini volcaniclastic 

lithologies intruded by syn- to late-mineral monzonite dykes.  Porphyry-style 

mineralization has been defined over a strike length of 1,000 m, with widths of 70 m to 

200 m, it has been tested to 400 m downdip and it remains open along strike and downdip.  

It was intruded by a late, predominantly barren monzonite intrusion at depth evident in 

Section 4900 N and climbing north towards surface by Section 5300 N where it over-prints 

porphyry Cu-Au mineralization. 

Mineralization occurs as quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite with or without magnetite veinlets, 

stockworks, fracture fills and fine grained disseminations of pyrite and chalcopyrite.  Metal 

grades appear to be directly related to the abundance of quartz-sulphide-magnetite vein 

development. 

The majority of monzonite dykes intersected in drilling are weakly mineralized, mainly 

with disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite and with lesser quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite with 

or without magnetite veining.  They are interpreted to indicate intrusion during the waning 

stages of the porphyry Cu-Au mineralizing phase.  Rarely have syn-mineralizing 

monzonite dykes been intersected that show similar degrees of quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite-

magnetite vein development, as found in the surrounding volcanic host rock.  Spatially, the 

well mineralized syn-mineralization monzonite dykes have been intersected more

frequently towards the northern third of the deposit, thereby interpreted to suggest a 

possible zonation.  Rare molybdenite has been intersected to date; bornite is not present.  

No sulphide zonation has been identified to date (February 2017). 

7.4.2 Porphyry-Style Mineralization – Donnelly Deposit 

Of the many porphyry Cu-Au prospects located on the GJ claims block, the most advanced 

is an area measuring 3.5 km east-west and north-south where disseminated, fracture, quartz 

vein and quartz stockwork-controlled pyrite with variable chalcopyrite, rare bornite and 

trace molybdenite mineralization containing elevated gold values occurs.  This area 

contains the Donnelly Deposit, the North Donnelly deposit and the GJ and North zones 

(the locations of which are identified in Section 7.7).  

Typically, the best chalcopyrite mineralization occurs where pyrite is weaker and IP 

chargeability responses are moderate, which generally occurs on the flanks of more intense 

chargeability anomalies.  Secondary magnetite, generally associated with chalcopyrite, is 

found as disseminations, irregular clots, in veins with K-feldspar with or without chlorite 

and/or epidote and/or as fillings in single or sheeted fractures that are one to three 

millimetres thick and millimetres to 10 cm apart.  Exceptions to this association (the 

Donnelly Deposit and portions of the North zone) appear to be where magnetite has been 

altered to hematite. 

Host rocks to all styles of mineralization include: various intrusive phases; basalt tuffs, 

flows and dykes; and sedimentary rocks dominated by wackes.  Where mineralization 

occurs in siltstones or cherts, it tends to be restricted to a few metres laterally from intrusive 

rocks or fault structures, and then only where it is in close proximity to intrusive bodies.  

In wackes and basaltic rocks, the mineralization is largely disseminated with fracture and 

quartz-chalcopyrite-pyrite veins (with or without K-feldspar, magnetite, epidote and/or 

carbonate) constituting a smaller but significant portion.  Where the mineralization occurs 

in intrusive rocks, it is largely confined to a fine- to medium-grained, equigranular 

monzodiorite phase, although mineralized monzonites, crowded feldspar porphyries and 

mafic leucocratic syenite phases have been noted. 

Generally, the style of mineralization is similar to that of the volcanic and sedimentary 

rocks where disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite dominate with fracture and quartz-

chalcopyrite-pyrite veins (with or without K-feldspar and carbonate) constituting a slightly 

smaller percentage.  However, in the 2005 drilling of the Donnelly Deposit, fault-bounded 

intervals of intensely altered intrusive, with up to 55% quartz veining as sheeted veins to 

stockworks, were encountered in a number of drillholes at depth, as well as over the 

western-most two gridlines, covering the last 120 m of the deposit that had by then been 

drilled.  In these zones, sulphides appear to be finer grained, occur equally in the intrusive 

and quartz veins and yield significantly higher Cu-Au-Ag grades. 

Throughout the eastern half of the Donnelly Deposit, most of the chalcopyrite 

mineralization is associated with K-feldspar altered monzodiorite.  In these areas pyrite 

content tends to be low and IP chargeability readings are in the 10 MV/V to 18 MV/V 

range.  Chalcopyrite is generally fine- to medium-grained, allowing for reasonable, visual 

grade estimation.  A very common association with chalcopyrite is secondary magnetite as 

disseminations, irregular clots, in veins with K-feldspar, chlorite and epidote or as fillings 

in single or sheeted veins that are one to three millimetres thick.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

In the western half of the Donnelly Deposit, mineralization is associated with a more 

leucocratic altered monzodiorite with weak argillic and weak to strong phyllic alteration 

(sericite-quartz-clays).  Magnetite has since been altered to hematite; chalcopyrite is fine- 

to very fine-grained and is associated with significant amounts of finely disseminated 

pyrite, often with silica flooding.  In these areas the better Cu grades typically occur where 

chargeability values exceed 18 MV/V. 

Multiple intrusive phases are apparent in and around the Donnelly Deposit and to date 

(February, 2017) it has not been possible to determine which intrusive unit, if any, is the 

principal phase associated with porphyry mineralization.   The mineralization is, however, 

closely associated with strong fracturing and brecciation, which is very common 

throughout the Donnelly Deposit and which is associated with east-west to east-northeast 

striking faults.  The areas of faulting, strong fracturing and brecciation are interpreted as 

zones of weakness that both controlled emplacement of pre- to post-mineral intrusive 

phases and provided conduits for mineralizing hydrothermal fluids. 

7.4.3 Porphyry-Related, Vein-Hosted Mineralization 

The second style of mineralization found on the Project Area comprises higher grade gold 

mineralization that post-dates the porphyry Cu-Au mineralization described above.  It is 

structurally controlled in that it occurs in veins, fracture zones and stockwork crackle zones 

and as gold-bearing quartz-carbonate-sulphide veinlets and stockworks proximal to faults 

and shear zones.  Petrographic work by Oliver (2016) indicates gold is associated with late 

fractures / microveinlets in high sulphide veinlets cutting arsenopyrite, which is one of the 

younger veining events.  Gold also occurs as free gold within strongly fractured and 

strongly chlorite-sericite-calcite-pyrite altered zones with no associated sulphide veining 

but close associations to coarse grained laths of chlorite and sericite, and only a weak 

linkage to secondary K-feldspar or quartz.  Gold mineralization often shows additional 

enrichment of Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, As and Sb. 

The exact timing of the Au event(s) is not known and more than one Au mineralizing phase 

might be present across the Project Area.  It is suggested some of the gold zones are related 

to the later, waning stages of a porphyry system where they overprint and are peripheral to 

porphyry mineralization, while others are significantly later such as the north striking, 

steeply dipping dolomite veins that can be up to two metres wide and contain pyrite, with 

or without arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena, within the Groat Stock and the 

overlying Hazelton Group strata.  The best known example of higher-grade gold 

mineralization on the property is located in the northern two thirds of the Central Zone.  It 

is hosted by intermediate volcanic and volcaniclastic strata of the Stuhini Group and 

crosscutting, north-trending monzonite intrusions. 

Drilling to the end of 2016 on the Central Zone has defined a 665 m long and 40 m to 200 

m wide sub-vertical corridor that has been drill-tested to 400 m below surface and which 

hosts multiple zones of gold mineralization.  The near surface, updip portions of the gold 

zone overprints moderately west dipping porphyry-style mineralization, thereby creating 

wide intersections of typical porphyry-style copper grades, but with elevated gold grades 

and increased concentrations of pathfinder elements As and Sb, with or without Pb and Zn.  

The superposition of a vertical Au zone over a dipping porphyry body suggests a period of 

deformation and tilting that may have occurred after porphyry mineralization and before 

the gold event.

The zone of elevated Au grades in the Central Zone has not been adequately defined along 

strike and it is open both to the north and vertically downdip.  To the south, it is truncated 

by an east-west oriented structure at approximately Section 4625 N, south of which it has 

not been identified by drilling, although its continuation could be expressed by Au-As soil 

geochemical anomalies to the southeast.  Alternatively, it might be related to gold 

mineralization intersected structurally beneath the porphyry Cu-Au mineralization, such as 

in drillhole S16-076 on Section 4525 N.  Additional drilling is required to test these 

hypotheses. 

7.5 Alteration 

The alteration assemblages associated with porphyry-style Cu-Au mineralization found on the 

Project Area are typical of porphyry systems, but become more complicated by features unique to 

each deposit and by later faulting that can juxtapose different alteration assemblages. 

7.5.1 Central Zone 

Figure 7.5 provides a summary of the alteration types found across the Central Zone area.  

The earliest alteration event in the Spectrum Claims block area is pervasive biotite hornfels 

developed within Stuhini Group volcanic lithologies: 

 it is best preserved within the footwall of porphyry-style mineralization, where it is 
pervasive (little of the alteration type remains within porphyry-style mineralized 

mass, except near the north end of the deposit); but 

 it is over-printed by alteration related to the higher grade gold mineralizing event. 

Potassic alteration related to porphyry Cu-Au mineralization forms narrow, diffuse bands 

of K-feldspar with or without disseminated epidote within siltstone units.  This alteration 

is cut by quartz-sulphide-magnetite veining with K-feldspar halos, selective replacement 

of mafic sites by biotite in some intrusive phases and more pervasive disseminated 

magnetite.  The high temperature quartz-sulphide-magnetite veins zone laterally outwards 

to quartz-chlorite-chalcopyrite veins.  

A large proportion of the Stuhini Group volcaniclastics with porphyry Cu-Au 

mineralization is associated with strong pervasive chlorite-epidote-magnetite alteration, 

which is interpreted as alteration of earlier biotite hornfels.  This alteration may zone 

outwards to areas of weaker diffuse and selective chlorite-epidote-magnetite (with or 

without carbonate) replacement.  In the Skarn and South Copper zones (located in Section 

7.7) a calc-silicate alteration has been mapped that may include epidote, diopside, 

tremolite/actinolite, chlorite and magnetite as weak replacements of calcareous volcanic 

wackes and mafic tuffs.  The calc-silicate alteration is gradational with chlorite-epidote-

magnetite alteration.  Quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration, which overprints the earlier 

alteration assemblages, can be expressed either as wide pervasive zones, such as in the 

hangingwall of a prominent northwest-trending structure crossing the Central Zone, as 

metre- to tens of metres-scale patchy and pervasive alteration or as finer, centimetre-scale 

haloes on quartz-pyrite veining.

Alteration associated with the gold mineralizing event overprints the earlier biotite hornfels 

and is centered on discrete zones of gold mineralization.  Alteration varies from centimetre 

scale vein selvages to more pervasive zones up to tens of metres in scale.  Alteration 

zonation around these discrete gold zones can have an inner core of secondary K-feldspar 

and/or silicification, sometimes with patchy epidote and chlorite grading outwards to 

chlorite dominated alteration.  Gold-only mineralization is also associated with zones of 

strong to intense chlorite-sericite-calcite alteration in zones of strong fracturing and 

deformation with no associated quartz-sulphide veining.  In a drillhole intersection on 

Section 4525 N, gold mineralization is associated with iron carbonate veining. 

Quartz-sericite-pyrite and quartz-sericite-chlorite-pyrite alteration post-dates all other 

alteration assemblages.  The distribution of alteration on surface in the area of and 

surrounding the Central Deposit was documented by Oliver in 2015 and is shown on Figure 

7.5.   Overprinting the alteration assemblages associated with both the porphyry Cu-Au 

and structural Au events is pervasive calcite and fine calcite veining and stockworks. 

7.5.2 Donnelly Deposit 

In the area of the Donnelly Deposit, all lithological units are micro-fractured and 

brecciated.  In some drillholes, clasts in brecciated intervals are rounded and strongly 

altered and are reminiscent of hydrothermal breccias.  In siltstones, micro-fractures are 

often filled with fine-grained, grey quartz.  Where the siltstones are within or close to 

mineralization and/or intrusive rocks, they tend to be very hard, silicified and have a 

mottled, cream to grey-green to brown or red brown colouration.  Whether this apparent 

silicification is due to alteration by post-mineral phases of the Groat Stock is unclear.  At 

some localities, siltstones appear to have been altered and recrystallized into what are now 

best termed quartzites. 

Within the mineralized zone, regardless of whether rocks are intrusive or wackes, alteration 

consists of an early, selective pervasive potassic alteration overprinted by later, phyllic and 

propylitic (carbonate) alterations (Petrascience Consultants, 2004).  Potassic alteration 

includes: 

 selective replacement of rims of plagioclase by K-feldspar; 

 K-feldspar–magnetite-chalcopyrite, with or without quartz, epidote, bornite veins 
and/or K-feldspar vein selvages; 

 patchy K-feldspar replacement; 

 replacement of mafic phenocrysts or phases by actinolite or secondary biotite; and 

 secondary biotite envelopes developed along veins. 

Phyllic and propylitic alteration is represented by quartz-sericite, with or without 

carbonate, chlorite, pyrite and/or epidote, which overprints the potassic alteration and 

yields the following textures: 

 selective replacement of plagioclase cores by sericite with or without carbonate; 

 veinlets of quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite with or without carbonate; 

 patchy and disseminated carbonate alteration of plagioclase, biotite and hornblende;

 replacement of secondary biotite by chlorite, with or without carbonate, epidote and/or 
rutile; and 

 magnetite, chalcopyrite and pyrite that is variably rimmed and replaced by hematite. 

More recent work by Teck has confirmed the pattern outlined.  For example, Hollis (2014) 

described the alteration assemblages and their geometry as follows: 

'Several different hydrothermal alteration mineral assemblages occur in the Donnelly 

resource area.  These alteration assemblages typically define a rough pattern of 

zonation that is centered on areas of Cu-Au mineralization.  This pattern of zonation 

is complicated and disrupted by pre-, syn- and post-mineral faults.  These faults impose 

a control on the distribution of these alteration assemblages, and it is common to see 

drastically different alteration assemblages juxtaposed on either side of a fault.  

Similar alteration assemblages and zonation patterns occur in the Donnelly, North 

Donnelly, GJ, and North Zones, which is interpreted to reflect genetic similarities in 

mineralization at all these zones.  Each of the major alteration assemblages that occur 

in the Donnelly resource area are described below'. 

'A potassic assemblage comprised of K-feldspar-biotite ± magnetite ± epidote ± 

chlorite occurs in the central portion of the hydrothermal alteration mineral zonation. 

This alteration assemblage is typically coincident with chalcopyrite-pyrite 

mineralization and significant Cu-Au grades.  This potassic mineral assemblage 

occurs as selective replacement of feldspar and/or mafic phenocrysts, within vein 

selvages, and locally as semi-pervasive to pervasive replacement of host rock 

alteration assemblages that are either vein-controlled or pervasive'. 

'An alteration assemblage comprised of chlorite-sericite ± hematite locally overprints 

potassic alteration zones and also occurs on the flanks of potassic alteration zones. 

This alteration mineral assemblage occurs as selective replacement of mafic 

phenocrysts and as a vein selvage assemblage. The assemblage occurs predominantly 

in the Donnelly, GJ, and North Zones. The chlorite-epidote- sericite ± hematite 

assemblage grades outwards with diminishing epidote and chlorite into an assemblage 

comprised of carbonate-sericite ± chlorite ± hematite. This carbonate-sericite 

assemblage occurs peripherally around the margins of the Donnelly and GJ Zones'. 

'A phyllic assemblage comprised of quartz-carbonate-sericite-pyrite pervasively 

overprints earlier alteration assemblages in the western portions of the Donnelly, 

North Donnelly and GJ Zones.   This alteration assemblage is characterized by intense, 

texturally-destructive alteration that locally totally replaces groundmass and 

phenocrysts. Quartz-sulphide veins that are typically associated with potassic 

alteration are observed to occur within this phyllic alteration assemblage, although 

evidence for potassic alteration minerals that typically accompany these quartz veins 

is inferred to have been overprinted.  This assemblage is also inferred to be grade-

destructive, because portions of the North Donnelly and Donnelly zones that contain 

this assemblage are generally characterized by lower Cu-Au grades.  The prevalence 

of this overprinting alteration assemblage in the western part of the Donnelly and 

North Donnelly Zones is interpreted to reflect a shallower exposure level in this area 

resulting from the NNW-NNE striking normal faults, which down-drop the resource 

area to the west'.

'A propylitic assemblage comprised of chlorite ± epidote ± hematite ± carbonate 

occurs throughout the Donnelly plateau area.  The assemblage is prevalent in the less-

altered rocks that are distal to Cu-Au mineralization.  Most of the unmineralized 

portion of the Groat Stock and adjacent Stuhini Group rocks contain some degree of 

alteration that can be categorized as this sort of propylitic assemblage'. 

 

7.6 Geological Models 

In preparation for the updated Mineral Resource estimates that are the subject of this Technical 

Report (see Section 14), simplified geologic models were prepared for the Central Zone and 

Donnelly Deposit.  The models incorporated lithological descriptions and qua1itative analytical 

data from all the drilling and surface mapping programs, up to and including the Company's 2016 

drilling programs described in Section 10. 

7.6.1 Central Zone  

To generate a geologic model for the Central Zone, interpreted cross-sections were 

simplified into nine domains defined by a group of unique lithologies, one (or more) styles 

of mineralization and/or structurally bound panels.  Using these defined domains, every 

sample interval from each drillhole was then coded by domain number.  The resulting 

database was imported into Leapfrog to generate a three-dimensional model.  The nine 

defined domains are described below and are shown in Figures 7.6 and 7.7. 

Domain 0  

Overburden (scree and/or colluvium) or casing, except in the area of Domain 2a.  In this 

latter case, some holes have exceptionally long lengths of casing, required to penetrate the 

broken rock (weathered scree) of Domain 2a.  For these holes, some of the casing is 

assigned to Domain 2a. 

Domain 1  

This comprises a flat-lying, Miocene basalt of the Mount Edziza Volcanic Complex that 

unconformably overlies the Triassic Stuhini Group assemblage.  Domain 1 does not include 

any Miocene basalt dykes that occur within the Stuhini Group stratigraphy. 

Domain 2 

Triassic Stuhini Group volcano-sedimentary lithologies in the hangingwall of the porphyry 

Cu-Au structural panel (Domain 3).  At the north end of the Central Zone, Domain 2 hosts 

low-grade, gold only mineralization of the 300 Colour zone and rare, high-grade structural 

gold-silver-base metal veining such as in drillhole S16-085. 

Domain 2a 

A rotated slump block (or sackung) of broken, heavily weathered Stuhini Group strata that 

is generally barren but locally has a low-grade, gold only signature.  Domain 2a lies 

towards the north end of the deposit and overlies porphyry Cu-Au mineralization.  Casing 

in several pre-2014 drillholes extended through the sackung such that its base is in places 

somewhat interpretive.

Domain 3 

Porphyry-style Cu-Au mineralization or rock interpreted to have potential to host porphyry 

Cu-Au mineralization.  At the south end of the Central Zone, Domain 3 is a north-south 

trending, moderately west dipping, structurally bounded panel within which porphyry-style 

mineralization can occur.  Host rocks comprise Stuhini Group volcanic and volcano-

sedimentary lithologies intruded by syn- to late-mineralization monzonite dykes.  At the 

north end of the deposit, north of Section 4625 N, the hangingwall of porphyry-style 

mineralization is a west-dipping structural contact.  However, the footwall contact to 

Domain 3 is defined by the 0.1% Cu contour. 

Domain 4 

This comprises porphyry-style, Cu-Au mineralization overprinted by a later, structurally 

controlled gold system (evident as low-level enrichment of As, Sb, Pb and Zn in multi-

element, inductively coupled plasma ("ICP") data from 2014 through 2016).  Domain 4 is 

geochemically defined as that portion of Domain 3, porphyry Cu-Au mineralization that 

has >0.1% Cu with >25 ppm As and >10 ppm Sb.  In pre-2014 drillholes lacking multi-

element analysis, Au:Cu ratios of approximately 2.5 or more define Domain 4.  This 

method is not as accurate as using multi-element ICP data and is subject to revision. 

Domain 5 

Domain 5 is comprised of Stuhini Group volcaniclastic and sedimentary rocks in the 

footwall of Domain 3.  It is host to structurally controlled, higher-grade gold mineralization 

with associated Ag, As, Pb, Zn and Sb enrichment.  

Domain 6 

A monzonite body that post-dates porphyry-style Cu-Au mineralization and whose age, 

relative to the structural gold mineralizing event, is still uncertain.  High-grade, structurally 

controlled gold mineralization can occur in Domain 6, proximal to the margins of the 

intrusive. 

Domain 7 

Domain 7 lies east of Domain 5 and is dominated by siliceous, K-feldspar altered, feldspar 

porphyry interpreted as syn-volcanic sills or larger intrusions with subordinate Stuhini 

Group volcanic rocks.  The contact between Domain 5 and Domain 7 is generally a north-

south trending, steep and west dipping (70) faulted contact, although south of Section 

4850 N the contact has not been defined by drilling and the location is speculative.  Gold 

mineralization is present in Domain 7, but it tends to be discontinuous in nature. 

7.6.2 Donnelly Deposit 

For the purposes of developing the simplified geologic model for the Donnelly Deposit, 

mineralization within two groups, termed Mineralized and Unmineralized, was defined as 

being greater or less than 0.1% Cu, respectively.  A total of six domains were identified: 

Mineralized Intrusive; Unmineralized Intrusive; Mixed Mineralized; Mixed 

Unmineralized; Strong to Intensely Silicified Sediments; and Hazelton Group.  The six 

defined domains are described below and are shown on Figures 7.8 and 7.9.

Mineralized Intrusive Domain 

Mineralized Intrusive has been described from both the Donnelly Deposit and North 

Donnelly deposit.  It is here interpreted to represent the same intrusive unit (although 

possibly different phases).  The Mineralized Intrusive unit is a probable composite 

intrusion dominated by fine-grained to porphyritic, hornblende-bearing monzodiorite to 

monzonite.  Probable altered equivalents include hornblende-feldspar porphyry, syenite, 

hornblende-biotite diorite to diorite and monzonite.  More quartz-rich varieties have been 

described, including quartz monzonite and/or quartz monzodiorite. 

Unmineralized Intrusive Domain 

By definition, intrusive intercepts having less than 0.1% Cu have been assigned to the 

Unmineralized Intrusive Domain, correlated to the younger Groat Stock.  The Groat Stock 

is mapped as very prominent at surface and in sub-surface drillhole intercepts northeast of 

the Donnelly Deposit and to the southeast at the GJ zone (Teck 2011).  A large proportion 

of intrusive material in the sub-surface of the Donnelly Deposit is unmineralized.  

However, it is not interpreted to limit potential for additional mineralization at depth. 

Mixed Domains 

The Mixed Domain comprises two zones, Mineralized (north) and Unmineralized (south), 

extending west along the entire southern contact of the Donnelly Deposit to the contact 

with the overlying Hazelton Group.   They comprise fairly thin intervals of volcanic and 

sedimentary (epiclastic) lithologies intruded by dykes and sills.  They are interpreted to 

comprise both Hazelton Group (i.e. dacites) and Stuhini Group (Mineralized and 

Unmineralized Intrusive).  Individual lithologies identified in drillholes are too thin, 

discontinuous or undergo rapid facies changes such that they cannot be correlated between 

two or more holes and/or sections, with the result that they have been grouped into a 

composite domain. In addition, due to rapid variation between lithologies and their 

respective susceptibility to mineralization, mineralized or non-mineralized units are not 

exclusively contained within their proper domain (i.e. some mineralized units are contained 

within the Unmineralized Domain, and vice versa; some Intrusive intervals are also 

contained within the Mixed Domain, and vice versa).  

The Mixed Mineralized Domain comprises predominantly mineralized, non-intrusive 

intervals that returned analytical results greater than 0.1% Cu.  This domain comprises the 

subordinate southern portion of the Donnelly Deposit and is located in the immediate 

hanging wall of the Mineralized Intrusive Domain, (Note: probably in the hanging wall of 

an east-west fault juxtaposing the two domains) with the Mixed Unmineralized Domain 

outboard to the south.  The Mixed Mineralized Domain appears to thin both east and west 

from the centre of the deposit and is apparently absent west of approximately 424200 E.  

In addition, the domain, as modeled, generally thins with depth. 

The Mixed Unmineralized Domain is lithologically equivalent to the "Mixed Mineralized 

Domain", but is defined as having less than 0.1% Cu mineralization.  It lies south, or 

outboard, of the Donnelly Deposit.  A thin band of Mixed Unmineralized material, along 

the north-central margin of the Donnelly Deposit, partially separates the North Donnelly 

deposit from the Donnelly Deposit.  This represents the westernmost exposure of the Mixed 

Domain north of the Donnelly Deposit.

Strongly to Intensely Silicified Domain 

Silicification ranges from weak to intense (previously described as Chert), variably 

developed in all lithologies, although strong to intense silicification is best developed in 

very fine- to fine-grained volcanic to sedimentary (epiclastic) units. 

Silicification is so extensive over some intervals that the only evidence of the protolith is 

relict ghost banding and/or ghost textures (i.e. interpreted as crystal tuff [or hornblende-

phyric intrusives] or layering [tuffs and/or sediments]).  Such intervals were previously 

interpreted as Chert, however, they are not chemical sediments (i.e. chert - senso stricto).  

Therefore, the previously identified Chert unit comprises, in fact, strongly to extensively 

altered equivalents of host Stuhini Group strata, predominantly volcanic and/or 

sedimentary protoliths.  As such, pending further work to geochemically distinguish 

silicified protoliths from one another, a Strongly to Intensely Silicified Domain is defined 

in the current deposit model. 

The Groat Stock is separated from the Triassic Stuhini Group sequence, including the 

Donnelly zone, by the Strongly to Intensely Silicified Domain.  Strongly to intensely 

silicified strata have been described along the southeast margin of the Donnelly Deposit.  

However, the occurrences are too irregular and/or discontinuous to correlate as discrete 

zones and/or bands.   

Hazelton Group 

The stratigraphic sequence hosting mineralization on the GJ Property is comprised of the 

Late Triassic Stuhini Group unconformably overlain by the Lower Jurassic Hazelton 

Group.  The unconformity is regionally interpreted as a generally flat-lying, weakly 

deformed erosional surface, characterized by a variably developed, rusty weathering 

regolith.  Therefore, the unconformity in the deposit model has similarly been modeled as 

a low relief, erosional surface.  The unconformity has been variably identified in the 

available drill logs, with some specifically noting a possible regolith, whereas others make 

no mention of an unconformity / regolith (if present), possibly interpreting it as a fault.   

The main criteria for distinguishing between Stuhini Group and Hazelton Group strata are 

as follows: 

1. The Stuhini Group is typically altered and commonly weakly mineralized.  Alteration 
is commonly propylitic, consisting of variable chlorite alteration of the matrix and/or 

replacement of mafic phenocrysts.  Variable sericitic alteration of felsic phenocrysts is 

common.   In contrast, the Hazelton Group is typically only weakly altered, generally 

comprised of a ubiquitous purple coloured, hematitic staining. 

2. Dacites and dacitic sub-volcanic intrusives and dykes cross-cutting the Stuhini Group, 
are interpreted to be coeval with the Hazelton Group. 

3. Hornblende-bearing Monzonites, Monzodiorites, together with altered (Hornblende-
Feldspar Porphyry) and quartz-enriched equivalents (Quartz Monzonite to Quartz 

Monzodiorite) are interpreted to be hosted by the Stuhini Group. 

4. "Basalts" are present within both the Hazelton Group (unit HBAS – described as 
undifferentiated flows, dykes, sills and tuffs) and the Stuhini Group (unit BATF – 

described as fine- to medium-grained basaltic tuff, lapilli tuff and volcanic breccia).  

Amygdaloidal Basalts are correlated to the Hazelton Group.  Basaltic Tuff, where

present, is correlated to the Stuhini Group.  Where altered, however, it may be 

misidentified as Andesite and correlated to the Hazelton Group (as unit ANDS – 

described as undifferentiated flows, dykes, sills and tuffs; typically plagioclase ± 

hornblende phyric and/or unit MDRT – described a andesite to microdiorite dykes; 

includes equigranular and hornblende ± plagioclase phyric varieties). 

5. Clinopyroxene-phyric Basalt (PBAS) is a very distinctive unit and has been correlated 
to the Stuhini Group. 

The Donnelly Deposit is interpreted to be strongly fault controlled, exposed at surface over 

1,990 m east-west before passing under younger Hazelton Group cover to the west.  

Emplacement of the Mineralized Intrusive is interpreted to have been controlled by east-

west oriented faults, none of which have been incorporated into the deposit model.  The 

Mineralized Intrusive was subsequently offset across later north-south faults. 

There is reasonable continuity of both Mineralized Intrusive and Mineralized Mixed along 

the east-west axis such that no east-west faults were required to develop the block model.  

North-south faults are interpreted to have significant local offset, with several incorporated 

in the deposit model where the Mineralized Intrusive thins or thickens dramatically, or is 

locally truncated, both along trend and/or at depth.  The deepest hole intersecting 

Mineralized Intrusive is GJK-13-238, which returned 580 ppm Cu between 744.52 m and 

746.52 m downhole (approximately 734 m below surface).  The Donnelly Deposit has, 

therefore, been modelled as a structurally controlled, moderately to steeply, south-dipping 

panel that remains open at depth. 

7.7 Other Mineralized Zones and Occurrences 

Apart from the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit, many other porphyry-style Cu-Au and 

structurally-hosted gold zones and occurrences have been identified across the Project Area.  Some 

were known before the Company acquired the claims blocks that comprise the Project Area, many 

have been examined by the Company and several have yet to be examined. 

At the time of writing (February 2017) the Company was preparing an internal Company document 

detailing the scope of exploration, results and geological characteristics of the various additional 

mineralized zones and occurrences.  Presented here are brief summaries of some of the key 

characteristics of the mineralized occurrences outside the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit. 

7.7.1 North Donnelly Deposit 

The most advanced of the various known mineralized occurrences is the North Donnelly 

deposit.  It is located immediately north of the Donnelly Deposit and is a similar style of 

porphyry Cu-Au mineralization. A Mineral Resource estimate for the North Donnelly 

deposit was published in the May 2016 Technical Report in which the following estimates 

are presented for the 0.2% Cu grade cut-off applied in analysis: 

 Indicated Mineral Resources – 2.77 Mt grading 0.24% Cu and 0.30 g/t Au; and 

 Inferred Mineral Resources – 4.67 Mt grading 0.23% Cu and 0.30 g/t Au. 

No drilling on the North Donnelly deposit has been carried out since the 2016 Mineral 

Resource estimate was published and the mineralization falls outside that portion of the

Donnelly Deposit targeted for exploitation within the scope of the PEA.  It is in 

consequence of this that the North Donnelly deposit is not included within the scope of the 

Mineral Resource updates and PEA presented herein. 

7.7.2 Spectrum Claims Block 

Prospecting and soil sampling completed by the Company in 2015 confirmed the location 

of historic showings identified in Section 6.  Several new occurrences were also found 

around the Central Zone (Stacey et al., 2016), bringing to 13 the total number of 

occurrences that the Company believes have sufficient merit to follow up.  Figure 7.10 is 

the same geology plan as presented as Figure 7.3 above, but with the locations of the known 

mineralized occurrences identified. 

In 2016, ten of the known occurrences were re-examined with additional rock and soil 

sampling and geological mapping to better document the style, extent and controls on 

mineralization and determine their merits for eventual drill testing.  Table 7.2 provides 

brief summaries of the key features of these ten occurrences.

7.7.3 GJ Claims Block 

Comparatively less effort has been expended by the Company on the known mineralized 

occurrences located outside the area of the Donnelly Deposit and North Donnelly deposit, 

due only to the timing of the transfer of the 80 claims comprising the GJ claims block in 

November 2015.  Despite this, field work has been carried out and historical records have 

been examined as part of a preliminary round of interpretation and evaluation of the 

previously identified mineralized occurrences.  Figure 7.11 is the same geology plan as 

presented as Figure 7.4 above, but with the locations of the known mineralized occurrences 

identified.  Table 7.3 provides brief summaries of the key features of eleven of the 

occurrences that the Company has examined thus far.

7.8 Qualified Person's Opinion 

In the opinion of QP Mehner: 

 knowledge of the settings of the deposits, the lithologies and structural and alteration controls 
on mineralization is sufficient to support Mineral Resource estimation; and 

 the mineralization styles and settings of the deposits of interest are sufficiently well understood 
to support Mineral Resource estimation; but 

 other than the North Donnelly deposit, the various prospects and mineralized targets that are 
located on the Project Area are at an early stage of exploration and the lithologies, structural 

and alteration controls on mineralization are currently not sufficiently understood to support 

the estimation of Mineral Resources.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

David Mehner, P. Geo. ("QP Mehner") is responsible for this Section of this Technical Report.  

The Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit are a combination of lower-grade, porphyry-style Cu-Au 

deposits and high-grade gold veins, veinlets, stockworks and shear zones that can contain Ag, As, 

Cu and Zn. The high-grade structures cross-cut and are peripheral to the porphyry-style 

mineralization.  Litho-geochemical studies have shown that the Donnelly Deposit is of the quartz-

deficient alkalic type of porphyry deposit whereas no litho-geochemical studies have been 

completed on the Central Zone. 

Mineralization is spatially and genetically related to Late Triassic to Early Jurassic diorite, 

monzodiorite to monzonite dykes and larger stock like intrusion of alkaline affinity.  Geological 

modeling has shown that porphyry Cu-Au mineralization and the development of syngenetic- to 

late-mineralizing intrusives are strongly influenced by linear structures that provide zones of 

structural preparation for hydrothermal alteration, mineralization and the intrusion of dykes, sills 

and stocks. 

8.1 Characteristics of Porphyry Deposits 

Porphyry deposits are typically large, low- to medium-grade deposits in which the mineralization 

is usually structurally controlled, and both genetically and spatially related to felsic-intermediate 

porphyritic intrusions (Figure 8.1).  They differ from other granite-related deposits, such as skarns 

and mantos, by virtue of their large size and distribution of mineralization in stockworks, 

veins/vein sets, fractures and breccias (Sinclair, 2007), rather than as irregular replacement masses.  

The range of primary commodities present in porphyry deposits typically includes combinations 

of Au, Ag, Cu, Mo and Sn. 

8.1.1 Tonnages and Average Grades 

Porphyry deposits typically contain millions to billions of tonnes of mineralized material.  

Although higher grade zones are typically developed, average base metal grades are 

generally less than one percent (production grades for B.C. porphyry Cu-Au type deposits 

are typically less than 0.5% Cu) whereas average gold grades in porphyry Cu-Au deposits 

typically vary between approximately 0.2 g/t to 2.0 g/t Au (Sinclair, 2007).  The Central 

Zone and Donnelly Deposit are no exceptions to this - at the grade cut-offs applied in 

analysis and for the volumes of mineralized material targeted for openpit mining within the 

scope of the PEA (see Section 16):   

 the average diluted copper grades approximate to 0.12% Cu from the Central Zone and 
0.35% in the Donnelly Deposit; and 

 due to the presence of high-grade, cross-cutting and fracture-hosted gold mineralization 
in the material targeted for exploitation from the Central Zone, the average diluted gold 

grade approximates to 0.85 g/t Au; whereas 

 the average diluted gold grade of the material targeted for exploitation from the 
Donnelly Deposit approximates to 0.35 g/t Au. 

Despite their typically modest average grades, individual porphyry-type deposits can in 

three dimensions be substantial (Sinclair, 2007) and therefore contain substantial quantities 

of metal.  It is because of this and because the grades can be consistent and reliable

compared with other intrusion-related deposits that, as a rule, porphyry-type deposits are 

economically desirable, especially if openpit mining is feasible and stripping ratios are low.

8.1.2 Morphology 

The overall morphology of individual porphyry deposits is highly variable: they may form 

irregular, oval, solid or even hollow cylindrical and inverted cup shapes around the tops of 

porphyry intrusions (Sinclair, 2007).  Economic mineralization usually occurs in isolated 

masses within larger porphyry districts, but they may also be composed of two or more 

superimposed (or stacked) zones of mineralization within a single deposit.  When porphyry 

systems are superimposed, average grades tend to be markedly higher than in isolated 

systems, due to the fact that multiple pulses of mineralization occur over time in the same 

volume of rock.  Porphyry deposits are commonly zoned in three dimensions, often with 

barren cores and roughly concentric metal zones that are surrounded by barren pyritic 

haloes, with or without peripheral base- and/or precious-metal veins. 

8.2 Porphyry-Style Mineralization 

Porphyry-style mineralization tends to be concentrated around the top (or cupola) of sub-volcanic 

intrusions that are ultimately sourced from a larger magmatic body at depth (Figure 8.1).  The tops 

of these intrusions are emplaced at mid- to upper-crustal levels and the intrusive body usually 

extends several kilometres downwards where it may or may not be contiguous with the parent 

pluton or batholith.  Fractional crystallization in the parent magma causes incompatible metallic 

elements such as gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum and tin (among others) to be 

concentrated in hydrothermal fluids that collect in the cupola of the high-level intrusions. 

Brittle deformation (e.g. fracturing) causes a release of the metal-charged fluids into the 

surrounding rock, resulting in the formation of mineralized breccias, stockworks and vein sets 

around and within the host intrusion.  Brittle deformation may occur as a result of local- to 

regional-scale tectonic deformation (e.g. faulting or shearing) or through fluid over-pressure 

(hydraulic fracturing) in the cupola of the intrusion.  Regardless of the mechanics of brittle 

fracturing, metallic minerals are probably deposited due to a rapid loss of confining pressure, 

which in most cases greatly reduces the solubility of metals in hydrothermal fluids. 

8.3 Porphyry-Related, Vein-Hosted Mineralization 

The various types of epithermal, vein-hosted deposits suggested by Figure 8.1 are intimately 

associated with porphyry systems, in that the fluids that form high-level veins are ultimately 

sourced from the same intrusions responsible for porphyry mineralization at deeper crustal levels 

(Taylor, 2007).  In the case of high-sulphidation, lode-type epithermal veins, mineralization may 

be peripheral to, or superimposed on, older and lower-grade porphyry style mineralization.   

Vein-hosted mineralization is often zoned in the vertical dimension, in that they contain 

comparatively more precious metals at higher structural levels and comparatively more base 

metals at deeper levels (Taylor, 2007).  Intermediate- and high-sulphidation veins occur at higher 

structural levels above the porphyry system and tend to be enriched in precious metals compared 

with low-sulphidation veins. 

The emplacement of lode-style and epithermal veins is probably controlled by local structures such 

as faults, shears, and fracture zones, which are typically located along zones where bedrock 

undergoes a change in rock competency.  Competency contrasts usually exist along lithological 

boundaries (for example, bedding and dykes) or in altered areas such as zones of silicification.  

These structures may have formed prior to, or contemporaneous with, the emplacement of the 

porphyry intrusion(s) and their orientations are likely controlled by local stress regimes existing at 

the time of their formation.

9 EXPLORATION 

David Mehner, P. Geo. ("QP Mehner") is responsible for this Section of this Technical Report.  

The presented information has been compiled from the April 2016 Technical Report, from internal 

Company documents and from an assessment report for the 2016 field season on the GJ claims 

block (Walcott, 2016; Russell and Baxter, 2017).  At the time of writing (February 2017), the 

assessment report for the 2016 field season on the Spectrum claims block was being prepared, 

despite which the Company provided QP Mehner with all information required to complete the 

following text. 

9.1 Summary of Programs 

The majority of the Company's exploration efforts across the Project Area have been in the 

Spectrum Claims Block.  This is due only to the timing of the Company's acquisition of the GJ 

claims block in November 2015, which limited the Company's exploration efforts to a single field 

season.  Despite this, prospecting, rock and soil sampling programs were carried out in addition to 

the drilling program described in Section 10.   On the Spectrum claims block and from September 

2014 to the close of the last field season in October 2016, the Company has completed: an airborne 

LiDARTM topographic survey and lineament analysis; geological mapping; prospecting; soil and 

rock geochemical sampling; an IP geophysical survey; and a ground magnetics geophysical 

survey. 

9.2 LiDARTM Survey and Lineament Analysis 

An airborne LiDAR™ survey was flown on October 3, 2015 by Eagle Mapping Limited of Port 

Coquitlam, B.C.  LiDARTM, short for Light Detection and Ranging, is a topographic survey 

method that maps the ground surface to a few centimetres accuracy.  The survey area included the 

entirety of the Spectrum claims block and a strip extending southward along a potential access 

route to Highway 37 (Figure 9.1). 

Prior to the LiDARTM survey, the most up-to-date topographic maps (the B.C. provincial 

Geographical Survey Branch's Terrain and Resource Inventory Maps ["TRIM"]) had 20 m contour 

intervals.  With such a large contour interval, many of the cliffs and other topographic features 

were not visible.  This has an impact on exploration targeting because topographic variations 

frequently reflect underlying structural features that may be mineralized.  With the new LiDARTM 

data, the Company was able to complete a lineament analysis over the Central Zone and 

surrounding areas, and in the process identify a number of interpreted structures associated with 

the underlying fault geometry (Oliver and Walcott, 2016).  The key findings of the lineament 

analysis included:  

 determination of the dominant lineament trends associated with mineralization and elevated 
gold values in soil (northwest-southeast, north-south, and east-west lineaments), 

 identification of lineaments interpreted to post-date the mineralization event and are, therefore, 
not prospective for copper-gold mineralization (northeast trending faults of Neogene age); and  

 interpretation of Triassic fault structures to be associated with mineralization formed under 
sinistral, trans-tensional conditions that correspond to the Reidel model of brittle failure (trans-

tensional conditions allowed for maximum dilation along northwest-southeast, north-south, 

and east-west trending structures, which were subsequently exploited by monzonite intrusions 

and hydrothermal fluids).

9.3 Geological Mapping 

Over a 14 day period in late June and early July, 2015, the area around the Central Zone was 

mapped in detail by Dr. James Oliver of Oliver Geoscience International Ltd.  Bedrock lithology, 

alteration, mineralization and structural features were recorded at over 700 location points.  A 

series of 1:5000 scale interpreted lithology and alteration maps were produced that were used, in 

part, to help direct exploration drilling and prospecting activities in 2015 and 2016.  The results of 

the 2015 mapping program are presented in Sub-Section 7.2.1. 

9.4 Prospecting and Rock Sampling 

Prospectors and geologists were tasked by the Company with identifying and locating surface 

expressions of mineralization, including gossans, veins and mineralized float.   GPS co-ordinates 

and the salient features of the mineralized occurrences were recorded in field notebooks.  Where 

possible, a grab- or chip-sample was obtained for assay. 

For clarity the term 'grab sample' refers to prospecting samples of rock, collected in a random or 

irregular manner, that appear to the sampler to be prospective.  Chip samples comprise small pieces 

of rock taken from across the width of a mineralized outcrop.  Assays for chip samples are reported 

as grade over interval – for example, x g/t Au over y metres.  Chip samples can range from less 

than a metre to several metres in length.  

Implicit in the types of samples outlined is that they may not be indicative of the overall grade of 

the mineralization being sampled.  They are collected merely to establish if the elements of interest 

are present or not.  There is no attempt in their collection to establish overall grade, width or 

continuity of the occurrence being sampled so there is no guarantee that the results can be inferred 

for the whole mineral occurrence or body of rock being sampled. 

Grab and chip samples typically weigh between 1 kg and 5 kg, broken from mineralized outcrop 

or subcrop with a hammer and sealed in poly sample bags with a unique identifying sample 

number.  Rock samples were shipped to an analytical laboratory for gold and multi-element 

geochemical analysis.  No standards or duplicates were inserted into the Company's grab sample 

stream, but internal laboratory QA/QC results indicate no issues with the analyses.  Activation 

Laboratories Ltd. ("ActLabs", ISO 9001 and 17025 accredited) of Kamloops, B.C. was used in 

2015, ALS Chemex ("ALS", ISO 17025 accredited) of North Vancouver, B.C. was used in 2016: 

 gold was determined by ActLabs using the 50 g fire assay method with an Atomic Absorption 

Spectrophotometry ("AAS") finish, samples reporting over-detection limit results for gold 

(>10 g/t Au) were re-run using 50 g fire assay with a gravimetric finish; 

 ActLabs determined other elements by inductively coupled plasma optical emission 

spectrometry ("ICP-OES"), samples reporting values greater than 10,000 ppm for Cu, Pb or 

Zn and 100 ppm for Ag were re-run using four acid digestion with an AAS finish; 

 ALS used the 50 g fire assay with AAS analysis for gold (samples reporting values greater 

than 10 g/t Au were re-run using 50 g fire assay with a gravimetric finish); and 

 ALS used 0.5 g aqua regia digestion with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission 

spectrography ("ICP-AES") for multi-element analysis (samples reporting values greater than 

10,000 ppm for Cu, Pb or Zn and 100 ppm for Ag were re-run using four acid digestion with 

an AAS finish).

Between June and October 2015, an area of approximately 4.5 km2 was prospected around the 

Central Zone, including all the showings identified in Section 7.2.2.  A total of 379 grab and chip 

samples were collected from mineralized bedrock, subcrop and float material.  An additional 776 

grab and chip rock samples were collected from June to September, 2016, covering an area of 

approximately 1.0 km2 on the Spectrum claims block and approximately 3.4 km2 on the GJ claims 

block.  Figures 9.2 and 9.3 summarize the distributions of the 1,155 chip and grab samples 

collected by the Company in 2015 and 2016 across the Spectrum claims block (Figure 9.2) and 

across the GJ claims block (Figure 9.3).  Table 9.1 provides a summary of the results.

Prospecting during the 2015 season was successful in confirming and locating mineralized 

showings described in historical assessment reports.  A number of new showings were also 

identified.  Rock sampling and mapping/description of showings resulted in better understandings 

of the mineral assemblages and metal ratios of mineralization located outside of the Central Zone.  

It was in consequence of this that several mineralized showings were designated as high-priority 

targets for follow-up, due to their potential for high-grade Au or bulk-tonnage Cu-Au 

mineralization. 

Prospecting during the 2016 season was successful in confirming the locations of showings 

identified in historical assessment reports, as well as helping to clarify and improve the 

understanding of the showings to determine whether additional work is required.  On the west side 

of the property, prospecting and chip sampling in 2016 also advanced the understanding of the 

style, distribution and controls on mineralization of the targets leading to drill testing three new 

areas (West Creek, South Copper and Skarn).  Prospecting also located new mineralization 

suggestive of buried Cu-Mo porphyry mineralization to the west of the Far West target.  The targets 

outlined in 2015 (Stacey et al., 2016) that were not examined in 2016 still require additional 

mapping and sampling.  On the east side of the property, the Company carried out an initial 

examination of historic showings to confirm their locations and to both clarify and improve the 

understanding of the showings, as well as to determine whether additional work is required. 

9.5 Soil Sampling 

The Company has carried out three soil sampling programs: 

 in October 2014, 36 soil samples were collected in the area of the East Creek and Hawk Vein 
showings;  

 from late June to mid-October, 2015, a total of 2,982 soil samples was collected over an area 
of approximately 3.75 km2 - the sampling program was designed to confirm historical results 

and fill-in sampling gaps; and 

 from early June to mid-September, 2016, a total of 824 soil samples was collected from five 
areas covering approximately 2.7 km2 – the purpose of the program was to confirm historical 

results, fill-in sampling gaps and expand current soil sampling coverage around selected 

mineralized showings.  

The locations of the various soil samples are identified on Figures 9.4 and 9.5, along with the 

elemental signatures of the various showings.  Table 9.2 provides a summary of results.

In 2015, soil grids were designed using a GIS mapping program (MapInfo-Discover) to generate 

ideal UTM grid co-ordinates for each sample.  Grid lines were drawn in the E-W direction, with 

optimum sample spacing of 25 m and a line spacing of 50 m.  The points were then up-loaded to 

a hand-held GPS so that field workers could navigate to the location at site.  In 2016, depending 

on the area and objective of the soil sampling, soil samples were collected either using the same 

grid method as was used in 2015 or as ridge-and-spur reconnaissance sampling lines with 25 m 

and 50 m sample spacings.  Soil sampling in the Far West target area had to be modified due to 

extensive barren Miocene-aged basalt boulder talus and scree cover.  In this area, soil samples 

were collected from lines that were located on both sides of hillside drainages that cut below the 

basalt talus to expose soils sourced from the underlying Triassic target lithologies. 

Soil samples were collected from the "B" soil horizon using a shovel or mattock and placed in 

kraft paper soil sample bags.  The bags were labeled with a unique sample number and the 

corresponding sample identification tag was sealed inside the bag.  At each sample station, the 

sample UTM co-ordinates, sampler, sample depth, soil horizon, soil colour and composition, 

moisture content, and vegetative cover were recorded on field paper, for later computer database 

entry.  Samples were air dried at camp, packed into large poly sample bags and sealed for delivery 

to the analytical laboratory for gold and multi-element geochemical analysis.  ActLabs was used 

in 2015, ALS was used in 2016.  Both laboratories used the same analytical methods as described 

in Section 9.4 for the Company's 2015 and 2016 rock sampling programs, although 30 g fire assays 

were employed rather than the 50 g fire assays used for rock samples. 

The 2015 soil sampling program was successful in defining geochemical anomalies associated 

with the various known showings on the property, and identified a number of new anomalies for 

follow-up in 2016.  Modern multi-element soil geochemistry has provided better information about 

metal ratios in soils.  It has also been useful for determining the type of mineralization that may 

underlie anomalous areas (e.g. porphyry Cu-Au, porphyry Cu-Mo and/or polymetallic veins).  The 

2016 soil sampling program was successful in that:

 on the west side of the property, it outlined a new area of Au-As (with or without Ag-Cu-Pb) 
enrichment in two parallel, linear anomalies trending 600 m northeast from the JO showing; 

 combined with prospecting, it extended the Far West Cu-Mo prospect by 250 m to the west; 

 in the Gordon Area, sampling defined a 500 m long Au-Ag-As-Pb-Zn soil anomaly that 
coincides with the southwest projection of a 25 m wide, recessive saddle hosting less than 1 m 

wide quartz-galena-sphalerite veins; 

 1,000 m southeast of the main Gordon showing, sampling followed up 2002 elevated soils and 
rock geochemistry outlining a 500 m by 800 m area of Au-Ag-As-Cu-Pb-Zn soil enrichment 

that will require additional work to assess its significance; and  

 two elevated Ag-Pb-Zn samples identified an area to the east of West Creek-GR that will 
require additional soil sampling and prospecting to assess its significance. 

9.6 Induced Polarization Geophysical Survey 

From June 21 to July 9, 2016, Peter E. Walcott and Associates of Vancouver, B.C., carried out an 

IP geophysical survey over the known Central Zone limits, as well as the southern projection of 

porphyry Cu-Au mineralization.  The survey was performed over a north-south distance of 975 m 

on six, approximately 2.5 km long, east-west oriented grid lines spaced 200 m apart from geology 

Section 4325N to 5300N, as well as one reconnaissance grid line for a total of 16.7 line kilometres.  

The survey utilized a pole–dipole / dipole-pole survey method with a 100 m dipole separation and 

a maximum n separation of 19.5, giving a resolution to approximately 450 m depth.  Survey station 

locations were determined using a Garmin GPSmap 60CSx handheld instrument. 

The IP data was provided as Apparent Resistivity and Apparent Chargeability pseudo-sections at 

1:10,000 scale.  Two-dimensional and three-dimensional inversion models were also created using 

the Geotomo RES2DINV and RES3DINV algorithm.  Key findings of the survey include: 

 porphyry-style mineralization with higher grade gold mineralization overprinting in the 
northern two thirds of the deposit (Domains 3 and 4) are located on the western flanks of an IP 

chargeability high (see Figure 9.6); 

 southern extension of porphyry style Cu-Au alteration and mineralization associated with 
weaker elevated chargeabilities; 

 a higher-grade gold corridor lies in an area of low resistivity that can be traced across the 
survey area (see Figure 9.7); and 

 the 300 Colour zone associated with a deeper, northwest trending, high chargeability feature 
(see Figure 9.8). 

The results demonstrate that IP geophysics is a useful exploration tool for identifying mineralized 

zones and bodies on the Project Area.  In QP Mehner's opinion, the IP survey should be expanded 

to the south, north and west of the presently covered area, to test for adjacent or contiguous 

mineralization.

9.7 Ground Magnetic Geophysical Survey 

From September 12 to September 18, 2016, a ground-based magnetometer survey was carried out 

over a limited area south of the Central Zone, to: 

 cover an area deemed prospective for hosting the southern continuation of porphyry-style Cu-
Au mineralization; and 

 to define the magnetic signature of the alteration (and associated mineralization) as it would 
aid in tracing perspective geology through overburden covered areas and help rank and 

evaluate soil and rock geochemical targets. 

Drilling of porphyry Cu-Au mineralization on the south end of the Central Zone had previously 

identified a strong association with magnetite.  It was on the basis of this association that the 

Company undertook the magnetic survey.  

The survey was carried out over 44.6 line kilometres by Peter E. Walcott and Associates of 

Vancouver, B.C., utilizing a two-person crew, two GSM-19 Overhauser rover magnetometers 

equipped with GPS guidance and a GSM-19 proton precession base station magnetometer, both 

manufactured by GEM Instruments of Richmond Hill, Ontario.  These instruments measure 

variations in the total intensity of the earth's magnetic field to an accuracy of one nanotesla.  The 

survey was undertaken on northwest-southeast oriented grid lines spaced 50 m apart.  Readings 

were taken at one second intervals along the grid lines.   

The ground-based magnetometer data was combined with magnetic susceptibility measurements 

from surface outcrops and downhole measurements to produce an inversion model for the survey 

area.  The magnetic data was modelled using the Geosoft VOXI earth modeling platform, which 

is a cloud-based service that allows users to rapidly conduct three-dimensional inversions of 

potential field data such as magnetics and gravity.  It allows constraints to be applied based on 

ground and drillhole observations in three-dimensional space.  Figure 9.9 provides an example of 

the results. 

The 2016 magnetic survey was successful in indicating areas of higher magnetic signature 

associated with drillholes intersecting porphyry Cu-Au alteration and mineralization within a panel 

of elevated magnetics.  This extends 450 m south from current drilling, thereby defining a corridor 

of potential porphyry-style alteration that links soil and rock geochemical anomalies of the South 

Copper target with the area of known porphyry-style mineralization and alteration at the south end 

of the Central Zone.  The results demonstrate that ground magnetics is a useful exploration tool 

for identifying mineralized zones and bodies on the Project Area.  In QP Mehner's opinion, 

magnetic surveys should be expanded to include a detailed ground based survey of the remainder 

of the Central Zone, as well as peripheral targets to the west and east of the Central Zone.

9.8 Exploration Potential  

Potential exists to increase the known extent of the mineralizing systems within the Central Zone 

area, because: 

 the porphyry-style mineralization remains open along strike and at depth; and 

 the porphyry-related, vein-hosted zone of elevated Au grades has not been adequately defined 
along strike and is open to the north and vertically downdip.   

Potential also exists to increase the known extent of the mineralizing system associated with the 

Donnelly Deposit; 

 the structurally controlled, moderately to steeply, south-dipping mineralized panel remains 
open at depth; and 

 it is immediately adjacent to or contiguous with the North Donnelly deposit that is under- 
explored. 

Additional drilling is in both cases required to better define the extent of the mineralization and, 

in the case of the Central Zone, to establish whether adjacent mineralized zones such as the 300 

Colour and South Copper zones are extensions of, or separate from, the currently defined Central 

Zone.  Geological mapping, drilling, additional soil sampling and additional geophysical surveys 

are also required to better define the mineralization outlined for the many other porphyry-style Cu-

Au and structurally-hosted gold zones and occurrences listed in Section 7.7. 

9.9 Qualified Person's Opinion 

In the opinion of QP Mehner:  

 the exploration programs completed to date are appropriate to the style of the deposits and 
prospects located within the Project Area; 

 the results of exploration work to date support the interpretations of the deposits; and 

 the Project Area contains significant exploration potential (and the Company has planned 
additional work).

10 DRILLING 

The Principal Author is responsible for this section of this Technical Report.  As part of a larger 

due diligence process he cross-referenced information contained in the April 2016 and May 2016 

Technical Reports with the Company's drillhole database, and plotted the collar positions and drill 

strings using ArcGIS to ensure they intersected the Central Zone or Donnelly Deposit, as 

appropriate.  It is the validated data relating to the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit that is 

presented here, because it is the mineralization contained therein that is the subject of the 2017 

Mineral Resource updates and PEA presented in this Technical Report.  Summaries of drilling 

activity on the other zones and mineralized occurrences located on the Spectrum-GJ Project Area 

are presented in Section 6.  Brief summaries of the characteristics of the various other zones and 

occurrences are presented in Section 7.7. 

10.1 Historical Drilling Programs 

Prior to the Company acquiring the claims blocks that comprise the Project Area, 91,234.45 m of 

diamond drilling had been completed by previous operators in 407 drillholes.  These totals do not 

include three holes (325.83 m) that were reported to have been drilled into the Horn Silver prospect 

in 1965, but for which no detailed information is available (with the result that the three holes do 

not appear in the Company's drillhole database). 

The historical database relating to the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit comprises: 

 80 holes (10,425.67 m) drilled on the Central Zone, including the 500 Colour, HC, Porphyry, 
33 and Skarn zones that were separately identified in historical records (but which are now 

considered to be part of the Central Zone); and 

 168 holes (44,338.37 m) drilled on or into the Donnelly Deposit. 

Table 10.1 summarizes the various historical drilling programs relating to the Central Zone and 

Donnelly Deposit.  Table 10.2 (that is in two parts due to its overall length) provides a summary 

of the collar locations, azimuths, dips and lengths of the drillholes located on the Central Zone. 

Table 10.3 (that is in three parts due to its overall length) provides a summary of the same 

information as Table 10.2, but for the Donnelly Deposit.

10.1.1 Drillers and Drilling 

No information is available concerning drilling contractor employed for Imperial's four 

hole program in 1973.  This does not represent a limitation as regards the Company's 

database because Imperial's holes were excluded for the reasons described in Sections 11.5 

and 12.4. 

The 1977 TexasGulf drilling program was carried out by D.W. Coates Enterprises Ltd 

utilizing a Longyear 38 with BQ diameter coring equipment.  Consolidated Silver Ridge 

Mines' ("Silver Ridge") 1979 drilling program was carried out by D.J. Drilling Company 

Ltd. of Surrey, B.C., again using BQ diameter equipment.   In 1980, Longyear Canada 

carried out both TexasGulf's and Silver Ridge's programs, the former using BQ diameter 

equipment and the latter using NQ diameter equipment. 

Cominco's 1989 diamond drilling program was completed by Falcon Diamond Drilling 

Ltd. of Prince George, B.C., utilizing BTW equipment.  CGH's 1990, 1991 and 1992 

drilling programs were completed by J.T. Thomas Diamond Drilling Ltd. of Smithers, 

B.C., with a hydraulic JT-600 diamond drill in 1990 (BQTK equipment) and a Longyear

Super 38 drill in 1991 and 1992 (NQ2 equipment).  Helicopter support in 1991 was by 

Northern Mountain Helicopters with a Hughes 500D and Bell 205 helicopter.  Helicopter 

support in 1992 was by Vancouver Island Helicopters with a Hughes 500D. 

Ascot's 1990 program, as well as CGH's 2004 program, were carried out by Falcon 

Drilling Ltd. of Prince George, B.C., using a helicopter portable, Falcon 1000 fly rig to 

recover BTW size core.   CGH's programs in 2005, 2006 and 2007 were carried out by 

Britton Brothers Diamond Drilling Limited of Smithers, B.C., using two 2500 fly rigs 

recovering NQ2 (or NQTK) diameter core. 

10.1.2 Collar Co-ordinates 

Limited information only is available concerning the procedures used to locate individual 

drillholes during the historical drilling programs on the Central Zone.  Maps of drillhole 

locations are, however, available.  Company geologists used this data to locate and verify 

individual collar positions in the field, the latter using a DGPS device.  Collar elevations 

were checked by Company geologists using the LiDARTM survey results summarized in 

Section 9.2 (see also Section 12.2). 

No information is available concerning the procedures used to locate individual drillholes 

during TexasGulf's 1977 and 1980 drilling programs.  During Ascot's 1990 program, 

individual drillhole collars were tied into a picket-line grid using hip-chain and compass.  

During CGH's 2004 through 2007 drilling programs, individual drillhole collars were 

surveyed by differential GPS at the end of the program by Steve Soby of Ranex Exploration 

Ltd.  The collars of the holes drilled by Teck in 2011 and 2013 were surveyed following 

completion of the drilling programs, using a differential GPS unit. 

In 2014, as part of a wider data verification process, Company geologists identified a total 

of 44 historical drillhole collars in the field and individually surveyed them using a GPS 

instrument.  The positions of the 36 drillhole collars that could not be located in the field 

were estimated by establishing the mean difference between the original and re-surveyed 

positions of the 44 drillhole collars that could be located in the field and applying this to 

plan positions of the 36 drillhole collars that could not be located in the field (see also 

Section 12.3).  In each case and where possible, collar elevations were checked by 

Company geologists using LiDARTM. 

10.1.3 Downhole Surveys 

A Sperry-Sun single-shot photographic instrument was used for downhole surveying 

during TexasGulf's 1977 and 1980 drilling programs, which provided azimuths and dips.  

Casing in holes TG-77-04 (extended in 1980) and TG-80-12 to -15 is reported to have been 

left in place.  Downhole surveys were completed during Silver Ridge's 1979 and 1980 

programs and Cominco's 1989 program, but the method or methods used are not reported 

in the available records.  In 1990, CGH utilized acid downhole dip tests and in 1991 a 

Sperry-Sun single-shot photographic instrument.  No mention is made in available records 

as to whether CGH completed downhole surveys in 1992.    Ascot's single 1990 hole was 

downhole surveyed with a Sperry Sun photographic instrument, which recorded azimuths

CGH's 2004 downhole surveys were carried out using a Sperry Sun instrument for the first 

eleven holes; acids tests were used thereafter for dip measurements.  During CGH's 2005,

2006 and 2007 programs, downhole surveying was carried out by the drillers using a reflex 

survey tool at the completion of each hole.  Readings were taken every 80 m to 140 m in 

shorter holes and every 200 m in deeper holes. 

Downhole surveys during Teck's 2011 and 2013 programs were carried out during the 

drilling of each hole and by the drillers, using a Reflexid tool.  Readings were usually taken 

every 50 m. 

10.2 The Company's Drilling Programs 

Since acquiring the claims blocks that comprise the Project Area, the Company has completed 

three diamond drilling programs (in 2014 through 2016) to both further outline the Central Zone 

and to test peripheral targets on the Spectrum claims block, as well as one diamond drilling 

program on the Donnelly Deposit (in 2016).   To the end of 2016, 105 holes had been completed 

by the Company for 29,427.6 m, including: 

 88 exploration holes (24,635.51 m) in the Central Zone (including the 500 Colour, HC, 
Porphyry, 33 and Skarn zones) and eight holes in the Donnelly Deposit (2,863.0 m) – see Table 

10.4; 

 three holes drilled into the 300 Colour zone (S15-066, S15-0068 and S16-093 for 810.0 m), 
one hole drilled into the Boundary zone (S15-065 for 265.0 m), one hole drilled into West 

Creek (S16-080 for 240 m) and one hole drilled into South Copper (S16-097 for 307m); and 

 three geotechnical holes (S15-71 through -73 for 461.0 m) drilled along a potential adit 
alignment intended to access underground drilling sites in the Central Zone. 

The 300 Colour, Boundary and West Creek zones are separate from the Central Zone and are not 

considered here.  The HQ diameter holes listed on Table 10.4 were drilled primarily as exploration 

holes, but at a larger diameter to facilitate sampling for metallurgical testing.

10.3 The Company's 2014 Drilling Program 

In October 2014, the Company completed 1,940.65 m of NQ diameter diamond drilling in nine 

drillholes from four different drilling platforms (Table 10.5).  Drilling was carried out by Black 

Hawk Drilling Ltd. of Smithers, B.C.  Drillhole collars were located in the field by hand-held GPS 

and surveyed at the end of the drilling program using DGPS.  Drillhole orientation surveys were 

taken approximately every 60 m to 100 m downhole using a Reflex orientation tool. 

Drillcore was logged and sampled at core logging facilities located at the Iskut Motor Inn, 

approximately 30 km from the project site.   Logging included observations of lithology, alteration, 

veining, mineralization and structure; geotechnical logging included core recovery and estimates 

of Rock Quality Designation ("RQD").  Drill moves and daily drill support was provided by 

Fireweed Helicopters of Whitehorse, Yukon.  The drillcore is currently located at the Company's 

Mountain Exploration Camp storage facility.

10.3.1 Purpose 

The Company's 2014 drilling program focused exclusively on the Central Zone, with the 

purposes of confirming historical drilling results, in-filling gaps in historical drilling and 

to test for deeper extensions of high-grade gold zones. 

10.3.2 Mineralized Intersections 

Analysis of the derived data and outcomes shows that the Company's objectives for the 

2014 drilling program were achieved, not least because all of the drilled holes intersected 

high-grade gold mineralization that exceeded 5.0 g/t Au over widths of at least 2.0 m (see 

Table 10.6, which was compiled from information contained in the May 2016 Technical 

Report, cross-referenced to the Company's news releases dated December 11, 2014 and 

January 14, 2015).  All of the Company's 2014 drillholes also intersected broad intervals 

of lower-grade porphyry style copper-gold mineralization, many of which were locally 

crosscut by higher-grade structures (see Table 10.7, which was compiled from the same 

data sources as Table 10.6).  The 2014 assay results summarized on Tables 10.6 and 10.7 

are uncut.  True widths were estimated to be 50% to 75% of the downhole intersection 

interval.

10.3.3 Interpretation 

Drilling to the end of October 2014 showed that the Central Zone comprises a broad, low-

grade porphyry-style shell of Cu-Au mineralization, crosscut by fault-, fracture- and veinlet 

zones that typically carry higher gold grades.  The mineralization model compiled as a 

result of the Company's 2014 drilling program formed the basis for its 2015 program, a 

key objective of which was to examine more closely the distribution and characteristics of 

the high-grade gold mineralization. 

10.4 The Company's 2015 Drilling Program 

From July through October 2015, the Company completed an additional 61 diamond drillholes 

from 58 different drilling platforms for a total of 19,269.95 m, not including three geotechnical 

holes totaling 461.0 m.  Fifty eight of the holes were drilled into the Central Zone (16,667.30 

m), one hole was drilled into the Boundary zone (265.0 m) and two holes were drilled into the 300 

Colour zone (424.0 m).  The drilling was carried out by Omineca Diamond Drilling Ltd. of Burns 

Lake B.C. utilizing two Multi Power Discovery 2 hydraulic fly rigs.  Drillhole collars were located 

in the field by hand-held GPS with collar elevations cross-checked to the results of the 2015 

LiDARTM survey.  Orientation surveys were taken approximately every 60 m downhole utilizing a 

Reflex orientation tool. 

Drillcore was logged and sampled at core logging facilities at the Company's Mountain 

Exploration Camp.  Logging included observations of lithology, alteration, veining, mineralization 

and structure; geotechnical logging included core recovery and RQD estimates.  Specific gravity 

("SG") and magnetic susceptibility measurements were also routinely taken.  Drill rig moves and 

daily drilling support was provided by Mustang Helicopters out of Stewart B.C. and Heli-Inter Inc. 

from Quebec, utilizing a Eurocopter AS350 B2 helicopter.  Most of the 2015 drillcore is stored at 

the Company's Mountain camp - several representative drillhole intersections were moved at the 

Company's Valley Exploration Camp that was constructed in 2016.  Table 10.8 summarizes the 

collar locations, azimuths, inclinations and lengths of the 58 exploration holes drilled on the 

Central Zone during the Company's 2015 drilling program.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

10.4.1 Purpose 

The purpose of the Company's 2015 drilling program was to test Central Zone mineralization 

in sufficient detail to enable a resource estimate to be compiled.   Drilling was targeted at further 

in-filling gaps in the historical drilling and to expand the resource area along strike and 

down dip.  High-grade gold mineralization was in particular targeted, with pierce points on 

nominal 50 m centres, both horizontally and vertically.  By the end of October 2015, the 

Company had drilled-off an area extending 650 m north-south and 360 m east-west, to a 

depth of 400 m below surface and in 2016 an updated Mineral Resource estimate was 

released (see the May 2016 Technical Report and Section 14.1). 

10.4.2 Mineralized Intersections 

Analysis of the derived data and outcomes showed that the Company's objectives for the 

2015 drilling program were achieved, not least because approximately 65% of the drilled 

holes intersected high-grade gold mineralization that exceeded 5.0 g/t Au over widths of at 

least 2.0 m (see Table 10.9 that is in five parts due to its overall length – it was compiled 

from information contained in the May 2016 Technical Report, cross-referenced to the 

Company's news releases dated August 20, 2015, September 08, 2015, October 08, 2015, 

October 26, 2015 and November 19, 2015).  Only ten of the drilled holes did not intersect 

any significant values, two of which because they were abandoned before intersecting the 

mineralized zone. 

All but eleven of the Company's 2015 drillholes on the Central Zone also intersected broad 

intervals of lower-grade porphyry style copper-gold mineralization, many of which were 

locally crosscut by higher-grade structures.  Of the eleven, two intersected high-grade gold 

mineralization only and one was abandoned before intersecting the mineralized zone (see 

Table 10.10 that is in two parts due to its overall length – it was compiled from the same 

data sources as Table 10.9).

10.4.3 Interpretation 

Drilling to the end of October 2015 showed that the Central Zone comprises a broad, low-

grade porphyry-style shell of Cu-Au mineralization, crosscut by fault-, fracture- and 

veinlet-zones that typically carry higher gold grades.  The entire area is pervasively altered 

to biotite hornfels, quartz-sericite-pyrite, potassic, argillic and silicic assemblages proximal 

to the Central Zone, with propylitic alteration developed further afield.  Higher grade gold 

zones may be accompanied by silver, copper and other base metals. 

Mineralization at both high- and lower-grades was interpreted to be fracture controlled, 

insofar as it occurs in veins, fractures and breccias around faults and shear zones.  The 

mineralization was found to consist of gold-bearing pyrite, native gold, arsenopyrite, 

chalcopyrite and sphalerite.  As of the end of October 2015 the identified mineralization 

remained open along strike to the north and south, as well as down dip to the west. 

10.4.4 Geotechnical Drilling  

Three geotechnical holes totaling 461.0 m were drilled by the Company in October 2015, 

to the east of the Mountain Exploration Camp and along a potential adit alignment.  

Drilling, geotechnical logging, packer hydraulic conductivity testing and the installation of 

Vibrating Wire Piezometers to collect water level data was carried out and supervised by 

engineers of Knight Piésold Consulting Ltd. of Vancouver, B.C. ("Knight Piésold"). 

The geotechnical holes were drilled because, at the time, underground drilling of the high-

grade gold zone was at the time planned, in part because underground mining was being 

contemplated.  Work carried out since October 2015 has shown that openpit is the better 

short- to medium-term option for exploiting the Central Zone, with the result that 

development of the proposed adit is no longer being contemplated. 

10.5 The Company's 2016 Drilling Programs 

From July 05 to October 28 2016, the Company completed 9,669.6 m of drilling in 32 drillholes, 

including: 

 21 exploration holes for 6,027.56 m in the Central Zone, thereby bringing the total number of 

holes drilled into the deposit to 168 for a total of  35,060.98 m, as of the end of 2016 (historical 

drilling plus the Company's drilling); and 

 eight infill exploration holes for 2,863.0 m in the Donnelly Deposit, thereby bringing the total 
number of holes drilled into the deposit to 178 for a total of 49,240.37 m (historical drilling 

plus the Company's drilling). 

The collar locations, azimuths, inclinations and lengths of the 29 exploration holes drilled into the 

Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit are summarized on Table 10.11.  Drilling was carried out by 

Omineca Diamond Drilling Ltd. of Burns Lake, B.C., utilizing two Multi Power Discovery 2 

hydraulic fly rigs.  Drillhole collars were located in the field by hand-held GPS and surveyed at 

the end of the drill program by DGPS.  Orientation surveys were taken approximately every 60 m 

downhole utilizing a Reflex orientation tool.  Drillcore was logged and sampled at core logging 

facilities at the Company's Valley Exploration Camp (Central Zone core) and GJ camp (Donnelly 

Deposit core) where the core is currently stored.  Logging included observations of lithology, 

alteration, veining, mineralization and structure; geotechnical logging included core recovery and

10.5.1 Purpose 

The purpose of the Company's 2016 diamond drilling program was to: better define the 

western and eastern boundaries of the Central Zone; to test the West Creek, South Copper 

and 300 Colour porphyry-style mineralized occurrences, as well as high-grade gold targets; 

and to provide additional geological and analytical information for less well constrained 

areas of the Donnelly Deposit.  Although the primary purpose of the holes was to better 

define the target mineralization, some of the holes were drilled at HQ diameter to facilitate 

sampling for the metallurgical testing program described in Section 13. 

10.5.2 Mineralized Intersections 

Table 10.12 summarizes the significant grade intercepts in the 21 exploration holes drilled 

by the Company on the Central Zone during 2016; Table 10.13 summarizes the same 

information for the holes drilled on the Donnelly Deposit.  Both tables were compiled from 

information contained in the Company news releases dated August 24, 2016 and December 

12, 2016.  The stated grades are un-cut; true widths are estimated by the Company to be 

65% to 90% of the downhole intervals.

It may be seen from the data presented on Tables 10.12 and 10.13 that the Company's 

objectives for the 2016 drilling program were met, insofar as all but one drillhole (S16-

074, which was abandoned short of the mineralized zone) returned significant mineralized 

intercepts.  In the case of the Central Zone, the drilling results summarized on Table 10.12 

extended Central Zone mineralization to the west in particular, where the 2016 block model 

indicated the presence of waste, due mainly to the lack of drilling (which in part reflected 

the challenging topography).  In the case of the Donnelly deposit, the mineralized intercepts 

summarized on Table 10.13 were expected by virtue of the 2016 block model (the purpose 

of the 2016 program was to infill areas identified from scrutiny of the 2016 block model).  

The same block model, inclusive of the 2016 results, indicates that the Donnelly Deposit 

remains open at depth. 

10.5.3 Interpretation – Central Zone 

The results of the 2016 drilling program on the Central Zone led to a significant 

improvement in the understanding of both the geology and spatial distribution of the 

mineralization contained within the target deposit.  The Central Zone is now interpreted to 

comprise: 

 a 1,000 m long, 70 m to 200 m thick, moderately west-dipping panel of porphyry-style 
copper-gold mineralization and alteration that has been tested to a maximum downdip 

depth of 400 m; with 

 a cross-cutting, sub-vertical zone of higher grade gold with or without silver, arsenic, 
antimony, copper, lead and zinc mineralization that occurs in veins, fractures and in 

alteration around faults and shear zones. 

The lower grade (copper-gold) porphyry-style mineralization is interpreted to remain open 

both along strike and down dip.  The high-grade gold zone has been defined over a strike 

length of 665 m and over a 40 m to 200 m width.  Drilling to date has shown that it: 

 is developed along the northern portion of the porphyry-style mineralization. 

 overprints the porphyry-style mineralization at its up-dip extent near surface; and

 remains open to the north and down-dip, but is truncated by faulting at its southern 
extent at approximately Section 4635 N. 

An offset and continuation of mineralization is possible and may be expressed as soil and 

rock gold-arsenic enrichment to the southeast, but this interpretation has not been tested by 

drilling.  Similar alteration and high-grade gold mineralization has also been intersected in 

the footwall of copper-gold porphyry mineralization on Section 4525 N, but its extent has 

not been tested by drilling. 

10.5.4 Interpretation – Donnelly Deposit 

Drilling to date has shown that the Donnelly Deposit is a structurally controlled, monzonite 

to monzodiorite hosted, porphyry-style copper deposit, with or without gold, that is 

oriented east-west and dips moderately to the south.  The deposit is controlled by early 

east-west faults, subsequently cross-cut by north-south faults and exposed at surface over 

1,990 m (east-west) before passing under younger Hazelton Group cover to the west.  The 

western edge of the deposit has been juxtaposed against the Hazelton Group by both east-

west and north-south faults, with mineralization documented to continue below cover to 

the west.  The deposit is up to 300 m wide and has a down dip extent of at least 500 m.  It 

remains open down dip and along strike to the west, where it is disrupted by strong vertical 

faulting. 

10.6 Core Recovery and RQD 

RQD is a function of the density of naturally occurring fractures ("discontinuities") and faults, 

while recovery is the ability of the drilling process to extract core.  RQD determinations should 

reflect insitu rockmass conditions that can in many instances be difficult to assess, which inevitably 

leads to an element of subjectivity in RQD determinations, hence sometimes strongly (downwards) 

biased datasets.  In the case of core recoveries and in common with RQD determinations, they 

should reflect the potential impacts key variables that can impact negatively on outcomes.  For 

example: 

 naturally occurring and mechanically induced fractures can often be difficult to tell apart, 
especially if, for example, extensive rockmass veining is present and the wallrock-vein 

contacts are weak; 

 small diameter drillcores tend to be more susceptible to mechanical effects both downhole, 
during core extraction from the drilling tube and during transport and logging (conversely, 

large diameter cores reduce the likelihood of mechanically induced breaks/fractures); 

 large diameter cores typically allow for high recovery rates in moderately to highly fractured 
ground and through gouge zones, although low recoveries can still be experienced in fault 

zones where material can be washed out by the drilling process; and   

 high bit pressures can cause extensive damage to drillcores (rubble zones can be created), 
especially when discontinuities that are inclined more-or-less in the drilling direction are 

intersected and/or when open void discontinuities are intersected.

10.6.1 Core Recoveries 

High bit pressures are typically employed and NQ core sizes (47.6 mm) or smaller are 

typically used in exploration programs, mainly for reasons of drillers' remuneration 

packages and overall drilling costs.  Despite this, analysis of the Company's drillhole 

database shows that recoveries are in general very good to excellent away from fault- and 

joint-zones: recoveries in excess of 92% are common, but are low or even very low in fault 

zones where drillcore can be highly fractured, crumbly, broken and include intervals of 

gouge.  Minor intervals reflecting core recoveries of 85% ±5% are reported, but these may 

be due to drilling and post-drilling mechanical effects and the presence of sometime closely 

veined rockmass intervals. 

10.6.2 Rock Quality Designations 

Deere (1964) proposed his quantitative index of rockmass quality based on core recovery 

by diamond drilling RQD, which has since become very widely used.  Deere's original 

specification was that RQD's should be defined as the percentage of core recovered in 

intact pieces of 100 mm or more in length in the total length of a drillhole.  More recently, 

RQDs have been determined for individual core runs by cumulatively adding the lengths 

of each piece of intact core that is longer than twice the diameter of the drilled core, and 

dividing the result by the length of the core run. 

It is normally accepted that RQDs should be determined using core that is at least 50 mm 

in diameter (i.e. greater than NQ diameter that is 47.6 mm in diameter) and which was 

drilled using, as a minimum, double barrel diamond drilling equipment.  Geotechnical 

logging should also be carried out as the core is retrieved from individual drilling runs, to 

thereby reduce post-drilling mechanical degradation of drillcore to a practicable minimum.   

High bit pressures are commonly employed and NQ diameter (or smaller) holes are 

commonly used during exploration drilling programs, and for the reasons earlier outlined, 

to which can be added the use of single barrel drilling equipment.  RQD determinations 

are, therefore, frequently biased to the downside of potential outcomes that can be further 

impacted by logging practices that sometimes vary widely between individuals.  It is in 

consequence of this that RQD results should be used only as a guide within the scope of 

analysis and design, not as a source of robust or definitive information that can be applied 

in empirical analysis leading a design outcome. 

NQ or smaller diameter core was in general drilled and single barrel equipment was 

uniformly used over the various exploration drilling programs carried out on the Project 

Area.  It is mainly for these reasons that, in Principal Author's opinion, the recorded RQD 

determinations should be considered with caution: 

 if the intersections logged by Company geologists as fault zones are excluded from 
analysis, then the average, logged RQD values typically vary between the middle of 

the 'Poor' range of rockmass qualities (RQD = 25% to 50%) to the middle of the 'Fair' 

range of rockmass qualities (RQD = 50% to 75%); 

o fault zones are uniformly logged as having 'Very Poor' to 'Poor' rockmass qualities 
(RQD <30%), as may reasonably be expected, and 

o some intervening rockmass intervals have logged RQD values at the top of the 
'Fair' RQD value range (50% to 75%); however

 in the Principal Author's opinion, the results summarized above do not fully or fairly 
reflect what he observed in the drillcores examined at site - the majority of the Central 

Zone rockmass between fault zone intervals may be described as having RQD values 

between approximately 45% and 65%, increasing to approximately 55% to 75% or 

even 80% in the case of the Donnelly Deposit. 

10.7 Qualified Person's Opinion 

In the opinion of the Principal Author, there are no drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could 

materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.  The quantity and quality of the 

lithological, collar, downhole survey and (notwithstanding the above) geotechnical data collected 

during the various exploration and infill drilling programs are sufficient to support Mineral 

Resource estimation, insofar as: 

 core logging meets industry standards for porphyry-style mineralization; 

 collar and downhole surveys were carried out using industry-standard instrumentation; 

 core recovery and RQD data from drilling programs is in general acceptable, although the latter 
is probably on the low side; 

 the drillhole intercepts appropriately reflect the nature of the target mineralization that includes 
areas of lower and higher grades; and 

 drillhole orientations are generally appropriate for the mineralization style; although 

 the Central Zone holes completed by the Company during 2014 and 2015 are uniformly 
towards azimuth 265º to 280º and consistently at dips of between 45º and 67º. 

While the 2014 and 2015 drilling programs were successful in intersecting and better defining the 

high-grade gold zone of the Central Zone, it is recommended that opportunities for changing future 

drilling directions and dips into the high-grade zone should be reviewed and implemented, as 

appropriate.  The same recommendation does not apply to the Company's 2016, Central Zone 

drilling program that was directed mainly at a west dipping porphyry target, with the result that 

the 090º azimuth for 20 of the 21 completed holes is considered appropriate.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

David Mehner, P. Geo. ("QP Mehner") is responsible for this Section of this Technical Report.  

The following text summarizes the available material concerning sample preparation, analysis and 

security over the various drilling programs carried out on the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit.  

The historical information was abstracted from the following technical reports that were prepared 

for CGH and are listed on www.sedar.com: 

 'Technical Report on the Donnelly - GJ - North Cu-Au Porphyry Zones, Kinaskan Lake 
Project, Liard Mining Division, British Columbia, Canada' by David T. Mehner, M.Sc., P. 

Geo. and Giles R. Peatfield, Ph.D., P. Eng., and dated May 15, 2005 (the "May 2005 Technical 

Report"); 

 'Technical Report on the Kinaskan Lake Copper-Gold Porphyry Project, Liard Mining 
Division, British Columbia, Canada' by David T. Mehner, M.Sc., P. Geo. and Giles R. 

Peatfield, Ph.D., P. Eng., and dated April 11, 2006 (the "April 2006 Technical Report"); and 

 'Technical Report on the GJ Cu-Au Porphyry Project, Liard Mining Division, British 
Columbia, Canada' by David T. Mehner, M.Sc., P. Geo., Gary H. Giroux, M.A.Sc., P. Eng. 

and Giles R. Peatfield, Ph.D., P. Eng., and dated April 30, 2007 (the "April 2007 Technical 

Report"). 

Reference was also made to the August 2014, April 2016 and May 2016 Technical Reports cited 

in Section 2.5.  The following assessment work reports also provided valuable data: 

 'Assessment Report on 2012 Drilling, Geological, Geochemical, and Geophysical work 
conducted during 2012 at the GJ/Kinaskan Cu-Au Porphyry Project', by L. Hollis and L. 

Bailey (2013).  British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Natural Gas.  Assessment 

Work Report No. 33,815; and 

 'Assessment Report on Drilling, Geological, Geochemical, and Geophysical work conducted 
during 2013 at the GJ/Kinaskan Cu-Au Porphyry Project', by L. Hollis (2014).  British 

Columbia Ministry of Energy and Mines.  Assessment Work Report No. 34,565. 

11.1 Historical Sampling, Analysis and Security Programs 

Samples collected by previous operators were prepared and analyzed by numerous laboratories 

using many different analytical techniques and sample preparation protocols.  Over the years, not 

only have sample preparation procedures and analytical methods changed, but a number of the 

laboratories which analyzed many of the samples no longer exist.  In most reports that pre-date 

1990, details on sample procedures, analytical methods and the detection limits for each element 

are either non-existent or only partially summarized.  In QP Mehner's opinion, this should not 

preclude the use of the pre-1990 assay database for purposes of Mineral Resource estimation: the 

analytical work was carried out by responsible companies and laboratories utilizing industry 

standards of the time; and the Company has expended significant effort validating the assay 

database (see Section 11.6). 

The same limitations do not apply to the various historical sampling and assaying programs carried

procedures and results, in part because all the assaying programs were carried out at independent 

laboratories that met industry standards of the time and in later years were ISO 17025 accredited. 

Limitations concerning sample security could also be identified prior to CGH's 2004 field 

program: no specific security measures were taken with sample shipments, other than normal 

precautions regarding identities of shippers and other such procedures as were considered standard 

at the time.  In QP Mehner's opinion, there is no reason to believe that there were any breaches of 

security such as would have compromised the results.  In this and other regards it should be 

emphasized that, in the case of the Donnelly Deposit database, all sampling carried out since 1989 

through 2007 was either performed by QP Mehner or was carried out under his supervision, while 

managing exploration work for Ascot and CGH.  In addition, the Principal Author of the April 

2016 Technical Report (Giles R. Peatfield, Ph.D., P. Eng.) was involved in the supervision of 

TexasGulf's 1977 and 1980 drilling programs, as well as CGH's 2004 through 2007 QA/QC 

programs. 

11.1.1 TexasGulf, 1977 and 1980 

The 16 TexasGulf holes drilled in 1977 and 1980 on the Donnelly Deposit were sampled 

at 3.0 m intervals and analyzed in their entirety for Cu and, where higher-grade intervals 

were visually estimated, for Au and Ag.  The samples were analyzed by Bondar-Clegg & 

Co. Ltd. of North Vancouver, B.C. ("Bondar-Clegg").  At the time, Bondar-Clegg was a 

widely used and recognized independent laboratory. 

11.1.2 Consolidated Silver Ridge Mines, 1979 and 1980 

In 1979, diamond drillcore was sampled at less than or equal to 3.0 m intervals and 

routinely analyzed for Au reported as Troy ounces per tonne ("oz/t").  There is no 

information in the literature documenting the analytical laboratory or the gold analytical 

technique.  Selective samples were also analyzed for Ag, reported as oz/t, and Cu, reported 

as percent, but the analytical techniques are unknown.   

In 1980, diamond drillcore was sampled at less than or equal to 2.0 m intervals and 

routinely analyzed for Au by fire assay technique.  There is no information in the literature 

documenting the analytical lab or the exact fire assay technique utilized.  Samples from 

drillholes 80-11 and 80-13 were routinely analyzed for silver, by fire assay, the details of 

which are unknown. 

11.1.3 Cominco Ltd., 1989 

Core from the 1989 diamond drill program was logged and sampled from a tent camp on 

the property.  Core was sampled at approximately 2.0 m intervals and routinely analyzed 

for Au and Cu and selectively analyzed for Fe, Mg, K and As.  Analysis was conducted by 

Cominco Exploration and Research Laboratory in Vancouver, B.C.  Analytical techniques 

are not documented but Au is reported in ppb units.  Any sample reporting greater than 

1,000 ppb Au was re-analyzed and results are reported as grams per tonne ("g/t").  Copper 

is reported using ppm units.  

11.1.4 Ascot Resources, 1990 

Core from the single hole drilled by Ascot on the Donnelly Deposit in 1990 was taken on 

a daily basis by helicopter to a core logging and sampling facility constructed near the site 

of Canorex drillhole CA-81-07 located on the GJ zone.  Core was logged, recoveries

measured and sample intervals marked at 3.0 m intervals by a geologist.  Where higher 

grade mineralization was noted, sample intervals were reduced to 1.5 m.  

The logged core was split with a manual core splitter.  Half-core samples were individually 

bagged, tagged and submitted to Min-En Laboratories in Smithers, B.C. ("Min-En", an 

independent company) where they were dried at 95º C, crushed to minus 1/4 inch in a jaw 

crusher and then to minus 1/8 inch in a secondary roll crusher.  Crushed samples were 

individually put through a Jones Riffle splitter to collect statistically representative 300 g 

to 400 g sub-samples that were pulverized in a ring pulverizer to P95 120 mesh.  The 

prepared pulps were then bagged, tagged and sent for analysis at Min-En's Vancouver 

facility. 

The prepared samples were analyzed for gold using a geochemical technique involving 

aqua regia dissolution of 15.0 g and 30.0 g sub-samples with an AAS finish.  Samples 

yielding >1,000 ppb (1.0 g/t) Au were re-analyzed by the one assay ton fire assay with an 

AAS finish.  Cu, Pb, Zn and Ag were determined using 2.0 g sub-samples, by nitric-

perchloric-hydrochloric acid digestion with an AAS finish.  As, Sb and Mo were 

determined by ICP analysis of 0.5 g sub-samples using a Jarrall-Ash 9000 ICAP 

instrument. 

11.1.5 Columbia Gold Mines, 1990 Through 1992 

Core from Columbia's three Central Zone drilling programs carried out in 1990 through 

1992 were sampled at less than 2.0 m intervals over their entire lengths.  The samples were 

split, securely bagged and submitted to Min-En (an independent company), where they 

were dried at 95º C, crushed to minus 1/4 inch in a jaw crusher then to minus 1/8 inch in a 

secondary roll crusher. 

Crushed samples were individually put through a Jones Riffle splitter to collect statistically 

representative 300 g to 400 g sub-samples that were pulverized in a ring pulverizer to P95 

120 mesh.  The pulps were bagged, tagged and sent for analysis at Min-En Laboratories at 

North Vancouver, B.C.  Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co and Cd analyses were completed by aqua 

regia digestion of 0.5 g of prepared pulps followed by AAS analysis using appropriate 

standard sets.  Gold analysis was completed either by: 

 a wet geochemistry method that involved cintering 5.0 g prepared pulps at 800ºC for 
three hours, followed by aqua regia digestion with further treatment by methyl iso-

butyl ketone and then AAS analysis using a suitable standard set; or 

 fire assay using one assay ton sample weight with an AAS finish (the analytic result 
had to be within three standard deviations of its known certificated grade or the whole 

set was re-assayed and likewise, inserted blanks had to be less than 0.015 g/t). 

11.1.6 Canadian Gold Hunter, 2004 Through 2007 

During each of CGH's four drilling programs on the Donnelly Deposit, core was quick-

logged at each hole before being flown, on a regular basis, by helicopter to the core logging 

facility located at the North zone area.  Prior to logging, core boxes were labelled and box-

specific from-to intervals were inscribed on aluminium tags attached to the front of each 

box.  Drillcore from holes CGH-04-001 to -003 was photographed, as was all the drillcore 

from the 2005, 2006 and 2007 programs.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

Samples were marked out on 3.0 m intervals (with some variations where appropriate to 

honour geology); standards, blanks and duplicates were inserted into the sample stream by 

CGH geologists.  In 2004 the core was split by one of the samplers using a manual core 

splitter.  During subsequent programs, a diamond saw was used when core was deemed to 

be well-mineralized and/or competent.  Boxes containing logged drillcore were stacked on 

pressure-treated four inch by four inch posts and stored near the core logging facility. 

Individual split core samples were placed in separate plastic sample bags secured with sure-

lock straps.  Samples were then stored in numbered rice sacks that were also secured with 

sure-lock straps.  The filled and secured rice sacks were stored at the project site until they 

were flown by helicopter to Tatogga Lake Resort where they were received by a local 

expediter.  The received bags were stored in a locked building until they were picked up 

by a transport truck and shipped directly to ALS for preparation and analysis. 

Sample preparation included drying followed by crushing the entire sample to better than 

70% passing a 2 mm (Tyler 10 mesh) screen. A split of up to 250 g was taken and 

pulverized to better than P85 Tyler 200 mesh.  The pulps were then sub-sampled for 

analysis. 

ALS analyzed the prepared samples for 34 elements, including Ag and Cu, by conventional 

ICP-AES analysis using 0.50 g sub-samples digested with aqua regia.  Samples yielding 

>10,000 ppm (1.0%) Cu or > 100 ppm Ag were re-assayed by dissolving 0.4 g to 2.0 g of 

sample pulp with concentrated nitric acid for half an hour followed by AAS analysis 

controlled by matrix-matched standards.  The upper portions of each drillhole were also 

analyzed for non-sulphide (oxide) copper using a sulphuric acid leach and an AAS finish.  

In the case of drillhole CGH-05-076, a composite of six samples from a section averaging 

1% Cu was checked for secondary copper by using a 0.5% cyanide leach on a 2.0 g sample 

that was then analyzed by AAS.  Gold values were determined using 30 g sub-samples and 

the fire assay method with an AAS finish.  All samples returning >1 ppm Au were re-

assayed using a gravimetric procedure on 30 g sub-samples. 

11.1.7 Teck Resources, 2011 and 2013 

A total of five holes were drilled by Teck on the Donnelly Deposit, during its 2011 and 

2013 drilling programs.  Hollis (2013, 2014) described the sampling, assaying and security 

procedures as follows. 

Core was flown on a regular basis by helicopter to a core logging facility located 200 m 

northwest of Teck's GJ camp.  Prior to logging, core boxes were labelled and from-to 

intervals were inscribed on the front end and at the top left hand corner of each box.  Teck 

geologists logged the core, marked out 3.0 m sample intervals and photographed core 

before it was sent to the samplers for splitting with an electrical or gas-powered saw.  After 

sampling, the core boxes were stacked, aluminum tags with the drillhole number and 

interval were fastened to the front of each box and lids nailed to the top box of each stack.  

All the boxed drillcore was stored at site, adjacent to Teck's core logging facility. 

The split-core samples were securely bagged and tagged at camp, and then flown by 

helicopter to Tatogga Lake Lodge where they were received by a Teck employee who 

drove the samples to the Bandstra Transportation Systems Ltd. ("Bandstra") shipping 

facility at Iskut, B.C.  There they were put into a locked facility until picked up by Bandstra 

and shipped to Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd. ("Acme", now Bureau Veritas Mineral

Laboratories – "Bureau Veritas" an independent company that is ISO 9001 accredited and, 

at the time of writing [February 2017] also ISO 17025 accredited) at Smithers, B.C. for 

preparation and analysis. 

Sample preparation included drying followed by crushing the entire sample to P80 10 mesh, 

splitting off 1,000 g and pulverizing the split to P85 passing 200 Tyler mesh.  Each prepared 

sample was analyzed for 53 elements using aqua-regia digestion with inductively coupled 

plasma mass spectrometry ["ICP-MS"] analyses on a 0.5g split, and assayed for 24 

elements using hot aqua-regia digestions with ICP-ES analysis.  Gold values were 

determined using a standard fire assay procedure on 30 g sub-samples.  All samples 

returning >1ppm Au were re-assayed using gravimetric analytical procedures on 30 g sub-

samples.  In addition, a limited number of samples from Teck's 2011 program were 

subjected to whole-rock analysis. 

11.2 The Company's 2014 Drilling Program 

Securely boxed core was flown on a regular basis by helicopter to the Company's core logging 

facility at Iskut, B.C.  Prior to logging, core boxes were labelled, from-to intervals were inscribed 

on the front end and top left hand corner of each box.   

Company geologists logged, marked out sample intervals (2.0 m, with some variations where 

appropriate to honour the geology) and photographed the core before it was sent to the samplers 

for splitting by diamond saw.  Blanks, standards and duplicates were inserted into the sample 

stream (see Section 11.5).  After sampling, aluminum tags with the drillhole number and interval 

were fastened to the front and lid of each box.  The boxed and labelled drillcore was stored in Iskut 

over winter, from where, in the summer of 2015, it was flown by helicopter to the Company's 

Mountain core storage facility, where it remains. 

11.2.1 Sample Security 

The split, half-core samples were sealed by Company geologists in labeled, poly sample 

bags that were sorted and stored at the Company's core logging facility at Iskut, B.C., prior 

to shipping.  At all times the samples were under the supervision and control of Company 

employees or contractors; detailed records were kept of where and when samples were 

shipped. 

The bagged samples were sent in polyfiber rice bags to Acme at their preparation laboratory 

in Terrace, B.C.  Each rice bag contained approximately five samples and weighed between 

10 kg and 15 kg.  The rice bags were indelibly labeled with the destination address, sender's 

address and sample numbers contained, and were doubly sealed with heavy-duty wire ties.  

Rice bags were labeled "1 of n", "2 of n", etc. to keep track of the number of bags in each 

shipment. Complete sample lists and laboratory requisition forms for a given shipment 

were inserted into "Bag 1 of n" and this bag was clearly identified with brightly-coloured 

flagging tape tied around the top. 

The rice bags were stacked on pallets and secured with plastic wrap at Bandstra's depot at 

Iskut, B.C.  From there, the pallets were sent by transport truck to Bureau Veritas' 

preparation facility at Terrace, B.C.  Early in 2016, Bureau Veritas' preparation facility at 

Terrace, B.C., was closed.  All reject materials were, as a result, sent to Bureau Veritas' 

main facility located at Vancouver, B.C.

11.2.2 Sample Preparation 

The drillcore samples were crushed at Bureau Veritas' Terrace, B.C. facility to 70% 

passing 2 mm and were then split to a 250 g sub-sample which was pulverized to P85 200 

mesh.   All coarse rejects and master pulps were retained at the facility for the duration of 

the program.  In 2016, the Company had the 2014 rejects and pulps shipped from Bureau 

Veritas' Vancouver, B.C. facility to Kamloops, B.C., where they are now in secure storage. 

11.2.3 Sample Analysis 

The prepared samples were sent by courier to the main laboratory of Acme at Vancouver, 

B.C.  The analytic methods employed were: 

 1.0 g aqua regia digestion with ICP-OES multi-element analysis, including gold; and 

 15 g aqua regia digestion (ignited at 550 Celsius) with ICP-MS Au analysis (samples 
reporting values greater than 5 g/t Au were re-run using 30 g fire assay analysis with a 

gravimetric finish). 

11.3 The Company's 2015 Drilling Program 

Securely boxed core was flown on a regular basis by helicopter to the Company's core logging 

facility at its Mountain exploration camp.  Prior to logging, core boxes were labelled, from-to 

intervals were inscribed on the front end and top left hand corner of each box.  

Company geologists logged, marked-out sample intervals (2.0 m, with some variations where 

appropriate to honour geology) and photographed the core before it was sent to the samplers for 

cutting by diamond saw or splitting using a hydraulic core splitter.  Blanks, standards and 

duplicates were inserted into the sample stream (see Section 11.5).  After sampling, aluminum tags 

with the drillhole number and interval were fastened to both the front of and lid of each box.  The 

boxed and labelled drillcore was then palleted at the Company's Mountain core storage facility, 

where it remains. 

11.3.1 Sample Security 

The split, half-core samples were sealed by Company geologists in labeled, poly sample 

bags that were sorted and stored at the Mountain camp core logging facility, prior to 

shipping.  At all times the samples were under the supervision and control of Company 

employees or contractors; detailed shipping records were kept. 

The bagged samples were sent in polyfiber rice bags to ActLabs.  Each rice bag contained 

approximately five samples and weighed between 10 kg and 15 kg.  The rice bags were 

indelibly labeled with the destination address, sender's address and sample numbers 

contained, and were doubly sealed with heavy duty wire ties.  Rice bags were labeled "1 

of n", "2 of n", etc. to keep track of the number of bags in each shipment. Complete sample 

lists and laboratory requisition forms for a given shipment were inserted into "Bag 1 of n" 

and this bag was clearly identified with brightly-coloured flagging tape tied around the top.  

Shipments of rice bags were made every day or two by helicopter from the Mountain camp 

to a staging area on Highway 37.  Samples were stored in a locked shipping container while 

awaiting transport to Bandstra's shipping facility at Smithers, B.C. by the Company's 

expediters (Matrix Helicopter Solutions of Langley, B.C.).

The rice bags were stacked on pallets and secured with plastic wrap at Bandstra's depot at 

Smithers, B.C.  From there, the pallets were sent by transport truck to ActLabs' preparation 

facility at Kamloops, B.C.  All reject materials and pulps are in secure storage in Kamloops. 

11.3.2 Sample Preparation 

The drillcore samples were crushed at ActLabs' Kamloops facility to 75% passing 2 mm, 

with 800 g being pulverized to P95 passing 200 mesh.  All coarse rejects and master pulps 

were retained at ActLabs' Kamloops facility for the duration of the program. 

11.3.3 Sample Analysis 

The prepared samples (pulps) were analyzed by ActLabs for Au, Ag and Cu, using the 

ActLabs' standard methods: 

 0.5 g aqua regia digestion with ICP-OES multi-element analysis (samples reporting 
values greater than 10,000 ppm for Pb, Zn and Cu or greater than 100 ppm Ag were re-

run using 4 acid digestion with an AAS finish); 

 50 g fire assay with AAS analysis for Au; and 

 samples suspected to contain visible gold and samples that analyzed greater than 10 g/t 
Au by fire assay were analyzed by 1,000 g screen metallic and 50 g fire assay, with a 

gravimetric finish. 

Check sample analysis were completed on 2015 pulps at the laboratory of ALS 

Geochemistry ("ALS") at North Vancouver, B.C.  The analytic packages were: 

 0.5 g aqua regia digestion with ICP-OES multi-element analysis (samples reporting 
values greater than 10,000 ppm for Pb, Zn, Cu or greater than 100 ppm Ag were re-run 

using 4 acid digestion with an AAS finish); and 

 50 g fire assay with AAS analysis for gold (samples reporting greater than 10 g/t Au 
results were re-run using 50 g fire assay with a gravimetric finish. 

Checks of 2014 gold analyses were also completed in 2015 (on the 2014 pulps) by Acme 

at Vancouver, B.C., using 50 g fire assay with an AAS finish.  Those samples reporting 

values greater than 10 g/t Au were re-analyzed by 50 g fire assay with a gravimetric finish. 

11.4 The Company's 2016 Drilling Programs 

Securely boxed core was flown on a regular basis by helicopters to the Company's core logging 

facility at its Valley Exploration Camp (Central Zone core) or GJ exploration camp facility 

(Donnelly Deposit core), as appropriate.  Prior to logging, core boxes were labelled, from-to 

intervals were inscribed on the front end and top left hand corner of each box.   

Company geologists logged, marked out sample intervals (2.0 m, with some variations where 

appropriate to honour geology) and photographed the core before it was sent to the samplers for 

cutting by diamond saw or splitting using a hydraulic core splitter.  Blanks, standards and 

duplicates were inserted into the sample stream (see Section 11.5).  After sampling, aluminum tags 

with the drillhole number and interval were fastened to the front and lid of each box.  The boxed 

and labelled drillcore was then stored at either the Company's Mountain core storage facility or 

GJ exploration camp core storage facility.

11.4.1 Sample Security 

Prior to shipping, sample lots were prepared and stored at the Company's core logging 

facilities at Valley camp or GJ camp, as appropriate.  Individual samples and their sample-

relevant tags were placed in clear poly sample bags which were labelled with the sample 

number and sealed with plastic cable ties.  Four to six samples were then placed in polyfibre 

rice bags; each filled bag weighed a total of 15 kg to 20 kg.  The rice bags were indelibly 

labeled with the destination address, sender's address and sample numbers contained, and 

were doubly sealed with plastic cable ties.  Rice bags were labeled "1 of n", "2 of n", etc. 

to keep track of the number of bags in each shipment.  Complete sample lists and laboratory 

requisition forms for a given shipment were inserted into "Bag 1 of n" and this bag was 

clearly identified with brightly coloured flagging tape tied around the top.  Differently 

coloured flagging tape was used to identify Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit samples. 

Every few days samples were placed in mini-bulk bags and transported in slung nets by 

helicopter, from camp to the Company's staging area at the end of the Willow Creek Road. 

Samples were stored in a locked shipping container while awaiting transport to Bandstra's 

depot at Smithers, B.C.  The staging area was manned 24 hours per day by a Company 

employee.  

Samples were transported from the Willow Creek Road staging area, either by the 

contracted expediter (Rugged Edge Holdings of Smithers, B.C.) or by the Company's 

contracted shuttle operator (ERP Services of Burns Lake, B.C.).  After pick-up and 

transport, the mini-bulk bags were placed on pallets at Bandstra's depot at Smithers, B.C., 

from where the pallets were sent by transport truck to ALS's preparation facility at 

Kamloops, B.C.  On receipt of each shipment, ALS catalogued each sample and e-mailed 

a confirmation of receipt to the Company's QA/QC Manager.  At the time of writing 

(February 2017), all reject materials are in secure storage in Kamloops and all pulp 

materials are in secure storage in North Vancouver. 

11.4.2 Sample Preparation 

Sample preparation in 2016 was carried out by ALS at their Kamloops, B.C. facility, except 

for one rush shipment of 95 drillcore samples that was prepared at ALS's laboratory at 

Terrace, B.C.  At both laboratories, samples were crushed to 90% passing 2mm, then riffle 

split up to 1,000 g and pulverized to P95 106 microns.  All coarse rejects and master pulps 

were retained at ALS's facilities for the duration of the program. 

11.4.3 Sample Analysis 

The prepared samples (pulps) were sent by courier to ALS's analytical facility at North 

Vancouver, B.C. where the pulps were analyzed using the following (ALS) standard 

methodologies: 

 0.5 g aqua regia digestion with ICP-AES multi-element analysis (samples reporting 
values greater than 10,000 ppm for Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn or 100 ppm for Ag were re-run 

using four acid digestion with an AAS finish); 

 50 g fire assay with AAS analysis for gold (samples reporting values greater than 10 
g/t Au were re-run using 50 g fire assay with a gravimetric finish); and 

 selected 1,000 g screen metallic 50 g fire assay for gold, with a gravimetric finish.

11.5 QA/QC Procedures, Historical Drilling Programs 

11.5.1 Central Zone, Prior to 1993 

There is little documentation available of sample preparation, analytical techniques and 

QA/QC procedures employed for the drilling programs carried out on the Central Zone up 

to and including 1992.  It was partly because of this that the four holes drilled by Imperial 

in 1973 were excluded from the Company's database, following its verification (see 

Section 12.4).  Furthermore, it is stated in the August 2014 Technical Report that 'It was 

noted by the QP (Jacques R. Stacey, MSc., P. Geo.) that historical operators did not employ 

the regular use of Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QAQC) procedures, such as the 

regular insertion of Certified Reference Standard Materials, Blanks, or Duplicate samples 

during sampling of drill core.  As such, the accuracy and precision of historical assays 

cannot be assessed, but the QP is satisfied that historical lab results were reasonably 

accurate and precise for the time, and that assays were performed by accredited analytical 

laboratories (e.g. Min-En Labs).  The QP has no reason to believe that any of the historical 

results could be misleading or erroneous'.  This opinion is supported by the gold and 

copper assays for samples taken during Cominco's 1989 drilling program that were 

completed by Cominco Exploration and Research Laboratory, which at the time was a 

reputable firm. 

11.5.2 Donnelly Deposit, Prior to 2004 

There are no known reports of quality control procedures being implemented to either 

ensure assay accuracy or to determine the precision of results for the drilling programs 

carried out prior to 2004.  However, as previously noted, all sampling carried out since 

1989 through 2007 was either performed by the QP Mehner or was carried out under his 

supervision, while managing exploration work for Ascot and CGH.  The Principal Author 

of the April 2016 Technical Report (Giles R. Peatfield, Ph.D., P. Eng.) was involved in the 

supervision of both of TexasGulf's drilling programs. 

11.5.3 Canadian Gold Hunter's 2004 Drilling Program 

Four dedicated standards (in addition to the laboratory's in-house standards) were used 

during CGH's 2004 drilling program: 

 they were prepared by and purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories ("CDN") of 
Burnaby, B.C.; 

 they comprised similarly altered and mineralized material from the nearby Red Chris 
porphyry copper-gold deposit; 

 they were subjected to multiple round-robin analyses by ten different laboratories to 
establish confidence limits for copper and gold; and 

 they were inserted in rotation inserted into the sample stream with an overall frequency 
of 5% (one in every 20 samples). 

The controlling factor used in choosing the assay standards was copper grade and ensuring 

the copper-gold ratio approximated to that known to occur in the Donnelly, GJ and North 

zones.  The four standards purchased had copper grades: near the probable cut-off grade 

for an openpit operation (0.155% Cu, as determined in 2004); near the mean grade expected

for an openpit mine (0.596% Cu, as expected in 2004); and two near the upper limits of 

expected values (1.177% and 1.947% Cu).  Corresponding gold grades were appropriate.  

Silver grades were not determined for these standards as silver was considered only a minor 

part of the potential value of the material. 

Monitoring of the standards' assays indicated that the results were acceptable, in that the 

standards' assays fell within acceptable limits: 

 in the case of the low-grade standard (grade of 0.155% Cu ± 0.006% Cu and 0.13 g/t 
Au ± 0.02 g/t Au at the 95% confidence level), four of 17 inserted standards returned 

Cu values slightly higher (to 0.165% Cu) and two yielded slightly higher gold values 

(to 0.151 g/t Au); 

 the standard equating closest to the anticipated (in 2004) average grade for an openpit 
mine (0.596% Cu ± 0.029% Cu and 0.53 g/t Au ± 0.068 g/t Au at the 95% confidence 

level) yielded four of 18 inserted samples with elevated copper values (to 0.646% Cu) 

and one with a higher gold value (0.613 g/t Au); and 

 of the two standards representing grades at the expected upper limits, one standard 
returned all 16 samples with copper-gold grades within ranges representing the 95% 

confidence levels while the second standard (1.947% Cu ± 0.062% Cu and 2.09g/t Au 

± 0.15 g/t Au at the 95% confidence level) returned three of 15 samples with slightly 

elevated copper values (to 2.02% Cu) and two with lower gold values (to 1.785 g/t Au). 

In addition, one sample in every 50 had a second pulp prepared from reject material.  This 

was assayed and results of both pulps compared.  Of 27 duplicate pairs, only two had Cu 

variances of more than 70 ppm: a sample pair in the 0.35% Cu range where the difference 

is 0.04% Cu; and a second sample pair in the 0.42% Cu range where the difference is 

0.012% Cu.  Gold values displayed the same reproducibility, with the exception of three 

samples: a sample pair in the 0.50 g/t Au range where the difference is 0.188 g/t Au; a 

second pair in the 0.30 g/t Au range where the difference is 0.07 g/t Au; and a third sample 

pair in the 0.15 g/t Au range where the difference is 0.038 g/t Au.  It was concluded at the 

time (see the May 2005 Technical Report) that 'the control sample program has 

demonstrated reasonable results, and the assay values, especially for copper (which is the 

most economically important metal in the deposit) are statistically accurate and 

appropriate for use in a resource estimate'.  

11.5.4 Canadian Gold Hunter's 2005 Drilling Program 

A more comprehensive QC program was instituted for the 2005 drill program, during 

which four purchased standards were inserted in rotation.  These had slightly different 

values than those used in 2004, but they were chosen in a similar fashion.  In addition, core 

samples known on the basis of previous assaying to be barren ("blanks") were inserted at 

regular intervals to check for possible preparation contamination.  Core duplicates (where 

the second half of the core is assayed) were taken regularly.  Preparation duplicates (second 

pulps prepared from rejects) were inserted regularly by the laboratory, as were pulp 

duplicates.  In summary, every eleventh assay represented a control sample, be it standard, 

blank or a type of duplicate.  This meant that every regular run of 80 core samples would 

have eight control samples, in addition to the laboratory's own standards.  The controls 

were added at regular intervals and in constant order.  This meant that controls were random

in terms of the mineralized zones, but not in terms of the assay process.   The decision to 

insert the controls in a regular fashion was based on a desire to minimize the risk of sample 

numbering errors in the field.  

Monitoring of the standards' assays indicated that the results were acceptable, in that most 

of the standards' assays fell within acceptable limits (the very few that fell outside these 

limits were generally within runs of unmineralized rock and were not considered to warrant 

re-assay work).  Correlation plots for the duplicates are presented in the April 2006 

Technical Report, in which it is stated that: 

 for copper, the plots show very little sign of bias and extremely good correlation (the 
correlation coefficients increase from drillcore to preparation to assay duplicates, as 

would be expected); 

 the results for gold are less good than for copper, again as would be expected (the bulk 
of uncertainty would appear to be at the field sampling [core duplicate] stage as the 

preparation and assay duplicate results are by comparison much better); and 

 silver duplicate assay results are much like those for gold (uncertainty again appears to 
be at the field sampling stage, rather than in sample preparation or assaying). 

As part of CGH's 2005 program, several drillcore intervals from earlier Amoco, Canorex 

and TexasGulf drilling programs were sampled.  The core was found to be generally in 

poor condition, but a limited number of sections were identified and recovered for assay.  

Most, but not all, samples represented previously assayed intervals; a few were not exactly 

equivalent.  Details of this assaying, controlled by standards, etc., are presented in the April 

2006 Technical Report in which it is stated that 'The general conclusion to be drawn is 

that while copper assays show good correspondence between original and re-sampling, 

original results for gold and especially silver in the Amoco and Canorex work are suspect 

and should be used with caution or not at all.  TexasGulf gold results are acceptable'. 

11.5.5 Canadian Gold Hunter's 2006 Drilling Program 

The QA/QC protocols for CGH's 2006 drilling program were modeled on those used by 

CGH in 2005.  The only substantive difference was that only three standards were 

employed.  The results of CGH's 2006 QA/QC program are presented in the April 2007 

Technical Report, in which it is stated that 'the QC monitoring were satisfactory.  Most 

standards assays for copper and gold were within acceptable limits.  A very few were 

outside these limits; these were generally within runs of un-mineralized rock and were not 

considered to warrant re-assay work'. 

Duplicate sampling in 2006 employed the same procedures as used by CGH in 2005.  The 

results are presented in the April 2007 Technical Report, in which it is stated that 'The 

results of the QC monitoring were satisfactory.  Most standards assays for copper and gold 

were within acceptable limits.  A very few were outside these limits; these were generally 

within runs of un-mineralized rock and were not considered to warrant re-assay work'. 

Details, including graphical plots, are included in in the April 2007 Technical Report in 

which correlation plots for the three types of duplicates are also presented and the following 

is stated: 'In the case of copper, the charts show very little sign of bias and extremely good 

correlations.  The correlation coefficients increase from core to preparation to assay

duplicates, as one would expect (and hope).  Correlations for gold are less good, again as 

one would expect.  Here the bulk of the uncertainty would appear to be at the field sampling 

(core duplicate) stage.  Preparation and assay duplicate results are much better.  Silver 

duplicate assay results are much like those for gold, the uncertainly appears to be at the 

field sampling stage rather than in sample preparation or assaying'.  

11.5.6 Canadian Gold Hunter's 2007 Drilling Program 

The 2007 QC monitoring was essentially the same as for 2006.  Three CDN standards were 

again employed.  Duplicate samples were taken as in previous years, and barren material 

inserted as blanks to check for possible preparation contamination.  The results were 

carefully monitored by Peatfield, who noted a small number of discrepancies that were 

successfully resolved by re-assaying selected samples. 

11.5.7 Teck Resources' 2011 and 2013 Drilling Programs 

Quality control and data verification during Teck's 2011 and 2013 drilling programs was 

effected using standards, blanks and duplicates that were randomly inserted into the sample 

stream at a rate of 1 in 20.  Several certified standards were used, each of which was 

prepared by CDN, Ore Research & Exploration Pty. Ltd of Bayswater, North Victoria, 

Australia (ISO 9001 certified) or by Teck.  Blank material consisted of garden-variety 

granite sourced from Acme at Smithers, B.C.  Duplicates included field (drillcore) 

duplicates, preparation (crushed) duplicates and assay (pulp) duplicates.  In the case of the 

drillcore duplicates, both drillcore halves were sampled so no material remained in the core 

boxes for these samples.  Pulp duplicate assays were also carried out: 115 pulps, 

comprising approximately 5% of the total number of samples, were shipped to ALS at 

North Vancouver where Cu, Mo and Fe assay-grade concentrations were determined by 

ICP-AES analysis of a split digested by aqua regia.  Gold concentrations were determined 

by fire assay with an ICP-AES finish of 30 g splits. 

Quality control and data verification were monitored by Teck personnel.  A small number 

of minor discrepancies were identified, which resulted in samples being re-assayed by 

Acme until the discrepancies were fully resolved (Hollis, 2012; Hollis and Bailey, 2013). 

11.6 The Company's QA/QC Procedures 

External control samples were systematically inserted into the sample streams during the 

Company's 2014, 2015 and 2016 drilling programs (Table 11.1).  The control samples included 

field duplicates, blanks and certified reference materials (CRMs or "standards", supplied by CDN 

Resource Laboratories of Langley, B.C.) that were inserted at an overall frequency of 

approximately 10%:  field duplicates, consisting of quarter cores, were inserted every 50 samples; 

blank material was inserted every 20 to 30 samples in 2014 and every 40 samples in 2015 and 

2016; and a standard was inserted every 20 to 30 samples in 2014 and every 20 samples in 2015 

and 2016.  The results of the external control samples were monitored throughout the Company's 

drilling programs by a dedicated database manager.  Any identified issues were resolved 

immediately by re-analyzing relevant samples and then re-verifying the results.

In 2015 and 2016, in addition to the use of control samples, 5% of all samples were re-analyzed 

by an external, independent laboratory (Table 11.1).  The results were compared with the original 

assays; no analytical bias was detected.   The three independent, analytical laboratories used during 

the Company's drilling programs also maintained internal QA/QC programs consisting of 

preparation duplicates, pulp duplicates, standards and blanks that were monitored by a certified 

assayer (Table 11.2).  Internal QA/QC data was regularly reviewed, along with all external data.

Figure 11.1 (for gold), Figure 11.2 (for silver and Figure 11.3 (for copper) 3 provide 

examples of the Company's blanks assay charts for 2014 through 2016.  In 2014, blank 

material was sourced from inert road fill.  The material was analyzed to ensure it was 

suitable material to use as a blank and then utilized during the 2014 drilling program.  In 

2015, blank material was sourced from the local Miocene Edziza basalt and consisted of 

less than 50 mm fragments with a mass averaging two kilograms.  It was recognized that 

the Miocene Edziza basalt can contain elevated copper, albeit well below the levels of 

economic interest.  It was because of this that the use of Miocene Edziza Basalt was 

discontinued in 2016. 

In 2016, two sources of blank material were used.  The first was sourced from Imasco 

Minerals Inc. and consisted of granite aggregate landscape rock.  The second comprised 

white marble used for landscape rock, as packaged by Premier Tech Home & Garden of 

Mississauga, Ontario. 

Analysis of the results shows no correlation between elevated Au or Cu values in blanks 

and the grade of the preceding sample.  It was concluded that the results are consistent and 

no economically significant cross-contamination for Au, Ag or Cu is evident.

11.6.2 Standards 

Throughout the Company's 2014 to 2016 drilling programs, standards (or certified 

reference materials) were inserted into the sample stream every 20 samples.  A total of 11 

different standards were used through the three years.  The gold standards are summarized 

on Table 11.3, the silver standards on Table 11.4 and the copper standards on Table 11.5.  

Individual standards were plotted along with their expected values, ±2 Standard Deviations 

("SD") and ±3 SD.  Values outside ±2 SD were flagged with a warning and values outside 

±3 SD were considered failures.  If a failure occurred, additional QA/QC data for other 

certified elements in the standard and from the laboratory's internal QA/QC was examined 

for acceptance.  Should re-analysis be required, the series of samples above and below the 

failure were also re-analyzed.  Examples of standard control charts are presented as Figures 

11.4 (for gold), 11.5 (for silver) and 11.6 (for copper). 

Standards GS-2P and GS-4E had high failure rates in 2014.  The two standards were 

certified using 30 g fire assay with an AAS/ICP finish.  However the gold analysis used in 

2014 by Acme utilized a 15 g ICP-MS method, which method is not considered appropriate 

for these standards. To check the validity of the 2014 Acme gold results, the Company 

contracted Acme to re-analyze 492 samples from the 2014 drilling program by 50 g fire 

assay.  Based on this study, there is no significant bias of the two sets of results: the 

standards that were re-assayed in the study all passed and the 2014 results are therefore 

deemed acceptable.  In 2015, three instances of QA/QC discrepancies were noted but were 

deemed not significant enough to warrant re-analyzing.  In 2016, seven instances of 

QA/QC sample discrepancies were noted that were successfully resolved by re-assaying 

selected samples.

11.6.3 Duplicates 

Field duplicate results were compared to the original sample data by XY, absolute relative 

difference plots, relative precision (2 x the coefficient of variation) and relative percent 

difference plots to determine overall precision.  Overall field duplicates showed a fairly 

high degree of variability for gold (which is typical for quarter-core field duplicates in vein 

gold deposits), while copper correlated better with the original sample values and with 

greater precision shown at higher grade ranges.  Internal laboratory crush duplicates and 

pulp duplicates show an increasingly higher degree of correlation for gold, copper and 

silver than did the field duplicates, as might be expected.  

11.6.4 The Company's 2015 Results' Analysis Programs 

In 2015, to check the veracity of Acme's 2014, 15 g ICP-MS gold assays, the Company 

contracted Acme to re-analyze 492 samples from the 2014 drilling program for gold, using 

the 50 g fire assay method.  The results show that there is no significant bias between the 

two sets of results (Figure 11.7); the 2014 results were deemed acceptable for purposes of 

Mineral Resource estimation. 

At the end of the Company's 2015 diamond drilling program on the Spectrum claims block, 

a comparison of the results for gold analyzed using the 50 g fire assay method and the 

screened metallic method were compared.  The results show that there is no significant bias 

between the two sets of results (Figure 11.8); the results were deemed acceptable for 

purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

11.6.5 The Company's Check Assay Programs 

On completion of the Company's 2015 and 2016 drilling programs, 5% of the samples 

were re-analyzed by second laboratories (ALS in 2015, ActLabs in 2016) by fire assay for 

gold and by ICP for multi-elements.  Original and check analysis results for Au, Ag and 

Cu were compared using Q-Q plots.  More variability was shown in the Au results, 

especially at higher grades, but this is expected to be due to a nugget effect.  Overall the 

check assays correlated well, as Figures 11.9 (for gold), 11.10 (for silver) and 11.11 (for 

copper) suggest.

11.6.6 The Company's Re-Assay Programs 

In 2014 and 2015, the Company re-sampled selected intervals of historical drillcore from 

programs at the Central Zone, completed by Cominco Ltd. in 1989 and Columbia Gold 

Mines Ltd. in 1990 through 1992.  Although most of the high-grade gold intervals had been 

removed by previous operators, recognizable labels were present and the core could be 

sampled with confidence. 

A total of 359 gold samples and 367 copper samples were re-sampled and then analyzed 

by Acme at Vancouver B.C. in 2014 and by ActLabs of Kamloops, B.C. in 2015.  The 

sample security, sample preparation and sample analysis procedures in 2014 are described 

in Sub-Sections 11.2.1, 11.2.2 and 11.2.3, respectively and for 2015 they are described in 

Sub-Sections 11.3.1, 11.3.2 and 11.3.3, respectively.   

The results showed that above 10 g/t Au, there is a strong bias towards the original sample 

results, which is attributed to incomplete core in the check samples due to the removal of 

high-grade, show pieces of core by previous operators.  At lower Au grades, there is better 

correlation of original and check analysis results, but still a high degree of variability with 

both higher and lower Au results being returned.  For copper, there is a very good 

correlation of check results to original results.  Although there is a significant scatter in the 

Au data, on average, Au and Cu values are comparable to those reported by previous 

operators, indicating that these historical assays can be used with an acceptable degree of 

confidence. 

The Company has not undertaken any data validation by re-sampling and independent 

analysis of historic core from the Donnelly Deposit.  In QP Mehner's opinion, the 

Company's decision is appropriate as the historic drilling programs carried out by CGH 

and Teck utilized industry standard QA/QC protocols.  In addition, QP Mehner was 

responsible for CGH's 2004 through 2007 sampling and QA/QC programs.  Furthermore, 

in 2005, CGH re-sampled drillcore intervals from the 1970 and 1971 Amoco, 1981 

Canorex and 1977 and 1980 TexasGulf drilling and concluded that while copper assays 

show good correspondence between original and re-sampling, original results for gold and 

especially silver in the Amoco and Canorex work are suspect and should be used with 

caution or not at all.  The Amoco and Canorex holes are not located on the Donnelly 

Deposit and as such were not used for the Mineral Resource estimates reported herein, 

whereas TexasGulf's 16 holes drilled in 1977 and 1980 are as the data is acceptable. 

11.7 Qualified Person's Opinion 

Sample collection, preparation, analysis and security for historical data is in assumed line with 

industry-standard methods for porphyry-style deposits, but the data has not been verified with 

appropriate supporting QA/QC results.  This is stated because there is little or no documentation 

available of sample preparation, analytical techniques and QA/QC procedures employed for the 

drilling programs carried out on the Central Zone up to and including 1992 and those carried out 

on the Donnelly Deposit prior to 2004, despite which: 

 QP Mehner's concurs with the principal author of the August 2014 Technical Report (Jacques 
R. Stacey, MSc., P. Geo.) that 'the QP is satisfied that historical lab results were reasonably 

accurate and precise for the time, and that assays were performed by accredited analytical 

laboratories' that may be considered reputable;

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 QP Mehner agrees that there is no reason to believe that 'any of the historical results could be 
misleading or erroneous'; 

 all sampling carried out since 1989 through 2007 was either performed by the QP Mehner or 
was carried out under his supervision, while managing exploration work for Ascot and CGH; 

and 

 the principal author of the April 2016 Technical Report (Giles R. Peatfield, Ph.D., P. Eng.) 
worked as a project geologist and later manager for TexasGulf as that company explored the 

target area from 1976 to 1980, and consulted to CGH from 2004 to 2008.   

All subsequent drilling programs included the insertion of blank, duplicate and standard reference 

material samples, and the program results do not indicate any problems with the analytical 

programs.  The databases included checks on surveys, collar co-ordinates, lithology data and assay 

data.  In QP Mehner's opinion, the checks are appropriate, and consistent with industry standards 

and include independent data audits.  Furthermore, all core has been catalogued and stored in 

designated areas, and it is being appropriately safeguarded against damage by weather or 

machines. 

In QP Mehner's opinion and subject to data verification (see Section 12): 

 the quality of the gold, silver and copper analytical data available up to and including 1992 for 
the Central Zone and up to an including 2003 for the Donnelly Deposit are sufficiently reliable 

to support Mineral Resource estimation, but due to the lack of appropriate supporting QA/QC 

results, the data should not be used to support classification of Measured blocks; and 

 the quality of the gold, silver and copper data from all the drilling programs carried out since 
1992 on the Central Zone and since 2003 on the Donnelly Deposit are sufficiently reliable to 

support Mineral Resource estimation without limitation.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

David Thomas, P. Geo. ("QP Thomas") is responsible for this section of this Technical Report.   

12.1 Drillhole Logging 

During QP Thomas' September 2016 site visit to the Project Area, he examined core from three 

drillholes to verify the drillhole logging.  Comparisons were made of the logged lithology, 

alteration and mineralization reported in the Company's drillhole database with QP Thomas' own 

observations.  Only minor differences were found that, in QP Thomas' opinion, do not materially 

affect the quality or veracity of the Company's database. 

12.2 Assay Database 

12.2.1 2014 Verification 

As part of a wider due diligence program, the principal author of the August 2014 Technical 

Report (Jacques R. Stacey, MSc., P. Geo.) examined and verified the digital drillhole 

database for the Spectrum claims block, supplied by Mining Associates (who had retained 

the database following their 2003 review of the historical Mineral Resource estimates 

summarized in Section 6.2, since when no additional drilling had been carried out on the 

Spectrum claims block).  Data verification was '… accomplished by plotting the digital 

data in a GIS workspace (MapInfo™/Discover™) and comparing the digital data to the 

original paper drill hole logs as contained in Assessment Reports found in the BC Ministry 

of Energy and Mines Assessment Report Indexing System (ARIS).  Assessment reports for 

the property can be found at http://aris.empr.gov.bc.ca/ (search term: Spectrum)'.  The 

datasets that were verified included 'drill collar locations, downhole surveys, drill core 

lithologies, and, most importantly, historical gold assays'.  The principal author of the 

August 2014 Technical Report concluded that 'the data contained in the drill database 

obtained from Mining Associates is reasonably accurate, and match the historical records 

publicly available'. 

12.2.2 Qualified Person's Verification 

QP Thomas carried out a detailed verification of the Company's drillhole database, during 

November and December 2016.  By virtue of the 2014 analysis summarized above, QP 

Thomas' focus for the Central Zone was on the results of the Company's drilling programs 

carried out during 2014 through 2016.  For the Donnelly Deposit, data from the Company's 

2016 drilling program was reviewed, as well as a selection of historical assays. 

All relevant, available data was utilized including reports, logs and ancillary data in digital 

format, as well as assay certificates in .pdf format that were sent direct to QP Thomas by 

the source assay laboratories used by the Company.  Historical assay data was reviewed 

through reference to certified copies (in .pdf format, where possible) of the original assay 

certificates. 

To complete the verification, data contained in the Company's drillhole assay database was 

compared directly with information contained on .pdf copies of the original assay 

certificates.  Verification focused on the available data and its format, what data was 

collected, back-up reference material, data consistency and the accuracy and reliability of

Verification of the data was hampered by the assay certificates not consistently reflecting 

the priority-based assay shown in the Company's database, by which the most reliable 

analytical method is used (for example, metallic assay is used ahead of 50 g fire assay, 

which is used ahead 30 g fire assay, which in turn is used ahead of ICP-MS).  Any 

differences between assays in the Company database and the relevant assay certificate were 

resolved by the Company.  In addition and in total, eight errors were found in the Ascot 

drillholes from 1990: the gold assays had been incorrectly calculated from the copper ppm 

field rather than the gold ppb field.  The identified errors were also fixed. 

It is in consequence of the outcomes of his verification program that QP Thomas 

recommends that: 

 the Company's database structure is modified so that the final assays relate to the 
appropriate certificate number; and 

 all the historical data is verified against the source documents. 

12.3 Drillhole Collars 

12.3.1 Central Zone 

As stated in Section 10.1, significant effort was expended by the Company in 2014 to verify 

the collar positions of the 80 historic holes drilled on the Spectrum claims block.  Forty 

four individual collars were located in the field and surveyed using a hand-held DGPS 

instrument and the collar elevations were checked by Company geologists using LiDARTM.  

The positions of the 36 drillhole collars that could not be located in the field were estimated:

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 the original and re-surveyed positions of the 44 drillhole collars that could be located 

in the field were analyzed and an overall mean difference between the two datasets was 

determined; 

 the mean difference was applied to the individual positions of the 36 historic holes that 
could not be located in the field, as defined on plans compiled by the original owners 

and operators; 

 the validity of the collar co-ordinates defined using the method outlined above were 
checked by means of a review of the drilling patterns for the historic holes and the 

relative positions of individual holes assessed (no changes of any significance were 

found); and 

 the collar elevations were checked by Company geologists using LiDARTM. 

12.3.2 Donnelly Deposit 

The historical drillholes located on the Donnelly Deposit were surveyed in 2004 by CGH 

personnel, using a DGPS device.  All those drillholes completed since 2004 had drillhole 

collar surveys completed by DGPS, inclusive of: the 126 holes drilled by CGH between 

2005 and 2007; the seven holes drilled by Teck in 2011 and 2013; and the eight holes 

drilled by the Company during 2016. 

12.3.3 Qualified Person's Checks 

The locations of 12 drillhole collars were checked by QP Thomas during his September 

2016 site visit to the Project Area, using a hand-held GPS device.  Eight checks were 

completed on the Central Zone and four checks were completed on the Donnelly Deposit.  

Only minor differences were found between the co-ordinates stated in the Company's 

database and co-ordinates collected during QP Thomas' site visit.  The results are 

summarized on Table 12.2.

12.4 Specific Gravity Database 

12.4.1 Central Zone and Surrounding Prospects 

In 2015 and 2016, whole core samples were measured at the Company's site exploration 

camp for SG, using the classic Archimedes method.  In 2015, 572 samples were measured 

by Company personnel; 298 samples were measured by Company personnel in 2016.  Of 

these 858 are for the Central Zone.  To verify the 2015 and 2016 field SG measurements: 

 in 2015, 373 samples from the Central Zone and surrounding prospects were submitted 
as SG checks to ActLabs of Kamloops, B.C., utilizing the pycnometer method; and 

 in 2016, 86 samples from the Central Zone and surrounding prospects were submitted 
to ALS Minerals of North Vancouver, B.C., utilizing the paraffin coated, half-core 

method. 

In both 2015 and 2016, a very slight negative bias in the SG data compiled at the 

Company's site exploration camp was found.  This may be attributed to the different 

measurement techniques used at the Company's exploration camps and by the independent 

laboratories.  In the opinion of QP Thomas, the slight difference does not materially affect 

the tonnage estimates of the 2017 Mineral Resource estimate for the Central Zone 

presented in Section 14.  Table 12.3 summarizes a comparison, by lithology, of site-

measured SG values with those determined in the laboratory.  It may be seen that the results 

show very similar SG values.

Table 12.4 summarizes the SG database for the Donnelly Deposit.  It may be seen that due 

to the limited amount of drilling carried out by the Company (eight holes in 2016), the SG 

database of 1,316 measurements (not including the 55 check measurements noted below), 

is skewed in favour of field data collected by CGH (using exclusively the classical 

Archimedes method) and Teck (by Acme, using exclusively their Standard G812 method).

The 100 SG measurements taken during the Company's 2016 drilling program were 

determined by ALS Minerals of North Vancouver, B.C. ("ALS") using the paraffin half 

core method.  Of these 100 samples, 55 were selected from CGH drillcore using, wherever 

possible, the same core pieces as those measured by CGH.  Analysis of the results of the 

2016 laboratory-based SG measurements shows that they agree favorably with CGH's field 

determined values, insofar as the laboratory-measurements are average only 1.1% lower 

than CGH's field measurements.  In the opinion of QP Thomas, the slight difference does 

not materially affect the tonnage estimates of the 2017 Mineral Resource estimate for the 

Donnelly Deposit presented in Section 14. 

12.5 Qualified Person's Opinion 

Verification of the Company's drillhole database indicates that there are no errors or 

inconsistencies that would have any material effect on the Company's database.  In the opinion of 

QP Thomas, the level of database accuracy is acceptable and the database is suitable for use in 

Mineral Resource estimation: 

 the Company operated within the guidelines of best industry practice during its drilling, 
logging, sampling and assay data management programs; 

 excluding standards, duplicates and blanks, there are approximately 22,581 assays for 
drillholes located on or drilled into the Central Zone and 16,410 assays for drillholes located 

on or drilled into the Donnelly Deposit - only minor errors were found during the verification 

process, which were itemized and rectified; however 

 data for the four holes drilled by Imperial in 1973 were excluded from the database used to 
compile the Mineral Resource update for the Central Zone, due to the lack of documentation 

and a lack of drillhole logs; 

 although the percentage of the Company's overall database that was verified within the scope 
of the verification programs reported here exceeds industry standards, it is recommended that 

the entire assay database is verified going forward; 

 the database of drillhole collars is acceptable for purposes of Mineral Resource estimation; and 

 the database of 858 SG results (not including verification results) for Central Zone and 1,316 

SG results (not including verification results) for the Donnelly Deposit is acceptable for 

purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Christopher Martin, C. Eng. ("QP Martin") is responsible for this section of this Technical Report.  

Presented in the following text are summaries of past metallurgical testing programs and the results 

of the testing program carried out for purposes of the PEA (the "PEA program"). 

13.1 Central Zone   

13.1.1 Test Programs 

Prior to the PEA program, little metallurgical testing had been completed on Central Zone 

samples.  The process design and metallurgical forecast are, therefore, based on the PEA 

program that was carried out during late 2016 and Q1, 2017.  The work was primarily done 

at Blue Coast Research Ltd. of Parksville, B.C. ("Blue Coast"), supported by testwork and 

mineralogical studies at AuTec Innovative Extractive Solutions of Vancouver, B.C. 

("AuTec"). 

13.1.2 Samples Tested 

Three metallurgical composites were generated using drillcore from 57 intervals, taken 

from 12 holes selected by Company geologists, in conjunction with QP Martin and 

overseen by Project management.  The composites included: 

 one assaying 0.18% Cu and 0.84 g/t Au from the copper-gold porphyry zone (Domains 
3 and 4 material, as described in Section 7.6); and 

 two from high-grade gold / low-grade copper zones that assayed 0.98 g/t Au and 0.58 
g/t Au, respectively, with less than 0.05% copper (Domain 5 material, as described in 

Section 7.6). 

The objective was in each case to compile composites that reflected the expected average 

grades of the materials on mining.  This was achieved, insofar as the production schedule 

for ROM material from Central Zone, that is (notionally) sent to the plant for processing, 

comprises a mixture of porphyry-related, vein-hosted, high-grade gold material (from 

Domain 5) and porphyry copper-gold material (from Domains 3 and 4), with overall 

average grades of 0.96 g/t Au (with a low of 0.70 g/t Au) and 0.13% Cu. 

In addition to the metallurgical samples described, four composites were prepared from 

separate material for grindability testing.  The samples were taken from intervals at 

different depths from seven drillholes, representing the four major lithologies deemed by 

Company geologists to most likely impact hardness (monzonite, crystal tuff, ash tuff and 

volcanic wacke). 

Figure 13.1 identifies the distribution of the samples outlined, each of which is located 

within and or close to the volume of material expected to fall within the pit shell used to 

constrain the Central Zone Mineral Resources described in Section 14 (the PEA program 

was started before the pit shell used to constrain the Mineral Resources described in Section 

14 was finalized, hence a best estimate of the likely pit shell was made for purposes of 

sample selection).

13.1.3 Mineralogy 

The host rock mineralogy reflects the alteration of the resource: it is comprised of k-

feldspar, sericite, chlorite, carbonates and quartz (see Figure 13.2).  This has some impact 

on flotation efficiency, making the processing of Central Zone material alone somewhat 

challenging.  The impacts of the mineralogy are, however, diluted and efficient processing 

appears to be possible by blending Central Zone material with material from the Donnelly 

Deposit.  A small amount of actinolite was identified in the high-grade Au composite.  

Pyrite dominates the sulphide composition, with chalcopyrite in the porphyry composite 

and arsenopyrite in the high Au composite. 

Figure 13.2 Modal Mineralogy of the Central Zone Composites, Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

 

Gold in the tested samples/composites is mostly discrete and a fraction is quite coarse: 

gravity recovery of 28% was realized from a master composite comprising material from 

all three metallurgical composites, ground to P80 150 microns.  The nugget nature of some 

of the gold was also reflected in some of the challenges encountered in achieving an 

acceptable gold metal balance in some tests.  The gold that was not liberated at the 

projected plant grind size is predominantly associated with pyrite, in the form of discrete, 

fine grains. 

13.1.4 Grindability Testing 

The average Bond Ball Mill work index for the four grindability composites tested within 

the scope of the PEA program was 18.4 kWh/t.  Table 13.1 summarizes the overall 

grindability testwork program for the Central Zone composites.

13.1.5 Leaching 

Gold contained within the tested Central Zone mineralization is amenable to leaching: 

direct leaching of each sample, ground to P80 120 microns and using 1.0 g/L cyanide 

solution, yielded gold extractions of 89% for both the high-grade gold sample and the 

copper-gold porphyry sample.  Furthermore, bulk sulphide flotation, regrinding the 

concentrate and leaching the reground product in conjunction with the flotation tails, 

yielded slightly higher recoveries, averaging 90% for both the high-grade gold and copper-

gold porphyry samples.  Figure 13.3 summarizes this. 

 
Figure 13.3 Integrated Flotation and Leaching of Central Zone Samples, PEA Metallurgical 

Testing Program, Spectrum-GJ Copper-Gold Project 

 

 

Leach times were fast, especially on the concentrate.  While gold recovery was excellent, 

cyanide consumption rates were high and this, combined with the significantly higher 

capital cost of a leaching circuit over flotation, rendered cyanidation of the bulk flotation 

product unattractive. 

Attempts to reduce cyanide consumption by dropping the concentration of cyanide used in 

the concentrate leach were somewhat successful, but led to poorer gold recoveries.  

However, there was a significant difference in gold leach extraction and cyanide 

consumption kinetics, with the gold leach essentially complete after eight hours while 

cyanide consumption was more modest at 2.4 kg/t (versus up to 13 kg/t after 48 hours).  

This difference in leach and cyanide consumption kinetics suggests the possibility of

economic recovery of gold from pyrite concentrates through a short leach residence time, 

which has been exploited in the design of the leaching section of the plant (see also Sub-

Section 13.2.8). 

13.1.6 Flotation 

Twenty two flotation tests were carried out on the three Central Zone metallurgical 

composites.  Eight of these tests were used to determine the recoverability of gold and 

copper to a bulk sulphide flotation concentrate, with a view to possible fine regrinding 

and/or intensive cyanide leaching of the gold.  Gold recoveries to bulk sulphide concentrate 

from higher grade samples reached as high as 96% at mass pull rates of 20%.  In two tests 

the bulk rougher concentrates were cleaned to determine the maximum possible gold grade 

of cleaned bulk sulphide concentrates.  These tests cleaned the concentrates to near-pure 

sulphides, but these assayed only 8 g/t to 9 g/t Au.  In the opinion of QP Martin, these 

grades are too low for the concentrates to be saleable on the open market. 

The majority of the tests were employed to examine the selective recovery of copper and/or 

gold to a high-grade flotation concentrate, with the chalcopyrite and gold floated 

selectively from the pyrite.  The objective of these tests was to determine the recoverability 

of the pay metals to a concentrate that, either alone or blended with Donnelly Deposit 

concentrates, could potentially be saleable.  The copper-gold porphyry material yielded 

concentrate grades of 26% Cu and 130 g/t Au at recoveries of up to 58% and 51%, 

respectively.  The association of finer gold grains with pyrite limited the achievable gold 

recoveries. 

13.2 Donnelly Deposit 

13.2.1 Test Programs 

A limited program of rougher flotation tests was completed in 2005 by Westcoast Mineral 

Testing Inc. of North Vancouver, B.C. (Hawthorn, 2006).  Based on these results, copper 

recoveries of 75% to 85% were projected, into low-grade copper concentrates.  Gold 

recoveries were projected at 60% to 63%.  

In 2015, Teck interpreted the data, as well as some mineralogical data for the Donnelly 

Deposit, thereby to provide some general impressions of likely metallurgy for their GJ 

project (Rairdon, 2015).  No gold recovery predictions were made, but Rairdon (2015): 

 concluded that a conventional porphyry flowsheet would be appropriate for the project, 
with a primary grind size of 150 to 200 microns and a regrind size of 25 to 40 microns; 

 forecast concentrate grades of 24% to 26% Cu at 85% to 87% Cu recovery from copper 
headgrades in the 0.5% to 0.6% range; and 

 suggested that material from the Donnelly Deposit 'will produce a very clean 
concentrate, with very little risk of the project incurring penalties or facing concentrate 

rejection scenarios'. 

It should be emphasized that the conclusions of the study were made without the benefit of 

any additional metallurgical data over the rougher flotation data obtained in 2005.

The PEA program started in late 2016, with the objectives of developing an appropriate 

flowsheet and demonstrating metallurgical responses.  In common with the work carried 

out on Central Zone composites, the program was carried out by Blue Coast, supported by 

Autec.  The flowsheet designed for the PEA has been derived largely from the results of 

the PEA program (see Section 17). 

13.2.2 Samples Tested 

Two metallurgical composites were created using drillcore samples from the Donnelly 

Deposit.  The composites were compiled to ensure they represented the two dominant 

mineralized units: the Mineralized Intrusive domain (the "Intrusive Composite"); and 

sedimentary-volcanic units of the Mixed Domain (the "Sedimentary-Volcanic Composite" 

- see Section 7.6).  Each comprised of a variety of lithologies from a total of 43 drillcore 

intervals from 11 different drillholes at varying depths, within and immediately around the 

volume of material expected to fall within a pit shell used to constrain the Donnelly Deposit 

Mineral Resources described in Section 14 (see Figure 13.3, the PEA program was started 

before the pit shell used to constrain the Mineral Resource described in Section 14 was 

finalized, hence a best estimate of the likely pit shell was made for purposes of sample 

selection).  The samples were selected by Company geologists, in consultation with QP 

Martin and overseen by Project management. 

The Intrusive Composite and Sedimentary-Volcanic Composite assayed 0.39 g/t Au and 

0.56 g/t Au, respectively, and 0.28% and 0.39% Cu, respectively.  These grades reflect well 

the range of plant feed grades expected by virtue of the ROM production schedule for 

Donnelly Pit, presented in Section 16: 

 the average grades of the ROM material (notionally) sent to the plant for processing 
during the first five years of production, when higher-grade material is targeted and 

notionally exploited, are 0.44 g/t Au and 0.41% Cu; 

 the average grades of the ROM material (notionally) mixed with ROM material from 
the Spectrum Pit during production Years 6 through 11 are 0.36 g/t Au and 0.34% Cu; 

and 

 the average grades of the ROM material from Donnelly Pit (notionally) sent to the plant 
for processing over the 23 year production life of Donnelly Pit are 0.32 g/t Au and 

0.28% Cu. 

In addition to the metallurgical composites described, two grindability composites were 

prepared, again representing the Mineralized Intrusive and mineralized sedimentary-

volcanic units of the Mixed Domain (Figure 13.4).  In common with the metallurgical 

composites, each of the grindability composites consisted of a variety of lithologies.

13.2.3 Mineralogy 

The modal mineralogy of the two tested composites is summarized on Figure 13.5.  Copper 

mineralization comprised chalcopyrite only; the only other sulphide mineral present in 

significant abundance was pyrite, which comprised 6% of both composites.  Various 

feldspars comprised 43% to 50% of the material, while quartz comprised a further 25%. 

Carbonates (11%) were the next most abundant mineral group, comprising calcite and 

ferroan dolomite.  In marked contrast to the Central Zone composites, clays were notably 

absent.

Textural analysis of the chalcopyrite pointed to medium- to coarse-grained mineralization, 

with approximately 70% of the copper sulphide being liberated at 120 microns.  This 

typically points to selection of a moderately coarse primary grind size (for example, P80 

150 to 200 microns). 

13.2.4 Grindability Testing 

The average Bond Ball Mill Work Index from the two samples was 19.8 kWh/t.  JK 'RTB 

Lite' testing at Autec yielded a SAG milling Axb value of 37.3, while the crusher work 

index was measured at 7.2 kWh/t (Table 13.2).

13.2.5 Gravity Recovery 

The two Donnelly Deposit composites were subjected to gravity recovery testing using a 

Knelson concentrator.  Both composites contained a small amount of gravity recoverable 

gold, with recoveries ranging from 9% to 24%, but to low-grade concentrates.  This 

suggested that, in combination with gravity concentrates from Central Zone feed and the 

pyrite concentrates described in Sub-Section 13.2.8: 

 economic cyanidation of the gravity and pyrite concentrates could be realized; and 

 once the required capital for a cyanidation plant had been paid off, it could be 
economically sustained at the expected Donnelly Deposit ROM feed grades. 

A preliminary trade-off study using factored capital and operating cost estimates of and for 

cyanidation of (low-grade) gravity concentrates from 100% Donnelly feed suggested a 

much longer pay-back period for the required capital expenditures, which outcome did not 

meet project planning objectives.  A cyanidation plant for pyrite-rich products (plus an 

Acacia intensive cyanidation plant for gravity concentrates) was, therefore, deferred until 

Central Zone plant feed came online.  It was further assumed that a refinery-grade gravity 

concentrate would be sold during the early project years. 

13.2.6 Flotation 

The mineralogy, and earlier studies by Rairdon (2015), pointed to Donnelly Deposit 

material being responsive to a conventional copper-gold flotation flowsheet, as practiced 

at several current B.C. operations.  As such, the flowsheet was assumed to include primary 

grinding, copper rougher flotation, concentrate regrinding and two or three stages of 

laboratory cleaning (substituted in practice with column flotation).  The presence of coarse 

gold, especially in Central Zone material, meant that gravity recovery would probably be 

incorporated in the circuit. 

Twenty one batch, rougher and cleaner flotation tests were used to create the flowsheet 

employed for purposes of the PEA.  The tested parameters included primary grind size, 

collector dosage and residence time in the copper and pyrite floats.  Lime was used as a pH 

modifier to aid in the depression of pyrite in the copper circuit.  For the sake of simplicity, 

the rougher pH was fixed at 10.5, which is typical of many B.C. Cu-Au circuits.  Copper 

rougher recoveries of over 90% were achieved in many tests.  Gold recoveries were closely 

linked with mass pull and approached 80%, at 10% mass pull. 

Recoveries improved with primary grind size: while the incremental improvement in 

recoveries dropped at sizes finer than 150 microns, a preliminary trade-off study, using 

factored capital and operating cost estimates, pointed to the optimum recovery being close 

to P80 120 microns.  The chosen rougher flotation treatment scheme also included a small

dose of potassium amyl xanthate collector (4.0 g/t), MIBC frother and a short laboratory 

rougher residence time of six minutes. 

Regrinding was shown to be beneficial in cleaner flotation, but the regrind size was not 

optimized.  Regrind sizes close to or finer than P80 20 microns were employed.  Three 

stages of cleaning at pH 11 with small doses of potassium amyl xanthate yielded saleable 

grade copper concentrates, typically at 80% copper recovery or higher.  The metallurgical 

responses from the composites representing the intrusive and sedimentary volcanic units 

were similar.  

Two locked cycle tests, testing different primary grind sizes, were carried out on a blended 

composite of Donnelly Deposit material comprising the two Domain types of interest.  

Both tests stabilized well, thereby validating the flowsheet. The projected metallurgy from 

the two tests is summarized on Tables 13.3 and 13.4.

13.2.7 Co-Mingled Flotation 

Batch-scale testing was carried out on a blend of feed materials comprising 25% from the 

Central Zone and 75% from the Donnelly Deposit.  The tests demonstrated that concentrate 

grades of 20% to 25% Cu could be made.  Recoveries from these unoptimized tests were 

lower than with the identical processing of material from Donnelly Deposit alone: 

recoveries were typically 4% to 6% lower for copper and 5% to 7% lower for gold, at any 

given concentrate grade.  In QP Martin's opinion, with fine tuning the difference in 

performance could probably be reduced. 

13.2.8 Pyrite Rougher Concentrate 

A pyrite concentrate from Donnelly Deposit material was floated after copper flotation.  

This was combined with the copper first cleaner tails that were reground and leached.  This

material, containing 20% to 21% of the gold in the ROM plant feed, yielded 48% extraction 

after four hours, with 2.4 kg/t cyanide consumption.  Preliminary economic analysis 

indicated such a process, including carbon handling and cyanide destruction, could be 

economic so this was incorporated into the process flowsheet for the PEA. 

13.3 Copper Concentrate Characterization 

A concentrate sample from testing of blended Donnelly Deposit material was subjected to ICP 

analysis to determine if any minor elements were present at concentrations sufficient to attract a 

penalty.  Table 13.5 summarizes the results.  It may be seen that arsenic (As) is present at 0.026%, 

antimony (Sb) at 0.066% and mercury (Hg solid) at 6 ppm.  At these levels and in the opinion of 

QP Martin, none of the potentially deleterious elements are likely to trigger penalties at most 

smelters.  It may also be seen that silver (Ag) is present at a high enough level to attract by-product 

payments.

A similar analysis to that summarized on Table 13.5 was obtained of copper concentrate floated 

from a 25% blend of Central Zone material.  This also showed the concentrate to be free from 

deleterious elements such as arsenic (As), antimony (Sb) and mercury (Hg).  

13.4 Tailings Characterization 

Samples of pyrite concentrate, copper cleaner tails and rougher tails from a test on material from 

the Donnelly Pit were submitted for ABA analysis and multi-element analysis.  The pyrite 

concentrate and the copper cleaner tails will be co-mingled and, after leaching and cyanide 

destruction, be delivered to the potentially acid generating ("PAG") portion of the planned TSF 

where they will always be under water.  The rougher tails will be delivered to the non-acid 

generating ("NAG") portion of the same TSF (i.e. at the front, behind the dam).

13.5 Metallurgical Forecast 

The metallurgical forecast has assumed a process flowsheet described in Section 17 (Recovery 

Methods), which creates saleable products in the form of a copper-gold flotation concentrate and 

a gold-silver rich doré. 

To align with the mine production schedule presented in Section 16, metallurgical performance 

has been projected for plant feed comprising 100% Donnelly Deposit material and for co-mingled 

plant feed containing 75% Donnelly Deposit material and 25% Central Zone material.   The key 

drivers in recovery were: 

 Cu recoveries are as demonstrated from locked cycle testwork and, in the case of the Central 
Zone / Donnelly Deposit blend, penalized to reflect its typical difference in recovery in batch 

testing, compared with that achieved from 100% Donnelly Deposit material; 

 Au recoveries to doré included gravity recovered gold (penalized to reflect expected gravity 
cleaning losses ahead of Acacia leaching) and gold recovered in leach tests on sulphide 

products products  (a 1% carbon and solution based gold loss was included); 

 Au recoveries to flotation concentrate reflect locked cycle data, minus that reporting to the 
Acacia leach feed from the gravity circuit; and 

 Ag metallurgy was calculated in a similar fashion to gold, and it was assumed the recovery of 
silver to the gravity concentrate would be negligible.

Table 13.7 summarizes the metallurgical forecast.  It has been assumed that the metallurgy from 

any blend of materials from Spectrum Pit and Donnelly Pit, besides a 100% Donnelly Pit feed and 

75%:25% blended Donnelly Pit and Spectrum Pit feeds, would be calculated by interpolation or 

extrapolation of these two results, to a minimum of 70% Donnelly Pit feed.

13.6 Ramp-Up Profiles 

A ramp-up in throughput on start-up has been assumed with a target of 80% of nameplate 

throughput being achieved in Production Year 1.  In reality, all selected major equipment is rated 

to achieve throughput rates slightly higher than those projected in both Stage 1 (10,000 tpd) and 

Stage 2 (20,000 tpd, including 5,000 tpd from Spectrum Pit) of the planned production schedule. 

It is rare for plants to achieve target recoveries from Day 1.  Accordingly, a ramp-up in recoveries 

has been assumed on start-up, based on published, post-start up performance numbers for a 

selection of operating B.C. copper mines.  Table 13.8 summarizes the recommended recovery 

ramp-up profiles.  Figure 13.6 summarizes the metallurgical recovery profiles by metal and project 

stage, as detailed in the PEA cashflow model and per Tables 13.7 and 13.8.

13.7 Qualified Person's Opinion 

The metallurgical and mineralogical testwork completed to support the PEA has been completed 

at reputable Canadian testwork laboratories under the direct supervision of QP Martin.  The 

metallurgical data provided in this Technical Report can, therefore, be considered to be of high 

quality and is of a level of robustness expected for a study of this magnitude.  All chemical assays 

for base- and precious-metals were performed at reputable Canadian assay laboratories using 

conventional assay techniques and procedures. 

The comments made in this section of this Technical Report are based on the samples as received 

by the testing laboratory.  The sources of the samples has been described in the Sub-Sections 13.1.2 

and 13.2.2.  However, however beyond this information, no commentary can be made by QP 

Martin of the representativity of the samples, either lithologically or spatially to the potentially 

mined resources.   

Owing to its far great tonnage contribution to the plant feed mix, metallurgy is mainly dictated by 

the material from the Donnelly Deposit.  This material is moderately hard and resistant to grinding, 

falling quite close to the median hardness levels for the B.C. copper-gold industry. 

Copper in Donnelly Deposit material occurs as chalcopyrite, with a grain size that is somewhat 

finer than is typical in B.C. mines.  Gangue mineralization is straightforward and benign from a 

processing perspective.  Accordingly, the projected primary grind (at P80 120 microns) is slightly 

finer than typical of most recent projects in the province.  However, the copper sulphides float well 

and copper recoveries of approximately 90% can be expected using conventional copper roughing,

a moderately fine concentrate regrind and copper cleaner flotation.  The copper concentrate is of 

saleable grade and free from deleterious elements that would typically attract smelter penalties. 

Gold is mostly in discrete form and is mostly recoverable.  An estimated 10% is recoverable by 

gravity in the grinding circuit, but a further 55% can be floated with the copper to the final bulk 

Cu-Au concentrate (a gold-rich, copper concentrate).  The gold that is not captured in the copper 

flotation circuit is typically associated with pyrite and can be floated to a pyrite concentrate that 

responds to cyanide leaching.  Total gold recoveries are projected to be approximately 73%.  

Central Zone material contains more altered mineralization and reports lower average copper 

grades.  This makes floating a saleable copper product more difficult when treated in isolation, but 

when blended with Donnelly Deposit material this problem is largely overcome.  Copper 

recoveries are lower, at close to 50%, but gold recoveries by a combination of gravity, flotation 

and leaching are similar to those for Donnelly Deposit material.  The presence of nugget gold in 

Central Zone material enhances the need for a gravity unit in the ball milling circuit. 

A process flowsheet has been developed that has been demonstrated in the laboratory to respond 

to the processing of Donnelly Deposit material, as well as blends of Central Zone and Donnelly 

Deposit material, at least up a ratio of 25% Central Zone and 75% Donnelly Deposit material.  This

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

David G. Thomas, P. Geo., ("QP Thomas") is responsible for this section of this Technical Report.  

QP Thomas works as an independent mineral resource geologist with the geological consulting 

firm DKT Geosolutions Inc. of Vancouver, B.C. ("DKT"). 

14.1 2017 Mineral Resource Statement 

The updated (2017) Mineral Resource estimates for the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit are 

presented on Table 14.1.  The estimates were prepared in accordance with the Canadian Institute 

of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 

(2014).  The estimate for the Central Zone is based on 164 diamond drillholes (88 completed by 

the Company) totalling 34,597.54 m and 22,581 assay intervals.  The estimate for the Donnelly 

Deposit is based on 176 diamond drillholes (eight completed by the Company) totalling 48,325.27 

m and 16,410 assay intervals. 

The majority of the historical drillcore for both deposits is still available at site.  A significant 

portion of the Spectrum material was re-logged and re-sampled by Company staff, as part of the 

Company's on-going Quality Assurance/Quality Control ("QA/QC") program of check assaying.  

All of the available, historical Donnelly core was previously re-logged (and partially re-sampled) 

by Teck.

Basis of Estimate 

QP Thomas reviewed the Company's QA/QC programs on the Mineral Resources data.  After removing samples with data 

quality issues, the QP concludes that the collar, survey, assay, and lithology data are adequate to support Mineral 

Resources estimation. 

Domains were modelled in 3D to separate mineralized rock types from surrounding waste rock.  The domains were 

modelled based on a combination of lithology, copper grades and gold grades.  

Raw drillhole assays were composited to 4 m lengths broken at domain boundaries.  

Capping of high grades was considered necessary and was completed for each domain on assays prior to compositing. 

Block grades for gold and silver were estimated from the composites using an ordinary kriging interpolation method into 

4 m x 4 m x 4 m blocks for Central Zone, and into 10 m x 10 m x 8 m blocks for the Donnelly Deposit.  

Dry bulk density varies by domain.  The dry bulk densities are based on 858 specific gravity measurements for Central 

Zone and 1,316 measurements for the Donnelly Deposit. 

Blocks were classified as Indicated and Inferred in accordance with CIM Definition Standards, 2014.  

For Central Zone, the results of a comparison with the previous Mineral Resource model, a drillhole spacing study and 

conditional simulation of gold grades were used to support the classification of Indicated Mineral Resources (Indicated 

Mineral Resources are classified on the basis of blocks falling within a drillhole spacing of 40 m x 40 m).  Inferred Mineral 

Resources are classified on the basis of blocks falling within a drillhole spacing which varied by domain - for Domains 2 

and 3 a spacing of 150 m was used and for Domains 4 and 5 a drillhole spacing of 75 m was used.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

For the Donnelly Deposit, Indicated Mineral Resources are classified on the basis of blocks falling within a drillhole 

spacing of 75 m.  Inferred Mineral Resources are classified using a drillhole spacing of approximately 150 m. 

The Mineral Resource estimate is constrained within optimized pits with average slope angles of 45°.  Metal prices of 

US$1,250/oz Au, US$2.75/lb Cu and US$17.75/oz Ag were used along with metallurgical recovery rates of 73% for gold, 

90% for copper and 50% for silver and the estimated on-site operating costs. 

Cautionary Notes 

The contained copper, gold and silver values shown on Table 14.1 are in situ.  No assurance can be given that the 

estimated quantities will be produced.  All values have been rounded to reflect accuracy and to comply with securities 

regulatory requirements.  Summations within the tables may not agree due to rounding. 

Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral 

resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing, or 

other relevant issues. 

The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Mineral Resources in this estimation are conceptual in nature.  There has been 

insufficient exploration to define these resources as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if 

further exploration will result in upgrading them to an indicated or measured mineral resource category. 

Minimum Grade Cut-off  

Minimum grade cut-offs for the Mineral Resource estimates were determined using the metal prices, metallurgical recovery 

rates and operating costs as outlined above, as well as smelter terms and applicable royalties applied to the following 

formula, the result of which is multiplied by 31.1035 to yield a precious metal cut-off but divided by 2,204.62 (assuming the 

metric system) and then multiplied by 100 to yield a base metal cut-off:  

  Xc = [(Mm - Mw) + (Po - Pw) + (Oo - Ow)] / {[r · (V – R)] · (1 – Gr)} 

where: 

Mm = the all-in unit cost of mining and delivering one ton of material to the primary crusher  

Mw = the unit cost of mining, transporting and dumping one ton of waste on the waste dump  

Po = the unit cost of processing one ton of material (from primary crushing to production of a final, saleable 

  product, inclusive of supervision and labour costs, consumables) 

Pw = the unit cost of processing one ton of waste (inclusive of labour costs and consumables associated with 

  avoiding potential water contamination and/or acid generation, as well as to satisfy any other  

  applicable regulatory and environmental requirements) 

Oo = the cost of on-site G&A 

Ow = the unit cost of the additional on-site G&A associated with processing one ton of waste 

r = recovery, or % of valuable product recovered on processing the mined material to a final saleable 

  product 

V = the value of one unit of the final saleable product 

R = smelting, refining, transportation and other costs incurred per unit of final saleable product 

Gr = payable NSR royalty (percent) 

Grade Equivalence 

Grade equivalence for the Mineral Resource estimates were determined using the metal prices and metallurgical recovery 

rates summarized above, as well as smelter terms applied to the following formula: 

AuEq = Au grade + [(Ag grade · (Ag revenue / Au revenue)] + [Cu grade · (Cu revenue / Au revenue)] 

CuEq = (Cu grade + [(Au grade · (Au revenue / Cu revenue)] + [Ag grade · (Ag revenue / Cu revenue)] 

where: 

Au revenue = (1 / 31.1035) · Au plant recovery · Au smelter recovery · Au refinery recovery · unit Au price 

Ag revenue = (1 / 31.1035) · Ag plant recovery · Ag smelter recovery · Ag refinery recovery · unit Ag price 

Cu revenue = 2,204.62 · 0.01 · Cu plant recovery · Cu smelter recovery · Cu refinery recovery · unit Cu price

14.3 Key Assumptions/Basis of Estimates 

QP Thomas reviewed the Mineral Resource data for the Company's Spectrum-GJ project and 

removed several low-confidence (due to magnetic host rocks) downhole survey measurements 

from the database.  QP Thomas considers the verified drillhole collar, downhole survey, assay and 

lithology data to be adequate to support Mineral Resource estimation (see Section 12). 

There are a total of 164 drillholes (88 were completed by the Company) totaling 34,597.54 m and 

22,581 assay intervals within the Central Zone database used to support Mineral Resource 

estimation, not including the four holes drilled by Imperial Oil in 1973 (463.44 m).  There are a 

total of 176 drillholes (eight were completed by the Company) totaling 48,325.27 m and 16,410 

assay intervals within the Donnelly Deposit database used to support Mineral Resource estimation 

(Table 14.4 and Section 10).  Drillholes have intercepted mineralization to depths of 450 m in the 

Central Zone and 727 m in the Donnelly Deposit (Teck drillhole GJK-13-238 on Section 3950).

DKT was provided with the drillhole databases in Microsoft Access databases and in MS Excel® 

files.  The co-ordinates are in the NAD83 UTM Zone 9 North.  The database cut-off date for 

Mineral Resource estimate purposes was January 06, 2017.  QP Thomas imported the collar, 

survey, lithology and assay data into MineSight®, a commercial mining software program. 

Topography was based on a digital surface supplied by the Company, which has contour lines 

spaced two metres apart.  The topography is based upon GeoEye images collected at a resolution 

of 50 cm.  QP Thomas compared the drillhole collars with the topographic surface and found only 

minor differences (less than one metre) in elevation between the surveyed drillhole collars and the 

topography.  No corrections were made to the drillhole collar elevations. 

14.4 Domain Models 

14.4.1 Central Zone 

Copper-gold mineralization in the Central Zone is hosted by Late Triassic to Early Jurassic-

aged monzonite intrusives and Triassic-aged Stuhini volcanic and sedimentary rocks (see 

Section 7).  The mineralization is of three predominant types: 

 lower grade porphyry-style Cu-Au mineralization occurring within a north-south 
striking, west-dipping zone, with dimensions of 950 m in a north-south direction and 

an average thickness of 100 m to 150 m and containing mineralization that is enriched 

in gold relative to copper with an Au:Cu ratio (Au g/t to Cu%) of approximately 3:1; 

 a mixed type of higher grade copper-gold mineralization that is believed to represent 
overprinting of earlier porphyry-style mineralization by later-stage Au mineralization, 

which - 

o tends to flank the porphyry mineralization with an Au:Cu ratio (Au g/t to Cu%) of 
approximately 6.5:1, 

o occurs close to surface and has dimensions of approximately 650 m in a north-south 
direction, a horizontal width of 100 m and a vertical thickness of up to 175 m, and 

o is bounded to the south by a series of minor west-northwest to east-southeast 
striking faults; and 

 gold-dominated mineralization hosted by the Stuhini group volcanic and sedimentary 
rocks to the east of the porphyry and mixed mineralization types, which –  

o occurs to vertical depths of up to 400 m and over a lateral, north-south distance of 
approximately 650 m and over a highly variable distance in the east-west direction, 

and 

o has poorly understood controls on its distribution that are likely to be lithological 
and structural in nature. 

Minor mineralization is also present in other domains as structurally controlled 

mineralization in proximity to brecciated lithologic contacts.  Figure 14.1 is a MineSight® 

snapshot of the Central Zone domain model, which repeats the geological domain model 

defined in Section 7.6.

14.4.2 Donnelly Deposit 

Mineralization in the Donnelly Deposit is hosted in Triassic-aged Stuhini volcanic and 

sedimentary rocks which have been intruded by the late-Triassic to early Jurassic-aged 

Groat Stock (see Section 7). The mineralization is unconformably overlain by 

unmineralized, Lower Jurassic-aged Hazelton volcanic rocks, it dips at approximately 70° 

to the south, it is abruptly truncated to the north by an east-west striking fault and it is 

locally offset by north-south striking faults.  The mineralized zone is approximately 1,850 

m long in the (east-west) strike direction, approximately 350 m in the north-south direction 

and up to 575 m in the vertical direction.  The overall Au:Cu ratio (Au g/t to Cu%) is 

approximately 1:1.  Figure 14.2 is a MineSight® snapshot of the Donnelly Deposit domain 

model, which repeats the geological domain model defined in Section 7.6.

14.5 Central Zone Mineral Resource Estimate 

14.5.1 Wireframe Models and Mineralization 

The Company provided DKT with three-dimensional models of the Central Zone 

mineralization based on a combination of lithology, structure and geochemistry. QP 

Thomas reviewed the wireframe models in section and plan and concluded that they reflect 

the distribution of the different mineralization types.  QP Thomas also inspected the 

drillholes displaying copper and gold grades.  No significant zones of mineralization were 

found to fall outside of the wireframes.  

Gold mineralization in Domain 60 (late monzonite intrusive) is restricted to the contact 

with Domain 50 (Stuhini East – higher grade gold).   Discontinuous gold mineralization is 

also found along the contact between Domain 70 (feldspar porphyry) and Domain 50.  In 

consequence of this, QP Thomas created wireframe models of the Domain 60 and Domain 

70 mineralized zones, using drillhole intercepts with Minesight's implicit modeler.  Each

14.5.2 Exploratory Data Analysis 

Exploratory data analysis ("EDA") comprised basic statistical evaluation of the assays and 

composites for gold, silver, copper and sample length.  QP Thomas constructed contact 

plots to evaluate the changes in grade across domain boundaries. 

14.5.3 Assays 

Histograms and Probability Plots 

Log-scaled histograms and probability plots for gold within Domain 50 show limited 

evidence for mixed populations.  The log-scaled histogram for Domain 50 instead shows 

the presence of a long high-grade tail, comprising between 5% and 10% of the samples. 

Spatially, the higher grades are clustered in discrete zones.  QP Thomas concluded that this 

amount of included higher-grade material warrants further domaining.  The gold 

histograms and probability plots for Domain 50 are presented as Figure 14.3. 

Grade Capping/Outlier Restrictions 

QP Thomas evaluated length weighted, normal-scaled and log-scaled histograms and 

probability plots of the assays to separately define grade outliers for gold, silver and copper 

within each of the domains.   The capping grade thresholds and the amount of metal 

removed within the domains are summarized on Tables 14.6 (for gold), 14.7 (for silver) 

and 14.8 (for copper).  Capping was completed on the assays prior to compositing.

Assay Statistics 

QP Thomas tabulated length-weighted statistics for gold, silver and copper within each 

domain. The summary statistics are also summarized on Tables 14.6, 14.7 and 14.8.  The 

statistics show that Domains 30, 40 and 50 have significantly higher means for all three 

elements and that Domains 30 and 40 have higher means for copper than the other domains.  

Contact Plots 

QP Thomas plotted gold and copper grades in distance bins from domain contacts.  The 

plots were used to select boundary conditions during grade estimation.  A matrix of the 

boundary conditions between domains was tabulated and the contacts were classified as 

either Soft (little change in grade across contact), Firm (gradational change in grade) or 

Hard (sharp change in grade).  The contact matrices for gold and copper are summarized 

on Table 14.9.  The critical contacts are those between Domains 30, 40 and 50.  The contact 

between Domains 30 and 40 is hard for gold and soft for copper.  Contact plots for Domains 

30 and 40 for gold and copper are presented as Figures 14.4 and 14.5. The contact between 

Domain 50 and 60 for gold is classified as Firm; a grade shell in Domain 60 was used to 

constrain the estimation of mineralization close to the contact between Domains 50 and 60.

Silver Regression 

The number of silver assays in the database is significantly lower than the number of gold 

and copper assays.  QP Thomas examined scatterplots of gold and copper against silver by 

domain to evaluate whether silver values could be assigned by linear regression.  Only 

Domains 40 and 60 showed a correlation coefficient greater than 0.6.  In Domain 40, 

missing silver values were estimated from copper assays using the intercept and slope 

summarized on Table 14.10.  In Domain 60, missing silver values were estimated from 

gold assays using the intercept and slopes summarized on Table 14.10.

Assay EDA Summary 

The coefficient of variation ("CV") values of the capped gold assays within the domains 

are generally below two, apart from Domains 20, 50, 60 and 70.  QP Thomas concluded 

that further domaining of the higher gold grades in Domain 50 was warranted whereas 

further domaining of the low-grade gold, silver and copper values in other domains is not 

warranted.

14.5.4 Composites 

The weight of influence of each sample assay interval was regularized by compositing the 

drillhole data into 4.0 m lengths using the mineralization zone domain boundaries to break 

the composites.  The original samples are mostly 2.0 m in length.  A 4.0 m composite 

length was chosen to approximate a 4 m bench height.  Composites with lengths less than 

2.0 m were back-stitched so that the composites are greater than 3.0 m and less than 6.0 m 

in length. 

Summaries of the 3.0 m composite statistics are presented on Tables 14.11 (for gold), 14.12 

(for silver) and 14.13 (for copper).  It may be seen that the length-weighted mean copper 

and gold grades of the 4.0 m length composites are very similar to those of the assays.  QP 

Thomas is, therefore, confident that the compositing process is working as intended.  

Capped gold composites within Domain 50 have a very high CV value of 3.46, which 

indicates that further domaining is warranted.

14.5.5 Indicator Sub-Domaining 

As a result of the high CV within Domain 5 identified by EDA, a probabilistic indicator 

model was created.  The indicator grade threshold was selected by minimizing the total CV 

of the grades above and below the threshold (shown on Figure 14.6).  A threshold of 2.0 

g/t was selected. 

 
Figure 14.6 A Plot of Cumulative CV Against Gold Grade Threshold, Domain 5, 

Central Zone, Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

 

The composites with a value of one were coded if the gold grade was ≥ 2 g/t Au and a code 

of 0 if the grade was below 2.0 g/t Au.  The composite indicator values were used to 

estimate block indicator values using ordinary kriging ("OK"). A nearest-neighbour 

("NN") model was estimated and assumed to represent an unbiased estimate of the 

proportion of blocks above the grade threshold.  A threshold indicator value of 0.088 was 

selected in the OK model such that a close approximation of the number of blocks with an 

indicator value of one in the NN model is achieved (see Table 14.14).

Blocks were coded above and below this indicator threshold.  A limited amount of dilution 

was introduced by creating a transition zone with a width of two blocks on either side of 

the boundary between the lower-grade and higher-grade subdomains.  The composites 

were then back-tagged with the codes from the blocks.  The codes for the transition zones 

are presented in Sub-Section 14.3.7.  Summary statistics of the coded composites are 

summarized on Table 14.15.  Overall the indicator coding is successful in separating low-

grade mineralization from higher grade mineralization.

14.5.6 Variography 

Downhole and directional correlograms were constructed for gold, silver and copper grades 

within the domains.  A single spherical model, a nested exponential model and a nugget 

effect were used to fit the experimental correlograms.  Tables 14.16 through 14.18 

summarize the results for gold (Table 14.16), silver (Table 14.17) and copper (Table 

14.18).

14.5.7 Estimation/Interpolation Methods 

The block model consists of regular blocks (4 m along strike x 4 m across strike x 4 m 

vertically).  The block size was chosen such that geological contacts would be reasonably 

well reflected and to support selective mining scenarios.  

QP Thomas used an OK grade interpolation method in three passes, using Minesight®.  

Grade estimation used a composite and block matching scheme based on the domain codes. 

For example, composites coded to Domain 50 were only used to estimate blocks falling 

within Domain 50.  The same grade estimation plan was used for gold and silver.  For 

copper, estimation of blocks in Domains 30 and 40 used composite sharing (i.e. a soft 

boundary).  Blocks in Domain 30 used composites from both Domains 30 and 40. 

In Domain 50, the gold indicator subdomain was used as a firm boundary, using the 

composite sharing schemes summarized on Tables 14.19 and 14.20.  For example, in the 

first estimation pass, blocks coded as 10 were interpolated using only composites with the 

same code.  Blocks coded 50 were interpolated using composites coded 50, 60 and 80. 

Tables 14.21 (for Pass 1), 14.22 (for Pass 2) and 14.23 (for Pass 3) summarize the 

composite restrictions and search distances for the gold estimation domains.  A slightly 

longer search distance was selected in the horizontal strike direction of the wireframe based 

on the variogram and visual inspection of a long-section along the strike of the deposit 

which shows a sub-horizontal plunge to the higher-grade mineralization.

14.5.8 Density Assignment 

Average SG values were assigned to each domain.  The average SG values have been used 

directly as the dry bulk density to report the tonnage estimates of the Mineral Resource.  

The rock types intercepted in the drillholes are generally not porous, therefore the amount 

of porosity is not expected to cause a significant difference between the SG and bulk 

density.   

A total of 870 SG determinations have been performed on drillcore samples collected from 

material within the Central Zone mineralized zones.  The determinations were carried out 

at site by Company geologists, using the unsealed immersion technique to measure the 

weight of each sample in air and in water.  Analysis by QP Thomas of the SG database for 

Central Zone revealed 12 anomalous results (high and low values) that were removed as 

being unreliable, leaving a total of 858 measurements used for the Mineral Resource 

estimate (Table 14.24).  The Company's check measurement program is discussed in 

Section 12.4.

14.5.9 Block Model Validation 

The Central Zone block model was validated to ensure appropriate honouring of the input 

data.  NN grade models were interpolated from a set of four metre composites to validate 

the OK grade models.   

Visual Inspection 

A visual inspection of block grade versus composited data in section and plan view was 

carried out.  The visual inspection of block grade versus composited data showed a good 

reproduction of the data by the model.  Figure 14.7 is an east-west oriented cross-section.

Metal Removed by Capping 

The impact of capping was evaluated by estimating uncapped and capped NN and OK 

grade models.  The capped models show lower amounts of metal removed than the amounts 

calculated during the grade capping study on the assays.  However, the amounts of metal 

removed from the OK models are consistent with the metal removed from the NN models.  

In QP Thomas' opinion, the difference between the metal removed from the assays and 

NN models is likely caused by the de-clustering effect.

Global Bias Checks 

A comparison between the OK and NN estimates was completed on classified blocks to 

check for global bias in the grade estimates.  Differences were generally within acceptable 

levels (<5% for the Indicated category and <10% for the Inferred category). Summary 

statistics are presented on Table 14.25.

Silver (g/t) 1.0 2,414,172 1.0 2,414,172 3.5% 

 

Local Bias Checks 

A check for local bias was carried out by plotting the average gold and copper grades of 

composites, NN and OK models in swaths oriented along the model northings, eastings 

and elevations.  QP Thomas reviewed the swath plots and found only minor discrepancies 

between the NN and OK model grades.   In areas where there is significant extrapolation 

beyond the drillholes, the swath plots indicate less agreement for all variables. 

Figure 14.8 is the gold swath plot; the copper swath plot is presented as Figure 14.9.  The 

upper swath plots show grades, the lower swath plots show number of blocks or 

composites.  The RED lines represent OK model, the BLUE lines represent the NN model 

and the BLACK lines represent composites. 

Grade Smoothing/Model Selectivity Checks 

A check on grade smoothing (model selectivity) was completed for potential openpit 

mining using a global change-of-support correction (Hermite Polynomial or "Herco") to 

the NN model.  The check was completed for gold in Domains 30, 40 and 50.  The results 

show that in Domains 40 and 50 the amount of smoothing is acceptable for a block size of 

4 m x 4 m x 4 m.  Grade-tonnage curves comparing the OK model to the reference Herco 

is presented on Figures 14.10 (Domain 30), 14.11 (Domain 40) and 14.12 (Domain 50).  It 

may be seen that the grade-tonnage curve for Domain 30 shows acceptable smoothing for 

a block size of 8 m x 8 m x 8 m.  DKT notes that Domain 30 is a lower grade domain which 

would likely be mined with a less selective mining method.  It is, therefore, reasonable to 

assume a larger block size to check grade smoothing for this domain.

14.5.10 Classification of Mineral Resources 

QP Thomas reviewed the geological model, data quality and geological continuity for 

classification of mineral resources.  The mineralized domain wireframes are supported by 

drilling with a spacing of between 25 m and over 150 m.  A 150 m distance is sufficient to 

assume that the mineralization is continuous between drillholes in Domains 20 and 30 

where low-grade more continuous mineralization is present.  A distance of 60 m in 

Domains 4 and 5 is more appropriate to assume mineralization continuity due to the larger 

amount of grade variability.  

An analysis of confidence limits was carried out using quarterly panels of production for a 

4,500 t/day openpit mine operation.  The accuracy of grade estimates was then scaled to 

annual production.  An accuracy of 15% or better at a 90% confidence limit on annual 

production was used as the criteria to select a drillhole spacing to be used to classify 

Indicated Mineral Resources.  The results (Figure 14.13) show that a drillhole spacing of 

40 m (along the easting) x 40 m (along the northing) is sufficient to classify Indicated 

Mineral Resources.

Blocks in Domains 30, 40 and 50 were classified to the Indicated category using the 

following criteria: 

 a maximum distance to the closest hole of 30.0 m; 

 a maximum distance to the second hole of 38.5 m; and 

 a maximum average distance from two holes of 30 m (approximately half the diagonal 
distance within a 40 m x 40 m grid, with a 10% contingency).  

Blocks in Domains 20 and 30 were classified to the Inferred category using the following 

criteria: 

 a maximum distance to the closest hole of 120 m; 

 a maximum distance to the second hole of 150 m; and 

 a maximum average distance from two holes of 120 m. 

Blocks in Domain 50 were classified to the Inferred category using the following criteria: 

 a maximum distance to the closest hole of 60 m; 

 a maximum distance to the second hole of 75 m; and 

 a maximum average distance from two holes of 60 m. 

The distance-based classification was smoothed to remove isolated Inferred and Indicated 

blocks.  The algorithm used for smoothing minimizes the change in relative proportions of 

blocks in each category.  Figure 14.14 is an east-west cross-section view of the resulting 

resource classification.

14.5.11 Comparison with the Previous (2016) Mineral Resource Estimate 

Table 14.26 provides a comparison between the previous (2016) Mineral Resource 

estimate, detailed in the May 2016 Technical Report cited in Section 2.5, with the 2017 

Mineral Resource estimate that is the subject of this Technical Report and which is 

presented in Section 14.1, for a grade cut-off of 0.40 g/t AuEq.  The changes reflected on 

Table 14.26 are a result of: 

 additional drilling, in 2016, of 6,027.6 m in 21 holes, primarily along the western side 
of the deposit; 

 changes to grade estimation domains (the 2017 model uses a combination of lithology 
and grade to define domains, rather than the grade-based approach used for the 2016 

estimate); 

 changes to the grade estimation plan; 

 use of change-of-support analysis to calibrate the model to anticipated mining 
selectivity; 

 changes to the Mineral Resource classification methodology;

14.6 Donnelly Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate 

14.6.1 Wireframe Models and Mineralization 

The Company provided DKT with wireframe models based on a combination of lithology, 

mineralization, copper grades and gold grades.  QP Thomas reviewed the wireframe 

models and found the wireframe boundaries correctly honour the drillhole intercepts.   QP 

Thomas also inspected drillholes displaying gold and copper grades; no significant zones 

of mineralization were found to fall outside of the wireframes.  However, some gaps in the 

lithological models were found during the coding of blocks, which were populated using a 

NN lithology assignment.  Each zone was then coded separately.  The zone codes are 

summarized on Table 14.27.  The wireframe model used to constrain the Mineral Resource 

estimate is earlier presented as Figure 14.2.

Histograms and Probability Plots 

Log-scaled histograms and probability plots for copper, gold and silver within the zones 

show no evidence for mixed populations.  QP Thomas concludes that further domaining is 

not warranted.  Figures 14.15 and 14.16 are gold histograms and probability plots for 

Domain 10 and Domain 50, respectively.

 Grade Capping/Outlier Restrictions 

Length-weighted, normal-scaled and log-scaled histograms and probability plots of the 

assays were evaluated to define grade outliers for gold, silver and copper within each of 

the domains separately.  The capping grade thresholds and the amount of metal removed 

within the domains are summarized on Tables 14.28 (for gold), Table 14.29 (for silver) and 

Table 14.30 (for copper).  Capping was completed on the assays prior to compositing.  

Capping thresholds that are somewhat higher than might otherwise selected (based on the 

histograms and probability plots) as the higher grades occur spatially clustered in steeply 

plunging higher-grade zones within the mineralization. 

 Assay Statistics 

Summary length-weighted statistics for gold, silver and copper within each domain were 

also tabulated.  Tables 14.28 through 14.30 also summarize the statistics.  The CV values 

of the capped assays within each zone are generally over two. QP Thomas concludes that 

further domaining of the copper and gold grades may be warranted.

Contact Plots 

QP Thomas plotted gold, silver and copper grades in distance bins from domain contacts. 

The plots were used to select boundary conditions during grade estimation.  A matrix of 

the boundary conditions between domains were tabulated, the contacts are classified as 

either Soft (little change in grade across contact), Firm (gradational change in grade) or 

Hard (sharp change in grade).  The contact matrices for each gold and copper are 

summarized on Table 14.31.  It may be seen that the critical contacts are those between the

14.6.4 Composites 

To normalize the weight of influence of each sample, the assay intervals were regularized 

by compositing the drillhole data into 4.0 m lengths using the mineralization zone domain 

boundaries to break the composites.  The original samples are mostly 3.0 m in length; a 

composite length of 4.0 m was chosen to represent half the bench height of an 8.0 m high 

selective mining unit.  The 4.0 m composites were back-tagged using the mineralization 

zone solids.  Summary 4.0 m composite statistics are presented on Tables 14.32 (for gold), 

14.33 (for silver) and 14.34 (for copper).  QP Thomas notes that the length-weighted mean 

grades of 4.0 m length composites are very similar to those of the assays.  QP Thomas is, 

therefore, confident that the compositing process is working as intended.  The capped CV 

values are comparatively low in (the main mineralized) Domains 10 and 50.

14.6.5 Sub-Domaining 

Fault Sub-Domains 

The impact of the fault blocks on grade were examined by constructing swath plots of the 

gold and copper grades along the easting direction in Domains 10 and 50.  The swath plots 

are presented as Figures 14.19 (for Domain 10) and 14.20 (for Domain 50); the gold plots 

are to the left and the copper plots to the right.  It may be seen that the copper and gold 

grades drop significantly at an easting between 424,800E and 425,000E.  In Domain 10, 

the grades drop again between eastings of 424,300E and 424,500E, whereas the grades in 

Domain 50 increase.  QP Thomas selected sub-domains of Domains 10 and 50 to represent 

the changes in grade along strike.  The sub-domains are summarized on Figure 14.21.

interpolating a distance into blocks up to 36 m away from a block coded to Domain 50.  

The distance was used to code blocks.  Composites were back-tagged with the resulting 

block sub-domain codes.  

14.6.6 Variography 

Down-hole and directional correlograms for gold, silver and copper grades were 

constructed within the mineralized domains.  QP Thomas used a single spherical model 

and a nested exponential model and a nugget effect to fit the experimental correlograms.  

Tables 14.35 (for gold), 14.36 (for silver) and 14.37 (for copper) summarize the 

correlogram models.

14.6.7 Estimation/Interpolation Methods 

The block model consists of regular blocks (10 m along strike x 10 m across strike x 8 m 

vertically).  The block size was chosen such that geological contacts are reasonably well 

reflected, support the anticipated tonnage throughput rate and selectivity of the mining

scenarios in the PEA.  Ordinary kriging grade estimation used a composite and block 

matching scheme based on the domain codes.  The fault sub-domains were used as hard 

boundaries, only composites coded as falling within the higher-grade sub-domains were 

used to estimate blocks falling within the higher-grade sub-domains.  A firm boundary for 

blocks falling within Domain 10 was modelled by sharing composites from both Domains 

10 and 50 within 36 m of the contact.  Tables 14.38 (for Pass1), 14.39 (for Pass 2) and

14.6.8 Density Assignment 

There is little variability in SG values so average values were assigned to blocks by domain.  

There is an insufficient number of SG samples in overburden and the mean SG of 2.74 

g/cm3 is considered unrealistic, so QP Thomas used an average of 1.8 g/cm3 for this 

domain.  The SG values have been used directly as the dry bulk density to report the 

tonnage estimates of the mineral resource. 

A total of 1,316 SG determinations have been performed on drillcore samples collected 

from material within the Donnelly Deposit mineralized zones (Table 14.41, not including 

the 55 check measurements noted in Section 12.4).  The determinations were performed at 

site using unsealed immersion technique to measure the weight of each sample in air and 

in water.

It is established in Section 12.4 that the Company selected 55 samples from CGH drillcore 

using, wherever possible, the same core pieces as those originally measured by CGH.  

Analysis of the results show that they agree favorably with CGH's field determined values, 

insofar as the laboratory measurements average only 1.1% lower than CGH's field 

measurements.  In the opinion of QP Thomas, the slight difference does not materially 

affect the tonnage estimates of the Mineral Resource estimate for the Donnelly Deposit. 

14.6.9 Block Model Validation 

The Donnelly Deposit block model was validated to ensure appropriate honouring of the 

input data.  NN grade models were created from 8 m composites to validate the OK grade 

models. 

Visual Inspection 

A visual inspection of block grade versus composited data in section and plan view was 

conducted.  The visual inspection of block grade versus composited data showed a good 

reproduction of the data by the model.  Figure 14.22 is an east-west oriented cross-section 

through the Donnelly Deposit.

Metal Removed By Capping 

The impact of capping was evaluated by estimating uncapped and capped grade models.  

The amounts of metal removed by capping in the models are in general consistent with the 

amounts removed from the NN models.  The amounts of metal removed are summarized 

on Table 14.42.

 Global Bias Checks 

A comparison between the OK and NN estimates was completed on classified blocks to 

check for global bias in the grade estimates.  Differences were generally within acceptable 

levels (<5% for the Indicated category and <10% for the Inferred category).  Tables 14.43 

(for Indicated blocks) and 14.44 (for Inferred blocks) summarize the statistics.

Local Bias Checks 

A check for local bias was carried out by plotting the average gold and copper grades of 

composites, NN and OK models in swaths oriented along the model northings, eastings 

and elevations.  QP Thomas reviewed the swath plots and found only minor discrepancies 

between the NN and OK model grades.   In areas where there is significant extrapolation 

beyond the drillholes, the swath plots indicate less agreement for all variables. 

Figure 14.23 is the gold swath plot; the copper swath plot is presented as Figure 14.24.  

The upper swath plots show grades, the lower swath plots show number of blocks or 

composites.  The RED lines represent OK model, the BLUE lines represent the NN model 

and the BLACK lines represent composites. 

Grade Smoothing/Model Selectivity Checks 

A check on grade smoothing (model selectivity) was completed for potential openpit 

mining using a global change-of-support correction (a Hermite Polynomial or "Herco") to 

the NN model.  The check was completed for gold and copper in the mineralized domains.  

The results show that the amount of smoothing is acceptable for a block size of 10 m x 10 

m x 8 m.  Figure 14.25 (for gold) and 14.26 (for copper) detail grade-tonnage curves 

comparison of the OK model and the Herco model.

14.6.10 Classification of Mineral Resources 

QP Thomas reviewed the geological model, data quality, geological continuity, grade 

continuity and metallurgical characteristics for classification of Mineral Resources.  The 

mineralized zone wireframes are supported by drilling with a spacing of approximately 100 

m in some areas.  The continuity of the variograms suggests that grade continuity may be 

assumed over distances of more than 100 m; a drillhole spacing of 150 m was selected (by 

using a maximum distance to the closest hole of 125 m and a maximum distance to the 

second hole of 165 m).  A maximum distance of 125 m to the closest hole permits a 

reasonable local estimate of grades (as demonstrated by model validation). 

An analysis of confidence limits was carried out using quarterly panels of production for a 

30,000 t/day openpit operation.  The accuracy of grade estimates was then scaled to annual 

production.  An accuracy of 15% or better at a 90% confidence limit on annual production 

was used as the criteria to select a drillhole spacing for classifying Indicated Mineral 

Resources.  The results (see Figure 14.27) show that a drillhole spacing of 75 m (along the 

easting) x 75 m (along the northing) is sufficient. 

Figure 14.27 Drillhole Spacing Study Results, Donnelly Deposit, Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

 

Blocks were classified into the Indicated category using the following criteria: 

 a maximum distance to the closest hole of 58 m; 

 a maximum distance to the second closest hole of 82.5 m; and 

 a maximum average distance from two holes of 58 m (approximately half the diagonal 
distance within a 75 m x 75 m grid with a 10% contingency).

The distance-based classification model was smoothed to remove isolated Indicated and 

Inferred category blocks.  The algorithm used for smoothing minimizes the change in 

relative proportions of blocks in each category.  Figure 14.28 is a north-south cross-section 

view of the resulting resource classification.

14.6.11 Comparison with the Previous (2016) Mineral Resource Estimate 

The previous Mineral Resource reported by the Company for the Donnelly Deposit is 

detailed in the April 2016 Technical Report referenced in Section 2.5.  Table 14.45 (for 

Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources) and Table 14.46 (for Inferred Mineral 

Resources) compare the tonnes, grade and metal content of the models.  The results of the 

comparison between Measured and Indicated blocks shows that the tonnage has increased 

by approximately 14% and the grades have increased by between approximately 7% and 

8%, for an 0.2% Cu minimum grade cut-off.  The comparison of the Inferred blocks shows 

that the tonnage has decreased by approximately 0.2% while the grades have increased by 

approximately 8%.  Silver grades were not estimated within the scope of the 2016 Mineral 

Resource estimate 

The change in the tonnages and grades observed in the 2017 model compared with the 

previous 2016 model is the result of the Company's 2016 drilling program (2,872 m in 

eight holes) and the use of a lithological domain model (for the 2017 update) to constrain 

grade estimation, compared with the single grade shell used to constrain grade estimation 

in 2016.

14.7 Reasonable Prospects of Economic Extraction 

The classified blocks for both the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit models were assessed for 

reasonable prospects of economic extraction by applying preliminary economics for potential 

openpit mining.  Metallurgical testwork has been completed for the mineralization (see Section 

13).  Operating costs, metal prices, metallurgical recovery and a 45° slope angle were used to 

optimize a pit shell using a Lerchs-Grossman algorithm.

The assessment does not represent an economic analysis of the deposit, but was used to determine 

reasonable assumptions to report the Mineral Resource.  The assumed long-term gold, silver and 

copper prices were US$1,250/oz Au, US$17.75/oz Ag and US$2.75/lb Cu, which are the Base 

Case values stated in Section 19.  The assumed metallurgical recovery rates were 73% for gold, 

50% for silver and 90% for copper, which are those stated in Section 13 for 100% Donnelly feed.  

The estimated on-site operating costs were those stated in Section 20. 

14.8 Minimum Grade Cut-Offs 

A minimum grade cut-off was determined for Central Zone mineralization using an all-in unit cost 

for mining mineralized material of US$7.07/t, factored by strip ratio to US$4.66/t of ROM 

material, a unit process cost (flotation) of US$4.55/t and a factored, all-in unit on-site G&A cost 

of US$0.46/t.  On this basis and using the same metal prices and metallurgical recovery rates stated 

above, a gold equivalent cut-off grade of 0.417 g/t Au was calculated.  A gold equivalent cut-off 

grade of 0.40 g/t AuEq was therefore selected for reporting the Mineral Resources, assuming an 

openpit mining method. 

A minimum grade cut-off was determined for Donnelly Deposit mineralization using an all-in unit, 

long-term cost for mining mineralized material of US$4.36/t, factored by strip ratio to US$2.35/t 

ROM material, a long-term unit process cost (flotation) of US$4.13/t and an all-in, unit on-site 

G&A cost of US$1.34/t.  On this basis and using the same metal prices and metallurgical recovery 

rates stated above, a copper equivalent cut-off grade of 0.145% Cu was calculated. An 0.15% 

CuEq cut-off grade was therefore selected for reporting the Mineral Resources, assuming an 

openpit mining method. 

14.9 Factors that Might Influence the Mineral Resource Estimates 

Areas of uncertainty that may materially impact the Mineral Resource estimate include: 

• the applied, long-term commodity price and exchange rate assumptions; 

• the operating cost assumptions; 

• the applied metallurgical recovery rates and any changes that might result from additional 
metallurgical testwork; 

• changes to the tonnage and grade estimates as a result of new assay and bulk density 
information; 

• future tonnage and grade estimates may vary significantly as more drilling is completed;  

• permitting of mining operations; and 

• any changes to the slope angle of the pit walls as a result of geotechnical information would 
affect the pit shell used to constrain the Mineral Resources. 

14.10 Qualified Person's Opinion 

QP Thomas is of the opinion that the Mineral Resources for the Project, which have been estimated 

using core drilling, have been performed to industry practices and conform to the requirements of 

CIM Definition Standards (2014).  The Mineral Resource estimation is well-constrained by three-

dimensional wireframes representing geologically realistic volumes of mineralization.  

Exploratory data analysis conducted on assays and composites shows that the wireframes are 

suitable domains for mineral resource estimation.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

As a result of validation of the Mineral Resource block models, QP Thomas concludes that: 

 visual inspection of block grade versus composited data shows a good reproduction of the data 
by the model; 

 checks for global bias in the grade estimates show differences generally within acceptable 
levels (<5% for Indicated and <10% for Inferred - domains with larger differences between the 

NN model and OK model have a low number of composites); 

 checks for local bias (swath plots) indicate good agreement for all variables, except in areas 
where there is significant extrapolation beyond the drillholes;  

 the impact of capping by estimating uncapped and capped grade models was evaluated - 
generally the amounts of metal removed by capping in the models are consistent with the 

amounts calculated during the grade capping study on the assays.   

The Mineral Resource were classified using distances which permit a reasonable assumption of 

geological and grade continuity.  Comparisons with the previous (2016) Mineral Resource 

estimates in the areas of infill drilling support the classification of Indicated Mineral Resources.  

Confidence limits analyses from a drillhole spacing studies (for both Central Zone and Donnelly 

Deposit) and conditional simulation of grades (at Central Zone) both support classification of 

Indicated Mineral Resources.  The Mineral Resources are constrained and reported using economic 

and technical criteria such that the Mineral Resources have reasonable prospects of economic 

extraction.   

QP Thomas recommends that the Company complete additional drilling on the Project.  Infill 

drilling in both the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit may result in upgrades in the Mineral 

Resource category from Inferred to the higher confidence Measured and Indicated categories. 

Furthermore, both deposits are open along strike and down-dip, and additional drilling is required 

to fully assess their potential. 

The Company should also carefully evaluate and identify areas of both deposits with higher risk 

(e.g. either areas with significantly higher grades than the average grade of the deposit or areas 

with more discontinuous grades) and consider strategically located holes in those areas to mitigate 

the risks.  Additional drilling would mitigate the risk by increasing local confidence in the 

estimated tonnage and grade above cut-off.  Consideration should also be given to drilling in those 

areas that rely on pre-1993 drillholes at Central Zone and pre-2004 drillholes on the Donnelly 

Deposit (see Section 11.7 for details).

16 MINING METHODS 

The Principal Author and QP Scott Britton, C. Eng. (the "Co-Authors") are jointly responsible for 

this section of this Technical Report. 

16.1 Mining Method Selection 

Surface and underground methods were considered for exploiting the Central Zone and Donnelly 

Deposit, including conventional truck and shovel openpit mining, longhole stoping, sub-level 

caving and block caving.  Conventional truck and shovel openpit mining was selected because, 

overall, it represents the least risk, most sustainable option from both economic and environmental 

perspectives.  The following discussions apply. 

At first glance, topographic constraints, especially as regards Central Zone, favour the use of an 

underground mining method.  However, preliminary analysis, using the block model used to 

compile the 2016 Mineral Resource estimate detailed in the May 2016 Technical Report, showed 

that while the target mineralization persists in a geological sense, its average grades are in general 

too low to support even a modest longhole stoping operation.  High-/higher-grade areas could be 

targeted for selective extraction, through the application of a suitably high grade cut-off, but 

analysis shows that grade continuity quickly breaks down at grade cut-offs higher than 

approximately 0.5 g/t AuEq.  This directly and inevitably results in: 

 ever-smaller blocks of economically viable material, hence a quickly shrinking Mineral 
Resource base; and 

 ever-worsening ratios of ROM tonnage production to development metres; hence 

 ever-increasing operating costs that reach unsustainable levels at the estimated grade cut-off 
required to justify a longhole stoping operation (assessed by the Co-Authors to be in the 2.0 

g/t to 3.0 g/t AuEq range for a stand-alone underground operation). 

In the Co-Authors' opinion, there is no readily identifiable reason to suppose that the same findings 

would not be reached if the block model, used to compile the 2017 Mineral Resource estimate 

detailed and described in Section 14, was employed: 

 the purpose of the drilling program completed by the Company in 2016 (i.e. subsequent to the 
2016 Mineral Resource estimate for the Central Zone, stated in the May 2016 Technical 

Report) was to elevate the mineralization to the west of the high-grade gold zone to at least the 

Inferred category of Mineral Resources (it was previously defined as waste) and to infill gaps 

in historic drilling, thereby to increase confidence in Mineral Resources and to increase the 

quantity of Inferred Mineral Resources; 

 comparison of the 2016 and 2017 Mineral Resource estimates (see Section 14.5) shows that – 

o the main difference is in the amount of tonnes remained approximately the same in the 
Inferred category but increased nearly threefold to 31.2 Mt in the Indicated category, 

whereas 

o the average grades (for an 0.4 g/t AuEq cut-off) in the Indicated category remained more-
or-less the same (with the notable exception of silver).

The constraints outlined are even more significant as regards longhole stoping in the Donnelly 

Deposit, due mainly to the comparatively modest gold grades compared with the Central Zone.  

The constraints outlined do not, however, preclude the use of a longhole stoping method to 

selectively extract high-grade material that could not be economically exploited by openpit mining 

on either the Central Zone or Donnelly Deposit.  Access could be either from extensions to the 

planned muck handling infrastructure described below (adits) or from the bottom of the planned 

pits.  In the opinion of the Co-Authors, this potential opportunity should be assessed at the pre-

feasibility stage of project development. 

The constraints outlined do not necessarily apply if a caving method is used.  For example, 

preliminary analysis showed that in general, Central Zone rockmass characteristics are amenable 

to block caving in particular, not least due to the presence of faults (suggesting good bulk caving 

characteristics) and the extensively (and weakly) veined nature of the mineralized zones 

(suggesting good comminution characteristics).  However, the expected amounts of clay in a 

relative tension structure that cuts across Central Zone would act against drawpoint production 

efficiency, as would the assessed tendency for large blocks to be generated by block caving in the 

Donnelly Deposit (by virtue of its comparatively higher RQD values and poor [assessed] 

comminution characteristics).  These issues to a large extent fall away if a sub-level caving method 

was employed. 

Notwithstanding the above, both caving methods were ultimately discounted in favour of openpit 

mining, because: 

 the geometries of the target mineralization would require above average amounts of access 
development, which would impinge on project economics if a sub-level caving method was 

employed; 

 the footprint to vertical height ratios of the target mineralization are moderate at best, with the 
result that elevated dilution rates could reasonably be expected, along with moderate resource 

utilizations and a substantial pre-production capital requirement if a block caving method was 

employed; and, perhaps most importantly, 

 the use of a caving method would inevitably incur bulk rockmass caving that would cause 
potentially large surface subsidence troughs that, in the case of the Central Zone, could 

ultimately encompass the local mountain slope and ridge.  

16.2 Planning and Design Criteria 

16.2.1 Practical, Physical and Operational Constraints 

It is established in Section 2 that a key objective of the PEA is to engineer solutions that 

encompass safety considerations as well as practical, physical and operational constraints, 

thereby to ensure practicably achievable and sustainable outcomes.  For purposes of mine 

planning, design and production scheduling, this study objective was achieved through 

consideration of: 

 the topographic constraints of mining on the side of a minor mountain at Spectrum Pit 
and on Klastline Plateau in the case of the Donnelly Pit, which –

o limit the size of equipment that can be used in Spectrum Pit, hence the production 
rate that can sustainably be achieved (a similar constraint does not apply at the 

Donnelly Pit that is amenable to bulk production mining), and 

o require the use of raisebore and adit access muck handling systems at both 
Spectrum Pit and Donnelly Pit; and 

 the geohazard and geotechnical constraints described in the following sections that 
limit the ultimate size of Spectrum Pit, at least within the scope of the PEA; and 

 the tonnage ramp-up profile for ROM plant feed that is described in Section 17. 

It should be emphasized that by definition, the purpose of a preliminary economic 

assessment is to demonstrate that the economics of a mining project are sufficiently robust 

(or not) to advance the project to the pre-feasibility stage (or not).  Upside potential exists 

as regards mine planning, design and production scheduling, through the undertaking of 

production optimization and trade-off studies that cannot and did not form part of the PEA.  

The recommended studies are described in the following sections and they are summarized 

in Section 26.  In the opinion of the Co-Authors, the recommended studies could result in 

an increase to the production rate for Spectrum Pit in particular, as well as an extension to 

planned life-of-mine. 

16.2.2 Production Scheduling 

Phased production scheduling was adopted to match the overall approach applied for 

purposes of the PEA (see Section 2.3): preliminary analyses of potential project 

development options identified the benefits of a combined operation designed to limit 

operational, technical and capital risks by: 

 limiting early mine production to achievable and sustainable levels; 

 scheduling production from the two deposits to optimize early cashflows; and 

 phasing capital expenditures by employing either a modular or progressive approach 
(as appropriate) to the development of plant throughput capacities, production fleet size 

and camp capacity in particular. 

The alternatives – the development and construction of separate operations or the 

development of openpit mines with production capabilities sufficient to fill an ultimate 

capacity plant early in the project life – were considered inappropriate.  Within the scope 

of mine planning, design and scheduling, the principal reasons include: 

 the much increased personnel, infrastructure, support facilities and equipment 
requirements (hence costs) that two separate operations would require, despite their 

close proximity; and 

 the technical and operational risks inherent to any new, start-up operation (a wealth of 
global mining experience shows that lengthy lead times are invariably required before 

such risks can be overcome and optimal results can routinely and sustainably be 

achieved, especially with greenfield projects).

16.3 Planning and Design Considerations 

16.3.1 Environmental 

It is stated in Section 4 that, to the extent possible planning and design should encompass 

the Tahltan Nation's requirements that, to the best knowledge and understanding of the Co-

Authors, includes keeping the project within one watershed, unless existing infrastructure 

extends into or from a different watershed (see also Section 18.1).  In common with the 

majority of the planned infrastructure, the planned pits are both within the Stikine River 

drainage system identified in Section 5.8.  However, an incised creek exists immediately 

to the east of the planned Donnelly Pit.  It flows southwest and then south to eventually 

drain east, off the Klastline Plateau, to thereby join the Iskut River drainage system.  Pit 

optimization for purposes of Mineral Resource estimation showed that the eastern end of 

Donnelly Pit could, in theory, extend into the creek outlined.  For purposes of ultimate pit 

design, the eastern end of Donnelly Pit was limited to/constrained at a point that ensured 

that the single watershed planning requirement was adhered to and that the creek's integrity 

was not compromised. 

16.3.2 Physical Constraints 

Within the scope of the PEA, access to Spectrum Pit is limited to a point mid-pit, which 

limits the size of the pit that could be safely be realized (see below and Section 18.9 for 

details of the pit access road).  A potential for larger/higher overall tonnage pit exists, but 

this was not considered within the scope of PEA because it requires access to the top of the 

local mountain from where waste stripping would take place to thereby enable a larger 

tonnage pit to be mined. 

Access to the local mountain top is problematic: it includes a section along a steep and 

deep ravine, as well as sections along known avalanche channels and areas of potentially 

unstable scree identified within the scope of the geohazards study described below (Sub-

Section 16.3.3).  These risks require examination and mitigation before an access road to 

the local mountain top could realistically and confidently be planned. 

It is for the reasons outlined that the potentially significant benefit of sustained production 

from an enlarged Spectrum Pit was not included within the scope of the PEA.  Production 

from Spectrum Pit is instead limited to what can practicably, safely and sustainably be 

realized by means of mid-pit access only, as required by virtue of the project planning 

criteria stated above.  The studies required to enable low risk, sustainable enlargements to 

Spectrum Pit are recommended for completion at the feasibility stage of project 

development. 

16.3.3 Geohazards 

Both locally and regionally, geohazards are linked primarily to landslides and to 

avalanches.  Landslide hazards are extensive throughout the region and are attributed to 

several factors, including: the presence of unstable surficial soils and weak bedrock; 

repeated glaciation events resulting in over-steepened valley sidewalls; the loss of slope 

buttress support following glacial recession; abundance of veneers that are shallow to 

bedrock; and the high precipitation environment (Tetra Tech, 2016).

The types of geohazards outlined are not primary sources of operational risk at the planned 

Donnelly Pit, due mainly to the generally flat and featureless local topography of Klastline 

Plateau.  However, Central Zone is situated on a mountain slope that is occasionally subject 

to local landslides, debris flows and minor avalanches (see also Section 5.4).  It is because 

of the types of hazards outlined that the Company, in June 2015, commissioned J. W. 

Schwab, P. Geo, Eng. L. to undertake a terrain stability hazard (geohazard) overview 

assessment of the general area of Central Zone.  The objective was to determine the safety 

of camps and work sites for the Company's exploration programs (Schwab, 2015).  The 

assessment involved a desk-top review of air photographs, computer analysis of slope 

stability (slope stability index mapping), a field visit and interpretive hazard identification 

of avalanche paths.   

A number of terrain stability hazards were observed and reported, including debris flow 

channels, rockslides, slump-slides and avalanche channels.  Terrain features suggest that 

the majority of these mass-wasting events occurred in the distant past.  However, 

avalanches are a persistent hazard in winter and slope stability can be compromised during 

intense rainfall events. 

Figure 16.1 is a VulcanTM snapshot of the mountainside containing Central Zone, on which 

is identified the surface ares of the final pushback for the planned Spectrum Pit.  It may be 

seen that a significant scree slide and avalanche channel exists to the immediate south of 

the planned pit.  The northern edge of the channel marks the limit of the Spectrum Pit 

planned for purposes of the PEA.  Without this constraint, the planned pit could be larger, 

but not significantly so (because of access limitations assumed within the scope of the PEA, 

hence the inability to mine waste, downwards from the basalt cap, which is required before 

a substantially larger pit could be developed).

It should be emphasized that Schwab's terrain assessment was limited to an evaluation of 

observed terrain features in the Spectrum claims block only, along with considerations of 

bedrock and surficial materials, landslides, terrain associated with avalanches, slope 

stability site indicators, sub-surface materials uncovered in soil pits dug by hand shovel 

and surficial materials observed in road cuts and in natural exposures.  A detailed 

investigation of sub-surface geological conditions was not undertaken, nor was a formal 

risk assessment for avalanches (Schwab, 2015).  Additional geohazard assessments are, 

therefore, recommended for the Project Area, inclusive of both the pit areas and the planned 

infrastructure locations described in Section 18. 

16.3.4 Geology 

It is established in Section 7.6 that the Central Zone geology includes a rotated slump block 

(or sackung) of broken, heavily weathered Stuhini Group strata that is generally barren but 

locally has a low-grade, gold only signature.  For purposes of domain modelling, the 

sackung area is termed Domain 2a, which lies towards the north end of the deposit and 

overlies porphyry Cu-Au mineralization of the Central Zone. 

Casing in several pre-2014 drillholes extended through the sackung such that its base is in 

places somewhat interpretive (see also Section 7.6).  In view of this, the western wall of 

the planned Spectrum Pit was limited to a position where only a small amount of Domain 

2a material was taken, with the remainder laid-back at an angle of 37° to ensure its stability.  

Without this constraint, the planned pit would be larger. 

It is recommended that, at the pre-feasibility stage of project development, the profile hence 

volume of Domain 2a material is more closely defined than is currently the case.  

Realistic/safely achievable Spectrum Pit production plans could then be realized within the 

scope of pit design re-evaluations incorporating considerations of the physical, geohazard, 

geological and geotechnical constraints identified herein. 

16.3.5 Geotechnical 

A preliminary geotechnical characterization of the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit 

rockmasses was carried out for purposes of the PEA.  The study included considerations 

of rockmass quality designation ("RQD"), weathering profiles, structures and discontinuity 

trends, as well as preliminary slope stability analyses.  

Rock Quality Designations 

It is established in Section 10.6 that, in the opinion of the Principal Author, the majority of 

the Central Zone rockmass between fault zone intervals may be described as having RQD 

values between approximately 45% and 65%, increasing to approximately 55% to 75% or 

even 80% in the case of the Donnelly Deposit.  Scrutiny of drillcore intervals shows the 

extensively veined nature of the Central Zone in particular; a qualitative assessment of core 

strength shows that Central Zone core tends to break readily at vein contacts (which, in the 

opinion of the Principal Author, is a significant contributor to the generally low to moderate 

RQD values reflected in the drillcore logging database).  In the Principal Author's opinion, 

the results of the qualitative drillcore assessment suggests that Central Zone material will 

fracture readily on blasting and that good comminution will occur on draw-down of 

material tipped into the muck handling system described in Section 16.5.  A similar 

conclusion was not arrived at following the Principal Author's analysis of Donnelly

Deposit core: it tends to be more competent and drillcore stick lengths of up to 0.7 m are 

not uncommon.  Large blocks of competent rock are, therefore, expected to be a fairly 

common feature of ROM material from Donnelly Pit. 

Weathering Profiles 

General surface weathering appears to be limited to a few metres below the surficial 

material (deeply weathered scree across the Spectrum Pit area and approximately 5 m of 

till across the Donnelly Pit area – see Section 16.9).  Analysis of the available data shows 

that, as may be expected, fault zones are uniformly logged as having 'Very Poor' to 'Poor' 

rockmass qualities (RQD <30%).  Especially low values are recorded within what are 

interpreted to be relative tension fault zones associated with regional-scale, strike-slip 

faulting. 

Structural Analysis 

Discontinuity sets were determined for purposes of preliminary slope analysis, based on 

considerations of regional and local faulting trends that appear either on the regional and 

Project Area geology plans identified in Section 7 or on the BCGS provincial structural 

map (available at http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/PublicationsCatalogue/ 

OpenFiles/2015/Pages/2015-2.aspx).  Topographic interpretation across the general 

Project Area was also used to identify persistent structural trends, as suggested by moderate 

to major drainages (rivers and significant creeks) and their associated lakes. 

Figure 16.2 summarizes the interpreted major structural trends in the general Project Area.  

Figure 16.3 summarizes the mapped and interpreted structures across the general area of 

Spectrum Pit and Figure 16.4 summarizes the interpreted structures across the general area 

of Donnelly Pit, inclusive of the structures identified within the scope of the Donnelly 

geology model described in Section 7.6.  In each case, the various structures are colour-

coded according to the structural/fault sets identified below (Fault Set A in RED, Fault Set 

B in BLUE and Fault Set C in GREEN).  It may be seen that persistent structural trends 

can be identified both on a regional and local scale.  The trends matched closely the 

discontinuity orientations identified by structural and discontinuity field mapping, as 

reported in Oliver and Walcott (2016). 

Modified strike-slip structural theory (Godden, 2005) was applied to the results from which 

the three structural sets summarized on Table 16.1 were identified, assuming an average 

conjugate angle for the dominant rock types of between 50° and 55° (based on a database 

of results for a wide variety of rock types, compiled and held by the Principal Author).  A 

minimum of three data sources was required before any particular fault direction was 

considered valid.  The only exception is F2 of Fault Set C, which has a similar trend to F2 

of Fault Set A and is, therefore, probably masked within the available dataset.  

Figures 16.5 through 16.7 are rose diagrams that summarize the structural orientations of 

the three strike-slip fault sets identified on Table 16.1.  The trends were compared with 

those separately defined by Company geologists when compiling the geological models 

described in Section 7.6.  Excellent repeatability between the two datasets was found.

It is for the reasons apparent from consideration of Figure 16.8 that the available database 

was split into six logical sub-groups to help better identify the minor to intermediate 

discountinuity sets.  The following sub-groups were analyzed: dips less than 45°; dips of 

between 45° and 59°, inclusive; dips of between 60° and 74°; dips greater than 74°; dips 

of between 45° and 74°, inclusive; and dips greater than 60°.  Figure 16.9 is a contoured 

pole plot for those structures with dips less than 45°.  It reflects a typical plot for flat-

dipping structures assoicated with strike slip faults, in that the discontinuities dip in all 

directions and mostly at 30° or less.  Figures 16.10 and 16.11 are contoured pole plots on 

which the major identified planes are defined, for the 45° to 74° and +60° sub-sets of 

discontinuity data, respectively.

It may be seen from the results presented as Figures 16.10 and 16.11 that (as is often the 

case) selective analysis of logical sub-sets results in the clearer identification of minor to 

intermediate structural sets.  However, a number of sets remain weakly defined, which 

reflects the limited database (545 data points) available for analysis.  As such, the structural 

analysis presented here should be considered preliminary and provisional, hence subject to 

change.  Additional data is required before a robust structural analysis can be carried out, 

inclusive of field determinations of outcrop discontinuities across a wide area (i.e. across 

and, to the extent possible, outside the Project Area).  A wide-ranging mapping exercise is 

possible due to the persistence of the results of the baseline structural analysis described 

above: the same structural trends were found to repeat over a large area. 

Kinematic Analysis 

Dips (version 7.0) was used to assess the stability of the walls of the planned pits, along 

with an average friction angle for the discontinuities of 30°.  In the opinion of the Principal 

Author, the assumed average friction angle represents a reasonable worst case, insofar as 

thick discontinuity infillings were not identified in drillcore and discontinuity surfaces are 

slightly non-planar to planar-undulating, with the result that the average bulk insitu friction 

angle will exceed 30° in most cases. 

Planar, wedge and sliding instability potential was assessed for a range of slope angles 

between 40° and 60° and slope dip directions at 45° increments from 000°.  No potential 

for planar sliding was found, but a minor risk of wedge failures was found at all slope 

orientations: values of between 0.48% and 3.3% were found for an average slope angle of 

45°, rising to between 1.43% and 5.24% for an average slope angle of 50°.  As might be

expected for the predominantly vertical to subvertical discontinuity sets found by means of 

analysis, toppling failure yielded the highest risk, with values varying between 5.24% and 

13.33% for direct toppling and between 12.38% and 22.86% for indirect toppling.  The 

highest risk of toppling instability occurred at the east and west ends of the planned pits, 

due to the predominance of north-south (or near north-south) faulting trends. 

Conclusions 

It should be emphasized that the results of the geotechnical analyses described above are 

preliminary and provisional, hence subject to change.  Additional data is required before 

slope configurations can confidently be designed.  As a minimum, this data should include: 

 structural mapping and three-dimensional structural modelling to separately identify 
the locations and orientations of faults, hence the principal discontinuity trends, at the 

two deposits of interest; 

 three-dimensional modelling of weathering/oxidation profiles to identify the locations 
and continuities of weathered zones below the surface oxidation zone at the two 

deposits of interest; 

 discontinuity mapping over a large area as practicably possible to thereby develop a 
robust database of orientated discontinuity data; 

 laboratory testing of the dominant rock types to identify their average strengths and the 
average shear strengths of the dominant discontinuity types; and 

 hydrogeological testing to assess groundwater conditions and pit inflow rates. 

Notwithstanding the above and in the opinion of the Principal Author, there is no readily 

identifiable reason to suggest that an overall average slope angle of 45° could not safely 

and sustainably be achieved in Spectrum Pit, rising to 50° in Donnelly Pit.  Good toppling 

instability control and trim blasting will, however, be pre-requisites of success. 

16.4 Production Equipment 

The mining equipment has been sized to achieve the production targets with reference to assumed 

material haulage routes.  Truck and shovel sizes in particular were matched, based on the Co-

Author's knowledge and experience, and bench-marked to information contained in InfoMine's 

2016 CostMine models.  To achieve the planned 5,000 tpd output from Spectrum Pit, the 

equipment summarized on Table 16.2 was assumed for purposes of the PEA.  Table 16.3 

summarizes the production and mine support equipment fleets assumed for Stage 1 (10,000 tpd) 

production at Donnelly Pit.  Table 16.4 summarizes the production and mine support equipment 

fleets assumed for Stage 2 (15,000 tpd) and Stage 3 (30,000 tpd) production at Donnelly Pit.

16.5 Pit Infrastructure – Spectrum Pit 

It is earlier established that for purposes of the PEA, access to the Spectrum Pit area is limited to 

a mid-pit point.  A 6.0 m wide access road with a maximum gradient of 10% is planned (see also 

Section 18.9), along which passing cut-outs will be excavated (see Figure 16.12).  Topographic 

constraints and the resultant truck cycling times preclude the use of the access road for muck 

hauling.  ROM material from the Spectrum Pit will instead be tipped directly onto a grizzley with 

an associated rock breaker to reduce over-size blocks (for the reasons earlier outlined, few such 

blocks are anticipated).  Material tipped on the grizzley will report directly to a raise bored, gravity 

fed muck pass system that reports to a loading box via a dog-leg to reduce the speed of muck

reporting to the box front.  The loading facility is located underground, at the back of a suitably 

dimensioned drift; B-Train trucks will be loaded at the box front, from where they will haul the 

muck to a laydown area at the MIA (see also Section 18.8). 

Figure 16.12 A Perspective View of the Preliminary and Provisional Pit Infrastructure, 

Spectrum Pit, Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

 

The muck handling system outlined yields much reduced truck cycle times, hence a reduced truck 

fleet requirement, as the haul trucks will be operated within the confines of the pit area only – 

unless they require maintenance at either the SIA facility or MIA maintenance facility in extreme 

cases.  The system outlined also represents a project risk, insofar as planning and design for the 

muck pass system is at a preliminary and provisional stage only, hence subject to change.  In this 

regard, it is recommended that the muck pass system is closely analyzed and engineered at the pre-

feasibility stage of project development.  Alternative muck handling systems should also be 

considered, including belt systems and other methods, the former to preclude the use of trucks for 

hauling muck to the MIA.  These and related studies should form part of a larger series of trade-

off studies looking at optimizing the production rate from Spectrum Pit, as well as the ultimate 

size of Spectrum Pit, the latter for the reasons earlier described. 

16.6 Pit Infrastructure – Donnelly Pit 

A similar muck handling system to the preliminary and provisional system described above for 

Spectrum Pit has also been adopted for Donnelly Pit (see Figure 16.13), except a 15 m wide pit 

access road is planned, along with a primary crusher located at the base of the raise bore muck 

pass.  Crushed material reports to a loading pan and then a belt for conveyance to the coarse 

stockpile described in Section 17.3.   As described in Section 18.9, it is anticipated that the access 

road could be used as a back-up for truck hauling muck to the MIA, in the event that the primary 

crusher goes down.

16.7 Pre-Strip Requirements 

One year of pre-production pre-stripping has been assumed at both pits.  At Spectrum Pit, pre-

stripping requirements total an estimated 0.9 Mt of deeply weathered scree material that overlies 

the first pushback.  It is assumed for purposes of the PEA that this material is removed and used 

to build the waste retention dams described in Section 20.4.  At Donnelly Pit, it has been estimated 

that the removal of approximately 2.1 Mt of till will enable sustained ROM production at a steady 

strip ratio for Years 1 through 5.  The waste material will be used to form berms around the final 

pit area, to preclude potentially adverse animal and human interactions, as described in Section 

4.9. 

16.8 Cut-Off Grades 

The minimum grade cut-offs for the Mineral Resource estimates are 0.40 g/t AuEq and 0.15% 

CuEq for Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit, respectively.  To optimize the average grade of the 

notionally mined materials, a variable grade cut-off approach was adopted.  The resultant average 

grade cut-offs are 0.435 g/t AuEq for Spectrum Pit and 0.204% CuEq for Donnelly Pit.  In addition, 

a marginal grade cut-off of 0.105% CuEq has been applied applied to identify material for 

stockpiling and ultimately processing at the end of life of Donnelly Pit. 

It is emphasized that the method employed for classifying material mined as ROM muck and waste 

should not be confused with the method for establishing the limits of mining.  If a block of material 

falls inside the optimized mining limits then the question is not whether to mine the block but 

whether to process the material.  The PEA study is based on the assumption that a block of material 

should be processed if the income derived from the sale of product covers at least the cost of 

haulage from the pit exit (or stockpile reclaim), processing and G&A.  In other words, cut-off 

grades are calculated on a break-even basis and the approach assumes the cost of mining material 

out of the pit to the waste dump is a sunk cost as it is intrinsic to the mining process, regardless of 

whether the material is ROM muck or waste.

Minimum grade cut-offs were determined using the metal prices, metallurgical recovery rates and 

operating costs stated elsewhere in this Technical Report, applied to the following equation (which 

is the same as that stated in Section 14 for determination of cut-off grades for the Mineral Resource 

estimates that are the subject of this Technical Report). 

For precious metal grade cut-offs: 

 Cut-Off = ([(Mm - Mw) + (Po - Pw) + (Oo - Ow)] / {[r · (V – R)] · (1 – Gr)}) · 31.1035 

For base metal cut-offs: 

Cut-Off = {([(Mm - Mw) + (Po - Pw) + (Oo - Ow)] / {[r · (V – R)] · (1 – Gr)}) / 2,204.6} · 100 

 
where: 

Mm = the all-in unit cost of mining and delivering one ton of material to the primary crusher 

Mw = the unit cost of mining, transporting and dumping one ton of waste on the waste dump 

Po = the unit cost of processing one ton of material (from primary crushing to production of a final, 

  saleable product, inclusive of supervision and labour costs, consumables) 

Pw = the unit cost of processing one ton of waste (inclusive of labour costs and consumables associated 

  with avoiding potential water contamination and/or acid generation, as well as to satisfy any other  

  applicable regulatory and environmental requirements) 

Oo = the cost of on-site G&A 

Ow = the unit cost of the additional on-site G&A associated with processing one ton of waste 

r = recovery, or % of valuable product recovered on processing the mined material to a final saleable 

  product 

V = the value of one unit of the final saleable product 

R = smelting, refining, transportation and other costs incurred per unit of final saleable product 

Gr = payable NSR royalty (percent) 

16.9 Grade Equivalence 

Grade equivalences were determined using the metal prices, metallurgical recovery rates, 

operating costs and smelter terms stated elsewhere in this Technical Report, applied to the 

following equation (which is the same as that stated in Section 14 for determination of cut-off 

grades for the Mineral Resource estimates that are the subject of this Technical Report). 

AuEq = Au grade + [(Ag grade · (Ag revenue / Au revenue)] + [Cu grade · (Cu revenue / Au revenue)] 

CuEq = (Cu grade + [(Au grade · (Au revenue / Cu revenue)] + [Ag grade · (Ag revenue / Cu revenue)] 

where: 

Au revenue = (1 / 31.1035) · Au plant recovery · Au smelter recovery · Au refinery recovery · unit Au price 

Ag revenue = (1 / 31.1035) · Ag plant recovery · Ag smelter recovery · Ag refinery recovery · unit Ag price 

Cu revenue = 2,204.62 · 0.01 · Cu plant recovery · Cu smelter recovery · Cu refinery recovery · unit Cu price

16.10 Ultimate Pit Designs 

The main objective of the pit design process was to transform the pit shells obtained from Lerchs-

Grossman ("LG") optimizations into practical pits, with the inclusion of ramps, bench and berm 

configurations by taking all the required inputs into account.  The results form part of the critical 

inputs required for production scheduling.  Table 16.5 summarizes the key inputs, defined as 

described in Section 16.4 and in the following sub-sections.  Figure 16.14 is a VulcanTM plan view 

snapshot of the ultimate Spectrum Pit.  Figure 16.15 is a VulcanTM plan view snapshot of the 

ultimate Donnelly Pit. 

Table 16.5 A Summary of Pit Design parameters for Spectrum Pit and 

Donnelly Pit, Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

 

 

 

The Maptek VulcanTM pit optimization outputs, the design criteria, the geohazards and 

geotechnical constraints were used as input parameters to design the practical final pits.  Pushbacks 

were based on the interim selected pit shells and designed using the recommended geotechnical 

parameters and pit design criteria derived from the equipment strategy as well as current best 

practices.  All pit designs were created using the Maptek VulcanTM mining software. 

Two important considerations for the pit designs were the mining pushback strategy and the 

positioning of the access ramps.  The optimization exercise indicated that improved value can be 

generated through optimum extraction sequences for the planned pits.  The starting point of an 

optimum scheduling sequence is an informed decision regarding pushbacks.  Several interim pit 

shells, as well as the ultimate pit limit, were used as a basis for the practical pit and pushback 

designs.  

The pit optimization exercise resulted in a series of pit shells with decreasing economic value, the 

combination of which provide an optimum extraction sequence that ensures that grade to the mill 

is maximized in the early years and waste stripping is deferred as far as possible into the future.  

The selected shells provided some guidance towards the location of interim stage designs.

16.10.1 Bench Heights 

The decision regarding the bench heights takes into account the geometry of the target 

zones, the planned mining rates and the various equipment types and sizes.  With this in 

mind, it is assumed for purposes of the PEA that drilling and blasting in Spectrum Pit will 

be carried out in 6.0 m benches and mined selectively either in a single 6 m bench or split 

into smaller flitches where necessary, depending on local grade control issues.  Spectrum 

bulk waste benches are designed to be blasted and loaded in 6 m lifts.  At Donnelly, larger 

mining equipment is required to achieve the project production targets.  As a result, it is 

assumed that drilling and blasting ROM material and selective waste at Donnelly will be 

performed using 8 m benches and mined selectively either in a single 8 m bench or split 

into smaller flitches, depending on grade control issues.  Donnelly bulk waste benches have 

been designed to be blasted and loaded in 16 m lifts, where possible.

16.10.2 Pit Haul Roads 

The haul road design parameters were established taking into consideration the type and 

size of material hauling equipment that will be used during the operation.  For the Spectrum 

Pit, the dimensions of the haul road are based on 40 t articulated dump trucks using global 

standards of good practice (see Section 16.8).  At Donnelly Pit, the dimensions of the haul 

road are based on typical 100 t rigid frame trucks that are planned for use during Stage 3 

of the mine life (production at 30,000 tpd). 

Many of the best practice guidelines specify that to determine the effective operating width 

of the haul road and to incorporate the road infrastructure such as the safety berm and 

drainage channel, the vehicle operating width should be multiplied by a factor of three for 

two-lane traffic and two for single-lane traffic.  In the opinion of the Co-Authors, smaller 

widths create an uncomfortable and unsafe operating environment, resulting in slower 

traffic and constrained production.  However, this needs to be balanced against the 

additional costs associated with increasing ramp widths purely for production purposes.  

With this in mind and: 

 assuming the proposed 40 t articulated dump truck to be used at Spectrum Pit has a 
physical truck-operating width of approximately 4.0 m, the safety berm height = 1.0 m 

and the safety berm width = 2.5 m (based on an assumed tyre diameter of 1.9 m), and 

the drainage channel = 0.50 m, the design width for the in-pit haul road = (3 x 4.0 m) 

+ 2.5 m + 0.5 m = 15.0 m; and  

 assuming the proposed 100 t rigid frame dump truck to be used at Donnelly Pit has a 
physical truck-operating width of approximately 6.5 m, the safety berm height = 2.0 m 

and the safety berm width = 5.0 m (based on an assumed tyre diameter of 2.7 m), and 

the drainage channel = 0.50 m, the design width for the in-pit haul road = (3 x 6.5 m) 

+ 5.0 m + 0.5 m = 25.0 m.   

A reduction in road grade significantly increases a vehicle's attainable uphill speed, hence 

haulage cycle times and fuel consumption rates.  Stress on mechanical components hence 

maintenance costs also vary with road gradient and they too can be minimized, to some 

extent, by limiting the severity of haul road grades.  With this in mind, a maximum haul 

road gradient of 1:10 was selected for both the Spectrum Pit and for Donnelly Pit, based 

on world best practice for the type of trucks that will be utilized. 

16.11 Pushback Designs 

The following methodology was followed during the pushback design process:  

 use the selected optimal pit shells derived from the pit optimisation as the design limit;  

 use the block model to show the distribution and grade of mineralization; and  

 apply the pit design criteria and geotechnical parameters.  

The available pit footprints were utilized for pushback haul roads wherever possible, instead of 

expanding the pits' walls.  All pit design work was performed in Maptek's VulcanTM mine design 

software program.  A total of three pushbacks were designed for Spectrum Pit, based on the 

selected interim pit shells.  The designs were used to evaluate the tonnage and grades of the various

material types for discreet mining zones, which in turn were applied to the production scheduling.  

For Donnelly Pit, a total of seven pushbacks were designed, based on the selected interim pit shells.  

The designs were used to evaluate the tonnage and grades of the various material types for discreet 

mining zones which in turn were applied to the production scheduling.  

16.12 Pit Optimization Compliance 

The openpit designs are based on the outputs from conventional LG-style pit optimization 

techniques that establish mineable shapes using information obtained from the block models used 

to compile Mineral Resource estimates that are the subject of this Technical Report.  The block 

models were imported into Maptek's VulcanTM pit optimization software for analysis. 

The Maptek VulcanTM program uses a series of economic constraints as well as slope angle 

limitations and material handling recoveries to establish the most economic mining envelope 

possible.  Maptek VulcanTM optimization is an iterative process using costs developed during 

previous studies, which are then refined to be as accurate as possible.  The following summarizes 

the optimization process: 

 creation of a range of nested pit shells of increasing size achieved by varying the product price 
and generating a pit shell at each price point;  

 selection of the optimal pit shell by generating various production schedules for each pit shell 
and calculating the net present value ("NPV") for each schedule, the output of this process 

being a series of pit versus value curves; and 

 the optimal LG shell for each pit represents the break-even mining limits based on the supplied 
input parameters when assessed in conjunction with the overall production targets (although 

the resultant mining envelope is not practical to mine as there are no access ramps or 

consideration for other surface constraints). 

In general, when optimal shells are converted into practical pits, the NPVs of the resultant pits are 

expected to be lower because of the extra waste that has to be mined to make room for access 

ramps.  Furthermore, additional surface constraints can impact on the maximum depths achievable 

within a pit, resulting in some loss of above-grade material.   It is however important that the 

difference in volumes and overall value is kept at a minimum.  

16.12.1 Spectrum Pit 

It is established in Section 16.3 that the topographical constraints and uncertainties relating 

to access to the upper elevations of the target Central Zone mineralization (as defined by 

the Mineral Resource estimate detailed in Section 14) have resulted in a much smaller 

ultimate pit than could in theory be achieved: 

 access to the upper benches of the optimal LG pit is considered by the Co-Authors to 
be problematic, in that it includes a section along a steep and deep ravine, as well as 

sections along known avalanche channels and areas of potentially unstable scree; and 

 the risks require additional examination and mitigation before an access road capable 
of accessing the upper elevations could realistically and confidently be planned; 

therefore

 production from Spectrum Pit is instead limited to what can practicably, safely and 
sustainably be realized by means of mid-pit access only. 

Table 16.6 provides a comparison between the ultimate Spectrum Pit design and the 

optimal LG shell used for purposes of compiling the 2017, Central Zone Mineral Resource 

estimate stated in Section 14.  It may be seen that there is a significant decrease in the total 

waste tonnes (86%) and total ROM tonnes (79%).  This results in a net decrease in the 

overall average stripping ratio from 1.29 to 0.61, inclusive of pre-strip, or 0.52 excluding 

pre-strip.  There is also an overall increase in the average metal grades, which is due to a 

higher grade cut-off (0.435 AuEq) being applied for purposes of the ultimate pit design, 

compared with the 0.40 AuEq cut-off applied for purposes of Mineral Resource estimation.

The difference in the stripping ratios stated on Table 16.6 reflects the difference in 

approach suggested by different authors.  For purposes of the PEA the 0.52 strip ratio is 

preferred and has been reported because the pre-strip material is capitalized as a pre-

production activity. 

16.12.2 Donnelly Pit 

Table 16.7 provides a comparison between the ultimate pit design content and the LG 

optimization limits for Donnelly Pit.  It may be seen that there is a 40% decrease in the 

total waste as well as a 12% decrease in the insitu tonnes of mineralized material above 

grade cut-off (0.105% CuEq for the ultimate pit, 0.15% for the LG pit envelope), at similar 

copper grades but at lower gold and silver grades.  The lower grade cut-off for the ultimate 

design pit means that the results include marginal grade material that will be stockpiled 

and processed at the end of the production mine life (starting at the end of Year 23).  This 

results in a net decrease in the stripping ratio from 1.31 to 0.64, inclusive of pre-strip and 

including marginal grade material in the quantity of insitu material.  In the opinion of the 

Co-Authors, there is reasonable correlation between the LG optimized pit shell and the 

ultimate pit design, for a project of this type.

1 – Strip Ratio = Total Waste / Insitu ROM Material 

2 – Strip Ratio = (Waste + Marginal Grade Material) / Insitu ROM Material 

The difference in the stripping ratios stated on Table 16.7 reflects the difference in 

approach suggested by different authors.  For purposes of the PEA the 0.86 strip ratio is 

preferred and has been reported because the pre-strip material is capitalized and the 

marginal grade material might or might not be processed at the end of the mine life, 

depending on prevailing operating costs and metal prices at that time.  For purposes of PEA 

cashflow modelling (see Section 22) it has been assumed that the marginal grade material 

is processed at the end of the mine life because unescalated operating costs and straight-

line, long-term metal prices were assumed in analysis (which model assumptions render 

the stockpiled marginal grade material economic above a cut-off of 0.105% CuEq).  For 

this case the stripping ratio would equal 0.63 (129.56 / 206.47). 

16.13 Production Schedule 

Several production scenarios were reviewed to determine the most economic and operationally 

sound solution.  The main driving factors were the mining capacities that influence project costs, 

and the ability to separately mine ROM material, marginal material and waste.  The primary goals 

for the chosen, combined production scenario were to limit capital while maintaining ROM 

production at 10,000 tpd from Production Year 1 through Year 5, at 20,000 tpd from Year 6 

through Year 11 and then at 30,000 tpd from Year 12 onwards.  The ROM production rate for 

Spectrum Pit limited to 5,000 tpd from Year 6, for the reasons earlier described.  The tonnage 

profile also encompassed the tonnage ramp-up profile for plant throughput described in Section 

13.6. 

16.13.1 Methodology 

The life-of-mine production schedule was compiled using an industry standard approach 

for strategic mine planning.  The Maptek EvolutionTM production scheduling program was 

used to optimize the mining sequence for each pushback at both Spectrum Pit and Donnelly 

Pit.  For Spectrum Pit, muck handling constraints precluded the separation of marginal 

grade material from waste, with the result that ROM material and waste only were 

considered in analysis.  For Donnelly Pit, scheduled blocks were categorized as ROM 

material, marginal grade material or waste, based on the grade cut-off for each block within

the geological block models.  The strategy to level waste stripping while still utilizing the 

value-adding strategy of delaying the processing of stockpiled marginal grade material 

from Donnelly Pit were also used to achieve the project goals.  This strategy resulted in 

pushback life being minimized with as little as possible overlap for waste stripping, thereby 

making the schedule more practical.  It also reduced the mining fleet requirement, 

especially during ramp-up. 

16.13.2 Dilution 

A preliminary analysis of dilution potential was carried out, assuming the 80% of the 

average grade for each metal of interest of a notionally mined block, plus 5% of the average 

grade for the same metals of interest in the four laterally adjacent blocks, thereby to yield 

a 100% overall, average diluted grade for the notionally mined block of interest.  In the 

vast majority of cases the diluting effect outlined was negligible, due to the broadly uniform 

and persistent nature of the grade distributions (especially in Donnelly Pit). 

16.13.3 PEA Production Plan and Schedule 

The overall production plan is summarized on Table 16.8.  Figure 16.16 summarizes the 

tonnage schedule for Spectrum Pit, Figure 16.17 summarizes the tonnage schedule for 

Donnelly Pit and Figure 16.18 summarizes the average and pit-specific grade profiles.  

Scrutiny of the classification of the Mineral Resources within the block models for the 

deposits of interest show that 76% of the ROM material from Spectrum Pit is in the 

Indicated category of Mineral Resources, rising to 96% in the case of Donnelly Pit.  In both 

cases, the balance of notionally mined material is in the Inferred category of Mineral 

Resources.

Figure 16.18 The Grade Profile for the ROM Plant Feed, Spectrum and Donnelly Pits, 

Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

 

It may be seen from consideration of Figure 16.18 that the overall average ROM plant feed during 

Years 6 through 11 receives a significant boost in average gold grades and a modest reduction in 

the overall average copper grade.  It is during Years 6 through 11 that Spectrum Pit contributes to 

the ROM plant feed, which is critical to overall project economics: the boost in the average gold 

grade quickly pays for the second tranche of capital, the majority of which is expended in Year 5, 

to bring Spectrum Pit on-line, to increase production capacity at Donnelly Pit and to both install a 

SAG mill and to increase plant throughput capacity to 20,000 tpd, per the discussions of Sections 

17 and 22. 

16.14 Qualified Persons' Opinion 

In the Co-Authors' opinion the mine planning, design and scheduling studies detailed above are 

sufficient to support the PEA and are therefore sufficient to advance the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au 

project to the pre-feasibility stage.  The pit optimization, excavation design and production 

scheduling studies have been performed to best industry practices and conform to the requirements 

of CIM 2014 Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  It should, 

however, be emphasized that the production schedule is provisional and preliminary, hence subject 

to change in the event that: 

 additional drilling is carried out and the Mineral Resource estimates, on which the schedule 
relies, are as a result changed; and/or 

 the assumed metal price, metallurgical recovery rates or operating costs change; and/or 

 the recommended production optimization and trade-off studies are carried out; and/or

 an increased level of confidence in the geohazards and geotechnical environment lead to a 
change in the pit limits or overall average slope angles; and/or 

 mineralization contiguous to the notionally mined pits is extracted (to the south in the Central 
Zone and to the north of the Donnelly Pit, in the North Donnelly deposit). 

The geotechnical study carried out for purposes of the PEA is preliminary and provisional, hence 

subject to change.  The additional data identified in Section 16.3 is required before pit slope 

configurations can be designed to a high level of confidence.  Risk also exists as regards Spectrum 

Pit, production from which relies on a preliminary and provisional muck handling system that 

needs to be robustly engineered at the pre-feasibility stage of project development.  This does not 

detract from the overall conclusion that the PEA studies reported here are sufficient to support the 

PEA, but it does emphasize the importance, going forward, of the recommended production 

optimization and trade-off studies.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Overview 

The as-designed process largely resembles many operating B.C. copper/gold plants.  At 20,000 

tpd or higher, the process employs crushing, SAG and ball milling to a product size of P80 120 

microns, then copper/gold rougher flotation to produce a concentrate which is re-ground and 

cleaned to yield a saleable-grade copper concentrate, enriched in gold and silver. 

Tailings from the copper rougher float are subjected to bulk sulphide flotation.  In a departure from 

typical B.C. porphyry treatment practice, the bulk sulphide concentrate is combined with the 

copper cleaner tails, thickened and leached by CIL to recover gold, with the cyanide subsequently 

destroyed in a detox circuit.  The carbon is treated on site to extract the gold (and minor silver), 

which is smelted and sold as doré. 

Doré is first produced at the start of Stage 2 of the project, when ROM feed at 5,000 tpd from 

Spectrum Pit is blended with ROM feed from Donnelly Pit at 15,000 tpd.  During Stage 1, plant 

feed comprises 100% feed from Donnelly Pit, at a rate of 10,000 tpd, from which gold gravity 

concentrates are produced for sale in the market.  Phase 3 starts in Production Year 12 when plant 

feed once again comprises 100% feed from Donnelly Pit, but at a rate of 30,000 tpd.  Figure 17.1 

provides a summary of the plant feed profile over the modelled 25 year project life, which profile 

includes the tonnage ramp-up profile discussed in Section 13.6.  The phased approach to plant 

capacity was adopted for the reasons described in Section 2.3.1 (operational, technical and capital 

risk management).

Processing during Stage 1 will be by a conventional copper/gold porphyry flowsheet, incorporating 

two stages of crushing and ball milling, followed by rougher flotation, concentrate regrinding and 

cleaner flotation to produce a pulp containing the final concentrate. A gravity circuit will be 

incorporated into the grinding circuit. The concentrate will be dewatered by thickening and 

filtration and loaded into trucks for delivery to Port of Stewart from where it will be shipped to 

smelters located in the Far East (see Section 19).  Figure 17.2 summarizes the Stage 1 process 

flow.

It is established in Section 16 that ROM material from Donnelly Pit will be tipped onto a 

production grizzley that reports direct to a rasebored muckpass.  The tipped material reports to a 

second grizzley located at the bottom of the muckpass where the ROM material will be screened 

prior to primary crushing: oversize will be fed to a gyratory crusher; while undersize and the 

gyratory crusher product will be conveyed to a coarse ore stockpile with a 24 hour live capacity.

Material will be withdrawn from the stockpile through one of a series of feeders, then conveyed to 

a double deck screen, the lower deck of which will have 25 mm apertures: 

 screen oversize will be fed to a secondary (cone) crusher for crushing to 25 mm, from where 

it will be returned to the screen; 

 screen undersize will be fed to a fine ore storage bin; and 

 material from the bin will be conveyed to a ball mill for primary grinding. 

Lime will be added to the ball mill feed to condition the pyrite and to aid its depression in 

downstream copper flotation circuits.  The ball mill will operate in closed circuit with 

hydrocyclones.  Hydrocyclone underflow will be returned to the ball mill, while overflow will be 

delivered to copper rougher flotation.  A gravity unit will be installed on a 20% bleed from the ball 

mill cyclone underflow to capture coarse gold trapped in the circuit.  Potassium amyl xanthate will 

be added to the cyclone overflow. 

The gravity concentrate will be collected and upgraded (using a shaking table) to refinery grade, 

and will be sold directly to refineries.  Tailings from the shaking table will be delivered to the 

copper concentrate thickener. 

Copper rougher flotation will be carried out using 5 x 130 m3 conventional tank cells.  The 

copper/gold concentrate produced from copper rougher flotation will be delivered to regrind 

cyclones.  Underflow from the cyclones will gravitate to a vertimill, the product from which will 

be recycled to the regrind cyclones.  Overflow from the hydrocyclones, sized at P80 20 microns, 

will be delivered to a bank of 50 m3 cleaner cells.  Concentrate from these cleaner cells will be 

further cleaned using a flotation column.  Tailings from the column will be scavenged using a bank 

of 25 m3 mechanically agitated column scavenger cells, with the concentrate circulated back to the 

column feed.  Column scavenger tails will be circulated to the regrind cyclone feed pump box.  

17.3 Stage 2 (20,000 tpd) 

During Stage 2, the plant will process a total of 20,000 tpd of a blended feed from the Spectrum 

and Donnelly Pits.  Figure 17.3 summarizes the Stage 2 process flow. 

It is established in Section 16 that ROM material from Spectrum Pit will trucked from the bottom 

of the Spectrum muckpass system to the MIA where it will be dumped on a coarse material pad 

from where it will be lifted and belt fed onto the coarse stockpile, where it will be blended with 

ROM material from Donnelly Pit.  Material from the Donnelly Pit will be crushed using the 54" x 

75" gyratory crusher installed for Stage 1, and then delivered to the coarse stockpile. 

Blended Spectrum-Donnelly ROM material will be fed from the coarse stockpile into a primary 

SAG mill.  Product from the mill will be screened, with screen oversize (pebbles) returned by 

conveyor to the SAG mill feed.  Screen undersize will be pumped to the ball mill cyclone feed 

pumpbox. 

The ball milling, gravity recovery and copper flotation circuit will be the same as in Stage 1, but 

with extra flotation capacity added as needed to ensure provision of the necessary flotation 

residence time. 

Copper flotation is largely unchanged from Stage 1, but the copper rougher tails will be subjected 

to a desulphurization pyrite float.  Concentrate from this float will be combined with the copper

first cleaner tails were it will be thickened to 55% solids, and then cyanide leached with carbon 

through a leach circuit with short residence time (12 hours).  A regrind mill has not been included 

on the leach feed as the beneficial effect of regrinding has not been fully established.  Cyanide will 

be added in the first four hours of the leach, but its concentration will be allowed to drop through 

the last eight hours.  In addition, an SO2/air cyanide detox circuit will be installed to ensure the 

leach residue contains negligible free cyanide.  The activated carbon from the leach circuit, loaded 

with gold and silver, will be stripped and regenerated through a conventional carbon handling 

circuit including elution and regeneration, electrowinning of the precious metals, calcining in an 

oven and, finally, smelting into doré.  A small Acacia refinery package has also been included, 

which will process the gravity concentrate, so allowing the precious metals to be delivered to the 

refinery for conversion to doré.

17.4 Stage 3 (30,000 tpd) 

Stage 3 will operate at 30,000 tpd, with 100% of the feed coming from the Donnelly Pit.  The cone 

crusher used for secondary crushing in Stage 1 will be re-assigned for pebble crushing duty so 

enhancing SAG mill capacity.  Additional grinding and flotation capacity will be added as needed 

to satisfy the process design criteria.  Figure 17.4 summarizes the Stage 3 process flow that, other 

than the adjustments described, remains largely unchanged from Stage 2.

17.6 Equipment Selection 

Circuit design has been driven by the stage-based production growth schedule, but has striven to 

limit the installation of equipment left redundant in latter stages of the project.  For example, the 

cone crusher has been sized to operate as a secondary crusher feeding a large ball mill at Stage 1, 

then later as a pebble crusher at Stage 3.  Similarly, one of the two ball mills has been sized to mill 

10,000 tpd of crushed (minus 25 mm) material for Stage 1, then as the unit for grinding the SAG 

mill product at Stage 2, before being augmented with a smaller ball mill for Stage 3.  The larger 

ball mill is exactly twice the size of the smaller one, so the ball mill motors are standardized at 5.5 

MW, with a twin drive on the larger mill and a single drive on the smaller mill. 

Rougher flotation for Stage 1 uses smaller 130 m3 tank cells to ensure enough tanks to limit short-

circuiting.  With higher tonnages, additional capacity is provided through the use of 200 m3 tank 

cells.  Table 17.2 summarizes these and other details of the main items of the selected equipment.

17.7 Qualified Person's Opinion 

The process flow, as described above, is similar to many copper-gold circuits that are currently 

operating in B.C.  The selected equipment is also mostly typical of that in common use in B.C. 

and elsewhere.  As such and in the opinion of QP Martin, the process flow presents little 

technological risk.   

Two small departures from common convention are included in the design.  The first is driven by 

the need to design a processing facility capable of milling at three throughput rates, as planned for 

the first 11 production years of the Project (the last – Stage 3 – lasting through to the end of the 

planned project life of 25 years).  This has led to the use of the larger ball mill to act as a primary 

mill during Stage 1 (10,000 tpd), receiving feed from two stages of crushing.  While unusual in 

the modern industry, such a circuit was widely used in mining throughout most of the last century.  

In the opinion of the QP Martin, this potentially reduces the technical risk to the project, by 

allowing the mine to operate prior to purchasing the SAG mill.  This allows for more extensive 

sampling of the active pit and more careful checking of SAG mill sizing than would be otherwise 

be possible. 

The second departure is the use of cyanide leaching of the pyrite-rich products arising from the 

flotation circuit, which products have been demonstrated to be amenable to leaching.  This is very 

common practice in the gold mining industry but it is fairly uncommon in copper mining, because: 

either the gold contained in pyrite on most copper mines typically does not respond well to cyanide 

leaching; or the presence of secondary copper minerals in a pyrite-rich stream leads to excessive 

cyanide consumption.  Neither of these constraints apply in the case of the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au 

project. 

In the opinion of QP Martin, the technical risks associated with the circuit design are within typical 

limits for a PEA level of design.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

The Principal Author and QP Scott Britton, C. Eng. (the "Co-Authors") are jointly responsible for 

this section of this Technical Report.  Details concerning dam construction and details of TSF-

related infrastructure were compiled from information supplied by QP M. John Brodie, P. Eng.  

Greenwood Environmental Inc. of Vancouver B.C. ("Greenwood") provided advice concerning 

the environmental elements related to infrastructure planning. 

18.1 Planning Criteria 

It is established in Section 2 that a key objective of the PEA is to engineer solutions that encompass 

safety considerations as well as practical, physical and operational constraints, thereby to ensure 

practicably achievable and sustainable outcomes.  In addition, as stated in Section 4 and to the 

extent possible, planning and design should encompass the Tahltan Nation's requirements that, to 

the best knowledge and understanding of the Co-Authors, may be summarized as follows: 

 minimize the project footprint by using existing infrastructure where possible and practicable; 

 keep the planned infrastructure to one watershed, unless existing infrastructure extends into or 
from a different watershed; 

 use best practice in design (which, for the most part, is applicable at the feasibility level of 
project development); 

 respect wildlife, heritage/archaeology and Tahltan Nation rights; 

 meet applicable environmental plans, including those detailed in the CIS LRMP (see Section 
4.9); and 

 engineer solutions that encompass considerations of zero contamination discharge to the 
environment. 

18.2 Overview 

Figure 18.1 (which is a compilation of Figures 5.10 and 5.11) provides a general summary of the 

planned infrastructure and its position with respect to the two main river drainages that occur in 

the general area of interest.  It may be seen that: 

 for the reasons described in Section 4.9 and to the extent that is practicable and possible, the 
infrastructure has been kept away from the Project Area boundary, most especially where it 

adjoins the Mount Edziza Provincial Park boundary; 

 the majority of the planned infrastructure is located on claims that are 100% owned by the 
Company - the only exception is that portion of the access road to the Spectrum Pit area that 

extends over the Designated Access Corridor described in Section 4; and 

 with the exceptions of the planned Northwest Transmission Line take-off sub-station, a 
security gate at the turning off of Willow Creek Road from Highway 37, approximately 98% 

of Willow Creek Road and a portion of the powerline to the MIA, all the planned infrastructure 

is contained within the Stikine River drainage.

18.2.1 Heritage/Archaeology 

Further to its on-going heritage/archaeological commitments to the Tahltan First Nation, 

the Company carries out AIAs, as and when required (as described in Section 4.9).  The 

Company also maintains Project Area plans detailing archaeological sites, the areas where 

AIAs have been carried out and the areas where SAPs have been secured and known sites 

mitigated under Section 12 of the Heritage Conservation Act (as described in Section 4.9).  

To respect the Tahltan Nation's request that the locations of archaeological sites are kept 

confidential and are not shown on any maps or plans intended for public dissemination, the 

Company's archaeological plans are not presented here.  

As part of a larger due diligence process, the Principal Author examined the Company's 

archaeological plans for the Project Area and concluded that key infrastructure elements 

are located in areas where AIAs have not been carried out.  The Company has advised the 

Co-Authors that it acknowledges that AIAs will be required and that if one or more of the 

infrastructure locations coincides with an area identified as an archaeological site, 

infrastructure planning will have to be modified unless an SAP could be secured.  The 

Company has advised the Principal Author that the undertaking of AIAs, across areas on 

which the planned infrastructure is located, forms part of the Company's project 

development plans going forward. 

18.2.2 Geotechnical Site Investigations 

No formal site geotechnical investigations have been carried out to characterize the ground 

across the planned areas of infrastructure development.  Reasonable estimates of likely 

conditions, based on percentages of soil and rock, have instead been made.  The Company 

acknowledges that site investigations will be required, and the Company has advised the 

Principal Author that their undertaking forms part of the Company's project development 

plans going forward. 

18.3 Main Infrastructure Area 

The first point of reference, in the iterative process leading to the planned infrastructure considered 

herein, is the location of the MIA.  It will serve as the main operations centre for the Spectrum-GJ 

project, insofar as the following infrastructure elements will be located at the MIA: 

 a laydown / storage area for the topsoil and till removed during the site preparation / earthworks 
phase of MIA construction; 

 a powerline off-take and power distribution system, the latter including a powerline to the 
Donnelly primary crusher station (located underground, as described in Section 16.6); 

 an emergency diesel generation facility and fuel supply, storage and distribution facility 
(including the main tank farm); 

 a fresh, process and mine water supply, storage and distribution facility, including tank farms 
for potable and recycled water; 

 a construction camp, first built for the construction phase and expanded as appropriate for the 
production phase, inclusive of sewerage and waste disposal facilities;

 a single storey mine dry for Spectrum Pit and Donnelly Pit personnel (Spectrum Pit personnel 
will be bussed to/from the MIA, as required), with a standard area allowance of 5.81 m2 per 

hourly paid worker on shift; 

 a single storey, general administration and Donnelly Pit offices block, with a standard area 
allowance of 25.5 m2 per salaried employee; 

 a 1,000 m2 (floor area) maintenance shop where all major equipment repairs, etc will be carried 
out; 

 a 750 m2 (floor area) main warehouse and a cold storage building; 

 a systems control and communications with a broadband satellite-based communication 
system and an office Management Information System (MIS) Network; 

 a suitably located explosives handling and storage facility, with a standard capacity allowance 
of 0.00883 m3 per kg/day of ANFO; 

 an uncovered primary crushed ROM storage and load-out facility; 

 a double height process plant with a total area allowance of 220,000 m2, inclusive of a doré 
production facility, a reagent handling and storage facility, a concentrate storage shed and a 

laboratory; 

 a fire protection and prevention facility, along with a first aid facility and medivac station; and 

 a security gatehouse and related security fencing (the latter focusing mainly on the plant and 
office areas). 

18.3.1 Location Options 

Areas suitable for locating the MIA are limited by virtue of topography, drainage patterns 

and the proximity of the Mount Edziza Provincial Park.  Three potential sites were, 

however, identified through scrutiny of topographic and water drainage plans for the 

Project Area.  These are identified on Figure 18.2 as locations A, B and C (the location-

identifying circles each have a diameter of 1.2 km [area = 1.13 km2, with additional space 

if required] which, in the opinion of the Co-Authors, is sufficient to safely and sustainably 

accommodate the MIA infrastructure elements described above): 

 Location A was identified because it is the first area of reasonably flat ground in the 
Stikine River drainage, north of the Willow Creek Road (as such it represents the option 

that results in the shortest length of powerline from the planned take-off substation 

adjacent to the turnoff of Willow Creek Road from Highway 37); 

 Location B was identified because it is the closest area of reasonably flat ground to the 
southeast of the Spectrum Pit area where an MIA would be screened from view from  

Mount Edziza Provincial Park (as such it represents the option that results in the 

shortest practicable haul distance for ROM material from the Spectrum Pit area to the 

central processing plant located at the MIA); and 

 Location C was identified as a potential site where all key infrastructure could be 
consolidated near to the planned Donnelly Pit from where the bulk of the ROM material 

for processing will be mined, at least within the scope of the PEA presented herein.

18.3.2 Risk and Opportunity Analysis 

A risk and opportunity approach was adopted for purposes of selecting a potentially 

suitable MIA location, inclusive of considerations of: 

 the seven CIS LRMP components described in Sub-Section 4.9.4 (Biodiversity; 
Wildlife; Aquatic Ecosystems and Riparian Habitat; Hunting, Trapping, Guide-

Outfitting and Fishing; Recreation/Tourism; Visual Quality; and Timber); 

 Greenwood's advice concerning wildlife issues, acid drainage potential and 
heritage/archaeology; and 

 safety, practicality and operational constraints including accessibility, groundwork, 
weather, powerline length, potential TSF location(s) and the lengths of tailings disposal 

lines. 

Figure 18.3 summarizes the road access, powerline route and muck handling system 

required for Option A; Figure 18.4 summarizes the same infrastructure elements, but for 

Option B.  Details of the infrastructure requirements for Site C (located on Klastline 

Plateau) were not compiled and are not presented here - early in the selection process the 

location was found to not be viable for the reasons described below. 

Tables 18.1 through 18.3 provide summaries of the Co-Authors findings concerning each 

identified area of potential concern, as summarized above.  It may be seen that data gaps 

concerning biodiversity and heritage/archaeology exist, the latter as described in 18.2.  In 

both cases the Company has advised the Co-Authors that it recognizes that data gaps exist, 

that they need to be filled going forward and that the planned location of the MIA might 

have to be modified, depending on results.  Greenwood's recommended action plans as 

regards biodiversity surveys and AIAs are described in Section 20.

 Table 18.1 A Summary of Opportunities and Risks, MIA Location Option A 

Parameter Comments 

Biodiversity Data gap - to be advised (appropriate surveys required, going forward). 

Wildlife 

Muck handling requires construction of an approx. 4.3 km long overland 

belt conveyance across the plateau area, extending south from Donnelly 

Pit.  This would restrict wildlife movements, unless appropriately designed 

(which design would inevitably incur additional capital expenditures). 

Aquatic Ecosystems, 

Riparian Habitat 

Waste dump and marginal grade stockpile have to be sited to north of pit 

where local topography could result in water drainage from dump / 

stockpile draining into a south-flowing creek. 

Timber 

Location in moderately wooded area (visual assessment), tree cutting 

would be required (amount to be assessed at FS stage, but would be kept to 

a minimum, per the requirements of the Environmental Management Plan). 

Recreation/Tourism 

No 'unique volcanic features' will be damaged or destroyed within the 

scope of the planned operations, as none exist in the target project 

development areas. 

Visibility 

MIA location naturally screened by vegetation and local topography 

(visibility risk very low), but plateau infrastructure probably highly visible 

from both the east and the west. 

Heritage/Archaeology Data gap - to be advised (AIA surveys required, going forward). 

Accessibility 

Straightforward 28 km from Highway 37 turnoff, along Willow Creek 

Road and then onto new road alignment (approx. 4.5 km).   

Donnelly Pit access road could be used as back-up for muck handling, in 

the event that the primary crusher goes down (located adjacent to the pit). 

Groundworks 

Thin till and thin soils anticipated, but this needs to be confirmed by means 

of an appropriate ground survey at the FS stage. 

No challenging topography exists and minor earthworks only are expected 

(average existing gradient approx. 8%). 

Weather 

Location sheltered from adverse weather, to the extent possible.  Muck 

handling system located on plateau exposed to adverse weather (potential 

operational constraint, but only for what are expected to be short periods of 

extreme weather).  Rime icing, of the type that hampered the automated 

meteorological station installed and operated on Klastline Plateau between 

June 2005 and September 2008 (see Section 5.4), would represent a more 

persistent operational risk. 

Powerline Length 

Approx. 24 km from take-off sub-station adjacent to Highway 37 to site 

sub-station located at MIA.  Least length hence least capital expenditure 

for three options considered in analysis. 

TSF Location(s) 

Life-of-mine facility.  Dam height not especially onerous.  Most favourable 

/ least risk option of all TSF locations considered in analysis (see Section 

18.4). 

Tailings Disposal Lines 

Minor elevation change from MIA-located plant to TSF dam. 

NAG tailings disposal pipelines initially up to 6.5 km long – relay pump 

stations would be required (higher operational and environmental risks, and 

capital expenditure requirement than for Option B, but lower operational 

and environmental risks than for Option C). 

PAG tailings lines approx. 2 km long, capacity approx. 3 ktpd versus up to 

approx. 27 ktpd of NAG material.

      Table 18.2 A Summary of Opportunities and Risks, MIA Location Option B 

Parameter Comments 

Biodiversity Data gap - to be advised (appropriate surveys required, going forward). 

Wildlife 

Pit-side infrastructure requirement the least for the three locations 

considered - a loading / tipping apron only is required (muck is tipped 

direct into a muckpass for primary crushing underground).  Wildlife 

interactions the least for three options considered in analysis. 

Aquatic Ecosystems, 

Riparian Habitat 

Waste dump and marginal grade stockpile sited to north and south of pit, 

respectively, from where water drainage from dump / stockpile reports to 

the pit. 

Timber 

Location in moderately to densely wooded area (visual assessment), tree 

cutting would be required (volume to be assessed at FS stage, but would be 

kept to a minimum, per the requirements of the Environmental 

Management Plan). 

Recreation/Tourism 

No 'unique volcanic features' will be damaged or destroyed within the 

scope of the planned operations, as none exist in the target project 

development areas. 

Visibility 
Location naturally screened by vegetation and local topography.  Visibility 

risk very low, including tipping point adjacent to Donnelly Pit. 

Heritage/Archaeology Data gap - to be advised (AIA surveys required, going forward). 

Accessibility 

Straightforward 36 km from Highway 37 turnoff onto Willow Creek Road 

then onto new road alignment (approx. 12.5 km).  Donnelly Pit access road 

could be used as back-up for muck handling from pit, in the event that the 

primary crusher (located underground) goes down. 

Groundworks 

Thin till and thin soils anticipated, but this needs to be confirmed by means 

of an appropriate ground survey at the FS stage. 

No challenging topography exists and minor earthworks only are expected 

(average existing gradient approx. 10%). 

Weather 

Location sheltered from adverse weather, to the extent possible.  Muck 

handling system unlikely to be adversely affected, except over short 

periods of extreme weather. 

Powerline Length 

Approx. 33 km from take-off sub-station adjacent to Highway 37 to site 

sub-station located at MIA. 

Additional capital expenditure compared with Option A, but less than for 

Option C. 

TSF Location(s) 
Life-of-mine facility same as for Option A.  Best / least risk option of all 

TSF locations considered in analysis (see Section 18.4). 

Tailings Disposal Lines 

Slightly larger elevation change from MIA-located plant to TSF dam than 

for Option A. 

NAG tailings disposal pipeline approx. 2.0 km long.  Significantly reduced 

environmental and operational risks compared with Option A.  Lower 

capital expenditure too. 

PAG tailings disposal pipeline up to approx. 4.5 km long.  Increased 

environmental and operational risks compared with Option A.  Lower 

overall capital expenditure.

      Table 18.3:  A Summary of Opportunities and Risks, MIA Location Option C 

Parameter Comments 

Biodiversity Data gap - to be advised (appropriate surveys required, going forward). 

Wildlife Potentially significant interactions would occur in a popular hunting area 

known to be populated with a number of wildlife species (see Section 4.9).  

Wildlife could become habituated to the presence of extensive 

infrastructure, especially the camp (as previously reported around GJ camp, 

during a March 2007 ungulate survey - Rescan, 2008).  Risk of adverse 

human interactions highest for the three MIA location options considered. 

Aquatic Ecosystems, 

Riparian Habitat 

Water management from TSFs would be problematic; water could report to 

both local drainages.  High risk option. 

Timber No tree cutting would be required because vegetation is sparse and no trees 

exist on the plateau area (the location is above the tree line). 

Recreation/Tourism No 'unique volcanic features' will be damaged or destroyed within the 

scope of the planned operations, as none exist in the target project 

development areas. 

Visibility MIA and related pit infrastructure might be seen from designated 

recreation areas and from Highway 37.  Screening using trees would not be 

possible as the plateau area is above the tree line.  Visibility risk the 

greatest of the three MIA location options considered. 

Heritage/Archaeology Data gap - to be advised (AIA surveys required, going forward). 

Accessibility Straightforward approx. 33 km long road from Highway 37 turnoff to 

Donnelly Pit / MIA access road that is a moderately straightforward, 5.0 

km long road with maximum 10% gradient (average approximately 8%).  

Donnelly Pit / MIA access road would have to be used to haul Spectrum 

ROM material to MIA, which represents the highest environmental and 

operational risk of the three MIA location options considered in analysis. 

Groundworks Approx. 5 m of till and very thin soils only across plateau area.  

Topography essentially flat so minor earthworks only required during MIA 

construction. 

Weather MIA and all related infrastructure exposed to adverse weather.  Severe 

winds pose greatest potential risk (see Section 5.4). 

Powerline Length Approx. 40 km from take-off sub-station adjacent to Highway 37 to site 

sub-station located at MIA, including a challenging section up the steep, 

west facing slope of the plateau area (400 m elevation gain).  Additional 

capital expenditures compared with both Option A and Option C. 

TSF Location(s) Purpose of siting MIA on plateau area would be access to incised creeks 

leading off western margin of plateau.  Several TSFs would be required, 

each of which would be perched (high risk approach in seismically active 

area), despite which capacity constraints would mean a TSF in the same 

area as for Options A & B would inevitably be required.  Operational and 

environmental risks therefore at maximums for the three MIA location 

options considered.  Capital expenditures also highest due to the number 

and configurations of dams located in steep-sided, incised creek locations. 

Tailings Disposal Lines Complicated (operational and environmental risk) but elevation changes 

best suited to gravity-assisted tailings disposal. 

18.3.3 MIA Site Selection 

The findings summarized Tables 18.1 through 18.3 were used to compile the risk matrix 

presented as Table 18.4.  What is considered by the Co-Authors to be the best option for 

each parameter of interest is signified by the symbol, the intermediate option by the O 

symbol and the least attractive / highest risk option by the X symbol.  If the same parameter

for two different options is assessed to have approximately the same level of environmental 

or operational risk and/or cost, then both are signified by the or O symbol, with the same 

parameter for the least attractive option signified by the X symbol.

It may be concluded from consideration of Tables 18.1 through 18.4 that although there 

are capital expenditure benefits associated with the Option A site, the Option B site is 

preferred, mainly for reasons of its low wildlife interaction risk, the lower environmental 

risk for gravity assisted tailings disposal and the shorter haul distance for ROM material 

from the Spectrum Pit area.  It is the access road layouts and powerline details related to 

Option B that are considered in the following sections.  As previously stated, the Company 

acknowledges that biodiversity and heritage/archaeological surveys are required before 

details of the planned MIA can be finalized. 

18.4 Tailings Storage Facility - Location 

An integral part of the MIA site selection process was consideration of suitable TSF location(s).  

In common with siting the MIA, options are limited by topography and the proximity of Mount 

Edziza Provincial Park.  A number of possible sites were, however, identified through scrutiny of 

topographic and water drainage plans for the Project Area.  The identified sites are summarized on 

Figure 18.5, at the positions labelled W, X and Y1 through Y3: 

 the potential sites identified by the letter W are located on flat to gently sloping areas on 
Klastline Plateau; 

 the sites identified by the letter X are located in incised creeks around the margins of Klastline 
Plateau; and 

 the sites identified by the symbols Y1 through Y3 are located in the only topographic 
lows/valleys located on the Project Area.

18.4.1 On Klastline Plateau 

The W sites (those located on Klastline Plateau) were found to be unsuitable, for the 

following reasons: 

 more than one facility would be required, which increases the statistical probability of 
potential dam failure; 

 each facility would have to be individually located to optimize natural containment 
opportunities, which would be challenging due to the essentially flat topography - 

potentially very long dams would be required that would further increase the statistical 

probability of potential failure; 

 potential wildlife interactions would be at a maximum for the options considered in 
analysis (the results of environmental surveys indicate the presence of a number of 

significant herds of animals on Klastline Plateau [see Sections 4.9 and 20.1], and 

Klastline Plateau is known to be a favoured hunting area); 

 the visibility risk from both Highway 37 and Mount Edziza Provincial Park would be 
the highest for the options considered in analysis; 

 Klastline Plateau is known to suffer occasionally very high winds (see Section 5.4), 
which could result in significant and persistent dust problems; 

 there would be significant water management challenges, not least because drainage 
could in theory extend to both the Stikine and Iskut river systems; and 

 for operational, cost and efficiency reasons, the MIA would have to be sited at Location 
C identified in Section 18.3, which is by far the least favourable option of the three 

considered in analysis.  

18.4.2 Around the Margins of Klastline Plateau 

In the opinion of the Co-Authors, the X sites (those located in the steep- to very steep- 

sided and deeply incised creeks along the east and west margins of Klastline Plateau), 

would present higher environmental risks than the W sites, because: 

 several TSFs would be required (even then the capacity would be constrained) and the 
dams would be tall to very tall, perched and readily visible; 

 perched dams have the highest statistical risk of potential instability in seismically 
active areas (such as across the Project Area – see Section 5.7); and 

 the statistical probability of dam failure also increases with the number and dimensions 
of dams. 

In common with the W sites, there would be significant water management challenges if 

one or more of the X sites was selected, not least because drainage could in theory extend 

to both the Stikine and Iskut river systems.  Furthermore and in common with the W sites, 

the MIA would have to be sited at Location C identified in Section 18.3, which is by far 

the least favourable option of the three considered in analysis.

18.4.3 In Topographic Lows/Valleys 

Figure 18.6 identifies the locations and general outlines, at maximum capacity, of the TSFs 

that could be located in the three topographic lows/valleys located on the Project Area.  

Each has the potential to be a life-of-mine facility, as Table 18.5 suggests (the required 

storage capacity for the PEA production schedule described in Section 16 is approximately 

210 Mt [approximately 142 ±14 million m3 of tailings], although future planning might 

increase this requirement to at least 340 Mt, or approximately 232 ±20 million m3 of 

tailings).  Option Y1 requires two dams, one upstream (#1) and one downstream (#2) of a 

southwest draining creek.  Options Y2 and Y3 require only one dam each.  The stated 

potential capacities, estimated dam volumes and estimated wall heights (at maximum 

capacity) are preliminary and provisional estimates that are subject to change.

In the opinion of the Co-Authors, Option Y2 represents the least favourable of the three 

possible options, because: 

 it is located in a separate watershed from all the other main infrastructure elements (the 
only exceptions being elements of the planned road access and powerline for which no 

practicable alternatives exist); 

 it is very close to the local Project Area boundary; 

 it party overlies the GJ zone, where Mineral Resources could in future be defined; 

 at 310 m, the dam would be excessively high and it would, therefore, have an above-
average statistical probability of instability risk; 

 construction access would be complex, challenging and require additional access roads, 
which would be contrary to the minimum footprint requirement; and 

 tailings disposal would be very challenging (and represent an elevated statistical 
probability of environmental risk), unless the MIA was sited at the Option C location, 

which is by far the least favourable of the three potential MIA sites considered in 

analysis. 

In the opinion of the Co-Authors, Option Y1 is less favourable than Option Y3 because: 

 it is located in a separate watershed from all the other main infrastructure elements (the 
only exceptions being elements of the planned road access and powerline for which no 

practicable alternatives exist); 

 at both ends it is very close to the Project Area boundary; 

 it straddles the existing Willow Creek Road, thereby requiring the construction of a 
new access road alignment, which would be contrary to the least footprint objective 

and which would inevitably be very close to the Project Area boundary; 

 a by-pass system for the southeast draining creek would be required, which would 
further increase the footprint of the facility; and 

 the tailings disposal lines from the processing plant would be very long and thereby 
pose an above average statistical probability of environmental risk.  

Option Y3 is the preferred and selected option for a TSF, because: 

 it is located in the same watershed as all the other main infrastructure elements (the 
only exceptions being elements of the planned road access and powerline for which no 

practicable alternatives exist); 

 it is remote from the Project Area boundary and it is located between two steep 
mountain slopes that significantly reduce visibility risk; 

 it represents a single, consolidated life-of-mine facility; 

 the dam height is modest, it has an excellent dam to contained volume ratio and the 
south end of the facility is naturally constrained;

 its length to width ratio facilitates the safe disposal of PAG tailings (they could 
selectively be placed at the back / at the south end of the dam where they would always 

be under water); 

 the facility is close to potential MIA locations A and B, which reduces tailings pipeline 
lengths to practicable minimums, which in turn realizes environmental and operational 

benefits; and 

 it could readily be accessed from the planned site access road (an extensive internal 
access road system would not be required, which benefit is consistent with the 

minimum footprint requirement). 

Figure 18.7 provides a summary of the general layout of the planned TSF and related 

infrastructure.  The discussions of Section 18.5 justify the selection of a conventional wet 

TSF.  Surface water run-off ditches are required to limit the amount of surface water run-

off reporting to the TSF, which the Co-Authors consider an important design element due 

to: 

 the large catchment area for the dam site (estimated at 50 km2 without surface water 
run-off ditches, reducing to 37 km2 reporting to a maximum surface area for the dam 

of approximately 7.0 km2 – see Figure 18.8); and 

 the average annual precipitation for the area that can be at least 650 mm, not including 
storm events that can result in rainfall events of at least 50 mm in 12 hours (see Section 

5.4). 

The preceding points are emphasized because a persistent net positive precipitation to 

evaporation balance is anticipated for the planned TSF (and indeed any TSF located within 

the Project Area), with the possible exception of short periods during dry summer periods.  

This key consideration resulted in: 

 the assumption of a 5 m free board for the dam, to safely confine water within the TSF 
from where process water would either be recycled to the plant or pumped to a water 

treatment plant, via a polishing pond, to ensure zero contamination discharge to the 

environment; 

 the construction, in Production Year 20 of a spillway when the final planned dam height 
is acheived; and 

 the selection of a conventional wet TSF within the scope of project planning and cost 
estimation.

18.5 Dam Construction 

For purposes of project planning and cashflow modelling, it was assumed that a 17 m high starter 

dam, with a five year production capacity, would be constructed prior to production start-up.  The 

dam would then be raised by every production year thereafter until Production Year 20 when the 

final dam height will be achieved and a spillway will be constructed.  Prior to this, a water reclaim 

barge will operate in the TSF pond at the southern end of the impoundment, from where water will 

be pumped back to the processing plant for re-use.  Excess water contained within the TSF will be 

pumped to a water treatment plant, via a polishing pond and prior to release to the general 

environment. 

Preliminary and provisional estimates of the required dam heights and volumes were made at 

Production Years 5, 10 and 25, assuming: centreline construction (a vertical upstream face 

supported by the tailings beach and a 2:1 / 45° downstream face), a 5 m freeboard and a 15 m wide 

top surface.  It was further assumed that the core zone/filters of the dam will comprise till and 

processed sand/gravel and that the downstream shell will comprise compacted rock.  Table 18.6 

summarizes the results to which unit construction costs were applied for purposes of cost 

estimation.  It was assumed, for purposes of the PEA, that suitable materials could be found within 

the Project Area, inclusive of NAG waste rock from Donnelly Pit.

18.6 By-Pass Ditches 

The alignments of the surface water by-pass ditches identified on Figure 18.7 are preliminary and 

provisional, hence subject to change.  For purposes of planning and cost estimation, it was assumed 

that the ditches would be capable of routing, without over-topping, the flows corresponding to a 1 

in 200 year return period, 24 hour precipitation event, with an 0.3 m freeboard.  Their purpose will 

be to limit surface water inflows to the TSF, thereby to reduce the net annual water balance surplus 

that would require discharge to the general environment.  For purposes of the PEA, it has been 

assumed that: 

 the diversion ditches will be constructed on variably sloping terrain (approximate horizontal 
to vertical ratio = 3:1), which will require grubbing of about 15 m3/m of ditch length and 

excavation of about 5 m3/m of ditch length; 

 erosion protection will form part of ditch construction, depending on the excavation material 
(till or bedrock), design discharge and velocities;

 rock weir-drop structures might be required along some ditch sections; 

 a minimum bench width of 3.0 m, on the downslope sides of the ditches, to facilitate access 
and maintenance; and 

 diversion plugs will be constructed at the intersections with existing creeks, which will likely 
be excavated into the up-slope to effectively intercept seepage. 

18.7 Tailings Storage Facility - Type Selection 

The discussions of Section 18.5 and 18.6 assume the construction and use of a conventional wet 

tailings disposal facility.  The discussions of the following sub-sections justify this selection, based 

on technical and environmental analyses relating to TSF use within the specifics of the climate 

prevailing across the Project Area, as described in Section 5.4.  The risks and opportunities relating 

to a conventional wet facility versus a dry stack facility are considered and assessed.  The results 

show clearly that, given the potential climatic impacts, a dry stack facility would be neither 

technically feasible, practicable nor sustainable.  In marked contrast, a conventional wet facility at 

Site Y3 does not appear to have material negative aspects.  It is for these and related reasons that 

a conventional wet TSF is preferred and has been assumed within the scope of the PEA. 

18.7.1 Definitions 

The term 'conventional wet facility' insinuates that the tailings are saturated to facilitate 

their pumping to a disposal site: 

 the tailings are transported from a processing plant by tailings pipelines, using a 
combination of gravity and pumps; 

 the transported material is deposited in a pond that is impounded by a dam; 

 gravity induced settlement of placed material in time results in a progressive increase 
in density as water is squeezed out under pressure at a rate that is dependent on the time 

and depth of placed material to any point of interest, as well as the permeability of the 

placed material; and 

 for an average expected density of approximately 2.81 t/m3 for ROM feed to the central 
processing plant, the average density of placed tailings would probably vary between 

approximately 1.35 t/m3 and 1.60 t/m3, depending on the placed depth of tailings and 

the residence time of the same.      

The term 'dry stack facility' insinuates dewatered tailings (otherwise referred to as dry 

cake, by some authors) that cannot be pumped because the moisture content is below 

approximately 20%.  Dewatering is typically achieved using a combination of belt, drum, 

horizontal and vertical stacked pressure plates and vacuum filtration systems.  Dewatered 

tailings are typically transported by belt conveyor or truck, tipped or dumped on the tailings 

impound and then spread and compacted using appropriately sized equipment to form an 

unsaturated tailings deposit.  The use of equipment working on placed material is integral 

to design; appropriate designs and applications result in stable tailings deposits that do not 

usually require a dam but can require either waterproof berms and/or surface water by-pass 

ditches.  For an average expected density of approximately 2.81 t/m3 for ROM plant feed, 

the average density of placed tailings would probably vary between approximately 1.65 

t/m3 and 1.80 t/m3.

18.7.2 Disposal of Potentially Acid Generating Material 

The planned process flow for the expected ROM plant feed (see Section 17) includes a de-

sulphuration flotation circuit, at the back-end of the main flotation circuit, to produce a 

pyrite concentrate that contains gold.  Planning further assumes that the desulphurization 

circuit will be constructed during Production Year 5, for start-up in Production Year 6 

when the planned Spectrum Pit first produces ROM material for processing at the centrally 

located plant. 

Multi-element analysis of the tailings to be produced at the processing plant (as expected 

by virtue of metallurgical testwork - see Section 13) shows that it will have an average 

carbonate content of at least 10%, an average total feldspar content that could be as high 

as 50% and a residual sulphur content of approximately 0.05%, when a pyrite rougher 

concentrate is produced.  The expected average carbonate and feldspar content remains the 

same when a pyrite concentrate is not produced, but the average residual content increases 

to approximately 1.5%.  On this basis and for purposes of the PEA, pyrite-cleaned / de-

sulphurized tailings are considered NAG whereas tailings that are not cleaned of pyrite are 

assumed to be PAG (although, given the residual sulphur content is less than 2% and the 

neutralizing potential of the tails might be in excess of at least 25%, the tails could prove 

to be NAG – see also Sections 20.1 and 20.4, in which the need for additional testing and 

acid rock drainage characterizations is identified).   

In conventional wet tailings facilities, NAG tailings are typically and routinely placed 

behind the dam, thereby to form a so-called beach that moves the pond away from the dam, 

whereas PAG material is usually placed remote from the dam and in the deeper part of the 

pond to ensure it is always underwater.  In the case of dry stack tailings, if PAG material 

can be cleaned from the tailings stream then it is typically deposited in a separate, 

conventional wet tailings disposal facility.  If the tailings stream cannot be de-sulphurized 

then, in the opinion of the Principal Author, the scope for using a dry stack facility becomes 

limited, especially in wet and cold climates and most especially where a risk of inundation 

exists.  

Neither of the hypothetical dry stack alternatives outlined are considered practicable or 

environmentally sustainable within the Project Area, by virtue of the potential impacts of 

the local climate.  The discussions of the following sub-sections substantiate this, insofar 

as the potential climatic impacts render the design requirements for both a conventional 

wet facility and a notional dry stack facility substantially the same.  The purpose and 

objectives of attempting to construct a safe and environmentally sustainable dry stack 

facility in the first place may therefore reasonably be questioned. 

18.7.3 Discussion 

A dry stack TSF may be preferred where it can be demonstrated to be a viable, practicable 

and sustainable option: 

 they are suited to topographically challenged areas were an increased statistical risk of 
conventional wet facility dam instability can exist (although aggressive contouring of 

a planned site can sometimes be required, which in itself can be environmentally 

challenging);

 due to their inherent stability, true dry stacks are considered appropriate for seismically 
active areas; 

 true dry stacks are perceived to be environmentally safer because – 

o a dam is not in theory required, due to the inherent stability of well-designed dry 
stack facilities and because outflow potential is at a theoretical minimum (by 

definition and design, water content is kept to a practicable minimum), 

o they may be easier to close and rehabilitate (depending on the scope of erosion 
control measures), and 

o they may result in somewhat smaller footprints compared with conventional wet 
TSFs, due to the higher average density of the placed material. 

While the preceding benefits can be realized in environments where net negative 

precipitation to evaporation balances persist (i.e. in dry, hot climates), it should be 

emphasized that the terms 'dry stack' and 'dry cake' can be misleading: 

 placed dry stack material typically has a moisture content that is only a few percent 
below saturation point (there is a limit to the moisture content of placed material that 

can realistically and sustainably be achieved, for reasons of cost); 

 the addition of surface water, by virtue of rain, can rapidly change the characteristics 
of placed material, turning it into sludge or even conventional wet tailings, most 

especially if a persistent net positive precipitation to evaporation balance is anticipated 

or exists (as is the case for the planned TSF described in Section 18.4); 

 equipment traction is typically limited when operating on sludge, with the result that 
equipment efficiencies suffer and temporary halts to tailings production might be 

required; and 

 for a number of practical / operational reasons, temporary halts to tailings production 
can mean plant shutdowns with dramatic (and unsustainable) impacts on an operation 

as a whole - unless the TSF footprint is substantially larger than the quantity of 

delivered tailings, in which case the TSF surface could be compartmentalized and 

tailings could be placed and compacted accordingly (although this approach could be 

severely limited if there was a persistent net positive precipitation to evaporation 

balance). 

Risk could be mitigated through the addition of cement or other binders, to limit the 

potential impacts of rain.  However, success is limited by particle size distribution and void 

spaces, hence the porosity and permeability of placed material: 

 porosity is important because it determines the void space available for binder crystals 
to grow - the smaller the voids the smaller the binding crystals and the weaker the bond 

between tailings particles and binder, hence the smaller the benefits and the greater the 

operational risks; and 

 permeability is important because that determines the ability of the placed material to 
discharge excess water through its mass - if excess water remains in the tailings mass 

either

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

o the binder never sets (rendering the placed mass a wet slurry at worst or a wet paste 
at best), or 

o weak crystal growth of the binder occurs, resulting in weak bonding of the placed 
material that can be prone to deterioration through the further addition of surface 

water.  

By definition, particle size distributions hence tailings porosity and permeability vary with 

grind size, which in turn is determined by the non-linear relationship between the cost of 

milling/grinding and the metallurgical recovery of a target metal or metals.  Grind sizes are 

comparatively coarse for massive sulphide-style mineralization where the addition of 

binders in the tailings mix, prior to dry stack placement, can make operational sense.  

However, to ensure adequate liberation of a target metal or metals, grind sizes can be much 

finer in the case of porphyry Cu-Au style mineralization.  The Spectrum-GJ project is no 

exception to this, for which a grind size of 120 microns (or 0.12 mm) has been determined 

as optimal (see Section 13). 

Similar constraints to those outlined for wet climates (i.e. where persistent net positive 

precipitation to evaporation balances exist) equally apply in cold weather climates.  For 

example, where snowfall occurs or ice accumulates, either or both would have to be 

removed and treated (to preclude tailings contamination into the general environment) 

before further tailings could be added to the pile.  Moreover, during especially cold 

weather, material can freeze prior to placement with the result that compaction efficiency 

is reduced and the contained water is released as the placed material warms up (with the 

result that sludge is created to the detriment of equipment efficiencies, etc.).  This is not 

necessarily a problem if the TSF footprint was significantly larger than the routine 

operational requirement, in which case a compartmentalized approach to dry stack tailings 

disposal might be both a feasible and sustainable option.  

In areas where an inundation potential exists (i.e. where periodic, significant rainfall events 

occur, such as in the Project Area) water run-off and associated scouring of the placed fill 

can occur, with the consequence that tailings can be introduced to general environment.  

Risk could be mitigated if a dam, polishing pond (and ultimately a spillway) and water 

treatment plant were constructed to control water movement and to mitigate discharge 

hazards.  However, it may readily be seen that such design requirements, for what may be 

termed a notional dry stack facility, would not differ from those typically associated with 

a conventional wet facility at the same location, which renders the objective of attempting 

to construct and maintain a dry stack facility questionable at best.  This finding is further 

supported by the potential impacts of the type of significant wind storms that are known to 

occur in the general Project Area: if, for whatever reason, a dry stack facility could be 

designed, built, operated and sustainably maintained, fine tailings would persistently be 

transported by the wind to the general environment.  This risk is substantially reduced when 

conventional wet stack TSFs are operated. 

18.7.4 Conclusions 

In the opinion of the Principal Author, operating and sustaining a dry stack facility is 

neither feasible nor practicable in cold, wet climates, unless the footprint of the TSF was 

sufficiently large to allow a compartmentalized approach to tailings placement and 

compaction.  A compartmental approach would not, however, be sustainable if a persistent

net positive precipitation to evaporation balance was anticipated or existed, and/or if there 

existed a TSF inundation risk during significant precipitation events. 

A dry stack facility may mitigate the risks associated with a dam.  However additional risks 

are introduced, specifically the need for measures to control wind and water erosion of the 

stacks in the long-term.  In addition, dry stack would introduce additional risk associated 

with the PAG tailings of the first five years of operation and the PAG pyrite tailings from 

the remainder of the mine life.  In summary, the significant extra cost of dry stack appears 

to offer little benefit to the Project and it is not, therefore, the preferred strategy for tailings 

management. 

18.7.5 Risk and Opportunity Analysis 

To support the conclusions outlined, the risks and advantages of conventional wet and dry 

stack facilities were considered and condensed into four main areas: geography and 

capacity; design parameters; sulphide/pyrite concentrate disposal and acid water outflow 

potential; and operational constraints.  The results are summarized on Table 18.7 that 

considers risks and opportunities within the context of the climate found across the Project 

Area (as described in Section 5.4).  Table 18.7 is in two parts due to its overall length.

Operational Considerations 

Wet Weather Impact(s) 

Rainfall accumulation on placed material 

inevitable.  No significant impact identified, 

if best practice design standards adhered to. 

Rainfall accumulation on placed material 

inevitable, resulting in its progressive saturation, 

hence potentially significant operational 

constraints (equipment access and efficiencies) 

and scouring of placed material (creating 

environmental issue if water run-off discharges 

to the general environment). 

Although rainfall impacts likely short-term 

during and after each event, they represent a 

potentially significant production constrain 

because the plant would probably have to be shut 

down during and immediately after each event, 

thereby resulting in significant cost implications 

(loss of product in cashflow pipeline + 

significant fixed plant operating costs).  Potential 

for surface water run-off also means that a 

tailings impoundment would be required with 

water run-off by-pass/spillway and 

catchment/polishing pond system required for 

long-term environmental control (i.e. the same 

design criteria as for a conventional wet facility 

would apply) 

Dry Weather Impact(s) 
No significant impact identified, if best 

practice design standards adhered to. 

Potentially uncontrollable dust issues, especially 

during periods of high winds. 

Cold Weather Impact(s) 

Frozen pipelines a potential operational 

constraint, unless pipelines appropriately 

designed.  Snow and/or ice cover would not 

impact operation and use of the planned 

facility.  

Material could freeze before it is compacted; 

compaction could be limited to 60% of 

terminal/final compaction under dry conditions.  

Water would be released as the placed material 

warmed up, creating sludge at best that could not 

be compacted until sufficiently dried (which is 

unlikely due to the expected persistent net 

positive precipitation to evaporation balance. 

Indirect, potential operational constrain relating 

to snow and/or ice cover (equipment access and 

efficiencies), unless snow and/or ice routinely 

removed (same cashflow and operating cost 

constraints apply as for Wet Weather Impact[s]). 

Snow and/or ice melt could contribute to 

progressive degradation of placed material, 

thereby turning a portion into slurry and 

resulting in same operational constraints as for 

Wet Weather Impact(s).  Any snow and/or ice 

would therefore have to be routinely removed.  

The removed material would have to be treated 

to remove any contained/attached tailings.  

Additional capital and operating expenditures.

18.7.  Text highlighted in: 

 GREEN reflects either a positive outcome or the better option; 

 ORANGE reflects either a standard design requirement or an outcome that is

 RED reflects a design requirement that results in a significant increase in capital 

expenditure requirements, without any additional benefits, or an operational 

consideration that could not safely and sustainably be managed using a conventional 

facility type (additional, non-standard design elements would be required). 

It may clearly be seen that for the climatic conditions that prevail across the Project Area, 

a conventional wet TSF is a far better / lower risk option than a dry stack facility, the design 

requirements for which would be similar if not the same as for a conventional wet facility.

18.8 Spectrum Infrastructure Area 

The planned infrastructure located on the Spectrum claims block is limited to production-related 

activities only.  As such, it includes: 

 temporary site offices for production personnel and technical support (modular office trailers); 

 a first aid station and medivac facility; 

 communications linked to the MIA system; 

 a small maintenance shop and warehouse; 

 explosives handling and storage facility, located in safe area, with a capacity allowance of 
0.00883 m3 per kg/day of ANFO; 

 a small diesel power generating facility for the mine-site offices, maintenance shop and 
warehouse; 

 a fuel supply, storage and distribution facility (including a small tank farm); and 

 a sewerage disposal facility. 

As previously noted, personnel will be bussed to/from the SIA and MIA, as appropriate.  The mine 

dry will be located at the MIA and all major maintenance will be carried out at the MIA.  Planning 

encompasses the use of: two 40 t articulated trucks (owner operated) to haul waste to the disposal 

site; and B-Train trucks (contractor operated) hauling ROM material from the bottom of the 

planned muckpass system to the central plant located at the MIA.  The SIA has been located to 

preclude adverse interactions between personnel vehicles (pick-up trucks and busses) and the 

trucks outlined.  No production equipment will be either located or active in the SIA, other than 

for reasons of maintenance. 

18.9 Access Roads 

Willow Creek Road forms the first element of the planned main access road to the planned TSF, 

the planned location of the MIA and ultimately the SIA.  In the opinion of the Co-Authors, there 

is no practicable alternative to using Willow Creek Road, by virtue of the proximity of Mount 

Edziza Provincial Park and the generally mountainous terrain to the north, east and west of the 

Project Area. 

The planned access road does not include the winter trail that extends north from the end of Willow 

Creek Road (see Section 5.3), because its alignment: 

 includes numerous sharp corners and undulations that are inconsistent with safe road useage 
(locally significant earthworks would be required to achieve a safe and practicable alignment); 

 includes a section that is very close to the Project Area boundary that it eventually crosses to 
thereby extend into the Mount Edziza Provincial Park; and 

 extends under the planned position of the TSF. 

The overall alignment of the planned main access road to the MIA (located per Option B) and SIA 

is detailed on Figure 18.1.  The Company acknowledges that modifications to the planned

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

alignment might be required, depending on the outcomes of AIAs and whether or not SAPs can be 

secured and known sites mitigated under Section 12 of the Heritage Conservation Act. 

The majority of the planned road is located on claims that are 100% owned by the Company – the 

only exception is that portion of the road leading to the SIA that extends over the Designated 

Access Corridor described in Section 4.9.  Radio-controlled access will at all times be employed, 

with security checks made at a Security Gatehouse located close to the turnoff of Willow Creek 

Road from Highway 37 (although Willow Creek Road is a public facility, as designated principal 

user the Company would seek the appropriate permit and thereby exercise its rights to control 

access to the road, for reasons of safety.  To this end, it is anticipated that all vehicles intending to 

use the road would have to have an operable VHF radio, a buggy whip and an amber strobe light 

before access would be allowed). 

18.9.1 MIA Access Road 

Figure 18.9 details the planned alignment of the MIA access road.  The largest vehicle 

using the road in the long-term will be covered B-Train surface haul trucks hauling bulk 

Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate to the bulk terminal at the deep water Port of Stewart, B.C. (a 

distance of approximately 262 km by road, from the Highway 37 turnoff to Willow Creek 

Road).  It is established in Section 5.3 that the GVWs of loaded B-Train type road trucks 

will be limited to 45 t, thereby allowing for safety factors approximating to 1.5 for the 

bridges' 68 t GVW ratings (the Iskut and Little Iskut bridges, described in Section 5.3 and 

located at the positions identified on Figure 18.9).  Where possible, planning encompasses 

the transport of heavy equipment, during the construction phase of project development, in 

lots weighing no more than 45 t, inclusive of the transport vehicle.  If heavier loads are 

required during the construction phase, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure 

regulations will be followed as appropriate and for the individual case.  For example and 

as minimum, when total weights greater than 45 t are moved across the existing bridges, a 

suitably qualified and certificated supervising engineer will be present at all times.  The 

bridges will also be strengthened with stiffening plates and/or bracing, in accordance with 

the requirements or recommendations of the transportation contractor and/or supervising 

engineer. 

Willow Creek Road Portion 

The first 23.5 km of the planned MIA access road follows the existing Willow Creek Road 

to the Company's existing staging post.  The existing, 4.0 m wide road will have to be 

widened to 6 m and have passing cut-outs every kilometre to allow for safe and sustainable 

operating conditions.  Widening the existing road will require minor tree cutting and brush 

clearing, ditch cleaning, surface grading and the upgrading of existing culverts that will be 

of the fish-bearing type.   

Willow Creek Road has regularly been used by Company personnel and has been travelled 

by the Co-Authors.  No challenging topography exists and no particular issues are 

anticipated as regards road construction.  However, the two existing bridges will have to 

be upgraded, as will the existing culverts, to safely accept fully loaded B-Train surface 

trucks.

Bridge Replacements 

It is established in Section 5.3 that, according to the 2014 government bridge surveys, the 

Iskut River Bridge will need to be replaced in 2034 and the Little Iskut River Bridge will 

need to be replaced in 2040.  For purposes of cashflow modelling, these dates have been 

assumed to arise in Project Years 10 and 16. 

New Road Alignment 

A new road alignment will be required to access the MIA from the Company's existing 

staging post at the end of Willow Creek Road.  A new alignment was selected in preference 

to upgrading the existing winter trail because: 

 the MIA access road needs to skirt the planned TSF, to the east (the winter trail extends 
along the centre of the planned TSF and there is no viable alternative to the west of the 

TSF, due to the topography); 

 the winter trail alignment is too convoluted to allow for safe and sustainable use by 
road haul trucks, without extensive earthworks; and 

 the winter trail is currently (March 2017) a largely overgrown, narrow (2.0 m) and 
poorly maintained track (see Section 5.3). 

The new road alignment from the end of Willow Creek Road to the MIA totals 

approximately 12.5 km.  In common with an enlarged Willow Creek Road, it will comprise 

a 6 m wide graded dirt road with passing cut-outs every one kilometre and fish-bearing 

culverts, as required.  The planned alignment was estimated using LiDARTM to define the 

least risk alignment (i.e. the alignment that avoided adverse topography and limited the 

number of corners to a practicable minimum).  The maximum gradient along the planned 

alignment is 8.5%; the majority is either flat or has gradients of less than 5%.  In the opinion 

of the Co-Authors, the planned alignment presents the least risk layout, both from 

environmental and operational perspectives.  No viable alternative to the alignment 

summarized on Figure 18.9 could be found, due to the mountainous nature of the 

surrounding topography and the proximity of Mount Edziza Provincial Park. 

It is recommended that the planned alignment of the MIA access road is ground-truthed 

and robustly engineered at the feasibility stage of project development.  For purposes of 

the PEA, it has been estimated that: 

 the road structure will comprise 1,300 mm of engineered NAG fill and a top layer of 
minus 19 mm NAG crush; and 

 the planned road alignment will require groundworks comprising 60% with no rock 
and 40% with moderate rock that might require limited blasting. 

18.9.2 SIA Access Road 

Figure 18.10 identifies the planned alignment of the access road to/from the MIA and SIA.  

The Company acknowledges that the access road footprint will of necessity be larger than 

in theory might be possible because it does not incorporate the existing winter trail, for the 

reasons earlier described.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

In the opinion of the Co-Authors, the planned alignment of the SIA access road presents 

the least risk layout, both from environmental and operational perspectives.  No viable 

alternative to the planned alignment could be found, due to the mountainous nature of the 

surrounding topography and the proximity of Mount Edziza Provincial Park. 

It is acknowledged modifications to the planned alignment might be required, depending 

on the outcomes of AIAs.  The Company acknowledges that AIAs will be required before 

infrastructure planning can be finalized.  If a SAP for an identified heritage/archaeological 

site could not be secured then the planned alignment might have to be modified.   

Road Use 

Current planning assumes that SIA to MIA access road will primarily be used by B-Train 

road trucks hauling ROM material from the bottom of the planned muck handling system, 

to a concrete lay-down pad located at the MIA.  The only other vehicles that will use the 

SIA access road will be busses at the start and end of individual shifts, occasional pick-up 

trucks for senior personnel and emergency vehicles, if required.  Radio-controlled access 

will at all times be employed. 

According to the Spectrum Pit production plan presented in Section 16, the maximum 

quantity of ROM material that will require hauling to the MIA over a full production year 

is 1.825 Mt.  This equates to approximately 5,000 tpd requiring approximately 120 round 

trips per day, over a 20 hour period (i.e. two 12 hour shifts, less change over and meal 

break times), hence six round trips by B-Train haul trucks an hour. 

Planned Alignment 

The planned alignment was determined using the same methodology as outlined for the 

new section of the MIA access road (i.e. the portion that extends to the MIA, from the end 

of Willow Creek Road).  It comprises an approximately 11 km long, 8.0 m wide, graded 

dirt road with passing cut-outs every 1.0 km, fish-bearing culverts as required, and a 

maximum gradient of 10%. 

It should be emphasized that planning for the SIA access road might in future change: 

depending on the results of the recommended trade-off studies described in Section 16, 

production planning for Spectrum Pit might include a longer pit life and an increased 

production rate.  For these reasons, and as stated in Sub-Section 4.9.3, an easement totaling 

at least 25 m either side of the planned access road alignment will be required for reasons 

of safety and to facilitate the location and construction of any future infrastructure that 

might include, but might not be limited to: 

 a covered, overland conveyor to transport ROM production material from the SIA to 
the MIA, for processing at the central plant facility; and 

 a powerline to supply electricity to the SIA. 

In common with the new road alignment to the MIA, it is recommended that the planned 

alignment of the SIA is ground-truthed and robustly engineered at the feasibility stage of 

project development.  For purposes of the PEA, it has been estimated that: 

 the road structure will comprise 1,300 mm of engineered NAG fill and a top layer of 
minus 19 mm NAG crush; and

 the planned road alignment will require groundworks comprising 40% with no rock, 
30% with moderate rock and 30% with significant rock that would require blasting. 

Designated Access Corridor 

The new road alignment along the southern portion of the Designated Access Corridor was 

selected following observations made by the Co-Authors during their site visits, as well as 

by Company personnel who walked the proposed route at the end of the 2016 exploration 

season.  The selected alignment over the Designated Access Corridor: 

 extends over a modest topographic high that elevates the land above the otherwise 
marshy area to the north (Figure 18.11); 

 allows the two required, new bridges to span the creeks/streams at points where the 
topography and prevailing geology are favourable for robust bridge construction; and 

 maximizes vehicle screening/limits equipment visibility, by virtue of the presence of 
the fairly dense tree growth. 

Figure 18.11 A General View of the Designated Access Corridor (looking due east), 

Spectrum-GJ Project Area

Provisional and preliminary planning suggests that the two new bridges will require deck 

widths of 4.3 m and have spans of approximately 55 m.  Due to the planned, short duration 

of production from Spectrum Pit, bridge replacements have not been considered within the 

scope of cashflow modelling but, in common with rehabilitation of the SIA access road, 

their removal at the end of the mine life has planned (see Section 20.11).

18.9.3 Pits' Access Roads 

An 6.0 m wide road is planned to access the Spectrum Pit, based on the use of 40 t 

articulated trucks.  A 15.0 m wide road is planned to access the Donnelly Pit, based on the 

use of 100 t rigid frame trucks (from Year 12).  Regular passing cut-outs will be developed 

and a maximum gradient of 10% has been applied, based on world best practice for the 

types of trucks outlined.  Construction of the access roads will follow the same principles 

as described for the new road alignments to the MIA and SIA. 

Donnelly Pit 

The access road to Donnelly Pit (see Figure 18.9) is fairly straightforward and, in the 

opinion of the Co-Authors, it does not present difficulties or limitations in terms of 

equipment and fleet access to the pit area.  As such, it could readily be used as a back-up 

haul route in the event that the Donnelly Pit primary crusher goes down. 

Spectrum Pit 

Topographic challenges in the area of Spectrum Pit mean that the pit access road includes 

switch-backs that limit the size of production equipment that could readily be moved up 

the planned road (see Figure 18.10).  This in turn limits the potential production rate from 

Spectrum Pit that, for the reasons described in Section 16, should be optimized at the 

feasibility stage of project development. 

Within the scope of the PEA, access to Spectrum Pit is limited to a point mid-pit.  The 

potential for a larger/higher overall tonnage pit exists, but this was not considered within 

the scope of PEA planning for the technical and operational reasons described in Section 

16.  The operational reasons include access to the top of the local mountain from where 

waste stripping would take place to enable a larger tonnage pit to be mined. 

Access to the local mountain top is problematic, in that it includes a section along a steep 

and deep ravine, as well as sections along known avalanche channels and areas of 

potentially unstable scree identified within the scope of the geohazards study described in 

Section 16.3.  These risks require examination and mitigation before an access road to the 

local mountain top could realistically and confidently be planned. 

It is for the reasons outlined that the potentially significant benefit of sustained production 

from an enlarged Spectrum Pit was not included within the scope of the PEA.  Production 

from Spectrum Pit is instead limited to what can practicably, safely and sustainably be 

realized by means of mid-pit access only, as required by virtue of the project planning 

criteria stated in Section 18.1 (to engineer solutions that encompass safety considerations 

and consider practical, physical and operational constraints, thereby to ensure practicably 

achievable and sustainable outcomes).  The studies required to enable low risk, sustainable 

enlargements to the Spectrum Pit are recommended for completion at the feasibility stage 

of project development. 

18.9.4 Powerline Access and Maintenance 

Access for maintenance of the planned mains powerline, which extends to the MIA from 

the main take-off sub-station adjacent to Highway 37, will be from the planned MIA access 

road.

18.9.5 By-Pass Ditches' Access 

Access for maintenance of the planned surface water by-pass ditch to the east of the TSF 

will be from the MIA access road.  Access to the planned surface water by-pass ditch to 

the west of the TSF will be by means of the 3 m benches identified in Section 18.4. 

18.9.6 Road Maintenance 

The main access road for the Project Area, from the turnoff of Willow Creek Road from 

Highway 37 to the MIA and on to the SIA, will be operated and maintained by the 

Company.  Maintenance equipment and equipment operators have been included in the 

equipment and personnel estimates.  Preliminary estimates of road maintenance costs 

during winter and summer months were compiled, inclusive of: damping during dry 

periods (for dust control); snow removal during winter months, periodic grading and spot 

ballast repair. 

Maintenance of Highway 37 is funded by the B.C. Provincial government; local contractors 

undertake proactive and effective year-round road maintenance.  To the best knowledge 

and understanding of the Principal Author, the longest period of road closure to date 

(March 2017) has been approximately 100 hours, for reasons of avalanche control. 

18.10 Power Supply and Distribution 

PEA project planning encompassed the construction of a new take-off substation from the 

Northwest Transmission Line and a project-dedicated, 138 kV, 33 km long powerline to the MIA.  

Two potential routes were considered during the planning process: the planned route summarized 

on Figure 18.9; and a route extending from the existing Red Chris sub-station located adjacent to 

the Red Chris Mine turnoff from Highway 37, some 13.5 km southwest of Iskut.  The former 

option was selected because: 

 the required infrastructure is located entirely on claims that are 100% owned by the Company, 
including the planned lay-down area adjacent to Highway 37 that is noted in Section 4.3 (the 

alternative route required the crossing of wetland areas and a lake to the east of the Project 

Area); 

 the planned route precludes the need for any component of the planned infrastructure to cross 
Highway 37 (the location of the planned take-off sub-station is at one of the few places where 

the existing Northwest Transmission Line is to the west of Highway 37 [see Figure 18.9]); 

 the planned route best protects the project-dedicated powerline from the potential impacts of 
adverse weather (the alternative route would expose a powerline to periodically severe winds 

of the type noted in Section 5.4, as well as to rime icing of the type that hampered the efficiency 

of the automated meteorological station installed and operated on Klastline Plateau between 

June 2005 and September 2008 [see Section 5.4 and RTEC, 2011a]); 

 line construction will be fairly straightforward, in that no adverse topography exists along the 
planned route (which is in marked contrast to the alternative route, which requires line 

construction up to and across Klastline Plateau);

 access to the planned powerline, for construction, maintenance and other work, may readily be 
realized from the MIA access road (except for the first few kilometres, the planned powerline 

route parallels the planned MIA access road, thereby meeting the requirements of minimal 

footprint for the project as a whole, which would not be the case for the alternative route, which 

would require the development of extensive, additional access roads); and 

 due to the prevailing topography to the east and west of the planned route, visibility risk is at 
a practicable minimum – the only components that will be seen will be the planned take-off 

sub-station and first few powerline masts (both from Highway 37, in the immediate vicinity of 

the Willow Creek turnoff). 

Specifics of the site electrical sub-station and distribution system were not planned as part of the 

PEA.  Capital costs estimates only were compiled from reasonable estimates of infrastructure and 

distribution requirements.  The planned line capacity is sufficient to meet the estimated power 

demand at the MIA, plus the Donnelly Pit primary crusher located underground, at the base of the 

planned Donnelly muck handling system.   

The Company acknowledges that periodic Northwest Transmission Line power outages are 

reported to occur (personal communication to the Principal Author).  A 1.3MW diesel-powered 

emergency generator and distribution facility will be installed near the process building to provide 

emergency power, via an automatic transfer switch, for critical heating, lighting, fire protection 

and process loads.  Power at the SIA will be provided by a small diesel generation facility located 

at the SIA, from which power to light and heat the planned offices facilities, warehouse and 

maintenance facility will be provided. 

18.11 Services and Utilities 

The following reasonable assumptions were made within the scope of the PEA: 

 fresh water can readily be sourced from within the Project Area (see Section 5.5); 

 a water reclaim barge will operate in the TSF pond at the southern end of the impoundment, 
from where water will be pumped back to the processing plant for re-use; and 

 excess water contained within the TSF will be pumped to a water treatment plant, via a 
polishing pond and prior to release to the general environment. 

Beyond application of the assumptions outlined, details of fresh water, fire water, potable water, 

process water and sewerage treatment have not been planned as part of the PEA.  Capital costs 

estimates only were compiled from reasonable estimates of infrastructure, distribution and 

consumption requirements. 

As earlier stated (Section 18.3), a systems control and communications with a broadband satellite-

based communication system and an office Management Information System (MIS) Network will 

be installed at the MIA, to which the communications system located at the SIA will be linked.  It 

is anticipated that diesel fuel for mine production and maintenance vehicles will arrive by fuel 

contractor road tanker from supply depots in Terrace or Smithers.  Average annual diesel 

consumption is estimated at approximately 14 million litres a year.  This corresponds to 

approximately seven road tankers per week, each with 40,000 L capacity (hence a GVW 

approximating to the 45 t limit for the Iskut and Little Iskut bridges).  Details of the fuel storage

facility and distribution system have not been planned as part of the PEA.  Capital costs estimates 

only were compiled. 

18.12 Camp Facility 

A single, central and permanent camp facility will be located at the MIA.   The camp will initially 

be built to accommodate contractor and other personnel during the construction phase of project 

development.  Camp capacity has been defined from consideration of the estimated personnel 

compliments at site at any time over the planned mine life, to which a capacity contingency of 5% 

has been applied.  The Stage 1 camp (for production and processing throughput of 10,000 tpd) will 

be expanded prior to the start of Stage 2 (20,000 tpd production and processing throughput), at 

which stage camp capacity will be sufficient for the remaining mine life.  Spectrum Pit personnel 

will be bussed to/from the MIA, as required and at the start and end of each shift. 

18.13 Mine Infrastructure 

Mine infrastructure for handling muck from the Donnelly Pit area to the MIA and from the 

Spectrum Pit area to the SIA are described in Section 16.  

18.14 Concentrate Handling 

As earlier noted, bulk Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrates will be hauled by B-Train surface trucks along the 

MIA access road and then to the bulk terminal at the deep water Port of Stewart (an overall distance 

from the MIA of approximately 296 km).  It is anticipated that individual trucks will carry loads 

of approximately 40 wmt of bulk concentrate (average moisture content = 8%).  This payload limit 

has been assumed to conform to the 68 t GVW capacities of the existing Iskut and Little Iskut 

bridges, at a minimum run-of-operation safety factor of 1.5. 

Trucks will be loaded and weighed inside the concentrate storage building located in the central 

plant facility at the MIA.  At the design mill feed rate of 30,000 tpd, concentrate production will 

average between 180 wmt and 210 wmt per day and will require an average of five or six trucks 

per day to deliver concentrate to the Port of Stewart. 

18.15 Qualified Persons' Opinion 

In the opinion of the Co-Authors, infrastructure planning for purposes of the PEA exceeds the 

minimum requirements of preliminary economic assessments.  Risk-based planning has been 

utilized, with the objective of encompassing the project planning criteria stated in Section 18.1 

(thereby to ensure practicably achievable and sustainable outcomes).  The following conclusions 

are made: 

 the infrastructure planned within the scope of the PEA is sufficient to safely and sustainably 
support the long-term production and processing plans for the project, as detailed in Sections 

16 and 17; 

 in all respects, the minimal footprint requirement has been met by planning consolidated 
facilities and by using, to the extent that is practicable and feasible, existing infrastructure; 

 in all respects, visibility risks have been kept to practicable minimums; 

 with the exceptions of elements of the planned road access and powerline for which no 
practicable alternatives exist, the planned infrastructure is located within a single watershed 

(the Stikine river system);

 planning has encompassed wildlife considerations by limiting potential interactions to 
practicable minimums, especially on Klastline Plateau that is a known to contain important 

wildlife populations; 

 to the extent that is possible, heritage/archaeology has been encompassed within the scope of 
infrastructure planning, in which regard the Company acknowledges that AIAs are required 

and that adjustments to the planned infrastructure might be required unless SAPs can be 

secured and known sites can be mitigated under Section 12 of the Heritage Conservation Act; 

and 

 to the extent that is possible at this early stage of project development, applicable 
environmental laws have been considered and planning has encompassed considerations of 

zero contamination discharge to the environment. 

In addition to the AIA's noted above, biodiversity and other environmental surveys and studies 

are required before infrastructure planning can be finalized – the required studies are discussed 

and described in Section 20.  Geotechnical studies will be required; earthworks requirements and 

quantities will need to be estimated and optimized during feasibility-level studies.  

All major infrastructure will be located at the central MIA, inclusive of a camp facility and 

processing plant.  The MIA has been located using a risk and opportunity approach to options 

analysis.  Infrastructure at the SIA is limited to production-related requirements only. 

A new, project-dedicated 138 kV transmission line will be constructed to supply the power demand 

at the proposed MIA and for the Donnelly primary crusher.  Although it is anticipated that planned 

facilities will have sufficient capacity to service the power demand for mining and process 

equipment throughout the life of the mine facility, power consumption rates should be reviewed 

and details of the power distribution system should be engineered at the feasibility stage of project 

development. 

Process tailings will be stored in a single, consolidated, life-of-mine facility with an estimated 

maximum capacity of 375 Mt ± 35 Mt, although storage for only some 210 Mt is required for the 

current mine plan.  The planned TSF includes water diversion ditches and a polishing pond 

(constructed prior to production), and a spillway (constructed during Year 20 when the ultimate 

dam height will be reached).  Excess water contained within the TSF will be pumped to a water 

treatment plant, via the polishing pond, for processing prior to release to the general environment.  

Detailed designs of and for the dam will be required before the planned TSF can be finalized.  

A diesel storage and pumping facility will be located at the MIA.  Diesel will be delivered to the 

facility by trucks, and then pumped to fuel storage tanks from where it will be distributed as 

required.  Freshwater will be provided from wells; process water will mostly comprise recycled 

water pumped from the planned TSF to dedicated holding tanks for distribution to the processing 

plant.  Detailed engineering of the storage and distribution systems will be required at the 

feasibility level of project development.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

The Principal Author is responsible for this section of this Technical Report.  Table 19.1 

summarizes the ranges of metal prices, exchange rates and discount rates applied within the scope 

of the PEA.  The base case prices and rates are highlighted in bold.  The various prices and rates 

were compiled from information contained in a consultancy report by XFRM Canada of New 

Westminster, B.C. (Wood, 2017), in which data up to and including March 30, 2017 was 

considered in analysis. 

Table 19.1 A Summary of the Ranges and Base Case (long-term) Metal Prices, Exchange Rates 

and Discount Rates Applied Within the Scope of the PEA, Spectrum-GJ Project 
(compiled from information contained in a consultancy report to the Company [Wood, 2017]) 

 

 

The base case prices and/or rates summarized on Table 19.1 were applied within the scope of: 

 openpit optimization for constraining the Mineral Resources considered in Section 14; 

 minimum grade cut-off analysis for purposes of Mineral Resource estimation, per the results 
presented in Section 14; 

 mine planning and production scheduling, using an NSR hence variable grade cut-off approach 
(inclusive of the smelter and refining terms and factors stated in Section 19.3), per the 

discussions of Section 16; and 

 cashflow modelling and analysis, per the discussions of Section 22. 

The ranges of prices and rates summarized on Table 19.1 also formed the basis for the sensitivity 

analyses described in Section 22. 

19.1 Metal Prices 

19.1.1 Gold 

Wood (2017) assessed the likely range of long-term gold prices, primarily through 

consideration of six factors: US Federal Reserve monetary policy (principally interest rates 

and the indication of them changing or not); economic data (jobs reports, wage data, 

manufacturing data, GDP growth, etc.); supply and demand (growing demand and 

constrained supply have been a major factor in recent price increases); inflation; currency 

movements and uncertainty.  Wood concluded that as at March 30, 2017, US$1,250 would 

be a reasonable long-term gold price for use in the PEA, along with a price range of 

US$1,150 to US$1,350 / oz.

19.1.2 Silver 

Wood (2017) states the following in his consultancy report to the Company: 'The two-fold 

function of silver means that it is influenced to some extent by the same factors as is gold 

but, at the same time, it is considered to be an industrial metal.  Apart from its uses in 

jewellery, medicine and electronics, the strong demand for solar panels is set to maintain 

upward pressure on silver.  Persistent supply hurdles will likely exacerbate this in the 

medium term.  Major analyst prices range from US$15.10/oz to US$20.75/oz with an 

average of US$17.77/oz.  For the purposes of this study, it is recommended that a base 

price of US$17.75/oz be used'. 

19.1.3 Copper 

Wood (2017) states the following in his consultancy report to the Company: 'Copper, being 

an industrial metal, waxes and wanes with general economic perceptions.  Over the short 

term to medium term, prices are expected to remain subdued and may possibly drop below 

US$2.00/lb.  However, dwindling reserves, falling grades and the very long lead time 

required to bring significant greenfield properties on stream imply recovery of prices over 

the longer term.  Major analysts forecast an average price of US$2.75/lb for 2017.  

Significant volatility is expected over the coming years but the same figure is considered 

to be a good one for the long-term price of copper'. 

19.2 Exchange Rates 

Wood (2017) states the following in his consultancy report to the Company: 'Over the last five 

years, the US$/C$ exchange rate has ranged from 0.69 to 1.03 with an average of 0.86.  Currently 

(February 2017) around 0.74, there is a general sense that the Canadian economy fares well when 

its currency is trading around 0.75 US$/C$.  It is recommended that this figure be used as the base 

case exchange rate and the rate be varied from 0.73 level up to 0.81'. 

19.3 Discount Rates 

A financial discount rate represents a combination of the cost of capital, opportunity cost and a 

factor for perceived risk.  In these regards Wood (2017) states the following in his consultancy 

report to the Company: 'Recently, there has been a tendency for mining projects to use particularly 

low discount rates that focus only on the currently low cost of capital and largely ignore the risk 

factor.  Mining projects inherently have a degree of risk, particularly in the case of multi-metal 

mines with the presence of potential penalty metals.  It is recommended that the base case discount 

rate should be no lower than 8% for this project, however, this can be varied from 6% to 12% or 

wider, if so desired'.  

19.4 Product Sales and Terms 

The final products generated at the Spectrum-GJ plant will be a Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate in Stage 

1 through Stage 3, a gold-rich gravity concentrate in Stage 1 and Au-Ag doré during Stages 2 and 

3.  The expected average copper grade of the Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate is 22% Cu throughout the 

planned project life (see Section 13). 

No contracts or arrangements for the smelting, refining and/or sale of the Spectrum-GJ products 

are in place and none have been sought for purposes of the PEA.  The following assumptions have 

instead been applied:

 the gold-rich gravity concentrate and Au-Ag doré will probably be transported to a North 
American-based precious metals refinery, with the refined product sold to precious metals 

traders; and 

 100% of the Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate will be transported by B-Train truck from the Spectrum-
GJ plant to the bulk container facility at Port of Stewart, B.C. for onward shipment to the Far 

East. 

The smelter terms summarized on Table 19.2 have been assumed for purposes of the PEA.  The 

copper pay factor is based on the assumption that the copper unit deduction will be 1%.

19.5 Contracts 

No contracts or arrangements have been sought or are in place as regards mining, concentrating, 

transportation, handling, sales, hedging or forward sales.  For purposes of the PEA, it has instead 

been assumed that the planned openpits and processing plant will be almost exclusively owner-

operated – the exceptions, for which contracts will be let, are: 

 hauling ROM material from the Spectrum Pit site to the central processing facility (a distance 
of approximately 11 km, at a unit cost of C$3.0/t of ROM material); and 

 hauling, by B-Train trucks, the Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate to the bulk handling facility at Port 
Stewart, B.C. 

Table 19.3 summarizes the assumed concentrate haulage costs, port charges and ocean freight rates 

that were applied within the scope of the PEA.  The basis for the unit rates is in an analysis, by the 

Principal Author, of data contained in recent, public domain documents and reports for operations 

of a similar type and size to the Spectrum-GJ project.

19.6 Qualified Person's Opinion 

The Principal Author has reviewed the estimates and assumptions presented above, as well as the 

supporting studies and analyses.  In the Principal Author's opinion, the following conclusions may 

be drawn: 

 the applied metal prices, exchange rates and discount rates are reasonable and fair for the 
market conditions at the effective date of this Technical Report (April 20, 2017); 

 the expected average grades of the Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate will make it attractive to most 
smelters; 

 based on the currently available and limited, multi-element analyses of concentrates, the Cu-
Au-(Ag) concentrate is not expected to contain any deleterious elements to which deductions 

might apply; 

 the Spectrum-GJ project, as envisaged in the PEA, is of a small to medium size and it will not 
have a significant impact on the global market; and 

 geographically, the most economic markets for Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate are 
probably China, Japan and Korea (India and Europe are comparatively longer shipping 

destinations and are therefore more expensive); however 

 the likely long lead-time to production start-up could mean that the Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate 
might be marketed under conditions that differ from the assumptions and forecasts that support 

the PEA. 

The Principal Author recommends that, at the feasibility stage of project development and in order 

to both support more detailed project studies and ensure stable and reliable sales: 

 that expressions of interest or letters of intent supported by cost estimates from haulage 
contractors, Port of Stewart and potential shipping lines are sought; 

 more detailed projections of marketing terms are prepared, based on major custom-smelting 
companies in the world that are logistically practical for the delivery of concentrates; and 

 that as a minimum and to support more detailed project studies, expressions of interest or letters 
of intent from smelters are sought.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 

  COMMUNITY IMPACTS 

M. John Brodie, P. Eng. ("QP Brodie") is responsible for this section of this Technical Report.  

The environmental portions were compiled from a consultancy report to the Company by 

Greenwood Environment Inc. of Vancouver, B.C.  The report is entitled 'Spectrum-GJ Project: 

Summary of Environment Studies and Permitting' and it is dated March 17, 2017 (referenced as 

"the Greenwood Report" in Section 2.5). 

20.1 Environmental Studies 

The environmental setting of the biophysical aspects of the Project Area are described in the 

following sub-sections.  The discussions include summaries of the results of baseline studies 

completed by the Company and by previous owners.  Data gaps are identified and study 

requirements defined to support the project through the feasibility study, environmental 

assessment ("EA") and permitting stages of development.  The discussions of future requirements 

have been informed by mining projects in the general region for which environmental studies have 

been completed or environmental programs have been initiated, or for which federal and/or B.C. 

environmental assessment processes have been gone through or are being gone through.  Publically 

available documents for these projects include the following:  

 Ghaffari, H. et al. '2016 KSM (Kerr-Sulphurets-Mitchell) Prefeasibility Study Update and 
Preliminary Economic Assessment', an NI 43-101 technical report prepared for Seabridge 

Gold, Inc. by Tetra Tech and others, dated October 6, 2016 ("Tetra Tech, 2016"); 

 'Application for an Environmental Assessment Certificate / Environmental Impact Statement 
for the KSM Project', prepared for Seabridge Gold, Inc. by Rescan Environmental Services 

Ltd. ("Rescan") and dated July 2013 ("Rescan, 2013"); 

 Gillstrom, G., et al. (February 14, 2012, amended and restated in September 30, 2015)  
'Technical Report on the Red Chris Copper-Gold Project', an NI 43-101 technical report 

prepared by and for Imperial Metals Corporation ("Gillstrom, 2015"); and 

 Red Chris Development Company Ltd. 'Application for an Environmental Assessment 
Certificate Red Chris Project British Columbia, Canada' dated October 2004. 

20.1.1 Climate and Atmospheric Conditions 

Data from nearby climate stations may be used for both background and current data, and 

historical data to 2000 is available from many stations in the general area of the Spectrum-

GJ project.  However, for the reasons described in Section 5.4, local climatic variations 

and even micro-climates exist across the region, with the result that such data might not 

fully or fairly reflect climatic and atmospheric conditions across the Project Area.  Local 

monitoring is instead required. 

An automated meteorological station (the "Kinaskan Station") was operated and 

maintained on Klastline Plateau between June 2005 and September 2008 (RTEC, 2011a).  

A summary of the principal findings is presented in Section 5.4, but this provides only a 

portion of data required for planning purposes.  Additional monitoring of meteorological 

data will be required to support project development and operations, including temperature,

relative humidity, precipitation and snow depth, solar radiation, barometric pressure and 

evaporation. 

It is for the reasons outlined that a formal meteorological monitoring study is recommended 

that, as a minimum, should include year-round collection of site-specific data to ensure a 

robust dataset.  This would enable better characterizations of the range of climatic 

conditions experienced across the Project Area and allow more meaningful comparisons 

of the results with data collected at regional, government-operated meteorology stations. 

20.1.2 Topography and Soils 

No terrain or soil classification mapping or surveys have been conducted on the Project 

Area to date (March 2017).  As part of baseline programs to support and EA and permitting, 

a terrain and soil baseline study will be required and should include, as a minimum, terrain 

distribution and soil quantity and distribution of soil types.  Surface soil sampling will also 

be required.  The following B.C. provincial standards and procedures typically direct 

terrain and soil baseline programs developed to support mine permitting: 

 Guidelines and Standards to Terrain Mapping in British Columbia, developed by the 
Surficial Geology Task Group Earth Sciences Task Force (RISC, 1996); 

 Terrain classification system for British Columbia (Howes and Kenk, 1997); and 

 Canadian System of Soil Classification (SCWG 1998). 

It should be emphasized that geology as well as climate history, local topography and 

vegetation affect the soil landscapes found across the Project Area.  For example, at high 

elevations, three main processes (nivation, solifluction, and cryoturbation) displace and 

mix soil horizons.  The cold climate slows down mineral weathering and organic 

decomposition and this, along with the predominance of volcanic rocks, tend to result in 

coarse-textured, acidic parent materials.  In areas of steep terrain soil development is 

further slowed by mass wasting, or movement, of surficial materials.  In combination, the 

influences outlined typically lead to weak soil development.   

On steep slopes, the most common parent material is colluvial, while on the lower slopes 

morainal parent material is more common.  The anticipated primary soil types include 

regosols and cryosols at the higher elevations, and brunisols and humic podzols at middling 

and low elevations where waterlogged soils are common. 

20.1.3 Geochemistry and Acid Generating Potential 

Property geology is described in Section 7, in which it is established that the mineralized 

zones typically contain sulphides.  Where sulphide minerals such as pyrite are present, 

oxidation can create acid rock drainage ("ARD"), unless sufficient quantities of 

neutralizing minerals are available. 

ARD occurs when materials that contain sulphide minerals oxidize when exposed to 

atmospheric conditions, thereby resulting in acidity.  However, impacts on water quality 

are often more specifically related to the soluble constituents and trace metals that are 

leached as a result of mineralogical reactions on contact with atmospheric conditions.  This 

is commonly referred to as metal leaching ("ML") potential.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

It is stated in Phase Geochemistry (2016) that the practice of predicting the potential for 

ML/ARD is essentially the evaluation of a material's mineralogy, the likely behavior of 

those minerals when processed, stored and exposed to atmospheric conditions and the 

resulting pore water quality (at a range of pH conditions) and secondary mineral 

precipitation. 

Based on a preliminary geochemistry review of the geological descriptions by Phase 

Geochemistry (2016, 2017), minerals that could contribute to acid potential and metal 

leaching include pyrite, pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena. 

Neutralization potential ("NP") could be provided by carbonates and, to a lesser extent, 

due to slower rates of dissolution, by feldspars and other silicates (Phase Geochemistry, 

2016).  Based on preliminary ML/ARD testwork results, Phase Geochemistry (2016) 

concluded that a potential for ML and ARD exists for material extracted from the Central 

Zone and Donnelly Deposit, but this varies according to the following preliminary criteria: 

 regardless of lithology – 

o samples tend to be non-potentially acid generating (non-PAG or "NAG") if 
neutralization potential ("NP") is greater than 20%, 

o samples tend to be PAG if the sulphide content is greater than 2%, and 

o samples with NP values lower than 20% and sulphide contents less than 2% show 
variability; 

 a higher proportion of the samples from the Donnelly Deposit classified as NAG than 
from the Central Zone (which is a reflection of slightly higher NP in the Donnelly 

sample set); 

 due to higher carbonate NP than NP derived from titration for some samples, 
particularly within the Donnelly sample set, some of the carbonate content may not be 

reactive – additional mineralogical quantification is required to more fully assess NP 

values; 

 NP values in many samples are higher than for many porphyry deposits, suggesting 
that there could be a notable time-lag prior to the onset of acidic conditions (quantifying 

the lag time is not yet possible, additional testing and kinetic work is required to assess 

this in more detail); 

 those lithologies that were predominantly NAG included the basalt, conglomerate and 
low sulphide intrusives from the Donnelly Deposit, as well as the ash tuff, 

conglomerate and volcanic wacke from the Central Zone; and 

 both sample sets show elevated contents of some metals that could be problematic for 
metal leaching, even at neutral pH, but this requires additional testing to allow 

conclusions to be more confidently drawn.  

Mineralogical analysis by AuTec of the composites used for metallurgical testing (see 

Section 13) showed that sulphides were in general present in minor to trace amounts only.  

Very minor to negligible pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, sphalerite and galena were found in the 

Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit composites, and:

 chalcopyrite content comprised 0.2% and 0.7% of the two, tested Central Zone 
composites and pyrite contributed a further 4.8% and 11.1%, respectively, whereas 

arsenopyrite (0.8%) was found in only one composite; 

 plagioclase (a feldspar) content comprised 16.2% and 25.5% of the two, tested Central 
Zone composites, with carbonates contributing a further 9.8% and 6.7%, respectively; 

 chalcopyrite content comprised 1.11% and 1.51% in the two, tested Donnelly Deposit 
composites, with pyrite contributing a further 5.57% and 5.59%, respectively (no 

arsenopyrite was found); and 

 overall feldspar content in the two Donnelly Deposit composites comprised 50.95% 
and 43.31%, with carbonates contributing a further 11.8% and 11.4%, respectively. 

It should, however, be emphasized that the tested composites comprised material that 

would be sent to the central plant for processing (as might be expected with metallurgical 

testwork samples).  The mineralogy of below cut-off grade material and waste rock in 

particular can be expected to differ from the results summarized above, especially as 

regards sulphide content.  Whatever the case, in the opinion of QP Brodie, the data 

summarized above are insufficient to support the project through permitting to construction 

and production.  Additional site-specific geochemistry data collection for predictions and 

management of materials with the potential to generate ML/ARD (pit walls, waste rock, 

marginal grade material and tailings, the latter inclusive of the two fractions of 

desulphurized tailings) is therefore required, including the following, as recommended by 

Phase Geochemistry (2016, 2017): 

 additional work on carbonate (and feldspar) mineralogy and reactivity for both the 
Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit; 

 development of a composite sulphide and lithological block model from which the 
timings and quantities of different materials can reasonably be identified within the 

scope of the production schedules for the planned openpits; 

 initiation of kinetic testing (e.g., humidity cells and/or field barrels) on key litho-
alteration units; and 

 further assessment of waste segregation of PAG vs NAG rock, which may include the 
development of site-specific sorting criteria. 

Any plans for the prediction, prevention, mitigation and management of ML and ARD will 

have to be prepared in accordance with the Guidelines for Metal Leaching and Acid Rock 

Drainage at Minesites in British Columbia (Price and Errington, 1998). 

20.1.4 Hydrogeology and Watershed Characterization 

It is established in Section 5.4 that two main watersheds are developed in the general 

Project Area: the Stikine River watershed and the Iskut River watershed.  Figure 20.1 

summarizes the regional drainage patterns.  Figure 5.11, which is not repeated here,

(supplied by Greenwood Environmental and copied from RTEC [2011]) 

 

In May 2005, a hydrologic monitoring program was initiated in the eastern portion of the 

Project Area.  Four automated hydrometric monitoring stations were installed in two creeks 

that flow into Kinaskan Lake and in two creeks that flow into Kakiddi Lake.  Annual 

hydrologic monitoring continued until October 2008.  Limited documentation regarding 

data quality was available for review, and a comparative regional analysis was not carried 

out because the quality of the data for each station was considered to be low (compared to 

provincial hydrometric standards, RISC 2009) and therefore statistically unreliable (RTEC, 

2011b).  The Company is not aware of any hydrologic monitoring on the western portion 

of the Project Area.  

The data outlined are insufficient to support the project through permitting to construction 

and production: environmental assessments require at least one full year of hydrological 

measurements to ensure seasonal coverage, which requirement the available data does not 

meet.  A thorough baseline hydrology monitoring program is therefore recommended that, 

as a minimum, should include year-round data collection from hydrometric stations in all 

streams potentially affected by the proposed mine plan.  Such a program should: 

 characterize and document current streamflow conditions, including the potential for 
channel instabilities and bed load transport processes;  

 provide a means of determining and assessing hydrological changes related to the 
project, for comparison against regional long-term hydrometric data from Water 

Survey of Canada hydrometric stations; and

 prediction of extreme flow events for design of ditches, spillways and water-crossings. 

20.1.5 Surface Water 

Between May 2005 and October 2008, RTEC undertook a limited program of 

environmental baseline surveys that included the collection and analysis of water quality 

data at eight sites within five streams, downstream of the Donnelly deposit (RTEC, 2011c).  

Two of the streams flow east into Kinaskan Lake and are within the Iskut River watershed; 

three of the streams flow west into Kakkidi Lake and are within the Stikine River 

watershed.  The water quality analyses included general physical parameters, anions, 

nutrients, total organic carbon, total metals and dissolved metals.  

In 2015, five additional surface water quality sampling sites were sampled.  The sites 

included key watercourses near the Central Zone.  The program included one site in 

Nuttlude Lake and four stream sites on the western side of Nuttlude Lake.  In April 2016, 

the program was expanded to include four additional sampling sites within the eastern 

portion of the Project Area: one within the Iskut River watershed; and three within the 

Stikine River watershed.  Both the 2005 to 2008 and 2015/2016 water sampling programs 

included QA/QC programs encompassing sampling, handling and shipping procedures, as 

well as the use of laboratory-cleaned water bottles, duplicate samples, travel blanks and 

field blanks. 

RTEC (2011c) reported that in 2005 to 2008, the streams in the eastern portion of the 

Project Area were overall slightly basic, with moderate buffering capacity and with soft to 

very hard water.  All sites reported slightly basic pH values that were within the Canadian 

Council of Ministers of Environment ("CCME") water quality guidelines for the protection 

of aquatic life.  Alkalinity was moderate and was lowest during the summer months, due 

to the dilution from freshet and glacial melt waters.  As may be expected, these events 

resulted in increased total suspended solids ("TSS") concentrations during late spring (May 

and June) at most sites.  The highest TSS and metal concentrations were recorded in 2006 

and the lowest was recorded in 2008.  TSS and total metal concentrations were also found 

to increase from upstream to downstream sites.  Several concentrations were found to 

exceed federal and/or provincial water quality guidelines ("natural exceedances"), 

including total cyanide (which might be erroneous), sulphate, total aluminum, arsenic, 

cadmium, chromium, copper, iron and selenium (RTEC, 2011c). 

Water quality data from 2015 and 2016 sampling sites in the eastern portion of the Project 

Area are similar to the 2005 to 2008 data, with water being slightly basic, with good 

buffering capacity and with hardness ranging from soft to hard.  Although inconsistent 

month to month, natural exceedances included aluminum, copper, iron and zinc, as well as 

(in some samples) cadmium, chromium, lead, selenium and silver.   

Within the western portion of the Project Area, water quality results indicated pH levels 

that are mostly slightly basic, with the exception of one stream (WC-01) that was neutral 

to slightly acidic (in situ pH ranging from 5.2 to 7.4).  Regular natural exceedances 

included fluoride, aluminum, arsenic and copper with variable exceedances of beryllium, 

cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, iron, manganese, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc (this 

includes exceedances of B.C. working water quality guidelines that are not yet 

approved).  The exceedances were variable by stream, but site WC-01 had the most regular 

natural exceedances that, in addition to the preceding list, also included selenium.

Although in many respects detailed, the database of surface water results summarized 

above is insufficient to support the project through permitting to construction and 

production.  The significant number of natural exceedances are emphasized in this regard, 

hence the importance of establishing a comprehensive baseline dataset.  A 

comprehensive/robust surface water quality monitoring program with sample sites located 

throughout the Project Area is, therefore, recommended.  Parameters previously included 

in analysis should be continued.  Various additional parameters should also be included to 

meet current guidelines.  A minimum of monthly sampling with additional weekly 

sampling during periods of maximum hydrograph fluctuation (high flow and low flow) are 

typically required for EAs. 

20.1.6 Groundwater 

Groundwater data collection was initiated by the Company in 2015 when a hydrogeologic 

site investigation was carried out by Knight Piésold (2016a).  Its purpose was to collect 

groundwater data to support the characterization of hydrogeologic conditions along a 

potential adit alignment intended to access underground drilling sites in the Central Zone 

(which is no longer being considered within the scope of the Company's project 

development plans).  The site investigation included packer hydraulic conductivity testing 

and the installation of multi-point vibrating wire piezometers to collect water level data in 

three geotechnical holes.  Comparison of piezometric elevations between the drillholes 

suggests that: 

 groundwater flow is towards the east (i.e. away from the mountain core, as may be 
expected by virtue of pore pressure mechanics in a relative compression environment); 

and 

 water levels generally increase at all piezometers annually between May and June 
(which may also be expected as the timing coincides with Spring freshet). 

The data collected during 2015 and 2016 is for only a small part of the Project Aarea.  It 

can, however, be used to develop an expanded and robust groundwater quality monitoring 

program, to assist with groundwater inflow analysis to the planned openpits and other key 

areas.  One year of quarterly data is typically the minimum requirement for groundwater 

baseline programs to support project permitting and development.  The program should 

include the collection of hydrogeological data through a network of strategically located 

groundwater monitoring wells, including wells within the proximity to the proposed 

openpits, waste rock dumps, marginal grade stockpile, TSF and MIA. 

20.1.7 Fisheries and Aquatic Habitat 

Kakiddi Creek is a tributary of Klastline River, which flows into the Stikine River near 

Telegraph Creek.  It is near the headwaters of the Klastline River and it collects water from 

the western portion of the Project Area.  Kakiddi Lake is fairly large and shallow (mean 

depth of 9.4 m).  It was surveyed in 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1995 and was found to contain 

rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Coho salmon (O. kisutch) and sockeye salmon (O. 

nerka) (DFO Mapster data source as report in RTEC, 2011d).  Sockeye and Coho salmon 

and rainbow trout have been observed at the southern inflow to the lake.  Rainbow trout 

were recorded in several tributaries to the south and west (B.C. MOE data sources: EcoCat, 

Habitat Wizard, FISS).

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

The large Kinaskan Lake is located to the east of the Project Area, at the headwaters of the 

Iskut River watershed.  It has been sampled near the outlet at its southern end; rainbow 

trout were captured (B.C. MOE data sources: EcoCat, Habitat Wizard, FISS).  The upper 

Iskut River watershed is known to also contain mountain whitefish (Prosopium 

williamsoni), longnose sucker (Catostomus catostomus), Arctic grayling (Thymallus 

arcticus) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), which species have not been recorded in 

Kinaskan Lake (B.C. MOE data sources: EcoCat, Habitat Wizard, FISS). 

In 2011, a fisheries baseline study program for the eastern portion of the Project Area was 

undertaken to collect reconnaissance level information on fish habitat and communities in 

streams within the area (RTEC, 2011d).  A total of 13 sites on nine streams were surveyed 

for fish habitat quality, characteristics and fish community composition.  Of these, six sites 

were located in the Kinaskan Lake drainage, two sites were located in the Nuttlude Lake 

drainage and five sites were located in Kakiddi Lake drainage.  In general it was found that 

habitat in the low-lying areas adjacent to the surrounding lakes was of fair to good quality 

for all life stages of rainbow trout; quality decreased at the higher reaches (some habitat 

was still present).  Rainbow trout was the only species captured in the streams during the 

study.  

Two natural barriers to fish passage (waterfalls) were identified during the 2011 field 

assessment, one approximately 3 km upstream of Kinaskan Lake on Groat Creek and one 

on an unnamed tributary approximately 1 km upstream of Kakiddi Lake.  No fish were 

observed upstream of the barriers, but further assessment was recommended to confirm 

fish presence as electro-fishing was not possible at some locations. 

One other fish barrier was identified in the provincial database review, on an unnamed 

tributary to Nido Creek, downstream of the wetland known within the Project Area as 

Beaver Pond.  A number of other barriers are identified in the provincial database on Nido 

Creek further upstream, and they too require confirmatory field assessments. 

Aquatic resource baseline surveys typically include sediment chemistry and determination 

of biological productivity of aquatic systems by characterizing fish habitat and 

communities, as well as assessing benthic invertebrates, zooplankton and phytoplankton. 

The aquatic information collected from the streams in the eastern portion of the Project 

Area will support a portion of the required data and inform the development of a more 

thorough fish baseline program required for Project permitting and an EA.  As a minimum, 

a formal aquatic baseline study should: 

 include fish habitat, population, species surveys, biological productivity and spawning 
assessments on all streams and waterbodies potentially affected by the proposed mine 

plan and development; and 

 reference locations for future baseline comparison.  

A minimum of one complete survey of aquatic life for the baseline study is required, but 

data from two or more consecutive years is typically preferred as two years is the minimum 

time required to define inter-annual variability.  In addition, an aquatic baseline program 

should identify and further assess any potential fish barriers within the Project Area, 

especially downstream of the planned infrastructure, to determine whether potential fish

and fish habitat effects occur, per the Fisheries Act and Schedule 2 of the Metal Mining 

Effluent Regulation. 

20.1.8 Terrestrial Ecosystems 

Terrestrial ecosystems can support important ecological communities and vegetation, such 

as mature and old forest, provincially red- and blue-listed ecological communities and 

plants, federally listed plants, alpine communities, flood communities and wetland 

communities.  Wetlands have the ability to provide ecological values and functions; a 

wetland function assessment is often needed to support an EA application. 

No terrestrial ecosystem and wetland field studies have been carried out on the Project 

Area.  However, an internal desktop review was completed in July 2015, in preparation for 

exploration environmental management plans for the Central Zone area.  It was found that 

two blue listed species have potential to be located within the Project Area: Milky Draba 

(Draba lactea) and Dotted Saxifrage (Micranthes nelsoniana var. carlottae).  These species 

are considered vulnerable because they are rare or uncommon in B.C.  

A desktop review of publically available imagery and B.C. Broad Ecosystem Inventory 

data indicates that wetlands are present in the Project Area, which can provide a range of 

ecological functions such as biogeochemical, hydrological and habitat functions.  It is 

expected that the area contains primarily fen and swamp wetland classes with some 

potential for bog, marsh and shallow openwater wetlands. 

The findings outlined are insufficient to support the project going forward and that 

additional desktop and baseline field studies are required, including: 

 ecosystem mapping, vegetation inventory and targeted data collection of plant and 
ecological communities of concern, such as wetlands; 

 plant tissue sampling and analytical testing for metals to support project permitting and 
development; and 

 surveys to identify the presence of (or lack of) -  

o red- and blue-listed plants; 

o plant species either listed by the Species at Risk Act (2002) or listed by the 
Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), and 

o old forest, alpine communities, traditionally or culturally important species and 
communities and invasive plants. 

The Company has advised QP Brodie that it is aware that the Federal Policy on Wetland 

Conservation (1991) applies to federal departments and agencies when addressing the loss 

of wetlands and their functions, if that project requires a federal permit, license or 

authorization, and through the issuance of, would result in affecting wetland(s) designated 

as ecologically or socio-economically important to a region.  It is for these reasons that the 

required baseline studies will include an assessment of wetlands, including identification 

of wetland ecosystems at risk within the Project Area.

20.1.9 Wildlife and Wildlife Habitat 

It is established in Section 4.9 that current wildlife studies or reports completed to date 

include: mountain ungulate summer aerial field study (Rescan, 2008); mountain ungulate 

winter aerial field study (RTEC, 2012a); mountain ungulate management plan (Hemmera, 

2015); and mountain ungulate flight management plan (RTEC, 2016a). 

Moose are abundant in northern B.C., with an estimated average population of 170,000 

(Kuzyk, 2016).  Winter habitat is often considered critical habitat for maintaining moose 

populations, the majority of which occurs along rivers, in wetlands, in burned and logged 

areas and in the sub-alpine SWB zone, all of which features occur within or in the vicinity 

of the Project Area.  A moose winter survey identified the presence of 53 moose in the 

Project Area (RTEC, 2012a), as well as a number of wolf observations (predators of moose; 

Rescan, 2008).  Further studies will be required to establish baseline conditions for the 

moose population, as well as habitat suitability and distribution.  

Mountain ungulates, particularly Stone's sheep, mountain goat and northern mountain 

caribou, have been identified as an important wildlife resource within the region.  They are 

species at risk or of conservation concern, they are important to local First Nations and 

they are known to be both present and potentially affected by exploration or other 

development activities (Hemmera, 2015).  The species have also been identified as socially 

and economically important for both traditional harvest by the Tahltan Nation and 

recreational harvest by resident and non-resident hunters (Rescan 2008).  

The B.C. population of mountain goats has been estimated at between 39,000 and 66,000 

individuals, with the Skeena region supporting almost half the B.C. population (B.C. MOE, 

2010).  Stone's sheep are part of what is thought of as a metapopulation of thin horn sheep, 

the B.C. population of which is estimated at 12,300 to 15,000 individuals (Demarchi and 

Hartwig, 2004).  Stone's sheep inhabit open mountain slopes up to the BAFA alpine 

zonezone. 

A baseline report was produced summarizing the results if an aerial survey carried out in 

August 2007.  The survey represented a two-day snapshot of the distribution of mountain 

ungulates in a study area covering 90,000 ha west and northwest from Kinaskan Lake, 

including portions of the Project Area (Rescan, 2008).  In addition, one winter aerial study 

was completed in March 2012.  Both studies were conducted according to provincial 

standards.  Summer 2007 observations included 271 goats and 246 sheep; their distribution 

appeared to primarily occur within the northern part of the Project Area, due probably to 

the presence of escape terrain habitat.  A herd of 44 goats was located near the 2007 

exploration camp, east of the Donnelly Deposit, which appeared to be habituated to camp 

activities.  A substantial and regionally important population of sheep and goat exist north 

of the Project Area.  Important geological features such as salt licks, that appeared to be 

used by sheep and goat to ingest minerals, were also identified. 

No northern mountain caribou were noted during summer surveys described.  However, 

shed antlers were observed suggesting that caribou may inhabit parts of the Project Area 

during winter.  Other wildlife observations have included grizzly bear, golden eagle and 

wolf.  Winter aerial surveys resulted in mountain goat (216) and mountain sheep (268) 

observations (RTEC, 2012a).  This suggests fairly high winter populations of mountain 

goat and Stone's sheep that are consistent with summer observation data.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

Grizzly bears are distributed throughout B.C., from sea level and low-elevation river-

valleys to alpine elevations.  The B.C. population is estimated at 15,000 individuals (B.C. 

Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations, 2012).  They are considered 

a species of special concern by the COSEWIC and are blue-listed in B.C.  By comparison, 

black bears are common and widespread throughout B.C.  No field surveys or habitat 

suitability modeling for either grizzly or black bear has been carried out in the Project Area.  

However, both grizzly- and black-bear have been incidentally observed during the winter 

mountain ungulate surveys (for grizzly bear, RTEC, 2012a and 2015; 2016 crew 

observations).  

Other fur-bearer species that are probably present within the Project Area include wolf, 

American marten, American beaver and red squirrel, as well as the provincially blue-listed 

fisher and the federally-listed wolverine.  No formal fur-bearer studies have been 

completed to date.  However, wolf (RTEC, 2012a) and fox (2016 crew observations) have 

been seen.  

Birds are important to provincial and federal government agencies, First Nations and other 

stakeholders in the vicinity of the Project Area.  No bird surveys have been conducted to 

date.  However, golden eagle was recorded as an incidental species during the winter 2012 

(RTEC, 2012a). 

Amphibians are important to provincial and federal government agencies, First Nations 

and other stakeholders in the vicinity of the Project Area.  No amphibian studies have been 

conducted to date on the Project Area.  It is likely that the western toad occurs in the Project 

Area as this is a wide ranging species.  In B.C., the western toad is considered secure, but 

it is protected under the Wildlife Act. 

No specific species-at-risk surveys have been carried out on the Project Area to date 

(species at risk include those that are either identified on Schedule 1 of Species at Risk Act 

or COSEWIC, or are provincially listed).  

The data gaps outlined show that desktop and field studies will required to supplement the 

findings collected to date and to characterize the wildlife resource and wildlife habitat of 

the Project Area and surrounding areas.  Ecosystem mapping and wildlife habitat suitability 

mapping is recommended that, at a minimum, should include moose, mountain goat, 

mountain sheep and grizzly bear.  Baseline programs should follow B.C.'s wildlife 

suitability mapping standards (RIC 1999) and other wildlife survey provincial standards.  

In addition, bird, amphibian and bat surveys are recommended.  Bird surveys typically 

include raptors (hawks, falcons, owls and other birds of prey), wetland birds (ducks, geese, 

shorebirds and other bird families associated with water bodies), forest and alpine birds 

(songbirds, hummingbirds, woodpeckers and game birds in terrestrial areas).  Species at 

risk in all categories should be targeted in baseline surveys.  Consultation with government 

agencies, First Nations and community members are important steps to establish the 

species and habitat of concern for baseline studies. 

20.2 Potential Environmental Issues 

No significant environmental risks have been identified that could prevent the Spectrum-GJ Cu-

Au Project from advancing to the next phase of development towards becoming an operating mine.  

However, projections of environmental and community matters, their associated costs and 

permitting schedule, are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented here.  These risks 

include: 

 projections as to permitting time lines, timing and conditions of permits required to initiate 
mine construction, and potential delays in the issuance of permits; and 

 changes to government regulation of mining operations, environmental issues, permitting 
requirements and social risks; or 

 unrecognized environmental, permitting and social risks, and title disputes or claims.  

It should also be emphasized that the baseline studies, programs and surveys recommended in 

Section 20.1 are required to support the project going forward.  The Company has advised QP 

Brodie that it is aware of the study and survey requirements and intends to undertake the studies 

and surveys at the appropriate time or times. 

 

20.3 Water and Waste Management 

20.3.1 Concept Criteria 

The following provide a basis for identifying those measures that require inclusion in the 

water and waste management plans for the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au project: 

 fish habitat exists in the rivers and lakes in the vicinity of the Project Area (as discussed 
and described in Sub-Section 20.1.7); 

 as stated in Sub-Section 20.1.3, many of the notionally mined materials have potentially 
adverse geochemical properties (ML/ARD) with respect to protection of the 

environment; 

 some industrial materials (fuel, explosives, metallurgical reagents, cyanide) have 
potentially adverse properties with respect to protection of the environment. 

20.3.2 Preliminary Planning 

For purposes of the PEA, preliminary plans have been formulated with respect to the 

preceding points.  The Company has advised QP Brodie that when detailed designs are 

compiled at the feasibility stage of project development, water and waste management 

plans for operation and closure will encompass best management practices to ensure a 

proactive approach to protection of the environment.  This includes the design, 

construction, operation and closure of the planned TSF such that it always meets or exceeds 

the objectives set out in the Canadian Dam Association 2014 publication 'Application of 

Dam Safety Guidelines to Mining Dams' and BC MEM HSRC of July 2016.  The 

preliminary plans include the following: 

 diversion of clean water around mine facilities (as stated in Section 18, surface water 
run-off ditches form an integral part of the planned TSF layout); 

 collection and processing/treatment of contact water –

o as stated in Section 18, processing water is captured in the planned TSF and then 
either pumped back to the processing plant for re-use or, in the case of excess water, 

pumped via a polishing pond to a treatment plant, prior to release to the general 

environment, and 

o as described in Section 17, water from the CIL plant is send through a cyanide detox 
plant, prior to being released to the TSF; 

 design for closure of all mine facilities, with the objective of avoiding long-term risk 
to the environment from residual mine components, and avoiding the need for long-

term active water treatment (as described below); and 

 permanent underwater disposal of PAG materials, in mined-out pits, in constructed 
facilities (the TSF) or in constructed waterbodies (as described below). 

20.4 Waste and Tailings Disposal 

The main driver in the development of the water and waste management plans for the project is 

the geochemical properties of the mined materials.  For purposes of the PEA, geochemistry, as 

discussed in Sub-Section 20.1.3, has been advanced to the preliminary level only.  With this in 

mind, the comments and conclusions made in the following sub-sections are made, as regards 

planning for purposes of the PEA. 

20.4.1 Spectrum Pit 

PEA planning for Spectrum Pit envisions the production of 9.96 Mt of ROM plant feed 

(see Section 16.13).  Approximately 5.15 Mt of low-grade mineralization will be generated 

as waste, with an estimated total, post-blast volume of approximately 3.0 million cubic 

metres.  For purposes of the PEA, it is anticipated that 100% of this material will be PAG, 

although it might prove possible in a production environment to separate NAG material, 

based on the characterizations and recommended studies described in Section 20.1.3. 

Project planning for the PEA assumes that the PAG rock will be trucked for immediate 

underwater disposal in a small, sub-alpine lake located approximately one kilometre north 

of the planned adit portal.  The Company acknowledges that the suitability of the site will 

need to be confirmed by means of a detailed survey of the lake, per the requirements of the 

Fisheries Act (1985, the "1985 Act") described in Sub-Section 20.7.6.  The required survey 

will form part of the larger fisheries and aquatic habitat baseline survey recommended in 

Sub-Section 20.1.7. 

The available contour data for the target lake's area is insufficient to estimate storage 

volume with confidence at this early stage.  However, it is estimated that containment of 

3.0 million cubic metres of waste rock can safely be achieved through the construction 

dams at both the north and south ends of the small lake: 

 the lake is approximately 650 m long and approximately 240 m wide, and it is estimated 
to be approximately 10 m deep on average, thereby affording containment for up to 

approximately 1.56 Mt of waste; and 

 if 20 m high dams were constructed with individual crest lengths of 300 m, the 
containment capacity would increase to approximately 3.9 million cubic metres of

The downstream shell of the dam will comprise NAG rock, sourced either from the pre-

strip material (deeply weathered scree with negligible to no sulphide mineralization) and/or 

from sorted NAG material mined in Spectrum Pit.  The latter case would both reduce the 

total footprint of waste dump and reduce the cost of managing the PAG rock.  If additional 

capacity was required by virtue of future planned increases the size of Spectrum Pit, per 

the discussions of Section 16.3, this could readily be achieved by increasing the height and 

crest lengths of the dams.  For example, if 25 m high dams were constructed with individual 

crest lengths of 350 m, the containment capacity would increase to approximately 5.7 Mt 

of waste. 

It is anticipated that the constructed PAG storage lake will receive only incident 

precipitation on what would be a small catchment.  A spillway to pass the probable 

maximum flood will be required for closure.  An allowance of C$2.5 M has been made 

within the construction and operation cost estimate stated in Section 20.11, for construction 

of core and filters in the dams (60,000 m3) and excavation of a closure spillway. 

20.4.2 Donnelly Pit 

PEA planning for Donnelly Pit envisions the production of approximately 181 Mt of ROM 

plant feed, along with approximately 25.5 Mt of marginal grade material (above a grade 

cut-off of 0.1% CuEq, but below the ROM grade cut-off of 0.2% CuEq).  Approximately 

129.6 Mt of waste will also be produced, the latter containing negligible to no sulphide 

mineralization.  Production planning further envisions approximately 800 kt of the 

marginal grade material being processed in Year 6 (to fill the mill, due to a shortfall in 

ROM tonnes), with an additional 21.99 Mt of marginal grade material processed in the 

central plant facility from the end of Year 23 through to the end of the planned project life 

at the end of Year 25.  This leaves approximately 2.69 Mt of stockpiled, marginal grade 

material that might or might not be processed at the start of Year 26. 

PEA planning assumes that the Donnelly waste rock will be dumped to the north of the 

proposed pit, in a fairly flat area that is underlain by known mineralization of the North 

Donnelly deposit.  The marginal grade material will be stockpiled to the south of the pit 

area, on fairly flat ground, to facilitate its later removal and trucking to the tipping point at 

the top of the Donnelly muck handling system described in Section 16.6.  In both cases, 

preliminary analysis of available contour plans (20 m contours) suggests that surface water 

run-off from the dump and stockpile would report to the pit, or at least it could readily be 

made to flow back into the pit where it could be managed. 

For purposes of PEA planning, it has been assumed that the waste rock dump will be 

contoured and revegetated at the end of the mine life.  It is further assumed that the 

remaining stockpile of marginal grade material would be shoved back into the pit, using 

remaining production equipment, at a cost of C$1.0/t.  The Company acknowledges that 

for purposes of government bonding, a contractor rate might be required, but given the fact 

that the marginal grade material would probably be processed at the start of Year 26 (which 

eventuality has not been considered in the project cashflow model), the owner-operator 

cost has been applied.

20.4.3 Tailings Storage Facility 

It is established in Section 18 that tailings from the central processing plant will be 

contained in a valley located immediately to the south of the plant.  It is further established 

that prior to the desulphurization circuit coming on-line in Year 6, that the tailings will on 

average have a residual sulphur content of approximately 1.5% S, reducing to 

approximately 0.05% S in the case of desulphurized tails.  Preliminary analysis (see Sub-

Section 20.1.3) further suggests that the average carbonate content of the tails will be at 

least 10%, with up to an additional 50% of the tails comprising feldspars.  Additional 

ML/ARD testing is required to firm up the results, but on the basis of the preliminary 

testwork that has been performed for purposes of the PEA, it has been assumed that: 

 prior to the delsulphurization circuit coming on stream in Year 6, the processing tails 
will be PAG (although, given the residual sulphur content is less than 2% and the NL 

of the tails is probably in excess of 25%, the tails could prove to be NAG); 

 once the desulphurization circuit comes on line the tails will be NAG, but the pyrite 
concentrate tails will certainly be PAG. 

For the mine plans presented herein, there will be a total estimated mass of some 210 Mt 

of tailings.  Of this total, approximately 17 Mt will be produced prior to the 

desulphurization circuit coming on-line, following which approximately 174 Mt will 

comprise NAG tailings and the balance (approximatley 10%, or 19 Mt) will comprise 

strongly PAG, residual pyrite tailings. 

Tailings from the first five years of production will be disposed of such that the tails are 

always submerged in water.  Thereafter, the tailings will be separated into NAG and PAG 

streams, with the latter deposited into either the deep pond area of the TSF or a 

geomembrane-lined cell at the south end of the planned TSF, thereby to ensure permanent 

underwater disposal with very low seepage release.  The main TSF will provide secondary 

seepage containment for this facility.   All excess water in the lined pyritic storage area will 

be pumped in a dedicated pipeline back into the leaching circuit or to the cyanide 

destruction treatment plant.  No waste rock from either pit will be deposited in the planned 

TSF, the maximum capacity of which will be required for future production that has not 

been planned within the scope of the PEA. 

The dam concept and quantities for construction have been developed assuming that a 

water-retaining type dam is needed for prevention of ARD.  With the proposed segregation 

of pyrite concentrated tailings and no disposal of waste rock in the TSF, a simpler dam may 

be possible for the project.  This will be assessed at the feasibility level of project 

development.  Details of the preliminary dam design and related infrastructure are 

presented in Section 18.5 and are not repeated here. 

 

20.5 Water Management - Operations 

It is established in Section 20.1.3 that there is a potential for ML/ARD issues with the mined 

materials from both the Spectrum Pit and Donnelly Pit.  In particular it is anticipated that poor 

water quality might be associated with: 

 the planned Spectrum and Donnelly Pits, including incident precipitation and groundwater 
inflow;

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 the planned Donnelly Pit waste rock area, including seepage at toe of the dump (although that 
might report/be engineered to report to the pit) and, if necessary, groundwater flow;  

 local run-off in the processing plant area located at the MIA; 

 incident precipitation, by-pass of the planned diversion ditches and excess process water 
reporting to the planned TSF; and 

 pyritic tailings disposal area, the potential for residual (trace) levels of cyanide and high ARD 
potential. 

Due to significant neutralization potential in many of the mined materials, it is anticipated that 

drainage waters might have elevated metal contents (relative to standards for discharge of water 

to the environment).  Acidic waters with depressed pH levels are not expected.  The comments 

made in Sub-Section 20.1.5 concerning natural exceedances in streams and creeks across the 

Project Area are emphasized.  A wide range of compounds and metals, that naturally exceed 

discharge standards, have been identified, which emphasizes the importance of robust baseline 

surface water studies across the Project Area. 

It is established in Section 18.5 that a polishing pond will be constructed downstream of the water 

treatment plant.  The pond will have capacity for a minimum of five days effluent from the plant, 

or approximately 10,000 m3 (nominally 3 m deep x 60 m x 60 m).  The pond will be lined with 

local, low permeability soil or a geomembrane.  Water treatment will be based on lime addition to 

raise pH (near neutral to pH 9 – 9.5), followed by flocculent addition to remove precipitates.  The 

alkaline precipitates will be added to the tailings discharge into the main TSF, which will also be 

alkaline (NAG material and alkaline plant reagents), which will ensure long-term chemical 

stability.  A cyanide detox plant forms part of the process design described in Section 17.  For 

purposes of the PEA, it is anticipated that a secondary water treatment plant will not be needed for 

surplus water from the planned CIL circuit.  This will, however, be further assessed at the 

feasibility stage of project development.   

A preliminary water budget for the project suggests near zero water balance once full production 

is reached.  Most of the net accumulation of water will be stored in void spaces within the tailings 

volume.  It is anticipated that a net of about 650,000 m3/yr (0.22 L per second) of water will be 

treated and released.   The water balance might be more negative in early years when a TSF pond 

will be developed.  These estimates are based on an assumed mean annual net precipitation of 650 

mm per year.   

 

20.6 Water Management - Closure 

Although the project will be constructed and operated to minimize post-closure requirements for 

water management, it is expected that some passive post-closure activities will be required (some 

of the waste and marginal grade material that will be mined and then stockpiled or will be PAG, 

as described in Sub-Section 20.1.3).  The specific amounts and timings of PAG material disposal 

cannot be defined at this time.  However, passive treatment in pit lakes involving sulphate reducing 

bacteria has been considered for other mines.  Similarly, wetlands have been considered for surface 

and seepage water from tailings areas.  These concepts will be applied to the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au 

project, going forward. 

As it may take some time after mine closure to fully develop the passive treatment systems, the 

site water treatment plant will remain fully functional until such time as it is determined to be no

20.7 Licensing and Permitting 

20.7.1 Applicable Acts and Regulations 

The Spectrum-GJ Project is subject to the B.C. Environmental Assessment Act ("B.C. 

EAA") and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act ("CEAA") review process, which 

can be co-led by the B.C. Environmental Assessment Office ("EAO") and the Canadian 

Environmental Assessment Agency ("CEA Agency"). 

The B.C. EAA and accompanying regulations and guidance documents establish the over-

arching regulatory framework for undertaking an EA in B.C.  Within this framework, each 

project must assess its potential environmental, economic, social, heritage and health 

effects using project-specific scope, procedures and methods that are tailored specifically 

to the circumstances of the proposed project.  This approach allows for each assessment to 

focus on key issues relevant to the project, when determining whether or not the project 

should proceed.  The B.C. EAA is supported by the following regulations: 

 Reviewable Projects Regulation (B.C. Reg. 370/2002), which establishes the criteria 
for determining whether proposed projects should be subject to the B.C. EAA; 

 Prescribed Time Limits Regulation (B.C. Reg. 372/2002), which establishes time 
limits, in calendar days, for different stages of the assessment process – 

o Section 2 prescribes a 30-day time limit for screening of the Application by the 
Executive Director, 

o Section 3(a) establishes a 180-day period for the review of the Application, and 

o there is a 45-day time limit for making a decision after the Application has been 
referred to the Ministers; 

 public Consultation Policy Regulation (B.C. Reg. 373/2002): applies to reviewable 
project under the B.C. EAA when a Section 10 Order has been issued (the regulation 

requires proponents to undertake a public consultation program, as well as provide a 

summary and evaluation of public consultation activities carried out during the 

assessment process); 

 Concurrent Approval Regulation (B.C. Reg. 371/2002) allows proponents with a 
reviewable project undergoing assessment to apply for concurrent review and approval 

of eligible provincial authorizations which are needed to construct, operate, undertake 

and decommission a project; and 

 Environmental Assessment Fee Regulation (B.C. Reg. 50/2014): came into force in 
April 2014 and requires project proponents and EAC holders to pay stipulated fees at 

certain times during the assessment process. 

While the B.C. EAA prohibits issuance of provincial permits before an EA Certificate is 

issued, the Concurrent Approval Regulation (B.C. Reg. 371/2002) allows for parallel 

review of related provincial permit applications.  This regulation applies to provincial 

permits, authorizations and approvals necessary to undertake works that are within the

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

scope of the assessment under the B.C. EAA.  Statutory permit approval processes are 

normally more specific than those required for the EA level of review, for certain permits 

require detailed and possibly final engineering design information.  To be eligible for 

concurrent review, the approval must be required to construct, operate, modify, abandon, 

or otherwise undertake part of all the reviewable project that is the subject of the EA.  The 

B.C. Major Mine Permitting Office typically leads the permitting process for major mines 

across B.C. This office works with proponents, First Nations and government technical 

advisors to coordinate multi-agency regulatory permits and implement the efficient and 

timely review of applications for new major mines and major expansion projects. 

20.7.2 Regulatory Authorities 

The B.C. EAO and the CEA Agency coordinate a project's review process by either 

entering into a substitution agreement, which allows the provincial process (see below) for 

a project to be substituted for the federal process, or working together to complete their 

project reviews.  Substituted EA projects are carried out by the EAO and CEA Agency in 

accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding (EAO and CEA Agency, 2013), which 

establishes expectations, roles and procedures for implementing substituted EA review 

processes in B.C..  Under Section 32 of CEAA 2012, where there is an appropriate EA 

process in place to substitute the federal EA process, the Minister of the Environment must 

approve the substitution request. 

Under substitution, B.C. EAO prepares an EA report for both B.C. and Canada.  The 

respective federal and provincial ministers base their separate decisions on the single EA 

report as to the proposed project's significance of environmental effects, the sufficiency of 

Aboriginal consultation and whether to approve the project.  Throughout both the 

provincial and federal processes, consultation and community engagement are required, 

along with clear documentation.  A working group is formed once a project enters into the 

EA process, which is comprised of applicable provincial, federal, local government 

regulators and First Nations ofor the territory or territories the project potentially effect. 

On approval, the project proponents receive an EA Certificate and a Federal Ministerial 

Decision on the significance of project and its cumulative effects. These come with 

enforceable conditions for mitigation and follow-up programs required to proceed with 

permitting.  

20.7.3 Provincial Process 

The B.C. EAA process and regulations apply to major projects, as defined by criteria 

contained in the B.C. EAA Reviewable Projects Regulation (B.C. Reg. 370/2002).  New 

mineral mines that, during operations, will have a production capacity greater than 75,000 

tpa, must obtain an EA Certificate.  The Spectrum-GJ Project will have an annual plant 

throughput of between 3,650,000 tpa (at Stage 1) and 10,950,000 tpa (Stage 3). 

The decision to issue an EA Certificate for a mining project is made by the Minister of 

Energy and Mines and by the Minister of Environment (the "Responsible Ministers").  In 

making their decision, the Responsible Ministers must consider the Assessment Report 

(prepared by the EAO) and any recommendations accompanying the Assessment Report, 

and may consider any other matters they consider relevant to the public interest.  If the 

project is allowed to proceed, an EA Certificate is issued under Section 17(3) of the B.C.

EAA, with conditions applied to the certificate, as deemed necessary by the Responsible 

Ministers. 

An EA Certificate is comprised of general provisions, a description of the physical works 

and activities of the project.  It specifies a time limit by which a project must have 

substantially started, which is generally at least three years and not more than five years 

after the issue date of an EA Certificate, although the holder may apply for a one-time 

extension.  Once the project has substantially started construction, the EA Certificate 

remains in effect for the life of the project, unless it is suspended or cancelled for breaches 

of the conditions.  Proponents may apply to amend their EA Certificate as project 

circumstances change. 

20.7.4 Federal Process 

The Spectrum-GJ Project is also subject to federal EA requirements pursuant to CEAA 

2012, which replaced the CEAA 1992 and its 2003 and 2010 amendments. The Regulations 

Designating Physical Activities (SOR/2012-147) identify thresholds for projects that may 

be subject to a federal EA process, as follows: 

Section 16: The construction, operation, decommissioning and abandonment of a new: 

a) Metal mine, other than a rare earth element mine or gold mine, with an ore 

   production capacity of 3 000 t/day or more; 

b) Metal mill with an ore input capacity of 4 000 t/day or more; 

c) Rare earth element mine or gold mine, other than placer mine, with an ore 

   production capacity of 600 t/day or more. 

If a project is described in the regulation (i.e. it is considered a Designated Project), a 

project description must be submitted to the CEA Agency or designated Responsible 

Authority for the purposes of determining whether a federal EA is required for the 

Designated Project.  The project description is screened to determine if there are potential 

adverse effects in areas of federal jurisdiction under Section 5 of CEAA 2012.  The project 

description must also be posted for public comment. 

Once the CEA Agency reviews and approves the project description, there is a 45 day 

screening period, including a 20 day public comment period, to determine whether a federal 

EA for the project is required.  If this is determined, an EA conducted by the CEA Agency 

must be completed within 365 days, which would include issuance of a federal EA 

Decision Statement by the Minister of the Environment as to approve or reject the EA for 

the project. Under CEAA 2012, the decision-maker considers the potential for the 

designated project to cause significant adverse environmental effects.  If it is determined 

the designated project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, then the 

Minister of the Environment must refer to the Governor in Council as to whether those 

effects are justified in circumstances. 

If it is decided that the designated project is not likely to cause significant adverse 

environmental effects or the Governor in Council decides that the significant adverse 

environmental effects that the designated project are likely to cause are justified in the 

circumstances, then conditions must be set with which the proponent must comply.  For 

this purpose, the Minister of the Environment issues an EA Decision Statement containing

the conditions the proponent must meet, including any mitigation measures and/or follow-

up programs.  Federal authorities are prohibited from exercising any power or performing 

any duty or function that could permit a project to be carried out in whole or in part unless 

the EA Decision Statement indicates that the designated project is not likely to cause 

significant adverse environmental effects or that significant adverse environmental effects 

are justified in the circumstances. 

20.7.5 Required Provincial Permits 

Once a project proponent has received an EA Certificate, a number of authorizations, 

licenses and permits are required from provincial and federal government agencies, prior 

to construction and operation. Provincial permitting for a project can be pursued 

concurrently with the EA process, if the proponent chooses to so do.  However, such permit 

approvals cannot be granted until after a provincial EA Certificate has been issued.  Table 

20.1 provides a list of provincial authorizations, licenses and permits that are anticipated 

to be required for the construction and / or operation of the Spectrum-GJ Project.  The list 

is not intended to be exhaustive due to the complexity of government regulatory processes 

and the large number of minor permits, licences, approvals, consents, authorizations and 

potential amendments that would be required throughout the planned life of the Spectrum-

GJ Cu-Au project.

Fisheries Authorization 

Fish and fish habitat are protected under the 1985 Act, as well as other federal Acts, 

regulations and principles.  In 2012, the 1985 Act was amended to: 

 legislate the federal government's direction to focus efforts on protecting the 
productivity of commercial, recreational and Aboriginal fisheries; 

 institute enhanced compliance and protection tools that are more easily enforceable; 

 provide clarity, certainty, and consistency of regulatory requirements; and 

 enable/enhance partnerships with stakeholders. 

The changes to the 1985 Act include a prohibition against causing serious harm to fish that 

are part of or support a commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fishery (Section 35 of the 

1985 Act), provisions for flow and passage (Sections 20 and 21 of the 1985 Act), and a 

framework for regulatory decision-making (Sections 6 and 6.1 of the 1985 Act).  Any 

project or activity that causes a serious harm to fish that are part of, or support, a 

commercial, recreational or Aboriginal fishery requires an authorization under Section 

35(2) of the 1985 Act. 

Metal Mining Effluent Regulation (MMER; SOR/2002-222) 

The Metal Mining Effluent Regulation (the "MMER"; SOR/2002-22) is enacted under the 

1985 Act and applies to all metal mines in Canada.  These regulations impose effluent 

discharge limits for cyanide, arsenic, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, radium-226 and total 

suspended soils, as well as maximum and minimum pH levels.  The regulations also 

prohibit the discharge of effluent that is acutely lethal to fish (rainbow trout).  Under the 

regulations, proponents must conduct environmental effects monitoring programs to 

monitor and report on mine effluent quality, flows and the results of periodic effluent scans 

to identify adverse effects of mine effluent (if any) on fish, fish habitat and on the use of 

fisheries resources. Environmental effects monitoring studies include effluent 

characterization, receiving water quality monitoring, sub-lethal effluent toxicity tests, site 

characterization, fish population surveys, fish tissue analysis and benthic invertebrate 

community surveys. 

Schedule 2 Amendment of the Metal Mining Effluent Regulation 

Section 5(1)(a) of the MMER authorizes a proponent to deposit waste rock or effluent that 

contains any concentration of a deleterious substance into a tailing impoundment area that

is listed as a waterbody set out in Schedule 2 – Tailings Impoundment Areas. An 

amendment to Schedule 2 of the MMER is required if a project intends to construct the 

tailing management facility and dispose of tailings in habitat or natural waterbody 

frequented by fish.  Environment Canada administers the Schedule 2 Amendment process. 

Under Section 27.1 of the MMER, a Fish Habitat Compensation Plan is required to offset 

losses of fish habitat.  

The Spectrum-GJ TMF is located within the upper tributaries of creeks draining northwest 

into Kakiddi Lake chain. Further baselines studies to support project feasibility and 

environmental assessment would include an assessment of fish habitat and identification 

of any present fish barriers to help inform whether a Schedule 2 Amendment and / or a 

Fisheries Authorization would be required for project development. 

20.8 EA and Permitting Schedule 

The EA process consists of two main stages: Pre-Application (including application development 

and evaluation); and Application Review (including application review and decision), followed by 

a Post Certification stage. Timeframes vary by project.  However, a typical EA takes at least 16 to 

20 months to complete (EAO, 2015). 

An EA schedule is strongly influenced by the proponent's timing in gathering and providing 

information necessary to conduct the assessment.  The Pre-Application stage for B.C. mines 

typically, but not always, consists of two years of baseline studies and application development, 

but the schedule can vary.  The Application Review stage has timeline restrictions of 180 days for 

EAO to complete its review and 45 days for the responsible ministers to make a decision whether 

to issue an EA Certificate for the project to proceed.  Throughout the Pre-Application and 

Application Review stages, First Nation consultation is required to address First Nations concerns 

whose territories overlap the proposed project area.  Figure 20.2 illustrates the key stages and 

components of the B.C. environmental assessment process and timeline periods (EAO 2017).

The Federal process, under CEAA 2012, has similar requirements and similar time restrictions to 

those described for the provincial process.  The two processes run in parallel with the federal 

decision typically lagging behind the B.C. decision by three to six months.  Figure 20.3 illustrates 

the key steps and processes of the federal EA process. 

As previously stated, provincial permits can be developed concurrently and decisions made by 

government typically within six months of EA decisions. However, a higher level of detail is 

required for key permits to commence construction (Mines Act and Environmental Management 

Act [discharge] permits) and as such appropriate engineering must be available to support 

concurrent permitting.   

In and of itself, the EA and permitting process takes approximately three to four years.  There is 

opportunity to condense the schedule with the key factors being First Nation and community 

concerns and/or support of and for project, project complexity, level of engineering and availability 

of relevant and recent environmental baseline information.

20.9 Environmental Management System and Plan 

A conceptual Environmental Management System ("EMS") and an associated Environmental 

Management Plan ("EMP") for the Project will need to be developed.  An EMS: 

 is an integrated system that identifies shared mitigations among the many objectives and 

identifies key timelines in each project phase; 

 defines the environmental approach through all phases of the Project, is based on avoidance, 

mitigation and management of effects identified and in consultation with regulators and First 

Nations; 

 aims to organize and guide activities during all project phases to ensure safe, compliant, and 

environmentally and socially responsible operations. 

The EMS for the Project could be constructed in a way that includes: an organizational structure 

and reporting structure; the assignment of responsibilities; communication protocols; company 

policies; methods to evaluate environmental practices, procedure, and processes; and resource 

allocation.   

A high-level framework supporting each EMP is required in the B.C. Mines Act Permit.  EMPs 

include the detailed goals, objectives and procedures for the protection of worker health and safety, 

environmental monitoring and operating procedures that show the regulatory agencies how 

legislation and regulations will be met for the Project.  They are applied during each project stage 

that may be summarized as planning, construction, operation, closure and post-closure.  They 

detail environmental protection measures to mitigate potential environmental effects and include 

the environmental practices and procedures to be applied during each phase of the Project. 

EMPs are developed to be site‐specific and to ensure that necessary measures are identified and 

implemented to protect the environment and comply with environmental legislation.  They include 

legislative requirements, policies, best management practices, committed mitigation measures, 

monitoring and reporting commitments.  EMPs may include, but are not limited to the flowing 

plans that are not listed in any particular order of importance: 

 Surface Water and Groundwater Management and Monitoring; 

 Rock Storage Facility and Waste Management and Monitoring; 

 Metal Leaching and Acid Rock Drainage Management; 

 Dangerous Goods and Hazardous Materials Management; 

 Fish and Aquatic Habitat Management; 

 Wildlife Management and Monitoring; 

 Vegetation and Wetland Management; 

 Sediment and Erosion Control; 

 Noise Management; 

 Air Quality Management and Monitoring; 

 Emergency and Spill Response; 

 Archaeological and Cultural Resources Management; and 

 Transportation, Traffic and Access Management.

20.10 Economic, Social and Cultural Setting and Studies 

Federal, provincial, regional, municipal and Aboriginal community governance occurs in the 

Project Area and surrounding vicinity. The Project Area lies within the Regional District of 

Kitimat-Stikine. District of Stewart, the City of Terrace and the Town of Smithers are the closest 

communities with municipal governance, but they are far removed from the Project Area.  The 

non-Aboriginal bodies that are unincorporated and are governed by the regional district in which 

they are situated include Dease Lake, South Hazelton, Bell II, Meziadin Junction and Bob Quinn 

Lake.   

The base level of governance for Aboriginal communities is the Nation or Band. Five Tahltan 

communities apply or may apply to the Project, including Telegraph Creek 6 and 6A, Guhthe Tah 

12, Dease Lake 9 and Iskut 6.  The Tahltan Reserve No. 9 is located at Dease Lake.  It is established 

in Section 4.9 that Tahltan governance is administered through the band system under the Federal 

Indian Act (1985), with an elected chief and council who oversee the daily social and economic 

affairs of the community.  The Tahltan Nation is comprised of two bands, the Iskut First Nation 

and the Tahltan Band (B.C. MARR 2017).  The TCG represents the two bands and is governed by 

an Executive Committee and a Board of Directors comprised of family representatives, with an 

Elders Advisory Council providing guidance.  THREAT represents the TCG on matters related to 

consultation and engagement with resource development. 

20.10.1 Socio-Economic Setting 

According to B.C. MOE (2017), regional population sizes have decreased in northwest 

B.C., of which the Stikine has had the largest recent decrease – the 2015 population was 

half of what it was in 1986.  Smithers and Terrace provide supplies and services to the 

majority of the remote region in which the Project Area is located.  Communities are 

scattered and the region's economic and social growths have been limited due to poor 

infrastructure and access, as well as the cold climate hosting long winters. 

Northwest B.C. has a history of depending on natural resources, especially forestry, mining 

and fishing, as its main economic drivers.  For example, the regional mining industry is a 

source of employment for a significant number of Smithers and Terrace residents and, in 

recent years, it has provided approximately 30% of the jobs available for communities 

along Highway 37 (Tetra Tech 2016).  However, the economy in northwest B.C. is 

becoming ever-more diversified with new industries being developed (for example 

hydroelectric power generation).  In addition, employment levels have increased in the 

public service, sales and service, tourism, transportation (Highways 16, 37 and 37A are the 

primary transportation corridors in the northwest) and mineral exploration sectors.   

It may be anticipated that the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project will provide economic benefits 

to the local communities through direct and indirect employment opportunities.  The 

overall local economic impacts are likely to be beneficial, as will the benefits to the 

northern region and B.C. as a whole.  The benefits accrue from employee incomes, 

Company expenditures, as well as contributions to potential annual government revenues 

from property tax, royalties, licensing fees and income tax. 

No Project-specific socio-economic baseline studies have been conducted to date.  Baseline 

studies will be needed and will include consultation with the Tahltan Nation, local 

communities and government.  The Tahltan Social Cultural Working Committee will be 

consulted for socio-cultural assessment inputs.  Health Canada will be consulted to

determine health concerns and information.  Data collection, including field interviews, 

will be needed to obtain information on governance, population and demographics, 

economy and employment, health, education, social issues, culture and community 

services and infrastructure. 

20.10.2 Aboriginal Groups 

In 2006, approximately 32% of the Regional District of Kitimat-Stikine's population was 

reportedly Aboriginal (Tetra Tech 2016).  It is established in Section 4.9 that indigenous 

people have a physical, cultural and historical presence within the Project Area and 

surrounding region.   

The forestry and fishing industries have declined since the 1980s and have negatively 

impacted Aboriginal communities.  However, the current socio-economic setting of the 

region's Aboriginal communities is starting to improve due to opportunities provided by 

the mineral industry and tourism in particular (Tetra Tech 2016).  The Company is keenly 

aware of its responsibilities in these regards and, as stated in Section 4.9, it has committed 

to work closely with the TCG, with its agencies and with Tahltan Nation-owned businesses 

to identify and maximize employment and contracting opportunities arising from its 

mineral exploration and project development activities. 

20.11 Reclamation and Closure Costs 

Rehabilitation and reclamation of ground disturbances caused during the Company's field 

exploration programs are detailed in Section 4.7.  Preliminary reclamation and closure plans and 

related cost estimates have been developed for the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project, by QP Brodie, 

based mainly on knowledge and experience of similar operations in B.C.  Preliminary reclamation 

and closure plans and costs were separately estimated for: 

 Spectrum and Donnelly Pits, including bulkheads in the planned drifts, removal of 
infrastructure from the pits and from underground, in-pit water treatment and road closure; 

 waste dumps and stockpiles, including closure of the dam and spillway at the planned Spectrum 
PAG waste rock dump, recontouring the NAG waste dump at Donnelly Pit and shoving the 

remaining PAG, marginal grade material back into the pit using existing mine equipment (at a 

rate of C$1.00/t, although for purposes of bonding, the Company acknowledges that a 

contractor rate might be applied); 

 closure of the TSF spillway and dam, decommissioning the by-pass ditches and the removal 
of any access roads; 

 hazardous waste and contaminated soils' removal from the SIA and MIA, demolition of 
buildings and the removal of temporary structures, rehabilitation of the access roads and 

bridges, and revegetation; 

 mobilization and demobilization of contractors, engineering and project management at 5% 
each of the estimated costs, interim care and maintenance and an overall 25% cost contingency; 

and 

 water management and post-closure costs, the latter including environmental monitoring, dam 
safety inspections/reviews and maintenance of spillways and wetlands.

The overall estimated total cost for planned mine life is C$56.23 million, inclusive of indirects and 

a 25% contingency.  For purposes of cashflow modelling, reclamation and closure costs report to 

G&A, with 15% of the total estimated cost for each cost centre notionally paid as a bond in Year 

1 (Year 6 in the case of the Spectrum Pit), with the balance apportioned pro-rata over the remaining 

mine life (24 years in the case of Donnelly Pit and 5 years in the case of Spectrum Pit).

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

The Principal Author and Scott Britton, C. Eng. (the "Co-Authors") are responsible for this section 

of this Technical Report, along with Christopher Martin, C. Eng. ("QP Martin"), who is 

responsible for the capital and operating cost estimates for the processing plant, inclusive of the 

plant personnel complements.  The TSF, related infrastructure and waste rock dam cost estimates 

were compiled from information supplied by M. John Brodie, P. Eng.  Overall, the estimates are 

intended to be at the Class 4 level, as defined by AACE, with an expected accuracy range of Low: 

-15% to -30% and High: +20% to +50%. 

21.1 Capital Costs 

Capital costs have been estimated in Q1, 2017 US dollars and do not include allowances for 

escalation or exchange rate fluctuations.  A base case exchange rate of C$1.0 = US$0.75, as defined 

in Section 19.2, was applied.  Table 21.1 provides a summary of the overall estimated capital costs 

by cost centre; Figure 21.1 summarizes the capital expenditures by production year.  The amounts 

include contingencies and capital indirects.

Totals C$ 216.05 C$ 362.15 C$ 578.20 
Notes:  The capital cost estimates are inclusive of contingencies.  Totals may not add up due to rounding. 

It should be emphasized that the low pre-production capital requirement (C$216.05 million) 

reflects one of the benefits of the phased approach adopted as regards project development: 

significant capital can be and has been deferred to the benefit of project economics.  This has in 

part been achieved through a planning process that encompassed considerations of the types of 

practical, physical and operational risks that are inherent to any new, start-up operation (a wealth 

of global mining experience shows that lengthy lead times are invariably required before such risks 

can be overcome and optimal results can routinely and sustainably be achieved, especially with 

greenfield projects).  Key elements of capital deferral include: 

 production from Spectrum Pit to Year 6, hence the related capital costs for SIA access, pit 

infrastructure and production equipment (C$26.82, including contingencies but not capital 

indirects) to Years 3 through 5, as appropriate –  

o metallurgical testwork showed that gold recovery by flotation was poor for high (gold) 
grade material from Spectrum Pit (i.e. the material targeted for early extraction, per the 

discussions of Section 16), due to the low copper grades of such material, whereas

o good gold recovery was achieved when co-mingled with material from Donnelly Pit, due 
to the comparatively higher copper grade that generates a strong froth on flotation that 

facilitates good gold recovery; 

 the SAG mill to Year 5, as described in Section 17.6; and 

 the CIL plant to Year 5 - preliminary analysis of potential financial outcomes showed that the 
amount of gold captured from ROM material from Donnelly Pit in Years 1 through 5 was 

insufficient to justify the capital cost of the CIL plant, which outcome was reversed when 

Spectrum Pit came on-line in Year 6, due to the comparatively much higher gold grades in the 

planned ROM feed from Spectrum Pit.

21.1.1 Direct Capital Costs 

Direct capital costs total C$503.13 million over the planned life of the project, inclusive of 

contingencies.  The estimates were compiled using a variety of sources, including: 

 vendor and contractor quotes for the planned camp, road construction, bridges and 
culverts, muck handling belts and plant equipment; 

 industry sources, benchmarked to information contained in public domain documents 
and reports for projects similar in nature and size to the planned Spectrum-GJ project, 

for the powerline, Northwest Transmission Line take-off substation, site sub-station 

and distribution system;

 InfoMine's 2016 CostMine models, benchmarked to information contained in public 
domain documents and reports for similar projects and backed by knowledge and 

experience of the Co-Authors, for mining equipment, underground development and 

buildings; and 

 knowledge and experience of QP Brodie, benchmarked to information contained in 
public domain documents and reports for similar projects, for the TSF, by-pass ditches, 

water treatment plant, spillway, polishing pond and Spectrum waste rock dams. 

Details of the production equipment, pit infrastructure and pre-strip quantities are presented 

in Section 16, details of the capital schedule for plant equipment are presented in Section 

17 and details of the infrastructure elements are presented in Section 18.  Maintenance shop 

tools were estimated at 3% of total equipment cost. 

21.1.2 Sustaining Capital 

Other than the deferred direct capital costs outlined and the year-on-year cost of raising the 

TSF dam, as described in Section 18.5, the sustaining capital amounts centre around 

production, support and surface mining equipment rebuilds and replacement purchases.  A 

rebuild and replacement schedule was developed for purposes of cost estimation, taking 

into account the staged increases in plant throughput, hence changing size and/or capacity 

requirements for major mining equipment such as shovels and trucks.  For purposes of 

analysis it was assumed that: 

 major mining equipment would run for an average of 8,000 hours per annum for five 
years, after which equipment rebuilds would be required at 40% of the original capital 

cost, following which the equipment would be good for another two to three years 

before being scrapped; 

 other mining equipment and surface equipment would run for an average of 6,000 hours 
per annum for seven years, after which equipment rebuilds would be required at 40% 

of the original capital cost, following which the equipment would be good for another 

three years before being scrapped. 

Scrap values were not included in analysis, on the basis that any residual value would be 

off-set by the cost of removing the equipment from site. 

21.1.3 Indirect Capital Costs 

Indirect capital costs total C$75.07 million over the life of the Spectrum-GJ project.  The 

estimates include: 

 consultants' fees and start-up commissioning (pre-production only, with the estimates 

based on the QPs knowledge and experience, bench-marked to information contained 

in public domain documents and reports for projects similar in nature and size to the 

planned Spectrum-GJ project; 

 EPCM at 10.5% of all direct capital costs, except for mine pre-production capital, mine 

production equipment and support equipment; 

 construction indirects at 50% of the EPCM estimates;

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 capital spares at 1.5 months of Y1 operating costs; and 

 freight at 7.5% of equipment and material costs, except for mining equipment. 

21.1.4 Contingencies 

Contingencies were applied to all direct capital cost estimates, at rates that reflect the level 

of uncertainty of the estimate.  Where vendor or contractor quotes were secured or costs 

were estimated using InfoMine's 2016 CostMine models, 15% contingencies were applied.   

25% contingencies were applied where experience-based and bench-marked estimates 

were used.  The one exception was Spectrum Pit infrastructure – for the reasons described 

in Section 16.5, a contingency of 20% was applied. 

21.2  Operating Costs 

Operating costs have been estimated in Q1, 2017 US dollars and do not include allowances for 

escalation or exchange rate fluctuations.  A base case exchange rate of C$1.0 = US$0.75, as defined 

in Section 19.2, was applied.   

Operating costs were separately compiled for the planned openpits, central processing plant and 

general and administrative ("G&A").   Table 21.2 summarizes the estimated unit operating costs 

by area; Figure 21.2 summarizes the estimated operating costs by production year.  The Stage 2 

(20,000 tpd) operating cost estimates include Spectrum Pit contributing an average of 5,000 tpd of 

plant feed over six years.  The G&A costs include reclamation and closure of Spectrum Pit, 

Donnelly Pit and all related infrastructure.  An estimate of the Company's head office cost is 

included on Table 21.2, although it was modelled as a separate drawdown cost from cashflow.  

The estimated overall, life-of-mine and on-site operating cost is C$14.34 / t milled.

management and support staff (human resources, IT, accountants, purchasing and 

expediting, clerks, secretaries and security), senior mine and plant management, and 

technical services.  Shift and maintenance foreman were included with the operating costs 

for the planned openpits and central processing plant. 

The complements of hourly paid mine and mine maintenance personnel were estimated 

from consideration of the required mine and support equipment fleets, by production rate.  

The complements of hourly paid plant and plant maintenance personnel were estimated 

from consideration of the process flows, by production rate.  In both cases general surface 

labour was included in the estimates that were based on the assumption of a two-week-on, 

two-week-off crew rotation and 12 hour shifts, 365 days a year.  Table 21.3 summarizes 

the estimated personnel complements.

Remuneration rates for salaried and hourly paid personnel were based on a balance between 

the Co-Authors' and QP Martin's knowledge and experience of similar operations located 

in B.C., remuneration rates detailed in InfoMine's 2016 CostMine models and data for 

similar projects contained in public domain documents and reports.  An average burden 

rate of 30% was applied to the estimated base remuneration rates, thereby to include all 

statutory Canadian and B.C. social insurance, medical and insurance costs, pension and 

vacation costs, but not camp and travel costs that were separately estimated. 

21.2.2 Mining Costs 

Apart from personnel costs, mining cost estimation included considerations of drilling, 

blasting, mucking (to the tipping points at the pit rims), hauling and dumping (ROM 

material and waste, from the bottom of the planned ROM materials passes, as appropriate 

and described in Section 16), stockpile maintenance (at Donnelly only), geotechnical (slope 

stability), pumping, equipment operation and maintenance.  Site and buildings 

maintenance and office consumables were included in the Spectrum Pit cost estimate.  For 

Donnelly Pit, the same costs were included in the G&A cost estimate due to the location 

of the offices in the main administration block at the MIA. 

Blasting costs were estimated from first principles assuming powder factors of 0.33 kg/t 

for ROM plant feed, 0.29 kg/t for marginal material and waste, and a 70:30 mix of ANFO 

and emulsion blasting agents.  Unit costs for blasting consumables were based on vendor 

information and data contained in InfoMine's 2016 CostMine models.  In the case of the 

Spectrum Pit operations, diesel generated power was assumed with a unit diesel cost of 

C$1.00 /litre.  The Spectrum Pit cost estimate also included the estimated cost of hauling 

ROM plant feed by B-Train type trucks over 11 km to the central processing plant located 

at the MIA.  Table 21.4 summarizes the annual and unit costs for each stage of production 

throughput.

21.2.3 Processing Costs 

Average annual costs and unit costs for the central processing plant by production 

throughput are summarized on Table 21.5.  The cost estimates include considerations of 

the planned flotation, gravity, CIL and doré circuits and facilities, inclusive of estimate 

reagent consumption rates and maintenance.  Unit rates for power costs are based on 

current knowledge of rates in the area, some earlier meetings with BC Hydro in British 

Columbia and recent estimates from other developing operations in the area.  A rate of 

$0.050/kWh is used.  Power costs are based on the unit rates for power and the electrical 

load analysis developed for the project.  The Stage 2 (20,000 tpd) and Stage 3 (30,000 tpd)

costs include the planned CIL circuit that, during Stage 2, is estimated to cost C$1.17/t 

milled, reducing to C$1.07/t milled during Stage 3.  For purposes of cashflow modelling, 

fixed costs included labour, 25% of the estimated power cost and maintenance.  Variable

Consumables were assumed to equal 15% of the estimated personnel cost.  Communication 

expenses includes monthly fees for landline and mobile telephone services, satellite 

transmission services and Internet services, based on an annual allowance estimated from 

experience with similar operations and bench-marked to similar operations for which 

public domain documents and reports are available.  All-in camp costs were based on a 

contractor quote of C$55/person/day for personnel at site, plus a 5% personnel 

contingency.   An allowance for Community & Environment was assumed for costs 

associated with public disclosure and information programs, assistance programs for 

communities and other related programs, as well as for costs associated with quality 

sampling and monitoring, analysis of surface and groundwater, and surface flow

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The QPs for this section of this Technical Report are the Principal Author and Scott A. Britton, C. 

Eng. (the "Co-Authors").  Pre- and post-tax models were compiled from linked, year-on-year 

spreadsheet analyses of the production profiles, metal production (ex. the central processing plant), 

payable metal, capital expenditures ("CAPEX"), operating cost expenditures ("OPEX"), cashflow 

and taxes.  The model was compiled by Graham Wood of XFRM Canada of New Westminster, 

B.C.  The tax model was compiled by Andrew MacRitchie, CPA, CA, Chief Financial Officer and 

Corporate Secretary of the Company, and reviewed by the Principal Author. 

The results represent forward-looking information that is subject to several of known and unknown 

risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those 

presented here.  Forward-looking information includes Mineral Resource estimates, commodity 

prices and exchange rates, the proposed mine production plans, projected recovery rates, mine 

infrastructure costs, general infrastructure costs, the use of the deep water Port of Stewart and that 

the required permits will be secured. 

22.1 Methodology 

Financial analysis of the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project was carried out using a discounted cashflow 

("DCF") approach.  This method of valuation requires projecting yearly cash inflows (or revenues) 

and subtracting yearly cash outflows such as operating costs, capital costs, royalties and taxes.  

The resulting net annual cashflows are discounted back to the date of valuation and totalled to 

thereby determine the NPV of the project, at selected discount rates.  The internal rate of return 

("IRR") is expressed as the discount rate that yields a zero NPV.  Payback periods are the time, in 

years, calculated from the start of significant project cashflows until all the initial CAPEX have 

been recovered.  In the case of the cashflow models presented here, the term initial CAPEX means 

pre-production CAPEX only (i.e. that spent in Production Years -1 and 0, to enable production to 

start in Year 1). 

Sensitivities to variations in OPEX, CAPEX, the US$ to C$ exchange rate and nested metal prices 

(for copper, plus gold and silver) are presented.  All monetary amounts are presented in Canadian 

dollars ("C$").   For purposes of discounting, cashflows are assumed to occur at the end of each 

period.  NPV calculations were adjusted so as to make the project start in Production Year 1, to 

which a calendar year has not been attributed.  The project cashflow models do not include 

considerations of interest or equipment scrap values, the latter on the assumption that the residual 

value of any equipment will be offset by the cost of removing scrapped equipment from site. 

22.2 Model Parameters 

The following parameters, which are not repeated here, were used for purposes of DCF modelling: 

 the NSR royalties and government taxes detailed in Section 4; 

 the metallurgical forecast and the process ramp-up profiles detailed in Section 13; 

 the production schedules for the Donnelly and Spectrum Pits detailed in Section 16; 

 the metal prices, discount rates, smelting and refining terms and factors, and the haulage, port 
charges, ocean freight charges and costs detailed in Section 19; 

 the reclamation and closure costs detailed in Section 20; and

22.3 Payable Metal 

Figures 22.1 through 22.3 summarize the payable metal produced over the three stages of plant 

throughput and when stockpiled, marginal grade material is processed at the end of the mine life.  

It may be seen that nearly a billion pounds of payable copper are produced over the project's life, 

along with 1.61 Moz of payable gold and 7.54 Moz of payable silver.

22.5 Cashflow 

Figure 22.4 summarizes the cumulative cashflows for the Base Case and two Upside Cases 

considered in analysis, the applicable (nested) metal prices are detailed on Table 22.1.  Table 22.2 

summarizes the key results of the PEA cashflow model, for the Base Case and two upside metal 

prices scenarios assumed in analysis.  It may be seen that Base Case, DCF cashflow analysis of 

the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project, as detailed in this Technical Report and using a discount rate of 

8%, indicates that the post-tax NPV is $314.09 M and the IRR is 20.6%.   The cumulative 

undiscounted, post-tax cashflow value for the Project is C$1,306 M and the post-tax payback 

period for the pre-production CAPEX only is 4.2 years. 

It should be emphasized that the payback periods stated on Table 22.2 are for pre-production 

CAPEX only.  As may be seen from consideration of Figure 22.4, the post-tax cumulative 

cashflows in particular drop slightly below the zero cashflow line in Year 5.  This is due to the 

second tranche of capital required to bring Spectrum Pit on-line, to increase production capacity 

at Donnelly Pit and to both install a SAG mill and to increase plant throughput capacity to 20,000 

tpd, per the discussions of Section 17.  If payback for this additional CAPEX is considered in 

analysis, the overall, post-tax payback period extends to 6.2 years, for the Base Case assumed in 

analysis.

Figures 22.5A and 22.5B summarize the post-tax IRR sensitivity to changes in CAPEX, OPEX, 

US$ to C$ exchange rate and metal prices.  Figures 22.6A and 22.6B summarize post-tax NPV 

sensitivity to the same sensitivity factors.  The analyses summarized on Figures 22.5A and 22.6B 

reflect model sensitivities by varying the percentage inputs of the sensitivity factors around the 

nested Base Case metal prices assumed in analysis (US$2.75/lb Cu, US$1,250/oz Au and 

US$17.75/oz).  It may be seen that: 

 the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au project (IRR and NPV) is by far the most sensitive to changes in the 

nested metal prices; 

 project IRR is equally sensitive to changes in the CAPEX and the exchange rate (which is the 

reason that the CAPEX and exchange rate plots cannot readily be separated on Figure 22.5A 

– their trends are exactly the same); 

 project IRR is least sensitive to changes in OPEX; and 

 the second-most sensitive factor as regards project NPV is the exchange rate, followed by 

OPEX and the by CAPEX to which the project NPV is not especially sensitive.

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Principal Author is responsible for this section of this Technical Report. 

23.1 Geological Setting 

The Project Area is hosted in the Stikine Terrane (or Stikinia) rocks of the Canadian Cordillera, in 

what is known as the Golden Triangle of northwest B.C.  It is established in Sections 7 and 8 that 

the geology is characterized by a suite of Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic rocks that in many areas 

are associated with porphyry-style and/or epithermal to mesothermal Au-Ag-Cu mineralization.  

It is because of this that the Golden Triangle is widely known as a prolific mineral belt that contains 

numerous deposits, advanced projects and significant prospects.  According to the B.C. Geological 

Survey Minfile database, there are more than 900 documented mineral occurrences of which some 

67 have documented historical Mineral Resources.   

23.2 Significant Mines and Mining Prospects 

Numerous small to large past-producing mines (primarily gold mines) have also operated in the 

region, dating back to the early 1900s.  Early production was primarily from small, high-grade 

underground gold mines such as the Premier Mine near Stewart, B.C.  This early trend persisted 

through to the 1990s at operations such Snip Mine, which was discovered in 1964 and which 

triggered a claim-staking rush.  This led to the discovery of a number of deposits, the most notable 

of which is perhaps Eskay Creek, a high-grade, submarine exhalative deposit that was mined using 

underground methods from January 1995 through December 2003 (the mine produced a reported 

annual average of approximately 320,800 ounces of gold and approximately 15.5 million ounces 

of silver - unverified data sourced from http://www.eskaymining.com/). 

With the notable exception of Brucejack that is under construction (it will be a high-grade, 

underground gold mine), the focus of exploration and development within the Golden Triangle has 

more recently shifted towards the many porphyry Cu-Au deposits that exist in the region.   These 

deposits have significantly lower grades than past producers such as Premier Mine, Snip Mine and 

Eskay Creek, but they generally encompass very large tonnages, hence metal endowments that far 

exceed any historical resources. 

Table 23.1 summarizes the latest, publically available Mineral Resource estimates for the five 

significant porphyry Cu-Au projects (with or without silver and molybdenum) located in the 

Golden Triangle of Northwest B.C., not including the Central Zone and Donnelly Deposit that are 

the subject of this Technical Report.  The presented information was compiled by the Principal 

Author from the following technical reports that can be sourced on www.sedar.com:

23.3 Red Chris Deposit and Mine 

The Red Chris porphyry Cu-Au deposit is the closest to the Project Area: it lies approximately 11 

km east of Highway 37 and 82 km south of Dease Lake.  The following text is, for the most part, 

abstracted from Gillstrom et al. (2012, amended and restated in 2015).  Summary details of current 

mining were compiled from the same reference, backed by observations and the results of 

conversations held with mine personnel during a visit, in October 2016, to Red Chris mine by the 

Principal Author. 

23.3.1 Geological Setting 

The southern half of the Red Chris property lies on a broad physiographic upland called 

the Todagin plateau, which is 'underlain mainly by the Stuhini Group, and numerous Late 

Triassic to Early Jurassic intrusions.  The southern edge of the plateau in the Red Chris 

area is marked by a ridge composed of Middle Jurassic, upper Hazelton Group and Bowser 

Lake Group sedimentary rocks, which were originally deposited unconformably on the Red 

Stock and the Stuhini Group after Early Jurassic uplift and erosion.  In places the northern 

edge of the unconformity is truncated by a high-angle fault'. 

'The northern half of the property is largely in topographically lower ground of the Ealue 

Lake valley and the plain containing the Klappan River, where the geology is less well 

known due to limited rock exposure.  At higher elevations, a mountain east of Ealue Lake 

consists of Stuhini Group and an Early Jurassic intrusion (Ealue Stock).  Slopes to the 

north and northeast of the lake are underlain by Stuhini/Hazelton rocks and Stikine 

Assemblage, respectively.  A swarm of Early Jurassic granitic dikes north of the lake trends 

NW-SE.  A northeast-trending fault is inferred to follow the trace of Coyote Creek and the 

Ealue Lake valley.  It continues to the east for an additional 30 kilometres where it has 

been designated the McEwan Creek Fault with a south side-down movement sense'. 

23.3.2 Mineralization 

The Red Chris 'deposit is hosted by the Red Stock, an east-northeast elongated intrusive 

body of pervasively quartz-sericite-ankerite-pyrite (phyllic) altered, and faulted sub-

volcanic, hornblende monzonite porphyry intrusion.  The stock intrudes and alters Upper 

Triassic Stuhini Group massive volcanic wackes, siltstone and augite-porphyritic basalt in 

the southwestern area of the Todagin Plateau'. 

The '…mineralization has good near-vertical and longitudinal continuity, controlled 

largely by post-mineral faulting superimposed on and along the ancestral, en-echelon, 

central axis fault zone. Pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, with minor chalcocite are the 

principal sulphide minerals of the shallower portions of the Red Chris deposit.  Minor 

covellite occurs as inclusions in pyrite, and molybdenite, sphalerite and galena occur 

locally in trace amounts.  Gold, second in economic importance to copper, occurs spatially 

and genetically associated with the copper mineralization'. 

23.3.3 Operations 

Exploitation of the Red Chris deposit is by openpit mining in 'two open pits (called) the 

Main and East pits'.  Later in the mine life these will be merged into one large pit.  Mining 

is by conventional shovel and truck feeding a 30,000 tpd processing plant in which standard 

mineral flotation technology is used.  'The mine has been phased and scheduled to

maximize the production of high-grade ore, especially during the first five years, to 

minimize the capital payback period'.  Waste rock, depending on the neutralizing potential 

to acid generating potential ratio, is stockpiled as PAG or NAG waste rock.  NAG waste 

rock is reported to be used as base below the PAG rock storage area, as road topping 

material and as a general construction material. 

23.4 Schaft Creek Deposit 

The Schaft Creek property is approximately 60 km south of Telegraph Creek, 45 km due west of 

Highway 37 and approximately 375 km northwest of the town of Smithers, B.C.  The following 

text comprises abstracts from Bender et.al. (2007, amended and restated in 2010), which have been 

modified for the sake of brevity. 

'The Schaft Creek deposit is situated in the valley of Schaft Creek along the western slope of Mount 

LaCasse' in which Stuhini group volcanics are exposed.   'The deposit is bounded to the west by 

the Hickman batholith and to the east by volcanic rocks of the Mess Lake facies'.  It: 

 comprises 'a large, multi-phase, complex, porphyry copper-molybdenum-gold-silver system 
consisting of three distinct, semi-continuous and structurally modified zones genetically 

related to the Hickman batholith'….that 'is considered to be the source of the magmatic-

hydrothermal fluids, which ultimately formed the mineralized breccias, veins and stockworks 

of the deposit'; 

 'is hosted by north striking, steep, easterly dipping volcanic rocks comprised of a package of 
andesitic pyroclastics ranging from tuff to breccia tuff and aphanitic to augite-feldspar-phyric 

andesite' ('narrow, discontinuous feldspar porphyry and quartz feldspar porphyry dikes, 

related to the Hickman batholith, intrude the volcanic package'); and 

 'is bounded to the west by the Hickman batholith and to the east by volcanic rocks of the Mess 
Lake facies'.  

The deposition of sulphides is considered (by Copper Fox Metals Inc.) to be 'the result of a 

complex polyphase series of mineralizing events.  Macroscopic determinations on the Copper Fox 

drill core define the deposit's sulphide mineral composition as: chalcopyrite (50%), pyrite 

(22.8%), bornite (14.2%) and molybdenite (13%)'.  Chalcopyrite and bornite, the most essential 

copper ore minerals, occur in stockworks, as disseminations and in breccias.  Less commonly, 

chalcopyrite is observed as very thin (10-100 micron) partial coatings on ubiquitous, dm spaced 

fractures and joints'.  Molybdenite '…occurs as disseminated blebs and stringers in stockworks 

and veins and is quite common in the breccia zones.  Quite often it forms thin coatings on 

slickensides and fractures'. 

23.5 North ROK Deposit 

The North ROK property is a recently discovered deposit that is located near Highway 37, 

approximately 190 km north of Stewart, 67 km south of Dease Lake and 15 km north-northwest 

of Red Chris porphyry Cu-Au deposit.  The following text comprises abstracts from Giroux and 

Rebagliati (2014), which have been modified for the sake of brevity. 

The North ROK property 'is underlain by volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Upper Triassic, 

Stuhini Group to Lower Jurassic, Hazelton Group, that are intruded by Upper Triassic to Early 

Jurassic stocks and dykes. Auriferous pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization is associated with the

intrusive rocks'.  Exploration has focused on the large Mabon mineralized alteration zone that 

encompasses the historic Mabon and Edon Cu-Au occurrences.  Other historic occurrences on the 

property include HI or Klappan Rose and Plateau. 

'The Mabon Zone represents 'an Upper Triassic alkalic porphyry Cu-Au system, where 

mineralization is predominately hosted in an elongate, 3,000 m x 1,000 m fine-grained, quartz 

deficient plagioclase phyric monzodiorite intrusion (the Mabon Stock) (that is dated) at 215.8 +/- 

3 Ma. The Mabon Stock and enclosing volcanic rocks are imprinted by a well-defined zoned 

hydrothermal and contact metamorphic alteration assemblage.  The alteration zones from: (high 

temperature) potassic alteration to quartz-pyrite (phyllic) to epidote to chlorite (low 

temperature)'.  'A well-developed early biotite hornfels alteration assemblage is documented in 

the volcanic rocks along the northeastern flank of Mabon Stock.  Copper and gold mineralization, 

as disseminated and vein-hosted chalcopyrite, has been identified by diamond drilling over a strike 

length of 900 m at the Mabon Zone'. 

23.6 Galore Creek Deposit 

The Galore Creek project is located approximately 70 km west of the Quinn Lake airstrip on 

Highway 37, 150 km northeast of the Port of Stewart and 370 km northwest of the town of 

Smithers, B.C.  The following text comprises abstracts from Gill et al. (2011), which have been 

modified for the sake of brevity. 

'The Galore Creek property is interpreted to be an example of an alkalic porphyry copper–gold–

silver system'.   It is… 'situated within the Stikine Terrane, an exotic terrane accreted to the 

ancestral North American craton.  A sequence of Permian, Mississippian and Devonian age calc-

alkaline and bimodal flows and volcaniclastic rocks, interbedded carbonate and minor shale and 

chert, termed the Stikine assemblage, form the basement of the terrane.  Unconformably overlying 

the Stikine assemblage is a succession of Lower to Middle Triassic sedimentary and upper Triassic 

volcanic rocks'.  

'The Galore Creek Syenite Complex, of Tertiary age, is centered in the west fork of Galore Creek 

and is (five kilometres in length and two kilometres) in width.  The deposits are hosted by 

potassium-enriched volcanic rocks and pipe-like breccias adjacent to syenite stocks and dykes.  

They are manto-shaped and trend north to northeast, following either, or both, syenite contacts 

and structural breaks.  To date, 14 deposits and prospects have been identified, five of which, the 

Central Zone, Southwest Zone, Junction Zone West Fork Zone and Middle Creek Zone are of 

economic interest'.   

'The Galore Creek property has undergone at least three temporally different mineralizing events.  

These include the early formation of the nearby Copper Canyon eruptive centre and its associated 

mineralization; deposition of the Central Zone mineralization at the Central and Junction deposits, 

and Butte prospect; and emplacement of the West Fork mineralization at the Southwest and West 

Fork deposits'.  

'Bornite and generally higher-grade gold are developed in the intense potassic alteration zone, 

and are associated with magnetite and sparse pyrite.  Within the propylitic zone, zones of moderate 

potassic alteration have developed, and have associated chalcopyrite and pyrite mineralization.  

External to these potassic zones, but still within the propylitic zone, replacement lodes of gold, 

silver and base metals have formed'.

23.7 KSM Deposit 

The KSM project is named for the Kerr, Sulphurets and Mitchell deposits found on the KSM 

property.  It is located in northwest B.C., off Highway 37, approximately 68 km by air north-

northwest of Stewart, B.C. and approximately 21 km south-southeast of the historic Eskay Creek 

Mine.  The following text comprises abstracts from Ghaffari et al. (2016), which have been 

modified for the sake of brevity. 

'The property lies within an area known as Stikinia, which is a terrain consisting of Triassic and 

Jurassic volcanic arcs that were accreted onto the Paleozoic basement.  Early Jurassic sub-

volcanic intrusive complexes are scattered through the Stikinia terrain and are host to numerous 

precious and base metal rich hydrothermal systems'. 

'The Kerr deposit is a strongly-deformed Cu-Au porphyry, where copper and gold grades have 

been upgraded due to remobilization of metals during later and/or possibly syn-intrusive 

deformation. Alteration is the result of a relatively shallow, long lived hydrothermal system 

generated by intrusion of monzonite.  Subsequent deformation along the Sulphurets Thrust Fault 

(STF) was diverted into the Kerr area along pre-existing structures. The mineralized area forms 

a fairly continuous, north-south trending west dipping irregular body measuring about 1,700 m 

long and up to 200 m thick'. 

'The Sulphurets deposit is comprised of two distinct zones referred to as the Raewyn CopperGold 

Zone and the Breccia Gold Zone. The Raewyn Copper-Gold Zone hosts mostly porphyry style 

disseminated chalcopyrite and associated gold mineralization in moderately quartz stockworked, 

chlorite-biotite-sericite-magnetite altered volcanics. The Raewyn Copper-Gold Zone strikes 

north-easterly and dips about 45° to the northwest. The Breccia Gold Zone hosts mostly gold-

bearing pyritic material mineralization with minor chalcopyrite and sulfosalts in a potassium-

feldspar-siliceous hydrothermal breccia that apparently crosscuts the Raewyn Copper-Gold Zone. 

The Breccia Gold Zone strikes north and dips to the west'.  

'The Mitchell Zone….is underlain by foliated, schistose, intrusive, volcanic, and clastic rocks that 

are exposed in an erosional window below the shallow north dipping Mitchell Thrust Fault (MTF). 

These rocks tend to be intensely altered and characterized by abundant sericite and pyrite with 

numerous quartz stockwork veins and sheeted quartz veins (phyllic alteration) that are often 

deformed and flattened.  Towards the west end of the zone, the extent and intensity of phyllic 

alteration diminishes and chlorite-magnetite alteration becomes more dominant along with lower 

contained metal grades.  In the core of the zone, pyrite content ranges between 1 to 20%, averages 

5%, and typically occurs as fine disseminations.  Gold and copper tends to be relatively low-grade 

but is dispersed over a very large area and related to hydrothermal activity associated with Early 

Jurassic hypabyssal porphyritic intrusions. In general, within the currently drilled limits of the 

Mitchell Zone, gold and copper grades are remarkably consistent between drill holes, which is 

common with large, stable, and long-lived hydrothermal systems'.

25 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 

In the opinion of the Principal Author, the financial outcomes of the PEA reflect a robust project 

that should be advanced to the pre-feasibility level of project development.   

The project undoubtedly benefits from existing infrastructure that includes Highway 37 and the 

Northwest Transmission Line, both of which are located to the immediate east of the Project Area, 

as well as Willow Creek Road that extends to within approximately 10 km of the planned location 

of the processing plant (approximate straightline distance).  Access to the Project Area is in 

consequence straightforward and the capital cost associated with bringing mains power to an 

otherwise remote site is reduced to the need for a 33 km long powerline to the planned location of 

the MIA, from a take-off sub-station located at the turn-off of Willow Creek Road from Highway 

37.  The proximity of the Port of Stewart also enhances the project, insofar as it is an established 

deep water port from where the planned, bulk Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate could be shipped to markets 

located in the Far East.  The Port of Stewart is approximately 262 km by road, from the Highway 

37 turnoff to Willow Creek Road. 

The project also benefits from the staged approach to plant throughput hence mine production 

which, in combination with the infrastructure benefits described above, result in a low pre-

production capital requirement of C$216.05 million.  Significant capital can be and has been 

deferred to the benefit of project economics, which in part is achieved through the PEA planning 

process that encompasses considerations of the types of practical, physical and operational risks 

that are inherent to any new, start-up operation (a wealth of global mining experience shows that 

lengthy lead times are invariably required before such risks can be overcome and optimal results 

can routinely and sustainably be achieved, especially with greenfield projects).  In combination, 

these and related issues form a central objective of the PEA: to engineer solutions that ensure 

practicably achievable and environmentally sustainable outcomes. 

It should be emphasized that the financial outcomes of the PEA are strongly dependent on metal 

prices: analysis shows that significant upside or downside variance from the nested, base case 

prices for gold (US$1,250 / oz Au) and copper (C$2.75 / lb Cu) result in significantly different 

NPV, IRR and payback period outcomes.  Various other risks (apart from metal prices) and a 

number of opportunities are identified in the following sections, based on the results of the PEA 

studies reported in this Technical Report.  Mitigation of the risks and assessment of the 

opportunities form the basis for the surveys and studies recommended in Section 26, the principal 

objective of which is to support the project through to completion of a pre-feasibility study. 

While further assessments and studies are required, the mining and processing opportunities 

described below indicate that improvements to the project's economics could be realized through 

sustainable increases to the plant throughput during Production Stages 1 and 2 (10,000 tpd and 

20,000 tpd, respectively), and that the life of project could be extended beyond the 25 years 

planned within the scope of the PEA. 

25.1 General 

It is established in Section 5.5 that no specific plans concerning mining, process, potable and fire 

water supplies have been formulated within the scope of the PEA, based on the reasonable 

assumption that sufficient water resources could be secured from a combination of waterwells and 

runoff.  While this does not necessarily present a project risk (there are abundant water resources 

available across the general Project Area), a formal waterwell location study, pumping test

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

program and other hydrogeologic studies are required to prove-up a robust and sufficient supply, 

inclusive of considerations of water balances and water recycling. 

It is established in Section 4.4 that no restrictions as regards access to the Property Area or access 

within and across the Property Area exist.  There is, however, a risk that Highway 37 might be 

closed during periods of adverse weather, but to the best knowledge and understanding of the 

Principal Author, the longest period of road closure to date (March 2017) has been approximately 

100 hours, for reasons of avalanche control. 

It is established in Section 4.9 that three sides of the Spectrum claims block, portions of the western 

margin of the North Block of GJ claims and portions of the Nuttlude Group of claims are bounded 

by Mount Edziza Provincial Park.  This does not represent a significant risk that will affect access, 

title or right or ability to perform planned future work on the property because: 

 an access corridor to the Spectrum claim blocks has been established in line with regional land 

management plan (CIS LRMP); and 

 exploration and mining development are allowable activities within the Area-Specific 

Management zones of the CIS LRMP, where the Project Area is located.      

It is established in Section 18.10 that periodic, Northwest Transmission Line power outages occur.  

Such outages would impinge on production flow-through in the plant, hence project economics.  

This risk has been mitigated within the scope of the PEA by the inclusion of a 1.3 MW diesel-

powered emergency generator and distribution facility at the MIA.  Power consumption rates and 

emergency power back-up requirements need to be more closely assessed at the pre-feasibility 

level of project development. 

25.2 First Nations and Heritage 

It is established in Section 4.9 that the Project Area lies within the asserted traditional territory of 

the Tahltan Nation, throughout which Tahltan Nation people have historically and extensively 

travelled.  The Company respects this, as well as the Tahltan's collective right to hunt, fish, trap, 

harvest berries and other food and medicinal plants. 

The Company also respects the importance of heritage and archaeological sites to the Tahltan 

Nation.  The Company has carried out AIAs within the Project Area and will continue 

implementation of the Tahltan Archaeological Chance Find Procedure going forward.  The 

Company also recognizes that AIAs will be required at the appropriate time or times, as the Project 

is advanced towards the construction phase (see also Section 25.4). 

The Company has committed to work closely with the TCG and its agencies, to which end the 

Company has signed a Communications Agreement with TCG that provides guidance for on-going 

discussions and engagement related to economic opportunities, as well as dialogue to ensure 

wildlife, environment and heritage values are readily identified and considered.  The Company 

will also continue to identify and maximize employment and contracting opportunities with 

Tahltan Nation-owned businesses, as the Project advances through the planned mineral exploration 

and project development activities.

25.3 Environmental and Permitting 

It is established in Section 20.2 that no significant environmental risks have been identified that 

could prevent the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project from advancing to the next phase of development 

towards becoming an operating mine.  However, projections of environmental and community 

matters, their associated costs and permitting schedule, are subject to a number of known and 

unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially 

from those presented herein.  These risks include: 

 projections as to permitting time lines, timing and conditions of permits required to initiate 
mine construction, and potential delays in the issuance of permits; and 

 changes to government regulation of mining operations, environmental issues, permitting 
requirements and social risks; or 

 unrecognized environmental, permitting and social risks, title disputes or claims.  

25.4 Infrastructure 

It is established in Section 18 that AIAs will be required across the planned infrastructure areas 

and that if one or more of the infrastructure locations coincides with an area identified as an 

archaeological site, infrastructure planning will have to be modified unless an SAP could be 

secured under Section 12 of the Heritage Conservation Act (as described in Section 4.9).  

Geotechnical studies and geohazard assessments are also required to ensure that the infrastructure 

locations are both suitable and sustainable over the life of the project.  If risks are identified that 

cannot be mitigated using reasonable and sustainable measures, changes to the planned 

infrastructure will have to be made. 

25.5 Mineral Resources 

It is stated in Section 14.1 that the quantities and average grades of the stated 2017 Mineral 

Resource updates are for grade cut-offs of 0.40 g/t AuEq for Central Zone and 0.20% CuEq for 

the Donnelly Deposit.  Changes to the metal prices and/or the metallurgical recovery rates and/or 

the operating costs assumed in analysis will change these grade cut-offs, with the result that the 

quantities and average grades of the stated Mineral Resources will also change.  The reasonable 

prospects of economic extraction of the stated Mineral Resources might also materially be affected 

by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, sociopolitical, marketing or other relevant 

issues.  While the latter may be construed as risks, the former (changes to the cut-off grades) may 

be construed as either a risk or an opportunity, depending on whether each influencing parameter 

(metal prices, recovery rates and operating costs) go up or down.  As regards metallurgical 

recovery rates, the opportunities listed within the scope of Section 25.3 should be emphasized. 

It is also stated in Section 14.1 that the quantity and grade of the Inferred Mineral Resources that 

form part of the 2017 Mineral Resource updates that are the subject of this Technical Report are 

conceptual in nature.  As regards the notionally extracted material from the planned pits, it is 

established in Section 16.13 that: 

 24% of the ROM material from Spectrum Pit is in the Inferred category of Mineral Resources, 

with the balance (76%) in the Indicated category; and 

 4% of the ROM material from Donnelly Pit is in the Inferred category, with the balance (96%) 

again being in the Indicated category.

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

The Company acknowledges that Inferred Mineral Resources have to be treated as waste, within 

the scope of pre-feasibility mine planning and production scheduling.  The drilling program 

described in Section 26.2 is in part planned to elevate the Inferred Mineral Resources to the 

Indicated category. 

25.6 Mining 

Table 25.1 summarizes the mining and production risks identified within the scope of the PEA.  

Table 25.2 summarizes the identified opportunities, the production rate elements of which should 

be considered within the scope of the opportunity to increase plant throughput during Stages 1 and 

2, as identified in Section 25.6. 

Table 25.1 Mining and Production Risks, Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

Risk Area Comments 

Spectrum Pit 

Pit access road 

A preliminary pit mid-point access road has been planned for 

purposes of the PEA, the alignment of which includes a number of 

switchbacks.  While the size of the production equipment for 

Spectrum Pit has been limited to accommodate this constraint, options 

and risk analyses are required before an elevated level of confidence 

can be attributed to the design. 

Muck Handling 

The muck handling system assumed within the scope of the PEA is on 

the limit of practicability, in terms of the raisebore, gravity fed muck 

handling system.  Options analysis is required to improve the level of 

confidence in the muck handling system that might have to comprise 

staged handling in two, sequential muck passes.  This change will 

affect overall capital requirement for Spectrum Pit. 

Primary crushing 

It has been assumed within the scope of the PEA that ROM muck 

from Spectrum Pit will not require primary crushing ahead of loading 

the material into B-Train trucks for transport to the MIA for blending 

and processing with ROM material from Donnelly Pit.  This requires 

closer analysis and confirmation. 

Pit slopes and clay 

Preliminary analysis indicates that a significant fault zone extends 

across the central portion of Central Zone and might intersect 

Spectrum Pit.  Preliminary analysis of weathering profiles suggests 

the fault zone might be the locus of preferential insitu alteration of 

weathering-prone alteration mineralogies to produce clay.  This needs 

to be more closely examined as the presence of significant amounts of 

clay might compromise both local slope stability and flotation 

efficiency in the plant. 

Donnelly Pit Primary Crusher 

Highly silicified material is known to exist in parts of the Donnelly 

Deposit (i.e. material from the Strongly to Intensely Silicified Domain 

identified in Section 7.6).  Such material can compromise the 

efficiency and maintenance of gyratory crushers, unless they are 

specifically designed to accommodate such material.  Analyses of the 

distribution and timing of such material within the ROM production 

stream is required to enable appropriate assessments and risk 

mitigation plans to be devised. 

Spectrum Pit Weather 

There is no readily identifiable reason to suppose that with the 

exception of periods of extreme weather, mine production activities 

could not continue year round.  Occasional and minor snow 

avalanches could, however, affect production activities in the planned 

Spectrum Pit.   

Donnelly Pit Weather 
Klastline Plateau is known to suffer occasional severe winds that 

could impinge on in-pit productivity during storm events.

Improve 

stripping ratio 
Donnelly Pit 

Within the scope of the PEA, average overall pit slope angles of 45° 

are assumed for both pits, based on the results of a preliminary 

geotechnical study.  It might be possible to increase the overall slope 

angle at Donnelly Pit in particular, depending on the results of a 

detailed geotechnical study. 

Increase 

Production 

Rates 

Spectrum Pit 

For purposes of the PEA the production rate was fixed at 5,000 tpd.  

This needs to be more closely assessed as it could increase, depending 

on the ultimate size of pit and the ease of access for equipment up the 

mountain slope/along the pit access road. 

Donnelly Pit 

Following an initial period of a year to 18 months, the reasonable 

expectation is that ROM production from Donnelly Pit could 

outperform the PEA production schedule during Stage 1 and 2.  This 

needs to be more closely considered, especially as regards sustainable 

plant throughput capacities.  

Extend Life of 

Project 

Spectrum Pit 

For purposes of the PEA, Spectrum Pit has been limited in size, hence 

life, due to a number of practical, technical and operational issues that 

are described in Section16.  These need to be closely examined to 

establish whether above cut-off material to the south of the PEA pit 

could safely and sustainably be mined. 

Donnelly Pit 

For purposes of the PEA, Donnelly Pit was limited to the north along 

an arbitrary boundary with the North Donnelly deposit.  As Donnelly 

Deposit and the North Donnelly deposit are contiguous along at least 

some of their lengths, the opportunity exists to extend the planned 

Donnelly Pit into the North Donnelly deposit. 

Both Pits 
Goodbye cuts are possible in both pits.  This is not considered within 

the scope of the PEA. 

Underground mining 

Scrutiny of the block models for both Central Zone and Donnelly 

Deposit indicate high-grade zones beneath the planned pits.  These 

might be amenable to selective underground mining via low CAPEX 

access from either the planned muck handling infrastructure and/or 

the mined pits. 

 

25.7 Metallurgy and Mineral Processing 

Table 25.3 summarizes the metallurgical and process flow risks identified within the scope of the 

PEA.  Table 25.4 summarizes the identified opportunities to which the following comments apply: 

 the plant throughput elements should be considered within the scope of the opportunity to 
increase the ROM production rates during Stages 1 and 2, as described in Section 25.5; and 

 the metallurgical recovery and cost elements should be considered within the scope of the 
potential Mineral Resource base for the Spectrum Cu-Au Project, as well as the potential 

financial outcomes – the former would increase and the latter would improve on the back of 

enhanced copper and gold metallurgical recovery rates.

Table 25.3 Metallurgical and Process Flow Risks, Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 
(compiled from information supplied by Blue Coast Metallurgy) 

Risk Area Comments 

Sampling Sample representivity 

Sample selection has been done to a level of representivity 

commensurate with a preliminary study, while the forecasted 

metallurgy is entirely driven by test results based on these samples.  

There is, therefore, potential for changes in metallurgy arising from 

the testing of more samples. 

Mineralogy 
Central Zone arsenic 

content 

Parts of the Central Zone are known to be enriched in arsenic, but the 

current testwork did not show this to be evident in the Cu-Au-(Ag) 

concentrate from blended Central Zone/Donnelly Deposit material.  

This needs further checking as more material is tested from Central 

Zone. 

Testing 

Variability flotation and 

leach testing 

No variability flotation and leach testing has been carried out.  The 

potential for life-of-mine changes in metallurgical performance is 

unknown at this stage. 

Cyanide leaching 

Cyanide leaching of the gold-rich sulphide concentrates is not 

currently practiced in B.C. copper mines.  It is economic in this case 

due to very rapid gold leaching rates, but cyanide consumption rates 

are very high if longer leach times are needed.  Accordingly, gold 

leaching kinetics need to be fully confirmed, together with cyanide 

consumption kinetics. 

Concentrate dewatering 

No concentrate dewatering testing has been conducted on bulk Cu-

Au-(Ag) concentrate; dewatering performance is assumed within the 

scope of the PEA. 

SAG Mill 

Sizing 

The size of the SAG mill defined as part of the PEA should be 

considered preliminary as more testing is required before an optimum 

size can be defined.  However the staged approach proposed for the 

project, with crushing and ball milling in Stage 1, allows for 

opportunity for extra sampling and testing, and thereby specifically 

offers an opportunity to minimize SAG mill sizing risk. 

Testing 

No SAG testing has been carried out on Central Zone materials.  If 

they prove to be SAG resistant, it is possible that the cone crusher, 

that is off-line in Stage 2, might be needed to fine-crush this material 

ahead of feeding the SAG mill. 

Conversion 

Converting the circuit from two-stage crushing and ball milling to 

SAG milling in Year 6 needs further careful thought, to ensure 

minimum downtime during the tie-in period. 

Operation 

Au gravity concentrate 

Production of a refinery grade gravity concentrate during Stage 1 has 

been assumed for purposes of the PEA, but it has not been adequately 

demonstrated. 

Grizzley screening 

Two-stage grizzley screening ahead of primary crushing, as envisaged 

for Stage 1, needs careful design as this is not a conventional 

configuration and may add to the overall capital cost for the plant.

Opportunity Action Comments 

Increase 

tonnage 

throughput of 

planned plant 

Match production to 

SAG & ball mill 

capacities 

Most major equipment (SAG and ball mills) is sized for 30,000 tpd, 

leaving it potentially over-sized during Stages 1 (at 10,000 tpd) and 2 

(20,000 tpd).  Adjusting the mine production rate to match the 

capacity of this equipment should enhance project economics. 

Modify cone crusher 

duty 

Between Years 6 and 11 (i.e. during Stage 2), the cone crusher is off-

line.  Assigning the cone crusher for pebble crushing duty earlier 

could increase mill capacity long before Year 11, allowing for a ramp-

up in capacity during Stage 2 to approximately 22,000 tpd or even 

25,000 tpd for the planned process flow.  The ball mill may then 

become the bottleneck in the circuit, but running at a higher tonnage, 

coarser grind size and hence lower recovery (see below), might still 

be economic overall.  This needs to be assessed at the feasibility stage 

of project development. 

Increase Stage 1 

utilization 

Utilization in Stage 1 is assumed to be 92%, though typical primary 

ball mill and flotation circuits often achieve 95% to 96% utilizations.  

Once more confidence can be placed in the workability of running the 

circuit in two-stage crusher/ball mill configuration during Phase 1, 

95% utilization should be assumed. 

Reduce OPEX 

and CAPEX 

Coarsen primary grind 

Locked cycle tests at 85 and 120 microns showed a lower loss in 

recovery at 120 microns than expected.  If this trend continues, then 

the primary grind could be coarsened, thereby reducing upfront 

capital costs. 

Optimize regrind Regrind optimization should reduce regrinding costs. 

Improve 

desulphurization and 

leaching process 

Lower pH flotation in the copper roughers, if still allowing for 

production of saleable copper concentrates, will reduce operating 

costs and may allow for better pyrite recovery in the desulphurization 

float and the downstream gold recovery. 

Further testing of the leach process should enhance process economics 

by improving precious metal recoveries and/or reducing costs. 

Cyanide destruction costs are based on an assumed higher level of 

cyanide in the leach residue than likely would occur in practice. 

Accordingly there is potential for lower cyanide destruction costs. 

Improve Metal 

Recoveries 

Additional 

metallurgical testing 

Very little testing of the blended feed materials was carried out for 

purposes of the PEA.  The metallurgical forecast stated in Section 

13.5 is conservative as a result.  Further testing should lead to an 

improvement in overall performance. 

 

25.8 Waste and Water Management 

No significant opportunities as regards waste and water management have been identified.  Table 

25.5 summarizes the principal risks going forward.

Table 25.5 Water and Waste Management Risks, Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project 

Risk Area Comments 

Materials 
ML/ARD 

characterization 

Additional testing is required to enable NAG/PAG characterizations 

to be more closely defined than is (and could be) the case within the 

scope of the PEA. 

No information is available regarding the lag time to onset of acidic 

conditions or the associated water quality when that occurs.  Further 

work is required to develop rational plans for management of tailings, 

waste rock, marginal grade stockpiles, submerged waste rock, flooded 

pits and exposed pit walls. 

The sources, and timings of PAG material generation need to be 

established to identify disposal quantities and needs, as well as post-

closure risk mitigation measures as regards protection of the 

environment. 

The sources and quantities of NAG material need to be established to 

identify whether sufficient material is available at the right time or 

times to build the various infrastructure elements (dams, roads, etc) 

that require NAG material.  Depending on results, a quarry in which 

NAG material is extracted might be required, which eventuality was 

not considered within the scope of the PEA.   

Mineralogy 
Central Zone arsenic 

content 

As stated in Section 25.5, parts of the Central Zone are known to be 

enriched in arsenic, but the current testwork did not show this to be 

evident in the Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate from blended Central 

Zone/Donnelly Deposit material.   This may pose issues for TSF pond 

and seepage water.  Further study is required. 

Spectrum Pit 
Waste dump 

(constructed lake) 

The PEA design of the Spectrum waste dump for underwater disposal 

of PAG material is highly preliminary and provisional only, hence 

subject to change.  The required quantity of NAG material suitable for 

dam construction and more detailed topographic data of the local area 

are required. 

TSF Design 

The PEA design of the TSF and related infrastructure is preliminary 

and provisional only, hence subject to change.  More detailed 

estimates of quantities are required; design at the pre-feasibility stage 

of project development should meet or exceed the objectives set out in 

the Canadian Dam Association 2014 publication - Application of Dam 

Safety Guidelines to Mining Dams and BC MEM HSRC of July 2016.  

The overall cost of TSF construction might exceed the estimate 

assumed for purposes of the PEA. 

The presence of glacial-lacustrine units in the location of the planned 

tailings dam could significantly impact the design. 

Rehabilitation 

and Closure 
Bonding 

The C$56.23 million assumed for purposes of the PEA was based on 

the assumption that stockpiled marginal grade material at Donnelly Pit 

is processed at the end of the mine life, with the result that only some 

2.7 Mt has to be shoved back into the pit, using owner-operated 

equipment.  For purposes of bonding, the full amount of stockpiled 

material might have to be assumed to require disposal in the mined-

out pit, and at contractor rates.  This would increase the total amount 

of required bonding for the project to C$70 million or more (albeit 

that the portion relating to the marginal grade material would be 

refunded if such material was processed at the end of the mine life).

25.9 Marketing and Contracts 

The haulage costs, shipping costs, port charges and smelter terms stated in Section 19 should be 

considered preliminary and provisional, hence subject to change.  This is emphasized in part 

because of the likely long-lead time to production start-up could mean that the planned Cu-Au-

(Ag) concentrate might be marketed under conditions that differ from the assumptions and 

forecasts that support the PEA. 

The securing of expressions of interest and more detailed projections of marketing terms are 

recommended at the pre-feasibility level of project development.  The study should also 

encompass considerations of concentrate storage charges at the Port of Stewart.  For example, if 

concentrate shipments were made in 5,000 t lots, then at a ROM production throughput rate of 

30,000 tpd and depending on the mass pull, it would take between approximately 20 days and 27 

days of concentrate production to generate sufficient material to complete a shipment lot.  The cost 

of concentrate storage has not been included within the scope of the PEA, not least because of 

uncertainty about the quantity that could be stored at site prior to its batch-transport to the Port of 

Stewart. 

It should also be emphasized that only limited analyses of potentially deleterious elements in the 

planned Cu-Au-(Ag) concentrate have been carried out within the scope of the PEA.  While no 

deleterious elements were found, this needs to be more closely examined.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Various surveys, studies and programs are recommended in this Technical Report to support a pre-

feasibility study and to enable the risks and opportunities summarized in Section 25 to be mitigated 

and/or assessed, as appropriate.  The various recommendations relate to the capture of baseline 

data, resolution of various technical and operational issues, and optimization of production rates, 

plant throughputs, metallurgical recovery rates and the life of project that could extend beyond the 

25 years planned within the scope of the PEA.  Summaries of the recommendations are presented 

in the following sections. 

Table 26.1 summarizes the estimated costs that total C$16.0 million over two years, inclusive of: 

a 10% contingency; the estimated cost of a pre-feasibility study, beyond the recommended studies 

and programs summarized below; and environmental baseline studies (although not required for 

purposes of a pre-feasibility study, the undertaking, in parallel, of the first two years of baseline 

studies is recommended to preclude delays in advancing the project to the Environmental 

Assessment ["EA"] and permitting stages).  The EA and Permitting elements of project 

development will cost an estimated C$3.24 million, inclusive of disbursements and over the 

timelines detailed in Section 20.8.  An additional C$0.5 million has been assumed following 

completion of the pre-feasibility study, to cover the possibility of additional environmental 

baseline data being required.

26.1 Database 

It is established in Section 12.2 that data verification was hampered by the assay certificates not 

consistently reflecting the priority-based assay shown in the Company's database, by which the 

most reliable analytical method is used.  It is in consequence of this that QP Thomas recommended 

that:

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 the Company's database structure is modified so that the final assays relate to the appropriate 
certificate number; and 

 all the historical data is verified against the source documents. 

It is stated in Section 12.5 that although the percentage of the Company's overall database that was 

verified (and was found to) exceed industry standards, it is recommended (by QP Thomas) that the 

entire assay database is verified going forward.  The tasks outlined can be completed internally, 

by Company staff.  No direct cost has, therefore, been estimated for purposes of budgeting. 

26.2 Drilling and Mineral Resources 

It is established in Section 16.13 that 76% of the notionally mined material from Spectrum Pit is 

in the Indicated category of Mineral Resources, with the balance (24%) falling in the Inferred 

category.  Similarly, 96% of the notionally mined material from Donnelly Pit is in the Indicated 

category of Mineral Resources, with the balance (4%) falling in the Inferred category.  It is further 

established that the life of project could be extended by mining material contiguous to the 

notionally mined pits (to the south in the case of Spectrum Pit and to the north in the case of 

Donnelly pit, in the North Donnelly deposit). 

The Company acknowledges that Inferred Mineral Resources have to be treated as waste, within 

the scope of pre-feasibility mine planning and production scheduling, and that opportunities exist 

to extend the project life beyond the 25 years planned for purposes of the PEA.  To these ends, the 

Company has developed a definition drilling program to increase confidence in the Mineral 

Resource estimates by: 

 elevating approximately 10% of the higher grade material, targeted for early extraction in both 
Spectrum Pit and Donnelly Pit, to the Measured category of Mineral Resources; 

 elevating the balance of material within the overall, planned pit envelopes to the Indicated 
category; and 

 elevating a targeted portion of the Mineral Resources within the North Donnelly deposit to the 
Indicated category of Mineral Resources. 

To achieve the above, the Company has defined a C$6.18 M drilling program, inclusive of 4,200 

m of drilling in 50 holes on the Central Zone and 15,000 m in 200 holes on the Donnelly Deposit 

and a portion of the North Donnelly deposit.  Based on 2016 drilling costs, the all-in cost (inclusive 

of drilling, sampling, geology, analytical, camp and transportation costs) of drilling on Central 

Zone is estimated at C$400 per metre; the all-in cost of drilling on the Donnelly Deposit and North 

Donnelly deposit is estimated at C$300 per metre.  The lower unit cost at Donnelly is due to the 

more subdued terrain and the ability to minimize helicopter costs and drill-pad construction by 

using a rubber-track, self-powered drillrig and ATVs for low-impact access. 

It should be emphasized that the drilling program outlined is subject to change, depending on the 

optimization and trade-off mining studies described below (Section 26.4).  For example, if a larger 

Spectrum Pit than planned for purposes of the PEA is ultimately defined, additional drilling (hence 

a second-season program) will be required.  In the case of the North Donnelly deposit, the exact 

drilling requirements will only be known once pit optimization studies are completed and the exact 

volume of North Donnelly material that could be profitably mined through an extension of the 

planned Donnelly Pit is known.  As such, the C$6.18M program should be considered a best

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

estimate rather than a definitive program.  It should also be emphasized that, for the reasons 

described in Section 10.7, it is recommended that within the scope of the Central Zone drilling 

program, opportunities for changing drilling directions and dips into the high-grade zone should 

be reviewed and implemented, as appropriate. 

Once the drilling programs outlined are completed, to support a pre-feasibility study it is 

recommended that Mineral Resource updates are compiled for both Central Zone and the 

Donnelly/North Donnelly Deposit.  The estimated cost for the Mineral Resource updates is 

C$100,000. 

26.3 Metallurgical Testing and Process Design 

A metallurgical testwork program has been developed to support a pre-feasibility study for the 

Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project (see Table 26.2).  The total budget is C$584,000 and the program 

duration is estimated at six months.  Process engineering will in addition be required, at an 

estimated cost of C$250,000. 

The quantities of metallurgical samples required for the pre-feasibility study, as detailed on Table 

26.2 will, to the extent that is possible and practicable, be sourced from the planned drilling 

program outlined in Section 26.2.  For purposes of budgeting, an additional C$500,000 has been 

assumed for drilling large diameter (PQ) holes, specifically for purposes of metallurgical sampling.

26.4 Geohazards and Geotechnical 

It is established in Section 16 that the following data collection, analysis and modelling programs 

are required to support a pre-feasibility for the Spectrum-GJ Cu-Au Project: 

 geohazard assessments across both pit areas and across the planned infrastructure locations 
described in Section 18; 

 determinations of the profile hence volume of Domain 2a material at Central Zone;

SKEENA RESOURCES LIMITED 

 structural mapping and three-dimensional structural modelling to separately identify the 
locations and orientations of faults, hence the principal discontinuity trends, at the two deposits 

of interest; 

 three-dimensional modelling of weathering/oxidation profiles to identify the locations and 
continuities of weathered zones below the surface oxidation zone at the two deposits of interest; 

 discontinuity mapping over a large area as practicably possible to thereby develop a robust 
database of orientated discontinuity data; 

 laboratory testing of the dominant rock types to identify their average strengths, along with 
laboratory testing of the dominant discontinuity types to determine their average shear 

strengths; and 

 hydrogeological testing to assess groundwater conditions around and within the planned pits, 
as well as pit inflow rates hence pumping requirements and capacities.  

Once the required data is in place, data consolidation, structural analyses, slope stability analyses 

and slope profile designs will be required, for inclusion in the mine planning and design elements 

of the pre-feasibility study.  For this reason, it is recommended that the data collection, data 

analysis and geotechnical design programs summarized above are started in Year One, for 

completion early in Year Two.  The duration of the data capture program is estimated at six 

months, with an additional three months required for the data consolidation, analysis and design 

elements.  

Table 26.3 summarizes the estimated costs for each study element, not including the cost of a 

geohazard study and hydrogeological testing that are covered under the environmental baseline 

studies discussed in Section 26.9.  Domain 2a profiling includes 250 m of drilling, at an estimated 

all-in cost of C$400 per metre, in addition to the resource drilling program described in Section 

26.2.

 trade-off studies concerning the maximum size of Spectrum Pit that can safely and sustainably 
be achieved, inclusive of considerations of top access (to the local mountain top), the 

geohazards and geotechnical constraints identified per the studies summarized in Section 26.4; 

 production rate optimization for Spectrum Pit, inclusive of considerations of pit access and the 
size of equipment that can safely be moved to the pit area; 

 material handling trade-off and design studies from Spectrum Pit to the SIA, and from the SIA 
to the MIA, including considerations of belt conveyances, trucking and a raisebore muck 

handling system; 

 options analyses concerning the maximum size of Donnelly Pit that can sustainably be 
achieved by mining into the North Donnelly deposit; and 

 trade-off studies concerning the economic viability of higher-/high grade zones accessible 
either from the mined pits or through extensions to the planned muck handing systems (adits), 

if these are ultimately decided upon. 

Table 26.4 summarizes the estimated costs of the trade-off, optimization and options analysis 

studies summarized above.  The following comments apply: 

 the trade-off studies related to Spectrum Pit sizing can start in Year One with considerations 
of the required pit access roads, the studies can then be completed in Year Two, once the 

required geohazard and geotechnical information is available (the pit access road element will 

also form the basis for the production optimization study for Spectrum Pit); 

 finalization of the resource drilling requirements on the North Donnelly deposit will to a large 
extent be driven by the amount of material that can economically be extracted in an expanded 

Donnelly Pit - options analysis for determining the largest practicable and sustainable Donnelly 

Pit is, therefore, costed for completion early in Year One; 

 the trade-off studies related to selective underground mining beneath the mined openpits is 
costed for completion across Years One and Two – 

o preliminary analyses can be completed using the 2017 block models used for estimating 
the Mineral Resources that are the subject of this Technical Report, and the designs can be 

finalized using the Mineral Resource updates recommended on the back of the resource 

drilling programs, and 

o it is assumed that the results will be identified only as upside potential (with preliminary 
designs) within the scope of the recommended pre-feasibility study; 

 the overall duration of the mine planning and design program is estimated at six months.

26.6 Infrastructure 

The following are recommended in Sections 5.9 and 18, as regards baseline and supporting studies 

for the planned infrastructure: 

 confirmation drilling at the key infrastructure locations; 

 AIAs across those areas covered by the planned infrastructure; 

 geotechnical studies, soil and vegetation characterizations and geohazard assessments, as 
appropriate for the key infrastructure areas; 

 suitable waterwell siting, pumping and drawdown studies designed to identify and prove-up 
water resources suitable to sustain the planned operations and camp facilities, inclusive of 

considerations of water balances and water recycling; 

 hydrogeologic studies in and around the planned pit areas to establish pit dewatering 
requirements and pumping capacities; and 

 a location-specific seismicity risk assessment for application in infrastructure design, and 
especially the TSF, as appropriate. 

The required AIAs, soil and vegetation characterizations, geohazard assessments and pit site 

hydrogeological studies are primarily included within the scope of the Year 1 environmental 

baseline studies discussed in Section 26.8.  The hydrogeological program, considered and costed 

within the scope of the environmental studies and assessment, includes a groundwater model; the 

hydrology study encompasses water quality data.  This data will be used to inform the required 

waterwell siting, pumping and drawdown studies.  An additional C$100,000 has been assumed for 

follow-on studies and detailed designs of water supply and distribution for the planned operations 

and camp. 

For budgeting purposes, a total of 2,000 m of confirmation drilling has been assumed, at an all-in 

unit cost of C$300 per metre (total C$600,000), along with C$250,000 for geotechnical site 

investigations at key infrastructure locations.  The required seismic risk assessment forms part of 

the TSF design cost estimate. 

26.7 TSF and Spectrum Waste Dump Design 

For budgeting purposes, an all-in cost of C$400,000 has been assumed for the design of a TSF that 

meets or exceeds the objectives set out in the Canadian Dam Association 2014 publication - 

Application of Dam Safety Guidelines to Mining Dams and BC MEM HSRC of July 2016.  The

cost estimate includes field work (test pits, drilling and oversight), laboratory testwork, a seismic 

risk assessment and the following design considerations: the tailings disposal lines; the dam, the 

TSF lining (as required), the by-pass ditches and the polishing pond.  An additional C$75,000 has 

been assumed for the design of the Spectrum waste dump, as described in Section 20.4.  The 

required hydrology and geohydrology elements are included in the environmental baseline studies 

described in Section 26.8. 

26.8 Marketing and Contracts 

It is recommended in Section 19.6 that to both support more detailed project studies and ensure 

stable and reliable sales: 

 that expressions of interest or letters of intent supported by cost estimates from haulage 
contractors, Port of Stewart and potential shipping lines are sought; 

 more detailed projections of marketing terms are prepared, based on major custom-smelting 
companies in the world that are logistically practical for the delivery of concentrates; and 

 that as a minimum and to support more detailed project studies, expressions of interest or letters 
of intent from smelters are sought. 

None of the tasks outlined above are especially onerous in terms of cost.  With the addition of 

metal price and exchange rate forecasting, a nominal C$50,000 has been assumed for budgeting 

purposes. 

26.9 Environmental 

The following baseline studies are recommended in Section 20.1: 

 a formal meteorological monitoring study that, as a minimum, should include year-round 
collection of site-specific data to ensure a robust dataset; 

 a terrain and soil study including, considerations of terrain distribution, soil quantity and 
distribution of soil types, as well as surface soil sampling;  

 site-specific geochemistry data collection of all mined materials with the potential to generate 
ML/ARD for predictions and preparation of management plans, including the following - 

o additional work on carbonate (and feldspar) mineralogy and reactivity for both the Central 
Zone and Donnelly Deposit, 

o development of a composite sulphide and lithological block model from which the timings 
and quantities of different materials can reasonably be identified within the scope of the 

production schedules for the planned openpits, 

o initiation of kinetic testing (e.g., humidity cells and/or field barrels) on key litho-alteration 
units, and 

o further assessment of waste segregation of PAG vs NAG rock, which may include the 
development of site-specific sorting criteria; 

 a hydrology monitoring program that should include year-round data collection from 
hydrometric stations in streams potentially affected by the proposed mine plan and -

o characterize and document current streamflow conditions, including the potential for 
channel instabilities and bed load transport processes, 

o provide a means of determining and assessing hydrological changes related to the project, 
for comparison against regional long-term hydrometric data from Water Survey of Canada 

hydrometric stations, and 

o prediction of extreme flow events for design of ditches, spillways and water-crossings; 

 a comprehensive/robust surface water quality monitoring program with sample sites located 
throughout the Project Area, with parameters that meet current guidelines and a minimum of 

monthly sampling with additional weekly sampling during periods of maximum hydrograph 

fluctuation (high flow and low flow);  

 an expanded and robust groundwater quality monitoring program for the Project Area, 
inclusive of one year of quarterly data and the collection of hydrogeological data through a 

network of strategically located groundwater monitoring wells, including wells within the 

proximity to the proposed TSF; 

 a formal aquatic resources baseline survey for two or more consecutive years, including 
considerations of – 

o sediment chemistry and determination of biological productivity of aquatic systems by 
characterizing fish habitat and communities, as well as assessing benthic invertebrates, 

zooplankton and phytoplankton, 

o include fish habitat, population, species surveys, biological productivity and spawning 
assessments on all streams and waterbodies potentially affected by the proposed mine plan 

and development, 

o identification and assessment of potential fish barriers, especially downstream of the 
planned infrastructure, and 

o reference locations for future baseline comparison; 

 a terrestrial ecosystems study, including – 

o ecosystem mapping, vegetation inventory and targeted data collection of plant and 
ecological communities of concern, such as wetlands, 

o plant tissue sampling and analytical testing for metals to support project permitting and 
development, 

o surveys to identify the presence of (or lack of) red- and blue-listed plants, plant species 
either listed by the Species at Risk Act (2002) or listed by the Committee on the Status of 

Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and old forest, alpine communities, 

traditionally or culturally important species and communities and invasive plants, and 

o an assessment of wetlands, including identification of wetland ecosystems at risk within 
the Project Area; and 

 including wildlife habitat suitability mapping to B.C.'s mapping standards (RISC, 1999) and 
other wildlife species-specific surveys and habitat assessments following provincial standards

for species including moose, mountain goat, sheep, and grizzly bear, and wildlife groups such 

as birds, amphibians and bats.  

Table 26.5 summarizes the estimated costs for the baseline studies outlined above, which will be 

carried out over two years.  For purposes of budgeting, an additional C$0.5 million has been 

assumed, post pre-feasibility study, for any additional studies that might be required.  As earlier 

stated, although not required to support a pre-feasibility study, the undertaking of the Years One 

and Two baseline studies in parallel with the pre-feasibility study and related resource drilling 

program (in Year One) is recommended to preclude delays in advancing the project to the EA 

stages, the estimated costs for which are included on Table 26.5.

hydrogeology (including considerations of the planned TSF location and groundwater conditions 

around the planned pits); geochemistry; soils and vegetation (including in and around the areas of 

planned infrastructure); wildlife; Terrestrial Ecosystem Mapping (TEM); geohazards around the 

planned infrastructure and planned pits; land status and use; socio-economics; First Nation rights 

and interest; and archaeology (including the required AIAs in the areas of planned infrastructure).  

With the exceptions of the air quality, meteorology and aquatic biology elements that are 

completed in Year One, the Year Two baseline studies are the same (but extensions of) the Year
