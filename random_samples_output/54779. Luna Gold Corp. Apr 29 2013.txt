Summary (Item 1) 
Luna Gold Corp. ("Luna" or the "Company") has prepared a Technical Report (the "Report") for the 

wholly owned Aurizona gold project ("Aurizona"), located in in the state of Maranhão, northeastern 

Brazil between the cities of São Luis and Belém.  The Report presents an update on the Aurizona 

mining operations, including updated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  Luna will be using 

the Report to support disclosure and filing requirements with the Canadian Securities Regulators. 

Property Description and Ownership 
Aurizona consists of an open pit mine, gold processing plant, and property containing several gold 

deposits and exploration targets. The Aurizona property contains a mining license, totaling 9,981 

hectares, and three exploration licenses totaling over 5,427 hectares. Included within Aurizona are 

the Piaba, Tatajuba, Boa Esperança, Ferradura and Conceição gold deposits and over ten near-

mine exploration targets, which are being actively explored by the Company.   

Aurizona is owned by Mineracão Aurizona S.A. ("MASA"), which is wholly owned by Aurizona 

Goldfields Corporation ("AGC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Luna.  A gold streaming agreement 

with Sandstorm Gold Ltd. ("Sandstorm") exists over the Aurizona area, which provides Sandstorm 

the right to 17% of LoM gold production for a specified price per ounce of gold. 

Aurizona is located in the state of Maranhão, northeastern Brazil between the cities of São Luis and 

Belém. The area is centered at Latitude 01º30' south and Longitude 45º76' west on the northern 

coast of Brazil, 220 km northwest of the capital city of São Luis. Aurizona is on the Atlantic coast 

within 3 km of an ocean inlet. The elevation of the Aurizona area varies from 0 to 90 m amsl. The 

climate is tropical, often humid, with annual rainfalls of up to 3,000 mm.  

Aurizona is accessible by road, water or air.  All year road access is available from the state capital 

cities of Belém, Pará (400 km), and São Luis, Maranhão (320 km).  There is helicopter access 

directly to the operating plant and a laterite air strip approximately 30 minute drive away from the 

camp facilities located in the town of Godofredo Viana, Maranhao, Brazil. 

As at December 31, 2012, Luna had acquired approximately 1,400 hectares of the surface rights 

required for the operation. 

Environment, Permitting and Social Licenses 
Luna complies with Brazilian Federal, State and Municipal environmental laws and regulations.  

Aurizona currently holds all of the environmental and operating permits that are required for 

operations. 

Public consultation and community assistance and development programs are ongoing.  

Implementation of sustainable development initiatives for the communities of Aurizona, Godofredo 

Viana and other communities within close proximity commenced in 2010. 

The present Brazilian legislation requires major approvals by two different regulatory authorities.  A 

mining license is granted by the DNPM after the approval of a Final Exploration Report and reviews 

of the PAE while the State Environmental Department ("SEMA") approves the operating license 

(Licença de Operação ("LO")).  Parallel to this DNPM approval process the environmental agencies 

provide approvals of the Environmental and Social Impact Study, environmental management

control program, deforestation license (if applicable) and conceptual closure plans.  The 

Environmental Impact Studies were completed in 1995 and submitted to regulatory authorities for 

review and approval.  The Maranhão Secretary of State for the Environment and Natural Resources 

("SEMA-MA") issued Aurizona's original Operating License on July 11, 2007 to initiate the mining 

and processing of gold within the limits of Mining License DNPM No. 800.256/1978, an area 

comprising 9,981.47 hectares.  The LO, No. 259/2007, was valid until December 11, 2009 and was 

renewed on March 22nd, 2010 generating the LO No. 108/2010, valid for two (2) years until March 

22nd, 2012. A renewal request was timely submitted 120 days before expiry date, generating the 

SEMA Process 2343/2011. This LO´s validity automatically continues until renewed or revoked.  A 

summary of the licenses, permits and applications is summarized in the Aurizona Report. 

This operating license was conditional upon Aurizona filing a conceptual closure plan, an update to 

the impacted areas and revised project description.  This was submitted in October 2007. 

Geology and Mineralization 
Aurizona is located within the São Luis Craton ("SLC"), an eastern extension of the Guyana Shield 

which contains several major Proterozoic gold deposits (e.g., Las Cristinas, Omai and Rosebel) 

extending from Venezuela to Brazil. The SLC consists of the Paleoproterozoic Aurizona Group 

metavolcano-sedimentary succession, volcanics and granitoids of the Tromaí Intrusive Suite covered 

by Phanerozoic sedimentary basin deposits and recent coastal sediments. The Aurizona Group 

hosts the Aurizona area, including the Piaba, Tatajuba, Boa Esperança, Ferradura and Conceição 

deposits and several near mine exploration targets. It consists of a well-developed 

metavolcanosedimentary sequence of schists, intermediate to mafic metavolcanic and 

metapyroclastic rocks, in addition to subordinate quartzites, banded iron formation ("BIF") and 

metachert intruded by tonalites and quartz porphyries which collectively define a classic Greenstone 

Belt sequence.  

Piaba is a 3.3 km long shear-hosted orogenic gold deposit which trends east/northeast and is hosted 

in a northern hanging wall sequence composed mainly of tonalite and quartz porphyry intrusives with 

subordinate dacitic volcanics. A distinctive graphitic volcano-sedimentary sequence forms a 

structural footwall limiting the deposit to the south. The host tonalite intrusive is medium to coarsely 

crystalline and highly brecciated and altered. The host volcanic sequence is andesitic to basaltic in 

composition and generally fine-grained. The orebody dips steeply to the north/northwest and gold 

occurs in several generations of quartz veins and also as disseminations within the host intrusives 

and volcanics. Hydrothermal alteration is intense and is dominated by quartz-graphite-chlorite-

carbonate-sericite-pyrite. The Tatajubam Boa Esperança, Ferradura and Conceição deposits and 

near mine exploration targets have similar geology to Piaba.  

The Aurizona area consists of a peneplain dissected into rounded flat knolls and bordered and 

interdigitated with Holocene marine and fluvio-marine sediments. The mineralized sequence is 

weathered to a vertical depth of more than 60 m, below which primary gold mineralization occurs in 

less weathered, sulfide-bearing rocks. Luna utilizes a classification to standardize the weathering 

profile within the deposit, which includes Laterite, Saprolite, Fresh Rock, and an intervening 

Transitional zone. Laterite and Saprolite are classed as oxide mineralization, the Fresh Rock as 

sulfide and the Transition Rock as predominately sulfide.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

The Aurizona gold deposits comprise east/northeast and east-west-trending orebodies containing 

average grades in the 0.75 g/t Au to 1.65 g/t Au range with gold values locally attaining 30 g/t Au or 

higher within the major east/northeast trending Aurizona Shear Zone. 

Exploration 
Initial exploration work was carried out by a number of different companies between 1991 and the 

time that Luna acquired Aurizona in January 2007.  Exploration activities included airborne and 

ground geophysical surveys, regional soil surveys, geological mapping and sampling, and auger, 

core and reverse circulation drilling.  Luna acquired Aurizona through a corporate acquisition from 

Brascan Recursos Naturais SA, Brascan Natural Resources SA (both wholly owned subsidiaries of 

Brascan Brasil and referred to collectively as "Brascan") and Eldorado Gold Corporation 

("Eldorado").   

Drilling 
Luna conducted resource definition core drilling between 2007 and 2012 at Aurizona to expand the 

gold resource and further define the geological model. Luna also conducted certain short reverse 

circulation programs and completed soil surveying covering Aurizona in addition to ground magnetic 

surveys, auger drill programs and trenching programs at several near mine targets.  

All diamond and reverse circulation drilling is oriented perpendicular to the nearly vertical structures, 

at hole dip angles between 50º and 80°. The historic RC holes were generally sampled at 1 m 

intervals with some samples at 2 m intervals. The historic core was sampled at a nominal 1 m 

interval, although the sample length had considerable variation between 0.1 and 2 m. Luna routinely 

samples the core at 2 m intervals in barren hanging wall and footwall rocks and reduces the sample 

interval to 1 m or less within the orebody. The sampling procedures follow industry best practices.  

Sample Preparation and Analysis 
Sample interval selection is the task of the geologist responsible for core logging.  The sample 

interval is a nominal 2.0 m in barren hanging wall rocks which is reduced 1 m or less within the 

mineralization.  Intervals should not be greater than 2.50 m nor less than 0.20 m.  Sample intervals 

are selected on the basis of lithology, mineralogy, weathering, structures and veins. 

Core is consistently sampled on one side (right – red line).  The remaining core half is stored in the 

box for future reference.   

Samples are placed in pre-labeled thick polythene bags and closed with sealed ties.  All samples are 

double bagged for added security.  Each core sample has a specific pre-numbered sample ticket 

with the prefix DH-.  Internal QA/QC samples (blanks, CRM and quarter core duplicates) are 

assigned routine DH- numbers and tickets. 

The sample sequence, including the internal control samples (blanks, certified reference material 

and duplicates) are recorded in GeoticLOG. 

When the drill core has been sampled it is stored in the core storage facility for future reference. 

Reverse circulation sample representing 1 m is collected and no sample processing or quartering is 

conducted on the project. The samples are shipped to the commercial assay laboratory where they 

are dried and processed in the same manner as drill core samples.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

All samples are transported to the commercial transport company by truck and one Luna 

representative accompanies all sample shipments.  Instructions to both laboratories are provided via 

detailed requisition forms outlining the complete procedures for sample preparation and assay which 

include that the entire sample must be milled prior to the removal of aliquots for analysis.  A 

complete paper trail of requisition forms to the laboratory, delivery reports and work order receipts is 

maintained at the project site. 

The samples are received from Luna in the laboratory's reception area in batches enclosed in sealed 

rice sacks containing the individual samples in separate plastic bags.  Minimal drying is required 

because the samples are all diamond core that have been pre-dried in sunlight during the logging 

and sampling process. 

All drill samples generated by Luna through January 2008 were prepared in sequential order at 

ACME.  All drill samples generated by Luna after that were prepared in sequential order at ALS 

Chemex in Belo Horizonte and also by ACME Laboratories in Goiania.  The sample preparation 

method for drill core at ALS Chemex is outlined in Figure 9.5.2.1.  For both laboratories Luna has a 

policy of a minimum of 80% passing 10 mesh for all drill core samples and 85% passing 200 mesh 

for all drill core pulps.  After January 3, 2008, a 1 kg split is pulverized to 85% passing 200 mesh 

(ACME 2007– 0.50 kg split) to better address any coarse gold associated with high-grade quartz 

veins. 

For drill samples prepped by ACME, approximately 125 g aliquot of each sample was shipped to 

ACME in Vancouver, Canada and Santiago Chile via international courier for assay.  All drill samples 

assayed by ACME were analyzed in sequential order via Method Group 6 (Fire Assay on a 30 g 

sample with Atomic Absorption finish).  Lower detection limit for this package is 0.01 g/t Au.  Over 

limit samples, greater than 10 g/t Au, were automatically analyzed via gravimetric gold analysis.  

For all drill samples prepped by ALS Chemex, approximately 150 g aliquot of each sample is 

shipped to ALS Chemex in Lima, Peru or Perth, Australia for assay.  In 2008, ALS Chemex assayed 

samples in Belo Horizonte.  All drill samples assayed by ALS Chemex are analyzed in sequential 

order via package Au-AA24 (Fire Assay on a 50 g sample with Atomic Absorption finish).  The lower 

detection limit for this package is 0.005 g/t Au.  Over limit samples, greater than 10 g/t Au are 

automatically assayed via an ore grade package (Au-AA26). 

All reject and pulp samples are returned to Luna on a regular basis.  These samples are checked for 

consistency and to ensure that return QA/QC samples correspond with the originals.  They are 

sealed in new sample bags and stored for future reference. 

QA/QC is conducted to ensure high quality drill data.  QA/QC consists of two parts, namely QA 

(Quality Assurance) which consists of the design or planning of sampling program and QC (Quality 

Control) defined by the active procedures used during sampling to monitor, detect and correct errors 

to guarantee that results that are used in the project assessment meet the design specifications.  

Luna's QA/QC procedure is designed to implement controls on the sampling process in order that 

bias (error in accuracy) is null, variance (precision error) is minimal and sample switching is detected 

and corrected.  

The laboratory is instructed to prepare and analyze all samples in numerical order.  This is adhered 

to and is backed-up by unannounced site visits to the sample preparation laboratories by Luna 

technical personnel.  These site visits are documented in audit reports.

Mineral Resource Estimate 
Leah Mach, SRK Principal Resource Geologist, conducted resource estimation studies for the Piaba, 

Boa Esperança, Conceição, Ferradura and Tatajuba deposits using Maptek's VulcanTM (v8.1.4) 

software. 

Mineral Resource estimate was conducted by SRK using mineralized envelopes to constrain grade 

estimation.  The drillholes were composited at 2 m intervals appropriate capping values were used to 

reduce the influence of outlier data.  The grade estimation at Piaba was preceded by an indicator 

kriging run to define mineralized and waste blocks within the envelope.  Gold grades were estimated 

by ID3 using composites within the mineralized blocks to estimate those blocks and using 

composites within the waste blocks to estimate those blocks.  At the near mine targets, the indicator 

step was not used.  The methodology is an accepted industry practice.  Resources were classified 

as Measured, Indicated, or Inferred according to CIM guidelines.  Pit optimization shells were used 

to constrain open pit resources.  Material outside the Piaba pit optimization shell was stated at a 

higher cutoff to reflect potential underground mining costs. 

The procedure for resource estimation for Piaba and the Aurizona near mine targets was as follows: 

 Construction of a grade shell(s) by Luna geologists; 
 Data analysis of assay data, including: 

o Review of lognormal probability plots to determine cutoff grades for use in grade shell 

construction; 

o Comparison of assay results from core, RC and auger drilling and trench sampling; 

o Analysis of sample recovery versus gold content; and 

o Contact analysis between weathering types. 

 Selection of capping values; 
 Compositing; 
 Variography; 
 Grade estimation:  At Piaba, low-grade or waste blocks within the Piaba grade shell were 

identified through indicator kriging.  Waste blocks and mineralized blocks were estimated 

separately with the Inverse Distance Cubed (ID3) algorithm.  At the near mine targets, the 

grade shells are narrower and do not contain significant zones of internal waste.  Gold 

grades were estimated with ID3 at all deposits; 

 Block model validation; 
 Block model classification; and 
 Whittle Pit Optimization to identify pit constrained resources.

 Tonnes are rounded to the nearest 10,000; ounces are rounded to the nearest 1,000; and 
 Small tonnage and grade differences may be found due to rounding. 

Mineral Reserve Estimate 
Mineral Reserves have been generated with parameters based on historical data and incorporating 

expected changes and assumptions upon completion of the Phase I Expansion and other known 

changes. The work for the design and optimization has been independently reviewed by Sam 

Shoemaker, Principal mining engineer for Micon International.  

The ultimate size of the pit was selected to be at US$1350 per ounce. Scenarios were conducted to 

help provide a full range of pit boundaries and their impact of variances in gold prices. The ultimate 

pit was then optimized to provide the highest NPV. This was done analyzing the nested pits as they 

incrementally increase towards the pit limit. There are a few assumptions to note that require further 

evaluation and potential for optimization: 

 Dilution has been assigned as 10% at 0 gpt. All material that was less than 0.3 gpt, including 
that at the boundary, is automatically taken into the calculation as waste; 

 The assumptions on the operating costs for the Process Plant do not include the full benefits 
of the implementation of Phase1; and 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page vii 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

 Historical figures were included in the calculation of Process Plant unit costs. These figures 
have also been impacted due to the worst draught in the North Easter region of Maranhão. 

The plant was forced to operate at lower rates to conserve water, therefore, negatively 

impacting the trend.  

The new reserves are based on a new geological model created by SRK consulting. The model was 

used to conduct a series of optimizing iterations which involved input from all the technical 

disciplines such as, operations, geotechnical, survey, geology, processing, etc. The process also 

looks at the legislation, costs, revenue and operational practicality. This latter process closes the gap 

between designing and scheduling and culminates in a final Reserves declaration. The model was 

depleted to December 31, 2012 topography and historical data from site has been used to calibrate 

mining parameters. For the evaluation of stockpile contribution to the reserves the month end 

topography for December 31, 2012 was used.  

Only Measured and Indicated Reserves have been included for the creation of Proven and Probable 

Reserves. Inferred and bellow cutoff grade material has been treated as waste.

Aurizona Infrastructure 
Aurizona consists of an open pit mine, process plant, tailings storage facilities ("TSF"), maintenance 

facilities, administration buildings, and camp facilities.   

These facilities are powered by grid power supplied by the Companhia Electrica de Maranhao 

("CEMAR") and by four backup 2.5kVA diesel generators. The Company has installed satellite 

communications to utilize voice over internet protocals (VoIP for telephones) and internet protocals 

(for regular computer business) and uses existing telephone land lines and local cellular services.  

Mining operations utilize two-way radio communication.  Potable water is supplied from an existing 

case well and from the municipal water treatment plant.  Process plant water comes from the TSF. 

The TSF elevation is currently at 27 m with the capacity to collect and store 3 million cubic meters of 

water while augmenting storage capacity to over 9.2 Mt of tailings. 

Mining Operations 
Mining operations for the Piaba deposit were comprised of 100% owner operations for main 

earthworks and grade control.  From time to time, the Company will utilize contractors to assist in 

excess earthworks movement. 

Mining operations are mainly owner operated with the exception of a very small portion of load and 

haul and the explosives charge up crew. The extra load and haul equipment conducts day works 

which are not necessarily production related but help with the development of the mine, i.e. creating 

sumps, helping with stockpiles and handling boulders. The team has developed the skills to conduct 

the technical services as well as executing the short term plans. Drilling and blasting takes place in 

some areas containing competent material.  The procedure is performed almost entirely by the 

mining team. The only portion that is left for third party contractors to complete is the loading of

emulsion which the contractor delivers by transport truck and subsequently leaves the mine property 

on the same day after the blast has occurred. The mining team also conducts grade control and with 

current results often surpassing drilling rates of 380 metric tonnes per day.  

Mining operations at the Piaba deposit are conducted in soft saprolite and laterite material, 

encountering some intrusions of transitional rock at times. The harder fresh rock material will only 

form part of the production in mid-2014. The pit faces its challenges during the rainy season. 

Historically there have been seasons where it has rain as much as 3 metres. The pit has been 

designed with the latest software technology, NPV scheduler for the pit optimizations and Deswik 

CAD for designs and schedules. The schedules take into account the slower production rates during 

the wet season and the design aims for the higher up areas that permit work to be conducted while 

minimizing exposure to the wet saprolitic material. The production fleet is composed of twelve (12) 

CAT 740 articulated dump trucks and CAT 374 excavators.  The production drilling is done with a 

Ranger 800 and the grade control is done with Explorac 50 RC. Mine roads require sheeting and 

compaction to maintain safe, continuous mining conditions during periods of high rainfall. Sufficient 

pumping capacity is also included in the planning to avoid flooding of the pit.  

The current LoM plan assumes production from open pit sources at an average annual production 

rate of 135,000 ounces of gold produced until 2028 for a LoM of 16 years.   

As of December 2012, Luna's primary equipment includes twelve 740B articulated CAT trucks, three 

374 CAT excavators, a CAT 336 excavator with a rock breaker attachment, two CAT 966 loaders, 

one CAT 120 grader, one CAT D8 bulldozer, one CAT D6 bulldozer, one CAT 416 backhoe, one 

reverse circulation drill rig Explorac 50, one 7,000 liters fuel truck, one production drill rig (Sandvik 

DX 800).  

As part of day to day operations, Luna will continue to perform reviews of the mine plan and 

consideration of alternatives and variations within the plan.  Alternative scenarios and reviews can 

be based on ongoing or future mining considerations, evaluation of different potential input factors, 

optimizations and corporate directives. 

Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
The processing plant utilizes conventional processing technologies for the production of gold doré 

bars.  The gold doré bars are shipped to offsite gold refineries.  The processing plant is comprised of 

the following circuits for the processing of oxide ore: ore receiving; grinding; pre-leach thickener; 

carbon in leach gold recovery; gold elution; carbon acid washing; gold electro winning; induction 

fusion furnace; tailings thickening; and neutralization of the tailings pulp. Prior to the pre-leaching 

thickener, a portion of the coarser material gets classified by two Knelson concentrators for gravity 

gold recovery. The material is then smelted and shipped together with the rest of the product. 

A series of historical metallurgical test programs were carried out on the saprolite, laterite and 

unweathered ("Fresh") mineralized material from Aurizona between 1994 and 2008.  The results of 

these test programs were the basis for the feasibility study prepared for Aurizona's Piaba project, 

and have been discussed in an earlier NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineração Aurizona, S. A., 

Piaba Project, SRK Consulting, May 9, 2008. Additional metallurgical studies, including cyanidation 

testwork, comminution studies and solid/liquid separation studies have since been conducted and 

reported by Metcon Research ("Metcon").

Recovery Methods 
The process plant has been operational since June 2010 with ore being processed through the 

gravity concentration and CIL circuits. In 2012 process plant recovery enhancement initiatives were 

directed at improvements in CIL pulp carbon concentration, carbon inventory level and pre-leach 

circuit pulp feed density optimization. Further recovery improvements will be achieved through the 

Phase I Expansion. 

Markets 
Aurizona has an operative refining agreement with Umicore for refining of doré produced from the 

mine.  Luna's bullion is sold on the spot market through a sales contract with Auramet Trading LLC.  

The terms contained within the sales contract are typical and consistent with standard industry 

practice.  17% of the gold production is forward sold to Sandstorm. 

Process Plant Expansion 
Luna commenced an expansion to the process plant ("Phase I Expansion") to increase annual 

production capacity ore throughput to 10,000 Mt per day resulting in annual gold production 

averaging 135,000 ounces per annum.  The Phase I Expansion commenced in December 2012 and 

is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2013. 

The expansion is targeting low capital cost improvements to the existing Aurizona process plant with 

minimal impact to the plant's established footprint or current operations, while further expansion 

studies are being completed.  Aurizona's increased capacity will be facilitated as follows: 

 commissioning of an intense leach reactor and four electrowinning cells; 
 carbon regeneration kiln; 
 new elution and acid wash columns to improve the efficiency of the elution circuit; 
 installation of two new high-rate thickeners and installation of three new CIL tanks and 

ancillary equipment; 

 improvements to ore receiving; and 
 improvements to the existing grinding circuit. 

Capital Costs 
As a result of the new Reserves of 2.1 million ounces produced and the Phase I Expansion, capital 

costs have been re-assessed.  The majority of the LoM sustaining capital costs have been 

calculated utilizing current and historical figures, while the trends and efficiency improvements help 

predict future costs. The following table summarizes the LoM capital expenditure including sunk 

capital costs and further detail is provided within this report.

The LoM sustaining costs primarily relate to the purchase, refurbishing and maintenance of the 

current and new mining fleet. 

Operating Costs 
Operating costs have been recalculated based on a 15 year mine life utilizing the new Reserve and 

new production rates. The operational LoM average cash cost is US$ 843 per ounce of gold 

produced.  The following table summarizes the distribution of operating costs and further detail is 

provided within this report.

Financial Analysis 
The results of the economic analysis represent forward-looking information that is subject to a 

number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to 

differ from those presented here. 

 Forward-looking statements in this report include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to 

the future price of gold and silver, the estimation of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, the 

realization of Mineral Reserve estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future production, 

costs of production, capital expenditures, costs and timing of the development of new deposits, 

success of exploration activities, permitting time lines, currency exchange rate fluctuations, 

requirements for additional capital, government regulation of mining operations, environmental risks, 

unanticipated reclamation expenses, title disputes or claims and limitations on insurance coverage. 

Additional risk can come from actual results of current exploration activities; actual results of current 

reclamation activities; conclusions of economic evaluations; changes in Project parameters as plans 

continue to be refined, possible variations in ore reserves, grade or recovery rates; failure of plant, 

equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the 

mining industry; and delays in obtaining governmental approvals. 

To support the statement of Mineral Reserves for the Piaba deposit, Luna prepared an economic 

analysis to confirm the economics based on the Mineral Reserves could repay LoM operating and 

capital costs.  Aurizona was evaluated on an after-tax, project stand-alone, 100% equity-financed 

basis using a 5% discount rate, and all costs prior to December 31, 2012 were treated as sunk costs.  

Results of this assessment indicated positive project economics until the end of the mine life and 

supported Mineral Reserve declaration. 

Exploration Potential 
Exploration potential in the near-term remains the potential for extensions in mineralization both 

along strike and at depth and also with near mine deposits within the Aurizona area.  Further studies 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page xii 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

and work are ongoing to potentially convert the remaining Mineral Resource estimate to Mineral 

Reserves.  Results will be published in due course.  

Conclusions 
In the opinion of the QP, Aurizona, which is outlined in the Report, has met its objectives.  Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves have been estimated for the project, a mine has been constructed, 

mining and processing operations are performing as expected, and reconciliation between mine 

production and the mineral resource model is acceptable.  This indicates the data supporting the 

Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates were appropriately collected, evaluated and 

estimated, and the original project objective of identifying mineralization that could support mining 

operations has been achieved.  Based on the Mineral Reserves declared in this report, the mine life 

will extend to 2028. 

Recommendations 
Further studies and work are required to optimize the Aurizona operations.  These recommendations 

are listed below. 

Density and SG Bulk Samples 

The relationship of density and specific gravity should be reconciled from drill core through bulk 

survey estimates for ore and waste. Both In-situ and loose density relationships for each rock type 

should be quantified and accurately used for reconciliation and survey reporting (Estimated cost -

US$10,000). 

MCF Calculation 

Reconciliation is currently at early an infant stages and it is constantly being refined. The installation 

of scales on the truck's suspension should be considered to ensure that the mine and the plant can 

compare the material being fed to the plant. Currently there is one scale on the belt and survey 

measurements are being utilized based on block model densities.  A weigh bridge has been 

purchased and should be installed to assist with reconciliations (Estimated cost - US$200,000). 

Geotechnical Drilling 

A plan to develop a drilling campaign to collect geotechnical information for detailed pit and waste 

stockpile designs. It is recommended that the campaign be implemented in 2013 to ensure that a 

geotechnical 3D model is available to the operation (Estimated cost - US$500,000). 

Hydro-geological Study 

The mine has started shallow assessments and two deep well pump tests.  Further evaluation of 

ground water flows, surface run off, pit dewatering, and long term drainage plan is required for 

detailed designs. This includes further follow-up assessments to preliminary investigations of acid 

rock drainage and metals leaching (Estimated cost - US$300,000). 

Future expansion Potential 

A second phase prefeasibility study ("Phase II Expansion") to assess viability to expand between 

200 and 300 koz/yr is underway and is expected to be completed by the end of 2013. This includes a 

metallurgical test program and crushing and grinding trade-off studies comparing requirements for 

Phase I Expansion and Phase II Expansion blend optimizations (Estimated cost - US$2,500,000).

2.2 Mineral Titles 
Mining rights in Brazil are governed by the Mining Code and additional rules enacted by Brazil's 

National Department of Mineral Production ("DNPM"), which is the governmental agency controlling 

mining activities throughout the country.  Each application for an exploration or exploitation permit is 

represented by a mineral claim submitted to the DNPM.   

Brazilian mining legislation dictates that the holder of an exploration license will pay annual taxes to 

the DNPM based on the number of hectares held under the license, pay all expenses related to 

DNPM site inspections of the permit area, and will submit an exploration work report to the DNPM 

prior to the expiration date of the permit.  The detailed requirements are listed in Table 2.2.1. 

Table 2.2.1:  Obligations of Brazilian Exploration Permit Holders  

Rule Description Applicable Law Provision 

Payment of DNPM's 
Annual Tax 

The mineral right holder shall pay to DNPM the 
Annual Tax per Hectare (TAH) until the end of the 
exploration work.  TAH is charged in the amount of: 
(i) R$2.63 per hectare, during the effective period of 
the authorization in its original term and (ii) R$3.58 
per hectare, if the authorization term had been 
already extended.  In case of default, DNPM shall 
impose penalties.  If the penalties are not duly paid, 
DNPM may even cancel the Exploration Permit. 

Mining Code, article 20. 

Payment of DNPM'S 
Expenses for Related 
Inspections 

The mining right holder shall be responsible for 
expenses incurred by DNPM with inspections in the 
exploration area. 

Mining Code, article 26, 
fourth paragraph. 

Exploration Work Report 
Before the authorization's expiration date, the 
mining right holder shall submit to DNPM the due 
exploration work report. 

Mining Code, article 22, V. 

 

Compliance with the obligations mentioned above and the Brazilian Mining Code is essential for the 

mining right holder to keep its mineral claims in good standing, according to the applicable laws. 

The Mineral Licenses for Aurizona are 100% held by Luna via Mineração Aurizona S/A.  The 

property includes Mining License (Portaria de Lavra) no. 1201/88, with DNPM no. 800.256/78, 

totaling 9,981 hectares, and three exploration licenses totaling approximately 5,427 hectares.  The 

Mining License is subject to a government royalty of 1%, which is applied to gross gold sales less 

costs incurred in selling, transportation and insurance. On March 25, 2009 Luna submitted an 

application to the DNPM to convert exploration license 806.042/03, which contains the Tatajuba 

deposit, to a mining lease. On June 27, 2011 Luna submitted an application to the DNPM to convert 

exploration license 806.195/07, which is located between the Piaba Mining License and the Tatajuba 

Exploration License to a mining lease.  All exploration licenses are subject to an annual exploration 

tax according to the claim size and time held.  Luna confirms that all land tax payments are up to 

date.  Table 2.2.2 lists Aurizona mineral permits.

2.3 Legal Surveys 
Exploration licenses in Brazil are paper filings and do not require the actual location of monuments 

on the ground.  The filing includes descriptions of the corners of the licenses in Geographical 

Coordinate System using the South American Provisional 1956 datum. Mining Licenses are required 

to be marked and Luna reports that all accessible vertices in the Piaba Mine License have been 

monumented. 

2.4 Location of Mineralization 
The Piaba resource, reserve and associated mine facilities described in this report and the Boa 

Esperança, Ferradura and Conceição resources are completely contained within Mining License 

800.256/78.  The Tatajuba resource described in this report is completely contained within 

exploration license 806.042/03.  The near mine exploration targets are located within Mining Permit 

800.256/78 and Exploration Permits 860.042/03,806.195/07 and 806.111/96 (Figure 2.2.2). 

2.5 Surface Ownership 
The Aurizona coastal region is Federal Government land administered by the Serviço do Patrimônio 

da União ("SPU"), an institution within the Ministry of Economy.  Nevertheless the region has been 

occupied for many years by squatters and garimpeiros. 

In September 2007, Mineração Aurizona completed a detailed survey of the title situation of land 

occupiers and garimpeiros, which included a register of the recognized occupiers, a ground survey of 

the area occupied, and an inventory of any improvements or assets on the lands.  In October 2007, 

Mineração Aurizona started a buyout program of the plots considered necessary for the project that 

were not already owned by the Company.  By December 31, 2012, 1,400 hectares of the surface 

rights required for the project had been acquired.  As the plots are acquired, the Mineração Aurizona 

property fence is adjusted and sign-posted as required by law.   

2.5.1 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Interest 

Luna, through its wholly owned subsidiary MASA, owns 100% of the mineral licenses associated 

with Aurizona.  The surface ownership is described in Section 2.5. 

2.6 Royalties, Agreements, Encumbrances and Income Taxes 

2.6.1 Royalties 

The Mining License is subject to a government royalty of 1%, which is applied to gross gold sales 

less costs incurred in selling, transportation, and insurance.   

2.6.2 Sandstorm Agreement 

In May 2009, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with under which the Company 

agreed to sell an effective 17% interest in certain reserves and resources of the Aurizona mine to 

Sandstorm for cash proceeds of $17.8 million and 5,500,000 Sandstorm common shares.  

The Company's accounting reflects Sandstorm as an effective owner of 17% of certain reserves and 

resources at Aurizona; accordingly no revenue is recorded on gold deliveries to Sandstorm. As gold 

is delivered, the Company receives a production cost recovery payment in an amount equal to the 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 2 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

lesser of $400 per ounce and the prevailing spot gold market price. The per ounce amount of $400 is 

subject to an increase of 1% per annum beginning February 2014.  

In September 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the "Amendment 

Agreement") with Sandstorm to contribute to funding the Phase I Expansion at the Aurizona mine. 

Sandstorm will contribute 17% of the required Phase I Expansion capital expenditure to a maximum 

of US$10.0 million.  

If the Company decides to further develop an underground mine at Aurizona, Sandstorm will have 

the right to purchase an effective 17% interest in the underground mine, whereby, 17% of the gold 

produced will be delivered to Sandstorm at a per-ounce price equal to the lesser of $500 and the 

prevailing market price, subject to an increase of 1% per annum beginning on the third anniversary 

from the date that the underground mine begins commercial production.  In exchange, Sandstorm 

will pay for 17% of the capital expenditures incurred to determine the economic viability of, and to, 

construct the underground mine. 

2.6.3 SUDENE Tax Incentive 

The SUDENE tax incentive (the "SUDENE Tax Incentive") is a tax incentive program developed by 

the Brazilian Government under the responsibility of the Superintendence for the Development of the 

Northeast Region ("SUDENE").  The goal of this program is to attract new investments, to generate 

wealth and employment, enabling a more efficient social policy to develop the most underdeveloped 

regions of Brazil.  The SUDENE Tax Incentive represents a 75% reduction of the Brazilian corporate 

income tax rate of 25% for a period of 10 years commencing in the calendar year following the 

receipt of an appraisal certificate (an "Appraisal Certificate") from SUDENE attesting that the 

Company has fulfilled all the legal requirements to enjoy this tax incentive. 

The Company applied for the SUDENE Tax Incentive for the Aurizona operation and received the 

Appraisal Certificate from SUDENE in October 2011.  Therefore, the Company will be subject to the 

reduced corporate income tax rate commencing in 2011 for a period of 10 years (the "Eligible 

Period"). 

The effective income tax rate of approximately 15.25% for during this Eligible Period is based on a 

6.25% corporate income tax rate plus a 9.0% social tax rate. 

2.7 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

2.7.1 Required Permits and Status 

The SEMA-MA issued Aurizona with an LO on July 11, 2007 to recommence the mining and 

processing of gold within the limits of Mining License DNPM No. 800.256/1978, an area comprising 

9,981.47 hectare.  The LO, No. 259/2007, was renewed and a new LO, No. 108/2010 was issued in 

March 2010 valid until March 2012.  The renewal process for this license was initiated in November 

2011.  Specific licenses and permits required for the operation are discussed in Section 18. 

2.7.2 Compliance Evaluation 

Aurizona has almost completed infrastructure development and the development of various 

management plans.  The social and environmental plans have been developed. 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 3 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

2.7.3 Environmental Liabilities 

The Aurizona region has a long tradition as a gold producer, almost solely from garimpeiros.  An 

inspection conducted in 1989 by the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the State Secretariat for the 

Environment for Maranhão verified the uncontrolled exploitation of the area by prospectors and 

concluded the area was contaminated.  During the EIA/RIMA process, levels of mercury were 

measured.  In August 2009, several soil, sediments, and water mercury assays were performed on 

areas potentially impacted by mining activities by garimpeiros in the Project region.  Mercury was 

detected in soil and sediment samples; however, the values were lower than reference values 

required for contaminated areas intervention, the record of which is chronicled in environmental 

resolution Conama No. 420/2009. 

2.8 Other Significant Factors and Risks 
Luna is not aware of any other significant factors or risks associated with the project that are not 

stated in this report. 

 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 4 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography (Item 5) 

3.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 
Aurizona is on the Atlantic coast within 3 km of an ocean inlet.  During the Tertiary period, erosion 

formed the area into a peneplain characterized by rounded flat knolls and indented and flooded 

coastlines with wide estuaries.  The coastline is characterized by the occurrence of mangrove 

swamps and has an elevation of 2 m to 3 m amsl in and on the edges of saline waterways.  The 

vegetation consists of grasses in the low-lying areas with denser tropical vegetation consisting of 

larger shrubs, vines, and hardwood tropical trees on the low rounded hills. 

The elevation in the project area varies from 0 m to 90 m amsl.  The isthmus that joins the Aurizona 

Peninsula to the mainland consists of low-lying flats that is subject to mild (+20 cm) flooding at high 

neap tides.  This does not affect project access. 

3.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
The climate is tropical, often humid, with annual rainfalls of up to 3,000 mm.  The rainy season 

occurs from mid-December to mid-July, with the heaviest rains from January through April.  The area 

is close to the equator and has relatively steady temperatures, ranging from an average low of 24°C 

to an average high of 31°C. 

3.3 Sufficiency of Surface Rights 
Luna controls sufficient surface rights for required infrastructure for the mine. 

3.4 Accessibility and Transportation to the Property 
All year road access is available from the state capital cities of Belém, Pará (400 km), and São Luis, 

Maranhão (320 km), the latter requiring a ferry transfer from São Luis island to the mainland or 

longer bypass road on land (Figure 2.1.1).  The main federal highway connecting both capitals 

(BR316) has been resurfaced in both states and is in good condition.  State highway MA206 

connects BR316 with the town of Godofredo Viana, a distance of 110 km, from which the property is 

accessed by 16 km of a regularly maintained 8 m wide laterite road.  

Aurizona in partnership with the local authorities has upgraded the landing strip at Godofredo Viana.  

Travel time between Aurizona and São Luis or Belém is approximately one hour by light aircraft. 

3.5 Infrastructure Availability and Sources 
Aurizona is located in Maranhão state, a remote region of Brazil, but benefits from a local population 

of inexpensive labor.  Water is abundant and major population centers of Belem and Sao Luis are 

approximately six hours drive away. 

3.5.1 Access Road and Transportation 

Transportation of gold, unlike many minerals, is a very minor part of the total mine transportation 

requirement, as measured by volume.  Apart from the more intense transportation requirement 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 5 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

during the construction phase, the principal transportation requirement thereafter is low to moderate 

for supplies such as diesel oil, process chemicals, spares and personnel transport. 

In order to mitigate the effect on the local communities, the access road to the mine plant and 

warehouse areas avoids the main centers of population.  Although the local roads are state or 

municipality controlled, Aurizona has worked with the authorities to ensure that all are maintained fit 

for purpose, and with particular respect to the laterite roads, are watered and graded regularly, sign 

posted adequately and speed limits respected. 

All loads deemed hazardous are met by mine security on exiting the state road to the property and 

escorted to the mine site.  In certain cases, hazardous loads, such as very wide or very long cargos, 

are escorted the whole journey from loading point to the property. 

3.5.2 Power 

Grid power is supplied by the CEMAR, as of July 2012, CEMAR was able to guarantee the supply of 

4.6MWatt of power which will be enhanced to 7.8MWatt for the Phase I Expansion. In addition to grid 

power, the company relies on four 2.5kVA generators that act as a backup. It is predicted that 

CEMAR will have sufficient capacity for continual operations in 2014 and beyond.  

3.5.3 Mine and Plant Access Roads 

Dedicated access roads to the mine and process plant have been constructed, fenced off and 

adequately signed to protect local people and livestock from entering the mine areas. A single 

access point to the operation is secured by double gates and spikes allowing only authorized 

personnel to the working area. After entering through the main gate, the road splits in two, one road 

for the plant and the other for the open pit for which it is required radio communication with the 

supervisor prior to gaining access.  

3.5.4 Mine Site Facilities 

All essential mine facilities except expanded camp accommodations, site airstrip and maintenance 

shop have been constructed.  External laydown areas and a horticultural nursery are located 

adjacent to the mine camp.  

3.5.5 Plant Site Facilities 

The principal facilities in support of the process plant are a gold room, assay laboratory and four 2.5 

kVA diesel generators, fuelling station, compressors, electrical building and substation, warehouse, 

laydown, helicopter pad and office space.  There is a plant maintenance workshop that currently 

exists as well as a two bay heavy equipment workshop.  There is currently a camp located at 

Aurizona village with an infirmary, offices, lodging facilities, and kitchen/dining area for serving meals 

mainly to the administration staff including short term contractors.   

3.5.6 Tailings Facility 

Tailings infrastructures have been raised to 27 m level prior to the rainy season of 2013. The current 

elevation allows water collection of over 3 million cubic meters of water while augmenting storage 

capacity to over 9.2 Mt of tailings. Uplift to 31 elevation is planned to resume during the dry season 

in 2013 and studies to conduct a further uplift to level 45 is underway. There are two other potential 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 6 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

locations for extra tailings dam capacity, Sao Lorenço and Barriguda. Preliminary studies for these 

areas together with the total capacity of the current dam provides a potential total capacity of 67 Mt. 

3.5.7 Water 

The use of all water sources, surface and underground, requires approval from the Natural 

Resources Department of SEMA, the state environmental authority. 

Process Water  

Process water comes from the tailings dam, old pit workings and recirculation of solution recovered 

during the thickening process.  The life of mine demand is estimated at 382 m3/h.  

The tailings from the CIL process reports to a thickener, which concentrates the solids and recovers 

a large part of the water as thickener overflow.  An estimated 190 m³/h of thickener supernatant, with 

a residual cyanide concentration of 80 mg/L, is recycled to process, and the tailings pulp sent to the 

neutralization process before final discharge to the tailings dam.  The make-up water supply for the 

grinding process of 176 m³/h comes from the supernatant of the tailings dam. 

Potable Water Supply  

Water in the camp area is drawn from an existing cased well which has a flow rate of 4 m³/h. Potable 

water also comes from the municipal water treatment plant.  A monitoring plan for quality control has 

been implemented in accordance with standards established by the Ministry of Health Directive 

n°518/04. 

Industrial Water and Fire Fighting Water 

The industrial requirement will include showers, toilets, carbon washing and general cleaning 

purposes and firefighting.  Industrial water comes from a small dam on the back of Pirocaua hill and 

potentially from clean water pumped from the pit.  It will have a separate line, pump and header tank 

with a capacity of 400 m3. 

3.5.8 Mining Personnel 

Mining personnel is made up of a combination of local workforce for the operations and technical 

services. Up to 95% of the heavy equipment operators and mine workers are from the region. For 

the larger part of the technical support they have become residents of Godofredo Viana.  

3.5.9 Tailings Storage Areas 

There are two areas that have been identified as potential TSF, Sao Lorenzo and Barriguda both 

inside MASA's mining lease. Currently, with a preliminary desktop study, it has been identified that 

the capacity of the Vene Dam at Level-Crest 45 provides a total of 22 m m3 plus Sao Lorenzo at 

Level-crest 30 m combined can provide a total capacity to store more than 60 Mt. Figure 3.5.9.1 

shows the location of the basin South East from the plant. Figure 3.5.9.2 Sao Lorenço Basin capacity 

at elevation 30 m.

3.5.10 Waste Disposal Areas 

Waste is being deposited to the north of the Piaba pit and it extents in parallel along the strike of the 

orebody. The total volume available is 270 million m3, more than enough capacity to accommodate 

the entire production of the Piaba Pit. Given the different options available waste disposal can be 

accommodated also extending towards the north of the pit after acquiring the properties in the area 

(Figure 3.5.10.1).

3.5.11 Potential Heap Leach Pad Areas 

Study is underway to determine if a viable business case exists for this option. 

3.5.12 Processing Plant Sites 

The plant is located some 500 m south of the ultimate Piaba pit. Currently the plant is undergoing 

work to accommodate for the new equipment as per Phase I Expansion. The current plant is made 

up of security access buildings, laboratory, gold room, shops, electrical rooms, compressor rooms, 

flocculent addition plant, cyanide and lime addition warehouses, CCM, substation, maintenance 

offices, warehouse, helipad, fuel bay, power generator room containing four 2.5 kVA.  

3.5.13 Communications 

At present, there are landline telephones, cell phone coverage and satellite communications for the 

mine camp and process plant.  Additional systems for handheld and vehicle radios are installed 

including two repeater towers that enable full radio coverage as far as Godofredo Viana airport for 

security purposes.  An upgraded IT system is being installed in 2012 including, a wireless mesh, new 

VSAT and fiber optic connection between the camp and process plant. 

3.6 Social Issues 
The Aurizona region has a long tradition as a community that depended on fishing, agriculture, 

livestock and garimpeiro gold mining, almost solely from garimpeiros, such that today the Aurizona 

village has population of around 2,500 inhabitants and 400 simple houses.  It is only in the past 

decade that there has been road access to the village and the provision of electricity. 

The common means of survival income today remain largely the same with the addition of 

employment by Luna and supporting businesses.  Gold is mined by garimpeiros, either working in 

North

pits and drainages, and more common recently, using metal detectors.  There is a small amount of 

fishing, subsistence agriculture and local hunting for small animals and birds.  Some more affluent 

people have small to medium sized cattle ranches some of which exist near the mine. 

There is a public water treatment facility for which Luna provides treatment chemicals and 

maintenance for the pump and piping system.  There is no sewer system or trash collection service.  

The construction of a sanitary land fill is budgeted for 2013.  The chronic lack of sanitary services, 

medical aid and dietary deficiencies has resulted in the populace being subjected to various endemic 

diseases.  Luna has built a medical facility and full time staff assistance in Aurizona Village open to 

the community and provides for ambulance services.  In 2011, Luna constructed a health clinic and 

church in the community of Barão located approximately 10 km from the project. 

The project brings a number of benefits and initiatives to the region that assist in providing a 

healthier and more sustainable society.  Infrastructural benefits apart, the most resounding positive 

impact is the direct employment of hundreds of local persons that have not had regular paid work for 

many years, and some not at all.  This has a knock-on effect with local small businesses due to the 

much higher purchasing power within the community. 

The local municipality benefits from increased local taxation because of the project and the initiatives 

being undertaken jointly with the company to promote and use local products as much as possible. 

Luna has already provided a number of community improvements and plans to continue with 

measures.  In addition to these improvements such as the provision of medical services from the 

project clinic, which has a nurse and doctor in attendance, fully equipped ambulance service, a 

police station is under construction and planned for completion in mid 2013. The secretary of security 

for the state of Maranhão has committed to staff up the police headquarters donated to the state and 

region by Luna.

4 History (Item 6) 
The Aurizona region has a long history of gold production dating back to the Jesuits in the 17th 

Century.  There are anecdotal reports that companies were active in the area in the 1880's, but that 

they left due to problems with the indigenous Urubus people.  In 1912, there was considerable 

activity around the village of Aurizona and again in 1931 when the government declared a "free 

mining area except for the tax on gold production payable to the State".  Garimpeiros have been 

active in the region, on a discontinuous basis, since that time.  Large nuggets have been reported 

from the alluvial flats.  

In 1978, Brascan through subsidiary companies, started exploration programs in the alluvium that 

lasted through 1985.  In 1988, a subsidiary of Brascan, MASA, received a license to mine within 

DNPM area 800.256/78.  In 1991, an application for a five-year suspension of mining operations was 

applied for with the purpose of carrying out an evaluation of the primary gold resources. 

In 1991, a joint venture agreement was signed between Cesbra S/A, a Brascan Brasil subsidiary, 

and Unamgen, an exploration subsidiary of Gencor, the South African mining company.  Unamgen 

assumed the position of operator of the joint venture company, MASA.  Exploration from 1991 to 

1993 consisted of an airborne magnetic and radiometric heliborne survey, photogrammetry survey, 

soil geochemical surveys, mapping and sampling of garimpeiro pits and follow-up ground 

geophysical surveys consisting of induced polarization, electromagnetic, magnetic, and gamma 

spectrometry.  The Piaba deposit was drill tested with auger, reverse circulation ("RC"), and diamond 

drilling.   

In 1994, following preliminary process tests at Mintek in South Africa, more comprehensive test 

works were carried out in Brazil at the Metais de Goías S/A ("Metago") metallurgical process facility 

in Goiania, and at the laboratory of Paulo Abib Engenharia S.A., a mining engineering company 

subsequently acquired by Kilborn Engineering, now SNC-Lavalin Inc., located in São Paulo.  The 

emphasis at that time was on gravity concentration techniques since the property was only 

accessible by light aircraft or small boats, and other infrastructure was negligible. 

This work terminated in a positive economic evaluation of working the Piaba deposit using mining 

equipment from Cesbra's tin operations in Rondonia, a gravity-only process plant and diesel 

powered electricity generation.  At the same time, a technical study report and an Environmental 

Impact Assessment to mine the weathered part of the Piaba deposit were submitted to government 

agencies and public audiences were held. 

While this work was being finalized, Gencor was in the process of acquiring the Billiton minerals 

assets from Royal Dutch/Shell.  Following that acquisition in 1994, Gencor conducted a strategic 

review of the enlarged business and determined that it would divest or spin off all its gold assets and 

would spend no more money on gold exploration.  As a result, Unamgen terminated its joint venture 

with Cesbra in 1995. 

In 1996, Gencor agreed to sell its gold assets in Brazil to Eldorado and in the process introduced 

Eldorado to Cesbra.  This resulted in a new project joint venture with Unamgen as a subsidiary of 

Eldorado as the operator.  In 1997, an exploration program commenced that included diamond and 

RC drilling of the extensions of the Piaba deposit along strike to the east and west. This lasted less 

than a year due to the deterioration of market conditions for junior mining stocks at that time.  In the 

period 1991 to 1997, approximately 22,000 m were drilled (core and RC) at Aurizona by Unamgen.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Apart from minor work necessary to maintain title, no further systematic exploration or development 

activity was carried out until Luna acquired 100% of MASA from both venture partners in January 

2007.  In the meantime, the regional infrastructure has improved considerably in terms of road 

access, telecommunications and grid power availability. 

4.1 Prior Ownership and Ownership Changes 
In January 2007 Luna completed a purchase agreement (the `Purchase Agreement`) to acquire all 

of the outstanding shares of Aurizona Goldfields Corporation, which ultimately holds the Aurizona 

assets through the Brazilian entity, from Brascan and Eldorado.  In July 2011, all obligations were 

satisfied in regards to the Purchase Agreement by Luna. 

4.2 Previous Exploration and Development Results 
Unamgen conducted exploration on Aurizona, first as a subsidiary of Gencor, and later as a 

subsidiary of Eldorado.  This work was strongly focused in Aurizona area. 

4.2.1 Gencor (1991 to 1995) 

Initial work at Aurizona was carried out by Unamgen as the joint venture operator from 1991 to 1993 

and was focused on identifying bulk tonnage, gold deposits amenable to open pit mining methods.  

Saprolite and Fresh rock mineralization was discovered during this program.  Work programs carried 

out during this period include: 

Airborne (Heli) Magnetic and Radiometric Survey (1991) 

 Contractor: AERODAT; 
 Flight Line Spacing: 200 m; 
 Tie Line Spacing: 2 km; 
 Flight Line Direction: 162º; 
 Control Line Direction: 072º; 
 Area Flown: 182 km2; and 
 Flight Lines: 1045 km. 

Interpretations of these data were made by Gencor in 1991.  Particular emphasis was given to the 

identification of the regional structural trend, the extent of the greenstone of the Aurizona Group, and 

magnetic stratigraphy. 

Ground Geophysical Surveys 

 Magnetometry; 
 Time Domain Induced Polarization (IP); 
 Frequency Domain Electro Magnetics (EM); 
 Electro-resistivity; 
 VLF; and 
 Gamma-spectrometry. 

IP was one of the more successful historic survey methods in determining structural controls on gold 

mineralization at Piaba by locating the footwall graphitic metavolcanic unit that broadly delimits the 

southern margin of the deposit.  Magnetics and gamma-spectrometry were also useful in defining the 

geological trend in the wider Aurizona area.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Aerophotogrametric Survey (1:25,000) 

A photogeological survey covering an area of 270 km2 was conducted based on interpretation of 

1:25,000 scale black and white aerial photographs with photo-restituted maps at 1:10,000 scale. This 

work was carried out by Prospecções e Aerolevantamentos S.A. ("Prospec").  The main features 

which were observed are east/northeast striking lineaments truncated by northwest trending 

structures.  Discrete circular features are also apparent. 

Soil Geochemical Data (Aurizona) 

A total of twelve detailed soil grids were established with lines spaced at 100 m and with sample 

stations at 25 m.  Samples were analyzed for Au, As, Cu, Mo, Pb, Ni and Zn.  This program defined 

a major east/northeast trending soil gold anomaly encompassing the Piaba and Tatajuba deposits 

and also defined anomalies at several near mine exploration targets.  Piaba was defined by a wide 

Au anomaly associated with moderate Cu and Zn values with outboard as associated with 

garimpeiro pits.  At Tatajuba, Au displays a strong correlation with As. 

Geologic Mapping and Sampling (Garimpo Pits) 

Due to the lack of outcrop in the project area geologic mapping was limited to garimpeiro pits.  The 

pits were channel-sampled and mapped with the objective of determining geological controls on the 

gold mineralization and grade distribution.  The program indicated that the laterite and saprolite are 

mineralized and that gold bears a strong correlation with both sub-horizontal and sub-vertical and 

stockwork quartz veins.  

Auger Drilling 

Shallow drilling via both manual and mechanized augers was used to verify the gold anomalies 

generated by the soil sampling and to evaluate certain garimpeiro tailings dumps in the project area.  

Holes were drilled to an average depth of 8 m.  

Drilling (RC and Diamond) 

Unamgen drilled 142 diamond drill holes (BRAZD001 to BRAZD142) using mostly HQ (63.5 mm) 

diameter core at Aurizona, the majority of which were cited in the oxide zone of the Piaba deposit.  

Unamgen also drilled 67 RC holes (BRAZP001 to BRAZP067) which were also concentrated in the 

oxide zone of the Piaba deposit.  Drilling at Piaba was initially conducted on 50 m spaced sections 

and later infilled to irregular 25 m sections in the Central Zone.  Unamgen also drilled several nearby 

targets including Tatajuba and Micote.  All the Unamgen drilling was carried out by a private Brazilian 

drilling firm, Serviços Técnicos Minerais Ltda ("Seta"). 

Economic Viability Study (1994) 

In 1994, Unamgen commissioned Paulo Abib Engenharia to produce an economic viability study and 

environmental impact assessment to mine the oxide gold mineralization at Piaba. 

4.2.2 Eldorado Gold Corp (1996 to 1997) 

The joint venture was terminated by Unamgen in 1995 due to Gencor's decision to exit the gold 

business.  In 1996, Eldorado acquired Gencor's gold assets in Brazil, including Unamgen.  Eldorado 

exercised Unamgen's buyback option in 1997 and commenced additional exploration with Unamgen 

as the operator.  Work carried out during this period included the following. 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 14 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Drilling (RC and Diamond) 

Eldorado drilled 61 diamond drillholes (BRAZD143 to BRAZD203) at Aurizona using HQ (63.5 mm) 

diameter core, the majority of which were located in the oxide portions of the Piaba and Tatajuba 

deposits.  At Piaba, Unamgen drilled east and west extensions and extended the deposit strike.  In 

addition, some holes were drilled into the deeper portions of the Piaba deposit to test the Fresh rock 

potential.  Unamgen also drilled 26 RC holes (BRAZP068 to BRAZP092A) which were also 

concentrated in the oxide portion of the Piaba deposit.  Several of these were twin holes to pre-

existing diamond drillholes and were drilled to assess the comparability in gold grade between 

diamond and reverse circulation at Piaba.  Unamgen also conducted scout drilling at several near 

mine exploration targets including Boa Esperança, Pé Grande, Ferradura and Conceição.  All 

Unamgen drilling during this period was carried out by a private Brazilian drilling firm Pesquisas 

Geológicas Ltda ("Geoserv"). 

Airborne (Fixed Wing) Magnetic and Radiometric Survey (1996) 

 Contractor: Geomag; 
 Flight Line Spacing: 250 m; 
 Tie Line Spacing: 2.5 km; 
 Flight Line Direction: 160º; 
 Area Flown: 11,270 km2; and 
 Flight Lines: 22,863 km. 

Due to the downturn in the gold price in 1997 Unamgen shut down exploration in Brazil and 

conducted no further exploration work on the property. 

4.2.3 Brascan (1999 to 2000) 

In 1999, Brascan commissioned a gravity pilot plant to test the Saprolite and garimpeiro tailings at 

Piaba.  The pilot plant testwork was completed in February 2000.  The property was placed on care 

and maintenance from 2000 until March 2007, when Luna commenced a new exploration program at 

Aurizona initially focused on the Piaba and Tatajuba deposits and more recently included systematic 

exploration of the Aurizona area via soil sampling, geologic mapping, geophysical surveying, shallow 

auger drilling, trenching, diamond and reverse circulation drilling. 

4.3 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 
Table 4.3.1 lists the historical Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources at Aurizona.  The 

Unamgen and Aurizona resources were estimated prior to the institution of NI 43-101 guidelines and 

are presented for interest only and should not be relied upon.  The Unamgen resources were also 

estimated prior to NI 43-101 guidelines and were publicly reported by Eldorado between 2000 and 

2005 (Eldorado, 2005).  These resource estimates are not compliant with CIM resource categories. 

The 2006 initial Aurizona resources were presented in a NI 43-101 Technical Report in that year and 

the 2008 resources were presented in a NI 43-101 Technical Report in 2008.  The 2009 resources 

were presented in a NI 43-101 Technical Report in 2010. The 2011 resources were presented in a NI 

43-101 Technical Report in 2012.  All these reports are filed on SEDAR.

5 Geological Setting and Mineralization (Item 7) 

5.1 Regional Geology 
Aurizona is located within the São Luis Craton ("SLC"), defined by Almeida (1976) as the 

Precambrian continental crust at the border between the states of Pará and Maranhão in northern 

Brazil (Figure 5.1.1).  The SLC extends approximately 400 km east-west and 120 km north-south 

and consists of a metavolcano-sedimentary succession ("Aurizona Group"), subordinate volcanic 

rocks and several granitoid suites (Tromaí Intrusive Suite) which are covered by Phanerozoic 

sedimentary basin deposits and recent coastal sediments (Klein, et al., 2005).  Collectively the 

Aurizona Group and Tromaí Intrusive Suite are referred to as the Granite Greenstone Terrane of 

Northwest Maranhão.  The SLC and the Paleoproterozoic basement rocks of the Neoproterozoic 

Gurupi Belt in northern Brazil are part of an orogen having an early accretionary phase at 2,240 to 

2,150 Ma and a late collisional phase at 2080 ± 20 Ma (Klein and Moura, 2008).  Exposure of the 

SLC within the Phanerozoic cover sequence is related to Cretaceous tectonic uplift and doming that 

preceded the rifting and opening of the Atlantic Ocean and subsequent erosive removal of more than 

6 km of Mesozoic and Paleozoic sediments (Rezende and Pamplona, 1970).  Despite the extent of 

the SLC, outcrop is limited to discontinuous erosive and tectonic windows within the sedimentary 

cover.  The western limit of the SLC is defined by the Tracuatuea Intrusive Suite and the eastern limit 

is placed approximately 30 km east of the state capital of Maranhão, São Luis.  The southern 

boundary is defined by the regionally important north/northwest-south/southeast trending sinistral 

strike-slip Tentugal Shear Zone (Hasui, et al., 1984) which contains the gold deposits of the Gurupi 

Gold Belt.  The northern contact is not well defined due to the Phanerozoic coastal basins.  

The rock associations inferred geologic settings and the crustal evolution displayed by the SLC are 

similar to that described in Paleoproterozoic domains of major geotectonic units of the South 

American Platform including the São Francisco Craton, the southeastern Guyana Shield and the 

West African Craton.  Several studies (Hurley, et al., 1967; Torquato and Cordani, 1981; Lesquer et 

al., 1984; Brito Neves et al., 2001) suggest that the SLC is a fragment of the West African Craton 

that was left behind on the South American Platform following the break-up of the Pangea super 

continent (Figure 5.1.2).

5.1.1 Lithology 

In general terms, the regional geology may be divided into three major terrains: the Maranhão 

Granite-Greenstone Terrain, the Tentugal or Gurupi Shear Belt and the sedimentary basins.  The 

following regional units are described (lithotypes, metamorphism, deformation and metallogeny) from 

oldest to youngest. 

Aurizona Group 

The Aurizona Group hosts the mineralization in Aurizona area, including Piaba, Tatajuba, Boa 

Esperança, Ferradura, Conceição and the near mine exploration targets (Figure 5.1.1.1) and 

consists of a well-developed metavolcanosedimentary sequence of schists, intermediate to mafic 

metavolcanics and metapyroclastic rocks, as well as subordinate quartzites, banded iron formation 

("BIF") and metachert which collectively define a classic Greenstone Belt sequence.  This sequence 

is intruded by granitic intrusives, predominantly tonalites and quartz diorites which are mineralized 

where they occur within the deposits.  Metamorphic grade is chlorite zone greenschist facies.  The 

rocks of the Aurizona Group display a well-developed regional foliation that strikes between N15Wº 

and N70ºW and dips steeply (70º) to the northeast.  Limited age dating of a metapyroclastic unit by 

Klein and Moura (2001) yielded an age of 2240 ± 5 Ma.  More recent Pb evaporation and Nd isotope 

data (Klein et al., 2005) indicate that the Aurizona Group developed from 2,240 Ma to approximately 

2,200 to 2,180 Ma from juvenile protoliths.  The Aurizona Group is considered to have formed in an 

island-arc setting (Klein et al., 2005) and hosts most of the gold mineralization discovered to date in 

the northern portion of the SLC.

Tromaí Intrusive Suite 

The Tromaí Intrusive Suite is the most widespread unit in the SLC and consists of a suite of 

composite anorogenic batholiths of tonalite, trondhjemite, granodiorite and minor monzogranite with 

variable textural and structural characteristics.  It represents a major magmatic event.  The rocks are 

porphyritic to equigranular in texture and either foliated or massive.  They display well-preserved 

primary igneous mineralogy and textures locally overprinted by subsequent metamorphic and 

hydrothermal events.  Pastana (1995) and Klein (2004) described the Tromaí Intrusive Suite as 

metaluminous and sodic in character with low to moderate K2O contents.  The rare earth (REE) and 

other minor and trace element patterns display a calc-alkaline signature (Klein, et al., 2005).  The 

Tromaí Intrusive Suite also shows low Rb/Sr and moderate to high Ba/La and Sr/Y ratios which led 

Klein (2004) to interpret the suite as having both calc-alkaline and TTG properties characteristic of 

melts derived from mantle edge and/or subducted oceanic crust (Klein et al., 2005).  Limited age 

dating (Sato, 1998) provide a Sm-Nd model age (TDM) of 2.1 Ga with Nd(t) of +2.5.  Recent studies 

(Klein et al., 2005) suggest that the Tromaí Intrusive Suite locally intruded the Aurizona Group and 

formed in an oceanic island arc setting between 2,168 and 2,147 Ma.  Dacite and rhyodacite 

lithologies associated with the Tromaí Intrusive Suite are considered as extrusive equivalents of the 

granitoids (Costa, et al., 1977) and differ from the metavolcanosedimentary succession of the 

Aurizona Group in that they are not strongly metamorphosed and generally undeformed. 

Viseu and Igarapé de Areia Formations 

The Viseu and Igarapé de Areia formations consist of continental clastic sediments dominated by 

sandstones, arkoses and conglomerates that were deposited in fault-bounded extensional basins 

overlying rocks of the SLC (Abreu et al., 1980; Pastana, 1995).  The rocks are weakly 

metamorphosed (sub-greenschist) and display well-preserved sedimentary structures and large-

scale open folds.  The dominant foliation strikes northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest.  

Recent dating of the detrital zircons (Pinheiro et al., 2003) determined two age populations: an older 

population with ages between 2,100 and 2,160 Ma and a younger population with ages between 500 

and 700 Ma.  The Igarapé de Areia Formation is considered to be equivalent to the Tarkwaian 

sedimentary sequence of Ghana (Klein and Lopes, 2009). 

5.1.2 Structure and Geodynamic Evolution 

Structural trends throughout the SLC are dominated by north/northeast-south/southwest and 

west/northwest-east/southeast trending structures.  The metavolcano-sedimentary succession 

displays the best regional foliation which strikes northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast 

dipping at moderate to high angles.  Mapping, airborne geophysics, and photo interpretation carried 

out by Luna show a clear northeast-southwest structural and lithological orientation.  The volcano-

sedimentary rocks normally show a subvertical dip and a distinct orientation of their schistosity and 

banding in the same direction.  Discrete shear zones, up to a few tens of meters wide and several 

kilometers long are common and cross-cut both the intrusive and supracrustal lithologies (Klein et 

al., 2005).  Zones of mylonitization occur although their extent is limited.  There is a strong 

association between gold occurrences and structural lineaments which form distinct gold corridors.  

The rocks of the area represent a Paleoproterozoic accretionary terrane associated with the Trans-

Amazonian orogeny (2.2 - 1.9 Ga). 

The geodynamic evolution of the SLC may be divided into five phases (Klein et al., 2005), 

summarized below and graphically depicted in Figure 5.1.2.1:

 Paleoproterozoic accretionary phase.  Opening of an oceanic basin, formation of intra-
oceanic island arcs, onset of subduction producing calc-alkaline magmatism and 

concomitant erosion and partial melting of the island arc; 

 Paleoproterozoic collision of the intra-oceanic island arc with an Archean continent, 
producing deformation, crustal thickening, amphibolite facies metamorphism and 

peraluminous granites; 

 Rifting of the crust amalgamated in the Paleoproterozoic, deposition of continental immature 
sediments, and intrusion of the granitoids; 

 Evolution of the continental rift probably to a continental margin, sedimentation subduction 
and production of felsic magmatism; and 

 Closure of the orogenic basin and collision with thickened crust producing metamorphism, 
deformation and partial melting.

5.1.3 Weathering Profile 

Aurizona is situated in an area of low relief with occasional higher elevations centered on lateritic 

plateaus and more resistant intrusive complexes.  Laterite and alluvium cover the area and hence 

outcrops of bedrock are very rare and generally limited to shallow garimpeiro excavations.  The 

lateritic profile is well developed and consists of a dark red, iron-rich, limonite/goethite, lateritic crust, 

with quartz granules and grains cemented by an iron oxide matrix.  The laterite has an average 

thickness of 4 m and may contain gold, predominantly of residual origin.  Gold is locally mechanically 

dispersed in the upper surface horizons from quartz veins, mainly those from the subcropping 

bedrock.  The saprolite profile is very mature and locally attains depths up to 100 m.     

5.2 Local and Property Geology 

5.2.1 Local Lithology 

The Aurizona area is underlain by east/northeast trending greenstone volcano sediments and acid 

intrusives of the Aurizona Group and Tromai Intrusive Suite.  There is a strong structural control on 

the gold mineralization in the Aurizona area which can be seen by the close association of magnetic 

lineaments and the gold deposits and the near mine exploration targets (Figure 5.2.1.1). 

Mineralization is hosted within district scale shear zones and generally at or close to contacts with a 

volcano sedimentary unit which generally forms the footwall to the mineralization. 

Piaba is a 3.3 km long, east/northeast trending, orogenic gold deposit hosted in greenstone belt 

rocks of the Aurizona Group located within the east/northeast trending Aurizona Shear Zone 

("ASZ").  The ASZ has been traced for several kilometers within Company tenements and also hosts 

the Tatajuba gold deposit, a near mine deposit at Aurizona, located 2.4 km west/southwest of Piaba 

(Figure 5.2.1.1).  The footwall of the Piaba deposit is a distinctive volcano sedimentary unit which 

dips steeply to the north.  The principal hanging wall lithologies are felsic intrusives, predominantly 

tonalite and quartz porphyry and dacite volcanics intruded by minor dikes.  Metamorphic grade is 

greenschist faces ("chlorite zone").  The host units are intensely overprinted by several 

hydrothermal and mineralizing events including sericitization, chloritization, graphitization, 

carbonization and silicification which frequently mask the host protolith.  Gold mineralization 

preferentially occurs within the tonalite and quartz porphyry units due to the fact that they are more 

brittle and fractured more easily than the volcanics and thus provided greater permeability for 

mineralizing gold fluids within the shear zone.  Piaba is a large, low-grade, deeply weathered 

(average depth of oxidation is 60 m) tabular-shaped gold deposit dipping north/northwest.  Zones 

(shoots) of high-grade gold mineralization controlled by oblique shear zones occur within the lower-

grade deposit.  These high-grade zones are controlled by structures oblique to the main ore body 

strike.  Drilling to date has been focused on defining the strike and depth extent of the main ore 

body.  However, future drilling will also target the high-grade lodes at depth. 

The widest portion of the Piaba deposit is located at a bend in the ASZ.  Analysis of structural fabrics 

and textures in drill core shows limited shear fabrics (confined to graphitic slip planes) which indicate 

that the maximum depth of current drilling has mainly tested the brittle and brittle-ductile transition 

zones of the Piaba deposit.  The deposit is currently open at depth on all drill sections within the 3.3 

km strike.  

The Tatajuba, Boa Esperança, Ferradura and Conceição deposits and the near mine exploration 

targets are hosted by similar lithological units and structural settings as the Piaba deposit.

5.2.2 Weathering Profile 

The Aurizona area consists of a peneplain dissected into rounded flat knolls and bordered and 

interdigitated with Holocene marine and fluvio-marine sediments.  At the Piaba deposit, the 

mineralized intrusive and volcanic sequence within the ASZ is weathered to an average depth of 60 

m, below which primary gold mineralization occurs in less weathered to unweathered, sulfide-bearing 

rocks.  The weathering profile at Piaba is similar to that at other mines in the Guyana Shield 

including the Changement Mine (French Guiana) and Rosebel (Suriname).  At Piaba, the surface 

lateritic profile is well developed and consists of a dark red, iron-rich lateritic crust with quartz 

fragments and grains cemented by an iron oxide matrix, which frequently has a pisolithic aspect in its 

lower portion.  The laterite has an average thickness of 4 m and shows gold enrichment where it 

overlies bedrock mineralization.   

In December 2007, MASA commissioned Golder Associates Brasil Consultoria e Projectos Ltda. 

(Golder) to conduct a geotechnical study of all the historic and current diamond drillholes to be used 

in the resource and reserve estimate for Piaba and Tatajuba.  This study was conducted to provide a 

consistent system for classification of the weathering profile from surface to Fresh rock.  The 

following three zones were identified:  Saprolite, Transition Zone and Fresh Rock.  This classification 

standardized the weathering profile within the deposit and enabled the creation of surfaces between 

the saprolite and transition zone and between the transition zone and the fresh rock.  The saprolite is 

classed as oxide mineralization, the fresh rock as sulfide and the transition rock as predominantly 

sulfide.  The average depth of the oxide mineralization is 60 m. In 2012, Luna modeled the upper 

laterite profile separately from the saprolite profile. 

5.2.3 Structure 

The Piaba deposit represents an east/northeast trending mineralized envelope of low-grade gold 

mineralization within a major east/northeast trending shear zone in the Aurizona Group.  The 

mineralized envelope displays several flexures along its length though it is not significantly faulted.  

There is a clear-cut stratigraphic and structural footwall to the south of the deposit defined by a sub-

vertical to steeply north-dipping volcano-sedimentary package.  Shearing occurs locally along the 

footwall contact. 

Apart from minor foliated igneous rocks, intense ductile shearing is not observed in the deposit at the 

depth drilled to date and, where it occurs, is localized and confined to strongly altered lithologies 

which acted as slip horizons, particularly graphitic and hydrothermally altered structures.  The 

tonalite/volcanic hanging wall package and thicker beds within the footwall volcano sediments show 

essentially only a healed brittle deformation.  Remnant sedimentary features such as graded 

bedding, erosion channels and truncated trough bedding occur on a very fine scale in the footwall 

sediments.  

In November 2011, Luna retained John Fedorowich, Senior Structural Geologist, with Itasca 

Consulting, Canada Inc. to conduct a structural mapping program at the Piaba deposit.  The work 

was carried out from November 16 to 26, 2011 in collaboration with exploration and operational 

geology staff.  The purpose of the program was to understand the structural controls on the gold 

mineralization and provide guidance on the positioning of deep holes to intersect higher grade 

mineralization down plunge of the deposit.  Work involved mapping of deposit lithology and 

structures on cleaned walls and benches between sections 0325W and 0725W at -08 to -14 levels.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

The outline and attributes of exposed lithologies and structural point measurements were taken in 

Arcpad v10 using a Topcon model GRS-1 DGPS unit and WAAS real time differential GPS 

correction which provided 0.5 m accuracy.  Lithological contacts, shears, and veins were paint-

marked on the benches for survey to centimeter accuracy with an optical total station instrument by 

Mine Survey crews.  Where necessary, positions were corrected to this final survey data. 

In addition, three drillholes, BRAZD029, BRAZD290A and BRAZD395 were logged in order to view 

structures in core and correlate with structures mapped in the pit.  The principal structures mapped 

are E-W shears, oblique shears, quartz+/-tourmaline veins, and local meso-scale folds.  Preliminary 

conclusions of this work show that: 

 A set of 1 to 5 m thick, dominantly steeply dipping, discontinuous shears cut the tonalite 
oblique to its footwall contact with metasediments; 

 Within the population of 35 mapped shears, 4 sets are interpreted, and these vary in shear 
sense from strike slip to dip slip; 

 Intense graphitic and hematite alteration is contemporaneous with the shears, and is 
dispersed in significant haloes outward from the shear margins; 

 Arrays of dominantly-shallow quartz-tourmaline veins are mutually cross-cutting with the 
shears and are therefore contemporaneous; 

 The higher grade gold zones appear to be controlled by the shears, and visible gold was 
seen in quartz tourmaline veins within one of the oblique shear sets; and 

 Shears have a mix of ductile and brittle characteristics consistent with formation in the brittle-
ductile transition zone. 

5.2.4 Alteration 

The alteration assemblage at Aurizona is classified as strong to intense, particularly in the center of 

the Piaba deposit where it overprints the primary lithologies.  Piaba consists of a central elongate 

core of shattering where initial graphitization was overprinted by a later proximal chlorite and iron-

carbonate alteration event, and a more distal chlorite-dolomite alteration with dolomitic veinlets, 

grading into background chlorite sub-facies greenschist regional metamorphism.  Oblique shears 

control zones of hydrothermal alteration.  The main alteration consists of graphite enrichment, 

chlorite +iron carbonate alteration and clay development.  The graphite in the deposit is believed to 

have been sourced from the footwall sediments at depth in the structure.  Graphitization was 

succeeded by an intense chlorite +iron carbonate event.  Iron carbonates appear related to the 

chlorite overprint and are zoned outwards in fractures from ankerite to siderite.  Zones of white, 

matrix-destructive albite flooding occur locally, presumably associated with the chlorite overprint 

event.  Silicification is rare and appears largely controlled by steep to sub-vertical interflow contacts 

and (coincident) sub-vertical vein zones in association with massive chlorite. 

5.3 Significant Mineralized Zones 
Mineralization at Aurizona occurs in east/northeast trending, near vertical structures (Figure 5.2.1.1).  

The Piaba, Tatajuba, Boa Esperança, Ferradura and Conceição deposits have been defined to 

resource stage by drilling and several other near mine targets have also been identified and some 

have been drilled in the past.  Luna conducted several exploration programs at the near mine targets 

between 2010 and 2013 and several others are drill ready.

5.3.1 Piaba 

The airborne magnetic geophysical data show that the regional magnetic stratigraphy of the 

Aurizona Group is disrupted in the Piaba deposit which suggests that mineralization is associated 

with magnetite-destructive alteration.  The Piaba deposit has a strike length of 3.3 km and trends 

east/northeast (Figure 5.3.1.1 and 5.3.1.2).  The primary mineralization is hosted by highly fractured 

tonalite, quartz porphyry and a dacite volcanic sequence bounded to the south by a well-defined 

sub-vertical to north-dipping footwall formed by a distinctive volcano-sedimentary sequence 

containing graphitic-pyritic sediments.  A well-defined mineralized envelope, defined by a 0.30 g/t Au 

cutoff, is associated with intense hydrothermal alteration and quartz veining.  Mineralization does not 

generally occur tight to the footwall, rather it is generally located between 10 and 30 m from the 

footwall contact. 

Near the surface, there is a clear chemical and mechanical dispersion of gold which caps and flanks 

the mineralized trend.  This gold occurs at the base of the ferruginous laterite cap.  This gold cap is 

localized to the immediate environs of the primary deposit and does not form a broad zone of surface 

gold distribution at Piaba. 

Piaba is a large low-grade gold deposit within a major shear zone containing second and possibly 

third order structures which control high-grade ore shoots attaining values up to 30 g/t Au and higher.  

Mineralization occurs within the volcanic sequence though preferentially occurs within tonalite and 

quartz porphyry intrusions, due to their competency contrast with the volcanics.  The widest portion 

of the deposit is located at a bend in the ASZ which is an area where increased extension likely 

occurred.  Mineralization is strongly associated with quartz veining.  

The alteration assemblage is composed of quartz, chlorite, carbonate (ankerite and calcite), graphite, 

alkali feldspar, sericite, pyrite and minor amounts of tourmaline.  Mineralization and alteration are 

strong to intense particularly within the center of the deposit.  Metamorphic grade is chlorite zone 

greenschist facies.  Quartz occurs in vein form and in silicification fronts.  Chlorite occurs as matrix 

replacement and in veinlets and its intensity is likely linked to the occurrence of mafic wall rocks.  

Ankerite and carbonate occur as matrix replacement and in veinlets and commonly as accessory 

minerals in quartz veins.  Tourmaline occurs solely in quartz veins.  Both tourmaline and calcite 

appear to increase with depth.  Pyrite occurs in quartz veins although it predominantly forms a matrix 

replacement, particularly at deeper levels.  Minor pyrrhotite occurs at deeper levels.  Graphite 

alteration is locally moderate to strong and is closely associated with gold mineralization.  The 

graphite may have been sourced from the footwall at deeper levels in the ASZ early in the deposit 

formation and subsequently acted as a reductant trap for gold mineralizing fluids.  Graphite 

introduction also occurred along oblique shears.  No significant base metals occur at Piaba (Figure 

5.3.1.3).

5.3.2 Deposit Paragenesis 

 Deposition of graphitic-rich, tuffaceous volcanosediments in a shallow anoxic to dysaerobic 
environment; 

 Rapid deposition of an unsorted volcanic pile, possibly proximal to a volcanic vent; 
 Tilting and isoclinal folding with probable associated greenschist facies metamorphism.  

Strain accommodated by bedding plane slip in the intrusive-volcanic package and thicker 

sediment beds acting as rigid blocks.  Development of regional shears (including the ASZ) 

along the volcano sedimentary sequence contacts; 

 Intrusion of tonalitic and acid intrusives into the ASZ; 
 Intense tectonic shattering along the structure with an inferred deep seated hydrothermal 

cell, remobilizing graphite from the footwall sediments into the shears zones; 

 Overprint by chlorite-iron carbonate alteration along the existing fractures; 
 Introduction of disseminated pyrite; 
 Auriferous quartz veining in both vertical and horizontal veins.  Reduction of gold-bearing 

fluids by graphite; 

 Auriferous sulfidic and chlorite-sulfide veining; and 
 Remobilization of gold along shatter zones and quartz vein boundaries. 

5.3.3 Tatajuba 

The Tatajuba Deposit is located 2.4 km west/southwest from Piaba within the ASZ (Figure 5.2.1.1).  

The deposit extends over an 800 m strike length and, like Piaba, contains gold mineralization 

associated with a sub-vertical to moderately north-dipping structure within the ASZ.  Mineralization is 

hosted in a mafic to ultramafic volcano-sedimentary sequence and is similar to Piaba although the 

alteration and mineralization zone at Tatajuba is more restricted and the weathering profile less 

deep.  Quartz veins are essentially absent and gold mineralization is associated with sheeted pyrite 

veinlets.  There is a strong weathering overprint to the alteration zones at Tatajuba, in addition to a 

zone of strong fracturing infilled by graphite, which has been overprinted by a later chlorite-iron 

carbonate fracture controlled alteration.  There is an abrupt change above the base of weathering 

into what appears to be essentially "unaltered" andesite.  The background alteration is chlorite and 

albite with calcite/dolomite. Tatajuba is open to the east, west and at depth (Figure 5.3.3.1).

5.3.4 Boa Esperança 

The Boa Esperança Deposit and target is represented by a long linear gold-in-soil anomaly 

associated with a well defined magnetic structure located 1 km due southeast of the Piaba deposit 

(Figure 5.2.1.1). Luna conducted soil surveying and geologic mapping followed by a shallow auger 

drill program, trenching and a ground geophysical survey at this target. Luna completed 9 diamond 

drillholes totaling 2,184 m and 45 reverse circulation drillholes totaling 3,411 m. Gold mineralization 

at Boa Esperança is hosted in a mixed sequence of intrusives and volcanics and the footwall to the 

mineralization is the same as the Piaba deposit footwall (graphitic volcano-sedimentary sequence). 

Gold mineralization is associated with weak to moderate hydrothermal alteration, including 

chloritization, carbonization and tourmalinization (Figure 5.3.4.1).

5.3.5 Ferradura 

The Ferradura deposit is located 1.7 km due southeast of the Piaba deposit (Figure 5.2.1.1). Luna 

initially conducted soil surveying and geologic mapping followed by a shallow auger drill program, 

trenching and a ground geophysical survey. In 2012, Luna drilled 10 diamond drillholes totaling 

1,528 m and 10 reverse circulation drillholes totaling 600 m. This drill program successfully defined 

two sub-parallel mineralized bodies separated by a central fault. Mineralization trends east/northeast 

along a 0.60 km strike length and, like Boa Esperança, is hosted in a sub-vertical shear zone that is 

steeply dipping to the north. Gold mineralization occurs within tonalites consistent with Piaba deposit 

geology, and the dominant alteration assemblage consists of chlorite, graphite and pyrite (Figure 

5.3.5.1).

5.3.6 Conceição 

The Conceição deposit is located 1.6 km due south/southeast of the Piaba deposit and 0.5 km 

west/southwest along strike from the Ferradura target and hosted within the same shear zone 

(Figure 5.2.1.1). Luna initially conducted soil surveying and geologic mapping followed by a shallow 

auger drill program, trenching and a ground geophysical survey. Best trench results were 26.00 m @ 

0.62 g/t Au including 2.00 m @ 2.02 g/t Au in trench COTR200W. In 2012 Luna drilled 3 diamond 

drillholes totaling 400 m and 10 reverse circulation drillholes totaling 584 m. This drill program 

defined three sub-parallel mineralized bodies trending east/northeast along a 0.35 km strike length. 

Mineralization is hosted in a sub-vertical shear zone and is steeply dipping to the north. Gold 

mineralization occurs within tonalites consistent with the Piaba deposit geology. However, like 

Ferradura, a BIF unit is also spatially associated with mineralization. The dominant alteration 

assemblage consists of chlorite and pyrite. 

5.3.7 Near Mine Targets 

Over ten near mine gold targets occur in the immediate vicinity of the Piaba deposit (Figure 5.2.1.1).  

Until recently exploration at these targets has been limited to historic soil and auger sampling 

programs and scout drill programs which returned encouraging results.  Luna has conducted several 

surface exploration programs at these targets and several are now at drill ready stage. 

The near mine targets which occur to the north and south of the main Piaba deposit may occur along 

separate sub-parallel shear zones/splays or they may occur along flower structures which developed 

in the principal deformation zone of the ASZ.  Additional exploration of these targets will define the 

structural setting of the deposits.  Several near mine targets are: 

Tatajuba Extensions – Luna soil sampling and auger drill programs have defined surface 

geochemical gold anomalies extending to the east and west of the Tatajuba deposit.  Tatajuba East 

is a narrow cohesive gold-in-soil anomaly extending for 600 m east of the current eastern limit of the 

Tatajuba deposit within the ASZ (Figure 5.2.1.1).  Tatajuba West consists of three cohesive gold-in-

soil anomalies within the ASZ extending over a 1.5 km strike length from the current western limit of 

Tatajuba. 

Micote – Located 3 km east of Piaba on a parallel east/northeast trending structure (Figure 5.2.1.1).  

Mineralization is associated with quartz veining within saprolitic and altered volcanic and volcano 

sedimentary rocks.  Quartz veins have preferred attitudes of N65E/85NW and N50W/80NE and 

occur within a north-dipping structural corridor.  Mineralization defined to date has approximately 300 

m strike extent and is about 25 m thick. 

São Lourenço – Located 3.5 km east of Piaba and 500 m south of Micote.  Gold is associated with 

a volcanic sequence with strong carbonate-pyrite alteration and quartz veining.  Limited drilling has 

not yet identified a coherent mineralized zone.

6 Deposit Type (Item 8) 
The SLC hosts several medium sized deposits and numerous gold occurrences (Figure 5.1.1), 

located on the Atlantic coast and the Gurupi Gold Belt, which forms the southern margin of the 

craton.  Klein et al (2005) defined the gold deposits in the region as structurally-controlled, syn- to 

late-tectonic and post-metamorphic, i.e. essentially orogenic gold deposits.  The Gurupi Gold Belt 

contains several deposits including Chega Tudo, Cipoeiro, Serrinha, Montes Aureos and Cachoeira 

located in the Tentugal Shear Zone ("TSZ") at the boundary between the São Luis Craton and the 

Gurupi Belt.  The TSZ is an approximately 120 km long and 15 to 30 km wide strike-slip corridor of 

intensely deformed metavolcanosedimentary and sedimentary sequences with intercalated intrusives 

displaying sinistral displacement (Costa et al, 1988).  These deposits are generally controlled by 

shear zones along the main TSZ, or splays, and collectively may be classed as orogenic gold 

deposits. 

Luna considers both the Aurizona Group and Tromaí Intrusive Suite as having strong exploration 

potential for gold mineralization.  This is demonstrated by the many garimpeiro pits which occur in 

the region, particularly within the Aurizona area, corroborated by historic exploration data collated 

from previous operators and recent work by Luna.  Gold mineralization is mainly related to shear 

hosted quartz vein systems, sometimes forming swarms and stockworks, and disseminated 

mineralization associated with hydrothermal alteration and shearing.  The gold may occur in 

association with greenstone type volcanic-sedimentary sequences, shear zones in association with 

hydrothermal alteration, quartz vein stockworks in intrusive rocks with associated hydrothermal 

alteration, and laterites and alluvium.   

The paleo-reconstruction of the Pangea continent strongly suggests that the SLC is a fragment of the 

West African Craton that was left behind on the South American Platform following the break-up of 

the Pangea supercontinent (Figure 5.1.2).  The SLC also bears strong similarities to the 

southeastern Guyana Shield.  Geological, geochronological and isotopic evidence also indicate that 

the Brazilian terrains were contiguous with the West African Craton in Paleoproterozoic times (Klein 

and Moura, 2008).  The location of Aurizona between the West African Craton, which hosts the 

Birimian Gold Belt and the southeastern Guyana Shield which hosts several significant gold deposits 

including Las Cristinas (Venezuela), Omai (Guyana) and Rosebel (Suriname) is significant for the 

prospectivity of the district.  Deposits in these gold belts include large shear-zone hosted lode gold 

deposits (Ashanti) and structurally-controlled porphyry deposits (Las Cristinas).  Piaba is classified 

as an orogenic gold deposit. 

6.1 Geological Model 
Piaba is a bulk tonnage, low-grade gold deposit amenable to open pit mining methods situated in a 

tropical environment similar to other gold deposits in this part of South America including the Las 

Cristinas and El Callao gold deposits in Venezuela, the now depleted Omai Gold Mine in Guyana, 

and the Rosebel gold deposit in Suriname.  Gold mineralization at Aurizona is typical of orogenic 

gold deposits formed in regional-scale brittle-ductile structures in supracrustal terranes.  The general 

model for these types of deposits involves the migration of large amounts of hydrothermal fluids 

(generated during collisional orogenesis) within shear zones (particularly within fractured intrusives 

where the permeability is greater than within the country rock).  The hydrothermal fluids carry gold in 

solution until changes in temperature, pressure, reduction potential or pH (traps) facilitate its 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 40

precipitation.  The gold source is likely the country rocks through which metamorphic fluids travel 

before concentrating in the shear zones.  

Mineralization is often continuous to considerable depths in these systems and the 2012 drill 

program intersected gold mineralization to a depth of -600 m RL at Piaba.  Geological modeling 

indicates that mineralization defined to date at Piaba is located within the brittle-ductile deformation 

zone consistent with the model of Groves et al. (1998). Figure 6.1.1 shows a schematic 

representation of a structural model for Aurizona.

7 Exploration (Item 9) 
Exploration on Aurizona was initiated in 1978 by Brascan and continued through the 1990's with 

work by Brascan and Unamgen as a subsidiary of Gencor and later Eldorado.  Luna acquired the 

property in 2007 and commenced exploration soon after.  The historic exploration is discussed in 

Section 4 and Luna's exploration programs are discussed in this section.  

All exploration programs at Aurizona were based at the Aurizona exploration camp.  Luna conducts 

its exploration programs with its own personnel and contracted drilling companies. 

7.1 Airborne Geophysical Survey Interpretation 
In January 2010, Luna retained Reconsult Geofísica Ltda (Reconsult) to reprocess and interpret the 

historic airborne magnetic and radiometric survey data collected by Unamgen in 1991 and 1996.  

Both surveys were reprocessed and merged using Geosoft Oasis Montaj 7.1.1, followed by 

interpretation and integration with existing geological maps and databases in order to improve 

understanding of geologic controls on gold mineralization in Aurizona area.  The data quality of the 

surveys is excellent and no survey correction or decorrugation was required.  Due to the deep 

tropical weathering in the area the radiometric data shows mainly cover sequences and drainage 

patterns.  However, the magnetic database provided important information on the structural control 

on the gold deposits and near mine targets at Aurizona.  These data are used extensively in Luna's 

exploration programs. 

7.2 Geochemical Surveys 
Luna has completed soil sampling and reconnaissance-scale mapping programs covering the entire 

Aurizona area with the objective of defining the surface gold anomalies associated with the near 

mine targets.  These programs are supervised by trained mining technicians who also map the soil 

and laterite profiles during sampling.  Luna also conducts rock grab sampling concomitantly.  

Aurizona soil samples are collected at a nominal depth of 0.50 m on a 100 m x 25 m north-south 

orientated grid which is surveyed using a total station.  Several types of ancillary data including soil 

type, granulometry and magnetism are also recorded.  Samples are assayed for gold via fire assay 

(30 g) and a suite of 35 elements using ICP-AES at ALS Chemex, Belo Horizonte (prep) and ALS 

Chemex, Lima (assay and ICP).  Luna operates a rigorous laboratory Quality Assurance/Quality 

control ("QA/QC") program for soil samples which involves the insertion of blanks, CRM and sample 

duplicates at the rate of 6% of each sample per batch.  

The soil sampling programs have identified the following deposits and near mine targets at Aurizona: 

Boa Esperança, Tatajuba Extensions, Ferradura, Conceição, São Lourenço, Pirocaua SE, Micote, 

Genipapo, Barriguda, Agenor and Pico (Figure 5.2.1.1).  Soil sampling has also been completed 

over the LDW area located on the western side of the Tromai River estuary and several new gold in 

soil anomalies have been defined in this area. 

7.3 Geophysical Surveys 
Luna conducts its own ground magnetic surveys using trained company employees and equipment.  

Luna owns three GSM-19 v7.0 Overhauser Magnetometer Units running Novatel SuperStar II GPS 

board adaptation kits.  One unit serves as a permanent base station and two units are used to collect 

magnetic data over target areas.  Surveys have been completed covering the Tatajuba deposit and 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 42 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

extensions, Boa Esperança, Ferradura, Conceição, São Lourenço, Pirocaua SE, Micote, Genipapo, 

Barriguda, Agenor and Pico. The data are processed by Reconsult.  All deposits and near mine 

targets defined at Aurizona to date are structurally controlled and Luna's in house magnetic surveys 

provide excellent quality data on the structural controls on mineralization. 

Luna will finalize ground magnetic surveys over new mineralized structures where required. 

7.4 Auger Drilling 
Luna has completed several auger drill grids at Aurizona using Company owned motorized Honda 

auger drills fabricated by Trado Equipamentos e Servicos Ltda, Belo Horizonte.  Auger drill teams 

are supervised by trained mining technicians.  Holes are drilled to depth of up to 10 m in lateritic and 

saprolitic terrain.  Samples are collected at 1 m intervals using a 10.16 cm diameter collector.  

Sample weight averages 16 kg.  All data including depth, sample number and geologic information 

are recorded on special log sheets.  Samples are assayed for gold via fire assay (50 g) at ALS 

Chemex, Belo Horizonte (prep) and ALS Chemex, Lima (assay) and ACME Laboratories, Goiania 

(preparation) and ACME Laboratories, Santiago, Chile (assay).  Luna operates a rigorous QA/QC 

program for auger drill samples which involves the insertion of blanks and CRM (6% of each sample 

batch).  

Initially the auger drill programs were focused on condemnation exploration programs in areas 

intended for mine areas and infrastructure.  These were completed in 2009.  Subsequent auger drill 

programs are focused on the systematic testing of the near mine targets associated with structural 

lineaments and in the shallow drilling of the Aurizona gold deposits. Auger drilling has a very low 

environmental impact has been successful in defining sub-cropping mineralization. 

7.5 Trenching 
Luna conducts trench programs to verify and reveal the nature of certain gold anomalies that are 

identified through soil sampling, mapping and auger drill programs.  Trenches are opened 

perpendicular to the anomalies and are useful in determining the extent of subcropping gold 

mineralization and any underlying structures and the occurrence of quartz veins.  Trenches vary in 

depth from 3 to 5 m and are opened using a high-capacity hydraulic excavator.  Trenches are logged 

in detail by Luna geologists prior to sampling, which is conducted in contiguous panels along the 

trench walls.  Samples are collected in plastic bags.  Detailed trench logs are held by Luna. 

7.6 Condemnation Exploration 
Condemnation exploration programs involving soil sampling, channel sampling and auger drilling 

were completed in all areas intended for mine areas and plant infrastructure and reports finalized.  

The following areas were condemned and released for occupation: plant and mill site, waste dump, 

tailings containment facility and the sanitary landfill. Future condemnation programs will be required 

as the project expands into new areas. 

7.7 Diamond Drilling 
Luna conducted diamond drilling in 2007 and 2008 on the Piaba and Tatajuba deposits.  Between 

May 2009 and November 2011 Luna completed a large diamond drill program at the Piaba deposit 

totaling 153 holes. In 2012 Luna conducted resource diamond drilling at the Boa Esperança, 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 43 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Ferradura and Conceição deposits in addition to six deep drillholes and eight infill holes at the Piaba 

deposit. All programs have been highly successful in extending the known mineralization at these 

deposits. 

7.8 Geological Studies 
Luna has conducted detailed geological studies at the Piaba, Tatajuba, Boa Esperança, Ferradura 

and Conceição deposits including re-logging of all drill core and RC chips, petrographic analysis of 

select lithologies and field mapping.  Core logging was done using a dedicated core logging software 

called GeoticLOG.  This work has significantly improved understanding of deposit geology and ore 

controls.   

7.8.1 Actual and Proposed Exploration 

Exploration programs at Aurizona will be assessed in the future as needed.  

7.9 Interpretation 
The exploration programs conducted by Luna and its predecessors are appropriate for gold deposits 

occurring in relatively narrow structures.  The Aurizona property has few rock outcrops and 

geophysical surveys were used to identify structural trends and to refine the geological interpretation 

of the area.  Airborne magnetic and radiometric surveys were used to identify structural trends and 

ground electro-resistivity was used in locating the footwall of the structure.  Because of the lack of 

outcrop, mapping is most useful in the garimpeiro pits.   

The historic drilling includes diamond core and reverse circulation.  Luna is using predominately 

diamond core drilling in the resource areas.  The holes are oriented perpendicular to the strike of the 

structure and angled to intersect the structure at angles between 40° and 20°.

8 Drilling (Item 10) 

8.1 Luna Drilling Procedures 
Luna has conducted drilling programs at Aurizona since its acquisition of the property in January 

2007.  Prior to drill mobilization, the exploration manager obtains all required permits.  A field visit to 

the planned drill sites is conducted to document and photograph the area, vegetation type, proximity 

to any preservation areas and access.   

The exploration manager provides the project geologist and senior project mining technician with the 

information required to commence drilling including: 

 Objective of the drill program; 
 Location of the drill pads; 
 Azimuth, dip and length of drillholes; 
 Sampling and internal QA/QC procedure; 
 Drill core checking and core sampling criteria (intervals); 
 Sample security and chain of custody procedure; 
 Sample shipment procedure; 
 Data transfer procedure; 
 Logging procedure; 
 Company responsibilities; and 
 Drill contractor responsibilities including copy of drill contract. 

Prior to drill mobilization, the senior project mining technician liaises with landowners to discuss the 

program and obtain their authorization for the drill to mobilize to their property.  Drilling only 

commences following agreement with the landowner.  

Daily checks are conducted to ensure that all Company personnel are equipped with Personal 

Protective Equipment ("PPE") and that all tools and ancillary equipment are in good working order. 

Drill Responsibilities 

The exploration manager, in association with the project geologist, is responsible for drill planning 

and hole siting.  Drill programs must have clear objectives to maximize exploration investment and 

are required to be approved by the vice president exploration.  Only one company professional, 

either the exploration manager, project geologist or senior project mining technician, is responsible 

for the drill program and liaising with the drill contractor at any one time. 

The senior project mining technician is responsible for negotiating with local service providers for 

tractor rental, water truck rental, etc.  All contracts must be approved by the exploration manager 

prior to execution. 

Drill pads and access routes are constructed in a manner which minimizes any potential negative 

impact on the environment and landowners. 

The project database coordinator is responsible for checking the daily drill bulletins against the core 

delivered.  Particular attention is given to core recoveries, intervals, core quality and down hole 

survey data.   

The drill contractor is carefully monitored and regulated during mob/demob and drilling. 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 45 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Diamond Drilling 

All diamond drilling is carried out with HQ (63.5 mm) core tools.  The drill hole locations, orientation, 

and planned final depth are checked by the senior project mining technician prior to start of drilling 

each hole.  Azimuth and dip of each drill hole are checked by the senior project mining technician at 

regular intervals during drilling to monitor any deviation which may occur. 

The drill company is informed of the strict requirement to collect quality core samples.  Onsite 

supervision is maintained and site inspection visits are carried out at regular intervals to ensure that 

the contractor is working within the contractual parameters. 

All holes outside the mine area are sealed and marked with a concrete plinth and metal marker 

showing hole azimuth and dip and are surveyed by the company surveyor.  Approximately 1 m of 

casing is left in the top of holes to permanently mark the collar and to allow for down-hole surveys 

which are carried out on all inclined holes using a Devico, a miniature multishot instrument with a 30 

cm diameter, or similar instrument.  This unit is lowered to the bottom of the hole following 

completion and readings are taken on 50 m intervals. 

The surveyed northing, easting and elevation of the hole collar coordinates are entered into the drill 

hole database.  All holes are routinely surveyed for downhole deviation.  However, vertical holes and 

holes in which drill tools were left down hole due to technical problems are not surveyed. 

Procedures at the Drill 

The core boxes are labeled and arrows drawn so that the core is systematically laid in the box.  A 

wooden marker or aluminum tag is placed in the core box after each run and the meters down hole 

are written on the marker.  Transfer of the core from the core barrel to the box is done as carefully as 

possible so that no core is allowed to fall on the ground.  A plastic or rubber mallet is used to loosen 

core from the core tube.  As soon as a core box is full a lid is properly secured.  Regular inspections 

are carried out to ensure that core boxes are clean, sturdy and suitable for core storage.  

Intervals of ground core and any other irregularities are documented to address potential 

inaccuracies in depth labeling of the core boxes.  

Core Transportation Procedure 

Transportation of core from the drill site to the logging facility is conducted in a manner which 

minimizes or eliminates shifting of material in the core boxes.  Transportation and storage of cut or 

split core is conducted in a manner which ensures that the remaining core does not shift and that 

marked sample intervals remain intact. 

Appropriate measures are taken to eliminate the possibility of sample tampering through proper 

chain of custody management and documentation. 

Drill Core Checking 

The core boxes are checked on arrival at the core logging facility to ensure that they are intact.  The 

core boxes are opened sequentially and the core is aligned by matching broken pieces.  The depth 

intervals are measured in each box and any lost core or depth inaccuracies noted.  The boxes are 

labeled with metal or plastic labels listing hole name and interval.  Geotechnical measurements, 

including recovery and RQD, are taken before sample intervals are selected.  This work is carried 

out by trained technicians.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Photography 

All drill core is systematically photographed following the procedure below: 

 Digital core photography is supervised by the database coordinator; 
 Core is photographed in its entirety from top to bottom of hole immediately following interval 

checking and box labeling and prior to logging or sampling; 

 Any excess dirt, grease or drilling fluids are removed and the core is dampened prior to 
photography and sampling; 

 Core photographs are always taken under the same conditions.  Core boxes are 
photographed two at a time in a darkened area with a digital camera and flash; and 

 Core photographs are printed and stored in albums for future reference.  

Core Logging 

Core logging commences following photography.  An initial summary log containing the main 

lithological contacts, structures and mineralization is completed and the core is sent for cutting.  

Detailed core logging restarts when the cut core is returned to the geologist responsible for logging 

the hole. 

Core logging is conducted using dedicated core logging software (GeoticLOG) which contains all 

required data fields including collar, survey, lithology, alteration, structure, mineralization, veins, 

assay, QA/QC and downhole survey.  GeoticLOG enables data export to a variety of database 

programs including Microsoft Excel and Access. 

Datamine software is currently used for plotting logs and sections. 

Sample Security 

Drill core sample security from the drill site to the analytical laboratory is a vital component of the 

drilling program.  Luna's procedure involves direct drill management, secure transportation methods, 

secure sampling and logging areas and secure sample storage facilities.  Core is not left unattended 

and all core and sample storage facilities are locked and monitored when not in use.  Drill samples 

are accompanied from project to the analytical laboratory by Luna personnel. 

Core is secured from outside inspection and interference or accidental internal interference.  Chain 

of custody is maintained during transportation, sample collection, shipping and preparation to avoid 

tampering or inappropriate release of privileged information.  Assay results are maintained 

confidential and only released to those on a need to know basis. 

Reverse Circulation Drilling 

Luna conducted RC drilling at Aurizona in 2011 and 2012. Planning procedures for RC drilling 

closely resemble those utilized for diamond drilling programs. Drill siting is determined by the 

Exploration Manager and approved by the Vice President Exploration. Drill samples are collected at 

continuous 1 m intervals in large plastic sacks. Samples are not quartered on site and the entire 

sample is sealed, labeled and shipped to the commercial sample preparation laboratory following 

Luna's chain of custody. 

8.2 Historic Drilling 
Review of historic drilling, logs, sample records, assay certificates and reports from both previous 

operators (Gencor and Eldorado, both through Unamgen) combined with discussion with staff 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 47 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

present at the time of the historic drilling campaigns has provided Luna with insight into the 

procedures employed by the previous operators.  Luna believes that the historic exploration 

programs were conducted in a manner similar to the current Luna procedures except that drilling 

included RC methods as well as core and an in-house laboratory was used for sample preparation.  

Limited reverse circulation drilling was conducted on the Piaba deposit by Gencor and Eldorado.  

Eldorado conducted a twin drilling program at Piaba in 1997 to compare the repeatability of the 

Gencor and Eldorado diamond drill data and RC drill data in close-spaced twin holes.  The results of 

this program were documented in a report which stated that the Gencor and Eldorado drilling are 

about equal in Au grade and that the Eldorado RC Au data were slightly higher than the Gencor 

diamond drilling.  

8.3 Luna Diamond Drilling 

8.4 Luna Drilling 
Luna conducted diamond drilling in 2007 and 2008 on the Piaba and Tatajuba deposits.  Between 

May 2009 and November 2011 Luna completed a diamond drill program at the Piaba deposit totaling 

153 holes.  In 2012 Luna completed diamond drill programs at Piaba – 14 holes totaling 6933 m, 

Boa Esperança – 9 holes totaling 2184 m, Ferradura – 10 holes totaling 1528 m and Conceição – 3 

holes totaling 400 m. All the Luna diamond drilling was accomplished by a private Brazilian drilling 

firm, Geosol Geologia e Sondagens Ltda (Geosol).  Luna conducted reverse circulation drilling in 

2011 and 2012 at the Boa Esperança, Ferradura and Conceição deposits. The reverse circulation 

drill contractor used was Servitec Sondagem (Servitec). 

The purpose of the drill programs were to: 

 Expand the gold resource; and 
 Further define the geologic model. 

The Piaba resource database includes all drilling through September 2012 and all assays received 

through October 2012.  The total meters in the Piaba resource database is 77,573 m in 941 holes. 

The Tatajuba resource database includes all drilling through February 2, 2008.  A total of 1,802 m of 

diamond drilling has been incorporated into the historic Tatajuba drill database for the resource 

estimate.  The total meters in the Tatajuba resource database are 4,740 m in 45 holes.  No RC 

drilling was conducted at Tatajuba.  

The Boa Esperança resource database includes all drilling through June 2012 and all assays 

received through July 2012. The total meters in the Boa Esperança resource database is 9,015 m in 

246 holes. 

The Ferradura resource database includes all drilling through July 2012 and all assays received 

through August 2012. The total meters in the Ferradura resource database is 5,398 m in 157 holes. 

The Conceição resource database includes all drilling through June 2012 and all assays received 

through July 2012. The total meters in the Conceição resource database is 2,834 m in 101 holes. 

Table 8.4.1 presents a summary of the drilling at the near mine exploration targets.

9 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security (Item 11) 

9.1 Methods 

9.1.1 Historic Sampling Methods 

The sampling methods employed by Unamgen for both Gencor and Eldorado have not been 

documented.  Luna employs senior mining technicians who worked for Unamgen in the 1990's who 

state that the Unamgen methodology for sampling core is similar to that used by Luna.  Core 

recovery was calculated as recovered length divided by drilled length and RC recovery was 

calculated as the sample weight divided by the representative weight of 1 m of sample. 

RC sampling was conducted at 1 m intervals.  For the initial Unamgen RC drillholes, the samples 

were homogenized at the drill site via cone and quartering and ¼ of the sample was sent to the lab.  

For all subsequent RC drillholes, the whole sample was processed at the Aurizona prep lab.   

9.1.2 Luna Gold Sampling Methods 

The project geologist is directly responsible for ensuring that the sampling procedure is carried out to 

the specifications required by the Exploration Manager. 

Sample interval selection is the task of the geologist responsible for core logging.  The sample 

interval is a nominal 2.0 m in barren hanging wall rocks which is reduced 1 m or less within the 

mineralization.  Intervals should not be greater than 2.50 m nor less than 0.20 m.  Sample intervals 

are selected on the basis of lithology, mineralogy, weathering, structures and veins. 

Sample intervals are marked on the core box.  The geologist marks the core using red and yellow 

crayons in two parallel lines separated by 0.3 cm.  The red line is marked on the right side of the 

core, the yellow line on the left.  An arrow is marked pointing down hole on the left side of the core.  

Core is marked respecting any foliation (perpendicular) and in a manner which best produces as 

similar core halves as possible. 

An electric saw is used to cut hard drill core.  Saprolite and soft rock which would suffer washing 

during cutting is cut manually with a large knife or machete.  The saw is washed between each 

sample interval. 

When approved by the geologist, the core is sent for sampling.  Core is consistently sampled on one 

side (right – red line).  The remaining core half is stored in the box for future reference.  The core 

logging geologist checks the sample intervals with the core sampler (mining technician) who is 

responsible for all sampling procedures including the physical insertion of QA/QC controls in the 

sample stream. 

Samples are placed in pre-labeled thick polythene bags and closed with sealed ties.  All samples are 

double bagged for added security.  Each core sample has a specific pre-numbered sample ticket 

with the prefix DH-.  The core sampler notes hole ID, depth, sample type and interval on the sample 

ticket.  A sample ticket number is placed inside the bag.  Internal QA/QC samples (blanks, CRM and 

quarter core duplicates) are assigned routine DH- numbers and tickets.  The sample bags are then 

placed in rice sacks which are sewn shut, addressed and compiled into batches. 

The sample sequence, including the internal control samples (blanks, certified reference material 

and duplicates) are recorded in GeoticLOG.

When the drill core has been sampled it is stored in the core storage facility for future reference. 

Reverse circulation samples are collected at the drill rig by Servitec personnel. The entire sample 

representing 1 m is collected and no sample processing or quartering is conducted on the project. 

The samples are shipped to the commercial assay laboratory where they are dried and processed in 

the same manner as drill core samples. 

9.2 Factors Impacting Accuracy of Results 
The core recovery is good to excellent, averaging over 95%.  The sample intervals are well marked 

and sampled with care.  The drill core was sampled in its entirety. 

9.3 Security Measures 
The core is taken to the Aurizona core storage facility on a daily basis.  The facility is located within a 

walled compound that has 24 hour security.  The core storage building is locked when Luna 

exploration geological staff is not present. 

All samples are transported by truck and one Luna representative accompanies all sample 

shipments.  Public transport is not used. 

9.4 Historic Sample Preparation and Analysis 

9.4.1 Diamond Drill Samples 

Sample preparation for all historic drilling was conducted at a sample preparation laboratory at the 

Aurizona Camp.  This laboratory was designed and set-up by Nomos Laboratories (Nomos).  

Sample preparation for diamond and RC samples is outlined below. 

All Gencor and Eldorado drill samples were prepared at the Aurizona Prep Lab.  The sample 

(average weight 3 kg) was dried, crushed to 6.4 mm and subsequently milled to 150 mesh in a Seta 

Mill.  The sample was then homogenized 8 times in a Jones Splitter.  A 250 g split was further milled 

to 200 mesh in a Nilton da Rocha Vertical Mill and a 120 g aliquot was split and packed for shipping 

to the laboratory.  

9.4.2 RC Drill Samples 

For the initial Unamgen RC drillholes, the samples were homogenized at the drill site via cone and 

quartering.  For all subsequent RC drillholes, the whole sample was processed at the Aurizona prep 

lab.  The sample (average weight 25 kg) was dried and sieved to 1 mm.  The oversize (> 1 mm) was 

milled and the entire sample subsequently homogenized 6 times in a large Jones Splitter.  A 3 kg 

sample was then milled to 150 mesh in a Seta Mill and then homogenized eight times in a Riffle 

Splitter.  A 2.7 kg pulp was archived and the 250 g split further milled to 200 mesh in a Nilton da 

Rocha Vertical Mill and a 120 g aliquot was split and packed for shipping to the laboratory.  

9.4.3 Assaying 

Following preparation, approximately 120 g aliquots of each sample were shipped to a commercial 

laboratory.  Gencor samples were assayed by Nomos and Eldorado samples were assayed by 

Bondar Clegg Laboratories (Bondar Clegg) in Luziânia, Goias.  All historic drill samples were 

analyzed by fire assay with atomic absorption finish on a 50 g sample.  Original assay certificates are

available for all historic drill samples.  In addition, approximately 70% of all historic reject and pulp 

samples are intact and stored at the Aurizona exploration camp. 

9.4.4 Quality Assurance/Quality Control 

Gencor and Eldorado operated QA/QC programs on their drilling programs which involved the 

insertion of blanks and Standard Reference Material samples (SRM's) for gold in all sample batches.  

In addition, some samples were sent to a second laboratory for check assays. 

Standard Reference Samples 

Gencor and Eldorado developed several SRM's for gold during their drill programs.  The samples 

were prepared by Gencor and Eldorado from project material and drill core in their sample 

preparation laboratory and sent to several commercial laboratories for round robin analysis.  Average 

gold values were calculated by Nomos staff; standard deviations are not available.  Tables 9.4.4.1 

and 9.4.4.2 summarize the results of Gencor and Eldorado SRM's at Piaba and Tatajuba, 

respectively.

Blanks 

Gencor and Eldorado used an alluvial quartz sand for the blank material in all drill programs.  SRK 

has reviewed a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with assay results of the blank materials.  The lower 

detection limit ("LDL") appears to be 0.01 g/t Au and there are five samples out of 310 with assays 

over five times the DL or 0.05 g/t Au; however four of these samples are less than 0.10 g/t Au and 

SRK does not consider this significant.  At Tatajuba there were 67 blank samples with no failures.

Insertion of Internal Controls 

Internal control samples were inserted randomly within the drill core sequence by the core logging 

geologist.  The location of the control samples was noted on the sample log.  The laboratory was 

instructed to prep and analyze all samples in numerical order.  Audit checks were carried out on the 

assay laboratories by Gencor and Eldorado staff.  The historic drill database contains approximately 

5.5% of internal controls for Piaba and 7% internal controls for Tatajuba. 

Secondary Check Lab Analysis 

Gencor and Eldorado also sent samples to Bondar Clegg and Nomos for check analyses.  The 

results of the check assay program were not available. 

9.5 Luna Sample Preparation and Analysis 

9.5.1 Laboratory and Sample Submission Procedures 

Luna initially used ACME Analytical Laboratories Ltd ("ACME") as its primary lab for sample 

preparation (Maraba, Pará) and analysis (Vancouver, Canada).  During this time Luna used ALS 

Chemex in Belo Horizonte as its secondary laboratory.  Since January 2008, Luna has been using 

ALS Chemex in Belo Horizonte and Goiania as its primary preparation laboratory and ALS Chemex 

in Lima Peru and Perth Australia as its primary assay laboratory.  From September 2011 to 

December 2011 Luna also used ACME Labs in Goiania and Santiago, Chile as a primary lab due to 

backlogs at ALS Chemex.   

ACME is accredited under the general ISO 9001:2000 regulations, but does not have ISO 17025 

laboratory accreditation.  ALS Chemex in Lima has ISO 17025 accreditation and ALS Chemex 

Vancouver has IOS 9001:2008 accreditation. 

All samples are transported to the commercial transport company by truck and one Luna 

representative accompanies all sample shipments.  Instructions to both laboratories are provided via 

detailed requisition forms outlining the complete procedures for sample preparation and assay which 

include that the entire sample must be milled prior to the removal of aliquots for analysis.  A 

complete paper trail of requisition forms to the laboratory, delivery reports and work order receipts is 

maintained at the project site. 

9.5.2 Sample Preparation 

The samples are received from Luna in the laboratory's reception area in batches enclosed in sealed 

rice sacks containing the individual samples in separate plastic bags.  Minimal drying is required 

because the samples are all diamond core that have been pre-dried in sunlight during the logging 

and sampling process. 

All drill samples generated by Luna through January 2, 2008 were prepared in sequential order at 

ACME.  All drill samples generated by Luna after that were prepared in sequential order at ALS 

Chemex in Belo Horizonte and also by ACME Laboratories in Goiania.  The sample preparation 

method for drill core at ALS Chemex is outlined in Figure 9.5.2.1.  For both laboratories Luna has a 

policy of a minimum of 80% passing 10 mesh for all drill core samples and 85% passing 200 mesh 

for all drill core pulps.  After January 3, 2008, a 1 kg split is pulverized to 85% passing 200 mesh 

(ACME 2007– 0.50 kg split) to better address any coarse gold associated with high-grade quartz 

veins.

9.5.3 Assay 

For drill samples prepped by ACME, approximately 125 g aliquot of each sample was shipped to 

ACME in Vancouver, Canada and Santiago Chile via international courier for assay.  All drill samples 

assayed by ACME were analyzed in sequential order via Method Group 6 (Fire Assay on a 30 g

sample with Atomic Absorption finish).  Lower detection limit for this package is 0.01 g/t Au.  Over 

limit samples, greater than 10 g/t Au, were automatically analyzed via gravimetric gold analysis.  

For all drill samples prepped by ALS Chemex, approximately 150 g aliquot of each sample is 

shipped to ALS Chemex in Lima, Peru or Perth, Australia for assay.  In 2008, ALS Chemex assayed 

samples in Belo Horizonte.  All drill samples assayed by ALS Chemex are analyzed in sequential 

order via package Au-AA24 (Fire Assay on a 50 g sample with Atomic Absorption finish).  The lower 

detection limit for this package is 0.005 g/t Au.  Over limit samples, greater than 10 g/t Au, are 

automatically assayed via an ore grade package (Au-AA26). 

All reject and pulp samples are returned to Luna on a regular basis.  These samples are checked for 

consistency and to ensure that return QA/QC samples correspond with the originals.  They are 

sealed in new sample bags and stored for future reference. 

9.6 Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
QA/QC is conducted to ensure high quality drill data.  QA/QC consists of two parts, namely QA 

(Quality Assurance) which consists of the design or planning of sampling program and QC (Quality 

Control) defined by the active procedures used during sampling to monitor, detect and correct errors 

to guarantee that results that are used in the project assessment meet the design specifications.  

The Exploration Manager is responsible for all the activities related to QA/QC including: 

 Preparation and validation of standards and blanks or purchase of standards; 
 Selection and validation of primary and secondary laboratories; 
 Drafting of laboratory contract; 
 Preparation of logic table of failures; 
 Supervision on the insertion of control materials; 
 Supervision of core sampling and batch assembly; 
 Lab audit(s); 
 Validation of batches and uploading to the database; 
 Corrective actions when necessary; 
 Record keeping; 
 Submission of samples for check assays at secondary lab; 
 Submission of coarse crush replicates and core duplicates; 
 Submission of coarse rejects for particle size analysis; 
 Variance studies; and 
 QA/QC Report. 

Luna's QA/QC procedure is designed to implement controls on the sampling process in order that 

bias (error in accuracy) is null, variance (precision error) is minimal and sample switching is detected 

and corrected.  

The laboratory is instructed to prepare and analyze all samples in numerical order.  This is adhered 

to and is backed-up by unannounced site visits to the sample preparation laboratories by Luna 

technical personnel.  These site visits are documented in audit reports.

9.6.1 QA/QC Procedures 

Insertion of Internal Controls 

Internal control samples are inserted randomly within the drill core sequence by the core logging 

geologist.  The location of the control samples is noted on the sample log and GeoticLOG database.  

Luna utilizes a system of random insertion which makes identification of sample controls by the 

laboratory more difficult.  Internal control samples have the same numbering system as the drill core 

samples.  The control sample type is noted on the sample ticket and in the case of CRM's the 

sample label is affixed to the back of the sample ticket. 

Each sample batch contains approximately 4.0% Au CRM's, 4.0% blanks and 2.0% quarter core 

duplicates.  The geologist responsible for core logging inserts the control samples alternating 

between each type.  Blank materials are also inserted within or following interpreted mineralized 

intervals to determine if cross-contamination is occurring within the prep lab. 

Certified Reference Materials 

During the 2007 through 2012 drill programs, Luna utilized 14 Certified Reference Material samples 

(CRM's) produced by Rock Labs, New Zealand.  Each standard comes in a sealed and labeled 50 g 

package which precludes the possibility of contamination of the reference material.  

Tables 9.6.1.1 and 9.6.1.2 present the expected mean and standard deviation of the CRM's and 

summaries of the analyses of the CRM's in the Luna QA/QC program at Piaba and the near mine 

targets and Tatajuba, respectively.  A failure is defined as outside three standard deviations of the 

mean.  There is a failure rate of 4.3% in the Piaba and near mine targets data.  The observed means 

are between 98 and 101% of the expected mean with seven of the CRM's being slightly lower and 

one being slightly higher than the expected mean.  The results indicate that there may be a very 

slight low bias to the assays.  The largest failure rates were in OxJ80 and SL51, with the former 

having a slightly higher mean than the accepted value and the latter having a very slightly lower 

mean grade than the accepted value.

Blanks 

Luna utilized two types of blank material, barren granite (Jona) for use with core samples, and a 

commercial quartz sand (Jacuzzi) for use with RC and auger samples, during the 2007 to 2012 drill 

programs.  Luna analyzed 10 samples of the Jona granite and 10 samples of the Jacuzzi quartz 

sand prior to use and all samples were below detection limit.  The granite is very hard which ensures 

that the laboratory preparation equipment is thoroughly scoured by the blank.  The blank material is 

collected in bulk and transported to a sterile area within the campsite.  The samples are broken into 

small pieces.  Any vein or pegmatitic material is discarded.  The selected blank material is stored in 

sealed plastic containers with locks.  

A blank failure is a result greater than five times the detection limit.  SRK has examined the results of 

1932 Jona samples submitted with the Piaba and near mine target samples.  There were 22 failures, 

or a 1.1% failure rate.  There were three failures from ALS Chemex and 19 failures at ACME.  At 

Tatajuba there were 72 samples with no failures.  There were two failures in the 387 Jacuzzi blank 

samples at Piaba and the near mine targets, one at ALS and one at ACME, for a failure rate of 0.5%.    

Field Duplicates 

The second half of a drill core sample is assayed to determine: 

(1) The reproducibility of assays for different halves of the core; and 

(2) If there is any sampling bias. 

Luna inserted quartered core duplicates into each sample batch at a rate of approximately 2.0%.  

The core intended for duplicate sampling is split down the middle producing a quarter core duplicate 

with reduced sample size.  The quarter core does not represent a true duplicate sample because of 

the reduced sample size.  A summary of the field duplicates at Piaba is presented in Table 9.6.1.3 

and the results are shown in Table 9.6.1.4.

each batch to Luna. 

Secondary Check Lab Analysis 

For Piaba drill samples generated by Luna up to January 2, 2008, Luna sent 288 pulps to ALS 

Chemex in Belo Horizonte, Brazil (then the secondary lab), for check assays and particle size 

analysis.  Table 9.6.1.7 summarizes the samples sent for check assays and Table 9.6.1.8 presents 

the results of the check assays.  ALS Chemex also ran granulometric tests to determine if 80% 

passes 200 mesh.  Luna has determined that the results of the granulometric tests were satisfactory.

Preparation Duplicates 

Preparation duplicates are created by splitting a second cut of the crushed sample (coarse reject) in 

the same way and for the same weight as the original sample.  The objective is to determine if: 

(3) Splitting procedures are applied consistently; and 

(4) Changes are required for the crush size. 

For Piaba drill samples generated by up to January 2, 2008, Luna used two procedures to assess 

the difference in preparation duplicates:  sending the coarse rejects to the primary lab and sending 

the coarse reject to a second lab.  The analysis by the primary lab gives the closer comparison to the 

original as the preparation of the pulp and the analyses are kept constant.

Luna sent 253 coarse reject samples prepared by ACME from holes BRAZD208 to BRAZD235 to 

ALS Chemex for granulometric tests to determine if 80% passes 10 mesh and for Au analyses by 

Fire Assay with AA finish.  Coarse reject samples collected for check assay were all anomalous in 

Au.  A summary of the analytical results of the pulps prepared by ALS Chemex from coarse rejects 

prepared by ACME is presented in Table 9.6.1.11 and the percentage of assays falling within 

specific ranges is presented in Table 9.6.1.12.

Luna submitted 517 coarse reject samples prepared by ALS Chemex from holes BRAZD236 onward 

from Piaba and Tatajuba to ACME for pulp preparation and Au analysis by fire assay with AA finish.  

Luna inserted 8% of SRM's (seven different SRM's) into the sample stream of these pulp batches to 

ensure data precision.  Coarse reject samples collected for check assay ACME from coarse rejects 

prepared by ALS Chemex is presented in Table 9.6.1.13 and the percentage of assays falling within 

specific ranges is presented in Table 9.6.1.14.

The results show that 47% of the analyses of the preparation duplicates were within 20% of the 

original when ALS was the secondary lab and that 52% were within 20% when ALS was the 

secondary lab.  For the pulps prepared and analyzed by ACME 52% of the original samples were

greater in value than the duplicates and for ALS Chemex, 66% of the original samples were greater 

than the duplicates. 

Luna also returned 44 coarse rejects to ACME as blind samples and requested a new pulp and 

analysis by fire assay and AA finish.  Tables 9.6.1.15 and 9.6.1.16 are summaries of the samples 

and the analyses, respectively.

The results show that the original pulp returned higher values that the duplicate pulp in 59% of the 

cases.  This shows a somewhat high bias of the original over the duplicate and may have resulted 

from a lack of homogenization of the reject during the sample split. 

Validating Analytical Batches 

Sample batches are reviewed immediately upon reception and before the results are uploaded to the 

database.  The first step is identification of the standards, blanks and duplicates which are copied to 

appropriate tables for plotting of control charts.  Once the control charts have been updated the 

exploration manager applies the criteria of the Logic Table of Failures to judge whether any failures 

have occurred and if so, what actions must be taken including where necessary re-assay of the 

whole batch.  When approved the control charts are printed and stored in the sample batch folder. 

Screen Fire Assay Tests 

In 2008, Luna requested Analytical Solutions Ltd. ("ASL") to assess a set of 196 samples with both 

fire assay and screened metallic analyses for coarse gold.  Over 20% of the gold was concentrated 

in the coarse fraction (>150 mesh) and as the grade increased the amount of gold reporting to the 

coarse fraction increased.  The analysis of the duplicate assays on the fine fraction show 

considerable variation indicating that the gold particles are discrete and difficult to homogenize in the 

pulp.  However, there was no bias between the fire assays and the screened fire assays, i.e. half the 

screen metallic assays were higher than the fire assays and half were lower. 

In 2009, ASL reviewed an additional 116 samples with both fire assays and screened metallic 

assays from a single drillhole.  There did not appear to be a correspondence between grade and 

how much gold reported to the coarse fraction.  In one-third of the samples more than 10% and up to 

85% of the gold reported to the coarse fraction.  Duplicate assays on the fine fraction again showed 

variability, indicating that the gold grains are large and poorly distributed in the pulp.

9.7 Interpretation 
The analyses of the blanks and CRM's indicate that ACME and ALS Chemex perform at an industry 

standard level.  The check assays of the pulps and coarse rejects at both labs are lower than the 

original results with about 50% of the ALS Chemex analyses being within 25% of the original and 

37% of the ACME checks on the coarse rejects being within 25% of the original. 

Limited screened metallic fire assays indicate that there is a component of coarse gold at the Piaba 

deposit. 

It is SRK's opinion that the sample preparation, analytical procedures and security meet industry 

best practices.

10 Data Verification (Item 12) 

10.1 Procedures 
The historic data was not available in digital format, but all the paper lab certificates had been 

preserved in excellent quality.  Luna prepared the database from the historic data as a double entry, 

i.e. two people independently entered the data and then checked the resulting databases.  This 

method is used to ensure that the database has been built correctly.  The historic data represents 

approximately 25% of the sampled meters. 

Assays from Luna's drilling program is received in digital format and entered directly into the 

database, thus eliminating transcription errors. 

SRK has checked the database in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012 against the original assay certificates.  

Errors in the 2008 database were reported to Luna and the necessary corrections were made.  Since 

then, Luna has completely audited its database and no errors were found by SRK in its 2009, 2010 

and 2012 checks.   

Luna has a laboratory QA/QC program (Section 9) which meets or exceeds industry standards.  The 

necessary corrective actions are taken when the QAQC samples fall outside the accepted ranges.  

The results indicate that the laboratories used by Luna currently and in the past are performing well. 

10.2 Data Adequacy 
It is SRK's opinion that the database has been verified and is suitable for use in resource estimation.

11 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing (Item 
13) 

11.1 Testing and Procedures 
A series of metallurgical test programs were carried out on the Aurizona saprolite, laterite and fresh 

rock mineral deposit samples between 1994 and 2008 at the following laboratories: 

 Metago (1994); 
 Paulo Abib Engenharia S.A. (1995); 
 Lakefield Research Limited (1997); 
 Núcleo de Inovações Tecnológicas/NUTEC - Fundação Gorceix (2007); 
 Departamento de Engenharia de Minas da UFMG (2007); 
 Metago (2007-2008); and 
 HAD Services S/S Ltda (2008). 

The results of these test programs were the basis for the feasibility study prepared for Aurizona, and 

have been discussed in previous NI 43-101 Technical Reports, Mineração Aurizona, S.A., Piaba 

Project, SRK Consulting, May 9, 2008. 

More recent metallurgical studies, including cyanidation testwork, comminution studies and 

solid/liquid separation studies were conducted by Metcon Research (Metcon) and documented in the 

following reports: 

 Aurizona Metallurgical Study, Metcon Research, March 2009; and 
 Additional Metallurgical testwork on composite samples, Metcon Research, June 2009. 

The results of these test programs were reported in NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineracão 

Aurizona, S.A., Aurizona Project, SRK Consulting, December 31, 2011. 

11.1.1 Metcon Test Program 

Metallurgical studies were conducted by Metcon on composites of five different ore types including: 

 Piaba Transition; and 
 Piaba Fresh. 

An initial test program was conducted by Metcon to evaluate gravity concentration and cyanidation 

leach extraction at three different grinds (P80 149 μm, P80 105 μm and P80 74 μm), two different 

cyanide concentrations (0.25 g/L and 1.0 g/L) and two different slurry densities (35% and 45% 

solids). All cyanidation tests were run for 72 hours. The results of tests at three different grinds while 

maintaining the cyanide concentration at 0.25 g/L and the slurry density at 45% solids are 

summarized in Table 11.1.1.1.

 Slurry: 45% solids 
 Time: 72 hours 

 

The results of these tests indicated that, over the range tested, grind size, NaCN concentration, and 

slurry density did not have a significant impact on overall gold recovery. As a result, the following 

parameters were used as the standard for all subsequent tests: 

 Grind Size:   P80 149 μm; 
 NaCN:    250 mg/l; and 
 Slurry Density:   45% solids. 

Gravity Concentration Followed by Standard Cyanidation of Gravity Tailing 

A series of tests were conducted on each ore composite to evaluate gold recovery achievable by 

gravity concentration followed by agitated cyanidation of the gravity tailing. Gold extraction during 

cyanidation was monitored after 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. The results of these tests are 

summarized in Table 11.1.2 and indicate that 23 to 53% of the gold could be recovered into a gravity 

concentrate and that gravity concentration followed by cyanidation for 24 hours would result in about 

80% gold recovery for the saprolite ore, and 90 to 93% gold recovery from the transition and fresh 

ore composites. These tests further indicated that the saprolite ore was slower leaching and required 

72 hours leach retention time to achieve the gold recoveries obtained from the other composites 

after only 24 hours of leaching.

Gravity Concentration Followed by CIL Cyanidation of the Gravity Tailing 

A series of tests were then conducted to evaluate gravity concentration followed by CIL leaching of 

the gravity tailing. All tests were run for 72 hours and are summarized in Table 11.1.3. The combined 

gravity plus CIL cyanidation resulted in gold recoveries ranging from about 90-93%. It should be 

pointed out that by the nature of CIL testing, gold extraction as a function of retention time cannot be 

reported, and that these tests identify recoveries achievable only after 72 hours of cyanidation.

11.2 General Process Description 
The process plant after commissioning of Phase I Expansion is planned to process a mixture of 

Saprolite, Transitional and Fresh Rock ore grading an average 1.3 g/t Au at the rate of 3.6 Mt/year. 

The process plant flowsheet for processing ore includes the following units of operation:  

 Receiving; 
 Crushing; 
 Grinding; 
 Gravity separation; 
 Pre-leach thickener; 
 CIL; 
 Gold elution;  
 Carbon Acid Washing; 
 Gold electrowinning; 
 Induction fusion furnace; 
 Tailings thickening; and  
 Neutralization of the tailings pulp. 

With the commissioning of the Phase I Expansion, the operation is expected to run at a production 

rate of 10,000 tpd (dry). Phase I Expansion is composed of a series of enhancements to the 

operating plant. Some of the work included in the Phase I Expansion addresses: 

 Grinding circuit including the cyclones and the cyclone feed pumps; 
 Gravity circuit, addition of a high intensity cyanide leach reactor together with electrowinning 

cell; 

 Elution circuit including the gold room; and 
 CIL circuit including pre-leach and post leach thickening. 

The following summarizes the expansion unit operations required to extract gold:

 Size reduction of blended ores with a jaw and cone crusher to feed existing primary SAG  
mill and ore fines washing with a tripple deck, vibrating wet screen or tumbling scrubber; 

 Secondary size reduction and classification of ore receiving area fines with existing ball mills 
and cyclone clusters; 

 Existing gravity concentration with the addition of a second cyclone cluster underflow bleed 
and a new intense leaching reactor for the concentrate product; 

 New high rate pre-leach thickener and three new CIL tanks for cyanidation of the cyclone 
overflow product; 

 Loaded carbon harvest, acid washing, elution and regeneration upgrades; 
 Electrowinning of the intense leach and elution pregnant solutions and smelting of the 

concentrates sludges; and 

 New tails thickener before cyanide detoxification of the CIL tailings. 

11.2.1 General Process Description Upon Completion of Phase I Expansion  

Ore Receiving and Primary Milling 

In the ore receiving area Run of Mine (ROM) ore will be reclaimed and blended from stockpiles by 

front end loader or direct dumped onto an existing stationary grizzly with a hopper and apron feeder 

connected to a wet screen, primary secondary crushing by separate conveyor belt system. 

The apron feeder discharge will feed a triple deck, vibrating wet screen or tumbling scrubber.  

The final under size product of the screen/scrubber will report by gravity to the existing cyclone feed 

pump box via an agitated holding tank whereas the screen / scrubber oversize products will report 

via conveyor to the existing 5.2 m x 1.5 m primary mill.  

Current equipment including a stationary grizzly, hopper and apron feeder will be maintained in 

operating condition for direct feeding fine ore to the primary mill. 

Secondary Milling, Classification and Gravity Concentration 

The existing cyclone feed pump box is planned to remain in service for the expansion. A new 

cyclone cluster consisting of six (6) 510 mm diameter cyclones will complement the existing 6 unit 

cluster and each cluster will be fed by a dedicated cyclone feed pump. In order to maximize 

operational flexibility during downtime events, the option will exist to feed either cluster from either 

cyclone feed pump. In addition - each cluster will operate with a standby cyclone. 

Approximately 32% of the cyclone underflow will be split fed to two new underflow scalping screens 

with the -2 mm screen products reporting to two existing gravity concentrators (Knelson model KC-

XD30). Concentrates from the Knelsons will report to a new, intense leach reactor to recover gold 

metal values as a gold-cyanide complex while the gravity concentrator tails will return to the cyclone 

feed pump box. Based on current gravity circuit performance it's expected that the gravity circuit will 

contribute approximately 25% to overall plant gold recovery. 

The balance of the cyclone underflow will report to three (3) 2.74 m x 3.66 m ball mill and will have a 

particle size distribution P80 of approximately 600 microns and a recirculating load of 200%. 

Cyclone cluster overflow products will report independently by gravity flow to the new trash screen 

with an anticipated particle size distribution P80 of 105 micron.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Thickening, CIL and Detoxification 

Cyclone overflow products will gravity report to a new 3.2 m x 7.5 m (25 m2 effective screening area) 

horizontal, linear trash screen prior to entering a new 50 m diameter, high rate CIL feed thickener.   

Thickener overflows will report by gravity to a lined, process water containment pond prior to recycle 

and reuse within the plant. Thickener underflow product at 45% solids will be pumped by dedicated 

underflow pumps to the new and existing CIL circuits.  

Each train will have a spare pump to ensure uninterrupted flow of underflow product to both CIL 

circuits. 

The new CIL circuit will consist of three (3) 3,895 m3 live volume, agitated tanks each outfitted with a 

submerged carbon advance pump and a 750 micron interstage screen.  The tanks in this new circuit 

will also have larger, more powerful agitators and air dispersion cones. 

The existing CIL circuit is planned to remain as is with two (2) 1,430 m3 pre-leach tanks followed by 

'split', parallel flow CIL circuits with three (3) 1,430 m3 tanks in each train. All 6 existing CIL tanks are 

equipped with interstage screens and carbon advance pumps. 

The total leach circuit tankage represents 25.5 hours of plug flow residency at 10,000 dtpd plant feed 

throughput excluding pre-leach in thickener if this option is chosen. 

Lime will be added to both circuits to establish and maintain a pH of approximately 10.5 prior to 

dosing a 10% sodium cyanide solution.  

Activated carbon concentrations may vary between 10 and 15 g/L slurry within the CIL tanks. 

In the new CIL circuit pulp will flow sequentially down each tank while activated carbon will move 

counter current to the direction of the pulp flow with the aid of carbon advance pumps. 

In the existing CIL circuit, pulp will flow sequentially through the first two pre-leach tanks after which 

it will split into parallel CIL circuits each containing activated carbon. Here too activated carbon will 

move counter current to the direction of pulp flow with the aid of carbon advance pumps. 

Tailings exiting the existing parallel flow CIL circuits will gravity report to a new 50 m diameter, high 

rate CIL tailings thickener via an existing 6 m x 2 m, 0.6 mm aperture carbon safety screen and a 

new tailings pump box / pump assembly. Tailings exiting the third tank of the new CIL circuit will 

gravity report to a new, 1.8 m x 3.6 m, 0.8 mm carbon safety screen with the screen undersize also 

reporting to the new 50 m diameter, high rate CIL tailings thickener by gravity means. 

The purpose of both carbon safety screens is to recover possible fugitive carbon losses exiting the 

CIL circuit. 

CIL tailings thickener overflows will report by gravity to a lined, process water containment pond prior 

to recycle and reuse within the plant. Thickener underflow product at 55% solids will be pumped to 

an existing cyanide detoxification circuit comprised of two (2) 1,430 m3 live volume reactors each 

outfitted with a 55 kW high speed agitator, reagent storage, mixing and dosing systems for 

ammonium bisulphite, sodium bisulphite and copper sulphate and air supply. Post detoxification 

tailings slurry will report by gravity (and by pump when required) to the Tailings Management Facility. 

Carbon Desorption, Regeneration, Electrowinning and Dore Smelting 

Loaded carbon assaying approximately 1,500 g Au/t of carbon will be harvested from the first tank of 

both existing, parallel flow CIL circuits and from the feed tank of the new CIL circuit via both existing 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 71 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

and new loaded carbon recovery screens. The harvested carbon will then be pumped to either a 3 or 

6 tonne FRP acid wash vessel and washed with a dilute 15% hydrochloric acid solution to remove 

any passivating, inorganic mineral deposits on the surface of the carbon. Afterwards the acid 

washed, loaded carbon is then neutralized, rinsed and charged into a 3 or 6 tonne elution vessel. 

The expansion will require the construction of a new 6 tonne FRP acid wash vessel and a new 6 

tonne stainless steel elution vessel to complement the existing 3 tonne vessels. 

Gold desorption from the loaded activated carbon will occur by a solvent-assisted, atmospheric 

elution process. This process involves circulating an eluent solution consisting of ethanol, caustic, 

cyanide and water at 95-100 oC through the loaded carbon for a period of approximately 12 hours. 

During the elution process pregnant solution eluate will report to an existing 12 m3 barren solution 

tank that will be converted to a pregnant solution tank for the expansion. At the end of the elution 

process the barren carbon is pumped from the elution vessel, dewatered and stored in a 12 tonne 

capacity carbon regeneration kiln feed hopper prior to reactivation in an electric fired, 500 kg/h 

carbon regeneration kiln operating at 650 oC. The purpose of regeneration is to remove or burn away 

any passivating organic foulants such as oils or greases that would impair the reactivity of the carbon 

in the CIL circuits. Hot, reactivated carbon will then be quenched with fresh water in 4 tonne capacity 

conical bottomed quench tank then sized and returned to the last CIL tanks of the new and existing 

CIL circuits. Fresh activated carbon additions to both the existing and new CIL circuits will be by 

makeup to the new quench tank. 

Pregnant solution eluate from the pregnant solution tank will next be pumped to three (3) new, 8 

cathode, 0.9m3 electrowinning cells that will replace the existing electrowinning cells. These new 

cells will operate in parallel mode with two (2) cells in service and one on standby.  One cell will be 

operating in parallel. Here eluate gold-cyanide solution complexes are electrochemically precipitated 

as solid gold onto woven wool, stainless steel cathodes. Electrowinning barren solution will then be 

returned to a new, 60m3 barren solution tank for elution process recycle and reuse. 

Loaded stainless steel cathodes will be removed from service periodically in order to pressure wash 

accumulated precious metal deposit away from the wool cathode and into the cell. This process is 

known as 'sludging'. Sludge deposit accumulations within the cell will then be pumped to a new 

sludge filter press, the deposit cakes dried, cooled then mixed with an appropriate amount and type 

of flux. An existing induction furnace will be used to smelt the deposit/flux charges after which the 

Dore will be poured into 32 kg slag moulds the gold bar themselves can be a maximum of 21 kg. 

Gravity Concentrate Intense Cyanidation 

Gravity concentrate production will increase as a result of the Phase I Expansion. Because the 

existing shaking tables are of limited capacity and efficiency to accommodate this increase, a new 

intensive cyanidation circuit will be installed as part of the expansion effort. This circuit will consist of 

a 3 tonne concentrate storage hopper, a 2 tonne reactor, leach solution tank, a 5 m3 pregnant 

solution tank, a dedicated 13 cathode electro-winning cell and associated pumps and 

electromechanical apparatus.  

A 50 deg. C preheated solution consisting of fresh water, 10-20 g/L sodium cyanide, 4-10 g/L sodium 

hydroxide and 3 kg per batch proprietary 'leach aid' will be circulated through the reactor until such 

time that the concentrate is devoid of gold values. The pregnant eluate will be stored in a 5 m3 

pregnant solution tank and from here pumped to a 1.4 m3 electrowinning cell where eluate gold-

cyanide solution complexes are electrochemically precipitated as solid gold onto woven wool,

stainless steel cathodes.  Electrowinning barren solutions will be returned to the 5 m3 pregnant 

eluate tank for intense leach recycle and reuse. 

11.3 Recovery Estimate Assumptions 
The Phase I expansion is targeting an annual production rate of 3.6 dMt of ore processed per year 

and a combined plant availability and utilization of 90.3%.  

Post Phase 1, plant feed targets a blend of 54% saprolite, 9% transition and 37% fresh rock with a 

corresponding blended head grade of 1.22 g/t Au. Mine plan sequencing optimization, metallurgical 

testwork and crushing and grinding simulations are ongoing to determine future optimal blends and 

comminution requirements. Furthermore, overall plant recovery is estimated at 91% Au. Unit process 

recovery contributors include 25% by gravity concentration and 75% by CIL cyanide leaching of total 

gold produced. Metallurgical recovery estimate assumptions are based on present day plant 

metallurgical performance and past test work.  

In 2012 the plant averaged a feed grade of 1.21 g/t Au and an overall plant recovery of 87.3%. 

Gravity concentration and cyanide leach contributed 29.4 and 70.6%, respectively, to overall plant 

recovery. Figure 11.3.1, represents how during the second half of the year the tendency was to 

continue improving recoveries.  

 

Figure 11.3.1:  Monthly Recovery Trending Upwards Since September 2012 

 

11.4 Sample Representativeness 
In order to develop a metallurgical understanding of the deposits, spatially representative samples 

were collected of all rock types. The samples represented the surface oxide, the intermediate 

transitional and the deep fresh rock mineral types. 

On this basis the tested samples are considered representative of the various styles and types of 

mineralisation and the mineral deposit as a whole.

12 Mineral Resource Estimate (Item 14) 
Leah Mach, SRK Principal Resource Geologist, conducted Resource estimation studies at Aurizona 

for the Piaba, Boa Esperança, Conceição, Ferradura and Tatajuba deposits using Maptek's VulcanTM 

(v8.1.4) software.  The Resource estimation for Piaba, Boa Esperança and Conceição includes 

drilling through September 2012 and assays received through October 2012.  The Tatajuba 

Resource estimation was completed in May 2008 with drilling completed through January 2008; no 

additional drilling has been done at Tatajuba since then.  The topography at the Piaba Resource was 

current as of October 31, 2012.  Complete details of the Aurizona Resource estimation are contained 

in SRK (2013). 

The procedure for resource estimation for Piaba and the near mine targets is as follows: 

 Construction of a grade shell(s) by Luna staff geologists; 
 Data analysis of assay data, including: 

o Comparison of assay results from core, RC and auger drilling; 

o Analysis of sample recovery versus gold content; and 

o Contact analysis between weathering types. 

 Selection of capping values; 
 Compositing; 
 Variography; 
 Grade estimation:  At Piaba, low-grade or waste blocks within the Piaba grade shell were 

identified through indicator kriging.  Waste blocks and mineralized blocks were estimated 

separately with the Inverse Distance Cubed (ID3) algorithm.  At the near mine targets, the 

grade shells are narrower and do not contain significant zones of internal waste.  Gold 

grades were estimated with ID3 at all deposits 

 Block model validation; 
 Block model classification;  
 Whittle Pit Optimization to identify pit constrained resources; and 
 Resource Statement. 

12.1 Drill Hole Database 
Drilling was conducted at Aurizona first in the 1990's by Unamgen and later a subsidiary of Eldorado 

and in the 2000's by Luna.  The drilling includes diamond drill core, RC and auger drilling.  The 

drilling at Piaba is summarized in Table 8.4.1. 

The drilling at the near mine targets includes diamond drill core, RC and auger drilling and trenches 

which were added to the database as drillholes.   

12.2 Geologic Model 
Piaba is a 3.3 km long orogenic gold deposit hosted in greenstone belt rocks of the Aurizona Group 

located within the east/northeast trending ASZ.  The ASZ has been traced for several kilometers 

within Company tenements and also hosts the Tatajuba gold deposit, the principal satellite deposit at 

Aurizona, located 2.4 km west/southwest of Piaba.  The footwall to the Piaba deposit is a distinctive 

volcano sedimentary unit which underwent tilting and dips steeply to the north.  The principal deposit 

lithologies are felsic intrusives, predominantly tonalitie and quartz porphyry, and volcanic rocks 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 77 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

(dacites) intruded by minor dikes.  Gold mineralization occurs in several generations of quartz veins 

and is also disseminated in the host lithologies.  

The Aurizona area has been highly weathered with a sequence of about 60 m of Saprolite and a 

variable thickness of Transitional rock above the Fresh rock. 

The deposits were modeled by Luna as mineralized envelopes defined at a cutoff of 0.3 g/t Au.  SRK 

used the same envelopes, but made some adjustments so that the boundaries were snapped to the 

drillholes.  Luna also created surfaces for the base of the Laterite, Saprolite and Transitional zones.   

The Piaba grade shell is about 3.3 km long and extends to a vertical depth of about 730 m below 

surface.  Most of the drill intercepts are within 300 m of the surface with the exception of 5 deep 

holes which have intersected the wireframe approximately 600 m below surface.  The Boa 

Esperança grade shell is about 950 m long and extends about 250 m below surface.  The Conceição 

grade shell is about 450 m long and extends 180 m below surface.  The Ferradura grade shell is 

about 650 m long and extends 225 m below surface. 

Figure 12.2.1 is a drillhole location map of Piaba showing the mineralized envelope, Figure 12.2.2 is 

a cross-section showing the drillholes and mineralized envelope and Figure 12.2.3 is a cross-section 

showing the weathering surfaces.  Figures 12.2.4 and 12.2.5 are a drill hole location map and a

12.3 Data Analysis 

12.3.1 Drilling Type 

Piaba 

The drilling types were compared to determine if a bias exists between the core, RC and auger holes 

at Piaba.  The comparison was made for drill intervals within the grade shell as that is the most 

pertinent to the resource estimation and for laterite and saprolite because the auger holes and RC 

holes are confined to those weathering types.  Table 12.3.1.1 presents statistics for laterite and 

saprolite within the grade shell by drill type.  Box and whisker plots were also generated and used to 

assess any differences between the drilling types (Figures 12.3.1.1 and 12.3.1.2).  The statistics and 

plots indicate that the mean, median and distributions are similar for the drill types.  Minor differences 

may be due to the fact that the auger, RC and RCX drillholes are located in distinct geographic 

locations whereas the core holes are distributed throughout the Piaba deposit.  It is SRK's opinion 

that all drill types are suitable for use in the resource estimation.

12.3.2 Grade Shells 

Piaba 

Grade shells were constructed by Luna for all deposits using a cutoff of 0.3 g/t Au.  Lognormal 

probability plots are used to identify separate populations as defined as a break in slope in the 

plotted data.  Figure 12.3.2.1 shows the plot for all gold assays in the Piaba database and Figure 

12.3.2.2 shows a plot of gold less than 1 g/t to focus on the lower range to discern a break in slope.  

There is a subtle change in slope at around 0.3 g/t which would indicate a change in populations.  

SRK also plotted gold separately for laterite, saprolite, transition and fresh rock to determine if there 

were differences by weathering type.  Laterite presents a straight line, saprolite shows a subtle break 

in slope at about 0.4, transition shows a break at about 0.2 and rock shows a somewhat stronger 

break at about 0.3.

Figure 12.3.2.2:  Lognormal Probability Plot of Piaba Gold Assays less than 1 g/t 

 

SRK also examined cross-sections of the drillholes with the grade shell to see if the break at 0.3 g/t 

Au was gradational or sharp and found that for the most part that the break was fairly sharp with the 

closest samples outside the wireframe with grades of less than 0.2 g/t. 

Luna Exploration staff provided geological insight into the use of a 0.30 g/t Au cut off used in the 

construction of the grade shell.  It was indicated that the Piaba deposit demonstrates the best strike 

and dip continuity in terms of a principal mineralized zone when modeled at a 0.30 g/t Au cut off.  It 

was also indicated that the intention was to model the principal mineralized zone that focused on 

consistent mineralized intercepts in drillholes and not to model a hydrothermal system that would 

include isolated narrow intercepts distal from the main mineralized intervals. 

Near Mine Targets 

SRK also reviewed lognormal plots for Boa Esperança, Conceição and Ferradura data.  There is a 

subtle change in slope at about 0.3 g/t which would indicate a change in populations for both 

Conceição and Ferradura, but the line is quite straight for Boa Esperança where the plot of laterite 

assays presents a straight line, saprolite shows a subtle break in slope at about 0.4, transition shows 

a break at about 0.2 and rock shows a somewhat stronger break at about 0.3.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

It is SRK's opinion that, considering the statistical and geological criteria, the 0.3 g/t cutoff used for 

grade shell construction is appropriate for the Piaba mineralization. 

12.3.3 Assay Statistics 

Piaba 

There are a total of 56,115 assay intervals in the entire Piaba database.  Of these, 18 were not 

assayed and were given a value of -999 in the database.  SRK substituted 0 for these values.  

Assays below detection were given a value of one-half the detection limit by Luna staff.  The assay 

intervals were assigned a weathering code based on the surfaces supplied by Luna as described in 

Section 12.2.  Within the Piaba 0.3 g/t Au grade shell, there are 24,619 assay intervals of which 9 

had not been assayed and were given a value of 0.  Statistics are shown in Table 12.3.3.1 and a box 

and whiskers plot is shown in Figure 12.3.3.1.  The statistics show that about 45% of the samples 

within the grade shell are less than 0.3 g/t Au indicating that there are well-defined areas of internal 

waste within the grade shell.  The median (50 percentile) is 0.33 for all assays and shows little 

variation by weathering type.  The mean grade for all assays is 1.16 g/t, with little variation between 

the weathering types, except for transition (ZTC) whose mean is highly influenced by the high value 

of 1159 g/t Au.  If that value is eliminated from the statistics, the mean for ZTC is reduced to 1.19.

Conceição, 314 in Ferradura and 1,232 at Tatajuba.  Statistics are shown in Table 12.3.3.3.  The 

statistics show that about 35% of the samples within the Boa Esperança grade shell, 40% in the 

Conceição grade shell, 25% within the Ferradura grade shell and 49% within the Tatajuba grade 

shell are less than 0.3 g/t Au.  However, given the relatively low total number of samples within the 

grade shells (1,344 at Boa Esperança, 191 at Conceição, 314 at Ferradura and 1,232 at Tatajuba), 

the narrow aspect of the grade shells and the lack of well-defined areas of internal waste, SRK did 

not use an indicator to define internal waste zones.   

The median (50 percentile) is 0.45 for all assays at Boa Esperança and shows little variation by 

weathering type.  At Conceição the median is about 0.34 with ZTC and R having higher medians of 

0.54 and 0.70 respectively.  At Ferradura, the median is 0.55, with R having the lowest value of the 

weathering types at 0.48.  The median at Tatajuba is 0.33, with ZTC having the lowest median at 

0.18.  The mean grade for all assays at Boa Esperança is 0.84 g/t, with little variation between the

weathering types, except for ZTC whose mean is highly influenced by the high value of 59.5 g/t Au.  

If that value is eliminated from the statistics, the mean for ZTC is reduced to 0.71.  The average 

grade at Conceição is 0.85, with little variation by weathering type.  The average grade at Ferradura 

is 2.10 which are influenced by a two high values of 121.4 and 39.0 g/t in SAP.  When those values 

are excluded the average falls to 2.10 overall and 1.65 in SAP.  The mean grade at Tatajuba is 1.43 

which is influenced by two high grades of 236 and 124 g/t in SAP.  The mean drops to 1.28 when 

those two values are excluded from the statistics.

12.3.4 Capping  

Piaba 

The requirement for capping to reduce the influence of high grade outlier values was determined by 

reviewing basic statistics, lognormal probability plots and quantile analyses in addition to reviewing 

the individual data values in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.  The basic statistics of the assays are 

shown above in Table 12.3.3.1 and lognormal probability plots are shown in Figures 12.3.4.1 through 

12.3.4.4.

Figure 12.3.4.4:  Lognormal Probability Plot of Fresh Rock Assays within the Piaba Grade 
Shell 

 

The assay statistics show high coefficient of variation for all weathering types at 5.18 for LAT, 3.47 

for SAP, 12.29 for ZTC and 4.50 for R.  The average grades are between 3 and 4 times the median 

grades. 

The quantile analyses are shown in Table 12.3.4.1 and include average grade, contained metal and 

percentage of total contained metal by quantile intervals.  The contained metal is calculated as the 

product of the gold grade and the interval length.  The quantile analyses show the following 

percentages of contained metal in the top 1% of the data: 

 LAT: 35% of the contained metal is in the top 1% of the samples with 30% in the top 0.5%; 
 SAP:  20% of the contained metal is in the top 1% with 14% in the top 0.5%; 
 ZTC:  41% of the contained metal is in the top 1% with 35% in the top 0.5%; and 
 R:  26% of the contained metal is in the top 1% with 20% in the top 0.5%.

The same type of analysis was done for the Boa Esperança, Conceição and Ferradura to determine 

appropriate capping values.  The assay statistics for the Boa Esperança data have relatively low CV 

for all weathering types at 1.64 for LAT, 1.54 for SAP, and 1.30 for R; the exception is ZTC which 

has a CV of 4.57.  The CV for LAT at Conceição is fairly high at 2.78 and relatively low for the others 

at 1.24 for SAP, 1.30 for ZTC and 1.49 for R.  At Ferradura, the CV is higher with 1.94 for LAT, 3.99 

for SAP, 1.74 for ZTC and 2.25 for R.  The average grades are about twice the median grades at 

Boa Esperança and Conceição and 3 to 4 times at Ferradura.  SRK produced quantile analyses for 

each of the deposits, but did not separate the weathering types because of the relatively few number 

of samples.  The quantile analyses show the following percentages of contained metal in the top 1% 

of the data: 

 Boa Esperança: 12% of the contained metal is in the top 1% of the samples with 7% is in the 
top 0.5%;  

 Conceição:  20% of the contained metal is in the top 1% with 11% in the top 0.5%; and 
 Ferradura:  18% of the contained metal is in the top 1% with 14% in the top 0.5%.  

SRK selected the following capping values for the raw data based on the quantile analyses, 

lognormal probability plots and examination of the raw data: 

 Boa Esperança:  capping value of 6 g/t Au, affecting 12 samples (0.9% of total samples); 
 Conceição:  capping value of 3 g/t Au, affecting 9 samples (4.7% of total samples); and 
 Ferradura:  capping value of 10 g/t Au, affecting 10 samples (3.2% of total samples). 

Table 12.3.4.4 contains statistics of the capped assays.  The CV has been reduced to 1.34 for Boa 

Esperança, 1.18 for Conceição and 1.63 for Ferradura.

The Tatajuba estimation was completed in 2008 and followed a different approach where the 

composites rather than the assays were capped.  The capping value for the composites was 10 g/t.

12.3.5 Contact Analysis 

Piaba 

The Vulcan Contact Profile Analyzer was used to plot assays above and below the weathering 

contacts to determine if there is a grade difference at the contacts which would require separate 

compositing and grade estimation for these domains.  Figures 12.3.5.1 through 12.3.5.3 show the 

LAT/SAP, SAP/ZTC and ZTC/R contacts, respectively, within the grade shell.  Table 12.3.5.1 

presents the number of samples and the average gold grade in each contact profile analysis.  The 

average grades across the SAP/ZTC and ZTC/R contacts are quite similar.  There is a difference 

between the LAT/SAP contact and Figure 12.3.5.1 also indicates that there may be a difference in 

grades across the boundary which warrants estimation of LAT as a separate domain.

Near Mine Targets 

A similar contact analysis was done for Boa Esperança, Conceição and Ferradura.  Table 12.3.5.2 

presents the number of samples and the average gold grade in each contact profile analysis.  There 

are insufficient samples for contact profiles for SAP/ZTC and ZTC/R at Conceição and R at 

Ferradura. 

At Boa Esperança, the average grades across the LAT/SAP and SAP/ZTC contacts are quite similar.  

There is a difference in average grades across the ZTC/R contact but the profile does not show the 

existence of two separate domains.  However, there are relatively few samples in the ZTC/R contact 

analysis and that may be the reason that the contact analysis is not clear. 

At Conceição, there are too few samples in the SAP/ZTC and ZTC/R bins for a meaningful contact 

analysis.  The LAT/SAP contact profile is inclusive and the average grades across the contact are 

quite different. 

At Ferradura, there are too few samples in the ZTC/R bins to provide meaningful results.  The 

LAT/SAP contact profile seems to show two populations although the average grades across the 

contact are quite similar.  The average grades across the SAP/ZTC contact are quite different and 

the profile is inconclusive.  

Because the results of the contact profile analysis are inconclusive, SRK used the same estimation 

method as at Piaba, where LAT was estimated separately and the other three weathering types were 

used together.

12.3.6 Sample Recovery 

Piaba Core Samples 

The core recovery is excellent with recoveries ranging from 0 to 100%, with an average of 96.95%.  

There is no geographic location where the recovery appears to be lower than in other areas.  Within 

the grade shell used for resource estimation, the core recovery is 96.9% and 97.5% of the intervals

have core recovery greater than 80%; there are 73 samples with recovery less than 50%.  Figure 

12.3.6.1 shows a plot of gold grade versus core recovery where it can be seen that the intervals with 

low core recovery tend to be lower grade than the intervals with higher recovery.

Piaba RC Samples 

Recovery is also recorded for RC samples.  SRK does not have details as to how recovery was 

measured for RC drilling.  Figure 12.3.6.2 shows a plot of gold grade versus sample recovery. There 

are 39 samples inside the grade shell where recovery is less than 50%.

Figure 12.3.6.2:  Gold Grade vs RC Recovery within the Piaba Grade Shell 

 

Near Mine Targets Core Samples 

The core recovery at Boa Esperança is excellent with recoveries ranging from 20 to 100%, with an 

average of 96.6%: at Conceição the core recovery ranges from 11 to 100 with an average of 96.2 

and at Ferradura, the recovery ranges from 23 to 100 with an average of 94.4.  There is no 

geographic location where the recovery appears to be lower than in other areas.  Within the Boa 

Esperança grade shell used for resource estimation, the core recovery is 94.25% and 94.8% of the 

intervals have core recovery greater than 80%; there is 1 sample with recovery less than 50%.  

Within the Conceição grade shells used for resource estimation, the core recovery is 98.09% and 

98% of the intervals have core recovery greater than 80%; there is 1 sample with recovery less than 

50%.  Within the Ferradura grade shells used for resource estimation, the core recovery is 93.25% 

and 94.2% of the intervals have core recovery greater than 80%; there are 2 samples with recovery 

less than 50%.  SRK reviewed pots of gold versus recovery and found that intervals with low core 

recovery tend to be lower grade than the intervals with higher recovery, except for Conceição where 

there is only 1 sample with less than 80% recovery with a gold grade over 5 g/t. 

Near Mine Targets RC Samples 

Recovery was also recorded for some of the RC drill holes, although not all.  Of the 471 RC samples 

inside the Boa Esperança grade shell only 19% have recorded recovery percentages; none of the 40 

RC samples in the Conceição grade shell have recorded recovery; at Ferradura 7% of the 83 

samples within the grade shell have recorded recovery.  SRK does not have details as to how 

recovery was measured for RC drilling.  There is 1 sample inside the Boa Esperança grade shell 

where recovery is less than 50% and 1 in the Ferradura grade shell where recovery is less than

50%.  There are really too few recovery measurements to make a definitive statement about the RC 

recovery versus gold grade although it appears that there is no bias.

SRK conducted a contact profile analysis to determine whether the specific gravity estimation should 

be separated by weathering type.  The contact profiles indicate that there is a difference across the 

LAT/SAP contact and that there is a transition across the SAP/ZTC and ZTC/R contacts.  The 

profiles suggest that specific gravity in the laterite should be estimated separately and the specific 

gravity in SAP, ZTC and R could be estimated without regard to weathering type.  The estimation of 

SG is further discussed in Section 12.7.

SRK conducted a contact profile analysis to determine whether the specific gravity estimation should 

be separated by weathering type.  The contact profiles were similar to those at Piaba suggesting that 

specific gravity in the laterite should be estimated separately and the specific gravity in SAP, ZTC 

and R could be estimated without regard to weathering type. 

There were no specific gravity measurements at Tatajuba in the 2008 estimation.  The following 

average values were assigned to the block model based on the data from Piaba at that time: 

 LAT/SAP:  1.87;  
 ZTC:  2.36; and 
 R:  2.61. 

12.5 Compositing 
Piaba 

Compositing is the method used to standardize sample length for use in resource estimation.  

Histograms of assay interval lengths inside and outside the grade shell are shown in Figures 12.5.1

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

and 12.5.2, respectively.  Inside the grade shell, 85% of the samples have an average length of 1 m 

or less.  Outside the grade shell, about 44% of the samples are 1 m in length and about 38% are 2 m 

in length.  This is due to Luna's policy of sampling at wider intervals in barren hanging and footwall 

rocks which is appropriate.

Figure 12.5.2:  Histogram of Assay Interval Length Outside the Piaba Grade Shell 

 

SRK chose 2 m downhole compositing with breaks at the grade shell boundary because the vast 

majority of assay intervals are 1 or 2 m in length.  The Vulcan compositing distribute option was used 

in which the sample length is divided equally within the wireframe.  The composites were flagged for 

weathering code with the weathering surfaces.  Tables 12.5.1 and 12.5.2 contain statistics of capped 

Au composites inside and outside the grade shell, respectively.  The CV of the uncapped composites 

within the grade shell is 3.3 and the CV of the capped composites is 1.7 which is a more acceptable 

value.  The CV of capped composites outside the grade shell decreased from 3.9 in the uncapped 

composites to 2.85.

Sample recovery was composited separately using the grade shell and the resulting file was merged 

with the composite file.  The composite file was flagged with a variable "use", excluding composites 

with recovery less than 50% and composite lengths less than 0.75 m.  This variable is used in the 

grade estimation to eliminate samples with low recovery or small sample length.  Ninety-three 

composites within the grade shell have recovery less than 50% and the average grade of those 

composites is 0.95 g/t Au which is close to the average for all samples indicating that there is no bias 

in the samples with low recovery.  Outside the grade shell, there are 88 composites with an average 

grade of 0.05 g/t Au.  There are three composites inside the grade shell with composite lengths less 

than 0.75 m with an average grade of 0.59 g/t Au and 16 outside the grade shell with an average 

grade of 0.09 g/t Au.

12.6 Variogram Analysis and Modeling 

12.6.1 Piaba 

SRK conducted a variographic analysis of the composite data in Snowden's Supervisor to evaluate 

the spatial continuity of gold.  The analyses include the 0.3 g/t gold indicator and mineralized and 

waste gold composites inside the Piaba grade shell and gold composites outside the grade shell.  

The mineralized and waste designations are described in Section 12.8 Estimation Methodology. 

Prior to the variographic study, continuity maps were constructed with Snowden Supervisor to 

identify the main trends of the mineralization.  The maps indicate that the Piaba mineralization strikes 

in direction az 070° with no plunge and it dips -80º to az 340°.  The continuity is longer in the 

horizontal direction than in the down-dip direction, but this is largely because the deposit has been 

drilled for about 3.5 km along strike but about 600 m in the down-dip direction.  Review of drill cross-

sections also shows that the mineralization is continuous down-dip.  It is SRK's opinion that apparent 

anisotropy is a due to the differences in extent of drilling along strike versus down-dip. 

Indicator Variograms 

Variograms were analyzed for an indicator at 0.3 g/t Au inside the grade shell for each weathering 

type separately and as a group.  The variograms for saprolite, transition and rock are similar to each 

other, so variograms were run for a combination of the three and variograms for laterite were 

calculated separately.  A downhole variogram was calculated to determine the nugget.  A summary 

of the variogram parameters is given in Table 12.6.1.1.

Gold Variograms 

Variograms were calculated separately for gold composites in each of the weathering types.  The 

laterite composites were divided into central, west and east areas for variography studies because 

the drilling in the laterite is on a grid of 8 m by 50 m in the west, 10 m by 100 m in the east and 

roughly 50 m by 50 m in the central portions of the deposit.  The nugget is relatively low at about 

15% of the total sill. 

The sample spacing for the saprolite, transition and rock is about the same at roughly 50 m by 50 m 

and it was therefore not necessary to separate the composites into separate geographic areas based 

on drill spacing.  The variograms for each of the separate weathering types were poor, so the three 

were combined for the analysis.  The resulting variograms are reasonable, although the nugget is 

high at 50% of the total sill.  Table 12.6.1.2 summarizes the parameters of the gold variograms.

12.6.2 Near Mine Targets 

Gold Variograms 

SRK followed the same general procedure in analyzing variograms for the near mine targets as at 

Piaba except that it was not necessary to calculate indicator variograms for internal waste zones.  

The continuity maps provided representations of the directions of continuity, but the variograms were 

poor. 

12.7 Block Model 
Rotated block models were constructed separately for each of the near mine targets with the origin 

and dimensions shown in Table 12.7.1.  The Piaba, Boa Esperança, Conceição and Ferradura block 

models were sub-blocked at the grade shell boundaries and at the topographic surface.

The block models have variables for the following: 

 Separate variables for gold in internal waste blocks, mineralized blocks and at the outside 
edge of the grade shell' 

 Gold estimated by ID3 and by OK; 
 Estimation variables:  number of composites, number of drillholes, distance to the closest 

composite and average distance to composites used in the estimation; 

 Lithology, weathering (LAT, SAP, ZTC, R), and presence of graphite; 
 Specific gravity; 
 Variables designating original topography or October 31, 2012 topography; 
 Kriging variables:  block variance, kriging variance, regression slope, kriging efficiency, sum 

of negative weights and sum of weights; and 

 Classification. 

The lithology, weathering and graphite codes were assigned from the respective wireframes 

based on location of the block centroid relative to the wireframe.

The Tatajuba model was done in 2008 and was a percentage model where all blocks are the 

same size with a variable denoting the percentage of the block within the wireframe. 

12.8 Estimation Methodology 

12.8.1 Piaba  

The basic strategy for estimation was to define internal waste blocks inside the grade shell and to 

estimate those blocks separately from the mineralized grade blocks in the grade shell.   

The estimations were all accomplished with a parent block size of 10 m by 5 m by 3 m so that the 

sub-blocks were not estimated separately.  Discretization was set at 3 by 2 by 1 for the parent block 

size. 

Indicator Estimation 

In the raw assay database, 45% of the assays within the grade shell are less than 0.3 g/t Au which is 

the cutoff used to define the grade shell.  These samples represent zones of internal waste within the 

grade shell and should be treated differently than the samples which are above cutoff grade.  In 

order to do that, an indicator was used to define blocks that are considered to be internal waste, in 

this case, less than 0.3 g/t Au.  The 0.3 indicator was kriged using the parameters shown in Table 

12.8.1.1 and the variogram parameters shown in Table 12.6.1.1.  A minimum of two drillholes was 

required for the estimation.  Laterite was estimated separately from saprolite, transition and rock 

which were estimated together.  The resulting indicator value in the block model is between 0 and 1.

The indicator was reviewed section by section to determine the value that best defines the internal 

waste block.  The waste blocks were defined as having an indicator between 0 and 0.45.  The 

composite variable "ind" was flagged with the indicator value of the block in which the midpoint of the 

composite lies.

Gold Estimation 

Gold was estimated separately in the mineralized blocks (indicator > 0.45) and the waste blocks 

(indicator < 0.45).  The laterite blocks were estimated separately from the saprolite, transition and

rock blocks which were estimated together.  Grouping the saprolite, transition and rock blocks is 

supported by composite statistics which show similar mean grades and similar grade distributions 

and also by the contact analysis which does not indicate a significant break in grade across the 

contacts.  The drilling grid for these three weathering types is about the same at approximately 50 m 

by 50 m.  The laterite statistics, contact analysis and drilling grid indicate that it should be estimated 

separately from the other weathering types. 

The blocks were estimated with (OK) with the parameters shown in Table 12.8.1.2 and with the 

variogram parameters shown in Table 12.6.1.2.  An octant search was used for laterite at the 

western and eastern ends of the deposit as a means of declustering the data because drilling grid is 

different than the central portion.  In the first pass, a minimum of three octants were required to have 

a minimum of one composite per octant.  The octant search was not used in the second pass for 

laterite.

The gold grades were also estimated with the inverse distance cubed (ID3) algorithm as was done in 

past resource estimations.  It is SRK's opinion that the poor gold variograms with a high nugget to 

total sill ratio indicate that kriging may not be the best method of estimation for the Piaba deposit.  

Once the estimation was complete, the variables for gold in the internal waste blocks and the 

mineralized blocks, all within the grade shell, were combined into a single variable.  Gold was 

estimated into only one of these gold variables, so the combination did not involve addition or 

averaging, just a simple assignment of grade to a third variable.  The following script was run for gold 

estimated by OK: 

 If (au_mineralized > 0), then au = au_mineralized 

 If (au_waste > 0), then au = au_waste 

Where au_mineralized was estimated in the mineralized blocks and au_waste was estimated into the 

internal waste blocks. 

Validation of Estimation Methods 

SRK stored block variance ("BV"), kriging variance ("KV") and slope of regression ("SR") for the 

kriging runs to evaluate discretization, sample minimum and maximum and search ranges.  

Discretization was tested by changing the values and keeping the other variables constant: 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 119 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

There was no change in the BV, KV or SR with the differing discretization values, so 3 by 2 by 1 was 

chosen as it best represents about a third of the block dimension of 10 by 5 by 3. 

Other variables that were varied included, using only the second search distance, using only the 

second search distance, but increasing it to 165 by 165 m, using an octant search and increasing the 

maximum number of samples to 24.  In all cases the original search strategy yielded the best BV, KV 

and SR.  SRK then artificially lowered the nugget and obtained better SR and KV values. 

SRK reviewed lognormal distribution plots comparing the results from the kriging and ID3 estimations 

to the composite data.  Figure 12.8.1.2 shows the plot for SAP/ZTC/R and Figure 12.8.1.3 shows the 

plot for LAT.  Both plots show that the results of the ID3 estimation have a distribution closer to the 

distribution of the composite data than the results of the kriging estimation.

Both estimations show smoothing, that is, the low grades are lower than the composite low grades 

and the high grades are higher than the composite high grades.  This effect is more pronounced in 

the kriging estimation. 

SRK chose the ID3 methods over kriging because it produced the better gold distribution compared 

to composites although the average grade is about the same (Table 12.8.1.3).

Estimation External to Grade Shell 

Outside the grade shell, there are some assay intervals greater than 0.3 g/t which are for the most 

part discontinuous and cannot be combined into discrete grade shells.  SRK attempted various 

estimation strategies for defining the mineralized blocks outside the grade shell but was not able to 

define blocks that formed a continuous zone.  Therefore only the sub-blocks at the edge of, but 

outside, the grade shell were estimated into a separate variable for use in dilution during mine 

planning if desired.  This variable is not used in the resource statement.  The estimation was 

accomplished with the same parameters as in the gold estimation inside the wireframe, using only 

composites outside the wireframe.   

Specific Gravity Estimation 

The specific gravity estimation was done with ID3 with the parameters shown in Table 12.8.1.4.

The blocks were estimated separately inside and outside the grade shell and separately by 

weathering type.  As a check on the estimation, SG was also estimated without respecting the 

weathering type.  Table 12.8.1.5 compares the two estimated SG variables to the average of the 

data by weathering type.  SRK selected the estimation respecting weathering type as the better 

estimation because the average grades are closer to the averages for the data.  After the estimation, 

SRK assigned the average values to the unestimated blocks, all of which are well outside the grade 

shell.

12.8.2 Near Mine Targets  

Gold Estimation 

The grade shells at Boa Esperança, Conceição, Ferradura and Tatajuba are quite narrow compared 

to Piaba and do not contain definable zones of internal waste.  Therefore, an indicator was not used 

as it was at Piaba to define internal waste blocks.   

The estimations were all accomplished with a parent block size of 10 m by 5 m by 3 m so that the 

sub-blocks were not estimated separately.  Discretization was set at 3 by 2 by 1 for the parent block 

size.   

The laterite blocks were estimated separately from the saprolite, transition and rock blocks which 

were estimated together.  Grouping the saprolite, transition and rock blocks is supported by 

composite statistics which show similar mean grades and similar grade distributions and also by the 

contact analyses which do not indicate a significant break in grade across the contacts.  The laterite 

statistics, contact analysis and drilling grid indicate that laterite should be estimated separately from 

the other weathering types.  The sample spacing is quite variable with more auger drilling and 

trenching having taken place in the laterite and saprolite.  The sample spacing in the transition and 

rock is quite variable, ranging from 200 m sections at Conceição to roughly 50 m sections at Boa 

Esperança. 

The blocks were estimated with ID3 with the parameters shown in Table 12.8.2.1.  Ordinary kriging 

was not used because acceptable variograms were not produced.  An octant search was not used 

for declustering the data because the drill density is not higher in one area than in others.  Octant 

searches are typically used where the drillhole spacing is closer in one area than in another.

Estimation External to Grade Shell 

Similar to Piaba, there are some assay intervals outside the grade shell greater than 0.3 g/t which 

are discontinuous and cannot be combined into discrete grade shells.  SRK estimated only the sub-

blocks at the edge of, but outside, the grade shell into a separate variable for use in dilution during 

mine planning if desired.  This variable is not used in the resource statement.  The estimation was 

accomplished with the same parameters as in the gold estimation inside the wireframe, using only 

composites outside the wireframe. 

At Tatajuba, there was not a separate estimation for the percentage of the blocks outside the grade 

shell.  The portion of the blocks outside the grade shell are considered to have a gold value of zero. 

Specific Gravity 

Specific gravity was estimated as at Piaba.  The results are shown in Table 12.8.2.2.  The Tatajuba 

block model was assigned the average values from the Piaba specific gravity database at the time in 

2008.  Those values are 1.87 for SAP, 2.31 for ZTC and 2.61 for R.

12.9 Model Validation 

12.9.1 Piaba 

The block model was validated through three methods: 

 Visual comparison of the block grades and composite grades on cross-sections and 
horizontal sections; 

 Comparison of block and composite statistics; and  
 Swath plots. 

Visual Comparison 

The visual comparison of the block and composite grades was done by a review of cross-sections 

and horizontal sections in Vulcan on the computer screen.  There is a good comparison between 

composite and block grades. 

Comparison of Composite and Block Statistics 

The statistics of the mineralized blocks and the composites used in their estimation are shown in 

Table 12.9.1.1.  Statistics of the waste blocks and corresponding composites are shown in Table 

12.9.1.2.  The statistics of the mineralized blocks show good agreement with the composites, except 

for laterite where the average block grade is higher than the average composite grade.  This is 

probably due to the grid spacing where the samples are closer on section than the sections are.  The 

waste grade blocks are uniformly lower grade than the composites used in the estimation.

Swath Plots 

Swath plots were constructed in the east-west and north-south directions and by elevation for the 

mineralized and internal waste blocks.  Because the mineralization trends nearly east-west and is 

quite narrow, there are relatively few north-south data points.  Figures 12.9.1.1 through 12.9.1.3 

show the swath plots for the mineralized blocks.

Swath plots were constructed in the east-west and north-south directions and by elevation for the 

near mine targets.  The plots show a good correlation for LAT and SAP, but less agreement in ZTC 

and R because of the less dense drilling in those weathering types.  There are too few composites at 

Conceição for reliable swath plots. 

12.10  Resource Classification 

12.10.1 Piaba 

The resources were classified by drill spacing and estimation pass, KV and slope of regression 

("SR") calculated during the kriging estimation.  Kriging variance is a function of the search ranges 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 130 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

and the sample spacing.  Closer drillhole spacing results in lower KV.  The slope of regression is 

close to 1 for unbiased estimation.   

An outline was drawn around the drillholes which are on approximately 35 m spacing to classify 

blocks as Measured.  The blocks with slope of regression greater than 0.9 were plotted and viewed 

in long section.  These blocks where the slope of regression is greater than 0.9 form a consistent 

pattern from section to section and support the selection of the 35 m spacing for Measured 

classification.  Laterite blocks at the east and west ends of the deposit with closely spaced drilling 

were classified as Measured.  All other laterite blocks were classified as Indicated. 

SRK plotted the blocks that had been estimated in the third pass with a single drillhole on a long 

section with the drillholes.  A line was drawn at the base of drilling which coincides closely with the 

blocks that were estimated in the third pass with a single drillhole.  A wireframe solid was 

constructed based on the depth of drilling and the blocks inside were classified as Inferred.  SRK 

also plotted blocks where kriging variance is greater than 0.75 on the same long section.  The kriging 

variance supports the definition of Inferred resources within this solid. 

All other blocks were classified as Indicated. 

12.10.2 Near Mine Targets 

At Boa Esperança, Conceição and Ferradura, blocks were classified as Indicated if estimated in the 

first pass and the weathering type is LAT or SAP.  All other blocks were classified as Inferred.  The 

classification methodology was based on the drillhole spacing.  The block classification was 

reviewed visually on the monitor screen to ensure if the Indicated blocks formed a cohesive group 

and did not occur as isolated blocks within the Inferred blocks.  The core and RC samples make 

about 50% of the total samples inside the grade shells at the near mine targets.  SRK considers this 

number to be on the low side for classification as Indicated resources.  However, given the density of 

the samples near surface, it is SRK's opinion that the classification is suitable for the laterite and 

saprolite resources that meet the requirement of having been estimated in the first pass. 

At Tatajuba, blocks were classified as Indicated if estimated in the first pass (60 m search range and 

minimum of two drillholes) and Inferred if estimated in the second pass. 

12.11 Mineral Resource Statement 
A Whittle® pit optimization was run on the Piaba resource with the following parameters provided by 

Luna personnel: 

 Pit Slope:  45° Laterite/Saprolite/Transition, 55 ° Fresh Rock; 
 Mining:   US$1.80/t material moved; 
 Process and G&A: Laterite/Saprolite: US$14.00/t processed,  

Transition: US15.50 and   

Fresh:  US$17.00/t  

 Recovery:  Laterite/Saprolite:  92%;   
Transition/Fresh: 90%;  

 Selling cost:  US$30/oz; and 
 Gold price:  US%1,500/oz. 

The cutoff grades for each weathering type were calculated with the following equation: 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 131 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

(process cost + G&A) / ((Au Price - selling cost)*(recovery) 

The resulting cutoff grades are given below: 

 Laterite/Transition: 0.322 g/t; 
 Transition:  0.364 g/t; and 
 Rock:   0.400 g/t. 

The Mineral Resources that are contained within the pit shell are given in Table 12.11.1.

Mineral Resources outside the Piaba pit shell may be potentially mineable and are stated in Table 

12.11.2 at a cutoff grade of 1.50 g/t Au for fresh rock only.  The cutoff grade was calculated with the 

following parameters, including a 1% royalty to account for a potential royalty increase in Brazil: 

 Mining:   US$45/t material moved; 
 Process and G&A: US$19.00/t  
 Recovery:  90%; 
 Selling cost:  US$30/oz; 
 Royalty:  1%; and 
 Gold price:  US$1,500/oz. 

The cutoff grade was calculated with the following equation: 

(mining cost+process cost+G&A) / ((Au Price -selling cost)*(1-royalty)*recovery)

13 Mineral Reserve Estimate (Item 15) 
Mineral Reserves estimation studies have been compiled in conjunction with a group of qualified 

persons from the different disciplines at Aurizona's Piaba Mine. Alberto Reyes, Aurizona's Deputy 

General Manager, was the overarching Qualified Person for this area. Alberto Reyes is a Chartered 

Professional mining engineer, with the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM). The 

Reserve's estimate has been independently reviewed by Sam Shoemaker SME Registered Member, 

Principal mining engineer with Micon International Limited.  

The Mineral Reserves have been estimated with the use of CAE's NPV scheduler Optimizer, Version 

4.1 and  Deswik CAD and Scheduler V.3.2 which is a 3D mine design and mine scheduler tool. The 

tonnages reported on the open pit optimization and mine design follow the standard conversion from 

Measured and Indicated to Proven and Probable accordingly. Inferred material was not included in 

the mine design.  

Reserves have been estimated based on the new Resource model as declared by Luna's 

Exploration team and externally audited by SRK Consulting (Included in this NI 43-101 Report). The 

topography was updated using the month end survey for December 2012.  

13.1 Conversion Assumptions, Parameters and Methods 
The estimation process that converts Resources to Reserves takes into account historical 

information and compares it to the modifying parameters. This process calibrates the parameters 

and ensures they are coherent and achievable.  The parameters are introduced to the NPV 

scheduler where the software runs optimizations within a wide range of gold prices. The optimal pit 

shell is selected and further engineering criteria is incorporated in the design stage.  

The new reserves are obtained after the model has gone through a series of designing iterations 

which involve input from all the technical disciplines such as, operations, geotechnical, survey, 

geology, processing, etc. The process also looks at the legislation, costs, revenue and operational 

practicality. This latter process closes the gap between designing and scheduling and provides a 

final life of mine plan. A summary flow chart can be seen on Figure 13.1.1 below. This flow chart 

shows the process that the Resource model goes through in order to generate a Reserve 

conversion.

13.2.1 Pit Optimization 

Piaba's pit optimization has been outsourced to MCB Mining out of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, 

Brazil. The work was done in collaboration with the mining engineering team from Luna who worked 

side by side to run the optimizations and create the mine plan.  

The work was based on the new resource block model described on this report. This new model 

incorporated new geological information, the prefeasibility study by SNC Lavalin Inc. on the plant 

expansion project, historical data, geotechnical information and a better adaptation to operational 

needs. Furthermore, the previous Reserve (June 2010) was based on a gold price of US$750 per 

ounce which at the time of declaration in 2010 was considered reasonable and appropriate by SRK1. 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 144 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

The new optimization is based on a US$1350.00 per ounce pit shell. It is worth noticing that Inferred 

material was not included in the optimization and only material where there was a reasonable 

expectation of economic extraction became part of the design. 

13.2.2 NPV Scheduler Parameters 

The parameters on Table 13.2.2.2 have been compared to the actual figures in 2012.  However, it is 

believed at Aurizona that the last two months in 2012 better represent how the cash cost is trending 

in the right direction. In the case of mining costs for example, the cost per metric ton of saprolite has 

been set for the optimization at US$1.66. The yearly cost of US$1.96 used in previous declaration 

has been greatly improved as the new owner operated equipment arrived on site in mid-2012. 

Current mining cost in saprolite was US$1.55. This decrease in cost was expected to take place 

following a few months of adaptation; as the operators became more comfortable with the new 

equipment, efficiencies have improved in production and subsequently lowering the unit cost. 

Processing costs have also been calculated using mainly historical data. At the time of the 

optimization the positive financial impact on operational cost after the expansion project, have not 

been considered in the form of throughput.  It is expected however, that the augmented throughput 

will have a reduction in operational cost. Currently the production rate is 6,000 tpd (dry) and the 

objective is that the expansion will permit rates of up to 10,000 tpd (dry). The cut off grades utilized 

for the optimization are those as shown below on Table 13.2.2.1. 

Table 13.2.2.1:  Cut off Grades, Shown for the Different Types of Material 

CoG Low and High Unit 

Saprolite 0.44 ≥1.2 g/t 

Transitional 0.49 ≥1.2 g/t 

Fresh Rock 0.51 ≥1.2 g/t 

 

Recovery parameters are a combination of historical data (on available material) and the data which 

was previously defined in the previous Reserve declaration. Further studies are being conducted and 

will be available later in 2013. A summary of the parameters used for the pit optimization are shown 

on Table 13.2.2.2.

13.2.3 Pit Optimization Analysis 

A series of pit shells were generated using a range of gold prices from US$900 to US$2500. This 

sensitivity analysis was done in order to understand what happens with the pit boundaries as the 

prices of gold vary. It helps identify the optimal pit boundary taking into consideration the 

infrastructure's position i.e. waste stock pile, roads, TSF, etc.  

The pit shell is selected based on the waste to ore ratios, geometrical constraints and profitable 

ounces which in turn, generate the maximum profit for the ore body. In the case of Piaba's pit shell 

selection, the best pit shell to use was at a gold price of US$1350 per oz. Refer to Figure 13.2.3.1 

below for a section view and graphical comparison of all the pit shells.  

The US$1350 per oz pit shell is further refined running a number of incremental pit shells (nested 

pits) within this ultimate boundary. Pit 77 was selected as it has a revenue factor of 85% and a strip 

ratio of 5.3 in-situ.

13.2.4 Reserve Statement 

The new Resource model was depleted to December 31, 2012 topography and historical data from 

site has been used to calibrate mining parameters. Stock pile's contribution to the reserves has also 

used the same end of month topography as at December 31.  

Only Measured and Indicated Reserves have been included for the creation of Proven and Probable 

Reserves. Inferred and below cutoff grade material has been treated as waste.

14 Mining Methods (Item 16) 

14.1 Current or Proposed Mining Methods 
The Piaba deposit is considered a typical orogenic gold deposit extending over a strike length of 3.3 

km in the southwest-northeast direction. The orebody is formed in regional scale brittle-ductile 

structures near surface, thus lending itself to conventional open pit mining. The method of extraction 

is by benches, utilizing two 3 meter flitches for a total of 6 meter benches. The orebody is composed 

of a combination of oxides and fresh rock which eventually, will require blasting. Production remains 

for the larger part free digging in the saprolite and laterite surfaces and for the intersections of harder 

material the company uses their own blasting crews operating a Ranger 800 production drill rig.  

The area is characterized by intense rainy season. For this reason, the main Piaba pit has its 

drainage system composed of two main sumps at the bottom of each end of the pit. The rain water is 

then collected and pumped to the tailings dam to be used as make up water for the process plant.  

The systems utilize two Higra-R1 pumps each with capacity of 675m3/h. There is spare capacity on 

site with extra flight pumps of 1000m3/h. Last year's rainy season was well handled with the use of 

only one of the pumps.  

Aurizona's technical services team is responsible for delivering short and long term mine plans, 

equipment performance monitoring, conduct routinely geotechnical inspections, drainage systems 

supervision, survey and geology including grade control drilling campaigns.  

Mineração Aurizona has six 25 ton trucks and a Hyundai 500 operated by Brazilian contractors. The 

contractors are maintained to help assist with the daily production as well as with the earthworks and 

displacement of material from the pit to construction areas of the expansion project.  

Optimization, design and scheduling all indicate a potential pit and subsequent dump footprint with 

favorable economics. Figure 14.2.2.3 illustrates the overall site layout of the Piaba mine as of 

December 31, 2012. 

14.2 Relevant Information 

14.2.1 Production Schedule 

Scheduling of the mining operation within the optimal pit, Pit 77, has been developed in Deswik CAD 

together with Deswik Scheduler. The design follows the criteria of properly sequencing waste and 

ore to take advantage of the dry season. This allows for the equipment to remain on the upper levels 

during the wet season and a smaller content of ore is mined from the main Piaba pit during the rainy 

season.  

The targets for the production have been set for a plant throughput of 10,000tpd (dry) after 2013. 

This equates to 125 to 140 Koz (depending on the grade) per year after the commissioning of the 

expansion project. Tables 14.2.2.1 and 14.2.2.2 have the results from the mine sequence and the 

process plant feed schedule.

14.3 Relevant Parameters 

14.3.1 Pit Design  

The pit design was carried out by Luna's mining engineering department, the same team that 

executes the mine plan. Some of the major steps that differ from the Reserves reported in 2010 

include:  

 The geological information and the models suitability for the operations;  
 Introduction of different densities for laterite and saprolite; 
 Historical data to properly quantify the challenges when operating during the rainy season; 

and  

 The production rate parameters to meet production after Phase I Expansion. 

Details of the Phase I Expansion and how it impacts the metallurgical process can be found 

throughout in section 11 of this report. Likewise, a comprehensive description of the changes that 

improved the Resource evaluation can be found in section 12 of this report.  

14.3.2 Geotechnical  

The design was based on a projected production rate of between 125 and 140 Koz per year which 

will become possible after the commissioning of Phase I Expansion. The details of the 

implementation and improvements to the process have been discussed in Section 11.2.1 

Metallurgical Processing. The potential ounces contained in the pit shell are 2.35 Moz in comparison 

to 731 Koz (inclusive of Stock Piles) that were declared in July 2010*. The mine design takes place 

over a pit of 3.5 km in length, 500 m wide and 350 m deep. The average thickness of the orebody is 

30 m and it narrows down in depth.  

The pit design slopes shown in Table 14.3.2.1 were based on geotechnical guidelines specified in 

the "Golder Associates Brasil LTDA – Preliminary Geomechanical Studies for Determination of Final 

Slopes for the Piaba Mine– Marcus Dilascio -Feb/2008" with berm and batter angles inserted into the 

geological block model. As each pit design string is projected, the batter and berm angles from the 

block model are applied which results in the desired overall slope angles. The pit slopes are based 

on drained conditions and will require a de-watering regime to reduce wall pressure and instability. 

The phased mine sequence of mining saprolite first in a nested manner, will create access for 

dewatering to commence along the Saprolite/Transition boundary.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Berms were applied every 6 m from a reference elevation of RL 1. This represented the bench height 

controlling the start and end of ramp placement and makes allowance for two 3 m flitches within each 

6 m bench. 

14.3.3 Ramp Design criteria 

Ramp widths are based on the mining trucks used at Aurizona 40t -740B CAT- Articulated vehicles, 

contemplating the possibility of using the 777 CAT when in Fresh rock. The two-way final ramp's 

width, as per Brazilian regulation NR22.7.6 (b), has been designed at 23 m. It was determined using 

a 3 truck width to road width ratio with allowance for a 1m drain and 1.5 m bun. This gave a two-way 

ramp design width of 23 m. One-way traffic used a road width to truck width ratio of 2 with a 1 m 

drainage and 1 m bun giving a design road width of 10.5 m. 

Due to the length of the pit shell (3.5 km), a dual ramp system in each pit wall along strike was 

incorporated into the design, allowing access to either waste stock pile or plant stockpile while 

reducing the displacement of equipment.  

14.3.4 Cut-off Grade 

Other relevant parameters such as CoG, operating costs and design criteria have been discussed in 

detail in section 13 as part of the parameters used for the conversion Resource to Reserves. 

Metallurgical considerations have been discussed under Section 11.  

14.4 Production Rates, Mine Life, Unit Dimensions and Dilution 
Production rates for the Piaba pit have been set based on the plant's capacity of 10,000 tpd (dry) 

and depending on the average grade for the year gold production can average up to 140 koz per 

year over the LoM.  

Complete owner operator environment will be required to obtain this level of production while 

maintaining low operating costs. Currently, the cost per ton of Saprolite/Laterite material moved runs 

US$1.66.  

The estimations in the design include a 10% mining dilution factor as well as a 98% mining recovery 

factor. The dilution has been included as waste, although, the material bellow cut off and on the 

edges of the block model carries grade lower than 0.3 gpt. The orebody is nearly vertical and very 

distinct types of material separate the footwall, a graphitic volcano-sedimentary sequence and the 

orebody. A graphical representation of the Life of Mine showing the production profile, waste, ore 

and grade, is shown on Figure 14.2.2.2. 

14.5 Development Requirements 
Piaba mine is an operating open pit and no extra development other than the one on the schedule is 

required to sustain current production forecast.  

14.6 Mining Fleet and Requirements 
Equipment dimensioning and selection has been conducted according to the new mining production 

rates. Year on year there has been an increase in ore tones and subsequently in waste tones.  The 

intent is to reduce the waste striping at the front end, therefore, minimizing the fleet requirements 

and capital costs during the first couple of years.

The fleet which has been evaluated is the 777CAT in addition to the 6030 hydraulic CAT 

excavator/shovel. In addition a D10 bulldozer as well as supporting equipment such as the M160 

grader will be required to maintain the roads operational at all times.  

The fleet acquisition schedule is presented on Tables 14.6.1 and 14.6.2, the schedule can be 

manipulated to adapt to changes in the price of gold from the time when this document has been 

created.

15 Recovery Methods (Item 17) 
Recovery Method has been discussed in Section 11, under metallurgical process.  

15.1 Operation Results 
The following graph represents quarterly production since achieving first gold pour in Q2 2010.  

 

Figure 15.1.1 Piaba's Gold Production Expressed in Ounces on a Quarter by Quarter Basis 

 

The plant's production improvements have to do with the increase production from the mine to meet 

the plant's demands and a series of debottlenecking projects that removed some of the physical 

constraints which were inherited from the implementation. Issues that have been resolved since then 

include the hopper configuration, improvements to the entire conveyor belt system and its 

configuration, water delivery system including pumps, cyclone cluster, ball mill feed, various 

reducers, installation of a flocculent plant, improve thrash screens systems, residence time, carbon 

acid wash, etc..

15.2 Processing Methods 
Please refer to Section 11 of this report.   

15.3 Flowsheet 
The Aurizona plant utilizes conventional gold ore processing methods and is designed for a 

production rate of 1.8 dMt per year. The current operating flow sheet for processing predominantly 

laterite and saprolite ores (oxide ore types) is presented in Figure 15.3.1.  

The flow sheet includes the following unit operations:  

 Ore receiving; 
 Primary and secondary milling; 
 Thickening; 
 Gravity recovery; 
 CIL; 
 Carbon handling and acid washing; 
 Carbon elution; 
 Gold electro-winning and smelting; 
 Tailings thickening; and 
 Tailings pulp cyanide detoxification. 

The Phase I Expansion has been designed around an annual production rate of 3.65 dMt of ore 

processed per year and a plant feed blend consisting of saprolite, transition and fresh rock ore types. 

The expansion process flow sheet as shown in Figure 15.3.2 and differs from the current flow sheet 

in the following areas: 

 Ore receiving (fresh ore sizing, screening and washing); 
 Gravity recovery (gravity concentrate intense leach reactor); and 
 Carbon handling (regeneration kiln). 

Otherwise all other expansion unit processes are essentially unchanged from the current flow sheet. 

Figure 15.3.3 is an illustration of the expansion site plan.

15.5 Consumable Requirements 
There are several areas within the plant where reagents are or will be utilized: 

 CIL, thickening and cyanide detoxification; and 
 Carbon acid washing and desorption, intense cyanidation, electro-winning and doré 

smelting. 

15.5.1 CIL, Carbon Desorption, Intense Cyanidation, Electro-winning and Doré 
Smelting Reagents 

Sodium cyanide is used during the CIL cyanidation process. Sodium cyanide is supplied as solid 

briquettes in one tonne bags with a purity of 98% w/w and in bulk liquid form delivered in 27m3 bulk 

tankers grading 33% w/w. When NaCN briquettes are used they are added to a mixing tank where a 

25% w/w solution is prepared.  NaCN solution is added to the process at 25% or 33% w/w 

concentrations. Lime is required to control the solution pH of the CIL circuit. Lime solid is delivered to 

site in 1.5 tonne bags and will be prepared as a 10-15% milk-of-lime slurry on an as needed basis.  

Gold loaded carbon is subject to an acid wash with hydrochloric acid. This reagent is delivered to site 

as a 33% w/w solution and stored in a 20 m3 bulk storage tank. The concentrated hydrochloric acid 

is then pumped to a dilution/recirculation tank where it undergoes dilution to a ready-to-use working 

15% w/w solution. This 15% w/w solution is used to acid wash loaded carbon in the acid wash 

vessel. For a list of reagents used in the CIL cyanidation process refer to Table 15.5.1.1.

Acid washed carbon is then rinsed with water to remove most of the acid. Because activated carbon 

is consumed by abrasion in the CIL tanks, transfer pumps, regeneration kiln and pipes - it must be 

supplemented by fresh activated carbon additions. For a list of reagents used in the Acid Wash 

process refer to Table 15.5.1.2.

NaOH concentration w/w % 50 

 

Gold desorption from activated carbon is done in an elution column with an eluent solution consisting 

of caustic, sodium cyanide and ethanol at 95-100 oC. The purpose of the caustic is to increase the 

pH of the eluent thereby avoiding the formation of HCN gas. High pH pregnant eluates also ensure 

good electro-winning solution conductivity while minimizing anode corrosion.  Caustic is delivered to 

site in the form of a 50% w/w solution in 10 ton bulk tankers and off-loaded into a 25m3 caustic 

storage tank at site ready for use. 

Ethanol is delivered to site in the form of a 92.6% w/w solution in 10 m3 bulk tankers and off-loaded 

into a 20 m3 storage tank at site ready for use. For a list of reagents used in the Elution process refer 

to Table 15.5.1.3.

Elution Units Value 

NaCN (98% w/w) kg/t 0.010 - 0.020 

NaOH (50% w/w) kg/t 0.190 

Ethanol (92.6% w/w) kg/t 0.280 

 

The gravity concentrate from the gravity concentrators is treated in an intense cyanidation unit (ICU) 

which requires higher reagent additions compared to cyanidation in agitated reactors. Sodium 

hydroxide and sodium cyanide are also used for cyanidation and a patented reagent (Leachwell) is 

used for increasing the gold dissolution kinetics. For a lists of reagents used in the Intense 

Cyanidation process refer to Table 15.5.1.4.

Gold pregnant solutions from elution and from the intense cyanidation unit are electrodeposited after 

which gold sludge accumulations on the cathodes are removed by pressure water washing followed 

by filtering, drying and smelting. Pre-mixed fluxes are added to the dried electro-winning sludge to

adjust the chemistry of the material for the smelting process. The proper flux mix and quantity will be 

established based on the electro-winning sludge chemistry.  

CIL and Thickening Area Reagents 

The process plant will have two (2) high-rate thickeners used to recycle water and sodium cyanide 

solution to the process. To operate properly, the thickeners require flocculant to increase the settling 

velocity of slurry particles and produce a clear over flow. The existing manual flocculant preparation 

and pumping systems will be utilized to distribute 0.013% flocculant solutions to the new thickeners.  

Cyanide Detoxification Reagents 

The cyanide destruction system requires SO2, lime and copper sulphate for effective operation. SO2 

chemical is delivered to site in the form of a 40% w/w sodium bisulphite (NaHSO3) solution delivered 

in 45 m3 bulk tankers that are off-loaded into two (2) 31.2 m3 storage tanks at site ready for use. 

Copper sulphate (CuSO4) is used to catalyze the cyanide destruction reaction. The copper (II) 

sulphate is usually received as a 98% pure solid in 25 kg bags that need to be dissolved to prepare a 

5% w/w working solution prior to addition into the cyanide destruction tanks. For a lists of reagents

16 Project Infrastructure (Item 18)  

16.1 Infrastructure and Logistic Requirements 
Aurizona is located in Maranhão state, in the North-Eastern region of Brazil, where it benefits from a 

local workforce. Water is abundant and major population centers of Belem and Sao Luis are 

approximately 300 to 350 km away. 

Accessing the operation 

Access to the operation is possible by road, water and air. Currently, only road and air for the day to 

day operations are being used. In order to mitigate the impact on the local communities, the access 

road to the mine plant and warehouse areas avoids the main centers of population. Although the 

local roads are state or municipality controlled, Mineração Aurizona has worked with the authorities 

to ensure that all are maintained fit for purpose, and with particular respect to the laterite roads, are 

watered and graded regularly, sign posted adequately and speed limits respected. 

Power  

Grid power is supplied by the CEMAR, as of July 2012.  CEMAR was able to guarantee the supply of 

4.6MWatt of power which will be enhanced to 7.8MWatt for the Phase I Expansion. In addition to grid 

power, the Company has four 2.5kVA diesel generators that act as a backup power source. It is 

expected that CEMAR will have sufficient capacity for continual operations in 2014 and beyond.  

Operation Access Road 

Dedicated access roads to the mine and process plant have been constructed, fenced off and 

adequately signed to protect local people and livestock from entering the mine areas. A single 

access point to the operation is secured by double gates and spikes allowing only authorized 

personnel to the working area. After entering through the main gate, the road splits in two, one road 

for the plant and the other for the open pit. Radio communication with the supervisor is required prior 

to gaining access.  

Mine Infrastructure 

The mine is fully supported by a maintenance shop for heavy equipment, lunchroom, toilets, resting 

areas, etc. In addition to the Phase I Expansion, new offices and new permanent structures are 

being built in between the plant, tailings dam and mine.  

Plant Infrastructure 

The plant is currently receiving an uplift to accommodate for the new equipment as per Phase I 

Expansion. The current plant is made up of security access buildings, laboratory, gold room, shops, 

electrical rooms, compressor rooms, flocculent addition plant, cyanide and lime addition warehouses, 

electrical control room (CCM), substation, maintenance offices, warehouse, helipad, fuel bay, power 

generator room containing four 2.5 kVA.  

Accommodation Camp Facilities  

There is currently a camp located at the Aurizona village with an infirmary, offices, lodging facilities, 

and kitchen/dining area for serving meals mainly to the administration staff including short term 

contractors.

TSF 

Tailings infrastructures have been raised to 27 m level prior to the rainy season of 2013. The current 

elevation allows water collection of over 3 million cubic meters of water while augmenting storage 

capacity to over 9.2 Mt of tailings. Uplift to 31 elevation is planned to resume during the dry season in 

2013 and studies to conduct a further uplift to level 45 is underway. There are two other potential 

locations for extra tailings dam capacity, Sao Lorenço and Barriguda both inside MASA´s current 

mining lease. Currently, with a preliminary desktop study, it has been identified that the capacity of 

the Vene Dam at Level-Crest 45 provides a total of 22 m m3 plus Sao Lorenzo at Level-crest 30 m 

combined can provide a total capacity to store more than 60 Mt. Figure 3.5.9.1 shows the location of 

the basin South East from the plant. Figure 3.5.9.2 Sao Lorenço Basin capacity at elevation 30 m. 

Water 

The use of all water sources, surface and underground, requires approval from the Natural 

Resources Department of SEMA.  A test well drilling program is being conducted to evaluate 

potential ground water sources and a dewatering program for the pit walls. 

Process Water 

Process water comes from the tailings dam, pit drainage system and recirculation of solution 

recovered during the thickening process. The life of mine demand is estimated at 382 m3/h. 

The tailings from the CIL process reports to a thickener, which concentrates the solids and recovers 

a large part of the water as thickener overflow. An estimated 190 m³/h of thickener supernatant, with 

a residual cyanide concentration of 25 mg/L, is recycled to process, and the tailings pulp sent to the 

neutralization process before final discharge to the tailings dam. The make-up water supply for the 

grinding process of 176 m³/h comes from the supernatant of the tailings dam. 

Potable Water Supply 

Water in the camp area is drawn from an existing cased well which has a flow rate of 4 m³/h. Potable 

water also comes from the municipal water treatment plant. A monitoring plan for quality control has 

been implemented in accordance with standards established by the MS (Ministry of Health) Directive 

n°518/04. 

Industrial Water and Fire Fighting Water 

The industrial requirement will include showers, toilets, carbon washing and general cleaning 

purposes and firefighting. Industrial water comes from a small dyke on the back of Pirocaua hill and 

potentially from clean water pumped from the pit. It will have a separate line, pump and header tank 

with a capacity of 400 m3. 

Communications 

At present, there are landline telephones, internet, cell phone coverage and satellite communications 

for the mine camp and process plant. Additional systems for handheld and vehicle radios are 

installed including two repeater towers that enable full radio coverage as far as Godofredo Viana 

airport for security purposes. An upgraded IT system was installed in 2012 including, a wireless 

mesh, new VSAT and fiber optic connection between the camp and process plant. Further 

enhancements are expected as the community grows.  Local Brazilian internet providers are 

enhancing their infrastructure with broad band connections making them available in mid-2014.

17 Market Studies and Contracts (Item 19) 

17.1 Summary of Information 
Gold markets are global and mature and there are no restrictions on gold sales outside of Brazil. The 

treatment of foreign earnings from such sales is regulated by Law 11.371 of 2006, which eased 

foreign exchange controls for exporters and offshore service providers. 

Luna currently produces a high-grade doré gold product that is transported by air to the Umicore 

Refinery in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The refined gold bullion is then transported to London, England for 

sale and delivery to Sandstorm. 

Umicore charges $170/kg Au for refining and Brinks Transportation handles security and 

transportation from the mine to refinery and refinery to London, England. 

Once the gold bullion is sold on the open market through Auramet Trading LLC and delivered to 

Sandstorm, the US dollar proceeds are wired to a US bank account in the name of MASA in New 

York.  These funds are then converted to R$ upon electronic transfer to MASA's bank accounts in 

Brazil. 

17.2 Contracts and Status 
Major contracts include: 

 Brinks:  Gold security contract for doré delivery to refinery and transportation to bullion 
dealer. 

o Value: payments are made for each load and there are no obligations by the number of 

trips per month; 

 Umicore:  Refining contract for processing of gold doré; 
o Value: payments are made for each lot sent and there is no obligation or minimum 

amount per month; and 

 Sandstorm: Purchase Agreement requiring Luna to sell 17% of the Aurizona gold 
production for $400 per ounce with a 1% increase per annum, effective 2014.

18 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or 
Community Impact (Item 20) 

18.1 Factors Related to the Project 
Regulatory Framework 

The present Brazilian legislation requires two major approvals by different regulatory authorities. The 

mining license is granted by the DNPM after reviews of the PAE, while SEMA approves the LO. 

Parallel to this DNPM approval process SEMA provide approvals of the Environmental and Social 

Impact Study, environmental management control program and conceptual closure plans. The 

Environmental Impact Studies were completed in 1995 and submitted to regulatory authorities for 

review and approval. SEMA-MA issued Aurizona with an LO on July 11, 2007 to initiate the mining 

and processing of gold within the limits of Mining License DNPM No. 800.256/1978, an area 

comprising 9,981.47 hectare. The LO was renewed in 2010 and expires in 2012. 

The LO was conditional upon Aurizona filing a conceptual closure plan, an update to the impacted 

areas and revised project description. This was submitted in October 2007. In 2009 and 2010, further 

licenses for were issued for control and substances by the Army and police along with updates to 

clearing and operating licenses. Current licenses, permits or permit application are shown in Table 

18.1.1.

18.2 Environmental Study Results 
Luna plans to complete an environmental impact study for Tatajuba are underway.  No other study 

results to report. 

18.3 Environmental Issues 
The Aurizona region has a long tradition as a gold producer, almost solely from garimpeiros. An 

inspection conducted in 1989 by the Ministry of Mines and Energy and the State Secretariat for the 

Environment for Maranhão verified the uncontrolled exploitation of the area by prospectors and 

concluded the area was contaminated. During the EIA/RIMA process, levels of mercury were 

measured. In August 2009, several soil, sediments, and water mercury assays were performed on 

areas potentially impacted by mining activities by garimpeiros in the Aurizona region. Mercury was 

detected in soil and sediment samples; however, the values were lower than reference values 

required for contaminated areas intervention, the record of which is chronicled in environmental 

resolution Conama No. 420/2009. 

More recently, the company has engaged in a partnership with the new secretary of environment out 

of Godofredo Viana to denounce any artisanal mining activity to the corresponding authorities in the 

region.  

18.4 Operating and Post Closure Requirements and Plans 
This section will be discussed under Section 18.7.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

18.5 Required Permits and Status 
Luna is not aware of any extra permits other than the permits and licenses discussed in Section 

18.1. 

18.5.1 Post Performance or Reclamations Bonds 

This is not required under Brazilian legislation  

18.6 Social and Community 
Luna has been working with the communities where it operates several programs and environmental 

projects for the local development. The works were created according to the interests of the 

community, due to the work of this transparent relationship built over the years. 

The programs/projects mostly focused on improvements in infrastructure, strengthening education 

and work and citizenship awareness. 

To maintain an open channel of communication with the Mayor and community leaders, we 

conducted a monthly meeting where the works to be performed are defined. We take the opportunity 

to demystify the myths that arise in relation to the project. 

Program "Grow-up" 

The program is intended to provide the community a different perspective of life through professional 

qualification. More than 200 people have been and/or will be empowered during the year. The types 

of qualifications are defined through the existing demands in the community. 

Program "MASA Friends": 

The purpose is to promote safety, culture and morality and thus new habits that promote a change in 

behavior at home, at school and in the community in which they live. The activities are developed 

through lectures, competitions and presentations of educational films in school communities. 

Program "Human Resources Hires" 

The objective is to register in the Company's database resumes to better use and development of 

the local labor and prioritizing this hiring. Currently over 80% of the staff are locals. 

Campaigns and projects to celebrate the special dates 

We performed commemorative campaigns to socialize and raise awareness about important issues, 

as follows: 

Children's Day:  

Apart from distribution of gifts, sweets and leisure activities, we conducted lectures on oral hygiene; 

Christmas Solidarity:  

We carried out an internal competition to raise food and in turn MASA would donate the same 

amount collected. The campaign was stunning with the collection of more than 4 tons. Through this 

partnership we distributed more than 10 tons, which provided benefit for over 600 families. 

 

 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 179 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Campaign STD/AIDS:  

We work to raise awareness about the risks of inappropriate behavior and exposure to vulnerable 

situations; 

Traffic Campaign:  

Apart from addressing the risks routine to drive any vehicle, we address the non-use of helmets. For 

this reason we conducted the distribution of more than 700 helmets to employees. 

Program "Gold Women" 

The objectives are: training courses, orientation lectures, empower women living in communities 

near MASA and create ways for them to find new ways to generate income, providing increased 

household income and consequently the improvements in life quality. 

Program "Open Doors" 

MASA provides systematic visits for students from public and private and technical schools, 

universities, associations, representatives of public authorities and employees' families. 

Donations strategy 

The objective is to strengthen the Company's image in the community and Government agencies 

and contribute to the development of the region. 

Public Services 

MASA is developing several partnerships with public agencies to facilitate access of all citizens to 

their rights provided for in the Federal Constitution. 

Public Security 

The company is building the police station that will host all areas of public security of the State; with 

this the State Government will provide the staff to operate in the municipality. The amount already 

invested in public security now exceeds R$600,000. 

Water treatment station - ETA 

The treated water supply in the village Aurizona became a reality from January 2010 and MASA is 

developing constant improvements in the operation of the Water Treatment Station (ETA). The 

company transferred funds to pay the salary of the four operators working in shift, maintaining and 

operating in a 24 hours basis. Furthermore, all necessary input (chemicals), technical support, 

analysis of water quality and equipment maintenance is provided by MASA. In this program the 

Company has spent over R$700,000. 

Hospital  

The Company has a clinic for urgent care and emergency. At first the service would be only to 

employees, but due to the lack of service in the community the company offers daily attendances for 

some people in the community. Over R$500,000 has been spent on these services. 

18.7 Mine Closure 
Luna has a mine closure plan (the "Mine Closure Plan") approved by the SEMA-MA. 



NI 43-101 Technical Report – Aurizona Resource and Reserve Update, Brazil  Page 180 
 
 

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

The Mine Closure Plan will follow a strategy in which the planning of how to proceed on closure will 

be done simultaneously to the project development and operation of the undertaking: 

 The layout of the project is being planned in a way that a minimal possible interference 
happens on the local ecosystem, being that the areas intended for the facilities, most of 

them are not already with the characteristics because of the garimpeiros' activities in the 

past; 

 The mining development method with geotechnical monitoring, always aiming to ensure 
slope stability in its evolution; 

 The process ore beneficiation foresees to minimize the environmental impacts, and the 
effluents being treated and re-circulated back to the process in a closed circuit beyond 

restraint atmospheric emissions; 

 The gradual recovery of the area impacted by the waste dump, through reforestation of the 
slopes being held simultaneously with its formation, and rock and/or bags of soil/cement, 

combining production and environment; and 

 Control the level of involvement with the local community in order not create dependence, 
mainly economic, in relation to mining activity but social projects aiming to create self-

sustaining community. 

The Mine Closure Plan is expected to begin throughout various stages of the operation, to reduce 

the build up costs at the end of life of mine and maintain environmental stability, which includes 

physical, chemical, biological and anthropogenic stabilities. 

 Physical stability: the area must have slopes, low risk of mass movement and no erosion; 
 Chemical stability: no chemical reactions may occur which may affect environmental quality, 

or release of substances which can damage the environment without prior treatment; 

 Biological stability: restore the vegetation and fauna, in order to no longer need human 
intervention to maintain them, making them self-sustaining; and 

 Stability of the human environment: after closure of mining activity, the region's economy 
and society should be structured so that there is no significant drop in the life quality of the 

place. 

The Mine Closure Plan must adhere to regulations, NRM 20 and NRM-21 (and particularly clause 

21.3) of the DNPM as provided for in the Normas Reguladoras da Mineração, as well as per SRK 

Consulting ("EUA"), Inc., NI 43-101 Technical Report - Aurizona Project, page 117, dated of Jan 23, 

2012 which includes program for the permanent closure of the well, landfills, the process plant, 

tailings dam and supporting facilities as detailed below: 

 Once the mining ceases, a pit lake will be formed, and the slopes will be revegetated as 
available; 

 The waste rock dumps will be concurrently reclaimed during mining at a 2H:1V (horizontal: 
vertical) slope and revegetated. Surface water and sediment control will take place as areas 

are reclaimed. During closure, any remaining exposed fresh rock will be covered and any 

unreclaimed areas contoured and revegetated; 

 Site structures will be removed and the remaining concrete structures and foundations from 
the process facilities will be buried in place, covered with soil and revegetated; and 

 The tailings dam closure will consist of lowering the spillway elevation and regrading the 
tailings surface so the top of the tailings dam will be completely drained. The top of the

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

tailings will be covered by soil and revegetated. Monitoring of the surface and ground water 

at the tailings dam was assumed to continue for four years after the final closure. 

SRK revised the Aurizona costs to reflect the following uncertainties: 

 The mine closure costs are still estimated, because who will define the implementation of the 
actions proposed in the plan and maintenance time will SEMA. 

The closure plan must be reviewed and revised periodically as appropriate to changing conditions. 

Therefore an annual increase in forecast volumes is realized and updated to the current case of 

closure, as shown in Table 18.7.1.1. 

Adequate financial provision should be made during the life of the mine to ensure effective closure 

without generating social or environmental liabilities.

Recovery 

Aurizona prepared a mine rehabilitation plan (Plano de Recuperação de Área Degradada ("PRAD")) 

which was submitted to SEMA in October 2007. The plan strategy is to conduct continuous 

rehabilitation as soon as disturbed areas are released and finally closed its use.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

A forest inventory was conducted before the start of interventions in native vegetation in areas 

belonging to Aurizona. Thus it was possible to make the recognition of the predominant species in 

the region. PRAD is exactly the replacement of these species within the impacted areas. 

So far the Company has minimal revegetated areas in view of the early stages of the mining 

operation. 

Remediation 

Previously it was documented that mercury contamination is a potential liability to the owners. The 

owner is conducting further studies and providing evidence to mitigate against any such liabilities. 

A study was conducted by mercury passive, with conclusions that showed alterations in quality of 

soil above those recommended by environmental agencies. As the background showed no 

detectable levels of mercury, it was concluded that this contamination was of anthropogenic origin, 

arising from the use of mercury in old mines in the area. 

The current operation does not provide future remediation, given that the anticipated environmental 

impacts in environmental studies are mitigated over the life of the mine.

19 Capital and Operating Costs (Item 21) 

19.1 Capital Cost Estimates 
As at the date of this Report, the Aurizona Phase I Expansion was in process.  The implementations 

which will be conducted in parallel with minimal disruptions to the operations will require changes to 

the infrastructure. New offices will be built in the area between the plant and the mine. There will be 

ongoing uplifts of the tailings dam, a number of components to the plant highlighted in Sections 11 

and 15. It is expected that new equipment will be required to sustain the new production rate, new 

land purchases to increase our legal reserves, new technology to better optimize the plant and 

equipment movements, security enhancements and investments for the community. The total 

estimate capital cost excluding sunk and Phase I Expansion costs that is required for the LoM is 

approximately US$223 million inclusive of the expected sustainable capital expenditures. The 

expenditure is spread out over a 15 year life of mine and in the case of the closure plan it continues 

for four years after production is completed.

Capital Cost 
US$ millions 

Initial capital  and improvements 114.2 

Phase I Expansion 49.7 

Sustaining Capital  223.0 

Total LoM Capital  386.9 

 

The total capital cost for the operation has increased from US$83 million as reported in the NI 43-

101 in July 2010 to a total of US$386.9 million. This is due to the increase in Reserves and 

production rates. In order to mine and process at 10,000 tpd it is required to inject some capital to 

the plant as discussed in Sections 11 and 15, and to the mining equipment as presented in Tables 

14.6.1 and 14.6.2.

Sub-category  US$ Million 

General 13.0 

Mining  112.0 

Process Plant 53.0 

Construction of dams 45.0 

Total 223.0 

 

Some of the capital allocated to general and administrative ("G&A") contains a portion of the closure 

plan, construction of a new employee accommodations complex, moving of offices near the process 

plant. The latter two projects will have a positive impact to the efficiencies. The accommodations 

complex will help retain key personnel and attract new talent. In addition, mobilizing the offices to the 

field reduces transportation time and a more immediate turnaround time in between planning and 

execution.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

Mining costs include additional fleet, rebuilds, critical parts, geotechnical drilling, hydrogeological 

drilling and a portion of the closure plan.  

Process plant includes the critical spares, relining, automation, and a number of major pumps which 

are critical to the process.  

The cost allocated to tailing dam construction also includes the uplift at the current tailings dam and 

the construction at Sao Lorenzo up to level 35 m. According to preliminary studies, this would be 

sufficient to ensure capacity and water storage for the 56 million tonnes of ore to be processed.  

19.2 Operating Cost Estimates 
Operating costs for the company continued improving quarter on quarter due to the increase in 

production. Mining and processing efficiencies are constantly being challenged providing a positive 

impact to the costs. The Company believes that the full financial benefit of the implementation of 

Phase 1 Expansion has not yet been captured on the 'per unit cost'. It is expected that the 

augmented production rate and the improvement of recoveries at the plant will lower the unit cost. 

The studies for these areas are a work in progress and are expected to be finalized by the end of 

2013.  Operating costs for the LoM are summarized on Table 19.2.1.

19.2.1 Basis for Operating Cost Estimates 

Mining Costs 

Mining operating costs have been broken down into their corresponding sections to understand the 

makeup of the costs. The maintenance and operation costs include grade control drilling, rock 

mechanics and survey and planning as part of the technical services unit. A summary is shown on

The table representing the total mining costs is only the average unit costs. The actual calculations 

as expressed  in the parameters used for reserves estimation Table 13.2.2.2 which accounts for the 

different rock type and increase in haulage distance as the operation gets deeper into the pit.  

Processing Costs 

The LoM operating costs for the processing plant were estimated at $12.56/t-ore processed being 

comprised of salaried and hourly labor, wear materials/grinding steel, reagents, power, fuels, 

maintenance repair parts and supplies. Table 19.2.1.2 summarizes the LoM estimated operating 

costs for the processing plant. 

The cost in fuel consumption has decreased since CEMAR improved the electrical substation and 

distribution network that delivers power to site in July 2012. However, the cost of electricity has 

increased.  

The largest process cost is in reagents and more specifically cyanide, lime and neutralization 

reagents. The consumption tables can be reviewed in section 15.5

G&A Costs 

The LoM operating costs for G&A are estimated at $19 2 million, or $3.43/t-ore for Piaba on-site 

costs. It is expected that the cost of G&A will remain constant at approximately $12 million per year. 

The G&A operating costs include all required functions for labor and expenses, including: 

 General administration; 
 Security; 
 Environmental; 
 Infirmary and health services; 
 Human resources; 
 Financial/accounting; 
 Information technology;

20 Economic Analysis (Item 22) 

20.1 Methodology Used 
The results of the economic analysis represent forward-looking information that is subject to a 

number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to 

differ from those presented here. 

 Forward-looking statements in this report include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to 

the future price of gold and silver, the estimation of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, the 

realization of Mineral Reserve estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs 

of production, capital expenditures, costs and timing of the development of new deposits, success of 

exploration activities, permitting time lines, currency exchange rate fluctuations, requirements for 

additional capital, government regulation of mining operations, environmental risks, unanticipated 

reclamation expenses, title disputes or claims and limitations on insurance coverage. Additional risk 

can come from actual results of current exploration activities; actual results of current reclamation 

activities; conclusions of economic evaluations; changes in Project parameters as plans continue to 

be refined, possible variations in ore reserves, grade or recovery rates; failure of plant, equipment or 

processes to operate as anticipated; accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining 

industry; and delays in obtaining governmental approvals. 

20.2 Basis of Financial Analysis 
To support declaration of Mineral Reserves for the Piaba deposit, Luna prepared an economic 

analysis to confirm that the economics based on the Mineral Reserves could repay life-of-mine 

operating and capital costs. All Inferred Mineral Resources were considered as waste in the 

evaluation. 

Operating costs were developed by Luna employees, based on a combination of actual 2012 costs, 

and 2013 budget figures and trends, while incorporating the expected results from the Phase I 

Expansion. Capital costs were estimated based on operating experience, 2013 budget figures, 

vendor quotes and expected capital outflow related to the Phase I Expansion operations. 

Aurizona was evaluated using a gold price of $1,350/oz, 100% equity-financed basis using a 5% 

discount rate, and all costs prior to 31 December 2012 were treated as sunk costs.  In addition, the 

Sandstorm Agreement and the SUDENE tax benefit has been reflected in the economic analysis.  

Results of this assessment indicated positive economics at Aurizona until the end of mine life, and 

supported Mineral Reserve declaration. 

Luna prepared a check of the financial outcome by evaluating Aurizona using a range of gold prices 

between $900 and $2,500 per ounce for pit optimization. This check also supported Mineral Reserve 

declaration as the results showed positive economics until the end of mine life. 

20.3 Comments on Economic Analysis 
The QP has reviewed the financial analysis and confirms that Aurizona has positive economics until 

the end of mine life, which supports Mineral Reserve declaration. The QP notes that there is some 

upside potential for Aurizona to convert some of the remaining Mineral Resources in the Piaba, Boa 

Esperanca, Ferradura and Conceicao deposits to Reserves upon completion of further studies.

23 Interpretation and Conclusions (Item 25) 

23.1 Mineral Resource Estimate 
Mineral Resource estimate was conducted by SRK using mineralized envelopes to constrain grade 

estimation.  The drillholes were composited at 2 m intervals appropriate capping values were used to 

reduce the influence of outlier data.  The grade estimation at Piaba was preceded by an indicator 

kriging run to define mineralized and waste blocks within the envelope.  Gold grades were estimated 

by ID3 using composites within the mineralized blocks to estimate those blocks and using 

composites within the waste blocks to estimate those blocks.  At the near mine targets, the indicator 

step was not used.  The methodology is an accepted industry practice.  Resources were classified 

as Measured, Indicated, or Inferred according to CIM guidelines.  Pit optimization shells were used to 

constrain open pit resources.  Material outside the Piaba pit optimization shell was stated at a higher 

cutoff to reflect potential underground mining costs. 

23.2 Mineral Reserve Estimate 
Mineral Reserves have been generated with parameters based on historical data. As demonstrated 

throughout this technical report, there have been quarter on quarter improvements from 2011 to Q1-

2013 and further opportunities for improvement are being assessed. The work for the design and 

optimization has been independently reviewed by Sam Shoemaker, Principal mining engineer for 

Micon International.  

The ultimate size of the pit was selected to be at US$1350 per ounce. Scenarios were conducted to 

help provide a full range of pit boundaries and their impact of variances in gold prices. The ultimate 

pit was then optimized to provide the highest NPV. This was done analyzing the nested pits as they 

incrementally increase towards the pit limit. There are a few assumptions to note that require further 

evaluation and potential for optimization: 

 Dilution has been assigned as 10% at 0 gpt. All material that was less than 0.3 gpt, including 
that at the boundary, is automatically taken into the calculation as waste; 

 The assumptions on the operating costs for the Process Plant do not include the full benefits 
of the implementation of Phase1; and 

 Historical figures were included in the calculation of Process Plant unit costs. These figures 
have also been impacted due to the worst draught in the North Easter region of Maranhão. 

The plant was forced to operate at lower rates to conserve water, therefore, negatively 

impacting the trend.  

The drought and resultant process make-up water shortage experienced towards the end of 2012 

and into Q1 2013 has been mitigated by raising the current Dam elevation to Level 27.It has a 

storage capacity that can accommodate over 3million cubic meters of water which is sufficient for 2 

years of production. There is a dedicated team of engineers, consultants and supervisors to 

complete the next uplift to elevation 31 m during the dry season in the last half of 2013.  Future long 

term tailings dam volumes are being designed with water storage for process water make-up and 

recycling requirements included.

LEM/MLM 176300.100_NI 43-101_Resource Report_Piaba_024_LAE April 29, 2013 

23.3 Metallurgy and Processing 
The completion and implementation of the Phase I Expansion will increase throughput to10,000 tpd 

after commissioning of the: 

 New grinding crushing and circuit including the cyclones and the cyclone feed pumps; 
 Improvements to the Gravity circuit, by adding a high intensity cyanide leach reactor together 

with electrowinning cell; 

 The installation of a carbon regenerating kiln to improve carbon efficiencies; 
 Improvements to the elution circuit and the addition of modern electrowinning cells; and 
 The addition of CIL tanks to the circuit including pre-leach and post leach thickening. 

The inclusion of the high intensity leach reactor, CIL tanks and the electrowinning cells translates 

into higher recovery efficiencies.  

The work is currently being conducted on site, earthworks, preparation and conditioning of the areas 

around the plant, erection of the steel work that will see the installation of the carbon regeneration 

kiln and installation of the high intensity leach reactor, offices, reconditioning of the electrical work, 

etc.   

23.4 Projected Economic Outcomes 
The operational LoM average Cash Cost is US$843 per ounce of gold produced. The cash cost 

achieved in the fourth quarter of 2012 was approximately US$650 dollars per ounce which was the 

basis for identifying opportunities to reduce cash costs going forward.  

Processing and mining costs were derived using historic 2012 year end results where Aurizona 

produced 74,269 ounces of gold for the year. Future efficiencies and productivity gains are likely to 

translate into reduced operating costs once the Phase I Expansion and ongoing crushing and 

metallurgical studies are completed.     

The net present value calculated at Aurizona is measured by annual and life of mine cash flow 

generated (revenue less operating costs less sustaining capital expenditure less royalties and 

income taxes) incorporating the Mineral Reserve, annual mining and operating assumptions 

including the completion of the Phase I Expansion processing plant to handle 10,000 tonnes per day 

by the end of 2013. The LoM average all in cash costs (mining, processing, transport, insurance, 

refining, general administration, royalty, sustaining capital expenditure, income and social taxes) are 

expected to range between US$950 and US$1,050 per ounce of gold produced. 

23.5 Foreseeable Impacts of Risks 
Lower gold price can have a negative impact to profits and the operation as a whole. The operation 

possesses the flexibility to reduce production rates and minimize capital costs. Different scenarios 

have been elaborated in case the prices fall below US$1,300 per ounce.  

There are some risks if the Phase I Expansion is not delivered within budget, time and costs.  The 

project team and controls are in place to minimize risks to HSEC, budget, schedule, quality, etc.  

Water requirements to sustain operations during the dry season can potentially reduce production 

rates if the construction of the dam is not kept on schedule and/or if rains don't sufficiently recharge 

storage areas. There is a dedicated team put in place to see the dam's construction is prioritized and

on schedule. The consultants from GHT have also personnel on site to oversee the construction is 

carried out with the highest quality possible.

24 Recommendations (Item 26) 

24.1 Recommended Work Programs and Costs 
Density and SG Bulk Samples 

The relationship of density and specific gravity should be reconciled from drill core through bulk 

survey estimates for ore and waste. Both In-situ and loose density relationships for each rock type 

should be quantified and accurately used for reconciliation and survey reporting (US$10,000). 

MCF Calculation 

Reconciliation is currently at early an infant stages and it is constantly being refined. The installation 

of scales on the truck's suspension should be considered to ensure that the mine and the plant can 

compare the material being fed to the plant. Currently there is one scale on the belt and survey 

measurements are being utilized based on block model densities.  A weigh bridge has been 

purchased and should be installed to assist with reconciliations (US$200,000). 

Geotechnical Drilling 

VOGBR is developing a drilling campaign to collect geotechnical information for detailed pit and 

waste stockpile designs. It is recommended that the campaign be implemented in 2013 to ensure 

that a geotechnical 3D model is available to the operation. The cost for the program is US$500,000. 

Hydro-geological Study 

The mine has started shallow assessments and two deep well pump tests.  Further evaluation of 

ground water flows, surface run off, pit dewatering, and long term drainage plan is required for 

detailed designs.  This includes further follow-up assessments to preliminary investigations of acid 

rock drainage and metals leaching (US$300,000). 

Future expansion Potential 

The Phase II prefeasibility study to assess viability to expand to 200-300 koz/yr is underway and will 

be completed by the end of 2013.  This includes a metallurgical test program and crushing and 

grinding trade-off studies comparing requirements for Phase 1 and Phase II blend optimizations 

(US$2,500,000).

26 Glossary 

26.1 Mineral Resources 
The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM Standards 

on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (November 27, 2010).  

Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the Reserves 

have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated Resources as 

defined below.   

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic 

material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has 

reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological 

characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 

specific geological evidence and knowledge.   

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 

quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 

assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited 

information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 

trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 

sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine 

planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed 

and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 

locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for 

geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated 

with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, 

to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate 

is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 

appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that 

are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 

26.2 Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource 

demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 

information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that 

demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral Reserve 

includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.   

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 

circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility 

Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical,

economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 

extraction can be justified.   

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 

demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 

information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 

demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.
