EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

A scoping study for open pit development upon the oxide, transitional and primary resources 
at the Uzboy gold project, Akmola oblast, Kazakhstan was undertaken by independent 
Geological Consultants A C A Howe International Limited. 
 
This report outlines the results of pit optimisation and analysis undertaken in August and 
September 2008, including preliminary economic assessment, selected preliminary pit design 
and mineable tonnage estimation based upon recently updated resource block models 
completed in June 2008 with an effective date December 31st, 2007.  The Scoping Study, 
originally dated February 27th 2009 for internal use by Alhambra, is now being re-issued on 
December 10th 2009. This re-issued scoping study has no material differences from the 
February 27th 2009 Report.  It has clarified ACA Howe's view of the legal status of 
Alhambra's Kazakhstan mining rights.  The re-issued scoping study also contains a letter of 
no material change written by ACA Howe and dated December 10th 2009.  This letter is 
contained in full in Appendix 1 of this report. 
 
The gold deposit resource estimations at Uzboy comprised of: 
 

• The West Zone Uzboy Deposit 
• The East Zone Uzboy Deposit 

 
The gold mineralisation in the Uzboy project developed mainly during the Hercynian 
tectonic-magmatic cycle.  Each deposit represents a steeply dipping structurally controlled 
(shear hosted) hydrothermal (mesothermal) gold deposit. 
 
Mineralisation at West Uzboy is sub-vertical steeply dipping to the north west and occurs 
within a faulted hydrothermal chlorite-sericite altered andesitic package bounded by 
hangingwall and footwall sediments.  Anomalous gold mineralisation at >0.2g/t Au level is 
currently outlined over an approximate strike length of 800m close to surface and width of 
approximately 350m.  At depth mineralisation is interpreted to extend a strike length of 
approximately 900m, plunging toward the south west 100m beyond the near surface 
mineralisation.  Currently within the central zone at West Uzboy >0.2g/t Au mineralisation 
reaches a depth of approximately 250 metres below surface (with one hole intercepting 
mineralisation down to 430 metres below surface in the core zone), and extends to 
approximately 500 metres below surface in the south west extension. 
 
At East Uzboy gold mineralisation occurs within southeast dipping quartz-pyrite-carbonate-
sericite-chlorite altered andesite package, bounded by sediments.  Anomalous gold 
mineralisation at a >0.2g/t Au boundary in the Uzboy East zone is currently interpreted to 
extend over a strike length of approximately 1km, and over a surface width of approximately 
300m. 
 
At Uzboy East Zone >0.2g/t gold intercepts form a series of steep southeast dipping laterally 
extensive lodes or lenses typical of this style of structurally controlled mineralisation.  Current 
drilling defines up to five parallel laterally extensive sulphide lodes within each zone.  
Mineralisation within the sulphide zone is interpreted down to between 250-350 metres below 
surface, based upon current drilling extents. 
 
At both zones, in the upper, oxide part of the profile discreet well defined lenses seen in the 
sulphide zone have undergone gold remobilisation resulting in the formation of broader 
>0.2g/t Au gold zones near surface. 
 
Recent petrographic and mineralogical studies on the deposit show the gold occurring 
predominantly as free gold within the primary zone (Le Boutillier, pers.comm.). 



 

 ii

The Uzboy deposit is currently producing gold by heap leach processing method, from the 
oxide mineralisation.  Mining commenced in 2002 and according to schedules provided to 
Howe, total production figures for the operation up to 31 December 2007, at a 70% recovery 
rate are 75.1koz Au stacked for 49.8koz Au leached for 48.5koz Au stripped.  
 
Micromine Consulting was commissioned by ACA Howe International Limited to run the Pit 
Optimisation and Analysis study upon the oxide transitional and primary resources using the 
updated resource model for the Uzboy Gold Deposit during the period August 2008. 
Micromine Consulting subsequently undertook selected pit design and mineable tonnage 
estimation as part of the scoping study during the period September to October 2008. 
 
Pit optimisation upon oxide, transitional and primary resource types was carried out using 16 
different input block model, operating and mining data input scenarios based on variable 
parameter inputs. 
 
Variable parameters included the use of Measured and Indicated resource categories only or 
Measured, Indicated and Inferred resource categories as inputs, use of 1.8Mtpa or 3.6Mtpa 
production rates for the primary (transitional) processing plant and two associated capital cost 
inputs of US$60 million and US$80 million respectively.  Analysis was performed using two 
gold cut off grades for Au material processing (0.0g/t Au and 0.4g/t Au) and the use of two 
inter-ramp slope angles for the mining the primary zone (45° and 60°). 
 
A gold price input of US$850/oz was used for all optimisation scenarios. 
 
Variable parameters for each mining scenario are presented in detail as Table 30 and Figure 
14 of the report. 
 
The optimisation of the Uzboy project was carried out using the Mining module of the 
MICROMINE version 11 software packages, using the Lerch-Grossman algorithm.  
 
The main objective of the pit optimisation study was to define economically mineable tonnes, 
based on the variable mining parameters and economic constraints provided by Alhambra and 
audited by ACA Howe, in order to generate a set of wireframes for the optimal pits, for use in 
selected pit design and improved mineable tonnage estimation. 
 
The Cash Flow method of optimisation was used where the value of each resource block 
(Revenue - processing cost - mining cost) is compared to the value of waste (i.e. the waste 
mining cost) for all processing methods. If the production cash flow is greater than the waste 
cash flow, then the material elements are processed as production. Otherwise, the material 
elements are processed as waste. 
 
Optimal pit shell analysis which analyses the mineable tonnes and potential financial benefits 
(financial flow) pit shell by pit shell was done to determine the optimal discounted pit shell.  
 
The optimal pit shells generated using the supplied economic and technical parameters then 
the analysis of nested pits was completed using the base gold price and discounted cash flow.  
Maximum NPV values were used to select the optimal discounted pits for each of the 16 
scenarios for each deposit zone (Nesterov, 2008). 
 
A total of 16 optimal pits for Uzboy were selected as a result of the optimisation study, one 
for each operating scenario.  A summary of major mining (primary economic) values for each 
optimal pit is presented in the tables below.  
 



 

 iii

For the purposes of an NI 43-101 preliminary assessment under which the use of inferred 
resources is permissible, the following scenarios have been chosen as worthy of a more 
detailed analysis.  They all use the results of the block model with a 0.4 g/t gold cut off. 
 

• Scenario 1.2.1, which is based on an engineered pit derived from an optimised pit 
using the measured and indicated resources estimated by ACA Howe at a 0.4 gram 
per tonne (g/t) gold cut off.  It has pit slopes of 45° in the upper weathered zones and 
45° in the lower primary zones (45/45). There are minor differences in the contained 
gold between the optimised and the engineered pit. This is due to the input of 
engineering factors such as ramps and burns into the optimal pit shell and is discussed 
in more detail within the report.  

• Scenario 2.2.1 which is based on an optimised pit without engineering factors and 
using the measured, indicated and inferred resources.  The optimised pit has slopes of 
45° and 45° as in Scenario 1.2.1.  

• Scenario 2.2.2 which is based on an optimised pit without engineering factors and 
using measured, indicated and inferred resources estimated by ACA Howe at a 0.4 g/t 
gold cut off.  The optimised pit has pit slopes of 45° in the upper weathered zone and 
60° in the lower primary zones 

 
These scenarios are summarised as follows:

While acknowledging that 2.2.1 contains inferred resources and therefore any financial 
assessment can only be preliminary in nature, and that 2.2.2 incorporates pit slopes that are 
not currently verified by geotechnical testwork, Alhambra have requested that a Preliminary 
Assessment of these scenarios be undertaken in the near future.  It should also be understood 
that the numbers in the table above are initial and may vary when a more detailed preliminary 
assessment is undertaken.

The results of optimal pit analysis show that contained gold in mineable tonnages and 
recovered metal are lower in optimal pit shells for scenarios using the 0.4g/t gold cut off but 
generate a greater NPV. 
 
From the suite of optimal pits with 0.4g/t Au cut off, two from scenarios 1.x.x  using 
Measured and Indicated resources only were selected for preliminary pit design and improved 
scoping study mineable  tonnage estimation.  Pits for scenario 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 were chosen, 
and highlighted above. 
 
Preliminary pit design on optimal pit #35 for both scenario 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 was carried out 
using the main engineering parameters provided by the client and audited by Howe. 
 
The results of the pit design for scenario 1.2.1 were acceptable with relative difference in 
values between the optimal and designed pit being within 7-8%.  Results for scenario 1.2.2 
with steeper pit slope angle in the primary zone proved unacceptable with greater than 20% 
difference in pit volume between optimal and designed pits.

*Scoping study mineable tonnage classification is based upon CIM/JORC compliant resource classification 
categories. Measured and indicated resource blocks which are situated within the pit design are classified as  
mineable. Inferred blocks are classified along with waste. 
*Tables in this section were prepared in excel which results in some minor variations between the input and the 
total figures, due to rounding performed. 
 
 
The volume of scenario 1.2.1 designed Pit#35 for Uzboy West and East zones is equal to 
26.4M m³, containing a total of 9.5M tonnes of economically mineable material.  Waste 
material totals 22.8M m³, which represents 59.7 M tonnes of material. The common mineable 
tonnes to waste strip ratio is 6.3 tonne per tonne. 
 
Total oxide, transitional and primary mineable tonnages divided as to Class 1 and Class 
2 (instead of proven and probable) at West and East Uzboy, for operating scenario 1.2.1 
designed pit #35 as of 31 December 2007 are 9.5Mt @ 1.76g/t Au for 538,500oz Au.  
 
Total recoverable ounces of gold after mining losses and processing recoveries have been 
factored in, are estimated at 352.6k oz Au and 68.1k oz Au for West and East Uzboy 
respectively.  Total recoverable gold for the Uzboy project based upon operating 
scenario 1.2.1 equals approximately 420.7k ounces Au. 
 
In ACA Howe's opinion the results of the 16 scenario optimisation scoping study are 
encouraging, with positive net present values being generated for all input and operating 
scenarios to optimisation. 
 
The study found scenario 1.2.1 using CIM compliant block model inputs to optimisation 
(Measured and Indicated blocks only) most feasible, with positive and acceptable results 
returned from an operating scenario using an annual production rate of 1.2Mtpa for 
oxide (currently in place) and 3.6Mtpa for transitional and primary mineable tonnes, 
overall inter-ramp pit slopes of 45° for all zones and 0.4g/t gold processing cut off.  This 
operating scenario generates an NPV for the project of approximately US$90M over a 3-
4 year mine life. 
 



 

 vi

Open pit designs for scenario 1.2.1 generate pits to a maximum depth of -12mRL at west 
Uzboy and 84mRL at East Uzboy. Pits extend from an approximate surface level of 230mRL. 
Alternate selected optimal pit #35 for scenario 1.2.2, using same inputs as scenario 1.2.1 with 
steeper inter-ramp pit slope angle of 60° for the primary zone does generate an even greater 
net present value of approximately US$143M.  However it was impossible to design a valid 
pit for the optimal shell based upon the inter-ramp pit slope input of 60 degrees for the 
primary as inclusion of the haul road using this slope angle increased the overall pit volume 
too much. 
 
To further investigate the option of increased pit slope angle for the primary zone it is 
recommended optimisation is undertaken using pit slope angles of 50-52 degrees for the 
primary zone and 40-42 degrees for the oxide and transitional zones, as these will better take 
into consideration the inclusion of the haul road as part of the preliminary pit design 
(Nesterov, pers. comm.). 
 
Optimisation using scenarios 2.x.x (which include Inferred resource blocks) proved extremely 
useful in highlighting the potential to increase measured and indicated resources and, 
ultimately, mineable tonnage at Uzboy. 
 
Using the same feasible technical-economic scheme as scenario 1.2.1 which accommodates 
an acceptable pit design, but including Inferred resource blocks, the optimal pit returns an 
increased NPV of US$130M.  This represents a US$40M increase on NPV generated by 
optimisation using Measured and Indicated blocks only.  
 
Significant scope remains for conversion of inferred material to indicated and measured, and 
from waste to mineable tonnes at both East and West Uzboy. 
 
Future work should involve the conversion of Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated 
resources for inclusion in mineable tonnage estimation.  Optimum pit shell #32 for operating 
scenario 2.2.1 should be used in plan, cross sections and long sections for effective resource 
and mineable tonnage upgrade drill targeting. 
 
ACA Howe recommends future work to advance the open pit project study towards 
Prefeasibility including improved definition and inclusion of: 
 

• Mining parameters and geotechnical data 
• Test based hydrogeological parameters 
• Equipment, consumables and personnel lists for mining, processing, infrastructure 

and administration 
• Final pit and dump outlines 
• Annual pit and dump outlines 
• Detailed annual production and waste tonnage and grade schedules 
• Detailed flow diagrams for primary processing methods 
• Plant site plans 
• Inclusion of Financial Status Report costs 
• Infrastructure facilities list 
• Detailed power and water parameters 
• Detailed environmental permit/regulatory framework reports 
• Environmental Impact Analysis and environmental impact mitigation plan 
• Mine waste management plan 
• Provision of solid and hazardous material handling methods 
• Provision of spill prevention and emergency response plans 
• Environmental capital and operating cost estimates 
• Environmental closure costs and accounting methods 



 

 vii

• Development schedule chart 
• Principle economic parameters including IRR and ROI 
• Royalties and cash flows 
• Detailed operating parameter sensitivity analysis 

 
In addition, recommendations for further and improved practices, data collection, analyses, 
sample recovery, domain modelling and geotechnical listed in the ACA Howe report (Hogg, 
2008) must be considered prior to moving forward.  This work should include the 
improvement of geotechnical core logging, QAQC sample input practices to include field 
duplicates, blanks and insertion of CRMs at the sample collection stage. 
 
Significant quantities and grade of primary resources exist below the optimised pit#35 
designed pit shell, particularly along the plunge to the southwest at West Uzboy.  CIM 
classified Measured, Indicated and Inferred primary resources below pit shell #35, are 
presented in the tables 68 to 71. 
 
West Uzboy below pit measured and indicated resources reported at a greater than 0.4g/t Au 
cut off are 8.16 million tonnes at 1.28 g/t Au for 335,900 oz Au. Inferred resources reported at 
a greater than 0.4g/t Au cut off are 2.761 million tonnes at 1.36 g/t amounting to 121,100 oz 
Au. 
 
East Uzboy below pit measured and indicated resources reported at a greater than 0.4g/t Au 
cut off are 2.659 million tonnes at 0.99 g/t for 84,700 oz Au. Inferred resources reported at a 
greater than 0.4g/t Au cut off are 4.087 million tonnes at 1.15 g/t for 151,500 oz Au. 
   
Based upon the above pit resource figures ACA Howe also recommends further investigation 
and definition of primary resources to scope potential economic underground mining 
operations at Uzboy.

1. INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

At the request of Mr. Elmer Stewart, Chief Operating Officer of Alhambra Resources Limited 
(Alhambra), geological consultants ACA Howe International Limited ("Howe") were 
employed to conduct an independent CIM compliant scoping study upon the combined oxide, 
transitional and primary resource material types at the Uzboy gold deposit and prepare a 
Technical Report ("the Report") specific to the standards dictated by National Instrument 43-
101 ("NI 43-101") and Form 43-101F1 (Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects) with 
respect to the Uzboy deposit ("the Deposit") located in Akmola Oblast, Kazakhstan.  Howe 
understands that Alhambra will be filing this report electronically on SEDAR pursuant to NI 
43-101. 

The following independent technical study report has been prepared by Mr J N Hogg M.Sc, 
MAIG, Senior Geologist, with section contributions and study supervision from Mr. Neil 
Holloway, C. Eng., ACA Howe Associate Process Engineer and Mr. Julian Bennett, C. Eng., 
ACA Howe Associate Mining Engineer, and Mr. Oleg Nesterov, ACA Howe (Australia) 
Contract Mining Engineer. 
  
The gold deposit estimations conducted at Uzboy comprised: 
 

• The West Zone Uzboy Gold Deposit 
• The East Zone Uzboy Gold Deposit 

 
Assessment and estimation has been made by desk study involving previous report review 
and data collection methodology review, exploration data review and validation, modelling of 
available data, estimation and reporting. Site visits were undertaken by Mr J N Hogg (Howe 
Senior Geologist) and Mr. G R White (Howe Senior Resource Geologist) on 12th – 15th 
December 2006, in the company of Mr Serik Khairaliyev, Director General of Saga Creek 
Gold Company, a 100% Alhambra owned Kazakhstan mining company.  These visits are 
considered current as data collection methodologies, sample preparation and analytical 
techniques are the same. 
 
This report is based on the findings of the Howe visit and desk study, detailed resource input 
data review, deposit model development and computerised block model resource estimations, 
pit optimisation, preliminary economic evaluations, pit design and mineable tonnage 
estimations divided as to Class 1 and Class 2 (instead of proven and probable).  The report 
follows the format of a National Instrument 43-101 report with certain sections adapted and 
referenced from the Howe Feasibility Study on the Uzboy Gold Project, Akmola Oblast,

3. PROPERTY, LOCATION AND ACCESS 

The Uzboy project is located approximately 400km north-northeast of Astana in northern 
Kazakhstan. 
 
The Uzboy deposit is one of a number of gold occurrences within Alhambra's licence areas 
(Figures 1 and 2). 
 
The following sections are modified from Comeau et al, 2006. 

3.1.  KAZAKHSTAN: GEOGRAPHY, INFRASTRUCTURE AND ECONOMY  

Kazakhstan is one of the newly formed nations (1991) comprising the Commonwealth of 
Independent States ("CIS") organized after the fall of the Former Soviet Union ("FSU"). The 
country occupies a large portion of central and northern Asia, extending from China to the 
borderlands of Europe (Figure 1). It is bounded on the north and west by Russia and the 
Caspian Sea, on the south by Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan and on the east by 
China. Its population of approximately 15 million people is scattered within 2.7 million 
square kilometres making it the 9th largest country in the world with the approximate size of 
Western Europe or western Canada. 
 
Most of the country is at a relatively low elevation with the exception of the Tian Shan 
Mountains in the extreme south which form Kazakhstan's frontier with its southern 
neighbours. The majority of the country is composed of extensive grasslands (steppes) and 
arid and semi-desert regions. The climate is true continental with cold winters (-40°C) and hot 
summers (+40°C). Precipitation varies from 180 to 390 mm's per year. Snow cover occurs 
from the end of October to April. 
 
The country has a reliable source of power, international communications and 
international/national air transportation. Kazakhstan is regarded as the most progressive 
nation within the CIS in its drive towards a market economy. Infrastructure, such as railways, 
roads, and oil and gas pipelines was well developed during the Soviet era in order to service 
the natural resources and agricultural industries. Although Kazakhstan is land-locked, access 
to the Mediterranean Sea is attained through canals linking the Caspian and Black Seas. 
 
Under the Soviet Centrally Planned Economic system, Kazakhstan's development was based 
on agriculture and natural resources. The precious metals resource industry is now seen as a 
major contributor in establishing Kazakhstan as a dynamic independent nation. The country's 
development will depend largely on its ability to exploit the natural resources with which it is 
richly endowed. These include very large reserves of oil, gas and coal and substantial iron and 
non-ferrous metals including chrome, lead, tungsten, copper, zinc and gold.

3.2.  LICENCES AND TENURE 

The information contained in this section has been provided by Alhambra Resources Limited.  
The legal status of the various transactions has not been verified by A C A Howe, who are 
unqualified to make any judgement on legal issues. 
 
On July 17, 1996 Cameco Gold Inc. formed a Joint Venture with Goodwin Golems LLP 
("Goodwin"), a local Kazakhstan company based in Almaty. The Joint Venture company was 
named the Saga Creek Gold Company LLP ("Saga Creek") and was registered in the state 
registry of legal entities of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan as a legal 
entity in the form of a joint venture with limited liability to carry-out mineral exploration and 
exploitation in Kazakhstan. The Joint Venture was managed and operated by Cameco with 
Cameco's interest being 80% while Goodwin's interest was 20%. Cameco funded 100% of all 
expenditures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



FIGURE 1: Location of Alhambra Resources Uzboy Licences (taken from LeBoutillier, 2006)

Two exploration and exploitation licenses in northern Kazakhstan were initially granted to 
Cameco; the Sary-Arka License (MG#1029DD – issued April 8, 1996), a large area of land 
encompassing 24,900 km2, extending from a point immediately east of the city of Kokshetau 
at the northwest portion of the license, extending in an south-easterly direction to the mining 
town of Bestube in the southeast. A second, smaller, license, the Uzboy License (MG#719D – 
issued May 23, 1996), measured 1,102 km2 and was located internally to the Sary-Arka 
license and thus was an area excluded from the Sary-Arka license. The Uzboy prospect itself, 
although located immediately to the north of the Uzboy license, was technically and 
physically located within the Sary-Arka license (Figures 1 and 2). 
 
The licenses were consolidated and re-issued to the Saga Creek Gold Company LLP on 
February 10, 1997 and are valid for 25 years, with the initial 5 years specifically devoted 
towards exploration and the remaining 20 years for mining purposes. All Government 
property descriptions utilize latitudes and longitudes and both the Sary-Arka and Uzboy 
Licenses are described in such manner. No property boundaries are surveyed on the ground. 
 
The Saga Creek Gold Company, under Cameco management, carried out exploration efforts 
on both licenses during 1996 and 1997 but concentrated their efforts on the Uzboy prospect 
itself. In April of 2000, Cameco pulled out of the Joint Venture and transferred its share and 
obligations to Marsa Aktiengesellschaft ("Marsa": with registered offices in Mauren, 
Liechtenstein). After the transfer, the Saga Creek Gold Company LLP was owned by Marsa 
(80%) and Goodwin (20%). 
 
The ownership of Goodwin was sold in March 2002 to Teragol Investments Limited 
("Teragol") incorporated in Cyprus. Saga Creek carried out exploration activity on the Uzboy 
license until the end of 2001. Marsa funded all expenditures since the transfer of ownership 
through to 2001. Cameco no longer retains any interest in either the joint venture or the 
licenses. 
 
Pursuant to a Partnership Unit Purchase and Exchange Agreement dated March 21, 2002 (the 
"Agreement"), Alhambra agreed to purchase all of the partnership units of Saga Creek and 
Goodwin Golems, and as a result, obtain the Licenses to the Uzboy Property in exchange for 
4,000,000 common shares of Alhambra (previously defined as the "Transaction"). Alhambra 
also agreed to grant to Marsa and Teragol, in aggregate, a net smelter return with respect to 
the production on mines and minerals from the Uzboy Property as follows; (i) 2.5% of gross 
revenue in the event the weighted average price of gold is less than $300 (U.S.) per ounce; (ii) 
2.75% of gross revenue in the event the weighted average price of gold is equal to or greater 
than $300 (U.S.) per ounce; and (iii) 3% of gross revenue in the event that the weighted 
average price of gold is equal to or greater than $350 (U.S.) per ounce. 
 
The TSX Venture Exchange approved the Transaction in October 2003. 
 
The Republic of Kazakhstan Contract on Foreign Investments was put in force on February 
18, 1997 and dictated that 50% of the initial license was to be relinquished over time (5 years 
from the date of granting the License). In May of 2001, 44.3% of the original Uzboy license 
land parcel was returned to the state. On September 26, 2001, an additional 11.79% was 
surrendered, resulting in an aggregate returned area of 56.1%. With respect to the Sary-Arka 
license, 58% (14,390 km2) of the total initial license territory was returned in a timely manner 
and in accordance with the license conditions. Two mining allotments were granted 
(December 2001) to Saga Creek on areas of recognized gold mineralisation at the Uzboy 
prospect itself.

4. TOPOGRAPHY, VEGETATION, CLIMATE AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

The following section is modified from Comeau et al, 2006. 
 
The region is predominantly steppe with some limited highlands in the western portion of the 
Sary–Arka license in the area of Borovoye. Local small areas of birch groves are quite 
common throughout the steppes. Modern drainage systems are weakly developed with 
abundant small saline lakes. Topography in the project area is typical of the Kazakhstan – 
Russian steppes, with flat expanses of grasslands and local flat to low rounded hills. 
Elevations range from 200 metres to 900 metres above sea level in the health resort area of 
Borovoye. Rock outcrop is less than 1%. The lands are covered by perennial grasses, which 
are used for ranching or agriculture. The predominant crop grown is wheat. 
 
The climate of the area is extreme continental with hot summers (+40ºC) and cold winters (-
40ºC). Precipitation is low with rainfall generally below 250 millimetres per year and snow 
accumulation averaging 1.5 metres per year. 
 
The area is represented by a steppe landscape with a good development of paved highways 
and dirt roads. Kokshetau, Stepnogorsk and nearby Zaozerny (former uranium mining town) 
have railway stations. Both Kokshetau and Astana have international airports. Power grids are 
well developed. Electrical power is available through a 10 kV power line brought to the site in 
2002, a distance of 18 kilometres. The licenses are located in a pro-mining region of a pro-
mining Oblast. 
 
Access by the authors to the Uzboy prospect was through the town of Stepnogorsk 
approximately 200 kilometres by road to the south. Stepnogorsk and its neighbouring town 
Aksu are long-established mining centres with plentiful access to mining infrastructure, 
equipment as well as experienced mining people. The authors travelled approximately 180 
kilometres north from Stepnogorsk via paved, all-season, highway through steppe country and 
the town of Stepnyak, host to the now-closed Stepnyak mine. 
 
The remaining 20 kilometres have been substantially improved by Saga Creek, providing easy 
access to the project. 
 

5. HISTORY 

The following section is modified from Comeau et al, 2006. 
 
The discovery of uranium during the late 1950's in the region led to 40 years of aggressive 
uranium exploration within the central and northern steppes of Kazakhstan. A massive 
amount of geological, geochemical and geophysical information has been generated through 
the years, most of which remains in the Russian language. 
 
During peak years, as much as 1,000,000 metres of Soviet-style reverse circulation drilling 
was accomplished. This drilling method (abbreviated to KΓK –"hydraulic lifting of core") is 
an extremely useful and efficient method, especially as a geochemical exploration and 
geological mapping aid.  This type of drilling is interpreted to resemble western style 'wet' or 
water injected RAB or Aircore drilling methods. 
 
The Soviets sampled and mapped much of northern Kazakhstan in areas of oxidized bedrock 
(referred to as "weathering crust") in this manner. All samples underwent whole rock 
analyses. Geological records were kept and where geochemical anomalies were detected, 
further detailed drilling was often carried-out, sometimes followed by core drilling. Much of 



 

 13

the geological knowledge of this part of the world was gathered through this style of reverse 
circulation drilling. 
 
This work led to the discovery of many of the presently known gold occurrences (including 
Uzboy) in northern Kazakhstan including most of the 200 occurrences on the original Uzboy 
and Sary-Arka licenses. The Uzboy deposit was discovered by the Stepgeology Geological 
Expedition #41, whilst conducting regional prospecting for uranium back in 1990–1991.  On 
the break up of the FSU in the early 1990's uranium mining and exploration stopped in the 
region.  
 
Stepgeology returned to the Uzboy area in 1994-1995 and focused on the gold potential of the 
region, conducting additional KΓK 'reverse circulation' drilling, detailed geophysics and core 
drilling. 
 
Twelve core holes were completed in the Uzboy area by the Kazzoloto Expedition 
("Kazzoloto"), based in Aksu, with 8 of the holes located along an east-west profile line 
testing the Uzboy discovery. 
 
Both the KΓK and core drilling programs outlined zones of beresitic and/or quartz-chlorite-
pyrite alteration within dacite porphyries plus local andesites and tuffs. The gold 
mineralisation is intimately associated with these units and more specifically with quartz-
carbonate veinlets and stringers within highly sheared host rocks and also, commonly 
associated with non-deformed rock units as more of a stockwork-type quartz-carbonate 
veinlet occurrence. 
 
Alhambra entered into the project in 2001.  Saga Creek (now funded by the new partner 
Alhambra) focused its efforts exclusively on the shallow (± 50 metres), oxide potential of the 
mineralized zones. 
 
Based on the results of the KΓK reverse circulation drilling and past exploration activity, 
Saga Creek commenced stripping the area on the Uzboy West prospect (previously defined as 
Zone # 3) in July 2002, as part of the first bench (220m elevation). 
 
Mining of the oxide material at Uzboy up to 31 December 2007 has taken the West Uzboy pit 
down to bench 195m elevation and East Uzboy down to the 210m elevation. 
 
According to schedules provided to Howe, total production figures for the operation up to 31 
December 2007, at a 70% recovery rate are 75.1koz Au stacked for 49.8koz Au leached for 
48.5koz Au stripped. 
 

6. GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

The following Section 7 is summarised from Comeau et al, 2006.  Detailed geological 
descriptions can be found in the Comeau et al (2006) report.  
 
The licenses are located within the northeast portion of the regional-scale Kokchetav-North 
Tienshan basin and dome fold system of Caledonian age. Four elongated mega-structural 
zones occur in the north part of the Kokchetav - North Tienshan fold system and form the 
basic structural framework for the region (Figure 3). 
 
Sedimentary, magmatic and metamorphic rocks ranging in age from Proterozoic to middle-
late Palaeozoic underlie the license areas (Figure 4). Intrusive complexes ranging in age from 
Cambrian to Devonian primarily consist of ultrabasic, gabbros, diorites, granodiorites and 
granites. Several major, deep-seated, abyssal faults cross the licenses and played an important 



 

 14

role in the geological evolution of northern Kazakhstan. Generally the faults separate 
differing crustal blocks and formed during the Proterozoic. 
 
Wide structural-metallogenic zones contributed to the tectonic framework of the license areas. 
The structural zone of prime interest in the Uzboy area is the Shatskaya Zone, which is 
located in the northern portion of the licenses and extends along an east-west trend, separating 
Proterozoic rock assemblages in the north from mainly Palaeozoic units in the south. The 
Shatskaya Zone also appears to control and geographically define a line of Devonian 
volcanism. This structure hosts the well-recognized Vasilkovskoe gold deposit in the west as 
well as the Uzboy occurrence itself located towards the central portion of the zone. 
 
The Uzboy area is underlain by Silurian-Devonian-aged volcanic intrusive and/or flow rocks 
of dacitic and andesitic composition and their tuff equivalents. The general strike of the 
volcanic package is east to east-northeast and the units are thought to be near horizontal in 
attitude. Rhyolite and diabase dykes are common throughout the volcanic package and 
display a similar parallel strike and dip. The region to the immediate north has been intruded 
by granodiorites of possible Devonian or younger age. 
 
Zones of intense silicification, quartz-carbonate veins and stockwork veining and chlorite-
sericite alteration are associated with the fault/shear system. The main gold mineralisation at 
Uzboy appears to be associated with the sheared and stockwork zones. 
 
Modern sediments are comprised of alluvial and lakebed sediments. The alluvial sediments 
exhibit various grain-sized sands, gravel and loams. The lake sediments are mostly silts, clays 
and rare various-grained gravel sands.

7.   LOCAL GEOLOGY 

The following Section 8 is modified from Comeau, 2006. 
 
The Uzboy prospect is situated on the northwest portion of the Silurian-Lower Devonian-aged 
Uzboy Volcanic-Tectonic Structure. 
 
The Uzboy Volcanic-Tectonic Structure extends along a northwest sub lateral trend, with a 
length of approximately 35 kilometres and a width of 10-15 kilometres. The Uzboy structure 
is in fault contact with Ordovician-age rock units. The Silurian-Lower Devonian-aged rocks 
exhibit a sharp non-conformity with the different rocks of Ordovician age. The bottom of the 
Uzboy section consists of basal conglomerates. 
 
The Uzboy Volcanic-Tectonic Structure was formed during the Hercynian orogenic activation 
of the Caledonian basement (previously described). During this period, vertical displacement 
along northwest and northeast-trending faults created a graben-synclinal structure overlaid by 
a sequence of volcanic-sedimentary formations of Ordovician-age. Rudaceous terrigenous 
sediments and intensive continental mafic volcanism formed in the Uzboy Volcanic-Tectonic 
Structure during the late Silurian and early Devonian period. The vertical movement along 
northwest and northeast trending faults terminated during the final stage of the Hercynian 
orogeny resulting in the upper Silurian and late Devonian rock units at the Uzboy project 
being broken into several fault blocks which show various amplitudes of vertical 
displacements. Blocks of Ordovician rocks exhibit fault contacts along a northwest trending 
axis of between 5 to 7 kilometres and a northeast trend of between 2 and 3 kilometres across. 
The final stage of the Hercynian orogeny was also accompanied by Palaeozoic-age 
hypabyssal grano-syenite intrusives usually exhibiting a northeast trend along fault contacts. 
 
The Uzboy mineralized trend is associated with the Shokeyskaia tectonic zone and bounded 
by the Shatsky anticlinorium in the northeast. The southwest boundary of the Uzboy 
mineralized trend has not been defined. In the central part, towards the southwest, the Uzboy 
mineralized trend is crossed by the sub-lateral Aygabak fault. The Uzboy mineralized trend is 
characterized by gold-silver geochemical anomalies occurring along the Uzboy fault system 
and hosted by Ordovician – Silurian rocks. This trend is localized between two northeast 
trending structures that control the occurrence of granitoid and gabbroic intrusions of 
Paleozoic age. The Kirtoge gold occurrence is located at the northeast flank of the Uzboy 
mineralized trend. 
 
The Uzboy gold deposit is situated in the central part of the Uzboy mineralized trend located 
within a Silurian to late Devonian graben and complicates the central part of the synclinal fold 
occupied by Ordovician rocks. The graben and syncline extend in a northeast direction. The 
fault zone occurs in the central part of the structure and controls the Uzboy gold deposit. 
Paleozoic granodiorites and diorite stockwork occurs along the northeast extension of the 
fault (Figure 5). 
 

7.1.  LITHOLOGIES 

Volcanic and red-bed sedimentary units of the upper Devonian Maylisorsky and Maiatsky 
suites, continental sediments of Silurian to late Devonian age and Cenozoic sediments occur 
within the Uzboy license area (Figure 5). 
 
Rocks of Silurian-Devonian-age occur in the graben-syncline underlying the project and are 
essentially brownish and purple-brown in colour. The central part of the paleo-volcanic body 
is composed of extrusive and effusive rhyodacites. Conformable beds of sub-volcanic 
andesite porphyry occur in the eastern part of the Uzboy West deposit. In a western 



 

 18

direction, the number of intrusions gradually decrease and are replaced along strike by tuffs 
and tuffaceous sandstone as well as interlayered siltstone. Different volcanic units such as 
dacite, tuff-dacite, rhyodacite and more rarely andesitic-dacite and andesite occur in the 
western part of the Uzboy area. All rocks of Silurian-Devonian-age exhibit varying degrees of 
metasomatic alteration. 
 
The Mesozoic weathering crust occurs practically everywhere in the license area and in some 
places is covered by Cenozoic sediments. The weathering crust is characterized by sub-
horizontal zones. Where the saprolite intersects fault zones, the direction and depth of the 
weathering crust is controlled by the faulting.  
 
The Weathering crust profile by degree of alteration may be divided into the five following 
categories (from top to bottom): 
 

• Clay weathering crust (zone of complete oxidation) represented by reddish-yellow, 
light-gray-green, light brown, gray and rosy-red clay, sometimes with the inclusions 
of iron nodules. Traces of the original rock structures and textures sometimes occur at 
the bottom of this section of the weathering crust. The thickness of this portion of the 
weathering crust ranges from 0.8 to 4.5 metres. 

 
• Structural clay, argillaceous and sandy loam weathering crust (upper part of the 

intermediate oxidation section) is represented by clay and by sandy loam. Where the 
host contains a high quartz content, this unit exhibits the structure and texture of the 
original rocks. The thickness varies from 4 to 9 metres and up to 18 metres within 
fractured intervals (downward protrusion of oxidation along fractures and faults). 

 
• Clay-fragment weathering crust (the amount of the fragments is less than 50%). The 

zone of intermittent oxidation is mostly composed of clay, loam and clay sand. The 
thickness ranges from 1.5 to 8-12 metres and up to 17 metres within fractured 
intervals. 

 
• Fragment-clay weathering crust (the amount of fragments is more than 50%), forms 

the upper part of the zone of disintegration. Its thickness ranges from 0.2 to 13 
metres.  

 
• Strongly oxidized fractured rocks occur in the lower part of the zone of disintegration. 

The thickness is from 6-10 metres to 19-26 metres.

8. DEPOSIT TYPES 

Section 9 is modified from Comeau (2006). 
 
According to Burshtein (1996), most of the gold deposits of northern Kazakhstan are 
associated with tonalite-granodiorite plutons of the Qryqquduk Complex of Late Ordovician 
age. Spiridonov (1996) has suggested that the main gold deposits of the region are closely 
related to the minor ore-bearing multiphase intrusions of the Stepnyak type, which represents 
a facies of the Qryqquduk Complex. 
 
The main quartz-vein and stockwork types gold deposits (Stepnyak, Dombraly, Bestube, 
Vasilkovskoe, Aksu and Zholymbet) are characterized chiefly by a phyllic wall rock 
alteration. Quartz-sulphide-gold deposits (Stepnyak, Aksu, and Zholymbet) and quartz-gold 
deposits with minor amounts of sulphides (Vasilkovskoe and Bailusty) are recognized. 
 
The Uzboy prospect falls within the Shatskaya structural zone (Figure 1) which hosts many of 
the major gold deposits of Kazakhstan. The majority of gold occurrences is within steeply 
dipping quartz veins or associated with sulphide-rich zones with intense silicification and 
sericitization alteration patterns. 
 
The Uzboy area is underlain by Devonian-aged volcanic intrusive and/or flow rocks of 
dacitic, andesitic and basaltic composition and their tuff equivalents. The main trend, the 
Uzboy fault or shear zone tends to parallel the volcanic lithologies and strikes east-northeast 
at a slight angle to the regional Shatskaya structural zone and has been interpreted as being a 
splay off this main structural feature. The interpreted Uzboy fault structure has been traced, as 
a series of postulated faults, shears and brecciated zones, for a distance of approximately 25 
kilometres. A later series of northwesterly-trending faults offset the main Uzboy structural 
zone. 
 
Peregudov and Sliva (1996) concluded that the propylitization and beresitic alteration 
packages pre-dated the gold depositional event. Later, multi-stage introduction of gold-
bearing fluids occurred, as both brittle and ductile deformational hosts are recognized. 
 
Areas of economic enrichment do not differ much visually from the non-economic areas and 
weakly mineralized areas. The zone boundaries will have to be established by analytical 
procedures. 
 
According to Melrose and Mathews, (1996), the Uzboy occurrence exhibits similarities to 
Bousquet (Quebec) style alteration and mineralisation. The hosts at Bousquet are felsic 
volcanic rocks which have been metamorphosed to pyritic-quartz-sericite schist. The gold 
mineralisation is commonly confined to the more deformed areas within a broad high strain 
zone. 
 
The deposit exhibits a gold enrichment halo in the order of 100 to 300 ppb Au up to 300 
metres away from the main areas of gold deposition. 
 

9. MINERALISATION 

The gold mineralisation in the Uzboy project developed mainly during the Hercynian 
tectonic-magmatic cycle. 
 
The Uzboy tectonic zone is the main host structure for the Uzboy West and Uzboy East zones 
of gold mineralisation. During Hercynian times, the Uzboy tectonic zone was a right-lateral 
strike-slip fault represented by a number of sub-parallel-trending faults (30º - 35º) with a 



 

 21

combined length of 4 kilometres. The fault dips from 70º to 80° to the north-west. The faults 
of the Uzboy zone control the hydrothermal metasomatic alteration, gold mineralisation, 
upper Paleozoic diorite stockwork, and in some cases are the borders of the elevated tectonic 
blocks formed by Ordovician sediments. The Uzboy tectonic zone is complicated by the 
occurrence of numerous related faults such as antithetic and synthetic faults, down throw and 
thrust faults and intense folding due to faulting. The combination of these structures 
determines the general morphology of both the oxide and primary gold mineralisation. 
 
Where zones of either fracture cleavage or quartz veinlets occur in drill core, these intervals 
are described as fault zones. In many cases the intervals of faulting are represented by tectonic 
breccias in which relics of the host volcanic-sedimentary rocks are cemented by mylonized 
rock. The tectonic breccias probably formed after emplacement of the gold mineralisation, 
during the formation of the sub-longitudinal faults. The intervals of tectonic breccia exhibit 
lower gold grades in comparison with zones of fracture cleavage and quartz veinlets. 
 
There are three zones of gold mineralisation within the Uzboy West and Uzboy East deposits: 
 

• Oxide mineralisation 
• Transition zone mineralisation 
• Primary mineralisation. 

 
The oxide gold mineralisation consists of clay-gravel weathering crust of siallite (kaolinite-
allophane) type. The most common colour of the oxide is greenish-yellow with different 
shades of white, brown and red. Strongly oxidized rhyodacite and dacite are represented by 
light green and grey colour rock, oxidized andesite has a brown and red colour.  
 
Alteration of the original rocks consists of synvolcanic hematitic alteration, beresitic 
alteration and hydrothermal-metasomatic alteration. 
 
Synvolcanic hematitic alteration occurs widely throughout the entire mineralized area and is 
represented by the replacement of mafic minerals with dust-like magnetite and hematite 
(opacitization). This process occurred due to oxidization of the dark coloured minerals during 
extrusion of the lava flows. Due to opacitization, the rocks altered colour to lilac and 
brownish colour. 
 
Beresitic alteration of volcanogenic-sedimentary rocks occurs within the mineralized zones. 
Several north-east trending zones of hydrothermal-metasomatically altered rocks controlled 
by strike-slip tectonic faults occur within the Uzboy area. These zones have a strike length 
from several hundred to a few thousand metres. The width of the beresite zones ranges from 
tens to hundreds of metres. As a rule, the zone of gold mineralisation is usually smaller in size 
compared with the beresite alteration. 
 
Beresitization in the volcanic package consists of the following zonation: 
 
• An outer zone of quartz, carbonate, sericite, chlorite, hematite and leucoxene 
• An intermediate zone containing quartz, sericite, carbonate, pyrite, leucoxene and rutile 
• A central zone of quartz, sericite and pyrite 
 
An analysis of the gold distribution within the Uzboy zones indicates that gold grades ranging 
from 0.1 – 2.0 g Au/t is primarily restricted to homogeneous beresites, while gold grades of 
more than 5.0 g Au/t are primarily restricted to areas where silicification, carbonatization and 
veinlet pyrite mineralisation has been superposed on quartz-sericite-pyrite altered rocks.

The steeply dipping gold-bearing zones have been oxidized to a depth of approximately 50 
metres. Locally, in areas of shallow, vertical fracturing and faulting, oxidation has progressed 
to greater depth than the average profile. 
 
Previous studies did not find any significant migration of gold during the oxidation process. 
Typically the gold grains are coarser and a minor increase in gold grade occurs within the 
oxides compared to the original rocks. The increase in the gold grade of the oxides does not 
exceed 10%. 
 
Underlying the oxidized unit, a semi-oxidized horizon displays a partial level of oxidation 
with some remaining sulphides (transition zone) and may be treatable for its gold content but 
with lower recoveries. 
 
The oxidation of the area has resulted in the decomposition of the gold-bearing sulphides and 
the subsequent liberation of the gold particles. Gold is mostly present in free form and 
amenable to cyanide solution. 
 
Hydrothermal metasomatic alteration: The main mineral associations related to the main 
gold depositional event at Uzboy are hematite-pyrite-quartz; gold-sulphide-quartz; pyrite-
marcasite-quartz; carbonate-barite-polymetallic and quartz-calcite. The first four 
associations are clearly connected with the mineralisation process. Each association can occur 
separately, forming steeply-dipping veinlets, spots and impregnations. As well, these 
alteration packages can occur together. All mineral associations can occur in the mineralized 
zones showing intense silicification of the rocks. The fifth and last association forms blanket 
veins. 
 
The Hematite-pyrite-quartz association is the earliest stage and can occur in both 
mineralized zones and in silicified host rocks. This association forms steeply-dipping veinlets 
and rare disseminated grains. Macroscopically this association exhibits brown red colouration 
of accompanying quartz. The thickness of the veins ranges from 1 millimetre to 3-5 
centimetres. The borders of this style of alteration are usually uneven, often exhibiting pinch-
and-swell forms and relics of the original rocks. 
 
Quartz is the main mineral of this association. The grain size ranges from 0.01 to 0.1 
millimetres with the 0.01-0.03 millimetre grain size being the most prevalent. Coarse-grained 
quartz (usually 0.07 to 0.09 millimetres in diameter) occupies the central parts of small veins 
and spots. Quartz grains exhibit round shapes and/or oblong forms. Hematite is unevenly 
distributed and usually colours fine-grained quartz in some instance. Pyrite exhibits 
pyritohedron shapes and rarely cubic crystal habits. The pyrite grains range in size from 0.05 
to 0.2 millimetre and occur inside clear quartz grains. 
 
In addition to the minerals described above, thin-flakes of sericite can occur in the centre of 
the quartz veins and spots and can be replaced by chlorite or chlorite-ankerite. Chlorite occurs 
only in contact with carbonate with sericite forming the edges between these minerals. 
Chalcopyrite rarely occurs together with pyrite and forms thin veinlets and impregnations. 
 
Gold-sulphide-quartz is the main mineral association of economic interest. This association 
forms thin (a few millimetres to 1-2 centimetres) veins and small impregnations within 
sericitized and silicified rocks. The spatial occurrence of the hematite-pyrite-quartz and gold-
sulphide-quartz association forming single veins is common. In this case, the earlier hematite-
pyrite-quartz association occurs in the center of rock fragments while the gold-sulphide-
quartz association occurs as a selvage. Sometimes hematite-pyrite-quartz and gold-sulphide-
quartz cross-cut each other and/or occur separately. 
 



 

 23

Pyrite, sphalerite, fahlore (tetrahedrite?), galena and chalcopyrite are the main sulphide 
minerals of this association. Grains of free gold also occur. Quartz occurs in veins. 
 
Pyrite is represented by large (0.1 millimetre to 0.3 millimetre and rare 1.0 millimetre 
diameter) separate crystals or crystalline aggregates. Pyrite has a poor crystal shape. Spatially, 
pyrite occurs on the vein selvages and in the central part of sulphide mineral spots. 
 
Sphalerite forms relatively large (1 to 2 millimetre) grains in quartz veins. Usually, sphalerite 
grows around pyrite, "curing" small cracks inside pyrite grains. Pyrite and sphalerite occur as 
separate grains in the impregnated type of mineralisation. Disseminated chalcopyrite grains 
occur in the center of sphalerite grains. 
 
Galena, fahlore (tetrahedrite?) and chalcopyrite usually form the edges along sphalerite 
grains. These minerals, especially galena, form disseminated aggregates and micro-veinlets 
inside sphalerite grain boundaries if chalcopyrite does not occur in the sphalerite. Galena and 
chalcopyrite are associated constantly at different ratio. Galena usually occurs in larger 
quantities. The occurrence of fahlore is rare. 
 
Quartz, as described above occurs in different crystal forms. Usually quartz occurs as slightly 
stretched 0.05 millimetres to 0.1 millimetres grains in contact with sulphides and usually as 
microcrystalline quartz in veins and veinlets. Small (tenths of a millimetre) rhombohedra of 
magnesium-iron carbonates often occur in quartz veins. 
 
The Pyrite-marcasite-quartz association is more common than the gold-quartz-sulphide 
association and usually forms veins, spots and disseminated aggregates in host rocks where 
gold-quartz-sulphide veins occur. 
 
Pyrite and marcasite are the main minerals of the association. Pyrite occurs as grains (tenths 
of a millimetre to 3-5 millimetre) in quartz and rarely as vein-like aggregates and selvages on 
quartz spots up to 1-2 centimetres in thickness. Marcasite usually occurs as needle-like 
crystals, from 2 to 3 millimetres long, and occurs around pyrite and sometimes replaces pyrite 
on its boundaries (up to complete replacement forming marcasite pseudomorphs). 
Arsenopyrite also occurs in veins from time to time. Its habit is usually flattened prismatic 
with a rhomboid cross section. The size of the crystals usually does not exceed 0.12 X 0.30 X 
0.50 millimetres and forms after marcasite epitaxically growing on its needle-like crystals. 
 
The quartz in pyrite-marcasite veinlets is the same as in the gold-sulphide-quartz association. 
Gold-sulphide-quartz and pyrite-marcasite associations are formed one after another or at the 
same time. In this case, pyrite, sphalerite and arsenopyrite are present in quartz veins (as a 
rule sphalerite and marcasite are isolated from each other). Sphalerite occurs on the border 
part, while marcasite occurs in the middle part of quartz veins. There are cases when sharp 
dipping gold-sulphide-quartz veins have stringers represented by marcasite, pyrite, 
arsenopyrite and quartz. 
 
Free gold in pyrite-marcasite-quartz veins has not been observed. However, the gold grade in 
the pyrite-marcasite-quartz association is between 2 to 4 g Au/t grade range and higher. 
Probably the gold is disseminated as fine (sub-micron) grains inside of sulphides and sulpho-
arsenides of iron. 
 
The Carbonate-barite-polymetallic association occurs within carbonate veins cutting gold 
mineralized zones and carbonate spots located in the central parts of gold mineralized veins. 
The quartz-barite veins occur beyond the borders of the mineralized zones in acidic effusives. 
 
The main mineral of the association is a coarse grained magnesium-iron, carbonate-like, 
brown spar. It is separated from the host rocks by a quartz rim. Barite occurs in the form of 



 

 24

tabular or characteristically stretched crystals. The brown spar usually has crystallographic 
faces along the border with barite due to metasomatic replacement of barite by brown spar. 
 
Sulphide minerals occur in carbonate veinlets and spots. Usually, galena either forms large 
(up to 5 millimetres in diameter) grains or micro-veinlets, developed along dolomite crystals. 
Chalcopyrite rarely occurs, usually at the junction of mineralized zones and with galena. 
Sphalerite rarely occurs forming small grains inside crystals of galena and belongs to the late 
sphalerite generation that is different from the earlier iron sphalerite generation by having less 
iron content.  
 
Quartz-calcite association is not very common. Large quartz-calcite veins (5-10 centimetres) 
cross all the above described mineral associations. These veins repeat the composition of the 
host rocks and mineral associations. 
 

9.1.   WEST UZBOY 

The following description is modified from Hogg (2007) and Hogg (2008). 
 
Mineralisation at West Uzboy occurs within a faulted hydrothermal chlorite-sericite altered 
andesitic package bounded by hangingwall and footwall sediments. 
 
Anomalous gold mineralisation at >0.2g/t Au level is currently outlined over an approximate 
strike length of 800m close to surface and width of approximately 350m.  At depth 
mineralisation is interpreted to extend a strike length of approximately 900m, plunging 
toward the south west 100m beyond the near surface mineralisation.  Current depth extents of 
>0.2g/t Au mineralisation reaches approximately 250 metres below surface around the core 
zone extending to approximately 500 metres below surface in the south west. 
 
Gold forms two main converging zones of steep northeast to sub-vertical discreet and diffuse 
structurally controlled laterally extensive lenses, interpreted to be formed in part as a wrench 
system (LeBoutillier pers. comms.).  Discreet zones of increase brecciation within diffuse 
structural zones display increased gold grade. 
 
Within the upper, oxide zone part of the profile secondary distribution of gold has lead to the 
formation of broader >0.2g/t Au halo's (Figure 5). 
 
Mineralised zone 3 dimensional wireframes at West Uzboy as interpreted on cross section, are 
oriented in an approximate 050° direction (the approximate strike of the deposit), dipping 
steeply to the northwest (Figure 6 and 7). 
 

9.2.   EAST UZBOY 

The following description is modified from Hogg (2007) and Hogg (2008). 
 
Gold mineralisation occurs within southeast dipping altered andesite package, bounded by 
sediments. 
 
Anomalous gold mineralisation at a >0.2g/t Au boundary in the Uzboy East zone is currently 
interpreted to extend over a strike length of approximately 1km, and over a surface width of 
approximately 300m. 
 



 

 25

Mineralisation at East Uzboy is currently defined within two main zones in the southwest and 
northeast, which evidence suggests may well link to form one continuous zone of 
mineralisation with additional drill testing. 
 
Greater than 0.2g/t gold intercepts form a series of steep southeast dipping laterally extensive 
lodes or lenses typical of this style of structurally controlled mineralisation.  Current drilling 
defines up to five parallel laterally extensive sulphide lodes within each zone.  Mineralisation 
within the sulphide zone is interpreted down to between 250-350 metres below surface, 
depending upon drilling extents. 
 
In the upper, oxide part of the profile discreet lenses seen in the sulphide zone have 
undergone gold remobilisation resulting in the formation of broader >0.2g/t Au gold zones 
near surface (Figure 5). 
 
Mineralised zone 3 dimensional wireframes at East Uzboy as interpreted on cross section, are 
oriented in an approximate 055° direction (the approximate strike of the deposit), dipping 
steeply to the southeast (Figure 8 and 9). 
  
For both West and East mineralised 3 dimensional wireframes (WFM's) were interpreted 
separately for the oxide (oxide/transitional) and sulphide zones to best represent and honour 
the interpreted distribution of gold and the geometries of the +0.2g/t mineralisation in these 
parts of the profile. 
 
Base of oxidation and base of transitional DTM's (Digital Terrain Models) were interpreted 
using drill hole events file and geology data, snapped to drill hole interval and modelled to 
cover the extents of mineralisation (Figures 10 and 11).

10. EXPLORATION BY ALHAMBRA 

Section 11 summarises early exploration undertaken by Alhambra (Saga Creek Gold 
Company) and is modified from Comeau (2006) and Hogg (2007). 
 
In 1996, the Saga Creek Gold Company, under Cameco management, conducted an auger 
drilling program and gold grain analysis study over 3 km2 and 79 line kilometres of ground 
magnetic surveying in the Uzboy area. Seven trenches were developed and 4,719.7 metres of 
core drilling were completed in 21 holes focused primarily on the West Uzboy zone. 
 
An auger-drilling program consisting of 1,427 holes (7,499.8 metres) was conducted in an 
attempt to determine the extent of the gold mineralisation in the Uzboy area, which had been 
located in earlier drilling. The survey covered approximately 3 km2 with east-west grid lines 
spaced at 50 to 100 metres and samples were taken at 20 metre intervals. Anomalies initially 
located on the first pass were followed up in greater detail. 
 
Auger holes were drilled to depths of between 2 to 8 metres with an average of 5 metres. 
Samples were selected in the weathered crust mainly from the bottom of the hole. The number 
of samples collected from each hole was dependent on the characteristic features of the 
weathered crust – when homogeneous, one sample – where heterogeneous, every new horizon 
was sampled. 
 
Samples were usually 1.5 metres long and weights ranged from 4 to 7 kilograms. If visually 
observed mineralized material was augured, an additional 1.5 metre-long sample was 
collected for geochemical analysis. A total of 1,333 samples were collected during the 
program. 
 
The samples were concentrated by sieving to –2mm and then passed through a centrifugal 
separation unit capable of retaining gold grains in the 10-15 micron size fraction. The 
magnetic fraction of the sample was passed through a series of sieves (0.25mm to 0.044mm) 
and the resulting sample was examined for native gold grains. The number of grains per 
sample were normalized to a 5 kg sample and plotted. 
 
The sampling program outlined auriferous anomalies (>30 grains of gold/5 kg of sample) over 
the West Uzboy zone and several areas of altered weathered crust to the east at the presently 
defined East Uzboy zone. All anomalies tend to strike in a northeasterly direction. 
 
The anomaly over West Uzboy measured approximately 400 metres in length and up to 150 
metres in width. Four samples yielded results greater than 1,000 grains of gold per 5 kilogram 
of sample. The eastern area consists of several dislocated anomalies extending in a 
northeasterly direction for a distance of approximately 1 kilometre with an average width of 
200 metres. Five samples within this area yielded results greater than 1,000 grains of gold per 
5 kilograms of sample. Several other smaller isolated anomalies occur in the northern portion 
of the area surveyed. 
 
A total of 79 line kilometres of ground magnetics were completed on east-west lines with line 
spacing of 50 metres and station readings every 10 metres. Infill 25 metre lines were utilized 
over the eastern portion of the Uzboy prospect. A Russian-built analogue MMP-203 proton 
procession total field instrument with a sensitivity of 1 nT was utilized to collect the data. 
Diurnal corrections were made and the final plot generated. 
 
Total relief across the surveyed area is approximately 600 nT. The West Uzboy zone was 
found to be located in the northwest corner of an extensive magnetic low and the East Uzboy 



 

 33

zone can be seen along the northeastern portion of the same magnetic feature. Both zones 
appear to be associated with northeasterly-trending alignments within the magnetic low.  
In 1996, Saga Creek completed 7 exploration trenches (5 on East Uzboy and 2 on West 
Uzboy) for a total of 522 linear metres. The trenches were excavated along northwest - 
southeast trends more or less at right angles to the assumed northeasterly-striking mineralized 
zones as determined from the auger program. Trenches, dug by a rotary trenching machine are 
approximately 1.1 metres wide and 3 to 3.5 metres in depth. All trenches were geologically 
mapped and channel samples (5 x 10 cm channel) were collected along the wall at the bottom 
of each trench along surveyed intervals. The samples averaged 5 kilograms in weight per 
sample. A total of 517 samples were collected from the trenches for gold analyses. 
 
The trenching and auger drilling programs were followed-up by two diamond drilling 
programs, one in 1996 and a second in 1997. Saga Creek completed a total of 35 inclined and 
vertical diamond drill holes under Cameco management. 
 
Twenty-one (21) core holes were completed in 1996. Emphasis was placed on the West 
Uzboy zone (19 holes) and two holes were completed at the East Uzboy area. A total of 
4,719.7 metres were completed during the year. All drill holes were sampled along their entire 
lengths and analyzed for gold. The entire core from the oxide portions of the holes was 
submitted for assay. A total of 4,279 core samples were analyzed from this drilling program. 
Some of the better intercepts are listed in Table 9.3. 
 
Drill holes were completed on NW-SE sections from 50 to 100 metres apart. Several holes 
(20-100m) were completed on each section. Information collected from the drill core included 
lithology, structure, alteration, collar survey co-ordinates and down-hole deviation data. As in 
the Soviet days, many of the holes were vertical or steeply inclined. The results are reported 
as both drill core lengths and estimated true widths. 
 
In 1996 survey crews of the Stepnogorsk Geological Expedition established a survey grid 
system on the site. Surface topography mapping was completed in the immediate area of the 
Uzboy deposit with contour intervals of 2 metres developed. 
 
Surveyed stations were established at each of the surface trenches. The location of each trench 
sample was determined by measuring the distance along the trench from the survey station to 
the starting point of each sampled interval. 
 
The drilling program conducted by Saga Creek in 1996 was meant to test the validity of the 
original Soviet intersections and as an initial evaluation of both the lateral and vertical 
continuation of the gold-bearing zones. The program was successful in that two separate 
mineralized zones were located in the West Uzboy zone. Due to the limited number of drill 
holes, distances between holes, the steep inclination of many of the holes and the assumed 
near vertical nature of the mineralisation, continuity between mineralized intersections is 
difficult. 
 
Saga Creek continued its drill evaluation of the Uzboy prospect in 1997 but concentrated its 
efforts to the East Uzboy area, which had been identified as a result of the 1996 auger drilling 
and trenching, programs. Fourteen holes were completed for a total of 1,703.9 metres (1,924 
samples). Detailed assay results are listed in Appendix "D" of Report # 842.  
 
Core drill holes were completed on sections that ranged from 60 to 200 metres. Several holes 
(50 to 100 metres apart) were completed on some sections. As in 1996, entire lengths of holes 
were analyzed. 
 
The 1997 drilling campaign, restricted to the East Uzboy zone, did confirm the presence of a 
zone of gold mineralisation. Drill sections were quite widely spaced; however, gold 



 

 34

mineralisation, alteration and favourable host rocks were traced for a distance of nearly 700 
metres. As at West Uzboy, the trend is to the northeast.  
The 1996 and 1997 exploration efforts resulted in the partial delineation, both along strike and 
at depth, of numerous narrow, gold-bearing, sheared and fracture-filled zones of quartz-
carbonate veinlets within dacitic and andesitic rocks. The gold mineralisation was generally 
centered along zones of intense shearing and fracturing containing quartz and carbonate plus 
pyrite. A large beresitic alteration envelope encompasses the area of mineralisation commonly 
carrying low-grade gold values contained within fine disseminated hydrothermal pyrite. 
 
During 2001, Saga Creek (now funded by the new partner Alhambra) focused its efforts 
exclusively on the shallow (± 50 metres), oxide potential of the mineralized zones and 
carried-out a trenching program consisting of 14 trenches (11 in West Uzboy and 3 in East 
Uzboy) for a total of 2,235.5 linear metres (9,759.9 m3). A total of 1,556 samples were 
collected from the trenches for gold analyses. In addition, a total of 45 inclined reverse 
circulation drill holes (KΓK) were completed in the West Uzboy area totaling 1,081.3 metres 
and 526 samples were collected from these holes). All samples were fire assayed for their 
gold content at the Central Laboratory of the Central Kazakhstan Territorial Department 
("Centergeoanalit"). 
 
The programs were carried-out in an attempt to more precisely define and extend the zones of 
oxide mineralisation outlined during the previous years' exploration efforts. A better 
understanding of the geometry of the zones was now known and the focus of the exploration 
program would be on the potentially heap-leachable portions of the mineralisation intersected 
in both the oxide and transitional portions of the zones. 
 
The trenching program was successful in both the West Uzboy and East Uzboy zones and 
managed to extend the strike length of the mineralisation in both areas. Continuity of the 
mineralized zones between prior trenching and drilling programs was enhanced. Both 
trenching and reverse circulation drilling was completed at near right angles to the interpreted 
strike direction of the mineralisation and, although distances between trenches were large, 
ranging from 40 to 160 metres, general interpretations were made as to the shapes and 
directions of the mineralized zones. 
 
KΓK reverse circulation drilling (program now funded by Alhambra) was restricted to the 
West Uzboy zone and proved locally useful in defining the gold mineralisation. 
 
Ten additional reverse circulation holes in the southwest corner of this zone (up to 170 metres 
to the southwest from Trench #8) failed to intersect significant gold values. 
 
During 2002 Saga Creek (funded by Alhambra) conducted an extensive exploration program 
on the Uzboy West prospect. The work consisted of reverse circulation drilling (air blast - 
recovering rock chips) and trenching. As of December 27, 2002, 478 vertical reverse 
circulation drill holes were completed for a total of 7, 174 metres from which every two metre 
interval was collected and analyzed for gold (3,587 samples). The program was an attempt to 
test for the continuity and to more precisely define the boundaries of the oxide gold 
mineralisation outlined by earlier exploration programs. All exploration activity was restricted 
to the Uzboy West area. OAO Azimut Energy Services of Karaganda, Kazakhstan carried out 
a topographic survey of the area, a hydro-geological study and geotechnical work on some of 
the core. 
 
The drilling program was generally completed on sections 20 metres apart (locally sections 
were spaced at 40 metre intervals) with collar locations at 5 metre intervals along sections. 
The depth of the holes varied as penetration was restricted by the water table and hardness of 
the rock. The average depth of the holes was 15 metres with the deepest penetration being 32 



 

 35

metres. The drilling did not intersect the full thickness of the oxide zone, which has been 
determined to be approximately 50 metres. 
Three trenches were completed to the immediate east of West Uzboy for a total of 192 metres 
from which 182 samples were collected for analyses. The trenching program did locate an 
additional zone of gold mineralisation approximately 50 metres to the southeast of the main 
West Uzboy area. The best mineralized zone width obtained was 40 metres with an average 
grade of 0.65 g Au/t. 
 
Based on the results of the KΓK reverse circulation drilling and past exploration activity, 
Saga Creek commenced stripping the area on the Uzboy West prospect (previously defined as 
Zone # 3) in July 2002. Stripping of the zone was is response to a Kazakhstani law that 
requires the mineralized zone to be channel-sampled at 10 metre intervals along its strike. 
Due to the expected depth of the trenches necessary to carry-out this program it was deemed 
more efficient and cheaper to remove the overlying overburden, clay and upper leached 
portions of the upper oxide zone than to construct timbered trenches. 
 
Stripping was performed to a depth of 5 metres along a length of approximately 250 metres 
and ranged from 35 to 95 metres in width. The width of the zone ranged from 35 to 95 metres. 
To that date 49,800 m3 of waste (<0.5 g Au/t) and topsoil and 54,500 tonnes of mineralized 
rock (>0.5 g Au/t) were removed and placed in individual 12 tonne piles (each individual 
truckload is approximately 12 tonnes) on surface. 
 
Saga Creek collected channel samples for analyses along the pit floor. Channels were 
constructed at approximately 10 metre intervals for the entire length of the pit for a total of 
1,420.5 metres. From these channels 1,411 samples were collected and analyzed for gold 
content.  
 
A total of 5,180 analyses were performed in 2002 on the Uzboy West site (excluding analyses 
performed on the material removed from the pit). Reactive Laboratories in Stepnogorsk 
utilizing the Atomic Absorption method performed all assay work carried-out in 2002. All 
remaining pulp samples from the work carried-out in 2002 are kept in storage at the Reactive 
facility. 
 
All work completed on the Uzboy gold project in 2002 was performed in order to comply 
with Kazakhstan's mining regulations. 
 
In 2002, the Zone 3 (West Uzboy) ore was stripped of topsoil and overburden as part of the 
first bench (220m elevation).  By the end of 2004 mining had reached the 215m bench and ore 
was being moved to the pads from both the pit and stockpiles.  By August 2005 Alhambra had 
reached the 210m level.  Details of the test mining and heap leach test and plant construction 
are presented in Comeau (2006). 
 
From 2003 – 2005 Alhambra undertook an aggressive diamond core drilling program at both 
West and East Uzboy mineralised zones.  This work was carried out in order to obtain CIM 
compatible resources and reserves and upgrade existing resources. 
 
The 2003 diamond drilling program was mainly conducted upon the West Uzboy deposit and 
in addition to the RAB holes drilled during the same period was designed to better delineate 
oxide mineralisation.  34 DDH holes were drilled at West Uzboy during 2003 for a total of 
1309.5 metres. 
 
The main focus of the 2004 program was the RAB drilling; trenching and core drilling 
programs on the East Uzboy deposit, testing the oxide transitional and top 30 metres of the 
primary zone.  34 DDH holes were drilled for a total of 2,897.3 metres. 



 

 36

Resource and reserve estimations completed by Howe as part of the Feasibility Study on the 
Uzboy Gold Project, 2006 (Howe Report #896) utilised all Alhambra, Cameco and Soviet era 
data up to 31st December 2004.  The top 4 metres only of the (KΓK) RAB drilling was 
utilised in the interpolation process. 
 
Exploration in 2005 and 2006 programs was designed to evaluate the primary gold 
mineralisation that occurs below the oxide and transitional zones at both West and East 
Uzboy. 
 
Up to 31 December 2006 a further 64 diamond drill holes were drilled at West Uzboy for a 
total of 16,257.3 metres.  An additional 378 pit channels have been cut down to the 200m 
bench at West Uzboy. 
 
For the same period an additional 19 diamond drill holes for 6164.7 metres, and an additional 
27 trenches and 113 pit channels, down to 215m level. 
 
By end of 2006 mining of the oxide material at West Uzboy had reached the 200mRL level, 
and at East Uzboy mining had reached the 215mRL level. 
 
During 2007 Alhambra completed additional diamond drilling and pit channel sampling at 
West Uzboy and additional pit channel sampling at East Uzboy.  A further 29 diamond drill 
holes for total of 8739 metres and 99 pit channels for a total 5692.39 metres were achieved at 
West Uzboy, and 162 pit channels for a total of 7324 metres at East Uzboy.  Figures 12 and 
13 show historic and 2007 exploration data for the Uzboy deposit. 
 
Mining during the same period up to 31 December 2007 took the West Uzboy pit to the 
195mRL level and East Uzboy to the 210mRL level.

11. BLOCK MODEL INPUT DATA SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

The following section is taken from Hogg 2008. 

11.1. DATA SUMMARY 

Raw data used in modelling estimation consists of data from diamond drilling, trench, surface 
channel and pit channel samples, from historical Soviet era, Cameco and recent Alhambra 
exploration campaigns up to 31 December 2007.  Onsite reviews and report review suggests 
the drilling techniques, channel and pit sampling methodologies to be of a satisfactory 
standard.  
 
Detailed review of findings pertaining to the exploration input data are presented in the report 
sections below and issues regarding the suitability of this data for inclusion in current and 
future resource estimates discussed in the Conclusions and Recommendations section of this 
report.  A summary of sample type for the Uzboy deposits are contained in Table 7 below;

TABLE 7. UZBOY SAMPLE TYPES 
 
A summary of the complete database made available for the Uzboy deposits are presented in 
Appendix 2. 
 
Methodologies and approach for historical and pre-2005 Saga Creek sampling is well 
documented in Comeau et al, 2006 and considered of suitable standard.  Description is made 
here of methodologies applied to recent sampling conducted by Alhambra (Saga Creek), as 
observed during December 2006 site visits and following project data review. 
 
Current drilling methodologies and methodologies for current and previously dug channels 
and trenches have been inspected by Howe.  In general the techniques employed and 
described by site personnel for each of these data collection methods are considered sound 
and reliable. 
 
Notes on the site visit undertaken by Howe between the 12th and 15th December 2006, 
undertaken to inspect current data collection methodologies are presented for reference in 
Appendix 3. 
 
The following sections 12.1.1 to 12.1.8 are modified from Hogg (2007). 
 



 

 40

11.1.1. DRILL HOLE DATA 

Drilling is by DDH method.  The majority of drilling and sample recovery has been by 
conventional NQ core method. 
NQ drill core is retrieved in 3m runs (less where broken ground is encountered), carefully 
handled by the drillers and placed in 2.5 metre wooden core boxes of good fit.  The drillers 
may be required to break the core to fit the length of the box.  Drillers blocks were placed in 
the core boxes at the completion of each core run and down hole depths given in metres (m). 
 
Drill core is not oriented. Given the current depth and strike extents of deposit model Howe 
does not consider this a critical issue. However, as development continues to greater depths 
oriented drill core will become critical in directing exploration interpreting direction and 
correlation of mineralised zones for resource modelling. 
 
At the drill site, core is summary logged and then boxed for transportation to Stepnogorsk for 
processing, logging and sampling.   
 
Once summary logging is done, core trays are secured.  Core movement is minimised by the 
size of the tray core channel, and tight fitting wooden lid. 
 
No geotechnical/geomechanical logging is taking place on site, and although core recoveries 
are reported to be very good overall (average 99%), it is best practice to perform orientation 
marking, metre marking, recovery and RQD logging, prior to transportation.  Transportation 
of the core could result in the disintegration of less competent zones (which generally tend to 
be those of greatest interest). 
 
This sampling methodology is considered good practise in this type of gold deposit and is 
suitable for gaining a detailed understanding of lithological host rocks and controls of 
mineralisation. 
 
The geologist metre marks the core and sample intervals. Drill core sample intervals average 
approximately 1m through the mineralised zone (2m outside zone). Once samples were 
chosen, half core samples were cut lengthways by diamond saw and bagged in calico bags 
with a sample number slip placed in the bag with the sample number written on the outside of 
the bag.  Discussion with site personnel confirmed that half of the core was sampled without 
the use of an orientation reference line for all holes.  The position of the cut line is therefore 
random and inconsistent.  In areas of broken/disaggregated core a knife and/or spoon was 
used to best sample half the core. 
 
One half of the drill core is retained in the box for reference. 
 

11.1.2. PIT CHANNEL DATA 

Pit channel samples are taken by cutting a 10cm wide x 3.5cm deep slot on the surface 
perpendicular to strike of mineralisation.  1m samples are taken over from-to intervals along 
the length of the channel.  Approximately 6kg of sample is taken per 1m interval. 
 
Channels were inspected and it is Howe's opinion that these channel sampling techniques are 
consistent, accurate and adequate. 
 



 

 41

11.1.3. TRENCH DATA 

Trenches are excavated perpendicular to strike of mineralisation using specialised machinery 
resulting in a channel 0.8-1.0m wide x 2.5m deep.  Channels of same dimensions as the Pit 
Channels are cut 30cm above base of trench for sample collection.  Chip samples are taken at 
1m intervals and trenches geologically logged.  
 
Trenches were inspected by Howe and sampling protocol discussed with site personnel and 
considered satisfactory. 

11.1.4. GEOLOGICAL LOGGING 

Discussion with site personnel and a review of geological logging procedures and log sheets 
indicates that detailed geological logging was routinely undertaken during drilling. 
 
Observations of site logging procedures appear thorough and consistent. 
 
At the drill site, core is summary logged and then boxed for transportation to Stepnogorsk for 
processing, logging and sampling.   
 
Drill hole logging is recorded on hardcopy graphical logging sheets and capture pertinent 
geological information for each deposit including lithology, weathering, facies, texture, 
structure, mineralogy, colour, and grain size as well as presenting a graphic log. Site specific 
information such as relevant ore types and alteration assemblage characteristics are being 
recorded.  Howe is satisfied the logging is consistent and conducted to a high standard. 
 
Geological information recorded as hand written sheets is then transferred to excel 
spreadsheets, and cross checked with the original sheets and validated by the Project 
Geologist. 
 
Basic geotechnical core recovery information was recorded on the logging sheets for all drill 
holes, including weathering state and oxidation boundaries.  These were entered on to hand 
written sheets and then entered into an excel spreadsheet and validated against the original 
logs by the Project Geologist.  No RQD measurements are being taken. 
 
The geotechnical logs do capture basic geotechnical information but discussion and 
inspection of core at the core yard suggests that none of the core is orientated (due to the 
presence of highly fractured zones) and as such the orientations of potentially important fault 
and fracture sets remains unknown. As the core is not oriented no core orientation line 
referenced structural measurements have been taken. 
 

11.1.5. SURVEY 

Accurate topographical and data surveys are taken by site surveyors using theodolites, and 
referenced to the numerous trigopunks (survey monuments) situated locally and throughout 
the steppes.  Survey accuracy using these methods is considered to be very good.  Drill rigs, 
trenches and channels are 'sighted' and pegged by surveyors using this method. 
 
Digital 1m contour topographic maps were produced for the Uzboy property and were 
subsequently used to generate topographical DTM's in Micromine for use in modelling. 
 
DDH downhole survey measurements have been taken for all Saga Creek drilling.  Downhole 
surveys were taken on average every 10 metres for each hole by geophysical method. 
 



 

 42

Howe is satisfied with the accuracy of survey data supported by the Micromine survey 
validation completed as part of the estimation process. 
 

11.1.6. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

Historical sample preparation analysis and security is well documented in Comeau et al, 
2006. 
 
Samples generated as part of the 2005 and 2006 campaigns are assigned a number on the 
geological logging sheet, which are carried over to the sample record sheet for dispatch to the 
lab.  QAQC samples are introduced at the sample batch dispatch stage, and listed on the 
sample record sheet.  QAQC samples use a separate sample number sequence to routine 
samples.  The issue with this method of including QAQC samples is that it allows the lab to 
identify the control samples, increasing the risk of 'sample spotting' and possible analytical 
fraud. 
 
Sampling is performed to a reasonable standard, and the method of cutting core is good.  
However, due to the non-orientation of the drill core, inconsistencies are introduced into the 
system.  Without orientation line control, the core will be sampled randomly along its axis, 
and may well introduce bias to the samples.  Best practice is to sample along the core 
orientation line thus being consistent and selecting a sample perpendicular to the perceived 
strike of mineralisation and mineralised veins etc. 
 
Samples generated as part of the 2005 and 2006 campaigns followed previously established 
routines and were first dispatched to Reactive Laboratories, Stepnogorsk for sample 
preparation, and primary analysis by Atomic Absorption (AAS) method.  First pass AAS is 
then followed up Fire Assay for AAS samples of greater than 0.1g/t Au completed at 
Centergeoanalit laboratory in Karaganda.  Fire Assay is done from an approximate 200g 
sample taken from sample pulps.  These samples are prepared at the logging/sample dispatch 
facility in Stepnogorsk. Assay techniques are well understood and considered good. 
 
Detailed laboratory methodologies are further documented in the previous Howe report by 
Comeau et al, 2006. 
 
The method used for the pulp sampling was reviewed, and involved the partial 
homogenisation of the sample prior to collection by spoon.  Although considered adequate, 
improvements to the method of re-sampling, to obtain a more representative sample and 
eliminate risk of contamination, would be to use a riffle splitter. It has been demonstrated that 
a significant amount of gold at the Uzboy deposit is present in association with sulphide 
species. This sulphide material has a tendency to settle at the base of sample pulps and may 
not be represented in the resulting sample sent for fire assay, and as such the grade of 
resulting fire assay analysis may be understating the gold grade. 
 
Results are received from the labs via email and hardcopy certificate. 
 
Sample dispatch routines, and dispatch record sheets were observed and considered consistent 
and of high standard. 
 
Sample security protocols were discussed with site personnel and demonstrated to Howe 
during the project site visit.  These are considered entirely satisfactory. 
 



 

 43

11.1.7. CORE RECOVERY 

At West Uzboy, core recovery is reported to average 99% for all drill core measurements 
(21739).  Interval recovery measurements range from 33% to 100%.  Howe performed a 
review and checks of recovery logging data and considers this overall figure satisfactory. 
 
At East Uzboy, core recovery is also reported to average 99% for all drill core measurements 
(7230).  Interval recovery measurements range from 1% to 100%.  Howe performed a review 
and checks of recovery logging data and considers this overall figure satisfactory. 
 
Within the >0.2g/t Au mineralised zones average core recovery is 99% for both West and East 
Uzboy, with recovery ranges of 70%-100% and 50%-100% respectively.  
 
Core recovery on the whole was generally acceptable however detailed study on variability of 
sample recovery by ore type has not been performed and is recommended to better evaluate 
any potential ore and gold recovery issues. 
 
Further investigation should be conducted upon recovery versus grade within the mineralised 
domains in order to better identify any issues relating to recoveries through the ore zone and 
increase confidence in the nature and recovery characteristics of those intervals and how 
representative the gold values are. 
 

11.1.8. BULK DENSITY 

A total of 407 and 630 samples of core were collected from drill holes at West and East 
Uzboy respectively to facilitate bulk density determination for use in to the resource estimate.  
A review of samples taken, indicate a good spatial distribution, variety of ore types and 
oxidation zones. 
 
Specific gravity of each sample was calculated by measuring the volumetric displacement of 
the rock in water/paraffin and dividing the weight of rock by the volume. 
 
Bulk Density data for the Uzboy project is summarised in Table 8.

12. PROJECT QAQC 

The following sections are taken from Hogg 2008. 
 
Quality assurance and quality control review and analysis has been undertaken on all Uzboy 
data through the review of existing quality control data and extensive data verification 
programs.  Two programs of independent data verification were undertaken by Comeau in 
February 2002 and December 2002.  It is quoted in the Uzboy feasibility report that "it is 
Howe's opinion that the weighted averages for the collected samples yield a favourable 
comparison to the original sample results", Comeau et al, 2006.  Full details for the historical 
QAQC analyses and data verification are provided in that report.  
 
A comparison study of Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AA) versus Fire Assay (FA) sample 
analysis was completed during the December 2002 verification program.  It was found that of 
the 805 duplicate samples, 78% display an absolute difference of greater that 20%, while 50% 
of duplicate results show an absolute difference of 50% (Comeau et al, 2006). Howe 
concluded that fire assay technique be utilized in the upcoming resource drilling for greater 
accuracy of analysis and greater confidence in representative value.  This observation has 
been made on review of recent assay data and detailed below. 
 
At the beginning of 2003 Howe established rigorous QAQC protocol consisting of the 
insertion of standards blank and duplicate samples. Approximately 25% of all samples 
submitted to the laboratory were quality control samples. Following assessment of this control 
data during the feasibility study completed in 2006 Howe were satisfied that the assay 
database for the Uzboy property is sufficiently sound to be utilised in a resource/reserve 
study. 
 
QAQC data for all Uzboy exploration campaigns since 2003 have been provided for review 
and are discussed below. Procedural documentation pertaining to sample collection, field 
preparation, sample dispatch, assay lab sample preparation, sample analysis and collation of 
assay results was presented and reviewed prior to resource estimation.  
 

12.1. PULP DUPLICATE SAMPLES 

All samples generated as part of the recent drilling program undertaken at the Uzboy deposit 
have been assayed for gold using the atomic absorption spectrometry assay method AA at 
Reactive Laboratories or Quartz Branch Lab. Internal duplicates were taken and reanalysed 
using AA Internal duplicates account for up to 3% of all samples. External duplicates are also 
taken and sent to Centergeoanalit Laboratory for AA analysis. External duplicates account for 
3% of all samples. 
 
In instances where Reactive Laboratories or Quartz Branch Lab AA assays are >0.1 ppm 
samples are analysed by fire assay Centergeoanalit Labs. At this stage CRM's were 
introduced to the sample chain for analysis at Centergeoanalit. Internal control duplicates 
were then re-assayed at Reactive Lab using FA Internal duplicates account for up to 3% of all 
Centergeoanalit fire assay samples. External duplicates were sent to either Kazmechanobr or 
SGS XRAL-Toronto for a further round of fire assays. A review of assay data indicates that in 
practice not all samples >0.1ppm Au have been re-assayed via the fire assay method.  
 
The criteria for taking control duplicates for internal checking and external checking at 
Kazmekhanobr.and SGS Toronto is not known. Due to varying population sizes and 



 

 45

inconsistent use of laboratories it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions on the 
repeatability of assay populations across all the laboratories.  
 
Internal and external duplicate QAQC data for the 2003-2007 diamond drilling campaigns 
does not specify which labs were used for AA or external duplicate analysis, making analysis 
of population trends or bias of drill hole data between specific labs impossible. It is 
considered that the bulk AA data consists of Reactive Lab AA assays; therefore the other labs 
which have undertaken a much smaller amount of AA analysis have not been included in this 
study.    
 
Where internal and external duplicate data has been provided, the variation in mean assay 
results for each paired assay population is shown in terms of the Reactive Lab AA gold values 
(Table 9) and in terms of Centergeoanalit FA gold values (Table 10). Paired internal and 
external duplicate assay is also presented in Scatter plots, which show the linear regression of 
the two paired populations. Q-Q plots were also generated which present the comparative 
distribution of external duplicate assay values for each population as a whole.

12.1.1. INTERNAL DUPLICATES  

Assessment of Reactive Lab AA results versus Reactive internal control results show 
there is a clear correlation between paired samples indicated by a good R2 coefficient of 
0.9439 indicating that there is good repeatability of Reactive Lab AA assay values. The 
percentage deviation of the overall mean values of the two populations (-0.5%) indicates that 
there is no bias between original and duplicate assays. However, analysis of the percentage 
deviation between paired assays show that only 20% of duplicate pairs show percentage 
deviations between +/- 10%, indicating a low degree of precision particularly at low grades, 
below 1 ppm and at very high grades, above 25ppm.

For Centergeoanalit internal duplicates a strong linear trend is noted between original and 
duplicate assay results. There is a strong correlation coefficient of 0.9732 indicating good 
repeatability of Centergeoanalit F.A results. This is also reflected in the overall mean for the 
two populations of results which are equal at 4.09ppm Au.  Analysis of the percentage 
deviation between paired assay data shows that 57% of duplicate pairs show percentage 
deviations within +/- 10%. This indicates a relatively high degree of repeatability and 
precision across all grade ranges, in the Centergeoanalit Labs FA technique.

A comparison of Centergeoanalit FA results against Reactive Lab AA assays indicates 
that there is a strong R2 correlation coefficient of 0.9476. However there is shown a bias 
towards underreporting of paired Centergeoanalit Lab F.A assay results relative to Reactive 
AA assays at all grades. This is reflected in a percentage deviation of the overall mean values 
of the two populations of 7.44%, amounting to 0.28ppm between the mean F.A population 
(3.48ppm) values and AA (3.76ppm).

12.1.2. EXTERNAL CONTROL DUPLICATES  

Assessment of Reactive Lab AA results versus Centergeoanalit AA results shows there is a 
clear correlation between paired samples indicated by a good R2 coefficient of 0.9474 
indicating that there is good repeatability of Reactive Lab AA assay values. There is a 
percentage deviation between the overall mean values of the two populations of 5.32, 
indicating a bias to over reporting of paired Reactive Lab AA assay results relative to 
Centergeoanalit AA assays at all grades, particularly below 1.5 g/t. This is reflected in a 
percentage deviation of the overall mean values of the two populations of 5.32%, amounting

to 0.06 ppm between the mean Reactive AA population values (1.12 g/t) and the duplicate 
AA population (1.06 g/t).

Comparison of Reactive Lab AA results and duplicate pulp sample SGS Toronto FA 
results shows a good correlation coefficient of 0.9744, indicating that there is good 
repeatability of Reactive Lab AA assay values at SGS Toronto by FA method of 
determination. The percentage deviation of the overall mean values of the two populations is 
6.57% indicating a bias towards over-reporting of paired Reactive Lab AA assay results 
relative to SGS Toronto AA assays at all grades, particularly above 2.5 g/t. This is clearly 
seen in the Q-Q plot below.

A comparison of Centergeoanalit FA results against SGS Duplicate FA assays indicates 
that there is a strong correlation coefficient. The percentage deviation of the overall mean

Lab A.A assay results relative to SGS Toronto. However, due to the limited number of sample 
pairs it is not possible to confirm overall trends. Centergeoanalit FA assays have been 
compared with all external duplicates from Kazmechanobr Labs and SGS Toronto. The Q-Q

12.2. STANDARD SAMPLES 

Certified Reference Material samples were prepared from mineral matrices that contain gold 
which is uniformly distributed throughout the pulverized rock. Standard statistical techniques 
are used to assign a recommended gold value with associated 95% confidence interval. 
CRM's were prepared by Gannet Holdings Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary of SGS, Perth, Australia, a 
recognised supplier of high quality reference material to the mining industry. 
 
CRM samples were routinely submitted for assaying with core to test laboratory accuracy. 
CRM's were included in sample batches sent to the Centergeoanalit laboratory for fire 
assaying, during the 2005/2006 campaigns at a ratio of up to 3:16 core samples. A variety of 
CRM's were used, representing high and low gold grades, and oxide and sulphide ore. From 
19 different CRM's, a total of 158 CRM check samples have been submitted for assaying. 
The statistical characteristics of the sample population of each type are given in Table 11 
below.

(47.72%). The majority, 44.88% of assay results have deviations below the -10% tolerance

ACA Howe QAQC data assessment findings indicate that there is a lower reporting of 
standard values, which appears to be present across all grades. The population histogram of

Assessment of the CRM plots indicate that despite the overall under reporting of CRM 
grades, the overall distribution of CRM values seem to be reasonably well constrained, 
indicating that there is a good degree of precision in assay results. If the % deviation from the 
mean value of retuned results for each sample is measured 70% of all CRM assays fall with in 
+/- 10%. 
 
Potential under reporting in FA results was identified in the ACA Howe Report "Preliminary 
Assessment Report on the Uzboy Gold Project" as being a concern. CRM material was 
introduced into the sample chain after Reactive AA analysis and therefore CRM values will 
only provide information regarding the Centergeoanalit FA analysis. To gain maximum value 
from the inclusion of standard samples, in order to both monitor the sample preparation and 
analytical process for both AA and FA assay methods they should be introduced in the field. 
 

12.3. PULP BLANKS 

Low Grade CRM samples with a grade of 0.003ppm were used as blank samples. CRM 
standard samples these were submitted after AA analysis. Of the 256 blank samples 
submitted, none returned a value greater than the Centergeoanalit FA lower detection limit of 
0.1ppm. This indicates that contamination of samples during assaying or errors in sample 
numbering do not seem to be an issue.  
 
To get an indication of possible contamination and introduction of errors in the field 
collection, transport and sample preparation stages, blank samples should be introduced in the 
field prior to submission to the laboratories.

12.4. ANALYSIS OF AA AND FA EXPLORATION ASSAY DATA 

All samples generated as part of the recent drilling program undertaken at the Uzboy deposit 
have been assayed for gold using the atomic absorption spectrometry assay method (AA). 
QA/QC procedures reviewed as part of the site visit indicate that samples that returned gold 
assay >0.1ppm Au were then re-assayed using the fire assay method (FA). In practise 
however, a review of assay data indicates that not all samples >0.1ppm Au have been re-
assayed via the fire assay method, indeed some samples <0.2ppm Au have fire assay data. 
 
A breakdown of total AA sample numbers versus total FA sample numbers for West and East 
Uzboy are presented in Table 12 below.

Prior to statistical analysis of AA versus FA assay data, a filter was applied to remove all AA 
assays for which no FA data is present and assays returned that are less than the detection 
limit for both AA and FA samples were also been removed (1806 for West Uzboy and 1124 
for East Uzboy). 
 
Univariate descriptive statistics was run on the AA and FA duplicate sample data for West 
and East Uzboy.  Key summary statistics are presented in Table 13 below.

TABLE 13.  UZBOY AA VERSUS FA STATISTICS SUMMARY 
 
Descriptive statistical analysis of AA versus FA indicates an overall slight over-reporting with 
AA sample analysis when compared to Centergeoanalit FA analysis. 
 
Scatter plots of duplicate data are shown in the scatter graph figures below. Linear trends are 
noted and the correlation coefficient for West and East Uzboy is 0.91 and 0.93 respectively.  
Interpretation of the graphs indicate that at there is generally good correlation overall however 
both deposits a bias exists and that AA assay results are generally higher than fire assay 
results at the higher grade ranges (>2ppm Au). At lower grade ranges (<2ppm Au) there 
appears to be a very close correlation between AA and FA results.

12.5. CONCLUSIONS OF QAQC ASSESSMENT  

The review of sampling and assaying procedures indicates that an adequate system has been 
designed to maximise the quality of drill hole samples and to assess the reliability, accuracy 
and precision of subsequent assay data for use in resource estimation. 
 
Samples were analysed for gold via AA at the Chemical and Analytical Laboratory Reactive, 
which is certified in the Republic of Kazakhstan but does not have an International Standard 
Organization rating. The analysis of AA samples returning >0.1ppm Au , done by fire assay at 
an internationally accredited laboratory is considered best practice, however it is clear from 
this QA/QC Analysis that there is overall under reporting of CRM's by the fire assay method.  
 
Linear comparisons between the Centergeoanalit FA assays, Reactive Lab AA assays and 
external FA assays observed in duplicate assays, indicates slight under-reporting of 
Centergeoanalit FA assays.  The mean percentage deviation between the populations of 
Centergeoanalit Lab FA against external SGS Toronto Lab FA duplicate assays is -10.467% 
which supports the -10.657% total mean percentage deviation of all CRM grades. 
 
External duplicate analysis indicates the use of Centergeoanalit FA data in resource 
estimation is likely to understate the overall grade of each deposit, across grades above 
0.1ppm by up to 10%. Where only AA data is available the grade may be overstated by up to 
approximately 6% as demonstrated in duplicate sample assessment, however as CRM's were 
not introduced prior to AA assaying, this can not be demonstrated with absolute certainty.  
Despite this potential under-reporting, it is recognised that fire assays have a much higher 
precision and are less likely to produce highly anomalous or erroneous values. 
 
It is evident that on the whole, samples analysed by AA have returned results higher than the 
duplicate fire assay.  This assessment is supported by the comparison studies undertaken on 
the AA and FA sample data. 
 
36% and 26% of AA assays have been re-assayed by fire assay from West and East Uzboy 
respectively.  This converts to 50% and 29% of AA assays being re-assayed by FA method 
within the interpreted >0.2g/t Au mineralised zones for West and East Uzboy respectively.    
 
Despite adequate QA/QC systems being implemented ACA Howe not currently received any 
Field Blanks or Field Duplicates or CRM's inserted prior to sample preparation. It is 
important that this field data is made available for analysis to improve the assessment of assay 
analytical processes and provide greater means for assessing the reliability of assay results 
and locating possible errors in sample analysis.  
 
Although analysis of the different assay data and methodologies suggests that both sets of 
data are compatible for use in resource estimation, the fact that only check analysis by SGS 
Chemex umpire laboratory is internationally accredited.  Actual AA and FA data is not 
internationally certified, only certified to Kazakhstan standards and although considered 
acceptable this should be borne in mind when assigning a resource classification under CIM 
guidelines and recommendations for improved estimation practices. 
 

12.6. ASSAY LABORATORY 

Samples are analysed for gold via AAS at the Reactive and Chemical and Analytical 
Laboratory Quartz LLP in Stepnogorsk and Semipalatinsk which is certified in the Republic 
of Kazakhstan but does not have an International Standard Organization rating. The analysis 
of AAS samples returning >0.1ppm Au, by fire assay at Centergeoanalit laboratory in 
Karaganda. Centergeoanalit which is also certified in the Republic of Kazakhstan but does not

have an International Standard Organization rating, however has received substantial 
favourable verification listing through SGS Laboratory in Toronto (Comeau et al, 2006).  
SGS XRAL Toronto is used as an internationally accredited umpire laboratory. Laboratory 
certificates are presented in Appendix 4. 
 

12.7. DATA VERIFICATION 

Howe did not undertake new data verification sampling and analysis for the purpose of the 
31/12/07 update of resource estimations. Verification check sampling to confirm assay grades 
was performed during site visit undertaken December 2006. 
   

12.7.1. PREVIOUS DATA VERIFICATION 

The following section is taken from Hogg (2007). 
 
Whilst undertaking the Uzboy site in December 2006, Howe supervised the collection of 21 
pulps of sampled half core from West and East Uzboy drill core samples for independent 
check analysis.  Samples were submitted to OMAC laboratories, Co Galway, Ireland for gold 
analysis.  Sample preparation and analysis was selected to represent both AA and FA analysis 
that was undertaken on original Saga Creek samples.  Results returned for both the AA and 
FA check sample analysis is considered satisfactory.  Duplicate check samples show a 
reasonable correlation coefficient of 0.9985 and 0.9802 for FA and AA respectively.  Table 
15 below summarises the Howe check sample analysis.

13. ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

Alhambra is developing a number of prospects within proximity to the Uzboy operation. 
 
The Dombraly project is located in the Sary-Arka License (with serial number MG #1029-D) 
approximately 80 kilometres to the southeast of the Uzboy gold deposit. The Uzboy gold 
deposit is located in the Uzboy License (with serial number MG #719DD). These two licenses 
make up the Uzboy Project.  The Dombraly deposit is located approximately 60 kilometres 
north of the city of Stepnogorsk, Kazakhstan. Stepnogorsk is Alhambra's operating base for 
its Uzboy mine. 
 
Exploration including diamond drilling and the "bulk test" are planned on the oxide zone of 
gold mineralisation at the former Dombraly open pit mine (Alhambra, 2008c) 
  
The potential target in the oxide zone at Dombraly that is the focus of the proposed 
exploration program could range from 5 to 7 million tonnes with gold grades ranging from 
1.40 grams per tonne ("g/t") to 1.80 g/t (Alhambra, 2008c). 
 
The above potential quantities and grades of the exploration target are conceptual in nature (as 
set out by National Instrument 43-101). To date there has been insufficient exploration to 
define a mineral resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being 
delineated as a mineral resource (Alhambra, 2008c). 
 
The Shirotnaia zone is one of the advanced drilling targets within Alhambra's 100% owned, 
2.7 million acre, Uzboy Project area located in north central Kazakhstan.   
 
A deep geochemical survey using Reverse Air Blast ("RAB") drilling was completed in the 
fourth quarter of 2007 to the southwest and northeast of the previously announced gold 
discovery at the Shirotnaia zone. This has resulted in the discovery of two linear gold 
anomalies located northwest of KazakhGold Group Limited's ("KazakhGold's") Aksu and 
Quartzite Hills gold deposits. A second deep geochemical survey was also completed 
approximately 800 metres ("m") northeast of the Shirotnaia gold discovery when the 
Corporation announced a successful drilling program whereby 17 of 18 diamond drill holes 
intersected gold mineralisation (Alhambra 2008a). 
 
2008 bedrock geochemical sampling program within the Shirotnaia area identified three new 
gold anomalies located approximately 6 kilometres east of the main Shorotnaia discovery 
(Alhambra, 2008d) 
 
Further development of Shirotnaia and the Kirtoge zone located approximately 15 kilometres 
north east of the Uzboy deposit continues. 
 
A total of 21 DDHs (2809.9 m) were recently completed over a strike length of 440 m to test 
a broad zone of oxide gold mineralisation located by trenching and RAB drilling in 2005 and 
2006 (Alhambra, 2008b). 
 
The analytical results from the Kirtoge zone show wide intervals of low-grade gold 
mineralisation (less than 0.4 g/t) and narrow intervals of greater than 0.5 g/t gold. The average 
gold grades intersected by the diamond drilling are similar to the trenching and Reverse Air 
Blast ("RAB") drilling results outlined in 2005 and 2006 (Alhambra, 2008b)

14. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

Mineral processing and metallurgical data for oxide material is gathered as part of the mining 
operation which commenced mid-2003.  Oxide gold recovery figures of 70% are provided to 
Howe from pit design figures. The actual recoveries since inception have been 71% leached 
and 69% stripped. These recoveries include ramping up to steady state conditions and 
ongoing operations. 
 
Recent metallurgical test work on oxide and transitional material types has been undertaken 
by Kazmekhanobr Laboratory, Almaty, Kazakhstan.  Details of the results of work provided 
to Howe by Alhambra are summarised in Table 16 below.

TABLE 16.  TRANSITIONAL MET TEST WORK RESULTS 
 
In July 2007, SGS Lakefield Research Europe (SGS) completed metallurgical test work on 
primary zone material samples from the Uzboy project.  Samples were taken from selected 
drill holes from both West Uzboy (Zone 3 and Zone 4) and East Uzboy (East I (W) and East 
II (E). Total sample weights received for West Zone 3 and Zone 4 was 36.4Kg and 32.65Kg 
respectively.  Total sample weights received for East I and East II was 17.24Kg and 19.56Kg 
respectively. 
 
The SGS study concluded that whole ore cyanidation in conjunction with a fine grind would 
appear the most simple and cost effective route forward (Hallewell, 2007). 
 
By leaching a finely ground sample of the whole ore from Zone 3, 88.6% of the gold was 
recovered, and by leaching a finely ground sample of the whole ore from Zone 4, 91.8% of 
the gold was recovered.  Similarly using finely ground whole ore samples of Uzboy East I 
(W) and East II (E), recoveries of 90.1% and 94.0% Au were achieved respectively 
(Hallewell, 2007). 
 

15. PREVIOUS MINERAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES 

15.1. HISTORICAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

The following section is taken from Hogg (2007). 
 
Historical resource estimations were undertaken by Saga Creek (Cameco) for the Uzboy 
project in 1998, 2000 and 2001.  These estimations are detailed in the Howe 2006 Feasibility 
Study (Comeau et al, 2006). 
 
It is Howe's opinion that these resource estimates were not in accordance with CIM-approved 
categories. Howe was of the opinion that the spacing between data points, particularly core 
drill holes and trenching were too far apart to establish reliable continuity both in grade and 
mineralisation (Comeau et al, 2006). 



 

 57

 

15.2. PREVIOUS HOWE RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

The following section is modified from Hogg (2007). 
 
Howe completed computerised resource estimations in October 2002 and February 2003, 
along with Whittle optimisations as part of the Howe 2003 NI43-101 Preliminary Assessment 
(Scoping Study) for the project. 
 
At a 0.5g/t Au cut-off, a measured and indicated oxide resource of 3.1Mt @ 1.3g/t Au was 
reported for the West and East Uzboy zones.  Total measured and indicated resources were 
reported at 2.1mt @ 1.4g/t Au for West Uzboy and 1.0Mt @ 1.1g/t Au for East Uzboy. 
 
The resource estimation is detailed in Comeau et al, 2006 and Comeau et al, 2003. 
 
As part of the Howe 2006 Uzboy Feasibility study, computerised resource and reserve 
estimations were completed. 
 
Block Model estimates, undertaken using Ordinary Kriging (OK) were calculated for the 
Uzboy west and Uzboy East deposits - Uzboy Project, Kazakhstan. At a 0.2g/t lower cut-off 
and a top-cut of 20g/t Au, the total resource for each deposit are 12Mt @ 0.71 g Au/t at East 
Uzboy and 12.1Mt @ 0.97 g Au/t at West Uzboy. These resources included both the inferred 
category as well as the fresh (sulphide material) encountered in the drilling. 
 
Reserve estimations completed as part of the same study based upon a US$500/oz gold price 
report mineable reserve figures of 2.2Mt @ 1.15g/t Au for 82koz at West Uzboy and 2.8Mt 
@ 0.92g/t Au for 83koz. 
 
The Howe 2006 resource and reserve estimations are fully documented in the Uzboy 
Feasibility Study (Comeau et al, 2006). 
 
In early 2007, ACA Howe undertook an update of the oxide, transitional and primary 
resources for the Uzboy deposits.  CIM/JORC compliant computerised Ordinary Kriging, 
wireframe restricted, linear block model resource estimation of contained gold were 
completed for an effective date of 31 December 2006. 
 
At West Uzboy, total Measured and Indicated in-situ resources at a 0.2g/t Au cut off are 
estimated at 19.6Mt @ 1.12g/t Au for approximately 705,300oz Au. 
 
At East Uzboy, total Measured and Indicated in-situ resources at a 0.2g/t Au cut off are 
estimated at 7.8Mt @ 0.76g/t Au for approximately 190,900oz Au. 
 
The West and East Uzboy resource block models were subsequently used in pit optimisation 
studies for the oxide and transitional material at Uzboy.  Optimisation was completed upon 
Measured and Indicated oxide/transitional blocks only.  Inferred blocks were classed as waste 
in keeping with CIM/JORC and standard industry and reporting practices. 
 
Following pit design, mineable proven and probable oxide and transitional reserves for the 
West and East Uzboy gold deposits as of 31 December 2006 were estimated at 3.4Mt @ 
1.17g/t Au for 127,500oz Au for West Uzboy and 0.7Mt @ 0.82 for 17,500z Au for East 
Uzboy. 
 
Uzboy oxide and transitional reserves as of 31 December 2006 are summarised in Table 17 
and Table 18 below.

15.3. HOWE 2008 RESOURCE ESTIMATE AND INPUT TO SCOPING STUDY 

An update of oxide, transitional and primary gold resources by computerised Ordinary 
Kriging, wireframe restricted, linear block model resource estimation was undertaken by 
ACA Howe International Limited for the Uzboy gold project, Kazakhstan.  Pit optimisations 
and update of oxide and transitional material estimations was also undertaken as part of this 
study and detailed by Hogg (2008). 
 



 

 59

Resource estimations undertaken as part of this study represent updates of the estimates 
completed by Howe in June 2008 for the effective date of 31st December 2007.   
 
Raw data used in modelling the updated estimation consists of data from diamond drilling, 
surface trench and pit channel samples from historical and new data from the 2007 
exploration programs. 
 
At West Uzboy, total Measured and Indicated in-situ resources at a 0.2g/t Au cut off are 
estimated at 26.3Mt @ 1.24g/t Au for approximately 845,700oz Au. 
 
At East Uzboy, total Measured and Indicated in-situ resources at a 0.2g/t Au cut off are 
estimated at 9.7Mt @ 0.72g/t Au for approximately 223,300oz Au. 
 
These figures compare favourably to the previous Howe estimation dated 31 December 2006, 
and reported in Hogg (2007). 
 
These updated resource estimations represent a 19.9% increase in total measured and 
indicated resources at West Uzboy and a 17% increase in resources at East Uzboy from 
the previous effective date 31st December 2006 study. 
 
A summary of updated classified resources for the Uzboy project and used in this scoping 
study are presented in Table 20 and Table 21 below.  Full classified resource tables reporting

TABLE 21.  EAST UZBOY RESOURCE SUMMARY 31/12/07 
 
The updated West and East Uzboy resource block models were subsequently used in pit 
optimisation studies and estimation of the oxide and transitional material types at Uzboy. 
 
Optimisation at a US$850/oz input gold price was completed upon Measured and Indicated 
oxide and transitional resources only.  Inferred blocks were classed as waste in keeping with 
CIM/JORC and standard industry and reporting practices. 
  
Primary measured and indicated resources equating to close to 23Mt were not included in this 
optimisation and estimation study. 
 
Optimal pit shell analysis which analyses the mineable tonnes and potential financial benefits 
(financial flow) pit shell by pit shell was done to determine the optimal discounted pit shell.  
 
Pit#41 was selected for use in pit design and updated mineable tonnes reporting.  Pit#41 is 
selected for the greatest gold production within the recommended sequence of pit shells with 
very similar maximum achievable NPV. 
 
A total NPV value of approximately $42 million would result from mining the oxide and 
transitional material based upon discounted optimal pit #41 over four years of 
production. 
 
A summary of mineable oxide and transitional material for the West and East Uzboy gold 
deposits as of 31st December 2007 are presented in Table 22 and Table 23 below.

16. SCOPING STUDY PIT OPTIMISATIONS AND MINEABLE TONNAGE 
ESTIMATES 

Scoping study pit optimisations for oxide, transitional and primary resources were undertaken 
for 16 mining and operating scenarios testing various technical and economic input 
parameters. 
 
Two input resource block model scenarios were considered: 
 

• Block model using Measured and Indicated class of resources. 
• Block model using Measured, Indicated and Inferred class of resources 

 
For each of the resource block model scenarios two operating scenarios were considered: 
 

• Production processing performance of 1.2Mtpa for Oxide type and 1.8Mtpa for 
Transitional and Primary types.  Capital cost input of US$60 million. 

• Production processing performance of 1.2Mtpa for Oxide type and 3.6Mtpa for 
Transitional and Primary types. Capital cost input of US$80 million. 

 
For the above scenarios two geotechnical situations were considered: 
 

• Open pit mining with overall 45 degree pit slope angle for Oxide, Transitional and 
Primary zones. 

• Open pit mining with overall 45 degree pit slope angle for Oxide and Transitional 
zones, and overall 60 degree pit slope angle for the Primary zone. 

 
In addition to scoping the above scenarios, pit optimisation was undertaken at cut off 0.0g/t 
Au and 0.4g/t Au resulting in testing optimisations for a total of 16 scenarios.  
 
The following sections 17.1 to 17.6 are modified from Nesterov and Pertel (2008). 
 

16.1. INTRODUCTION 

Micromine Consulting, which is a consulting division of Micromine Pty Ltd, was initially 
involved in the Pit Optimisation study and mineable tonnage estimation for the Uzboy Gold 
Deposit in Kazakhstan during May and August 2007 and for subsequent updates during the 
period March to April 2008. 
 
Subsequently, Micromine Consulting was commissioned by ACA Howe International 
Limited (ACA Howe) to conduct pit optimisation and mineable tonnage estimation on the 
Uzboy Gold Deposit for this scoping study during the period August to October 2008. 
 
The main purpose of this study was to generate the ultimate pit shells and to analyse the 
nested pit shell with the aim of: 
 

• Determining the discounted optimal pit shells for each block model, technical and 
economic scenario. 

• Undertake preliminary economic assessment upon optimal discounted pit shells. 
• Estimating the mineable oxide, transitional and primary gold  mineable tonnages for 

the most favourable mining scenario.

Micromine Consulting carried out a pit optimisation and analysis study for the Uzboy gold  
deposit, using the updated 31st December 2007 resource block model. 
 
The deposit's input resource block models have the following features: 
 

• The West Uzboy block model contains 388,813 cells (blocks), using a block size of 5 
m (X) by 10 m (Y) by 5 m (Z) with sub-blocking to the minimum cell size of 1 by 2 
by 1 metres. 

• The East Uzboy block model contains 352,772 cells (blocks), using a block size of 10 
m (X) by 5 m (Y) by 5 m (Z) with sub-blocking to the minimum cell size of 2 by 1 by 
1 metres. 

 
The block model comprises blocks with gold metal grades only. The block models have been 
categorised as Measured, Indicated and Inferred.  The optimisation of the Uzboy project was 
carried out using the Mining module of the MICROMINE version 11.0.3 software package 
using the Lerch-Grossman algorithm.  
 
The main objective of the pit optimisation study was to define a mineable tonnage, based on 
the mining parameters and economic constraints provided by the client Alhambra Resources 
Limited and audited by ACA Howe, in order to generate a set of wireframes for the optimal 
pits.  The mineable tonnage consists of blocks that have a revenue value higher than the 
operating costs. The pit optimisation process involved block model preparation, pit 
optimisation – the generation of nested optimal pit shells, a gold price sensitivity analysis, an 
analysis of the optimal pit shells, the selection of optimal discounted pits and reporting (refer 
to the chart in Table 25). 



 

 65

 

TABLE 25.  PIT OPTIMISATION PROCESS 
 
The block model preparation consisted of several stages: 
 
Firstly, the East Uzboy block model was re-blocked to match the block definition of the West 
Uzboy block model. Then the West and East Uzboy blocks were joined.  Secondly, a blank 
block model was created to accommodate both West and East Uzboy.  The blank block model 
is a rock block model; it has a similar structure to the mineable tonnage model, but the metal 
grade fields and resource category fields are blank.  Thirdly, the rock model had to be added 
to the basic mineable tonnage model.  Finally, the joined block model (full block model) was 
clipped to the existing topographical surface.  After the above operations, one whole (full) 
block model with 9,345,547 cells was obtained. 
 
 
 



 

 66

There are three mineralisation types in the model: Oxide (OX), Transitional (TR) and Primary 
(PR). The intention is that Oxide mineralisation will be processed using the heap leach 
process, while Transitional and Primary mineralisation will be processed using the Grinding 
and Vat Leaching method for this study. 
 
A block flow diagram developed by Alhambra for the transitional and primary ore types is 
given in Table 26 below.

TRANSITIONAL AND PRIMARY MATERIAL 

 
Every geological zone will have different specific gravity, specific operating costs and 
processing parameters.  The summary resources of the West and East Uzboy projects by all 
categories and by the sum of Measured and Indicated, and Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
categories are shown at gold cut-off grades of 0.0 g/t in Table 26 and Table 27. 
 
Note: Tables in this section were prepared in Excel, which might result in some discrepancies 
between the input and the total figures, due to rounding performed by Excel.

TABLE 28.  RESOURCE SUMMARY INFERRED CATEGORY 
 
For the pit optimisation analyses, two types of block models were used. The first type of 
block model used measured and indicated resource categories only, and Inferred resources 
were added to the waste. The second type of block model used all resource categories: 
Measured, Indicated and Inferred. 
 
After the above operations, two types of full block model were obtained: 
 
1. A block model where Inferred resources were regarded as waste rock:  
2. A block model where Inferred resources were regarded as potentially mineable material, 
for the purposes of a preliminary assessment. 
 
Note: Under NI 43-101, the second type of block model including Inferred resources may be 
used for a preliminary assessment which is useful for the estimation of the project potential 
and also to plan further exploration and targets for the resource categories upgrade.

16.3. OPTIMISATION 

The Micromine Open Pit Optimiser is based on the Lerch-Grossman algorithm, an industry-
standard optimisation technique used in mining and exploration.  For a deposit represented as 
a grade or revenue, block model pit slopes are specified in terms of the blocks that must be 
removed to provide access to each block within the block model. In the Lerch–Grossmann 
algorithm, directed arcs impose these restrictions.  They indicate which blocks should be 
removed before a particular block can be either mined and processed, or be dumped as waste. 
 
Pit optimisation requires that a fixed cost/value be associated with each block. The value of a 
waste block usually defines the cost of mining and disposing (dumping, reclaiming, etc). It is 
negative value that indicates a loss. The value of an economically mineable block is usually 
defined by the profit from the mineral sale, minus the costs associated with mining and 
processing. A block will have a negative value if the costs are greater than the profit. This can 
make sense if the loss is still less than it would be if it were treated as a waste block. In 
general, the pit optimisation process treats the negative blocks as waste, and the positive 
blocks as mineable material. 
 
The optimisation of the block models was carried out using initial data (parameters) that had 
been supplied to Micromine Consulting by ACA Howe. The project evaluation was made 
using the assumptions shown in Table 30 above. 
 
The optimisation of the block models was carried out using 8 (eight) scenarios with different 
data (type of block model, mining and processing cost, annual ore processing performance 
and pit slope angle), all other input parameters were identical. 
 



 

 71

A combination of the specific parameters represents a unique set and constitutes an individual 
scenario. A three-level code scheme is suggested for the pit optimisation scenarios, as shown 
in Figure 14. In addition, pit optimisation was carried out using two variants with regard to 
cut-off grade: 
 

• 1st variant – pit optimisation without cut-off (or cut-off equal to 0.0 g/t); 
• 2nd variant – pit optimisation with a cut-off grade equal to 0.4 g/t. 

 
The cut-off grade means that blocks with a gold grade of less than the fixed cut-off grade 
value will not be processed and will be considered as waste. In other words, the cut-off grade 
divides mineralisation material into economical blocks and waste. The MICROMINE pit 
optimiser will define a cut-off grade itself, but it is possible to specify a custom cutoff grade 
(usually done if there are technological constraints). 
 
A total of 16 (sixteen) pit optimisation scenarios have been created for this study. 
 
An explanation of the data used in the process is as follows: 
 

• The resource block models have been categorised as Measured, Indicated and 
Inferred. The resource blocks categorised as Inferred were considered as waste in 
scenario 1.x.x and excluded from optimization.  Inferred blocks were included in 
optimisation for scenarios 2.x.x. 

• Due to more favourable recoveries through fine grinding as reported in Section 15, 
transitional material is to be processed along with primary material through the 
primary circuit. 

• The optimisation of the block models was carried out using only one base gold price 
of US$850. The commercial costs (bank fees, refining) and taxation fees (royalties) 
have been then subtracted from the gold price. 

• The specific mining and processing costs differ from one geological zone to another. 
Each block has different mining and processing costs. 

• The West and East Uzboy will be mined simultaneously.

The pit optimisation process produces the ultimate pit. The ultimate pit is a pit that gives the 
highest possible undiscounted surplus between revenue and summary operating cost, but does 
not consider some scheduling constraints and discounting. The main parameters of the 
ultimate pit are shown in Table 8 and Table 9, pages 14-17 of the full Micromine Pit 
optimisation and Analysis Study, (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008), for pit optimisation 
without a cut-off grade and with a gold cut-off grade of 0.4 g/t Au, respectively. 
 
The optimal pit gives the highest possible net present value, taking into account all 
operational scheduling constraints (annual mining and processing productivity), discounting 
and capital costs. 
 
The ultimate pit can be considered as the optimal pit, but only for deposit with a short mining 
life (2-3 years); if LOM is longer, it is necessary to generate nested pit shells and do an 
analysis of optimal pit shells. 
 
Nested pit shells are the pits that are generated using the identical input data, except for the 
gold price; it use multipliers (revenue adjustment factor - RAF) to based metal price. The 
generation of nested pit shells was done for a subsequent analysis of the pit shells, i.e. to find 
the discounted optimal pit. 
 
Micromine Consulting used revenue adjustment factors ranging from 0.2 to 1.10, with an 
increment of 0.02 (or 2 %), as a result, 46 nested pit shells were generated. The first and the 
smallest pit shell, pit shell #1, was generated using a gold price of 162 $/oz (0.2*812$/oz), the 
largest pit # 46 was generated using a gold price of 893 $/oz (1.1*812$/oz), and pit # 41 was 
generated using a base gold price of 812 $/oz. The ultimate pit is pit shell #41. 
 
Nested pit shells can be useful for gold price sensitivity analysis, which shows how gold price 
affects pit shells values (mineable tonnes, waste, etc.). It is also possible to see changes in 
economical gold cut-off grades. Pit names (numbers), the corresponding gold price, the 
revenue adjustment factor (RAF) and cut-off grade by type of material are shown in Table 10, 
page 19 of the full Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008). Those cut-off grades 
that have values less than 0.4 g/t are shown in red, these values were substituted with values 
equal to 0.4 g/t for the pit optimisation variant that uses the cut-off grade of 0.4 g/t. 
 
The mineable tonnage of the nested pit shells of Uzboy are shown in Table 11 and Table 12, 
pages 20 and 21 of the full Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008), for pit 
optimisation without cut-off grade and with cut-off grade 0.4 g/t, respectively. 
 

16.4. OPTIMAL PIT ANALYSIS 

Optimal pit shell analysis is the process that analyses mineable tonnes, waste tonnage, metal 
production and financial flow for each of the nested pit shells. The mineable tonnes in each 
nested pit shell are calculated using an initial metal price only – 812$/oz. 
 
The analysis of nested pit shells allows the optimal pit shell to be selected and the future 
discounted financial flow to be determined, taking into account the discount rate and other 
parameters such as capital expenses. As a result of the pit shell analysis, the true optimal pit 
can be selected.  The additional parameters used for the analysis of the nested pit shells are 
shown in Table 33.  The pit shell analysis parameters can also be seen in Figure 14.

TABLE 33.  PARAMETERS FOR PIT SHELL ANALYSIS 
 
Note: pit shell analysis was carried out using the same pit shells and marked blocks that were 
create and described in Table 31. 
 
Two methods were used to determine the mining sequence for the pit shells. These methods 
are shown in the illustration in Figure 15. 
 
The "best" method assumes that the pit shells will be mined consequently (initially the first 
one, then the second one, etc.). 
 
The "worst" method assumes that each pit shell will be mined completely from top to bottom, 
without taking any other pit shells into consideration. 
 
In real life, neither method is used on their own. The true optimal discounted pit should be 
determined using a mixture of these two extreme cases. To determine the practical optimal 
pit, pushback analysis and pit design studies are required, neither of which were in the scope 
of this study. Therefore, the pit selected as the discounted optimal pit was the one calculated 
as the average between the pits with the maximum NPV using the "Best" and "Worst" 
methods. 
 
During the analysis of the pit shells for each case, the results were stored in a file. This file 
contains the following data for each pit shell: 
 

• mining material, 
• processing values, 
• discounted financial flows, 
• time period of mining.

16.4.1. PIT SHELL ANALYSIS FOR SCENARIOS WITHOUT CUT OFF 

The full results of nested pit shell analyses for pit optimisation scenarios without a cut-off 
grade are shown in tables: Table 15, Table 18, Table 21, Table 24, Table 27, Table 30, Table 
33, and Table 36 of Section 4.1 of the Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008), 
and accompanying excel files for each of the eight scenarios respectively. The visual 
representation of NPV, waste and mineable tonnes for nested optimal pit shells are shown in 
Figure 16 to Figure 23, for each of the eight scenarios respectively.  The mineable tonnes in 
the selected optimal pit are shown in: Table 34, Table 35, Table 36, Table 37, Table 38, Table 
39, Table 44 and Table 41.  A summary of the selected pit shells is shown in Table 42. 
 
NPV is equivalent to the sum of all discounted cash flows. The NPV is shown for two mining 
sequence methods and average is given. 
 
Note: All the above values are calculated and discounted for one particular period i.е. 
specific mining costs for the 1st year do not have the same value in the 5th year. 
 
 Volume and tonnage of mineable material in selected optimal pits is presented without taking 
into account dilution and mining recovery. 
 
More detailed information about pit shell analysis is in the corresponding Excel spreadsheets 
which will be attached to this project. 
 
The process of selecting an optimal pit from some nested pit shells will be presented below 
for each pit optimisation scenario without a cut-off grade. 

16.4.1.1. Scenario 1.1.1 (M + I resources, 1.2/1.8mtpa, 45˚/45˚ pit slope) 

A full table of results of the nested pit shells analyses is shown in Table 15 of the Micromine 
report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (no cut 
off).xlsx spreadsheets. 
 
The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$111.6M for pit #41 and for 
the worst mining sequence method, US$69.4M in pit #26. The maximum average NPV 
between the best and the worst cases is US$86.5M for pit #26. According to Micromine 
Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 26 through to 41 inclusive. A 
summary of major pit shell values variations are shown in Table 14 of the Micromine report 
(Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and in the accompanying Results of analysis (no cut 
off).xlsx spreadsheets. 
 
The analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that the NPV for the best case increased 
slightly (less than 0.3%) after pit #33. Micromine Consulting would recommend selecting pit 
#33 which has an average NPV of US$82.3M and recovered metal value of 432,000 ounces, 
Au.  The increase of recovered metal from pits above #33 does not result in an increase of 
NPV. The additional gold production would not result in significant additional profit.  In 
additional, this pit represents the closest average between the pits with maximum NPV for the 
worst (#26) and best (#41) methods.  Micromine Consulting recommends pit #30 as an 
alternative optimal pit. This pit has lesser risk than Pit #33, but it has 4% less gold production 
potential. 
 
The volume of pit#33 is equal to 24.2 mln cbm (63.5 mln t), including 19 mln cbm (50 mln t) 
for West Uzboy and 5.1 mln cbm (13.5 mln t) for East Uzboy. The common strip ratio is 4.4 
tonne per tonne, including 5.3 t/t for West Uzboy and 2.6 t/t for East Uzboy.  Figure 16 
provides representation of mining material and NPV values for the 1.1.1 (no cut off) optimal 
pit shells.

There is a wide range of possible optimal pits in this scenarios (from Pit #21 to Pit #36), but 
Micromine Consulting would recommend selecting Pit #33, which generates an average NPV 
of US$116.2M and metal recovery of 572,000 ounces Au.  Micromine Consulting 
recommends Pit #31 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than Pit #33, and Pit#36 as an 
alternative pit with more risk.

16.4.1.3. Scenario 1.2.1 

The result of the nested pit shell analyses is shown in Table 18 of the Micromine report

#41 and for worst mining sequence method, US$67.6 in pit #25. The maximum average NPV 
between the best and the worst cases is US$82.1 for pit #25. 
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 25 
through to 41 inclusive. A summary of major pit shell values variations are shown in Table 20 
of the Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and in the accompanying Results 
of analysis (no cut off).xlsx spreadsheets. 
 
The analysis of major values of pit shells showed that the NPV for best case increased only 
slightly after pit #35 therefore Micromine Consulting would recommend selecting pit #35 
which generates an average NPV US$81.4M and 459,000 ounces Au recovered metal. The 
additional gold production beyond this pit would not result in significant additional profit. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #31 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than 
selected Pit #35. 
 
The volume of pit #35 is equal to 27.2 mln cbm (71.4 mln t), including 21.4 mln cbm (56.2 
mln t) for West Uzboy and 5.8 mln cbm (15.2 mln t) for East Uzboy. The common strip ratio 
is 4.4 tonne per tonne, including 5.2 t/t for West Uzboy and 2.6 t/t for East Uzboy.

16.4.1.4. Scenario 1.2.2 (M + I resources, 1.2/3.6mtpa, 45˚/60˚ pit slope) 

The full results of the nested pit shell analyses is shown in Table 24 of the Micromine report 
(Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (no cut off).xlsx 
spreadsheet. The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$177.0M for pit 
#41 and US$98.2 for the worst mining sequence method in pit #19.  The maximum average 
NPV between the best and the worst cases is US$130.8M for pit #32.  
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 19 
through to 41 inclusive.  A summary of major pit shell values variations are shown in Table 
23 of the Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and in the accompanying 
Results of analysis (no cut off).xlsx spreadsheets.

Micromine Consulting would recommend selecting pit #35 which generates and average NPV 
of US$130.4M and recovered metal of 691,000 ounces Au, because the increase of recovered 
metal beyond this pit does not result in an increase of NPV, even for the best case.  In 
additional, this pit represents the closest average between the pits with the maximum NPV for 
worst and best methods. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #32 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than 
selected Pit #35, but with 5% less of gold production potential. 
 
The volume of pit #35 is equal to 51.0 mln cbm (135.2 mln t), including 42.2 mln cbm (112.0 
mln t) for West Uzboy and 8.8 mln cbm (23.3 mln t) for East Uzboy. The common strip ratio 
is 5.7 tonne per tonne, including 6.8 t/t for West Uzboy and 3.0 t/t for East Uzboy. 
 
Figure 19 provides graphical representation of mining material and NPV values for the 1.2.2 
(no cut off) optimal pit shells.   Mineable tonnages contained within Pit #35 are presented in 
Table 37.

16.4.1.5. Scenario 2.1.1 (M + I + I resources, 1.2/1.8mtpa, 45˚/45˚ pit slope) 

The result of the nested pit shell analyses is shown in Table 27 of the Micromine report 
(Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (no cut off).xlsx 
spreadsheet. The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$156.9M for pit 
#39 and US$75.9M for worst mining sequence method, pit #21. The maximum average NPV 
between the best and the worst cases is US$102.8M for pit #24. 
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 21 
through to 39 inclusive.  A summary of major pit shell values variations are shown in Table 
26 of the Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and in the accompanying 
Results of analysis (no cut off).xlsx spreadsheets.

The analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that NPV for best case increased only 
slightly (less than 0.3%) after pit #33 which generates an average NPV of US$95.9M, and 
recoverable metal of 668,000 ounces Au, therefore Micromine Consulting would 
recommend selecting pit #33. The additional gold production would not result in significant 
additional profit. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #29 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than 
selected Pit #33, but it has 12% less gold production potential. 
 
The volume of pit #33 is equal to 39.4 mln cbm (103.9 mln t), including 20.2 mln cbm (53.1 
mln t) for West Uzboy and 19.2 mln cbm (50.8 mln tonnes) for East Uzboy. The common 
strip ratio is 3.7 tonne per tonne, including 4.6 t/t for West Uzboy and 3.0 t/t for East Uzboy. 
 
A visual representation of results is provided in Figure 20 below, and summary of  mineable 
tonnages for pit #33 shown in Table 38.

16.4.1.6. Scenario 2.1.2 (M + I + I resources, 1.2/1.8mtpa, 45˚/60˚ pit slope) 

The result of the nested pit shell analyses is shown in full in Table 30 of the Micromine report 
(Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (no cut off).xlsx 
spreadsheet. The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$229.6M for pit 
#41 and for worst mining sequence method, US$107.0M in pit #13 the maximum average 
NPV is for pit #21. 
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 25 
through to 41 inclusive. A summary of major pit shell values variations are shown in Table 29 
of the Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and in the accompanying Results 
of analysis (no cut off).xlsx spreadsheets. 
 
The analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that NPV for best case increased only 
slightly (less than 0.2%) after pit #32, therefore Micromine Consulting would recommend 
selecting this pit. 
 
Pit #32 generates and average NPV of US$140M, and gold production of 954,000 ounces 
Au. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #26 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than 
selected Pit #32, but 19% less gold production potential. 
 
The volume of pit #33 is equal to 61.2 mln cbm (162.4 mln t), including 43.1 mln cbm (114.3 
mln t) for West Uzboy and 18.1 mln cbm (48.1 mln t) for East Uzboy. The common strip ratio 
is 4.5 tonne per tonne, including 6.5 t/t for West Uzboy and 2.4 t/t for East Uzboy.

16.4.1.7. Scenario 2.2.1 (M + I + I resources, 1.2/3.6mtpa, 45˚/45˚ pit slope) 

The result of the nested pit shell analyses is shown in Table 33 of the Micromine report 
(Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (no cut off).xlsx 
spreadsheet. The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$163.8M for pit 
#41 and for the worst mining sequence method, US$77.4M for pit #18. The maximum 
average NPV between the best and the worst cases is US$105.7M for pit #28. 
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 18 
through to 41 inclusive. A summary of major pit shell values variations are shown in Table 32 
of the Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and in the accompanying Results 
of analysis (no cut off).xlsx spreadsheets. 
 
Analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that beyond pit #32 which generates average 
NPV of US$104.6M and gold production of 697,000 ounces Au, the NPV for the best case 
increased only slightly (less than 0.3%), therefore Micromine Consulting would recommend 
selecting pit #32. 
 
The volume of pit #32 is equal to 42.3 mln cbm (111.4 mln t), including 21.4 mln cbm (56.1 
mln t) for West Uzboy and 20.9 mln cbm (55.3 mln tonnes) for East Uzboy. The common 
strip ratio is 3.7 t/t. 
 
A visual representation of results is provided in Figure 22 below, and summary of mineable 
tonnages for pit #32 shown in Table 40.

16.4.1.8. Scenario 2.2.2 (M + I + I resources, 1.2/3.6mtpa, 45˚/60˚ pit slope) 

The result of the nested pit shell analyses is shown in Table 36 of the Micromine report 
(Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (no cut off).xlsx 
spreadsheet. The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$254.3M for pit 
#41 and for the worst mining sequence method, US$105.0M in pit #19. The maximum 
average NPV between the best and the worst cases is US$170.0M for pit #29. 
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 19 
through to 41 inclusive. The changing pit shell values are shown in Table 35 of the 
Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and in the accompanying Results of 
analysis (no cut off).xlsx spreadsheets. 
 
The analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that the NPV for best case increased 
only slightly (less than 0.3%) and decreases for average between best and worst case after pit 
#31 which generates an average NPV of US$170M and gold production of 982,000 
ounces Au, therefore Micromine Consulting would recommend selecting this pit. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #28 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than 
selected pit #32, but 5% less gold production potential. 
 
The volume of pit #31 is equal to 53.7 mln cbm (142.3 mn t), including 40.5 mln cbm (107.3 
mln t) for West Uzboy and 13.2 mln cbm (35.0 mln t) for East Uzboy. The common strip ratio 
is equal to 4.5 t/t.

16.4.2. PIT SHELL ANALYSIS FOR SCENARIOS WITH CUT OFF GRADE 0.4G/T 
AU 

The results of nested pit shell analyses for pit optimisation scenarios with a cut-off grade of 
0.4 g/t are shown in the following tables: Table 40, Table 43, Table 46, Table 49, Table 52, 
Table 55, Table 58, Table 61 of Section 4.2 of the Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, 
D. 2008), and accompanying excel files for each of the eight scenarios respectively. 
 
A visual graphical representation of NPV, waste and mineable tonnes for nested optimal pit 
shells are shown in Figure 24 to Figure 32 for each of the eight scenarios respectively. 
 
The mineable tonnes in selected optimal pits are shown in Table 42, Table 43, Table 44, 
Table 45, Table 46, Table 47, Table 48 and Table 49.  A summary of the selected pit shells is 
shown in Table 50. 
 
NPV is equivalent to the sum of all discounted cash flows. The NPV is shown for two mining 
sequence methods and average is given. 
 
Note: All the above values are calculated and discounted for one particular period i.е. 
specific mining costs for the 1st year do not have the same value in the 5th year. 
 
Volume and tonnage of mineable material in selected optimal pits is presented without taking 
into account dilution and mining recovery. 
 
More detailed information about pit shell analysis is in the corresponding Excel spreadsheets 
which will be attached to this project. 
 
The process of selecting an optimal pit from some nested pit shells will be presented below 
for each scenario for pit optimisation with a cut-off grade of 0.4 g/t.

16.4.2.1. Scenario 1.1.1 (M + I resources, 1.2/1.8mtpa, 45˚/45˚ pit slope) 

The full results of the nested pit shells analyses are shown in Table 40 of the Micromine 
report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (cut-off 
0,4).xlsx spreadsheet. 
 
The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$111.4M for pit #41 and for 
the worst mining sequence method, US$81.4M for pit #23; the maximum average NPV 
between the best and the worst cases is US$91.2M for pit #23. 
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 26 
through to 41 inclusive. The changing pit shell values are shown in Table 39 of the 
Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and in the accompanying Results of 
analysis (cut-off 0,4).xlsx spreadsheets. 
 
Analysis of the major values of the pit shells showed that the NPV for the best case increased 
slightly (about 0.1%) after pit #33, therefore Micromine Consulting would recommend 
selecting this pit. 
 
Pit #33 generates an average NPV of US$89.7M, and gold production of 410,000 ounces. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #31 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than 
selected Pit #33, but 3% less gold production potential. 
 
The volume of pit #33 is equal to 24 mln cbm (62.9 mln t), including 19 mln cbm (49.9 mln t) 
for West Uzboy and 4.9 mln cbm (12.9 mln t) for East Uzboy. The common strip ratio is 
equal to 5.9 t/t, including 6.5 t/t for West Uzboy and 4.4 t/t for East Uzboy. 
 
Graphical representation of results is provided in Figure 24 below, and summary of mineable 
tonnages for pit #33 scenario 1.1.1 (cut off 0.4) shown in Table 43.

16.4.2.2. Scenario 1.1.2 (M + I resources, 1.2/1.8mtpa, 45˚/60˚ pit slope) 

The results of the nested pit shell analyses are shown in Table 43 of the Micromine report 
(Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (cut-off 0,4).xlsx 
spreadsheet. The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$164.5M for pit 
#39 and for the worst mining sequence method, is US$108.2M in pit #19; the maximum 
average NPV between the best and the worst cases is US$126.2M for pit #33. 
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 19 
through to 41 inclusive. The changing pit shell values are shown in Table 42 of the 
Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis 
(cut-off 0,4).xlsx spreadsheet.

The analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that the NPV of for best case increased 
slightly (about 0.1%) after pit #34, with the exception of Pit #37. Therefore Micromine 
Consulting would recommend selecting this pit. 
 
Pit #34 generates an NPV of US$126.1M and gold production of 549,000 ounces Au. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #37 as an alternative optimal pit, because it has a gold 
production potential of more than 12%. However, it is more risky, since pit #37 is close to the 
pit with the maximum NPV for best case. Micromine Consulting also recommends pit #31, 
which is less risky than selected pit #34, but has 13% less gold production potential. 
 
The volume of pit #34 is equal to 34.6 mln cbm (91.5 mln t), including 27.7 mln cbm (73.1 
mln t) for West Uzboy and 7.0 mln cbm (18.5 mln t) for East Uzboy. The common strip ratio 
is 6.4 tonne per tonne, including 7.0 t/t for West Uzboy and 4.7 t/t for East Uzboy. 
 
Graphical representation of results is provided in Figure 25 below, and summary of mineable 
tonnages for pit #33 scenario 1.1.2 (cut off 0.4) shown in Table 44.

Analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that the NPV for best case increased slightly 
less than 0.1% after pit #35. The additional gold production would not result in significant 
additional profit therefore Micromine Consulting would recommend selecting this pit #35. 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #28 as being less risky than selected pit #35 but with 
8.3% less gold production potential. 
 
Optimal pit #35 generates an average NPV of US$90.0M and gold production of 431,000 
ounces Au recovered metal. 
 
The volume of pit #35 is equal to 27.0 mln cbm (71 mln tonnes), including 21.3 mln cbm 
(55.9 mln tonnes) for West Uzboy and 5.7 mln cbm (15.0 mln tonnes) for East Uzboy. The 
common strip ratio is 6.2 tonne per tonne, including 6.9 t/t for West Uzboy and 4.6 t/t for East 
Uzboy.

Micromine Consulting would recommend selecting pit #35, because the increase of recovered 
metal from beyond this pit does not result in an increase in NPV even for the best case. In 
additional, this pit represents the closest average between the pits with the maximum NPV for 
the worst and best methods. 
 
Pit #35 generates an average NPV of US$143.0M and gold production of 651,000 ounces. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #32 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than 
selected Pit #35, but 5% less gold production potential. 
 
The volume of selected pit #35 is equal to 50.8 mln cbm (134.6 mln t), including 42.1 mln 
cbm (111.6 mln t) for West Uzboy and 8.7 mln cbm (23 mln t) for East Uzboy. The common 
strip ratio is 7.7 tonne per tonne, including 8.5 t/t for West Uzboy and 5.2 t/t for East Uzboy.

(Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (cut-off 0,4).xlsx 
spreadsheet. 
 
The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is 160.0M for pit #41 and for the 
worst mining sequence method, US$92.0M for pit #23; the maximum average NPV between 
the best and the worst cases is US$117.5M for pit #23. 
 
According to Micromine Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 23 
through to 41 inclusive. The changing pit shell values are shown in Table 51 of the 



 

 113

Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis 
(cut-off 0,4).xlsx spreadsheet. 
 
The analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that NPV for best case increased slightly 
(less than 0.3%) after pit #34. Micromine Consulting would recommend selecting this pit #34. 
The additional gold production would not result in significant additional profit. 
 
Optimal pit #34 generates an average NPV of US$113.4M and gold production of 
625,000 ounces Au. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #29 as an alternative optimal pit with less risk than 
selected Pit #34, but it has gold production potential less by 12%. 
 
The volume of pit#34 is equal to 39.9 mln cbm (105.2 mln t), including 20.4 mln cbm (53.5 
mln t) for West Uzboy and 19.6 mln cbm (51.7 mln tonnes) for East Uzboy. The common 
strip ratio is 5.4 tonne per tonne, including 5.9 t/t for West Uzboy and 4.9 t/t for East Uzboy. 
 
Visual representation of results is provided in Figure 28 below, and summary of mineable 
tonnages for pit #34 scenario 2.1.1 (cut off 0.4) shown in Table 47.

16.4.2.6. Scenario 2.1.2 (M +I + I resources, 1.2/1.8mtpa, 45˚/60˚ pit slope) 

The complete result of the nested pit shell analyses is shown in Table 55 of the Micromine 
report (Nesterov, O. and Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (cut-off 
0,4).xlsx spreadsheet. 
 
The maximum NPV for the best mining sequence method is US$236.2M for pit #41 and for 
the worst mining sequence method, US$125.9M pit #20. The maximum average NPV 
between the best and the worst cases is US$165.9M for pit #26. According to Micromine 
Consulting, the most promising optimal pit shells are from 20 through to 41 inclusive. The 
changing pit shell values are shown in Table 54 of the Micromine report (Nesterov, O. and 
Pertel, D. 2008) and accompanying Results of analysis (cut-off 0,4).xlsx spreadsheet. 
 
The analysis of the major values of pit shells showed that the NPV for the best case increased 
slightly (less than 0.2%) after pit #32, therefore Micromine Consulting would recommend 
selecting this pit. 
 
Pit #32 generates an average NPV of US$164.5M and gold production of 896,000 ounces. 
 
Micromine Consulting recommends pit #26 as an alternative optimal pit that is less risky, but 
has 18% less gold production potential. 
 
The volume of pit #32 is equal to 60.8 mln cbm (161.3 mln t), including 43.1 mln cbm 
and 17.7 mln cbm for West and East Uzboy respectively. The common strip ratio is 6.0 
tonne per tonne, including 7.7 t/t for West Uzboy and 3.8 t/t for East Uzboy. 
 
Graphical representation of results is provided in Figure 29 below, and summary of mineable

selected Pit #31, but 5% less gold production potential. 
 
The volume of pit #31 is equal to 65.3 mln cbm (173.3 mln t), including 46.6 mln cbm for 
West Uzboy and 18.7 mln cbm for East Uzboy. The common strip ratio is 6.3 t/t, including 
8.1 t/t for West Uzboy and 3.9 t/t for East Uzboy. 
 
Graphical representation of results is provided in Figure 31 below, and summary of mineable 
tonnages for pit #31 scenario 2.2.1 (cut off 0.4) shown in Table 50.

16.5. PIT DESIGN 

Pit design was completed to improve accuracy and confidence of mineable tonnages  for all 
material types at the West and East Uzboy deposits.  This work was undertaken by Oleg 
Nesterov, Micromine Consulting Engineer.  This work was done based on the selected 
optimized pit shells generated in Micromine. 
 
Following optimisation a comparison and detailed review of results for the 2 grade cut off and 
8 operating scenarios was undertaken. 
 
Preferred optimum pit shells for two mining scenarios for the 0.4g/t Au grade input 
optimisations were selected for pit design and scoping study mineable  tonnage estimation.   
 
Optimum pit #35 was selected for scenario 1.2.1, which uses measured and indicated 
resources, annual throughput of 1.2Mtpa for oxide and 3.6Mtpa for transitional and primary, 
and pit design inter-ramp angle of 45 degrees for all zones. 
 
Optimal pit #35 was selected for scenario 1.2.2, which uses measured and indicated resources, 
annual throughput of 1.2Mtpa for oxide and 3.6Mtpa for transitional and primary, and pit 
design inter-ramp angles of 45 degrees for oxide/transitional and 60 degrees for primary 
zones.  
 
Summary details of the selected optimal pit shells are shown in Table 52 below.

Pit design using the above parameter inputs, optimum pit outlines and optimum pit shell 
wireframes was completed in Micromine v.11 Opencut Pit Design function. 
 
West and East Uzboy pits were built separately, for use in deposit specific mineable  tonnage 
reporting and possible future mine schedules.  Each pit was built from the base, up and out on 
consecutive 5m benches beyond the upper limits of the optimised pit shell wireframes and 
surface topography DTM. 
 
Wireframes were subsequently created for the West and East Uzboy pits, and truncated using 
the Topographical DTM.

TABLE 62.  RELATIVE VALUE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPTIMAL

Relative differences in values calculated between designed and optimal pit#35 (scenario 
1.2.2) falls outside the recommended +/- 10% limits and therefore the designed pits for 
optimum pit#35, scenario 1.2.2 are considered invalid. 
 
There is in this case a greater than 20% difference in pit volumes due to accommodation of 
the haul road within the primary zone, which has the much steeper inter-ramp angle of 60 
degrees.  This steeper pit slope angle doesn't allow for the incorporation of the haul road 
whilst retaining acceptable designed versus optimal pit volume difference. 
 
Visual checks were performed to check against optimum Pit#35 wireframes and preliminary 
pit design wireframes.  Poor correlation occurs between optimised Pit#35 and preliminary pit 
design wireframes. 
 
Completed preliminary pit design WFM's for optimal pit#35 (scenario 1.2.2) (0.4g/t Au cut-
off) are shown in Figures 35 to 37.

16.7. SCOPING STUDY MINEABLE TONNAGE REPORTING 

16.7.1. INPUT DATA 

Uzboy block models created during recent resource estimations with effective date 31 
December 2007, and modified for use in pit optimisation were used for scoping study  
mineable tonnage estimations.  Optimal pit shell and preliminary pit design for selected 
operating and mining scenario 1.2.1 (0.4g/t Au block model grade cut off) were used. 
 
Pit design wireframes and topography (incorporating existing pits as of 31 December 2007) 
were used to domain and code the block model data.  Details of the wireframes used are 
provided in Table 63 below.

TABLE 63.  BLOCK MODEL DOMAIN WIREFRAMES 
 
Mineable tonnages were estimated using a minimum mining (processing) grade of 0.434g/t 
Au which includes mining dilution.   
 
Measured and Indicated Blocks within the designed Pit#35 which had grade equal to or 
greater than the minimum process grade for the respective material type were considered for 
scoping study mineable  tonnages estimation.  
 

16.7.2.  MINEABLE TONNAGE CLASSIFICATION 

Scoping study mineable tonnage classification is based upon CIM/JORC compliant resource 
classification categories. 
 
Measured resource blocks which are situated within the pit design are classified as Class 1 
mineable tonnages, and Indicated blocks which are situated within the pit design are classified 
as Class 2. 
 
Inferred blocks are classified along with waste. 
 

16.7.3. MINEABLE TONNAGE REPORTING 

Oxide, transitional and primary mineable tonnages based upon the selected input block model, 
operating and mine design scenario 1.2.1 for the Uzboy gold deposit as at 31 December 2007 
are provided below.  Plan and 3 dimensional views of pit designs and mining block models 
are presented in Figures 38 to 41. 
 
At West Uzboy mineable tonnage estimations for scenario 1.2.1 pit#35 for total oxide, 
transitional and primary material equals 6.9Mt @ 2.01g/t Au for 447.5k oz Au. 
 
A summary of mineable tonnes in the pit#35, scenario 1.2.1 (0.4g/t Au cut off) for the West

17. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

A scoping study for open pit development upon the oxide, transitional and primary resources 
at the Uzboy gold project Kazakhstan for the effective date 31 December 2007 was 
undertaken by ACA Howe International Limited. 
 
This report outlines the results of pit optimisation including preliminary economic 
assessment, selected preliminary pit design and mineable tonnage estimation based upon 
recently updated resource block models completed in June 2008 with an effective date 31 
December 2007. 
 
Pit optimisation was carried out using 16 different block model, operating and mining data 
input scenarios.  Variable parameters included the use of Measured and Indicated resources 
only or Measured, Indicated and Inferred resources as inputs, use of two annual production 
rates for the primary (transitional) plant and two associated capital cost inputs, the use of two 
gold cut off grades for ore processing (0.0g/t Au and 0.4g/t Au) and use of two inter-ramp 
slope angles for the mining the primary zone (45° and 60°). 
 
The optimal pit shells were initially generated using the supplied economic and technical 
parameters then the analysis of nested pits was completed using the base gold price and 
discounted cash flow.  Maximum NPV values were used to select the optimal discounted pits 
for each of the 16 scenarios for each deposit zone (Nesterov, 2008). 
 
A total of 16 optimal pits for Uzboy were selected as a result of the optimisation study.   
 
The results show that although metal in  mineable tonnages and recovered metal values are 
lower optimal pit shells for scenarios using the 0.4g/t gold cut off for ore processing generate 
greater NPV. 
 
From the suite of optimal pits with 0.4g/t Au cut off, two from scenario 1.x.x (Measured and 
Indicated resources only) were selected for preliminary pit design and scoping study mineable  
tonnage estimation.  Pits for scenario 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 were chosen. 
 
Preliminary pit design on optimal pit #35 for both scenario 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 was carried out 
using the main engineering parameters provided by the client and audited by Howe. 
 
The results of the pit design for scenario 1.2.1 were acceptable with relative difference in 
values between the optimal and designed pit being within 7-8%.  Results for scenario 1.2.2 
with steeper pit slope angle in the primary zone proved unacceptable with greater than 20% 
difference in pit volume between optimal and designed pits. 
 
Scoping study mineable tonnage classification for scenario 1.2.1 is based upon CIM/JORC 
compliant resource classification categories. Measured resource blocks which are situated 
within the pit design are classified as Class 1 mineable tonnages, and Indicated blocks which 
are situated within the pit design are classified Class 2. Inferred blocks are classified along 
with waste. 
 
A detailed breakdown of mineable oxide, transitional and primary  mineable tonnages based 
upon the selected input block model, operating and mine design scenario 1.2.1 (0.4g/t cut off) 
for the Uzboy gold deposit as at 31 December 2007 are provided in Table 67 below.

TABLE 67.  WEST AND EAST SCENARIO 1.2.1 PIT#35 MINEABLE 
TONNAGES 

 
 The volume of scenario 1.2.1 designed Pit#35 for Uzboy West and East zones is equal to 
26.4M m³, containing a total of 9.5M tonnes of mineable material.  Waste material totals 
22.8M m³, representing 59.7M tonnes of material. The common mineable tonnage to waste 
strip ratio is 6.3 tonne per tonne. 
 
Total Class 1 and Class 2 oxide, transitional and primary mineable tonnages at West and East 
Uzboy, for operating scenario 1.2.1 optimal pit #35 as of 31 December 2007 are 9.5Mt @ 
1.76g/t Au for 538,500oz Au. 
 
Total recoverable ounces of gold after mining losses and processing recoveries have been 
factored in are estimated at 352.6k oz Au and 68.1k oz Au for West and East Uzboy 
respectively.  Total recoverable gold for the Uzboy project based upon operating 
scenario 1.2.1 equals approximately 420.7k ounces Au. 
 
In Howe's opinion the results of the 16 scenario optimisation scoping study are encouraging, 
with positive net present value being generated for all input and operating scenarios to 
optimisation. 
 
The study found scenario 1.2.1 using CIM compliant block model inputs to optimisation 
(Measured and Indicated blocks only) most feasible, with positive and acceptable results 
returned from an operating scenario using an annual production rate of 1.2Mtpa for 
oxide (currently in place) and 3.6Mtpa for transitional and primary material, overall 
inter-ramp pit slopes of 45° for all zones and 0.4g/t gold processing cut off.  This 
scenario generates an NPV for the project of approximately US$90M over a 3-4 year 
mine life. 
 
Alternate selected optimal pit #35 for scenario 1.2.2, using same inputs as scenario 1.2.1 with 
steeper inter-ramp pit slope angle of 60° for the primary zone does generate an even greater 
net present value of approximately US$143M.  However it was impossible to design a valid 
pit for the optimal shell based upon the inter-ramp pit slope input of 60 degrees for the 
primary as inclusion of the haul road using this slope angle increased the overall pit volume 
too much. 
 
To further investigate the option of increased pit slope angle for the primary zone it is 
recommended optimisation is undertaken using pit slope angles of 50-52 degrees for the 
primary zone and 40-42 degrees for the oxide and transitional zones, as these will better take 
into consideration the inclusion of the haul road as part of the preliminary pit design 
(Nesterov pers. comm.). 



 

 146

 
Optimisation using scenarios 2.x.x (which include Inferred resource blocks) proved extremely 
useful in highlighting the potential at Uzboy. 
 
Using the same feasible technical-economic scheme as scenario 1.2.1 which accommodates 
an acceptable pit design, but including Inferred resource blocks, the optimal pit returns an 
increased NPV of US$130M.  This represents a US$40M increase on NPV generated by 
optimisation using Measured and Indicated blocks only.  
 
Significant scope remains for conversion of inferred material to indicated and measured, and 
from waste to economic mineable tonnes at both East and West Uzboy. 
 
Future work should involve the conversion of Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated 
resources for inclusion in mineable tonnage estimation.  Optimum pit shell #32 for operating 
scenario 2.2.1 should be used in plan, cross sections and long sections for effective resource 
and mineable tonnage upgrade drill targeting. 
 
Howe recommends future work to advance the open pit project study towards Prefeasibility 
includes improved definition and inclusion of: 
 

• Mining parameters and geotechnical data 
• Test based hydrogeological parameters 
• Equipment, consumables and personnel lists for mining, processing, infrastructure 

and administration 
• Final pit and dump outlines 
• Annual pit and dump outlines 
• Detailed annual production and waste tonnage and grade schedules 
• Detailed process flow diagrams 
• Plant site plans 
• Inclusion of Financial Status Report costs 
• Infrastructure facilities list 
• Detailed power and water parameters 
• Detailed environmental permit/regulatory framework reports 
• Environmental Impact Analysis and environmental impact mitigation plan 
• Mine waste management plan and characterisation of mine and process waste 
• Provision of solid and hazardous material handling methods 
• Provision of spill prevention and emergency response plans 
• Environmental capital and operating cost estimates 
• Environmental closure costs and accounting methods 
• Preliminary execution plan  
• Principle economic parameters including IRR and ROI 
• Royalties and cash flows 
• Detailed operating parameter sensitivity analysis 

 
In addition, recommendations for further and improved working practices; data collection, 
analyses, sample recovery, domain modelling and geotechnical listed in the Howe Resource 
and Reserve report (Hogg, 2008) must be considered prior to moving forward. 
 
This work to include the improvement of geotechnical core logging, QAQC sample input 
practices to include field duplicates, blanks and insertion of CRM's and the sample 
collection stage.

Open pit designs for scenario 1.2.1 generate pits to a maximum depth of -12mRL at West 
Uzboy and 84mRL at East Uzboy. Pits extend from an approximate surface level of 230mRL. 
 
Significant quantities and grades of primary resources exist below the optimised pit#35 
designed pit shell, particularly along plunge to the southwest at West Uzboy. 
 
Total CIM classified Measured, Indicated and Inferred primary resources below pit shell #35 
and reported at a greater than 0.4g/t Au cut off are presented in the Table 68 and Table 69

Alhambra Resources Ltd. 
Suite 3A, 4015 – 1st Street SE 
Calgary, Alberta, Canada 
T2G 4X7 
 
Letter of No Material Change 

 
Gentlemen, 
 
A C A Howe International Limited ( ACA Howe) has prepared a report for Alhambra 
Resources Ltd. ("Alhambra") entitled "Scoping Study on the Oxide, Transitional and Primary 
Resources at the Uzboy Gold Deposit, Akmola Oblast, Kazakhstan" (the "Scoping Study").  
The original Scoping Study, dated as of February 27, 2009, is for the open pit development 
upon the oxide, transitional and primary resources at the Uzboy gold project in Kazakhstan.  
The Scoping Study outlines the results of pit optimization and analysis undertaken in August 
and September, 2008, including preliminary economic assessment, selected preliminary pit 
design and reserve estimation based upon updated resource block models completed in June 
2008 with an effective date of December 31, 2007.  This study has now been re-issued as 
Updated Scoping Study on the Oxide, Transitional and Primary Resources at the Uzboy Gold 
Deposit, Akmola Oblast, Kazakhstan and re-dated December 10

th, 
2009. 

 
As an addendum to the Scoping Study, ACA Howe also confirms that ACA Howe has 
performed a review of available current information and made general inquiries of Saga 
Creek Gold Company personnel. Saga Creek Gold Company is Alhambra's wholly owned 
Kazakh entity. Based upon this review, it is ACA Howe's opinion that as of December 2

nd
, 

2009, there has been no material change in the results reported in the Scoping Study, though 
ACA Howe does report the following changes: 
 
1. Since December 31 2007 to October 1 2009, Saga Creek has produced and sold a 

total of approximately 29,000 troy ounces (ozs) of gold.  It is estimated by ACA 
Howe, from information received from Saga Creek personnel, that approximately 
6,000 ozs came from the oxide portion of the mineable reserve of 538,500 ozs and the 
balance of 23,000 ozs from the pre-existing heaps which were under leach at 
December 31 2007 but not included in the mineable pit reserve estimate.  Thus, in 
ACA Howe's view, approximately 1% of the gold contained in the mineable reserve 
has been extracted. 
 

2. The Scoping Study was based on a price of gold of US$850 per troy ounce.  This 
compares to a price of US$1,176 per troy ounce reported on November 27, 2009.

A C A HOWE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED 

3. The operating costs for the Uzboy Gold Deposit as reported in the Scoping Study are 
expressed in US$ while the actual functional currency for the project is the local 
Kazakhstan currency, the Tenge.  For purposes of the Scoping Study the Tenge was 
converted to US$ at 120 Tenge per US$.  Currently, the exchange rate is 150 Tenge 
per US$, a 25% decline in the value of the Tenge. 

 
It is the opinion of ACA Howe that any decrease in value resulting from the gold production 
in the period from December 31, 2007 until October 1, 2009 (point 1 above) is more than 
offset by the increase in value resulting from a higher gold price (point 2 above) and 
decreased operating costs that would be caused by the depreciation of the Kazakhstan Tenge 
in relation to the US$ (point 3 above). 
 
No additional reserves or resources have been estimated or reported.  It is probable that the 
increase in the price of gold (point 2 above), coupled with the depreciation of the Kazakhstan 
Tenge (point 3) would transfer additional measured and indicated resources into the mineral 
reserve category, but ACA Howe has not undertaken this work, 
 
In addition, the following rider has been added at the beginning of Section 4.2 Licences and 
Tenure of the Scoping Study: 
 
"The information contained in this section has been provided by Alhambra Resources 
Limited.  The legal status of the various transactions has not been verified by ACA Howe, 
who are unqualified to make any judgment on legal issues". 
 
Also, the following clarification has been made to the report: 
 
"A scoping study for open pit development upon the oxide, transitional and primary resources 
at the Uzboy gold project, Akmola oblast, Kazakhstan was undertaken by independent 
Geological Consultants ACA Howe International Ltd. 
 
The scoping study outlines the results of pit optimisation and analysis undertaken in August 
and September 2008, including preliminary economic assessment, selected preliminary pit 
design and reserve estimation based upon recently updated resource block models completed 
in June 2008 with an effective date of December 31, 2007". 
 
ACA Howe has made no visits to the site since December 2006. 
 
Yours truly, 
 
 
 
ACA Howe International Limited

APPENDIX 3 
ACA HOWE SITE VISIT TO THE UZBOY GOLD 

PROJECT KAZAKHSTAN 12TH – 15TH 
DECEMBER 2006 

 



 

 
 
 

ACA Howe site visit to the Uzboy Gold Project, Kazakhstan 
12th – 15th December, 2006 

 
 
This note summarises the findings of the Uzboy site visit recently undertaken by James Hogg 
and Galen White. 
 
 
Background 
 
ACA Howe's undertaking; 
 
To review and assess; 
 
 

• The current methods of data collection employed during recent drilling, channelling 
and trenching activities 

• The quality of data collected 
• Any outstanding resource input data issues 
 

 
and as follow up to provide recommendations that will improve data collection systems, 
specific to the Uzboy Gold Deposit and Saga Creek's activities, with the ultimate aim of 
demonstrating that these systems are robust and provide adequate confidence that the resulting 
data will satisfy the requirements of future best practise resource and mine planning activities, 
and that the data generated is of the highest quality so as to be assured, for use in subsequent 
resource estimations and mine planning activities. 
 
 
Areas reviewed; 
 
 

• The geological setting of the deposit 
• Geological Model 
• Drilling, Channelling and Trenching 
• Logging, Sampling and Assaying 
• Database 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 

 
The Geological Setting of the Deposit and Geological Models 
 
Geological overview, regional geological and structural setting is well understood from 
previous studies. 
 
A half day was spent with Dr. Nick LeBoutillier discussing recent developments pertaining to 
local geology and deposit model, structural and geochemical controls, alteration and grade 
distribution characteristics. 
 
Plans and selected sections were reviewed on screen. 
 
Through a discussion of Nick's work, a good understanding of the deposit characteristics have 
been provided to Howe.  It's Howe's opinion that the geological model is well understood and 
will provide for improved accuracy in resource estimation.  Identification and explanation of 
constraining geological boundaries, alteration zonation, and structural characteristics will, it is 
thought provide adequate control for detailed domain interpretation and wireframing, 
particularly for the Uzboy West deposit where Nick's work has been focussed. 
 
Structural controls on grade distribution although recognised, are only moderately understood 
at this time primarily due to the lack of core orientation.  It is imperative that within a 
structurally controlled gold deposit, orientations of the mineralised and equally important non-
mineralised structures are identified through measurements taken on oriented drill core.  
Detailed vein paragenesis (understood to be part of Nick's study) including vein type 
orientation studies will greatly improve the understanding of ore controls within the deposit. 
 
 
Drilling, Channelling and Trenching 
 
Ongoing drilling and previously dug channels and trenches were inspected.  Techniques 
employed for each of these data collection methods are considered sound and reliable. 
 
Collar and downhole survey controls are considered good.  It is noted that the drill core is not 
being marked for orientation. 
 
 
Logging, Sampling and Assaying 
 
For channels and trenches, logging and sampling procedures were discussed and considered 
satisfactory.    
 
At the drill site, core is summary logged and then boxed for transportation to Stepnogorsk for 
processing, logging and sampling.   
 
Once summary logging is done, core trays are secured.  Core movement is minimised by the 
size of the tray core channel, and tight fitting wooden lid. 
 
No geotechnical/geomechanical logging is taking place on site, and although core recoveries 
are reported to be very good overall (approx average 97%), it is best practice to perform 
orientation marking, metre marking, recovery and RQD logging, prior to transportation.  



 

Transportation of the core could result in the disintegration of less competent zones (which 
generally tend to be those of greatest interest!). 
At the core logging facility in Stepnogorsk, logging and sampling procedures were reviewed. 
 
Methods are generally accepted as being satisfactory, however several issues have been noted. 
 

• Core recoveries are calculated using the driller's core blocks only.  It is assumed the 
driller is correct with his drill depth and loss/gain measurements. 

• RQD measurements are not being taken.  In structurally controlled, vein hosted gold 
deposits this is very important data, particularly when considering deep excavation and 
underground mining. 

• Metre marking done on the core boxes and not the core. Any disruption of core within 
the tray during transport or processing may result in inaccuracies with sampling 
intervals. 

• Geotechnical logging and measurement (depth, angle and orientation) of structural 
features such as fractures, foliation and veining isn't being captured due to the core not 
being oriented.  This is crucial information for understanding structural ore controls. 

• 'Operational' geological logging is done independent of Nick's detailed work.   
 
Sampling is performed to a reasonable standard, and the method of cutting core is good.  
However, due to the non-orientation of the drill core, inconsistencies are introduced into the 
system.  Without orientation line control, the core will be sampled randomly along its axis, and 
may well introduce bias to the samples.  Best practice is to sample along the core orientation 
line thus being consistent and selecting a sample perpendicular to the perceived strike of 
mineralisation and mineralised veins etc. 
 
Samples are assigned a number on the geological logging sheet, which are carried over to the 
sample record sheet for dispatch to the lab.  QAQC samples are introduced at the sample batch 
dispatch stage, and listed on the sample record sheet.  QAQC samples use a separate sample 
number sequence to routine samples.  The issue with this method of including QAQC samples 
is that it allows the lab to identify the control samples, increasing the risk of 'sample spotting' 
and possible analytical fraud. 
 
Assay techniques are well understood and considered good.  First pass AAS is performed and 
then follow up Fire Assay for AAS samples of greater than 0.1g/t Au.  Fire Assay is done from 
an approximate 200g sample taken from sample pulps.  These samples are prepared at the 
logging/sample dispatch facility in Stepnogorsk.  The method used for the pulp sampling was 
reviewed, and involved the partial homogenisation of the sample prior to collection by spoon.  
Although considered adequate, improvements to the method of re-sampling, to obtain a more 
representative sample and eliminate risk of contamination, would be to use a riffle splitter. It 
has been demonstrated that a significant amount of gold at the Uzboy deposit is present in 
association with sulphide species. This sulphide material has a tendency to settle at the base of 
sample pulps and may not be represented in the resulting sample sent for fire assay, and as such 
the grade of resulting fire assay analysis may be understating the gold grade. 
 
Comparison studies of AAS versus FA data will be performed to investigate and quantify 
variability between assay methods. 
 
QAQC procedures set up previously by Reg Comeau are being adhered to.  These are well 
documented and considered satisfactory.  As part of the resource update, ACA Howe will 



 

review and perform plot analysis of QAQC data for samples taken since the last resource 
estimation. 
 
It is understood that a comprehensive density database exists and the methodology for the 
measurement of rock densities well documented in previous reports.  Applicable density 
measurements will be determined through domain interpretation and assigning as part of the 
estimation process. 
 
 
Database 
 
Data received and reviewed thus far suggests a logical and robust structure. 
 
Visual inspection of data received to date has been performed and further data requirements 
established during the site visit.  Date requirements include: 
 

• Saga Creek QAQC sample data and internal laboratory QA/QC sample data for recent 
drilling, channels and trenches  

• Fire Assay data for drill holes received by Howe and reported to public are incomplete. 
• Geological logging data for recent drilling. 
• All rock density data with sample location is required. 
• Lab QAQC data for recent drill, channel and trench sample data. 
• Data (including that listed above) for all samples received by Saga Creek up to and 

including December 31st 2006. 
• Collar data should include a column outlining the core type for each hole, as it is 

understood that PQ, HQ and NQ drill diameters are being used.  
 
Further database checks over the following days will be performed and a detail requirements 
list (with explanation) sent to Janna. 
 
 
Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
 
Some of the important issues and recommendations following the recent site visit are given 
below: 
 

• Geology and geological model are being developed and are reasonably well understood, 
particularly for Uzboy West.  However, better understanding can be gained through 
improved drilling and core processing practices such as orienting the core. 

• Recent developments in the geological model and understanding of ore controls will 
allow Howe to better domain the resource data and provide improved accuracy of 
estimations, in particular at Uzboy West. 

• The in depth detail of the study undertaken by Nick LeBoutillier dictates that progress 
through the deposit drill core is slow (17 holes completed to date).  In an effort to apply 
the findings and recent developments in recording of geological data, for each deposit, 
going forward and in a timely manner it is suggested that the 'operational' logging is 
done using a system developed through Nick's recent observations and his logging 
system.  The development and implementation of which can be done under Nick's 
supervision.  The training of suitable staff or additional contractor and use of new 



 

system should be undertaken in 2007.  ACA Howe has suitable templates (and staff) to 
assist in the development and implementation of new systems. 

• It would be pertinent that during Nick's study and possible development of new 
standard logging practices to capture specific data, the development of a rock board is 
done for training and consistency purposes. 

• The lack of drill core orientation is a real and major issue.  Much more information 
could and should be collected from Uzboy drill core given the structural complexities 
that exist at the Uzboy deposit.  Greater accuracy with metre marking, RQD 
measurements, along with performing angle and orientation (alpha/beta) measurements 
of features relative to orientation line and core axis is essential in these deposit types. 

• Core processing activities should be performed on-site prior to the 200km transfer to 
Stepnogorsk.  Transportation of the core could cause breaks and disintegration of less 
competent zones, resulting in loss of information.  Also, any discrepancies between drill 
depth and core loss measurements can be identified and addressed immediately.  ACA 
Howe does have best practice core handling and processing systems available for 
implementation. 

• QAQC samples should be submitted 'blind', as part of the routine sample sequence to 
eliminate risk of spotting.
