Item 3:  Summary 
 
The Sackville Project consists of 8 non-patented mining claims (113 units) and one 
patented claim located 100 km west of Thunder Bay in Adrian, Aldina, Sackville, and 
Marks townships along the Shebandowan volcanic belt. 
 
This report describes the drilling program performed between Oct.24, 2009 - Dec.15, 
2009 and Jan.18, 2010 to Feb.9, 2010 by GLR Resources Inc. (GLR) and RJK 
Explorations Ltd located on mining claims 4219074 - 4219075, 
4244451 – 4244454, & 4244456 – 4244457 in Aldina, Marks, Adrian, and Sackville 
Townships, District of Thunder Bay, Ontario.   
 
The objective was to test wider possibilities for sources of massive sulphide boulders 
(zinc-lead-copper-gold-silver) in three areas of the property.  These included a felsic 
volcanic horizon with TDEM and IP anomalies to the north.  The boulders are known as 
the Boomer, Calvert boulders that were 10 tons and 15 tons, respectively and found in 
Aldina Township.  The Boomer boulder (southernmost) is predominantly pyrite and the 
Calvert boulder (northernmost) is comprised of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena 
hosted in felsic agglomeratic volcanic rocks within a matrix of cherty lapilli tuff. Grade of 
boulder samples are presented in Table 3. (Calvert boulder: 12% Zn, 0.26%Cu, 
1.70%Pb, 214.3 g/t Ag, 3.51 g/t Au) 
 
The work carried out consisted of drilling activities, core logging, assaying, soil 
sampling, line cutting, and geophysical surveying.  Drilling took place between Oct.24, 
2009 - Dec.15, 2009 and Jan.18, 2010 to Feb.9, 2010.  Ten holes were drilled at the 
Sackville Project for a total of 1908 meters.  An Induced Polarization survey covering 
21.75km was executed by Pierre Simone of GeoSig Inc. on the Stares Property from 
Oct. 15, 16, and 17th 2009 and Oct. 27 and 28th 2009.  This survey detected 
approximately 14 anomalies.  Also a geochemical soil survey was carried on the 
Sackville property with lines spaced at 200m with samples taken every 25m.  This 
survey covered approximately 21.75 km and was done Nov. 15th – 30th 2009 and Feb. 
1st – 5th 
    

2010. 

Core samples selected for assaying were split in half with a diamond saw blade and one 
half was submitted for chemical assaying at Accurrassay Laboratories in Thunder Bay, 
ON.  The core and rock samples were processed using procedure ALFA1 and 
AL1CPMA; 67 core samples and 29 rock samples were assayed for WR and MA;  305 
core samples and 54 rock samples were analysed for AUMA.   Also, 62 soil samples 
were submitted for chemical assaying at Actlabs in Thunder Bay, ON.   
 
The highest value obtained in drill core samples was of 6512 ppm Zn (0.65%) over 1m 
in hole S09-03 within a 1m zone of Zn mineralization with a weight average of 6512 
ppm (0.65%).  The highest weighted average was 4483.31ppm Zn (0.45%) in hole S10-
08 over a width of 13m.  The highest in the soil samples 



was 147 ppm at 283341E 5368181N.  The majority of anomalous values were caused 
by a significant graphitic zone with abundant pyritization.  Often these types of zones 
act as a cap for massive sulphide deposits which are in close proximity.  The deposit 
type in this area is thought to be VMS due to the geology of the boulders found in the 
Aldina Township.   
 
Review of drill hole, geochemical, and geophysical data suggests more work should be 
carried out on this property to better define areas of significant mineralization. 
 
It is recommended that a detailed enzyme leach soil sampling campaign should be 
carried out over the Sackville Property focussing on areas where high zinc values have 
been found and over IP anomalies underlain by felsic volcanic rocks that have not been 
tested.  As well drilling should be done in areas south of the known graphitic zone and 
areas of anomalous geochemical results.  
 
The total estimated cost of diamond drilling, soil sampling, and prospecting is estimated 
to cost $252,450.

Item 6: Property Description and Location 
 
The Sackville property is a contiguous assembly of 8 non-patented mining claims and 1 
patented claim (114 units, 3944 hectares).  The claims occupy parts of Adrian, Aldina, 
Sackville and Marks Townships in the Thunder Bay (TB) Mining Division, District of 
Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.  Relevant Mining Land Tenure Maps are Plan G -0640, 
0641, and 0685, respectively (NAD 83).   The area is covered by the National 
Topographic System 52A/5 quadrant (ed. 4 NAD 27).  Magnetic declination for this area 
is 2° 41' (west declination) for the year 2010.  Figure 1 locates the project within 
Northern Ontario in the Thunder Bay, Lake Superior area of northwest Ontario.  Figure 
2 shows the outline of the contiguous claim group, worked claims, Aldina Rd and its 
intersections with other logging roads for assessment filing purposes.  The claim group 
is centred at UTM 5367597mN and 284556mE (Zone 16, NAD 27) and Latitude 48° 25' 
28.73"N and Longitude 89° 54' 44.21"W.  The maximum extents are 4.8 km north-south 
and 4.5 km east-west. Figure 3 locates the project area geologically on map 2664 
Thunder Bay map sheet. Figure 4,5 & 6 details the specific claims, local geology, drill 
locations, and a magnetometer survey.  Table 1 lists particulars of the claim holdings, 
annual work requirements; and respective interests of GLR Resources Inc. (GLR) and 
RJK Explorations Ltd. (RJK).  The unpatented claims were recorded from 2008 to 2010 
with earliest due date on June 10, 2010 and the latest due date on Dec. 10, 2011.  
Annual assessment totals $45,200 to maintain the maturity of the holdings.

                Item 7: Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and  

            physiography 
 
All season, gravel road access is available via Boreal Road. This traverses west from 
Secondary Highway 590 to Km 10.5, Aldina East Road (63 km from Kakabeka Falls, 
ON) and beyond. Aldina West Road, a seasonal (winter-plowing required) sandy road 
provides generally good vehicle access to a ski-doo trail which provides access to 
eastern side of the grid.  The Boreal Road- Hwy 590 intersection is 13 km west and 
(then) south of the Hwy 590-TransCanada Highway 11-17 intersection.  Kakabeka Falls, 
Ontario only 2 km to the south of this turn (on Highway 11-17) is the closest town. 
Known as the "Niagara of the North" for its principal tourist attraction, it is also central to, 
and partly dependent upon, surrounding forest resources.  A hydroelectric facility and 
railway are  
major infrastructure assets of this community.  Close proximity to the city of Thunder 
Bay, 29 km to the east, also makes this locale attractive to commuters.  With  a 
population of 149,063 (metropolitan area, 2006 Census), Thunder Bay hosts a major 
airport, CN and CP rail lines, Ontario's largest port, and shipping service to the Great 
Lakes, St. Lawrence Seaway and beyond.  Bulk commodities handled here are grain, 
coal, potash, forest products, manufactured and dimension goods.  By surface, Thunder 
Bay is 1387 km from Toronto, Ontario; 700 km from Winnipeg, Manitoba; 581 km from 
Minneapolis, Minnesota;  
and 1047 km from Chicago, Illinois, USA.  Otherwise, these major centres are a  
short, 1-2 hour flight away.  Thunder Bay also has suppliers, government services and a 
university (Lakehead) which also support mineral exploration and some mining needs.  

        
Located in the Severn Upland physiographic unit of the James Region, Precambrian 
Canadian Shield (Carter, M.W., 1990; Thurston, P.C. 1991), the property is generally 
surrounded by landforms which include bedrock knob and 



plateau (metavolcanic-felsic intrusive- related); glaciolacustrine plain (low relief); ground 
moraine (subdued relief, metavolcanic bedrock), glaciofluvial (low lying) and organic 
terrain types (lowest relief, devoid of outcrop). Elevation varies from 440 to 570 m in the 
area of the worked claims.  Steep hills, deep valleys and likely deep overburden are the 
result of a terminal moraine.  This glacial deposit provides sand and gravel resources at 
a number of pits (excluded from mineral rights).  Drainage and topography slope from 
the west and from the east toward the north-flowing Serpent Creek. Portions of Serpent 
Creek are designated as "cold water" habitat- a classification which tightly restricts 
fording and operations (permits must be applied for in advance of such operations). 
Much of the property has been harvested for timber.  Remaining forest cover includes 
poplar, black spruce, balsam fir, birch; young jackpine and poplar regrowth.    
 
Temperatures in the Kakabeka Falls/ Thunder Bay area average 2.5˚C and range from 
an extreme minimum of –41.1˚C (January record) to the extreme maximum of +40.3˚C 
(August record).  Averaged daily temperatures recorded by Environment Canada are –
14.8˚ (January) and +24.2˚C (July).  Weather conditions on the property are notably 
cooler (e.g. 5˚ in winter).  Moderation of climate by Lake Superior is sometimes visible 
as a "frost-line" at higher elevations and en-route to the property.   
  
 
Item 8:  History 
 
The Sackville Property was formerly known as the Stares.  Claims belonging to this 
property were dropped and in 2008-2010; new claims were obtained in the vicinity of the 
old Stares Property and renamed Sackville Property. 
 
In his (NI43-101) report to GLR Resources and RJK Explorations, Bottrill (2003) 
chronicles and details the history of the property from 1956-2002 (p. 10, p. 22).  The 
region around the former Dawson road and present Highway 11-17 has seen sporadic 
mapping (from 1872) and exploration (largely for iron deposits, from 1901) with 
heightened activity from 1901-1925.  The property was explored for iron between 1950 
and 1961.  Limited prospecting and geophysical surveys in 1991 and 1993 
(magnetometer, VLF-EM, government airborne electromagnetic/AEM) included those of 
American base-metal producer, Asarco Exploration Company (unpublished). Newly-cut 
forestry roads by Stares Contracting, led to the 1996 discovery of sulphide-rich float 
(0.6% Cu, 12% Zn, 4.4% Pb, 359 g/t Ag and 5.52 g/t Au).  Exploration by Cumberland 
Resources in 1996 and 1997 included line cutting (additional to ASARCO's existing 
grid), geological mapping; soil geochemistry, magnetometer, VLF-EM, Pulse DEEPEM 
(PEM) and drilling (9 holes) - without success.  As part of a wider, Shebandowan 
greenstone belt, and project-area specific surveys, surface till and humus samples were 
taken by Bajc (1999, 2001). 
 
 
 



Further exploration, from 1999, by GLR (or predecessor Greater Lenora Resources) 
and RJK included  time-domain IP, trenching and discovery of heavily-oxidized bedrock 
mineralization and(1999); initial drilling (winter, spring 2000); and discovery of Boomer 
and Calvert massive sulphide boulders (10 and 15 t, respectively, summer 2000. The 
Boomer boulder (southernmost) is predominantly pyrite and the Calvert boulder 
(northernmost) is comprised of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena. Grade of boulder 
samples are presented in Table 3.  This was followed in 2000-2001 by line-cutting 
(main 100 line km grid and 30 deg. local grid, 7 line-km); geophysical (magnetic, IP), 
prospecting, mapping, geochemical surveys; stripping and trenching; and optioning of 
the 15-claim Sackville property).  Additional boulders were discovered near a previous 
pit (and near L 20+00W) in the summer of 2001.  Mechanical stripping and discovery of 
more mineralized outcrop, led to additions to the property, to line-cutting, magnetic 
surveys and channel sampling; to horizontal loop EM (HLEM), lithogeochemical, humus 
geochemistry surveys. The winter 2001- summer 2002 tested the property extensively 
with an enzyme leach geochemical survey (lab-extraction from till samples) and drilling 
of enzyme-leach, magnetic and IP anomalies.   
 
 
Bottrill (2003) also discussed results, specific techniques and limitations of the various 
detection methods employed on the property.  Limitations of previous drilling were also 
reviewed.  By 2002, cumulative diamond drilling, with Cumberland Resources previous 
9-hole (1552 m) campaign and GLR-RJK's 63-hole (6916 m) totalled 8468 m.  Follow-
up drilling (5 holes, 125-175m depth) was recommended close (50-200m) to the known 
mineralized horizon.  This was based on the possibilities that down-plunge extensions 
may lie west and north of the original discovery zone (and shallow drilling about this); 
and that previous drilling in this direction was too shallow and too widely-spaced given 
suspected faulting of the host rock and related stratigraphy.   
 
 
Following the 2003 report the companies decided to proceed with an additional IP 
surveys (2005, 2006), airborne time-domain EM (TDEM) and magnetic surveys and 
drilling on Claims 1215006, 1215007, 125008, 125009 and 1215056 (MS04-01 to 
MS04-06) from L 12W 17+00N to L22W 4+00S.  Specifics of the 2004 program are as

Zinc concentrations were generally in lowest, orders-of-magnitude ppm range.  Higher 
values in MS04-03, MS-04-04 were found. MS-05-05 reported around 1% Zn, but these 
were in short intervals (0.5-1m, Parker 2004).   
 
In 2005-2006 GLR Resources and RJK Explorations drilled 9 holes totalling 826m.  
Drilling of three widely separated targets on the Stares option allowed testing of broader 
base metal potential on an extensive property.  While mineralization was low, it was at 
least provided other indications and perspective on potential away from the discovery 
zone.   The northern target zone produced somewhat higher amounts of zinc and 
copper than the west extension.  One hole, SC05 – 08 was drillied on the present claim 
4244451.    
  
 
Item 9:  Geological Setting 
 
Regional Geology 
 
An extensive discussion of the geological and tectonic setting of the Stares property 
was provided by Bottrill (2003).  The described setting is within the Shebandowan 
greenstone belt of the western Wawa Subprovince in the Archean-era Superior 
Province, Precambrian Shield.  Further description of the regional to local geology 
focuses here on some key characteristics of geological systems at various scales, from 
pluton to assemblage to sub-province and to geological province scale which may 
provide geological insight to mineral distributions at a property and drill project scale. 
 
 
Within the Shebandowan belt volcanic cycles consist of a lower sequence of (tholeiitic) 
basalt flows and an upper sequence of andesite, dacite, and rhyolite (calc-alkalic) flows 
(Williams et al 1991).  This bi-modal volcanic cycle is accompanied by abundant mafic 
sills and differentiated gabbro-anorthosite plutons.  Stratigraphic units are near-vertical.  
These volcanics – including some 



magnesian (komatiitic) units can be overlain, unconformably by sedimentary and 
volcanic rocks that resemble rocks of the Timiskaming Group near Kirkland Lake, ON in 
the Abitibi belt.  Sediments include metamorphosed equivalents of wacke, minor 
conglomerate and iron formation. The broader Wawa Subprovince is described as a 
"sea" of granitoid (intrusive) rocks with well-defined greenstone belts such as the 
Shebandowan belt.  Shearing often masks stratigraphic and structural relationships 
between lithological units.  Mineralization associated with the Shebandowan greenstone 
includes iron, nickel-copper sulphide (Shebandowan Mine, in a komatiitic flow unit) 
copper, copper-gold, copper-zinc and gold- in short a wide range of commodities 
generally found in the Superior Province.  Consequently, the Shebandowan greenstone 
belt is not particularly distinctive in this respect or at this scale- neither are the 
associated processes. 
 
 
At a much larger scale- 2 million square km- the Superior Province is differentiated into 
plutonic, granite-greenstone, metasedimentary and gneissic subprovinces (Card and 
Poulsen, 1998). This might offer little else than a modal analysis of igneous, mixed 
igneous-supracustal, sedimentary and metamorphic domains- with one exception.  The 
granite-greenstone sub-provinces contain virtually all of the economically important 
mineral deposits of the Superior Province- Zn-Cu-Pb, lode gold, vein copper, magmatic 
nickel sulphides, Cr-Ti-V, iron-ore deposits of the Algoma type, and rare-metal 
pegmatite deposits including lithium and tantalum.   While not usually discussed in the 
same context as lateral variation of the provinces, subprovinces, assemblages and local 
geology- vertical differentiation might also be be considered. By geophysical inference 
(gravity, seismic characteristics), greenstone belts can have depths of 5 km with roots to 
7 to 12 km while metasedimentary and granitic rocks may, by virtue of lower density, 
may show negative anomalies.   An upper layer approximately 10 km thick layer of 
greenschist-amphibolite (metamorphic facies) rocks appears to be cut by plutons and 
mainly steep-dipping discordant structures.  Below this is an intermediate plutonic 
(tonalite-granodiorite-remnant supracrustal rocks) layer, 15 km thick, with shallow-
dipping (seismically reflective), ductile structures.  Further below are granulite-facies 
rocks (plutonic and supracrustal) that extends to an average depth of 40 km.   
 
 
While geological settings and associated models may vary, lithologies, associated 
processes and potentials in granite-greenstone (greenschist to amphibolite) in as little 
as a 5 to 10 km radius might be considered as geologically and spatially significant- 
from property scale to Superior Province-wide scale.  Within a local geological setting, 
distribution of bimodal volcanic rocks - among the most significant hosts of Archean 
mineral deposits- provide an additional focus.  A mineralized "system"- might therefore 
significantly include some combination of, metavolcanic-metasedimentary rocks 
(greenschist-amphibolite metamorphic-grade, "greenstones"); specifically bi-modal 
volcanics; mafic sills; other intrusives or plutons.   
 



Local Geology 
 
The local stratigraphic sequence is characteristic of many greenstone belts in areas 
associated with volcanic hosted base and precious metal mineralization. 
This sequence is primarily a basal iron tholeiite basalt overlain by variable thicknesses 
of felsic volcanic rocks and in turn by a thick sequence of turbiditic graywackes.   
 
The felsic rocks are predominantly rhyolites which can be further divided into a 
younging sequence from subaqueous quartz-phyric high-silica rhyolites upwards to 
progressively more subaerial quartz-feldspar phyric rhyolite tuffs. The basal high-silica 
rhyolites include thinly bedded ignimbrite units which include basal tuff-breccia to 
agglomeratic horizons with similar coarse fragmental textures to those seen in sulphide 
mineralization. The tops of these units are finely laminated and graded ash-tuffs. 
 
 Additional signs of probable subaerial volcanism include distinctive phreatic breccias 
restricted to single horizons in highly siliceous ash tuffs. 
Throughout the sequence there are abundant ironstones and cherty tuffites, the latter 
being more abundant in the rhyolite units. The ironstones include chert-magnetic 
jasperoids as well as magnetite-silicate (amphibole-garnet) facies. The distribution of 
the different ironstones facies corresponds to probable 
water depths and each type is associated with a correspondingly appropriate rock type 
consistent with the appropriate water depth. The iron-oxide rich units are associated 
with the subaerial units, whereas separate pyretic and carbonaceous chert tuffites are 
located in progressively more subaqueous hosts. This facies distribution may reflect an 
original volcanic topography with a volcanic high in the area around the known sulphide 
mineralization progressively deepening to the north and east into the turbiditic 
graywacke basin. 
 
These units are deformed and metamorphosed. The intensity of deformation is different 
among the various rocks types, with some such as the original mudstones showing the 
development of schistosity, whereas, by contrast, units such as the rhyolite ignimbrites, 
are almost internally pristine and mostly show 
brittle failure in locally closely-spaced faults. The ironstones, especially magnetite-
silicate facies ironstones are very finely laminated and unlike the many banded 
jasperoid ironstones show none of the classical internal folding. 
 
The overall structure on the property is a southern isoclinally folded, steeply dipping 
overturned antiform, with the central area a corresponding synform underlain by the 
turbitic graywackes, with a further antiform in the northern part of the property. Each of 
these folds have east-west axial planes. They appear to have been re-folded around 
later northeast striking axes providing the oroclinal form of the folds, convex to the 
northeast. To a large extent the interpretation of the property geology has been based 
on the 1991 OGS airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey, and the relationship 
between the local geology on the 



grid area with the ground magnetic data. The fold pattern that is very apparent on the 
grid has been used as a model for interpretation of the entire property. 
 
The only major faults which cross and off-set the units within the fold are orientated 
northeast and appear from the differences on either side to be original basin margin 
faults active during volcanism and sedimentation. 
 
Several rock types were encountered during the 2009 – 2010 drilling program can be 
seen on Figure 4 which include mafic volcanics (green), gabbro (blue), intermediate 
volcanic (bright green) that are mainly rhyolites.  Not shown on the map is chert and 
graphite which was also seen during mapping and drilling.  The eastern and 
northeastern section of the grid consisted mainly of rhyolites with clastic sediments near 
the southeast.  A section of gabbro can be seen on the northwest and southwest.  All 
units strike NW-SE with the majority of the area being mafic volcanics.  
 
     
 
Item 10: Deposit Type 
 
In exploring recent and past work of the Sackville Property the geological deposit type 
to describe mineralization is massive sulphide.  Volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) 
deposits, also known as volcanic-associated, rhyolite-volcanic-hosted, and 
volcanosedimentary-hosted massive sulphide deposits.  These deposits are major 
sources of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ag, and Au, and significant sources for Co, Sn, Se, Mn, Cd, In, 
Bi, Te, Ga, and Ge. 
 
They are discovered in submarine volcanic terranes that range in age from 3.4 Ga to 
actively forming deposits in modern seafloor environments. The most common feature 
among all types of VMS deposits is that they are formed in extensional tectonic settings, 
including both oceanic seafloor spreading and arc environments.  They are a natural 
product of hydrothermal activity associated with submarine volcanic activity.  Seawater 
circulates through active volcanic rocks becomes heated and picks up small quanities of 
metals from these rocks. The heated seawater then spews onto the seafloor as gysers 
and sulphide minerals precipitate. 
 
Some indications of VMS deposits which can be seen on the Sackville property and 
surrounding area include; boulders of massive sulfide,   alterartion (chloritization, 
seritization, and pyritization) although seritization is very minor, 
 and main rock types are volcanic and felsic. 
 
The boulders are known as the Boomer and Calvert boulders that were 10 t and 15 t, 
respectively that trend north – northeast at 200m apart. The Boomer boulder 
(southernmost) is predominantly pyrite and the Calvert boulder (northernmost) is 
comprised of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena hosted in felsic agglomeritic 
volcanic rocks with a cherty lapilli matrix. Grade of the Calvert, Boomer, and 



Stares boulder samples are presented in Table 3.  The Calvert c boulder had a grade of 
15.99 Zn%, 0.24 Cu%, 2.06 Pb%, 0.016 Cd%, 192 Ag g/t, and 3.5 Au g/t. 
 
The ice direction is 190° which aligns the massive sulphide boulders with the area of 
drilling on the Sackville property.

Item 11: Mineralization 
 
Mineralization occurring in the drill core and outcrop on the Sackville Property is mainly 
disseminated pyrite (as well as stringers) with very minor chalcopyrite.  The majority of 
mineralization occurred in the rhyolite and graphitic units that ranged from 5 – 30%.  As 
well felsic rocks with classic mill-rock were encountered during drilling on the east side 
of the property.   
 
 
Item 12: Exploration 
 
All exploration on the Sackville property was carried out by the author under the 
supervision of Fred Sharpley, P.Geo.  The work was carried out according to industry 
standards.  From the years 2009 – 2010 a total of $491,745.14 of exploration has been 
spent on the claims.  The type of exploration and expenditures are itemized in TABLE

Geophysical Work 
 
On behalf of GLR Resources Inc. GeoSig carried out an Induced Polarization survey 
from Oct. 15, 16, and 17th 2009 and Oct. 27 and 28th

 

 2009 on the Sackville property.  
The survey was done on a NS grid and NE-SW grid with lines spaced at 200 m covering 
approximately 21.75 km and partially covered claim blocks; 4219074, 4219075, 
4244451, 4244452, and 4244453.    The IP survey was done using dipole-dipole array, 
in time domain mode with a standard 2 seconds ON, 2 seconds OFF.  The dipole-dipole 
ran with a=25m electrode spacing and N=1 to 6.  Readings were taken every 25m and 
stainless steel pin electrodes were used for the receiver to improve the signal to noise 
ratio. 

14 anomalies were located over the grid area with the strongest anomalies on lines 22, 
24, 26, & 28 E and lines 20, 22, & 24 N.  6 of the 14 anomalies were drilled.   These 
anomalies are seen on FIGURES 15 – 18.  As well GeoSig provided maps of 
chargeability, resistivity, and metal factor. 
 
 
Geochemical Surveying 
 
A geochemical soil survey of Au by atomic absorption and Aqua Regia ICP was carried 
out on the Sackville property on a portion of NS grid and NE-SW grid with lines spaced 
at 200 m covering approximately 21.75 km (FIGURE 19 & 19a).  The soil survey was 
done using a hand held auger with the majority of samples taken at 25m intervals and a 
depth that reaches the B – horizon.  Clear Ziploc bags were labelled showing sample 
number, location, and line number, then sample were placed in the bag. 62 Samples 
were sent to ACTLabs, Thunder Bay, ON for analysis  using packages; Code 1A2-Tbay 
Au-Fire Assay AA which used 30g samples and Code 1E3-Tbay Aqua Regia 
ICP(AQUAGEO) which used 0.5g samples and a 3:1 ratio HCL acid to Nitrate acid for 
the leaching process. 
 
Samples were analysed for Au, Ag, Cd, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, 
Ca, Co, Cr, Fe, Ga, Hg, K, La, Mg, Na, P, S, Sb, Sc, Sr, Ti, Te, Tl, U, V, W, Y, and Zr.

The Geochemical results for the elements of interest Au, Ag, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn are 
presented in Table 5 which represents values received in parts per billion for Au and 
parts per million for the remaining elements.  Some anomalous values occurred on line 
8 and line 2 on the western portion of the property.

Item 14: Sampling Method and Approach 
     
 
Sampling Methodology 
 
Rock cores and rock samples were submitted for chemical assaying at Accurrassay 
laboratories (Thunder Bay, ON).  Core samples were split in half with a diamond saw 
blade, one half was placed in a sample bag and the other in the core box for reference.  
The majority of samples were at 1m intervals, the minmum sample was 0.4m and the 
maximum sample was 1.59m.  All samples were processed, crushed, and sieved.  Soil 
samples were submitted for chemical assaying at ActLabs (Thunder Bay, ON). 
 
 
 
Item 15:  Sampling Preparation, Analysis, and Security 
 
Core samples were split in half with a diamond saw blade, one half was placed in a 
sample bag and the other in the core box for reference.   Once placed in the bag 
sample bags were labelled by sample number as well a sample tag was placed in the 
bag.  Samples were then taken to the lab by the onsite geologist and the remaining core 
was stored in a secure area that cannot be entered without a key.  The core and rock 
samples were processed for at Accurrassay laboratories in Thunder Bay, ON using 
procedures ALFA1 and AL1CPMA; 67 core samples and 29 rock samples were 
assayed for WR and MA; 305 core samples and 54 rock samples were analysed for 
AUMA using 30g samples.   Also, 62 soil samples were submitted for chemical assaying 
at Actlabs in Thunder Bay, ON;  62 samples were analysed using packages; Code 1A2-
Tbay Au-Fire Assay AA and Code 1E3-Tbay Aqua Regia ICP(AQUAGEO).   
 
 
 
Item 16:  Data Verification 
 

 
Quality Control 

Blanks, standards, and duplicates were submitted during sampling.  The blank is a 
marble piece purchased at the local hardware store which was inserted every 20 
samples. The standard OREAS 37 was provided by Analytical Solutions Ltd. and 
contains Au, As, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, TI, Zn, and S.  A standard was submitted at the end of 
every 20th

 

 sample interval.  Also duplicate of assayed samples was done every 20 
samples.  

 Accurassay Lab took both duplicates and replicates of samples submitted.  Duplicates 
were taken at approximately every 10 samples which took 2 cuts 



taken off 1 sample.  Replicates were taken every 60 samples which split 1 sample 
twice.  
 
 
Item 17:  Adajacent Properties 
 
Adajacent properties are not significant in evaluating the Sackville property. 
 
 
Item 18:  Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 
This item is not applicable. 
 
 
Item 19: Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
 
Mineral resources and reserves are not yet evident on the property. 
 
Item 20:  Other Relevent Data and Information 
 
The Sackville Property previously named Stares Property on adjacent claims was 
previously compiled in a technical report by Terrence J. Bottrill (Bottril Geological 
Services in September 2003).  
 
 
Item 21:  Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
The drilling program at the Sackville Property consisted of 10 drill holes completed in 
two areas; Eastern and Western grid sections. It is interpreted that areas with magnetic 
lows are underlain by felsic volcanic rocks (Figure 5). 
 
Eastern Section 
 
The five drill holes were drilled 030° and one drill hole at 330° to intersect NW-SE 
trending IP anomalies defined by induced polarization survey.  Significant Zn 
mineralization above 5000 ppm was intersected in two holes (S09-04 and S10-08).  The 
mineralization over 5000 ppm was narrow (2-3m) bands except in hole S10-08 there 
was an intersection of 13m over 4000 ppm Zn. 
 
There are anomalous Zn values in several drill holes intersecting IP anomalies.  The 
anomalies were caused by a significant graphitic zone that was abundant in 
disseminated pyrite.   
 
 
 
 



Western Section 
 
Four holes were drilled at north-south, 270° and 030° strike (S09-01 to S09 – 03, and 
S10-09).   These holes were drilled to intersect NW-SE trending IP anomalies as well as 
a previously drilled hole with high silver mineralization as well as an area with 
anomalous geochemical values from soil sampling.   
 
The drill holes were low in silver however anomalous zinc was seen in S09-03 near the 
previously drilled hole (764 ppm Cu (0.08%) and 6512 ppm Zn (0.65%) over 1m (26m – 
27m)).  There was a lack of mineralization in S10 – 09 although soil sampling showed 
otherwise.  This may be due to a river system to the north of the drill hole which the 
mineralization leached out of and into the soil or that the drill hole did not cut the 
mineralized zone.  
 
Graphitic zones often act as a cap for a VMS deposit and can be found in close 
proximity to a VMS deposit.  The bedrock source of the mineralized Boomer and Calvert 
boulders is not yet found.  It is thought the felsic volcanic belt in the Sackville and Adrian 
Townships is the source of the bedrock.  This source  coincides with  the ice direction of 
190° where the boulders were discovered in the Aldina township. 
 
Item 22:  Recommendations 
 
Although there is a lack of most base metal mineralization on the eastern section of the 
property grid there is significant Zn mineralization in select holes which requires a 
detailed soil sampling program to be carried out over the eastern grid especially 
focussing in those areas of anomalous IP anomalies underlain by felsic volcanic rocks 
that have not yet been tested, areas near contacts between sedimentary, felsic, and 
mafic rocks.  Also more soil sampling, a deeper drill hole should be done near hole S09-
04 and S09-05 which intersected classic "mill rock".  Also, drilling should be carried out 
to the south of drill hole S09 – 07.  This section shows the graphitic zone as well as 
cherty sections throughout. 
 
The western section of the grid was drilled very little.  It is recommended that a more 
detailed soil sampling program be carried out in this area to determine areas of interest 
for drilling focussing on the previously drilled hole with high silver values and the 
anomalous IP anomalies underlain by felsic volcanic rocks that have not yet been 
tested.   
 
The cost of the proposed budget to carry out these recommendations is outlined in 
Table 8.
