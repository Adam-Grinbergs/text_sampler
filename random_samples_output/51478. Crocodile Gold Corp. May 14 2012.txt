1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Stawell Gold Mines (SGM) is located in the Australian State of Victoria, 250km northwest of 

Melbourne and 2km from the township of Stawell 

Stawell is a historic goldfield that produced 2.7 million ounces of gold between 1853 and 1926 from 

both alluvial and hard rock sources. In 1981 SGM was re-opened by the Western Mining 

Corporation (WMC)/Central Norseman Gold joint venture with commencement of the Magdala 

decline. By 1984 the operation had expanded with the construction of a processing facility and 

subsequent commencement of an open cut operation at the Wonga mine (2 kilometres south of 

Magdala). The Wonga Open Cut operated from 1984 to 1987 and produced 778,847 tonnes 

recovering 69,159 ounces of gold. The Davis Open Cut operated from 1987 to 1989 and produced 

154,525 tonnes for 8,992 recovered ounces of gold. 

In December 1992 the operation was acquired in a 50/50 joint venture by Mining Project Investors 

(MPI) Pty Ltd and Pittston Mineral Ventures (Pittston). The joint venture continued until 2004 during 

which time there was a record of continued exploration success with discovery of additional 

mineralized deposits that were subsequently mined. 

In February 2004 MPI acquired the Pittston 50% share of the project.  In November 2004 a de-

merger of the MPI gold business came into effect, and Leviathan Resources Ltd was floated in 

December 2004. The resource drilling into the Golden Gift initially identified seven areas of 

mineralisation offset from each other due to late faulting. From the increased geological 

understanding of the Golden Gift deposit, it was clear in the mine planning process that two declines 

were required, the GG5 and GG3 declines, to access the ore zones for continuity of supply. 

In January 2007 Perseverance acquired Leviathan Resources Ltd. Perseverance was acquired by 

Northgate on the 18th of February, 2008. Northgate was acquired by AuRico in October, 2011.  

Crocodile Gold completed the acquisition of SGM from AuRico on May 4th, 2012. 

The Stawell Goldfield is located in the western Stawell Zone of the Lachlan Fold Belt.  

Interpretations from the Victorian Geological Survey present a thin skinned tectonics model where 

the Moyston Fault is an east dipping basal detachment which has juxtaposed higher metamorphic 

grade rocks of the Stawell Zone against lower grade Cambrian rocks of the Delamerian Glenelg 

Zone. The west dipping Stawell Fault, Coongee Break and other parallel west dipping faults 

represent back thrusts from the Moyston Fault.  The Stawell-Wildwood corridor therefore 

represents a significant structural high in an up-thrown block of deeper stratigraphy between the 

Coongee Break and Pleasant Creek Fault. 

Intruded into this sequence are the Stawell Granite and a number of felsic and mafic intrusions.  The 

stratigraphy at Stawell is divided into three principal units: Magdala Basalt, Albion Formation and 

Leviathan Formation.  The dominant feature at Stawell is the 1.2km wide doubly plunging northwest 

striking Magdala Basalt dome. The Magdala Basalt is made up of a series of basalt noses, interrupted 

to be flow sheets which dip to the southwest and plunge to the northwest. Areas of sedimentation 

are present between the basalt noses (interpreted flow sheets) and are locally termed 'waterloos'. 

The data on which this updated Mineral Resource and Mineral reserve statement is based has been 

collected utilising the quality systems as detailed in the previous document, Technical Report for 



 

4 

 

Stawell Gold Mine, Victoria Australia (28 March 2008). There have been no changes to the very high 

standards of data collection and storage utilised at SGM and the assay quality is supported by 

QA/QC documentation and verifiable data. Data management systems are in place to ensure long 

term security of all geological information collected on site. 

The gold grade estimates are based on good quality assay datasets of diamond drillcore that has 

been spatially located, sampled and assayed using sound industry standard practices.  

There is available and extensive coverage of diamond drilling reaching a drill spacing of 15m X 15m 

in areas that are subject to grade control drilling. Additionally face mapping information and "sludge 

sample" holes logged for geology are available to construct geological models for all Mineral 

Resource areas. The key control on Mineral Resource estimation is accurate definition of the 

constraining geological models.  Estimation of grade within the domains, whilst still very important, is 

of secondary importance to the first order geological domaining.  The geological personnel have a 

sound understanding of the mineralized system and good practices in place to ensure quality models 

are produced. 

The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves as at 30 December 2011 are given in the tables below.

Notes: 

1. All Ore Reserves have been estimated in accordance with the JORC Code and have been reconciled to CIM 

Standards as prescribed by National Instrument 43-101. 

2. Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves. 

3. Mineral Reserves were estimated using the following economic parameters:  

a. Gold price of AUD$1300/oz  

b. Cut-off Grade applied was variable for underground depending upon width, mining method and ground 

conditions.  

4. Wonga surface and Magdala surface above 130mRL and above a nominal 0.8g/t Au cut-off 

5. For the Mineral Reserves estimate, the Qualified Person is Neil Schunke. His details and qualifications can be seen 

in Section 28 of this report. 

6. Mineral Reserves are rounded to 1,000 tonnes, 0.01 g/t Au and 1,000 ounces. Minor discrepancies in summations 

may occur due to rounding. 

Reconciliation of Mineral Reserves for the calendar year 2011 show that an additional 4% tonnes at 

approximately 11% lower grade combined for 7% less contained gold being delivered to the 

processing plant than was defined in the Mineral Reserve for the ore blocks mined. 

Mineral Resource estimation methodologies remain consistent with industry practice with the 

majority of the current Mineral Resource estimated using 3D block modelling methodologies with 

gold grades estimated by ordinary kriging.  Recently all Mineral Resource models have been 

externally audited by geostatistical consultants to provide additional checks on the quality of the 

estimation processes used at SGM. A component of the 31 December 2011 Mineral Resource 

estimate remains based upon manual 2D estimations. There is sufficient production history and 

reconciliation information to support these estimates. 



 

6 

 

Recommendations have been made to continue with the proposed exploration, resource definition 

and mine geological programs for 2012. It is the author's opinion there remains sufficient 

prospectivity within the Stawell tenements to warrant this exploration activity for 2012 and beyond.

2 INTRODUCTION 

This technical report has been prepared for Crocodile Gold Corporation (Crocodile); the beneficial 

owner of Stawell Gold Mines (SGM). Crocodile is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (CRK:TSX) 

and has acquired Stawell Gold Mines.  

This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Instrument 43-

101 (NI 43-101) standard and updates material changes to the Mineral Resource and Mineral 

Reserve position as of 30 December 2011. 

The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve estimate for SGM is a summation of a number of 

individual estimates for various ore bodies or various geographically constrained areas. All of these 

estimates are contained within the Mining Lease MIN5260. Details of the locations and geographical 

constraints of the various ore body components as of December 2011 are given in Section 9. 

The Stawell gold deposit was discovered in the mid 1850's during the Victorian gold rush which saw 

the discovery and exploitation of significant deposits at Bendigo and Ballarat. Mining activity 

eventually ceased in the 1920's and after a prolonged period of sporadic exploration mining 

operation recommenced in 1981. Mining operations and various levels of exploration and resource 

development activities have been continuous since 1981 and as such the project has significant past 

production and development history which is discussed in this report and also utilised during the 

compilation of the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates. 

This report has been prepared by a number of the site personnel with the assistance of an 

independent geological consultant. The report utilises information available within company technical 

reports, published geological papers and internal Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve documents 

completed by members of the SGM mine geological and mine engineering teams. 

Messrs Neil Schunke and James Llorca of Mining plus Pty Ltd are qualified persons as defined by NI

4 PROPERTY, DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The SGM is located in the State of Victoria, Australia and is 250 kilometres northwest of Melbourne 

and two kilometres from the township of Stawell. Stawell is a rural township of approximately 6500 

people and is within the Northern Grampians Shire.  

The mine's principal approval is its Mining Lease (MIN5260) issued by the Victorian State 

Government under the Mineral Resources Sustainable Development Act 1990. This approval was 

first issued on the 31st May 1985 as MIN1219 and has been amended on at least six occasions since 

as a result of approved Work Plan variations. The current mining licence approval is active until 

2020. 

The MIN5260 lease (centroid coordinates of 142.80° E and 37.06° S, GDA94) encompasses both the 

Magdala and Wonga mines and is located both under and around the township of Stawell with an 

area of 1000.58 Ha. The mining lease is comprised of private and crown land including designated 

crown land reserves. Designated crown land reserves require particular consideration in accordance 

with the Mineral Resources Development Act 1990 and National Parks (Box Ironbark and Other 

Parks) Act 2002. 

Within MIN5260 there is an A$2.00 per ounce gold royalty payable to Mineral Ventures of Australia 

(MVA). This royalty agreement came into place in February of 2004 and is in place until the earlier of 

15 year of production or 2.5 million ounces of gold produced. Furthermore this royalty agreement 

extends to Victorian tenements held by Leviathan Resources Ltd (now a wholly-owned subsidiary of 

Crocodile), which included MIN5260.  

Rehabilitation for the project is ongoing and the Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiary, SGM has 

entered into a cooperative research project with the University of Melbourne to conduct 

rehabilitation trials to prepare the rehabilitation program for eventual closure of the operations. 

Other than the rehabilitation bond the project is not subject to any other environmental liabilities. 

Stawell Gold Mines principal approval, MIN5260, is the applicable "right to mine" title over this land 

and is current to 2020. Attached to this title are a series of licence conditions that must be met and 

are the controlling conditions upon which an annual Work Plan and Work Plan variations are filed 

with the regulatory authority.  

Stawell Gold Mines is operating under a Work Plan submitted as required under section 3 of the 

General Licence Conditions of MIN5260. A key component of this Work Plan is an Environmental 

Management Plan (EMP) the most recent of which was submitted to the Department of Primary 

Industries Victoria for approval in April 2007. A requirement of the General Licence Conditions of 

Mining Licence is to maintain the EMP. Stawell Gold Mines is in the process of preparing a variation 

to the current Work Plan to undertake a planned extension to the current tailings facilities in 2009.  

Stawell Gold Mines management reviews applicable regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis. 

Stawell Gold Mines currently holds and maintains all statutory approvals required to conduct its 

mining operations.

approval was first issued on the 31st May 1985 as ML1219 and has been amended on at least six 

occasions as a result of approved Work Plan variations. The current Mining Licence approval is 

active until 2020.  Additionally Stawell Gold Mines applied for MIN5520 late 2009 with the licence 

being granted in March 2010. No mining activity is currently underway on this licence. MIN5520 was 

applied to cover the northern extension of the Magdala lodes at depth with further exploration 

required to scope the potential of this area. As such a work plan to explore only has been applied 

for and granted. The MIN5520 mining Licence is active until 2030.

Stawell Gold Mines is operating under a Work Plan submitted as required under Section 3 of the 

General Licence Conditions of Mining Licence (MIN5260). A key component of the Work Plan is an 

Environmental Management Plan (EMP), the most recent of which was submitted to the Department 

of Primary Industries Victoria for approval in April 2007. A requirement of the General Licence 

Conditions of Mining Licence is to maintain the EMP.  

Regular reviews of legislation and regulation requirements have been completed and SGM maintains 

all required statutory approvals to continue with mining operations. 

An environmental bond for the project of AUD$4,803,000 is lodged with the Department of 

Primary Industries Victoria. Rehabilitation for the project is ongoing and SGM has entered into a 

cooperative research project with the University of Melbourne to conduct rehabilitation trials to 

prepare the rehabilitation program for eventual closure of the operations. Other than the 

rehabilitation bond the project is not subject to any other environmental liabilities. 

4.4 SGM Local Survey Grid Reference 

All survey data on MIN5260 is collected and stored using modified AMG co-ordinates, based on 

Australian Map Grid AGD 66 (Zone 54). The convention is to drop the first digit of the northing, so 

5896000N becomes 896000N. The Easting values are unchanged.  



 

23 

 

The mine RL is calculated as -300m RL AHD (Australian Height Datum) and displayed as a negative 

number below surface. The RL origin is at 303.60 AHD, measured at a trigonometric station located 

adjacent to the mine on Big Hill, Stawell. 

The principal local grid in use within the Mine Lease is the SGM Grid (also referred to as the "45 

degree grid") as shown in Figure 4-3. This grid is orientated 45 degrees west of AMG north and has 

its origin at 5890137.479N and 659498.820E. It is convention to divide the northing by 20 and refer 

to this as the section northing line, i.e. northing 6200 becomes the 310 section line. Additional local 

grids are used as required for presentation of geological information as required.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 

INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

Stawell Gold Mines is easily accessible from Melbourne via the Western Highway. Access closer to 

the mine site is provided through a network of sealed bitumen government roads. Roads within the 

mine site are unsealed and regularly maintained. The main Melbourne to Adelaide rail line passes 

through the town of Stawell, which is also serviced by a local sealed airfield. 

The town of Stawell is located within the southern part of the Wimmera where the climate is 

described as semi-arid, allowing for exploration and mining activities all year round. Since 1996, 

Stawell has recorded an annual daily average temperature of 20.5°C. An extreme maximum of 

43.6°C was recorded on the 25th of January, 2003, and an extreme minimum of 3.7°C on the 4th of 

August 1997. Mean annual rainfall is 480.2 millimetres with 70 days per year on average recorded as 

having rain. 

Stawell Gold Mines has been in operation for over 25 years, developing a highly experienced 

workforce. Many contractors, also having a long association with the mine, are available in the 

township of Stawell and surrounding regions. Due to the mines close location to the town of Stawell 

many facilities are available. Within the township is a police station, hospital, schools and shops. 

Mains Electricity and water is also accessible.  

Stawell Gold Mines facilities are extensive and representative of a modern gold mining operation. On 

the surface facilities include the gold processing plant, offices, core shed, laboratory and workshops. 

Larger infrastructure onsite includes a tailings dam, covering 96 Ha and receiving 100% of gold 

tailings from the processing plant. Three freshwater dams occur throughout the mine lease. The 

mine purchases electric power under a two year contract from Origin Energy Australia that expires 

in Dec 2012.  

Water supply is from harvested rainfall runoff, mine dewatering, recycling of process water from the 

tailings facility, and by way of a 1ML/day raw water right entitlement and urban customer access to 

potable supply from Lake Bellfield located in the Grampians Mountains. The capacity of the site 

water storages is approximately 690ML. The Lake Bellfield water is potable and is preferentially used 

in the processing operations as it improves gold recovery. 

The area surrounding Stawell is composed of flat to gently undulating farmland with the Grampians 

Mountain range and National Park 20 kilometres to the southwest. Close to the centre of Stawell is 

Big Hill, the town's highest point at a height of 303.6 metres above mean sea level. Stawell Gold 

mine is situated on the southern slope of Big Hill. Parts of the area adjacent to the mine are covered 

by Iron bark forest.

6 HISTORY 

Stawell is a historic goldfield that produced 2.7 million ounces of gold between 1853 and 1926 from 

both alluvial and hard rock sources. There was little mining activity in the Stawell area from 1926 to 

11th March 1976 when Western Mining Company (WMC) Resources Ltd was granted an 

exploration licence over the Stawell Goldfield.  

In 1981 SGM was reopened by the WMC/Central Norseman Gold joint venture with 

commencement of the Magdala decline. By 1984 the operation had expanded with the construction 

of a processing facility and subsequent commencement of an open cut operation at the Wonga mine 

(2 kilometres south of Magdala). A number of historical tailing dumps were retreated during this 

period. Towards the end of mining of the Wonga open cut (1987) the Davis open cut operation was 

commenced. The Davis open cut exploited the oxide material on up dip projection of the Magdala 

deposit. The Wonga Open Cut operated from 1984 to 1987 and produced 778,847 tonnes 

recovering 69,159 ounces of gold. The Davis Open Cut operated from 1987 to 1989 and produced 

154,525 tonnes for 8,992 recovered ounces of gold. 

In December 1992 the operation was acquired in a 50/50 joint venture by Mining Project Investors 

(MPI) Pty Ltd and Pittston Mineral Ventures (Pittston). At this stage the Magdala decline was 

approximately at 410m RL, while the Wonga decline was at 180-200m RL. With the acquisition 

there was a clear direction to increase expenditure on resource definition drilling and near mine 

exploration. The joint venture continued until 2004 during which time there was a record of 

continued exploration success with discovery of additional mineralized deposits that were 

subsequently mined. 

In February 2004 MPI acquired the Pittston 50% share of the project. Exploration continued in the 

Golden Gift area during 2004 with the commencement of the Golden Gift South surface exploration 

program. In November 2004 a de-merger of the MPI gold business came into effect, and Leviathan 

Resources Ltd was floated in December 2004. The resource drilling into the Golden Gift initially 

identified seven areas of mineralisation offset from each other due to late faulting. Conversion of 

these areas of mineralisation into ore blocks wasn't universal but was successful in a majority of 

cases. The further drilling of the fault blocks also identified other mineralised surfaces previously 

unknown due to the faulted nature of the Golden Gift. From the increased geological understanding 

of the Golden Gift deposit, it was clear in the mine planning process that two declines were 

required, the GG5 and GG3 declines, to access the ore zones for continuity of supply. 

In January 2007 Perseverance acquired Leviathan Resources Ltd. Perseverance was acquired by 

Northgate on the 18th of February, 2008. Northgate was acquired by AuRico in October, 2011.  

Crocodile Gold completed their acquisition of Stawell Gold Mines from AuRico on May 4th, 2012. 

6.1 Historical and Modern Production 

Stawell is a historic goldfield having produced approximately 2.7Moz of gold between 1853 and 1926 

from both alluvial and hard rock sources. Since the commencement of mining in the modern period, 

1984, until December 2011, over 2.2 million ounces have been produced from the Stawell ore body. 

A Summary of annual gold production is shown in Figure 6-2 Annual Gold Production since 1984..

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING & MINERALISATION 

For details on the geological setting of the Stawell Project the reader is referred to the previous 

technical report entitled "Technical Report on Stawell Gold Mine, Victoria Australia (28 March 

2008)". 

7.1 Regional Geology 

The Stawell Goldfield is located in the western Stawell Zone of the Lachlan Fold Belt Figure 7-1. The 

Stawell Zone is a belt of predominantly deformed meta-sedimentary rocks representing the lower 

parts of the Cambro-Ordovician Lachlan Fold Belt stratigraphy bound to the west by the Moyston 

Fault and to the east by the Coongee Break (Vandenberg et al. 2000).

Interpretations from the Victorian Geological Survey present a thin skinned tectonics model where 

the Moyston Fault is an east dipping basal detachment which has juxtaposed higher metamorphic 

grade rocks of the Stawell Zone against lower grade Cambrian rocks of the Delamarian Glenelg 

Zone. The west dipping Stawell Fault, Coongee Break and other parallel west dipping faults 

represent back thrusts from the Moyston Fault. These back thrusts have progressively emplaced 

deeper stratigraphy against shallower stratigraphy with a generally west over east sense. An apparent 

anomaly in this sequence is the presence of deeper magnetic stratigraphy in the Stawell-Wildwood 

corridor. Vandenberg et al. 2002 interprets that the Pleasant Creek Fault, to the west of the Stawell 

Fault, actually dips east and has an east over west sense - similar to the Moyston Fault. The Stawell-

Wildwood corridor therefore represents a significant structural high in an up-thrown block of 

deeper stratigraphy between the Coongee Break and Pleasant Creek Fault. 

7.2 Local Geology 

There are three separate ore bodies defined at Stawell; the Magdala, Golden Gift and Wonga. All 

have differing characteristics but the same local geology is relevant to the genesis of them all. 

7.2.1 Stratigraphy at Stawell  

The stratigraphy at Stawell is divided into three principal units: Magdala Basalt; Albion Formation; 

Leviathan Formation, see Figure 7-4 (Squire and Wilson, 2005). Intruded into this sequence are the 

Stawell Granite and a number of felsic and mafic intrusions. Squire and Wilson (2005) interpret that 

the rock unit previously termed the Magdala Volcanogenics (Watchorn and Wilson, 1989) is an 

alteration facies that locally occurs adjacent to the basalt.  

Magdala Basalt 

The Cambrian Magdala Basalt is composed of subaqueous low-K tholeiitic lavas that exhibit an 

aphyric to sparsely plagioclase-phyric texture (Watchorn and Wilson, 1989; Squire and Wilson, in 

review). The Basalt body comprises flows ranging from 0.5m to 50m thick, pillows basalts with 

pillows ranging in size from 0.1 to 2 metres in size (Watchorn and Wilson, 1989) and monomictic 

basalt breccias varying proportions (Pritchard, 2001; Squire and Wilson, 2005).  

The basalts are interpreted to form part of the Victorian Cambrian greenstone sequences, which are 

the oldest known rocks in the Palaeozoic Lachlan Orogen, and have inferred ages of 516-514Ma 

(Squire and Wilson, 2005). The basalts near Stawell occur as dome-like units in the footwall and 

hangingwall of major faults (Miller and Wilson, 2002). The Magdala Basalt which closely resemble 

typical back-arc basin basalts (Kaufman, 2003; Crawford, 1988) has been interpreted to represent 

the medial to distal facies on the flank of a large basalt edifice upward of 500m thick (Squire and 

Wilson, 2005) and has similar magmatic affinities to the known basalt bodies north of Stawell, 

Wildwood and Kewell Basalts (Kaufman, 2003; Jupp, 2003).  

Leviathan and Albion Formations 

Overlying the Magdala Basalt is a 200-300m thick sequence of non-fossiliferous turbidites (Squire and 

Wilson, 2005). The turbidite sequence has been subdivided into two different lithologies: the Albion 

Formation; and the Leviathan Formation. The differences between the two lithologies was first 

recognised but not explored by Gane (1998). He recognised the sediments on the western side of 

the Magdala Basalt graded from predominantly mud-rich to more sand-rich away from the basalt.  



 

30 

 

The Albion Formation is the lowest clastic sequence to the west of the Magdala Basalt. The unit 

varies in thickness with the top of the unit defined by a 20-100m sequence of black mudstone. 

Within the Albion Formation there are a number of facies which along with black mudstone include 

calcareous sandstone, siliceous siltstone and sulphidic black mudstone. Squire and Wilson (2005) 

suggested that the sediments were deposited predominantly due to suspension settling in an oxygen-

starved sedimentary basin. There were short-lived periods of oxygen-rich conditions shortly after 

volcanism recognised by the presence of siliceous siltstone but the dominance of black mudstone 

within the Albion formation indicates the basin of deposition was predominantly anoxic (Squire and 

Wilson, 2005). The provenance for the Albion Formation sediments has been identified from detrital 

compositions to be a low-grade metamorphic terrane (Cas, 1983). 

The Leviathan Formation overlies the Albion Formation and is dominated by fine-to medium-grained 

quartz-rich sandstones (Squire and Wilson, 2005). The contact between the two formations is 

gradational and conformable. Although the Leviathan Formation was deposited in a higher-energy 

environment than the underlying Albion Formation, the detrital compositions indicate little change in 

the provenance between the two formations (Squire and Wilson, 2005). 

The Leviathan and Albion Formations are not segregated by the mine or exploration geologists at 

SGM and are referred to by the local name of 'mineschist'. 

Magdala Facies 

The Magdala Facies, termed Magdala Volcanogenics at SGM, distinguished by its dark green colour, is 

a result of intense chloritic alteration of mudstone and or shales located at the base of the Albion 

formation and immediately above the Magdala Basalt. The Magdala Facies are the primary and most 

important host rock for the sulphide replacement style of gold mineralisation at Stawell. Major 

mineralisation sulphides include arsenopyrite, pyrite and pyrrhotite, the latter two commonly 

occurring along cleavage planes and concentrated within shear zones (Robinson, 2005).  

Felsic Intrusions 

Quartz±feldspar-phyric felsic intrusions crosscut the turbidite sequence. The quartz±feldspar-phyric 

felsic intrusions vary in thickness from 50cm to 12m wide and showed chilled margins. They are 

predominantly composed of quartz and plagioclase with phenocrysts up to 3mm in size. The feldspar 

phenocrysts have euhedral shapes and display multiple twinning while the quartz phenocrysts had a 

cloud-like appearance and were rimmed with fibrous quartz (Gedge, 1997). The groundmass is 

composed of ~80% quartz in anhedral grains and display undulose extinction (Gedge, 1997).  

The felsic intrusions tend to follow northwest-trending shear zones (Wilson et al., 1992) and the 

emplacement of the quartz±feldspar-phyric felsic intrusions post-dates the main Magdala 

mineralisation event. The intrusions have been dated at 413±3Ma (Arne et al., 1998). 

Stawell Granite 

The Stawell Granite was emplaced during the early Devonian, 401±4Ma (Arne et al., 1998), and is 

located about 2km south of the Magdala deposit (Xu et al., 1994) and adjacent to the Wonga 

deposit. The pluton is approximately 20km wide and 13km long and intrudes the sandstone and 

shale units of the turbidite sequence. The pluton is an asymmetrically zoned, medium grained 

intrusion with contains diorites, granodiorites and magnetite-rich felsic granites (Wilson et al., 1992). 

There is a 0.5km to 1.0km contact aureole surrounding the Stawell Granite (Xu et al., 1994).  



 

31 

 

Lamprophyric Intrusions 

Lamprophyres intrude all the above lithologies and are hosted in D4 shears (Gedge, 1997). The 

lamprophyre intrusions can range in thickness from 1.0cm to 3m (Wilson et al., 1992). The dykes 

vary in colour from dark grey to chocolate brown and display conchoidal fracture patterns (Gedge, 

1997). The compositions of the intrusions vary from monchiquite (olivine bearing) to fourchite 

(augite and no olivine) (Wilson et al., 1992). The lamprophyre dykes typical mineralogy is composed 

of Na-rich plagioclase (albite), clynopyroxenes, biotite, sulphides, ilmenite and Ti-rich magnetite 

(Gedge, 1997) 

7.2.2 Structural History at Stawell  

At least seven deformation events have been recognised at Stawell (Wilson et al., 1992). These 

deformation events can be broadly split into two categories; early, ductile deformation (D1 to D4), 

and late brittle deformation (D4 and later). A description of both categories of deformation and 

related structures are given below.  

Early, Ductile Deformation 

The ductile deformation events all occurred under a northeast-southwest shortening direction (see 

Figure 7-2) (Miller and Wilson, 2002). The earliest ductile event recognised, D1, is thought to be 

thrust-related with early shearing along detachment surfaces that produced a fabric, S1, parallel to 

bedding (Wilson et al., 1992). This event has been suggested to occur at about 510-504Ma (Squire 

and Wilson, 2005). The second ductile deformation event, D2, produced the most dominant ductile 

fabrics at Stawell and occurred at about 496-494Ma (Squire, 2004). D2 refolded F1 closures and 

fabric into tight F2 folds causing S1 to appear predominantly parallel to S2 (Miller and Wilson, 2002). 

The mesoscopic F2 folds trend to the northwest and are generally asymmetric with hinges varying in 

size from centimetres to tens of metres (Wilson et al., 1992). Peak metamorphism at Stawell is 

considered pre- to syn- D2 and reached mid-greenschist grades (Miller and Wilson, 2002, Wilson et 

al., 1992).  

Overprinting both of the earlier fabrics at Stawell is an asymmetric differentiated crenulation 

cleavage, S3. D3 is a result of developing west-over east-shearing and folding (Watchorn and Wilson, 

1989). This event is date at approximately 494-492Ma (Squire and Wilson, 2005). The crenulation 

foliation is generally sub-horizontal and is associated with cleavage-parallel veins. There is evidence 

of a fourth ductile fabric at Stawell which is associated with D4 and is interpreted as a ductile-brittle 

event (Miller and Wilson, 2002). 

Late, Brittle Deformation 

Superimposed on the ductile fabrics (D1-D4) are a number of brittle structures (refer Figure 7-2 and 

Figure 7-3). The geometry and style of the brittle deformation is strongly dependent on the pre-

existing geometry of the basalt (Miller and Wilson, 2002). The initiation of the brittle deformation 

occurred during late D4 when the shortening direction changed from a northeast-southwest to an 

east-west orientation (Watchorn and Wilson, 1989; Miller and Wilson, 2002). The early D4 shear 

zones have a northwest trend and dip to the southwest between 20˚ to 60˚ with a reverse sense of 

movement (Watchorn and Wilson, 1989).  

There was a change in the regional stress field within the Lachlan Orogen during the Late Silurian 

which is expressed at Stawell as a change from east-west shortening to sinistral wrenching along pre-

existing faults (Miller and Wilson, 2004a). Reactivation of the D4 shears by sinistral wrenching is 



 

32 

 

termed D5 (Mapani and Wilson, 1994). The sinistral wrenching was followed by another change in 

the regional stress field with the shortening direction changing to northwest-southeast. A set of 

major faults oblique to the earlier structural trends associated with this change in shortening 

direction are termed 'early South Fault' structures (Miller and Wilson, 2004a). The last major 

deformation event was associated with a final change to a northeast-southwest shortening. Faults 

associated with this event dip northwest and have a dip-slip sense of movement (Miller and Wilson, 

2004a).

7.2.3 Stawell Mine Geological Architecture 

The dominant feature at Stawell is the 1.2km wide, doubly plunging, northwest striking Magdala 

Basalt dome. The Magdala Basalt is made up of a series of basalt noses, interrupted to be flow sheets 

(Squire and Wilson, 2005), which dip to the southwest and plunge to the northwest. Areas of 

sedimentation are present between the basalt noses (interpreted flow sheets) and are locally termed 

'waterloos'. The Magdala Basalt has been drilled and identified to a depth of 1.7km and interpreted 

from existing drill information and from geophysical modelling to extend along strike at least 5km. 

Surrounding the basalt dome is the turbidite sequences of the Albion and Leviathan Formations 

(mineschist) which young to the west. The contact between the mineschist and Magdala Basalt on 

the western side is marked by the alteration package of the Magdala Volcanogenics. The Magdala 

Volcanogenics is weakly developed on the eastern surface of the Magdala Basalt.  

This Magdala geology has been faulted and offset by later brittle deformation, the most notable of 

these offsets is the South Fault which has a northeast over southwest sense of transport (refer 

Figure 7-4 and Figure 7-5).  

Above the South Fault is the Magdala ore body which contains limited offsets due to late faulting. 

The Basalt surface in the Magdala ore body dips to the west and strikes towards 340˚. Beneath the 

South Fault is the Golden Gift ore body which is heavily offset by late faulting creating isolated ore 

blocks. Unlike the Magdala ore body the basalt in the Golden Gift dips to the east and strikes 

towards 315˚. The late faulting as well as creating isolated ore blocks also complicates the ore 

geometry within the each block.

ore bodies. 

 



 

36 

 

To the south of the Magdala Basalt is the Stawell Granite, which structurally is situated below the 

South Fault (Figure 7-6).  

Located close to an embayment in the Stawell Granite are a series of brittle structures. One of the 

structures termed the Hangingwall structure strikes towards 350˚ and dips between 25˚ and 50˚ 

towards the east, and the other structural set, termed Link structures, generally trend toward 240˚ 

and dip between 40˚ and 70˚ to the southeast (Xu et al., 1994). Cross cutting these late brittle 

structures are a series of late felsic intrusives. This fault system hosts the Wonga ore body.

7.3 Mineralisation  

There are three different ore bodies at Stawell, being Magdala, Golden Gift and Wonga. Each of the 

differing ore and mineralisation types are summarised below. Both the Magdala and Golden Gift ore 

types are hosted within the Magdala volcanogenic. Within the Magdala deposit there are three main 

ore types; Central Lode, Basalt Contact Lodes, and Magdala Stockwork Lodes. Central lode 

mineralisation was a significant production source from Magdala early in the mine history. It is a 

quartz-rich shear lode ranging from 0.5m to 10m in width and generally dips 55 - 65° to the west 

with a total strike length of 4km and a down dip extend of one kilometre. The overall structure is 

mineralised economic shoots vary from 20m to 30m to 200 – 350 metres in strike. Free gold in the 

quartz is associated with pyrite, arsenopyrite and recrystallised pyrrhotite. Average mined grade for 

Central Lode is 4-7 g/t Au. 

Basalt Contact Lodes are located parallel to the Magdala Basalt and in 'waterloo' or re-entrant 

positions. They are typically 2m wide and are represented by arrays of quartz sulphide tension veins 

immediately adjacent to the volcanogenic Basalt contacts. Sulphides include pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite 

and pyrite and occur as alteration selvages on tension vein margins. The main alteration mineral is 

stilpnomelane, resulting in its dark colour. The mineralisation is isolated to the Magdala Volcanogenic 

package with none present in the adjacent Magdala Basalt. Ore shoot lengths range between 50m 

and 450m. The average mined grade for Basalt Contact Lodes is 4 – 9 g/t Au. 

The Magdala Stockwork Lodes are situated above major basalt noses and can be described as a 

hybrid between Central and Basalt Contact Lodes. They consist of large quartz tension vein arrays 

with arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite dominant sulphide mineralisation. The strike extent is limited to 

40m to 50m and limited vertically to between 30m and 50m. Average mined grade for Magdala 

Stockwork Lodes is 4–7 g/t Au. 

Unlike the Magdala deposit there is only one identifiable ore type in the Golden Gift and this is 

termed the Golden Gift Stockworks. Though there is only one discernible ore type in the Golden 

Gift, the Golden Gift Stockworks contain a spectrum of all Magdala styles. Typical widths range from 

8-12m up to 30m and the strike extents of shoots range between 150m and 400m. Areas of highest 

grades and largest widths are situated above major basalt noses which are present in most ore 

bodies. Quartz content is generally below 25%. Mineralisation includes abundant recrystallised 

pyrrhotite and coarse grained arsenopyrite, pyrite and visible gold. Average mined grade is 4–10 g/t 

Au. 

The Wonga deposit is hosted within the locally termed Wonga Schist that is part of the Leviathan 

Formation along two main fault systems. The Wonga Schist has undergone contact metamorphism 

during the emplacement of the Stawell Granite and undergone three ductile deformation events 

similar to other areas of the Stawell region. The two fault systems controlling the mineralisation are 

the hangingwall structure which, strikes towards 350° and dips between 25° and 50° towards the 

east, and the Link structures which generally trend toward 240° and dip between 40° and 70° to the 

southeast. The mineralisation is represented by arsenopyrite disseminations to quartz veins within 

these structures. The main ore minerals present are anhedral fine-grained pyrrhotite and 

arsenopyrite. The higher grade ore zones often show andalusite-sericite alteration with rutile and 

ilmenite associations. Production grades from 4 – 6 g/t Au were common for the Wonga ore.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

For details on the deposit types and mineralisation of the Stawell deposits the reader is referred to 

the previous technical report entitled "Technical Report for Stawell Gold Mine, Victoria Australia 

(28 March 2008)" written for Northgate. 

8.1 Deposit Types and Mineralisation 

Victorian mineralisation episodes have been dated to occur during the Devonian and Silurian periods 

with no gold mineralisation occurring prior to 440Ma (Miller and Wilson, 2002). A description of the 

mineralisation episodes in Western Victoria is described below. 

The largest and most significant mineralisation event in the western Lachlan Orogen occurred at ca. 

440Ma (Foster et al., 1998). It occurred contemporaneous in the Stawell and in the Bendigo-Ballarat 

zones with the mineralisation occurring during late D4 deformation in the Stawell zone and occurring 

during late D1 deformation in the Bendigo-Ballarat zone. The mineralisation is hosted in D4 brittle 

structures associated with east-over-west movement at Stawell while in the Bendigo-Ballarat zone 

the mineralisation occurs in saddle reefs in the hinges of D1 folds and in reverse faults created via D1 

fold lock-up (Miller and Wilson, 2002; Schaubs and Wilson, 2002). This mineralisation event 

produced the largest endowments of gold within the western Lachlan Orogen (Miller and Wilson, 

2002). 

The next episode of gold mineralisation occurred at about 426-420Ma (Foster et al., 1998) and is 

associated with fault reactivation throughout western Victoria (Miller and Wilson, 2002). This 

episode of gold mineralisation produced significantly smaller endowments than the 440 Ma event 

(Miller and Wilson, 2002). The late Silurian mineralisation is associated with the D5 sinistral 

wrenching at Stawell and has been recognised at the Percydale fields in the Stawell zone and at 

Tarnagulla in the Bendigo-Ballarat zone (Miller and Wilson, 2002).  

The final episode of mineralisation recognised in western Victoria is the Wonga mineralisation at 

Stawell (Miller and Wilson, 2004a). The mineralisation at Wonga over prints the quartz- and felsic-

rich intrusions and is overprinted by the Stawell Granite contact areole. Watchorn and Wilson 

(1989) suggested that this mineralisation is temporally and spatially related to the granites 

emplacement. Miller and Wilson (2004b) advocate the mineralisation event at Wonga formed at ca. 

400Ma (Foster et al., 1998). The Wonga mineralisation occurred during a late-stage magmatic event 

within a long-lived orogenic system at shallow crustal levels (Miller and Wilson, 2004b). This 

mineralisation occurred in a series of brittle structures dependent on pre-existing weakness which 

are related to a fluid over-pressure event after the lockup of major structures (Miller et al., 2004).  

8.2 Ore Types 

There are three different ore bodies at Stawell; the Magdala, Golden Gift and Wonga. Each of the 

differing ore and mineralisation types are summarised below. Both the Magdala and Golden Gift ore 

types are hosted within the Magdala Volcanogenics. 

 



 

41 

 

8.2.1 Magdala Deposit Ore Types 

Within the Magdala deposit there are three main ore types; Central Lode, Basalt Contact Lodes, and 

Madgala Stockwork Lodes. These are summarised below. 

Central Lode 

Central lode mineralisation was a significant production source from Magdala (Figure 8-1). It is a 

quartz rich shear lode ranging from 0.5m to 10m in width and generally dips 55 - 65˚ to the west 

with a total strike length of 4km and a down dip extend of 1.0km. Whilst the overall structure is 

mineralised economic shoots are vary from 20 – 30m in strike up to 200m to 350m in strike. Free 

gold in the quartz is associated with pyrite, arsenopyrite and recrystallised pyrrhotite. Average 

mined grade for Central Lode is 4 – 7 g/t Au. 

 

 

Figure 8-1 Example of Central Lode mineralisation. 

 

Basalt Contact Lodes 

Basalt Contact Lodes are located parallel to the Magdala Basalt and in 'waterloo' positions (Figure 

8-2). They are typically 2m wide and are represented by arrays of quartz sulphide tension veins 

immediately adjacent to the volcanogenic basalt contacts. Sulphides include pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite 

and pyrite and occur as alteration selvages on tension vein margins. The main alteration mineral is 

Stilpnomalane, resulting in its dark colour. The mineralisation is isolated to the Magdala Volcanogenic 

package with none present in the adjacent Magdala Basalt. Ore shoot lengths range between 50m 

and 450m. The average mined grade for Basalt Contact Lodes is 4 – 9 g/t Au. 

 



 

42 

 

 

Figure 8-2 Example of Basalt Contact mineralisation. 

 

Magdala Stockwork Lodes 

The Magdala Stockwork Lodes are situated above major basalt noses and can be described as a 

hybrid between central and basalt contact lodes. They consist of large quartz tension vein arrays 

with arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite dominant sulphide mineralisation. The strike extent is limited to 

40m to 50m and limited vertically 30m to 50m. Average mined grade for Magdala Stockwork Lodes 

is 4 – 7 g/t Au. 

8.2.2 Golden Gift Deposit Ore Types 

Unlike the Magdala deposit there is only one identifiable ore type in the Golden Gift mineralisation; 

termed the Golden Gift Stockworks. Although there is only one discernible ore type in the Golden 

Gift, the Golden Gift Stockworks contain a spectrum of all Magdala styles. Typical widths range from 

8m to 12m, however some areas extend up to 30m, and the strike extents of the shoots range 

between 150m and 400m. Areas of highest grades and largest widths are situated above major basalt 

noses which are present in most ore bodies. Quartz content is generally below 25%. Mineralisation 

includes abundant recrystallised pyrrhotite and coarse grained arsenopyrite, pyrite and visible gold. 

Average mined grade is 4 – 10g/t Au. 

8.2.3 Wonga Deposit Ore Types 

The Wonga Deposit is hosted within the locally termed Wonga Schist (part of the Leviathan 

Formation) along two main fault systems. The Wonga Schist has undergone contact metamorphism 

during the emplacement of the Stawell Granite (Xu et al., 1994) and undergone three ductile 



 

43 

 

deformation events similar to other areas of the Stawell region (Watchorn & Wilson, 1989). The 

two fault systems controlling the mineralisation are the Hangingwall structure which, strikes towards 

350˚ and dips between 25˚ and 50˚ towards the east, and the Link structures which generally trend 

toward 240˚ and dip between 40˚ and 70˚ to the southeast. The mineralisation is represented by 

aresenopyrite disseminations to quartz veins within these structures. The main ore minerals present 

are anhedral fine grained pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite. The higher grade ore zones often show 

andalusite-sericite alteration with rutile and ilmenite associations (Xu et al., 1994). Production grades 

from 4 – 6 g/t Au were common for Wonga ore. 

8.3 Ore Types by Area 

8.3.1 C7/D1 

Comprising the northernmost extension of Central Lode, C7/D1 shares the same geological 

characteristics as the other Magdala ore bodies above the South Fault: a west-dipping to sub-vertical 

ore lode adjacent to a basalt footwall contact; a mineschist hangingwall; the westerly dipping, quartz-

rich Central Lode shear structure; and a weakly mineralised volcanogenic package between Central 

Lode and the footwall ore zone. A cross section showing the relationship between the various 

geological components is shown in Figure 8-3. 

 

Figure 8-3 Typical cross section through D1 showing the interpreted geological setting. 

 



 

44 

 

Economic gold mineralisation in D1 is contained within Central lode, a pervasive westerly dipping 

shear structure sitting at an offset of 5m to 20m west of the Dukes Basalt contact. A second zone of 

mineralisation (Dukes Lode) occurs adjacent to the footwall Dukes Basalt. This mineralised zone is 

typically 1.0m to 3m wide and separated from the weak volcanogenic package on its western flank by 

a boundary that is considered to be of lithological origin with late shearing along it. The weak 

volcanogenic package that separates the two lodes is termed the Dukes Internal Volcanogenics, and 

is generally characterised by low gold grade and weaker strength than the other lodes. Added to the 

August 2011 Geology and Resource model was a new lode called Stockworks. This mineralisation 

used to be included in the Internal Volcanogenics. It is still characterised by lower grades and can be 

patchy in nature, however it is geologically different to the internal volcanogentic low grade 

mineralisation. It is located between the Dukes and Central lodes. 

8.3.2 G6 

To date, GG6 drilling indicates similar geology and geometry to the rest of the Golden Gift ore 

bodies at the Stawell mine. The GG6 is situated beneath, and is interpreted to be the fault offset of, 

the GG5L area, which is currently in production. Three zones of mineralisation have been modelled 

and classified, termed the "Basalt Contact", the "Stockworks" and the "Waterloo" zones. Several 

drillholes provide an indication of a quartz style lode in the mineschist footwall. Further drilling is 

required to confirm continuity of this observation. 

The Stockworks zone mineralisation consists of pyrrhotite associated with weak to moderate 

chlorite altered host rock. Stockworks zones occur interspersed between sub ore-grade zones of 

weakly altered chlorite volcanogenic or iron-rich sediment. Quartz shear zones containing graphite 

and chlorite alteration are also present. 

The Basalt Contact zone mineralisation is higher grade than the Stockworks zone and is hosted 

within strongly chlorite altered volcanogenic or iron-rich sediments. Sulphide mineralisation consists 

of coarse arsenopyrite up to 20mm with recrystallised pyrrhotite and minor pyrite. Quartz tension 

veins up to 0.75m wide are a common feature in the basalt contact zone. Another feature common 

in the immediate contact zone with the basalt is abundant silicification of the host rock in bands up 

to 1.0m wide. A narrow package of weakly iron and sulphide altered sediment separates the basalt 

and Stockworks zones. 

In addition to the basalt contact and stockworks zones of mineralisation, a third mineralised horizon, 

a Waterloo zone is present and is typically similar to the high grade Basalt Contact mineralisation 

(Figure 8-4).

Figure 8-4 Typical cross-section through GG6 showing current interpreted geological setting. 

 

Structurally, GG6 is bounded by the Low Fault above and the Gamay Fault below. The ore lodes are 

dislocated by the Bastardo, Rondinella and Concord Faults (all dipping approximately 35°). The 

offsets observed across these faults from drilling to date are relatively minor. Interaction with 

Wildcat Porphyry limits the ore body to the north and the mineralised "volcanogenic" altered 

sediments thin out towards the south limiting the ore body in this direction. 

8.3.3 GG6L 

The GG6L is situated immediately beneath GG6 and is interpreted to be the fault offset of the GG6 

area, which is currently in production. To date, GG6L drilling indicates similar geology to the rest of 

the Golden Gift ore bodies at the SGM, with the ore body hosted within intensely altered 

sedimentary rocks "volcanogenics" immediately at the contact with the Magdala Basalt Dome. In 

contrast to the NW-strike of the GG6 ore body, the GG6L resource strikes between N275 and 

N295 and its along-strike extent is also limited by the northwest dipping Wildcat Porphyry at its 

northern margin and by a sub vertical porphyry dyke at its southern margin.  

Major rock types identified through drill core logging are mineschist (psammo-pelites and pelites), 

siliceous sedimentary rocks, contact volcanogenics (chlorite-, silica- and sulphide-bearing 

carbonaceous sedimentary rocks), felsic porphyry dykes, and basalt. Two zones of mineralisation 



 

46 

 

have been modelled and classified, termed the "Basalt Contact", and the "low grade volcanogenic" 

zones. Refer to Figure 8-5 for the long section of the classified shapes.  

 

 

Figure 8-5 GG6L Longitudinal projection 

From the exploration and in-fill drilling, the basalt contact zone mineralisation is WNW-striking, sub-

vertical, has a mean grade of 5.94 g/t, and a true thickness generally less than 5m. Discrete slivers of 

bleached basalt (highly sericitised and up to 0.5m thick) within the "volcanogenic' rocks are a 

common feature of the contact mineralisation zone, as well as irregular intervals of "siliceous 

sedimentary rocks". Sulphide mineralisation consists of coarse arsenopyrite up to 20mm in diameter 

with accompanying recrystallised pyrrhotite and lesser pyrite. Rare grains of visible gold have been 

observed within these assemblages. Deformed quartz tension veins up to 0.75m wide are a common 

feature in the Basalt Contact zone.  



 

47 

 

The low grade mineralisation is also hosted within pelitic rocks but is located between the basalt 

contact zone and the Mineschist. It is further characterised by weak chlorite and sulphide 

(pyrrhotite, pyrite +/- arsenopyrite) alteration and deformed quartz-carbonate veins. As previously 

referred to, the gold grade can sometimes increase towards the footwall of the low grade zone, 

which potentially represents intervals of "Stockwork" mineralisation as defined elsewhere in the 

mine, such as the Kensei Lode in GG6 (Figure 8-6). 

 

Figure 8-6 Typical cross-section through GG6L showing current interpreted geological setting. 

The GG6L is bounded by the Gamay Fault above and the Trollinger Fault below. In order of 

increasing depth, other faults that dislocate the gold mineralisation are the Carnelian, Fortana, 

Madrassa and Ramisco Faults (these faults dip approximately 35° to the NE). From current drilling, 

the reverse offsets along these faults are in the order of 10m except for the Fortana Block, where 

the offset has been modelled to about 20m to 30m. Within all modelled blocks, the Wildcat 

Porphyry truncates the northern end of the ore body and a yet to be named sub-vertical porphyry 

truncates the mineralisation to the south. The ore body remains open at depth, however, the 

Wildcat Porphyry is thought to completely terminate the Golden Gift ore bodies at approximately -

1940mRL.  Resource classification in the GG6L is difficult due to the discontinuous nature of the 

mineralisation and high degree of faulting. Faulting is likely increased due the proximity to the 

Wildcat Porphyry structure which has an estimated off set of 1 to 2km. Fault blocks containing ore 

zones can be from 5 to 25m in height. For these reasons GG6L is classified only as Inferred 

resource. 



 

48 

 

8.3.4 Federal Albion 

The Mid Magdala shares the same geological characteristics as the other Magdala ore bodies above 

the South Fault: a west-dipping to sub-vertical ore lode adjacent to a basalt footwall contact; a 

mineschist hangingwall; the westerly dipping, quartz-rich Central Lode shear structure; and a weakly 

mineralised volcanogenic package between Central Lode and the footwall ore zone. A cross section 

showing the relationship between the various geological components is shown in Figure 8-7. 

Central Lode is typified by wide (1-10m) laminated to buck quartz seam and associated FW stocks in 

the Magdala "Volcanogenic" and its hanging wall is commonly defined by the Magdala "Mineschist". 

 

Figure 8-7 Schematic Cross Section through Mid Magdala mine geology. 

The Extended Lode, on the western side of the Extended Basalt, is typified as a 1.0m to 2m wide, 

basalt contact mineralisation, hosted within strongly chlorite altered volcanogenic or iron-rich 

sediments. Sulphide mineralisation consists of coarse arsenopyrite up to 20mm with recrystallised 

pyrrhotite and minor pyrite. Quartz tension veins up to 0.75m wide are a common feature in the 

basalt contact zone. Another feature common in the immediate contact zone with the basalt is 

abundant silicification of the host rock in bands up to 1.0m wide. 

8.3.5 Mariners 

Geologically, the Mariners area shares some similar characteristics to the rest of the Magdala 

Deposit, although it is unique in the fact that the only lode structure present is a quartz-rich shear 

zone. The dominant lode structure, Mariners Lode, is generally considered to be an off-set of the 



 

49 

 

Central Lode structure found beneath the Scotchman's Fault. As such the Mariner Lode represents 

the upper component of the Central Lode system above the crest of the Magdala Basalt.  

A splay/flat propagating off the Mariners Lode in observed within the drilling. This splay is a low 

angled structure and is situated to the east of the main Mariner Lode. Beneath the splay structure 

are two small basalt noses. A third basalt body has been identified in the hangingwall of the Mariners 

Lode. Surrounding the two structures and basalts is a package of weak volcanogenic/sediments. This 

sequence is constrained by the Scotchman's Fault at depth and vertically by a Scotchman's Splay 

Fault. A detailed cross section showing the relationship between the various geological components 

is shown in Figure 8-8.  

 

Figure 8-8 Typical cross-sections through Mariners Area showing current interpreted geological 

setting (yellow = basalt, green = Mariner Lode). 

8.3.6 Wonga North and South 

The Wonga deposit is hosted within the locally termed Wonga Schist which forms part of the 

Leviathan Formation. The Wonga Schist is a laminated dark purple-grey quartz-biotite rich 

psammopelitic rock which has been subject to contact metamorphism during the emplacement of 

the Stawell Granite. The composition of the Wonga Schist imperceptibly becomes increasingly pelitic 

towards the northeast concomitant with an increase in the development of cordierite and andalusite 



 

50 

 

(now essentially chlorite) porphyroblasts. The overall northeast fining of the Wonga Schists indicates 

proximity to the Stawell Fault and Albion Formation sediments.  

Numerous quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes are exposed in the Wonga mine. They generally dip 

consistently towards the northeast, range in width from 10mm to 15m, are fine to coarsely 

porphyritic and tend to follow major northwest – southeast trending shear zones. These dykes are 

intimately associated with the emplacement and cooling history of the Stawell Granite, post-dating 

the early phases of ductile deformation in the Wonga schist and pre-dating the final phases of brittle 

deformation. A continuum of porphyry dyke intrusion has been recognised, from early types 

mineralised by ore bearing fluids and thermally metamorphosed by the granite through to late types 

that cut the Stawell Granite.  

In the lower levels of the decline and on the western margin of the mine undifferentiated green to 

grey mafic volcanics of basaltic to dacitic composition have been intersected. These rocks comprise 

the same quartz, muscovite and albite mineralogy of mafics seen in Magdala but differ by the 

presence of anorthite, amphibole and diopside (Quick, 1988).  

The Stawell Granite is a complex multi-phase oxidised I-type granitoid consisting of an inner 

adamellite core surrounded by an outer rim of granodiorite and quartz diorite (Bird, 1986). The 

granite is fringed by a 0.5km to 1.0km wide biotite-rich contact aureole within which porphyroblasts 

of cordierite and andalusite are developed parallel to the S1-S3 cleavage traces in the pelitic layers of 

the Wonga Schist. A K-Ar date of 396+5Ma has been assigned to the Stawell Granite by Richards 

and Singleton (1981). Xenoliths of partly assimilated Wonga schist from the outer granodiorite rim 

preserve S1 – S3 fabrics and gold mineralisation thereby constraining the timing of gold 

emplacement.

9 EXPLORATION 

9.1 Current Exploration 

Significant exploration progress and successes has been made over the life of the Stawell project 

including the discovery of the current mineral resources and mineral reserves. In the period 

September 2008 - April 2012 (Figure 9-1), of note is the conversion of the Golden Gift 6, discovered 

in 2007, into reserve and the Golden Gift 6 Lower, discovered in 2008, into inferred resource.  

Scoping the northern extension of the Magdala dome has also added to the C7 (Dukes) reserve. 

Exploration in 2011 focussed on big targets in the near mine environs scoping the recently 

discovered Northgate Gift, the continuation of the basalt contact lodes beneath the Wildcat fault 

and the Wonga Gift, the southern extension of the Golden Gift lodes. Exploration work in 2012 is 

budgeted at $3.1 million and will be primarily directed toward the North Magdala (D2) and 

Wildwood Targets.

9.1.1 Expenditure 

Total geological expenditure (both near mine and regional) for the period 1st September 2008 to 

the 31st March 2012 was $19.7M. A breakdown of expenditure by year is included in Table 9-1.

52 

 

9.2 North Magdala 

The North Magdala prospect is the northern, down plunge extension of the Magdala Lode above the 

South Fault and is bound by Scotchman's fault above and Wildcat porphyry below. These faults are 

interpreted to converge to the north, eventually terminating the mineralised area. Exploration in 

2008-2009 was conducted on two fronts; underground drilling scoping the immediate extension to 

the C7 mining area, and surface drilling scoping further north where no underground platforms were 

available. The programs were successful with the basalt contact lodes and Central Lode found to 

continue. Surface drilling returned a peak assay of 3.3m (true width) at 19.6 g/t a further 500m along 

strike from the current C7 mining area. 

Drilling resumed in late 2011 with the development of a new exploration decline to scope the 

remaining 250m strike length gap left between underground drilling and the high grade surface 

intercept. During 2011-2012 this remaining area has been scoped on minimum 40m x 40m spacing. 

Despite favourable geology confirming the continuing presence of basalt contact alteration and the 

central lode, results have mostly been poor. This area is explained as a poorly mineralised zone 

between mineralised shoots, this pattern also occurs further south on basalt contact lodes along the 

Magdala basalt and is interpreted to be a result of N-S shortening 'kinking' the basalt prior to 

mineralisation causing areas of increased dilation and gold mineralisation (of about 200m in strike 

length) adjacent to areas of poor mineralisation. The surface high grade intercept could indicate the 

southern part of a dilation zone which opens up to the north but the converging faults limit the 

vertical extent of mineralisation in this area to about 50m resulting in a smaller mineralised shoot 

than those historically mined. 

9.3  Northgate Gift 

Formerly known as the Leviathan Gift, the Northgate Gift is the continuation of the Magdala System 

below the Wildcat Fault. The Northgate Gift basalt along with basalt contact mineralisation was 

discovered in August 2010 with a 2km diamond drillhole as a result of a structural review of the area 

in late 2009. An intercept of 1.8m at 4.7 g/t Au was returned from the basalt contact and 3.6m at 3.5 

g/t Au in a 'waterloo' within the basalt. The offset of the Wildcat Fault was confirmed to be in the 

order of 1.2km placing the Northgate Gift at a depth of -2,300mRL. 

A further two intercepts indicate a potential continuous mineralised surface area of 175m x 500m; 

however, the great depth of the Northgate Gift discounts any surface drilling and further drilling 

from underground would require more holes in the order of 2km length or at least 1km of 

development for further scoping of the area. 

9.4 Golden Gift  

Mining areas within the Golden Gift are separated by flat lying faults which offset the mineralisation 

laterally. Near mine exploration testing the extension of the Golden Gift lodes has been ongoing, 

concentrating on the area below the Golden Gift 5 Lower where mining was completed in 2011. 



 

53 

 

9.4.1 Golden Gift 6 (GG6) 

Diamond drilling has been ongoing since discovery of GG6 below the Low Fault in 2007. A total of 

210 holes have now been drilled into GG6 in several drill campaigns, the area is currently being 

mined as of December 2010.  

9.4.2 Golden Gift 6 Lower (GG6L) 

The Golden Gift 6 Lower area sits immediately below the GG6 separated by a slight offset in the 

Gamay Fault. The area was discovered in mid 2008 during GG6 diamond drilling. Since discovery, a 

further 43 holes have been drilled in the area allowing for conversion of the upper blocks into 

Inferred resource. Conversion of lower blocks is ongoing. 

9.4.3 Golden Gift 6 South (GG6 South) 

The southern extension of both the GG6 and GG6L Lodes are terminated by a steeply dipping felsic 

porphyry dyke that intrudes into the Basalt Contact position, stoping out mineralisation. The strike 

of the porphyry is slightly oblique to the Basalt Contact and is interpreted to diverge further to the 

south, reopening the Basalt Contact with the Golden Gift contact lodes resuming. Drilling during the 

2009 GG6L program targeted this basalt contact but failed and scope still remains further south.  

9.5 Above Scotchman's Fault 

The Above Scotchman's fault program targeted the down plunge extension of the Mariners resource 

area, where fault slices of the Magdala Contact lode and Central Lode have been displaced by the 

Scotchman's fault. Two underground diamond drill campaigns were drilled in 2009 and 2010 with 15 

holes for a total of 2815.3m. Drilling defined a graphitic fault zone (the Scotchman's Fault Zone - 

SFZ) bound by the Scotchman's Fault and Scotchman's lower fault splay with good mineralisation. 

Quartz breccia lode also occurs on the Lower Scotchman's splay with the highest grades being 

recorded in this zone. Above the SFZ, the primary target, small slices of basalt contact mineralisation 

were intersected with a peak result of 8.3m at 1.4 g/t Au in MD5769 with little evidence of 

continuity. Despite good results within the Scotchman's fault zone, the area has been downgraded 

due to the high graphite content and its preg-robbing properties.  

9.6 Wonga Gift 

The Wonga Gift Comprises the southern extension of the Golden Gift, where the basalt dome crest 

plunges to the south in the footwall of the South Fault. The Stawell fault is also interpreted to 

continue into the footwall of the South fault, to the west of the basalt with the possibility of the 

associated Hangingwall lodes historically mined at Stawell. 

9.6.1 Wonga Gift Deeps 

Targeting the potential for Basalt Contact lodes, a Magnetotelluric (MT) survey was conducted by 

Zonge Engineering and Research Organisation (Zonge) in late 2009 over the area to try to define a 

resistive basalt, results were mixed due to influences from surface infrastructure but a weak resistive 

anomaly occurred in the interpreted basalt position at about -1000mRL. Drilling in late 2010 



 

54 

 

returned 5.45m at 13.7g/t Au and 2.5m at 15.4g/t Au from highly silicified zones on the Eastern flank 

of the basalt contact. Follow up surface diamond drilling was completed in September 2011 showing 

the mineralisation was hosted in multiple narrow "waterloos" on the eastern flank but with little 

continuity of the initial results. The area was downgraded after preliminary modelling resulted in a 

potential endowment much less than required developing an area 1.6km from the nearest 

underground workings. 

9.6.2 Stawell Fault 

A surface RC program in late December 2009 targeted the interpreted position of the Stawell Fault 

the footwall of the South Fault.  The 10 hole, 1414m program failed to intersect the Stawell Fault or 

any associated mineralisation. MT results from the Wonga Gift deeps program, conducted at the 

same time, showed a steeply dipping resistive structure, possibly the Stawell Fault, further west of 

the RC drilling.   

9.6.3 Wonga Gift South 

In mid 2011, several infill MT lines over the Wonga Gift Deeps were completed by Geophysical 

Resources and Services Pty. Ltd. (GRS). One line returned a very strong sub vertical conductive 

anomaly which was then targeted with a single surface diamond drill hole. The anomaly was not 

associated with gold mineralisation but from fine grained pyrite within the sediment. Gold 

mineralisation was identified elsewhere in the hole, hosted within a steep south westerly dipping 

fault. Geochemical analysis indicates Wonga Style mineralisation. This fault could be the southern 

continuation of the target as it correlates well with the position and orientation of the MT anomaly. 

The target remains prospective with a possible mineralised strike length that could exceed 600m. 

9.7 Wonga Pit 

Two drilling campaigns have been completed since September 2008 to evaluate the potential for cut 

backs on the existing pit to the north, west and southeast. The northern extension proved viable 

and was mined throughout 2011. A third campaign is nearing completion to test the viability of the 

southeastern cut back.  Resource work on the southeastern cutback is ongoing. 

9.8 Regional Exploration 

Regional exploration focuses on the northern extension of the Moonambel Metamorphic Complex 

looking for repeats of the Magdala System. At Stawell, the Palaeozoic basement outcrops, but 10km 

further north it is obscured by the much younger Cenozoic Murray Basin Sediments (clays and 

flowing sands) which become deeper further north. Identification of basalt bodies in the corridor is 

initially by gravity and magnetic data where they show up as coincident gravity and magnetic 

anomalies. Further work usually involves drilling, either diamond or air core to confirm the presence 

of basalt. With the exception of the Commercial Road basalt, all basalts explored have been 

discovered prior to September 2008. 

In addition to exploration of basalt bodies, fault hosted gold mineralisation either as quartz lodes or 

Wonga style; have also been explored for with the successful discovery of the Wonga Gift South 

mineralisation. 



 

55 

 

Locations for all regional exploration are shown in Figure 9-2. 

 

Figure 9-2 Regional tenements ELs 3008, 4279 and 4429 superimposed on aeromagnetics outling 

regional exploration from September 2008 - April 2012 

9.8.1 Wildwood 

Haines Surveys Pty. Ltd. Conducted a gravity survey in September 2008.  The area of interest was a 

weak to moderate anomaly to the west and running parallel to the defined Wildwood Basalt Dome 

(25km northwest along strike from the Magdala Basalt Dome), and interpreted to be a possible 

buried basalt. 

Diamond drilling during 2008 concentrated on the north western zone where a basalt contact shoot 

plunged to the north as defined by previous diamond drilling. Results were poor with little evidence 

of continuity between intercepts. 



 

56 

 

An update of the 3D gravity and magnetic inversions were completed by MIRA Geoscience in 2009 

and coupled with MIMDAS completed by GRS in 2010 show the main basalt dome as a coincident 

magnetic and gravity anomaly with another previous undiscovered dome to the east with highly 

chargeable zones on all contacts. The chargeable zones were targeted in early 2012 with diamond 

drilling and were found to be sourced by fine grained euhedral pyrite within carbonaceous schist 

rather than sulphides associated within basalt contact mineralisation. The program has since being 

abandoned with the final hole currently targeting the anomaly identified in the 2008 gravity survey. 

9.8.2 Wal Wal 

The confirmed basalt body at Wal Wal was tested with three MT survey lines conducted by GRS 

from 2010-2011. The resultant 2D inversion shows a large resistive dome consistent with the Wal 

Wal Basalt, one line also displays a steeply dipping moderately conductive feature to the west of the 

basalt.  

9.8.3 Lubeck 

The Lubeck magnetic anomaly was targeted with two MT survey lines conducted by GRS. Resultant 

2D inversions show the west dipping Coongee Fault, the eastern boundary of the Stawell Corridor. 

A second resistive structure to the west of the Coongee fault could be the Lubeck basalt dome. The 

prospect has been downgraded as closer to Stawell, the immediate hangingwall of the Coongee Fault 

has been found to be a poor environment for basalt contact mineralisation. 

9.8.4 Germania 

Germania is a coincident gravity and magnetic anomaly approximately 10km NNW of the Magdala 

dome. A ground gravity survey was completed by Haines Surveys Pty. Ltd. in 2010; with the better 

resolution the anomaly was found to consist of two dense anomalies with a resistive structure 

between. The West Germania historical workings, where gold was mined from hardrock quartz 

lodes, lie on this structure. MT was completed by GRS in 2010 across the gravity anomaly indicating 

a deep seated resistive dome consistent with a possible basalt flanked by slightly conductive zones. 

9.8.5 Pleasant Creek 

The Pleasant Creek target is a coincident magnetic and gravity high to the west of the Magdala 

Dome and lies on the northern margin of the Stawell Granite. Initial exploration concentrated on 

geophysical techniques with a gravity survey conducted by Haines Surveys Pty. Ltd. in October 2008 

resulting in an update of the 3D gravity inversion model by MIRA Geoscience in 2009. Zonge 

conducted an MT survey in late 2009.  The survey encountered strong interference from surface 

artefacts; however, a large resistive feature consistent with a basalt dome was interpreted and 

targeted with RC drilling in early 2010. 

Two RC holes were drilled for a total of 404m revealing highly strained interbedded amphibolite and 

coarse sediments with no contact mineralisation. A diamond tail was drilled onto the end of one of 

the holes extending the depth to 449.5m and confirming the geology. No significant gold 

mineralisation or favourable geology was intersected; Pleasant Creek is no longer considered 

prospective.  



 

57 

 

9.8.6 Commercial Road 

The Commercial Road anomaly is a strong gravity and moderate magnetic anomaly striking east-

west located to the west of the Magdala Dome, directly under the township of Stawell. Access is 

difficult, but two areas were available for diamond drilling and CRD001-003 were drilled in early 

2010. Drilling confirmed the presence of a basalt dome bound to the north by the Wildcat Fault with 

structural studies indicating the east-west orientation being a result of the rotation of the Scallans 

Basalt (northwest striking basalt immediately southeast of the Commercial Road Basalt). No basalt 

contact mineralisation was intersected with contact sediments considered too coarse for Magdala 

Facies development. The area is still considered prospective due to its size, but access is severely 

limited due to urban surface infrastructure. 

9.8.7 West Magdala 

The West Magdala target is to the west of the Magdala Dome, within the footwall of the Wildcat 

Fault. The West Magdala basalt also manifests as a coincident magnetic and gravity anomaly. A single 

hole was drilled into the geophysical anomalies, intersecting the basalt. The basalt is not typical of 

Magdala style basalt, instead having a high magnetite content, chlorite and epidote alteration and a 

fabric defined by hornblende. No basalt contact mineralisation was intersected, which is unlikely as 

geological conditions are not favourable with coarse grained sediments on the basalt contact. 

9.9 Ongoing Exploration Program 

Ongoing exploration for the remainder of 2012 will revisit regional prospects within the northern 

Stawell corridor up to 40km from Stawell, with low cost, low impact methods such as Ionic Leach 

soil sampling and MT geophysical surveys. Both methods have been proven to penetrate the cover 

sediments returning good quality data pertaining to the basement rocks.  In the more mature 

prospects such as Wildwood and Wal Wal where the basalt position is delineated from previous 

drilling, diamond drilling is proposed rather than cheaper drilling alternatives to provide the 

necessary structural data vital to exploration in the Stawell Zone.  It is the most successful drilling 

technique in dealing with the cover sediments. Near mine exploration will continue with 

underground drilling in the GG6 South project and surface diamond drilling in the Wonga Gift South 

project. 

These targets and proposed exploration expenditure are summarised in Figure 9-3 and Table 9-2, all 

areas have had various levels of exploration over recent years.

Beyond 2012, exploration will concentrate on the timely preparation of near mine prospects 

(<10km) north of Stawell for resource definition by 2015 dependent upon favourable drilling results. 

Prospects further afield (10-40km) will employ low impact exploration to further delineate targets 

for extensive drilling from 2014 onwards with the objective of leading to resource definition beyond 

2015. Exploration reconnaissance, mostly low impact first pass exploration will be applied to the 

tenement portfolio to define potential prospective areas previously overlooked. 

Preliminary proposed exploration expenditure is summarised in Table 9-3.

9.9.1 Wildwood 

As discussed in section 9.8, exploration in the Wildwood area will change focus from the main basalt 

dome to the weak geophysical anomaly to the west. Drilling is currently underway, approaching the 

western side of the anomaly. Upon completion, a review of the area will take place evaluating the 

prospect and further exploration. 

9.9.2 Golden Gift 6 South 

Development of the GG6 and GG6L has introduced a new drill platform to allow for holes to target 

further south beyond the reach of previous drilling outlined in Section 9.4.3. A total of three holes 

for 1,893m are proposed to take place in Q4, 2012. 



 

60 

 

9.9.3 Wonga Gift South 

Diamond drilling will scope the steep south westerly fault outlined in Section 9.6.3 to test the 

continuity of the fault hosted mineralisation to both the north and the south. A total of four holes 

for 2,515m are proposed to take place in Q3, 2012.   

9.9.4 Commercial Road 

Further exploration on the Commercial Road Basalt (Section 9.8.6) is restricted to low impact 

exploration techniques due to surface infrastructure; soil sampling has been proposed for Q2, 2012 

to allow testing of a large portion of the ~1km strike length with little disruption to the community. 

9.9.5 Germania 

Germania is considered highly prospective with evidence for both a basalt dome at about 300m 

below surface and quartz lode mineralisation. Further work will be conducted in Q2-Q3 in 

preparation for diamond drilling beyond 2012.  An Infill MT survey will better define the resistive 

anomaly at depth believed to be a basalt dome. Soil sampling using the Ionic Leech method will be 

conducted over the area to identify anomalous geochemistry. 

9.9.6 Browns 

Browns is comprised of a large gravity and magnetic anomaly of approximately 5km strike length 

oriented parallel and to the west of the Magdala Basalt. The prospect has been drilled previously in 

2005 in which the anomaly was interpreted to be a Magdala repeat. Air core, RC and diamond drill 

holes revealed the source of the anomaly to by thin sheets of basalt interbedded with sediments of 

varying composition. No basalt contact mineralisation was identified and the project was abandoned. 

However, several sporadic anomalous gold results were returned including a diamond drill hole with 

1.2m at 17.68 g/t Au in a fault zone which includes a 0.9m laminated quartz vein with elevated 

sulphides. 

Exploration in 2012 aims to revisit the area, this time targeting quartz lode mineralisation hosted 

within faults similar to the Stawell Fault. Examination of gravity data shows NNW trending gravity 

"lows" running parallel to the Stawell fault with strike lengths of up to 5km. This is further 

supported by five historical workings along these trends. A combination of MT surveys and ionic 

leach soil sampling are proposed during Q2-Q3 to delineate any potential drilling targets within the 

large prospective zone.  

9.9.7 Glenorchy 

Glenorchy is identified as a moderate, coincident gravity and magnetic anomaly situated 3.5km to the 

southwest of the Wildwood Dome, within EL3008.  A total of two diamond holes and 73 air core 

holes have been drilled with some anomalous gold results.  Drilling was targeting Stawell Fault style 

hanging wall quartz lodes in the Pleasant Creek Fault and revealed a distinct change in lithology from 

chloritic sediments to carbonaceous shales in the fault position.  Although anomalous gold 

mineralisation has been identified, significant quartz veining typical of the Hanging-wall Lodes is yet to 

be identified. Both MT surveys and ionic leach soil sampling are proposed to identify targets for 

future drilling. 



 

61 

 

9.9.8 Wal Wal 

Ionic leach soil sampling will take place over the entire Wal Wal Basalt (Section 9.8) to identify areas 

of anomalous geochemistry, this coupled with the 2010-2011 MT survey will be used as targets for 

diamond drill proposed for Q3.  A total of 3-4 diamond drill holes for 1,085m will concentrate on 

the western side of the basalt where there is potential for basalt contact mineralisation and fault 

hosted quartz lodes. 

9.9.9 Deep Lead 

Deep Lead is a gravity anomaly situated in restricted crown land approximately 8km North West of 

Stawell. Nearby are the Deep Lead Placer deposit workings which were recorded as producing 

40,497oz from 210,934 tonnes at an average of 5.97 g/t Au. Exploration in this area is restricted to 

low impact activities due to it being located in a forest reserve. Past exploration drilling in the area 

confirms the northern continuation of the NNW striking Stawell Fault and soil sampling shows 

slightly anomalous gold results were returned in a NNW trend which matches the gravity anomaly. 

Further work was not progressed due to the restrictions to exploration within the reserve; a low 

impact ionic leach soil program is proposed to follow up on these anomalous results. 

9.10 Exploration and Mineral Tenure 

Stawell Gold Mines comprises a package of tenements covering the Stawell Belt and areas south of 

Ballarat covering an area of approximately 1986km2. A number of these tenements are under farm in 

or JV agreements (Figure 9-4 and Table 9-4). 

Under the Victorian Minerals Resources (Sustainable Development) Act 1990 ongoing 

relinquishment of tenements is required at regular intervals. These being 25% of the original 

tenement size at the end of year 2 and 35% of the original tenement size at the end of year 4. 

Amendments to the act which came into effect on the 1st Feb 2012 require an additional  20% of the 

original tenement size at the end of year 7 and  10% of the original tenement size at the end of year 

10 (leaving 10% of the original tenement area).  Exploration Licences that are more than 10 years 

old may be renewed for up to an additional 2 years. Further renewal may be given for a period not 

exceeding 2 years but only in exceptional circumstances and where it can be demonstrated that 

there is likelihood of identifying a mineral resource in the term.  Following this term no further 

renewals are allowed. Tenements that are greater than 10 years old will have the 7 year and 10 year 

relinquishments applied (for a total of 30%) at their next renewal.  An outline of current SGM 

tenements can be found in table 9.4 below noting a number of Stawell Gold Mines tenements ages 

are at, exceeding or coming up to their 7 and 10 year anniversaries and will require additional 

relinquishment of area or the tenement. 

EL3008 is considered a "strategic" exploration tenement under the Act amendments and may be 

renewed for up to 5 years with no additional relinquishment requirements. Further renewals for a 

period up to 2 years may be given only in exceptional circumstances and where it can be 

demonstrated that there is likelihood of identifying a mineral resource in that term. Following this 

term no further renewals are allowed. 

MIN5520 is a licence that does not currently have any mining activity being undertaken.  Exploration 

is underway to define the prospectively of the northern extent of the Magdala system and current 



 

62 

 

mine area. Under the Victorian Minerals Resources (Sustainable Development) Act 1990 a MIN may 

have up to 2 years of exploration activity before a work plan to mine must be submitted or the 

licence reverted back to an existing EL.

10.1 Stawell Gold Mines Mineral Resource Definition Process 

The Mineral Resource definition process at SGM is an ongoing activity. Current Mineral Resources 

extend from surface to 1800mRL (effectively 1800m below surface). Geological information is 

collected by a variety of methods with the objective of improving the confidence of the Mineral 

Resource estimates prior to and during the mining process including grade control drilling for 

development and stope definition. 

Given the continuous and ongoing nature of the Mineral Resource process the data utilised varies as 

the mining operations develop towards the resource area (Table 10-1). A summary of the main 

drilling methodologies employees and data types utilised is as follows with specific details on the 

sampling and assaying methodologies given below.

10.2 Drilling Process 

A flowsheet of the diamond drill process from design to implementation is shown in Figure 10-1. 

The diamond drill contract personnel provide a daily record of drilling activities for all drill rigs. A 

copy of a daily drill record sheet is shown in Figure 10-2Error! Reference source not found.. 

Data from the daily record sheet is entered daily to a site database for tracking of drilling production 

and to enable tracking of drilling progress interrogation at a later date.  

Geological personnel track the drill hole path and maintain in control of the daily activities of all drill 

rigs including which drillers were responsible for various sections of the hole should there be issues 

with core presentation or down hole depths that require clarification. A regime of regular rig audits 

and inspections are also used to assist with maintaining the high level of core presentation and 

sample quality. These drill records are kept indefinitely enabling review of drillhole information many 

years after completion of drilling.

10.3 Drill Spacing 

Drill spacing varies for exploration, resource definition and grade control programs within the 

ranges as indicated in Table 10-1. The appropriate Resource classifications indicated in this table are 

a guide only and each Mineral Resource area is classified based on a number of criteria are discussed 

in Section 14 of the report. Each of the Mineral Resource areas discussed in Section 14 of this 

report will have drilling at various hole spacing depending upon the stage of resource development 

and mining activities. 

Initially the exploration drilling is carried out on broad spaced targets, and if the continuity of the 

structure is apparent, as in the case of known Basalt bodies the targets will generally be tested on 

centres 160m along strike and 120m down dip (160m x 120m).  

When exploration is successful in locating appropriately mineralised environments this spacing is 

closed down to approximately 80m along strike x 60m up and down dip. If updated geological 

interpretations completed at this drill spacing are able to demonstrate geological continuity and 

define sufficient grade to complete and define a Mineral Resource it is possible to classify the defined 

Mineral Resources as Inferred. 

Ongoing drilling will be completed once appropriate drill platforms can be established to enable the 

drill spacing to be reduced to 30m x 40m centres. At this spacing if the geological and grade 

continuity is well constrained a Mineral Resource could be classified as Indicated Resource. 

Generally at this stage final mine design and scheduling is possible and capital development 

infrastructure can be designed and commenced to access the area for mining including the design of 

appropriate platforms to complete ongoing Resource definition and grade control diamond drilling. 

Grade control diamond drilling targets a drill spacing of at least 15m to 20m, along strike, by 15m to 

20m, up and down dip, on the mineralised structures. This drilling is a component of the mine 

production process and is required to identify any small scale changes in geometry which will affect 

mining shapes. Where the geometries are complicated by faulting or other geological features then 

the spacing can locally be closed to 10m x 10m. Following this work detailed stope and development 

design is completed and ore development is designed and implemented under survey control. As a 

general rule only following development or sufficient close spaced diamond drilling will a Mineral 

Resource be classified as Measured. 

As development is implemented every face or development round (3.8m to 4.0m spacing) is visited 

by SGM geological personnel to map the location of the major contacted and structures exposed by 

the development. This information is critical in ensuring development is in the correct location and 

also to provide the detailed geological information required for final stope extraction and stope 

tonnes and grade determination. Sludge sampling programs are completed only where there is a 

requirement to gain additional geological information beyond that already available. Drilling is 

completed in fans of holes drilled up from the development locations (a typical fan is shown in Figure 

10-3). These fans are only completed as required but may be as close as 8m to 10m along strike and 

on rare occasions 5m along strike when structural complexity is high or ore geometries vary. 



 

73 

 

 

Figure 10-3 Typical sludge drilling fan completed from an ore development drive. The drive 

outline is shown as well as the geological mapping collected from each face location. The uphole 

drill fans are coloured by logged geology, green = potentially mineralised volcanogenics, yellow = 

basalt. 

10.4 Drillhole Orientation 

Where possible, drilling is oriented perpendicular to the structures being tested. The nature of the 

mineralisation at Stawell and the availability of suitable drilling platforms in the underground 

environment will always result in compromises in the ability to obtain near perpendicular tests of the 

mineralisation. An example of the orientations of the drill holes through the C7/D1 and GG6 

Mineral Resource area is shown in Figure 10-4 and Figure 10-5. Similar drillhole orientations relative 

to the strike and dip of the structure exist in many of the Mineral Resource areas. 

An exception to this is the Big Hill Resource area where drilling has been conducted on a regular 

20m along strike intervals with the drillholes oriented perpendicular to the strike and dip of the main 

mineralisation system with an up and down dip spacing of 25m.

bright green; Kensei schist lode = Teal; Zulu Waterloo = pink). 

10.5 Collar Survey Control 

All survey control for the underground drilling programs is established by SGM survey personnel. 

Survey control points are maintained in the underground decline by SGM survey personnel and 

these locations provide the control for all mark out and pick-up surveying that is conducted in the 

underground environment. On conclusion of drilling and drillhole grouting, diamond drilling 

personnel will insert a wooden wedge labelled with the drillhole ID into the collar of the hole. This 



 

76 

 

provides permanent identification of the drillhole collar to ensure matching of surveying information 

to the correct drillhole collars. The collar survey information is entered in the SGM database by data 

managers. An example of the information supplied by SGM surveyors and the checklist utilised to 

ensure appropriate information is collated is shown in Figure 10-6. 

The coordinate system in use at Stawell is a modified version of AMG which is discussed in Section 

4.4. All survey data pertaining to the mining operation is stored in this coordinate system. 

 

Figure 10-6 Collar survey information and drill hole survey information checklist. 

10.6 Downhole Survey Control 

Downhole survey control is managed by utilising downhole cameras to survey the drillhole path. 

Electronic single shot instruments (REFLEX® and RANGER® tools) have progressively been used in 

preference to the Eastman® mechanical cameras since 2002 at SGM as shown in Figure 10-7, and 

the vast majority of the down hole surveys of diamond drill holes that are utilised in the estimation 

of the Mineral Resource estimate detailed in this report have been made with Electronic single shot 

cameras. Some of the deeper surface diamond drill holes have been surveyed using a North Seeking 

Gyro instrument.  

Downhole survey instruments routinely measure azimuth relative to magnetic north and declination 

(dip) relative to the horizontal. A correction is applied to convert Magnetic North to Grid North. 

The detail of how this correction is currently applied is shown in Figure 10-8.

Contract drilling personnel are responsible for providing survey information at pre-determined 

spacings down the drillhole. The first survey is taken at 15m downhole and is effectively used as the 

collar survey. This depth is used as it reduces the influence of magnetics effects associated with the 

drill rig and support equipment. Subsequent surveys are taken at 30m spacing or at closer intervals 

where deemed necessary by the supervising geologist. The contract personnel record survey details 

on the daily drilling record sheet and also on a separate survey record sheet (Figure 10-9) from 

which the information is entered to the acQuire database system. The electronic instruments 

provide a direct reading of the magnetic field intensity at the survey locations. This reading can be 

used to determine if survey readings have been influenced by magnetic material downhole.

contract personnel 

10.7 Downhole Survey Quality Control 

Several quality control and quality assurance processes are in place to ensure that appropriate 

survey (downhole and collar) information is stored to the database. Apart from the Database 

Managers checklist as shown in Figure 10-6, a review sheet for the downhole survey information is 

provided to the responsible geologists such that this information can be validated and where 

required adjustments made to the survey information. A copy of this sheet is shown in (Figure 

10-10).

Figure 10-10 An example of drillhole collar survey information.  Note some corrections to 

erroneous data have been made as indicated 

 

For longer drillhole traces the survey information is plotted to provide a graphical review of the 

information method is utilised where adjustments to the survey information can be made using the 

overall trend of the drillhole trace, Figure 10-11. 



 

80 

 

 

Figure 10-11 Example of the check plots used to correct downhole survey information. 

 

Where clear discrepancies have been identified with the validity of the survey information and 

adjusted surveys entered, the original surveys are given a lower priority in the database system. A 

record of survey methods and or adjustments are maintained in the main acQuire database as part 

of the audit trail. 

Stawell Gold Mines personnel utilise a survey camera test bed with known azimuth and dip to 

routinely check the accuracy of the downhole survey cameras. This test bed (Figure 10-12) is located 

on the surface well away from any potential magnetic sources and is utilised by contract drilling 

personnel to routinely check camera performance and determine if equipment requires servicing or 

re-calibration.

10.8 Diamond Drill Core Processing 

All diamond drill core is delivered to the SGM core processing facility by the diamond drill 

contractor. Diamond drill core is washed to remove grease and individual core trays are 

photographed in a light controlled installation (Figure 10-13) prior to laying out on benches ready for 

logging by the site geologists. As part of the standard SGM geological procedures, all core collected 

from diamond drill holes is photographed and a complete record of digital core photographs is 

available to assist in the geological interpretation process.

drillcore.  

10.9 Logging 

All diamond drill core is logged by the site geological teams using a standardised logging 

methodology. The data is captured electronically at the point of collection using either a barcode 

logging "Datcol" software system or and acQuire logging system. The "Datcol" system was 

developed on site in the mid 1990's and has remained the standard process since that time where 

the key tables for lithology, alteration, structure, and geotechnical information are populated during 

the logging process. During 2009 the acQuire logging system was developed to replace the "Datcol" 

system. The acQuire logging system utilises the same standard key tables for the lithology, alteration, 

structure, and geotechnical information, which are populated during the logging process. 

10.10 Core Recovery 

During the logging process any lost core is estimated and logged as lost core with a specific start and 

end interval.  

A review of database for recently drilled holes indicates exceptionally good core recovery 

throughout the deposit particularly adjacent to the major mineralised zones. Where core is lost it is 

usually associated with significant faulting. Lost core is identified in the logging as "LOST" and as such 

there are very few if any assay intervals utilised in the Mineral Resource estimate where core 

recovery is less than 100%. 

10.11 Diamond Drill Core Sampling 

During the logging process the geologist will mark up the intervals of core required for sampling. 

Not all diamond core is sampled. Historical sampling has identified the key lithological and structural 



 

85 

 

units that will host mineralisation and the selection of units for sampling follows the protocols shown 

below. 

 All Magdala Facies, also known as 'Magdala volcanogenics' are sampled for assay 

 A minimum of 2.0m into the hangingwall and/or footwall is sampled 

 Fault zones and zones of sulphide are sampled at the geologists discretion 

 Magdala Basalt and Albion Formation units are sampled at the discretion of the logging 

geologist 

Not all diamond core is cut in half prior to sampling. Sampling of diamond drill core follows one of 

two methods as detailed below. 

1. Exploration and Resource Definition – HQ or NQ drill programs 

o Core is logged and geological derived intervals are marked up for sampling 

o Sample intervals are matched to geological boundaries (structural or lithological) and 

fall within the range of 0.10m to 2.0m. The average sample interval is approximately 

1.0m 

o For Resource definition drilling programs 1 in 5 holes is cut with a diamond saw 

prior to sampling and one half of the core is sent for assay. The remaining half core 

is retained as a record within the core library. All other drillholes are sampled as 

whole core, which is sent for sample preparation and assay as per the flow sheet 

shown in Figure 10-14. All drillholes deemed to be for the purpose of exploration 

are ½ core sampled and the entire remaining core retained in storage on site at 

SGM. 

2. Grade control diamond drill programs – NQ or LTK60 

o Core is logged and geological derived intervals are marked up for sampling 

o Sample intervals are matched to geological boundaries (structural or lithological) and 

fall within the range of 0.10m to 2.0m. The average sample interval is approximately 

1.0m 

o For grade control drilling programs drillholes are sampled as whole core with the 

entire sample sent for sample preparation and assay as per the flow sheet shown in 

Figure 10-14. 

Detailed operating procedures for sampling of diamond drill core are used at Stawell Gold Mines to 

ensure uniformity of process and prevent errors. 

10.12 Diamond Drill Core Sample Intervals 

Exploration physicals for the 2011 year totalled 19.422m of drilling comprising 34 drillholes. The 

2011 exploration drilling areas are shown in Figure 10-16 below. The 2012 drilling to the end of 

March totalled 5,431m with a number of these drillholes in the process of being logged and sampled 

at the time of reporting. 

 



 

86 

 

 

 

Figure 10-16 The 2011 exploration drilling areas 

 



 

87 

 

 

The 2011 resource definition drilling was undertaken from underground platforms to better define 

mineralised targets which had been scoped by exploration drilling. Resource definition and 

production drilling areas in the 2011 period has included Wonga Pit, Federal Albion, Mariners, 

C7/D1 and GG6. Drill physicals for the 2011 year totalled grade control and resource definition for 

275 drillholes. The 2011 grade control and resource definition drill areas are shown on Figure 10-17. 

The 2012 drilling to the end of March totalled 7,587m with a number of these holes in the process 

of being logged and sampled at the time of reporting.

The sample interval statistics for the 2011 are shown in Table 10-2, the same sample methodologies 

are utilised for 2012 and it is anticipated similar sample lengths will be achieved. The average sample 

intervals demonstrated by the 2012 data is very similar to samples taken in 2011 and indicative of 

the complete data set utilised to estimate Mineral Resource at Stawell.

10.13 RC Sampling 

A summary of the RC sampling protocols that were utilised for this program and for other RC 

drilling that has been conducted on site are given below; 

 All SGM RC sampling was carried out using the following protocol 

o Generally the entire hole was sampled from the collar unless it was recognized as 

recent fill or material associated with the construction of the drill pads 

o Samples were collected at 1.0m sampling interval, bit pulled back and flushed 

between intervals 

o Samples discharged into tightly fitting plastic sample bag from cyclone  

o Sample transferred to a rectangular plastic tub the same size as the splitter 

o Sample tipped into three tier splitter from plastic tub to ensure equal quantities 

available to all vanes 

o 1/12 sub split (nominally 3kg) collected in calico sample bag, tied and placed in lots of 

five into plastic bags 

o Residue sample collected in original sample bag and transported to bag farm for 

storage 

o Splitter cleaned by shaking/banging/brush/air compressor as necessary between 

samples 

o Cyclone cleaned at regular intervals (completion of each hole minimum) by 

banging/checked by hand/arm 

o Every 20th sample re-split to give a 2nd 3kg sample, field splits dispatched along with 

first splits 

o Samples dispatched to Laboratory for analysis by Fire Assay. In the case of the Big 

Hill Mineral resource estimate all assaying was conducted at Aminya Laboratories 

Ballarat

10.14 Reliability of Samples 

It is the opinion of the Qualified Person that the drilling and sampling methodologies employed by 

SGM are of a high standard and provide representative tests of the ore body suitable for the 

estimation of Mineral Resources. Standard drill spacing's adopted by SGM are appropriate for the 

various stages of Mineral Resource development and whilst other factors also contribute to 

decisions regarding classification of the Mineral Resources the drill spacing's discussed in this section 

enable appropriate geological interpretation and Mineral Resource classification decisions to be 

made. 



 

91 

 

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 

SECURITY 

The Qualified Person has reviewed the sample preparation, assay and sample security 

processes utilised at SGM a summary of which is included in this section. All sampling and 

sample preparation is currently completed by employees of SGM. The employees follow 

appropriate written procedures as documented in the section. 

11.1 Assay Laboratories 

During the life of the SGM a number of laboratories have been utilised for routine assaying 

of diamond drillcore and RC samples. The details of the laboratories and the periods for 

which assaying has been conducted are as follows; 

 SGM site laboratory. Utilised intermittently prior to 1995 for assaying of diamond 
drill core and RC samples 

o Non accredited company assay laboratory 

o Assay method was 10g Aqua Regia with pre digest roasting and AAS finish. 

o Assaying of diamond drill core and RC samples was discontinued in 1995 

and the laboratory sample preparation and assay methods updated to 

industry standard practice 

o Now utilise a 25g Aqua Regia method with pre-digest roasting and AAS 

finish 

o Utilised for Metallurgical assaying, UG Face sample and other geological 

grade control sampling 

o Undertake routine sample preparation of diamond drill core samples – post 

2004. 

 WMC Ballarat Assay laboratory utilised prior to 1995 for assaying of diamond 
drill core and RC samples 

o Non accredited company assay laboratory 

o Assay method was 10g Aqua Regia with pre digest roasting and AAS finish.  

o Assaying of diamond drill core and RC samples was discontinued in 1995 

and the laboratory sample preparation and assay methods updated to 

industry standard practice. 

 AMDEL Laboratories - Adelaide SA 

o ISO 9001 accredited 

o utilised intermittently from 1995 through to present day  

o Primary supplier of assay services during from 2004 – mid 2007 

o Ongoing utilization for check assays  

o SGM reduced reliance on AMDEL mid 2007 as a result of very slow 

turnaround of assays results 

 AMINYA Laboratories – Ballarat VIC 

o Not accredited 



 

92 

 

o Primary supplier of Assay services for Diamond drill core and RC samples 

period 1995 – 2004 

o Discontinued in 2004 

 Intertek Genalysis formally Genalysis Laboratory Services – Perth WA 

o Genalysis is a NATA accredited laboratory to ISO 17025. 

o Provider of assay services during the period 2004 - 2006 

 ALS Laboratory Group – Orange NSW 

o ALS is accredited to ISO 9001 and ISO 17025  

o Primary provider of assay services to SGM from August 2007 to present day 

11.2 Sample Preparation 

The sample preparation protocol for diamond drill core is shown in the flow sheet given in 

Figure 11-1. This sample preparation flow sheet was developed in 1995 and has been in 

operation for all SGM diamond core and RC samples since that time.  

During the period 1995 to 2004 all sample preparation was conducted by the assay 

laboratory facilities. In 2004 it was decided by site personnel to complete this task on site at 

the SGM laboratory facility. The sample preparation follows the same process utilising 

modern sample preparation equipment. 

 Daily Primary Crusher and Pulveriser size fraction calibrations are reported in the 

weekly SGM site laboratory report to ensure that the size fractions are meeting the 

set standards.  The size fraction calibration for the Crusher is 75% of material must 

past through a 2mm screen (LABSOP-060 Boyd Crusher Size Fraction Analysis).  

For the Pulveriser the size fraction calibration is 90% of material must pass through a 

75µm screen (LABSOP-061 LM5 Pulveriser Size Fraction Analysis). 

 A quartz flush is inserted, at a 1:5 ratio, at the crushing stage for all Diamond and 

RC drill core.  If visible gold is identified at the logging stage then a quartz flush is 

inserted after every sample within that mineralized zone. 

 Splitting using a vibrating feed cone splitter. 

 Pulverising to 95% passing 75um using Labtechnics LM5 pulversing mills. 

 A quartz flush is inserted after every sample at the pulverising stage for all Diamond 

and RC drill core. 

By retaining responsibility for this work through the existing site based facility SGM has 

flexibility in sending the pulps only to a variety of assaying laboratories and also retain the 

coarse rejects on site for ongoing metallurgical test work programs.

11.3 Sample Transport and Security 

All drill core and RC samples are delivered directly to the mine site based core farm facility. 

This is on a shift by shift basis for underground drill core and daily basis for all others. 

Access to the mine site is restricted to authorized personnel only or as a visitor under full 

supervision by SGM personnel.  A single site access point exists which is manned 24:7 by 

security personnel. 

Security of drill core and samples is managed by maintaining records throughout the 

complete process from drilling, core processing, logging, sampling, sample preparation and 

assaying through to return of results. 

Key record keeping utilised in managing sample and data security are; 

 Daily drilling records are entered to the database which provides records of drill 

core produced. 

 Core is photographed within 24 hours of being delivered to the core processing 

facility. 

 The SGM sample processing facility is located on the Mine Lease within a 

security fenced area. All core stored here is only able to be accessed by SGM 

personnel. 

 At the conclusion of logging a sample requisition sheet is generated listing 

sample numbers, assay standard insertion and assay requirements. This is loaded 

directly to the acQuire database enabling tracking of samples after this process. 

 SGM personnel are trained in appropriate procedures for logging and sampling 

of the diamond drill core and generate an Analytical Request sheet outlining 

sample ID and assay requirements.  

 The production of carefully labelled sample pulps for dispatch by registered 

posts. 

The pulps are dispatched from the SGM prep laboratory to the assay laboratories using 

registered post or courier services. Consignments travelling by registered post or courier 

services are required to be signed off by each leg of the postage route on arrival and can be 

tracked online. The assay laboratories are also required to send a statement informing SGM 

that the pulps have arrived and that the samples, as detailed on the analytical request sheet 

can be accounted for. 

11.4 Assay Methods  

A summary of the laboratory methods utilised by the various laboratories is given in 

following Table 11-1. All assaying for gold that are utilised in the Mineral Resource estimates 

have been completed by fire assay method (30 – 50g charge weights) with an AAS finish.

For samples reporting below LLD, a value of 0.5xLLD is utilised as standard in resource 

estimation. 

11.5 Database Storage and Integrity 

All SGM drilling data is stored within the "acQuire" Database Management System. The 

database operates in an SQL Server framework and data security is established by having 

various levels of user access rights. Stawell Gold Mines maintain a security access system 

where loading and manipulation of data is only conducted by one of two data managers. All 

geological personnel have access to the database for read only purposes. 

Analysis results are received from laboratory in fixed digital format. The load routine 

imports assay data matching against sample ID created during the logging procedure. 

In March 2010, the acQuire database was updated to the CorpAssay ADM (acQuire Data 

Model) and QAQC functionality "Assay Pending" has been implemented on analysis results 

reported since then.  Assay results are first loaded to the database with an initial priority 

indicating that they have not passed through QAQC.  When subsequently reviewed for 

QAQC, the priority is changed as the result is accepted or rejected.  Only data with a 

priority of 1 is visible in the MineSight drill hole views ensuring QAQC of drill data in the 

model has been approved. 

Data validation occurs during upload of data to database using the acQuire DBMS. Checks 

include: 

 All alphanumeric codes (eg lithology) are valid and not duplicated 

 All numeric fields are within acceptable limits and not duplicated 

 Sample from-to depths cannot be greater than the maximum hole depth 



 

96 

 

 Checks are performed for overlapping samples 

 Analysis results are received from laboratory in fixed digital format. The load routine 

imports assay data matching against sample ID created during logging procedure. 

Alpha analysis codes are stored as logged and/or reported e.g. NS (Not Sampled), IS 

(Insufficient Sample), <0.01. The database MetaAssayExport table records equivalent values 

which are substituted by client software (e.g. MineSight). The convention for defined values 

is a numeric value half detection limit for results at LLD, and for all other codes, -1 is 

substituted. 

After data compilation is complete, it is critically reviewed by geologists with on-going 

scrutiny using logs, section/plan plotting and 3D modeling. 

After data compilation is complete, it is critically reviewed by geologists with on-going 

scrutiny using logs, section/plan plotting and 3D modelling. 

11.6 SGM Assay QA/QC Process 

The general flow sheet for the sample preparation and assaying including the Quality 

Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) samples submitted to ensure this compliance is 

shown in Figure 11-1.  

 Exploration diamond drill core is routinely Half Core sampled 

 Mine diamond drill core is mostly Full Core sampled, with approximately 1 in every 

5 holes being half core sampled. Samples are crushed and pulverised 

 Routine assaying of diamond drill core samples has been undertaken utilising fire 

assay methodologies (30 gram charges) with an AAS finish 

 Screen Fire Assay is also completed on samples in which visible Au was observed 

during the logging process 

 Assays are reported to an LLD of 0.01ppm.  For sample reporting below LLD, a 

value of 0.5 x LLD is used in resource estimation 

 Sample QA/QC procedure incorporates routine check assays including repeats (re-

assay or repeat assay), duplicate (second sample taken after pulverisation), splits (half 

coarse sample split, at ratio approx 1:10 samples), and standards 

 The SGM QAQC process was independently reviewed by Quantitative Group 

consultants in July 2011 and February 2012.  QG found the system in place to be a 

robust and appropriate process for ensuring quality assay returns (Stewart July 2011 

and Stewart Feb 2012). 

 

11.6.1 QAQC Checks and actions 

A range of checks and resulting actions are in place to monitor the QA/QC of the SGM data 

set as set out in the QA/QC flow sheet shown in Figure 11-2Error! Reference source 

not found.. When monitoring these checks, the following guidelines are followed:

SGM - Au Assay Standard Reference Material Performance

If the standard assay is outside ±3 standard deviations from the known value then ~50% of 

that batch is automatically repeated, similarly if two standards report outside ±2 standard 

deviations then ~50% of that batch will be repeated. Entry is made into the onsite QA/QC 

diary to indicate which sample IDs have been repeated. 

The standard performance over time for each standard used for the model update is 

individually graphed and reviewed. This is to understand if non-compliant standards were 

well spread across all standard material in use and if it is likely a result of the tightness of the 

confidence intervals. The spread of the standard results for each standard are reviewed to 

identify any potential positive or negative bias.   Figure 11-4 and Figure 11-5 show examples 

of the December 2011 G6 model analysis of the standard reference materials SGM1 and 

OR10c respectively.

Figure 11-5 OR10c standard performance for GG6 December 2011 resource 

model update. 

Blanks 

Regular insertion of basalt blanks are inserted at the sampling stage (1:20 ratio), to monitor 

sample contamination or sample homogeneity. If the blanks are not compliant then checks 

are initiated to determine the cause of the non compliance and what remedial action is 

required.   

Figure 11-6 shows the December 2011 G6 model update analysis of the basalt blank assay 

results. This figure shows six Basalt blanks failing within a three week period. The cause to 

these blanks failing was investigated and it was found that there was no contamination at the 

sample preparation stage, however there was actual contamination within the basalt blank 

sample itself.   

Given the SGM laboratory uses of a quartz flush between each sample at the pulverizing 

stage, failed blanks are rarely returned.

Figure 11-6 Blank standard performance for GG6 December 2011 resource 

model update. 

Lab Splits 

Lab splits are taken during the sample preparation crush stage to monitor sample 

preparation and homogeneity. If splits are outside of 10% of the initial assay investigations 

into the quality of the sample preparation for the batch is conducted. 

Figure 11-7 shows the monitored precision for the sample crush stage within the sample 

preparation process given for assay preparation from the December 2011 G6 model update 

drillholes. The graph presented in Figure 11-7 is an indication of the homogeneity of the 

sample after the crush stage and shows whether error is introduced during the splitting of 

this crushed material prior to pulverisation. This analysis shows more than 90% of the 

sample split assays have a relative difference of less than 20% to the original assay value 

indicating an appropriate level of precision through this stage in the sample preparation. 

Figure 11-8 is a Log/Log graphical representation of the same data which is also used to 

analyse the Lab split outliers.  This graph indicates that the split variation more frequently 

occurs in the lower grade range (yellow highlight) which is of lesser interest. The higher 

grade splits are all relatively constant and within acceptable tolerance.

Lab Duplicates and Repeats 

Lab splits and duplicates are taken to monitor sample precision. Three sets of duplicate data 

are collected for SGM samples.   

 The first duplicate data set is collected at the split stage of the sample preparation, 

before pulverisation; every tenth sample is split with the split portion becoming the 

B sample (1:10 ratio). This duplicate is referred to as the lab-split at SGM and 

monitors the precision of the crush and split stages of the sample preparation.

 The second duplicate data set is collected at the fire assay stage; randomly, within a 

1:20 ratio, a second scoop of the pulp is taken and processed in the same batch to 

the original sample. This duplicate is referred to as the duplicate at SGM and 

monitors the precision of the pulverisation sample preparation stage. 

 The third duplicate data set is collected at the fire assay stage; randomly a second 

scoop of the pulp is taken and processed in a different batch to the original sample.  

This duplicate is referred to as the repeat at SGM and monitors the precision of the 

pulverisation sample preparation stage as well as across batch repeatability. This type 

of duplicate can also be requested if the is a non-compliant standard within the 

batch. 

Where duplicates and repeats are outside of 10% of the original sample additional duplicate 

repeats are requested to determine if it is a laboratory issue or associated with coarse gold 

within the sample. 

Figure 11-9 shows the monitored lab duplicate results from the December 2011 G6 Model 

update drillholes.  The graph presented in Figure 11-9 is an indication of the homogeneity of 

the sample after the pulverisation stage.  This analysis shows more than 95% of the duplicate 

assays have a relative difference of less than 10% to the original assay value indicating an 

appropriate level of precision through this stage in the sample preparation. 

Figure 11-10 is a Log/Log graphical representation of the same data which is also used to 

analyse the Lab duplicate outliers.  This graph indicates that the duplicate variation more 

frequently occurs in the lower grade range (yellow highlight) which is of lesser interest.  The 

higher grade duplicates are all relatively constant and within acceptable tolerance.

11.6.2 SGM Standard Reference Material 

Eight standard reference materials are currently being used by SGM, and as per standard 

procedure are inserted at frequencies of 1:20-1:25 samples to monitor accuracy.  All of the 

current standards, except for OR62d are matrix matched. All standards are commercially 

made by Ore Research and Exploration Pty Ltd (ORE) of Melbourne and certification 

certificates are available in SGM records.  The details of the standards and when they were 

introduced to the system are shown in Table 11-3. 

Table 11-3 SGM assay standards and certified values reported by ORE 

 

 

11.7 QA/QC Results for the Current Report 

For this report an analysis of the QA/QC data returned for the current resource estimates 

has been compiled (Table 11-4).  

This analysis encompasses all QA/QC data returned to SGM for the current updates and 

serves to demonstrate that a responsible and ongoing approach to managing assay data 

quality is maintained at SGM and that assaying information is of a good quality for Mineral 

Resource estimation.  

As a result of QA/QC monitoring processes carried out during the current reporting 

period, 2,519 samples were re-assayed from an initial 5,156 assays.    

The proportion of re-assay is variable for each model update and given time period, full 

details of QAQC results can be found in individual reports by area, refer to Table 11-4.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

Messrs James Llorca, Scott Keeling and David Coventry, the Mining Plus Qualified Persons, have not been 

personally involved in the collection and processing of geological data and information pertaining to this 

updated estimation of mineral resources and reserves for SGM.  

Messrs Mark Haydon and Paul Brenchley, the SGM Qualified Persons, have been personally involved in the 

collection and processing of geological data and information pertaining to the estimation of mineral resources 

and reserves for SGM and as such have completed sufficient verification of the sampling, sample preparation 

and analytical procedures, and resulting assay and geological data on which the Mineral Resource estimates are 

based and are comfortable with the quality of the information available. 

To further test the integrity of the information kept within the SGM database, six recent drill holes were 

randomly selected from current resource areas: C7/D1 (MD5891 and MD6094), Golden Gift 6 (MD5921 and 

MD5974), Federal Albion (MD6090) and Mariners (MD6120) Table 12-1. 

 

Table 12-1: Table showing data verification work completed for the 2012 Mineral Resource update. 

 

 

Checks were made to locate the original data for collar locations, down hole surveys, core photographs, and 

end of hole and assay records for each of the drill holes.

12.1 Collar Locations 

The collar locations in the database were compared to coordinates on the original drill request form. The 

surveyed collar of the holes is very close to the original drill request coordinates. 

12.2 Downhole Survey 

Downhole survey information in the database was compared to the original drill survey forms. Data 

inconsistency was identified in MD6090 with the survey depth recorded by the driller as 75.0m and the survey 

depth in the database recorded as 74.4m.  Given that the end of hole depth for MD6090 is 74.4m, this data 

variation is correct, and indicates that there was a driller error on the original drill survey record. 

12.3 Geology 

Geology information in the database was compared to the observed geology in the core photographs.  

A discrepancy was identified in MD6120, where a Breccia Pipe was primarily logged as a Fault zone. The 

logging geologist did identify the rock as a breccia pipe in the logging comments, but did not choose this rock 

code as the main rock type.  Additionally, the interval 118.75 to 119.05 was logged as basalt, however this 

interval is actually a part of the breccia pipe, and should have been logged as such. 

12.4 EOH 

End of hole within the database was compared using collar, geology and assay files and then compared outside 

the database against the core photos.  No end of hole errors were identified. 

12.5 Assay Records 

The assay records in the database were compared with the laboratory reports digital certificates for all holes.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL 

TESTING 

13.1 Metallurgical Test Work 

An ongoing program of metallurgical test work is conducted at SGM in house laboratory facility. The program 

utilises diamond drill core to determine the expected plant recovery for all ore blocks at a stope scale within 

the immediate and long term mine plan.  

Samples of the ore and estimated dilution are tested to determine the expected preg-rob index and expected 

gold recovery through the SGM processing circuit. Samples for metallurgical test work are selected from each 

ore lode; desirably samples are tested for each stope block. In this way expected rates of recovery can be 

determined for individual stope blocks, levels and ore lodes. As the metallurgical test work program is an 

ongoing process the samples being tested to determine recovery rates can be said to be representative of the 

current and future production areas. 

The results of the test work program provide an expected plant recovery on a campaign basis. Stawell Gold 

Mines metallurgists are able to plot the actual versus predicted plant recoveries using the test work results. 

Test work results by area are provided in the attached resource reports and is summarised in Table 13-1, and 

Figure 13-1 and Figure 13-2 below.

Notes: 

1. All Mineral Resources have been estimated in accordance with the JORC Code and have been reconciled to CIM 

Standards as prescribed by National Instrument 43-101. 

2. Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves. 

3. Mineral Resources were estimated using the following parameters:  

a. Gold price of AUD$1450/oz 

b. Wonga surface and Magdala surface above 130mRL and above a nominal 0.8g/t Au cutoff 

4. For the Mineral Resource estimate, the Qualified Person is James Llorca. His details and qualifications can be seen 

in Section 28 of this report. 

5. Mineral Resources are rounded to 1,000 tonnes, 0.01 g/t Au and 1,000 ounces. Minor discrepancies in summations 

may occur due to rounding. 

14.1 Introduction and Scope of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve 

Estimates 

The geographical locations of the various Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve areas for SGM are 

shown in Figure 14-1. This estimate is an update of the previous published Mineral Resources and 

Mineral Reserves "Technical Report for Stawell Gold Mine, Victoria Australia (28 March 2008)" 



 

117 

 

Over the period 2008 – 2011, 192,526 metres of exploration, resource definition and stope definition 

diamond and RC drilling was completed. This drilling has assisted in defining additional Mineral Resources 

and when coupled with detailed mine design and mine planning work has resulted in a material addition 

to the Mineral Reserve. 

This estimate is a compilation of a number of separate models and estimates. Some of the Magdala Upper 

levels areas have been estimated using manual 2D estimation techniques. These individual areas have 

been reviewed as part of updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimate and comply with the 

relevant Mineral Resource classifications as defined by NI 43 101. 

Since 1998, the majority of the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have been estimated using 3D 

geological block models. A number of block models have been created for separate geographical areas. 

The key Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve areas and the date of the most recent updates are 

recorded as follows; 

 Magdala Upper levels – manual 2D methods – historical Estimate based on information from 

31 June 2008 (Fredrickson et al., 2008).  

 Magdala Upper Levels S600 area – historical estimate based on information from 3D block 

model May 2008 (Gardner, 2008). 

 Magdala Surface – 3D block model 1998, separate documentation available Magdala (refer to 

the technical report entitled "Technical Report for Stawell Gold Mine, Victoria Australia (28 

March 2008)").

Quantitative Group was commissioned in 2011 to review the GG6 Resource model and site modelling 

and estimation practices in general. The review of the GG6 model included a detailed investigation of 

drill data, geological interpretations and modelling, variogram modelling, search neighbourhood 

parameters, classification and documentation. In general QG were happy with the model and estimation 

produced stating "It is QG's opinion the GG6 model is well constructed and honours the available data 

and ore body knowledge adequately" (Stewart, M, July 2011). Some recommendations were made 

regarding additional drilling of lower confidence blocks. This is an ongoing process with some of this 

work undertaken in H2 2011 and additional drill meters budgeted for 2012.

14.2 Resource Summary by Area 

14.2.1 C7/D1 

The C7 resource model covers the area from 2400N (70˚ grid) to the defined northern extents, D1 

below the -1119mRL. Central Lode is situated between the Mineschist hangingwall and the low grade 

internal volcanogenic package. Dukes Lode sits against the Dukes Basalt contact, in a footwall position to 

the internal volcanogenic. Both ore lodes are bound underneath by South Fault. Recent modelling 

(August 2011) saw the addition of another ore Lode, the Stockworks Lode which sits between both the 

Central and Dukes lodes.  

At the time of modelling there were ~940 diamond drillholes intersecting the ore body mainly on a 15m 

x 15m intercept grid, spreading out to 30m to 40m spacing at the northern end of the ore body. 

Mineralisation continues to the north and resource development and grade control programs continue 

to drill and return results.  

14.2.2 G6 

The Golden Gift 6 resource model covers the area from 289N to 310N below -1450mRL. The GG6 

drilling indicates similar geology and geometry to the rest of the Golden Gift ore bodies at the Stawell 

Gold Mine. The basalt contact lode in GG6 is bound by the Low and Gamay Faults and is cut by the 

Bastardo, Rondinella and Concord Faults. A high grade Waterloo is modelled along with a lower grade 

Stockworks zone on the mineschist contact (Stockworks zone is absent below the Concord Fault). 

At the time of modelling there were 210 diamond drillholes intersecting the GG6 target area.  

Approximately 112 diamond holes were drilled into the GG6 area during 2011.  Drilling in 2011 has 

closed the drill spacing within the Bastardo, Rondinella and Concord blocks to a nominal 20m x 20m 

spacing, while the Gamay Block is currently drilled on a 30m x 30m spacing The current interpretation 

shows no major changes from the previous model. 

Initial exploration drilling of GG6 indicated that the geometry and tenor of mineralisation was similar to 

other areas in the Golden Gift which all contain approximately 100,000oz. Extensive drilling of the GG6 

ore body in 2011 has allowed more than 95% of the ounces in the updated model to be categorized as 

Indicated.  

14.2.3 G6 Lower 

The Golden Gift 6 Lower (GG6L) resource model covers an area from 288N to 302N (45o Mine Grid) 

below the -1600mRL. The GG6L drilling indicates similar geology and geometry to the rest of the 

Golden Gift ore bodies at the SGM. The Basalt Contact Lode in GG6L is bounded by the Gamay and 

Trollinger Faults and is cut by the Carnelian, Fortana, Madrasa and Ramisco Faults. Resource modelling 

and resource estimations have been defined for two areas; the Contact Volcanogenics Zone and an 

adjacent low grade volcanogenic zone. These zones are located between the basalt and the mineschist. 

At the time of modelling there were 44 diamond drillholes intersecting the GG6L target area on a 

nominal 50m x 50m intercept grid, drilled during 2010-2011. A total of five blocks have been modelled, 

all with contact lodes and low grade volcanogenics. Due to the relatively small offset (less than 10m) 

along the Gamay Fault, the uppermost GG6L block (Carnelian) could easily be added to the GG6 mining 



 

119 

 

area. A larger offset has been interpreted between the Fortana and Madrasa Blocks (more than 15m 

offset) with only minimal offset between the remaining 4 lower blocks. 

The GG6L area was first drilled in 2008 and changes in the recent model have been small with only 3 

additional drillholes.  Resource classification in the GG6L is difficult due to the discontinuous nature of 

the mineralisation and high degree of faulting. Faulting is likely increased due the proximity to the 

Wildcat Porphyry structure which has an estimated off set of 1 to 2km. Fault blocks containing ore zones 

can be from 5 to 25m in height. For these reasons GG6L is classified only as Inferred resource.   

In regards to future infill drilling, due to the ore blocks of GG6L being regularly offset by post-

mineralisation faulting, high grade variations seen in the drill results, and narrow ore geometries, closer 

spaced drilling will be required for Resource to Reserve conversion. It is anticipate a 10m x 10m drill 

spacing will be required to improve confidence to greater than the Inferred category. 

14.2.4 Federal Albion 

The Mid Magdala resource model covers the area from 255N to 295N, and is bounded by the surface or 

Scotchman's Fault at the top and the South Fault at depth. The geology of the area is generally well 

recognised as mining activity within the area has been occurring for over 100 years. 

At the time of modelling there were thousands of surface and underground diamond drillholes 

intersecting the ore body at varying intercept spacings. The model consists of 5 'ore lodes' – four basalt 

noses (or "waterloos"), the Central Lode, and a separated 'Stockwork' Lode. Weakly mineralised 

volcanogenic material is also modelled. 

Given the long mining history of the Magdala ore body a full 'depletion' model does not exist, however 

many of the mined voids are modelled. As such, reporting from the model was limited to areas that were 

known to still be intact and totally unmined and as such additional resources could be identified pending 

accurate void modelling exercises. 

Once the defined resource areas had been determined, cut-off grade analysis was completed on each 

area to determine the reported resource estimate. 

During the 2011 period an additional 21 drillholes were drilled into the Federal Albion area. This was a 

combination of grade control and resource definition drilling with Inferred blocks taken straight to grade 

control status. 

14.2.5 Mariners 

The underground Mariners area represents the down-dip extension/fault off-set of the surface Mariners 

target which was modelled as part of the Big Hill model in 1998 and 2007. The target has been drilled 

over several surface and underground campaigns dating back to 1986 but this is the first resource model 

covering the area. The Mariners underground area is situated between the Scotchman's and Scotchman's 

Splay Faults and the structure has only been intersected by underground diamond drillholes.  

This current interpretation and resource estimate follows on from the drilling campaign carried out in 

Q3 2009. At the time of modelling there were 26 diamond drillholes that have been coded as part of the 

geological modelling process. These drillholes are mostly on a resource definition spacing of 35m along 

strike and 35m up- and down-dip. There are only two mineralised structures identified from the drilling. 

The main quartz-sulphide rich shear of Mariners Lode, which strikes towards 325˚ and dips to the west 



 

120 

 

at 75˚. A secondary splay structure in the footwall of the Mariners Lode also hosts some minor 

mineralisation and has a strike of 325˚ and dip to the west at 25˚. Due to this being the first resource 

estimate of the area new variography was calculated and used for these structures. 

14.2.6 Wonga South 

The Wonga gold deposit was modelled in its entirety for the first time in May 2008 (as per SGM Wonga 

Resource Report December 2008); incorporating geological information compiled from the open pit and 

from underground mine workings.  

The Wonga deposit is a fracture controlled turbidite hosted gold deposit located on the southern margin 

of the Stawell Goldfield within the metamorphic aureole of the Stawell Granite. The ore body is bound 

to the north by a moderate angle thrust fault (South Fault) which juxtaposes the Wonga style of 

mineralisation with the historically higher grade Magdala type mineralisation that characterises the 

remaining Stawell Goldfield. To the south, the Wonga Reef is bound by the Wildcat Fault (now occupied 

by a quartz-feldspar porphyry dyke) and by the Stawell Granite. 

Early mining of the Wonga Reef, between 1868 and 1891, is estimated to have had a total production of 

478,000 tonnes at an average grade of 4.9 g Au/t for 75,000 ounces of gold. 

Modern mining of the Wonga reef commenced in 1984 when Western Mining Corporation (WMC) 

proved up sufficient ore reserves to justify a proposal for a small open cut operation. Production from 

the pit was 595,000 tonnes at a head grade of 3.2 g Au/t for 62,000 ounces of gold. A further 340,000 

tonne low grade stockpile averaging 1.2 g Au/t was processed separately several years later by MPI Mines 

Pty Ltd. 

The Wonga Decline was commissioned in January 1986 based on a pre-mined proved and probable 

reserve of 897,000 tonnes at a grade of 4.3 g Au/t for 120,000 ounces of gold (1.0 g Au/t cut-off). 

Underground mining activity ceased in 1999, however in mid 2001 two stope panels on the 154 Level 

were fired and treated through the Magdala processing facility. Shortly after this mining a decision was 

made to stop mining on the deposit and to switch off pumps causing the underground workings to flood. 

Surface diamond drilling was completed late 2008 with a subsequent resource model update (May 2009). 

Further drilling is underway at the time of reporting to better define mineralisation and depletion models 

in both the pit and underground areas. Further work is also being undertaken on modelling historical 

mining shapes and voids with poor records presenting sensitivity to the resource and project feasibility. 

14.2.7 Wonga North 

In October 2010 the Wonga South 2009 model was reviewed and the area north of the EW Fault, was 

separated out into a new model. This area is comprised of the 601 and 801 geological domains and was 

subsequently reviewed for open pit opportunities.  

An open pit reserve was determined for a northern cut back (Stage 1) to the original open pit shell and 

further drilling into the area was conducted in 2009 and 2010 with mining commencing early 2011. 

Completion of Stage 1 occurred in December 2011.  

Further drilling was conducted in early and late 2011 with a subsequent resource model update planned 

for early 2012 (as per SGM Wonga North Resource Report April, 2012). Further work is also being 



 

121 

 

undertaken on modelling historical mining shapes and voids with poor records presenting sensitivity to 

the resource and project.

14.2.8 Stope Reconciliation 

This section of the document summarises the methodologies used to estimate the Mineral Resources 

and Mineral Reserves and provide a summary of the key assumptions and results for each Mineral 

Resource/Mineral Reserve Area. 

The methodologies used at SGM are supported by a significant period of mining and reconciliation 

information (Figure 14-2). A summary of the results of stope reconciliations since 2003 are included 

below in Figure 14-2.

14.3 Manual 2D Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimation 

Methodologies 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves calculated using manual 2D methodologies are confined to 

sections of the upper levels at the Magdala deposit and to remaining mineral resources for the 

underground portion of the Wonga deposit.  

A detailed breakdown of the quantity of the April 2012 Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates 

completed using this methodology is presented below. 

Prior to 1996, manual 2D methodologies were the primary estimation tool for all Mineral Resources and 

Mineral Reserves estimated for the Stawell deposit. Progressively 3D block modelling methodologies 

were introduced and the remaining areas estimated using the 2D methods are remnant parcels for which 

detailed 3D models have not yet been created. There is an expectation that prior to mining of these 

areas additional geological information will be collected and processed to produce 3D block models upon 

which final economic evaluation and mine design will be completed.

The validity of estimation methodology is supported by many years of mining experience at SGM where 

with the addition of appropriate dilution and grade cutting have produced reliable estimates of tonnes 

grade and contained metal. 

The Mineral Resource estimation methodology is based on compiled 1:500 scale longitudinal projections 

for individual mineralised structures showing the locations of all diamond drillholes or sample 

intersections.  

 Each mineralised intercept is firstly interpreted on cross section and/or level plan or in 3D to 

determine the true width of the mineralised structure and to ensure the intercept is plotted on 

the longitudinal projection for the appropriate structure. 

 Individual assays within the mineralised structure are top cut to 17.0 g/t Au for Magdala and 15.0 

g/t Au for Wonga mineralisation respectively. The assays are accumulated by length weighting of 

the individual assay grades. 

 Magdala mineralisation is diluted to a minimum width of 3.0m by adding dilution at 1.0g/t Au 

 Additional interpretation is completed to confirm the strike and dip of the mineralised structure 

being modelled to calculate a Strike/Dip correction factor to be applied to the individual polygon 

being estimated. 

 Polygon areas are measured for each block to be estimated. 

 The tonnage is calculated by multiplying Area x Mean Width x SG x Strike/Dip Factor. 

 The grade assigned to the block is estimated based on the diluted length weighted intersections 

deemed to be informing each polygon. 

14.4 Computer 3D Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimation 

Methodologies 

Post 1997, 3D block modelling methodologies have progressively become the standard method for 

estimating Mineral Resources and have provided the basis for detailed mine design and the estimation of 

Mineral Reserves. 

This work is carried out in the MineSight software suite which is an industry standard geology and mine 

planning software package. Detailed Mineral Resource documents for each individual Mineral Resource 

area are included in Section 14.2. The description below describes the general process that is common 

to each model. 

14.4.1 Geological Modelling 

Geological modelling is carried out on individual resource areas by the geological team at SGM. The data 

available for this varies depending upon the stage of the development and understanding of the deposit 

area. The general process is as follows; 

 Wireframe models of major geological units are interpreted and created using MineSight 

software. 

 Less advanced deposit areas are first interpreted on paper while more advanced deposits are 

often interpreted directly within the software. 

 All available geological information is utilised in the interpretation process. 



 

125 

 

o Diamond drill core logs, core photographs, face mapping and photographs, and sludge 
drilling geology logging. 

o The drillhole logging information available to the mine geologists includes; 

 Lithology 

 Alteration 

 Quartz veining percentage and veining style 

 Sulphide percentages, type and style 

 Location and orientation of lithological contacts, shears and fault structures 

 Core texture – indicating faulting, shearing etc 

 Core photographs 

 Geological modelling is an ongoing process and models are progressively updated to reflect the 

most up to date information. Model updates are generally made upon completion of infill drilling 

programs and completion of development levels, where this information results in a material 

change in the amount and quality of data involved and/or material changes in geological 

understanding.  

The gross geological architecture of the mineralisation systems is well understood and described in detail 

in Section 7 and 8 of this report. Mineralisation is hosted by relatively distinctive and predictable 

geological units that are modeled by the area geologists. The key units that are modeled in each area are; 

 Magdala Basalt – unmineralised. Geometry of the basalt is required to estimate the quantity of 

dilution that will be incorporated into the mine designs. 

 Mine Schist – unmineralised. Also important for estimating the quantity of dilution that will be 

incorporated into the mine designs. 

 Weakly mineralised volcanogenic – important to estimate dilution in the mine designs. 

 Mineralised domains. For individual model areas these may be either in the Central Lode 

position, Basalt Contact positions and contain zones of stockwork mineralisation. 

 Key fault structures are modelled as they can have a significant impact on the shape of the 

mineralised domains (particularly in Golden Gift). 

 Wireframes are where possible snapped to drillhole intervals. 

The key control on mineral resource estimation is accurate definition of the constraining geological 

models. Estimation of grade within the domains, whilst still very important, is of secondary importance to 

the first order geological domaining. 

14.4.2 Summary of Geological Modelling by Area 

C7/D1 

The four mineralised zones of D1 all exhibit visually distinctive mineralisation styles. The Central Lode 

presents as a strongly sheared volcanogenic zone with high quartz content and the quartz frequently 

containing arsenopyrite-filled stylolites. Silica alteration is prevalent, as is moderate to strong sulphide 

mineralisation (predominantly sheared pyrrhotite and cubic pyrite).  

The Dukes Lode is a dark volcanogenic unit and exhibits strong chlorite alteration ± silica alteration 

adjacent to the basalt contact. In areas of high gold content, strong sulphide mineralisation is present in 

the form of massive pyrrhotite and pyrite. Strong shearing is also prevalent in the higher grade areas. 



 

126 

 

In contrast to the two ore lodes, the Dukes Internal Volcanogenic lode presents as a strongly carbonate 

altered unit ± intermittent silica alteration. Sulphide mineralisation (cubic pyrite and primary pyrrhotite) 

is generally weak with sporadic higher grade zones showing poor continuity along strike and up- and 

down-dip. 

The Stockworks Lode was interpreted as a new domain that sits between the Dukes Lode and the 

Central Lodes from what were the Dukes Lode and the Dukes Internal Volcanogenic Lode. It covers the 

area 2530mN (70° Grid) to 2760mN. In the August 2011 model update it was found that there was 

enough continuity and grade to domain out a new lode. The new Stockworks Lode shares a similar 

mineralisation style to the Dukes Internal Volcanogenic Lode; however, it has frequent quartz stockwork 

veins erratically distributed throughout the zone.

dip. 

The Stockworks Lode was interpreted as a new domain that sits between the Dukes Lode and the 

Central Lodes from what was the Dukes Lode and the Dukes Internal Volcanogenic Lode. It covers the 

area 2530mN (70° Grid) to 2760mN. In the August 2011 model update it was found that there was 

enough continuity and grade to domain out a new lode. The new Stockworks Lode shares a similar 

mineralisation style to the Dukes Internal Volcanogenic Lode, however, it has frequent quartz stockwork 

veins erratically distributed throughout the zone.  

G6L 

The mineralised zones of GG6L have been divided into five separate fault blocks; the Carnelian Block, the 

Fortana Block, the Madrassa Block, the Ramisco Block and the Trollinger Block. As with naming protocol 

for the rest of the mine, each mineralised block is named after its basal fault.  

The Carnelian Block is the uppermost block in GG6L with an offset between the upper Gamay Fault 

ranging from less than 1.0m at its northern end to approximately 10m at its southern end. In contrast to 

the May 2011 resource model where the Carnelian Block only consisted of an Inferred resource, the 

December 2011 resource model has segmented the Carnelian Block into both Indicated (45o Mine Grid: 

300N to 301.5N) and Inferred (300.5N to 296.5N) areas. Drill spacing within the indicated area is less 

than 30m and within the inferred area is in the order of 50m x 50m. Two mineralised domains have been 

differentiated; the Carnelian Contact Volcanogenics – domain 510 and the Carnelian Low Grade – 

domain 550. 



 

127 

 

As there is minimal offset between the bottom four GG6L blocks (Fortana Block, Madrassa Block, 

Ramisco Block and Trollinger Block), for the purpose of grade estimation these blocks have been 

combined into the one ore domain. The combined blocks have been drilled to an inferred status from 

293N to 301N based on nominal 50m x 50m drill spacing. Two combined mineralised domains have been 

differentiated; the Basalt Contact Mineralisation – Domain 110 and the Low Grade – Domain 150. 

Basalt Contact mineralisation (domains 510 and 110) carries much higher grade likely due to the position 

of the Fe-enriched basalt contact which focussed infiltration of gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids 

containing higher amounts of sulphide minerals causing stronger hydrothermal alteration. The alteration 

is typified by coarse arsenopyrite up to 20mm in size along with recrystallised pyrrhotite and minor 

pyrite. Visible gold is also common within the Basalt Contact mineralisation. Large quartz tension veining 

up to 750mm wide is often associated with coarse arsenopyrite and other sulphides that form along 

stylolites and is a common feature of the Basalt Contact mineralisation. In the immediate contact zone 

with the basalt it was common to see silicification of the host rock and bands up to 4m wide of 

mineralised siliceous sediment.  

A zone of lower grade volcanogenic rocks separates the basalt contact and the mineschist (domains 550 

and 150). This low grade zone is presumably a result of less hydrothermal fluid infiltration and less 

favourable host rock chemistry conducive to gold mineralisation. The weak volcanogenic rock has been 

logged as chloritic pelite or pelite to distinguish it from the mineralised zone and the unmineralised 

mineschist. Gold grade can still increase within the mineschist due to a separate stockwork zone, 

characterised by complexly deformed quartz veins, recrystallised pyrrhotite, and intense shearing. 

Federal Albion 

The mineralised zones of Mid Magdala all exhibit visually distinctive mineralisation styles. 

The Central Lode (Domain 100) presents as a strongly sheared volcanogenic unit with high quartz 

content frequently contains arsenopyrite-filled stylolites. Silica alteration is prevalent, as is moderate to 

strong sulphide mineralisation (predominantly sheared pyrrhotite and cubic pyrite).  

The Extended Lode (Domain 300) is a Basalt Contact mineralisation typified by coarse arsenopyrite up to 

20mm in size along with recrystallised pyrrhotite and minor pyrite. Large quartz tension veining up to 

750mm wide is often associated with coarse arsenopyrite and other sulphides that form along stylolites 

and is a common feature of the Basalt Contact mineralisation. In the immediate contact zone with the 

basalt it was common to see silicification of the host rock and bands up to 4m wide of mineralised 

siliceous sediment. Assay values are weaker in these zones by comparison due to the lack of chlorite. 

A hangingwall weak volcanogenic unit (Domain 710) is found on the contact zone of the mineschist and 

the Central Lode, which is less chloritic, has higher graphitic alteration than the host rock, and shows a 

moderate S2 or S3 fabric more typical of mineschist. This domain consists of recrystallised pyrrhotite and 

sedimentary pyrrhotite found around weak to moderate chlorite altered host rock. Quartz shear zones 

consisting of puggy graphite and weak chlorite alteration are also present. The hangingwall weak 

volcanogenic unit was often geologically logged as pelite to distinguish it from the mineralised zone and 

the minechist proper. A footwall weak volcanogenic unit (Domain 720) separates the Central Lode 

mineralisation from the Extended Lode.  



 

128 

 

A porphyry solid was modelled during the December 2011 model update. This porphyry runs oblique to 

the Central Lode from 5220N to 2730N and stopes out an area of the Central Lode in the area of 

updated drilling. This porphyry is post mineralisation and does not host any gold mineralisation.  

Mariners 

The mineralised zones of the Mariners area can be divided into two distinct mineralised lodes, Mariners 

Lode and Mariners Splay. Both lodes strike generally towards 325˚ but have varying dips towards the 

SW. 

The Mariners Lode shear zone differs from the typical Central Lode structure due to having diffuse 

boundaries on both the hangingwall and footwall of the structure. This is thought to be due to the 

absence of a strongly developed volcanogenic package above the Magdala Basalt, which acts to localise 

the fluid flow along the mineschist/volcanogenics boundary. The Mariners Lode structure is generally 

identified as a quartz-sulphide rich shear zone and has been modelled using elevated quartz-sulphide 

percentage as a guide but has also been driven by grade boundaries.  

Due to the absence of a strong volcanogenic package to localise fluid flow, the Mariner Lode is generally 

a broad, diffuse structure around 6m wide. The mineralisation distribution within the structure is variable 

across the structure and from drillhole to drillhole by being hangingwall dominant to footwall dominant. 

Due to this, the Mariners structure has been modelled using a bulk-mining scenario with no selective 

domaining undertaken at this stage. The Mariners Lode structure has a general strike towards 325˚ and 

dips to the west at approximately 75˚. 

The Mariners Splay structure is a low angled structure which propagates from footwall of the Mariners 

Lode. This structure varies in thickness, being thickest closer to the Mariners Lode and becoming thinner 

away from the lode. The structure is also dominated by a quartz-sulphide rich shear but was not always 

obvious in the initial drilling. In these cases, the structure was first highlighted via anomalous grade then 

on further investigation slight elevations in quartz or sulphides could be seen. This structure has only 

been intersected by nine diamond drillholes with anomalous grade present in seven. The Mariners Splay 

structure has a general strike towards 325˚ and dips to the west at around 25˚. 

Wonga North and South 

Mineralisation is controlled by two main fault systems referred to as the Hangingwall Lode and the 

Footwall Link structures.  

The Hangingwall Lode strikes north-south and dips between 25˚ and 40˚ towards the east. Better widths 

and grades on this surface tend to occur midway between adjacent porphyry dykes where the dip of the 

lode flattens and dilates to form a sigmoidal shape when viewed in cross-section (Figure 14-3). The 

further the distance of the Hangingwall Lode from the Stawell Granite (mineralising fluid source) illicits 

patchier and lower grade mineralisation within the Lode.  

Grade control drilling in 2010 and 2011 identified a Hangingwall Splay (Domain 801). This splay strikes 

320˚ and dips between 15˚ and 30˚ towards the east. Mineralisation in this lode is low grade and patchy 

and is associated within the porphyry contacts. Other than the small Hangingwall Splay (Domain 603) 

modelled in the 2008 Wonga resource model, this is the only other identified hangingwall lode. Typically 

structures are located on the footwall to the main Hangingwall Lodes (Domains 601 and 602). 



 

129 

 

 

Figure 14-3 Cross section (895980N) view looking north showing Hangingwall Lode (green) forming 

a sigmoid between two bounding porphyry dykes (blue). 

The Footwall Link structure is highly variable in dip and strike compared to the Hangingwall Lode. The 

strike of the Footwall Link structure varies from 000 to 085 degrees with dips ranging from 20 to 50 

degrees towards the east/southeast. As a general rule, when the strike of the link structure is less than 

25 degrees from the strike of the Hangingwall Lode, the dip of the mineralised structure is shallow 

(commonly within the 20 to 30 degree range). Conversely, when the angular difference in strike to the 

Hangingwall Lode is greater than 25 degrees, the link structure dips at steeper angles approaching 50 

degrees.  

This variable nature in the strike and dip of the footwall structure has resulted in the formation of 

extremely high grade and wide ore shoots where the footwall structure comes in contact with the 

steeper dipping Hangingwall Lode (Figure 14-4).  



 

130 

 

 

Figure 14-4 Plan View of Wonga 132L showing broad high grade shoot developing at the intersection 

of the hangingwall and footwall lodes. 

 

The mineralogy of the Wonga deposit is dominated by quartz with less abundant but still significant K-

feldspar, andalusite, cordierite, and biotite with occasional plagioclase, amphibole, and garnet. 

Three main stages of alteration have been identified in the Wonga schist: 

1. Early biotite alteration, especially in the host rock adjacent to quartz veins. This alteration 

appears to be the product of prograde metamorphism.  

2. Muscovite overprinting of biotite.  

3. Late stage moderately intense and pervasive seritisation accompanied by silicification. In this 

event andalusite, cordierite, biotite, and garnet are partially altered to sericite. 



 

131 

 

 

Quartz is the dominant vein material with veins commonly containing minor quantities of sulphides, 

biotite, feldspar, muscovite, sericite, and altered amphibole. The abundance of quartz veins and presence 

of patchy quartz inter-grown with sericite suggest that silicification and seritisation of the host rock 

occurred simultaneously with veining.  

The Wonga sulphide mineralisation is dominated by arsenical iron minerals arsenopyrite and loellingite. 

These minerals are closely associated and form disseminations of acicular needles of up to 5mm length. 

Internally the crystals comprise an irregular loellingite core surrounded by a rim of arsenopyrite of 

various thicknesses.  

The arsenopyrite-loellingite grains are found both in the host rock and in some quartz veins and often 

appear in greatest concentration along the quartz vein boundaries. 

Other sulphide minerals including pyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, and galena occur in minor 

to trace quantities. Of these, pyrite, commonly containing traces of marcasite, is most abundant. 

Petrographic analysis suggests that pyrite may be replacive after pyrrhotite due to the irregular patchy 

nature of pyrite, lack of euhedral outlines and presence of marcasite intergrowths (Ringenbergs, 1988). 

Gold occurs as small (<10 micron) inclusions in the arsenopyrite-loellingite grains. Most of the gold in 

this association occurs at the contact of the arsenopyrite and loellingite. This suggests the gold was 

precipitated along the arsenopyrite–loellingite reaction front. Rare gold can also occur in arsenopyrite 

alone, and in loellingite particularly in association with inclusions of chalcopyrite (Ringenbergs, 1988). 

From field observation and petrographic studies, gold emplacement is introduced via the quartz vein 

fracture network of the Hangingwall and Footwall Lodes. Gold tends not to precipitate in the quartz of 

the vein itself but where the following suitable conditions are encountered: 

1. The arsenopyrite–loellingite replacement front 

2. Areas of quartz–sericite alteration, and 

3. Cleavage intersections in porphyroblastic andalusite 

14.4.3 Block Modelling 

The process of block modelling at SGM is relatively standard across all model areas and is drawn from 

the details for the individual model areas. 

Stawell Gold Mines has retained the services of several key consulting groups over time to ensure 

mineral resource estimation processes have been maintained to a high standard. Quantitative 

Geosciences (QG) have provided ongoing coaching, training, mentoring, and mineral resource estimation 

services on an as required basis since the late 1990's. This has ensured consistency of process over this 

time as key site personnel have changed and supported by the Qualified Person.  

Block Model Dimensions 

Block model dimensions vary on an area by area basis as indicated in Table 14-2. All block models other 

than the Magdala Surface and Wonga Surface models are rotated to align with the strike and dip of the 

area being modelled.  Alignment of the surface models into the plane of the structure is not completed as 



 

132 

 

current mine planning software is not readily able to use the models and subsequent mine planning is 

impeded. 

Block model dimensions are varied based upon the density of the available drilling data and also on the 

overall geometry of the mineralised structures.

Block models are coded with the key structural/mineralisation domains. This process is completed using 

the MineSight software. The details of the coding also vary by Mineral Resource area and are determined 

based on the number and geometry of the mineralisation domains. Given the block sizes utilised by SGM 

relative to the individual structures, multiple domain codes and percentages are stored in each block. 

Drillhole Coding 

A diamond drillhole set is coded with the key structural/mineralisation domains. Importantly this coding 

is checked manually by the area geologists to ensure that they match the wireframes created. Where 

required some manual adjustment is made and if suspect drillhole locations are noted these drillholes 

may be excluded from the estimate. These details are included in the documentation for each Mineral 

Resource area 

Compositing 

The drillhole files are composited downhole to fixed length composite intervals. The composites are 

matched to honour the geological domains as coded in the drillhole files. 

Composite intervals appear in Table 14-2. The choice of composite intervals is made on a model by 

model basis that will best reflect the block size, data available and geometry of domains.  

Geostatistical Parameters 

For all of the Mineral Resource areas that have been modelled in 3D, gold grades (Au ppm) have been 

estimated by ordinary kriging. Over time this methodology, when coupled with detailed and robust 

geological models, provided reliable estimates of in situ gold grade.  

The key geostatistical parameters are modelled for each project separately (Table 14-3). Variography 

studies are completed using either ISATIS software or MineSight software. Individual variogram studies 

are conducted for each domain and modelled separately (Table 14-4). 

Key variogram parameters, nugget and sill, and variogram ranges are modelled on either normal 

variograms or Gaussian transformed data. Whilst the estimated values for the nugget and ranges vary for 

each modelled area they are generally relatively consistent. 

The variograms studies have been performed to optimise the kriging neighbourhood as per the 

methodologies presented in Vann et al (2003). This enables quantitative evaluation of the results of the 

kriging to be performed and, as well as enabling the search neighbourhoods to be optimised, provides 

numerical outputs from the kriging runs (Slope of Regression of the Estimate). The Slope of Regression is 

used in part to aid in classification of the Mineral Resource estimates as per the definitions contained 

within NI 43-101.

14.5 Density 

As per the SGM core-processing flowchart (Figure 10-1) all whole core sample intervals that 

are sent for assay are bagged and weighed prior to leaving site. The weights of the core are 

stored in the drillhole database and an apparent dry bulk density for each interval is 

calculated based upon a theoretical volume for the specific core diameter for each sample 

interval.  

Whilst there are potential limitations in this process given that the volume for each core is 

based upon the theoretical drill core diameter and the measured length of each interval, it 

can be demonstrated by reconciliation of stope volumes as surveyed by cavity monitoring 

systems and tonnage measured by trucked ore that the estimated density applied to specific 

areas is a reliable estimator of in situ density. Historical reconciliation supports the density 

values that are currently being used in the estimates at SGM. 

This apparent density measurement includes some residual moisture which by measurement 

has been estimated at approximately 2% or less and is generally not accounted for in the 

estimates. 

Table 14-5 and Table 14-6 show the density values that have been applied by Mineral 

Resource area. Specific details of the data and analysis and assumptions used to derive these 

values are given in each of the area specific reports.

14.6 Resource Classification 

The classification of Indicated and Inferred material is based on geological confidence, Slope 

of Regression analysis and model validation results. The practice adopted at SGM uses 

general guidelines for classification that utilise the following information; 

 Drilling density 

 Stage of development; ore development and final data gathering in place 

 Demonstrated geological continuity of structures and mineralised domains 

 Slope of Regression of the Estimate analysis (calculated value during the Kriging 

Process) 

Ore classification as applied to the Mineral Resources disclosed in this document have been 

reviewed in detail on an area by area basis and are considered to be appropriate and within 

the guidelines. 

14.7 External Factors Effecting Extraction of Mineral 

Resources and Reserves 

14.7.1 Magdala Surface Mineral Resources 

The Magdala Surface Mineral Resources are located within a segment of Crown Land called 

the Big Hill Ridge which defines the up-dip portion of the Magdala mineralised system. This 

area is bordered by residential areas on two sides. An extensive RC and Diamond drilling 



 

140 

 

program was completed during 1997 and 1998 to define the extent of the mineralised 

system and define the Mineral Resource.  

A feasibility study to establish an open pit mining operation on this section of the deposit 

was completed and a detailed Environmental Effects Statement (EES) prepared. The EES was 

submitted to the Victorian State Government in 1999 seeking approval to commence a 

mining operation within the Big Hill area. In November 2000 the proposal was rejected by 

the Minister for Planning and the project was not able to proceed.  

Stawell Gold Mines believes there is strong potential to re-examine the project and the 

methodologies that were proposed at the time and thus exploit portions of the Mineral 

Resource as defined and reported in this document. 

Further open pit optimisation studies have been completed and a smaller open pit designed 

as an extension of the existing Davis open pit. Stawell Gold Mines management has received 

advice that this proposal could be completed by applying to the Victorian State Government 

for a variation to the existing Work Plan and a planning permit from the local Grampians 

Shire Council. As such a small open pit Mineral Reserve has been defined and reported as 

part of the Mineral Reserve estimate.  

From 2007 to the present the waste dump created from the initial mining of the Davis open 

pit was progressively reclaimed and treated through the SGM processing facility. As such 

there is precedent for mining operations in this area. 

In addition, some studies have been completed looking at the potential to extract portions 

of the Mineral Resource by underground mining methods. At the time these studies were 

completed (2001 – 2002) the economic scenarios were not favourable. A significant change 

in the gold price since then has not been factored into this analysis and further reviews are 

planned. 

Whilst there are currently permitting, environmental, and political constraints preventing 

mining this portion of the mineral resource estimate there are potentially significant 

economic benefit to the SGM operation if this resource could be exploited by some form of 

mining activity. Stawell Gold Mines will continue evaluation of potential extraction 

methodologies. 

14.7.2 Wonga Surface Mineral Resource 

The Wonga Surface Mineral Resources are based upon an open pit optimisation study 

completed in 2011 (Hamilton, 2011). The resulting optimisation shells at a gold price of 

AUD$1500 create an extension to the existing partially filled Wonga open pit void.  

There are existing Mining Licence approvals and conditions that permit open pit mining in 

this area. Stawell Gold Mines management has advice that a Work Plan variation would need 

to be obtained prior to the commencement of any mining activity in the Wonga area. Stawell 

Gold Mines received a Work Plan variation enabling mining and trucking of portions of the 

Wonga waste dump to the processing plant for milling. These trials were carried out during 

2008 to determine the potential processing grades and viability of treating this material 

through the Stawell processing facility.   The 2008 treatment trial saw 8,195t of Mt. Mickey 



 

141 

 

material milled at a grade of 0.89g/t and at 87.0% recovery.   To date (end of April 2012), 

47,241t of Mt Mickey ore has been treated at 0.73g/t and 85.6% recovery.  A work plan was 

also granted for a small cutback to the northern wall that was mined and completed in the 

2011 period. 

14.7.3 Wonga Underground Mineral Resources 

The Wonga underground mine, was placed on care and maintenance in 1999. After 

extraction of some of the remnant Mineral Reserves and Resources in subsequent years, 

mine dewatering was stopped and the mine was allowed to flood. The water level is 

currently 150mRL and the majority of the existing workings are underwater. 

Should economic conditions change such that the remaining Mineral Resource was 

economic, current licence conditions permit SGM to recommence operations and 

extraction of any remaining or newly defined Mineral Resources.  

14.7.4 Magdala Underground Mineral Resources 

Mining and extraction of the Magdala Mineral Resources and Reserves has been continuous 

since 1981. The authors are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, 

socio-economic, political or other issues that will prevent extraction of the remaining 

existing Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources. 

Stawell Gold Mines has been able to carry out its mining activities as defined by current 

Work Plans and approvals without intervention since 1981.

Notes: 

1. All Ore Reserves have been estimated in accordance with the JORC Code and have been reconciled to 

CIM Standards as prescribed by National Instrument 43-101. 

2. Mineral Resources are exclusive of Mineral Reserves. 

3. Mineral Reserves were estimated using the following economic parameters:  

a. Cut-off grade applied was variable for underground depending upon width, mining method 

and ground conditions. 

b. Individual stoping areas were subjected to an economic analysis prior to inclusion in the 

reserve. 

4. Wonga surface and Magdala surface above 130mRL and above a nominal 0.8g/t Au cut-off 

5. For the Mineral Reserves estimate, the Qualified Person is Neil Schunke. His details and qualifications 

can be seen in Section 28 of this report. 

6. Mineral Reserves are rounded to 1,000 tonnes, 0.01 g/t Au and 1,000 ounces. Minor discrepancies in 

summations may occur due to rounding. 

15.1 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

The following sections outline the process undertaken to produce Mineral Reserve 

estimates from the available Mineral Resource. This section contains descriptions of reserve 

design parameters, recovery and unplanned dilution factors and economic analysis. This 

section of the report has been reviewed by Neil Schunke who is the Qualified Person for the 

Mineral Reserve estimate (details in Section 28.2).  



 

143 

 

15.1.1 General Design Parameters 

 Level spacing up to 25 metre maximum for the ore bodies.  

 The stoping method for all areas is longhole stoping with stopes left open or filled 

depending on the mining and or geotechnical requirements. Filled stopes are backfilled 

with either cemented rock fill (CRF) or unconsolidated fill or combinations which also 

take into account the grade of any associated rib pillar necessitated by unconsolidated 

fill. 

 Rib pillar aspect ratio is not designed to be less than 1:1. 

 Minimum stoping width is deemed to be 3.0 metres. 

 Fill triangle pillars were assumed to allow for backfilling rill angle placement of 45 

degrees. 

 Mining dilution is area specific and can be either designed into the stope shape or 

allocated as a percentage of an undiluted design.  

 Strike dimension of individual stopes is nominally 18 – 21 metres for single-lift stopes 

and 15 metres for double-lift stopes. Initial dimensions may be altered in consultation 

with geotechnical personnel to account for structure, sequence or abnormal hangingwall 

conditions. 

 Where stopes are to be mined under CRF, a stope height of 12metres has been used to 

try and limit stope and pillar size and increase potential recovery.

North Magdala grades manually allocated 

 

All stopes and development have been allocated 100% recovery and development has been 

allocated 0% dilution (Bremner 2012). 

15.1.2 Financial Considerations 

 A high level cut off grade is conducted to see which areas of the mine could potentially 

be converted from resource to reserve. 

 Due to the remnant nature of the operation, the economic viability of the stoping 

regions was determined with a spreadsheet distilled from the approved site economic 

model. Marginal stopes were not used in determining the viability of the regions under 

consideration, but were included in the reserve if they paid the operating costs 

associated with their extraction, and were developed in the process of accessing fully-

funded stopes. Each region was assessed with full financial consideration  

 Capital costs in the site financial model draw capital depreciation and amortisation 

figures for vertical and horizontal development from the approved Life-of-Mine Plan. 



 

144 

 

 Only designs created on an Indicated or Measured Resource were considered for 

reserve classification. No Probable reserves have been derived from Measured Mineral 

Resources. 

 All Mineral Reserves are estimated by either manually assigning stope tonnes and grade 

to stope designs produced from 2-dimensional geological models or querying 3-

dimensional block models with 3-dimensional stoping design voids. The stope designs 

include internal and external dilution. The resulting in-situ reserve then has modifying 

factors for grade and tonnage applied to estimate the Mineral Reserve. 

 The below screen shots shows detail from the stope economics spreadsheet. Figure 

15-1 shows the first pass analysis based on a calculated cut off grade to cover basic 

costs. A more detailed analysis is then completed if a stope or stoping region passes the 

first analysis. The second pass analysis is more detailed analysis the specific stope or 

stoping region associated costs and revenue.

16 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Underground Mining Methods 

The Magdala mine is accessed by a decline from a portal located adjacent to the mill. The 

mine access development and services are located mainly within basalt. Ground conditions 

are good and there is no history of major seismic activity. Development follows the Magdala 

Lode system down plunge and between 470RL and 786RL the decline splits into a north and 

a south decline to access the Golden Gift ore bodies. To facilitate ore access, extraction 

levels are developed at approximately 20m to 25m vertical intervals. The mining areas 

currently extend over approximately 3km of strike to more than 1,500m below surface, 

measured from the top of Big Hill.  

The mining method used in the Magdala mine was bench stoping with cemented rock fill 

pillars in primary stopes, and rock filled secondary stopes. The mining method used in the 

Golden Gift and narrow Magdala ore zones is retreat open stoping with either cemented 

rock fill (CRF) if full extraction or combinations of CRF and rock fill or all rock fill stope with 

pillars. In the Magdala ore body, stope sizes typically range from 2,000 to 10,000 tonnes. In 

the Golden Gift area where the width and tenor of the reserves have so far been of higher 

quality, generally larger stopes up to 15,000 tonnes are expected. Stope ore is recovered 

using loaders under direct or remote control of an operator, with haulage by 60 tonne 

trucks. 

The access decline is used as an intake airway and a chilled water plant delivers conditioned 

air via an intake shaft. Local spot refrigeration plants are also used for decline advance. 

Exhaust air is drawn through the workings by a series of ventilation rises and drives by two 

primary ventilation fan installations located at the northern and southern ends of the mine. 

The mine is relatively dry. Water pumped from the workings is recycled for use in the mine 

or the treatment process. 

16.2 Open Pit Methods 

Open pit mining will utilize conventional benching techniques of drill and blast or free dig in 

the oxidized zones. Loose overburden will be removed with either a combination of ripping 

and scrapers or conventional truck and shovel/front end loader. The discrete nature of open 

pits will necessitate the use of small scale equipment. Ramp widths are kept to a minimum of 

one lane at 12m as the mining fleet will consist of few trucks. Ore delivery from satellite pits 

will be through the use of road registered truck and trailer combinations. These will 

transport ore to the mill during ordinary work hours.  A ramp gradient of 1:9 (with a final 

ramp section at 1:8) will be used and a berm interval of 20m vertical. Batter slope angles are 

typically 50 degrees in weathered material and reach 60 degrees in fresh rock. Batter slope 

angles are determined on a site by site basis using geotechnical advice from diamond drill and 

rock sampling data. Whittle modelling of the resource is used to determine the economic pit 

shape, with recovery factors of 95% and dilution factor of 10% typically used. Work shifts 

will be typically Monday to Friday during day light hours to minimize environmental impacts 

to the surrounding community.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Mineral Processing 

The gold processing facilities utilised at SGM comprise a standard Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) 

gold recovery circuit following crushing and grinding and sulphide flotation. The treatment 

plant consists of five unit processes. These are:  

 size reduction (crushing and milling) 

 gravity gold recovery 

 flotation/ultra fine grinding 

 leach-adsorption, and  

 gold recovery 

Geographically the plant can be split up into five main areas. These are: 

 the primary crushing circuit 

 the milling circuit 

 the flotation/ultra fine grinding circuit 

 the leach-adsorption circuit, and  

 the elution/electrowinning circuit 

A current processing flow sheet is shown in Figure 17-1. A history of tonnage and grade 

throughput for the processing facilities is shown in Section 6 of this report. 

Coarse gold (up to 30% of the gold in mill feed) is recovered from the milling circuit in self 

cleaning centrifugal gravity concentrators. Approximately 75% of the ore requires further 

liberation of the gold from sulphides and this is achieved in a two stage flotation circuit 

where gold bearing sulphides (pyrite, arsenopyrite and some pyrrhotite) are concentrated. 

The sulphide is ground to approximately 0.01 millimetres in an ultra fine grinding mill to 

liberate enclosed gold (up to 20% of the gold in mill feed). The ground sulphides and 

flotation tail are recombined and sent to the CIL circuit. 

Stawell ore exhibits various degrees of preg-robbing of gold. Preg-robbing occurs when 

naturally occurring carbon species (graphite) in the ore rob gold from the pregnant liquor in 

the leach circuit, thus reducing the gold recovery. To combat this, Kerosene is added to foul 

the naturally occurring carbon before it enters the leach circuit and a simple preg-rob index 

developed at SGM indicates the rate of addition needed for the kerosene to be most 

effective. 

An ongoing program of metallurgical test work is conducted at SGM. The program utilises 

diamond drill core to determine the expected plant recovery for all ore blocks at a stope 

scale within the immediate and long term mine plan. Samples of the ore and estimated 

dilution are tested to determine the expected preg-rob index and expected gold recovery 

through the SGM processing circuit. The results of the test work program provide an 

expected plant recovery on a campaign basis. Metallurgists are able to plot the actual versus 

predicted plant recoveries using the test work results so as to show the relationship 



 

147 

 

between actual plant recovery and expected plant recoveries for all float ore treated project 

to date. This validates the robustness of the metallurgical test work programs utilised by 

SGM and as such the robustness of the forecast metallurgical assumptions used in developing 

project schedules and financial forecasts.  

Total gold recovery for the calendar year averaged 84.72% and for the first quarter of 2012 

(January – March) has averaged 84.63%.

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 Surface Infrastructure 

Stawell Gold Mines facilities are extensive and representative of a modern gold mining 

operation (Figure 18-1). The main site location comprises; 

 Office and administration complex 

 Store and storage facilities 

 Heavy underground equipment workshop and Light vehicle workshop 

 Surface Run of Mine stockpiles 

 Gold Processing Plant and associated facilities 

 On Site Assay and Metallurgical test work Laboratory 

 Four freshwater storage dams to store rainfall run-off and mine dewatering 

which is used in the plant or around the mine site. 

 Power for the plant is fed from a main transformer located adjacent to the 

administration complex. 

 A batch plant for preparing shotcrete for underground support 

 Core farm and core processing facility 

Surface facilities include the gold processing plant, offices, core shed, laboratory and 

workshops. Larger infrastructure onsite includes tailings dams covering 96 ha and receiving 

all tailings from the processing plant. Four freshwater dams occur throughout the mine lease. 

18.2  Tailings Storage Facilities 

Since operations began in 1984, three tailings dams have been constructed and operated, 

two of which have since been decommissioned; 

 Reserve Tailings Dam. This has been decommissioned and rehabilitated to a Clay 

Target Shooting Complex 

 No 1 Tailings Dam. This has been decommissioned and partially rehabilitated 

 No 2 Tailings Dam remains in operational 

All dams were constructed as earthen embankments with upstream sub-aerial deposition 

and are subject to annual integrity and operational review by an independent industry 

expert.

18.3 Underground Mining Infrastructure 

Underground infrastructure within the Magdala mine is extensive and includes a 5.5m x 5.5m access 

decline extending from surface to around 1300mRL as at the end of December 2007. The gradient of the 

decline is 1:8 down to 468mRL then changes to 1:7 to 1300mRL. Two shafts, the Big Hill shaft (active 

intake) and Federal shaft (passive intake) supply fresh air to the mine. The exhaust system includes the 

Darlington shaft, which is the main exhaust. The Albion shaft, the Federal/Albion raisebore and the Ulster 

shaft work as 3 surface connections in parallel making up the output of the south vent system. 

Mine dewatering systems enable pumping to the surface although a significant proportion is recycled and 

utilised within the mine. 

An underground workshop and underground crib room is available at the 800mRL level within the mine. 

In addition to the fixed plant, SGM owns, operates and maintains all mobile mining equipment including 

Jumbo development drills, production drills, loaders, trucks, and ancillary equipment required to 

undertake mining operations. 

18.4 Power 

Stawell Gold Mines purchases power under contract from Origin Energy Australia. This 2 year contract 

expires in Dec 2012.  

Supply from the National Electricity Grid to SGM is via high voltage installations in two locations;  

 Moonlight Substation (10 Mega Watts feed) which supplies the Magdala Underground operation, 

and  

 Reefs Road (7 Mega Watts feed) that supplies the Gold Processing Plant, administration, 

workshop facilities and parts of the upper levels of the Magdala Underground Mine. 

Power to underground from the Moonlight substation is supplied through a 990m steel cased borehole 

and that from the Reefs Road substation via the Magdala decline.  

The total facilities for electrical power input distribution to site is 5 833 600 kwh/month 

The Main underground demands are outlined below, 

1. Primary ventilation fan sizes are 

 Surface 250kw 

 482L 1000kw 

 435L 1120kw 

2. Compressor sizes are  

 1300 cfm x 4(250kw x 4 units) 

 1000 cfm x 1(160kw x 1 unit underground) 

 650 cfm x 3(110kw x 3 units) 

Stawell Gold Mines management have provided information that the current power availability is 

sufficient to meet the needs of the current Life of Mine operating plan. 



 

152 

 

18.5 Water 

Water supply is from harvested rainfall runoff, mine dewatering, recycling of process water from the 

tailings facility, and by way of a 1ML/day raw water right entitlement and urban customer access to 

potable supply from Lake Bellfield located in the Grampians Mountains. The capacity of the site water 

storages is approximately 690ML. 

The Lake Bellfield water is supplied as raw or potable and is preferentially used, when required in the 

processing operations as it improves gold recovery. 

 



 

153 

 

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

Stawell Gold Mines produces gold doré bars at the SGM, which are transported to AGR Matthey in 

Western Australia and refined to produce gold bullion. The Corporation sells the gold bullion over the 

counter according to its treasury policy through either AGR Matthey or an Australian based bank.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND 

SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

Stawell Gold Mines is committed to maintaining effective management systems with respect to 

environmental matters at the SGM. At SGM, site management monitors and regularly reviews the 

environmental and social impacts of the operations, such as water quality, air quality, blast vibration and 

noise. Monitoring and site environmental performance results are shared with regulatory authorities and 

local communities and are reported quarterly to all stakeholders. Stawell Gold Mines promotes 

responsible environmental behaviour among all employees and contractors. Operations are managed in 

accordance with the SGM Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which provides the standards, 

procedures, and guidelines required to achieve that aim. 

20.1 Environmental Research 

Stawell Gold Mines has detected thiocyanate in some shallow monitoring bores around Tailings Dam 2. 

The groundwater in several areas is also elevated due to hydraulic pressure from the Tailings Dam. 

Stawell Gold Mines has undertaken multiple studies of the area and the impacts from the seepage (Coffey 

(2008), LanePiper (2008), Rockwater (2010), NQ Groundwater and Environment (2011), and NQ 

Groundwater and Environment (2012)). An Environmental Audit of groundwater (LanePiper, 2008) was 

completed for the entire site. The conclusions to the audit were that the primary impacts are in relation 

to salinisation of soil from elevated groundwater levels and cyanide compounds. 

In a review conducted by NQ Groundwater and Environment in 2012 during the installation of five new 

seepage bores it has been indicated that due to very high clay content and high weathering rates it was 

demonstrated that seepage mitigation from Tailings Dam 2 is very slow ranging from 0.0016m/day to 

0.067m/day. Increasing distance, dilution and absorption of cyanide to geological materials down gradient 

will slow migration. During mining operations, to manage elevated water levels and seepage from Tailings 

Dam 2, rock filled cut-off seepage trenches have been installed in several locations around the dam. A 

number of 50mm seepage interception bores have also been installed around Tailings Dam 2. In January 

2012 five 150mm seepage bores were installed and will be fitted out with solar powered water pumps 

during Q2 2012. 

It is expected that with capping and closure of Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) No. 2, the tailings will 

progressively dewater resulting in groundwater levels slowly re-establish to near pre-TSF levels. This is 

supported by the modelling works undertaken by O'Kane Consultants. Therefore the need for active 

groundwater level management is anticipated to decline once the operation of TSF No.2 ceases and 

closure is complete. 

20.2 Monitoring 

Monitoring of surface waters and groundwater on site and off site is undertaken to ensure compliance 

with the State Environmental Planning Policies (SEPP, Waters of Victoria), the SEPP (Groundwater), 

Work Plan conditions and the Mining Licence conditions of no off-site disposal. A report on monitoring 

data is presented to the Environment Review Committee (ERC) on a quarterly basis and an annual 

report is provided to the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) as a condition of the Mining Licence. 



 

155 

 

Dust monitoring stations are located at six strategic locations around the site. Monitoring is undertaken 

in accordance with the Environmental Procedure for Dust Deposition Gauges (ENV001). Sample stations 

are set up for a period of approximately one month every three months in accordance with the 

Australian Standard AS3580.10.1 (1991) clause 7.3. Monitoring of the afterburner inlet and outlet and the 

four ventilation stacks is undertaken on a biannual basis by an independent emissions consultant and 

analysis performed by a NATA certified laboratory. 

Noise control is an integral part of site design and a number of mitigation measures are in place to 

reduce the impact of noise on local residents. As described in MIN5260 General Licence Condition 8, 

the noise limits applicable for the SGM operations were derived from procedures outlined in the 

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) State Environment Protection Policy (Control of Noise from 

Commerce, Industry & Trade) No. N-1. All results of noise monitoring are recorded and maintained by 

SGM. These results are reported to regulatory authorities and the community at quarterly ERC 

meetings. Noise monitoring is undertaken on an 'as needed' basis by SGM and annually by a suitably 

qualified noise consultant. 

In addition to the noise emissions, blasting can also result in ground vibrations and air blast. The intensity 

of these effects varies with the size of the blast and its relative location. Similar to noise emissions, the 

impacts of excessive air blast and ground vibrations primarily affect the amenity of nearby residents, 

which can result in loss of community support. Every blast event is monitored for ground vibration using 

monitors located at sensitive sites. A portable vibration monitor can be utilised if the need arises. All 

results of the air blast and ground vibration monitoring are recorded and maintained by SGM. These 

results are reported quarterly at the ERC meetings and where statutory limits are exceeded the results 

are reported to the DPI. 

Flora and fauna surveys are conducted yearly by consultants in rehabilitated off set areas and the Tailings 

Experimental Research Facility (TERF) site. In 2012 consultants conducted flora and fauna surveys around 

the Davis and Davis North Extension area to complement work plans for those potential projects. 

20.3 Permitting 

There are no outstanding permitting requirements at this stage. There are number of proposed future 

projects currently undergoing feasibility studies which will require permitting documents to be developed 

if they proceed.  

20.4 Community Engagement 

Stawell Gold Mine is closely associated with the township of Stawell (to the south and east of the mine) 

and is bordered by farming land to the north and east, and State Forest to the west. The mine injects 

approximately $65 million dollars a year into the regional economy and therefore has many stakeholders 

connected directly or indirectly to the operation. The expectation by the local community is that the 

Company will continue to operate in accordance with its license conditions and modern community 

standards and the local community expects and appreciates being informed of changes to the operations. 

Stawell Gold Mines has taken a proactive approach to community relations and has endeavoured to keep 

the community up to date with all changes occurring at the mine site and within their community. 

Community attitudes and expectations have been identified through a range of techniques including: 



 

156 

 

 One on one discussions 

 Community surveys 

 Information sessions 

 Community meetings 

 Feedback from community representatives on the Environmental Review Committee 

 Annual Open Day 

 Feedback forms 

20.5 Rehabilitation Research/Activities 

The SGM is a reasonably small compact site and there are very few opportunities to conduct progressive 

rehabilitation whilst it is in operation. Several disused dams have been filled in and rehabilitated over the 

life of the mine along with other small areas around site (Figure 20-1 and Figure 20-2). Figure 20-1 below 

shows two small areas of opportunity that will not impact on present operations that can be investigated. 

In 2000 SGM established a Tailings Experimental Research Facility (TERF) on Tailings Dam 1 as a field 

trial to investigate different closure mechanisms for the tailings dams. The University of Melbourne and 

Curtin University have been undertaking research on this facility to determine the impacts of thin cover 

designs on a number of aspects including: 

 Acid Mine Drainage 

 Ecotoxicology 

 Soil stabilisation 

 Arsenic uptake, and 

 Phytostabilisation using trees 



 

157 

 

 

Figure 20-1 Tailings Dam 1 experimental site, (Dam 5), evaporation pond and rehabilitation 

opportunities. 

The Dam 3 area is located behind the current freshwater storage Dam 2 and was decommissioned in 

2007 with the walls pushed in and the area levelled off. The proposal now is to revegetate this area as an 

offset for tree removal elsewhere on the lease. Currently each time a tree is removed on site an offset 

management plan needs to be created and approved by the DSE. This normally requires planting out up

Figure 20-2 Rehabilitated Dam 3 

Both Dam 3 and the old evaporation pond have achieved reasonably good vegetation cover but will 

require some additional minor work to fill in a number of gaps. 

20.5.1 Doronila (2006) 

This study reported that vegetation could be successfully established on relatively shallow substrate 

covers upon sulphidic tailings. It was apparent that a shallow, geochemically open system which allowed 

the ingress of oxygen and water rather than preventing contact with the tailings through encapsulation 

with a thick impermeable layer (>1.0m) did not result in elevated acidity which is the major factor in 

arsenic and toxic metal mobility. 

20.5.2 O'Kane Consultants Pty Ltd (2009) 

To assist with the outcomes of the Doronila study above, O'Kane Consultants Pty Ltd (OKC) were 

engaged in 2009 to assist with the assessment of the current cover system and design cover system 

alternatives for the Tailings Dam 2 closure planning. The main objective of this project was to assess the 

research undertaken on the TERF and develop an enhanced store-and-release cover system for Tailing 

Dam 2. To achieve these objectives several tasks were completed as part of the cover system design 

process: 

 A comprehensive field sampling and material testing program to assess potential cover materials 
was undertaken 

 Cover system criteria in terms of impacts of solutes on downstream receptors was assessed, and 

 Several cover system design alternatives were investigated using the information determined 
during this study and from background information 

The recommendation following the research conducted is to rehabilitate the tailings dams by placement 

of 0.3m processed oxide cap with additional 0.1m topsoil. If processing of the material is not economic, 



 

159 

 

the tailings dam should be capped with a 0.3m oxide cap and 0.1m of topsoil. Whilst it was found that the 

thicker, the cap the better the performance, the 0.3m cap was found to perform at a rate suitable to 

prevent downstream impacts on water systems. 

The geochemical characteristics of SGM tailings has been the subject of a number of studies since 

modern mining and mineral processing activities commenced in 1992.  

20.5.3 Dowsley (2001) 

A geochemical and mineralogical assessment of tailings stored at Tailings Dam 1 was completed in 2001 

(Dowsley, 2001). The assessment concluded that SGM tailings were non-acid forming (NAF) due to a 

high degree of buffering minerals in most sections of the dam. The author noted that Tailings Dam 1 had 

been abandoned for 12 years and that an oxidation front had progressed almost half a metre into the 

tailings profile resulting in hardpan formation immediately above the oxidation front. 

20.5.4 Oldmeadow (2008) 

A more recent geochemical assessment of SGM tailings involved a study of experimental tailings 

rehabilitation systems conducted from 2002 to 2006 (Oldmeadow, 2008). The objective of the work was 

to identify cover types and rehabilitation strategies for rehabilitation of the Tailings Dam 2 which will 

cover an area of more than 100 Ha at mine closure. The author concluded that a thin semi-permeable 

composite cover system was appropriate for rehabilitation of SGM tailings. After an initial period of 

weathering and flushing of the tailings surface, the author recommended a final cover system comprising 

0.3m of waste rock and 0.1m of topsoil. 

Stawell Gold Mines regularly updates its estimate of future expenditures. In November 2010 SGM 

submitted the Closure Plan to the Department of Primary Industry (DPI). On review of that document in 

2011 the DPI increased the site bond by AUD$255,000, lifting the total security bond for the site to 

AUD$4,803,000. This estimate is based on an additional cutback conducted at the Wonga pit, available 

information including preliminary closure plans, alternatives and applicable regulations.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

Stawell Gold mines has in place rigorous processes for the estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral 

Reserves. These processes are managed on site and appropriate resources (personnel and drilling) are 

allocated to this function. 

The conclusion of the Qualified Persons as defined in this report are that the Mineral Resources and 

Mineral Reserves as stated in this document are valid and supported by appropriate data collection, 

sampling, processing, interpretation and estimation methodologies and conform to NI 43-101 guidelines.  

The Stawell project has significant production history and the site personnel significant knowledge of the 

ore body and the mining process which adds additional support to the methodologies used to estimate 

the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  

Exploration activities are incorporated into ongoing Life of Mine plans and it is the opinion of the 

Qualified Person that additional exploration is warranted as per the descriptions included in Section 9 of 

this report. 

 



 

165 

 

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

The key recommendations of the Principal author are in respect of ongoing geological testing and mining 

evaluation of the Mineral Resources and Exploration areas at Stawell Gold Mines. A detailed exploration 

program is presented in Section 9 of this report including a proposed Exploration program for 2012.  It is 

the opinion of the author that there remains sufficient prospectively within the Stawell Gold Mines 

tenement to support the proposed program and budgeted expenditure and it is recommended that 

ongoing evaluation of this potential be continued and re-evaluated as exploration results are received.  

It is recommended that Stawell Gold Mines maintain the Mine Geological program as currently 

implemented to supplement currently available geological information in the preparation of detailed mine 

design.
