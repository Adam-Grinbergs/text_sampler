The present NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Lac à Paul Project has been prepared at 

the request of Ressources d'Arianne following preliminary findings of an increased 

milling rate of 50,000 tpd that resulted in improved economic results. The effective date 

of the Report is May 30, 2012. However, the mineral resources estimate is unchanged 

and is dated November 8, 2011.  

The Lac à Paul Property is located in North of Saguenay Lac St-Jean area, the nearest 

village is St-Ludger-de-Millot approximately 175 km south of the property. The property 

is 30 km east of the Chute-des-Passes Hydro-electrical complex of Rio Tinto ALCAN. 

The property is approximately 190 km north of the seaport of Grande-Anse (Saguenay) 

which is a good connection to Saint Laurent River. 

Met-Chem Canada Inc. (Met-Chem) was requested by Arianne to provide a Pre-

Feasibility Study Report for the exploitation of the Lac à Paul deposits. Met-Chem was to 

provide leadership for the mining, process design, tailings, infrastructure, environmental 

aspects, compilation of capital and operating cost estimates at a confidence level of 

± 25%, economic analysis and report preparation integrating geology, mineral resources 

and, metallurgical testing for which information is to be provided by other consultants. 

Process flowsheets for an increased milling rate of 50,000 tpd were developed from the 

recent metallurgical testing program performed by COREM in 2011. The capital cost and 

the operating cost estimates have been developed for the increased milling rate. 

1.2 Geology and Exploration 

The geology and exploration data are a summary of the "Partial Technical Report 

Phosphate and Titanium resource estimation of the Lac à Paul property deposit, 

Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean, Quebec Canada, dated December 19, 2011, prepared by SGS 

Canada Inc.-Geostat. This information was updated with recent exploration data. 

At the beginning of the sixty's, geological mapping and geochemistry studies have been 

done in the area.  Mineral exploration in the Lac à Paul area was initiated by the Mining 

Funds of Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean in 1994. After 1994, Virginia Gold Mines and later on 

Soquem have carried out exploration work on the anorthosite complex of Lac Saint-Jean.  

In 1998, a Phosphorus & Titanium showing that was found in the area of the Lac à Paul 

have been upgraded during prospection campaign conducted by the Mining Funds of 

Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean. 

On May 1999, a petrographic description of the mineralized zone was done by IOS 

Services Géoscientifiques Inc. and on December 1999, Arianne Resources Inc. took an 

option on the property.

The Lac-Saint-Jean anorthosite is the largest anorthositic complex in the world, 

occupying an area of nearly 20,000 km
2
. The property lithology consists mainly of 

intrusive rocks subsequently associated with anorthositic rocks of Lac St.-Jean.  The 

rocks are displayed in the form of coalescing lobes of leuconorites, anorthosite, norite, 

gabbronorite, gabbro with olivine, and gabbro. The lower pyroxenite contains dunites, 

peridotites, Fe-Ti oxides, apatite, jotunites and mangerites.  

Mineralization at the Lac à Paul project originated from magmatic sedimentation and 

segregation within the anorthositic complex. The main geological unit of interest is a 

Nelsonite consisting of apatite and ilmenite-rich layers. Nine apatite mineralized zones 

are reported within Arianne's Lac à Paul project. Zones No 1, No 2  and No 4 are low-

grade apatite-ilmenite bearing gabbros. Only Zone No 2 has been explored significantly 

with diamond drilling. The six other zones, Zone Manouane, Zone Paul, Zone Nicole, 

Zone Lucie, Zone Lise, Zone Intersection and Zone Castor are considered nelsonites and 

are most promising. The Paul and Manouane Zones are the main interest of this report. 

Prior to 2009, a total of 57 diamond drill holes were completed by previous owners and 

Arianne Resources Inc. on the property.  

Arianne's exploration program of 2010/2011 included a sampling campaign performed 

on specific claims of the property and a diamond drilling program. A total of seventeen 

(17) drill holes totaling 4,125 m were carried out on Paul Zone by the company Nordic 

Drilling of Val d'Or. A total of 1418 samples were sent to ALS Chemex laboratory in Val 

d'Or. A total of 35 holes totaling 6,548 m were drilled on Manouane Zone by Forage 

Nordic de Val d'Or (QC). A total of 2,072 samples were sent to the ALS Chemex 

Laboratory. 

Arianne's exploration program of 2011-2012 on the Lac à Paul property, focussed 

primarily in the conversion of indicated resources of the Paul Zone to measured 

resources. The second goal was to explore the zones exhibiting similar geological and 

geophysical characteristics as Paul and Manouane since they had interesting values in the 

previous exploration campaign. The zones delineated by this campaign are named Nicole, 

Traverse, Lise and Lucie. A total of forty-nine (49) diamond drill holes totalling thirteen 

thousand three hundred twenty-six (13,326) meters were drilled on Paul Zone. However, 

at the time of writing this report, there has been no recent update to mineral resource 

estimates since not all assay results have been received. 

1.3 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

Samples from the Paul deposit were sent to COREM for metallurgical test work. Testing 

was performed at a bench scale, a lock-cycle scale and a pilot plant scale. The goal was to 

optimize the separation conditions. Conditions investigated were feed grind size, reagent 

type and dosage amount, flotation circuit and the use of magnetic separation prior to 

flotation. As results from the batch tests and the locked cycle tests indicate, a circuit with 

1 rougher, 1 scavenger and 2 stages of cleaning was efficient to concentrate the Paul 

Zone apatite to a grade of 38.3% and a recovery of 90.7%.

Batch Test (Test 7.1) 38.3 90.7 

Lock Cycle 38.5 94.2 

Pilot Plant 32.4 78.2 

The pilot plant results did not reproduce the batch or lock cycle results in a satisfactory 

manner and results are poor due to two factors: over grinding of the feed and over-dosage 

of Na2SiO3. Over-grinding of the feed has resulted in a poor oxide flotation selectivity. 

Hence, the over-dosage of Na2SiO3 required due to over-grinding has suppressed both the 

intended silicates but also the apatite.  

However, it is expected that with a suitable grind and proper depressant dosages, flotation 

performance of both the batch test (Test 7.1) and the lock cycle test (see above in Table 

1.1) will be obtained. 

Additional grinding and flotation testing was performed on samples from Paul and 

Manouane zones. Although all three samples had lower head grades than pilot plant feed, 

the rougher & scavenger concentrates showed similar recoveries.  

The following are conclusions and recommendations: 

• Over-grinding the apatite mineral results in poor selectivity and therefore poor 

grade and recovery.   

• Liberation analysis of the samples from the Paul and Manouane deposits needs to 

be completed. 

• Grind times need to be completed to achieve the size determined in the liberation 

study.  

• Reagent dosages need to be adjusted, especially for the depressant sodium silicate, 

for optimized recovery and grade. 

• Closed circuits are difficult to control for reagent dosages, as they did make it 

difficult to control for the pilot plant. 

Recent additional testwork was carried out at COREM to produce a saleable magnetite 

concentrate and a saleable ilmenite concentrate. 

The concentration of magnetite to the targeted 65.0% Fe was not feasible using physical 

separation due to very small ilmenite inclusions (less than 2 microns) that prevent 

complete liberation. A 62.0% Fe concentrate was produced. 

The concentration of ilmenite targeted a 44.0% TiO2 concentrate. A process including 

wet high intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS), regrinding to 75 microns and five (5) 

stages of flotation yielded a 44.9% TiO2 concentrate with an overall recovery of 51.5%.

The reader is advised that Arianne Resources Inc. has announced partial results of the 

2011 Fall Drilling Campaign and Winter 2012 that are not included in the estimation of 

resources presented in this Technical Report with effective date of November 8, 2011. 

Drilling is actually ongoing and an updated resources estimate should be made available 

with the Feasibility Study. 

In author's opinion these results increase the lateral extension of Paul Zone near surface. 

The new Nicole zone with its drilling results show potential for a new future mineral 

resource calculation estimate. 

The author cautions that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have not 

demonstrated economic viability. 

1.5 Mineral Reserve Estimates 

Table 1.6 summarizes the proven and probable mineral reserves that resulted from the pit 

designs for the Paul and Manouane deposits based on mineral resource estimate with 

effective date of November 8, 2011. These mineral reserves which account for ore loss 

form the basis of the mine plan. It is to be noted that Zone 2 was not evaluated by Met-

Chem and is not included in this report.

1.6 Mining Methods 

The mining method selected for the Project is conventional truck and shovel. The size of 

the deposit and the production rate favour a 10 m bench height.

Vegetation and topsoil will be cleared by dozers ahead of the mining operation. 

Overburden will be stripped with front end hydraulic shovels and loaded into rigid frame 

mining trucks which will haul it to the waste dump. The ore and waste rock will be 

drilled and blasted then loaded and hauled with the same fleet of trucks and shovels. The 

ore will be hauled roughly 2 km to the primary crusher and the waste rock will be hauled 

to the dump.  

To properly manage water infiltration into the pit, a sump will be established at the 

lowest point on the pit floor. Water collected in this sump will be pumped to a collection 

point at surface. 

The production target for the mine is to supply the maximum ore feed that the plant can 

handle. The target for Year 1 is 13.2 Mt of run of mine ore. This target is a function of 

the plant's ramp up before obtaining full operating capacity. The plant's availability is 

expected to increase from 93% in Year 2 to 95% in Year 4. At 95% plant availability, the 

mine is expected to supply 18.642 Mt of run of mine ore per year (51,075 t/d). 

The mine plan will attempt to supply a constant head grade close to the deposit's average 

although due to the grade variability in the deposits, the grade in the mine plan ranges 

from 6.6% to 7.5% for Paul and from 5.7% to 6.2% for Manouane. The amount of 

concentrate produced is a function of head grade and plant recovery and thus varies from 

an average of 3.2 Mt per year for Paul to an average of 2.2 Mt per year for Manouane.  

The Paul deposit has been selected to be the first deposit to be mined. When its reserves 

are depleted in Year 9, production will begin at the Manouane deposit. The reserves at 

Manouane are depleted in Year 17. 

The haul truck selected for the Project is the 177 tonne Caterpillar 789. A fleet of six (6) 

trucks is required during pre-production. This number increases to six (6) in Year 1, 

sixteen (16) in Year 2, twenty-three (23) in Year 3 and reaches a peak of thirty (30) in 

Year five (5). The number of trucks begins to diminish in Year 10 and reaches eighteen 

(18) by the end of the life of mine. 

The main loading machine selected for the Project is the CAT 6040FS (formerly known 

as the RH170) hydraulic excavator. The CAT 6040FS is an electric driven shovel that 

will be suitable to handle the production requirements as well as the face heights 

expected. A Komatsu WA900-3 wheel loader equipped with a 28 tonne capacity bucket 

has been included in the fleet to be used as an alternate loading machine. 

The fleet of support and service equipment will include up to four (4) Komatsu D275-AX 

(449 kW) track dozers, one (1) Komatsu WD600-3 (362 kW) wheel dozer, two (2) 

Caterpillar 320D excavators, two (2) Caterpillar 16M (221 kW) graders, one (1) Komatsu 

HD785-7 water/sand truck and one (1) Caterpillar 242B3 skid steer.

1.7 Recovery Methods 

The processing plant is designed to process an average of 50,000 t/d of ore to produce 

approximately 8,500 t/d of phosphate concentrate grading at about 38.0% P2O5 based on 

a concentrate recovery of 90% P2O5.  

The ore is trucked from the open pit to the gyratory crusher and the crushed product is 

then sent to a 33,000 tonnes stock pile providing 16 hours of storage for the processing 

plant. The ore is then reclaimed and conveyed to the processing plant to feed the grinding 

circuit. The grinding circuit is made of one 11,400 kW SAG Mill and of a secondary 

grinding stage using two 10,000 kW ball mills operating in a closed loop with stack 

sizers. A magnetic separation process is used to eliminate magnetite prior to flotation. 

The flotation circuit will produce a phosphate concentrate grading over 38.0% P2O5 and 

the tailing is thickened and pumped to the main tailings dam. The flotation concentrate is 

also thickened, filtered and dried to obtain a moisture content below 2.0%.  

The dried concentrate is then stored in an enclosed building before being trucked to 

Dolbeau area located about 200 km from the process plant site.  

1.8 Infrastructure 

1.8.1 Off Site Infrastructure 

Mining equipment, tailings storage facility, concentrate transportation and load-out 

facilities as well as infrastructure and services have been added to complete the 

investment cost of the project.  

The Lac à Paul mine and processing plant will be fed through a 161 kV overhead 

electrical power line supplied and installed by Hydro-Québec from the existing 

distribution point at the Péribonka power generation substation. 

Provision has been made for the upgrade part of the Chemin-des-Passes on a distance of 

approximately 100 km to allow year-round transportation. 

1.8.2 Site Infrastructure 

Tailings 

Tailings storage design is based on two distinct periods: Year 1 to 10, corresponding to 

the processing of Paul pit ore and Years 11 to 17 for the processing of Manouane pit ore. 

A traditional tailings storage facility is designed for Paul mill tailings while it is assumed 

that the Manouane mill tailings will be stored within Paul's depleted pit. 

The first phase, corresponding to the processing of Paul ore, is planned for a 10 year 

continuous operation. The scheme of operation proposes transfer of free water from the 

tailings pond to a polishing pond to allow for sedimentation of fine particles and other 

minerals. Water will be then transferred from the polishing pond to the plant to be used in 

processing. The tailings park includes a potential acid generating (PAG) tailings storage 

pond for magnetite tails (about 10% of the total production) while the remaining

production is considered non-PAG. The water from this pond will be treated before re-

used or released to the environment. 

Once the operation will reach the Manouane deposit after year 10, mill tailings will be 

sent to the depleted Paul pit. The pit is relatively close to the process plant, thereby 

minimizing capital and operating costs for the tailings handling and process water feed 

systems. 

Ancillary Buildings and Facilities 

Provision has been made for ancillary buildings and facilities such as maintenance garage 

and storage, office complex, change house and canteen and permanent camp.  

1.9 Market Studies and Contracts 

An independent market study is expected to be carried out as the project will proceed to 

Feasibility Studies, but no independent analysis of the market for phosphate concentrate 

or price survey have been conducted to date for the Lac à Paul Apatite project.  

Similarly, no sales contract has been secure at this early stage of the project.  

The 175$/tonne sale price that has been suggested by Ressources d'Arianne and which 

was used for the project economic analysis is based on the 85% BPL Russian prices over 

recent years with consideration of the September 2011 CRU 10-year outlook report on 

the phosphate rock market.   

1.10 Environment Studies Permitting and Social or Community Impact 

Preliminary environment considerations have been addressed and legislative framework, 

environmental sensitive areas, issues and project stakeholders have been identified.  

The Project Notice was filed with the MDDEP by Ressources d'Arianne in May 2011 

and the EIA guidelines were issued to Arianne in June 2011. Public consultations are 

being held on the project. 

Geochemical testing was conducted on mine rock and tailings samples to give a 

preliminary assessment of the metal leaching (ML) and acid rock drainage (ARD) as well 

as radioactivity potential of the tailings generated by the project. Results indicate that 

radioactivity will not be an issue for the project and preliminary environmental 

characterization shows that only the magnetic fraction of the tailings can be considered 

potentially acid generating. Mine closure and rehabilitation cost have been estimated at 

US$ 22.8 M. 

1.11 Capital and Operating Costs 

1.11.1 Capital Cost 

The capital cost estimate of Ressources d'Arianne's Lac à Paul Project for apatite 

concentrate production is based on Met-Chem's standard methods applicable for a pre-

feasibility study to achieve an accuracy level of ± 25%.

The total capital cost for the project life at a milling rate of 50,000 tpd is estimated at 

US$ 1.121.3 M where the pre-production initial capital cost is evaluated at US$ 813.9 M 

while the sustaining capital requirement is US$ 307.4 M as shown in Table 1.7. The 

sustaining capital covers for additional mining and concentrate trucks to meet the mine 

plan and replacement over time as well as costs related to the construction of the tailings 

storage facility to its final design elevation.

1.13 Other Relevant Data and Information 

Considering an environmental authorization to proceed with construction expected in 

March 2014, the production start-up date will be first quarter 2016 providing an order is 

placed with suppliers for long lead items by end of 2013. The construction period should 

be approximately 18 months. The detailed engineering is expected to last 12 months. 

Engineering for open pit mining should start November-2013 in order to have the pre-

stripping completed by end of 3
rd

 quarter 2015. 

1.14 Conclusions and Recommendations 

Geology and Mineral Resources 

The author makes the following recommendations to focus on two aspects: the 

improvement of the available data and a working plan to further develop the property. 

• Improvement to Available Data 

In order to increase the precision of waste to ore ratio, the author suggests that 

specific gravity be measured in the footwall and hanging wall waste rock since 

some zones are Ilmenite rich and specific gravity may be underestimated.

Prepare a geometallurgical study where behaviour of crushing and especially 

grinding is assessed in 3d across the deposit so energy and liberation of apatite is 

studied and the mill and mining sequence can be adapter accordingly. 

• Work Program to Further Develop the Project in 3 phases 

The author is aware that Arianne has continued the drilling and is currently drilling 

on the drilling program prepared on June 2012 at the office of Arianne with the 

Author. This program aims at completing an indicated resource to be used for the 

feasibility study.  

Phase 1: A diamond drilling program for 20,000 m of NQ drilling is proposed. This 

program will serve the following two goals (this program is actually on going):  

 Increase the quantity and quality of resources in Paul; 

 Define variability within the zones to allow a better mine sequence 
forecast; 

Phase 2: A diamond drilling program for 25,000 m of NQ drilling is proposed to 

drill western extension to the end of the magnetic anomaly. This program will serve 

the following three goals:  

 Increase the quantity and quality of resources in Paul; 

 Define variability within the zones to allow a better mine sequence 
forecast; 

 Enable low stripping mining scenario with in pit waste filling, i.e. higher 
NPV and faster payback; 

Phase 3: A diamond drilling program for 30,000 m of NQ drilling is proposed. This 

program will serve the following three goals:  

 Enable preparation of a resources in Nicole, Lucie and Lise suitable for 
open pit; 

 Increase the quantity and quality of resources of the property; 

 Define variability within the zones to allow a better mine sequence 
forecast. 

This first phase program is estimated at four million dollars (4,000,000$) out of which 

100% should be dedicated to Paul (infill drilling, lateral extensions and infill drilling for 

lateral extensions). 

Of course these recommendations are made without consideration of the market for 

exploration funds. This being said it is author opinion that completion of phase 1 is a 

requirement for the success of the project. It is likely uncommon in the industry to stop 

drilling while the main deposit is open near surface at both ends.

Mining 

Met-Chem has identified the following opportunities that should be studied as the Project 

advances to the Feasibility stage: 

• The sequencing of the Paul and Manouane deposits should be revisited with the 

intent of maximizing the project NPV (Net Present Value). The solution may be to 

mine both deposits concurrently; 

• Assessment and testing regarding pit slope analysis, hydrogeology, and waste rock 

dump stability will need to be performed to further validate open pit mining 

technical parameters. 

Process 

Additional metallurgical testing will be required to bring the project to a Feasibility Study 

level. The testing performed to date indicated that: 

• Liberation analysis of the samples from the Paul and Manouane deposits needs to 

be completed. 

• Grind times need to be completed to achieve the size determined in the liberation 

study.  

• Reagent dosages need to be adjusted, especially for the depressant sodium silicate, 

for optimized recovery and grade. 

Additional metallurgical testing will be required as the project proceeds to Feasibility 

stage: 

• Additional testwork to firm up design basis of both Paul and Manouane deposits;  

• Continue with testing of ilmenite as a potential by-product. 

1.14.1 Additional Testwork  

• Work indices: Crusher, Ball Mill and Rod Mill (CWi, BWi, RWi). To better define 

rock hardness and rock variability for each of the deposit; 

• Slime removal using cyclones instead of thickeners; 

• Delivery of 60 t from Paul deposit to the selected Laboratory; 

• Batch bench scale test work to make sure that this sample is responding well to the 

developed flowsheet; 

• Continuous Pilot Plant runs;  

• Prepare samples for vendors testwork (Stack Sizers, thickeners, filters, magnetic 

separations);   

• Specific Gravity determination, Ore and Product bulk densities, Ore and product 

angle of repose, and other design parameters.

1.14.2 Ilmenite Testing as a By-Product 

• Liberation analysis of the samples from the Paul and Manouane deposits needs to 

be completed; 

• Grind size determination for both Paul and Manouane deposits; 

• Batch bench scale test work for flowsheet development of apatite and ilmenite 

production of Paul deposit; 

• Lock cycle test (2) to confirm flowsheet for Paul deposit (cycles to be done until 

circulating loads are constant and/or equilibrium is reached); 

• Batch bench scale test work for flowsheet development of apatite and ilmenite 

production of Manouane deposit; 

• Lock cycle test (2) to confirm flowsheet for Manouane deposit (cycles to be done 

until circulating loads are constant and/or equilibrium is reached). 

Tailings Storage Facility and Water Management 

• Geotechnical work such as geotechnical drilling, seismic analysis, stability analysis 

is recommended in the Feasibility Stage to confirm assumptions used for the 

tailings storage facility design and waste piles in the Pre-feasibility assessment as 

well as to permit preliminary foundations evaluation for the plant facilities.  

• Rock mechanics as well as hydrogeological studies will be required to further 

confirm rock slopes, rock permeability, ground and underground water flows and 

water balance. 

• Testing of the tailings geochemical and physical/mechanical properties and 

behaviour is recommended, such as: 

 Geochemical properties testing: ABA (for acid generation), humidity tests 
(coarse and fine fractions), fresh and aged supernatant analysis (coarse and 

fine fractions); 

 Physical/mechanical properties testing: size distribution, specific gravity, 
Atterberg limits, proctor maximum dry density and optimum water 

content, maximum density by vibrator and by drying, minimum density, 

settling, low and overburden stress consolidation settlement. 

• Investigation for borrow banks for suitable materials for construction of the various 

dykes, pads and roads as well as concrete aggregates should be undertaken during 

the Feasibility Study to determine quantities available and distance from the various 

facilities. 

• Condemnation drilling will be required in the area of the Paul's mill tailings storage 

facility. 

• More detailed topographic survey of the site during the Feasibility Phase will 

enhance accuracy of the estimates and associated cost analysis.

Infrastructure 

Condemnation drilling will be required for Lac à Paul mine site and infrastructure 

location such as waste rock dump, primary crusher, process plant, buildings, etc. 

Manouane River, Lac à Paul and groundwater hydraulics should be verified at Feasibility 

stage to determine available flow rates for plant make-up water. 

As the project progresses to Feasibility Studies more information regarding potential 

siting of the Dolbeau-Mistassini concentrate handling site and railcar loading station, 

regional development projects and municipal zoning should be gathered in order to reach 

the required level of detail for Cost estimate. Discussions should also be held regarding 

the proposed trestle bridge across the Mistassini River. 

Environment Considerations 

Meetings with Project Stakeholders should continue as the project progresses to 

Feasibility Studies. 

A summary table of Issues/Potential Impacts identified by Stakeholders should be 

maintained closely.  

A detailed schedule of environmental permitting requirement will need to be prepared. 

This schedule should be integrated in the Master Schedule of the project. 

Based on the preliminary characterization results obtained, it is recommended that at the 

Feasibility Study stage of the project the following be analyzed: 

• Increase the number of samples per type of material that requires environmental 

characterization;  

• Add the environmental characterisation of overburden material type to the database 

of results; 

• Add Manouane zone to the environmental characterisation of waste rock, ore, and 

process tailings;  

• Include Guideline 019 toxicity tests on process tailings decant water for both Paul 

and Manouane deposits.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 

Ressources d'Arianne (Arianne), is a Saguenay based company contemplating a project 

for the construction, installation and operation of an apatite processing facility (the Lac à 

Paul Project) to be located approximately 200 km North of Dolbeau-Mistassini, Quebec. 

The present NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Lac à Paul Project has been prepared at 

the request of Ressources d'Arianne following preliminary findings of an increased 

milling rate of 50,000 tpd that resulted in improved economic results. The effective date 

of the mineral resources estimate remains November 8, 2011 since no change was made 

to the mineral resources estimate.  

The mineral resources were updated in 2011 based on drilling that was conducted on the 

Lac à Paul property in 2010 and 2011. These results were used in 2011 to advance the 

Project to Preliminary Feasibility Study. The NI 43-101 Technical Report (Report) was 

then produced and issued on the Lac à Paul Project on December 19, 2011, for a 

production rate of 33,000 tpd. 

An update of the Preliminary Feasibility Study has been prepared at the request of 

Ressources d'Arianne (Arianne) to present the major findings of the Pre-Feasibility Study 

(PFS) at an increased milling rate of 50,000 tpd.  

The PFS Update Report was prepared by Met-Chem and was completed on  

July 13, 2012. 

The effective date of the Technical Report is May 30, 2012. 

2.1 Terms of Reference – Scope of Work 

Met-Chem Canada Inc. (Met-Chem) was requested by Arianne to provide a Pre-

Feasibility Study Report for the exploitation of the Lac à Paul deposits. Met-Chem was to 

provide leadership for the mining, process design, tailings, infrastructure, environmental 

aspects, compilation of capital and operating cost estimates at a confidence level of  

± 25%, economic analysis and report preparation integrating geology, mineral resources 

and, metallurgical testing for which information is to be provided by other consultants. 

Process flowsheets were developed from a recent metallurgical testing program 

performed by COREM in 2011. The capital cost and the operating cost estimates have 

been developed for an increased milling rate of 50,000 tpd. 

Additional testwork performed by COREM in spring 2012 are discussed in Report. These 

supplemental testwork refers the production of an ilmenite concentrate as a by-product of 

the apatite process. The economics of adding an ilmenite circuit to the apatite process 

was analysed. The results are presented as a trade-off study in the Economic Analysis 

section of the report. This scenario was not retained and the Pre-Feasibility Study update 

was completed on the basis of an apatite only process.

4.2.1 Mineral Rights 

Map designated cells, which define mineral titles according to the Québec mining law, 

are pre-established parcels of land, half a minute of arc by half a minute of arc on the 

NAD-83 projection, the limits of which are predefined by their longitude and latitude. 

These titles are almost irrevocable by the government, and unchallengeable by a third 

party. Their limits being defined by law, they do not need land surveying to be 

officialised. The map designated mineral titles confers exclusive rights to the owner to 

carry out mineral exploration, and to acquire the mining lease in the eventuality of 

exploitation. However, mineral rights do not include surface rights, nor does it include 

rights over resources other than mineral, such as forestry, surface and groundwater, 

cynegetic, halieutic, or hydroelectric. However such surface rights are included within the 

mining lease if the project is located on Crown land.  

Claims have to be renewed every two years. Renewal date is dictated by the anniversary 

dates of individual claims. Claims are considered in good standing. 

The Claims of Arianne Resources Inc. have been validated on the MNR Quebec 

GESTIM website and are listed in Table 4.1 to Table 4.11.

The claims are 100% own by Les Ressources d'Arianne Inc. 

4.3 Royalties 

To the author knowledge the identified royalties are: 

a) A royalty of 1% NSR is applicable on 4 claims; CDC 2121340, CDC 2121341, 

CDC 2129818 and CDC 2129819. For clarification (CDC 2129818 and CDC 

2129819) over the Paul Zone and (CDC 2121340 and CDC 2121341) over the 

Manouane zone. This royalty can be purchased at any time for $666,666 Canadian. 

b) A royalty of 1.5% NSR is attached to 12 claims; two of these are in the Zone 2 

sector while the remaining 10 are in the Zone 1 sector. An additional royalty of 

0.5% NSR is attached to an area of 2 square kilometers around these claims. This 

royalty can be purchased at any time for $500,000 Canadian.   

For the other claims there is no applicable royalties other than normal exploration works 

requirements to maintain the claims in good standing with the Quebec Minister of 

Natural Resources. 

4.4 Organization and restrictions 

The property is located on Crown land ("Territoires non organisés"), within the Fjord du 

Saguenay regional municipality ("MRC"), Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean administrative division 

("02"). 

Restriction 6577: A small exclusion to mineral exploration is present just north of the Lac 

à Paul occurrence along the Manouane River. It has been subtracted for the Betsiamites 

hydro-electric project. This infrastructure will need to be taken into consideration by 

d'Arianne during project planning. The Manouane River delivers a hydroelectric

potential in excess of 225 KW. Even though limitations to mineral exploration and 

exploitation are present, these are not indicated on the MRNF claim map. 

Restrictions 6573, 6574, 6575 and 6576: A set of exclusions to mineral exploration are 

present 5 km to the north-east. These are related to the construction of the Betsiamites 

hydro-electric complex and are not considered as a hindrance to the d'Arianne project. 

Restriction 6572: This restriction to mineral exploration is linked to the Betsiamites 

reservoir, which is expected to be inundated. Mineral exploration is allowed within this 

restriction under certain conditions and permission from Hydro-Québec is needed. This 

restriction is not considered a hindrance to Arianne. 

Restriction 20551: A small area is restricted to mineral exploration is related to this site 

along the Manouane River, west of Arianne. This site is designated as Experimental 

forest. Exploration is allowed under certain conditions. 

Restriction 6578: A small exclusion to mineral exploration is present 12 km to the west 

of the Lac à Paul occurrence, associated with the construction of the Betsiamites 

hydroelectric complex. This restriction is not considered as a hindrance to the d'Arianne 

project. 

Restriction 21925: Mineral exploration is temporarily excluded within this restriction. A 

decision depends on the outcome of the current evaluation whether to designate the land 

as protected. As the proposed route to haul the apatite concentrate traverses this area, a 

designation as protected may imply the construction of a detour route. 

A few parcels of land were loaned by the ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la 

Faune du Québec to individuals in order to built hunting/fishing cabins. An inventory of 

these cabins has not been made by Arianne. 

The Pourvoirie du Lac à Paul, an outfitting camp, owns the exclusive fishing and hunting 

rights over an area which encompasses the northern part of d'Arianne property, including 

the Paul occurrence. No infrastructures belonging to this outfitter is located within the 

property. It is considered that the presence of this outfitter shall not be a hindrance to 

d'Arianne exploration work, assuming that Arianne does not conduct any work during 

moose hunting season. However, in the event of a mining development on the Paul zone, 

interference with the outfitter's activities is expected. However Arianne just purchased 

the outfitter so this is not considered as a hindrance to the Arianne project. 

4.5 Native rights 

The Lac à Paul property Main claim block is located within the ancestral territories 

(Nistassinan) belonging to the Montagnais community of Mashteuiatsh (Pointe Blue, 

Lac-St-Jean). 

The area is overlapped by the ancestral territories of Betsiamites Montagnais community. 

Land claims from the Montagnais nation were partly resolved by the "Entente commune" 

signed with the Québec government. Arianne must request authorization from

community councils prior to proceed with exploration work or logging, authorization 

which is embedded within the government permit. 

There are likely to be ancestral trap lines within the project area, Arianne has been able to 

meet with Tallymen. Mr. Alain Nepton is located north of the property, Mr. Camil Valin 

on the south east and Mr. Adelard Benjamin on the north east. There are no known trap 

lines on the deposit sector.  

Arianne is conducting information sessions and consultation with Native Nations 

representatives in relation to their project.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

It is possible to access the property by two well maintained gravel roads which are used 

by large lumber trucks. The first, called "Chemin-des-Passes" begins from the village of 

Saint-Ludger-de-Milot, north of Alma city. This road was built by the company ALCAN 

(now Rio-Tinto-Alcan) during the "Chute des Passes" dam construction in the southern 

boundary of the reservoir Péribonka (figure below). Since then, foresters companies have 

added a multitude of other paths that contribute to provide good access in the region. The 

main road goes through the forest from the SW region to the NE. The second access road 

begins at the Saint David de Falardeau village north of Chicoutimi. This road is the 

junction with the Chemin-des-Passes SW corner of the sheet 22E/15.  

No community is present in the vicinity of the project. A small settlement exists at Chute 

des-Passes, about 30 km from the property, where a logging camp, some conveniences 

and a few cabins are present. Some services are also available at Alcan's Chutes-des-

Passes and Hydro-Québec's Péribonka hydro-electric complexes, at various logging 

camps as well as at outfitters and floatplane bases.

5.3 Local resources 

The region of Lac St-Jean has an extensive agricultural and forestry industry, it also has a 

significant hydro-power dam system to supply electricity to the aluminum production and 

transformation industry. The mining operations are mainly quarries for aggregates and 

dimensional stone. One world renown underground Niobium mine is located at  

St-Honoré Saguenay which is owned by IAMGOLD. 

Even if the region is not qualified as a mining area, qualified personal may be found in 

the region. The University of Quebec in Chicoutimi has a well developed geological 

department. The Chibougamau area is around 230 km far from the Lac à Paul project and 

offers also mining facilities. The city of Alma can provide basic needs such as food and 

limited accommodation. Several surrounding cities with their distinct services may also 

provide extensive contractor services and supplies within 200 km. 

5.4 Infrastructure 

The main infrastructure at the site is the access roads which are generally in good 

condition. The property area is large enough to support mining operations, 

infrastructures, processing facilities, waste dump and tailings. The nearest power lines are

the major transmission lines from Chute-des-Passes and the Péribona power generation 

complex. Another power line exists at the former wollastonite project (Orleans 

Resources) near Saint-Ludger-de-Millot. Otherwise the Lac à Paul project accesses has 

many facilities left by forestry activities and the property is in the neighbourhood of 

Betsiamites related hydroelectric projects. 

5.5 Physiography 

The hills in the region are usually between 425 and 675 meters above sea level. The 

property is adjacent to lakes and rivers. The claims are limited in the north by the river 

Manouane which shows along its way very steep cliffs. Manouane River crosses from 

east to west in the north of the region and north to south in the west region.   

In NW part of the property, the main lake is the Lac à Paul which is approximately 

400 meters above sea level.

Photo 5.2 taken by Claude Duplessis during February 14 and 17, 2011 site visit, 

illustrates the relatively flat topography and regional vegetation. 

In the area, forest fires and forest exploitation have decimated much of the vegetation and 

contains mainly black spruce. Vegetation includes also white spruce, balsam fir and jack 

pine. There are also birch, poplar and pine bankesians (St-Hilaire, C., Archer, P., 1997). 

Along the shores of lakes and rivers, the white cedar is very common. Bogs are also 

observed in some low regions.

6.0 HISTORY 

Most of this section was taken from the previous Technical Report prepared by IOS-SGS.  

6.1 The pre-1994 period 

Mineral exploration interest in the Chutes-des-Passes area was initiated by Mr. Lionel 

Lefebvre, a local prospector, in the 1970's. Some exploration activity for copper and 

nickel mineralization was recorded by Imperial Oil (GM-27460 and 27031) and N.Q.N. 

Mines (GM-27033, 27034, 28000, 26105, 26106). Little activity was recorded in the 

1980's after the discovery of the Lac du Poisson Blanc deposit. 

Mineral exploration in the Lac à Paul area was initiated by the Fonds minier du 

Saguenay–Lac-St-Jean in 1994 (Barrette, 1994; GM-57004, GM-57006). In the following 

years, prospector's training camps were set-up in the area (GM 57007, 58152), which 

lead to the discovery of copper and nickel occurrences (GM-57007), high purity quartz 

veins (GM 53478, 52422), and subsequently to apatite and ilmenite. 

6.2 After 1994 - Virginia and Soquem copper-nickel exploration 

Starting in 1995, Virginia Gold Mines initiated a reconnaissance program for nickel-

copper in the area and subsequently acquired an option for the Fonds minier claims. 

Within the same period, SOQUEM initiated a similar program in the same area, which 

was promptly merged with Virginia into a single joint-venture. Large properties from this 

project are still active in the area, notably adjacent and east of Arianne. Abundant 

assessment literature is on file: 

• GM-56023: 1998; 18 drill holes, FMSLSJ option; 

• GM-56024: 1997; Mag and HLEM surveys, FMSLSJ option; 

• GM-56149: 1997; Airborne Mag and EM surveys, FMSLSJ option; 

• GM-56382: 1998; Mag and HLEM surveys, FMSLSJ option; 

• GM-56422: 1998; Mag and HLEM surveys; 

• GM-56578: 1998; Mapping and prospecting; 

• GM-57008: 1998; Mapping and prospecting. 

• GM-57184: 1997; Airborne Mag and EM surveys; 

• GM-58190: 2000; 7 Drill holes, including three with apatite-ilmenite intersections; 

• GM-58232: 2000; 3 Drill holes, Apatite-ilmenite; 

• GM-58806: 2000; HLEM Survey; 

• GM-58807: 2001; 11 Drill holes; 

• GM-58815: 2001; 12 Drill holes, MHY occurrence; 

• GM-59143: 2001; 11 Drill holes; 

• GM-60717: 2002; Soquem, SIROTEM, time domain EM survey; 

• GM-60730: 2003; 8 Drill holes, MHY occurrence;

• GM-60731: 2003; Gravimeter survey, MHY occurrence; 

• GM-61185: 2004; 6 Drill holes, MHY occurrence. 

Part of the Virginia-Soquem exploration effort included the Arianne properties. The 

discovery of ilmenite and apatite in the Manouane and Paul zones was accidental and 

occurred in the course of evaluating magnetic and electromagnetic anomalies for their 

copper-nickel potential. Ground and heliborne geophysics as well as two drill holes in 

both occurrences are now available on Arianne. 

6.3 The FMSLS-d'Arianne period 

In 1998, the Québec Department of Energy and Resources (QDER, actually MRNF) 

carried out geological mapping of the 22E map-sheet (Hébert, 1998; Hébert et al, 2009; 

Hébert et Beaumier, 2000). Mapping was undertaken in collaboration with a prospector 

training camp organized by the FMSLSJ (Tremblay, 1998), which lead to the first apatite 

discovery of the area. Interest in this commodity was triggered by the discovery of the 

Sept-Îles deposits two years before by the QDER (Cimon, 1996) and by the fast 

development of the project by SOQUEM. The FMSLSJ and its prospectors staked their 

discoveries (zones no1 to no3), in which claims were granted for option to Ressources 

d'Arianne. Some of these initial claims are still active. Arianne, in collaboration with the 

FMSLSJ, carried out a limited amount of work until 2002: 

• GM-57004; 1995; Prospecting; 

• GM-57006; 1995, Compilation work; 

• GM-57007; 1997; Prospecting; 

• GM-58151; 1999; Prospecting; 

• GM-58152; 1998; Prospecting; 

• GM-58767: 2001; 10 Drill holes; 

• GM-58768: 2000; 2 Drill holes; 

• GM-58769: 2000; Metallurgical testing; 

• GM-59774: 2000; Metallurgical testing; 

• GM-59784: 2002; 12 Drill holes. 

Due to a lack of interest in the capital market, Arianne abandoned the exploration for 

apatite and ilmenite in 2002, allowing most claims to lapse. 

6.4 Recent Arianne involvement 

Arianne's interest in the project resumed in 2008 is stimulated by a surge in phosphate 

price. Arianne re-staked Virginia's Manouane and Lac à Paul occurrence and initiated 

prospecting and drilling work. Arianne's work consisted in: 

• Summer 2008: Prospecting and surface sampling; 

• Fall 2008: Ground magnetometer survey over zone no. 2;

6.5 Previous resource estimates 

The preliminary economic assessment report ("Scoping study") of the Lac à Paul Apatite-

Ilmenite Project of May 2010 was triggered by release of the autumn 2009 drill campaign 

and the publication of indicated resources on the Paul zone by SGS Canada Inc. 

Table 6.1 – May 2010 statement of mineral resources (NI 43-101 compliant) 

6.6 2011 Lac-a-Paul Phosphate Project Prefeasibility Study Results 

A preliminary feasibility study report ("PFS study") of the Lac à Paul Apatite-Ilmenite 

Project was prepared end of 2011on the basis of the indicated and measured resources of 

the Paul and Manouane zones by SGS Canada Inc., November 8, 2011.  

The Study, in compliance with NI 43-101, considered the principal economic factors of 

building and operating the Lac-à-Paul phosphate rock mining project (the "Project") and 

selling apatite concentrate for production of phosphoric acid and fertilizer products. The 

Project is located in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec with easy access to 

rail and the deep water Port of Saguenay. The Study is posted on SEDAR and on the 

Arianne Website. 

6.6.1 Highlights of the Prefeasibility Study ($US): 

• Measured & Indicated resources quadruple to 348 million tonnes of 6.50% P2O5;  

• Additional Inferred resources of 114 million tonnes at 5.46% P2O5 are not included 

in the Study;

• Combined Paul and Manouane proven and probable Mineral Reserves now total 

307 Mt at an average grade of 6.59% P2O5 at an average stripping ratio of  

0.83 (Cut-off grade of 2.43% P2O5);  

• Annual production to average 2 million tonnes of 38% P2O5 apatite concentrate;  

• 25 year mine life at 33,000 tonnes/day with average mill recovery of 89%;  

• Average price of $175/tonne (comparable to 85 BPL FOB Russia which is 

currently sold at $223/tonne);  

• Cash operating cost $98/tonne concentrate (FOB rail Dolbeau-Mistassini);  

• Total Direct CAPEX Cost: $454 M;  

• Indirect CAPEX Cost: $121 M and Contingency: $74 M;  

• Total Initial CAPEX: $649 M;  

• Pre-tax IRR: 19.2%;  

• Pre-tax NPV 8%: $684 M;  

• Pre-tax Capital payback: 4.7 years.  

The all-in cost (CAPEX plus OPEX) estimate of $118 per tonne demonstrates that Lac-à-

Paul is a world-class phosphate rock project with robust economics. The Study also 

confirms that, due to the significant increase in ore resources, a 3 million tonne/year P2O5 

concentrate operation could further enhance project economics by as much as 50%.  

Expanded Mineral Resource (complies with NI 43-101) 

A new resource estimate was calculated by SGS Canada Inc.- Geostat group following 

the completion of the most recent drilling campaigns at the Paul and Manouane zones in 

December 2010 and March 2011 respectively. The resulting increase in M&I resource 

was incorporated into the 2011 prefeasibility study.  

The measured and indicated resource totaled 348 million tonnes (see Table 6.2 for 

details). An additional 114 Mt of inferred resource in Zones Paul and 2 was not included 

in the Study.

6.6.2 Mining/Concentrating 2011 Report 

Mining will be a conventional open pit truck and shovel operation. Zone Paul will be 

mined first for 14 years Zone Manouane to follow. The average mining/milling rate at 

full production is 12.3 M tonnes/year. Metallurgical testing determined that an 89% P2O5 

average recovery is feasible by conventional milling process, yielding concentrate 

production averaging approximately 2 Mt/y. The pit designs for the Paul and Manouane 

deposits resulted in combined Paul and Manouane proven and probable mineral reserves 

totalling 307.1 Mt at an average grade of 6.59% P2O5 and 8.51%TiO2, as indicated

Mining and concentrating costs are estimated at $2.24/tonne mined and $8.33/tonne 

milled. General & Administration costs, which include costs to support the man camp, 

security, training, environmental and laboratory costs, have been estimated at $5.85/tonne 

P2O5 concentrate. 

6.6.3 Apatite concentrate 

The table below shows the chemical composition of the apatite concentrate produced 

from an eight-tonne bulk sample of the Paul Zone. The product quality is very high, with 

P2O5 content of 39% (85% BPL), very low contaminant content and a low CaO/ P2O5 

ratio of 1.3. High P2O5 content allows very efficient shipping ($/tonne P2O5 content). 

Low contaminant content yields non-hazardous gypsum by-products. Low CaO/P2O5 

ratio means lower sulphuric acid use/cost in production of phosphoric acid, MAP and 

DAP.

Phosphoric acid and derivative fertilizers MAP (mono-ammonium phosphate) and DAP 

(di-ammonium phosphate) were tested on Zone Paul concentrate by a leading global 

phosphate rock and fertilizer testing facility. No corrosivity was found during production 

of 28% P2O5 phosphoric acid, the standard grade feedstock for MAP and DAP 

production. Other features noted were high acid filtration rates, no need for froth control 

reagents and low gypsum by-product production. Most notably, the fertilizers produced

6.6.5 Location 

The Lac à Paul project is located in one of the most dynamic natural resource-rich areas 

of the Quebec province.  

Access to the Project is via well-maintained gravel roads (Chemin des Passes) presently 

used for the logging industry. The 165 tonne capacity bridges on this road will support 

trucks capable of transporting 115 tonne loads of P2O5 concentrate. A rail trainload 

facility at Dolbeau-Mistassini, approximately 210 km from the Project is part of the 

project. Concentrate transport cost from the mine to FOB railcars in Dolbeau is estimated 

by Met-Chem at $10.90/tonne. The rail access at Dolbeau-Mistassini connects with the 

North American Rail Network (CN) and also provides access to the year-round accessible 

deep water Port of Saguenay. 

Hydro-electric power is available to the Project just 35 km away, from the 750 MW 

Chute Des Passes Power Plant owned by Rio Tinto/Alcan. The Project is also only 60 km 

from 405 MW Peribonka IV plant owned by Hydro-Quebec. Both options are capable of 

providing sufficient power to the Project. 

6.6.6 Socio-Economic 

With a population of 300,000, a well-educated work force is available to the Project. 

Discussions with the First Nation of Pessamit and local authorities of MRC Fjord-du-

Saguenay are currently in progress. The mine will create about 340 permanent jobs and 

more than 400 indirect jobs and generate substantial direct economic benefits to the 

region. Environmental and socio-economic impact studies are already underway. 

6.6.7 Potential for Enhanced Project Economics 

The study identified potential enhancements to project economics through expanded 

production rates, now feasible given the significant increase in measured and indicated 

resources. The Company has commissioned an initial economic assessment of these

options for completion in Q1 2012, with the goal of determining the most efficient course 

of action. Scaled up production scenarios under consideration include: 

• Annual P2O5 concentrate production of 2.5 million tonnes (40,000 tonne/day ore 

processing);  

• Annual P2O5 concentrate production of 3.0 million tonnes (50,000 tonne/day ore 

processing);  

• Recovery and sale of titanium (ilmenite) concentrate.  

Preliminary results indicate that economics are expected to improve at these production 

rates, as estimates of pre-tax NPV8 increase to $1B at a production rate of 

50,000 tonnes/day, with requirements of additional initial CAPEX of about 20% and 

mine life of about 17 years.  

6.6.8 Sensitivity of Project Economics to Concentrate Price and Operating Costs 2011 Report 

Project economics sensitivity was reviewed for concentrate price and operating costs on a 

pre-tax basis by Met-Chem. The analysis showed a break-even pre-tax NPV8 at 

$135/tonne, a price 23% below the long-term average price for 85 BPL concentrate of 

$175/tonne in constant 2011 $. For comparative purposes, the current price of 85 BPL 

concentrate FOB Russia is $223/tonne. 

The sensitivity analysis showed that for each $1/tonne improvement in cash margin, 

either through higher price or lower operating cost, the pre-tax NPV8 increases by 

approximately $17 million.

7.0 GEOLOGY SETTINGS AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional geology 

This section was extracted from previous reports done in the MRNF sheet 22E/15 by 

(Cimon, J., and Hébert, C., MB 98-09) and (Hébert, C. and Beaumier, M., RG 99-05), 

Geology Quebec; the most relevant information has been translated from French to 

English mainly from that report. 

The Lac-Saint-Jean anorthosite is the largest anorthositic complex in the world, 

occupying an area of nearly 20, 000 km
2
. The entire property is covered by Proterozoic 

rocks of the Grenville Province. It is part of a polycyclic tectonic division according to 

Rivers et al., 1989. The property lithology consists mainly of intrusive rocks 

subsequently associated with anorthositic rocks of Lac-St-Jean (see Figure 7.1).  

Figure 7.1 – Regional geology and location of the anorthosite suite of  

Lac-Saint-Jean within the Grenville Geological Province map 

 from Cimon, J. and Hebert, C., 1998, PRO 98-06 

The rocks are displayed in the form of coalescing lobes of leuconorites, anorthosite, 

norite, gabbronorite, gabbro with olivine, and gabbro. The lower pyroxenite contains 

dunites, peridotites, Fe-Ti oxides, apatite, jotunites and mangerites. In general, the 

morphology of the anorthosite lobes is quite similar; the core of the bodycontains 

relatively pure anorthosite.

Rocks surrounding the gneissic complex contain hornblende with quartz-biotite, gneiss, 

granulitic gneiss, and gabbroic ribbon gneiss. These rocks were laterinjected by the 

intrusion of felsic granite, monzonite and hypersthene (Hébert, C. and Beaumier, M., RG 

99-05). The metamorphic phase is upper amphibolite facies to granulites.  

In a structural sense the deformed SALS (Suite Anorthositiqie Lac St-Jean) originated 

from three major events (Hébert et al., 1998; Turcotte, 2001): 

• Event D1, associated with the Grenvillien thrust fault; generated an East-West 

oriented fabric; 

• Event D2, folding of D1 generating important north-east south-west deformation 

corridors with oblique movement and dextral reverse thrust; 

• Event D3, sinistral en echelon faulting of D1 & D2 likely responsible for 

generating the brittle-ductile faults oriented north-south to north-northeast/south-

southwest. 

Moreover, a major shear crosses the SALSJ, the Lac-Saint-Jean-Pipmuacan fault, 

oriented north-east south-west. This fault and associated shearing has potentially played a 

role in the setting of the SALSJ within the Grenville Province. (Hébert et Lacoste, 1998a; 

Fredette, 2006).  

The anorthositic rocks of Lac St-Jean represent an assembly of scales (or sheets) that 

straddle the older gneissic units. Anorthositic massifs are particularly abundant in the 

Grenville Province. Its economic potential is usually limited to deposits of Fe-Ti-P. 

The property is located in the central region of the Grenville geological province. 

7.2 Property Geology 

The Lac-à-Paul property is located in the MNR sheets 22E/15 and 22/10. Its basement 

contains rocks which belong to the Grenville geological province. The region lies in the 

allochthonous polycyclic belt according to suggested subdivisions by Rivers et al., 1989.  

The dominant rocks are a sequence of mafic to ultramafic rocks, which contain 

anorthosite, leuconorite, norite, gabbronorite, gabbro with olivine, gabbro, pyroxenite and 

locally peridotite, dunite and magnetite.  

The anorthosite, norite and the leuconorite occupy the most important area of the 

southern half of map sheet 22E/15. Ultramafic rocks are associated mainly with the 

norite. The northern part of the anorthosite suite is occupied by a large area of coronitic 

gabbronorite while the SE corner of the region is occupied by a massive gabbro. The host 

rock is derived from quartzo-feldspathic gneiss with biotite andhornblende, granulitic 

gneiss, gray and pink gneiss, and gabbroic gneiss. The Figure 7.2 presents the regional 

geology including the 2010 claim blocks of Arianne. 

The youngest outcropping rocks lie in the SW corner. They belong to the granite of La 

Carpe (~ 35 km
2
), which contains granite (charnockite) and monzonite (mangerite) with 

or without hypersthenes. This pluton takes its name after the La Carpe Lake located in the

west of Chute-des-Passes (22E/l4) (Hébert, C., and Beaumier, M., 1999 RG 99-05). The 

rocks of the anorthositic suite overlap the gneiss, which had previously been exposed to 

one or more phases of deformation. Sub-horizontal shear zones are observed at different 

scales. A penetrating mass developed simultaneously; it is orthogonal to the plane of 

overlap with an orientation parallel to the transport direction of the different layers to the 

ESE or WNW. The mass is a congregation of folds and boudins of nelsonite, which 

provides a concentrated layer of phosphate enrichment. The mylonite zone orientated 

SSW-NNE is located immediately to the west of Paul Lake (see Figure 7.2) and 

represents the bottom of one of these concentrated layers. A later episode of deformation 

is represented by sub-vertical ductile shear lineations, which plunge to the north (a trend 

could not be determined). The zone width is on the order of kilometers and is orientated 

NNE-SSW with an abrupt dip to SE. Finally, Duhamel Lake is parallel to a roughly N-S 

trending lineament; however there is no shear or apparent movement observed along it. 

The work done by Arianne Resources Inc. in 2000 and 2001 (GM 58768, GM 58767 & 

GM 59784) confirmed the presence of anorthosite, anorthositic gabbros, and some 

gneissic horizons in the Lac-à-Paul area. The master's thesis from Sophie Turcotte 

indicates a general 30 degree dip to the north; sub-horizontal stratum is frequently 

observed. The structure is observed in Zone 2 and the Paul zone appears to be sub-

vertical. Detailed mapping of the Manouane zone is un-going. 

Figure 7.2 is an extract map from the previous technical report and does not reflect the 

recently updated claim boundaries.

Figure 7.2 – Geological map of the Lac à Paul property (position of the claims in 2010) 

Grenvillian geology of the Lac St-Jean area was first described by Laurin and Sharma 

(1968) at a scale of 1: 250 000 and compiled by Avramtchem and Piché (1981). 

Information given on this map is limited. It indicates the Lac à Paul area is included in an 

anorthosite lobe flanked by gabbros and hosted in quartzofeldspahtic grey gneiss and 

granites. The area was mapped in greater detail by Hébert (Hébert and Baumier, 2000; 

RG-99-05), at a scale of 1: 50 000. The property geology map is taken from Hébert and 

Beaumier (2000). It remains the most accurate geologic map available. According to this 

map, the vast majority of the property is underlain by norite and leuconorite, with some 

pyroxenite and gabbronorite. Three north-northeast trending faults have been reported. 

Lithofacies vary on a small scale and are more diverse than what is indicated on Hébert 

and Beaumier's map. 

7.3 Mineralization 

Mineralization at the Lac à Paul project originated from magmatic sedimentation and 

segregation within the anorthositic complex. The main geological unit of interest is a 

Nelsonite consisting of apatite and ilmenite-rich layers.

Nine apatite mineralized zones are reported within Arianne's Lac à Paul project. Zones 

no. 1, no. 2 and no. 4 are low-grade apatite-ilmenite bearing gabbros discovered by the 

FMSLSJ and will be discussed only briefly. Only zone no. 2 has been explored 

significantly with diamond drilling. Zone no3 is no longer part of the land package; 

Arianne did not renew the claims due to the low grades encountered. The six other zones, 

Zone Manouane (Man), Zone Paul (Pau), Zone Nicole, Zone Lucie, Zone Lise, Zone 

Intersection and Zone Castor, are considered nelsonites and show the most promise. The 

Paul and Manouane zones are the central interest of this report. Figure 7.3 presents the 

position of each mineralized zones.

7.3.1 Paul Zone 

The Paul zone is Arianne's prime target. It is located in the northern part of the property 

on claims no. 2129818, no. 2129818 and no. 2167470. The zone occupies a small 

hillcrest adjacent to the north of Lac à Paul (UTMX: 374000; UTMY: 5529000). It is 

easily accessible via various logging trails connecting to the road leading to Manouane 

River. Less than 10 meters of overburden has been reported. 

The rocks consist of an olivine nelsonite, composed of similar proportions of apatite, 

ilmenite, magnetite and olivine, plus accessory pyroxene, feldspar and biotite as reported 

and validated by Réjean Girard from IOS. Depending on mineral proportions, this layered 

rock can vary between a genuine nelsonite, a troctolitic nelsonite, a troctolite (olivine-

plagioclase rock), a pyroxenite, a gabbroic anorthosite, etc. 

These facies are intricate or layered in a disorderly fashion. This zone is embedded in 

apatite-free gabbroic to anorthositic host rock. The difference between the various facies 

is subtle, and detailed correlation between drill holes remains tricky. The Paul zone is 

known to extend at least 1,300 meters, aligned east-southeast. Ovoid in shape, its width is 

not constant, between 150 and 300 meters (presumed thickness of zone). The zone is 

open at depth and presumed true thickness range from 150 to 300 meters. 

The zone is open to the east and to the west although the magnetic survey indicates it is 

pinched. The magnetic survey also indicates a complex internal structure, likely 

involving folding and stacking. Bedding attitude is not well constrained. Due to the 

diffuse lithological contacts the structure has been interpreted as twisted, dipping north at 

the east end, sub-vertical at its center and dipping south at the west end. This 

interpretation is still considered valid as of today. Knowledge delineating the geometry of 

the zone is improving; however additional work is still needed. The lack of detailed 

understanding is not regarded as a severe hindrance considering the bulk open-pit mining 

approach. 

7.3.2 Manouane Zone 

The Manouane zone is located in flat terrain, 5.5 km east of Lac à Paul, 2 km south of the 

bight on the Manouane River (UTMX: 381300, UTMN: 5527000). Access required the 

logging of a 3 km trail by Soquem in 1998. The zone is situated under poorly drained 

muskeg; outcrop is therefore limited and summer access for drilling is impeded Thick 

overburden is reported (10-28 m).  

The Manouane zone is dominated by a magnetite-bearing nelsonite, similar to the Paul 

zone. This nelsonite is interbedded with gabbros, anorthosite and tonalite layers. Again, 

no detailed correlation was attempted between holes. The exact attitude of layering is 

uncertain. The zone is currently known to extend to 900 meters long, trend northeast-

southwest and be open at both ends. It has an apparent width of about 400 meters, 

although this width is not well constrained. The Manouane is characterized by two 

apatite-enriched zones within the sector. These zones are connected in the Eastern region

and have variable inclination going west. This current outline approximately mimics the 

aeromagnetic anomaly. The zone has been tested to a depth of almost 325 meters where it 

is still open, it is also open at both the east and west ends. Depth is constrained down to 

125 meters at the east end. 

7.3.3 Zone No. 2 

Zone no. 2 is the only zone acquired from the FMSLSJ upon which significant 

exploration effort was spent. It is located about 10 km south-southwest of Lac à Paul, in 

an area with rugged topography near the Castor-Qui-Cale River (UTMX: 

366500,UTMY: 5516500). Scattered anorthosite outcrops were located in the area, with 

the typical crumbling weathering style. The zone no. 2 occurrence is made up of apatite-

ilmenite bearing homogeneous anorthositic gabbro, with minor variable gabbro and 

anorthosite. Nelsonite and troctolite are reported as small pods. 

The zone is known to extend about 1200 meters trending northeast and has a know width 

of up to 300 meters. It has been tested by drilling to a depth of about 120 meters. The 

rock is rather massive. Differences between facies are subtle and detailed correlation 

between drill holes is difficult. The attitude of the layer is suspected to be sub-horizontal. 

The zone can be regarded as open in every direction. The magnetic pattern over the zone 

is irregular and of little help in delineating mineralization. 

7.3.4 Zone No. 1 

Little exploration has been done in zone no. 1, one of the areas initially discovered by 

FMSLSJ. It is located 6 km south-east of Lac à Paul, by UTMX 380600 and UTMY 

5521700. It consists of an apatite-bearing gabbro which is displayed as friable outcrops 

along road cuts. Aside from prospecting, two (2) short surface holes were drilled in 2000, 

followed by an additional seven (7) in 2001 to a depth of 30 meters. The zone is open in 

all directions and at depth. A preliminary inferred resource estimate was calculated by 

Arianne at the time, not NI-43-101 compliant. 

7.3.5 Other zones (Nicole, Castor, Intersection, Lise and Lucie) 

The Nicole, Castor, Intersection, Lise and Lucie zones are zones of prospection and only 

current limited surface sampling data is available with limited drilling of 2009. During 

the fall 2009 drilling campaign, 4 holes were drilled near the south-western part of the 

Lucie Zone, three others near the Lise zone and finally, three were located around the 

Intersection zone. The best result is an intersection of 99 meters with 5.31% P2O5 along 

the hole LPA-09-10 drilled on the Lise Zone.  

No additional drilling has been done as per a current cut-off date of summer 2011. The 

author is aware of diamond drilling in these zones in summer and fall 2011 but results 

were not available and are not part of this report. No details are available regarding 

length, continuity, type and distribution as these zones are at an early stage of 

exploration.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The deposits originate from magmatic sedimentation and segregation within the 

anorthositic complex. The main geological unit is a Nelsonite. 

Two types of apatite-ilmenite occurrences are present within the Lac à Paul Project. Both 

are magmatic in origin and form specific facies of the Lac-St-Jean Anorthositic complex. 

Although these kinds of deposits are known to be associated with various anorthosite 

complexes around the world, none are currently being mined for the phosphate content. 

However, similar deposits with dominant ilmenite are currently mined at Lac Tio (Rio 

Tinto Iron Titanium, Havre St-Pierre, Québec) and Tellnes (Norsk Hydro, Norway). 

Numerous occurrences are currently under evaluation in Québec for their iron and 

titanium content. 

8.1 Nelsonite type 

Manouane and Paul zones are made of layered, medium-grained, olivine nelsonite. These 

are layered sequences composed of various proportions of ilmenite, magnetite, apatite 

and olivine minerals. Nelsonites, first described from Nelson County in Virginia, are 

usually defined as ilmenite-apatite±rutile, although biotite, magnetite, olivine and 

pyroxene may be present. Most known occurrences are described from gabbroic and 

anorthositic intrusions, although some are reported from granites and carbonatites. 

Genesis of anorthosite-related nelsonite is still debated, but usually accepted as a liquid 

segregation from a titanium-iron-phosphorus saturated mafic-anorthositic silicate magma. 

Segregation is considered to be triggered by silica polymerization caused by wall-rock 

contamination. This explains why such deposits are typically found in the proximity of 

anorthosite-gneiss contacts. A simple differentiation-accumulation process cannot be 

invoked to generate these unusual rocks. 

Most nelsonite occurrences described in literature are ilmenite dominated, and occur 

either as pods or layered sequences. Examples are known in the Sept-Îles Complex, Lac 

De La Blache Anorthosite, St-Urbain Anorthosite, and in various locations within the 

Lac-St-Jean Anorthosite, as well as in the Archean Lac Doré and Bell River complexes. 

8.2 Gabbroic type 

The zone 1 to zone 3 occurrences, which initially attracted Arianne's attention, are 

apatite-ilmenite bearing, coarse-grained gabbros. Coarse-grained, granular, idiomorphic 

gabbroic rocks with millimetric sized grains host disseminated apatite and ilmenite. Their 

abundance is lower than nelsonite, and suggests that titanium and phosphorus did not 

reach saturation in the magma. They form large volumes extending for kilometers. 

Outcrops in the Lac à Paul area are heavily weathered, with the rock crumbling into 

gravel due to frost dislocation along straight grain boundaries.

8.3 Carbonatite type 

Most apatite currently mined in the world (Ontario, Kola Peninsula, Brazil) is from 

carbonatite complexes. It should be noted that Lac à Paul deposits are not carbonatite 

hosted. 

Carbonatite hosted deposits have higher apatite grades, typically 30-70%. However, 

carbonatite deposits present difficulties such as lower apatite recovery, carbonate 

contamination of the concentrate, and higher harmful contaminants such as uranium and 

fluorine, among other complications.

9.0 EXPLORATION 

The 2010/2011 exploration program has mainly consisted of a sampling campaign 

performed on select claims of the property. The surface exploration is followed by a 

diamond drilling campaign which is presented in the next section of this report  

9.1 Prospecting 2010 

Prospecting occurred from July 27 to August 10, 2010. The purpose of this prospection 

work was to map and sample outcrops located over magnetic signatures similar to those 

of the Paul and Manouane Zones. For this reason the Magnetic survey data has been 

reprocessed and used. 

A total of two hundred and ten (210) outcrops were visited. From these one hundred and 

eight (108) rock samples were taken and sent to ALS Chemex laboratory in Val d'Or. 

Thirteen (13) major elements under oxide forms have been analyzed by lithium borate 

fusion with XRF (ALS code ME-XRF06). 

P2O5 and TiO2 are the main components of interest. The following figure presents the 

prospection work of summer 2010. The work performed was supervised by Patricia 

Néron, Eng., and supervisor of Arianne. 

9.2 Bulk sampling 2010 

A bulk sample was taken on July 26, 2010, north of the stripped zone on Paul. The 

blasting, excavation and reclamation work were performed by Location ALR Inc. from 

Alma. 

Position of the bulk sample is shown on Figure 9.1.

9.3 Cleaning of the 2009 stripping area 

From May 26 to 28, 2010, restoration work was completed on the stripping area from 

October 2009. The area is roughly 90 m² (30 x 30 m), easily accessible, and is located 

south of hole PAU-09-18 and west of hole PAU-09-17. 

9.4 Results 2010 

Most of the outcrops were made of anorthosites, gabbros, ferrogabbros and pyroxenites. 

Some nelsonites, massive oxides, diorites, tonalites, granites and granodiorites were also 

observed. No geological map has been produced from this data yet. 

Out of the one hundred and ten (110) samples, twenty-four (24) have returned values 

above 5 % P2O5, with three (3) exceptional values of 12.303%, 13.79 % and 38.3 % P2O5. 

The value of 38.3% of P2O5 is explained by the nature of the sample, which is a natural 

concentrate of coarse apatite crystals. In regards to titanium, forty-eight (48) samples 

have shown values above 5 % TiO2, with seven (7) between 10-30 % TiO2. These grades 

were observed in massive oxide lithologies. The following figures present the P2O5 and 

TiO2 compilations.   

This work has generated new drilling targets. 

A part (20 kg) of the one tonne "bulk sample" was crushed and grinded at IOS 

Laboratory in Chicoutimi for use as an internal standard. The rock has not been milled 

nor processed as a standard understanding of a bulk sample. 

9.5 Exploration works 2011 

Prospection works occurred in summer 2011. The purpose of this prospection work was 

to map and sample outcrops in newly acquired claims and sectors not previously 

investigated. 

The compilation of work is still in progress. The following figure presents prospection 

work of summer 2011. The work was performed under supervision of Christian Tremblay 

Sr. Geologist and supervisor of Arianne. 

A total of four hundred and twenty seven (427) outcrops were visited. Main lithologies 

observed were: gabbros, ferro-gabbros, anorthositic gabbros, anorthosites and nelsonites.

10.0 DRILLING 

10.1 Previous & Historical Drilling 

Historical drilling on the property has consisted of diamond drill hole.  

• 1970  

NQN Mines Ltd. carried out exploration work using geophysical methods, 

geological mapping and drilling, in west of Chute des Passes. No detailed data is 

available. 

• 1997 

Mapping projects in some properties were conducted by Quebec Geology. It was 

done for series of geological surface sections of recognition. Virginia Gold Mines 

and SOQUEM did various exploration activities and 18 holes for 1998 m were 

drilled (Isabelle, R., 2000). 2 of these holes are located in Manouane Zone and 

2 holes in Paul zone.  

• 1999 

On December 1999, Arianne Resources took an option on the property. A drilling 

campaign by diamond drill BQ was done and the total length drilled was 51.56 m. 

It consisted in two (2) holes that were located in Zone 1 and the campaign was 

completed on March 2000 (IOS, rapport 00-197-2, Girard, R., 2000). 

• 2001 

10 drill holes were drilled in the first campaign (Internal report, 2000-2001). The 

total length drilled was 270 m in order to better define the mineralized horizon. 

7 holes were drilled on Zone 1 and 3 holes on Zone 2. At the end of 2001 Arianne 

Resources Inc. had realized 8 additional holes on Zone 2. 

• 2008-2009 by Arianne 

Following the positive results of the surface sampling and the increasing Phosphate 

market value, Arianne Resources Inc. had decided to explore this property in order 

to prepare the first mineral resource NI 43-101 compliant estimate with the SGS-

Geostat Ltd. group on 3 main areas of the property (Zone Paul, Zone 2 and Zone 

Manouane).  

A diamond drilling campaign was planned in order to better define three of the 

most promising zones and perform a calculation of the mineral resources. This 

campaign was conducted in two distinct periods by the drilling company Dami-Or 

of Sullivan, Quebec, Canada.  

The first campaign took place from October 27 to November 22, 2008. More than 

1,860 meters were drilled with 13 drill holes on the Zone Paul; and 9 drill holes on 

Zone 2 totalling about 924 meters.

The Paul zone drilling was on 5 sections oriented north/south and separated by 200 

to 300 meters. 2 to 3 drill holes spaced approximately 100 meters had been planned 

by section. It was possible to test a 140,000 m
2
 area about 1 km long. 

The Zone 2 drilling consisted of 3 sections oriented west/northwest, east/southeast 

and 200 meters spaced. Each section consisted of 3 holes spaced approximately by 

100 meters. It was scheduled to test an area of 120 000 m
2
, but only three sections 

were completed.  

The second drilling campaign occurred from January 19 to February 7, 2009. 

Thirteen (13) drill holes totalling 1947 m were drilled on the Manouane Zone. It 

consisted of 4 sections oriented northwest/southeast. The drill holes were spaced 

about 200 meters and included 2 to 4 holes spaced approximately 100 meters apart 

on sections. Then, it allowed the testing of an area of more than 120,000 m
2
.  

10.2 Drilling 2010-2011 

The following section is a summary of Arianne exploration reports filed with Quebec's 

Minister of Natural Resources (work assessment) that was translated into English. 

10.2.1 Paul 

The drilling program on the Paul Zone was undertaken to upgrade the inferred mineral 

resources in the western part of the deposit into indicated mineral resources and also to 

verify the lateral extension of the deposit to the west. 

Seventeen holes totalling 4,125 m of diamond drilling were carried out by the company 

Nordic Drilling of Val d'Or. 1,418 samples were sent to ALS Chemex laboratory in Val 

d'Or. They were analyzed for major elements by X-ray fluorescence (ME-XRF06) 

method. 

The main geological units observed in this area consist of Anorthosites, Gabbros and 

Nelsonite. 17 of 18 holes have intersected the mineralized zone. Several holes have 

interesting results, such as the following holes: Pau-10-32, 10-33, Pau, Pau, 10-37, 10-38, 

PAU, PAU-10-40, 10-41, PAU and PAU-10-46. These holes indicate intersections 

exceeding 200 meters totalling more than 6.00% P2O5 and 6.00% TiO2. 

This drilling program has allowed extension of the mineralized zone further to the west. 

In addition, it remains open laterally and in depth.  

The drilling campaign conducted in the fall of 2010 took place between November 2 and 

December 8, 2010. It was designed to convert inferred resources estimated at 58 Mt 

grading 6.97% of P2O5 and 8.00% of TiO2 in indicated resources, which would add up to 

78 Mt at 7.24% of P2O5 and 7.84% of TiO2 inferred resources (May 2010). It was also 

required to check the presence of a possible extension to the west and to identify some 

important geological contacts. A total of seventeen diamond drill holes were carried out 

by the Nordic Drilling Company. The positions of the drill holes are shown in Figure

10.2.2 Manouane 

This section presents the definition drilling campaign that was carried out during the 

winter of 2010 and 2011 on the Manouane Zone located on the Lac à Paul property. 

A total of 6,548 m in 35 holes were drilled and the diamond drilling program was 

performed by Forage Nordic de Val d'Or (QC). 2,072 samples were sent to the ALS 

Chemex Laboratory located in Val d'Or (QC). They were analysed for major elements 

using the XRF method (ME-XRF06). 

The lithology observed in this area is mainly composed of Nelsonites, anorthositic 

Gabbros and occurrence of Anorthosites, Diorite and Tonalites. 

The drilling campaign allowed delimitation of the mineralized zone. This zone covers an 

area of 1,000 m (length) by 250 m (width). In addition, this mineralized zone still 

laterally opens to the East. It seems to close at about 150 m depth.   

It is recommended to extend the drilling program in this area. Additional diamond drill 

holes will be useful to verify and confirm the presence of a mineralized extension to the 

Eastern part of this area.  

The drilling campaign carried out in the winter of 2011 was conducted between 

February 7 and March 30, 2011. It was designed to convert inferred resources estimated 

at 137.7 Mt grading 5.71% P2O5 and 8.92% TiO2 in indicated resources. It was also 

necessary to verify the lateral extension and depth of the deposit. A total of thirty-five 

(35) diamond drilling was carried out by the Nordic Drilling Company. The locations of 

the drill holes are shown in Figure 10.2. Table 10.3 gives the coordinates (UTM NAD 

83), depth, orientation and dip each of them.

A total of 6,548 m were drilled in the 35 drill holes. Almost all the holes were analyzed 

and 2,072 samples were collected. They were first sent to the laboratory of IOS 

Geosciences in Saguenay. This company was in charge of the pre-treatment of samples 

(drying, grinding and splitting). Subsequently, a predetermined amount (about 250 g) of 

each sample was shipped to ALS Chemex for analysis of major elements (including P2O5 

and TiO2) by X-ray fluorescence (ME-XRF06). 

The rocks intersected by the holes are mainly anorthositic gabbros and nelsonites. Some 

tonalites, anorthosites, diorites, amphibolites and pegmatites are also present. Enrichment 

in Fe-Ti oxides and apatite is observed in nelsonite, gabbros, anorthosites and sometimes 

in the diorites. All drill holes intersected mineralization over lengths ranging from 11 to 

over 250 meters. The hole named Man-11-25 was stopped in mineralization because the 

drill could not cross a zone interpreted as a fault. 

Figure 10.2 - Location of diamond drill holes winter 2011 - Manouane  

Several drill holes have interesting that show a marked enrichment in TiO2 and P2O5. 

Indeed, five drill holes (Man-11-26, 34, 35, 36 and 39) have intersected the mineralized 

zone over a hundred and fifty (150) meters long with at least 6.00% P2O5 and 8.50% 

TiO2. The drill hole Man 11-39 has an intersection of 151.85 meters grading 7.16% P2O5 

and 9.94% TiO2. Two holes have intersected the mineralized zone over more than 

200 meters long, with grades of more than 5.00% of P2O5 and 7.50% of TiO2. Table 10.4 

shows the significant intersections connected to each of the drilling holes. 

All the drilling reports and geochemistry analysis database were submitted to SGS

10.3 Drilling 2011-2012 

The following section is a summary of Arianne exploration reports filed with Quebec's 

Minister of Natural Resources (work assessment) that were translated into English. 

During 2011-2012, Arianne Resources executed a lot of works on their Lac à Paul 

property. Initially, these works were intended to convert the indicated resources of the 

Paul Zone to measured resources. The second scope of the works was to explore the 

depth extents of zones exhibiting similar geological and geophysical characteristics as the 

Paul and Manouane Zones. Furthermore, some areas had presented interesting values in 

the previous exploration campaign. The zones delineated by this campaign are named 

Nicole, Traverse, Lise and Lucie (see Figure 10.3).

10.3.1 Paul Zone 

The drilling to convert the resources of Paul Zone was executed between 

September 13, 2011 and April 15, 2012. There were forty-nine (49) diamond drill holes 

totalling thirteen thousand three hundred twenty-six (13,326) meters. This campaign 

represents the first stage of the conversion of resources since drilling has permitted to 

extend the depth and expand East and West extents of the zone at the same time. 

However, there has been no recent resource estimates as not all assay results have been 

received. It is worth mentioning that the last resource estimate done by SGS Geostat in 

Blainville current from 2011 end only included drill holes dated from 2008 to 2010, thus 

PAU-08-01 to PAU-10-48. Phase 2 will start June 4, 2012 and will total approximately 

20,000 meters of drilling.

The last drill hole by Arianne Resources, dated from April 15, 2012, is PAU-12-97. At 

the time of this writing, only results from PAU-11-49 to PAU-12-85 had been received. 

We are waiting for the remaining data. Drilling has also started and is continuing 

developing the resources at Paul. 

a) Areas of Exploration 

The four (4) exploration areas previously mentioned contain forty-one (41) 

diamond drill holes totalling seven thousand six hundred and seven (7,607) meters.  

They are divided as follows: 

 Lise Zone: 9 drill holes totalling 1,401 meters; 

 Nicole Zone: 20 drill holes totalling 4,005 meters; 

 Traverse Zone: 6 drill holes totalling 954 meters; 

 Lucie Zone: 6 drill holes totalling 1,247 meters. 

These areas of exploration have proved the presence of P2O5 and TiO2 

mineralization. The following tables show the significant intersections of every drill 

hole. A map of each area shows the location of every borehole.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

This section describes the method and approach used by Arianne Resources Inc.  

This section is the same as presented in year end 2011 since the resources were not 

update prior to study of the 50,000 TPD scenario (the updated preliminary feasibility 

study). 

The Lac à Paul deposit has been sampled by BQ & NQ diamond drill holes, 2008 to 2011 

is NQ drilling. The drill hole spacing now varied from 60 to 125 meters. The cross 

section spacing varies from 60 meters to 150 meters but generally 90 meters.  

The deposits are recognized over lengths over 1 km each and are massive structure with 

an average thickness of about 150 to 300 meters depending of the deposit. 

The rock is competent and core recovery is extremely good. The samples are of good 

quality and are representative of the intersected rock. The mineralized rock being 

generally of massive fine grain, SGS Geostat does not recommend drilling smaller than 

BQ diameter.  

The mineralization with grade of interest is within the nelsonite unit of the anorthositic 

complex. This Nelsonite has some inclusions and is intersected from times to times by 

quartz and dykes which are barren, these sections are not sampled and are considered 

zero grades. The decision to sample is based on the aspect of the rock and its visual 

composition. The core is usually sampled and analyzed over its full length.  

The mineralization is associated with significant magnetic expression on surface. It was 

found that a layer of relatively high grade TiO2 with magnetite is at contact of the 

Nelsonite, this layer of low grade apatite is difficult to differentiate from the normal 

mineralization so it is sampled and the analytical results assist in putting the contacts 

during interpretation phase at the Paul Zone. 

The surface sampling by Arianne Resources Inc. is made by hammering the surface rock 

in order to get about 2 to 5 Kg of rock which is put into a bag with a tag and label. The 

rock is described and the position recorded with a hand held GPS. 

For the core recovered by diamond drilling, the core boxes were identified, length of core 

were marked with wood blocks and the boxes were closed and wrapped from drill site to 

portable core logging and splitting facilities of Arianne Resources Inc. 

At the core shack the core was reviewed and logged by geologist; sections to sample 

were identified by geologist (Christian Tremblay, registered P. Geo. in Province of 

Quebec). Afterward the technicians prepare the core and split the core in half to keep a 

witness core. This was done under supervision of Arianne Resources Inc. contract 

geologists Christian Tremblay. Samples bags with label and tags were sealed and put into 

rice bags and identified for shipping to laboratory facilities. 

There are no reason to believe that work performed by Arianne staff and contractors was 

not made in a professional manner, hence in the author's opinion, the work performed by

Arianne is in respect with the standard of best practice for sampling and logging diamond 

drilling core. 

Initially in the Lac à Paul exploration by Arianne, sample length were at 1.5 meter long, 

after reception of the first drilling campaign results with relatively low variation of grade 

within 2 samples of 1.5 m, decision was made to increase sample length to 3 meters the 

author has participated in this decision. The standard sample length for the 2010 and 

2011 drilling in this report is three (3) meters. 

The NQ core was separated in two parts with a hydraulic core splitter, witness core was 

preserved. The half core sample is put into plastic bags, tagged and sealed. The sample 

bags where afterward listed and included into a rice bag for shipment to IOS laboratories 

in Chicoutimi, Saguenay where the sample is entirely crushed 0 to ¼ inch. An 

approximate split of 1 kg is taken with riffle splitter after crushing and material afterward 

grinded with rotary disc pulverizer to approximately 95% passing 2 mm. This material is 

riffle split and a sample of 200 to 250 grams is bagged for shipping. The sample bags 

where afterward listed and included into a rice bag for shipment to the ALS laboratory. 

The author visited the IOS facility on February 14, 2011 and found the equipment and 

procedures to be adequate in the Lac à Paul context. 

The exploration program, emphasis was on P2O5 and TiO2. And the works mainly aim at 

defining minerals resources of P2O5 and TiO2. All major oxides are analyzed. 

11.1 Sample Preparation at the Laboratory 

IOS Geoscientific Services for Arianne Resources had shipped the samples to ALS 

Chemex laboratory in Val d'Or, Quebec. The following procedures are used either 

separately or combined in a package in order to meet specific sample preparation 

requirements. 

The sample were weighted and afterward pulverized (PUL 31 was used) prior to analysis. 

An excerpt from a typical certificate is given in Table 11.1.

Pulverizing 

All pulverizing procedures make use of "flying disk" or "ring and puck" style grinding 

mills. Unless otherwise indicated, all pulverizing procedures guarantee that for most 

sample types at least 85% of the material will be pulverized to 75 micron (200 mesh) or 

better. 

Table 11.2 – Pulverizing procedure by ALS Chemex Laboratory in Val d'Or 

Arianne Resources Inc. has relied on ALS Chemex as its main laboratory for this project. 

According to the certificates provided by Arianne Resources Inc. the author concludes 

that the analytical results were from the same laboratory batch. Some analytical results 

were presented in oxides while some were expressed by element, in percent or ppm. 

Author's independent samples with SGS laboratory are considered 3
rd

 party. QA/QC 

procedures are presented and discussed in the next section of this report. 

11.2 Bulk sample material used for metallurgical testing 

In the course of the study, Arianne was requested by COREM to provide about eight (8) 

tonnes of representative sample from the Paul zone. The Vice-President of exploration 

from Arianne Mr. Daniel Boulianne Sr. Geologist had elected to use the core coarse 

rejects material. The independent laboratory IOS which had the rejects in storage, sent 

these rejects directly to COREM for a total of 6.36 tonnes. The remaining additional 1.5 

to 1.7 tonnes has been taken from the blasted outcrop near hole PAU-09-18 under IOS 

staff supervision. 

By doing this approach, Arianne has taken adequate step to prepare a representative 

unique composite sample.  

Table 11.3 is an extract of the sample list in Excel worksheet format, of the rejects from 

holes: PAU-09-14 to 22 and PAU-09-24 to 31 that composed the 6.36 tonnes that were 

sent. The remaining 1.7 tonnes had been taken by IOS staff in the field and sent with the 

rejects to COREM with plastic barrels on wooden crates. Drill hole locations are 

presented on Figure 11.1.

house standard gives the average grade of this material. The colour code reflects the 

magnetic signature. 

As a next step, the author recommends that tests on recovery (geometallurgical approach) 

should take place to assess the variability of recovery across each deposit in 3D. 

11.3 Quality control program 

The QC program that was put in place by Arianne Resources Inc. was used in the 2010-

2011 drilling program. Arianne relies on its own program and independent samples taken 

by SGS Geostat as external quality control complete the QC program. 

11.3.1 Paul QAQC-Reliability of results 

The reliability of analytical results in TiO2 and P2O5 from ALS Chemex laboratory has 

been verified. Indeed, 53 blanks and 103 standards were sent to this laboratory. 

The blanks used in this drill program are blocks of quartz from the Siteq quarry at 

St. Francis de Sales. They were brushed and cleaned with oxalic acid before sending 

them for analysis. These rocks show no enrichment in TiO2 and P2O5 known. Values in 

P2O5 and TiO2 are shown in Table 11.4. They vary from 0.01 to 0.21% TiO2 and from 

0.009 to 0.336% P2O5.

In addition, four standards were used to validate the analytical results. There are two 

certified standards the DC79003 and the SY-4, one standard approved, the FER-1, and 

one home made standard the PMRI10. 

The SY-4 standard is certified by CANMET Mining and Mineral CANMET services in 

Ontario. It was used to check the values for P2O5 and TiO2. The certified values are 

0.131% of P2O5 and 0.287% of TiO2.  

The values obtained with the laboratory analysis for this drilling campaign have given 

relative errors ranging from 1.527% to 11.450% for P2O5 and absolute relative errors 

ranging between 1.045% and 5.923% for TiO2. 

The other standard certified, DC 79003, is only valid for P2O5. He is certified by China 

National Analysis Center for Iron and Steel. The standard value is 6.06% for P2O5. The 

values obtained during laboratory tests showed an absolute error that varies from 4.274% 

to 5.099%. The standard FER-1 is prepared by CANMET and is used as material 

reference by the Geological Survey of Canada. Standard values are: 2.39% P2O5 and 

75.86% Fe2O3. The results obtained in laboratory tests show absolute errors ranging from 

0.01% to 4.79% as Fe2O3 and 1.674% to 16.276% P2O5. 

Finally, the standard PMRI 10 is a home made standard that was made with rock from the 

Paul Zone stripping. It is used to check the values P2O5 and TiO2. With the numbers that 

are available today, the average is 10.286% P2O5 (min: 9.175, max: 10.435) with a 

standard deviation of 0.134, and an average of 5.576% TiO2 (min: 5.13, max: 5.54) with 

a standard deviation of 0.044. Using the previous averages, the lab tests show errors 

ranging from 0 to 10.801% P2O5 and 0.073 to 6.318% in TiO2.  

All results of analysis of standards and the percentage of errors in the calibration values 

are presented in Table 11.5 to Table 11.9 on the following pages. Samples of drill hole 

PAU-10-35 and PAU-10-40 were reversed by the laboratory. Analysis of recovery has 

been made. The laboratory confirmed that the samples had been reversed and that the 

good results to be considered are those of the analysis times. The certificates of the first 

analysis and the reanalysis were provided for validation.

11.3.2 Manouane QAQC-Reliability of results 

The reliability of analytical results in TiO2 and P2O5 from ALS Chemex laboratory has 

been verified. Indeed, one hundred three (103) blanks and one hundred seventy nine 

(179) standards were sent to this laboratory. 

The blanks used in this drill program are blocks of quartz from the Siteq quarry at 

St. Francis de Sales. They were brushed and cleaned with oxalic acid before sending 

them for analysis. These rocks show no enrichment in TiO2 and P2O5 known. Values in 

P2O5 and TiO2 are shown in Table 11.10. They vary from 0 to 0.55 % TiO2 and from 0 to 

0.543 % P2O5. 

In holes MAN-11-21 et MAN-11-22, blank samples J414331, J414366 and J414541 were 

reversed by the lab with samples J414330, J414366 and J414540 respectively. The data 

results have been corrected.

In addition, four standards were used to validate the analytical results. There are two 

certified standards the DC79003 and the SY-4, one standard approved, the FER-1, and 

one home made standard the PMRI10. 

The SY-4 standard is certified by CANMET Mining and Mineral CANMET services in 

Ontario. It was used to check the values for P2O5 and TiO2. The certified values are: 

0.131% of P2O5 and 0.287% of TiO2.  

The values obtained with the laboratory analysis for this drilling campaign have given 

relative errors ranging from 1.527% and 4.580% for P2O5 and absolute relative errors 

ranging between 1.045% and 1.045% and 2.439% for TiO2. 

The other certified standard, DC 79003, is only valid for P2O5. It is certified by China 

National Analysis Center for Iron and Steel. The standard value is 6.06% for P2O5. The

values obtained during laboratory tests showed an absolute error that varies from 4.323% 

to 5.033%. 

The standard FER-1 is prepared by CANMET and is used as material reference by the 

Geological Survey of Canada. Standard values are: 2.39% P2O5 and 75.86% Fe2O3. The 

results obtained in laboratory tests show absolute errors ranging from 0.00% to 4.77% for 

Fe2O3 and 3.389% to 15.230% for P2O5. 

Finally, the standard PMRI 10 is a home made standard that was made with rock from the 

Paul Zone stripping. It is used to check the values P2O5 and TiO2. With the numbers that 

are available today, the average is 10.286% P2O5 (min: 9.175, max: 10.435) with a 

standard deviation of 0.134, and an average of 5.576% TiO2 (min: 5.13, max: 5.54) with 

a standard deviation of 0.044. Using the previous averages, the lab tests show errors 

ranging from 0.010 to 0.350% for P2O5 and 0.073 to 1.205% in TiO2. 

All results of analysis of standards and the percentage of errors in the calibration values 

are presented in Table 11.11 to Table 11.14 on the following pages. Samples of drill hole 

MAN-11-17 were reversed by the laboratory. Analyses of recovery have been made. The 

laboratory confirmed that the samples had been reversed and that the good results to be 

considered are those of the last analysis. The certificates of the first analysis and the 

reanalysis were provided for validation. 

Moreover sample J414191 from hole MAN-11-20, supposed to be a FER-1 standard, was 

analyzed as a blank, error in the insertion of standard occurred. This result has been 

removed from the data.

11.3.3 Reliability of results 

Arianne has made the appropriate effort to control the quality of data and analytical 

results reported by ALS laboratory. Controlled deficiencies were addressed and 

corrected. It is the author's opinion that the data use is reliable for the estimation of 

resources.  

11.4 Security 

There are no reasons to believe that the assays or samples were tampered with. In SGS 

Geostat opinion, the work has been done in a professional way. ALS Chemex and 

Arianne Resources geologists and professional team have a good reputation for their 

standard work.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

The author has verified the database assay table against the logs on a random basis and 

did not find major errors. Extensive verification by colleagues of the author took place. 

The collar location, azimuth, dip, holes length, assay values, and assay length were 

checked. Available historical cross sections on paper were reviewed and compared with 

on screen equivalent cross sections. 

Independent samples were taken from witness core holes by the author, Claude Duplessis 

QP. He supervised the preparation and sampling protocol and participated to the sample 

bags sealing and sent them to the SGS Lakefield laboratory facilities. 

No field duplicate was done by the author. SGS check samples for this resource update 

have been done on ¼  witness core, pulp and "crushed" samples. 

12.1 Independent sampling – personal inspection 

The author visited the site and the property in February from the 14 to the 17, 2011. The 

workers live at the Chute des Passes permanent camp during exploration campaigns that 

Arianne has installed (Logging and splitting). The drill cores are cross piles on wood 

palette and were in process to be placed into the core rack behind the office (Photo 12.1 

and Photo 12.2). The site is constantly monitored. 

Drill sites are identified by wooden stick with a number. The author was able to locate 

the drill holes and verify their location using a hand held GPS. The holes that were 

visited had a GPS position consistent with that recorded in the database. SGS is satisfied 

with evidence of exploration on the site and has no reason to doubt the authenticity of 

boreholes. Pictures taken during personal inspection with Arianne exploration staff 

present outside core review set-up (with hole MAN-11-20), core logging and splitting.

The personal inspection is positive; sites were clean and well maintained, organization 

and work process was up to standard and best practices. The site visit took place this way. 

On Monday 14, traveling from Blainville to Saguenay with a meeting at IOS laboratory 

facilities for the presentation of the sample reduction procedures. On Tuesday morning, 

meeting at Arianne's office and traveling to Chute des passes. Site visit at drill site at 

Manouane zone. Quick review of core at mobile core shack installations. On Wednesday, 

core inspection and selection of samples for independent sampling, two holes were 

sampled. Return to Saguenay and meeting at Arianne's office. Thursday, return from 

Saguenay to Blainville. 

The author had already extensively sampled and controlled previous drilling campaigns, 

work focused on new drilling samples. Core witness samples were taken directly while 

sub samples from IOS storage were prepared according to author instruction and sent to 

SGS Blainville. 

Samples were put in plastic bags with sample tag identification and sealed with a tie-

wrap. The samples in plastic bags were put into rice bags with sample numbers on it. The

The crushing and reduction stage at IOS facilities does not create a biais. The samples ½ 

core vs. ¼ core samples show discrepancies. In author opinion with this limited amount 

of samples we cannot say there is a problem. The discrepancy may come from different 

sample size or a physical error in sampling by the author. The sign-test is OK. The 

control data done by the author with the core, crushed material and pulp show that results 

in the database are reproducible and reliable for resources. 

12.2 Pulp duplicate verification 

Laboratory duplicates have been verified by SGS personnel under author supervision. 

Results for P2O5 and TiO2 were reviewed. The analysis of the pulps is reliable and 

repeatable as shown in the following graphics for Manouane and Paul.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Introduction 

Preliminary metallurgical investigation for the Lac à Paul deposit was first carried out in 

2008 by SGS
1
. 

In 2011, COREM was mandated to carry out testwork to establish physical and 

mineralogical properties of Paul zone ore and assess flotation parameters at laboratory 

scale as well as pilot plant scale.  

More recently, COREM was requested in spring of 2012 to investigate the potential of 

processing ilmenite and magnetite as by-products of the apatite process: 

• Evaluate the possibility of generating an ilmenite concentrate from the apatite head 

samples and from process tailings. See section 13.3.1. 

• Verify if the magnetite concentrate generated from the apatite process flowsheet 

can be upgraded to commercial value. See section 13.3.2. 

The sections below summarize previous testwork and introduce results from the recent 

spring 2012 testwork that was recently requested from COREM.   

13.2 Previous Testwork Summary 

13.2.1 SGS 2008 Testwork 

The main objective of SGS's 2008 metallurgical test program was to assess the 

concentrate quality of the apatite. Some results are referenced in Section 13.2.2. 

SGS Lakefield's report was first referenced in a previous NI 43-101 Technical Report 

and the complete testwork report can be found in Appendix 1 of the SGS Geostat Ltd 

report entitled: "Technical Report Phosphate and Titanium resource estimation of the Lac 

à Paul property deposit, dated May 8, 2009". 

13.2.2 COREM 2011 Testwork 

COREM was mandated in 2011 to carry out ore characterization and variability, 

mineralogical analysis, laboratory bench scale flotation testing and pilot flotation testing 

on a sample from the Paul Zone deposit.  

Additional grinding and flotation test work at bench scale were performed on three 

samples from Paul zone and Manouane zone. The objective was to test recovery of Paul 

zone at a lower grade and obtain preliminary indications for the Manouane zone. 

The tasks were to be done in conjunction with the generation of apatite concentrate for 

the Paul zone. COREM was also to test the effect of inserting magnetic separation at 

either the grind mill discharge or the discharge of the flotation concentrate. 

Results and findings are summarized in the following.

a) Sample Preparation 

Of the original Paul zone's 8,160 kg sample, 7,960 kg was set aside for the pilot 

plant, 15 kg was used for ball mill Work index testing, 60 kg was separated into 

2 kg bags for lab testing and the remaining 125 kg was kept for characterization 

and/or kept aside.  

Figure 13.1 – Diagram of T1225 sample preparation 

b) Ore characterization and Variability 

The size distribution of the -1.7 mm material was measured along with a size-by-

size assay. It was seen that P2O5 tends to concentrate in the finer size fractions as 

opposed to its main gangue component SiO2, which reports a higher grade in the 

coarser size fractions. This indicates that P2O5 is reduced in size preferentially than 

its harder gangue components. 

Table 13.1 shows the material properties of the -1.7 mm material.

c) Work Index Determination 

Bond Ball & Rod mill work index testing and crushing work index were performed 

on drill cores with different apatite grades from different location within the deposit 

(low, medium and high at 3.9, 7.21 and 10.4 % P2O5 respectfully) as well as a 

sample with a high ilmenite grade but low apatite grade (0.46 % P2O5 and 9.93 % 

TiO2). There is a direct link between apatite grade with low, medium and high 

grades reporting Ball mill work indexes of 14.80, 11.60 and 10.30 kWh/tonne 

respectfully. The same relation apply for Rod mill and crushing work index. The 

bulk sample used in the pilot plant had a similar grade to the medium (7.8% P2O5) 

and had a similar work index of 12.27 kWh/tonne. These results demonstrate how 

apatite is much more amenable to grinding then the other mineral components. This 

coincides with the mineralogical analysis which showed the size distribution of the 

apatite was finer than the entire sample size distribution.

d) Mineralogical analysis 

A mineralogical analysis was performed. Apatite was measured at 18% w/w, the 

main gangue minerals are the ferrous: magnetite (12.2% w/w); ilmenite 

(14.0% w/w); pyroxene (15.1 % w/w); and the micas: chlorite (14.7% w/w) and 

phlogopite (6.2% w/w). No Rare Earth Element (RRE) bearing minerals were 

indicated in the analysis.   

The sample submitted for analysis was highly liberated (> 95%). Preliminary 

observations place the liberation of apatite around -150 m to +75 m. Apatite is 

seen to have an association with ilmenite, which contaminates the apatite as 

globular inclusions.  

e) Magnetite Removal 

Magnetic separation was applied pre-flotation via a hand magnet. The removal of 

ferrous bearing minerals was promising with the grade of the magnetic concentrate 

ranging from 64.5 to 72.1% and a recovery of 24.3 to 27.6%. There were minimal 

losses to overall apatite recovery as the amount of apatite in magnetic concentrate 

ranged from 1.7 to 3.3% w/w of the plant feed apatite. The mass split of the test 

material that reported to magnetic separation concentrate ranged from 9.0 to 

11.3% w/w. Overall; the magnetic separation achieved prior to flotation was not 

changed with a grind time greater than 16.5 minutes.  

f) Laboratory bench scale flotation 

The following bench scale flotation conditions were varied to search for optimized 

testing conditions: 

• Rougher Flotation Time; 

• Na2SiO3 dosage in Rougher/Scavenger; 

• Na2SiO3 and WW82 dosages in 1
st
 cleaner; 

• Percent solids on apatite flotation performance; 

• Effect of pH on rougher-scavenger performance; 

• Optimized bench open circuit test; 

• Locked cycle bench test. 

Rougher flotation time was tested for 7 values and COREM chose 4 minutes 

suitable retention time for roughers.

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

The depressant for silicates and aluminates (sodium silicate or Na2SiO3) had its 

dosage varied in the rougher and the scavenger in order to improve concentrate 

grade. The dosage of 200/70 and 400/130 g/tonne (rougher dosage/scavenger 

dosage) improved the grade (21.40 and 24.43 % respectfully) without sacrificing 

recovery (96.2% in both tests). 

Concentrations of the silicates/aluminates depressant (sodium silicate or Na2SiO3) 

and the iron depressant (caustic starch or WW82) were varied in the 1st cleaner in 

order to improve concentrate grade. COREM chose 1
st
 cleaner concentration ranges 

of 400-450 g/tonne Na2SiO3 and 100 to 150 g/tonne WW82. 

The effect of conditioning percent solids on flotation response was investigated 

with two tests. The higher pulp density conditioning resulted in better recoveries for 

the rougher/scavenger. COREM recommended higher pulp density for flotation 

feed conditioning. 

The pH for the rougher – scavenger was tested at 9.5, 10.0, 10.5 and 11.0. Results 

show higher grades and recoveries for pH values 10.5 and 11.0. Grade dropped 

from 31.9 to 18.0 % with the corresponding pH values of 10.5 to 10.0 respectfully. 

Open circuit tests were performed using conditions determined by COREM to be 

optimum for both grade and recovery of apatite. Table 13.4 describes the reagent 

consumption used for Test 7.1. The objective of grade and recovery (>38% and 

>90% respectfully) were met with cleaner 2 concentrate reporting a recovery of 

83.63% and a grade of 40.20%.

g) Pilot testing 

Pilot plant testing for producing apatite concentrate was broken into two separate 

plants: grinding with magnetic separation and apatite flotation. The main objective 

was to produce as much qualified apatite concentrate as possible. 

• Grinding – magnetic separation 

A ball mill is fed with a P80 feed of 3.9 mm. The discharge is fed to a multi-

feed derrick screen (with a screen opening of 212 µm). Screen undersize is fed 

to a light intensity drum magnet. The non-magnetic fraction was dried and 

homogenized and separated in small samples and fed to the apatite flotation 

circuit. The final grinding-magnetic circuit product size target was a P80 of 

146 µm. 

• Grinding feed rate 

Four grinding feed rates were tested. When the different grinding products 

were combined, the composite P80 was measured to be 138 µm (a much finer 

distribution then the 146 µm goal).

Figure 13.2 shows how when the sample is ground to a distribution, the 

apatite mineral has a finer distribution (the curve lies above the cum. mass % 

curve). Therefore, when the sample is ground too fine, the apatite is ground to 

an even greater degree. Minerals that are too finely ground will not be 

recovered easily during flotation of oxide without having an impact on 

concentrate grade and can result in poor flotation results.  

Figure 13.2 – Size Distribution Results 

• Optimization of magnetite removal 

Two light intensity magnetic drums were used. The first drum was set to a 

field intensity of 1000 Gauss was a rougher, while the second, with a field 

intensity of 800 gauss, served as the cleaner. It was found that approximately 

10% of the feed mass reported to the magnetic concentrate. It was found that 

1.6% of the apatite mass was lost to the magnetic fraction. The magnetite was 

seen to be very fine <50m and therefore not fully liberated, leading 

impurities in the magnetic concentrate.   

• Apatite flotation 

Circuit setup was adjusted during the pilot plant. The changes were: 

 A smaller conditioning tank was inserted at the head of the circuit as the 
larger 2100-L tank was thought to be causing shearing and the fine

particles produced were 'sliming' the flotation feed, reducing the plant 

operation. 

 Three cleaner stages were used instead of two. 

 The circuit was run without recirculation streams until June 2, 2011. 

 The 1st cleaner tails reported to final tails as opposed to rougher feed, as 
the initial setup dictated.  

After initial adjustments to the pilot plant produced unsatisfactory results, the 

pilot plant feed was fed to bench testing using the conditions which had 

provided the best results. Table 13.7 shows how the pilot plant feed does not 

exhibit the same grade and recovery as the prior bench scale test. The 

suspected reason is that the feed size distribution was too fine.

The May 31 pilot plant was run without recirculation. The best results 

obtained were with a grade and recovery of 32.40% P2O5 and 78.2% 

respectively. 

Due to pilot plant concentrates' low grade, further upgrading was required to 

produce a sample for phosphoric acid production testing (testing performed at 

the Jacobs facility, Florida). High depressant dosages with long residence time 

produced 218 kg of concentrate with a grade of 39.1 % P2O5.  

• Sedimentation testing 

Static settling tests were performed for both the pilot plant concentrate and 

tailings. Reagents used were CaCl2 and Magnafloc 358 (at 1.5 mg/L and 

10 g/t respectfully). 

• Filtration tests 

Larox pressure filter testing was performed on the pilot plant concentrate. 

Cake and filtrate flux velocities were determined for all the different tests as 

well as the resulting cake moisture content.

h) Additional flotation test work for Paul and Manouane zones 

Three samples were tested for grinding and flotation: Paul Zone Low Grade; 

Manouane Low Grade; Manouane Low Grade. Samples were ground to a P80 of 

150 m.  

Although all three samples had lower head grades (5.63, 4.83 and 5.99% P2O5) then 

the bulk sample used for project T1225 (7.74 % P2O5) the rougher + scavenger 

concentrates showed similar recoveries (94.27% in Project T1225's test 7.1 versus 

93.75 to 95.75%) for similar rougher + scavenger concentrate grade. It is hence 

expected that final concentrate grade and recoveries will also be similar to those 

obtain from Paul's bulk sample head grade. 

i) Analytical Method 

COREM has used the following analytical methods: 

• For elements: SiO2, AL2O3, MgO, CaO, K2O, TiO2, MnO, P2O5, Co, 

Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, S, Zn. Chemical preparation: Fusion with a mix of 

lithium metaborate and lithium tetraborate. (Fluorescence X). 

• For elements (rock): SiO2, AL2O3, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, TiO2, MnO, 

P2O5, Nb2O5, ZrO2, Ta2O5, BaO, Y2O3, SrO, ThO2, Ce2O3,  La2O3, 

Nd2O3: Fusion with a mix of lithium metaborate and lithium tetraborate. 

(Fluorescence X). 

• For fluoride, Chemical preparation: Alkaline fusion using specific 

electrode. 

• For chloride, Chemical preparation: Alkaline fusion using colorimetry. 

j) Final Results & Interpretation 

The objective of achieving an apatite concentrate with grade > 38% and recovery > 

90% P2O5 was achieved for both the bench scale lab work and the locked cycle 

tests. The pilot plant results did not reproduce the batch or lock cycle results in a 

satisfactory manner and results are poor due to two factors: over grinding of the 

feed and over-dosage of Na2SiO3.  

However, it is expected that with a suitable grind and proper depressant dosages, 

flotation performance of both the batch test (Test 7.1) and the lock cycle test (see 

Table 13.8) will be obtained.  

The project plant design is based on a concentrate grade of 38% P2O5 and a 90% 

recovery.

13.3 Spring 2012 Testwork Update and Results 

13.3.1 Ilmenite Concentration Tests 

In order to evaluate the feasibility of upgrading ilmenite to produce a saleable 

concentrate, COREM was mandated to conduct a series of ilmenite concentration tests 

and develop a process flowsheet.  

The Paul ore was subjected to a liberation study, gravity separation, magnetic separation 

and flotation tests. 

When the testwork campaign was initiated, the ilmenite separation circuit was located 

ahead of the apatite concentration circuit and therefore tests were carried out on a head 

sample. However, as test results started to be available it became clear that the ilmenite 

circuit should be relocated after the apatite flotation circuit in order to minimize apatite 

losses. Apatite flotation tailings from the previous testwork campaign were retrieved and 

subjected to concentration tests. 

Key findings from the testwork carried out on the head sample and on the apatite tailings 

sample have been reported by COREM and are described below.  

a) Mineralogical Analysis 

A mineralogy study was performed to determine the ilmenite liberation size. The 

head sample was screened into 6 size fractions and analyzed using scanning 

electron microscope and optical microscope. 

Results showed that complete ilmenite liberation is achieved at 75 microns. 

b) Grinding Curve 

Grinding curves were established for the head sample and the apatite flotation 

tailings sample. A grinding time of 71 minutes was required to achieve a P80 of 

75 microns on the head sample while an 18 minutes grinding time achieved a P80 

of 82 microns on the apatite flotation tailings. 

c) Gravity Concentration Tests 

A Wilfley table was used to determine the potential use of gravity separation to 

concentrate ilmenite. The tests were conducted on the head sample. 

The results showed that a 37.0% TiO2 concentrate grade could be achieved but the 

recovery was poor (below 30.0%). It was found that pyroxenes are one of the main

  July 2012

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

impurities recovered in the ilmenite concentrate. Pyroxenes' small difference in 

specific gravity with apatite and ilmenite made their separation difficult. 

d) Magnetic Concentration Tests 

Magnetic separation tests were carried out on a head sample to concentrate 

ilmenite. A wet high intensity magnetic separator (WHIMS) was used to produce 

concentrates at 100, 150, 4000, 6000, 8000 and 11000 Gauss from the head sample. 

A semi-industrial WHIMS was also used on the apatite tailings sample at a 

maximum intensity of 10000 Gauss.  

i) Magnetic Concentration Tests on Head Sample 

Magnetic separation yielded a lower TiO2 grade (16.5% TiO2) than gravity 

separation but the recovery was high at 84.0%. Magnetic separation is more 

appropriate than gravity concentration as a pre-concentration process in order to 

minimize apatite losses. 

ii) Magnetic Concentration Tests on Apatite Flotation Tailings 

The apatite flotation tailings were ground to a P80 of 75 microns and subjected to 

magnetic separation in a high intensity SLon separator (semi-industrial). Compared 

to magnetic separation testing on the head sample, the weight recovery and the 

TiO2 recovery are higher. An 88.6% TiO2 recovery was achieved at an 11.5% TiO2 

grade. 

A comparison between magnetic and gravity separation results tests on the head 

sample is available in Figure 13.3.

e) Flotation Tests 

A series of flotation tests were carried out on magnetic concentrates from the head 

sample and the apatite flotation tailings sample. The objective was to determine 

main flotation parameters and reagent scheme in order to reach a 44.0% TiO2 

concentrate. 

i) Flotation Tests on Head Sample 

Initial tests on the head sample provided some indications on reagent selection. 

Ferrous pyroxenes could not be floated by silicate collectors and were floated by 

the same collectors as ilmenite. Results were not conclusive in terms of recovery. 

Efforts were redirected on floating ilmenite from the apatite flotation tailings 

magnetic concentrate. 

ii) Flotation Tests on Apatite Flotation Tailings Sample 

A series of tests were carried out on the apatite flotation tailings. The best results 

were achieved in test 13 where a 44.9% TiO2 concentrate was obtained at a 61.7% 

recovery. 

In the rougher stage, silicates were depressed by lowering the pH to 2-2.5 using 

sulfuric acid. Oxalic acid was added to depress pyroxenes and the collector mix 

(SM15. Aero 845 and Aero 825) helped minimize entrainment. 

In the cleaner stages, the pH was decreased to 1.5-1.9 using sulfuric acid to depress 

remaining ferrous pyroxenes. Acidity control was a key operating parameter 

because it was found that ilmenite was depressed at a pH below 1.5. 

Additional flotation tests were carried out without prior magnetic separation to try 

increasing the overall ilmenite recovery. However, flotation selectivity was low due 

to the presence of micas. 

f) Flowsheet Determination 

Based on the testwork results the following flowsheet (refer to Figure 13.4) was 

developed to a Scoping Study level of cost estimate in order to evaluate its 

potential.

Figure 13.3 – Conceptual Flowsheet for Ilmenite Concentration 

g) Conclusions & Recommendations 

Ilmenite overall recovery is 51.5% with a concentrate grade of 44.9% TiO2. 

Flotation recovery is 61.7%. 

The ilmenite concentration process includes two (2) rougher stages, one (1) 

scavenger and two (2) cleaners. 

The collector consumption is 450 g/t while oxalic acid is used at 125 g/t and 

sulfuric acid at 1 to 2.5 kg/t. 

13.3.2 Magnetite Concentration Tests 

In order to evaluate the feasibility of upgrading magnetite to produce a saleable 

concentrate, COREM was mandated to conduct a series of magnetite concentration tests. 

Mineralogical analysis and magnetic separation tests were carried out. Magnetite 

liberation reached 94.0% in the minus 75 microns size fraction. Davis tube tests were 

performed at 300, 450 and 700 Gauss. A maximum of 62.0% Fe in the concentrate was 

achieved. 

The mineralogical study has shown that a 65.0% Fe concentrate could not be produced 

due to very small ilmenite inclusions (less than 2 microns), thus preventing the complete 

liberation of magnetite.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

This section presents the modelling of the Paul, Manouane and number 2 zones followed 

by the resource estimates. 

14.1 Data used 

The final drill hole database used for the resource estimation of the Lac à Paul Project 

zones namely Zone 2, Paul and Manouane is in file LAC_PAUL_260711_final.accdb 

dated July 27, 2011. The database holds information for 121 diamond drill holes. Out of 

the hundred and twenty-one (121) holes, thirteen (13) are not used in the resource 

estimates: the two (2) 1997 holes and the eleven (11) exploration holes of LPA-09 group. 

The surface samples are not integrated into the database at the moment. The location of 

this data on maps is in 2D, i.e.: no elevation and they are therefore not equivalent to core 

holes samples. They are not used in the estimation of resources. 

A database in MS-Excel format has been transferred to SGS Geostat from the client. SGS 

Geostat has imported and validated the database into GEOBASE and it was also cross 

checked with the laboratory certificates. 

It is to be noted that the reader is advised that Arianne Resources Inc. has announced  

results of the 2011 Fall Drilling Campaign and Winter 2012 which are not included in 

the estimation of resources presented in this Technical Report with effective date of 

November 8
th

 2011. Drilling is actually ongoing and an updated resources estimate 

should be made available with the Feasibility Study. 

It is in the author's opinion that these results increase the lateral extension of the Paul 

Zone near the surface. The new Nicole Zone with its drilling results show potential for a 

near future mineral resource estimate. 

14.1.1 Computerized drill hole database used for resources 

• The database has information for 121 drill holes from the entire Lac à Paul property 

main block; 

• The total drill holes length in the database is 20,557 meters; 

• There are 6,544 assay records for % P2O5, % TiO2, % SiO2, % Fe2O3, % AL2O3, 

% CaO, % K2O, % Na2O, % MnO and % MgO; 

• There are 258 deviation record; 

• There are 2675 lithology records; 

• There are no RDQ records.

14.1.2 Topographic survey 

The topography used is the same as the one used in 2009 where Arianne had contracted 

an independent surveyor to survey topography with a differential GPS along the lines in 

order to be able to have a representative and adequate surface for resource calculation. 

Each zone has a local field line grid; however UTM NAD 83 is used as coordinate 

system. 

The resource model uses the UTM NAD 83 system and the surveyed topography model. 

SGS Geostat recommendation for the next step is to proceed with a detailed airborne 

LIDAR survey of all the areas of interest in 2012. 

14.1.3 Mineralized envelope modelling approach 

In order to adequately define the mineralized envelopes, a mineralized solid is defined 

using geological description and grade information along the drill hole core. 

The mineralized envelopes are built on sections and are subsequently connected and 

sliced on levels. The interpretation of the mineralized structures (Nelsonite mass with 

enriched Apatite content) was made by Claude Duplessis geological engineer and Senior 

QP for the Paul and Zone 2, while Manouane has been done by Guy Desharnais Ph. D. P. 

Geo., QP under Claude Duplessis' supervision. 

Survey topography and overburden thickness are taken into account in the calculation of 

mineralized solids.  

In SGS Geostat's mineralized envelope interpretation the following Zones were studied 

respectively: 

• Paul (PAU) Zone centered on 375141.90E, 5529452.00N; 

• Manouane (MAN) Zone centered on 381327.00E, 5527408.00N;

• Zone 2 centered on 366947.96E, 5516273.78N. 

The following sections present for each Zone, the interpretation on sections, mineralized 

intersections, composites, estimation parameters and block models. This information is 

followed by classification and tabulation of mineral resource statements. 

14.2 Paul Zone 

A set of cross sections have been developed with the new drilling information. 

Interpretation of the Nelsonite bodies has been done on cross sections. Following a first 

interpretation on cross-sections, the interpretation has been revised with control level 

plans. The relatively rich TiO2 layer observed on the north side of the zone with very low 

P2O5 is still used to assist in the interpretation and extensions. Once interpretation makes 

sense, the prism on sections are linked together to create a solid. Extremities of solids are 

completed with stumps prior to meshing. The North- south cross sections spacing ranges 

from 65 m to 115 m apart, and is in general 90 meters. The overburden-bedrock contact 

has been interpreted on each cross section.

Mineralized intersections are that part of drill holes samples inside the interpreted limits 

of mineralized zones. Most intersections in drill holes are complete (start and end points 

at the zone limits). 

A total of 41 intersections have been defined from the holes, some holes having 

intersected more than one zone and some are not crossing the zone. Holes not listed in the 

sequences did not cut the apatite zone. 

Table 14.1 is the list of the intersection limit file used for the creation of standard length 

composites. This is with dilution of gaps. 

Drilling results and database of the fall of 2011 drilling program on Paul Zone was not

14.2.2 Compositing of assay intervals within mineralized intercepts 

Since original assay intervals do not have all the same length, it is necessary to 

standardize the length of the grade "support" through numerical compositing before 

assigning grades to dimensionless "points" in the 3D space (the composite centers) in the 

block grade interpolation.

The majority of assay intervals have a length of 1.5 m and 3 meters. The selectivity of 

1.5 m is not commonly achievable in bulk tonnage mining; therefore a 3 m standard 

length has been elected. This also allows for internal smoothing and internal dilution, 

since it could be difficult and unrealistic in the Lac à Paul context to exclude dykes and 

barren inclusions of smaller dimension within a blast. The material not analyzed is 

considered barren with 0% P2O5 and 0% TiO2. 

No capping on grade is done; from our point of view it is not necessary due to the nature 

of mineralization. 

Compositing is done down hole from the start of mineralized intercepts. Missing assays 

are assumed to be zero grade. At the end of the mineralized intercepts, the last composite 

kept is the one with at least a 1.5 meter length. It is important to mention that only 

composites within the envelope and its vicinity have been used to estimate the 

mineralized zones.  The composites are calculated from original uncapped samples. 

14.2.3 Specific gravity data 

Based on previous SG measurements of core, the specific gravity value used to convert 

volumes into tonnes was set to a conservative fixed value of 3.42 t/m
3
 for Paul zone. 

Additional SG measurements should be done in the next phase of drilling in order to 

derive ideally a regression based on variable SG. The challenge is that SG is not 100% 

dependent of apatite content, iron and titanium but it is also affected by low SG minerals. 

14.2.4 Resource block grade interpolation 

Estimations are done with SGS Geostat SECTCAD plus which includes SGS Geostat 

BLKCAD block modelling and resource estimation software. 

The grades are estimated in each 10 m (EW) x 10 m (NS) x 10 m (Z) block of a regular 

matrix of 171 columns (EW), 101 rows (NS) and 66 benches (Z) with its center within 

the limits of the mineralized zones. A total of 2,256 composites (data points representing 

3 meters) were used to estimate the blocks. The block model is cut by overburden\rock 

surface and the topography.  

The average %P2O5 and % TiO2 grade of each block is interpolated by inverse of the 

distance from the grades of nearby 3 m composites.  

The author has used interpolation parameters based on drill spacing, envelope extension 

and orientation. 

For the interpolation process, estimation was made with one run. 

A search ellipse of 350 m, 150 m, 75 m maximum composite 10, minimum of 2, 

maximum from same hole is 4. With long axis North 112 degrees and now sub vertical 

90 degrees.

14.2.5 Resource Categories 

An assessment of the grade continuity was undertaken to establish the drill spacing 

necessary to attain a measured, indicated or inferred level of confidence.  

The author has observed that a range of 150 m for % P2O5 provides some evidence that 

this drill spacing has meaningful information about the grade in the intervening distance.

A first pass of automatic classification was done using an anisotropic search ellipsoid for 

the Measured category (60 m long axis) and then for the Indicated category (120 m long 

axis), the rest within the envelope was classified as Inferred category. Figure 14.9 and 

Figure 14.10 present the effective search ellipsoid orientation and size.

The following figures present bench plans with blocks colour coded by class. 

The block model was provided to Met-Chem to be used for the estimate of the Mineral 

Reserves. The results of the pit optimization showed that there were blocks of inferred 

resources within the pit shell. These blocks were a result of the automatic classification 

that required two holes in the ellipse creating thin slices and small patches within the pit, 

due to a not exact regular grid. Since this material falls within the economic pit limits, the 

inferred blocks within the pit were reclassified as indicated.

14.2.6 Mineral Resource Statement 

Mineral resources for the Lac à Paul zone were estimated by using a 2.43% P2O5 cut-off 

grade. At this base case cut-off, the Paul Zone hosts a Measured Resource of 22.1 million 

tonnes grading 6.82% P2O5, an Indicated Resource of 161.8 million tonnes grading 

7.10% P2O5 and an additional Inferred Resource of 50.3 million tonnes grading 

6.61% P2O5. The mineral resource estimates are outlined in the table below. Results are 

presented as in-situ. There are no known factors or issues related to permitting, legal, 

mineral title, taxation, socioeconomic or political relations that could materially affect the 

mineral resource estimate. Potential modifying factors regarding marketing are discussed 

in the Market study section.

14.3.1 Mineralized intersections 

Mineralized intersections are that part of drill holes samples inside the interpreted limits 

of mineralized zones. Most intersections in drill holes are complete (start and end points 

at the zone limits). 

A total of 41 intersections have been defined from the holes, some holes having 

intersected more than one zone and some are not crossing the zone. Holes not listed in the 

sequences did not cut the apatite zone. 

The following table is the list of the intersection limit file used for the creation of 

standard length composites. This is with dilution of gaps.

be difficult and unrealistic in the Lac à Paul context to exclude dykes and barren 

inclusions of smaller dimension within a blast. The material not analyzed is considered 

barren with 0% P2O5 and 0% TiO2. 

No capping on grade is done; from our point of view it is not necessary due to the nature 

of mineralization. 

Compositing is done down hole from the start of mineralized intercepts. Missing assays 

are assumed to be zero grade. At the end of the mineralized intercepts, the last composite 

kept is the one with at least a 1.5 meter length. It is important to mention that only 

composites within the envelope and its vicinity have been used to estimate the 

mineralized zones. The composites are calculated from original uncapped samples. 

14.3.3 Specific gravity data 

Based on previous SG measurements of core, the specific gravity value used to convert 

volumes into tonnes was set to a conservative fixed value of 3.42 t/m
3
 for Manouane 

zone. Additional SG measurements should be done in the next phase of drilling in order 

to derive ideally a regression based on variable SG. The challenge is that SG is not 100% 

dependent of apatite content, iron and titanium but it is also affected by low SG minerals. 

14.3.4 Resource block grade interpolation 

Estimations are done with SGS Geostat SECTCAD plus which includes SGS Geostat 

BLKCAD block modelling and resource estimation software. 

The grades are estimated in each 10 m (EW) x 10 m (NS) x 10 m (Z) block of a regular 

matrix of 131 columns (EW), 101 rows (NS) and 51 benches (Z) with its center within 

the limits of the mineralized zones. A total of 4,411 composites (data points representing 

3 meters) were used to estimate the blocks. The block model is cut by overburden\rock 

surface. The Manouane zone does not outcrop.  

The average %P2O5 and % TiO2 grade of each block is interpolated by inverse of the 

distance from the grades of nearby 3 m composites.  

The author has used interpolation parameters based on drill spacing, envelope extension 

and orientation.

The grades of all P2O5 and TiO2 were interpolated by inverse square distance method. 

The mineral resources were estimated using SectCad software. Results from the drilling 

of winter 2011 were used for the resource estimation; even though sparse and shallow 

historic drilling is present in around the Manouane Zone. In the estimation process, a 

maximum number of composite to use by hole is 4, maximum per block is 10 and 

minimum number is 4.  

Three successively larger search ellipses were used for the interpolation  

Blocks that were interpolated from an earlier pass were not re-interpolated. Inverse 

square of the distance was used to interpolate the grade within each block.

14.3.5 Resource Categories 

An assessment of the grade continuity was undertaken to establish the drill spacing 

necessary to reach a measured, indicated or inferred level of confidence.  

The author has observed that a range of 150 m for %P2O5 provides some evidence that 

drill spacing has meaningful information about the grade in the intervening distance 

Three ellipsoids were used (previous table) for the estimation and they were also been 

used for the automatic classification. For the Measured category, 60 meters; for the 

Indicated category, 120 meters and 150 meters major axis was used for the Inferred 

category.

14.3.6 Mineral Resource Statement 

Mineral resources for the Lac à Paul Manouane zone were estimated by using a 

2.43% P2O5 cut-off grade. This is the economic cut-off grade calculated by Met-Chem. 

At this base case cut-off, the Manouane Zone hosts a Measured Resource of 

136.9 million tonnes grading 5.93% P2O5 and an Indicated Mineral Resource of 

26.9 million tonnes grading 5.64% P2O5. The mineral resource estimates are outlined in 

the table below. Results are presented as in-situ. There are no known factors or issues 

related to permitting, legal, mineral title, taxation, socioeconomic or political relations 

that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate. Potential modifying factors 

regarding marketing are discussed in the Market study section.

15.1 Block Model 

As previously indicated, in Pre-Feasibility Study dated December 22, 2011, the  

3-Dimensional Geological Block Models for the Paul and Manouane deposits were 

supplied to Met-Chem by SGS Canada Inc. in the form of comma delimited text files. 

The block models are composed of blocks that are 10 m x 10 m x 10 m high. Met-Chem 

imported this information into MineSight® Version 6.10, creating a 3-Dimensional mine 

planning block model for each deposit.  

SGS supplied a topographic surface for each deposit as well as the overburden contact. 

This information was used by Met-Chem to calculate the amount of overburden 

contained within each block. Overburden is defined as loose sand and gravels that can be 

excavated without the need for drilling and blasting. 

The mineral resources for the Paul and Manouane deposits were verified using Met-

Chem's mine planning block model. The results matched SGS's resource estimate, thus 

validating the block model import. 

15.2 Pit Optimization 

Open pit optimization was conducted on the Paul and Manouane deposits to determine 

the economic pit limits. The optimization was carried out during the initial stage of the 

Project using cost, sales price and pit and plant operating parameters that were identified 

in the Scoping Study from 2010. The pit optimization was re-evaluated after a 

preliminary mine plan was completed and the cost, sales price and pit and plant operating 

parameters were better defined. 

The pit optimization was done using the Economic Planner optimizer of MineSight®. 

The optimizer operates on a net value calculation for all the blocks in the model, i.e. 

revenue from sales of apatite concentrate less operating cost. The formula is presented 

below: 

• Concentrate Tonnage = Ore Tonnage x Recovery x Grade of Feed / Concentrate 

Grade; 

• Revenue = Concentrate Tonnage x Sales Price; 

• Net Value = Revenue – (Mining Cost + Processing Cost + Transportation Cost + 

General & Administration Cost). 

In order to comply with the guidelines of the NI 43-101 on Standards of Disclosure for 

Mineral Projects, only ore blocks classified in the measured and indicated categories 

were allowed to drive the pit optimizer. Inferred Resource blocks were treated as waste, 

bearing no economic value. For the Paul deposit, a constraint was added to the 

optimization to ensure that the pit limit remains a minimum 75 m from the lakes to the 

North.

15.2.1 Pit Optimization Parameters 

The following section discusses the pit optimization parameters that were used to define 

the economic pit limits. The parameters are based on results from the preliminary mine 

plan that was developed during the Project. 

Mining Cost – The mining cost used in the analysis was 2.00 US$/t for ore and waste at 

Paul and 3.25 US$/t at Manouane. The increased cost at Manouane reflects the longer 

haul to the crusher. These costs represent the drilling, blasting, loading and hauling of 

material as well as road maintenance, dewatering and other services associated with the 

mining operation. A cost of 1.75 US$/t for overburden was used at Paul and 1.95 US$/t at 

Manouane. The overburden cost is lower since no drilling and blasting is required. 

Processing Cost – A cost of 8.33 US$/t was used for crushing and processing the ore to 

produce the concentrate product. 

Concentrate Transport Cost – A cost of 11.00 US$/t of concentrate was used for the 

transportation of the concentrate from the plant to the rail facility in Dolbeau/Mistassini. 

This cost reflects trucking the concentrate as well as road maintenance. 

General, Administration and Infrastructure Cost – A cost of 5.85 US$/t of 

concentrate was used to represent general, administration and infrastructure costs. This 

cost is associated with support functions such as purchasing and warehousing, 

accounting, environmental management, health and safety, human resources, insurance 

and general management. 

Sales Price – A sales price of 175 US$/t of concentrate was used for this analysis. This 

price is discussed in further detail in Section 19 of this report. 

Plant Recovery – The plant recovery used in the pit optimization is based on 

metallurgical testwork that was carried out by Corem during this Study. Table 15.2 and 

Table 15.3 present the recoveries for each deposit. These recoveries assume a concentrate 

product with an average grade of 38% P2O5.

15.2.2 Cut-off Grade 

Using the economic parameters presented above, Met-Chem calculated a cut-off grade of 

2.43% P2O5 for Paul and Manouane. The cut-off grade is used to determine whether the 

material being mined will generate a profit after paying for the processing, transportation 

and G&A costs. Material that is mined below the cut-off grade is sent to the waste dump. 

15.2.3 Pit Optimization Results 

The pit optimization identified an economic resource of 173.4 Mt of ore for the Paul 

deposit with a P2O5 grade of 7.10%. A total of 163.9 Mt of waste is included in this pit 

resulting in a waste to ore stripping ratio of 0.9:1. The economic resource for the 

Manouane deposit is 153.5 Mt of ore with a P2O5 grade of 5.94%. A total of 73.1 Mt of 

waste is included in this pit resulting in a waste to ore stripping ratio of 0.4:1.

The pit optimization does not account for dilution and ore loss and does not provide an 

access ramp into the pit. These issues are discussed in the Mine Design Section (16.2) of 

this report. Figure 15.2 and Figure 15.3 present the pit optimization results for the Paul 

and Manouane deposits.

Upon completion of the Pre-Feasibility Study, Met-Chem confirmed that the pit 

optimization exercise was still valid using the updated cost estimate developed in the 

Study. 

15.3 Pit Design 

The Paul and Manouane pit designs were completed using the following parameters: 

• Overall Pit slope — 50°; 

• Overburden Density – 2.00 t/m
3
 (In-situ dry); 

• Waste Density – 2.91 t/m
3
 (In-situ dry); 

• Ore Density – 3.42 t/m
3
 (In-situ dry); 

• Mining losses - a 2% ore loss is assumed for both Paul and Manouane pit designs. 

These parameters are discussed in further detail in Section 16. 

The pit that has been designed for the Paul deposit is approximately 1,500 m long and 

700 m wide at surface with a maximum pit depth of 340 m. The total surface area of the 

pit is roughly 0.7 km
2
. The overburden thickness averages 5.2 m with a range of 1 m to 

15 m. As a result of the ramp design, the pit limit approaches the corner of a lake. This 

should be revisited in the Feasibility stage to ensure a minimum offset of 75 m from the 

lake. 

The ramp accesses the pit at the 440 m elevation in the Southeast corner. The ramp 

descends down the western wall and has a switch back at the 355 m elevation. The ramp 

switches back once again at the 185 m and 155 m elevations and is developed as a slot 

until the pit bottom at the 115 m elevation. 

The pit that has been designed for the Manouane deposit is approximately 1,200 m long 

and 600 m wide at surface with a maximum pit depth of 300 m. The total surface area of 

the pit is roughly 0.6 km
2
. The overburden thickness averages 12.2 m with a range of 4 m 

to 21 m. 

The ramp accesses the pit at the 425 m elevation on the North side. The ramp descends 

down the West and southern walls until developing into a slot at the 245 m elevation. The 

elevation of the pit bottom is 135 m. 

15.3.1 Mineral Reserves 

The Paul pit includes 21.4 Mt of proven mineral reserves and 140.3 Mt of probable 

mineral reserves for a total of 161.7 Mt. The grade of the Paul deposit is 7.16 % P2O5. In 

order to access these reserves, 7.6 Mt of overburden and 163.2 Mt of waste rock must be 

removed, resulting in a waste to ore stripping ratio of 1.1:1. At the planned production 

rate of 18.6 Mt of ore per year, the pit contains roughly 9 years of mineral reserves. 

The Manouane pit includes 123.3 Mt of proven mineral reserves and 22.1 Mt of probable 

mineral reserves for a total of 146.0 Mt. The grade of the Manouane deposit is 

5.95 % P2O5. In order to access these reserves, 14.7 Mt of overburden and 70.3 Mt of

waste rock must be removed, resulting in a waste to ore stripping ratio of 0.6:1. At the 

planned production rate of 18.6 Mt of ore per year, the pit yields roughly 8 years of 

mineral reserves. 

Table 15.5 shows the proven and probable mineral reserves that resulted from the pit 

designs for the Paul and Manouane deposits. These mineral reserves which account for 

ore loss form the basis of the mine plan. The pit layouts are shown in Figure 15.4 and

15.3.2 Dump Design 

Waste dumps were designed to contain the capacity of overburden and waste rock from 

the Paul and Manouane deposits. These dumps were designed using the following 

parameters: 

• Overall Slope: 34°; 

• Maximum Dump Height: 75 m; 

• Setback from Pit Crest: 100 m; 

• Setback from Major Creeks and Rivers: 100 m. 

The waste dumps will be constructed in 5 m high lifts, compacted by a bulldozer. 

The Paul North dump has a capacity of 40 Mm

16.0 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Mining Method 

The mining method selected for the Project is conventional truck and shovel with 10 m 

bench height.   

Vegetation and topsoil will be cleared by dozers ahead of the mining operation. Suitable 

organic material will be stockpiled for future reclamation use. Overburden will be 

stripped with front end hydraulic shovels and loaded into rigid frame mining trucks 

which will haul it to the waste dump. The ore and waste rock will be drilled and blasted 

then loaded and hauled with the same fleet of trucks and shovels. The ore will be hauled 

roughly 2 km to the primary crusher and the waste rock will be hauled to the dump.  

To properly manage water infiltration into the pit, a sump will be established at the 

lowest point on the pit floor. Water collected in this sump will be pumped to a collection 

point at surface.  

16.2 Mine Design 

The economic pit limits derived from the pit optimization were used as a guideline for the 

detailed pit design. The pit design process includes smoothing the pit wall, adding ramps 

to access the pit bottom and ensuring that the pit can be mined using the initially selected 

equipment. The following section provides the parameters that were used for the detailed 

pit design. 

16.2.1 Material Properties 

Table 16.1 defines the material properties that were used for mine design and mine 

planning purposes. The density of ore was supplied by SGS while the remaining 

parameters were taken from Met-Chem's internal database. These properties are 

important for determining the mine equipment fleet requirements.

16.2.2 Geotechnical Pit Slope Parameters 

An overall pit slope of 50° was used for the Paul and Manouane pit designs. The final pit 

wall includes a 9.5 m catch bench for every two (2), 10 m high benches and accounts for 

a 70° face angle. This design is based on Met-Chem's internal database for similar

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

deposits in the region. Met-Chem recommends a complete pit slope analysis if the Project 

advances to the Feasibility stage. The pit wall configuration is illustrated in Figure 16.1. 

A minimum mining width of 30 m has been considered in the pit design. 

Figure 16.1 – Pit Wall Configuration 

16.2.3 Haul Road Design  

The ramps and haul roads were designed with an overall width of 30 m. For double lane 

traffic, industry practice indicates the running surface width to be a minimum of 3 times 

the width of the largest truck Caterpillar 789 (177 t) with allowances for berms and 

ditches. 

A maximum ramp grade of 10% was used. The ramp width was reduced to 20 m for the 

final few benches at the bottom of the pit. This was done to reduce the quantity of waste 

in the overall pit design. The final few benches will see less truck traffic thus allowing for 

the reduced ramp width. 

16.2.4 Mine Dilution and Ore Loss 

During the mining operation, material at the ore waste contacts will not be separated 

perfectly. This effect is accounted for as either dilution, ore loss or a combination of both. 



 Ressources d'Arianne Inc.  
 Lac à Paul Apatite Project PFS Update – NI 43-101 Technical Report Page 179 

  July 2012 
  QPF-009-12/B 
 

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

In order to protect the ore zone from waste contamination and to maintain the deposit's 

P2O5 grade, an ore loss was assumed at these contacts. 

Met-Chem calculated an ore loss of 2% for both the Paul and Manouane deposits. During 

the production scheduling, 2% of the ore tonnage is converted into waste and sent to the 

waste dump. The grade of P2O5 is not affected since no dilution is accounted for. The ore 

loss is reflected in the mineral reserves. 

If the Project advances into the Feasibility stage, the mine dilution and ore loss 

assumption should be evaluated in more detail. 

16.3 Mine Planning 

16.3.1 Annual Production Requirements 

The production target for the mine is to supply the maximum ore feed that the plant can 

handle. The target for Year 1 is 13.231 Mt of run of mine ore. This target is a function of 

the plant's ramp up before obtaining full operating capacity. The plant's availability is 

expected to increase from 93% in Year 2 to 95% in Year 4. At 95% plant availability, the 

mine is expected to supply 18.642 Mt of run of mine ore per year (51,075 t/d). 

The mine plan will attempt to supply a constant head grade close to the deposit's average 

although due to the grade variability in the deposits, the grade in the mine plan ranges 

from 6.6% to 7.5% for Paul and from 5.7% to 6.2% for Manouane. The amount of 

concentrate produced is a function of head grade and plant recovery and thus varies from 

an average of 3.2 Mt per year for Paul to an average of 2.2 Mt per year for Manouane.  

The Paul deposit has been selected to be the first deposit to be mined. When its reserves 

are depleted in Year 9, production will begin at the Manouane deposit. The reserves at 

Manouane are depleted in Year 17. 

The decision to mine the Paul deposit first was based on the order in which the deposits 

were drilled. If the Project advances to the Feasibility stage, an in-depth analysis should 

be made to determine the preferred mining sequence.  

16.3.2 Work Schedule 

Mining operations for the Project will be 365 days per year, operating around the clock 

on two (2), twelve (12) hour shifts. The fleet requirements and manpower are based on 

this work schedule. 

16.3.3 Pre-Production 

A pre-production phase of six (6) months has been planned at the Paul deposit to achieve 

the following objectives: 

• Supply road construction material; 

• Supply construction material for the tailings dyke and polishing pond; 

• Strip overburden and waste rock to expose the ore.

16.3.4 Pushback Sequencing 

In order to minimize the waste removal in the early years of production, the Paul deposit 

will be mined in a series of three (3) pushbacks. Figure 16.2 shows a typical cross-section 

of the Paul deposit, highlighting the pushback designs. 

Figure 16.2 – Paul Pushback Design 

16.3.5 Production Schedule (Mine Plan) 

A production schedule was developed for the life of the Paul and Manouane deposits. 

The schedule realizes the pre-production requirements and meets the annual production 

target. 

The pre-production phase of mining will begin in Pushback 1 of the Paul deposit. A total 

of 4.1 Mt of material will be excavated in pre-production. Of this material, 2.3 Mt will be 

hauled to construct the tailings and polishing pond dykes. A total of 4 km of mine roads 

will be built during pre-production using suitable waste material from the mine. The 

remaining waste material will be hauled to the Paul North dump.   

During the first year of production, mining will progress in Pushback 1 of the Paul 

deposit, with the pit floor obtaining the 405 m elevation. A total of 2.1 Mt of concentrate 

will be produced in Year 1, which accounts for the plant ramp-up. The waste to ore 

stripping ratio will be 0.4:1 during Year 1.

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

Overburden stripping and waste removal will begin in Pushback 2 during the second year 

of production, reaching the 405 m elevation. The ore for Year 2 will be mined from 

Pushback 1, with the floor reaching the 365 m elevation. The waste to ore stripping ratio 

will be 1.0:1 during Year 2. 

During Year 3, Pushback 1 will be completed and Pushback 2 will begin producing ore. 

Overburden stripping and waste removal will begin in Pushback 3 in Year 3. The Paul 

deposit will be mined until reserves are depleted in Year 9. 

Waste rock from the Paul deposit will be used to elevate the tailings dykes as required. 

Remaining overburden and waste rock will be hauled to the North Waste Dump until 

Year 6. During Year's 7 - 9, waste rock hauled from the Paul deposit will be hauled to the 

South Waste Dump. 

The Manouane deposit will be mined in a series of two (2) pushbacks. Mining at the 

Manouane deposit will begin in Year 8 and continue until reserves are depleted in Year 

17. The haul distance from the Manouane deposit to the crusher is approximately 7 km 

and requires the construction of a haul road. 

A summarized production schedule for the Paul and Manouane deposits is presented in 

Table 16.2. Detailed end of period maps showing the pit and dump advances were 

produced as part of the Pre-Feasibility Study.

16.4 Mine Equipment Fleet 

The following section discusses equipment selection as well as fleet requirements in 

order to carry out the mine plan discussed in the previous section. More detailed 

information is provided in the Pre-Feasibility Study. 

16.4.1 Haul Trucks 

The haul truck selected for the Project is the Caterpillar 789. The following parameters 

were used to calculate the number of trucks required to carry out the mine plan. 

• Mechanical Availability – 85%; 

• Utilization – 90%; 

• Nominal Payload – 177 tonnes (105 m
3
 heaped); 

• Shift Schedule – Two (2), twelve (12) hour shifts per day, seven (7) days per week; 

• Operational Delays – 80 min/shift (this includes 15 minutes for shift change, 

15 minutes for equipment inspection, 40 minutes for lunch and coffee breaks and 

ten (10) minutes for fuelling). Fuelling will be carried out once every two (2) shifts 

for 20 minutes;  

• Job Efficiency – 90% (54 min/h; this represents lost time due to queuing at the 

shovel and dump as well as interference along the haul route); 

• Rolling Resistance – 3%. 

Table 16.3 summarizes the annual hours of a haul truck based on the specified 

parameters. Haul routes were generated for ore and waste for each period to calculate the 

truck requirements. These haul routes were imported in Talpac

available truck simulation software package that Met-Chem has validated with mining 

operations. Talpac

 calculated the travel time required for a Caterpillar 789 to complete 

each route.   

Table 16.3 – Truck Hours 

Scheduled Hours 8,760 h/y 7 days per week, 24 hours per day, 52 weeks per year 

Down Mechanically 1,314 h/y 15% of total hours 

Available 7,446 h/y Total hours minus hours down mechanically 

Standby 745 h/y 10% of available hours (represents 90% utilization) 

Operating 6,701 h/y Available hours minus standby hours 

Operating Delays 745 h/y 80 min/shift (only incurred only when the truck is available) 

Net Operating Hours 5,957 h/y Operating hours minus operating delays 

Working Hours 5,361 h/y 90% of net operating hours (reflects job efficiency) 

Haul productivities (tonnes per work hour) were calculated for each haul route using the 

truck payload and cycle time. The productivity during pre-production has been derated to 

reflect the fact that hauling and dumping conditions on the tailings dyke will be poor.

Table 16.4 shows the cycle time and productivity for the ore and waste haul routes in 

Year 4 as an example. 

Truck hour requirements were calculated by dividing the production into the productivity 

for each haul route. The number of trucks required was calculated assuming each truck 

has the 5,361 hours available to work in a full year, presented in Table 16.4. 

Table 16.4 –Truck Productivities (Year 4)

Ore 25.00 0.70 2.40 1.00 29.10 2.06 365 

Waste 30.00 0.70 2.40 1.00 34.70 1.73 306 
 

A fleet of six (6) trucks is required during pre-production. This number increases to 16 in 

Year 2, 23 in Year 3 and reaches a peak of 30 in Year five (5). The number of trucks 

begins to diminish in Year 10 and reaches 18 by the end of the life of mine.  

16.4.2 Shovels 

The main loading machine selected for the Project is the CAT 6040FS (formerly known 

as the RH170) hydraulic excavator. The CAT 6040FS is a shovel that will be suitable to 

handle the production requirements as well as the face heights expected. 

Met-Chem carried out an analysis to determine whether the hydraulic excavators should 

be diesel or electric driven. Even though the electric drive models require more capital 

investment for the electrical infrastructure, the operating cost for the electric shovel was 

considerably lower than the diesel shovel. The analysis demonstrated that the electric 

drive is the preferred option for the Project.  

The following parameters were used to calculate the number of excavators required to 

carry out the mine plan. 

• Mechanical Availability – 85%; 

• Utilization – 90%; 

• Bucket Capacity – 46 tonnes (22 m
3
); 

• Bucket Fill Factor – 70% in ore, 80% in waste and 100% in overburden; 

• Shift Schedule – Two (12), twelve (12) hour shifts per day, seven (7) days per 

week; 

• Operational Delays – 70 min/shift (this includes 15 minutes for shift change, 

15 minutes for equipment inspection, 40 minutes for lunch and coffee breaks). 

• Job Efficiency – 87% (52 min/h; this represents lost time due to waiting for trucks, 

cleaning up the loading area and relocating).

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

The CAT 6040FS excavator can load the Caterpillar 789 haul truck in four (4), 36 second 

passes for a total load time 2.4 minutes. Assuming there are trucks available to load, the 

excavator can load 25,177 tonne trucks per hour for a theoretical productivity of 

4,425 t/h. Accounting for mechanical availability, utilization, operational delays and job 

efficiency, each excavator has 5,243 available work hours in a full year. In order to mine 

the tonnages presented in the mine plan, one (1) shovel is required during pre-production 

and Year 1, followed by two (2) shovels in Year 2 followed by three (3) shovels for the 

remainder of the life of the mine.   

A Komatsu WA900-3 wheel loader equipped with a 28 tonne capacity bucket has been 

included in the fleet to be used as an alternate loading machine. 

16.4.3 Drilling and Blasting 

Blast patterns for ore and waste have been identified for the Pre-Feasibility Study. 

Production drilling will be done using Atlas Copco L8-30 drills equipped with down-the-

hole hammers and 165 mm (6.5") diameter bits. The number of drills required was 

estimated assuming an 85% mechanical availability, a 90% utilization and a penetration 

rate of 25 m/h. 

One (1) drill is required in pre-production, three (3) in Year 1, five (5) in Year 2 and 

seven (7) from Year 4 to 6.   

Blasting will be executed under contract with an explosives supplier who will store all the 

blasting materials and technology required by the mine. During full production there will 

be roughly two (2) blasts per week each producing approximately 300,000 t of material. 

16.4.4 Auxiliary Equipment 

A fleet of support and service equipment was included to carry out the mine plan. Table 

16.5 provides a summary of the auxiliary equipment.

16.5 Mine Dewatering 

Prior to mining activities, a ditch will be established around the perimeter of each pit to 

intercept water before it infiltrates into the pit. Rain water and ground water that is 

collected in the pit will be collected in an in-pit sump and pumped to a settling pond at 

surface. 

A ditch system will be established around the footprint of all waste dumps and topsoil 

stockpiles. Water collected in these ditches will be directed to settling ponds. All water 

that is collected in the ditches and sumps will be treated and sampled prior to discharge 

into the environment. The creek that currently runs North/South through the Paul deposit 

will be blocked at the North end and diverted into the lake system on the North side of 

the pit. 

If the Project advances to the Feasibility stage, a hydrogeology study should be carried 

out to estimate the quantity of water that is expected to be encountered during the mining 

operation. 

16.6 Manpower Requirements 

The total mine workforce for the Project ranges from 163 employees in pre-production to 

a maximum of 283 from Years 5. This workforce is comprised of staff as well as hourly

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 

Based on metallurgical testing results of Section 13, the process design criteria were 

developed and process flowsheets as well as plant layouts were prepared for a milling 

rate of 50,000 tpd. The following section summarizes the process developed for the 

project while detailed information may be found in the Pre-Feasibility Study report.  

The apatite processing activities are located at the mine site and include crushing, 

grinding, magnetic separation, flotation and filtration and drying of the concentrate.  

The phosphate concentrate is then transported by trucks approximately 200 km south of 

the processing plant to Dolbeau-Mistassini to be loaded into railcars. This second part of 

the plant is composed of two areas, the storage/reclaim system located on the north shore 

of the Mistassini River where the concentrate would be transported via a conveyor bridge 

to a rail car load out station on the south shore of the river. 

17.1 Processing Plant Design Criteria 

The processing plant is scheduled to operate three hundred sixty five (365) days per year, 

seven (7) day per week and twenty four (24) hours per day. 

The crushing plant is operating eighteen (18) hours per day at an average hourly rate of 

2,778 t/h. A stockpile, uncovered, will secure a constant feed to the processing plant. 

The Pre-Feasibility study is based on run-of-mine from the Paul pit for the first 10 years 

and the remaining 7 years from the Manouane open pit. The process plant is designed for 

a capacity of about 50,000 tpd for a phosphate concentrate average production rate of 

3,100,000 tonnes per year at a grade of 38% and recovery of 90%. 

A summary of design criteria is presented in Table 17.1.

17.2.2 Process Description 

The ore will be hauled by 177 tonne mine trucks and discharged into a gyratory crusher 

driven by a 600 kW motor. 

The ore is then crushed to approximately minus 160 mm and the apron feeder located 

underneath the gyratory crusher will direct crushed product to a radial telescopic belt 

conveyor that loads the stockpile (33,000 tonne capacity) located ahead of the grinding 

circuit. The coarser rocks in the crusher cavity could be broken down using a rock 

breaker.   

The ore from the stockpile is reclaimed using six (6) apron feeders and loaded onto a belt 

conveyor to feed the primary grinding circuit composed of a single SAG mill. The 

11,400 kW SAG mill operates in a closed circuit with two (2) vibrating screens. The 

SAG mill feed is controlled with a belt scale working in conjunction with the variable 

speed conveyor. 

The secondary grinding circuit consists of two 10,000 kW Ball Mills operating in parallel 

in a closed circuit with stack sizers.  

The product of both Ball Mills combine with the SAG Mill screen undersize and is then 

pumped to two parallel trains of 18 stack sizers per train for a total of thirty-six (36) stack 

sizers. 

The stack sizers' undersize gravity flows to a pump box and is then pumped to the 

magnetic separation circuit to remove magnetite. 

The magnetic separation circuit is composed of three (3) trains of low intensity magnetic 

separation (LIMS). Each train has eight (8) double drums separators.  

The concentrate from each train, containing magnetite and a small amount of sulphide 

minerals is pumped to the secondary tailings dam. 

The non magnetics (magnetic separation tailings) are pumped to thickeners. The 

thickener underflow is pumped to the high density conditioning tank located ahead of the 

apatite flotation circuit. 

The flotation circuit is composed of the following: 

• Two (2) trains of eight (8) rougher flotation cells (100 m³ capacity, each); 

• Two (2) trains of five (5) scavenger flotation cells (70 m³ capacity, each); 

• Two (2) trains of seven (7) first cleaner flotation cells (50 m³ capacity, each); 

• Two (2) trains of eleven (11) second cleaner flotation cells (40 m³ capacity, each); 

• Two (2) trains of eleven (11) third cleaner flotation cells (30 m³ capacity, each). 

The rougher cells recover as much apatite as possible to the concentrate. The rougher 

tailings are pumped to the scavenger cells to recover apatite that has not floated in the

rougher stage. The concentrate from both rougher and scavenger cells feed the cleaner 

circuit to increase the apatite concentrate grade to a commercial level.  

The scavenger and first cleaner tails are directed to a pump box and pumped to the inert 

tailings thickener. 

The concentrate from the first cleaner is pumped to the second cleaner circuit. The 

tailings from the second cleaner are returned to the first cleaners while the concentrate is 

pumped to the third cleaners. The third cleaner tailings are returned to the second 

cleaners feed. The third cleaners concentrate is the final product and is pumped to the 

dewatering circuit. 

The flotation concentrate is pumped to the apatite concentrate high rate thickener (19 m 

diameter). The thickener overflow is directed to the process water reservoir for recycling 

to the processing plant. The underflow is thickened to 58.0% solids by weight. 

The flotation tailings feed the tailings thickener (38 m diameter). The tailings thickener 

underflow is pumped to the inert tailings pond.  

The apatite concentrate thickener underflow is pumped to two (2) agitated storage tanks. 

The storage tanks feed four (4) filter presses installed in parallel. The filter presses are 

used to lower the concentrate moisture content to 8.0%. The filtrate is directed to the inert 

tailings thickener and the filter cake is conveyed to a rotary dryer to further dewater the 

concentrate to 2.0%. 

The dewatered concentrate (2% moisture) coming out of the dryer is then sent to a 

20,000 tonne capacity covered stockpile providing enough room to store 2 days of 

concentrate production.   

The stored concentrate is then reclaimed in a tunnel with three apron feeders and the 

concentrate is conveyed to fill a 1,000 tonnes truck load-out bin. The concentrate is then 

trucked over 200 km to the Dolbeau storage facilities (Off-Site). 

Trucks unload the concentrate on a 20,000 tonnes covered stockpile.  

The stored concentrate is then reclaimed in a tunnel with five (5) apron feeders. The 

concentrate is conveyed over the Mistassini River to fill a single train 3,100 tonnes load-

out bin on the other side of the river. The distance between the storage and the load-out 

system is approximately 4 km.  

17.2.3 Reagents 

There are five (5) reagents used in the apatite flotation process including one flocculant 

used for thickening: 

The reagents used for phosphate flotation to produce apatite concentrate are: 

• Liacid, as a collector for the apatite; 

• Sodium silicate, to depress silicates and aluminates;

• Starch, to depress the ilmenite and iron bearing minerals; 

• NaOH, to adjust the pH in the flotation circuit; 

• Flocculant, to help sedimentation during slurry thickening. 

17.2.4 Plant Services 

Air systems will support the air requirement for the process plant. A provision for fuel 

reservoirs to feed the dryer is included in project capital expenditure. 

17.2.5 Water Balance 

The water balance (presented below in Figure 17.2) is divided into the following sections: 

grinding, classification, magnetic separation, dewatering, flotation, flotation tailings 

dewatering, flotation concentrate dewatering, process water and tailings dam.  

The grinding section comprises the SAG mill and the two ball mills, whereas the 

classification section includes the stack sizers, the SAG mill screen and the dewatering 

screen. The flotation concentrate dewatering section contains both the thickener and the 

filter presses. 

Approximately 2,630 m
3
/d enter the process as moisture in the ore, while 740 m

3
/d leave 

with the product (as product moisture and as evaporation in the rotary dryer). The process 

reservoir's make-up water (20,790 m
3
/d) is supplied by the tailings dam. All fresh water, 

used for gland seal water, is from the river. Water entering the tailings dam comes from 

two tailings slurry streams, the magnetic concentrate and the flotation tailings. The 

tailings dam retains about 38% of the entering water. Based on the process water balance, 

the tailings dam is not expected to show excess water but this is not taking into account 

precipitation.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE  

This section summarizes infrastructure such as off-site power line, access road, 

concentrate transportation and concentrate rail load out and on site buildings, tailings 

storage facility, permanent camp and site services that are required to complement the 

processing of apatite ore at a milling rate of 50,000 tpd.  

All topographic information for the location of infrastructure was gathered from readily 

available data from Government of Canada and 5 m contours were used. It is understood 

that LIDAR based topographic map will be available for the Feasibility Study phase of 

the project. 

There have been no geotechnical investigations for surface infrastructure performed to 

date. Detailed geotechnical investigations will need to be performed in order to optimize 

civil design criteria related to foundation of mills and process plant. 

It is expected that field investigations will begin as the project will progress to feasibility 

phase. Provision for site preparation and earthwork is based on a 68,400 m
2
 area for the 

industrial site. 

An overall general site layout and access is provided on Figure 18.1 below. General 

layouts of the processing plant at a production rate of 50,000 tpd as well as of the 

administration building and warehouse are provided in the July 2012 Pre-Feasibility 

Study.

18.1 Off-Site Infrastructure 

18.1.1 Power Line 

The Lac à Paul mine and processing plant will be fed through a 161 kV overhead 

electrical power line supplied and installed by Hydro-Québec from the existing 

distribution point at the Péribonka power generation substation.  

The calculated cost of electricity is expected to be 0.05$ per kWh. 

18.1.2 Main Access Road 

Up to the Péribonka Power Station the Chemin-des-Passes access road is reportedly 

accessible year-round without any interruption. The last part of the Chemin-des-Passes, 

between Péribonka IV and the Lac à Paul site, is subject to restrictions during thaw 

season. Provision has therefore been made to upgrade the Chemin-des-Passes on a 

distance of approximately 100 km to allow year-round transportation.  

18.1.3 Concentrate Transportation and Load-Out Facility 

The type of haul truck selected for calculation of concentrate haulage from the plant site 

to the Dolbeau/Mistassini load-out facility is the GINAF HD4466. The truck's GCW 

(gross combined weight) has been limited to 165 tonnes, for a payload of 115 tonnes, to 

comply with the specifications for the network of bridges along the existing road. 

Using the same work schedule as the mine, two (2), twelve-hour shifts per day, seven (7) 

days per week. Each truck can transport one (1), 115 tonne load per shift, for roughly 

84,000 tonnes per year. A total of 18 trucks are required during the first year of operation, 

followed by 25 in Year 2. The maximum number of trucks required is 28 which occur in 

Year 5. 

The trucks will be loaded at the plant site from a concentrate silo using an automated 

loading system. The trucks will be unloaded in Dolbeau/Mistassini using a bottom dump 

configuration. 

In order to account for road maintenance, 1.8 M$ per year has been included to the mine 

operating cost estimate and provision is also included to upgrade part of the gravel road.  

The bottom dump trucks will unload the apatite concentrate at the receiving hopper and 

the stockpile feed conveyor located on the North shore of the Mistassini River. The 

apatite concentrate will be stored in the covered 20,000 tonnes stockpile.  

The stored concentrate is then reclaimed in a tunnel with three apron feeders and the 

concentrate is conveyed over the Mistassini River to fill a single train load-out bin of 

2,000 tonne capacity on the other side of the river. The distance between the storage and 

the train load-out system is approximately 4 km. Provision is made for a 300 m Accrow-

type conveyor bridge over the Mistassini River for part of the conveyor.

18.2 Site Infrastructure 

18.2.1 Tailings Storage Facility and Water Management 

A preliminary assessment of tailings disposal requirements to store and manage the 

tailings and process water was prepared for the life of mine of the Lac à Paul project. 

Tailings storage design is based on two distinct periods: Year 1 to 10, corresponding to 

the processing of Paul pit ore and Years 11 to 17 for the processing of Manouane pit ore. 

A traditional tailings storage facility is designed for Paul mill tailings while it is proposed 

that the Manouane mill tailings will be stored within Paul's depleted pit. 

Several scenarios were examined in order to optimize the location of the tailings park and 

minimize the height of the various dykes and hence material quantities and costs. The 

pond locations and construction scenarios examined were based on topographic 

information made available for the project and take into account the location of 

infrastructure and of additional mineral potential on the property. The selected Tailings 

Storage Facility for the first period is shown in Figure 18.2. 

The first phase of operation is planned for a 10 year continuous operation. The scheme of 

operation proposes transfer of free water from the tailings pond to a polishing pond to 

allow for sedimentation of fine particles. Water will be then transferred from the 

polishing pond to the plant to be used in processing. The tailings park includes a potential 

acid generating tailings storage pond for the magnetite tailings (about 10% of the total 

production). The water from this pond will be treated on a continuous basis before re-

used or released to the environment. 

a) Paul Mill Tailings 

The tailings storage requirements were based on the production of approximately 

14 M tonnes of mill tailings per year over a period of 10 years, based on a 

concentrator production rate of 18 M tonnes per year, considering at first the 

processing of the Paul zone ore for a period of 10 years. Design criteria were based 

on an assumed final depositional density of 1.66 t/m
3
 and a total tailings placement 

requirement of about 84.5 M m
3
. A potential acid generating (PAG) tailings storage 

pond is required for magnetite tails or about 10% of the total production while the 

remaining production is considered non-PAG. Figure 18.2 illustrates the tailings 

storage facility proposed for Year 1 to 10.

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

The water volume pumped into the tailings ponds is expected to be 33,633 m
3
 per 

day. The tailings will retain about 38% of the pumped water while 62% will be 

released, i.e. 20,785 m
3 

per day will be available. 

More detailed water balance estimates will be prepared during the Feasibility 

Study. They will be calculated on a per month basis accounting for variations of 

average monthly precipitation, evaporation and/or icing of the pond surface water 

in the winter for a normal, dry and a wet year, with the worst condition being that 

of a dry year. 

b) Manouane Mill Tailings 

Once the operation will reach the Manouane deposit after year 10, mill tailings will 

be sent to the depleted Paul pit.  

It is a common method to dispose tailings in an open pit that has been mined-out. 

Hydrogeology and rock mechanics studies will need to be performed to confirm if 

there would be a potential for seepage and thus risk of contamination (acid rock 

drainage, etc.) and identify control methods (liners, grouting, etc.), if and as 

required. 

The pit is relatively close to the process plant, thereby minimizing capital and 

operating costs for the tailings handling and process water feed systems. 

The total volume available in Paul pit would be 82 M m
3
. Approximately 70 M m

3
 

of mill tailings will be produced from Manouane deposit. It is expected that Paul pit 

will be sufficient to contain Manouane's mill tailings. 

c) Recommendations 

Geotechnical work such as geotechnical drilling, seismic analysis, stability analysis 

is recommended in the Feasibility Stage to confirm assumptions used for the 

tailings storage facility design and waste piles in the Pre-feasibility assessment as 

well as to permit preliminary foundations evaluation for the plant facilities.  

Rock mechanics as well as hydrogeological studies will be required to further 

confirm rock slopes, permeability, ground and underground water flows and water 

balance. Testing of the tailings geochemical and physical/mechanical properties 

and behaviour is recommended, such as: 

• Geochemical properties testing: ABA (for acid generation), humidity 

tests (coarse and fine fractions), fresh and aged supernatant analysis 

(coarse and fine fractions); 

• Physical/mechanical properties testing: size distribution, specific 

gravity, Atterberg limits, proctor maximum dry density and optimum 

water content, maximum density by vibrator and by drying, minimum 

density, settling, low and overburden stress consolidation settlement.

Investigation for borrow banks for suitable materials for construction of the various 

dykes, pads and roads as well as concrete aggregates should be undertaken during 

the Feasibility Study to determine quantities available and distance from the various 

facilities. 

Condemnation drilling will be required in the area of the Paul's mills tailings 

storage facility. 

More detailed topographic survey of the site during the Feasibility Phase will 

enhance accuracy of the estimates and associated cost analyses.  

18.2.2 Camp Site Accommodations 

The Camp will be located on the north side of the main road approximately 5 km west of 

the industrial site. Permanent housing will be built on the basis that approximately 

240 operations personnel including managing, office as well as support staff.  

18.2.3 Site Roads 

Site and service roads, 10 m wide except for the mine roads, will provide access to:  

• Process facility from the Chutes-des-Passes main road; 

• Fresh water pumping station; 

• Tailings storage facility; 

• Explosive depot;  

• Equipment maintenance facilities for mining equipment; 

• Mine roads to crusher and waste rock dump areas. 

18.2.4 Site Buildings 

In addition to the concentrator building which will house grinding, magnetic separation, 

flotation and concentrate filtering and drying, the site will include the following: 

• The administrative building; 

• The mine equipment maintenance facility; 

• The warehouse;  

• The emergency vehicles building, and 

• The mine dry (change house). 

18.2.5 Site Services 

Provision has been made in the project for the following site services:

• Potable water treatment; 

• Fuel storage and fuelling station; 

• Aggregate crushing plant; 

• Sanitary waste water treatment; 

• Allowances for plant mobile equipment (light vehicles, earth moving vehicles at the 

stockpiles, mobile crane, manlift, boom truck, fire, ambulance and rescue trucks; 

• Mine explosive storage. 

18.2.6 Site Power and Automation 

The power requirements of the Lac à Paul Project will be supplied by a 161 kV power 

line. The total power demand is estimated at 60.9 MW of which 55.4 MW is required for 

the process. A power demand of 0.7 MW is estimated for the concentrate handling and 

storage facility in Dolbeau-Mistassini. 

Based on the power requirements, two oil type 37/50/67 MVA transformers were 

selected which will ensure the operation of the plant even if one transformer fails. 

Provision is made for four (4) electrical rooms to feed the crusher, the crushed ore 

stockpile and the process areas. 

An emergency power system consisting of four (4) diesel generators will provide a 

standby source of power to feed essential services (emergency and exit lighting, fire 

pumps, etc.) as well as critical process loads (slurry tank agitators preventing settling 

down of material, thickener lifting devices, etc.) in the event of power loss from the grid. 

Allowances have been included in the estimate for automation, fire alarm, 

communication system and security system.  

More detailed information is provided in the Pre-Feasibility Study report.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

An independent market study is expected to be carried out as the project will proceed to 

Feasibility Studies, but no independent analysis of the market for phosphate concentrate 

or price survey have been conducted to date for the Lac à Paul Apatite project.  

Similarly no sales contract has been secure at this early stage of the project.  

The sales price that has been suggested by Ressources d'Arianne and which was used for 

the project economic analysis is based on the 85% BPL Russian prices over recent years 

with consideration of the September 2011 CRU 10-year outlook report on the phosphate 

rock market.   

Recent information regarding market assumptions and pricing are provided in the CRU 

10-year outlook report
2
 on the phosphate rock market, dated September 2011. As 

mentioned in the report, the phosphate rock demand has increased to record level after 

two years of decline following the high of 2008. Prices have followed the demand with 

223 US$/tonne (85% BPL Russia) forecasted for 2011 compared with 225 US$/tonne for 

2008 and 158 US$/tonne for 2010. CRU is forecasting that phosphate rock prices will go 

downward during 2012. According to the same report and CRU's phosphate rock average 

price forecast in current dollars, from 2012 onward to 2020, prices are expected to vary 

between 203 US$/tonne and 180 US$/tonne with a forecast price of 190 US$/tonne for 

2012. Based on this information, a constant price of 175 US$/tonne (85% BPL Russia) 

has been selected for the project.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY 
IMPACT 

20.1 Legislative Framework 

The preparation of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the Lac à Paul Apatite 

Project will be guided by a series of provincial and federal laws, regulations and 

administrative procedures presented below. The Project Notice has been filed with the 

Government in May 2011 and the project guidelines to prepare the EIA have been 

provided to Ressources d'Arianne in June 2011. 

20.1.1 Provincial Legislation  

a) Environment Quality Act (EQA)  

i) Environmental impact assessment (EIA) 

Under subsection 31.1 of the Quebec Environment Quality Act, (R.S.Q., c.  

Q-2):   

"No person may undertake any construction, work, activity or operation, or 

carry out work according to a plan or program, in the cases provided for by 

regulation of the Government without following the environmental impact 

assessment and review procedure and obtaining an authorization certificate 

from the Government (1978, c. 64, s. 10)." 

ii) Projects Subject to the EIA Procedure 

The list of projects subject to the Environmental Impact Assessment and 

Review Procedure is presented in the Regulation Respecting Environmental 

Impact Assessment and Review. Under paragraph (p), the Lac à Paul Apatite 

Project falls within this category because the intended daily production will 

exceed 500 metric tons.   

It should be noted however that, as stated in the same regulation, projects 

involving several elements subject to an EIA require a single EIA statement 

and a single application for a certificate of authorization.   

iii) Administrative Procedure 

There is a total of six phases to complete the environmental impact assessment 

process as described hereafter. 

• Emission of a Directive by the Ministry of Sustainable Development, 

Environment and Parks (MSDEP) 

Any person wishing to undertake projects contemplated in Section 31.1 of the 

EQA must file a written notice with the Minister describing the general nature 

of his project. The Minister, in turn, will indicate through a directive to the 

proponent of the project the nature, scope and extent of the environmental 

impact assessment statement to be prepared (ss. 31.2) 1978, c. 64, s. 10.

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

The Ministry emitted, in April 2005, a general directive specific to mining 

activities called Directive 19. This document mainly covers the general 

environmental baseline and the operational aspects of the mining activities 

and requirements for the preparation of requests for a Certificate of 

authorization. However, some of its content will have to be considered in the 

EIA for the Lac à Paul Apatite Project, namely the standards fixed for water 

effluents, groundwater and noise and vibrations. 

More recently, on September 2010, the Ministry produced a specific directive 

detailing the requirements on conducting an EIA for mining projects 

triggering article 31.1. This document will be the baseline for the EIA of the 

Lac à Paul Apatite Project. 

• Environmental Impact Assessment Study 

In broad terms, there are four key steps to an environmental impact 

assessment study: 

• Describe the project in detail; 

• Describe the biophysical and human environment; 

• Evaluate the negative environmental effects; 

• Determine ways to eliminate or reduce the negative effects on the 

environment. 

The specific steps in the process can vary depending upon the scope of the 

project, the anticipated level of the impact on the environment and several 

other factors. 

 Public Participation (Bureau d'audience publique sur l'environnement, 
BAPE) 

 Public Consultation 

After confirming acceptance of the environmental impact assessment 

statement, the Minister will make the document public and the public 

information and consultation process as required by law will be initiated.  

 Public Hearing 

Any person, group or a municipality may, within the timeframe prescribed by 

law, apply to the Minister to hold a public hearing for the project. 

 Report 

Unless he considers such an application to be unfounded the Minister shall 

require the Public Hearings Bureau (the Bureau or as commonly known in 

French, the BAPE) to hold a public hearing and report its findings and its 

analysis thereof to him. (ss. 31.3) 1978, c. 64, s. 10; 1999, c. 40, s. 239.

 Analysis by the MSDEP 

In order to study certain matters more thoroughly, or to research elements 

which he considers necessary to fully evaluate the impact of the proposed 

project on the environment, the Minister may, at any time, request the 

proponent of the project to provide supplementary information. (ss. 3.4) 1978, 

c. 64, s. 10. 

 Decision 

Once the environmental impact assessment statement is considered 

satisfactory by the Minister, it is submitted to the Government along with the 

application for authorization. The Government may or may not issue the 

decree authorizing the project, with or without amendments, and on such 

conditions as it may determine. That decision may be made by any committee 

of ministers of which the Minister is a member and to which the Government 

has delegated that power (ss. 3.4).  

 Control 

The MSDEP reserves the right to do site inspections during the various work 

phases of the project to ensure that the terms of the decree and certificates of 

authorization emitted are respected. 

b) Other Laws, Regulations and Guidelines 

Once the environmental impact assessment and review procedure for the Lac à Paul 

Apatite Project required under subsection 31.1 of the Quebec EQA is completed, 

and the decree obtained from the provincial Government, the detailed engineering 

of the project will be finalized. This step shall take into account the environmental 

mitigation measures associated with mining equipment and infrastructure as 

presented in the EIA and incorporated by the Government in the decree. It shall 

also consider all applicable environmental standards included in other relevant 

provincial laws and regulations. These include: 

• The Mining Act (R.S.Q., c. M-13.1);   

This Act is presently under review by the provincial government (Project Bill 14) 

and according to the preliminary available information, many important changes 

will be included that could render more complicated exploration work and the 

opening and exploitation of a new mining site. Amongst the main potential new 

requirements there are:   

• The need to obtain authorization from private land owners before 

gaining access to their property; 

• The exclusion of some land area from mining exploration and 

operations, including those within an urbanization perimeter and any 

area dedicated to vacationing. To do any work on these excluded

claims, holders would have to obtain the consent of the local 

municipality concerned; 

• The increase of the security deposit from 70% to 100% of the estimated 

costs of the rehabilitation plan for the mining site accumulation areas 

(waste rock dumps and tailings storage facilities); 

• The security deposit must be provided over a period of three years at 

the beginning of the operation; 

• The future evolution of the content of this review of the mining act will 

have to be carefully monitored as it progresses and evolves. 

• Directive 19 on the mining industry (April 2005); 

• The Forest Act (R.S.Q., c. F-4.1); 

• The Watercourses Act (R.S.Q., c. R-13); 

• The Dam Safety Act (R.S.Q., c. S-3); 

• The Transportation of Dangerous Substances Regulation (R.R.Q. c. C-24.2, r.4.2.) 

• The Petroleum Products Act (R.S.Q., c. P-29.1); 

• The Groundwater Catchment Regulation (R.R.Q., c. Q - 2, r.1.3); 

• The Regulation Respecting Pits and Quarries (R.R.Q., c. Q-2, r.2); 

• The Regulation Respecting Wastewater Disposal Systems for Isolated Dwellings 

(R.R.Q., c. Q-2, r.8); 

• The Act Respecting Threatened or Vulnerable Species, (R.S.Q, c E-12.01). 

This list of laws, regulations and guidelines may require that the proponent of the 

project obtains one or various specific certificates of authorization (CofA). These 

CofA's are obtained through the same department of the Ministry's central office 

that revised the EIA, but the follow up activities specified in the CofA's will be 

conducted by the concerned regional office of the Ministry. 

20.1.2 Federal Legislation  

a) Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) 

Under Section 5 of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, a federal 

environmental assessment may be required when, in respect of a project:   

• A federal authority is the proponent, 

• A federal authority makes or authorizes payment or any other form of 

financial assistance to the proponent; 

• A federal authority sells, leases, or otherwise disposes of lands;  

• A federal authority issues a permit, license, or other form of approval.  

Statutory and regulatory approvals requiring environmental assessments under the 

Canadian Environmental Assessment are itemized in the Law List Regulations. In 

the case of the Lac à Paul Apatite Project, based on a review of the project 

description available at this stage of the pre-feasibility studies, an environmental

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

assessment under the Act may be required if for example, completion of the project 

was to involve on-site storage of explosives, obstruction of watercourses, pumping 

of underground water from the open pit mine, disruption or destruction of fish 

habitat or alteration of water quality or threatening of species at risk.   

Relevant regulatory provisions of potentially applicable laws are described below. 

b) Relevant Regulatory Provisions 

The Explosives Act (Sch. I, P.I, It.5) 

The Explosives Act governs the manufacture, testing, sale, storage and importation 

of explosives in Canada. Under Section 7(1) (a), an approval is required from the 

Minister of Natural Resources for an explosives magazine (storage). 

The Fisheries Act (Sch. I, P.I, It.6) and (Sch. II, It. 5) 

The Fisheries Act deals with the proper management and control of the fisheries, 

the conservation and protection of fish and the protection of fish habitat, and 

prevention of pollution. It provides for the following authorizations, requirements 

and orders: 

• Section 22(1): Requirement, as determined by the Minister of Fisheries 

and Oceans, for the owner or occupier of any obstruction to provide 

sufficient flow of water over the spillway or crest for the safe and 

unimpeded descent of fish. 

• Section 22(2): Requirement, as determined by the Minister, for the 

owner or occupier of any obstruction to ensure the free passage of 

migratory fish during construction of the obstruction. 

• Section 22(3): Requirement, as determined by the Minister, for the 

owner or occupier of any obstruction to provide sufficient water below 

the obstruction to ensure the safety of the fish and the water level 

necessary for the safety of ova in spawning grounds. 

• Section 32: Authorization by the Minister or under regulations made by 

the Governor in Council (Cabinet) for the destruction of fish by any 

means other than by fishing. 

• Section 35(2): Authorization by the Minister or under regulations made 

by the Governor in Council to cause the harmful alteration, disruption 

or destruction of fish habitat in the course of carrying out a work or 

undertaking. 

• Section 36(5) (a to e): Site-specific regulations by the Governor in 

Council authorizing the deposit of deleterious substances. Deleterious 

substances are defined as substances that, if added to water, would alter 

or degrade the quality of that water so that it is deleterious to fish. 

• Section 37(2): Ministerial order requiring modifications, additions or 

restrictions to, or the closing of a work that does or could result in the

harmful alteration, disruption or destruction of fish habitat, or the 

deposit of deleterious substances. 

Normally, most projects are only submitted to Section 35(2) requirements. 

The Migratory Birds Convention Act (Sch. I, P.I, It.7.1)  

The Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994 provides for the implementation in 

Canada of the 1916 Convention between the United Kingdom and the United States 

of America for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada and the United States. 

The Convention may be amended from time to time. Under Section 5.1 (1) of the 

Act:  

"No person or vessel shall deposit a substance that is harmful to migratory 

birds, or permit such a substance to be deposited, in waters or an area 

frequented by migratory birds or in a place from which the substance may 

enter such waters or such an area." 

The Species at Risk Act (S.C. 2002, c. 29) 

The Species at Risk Act (SARA) was created to prevent wildlife species from 

becoming extinct. The Act protects species at risk and their critical habitats. SARA 

also contains provisions to help manage species of special concern to prevent them 

from becoming endangered or extinct. 

Once a species is listed under the Species at Risk Act, it becomes illegal to kill, 

harass, capture or harm it in any way. Critical habitats are also protected from 

destruction. The Act also requires that recovery strategies, action plans and 

management plans be developed by the competent minister for all listed species. 

Under Section 33:  

"No person shall damage or destroy the residence of one or more individuals 

of a wildlife species that is listed as an endangered species or a threatened 

species, or that is listed as an extirpated species if a recovery strategy has 

recommended the reintroduction of the species into the wild in Canada." 

Administrative Procedure  

A project triggering some of the Federal environmental regulations but for which 

the Federal government is not directly implicated (on federal land, federal loan or 

initiated by a federal agency), will be managed by the Quebec Ministry of 

Sustainable development, Environmental and Parks (MSDEP). As mentioned 

previously (Section 20.1), it is the MSDEP that emits the directive, following the 

written notice submitted by the proponent, that will be followed to conduct the EIA. 

The written notice is submitted simultaneously to the Federal Agency. 

Nonetheless, depending on the Federal regulation triggered, the corresponding 

federal authorities will prepare an internal environmental screening that will be 

based on the information transmitted through the EIA prepared by Ressources

d'Arianne and on the answers supplied to the questions and commentaries 

formulated by the Federal agencies on this EIA. The questions and comments of 

these agencies will be taken into account in the EIA, before it is considered 

acceptable and the decree is issued by provincial authorities. This step will ensure 

that environmental concerns associated with federal statutory and regulatory 

approvals have been properly addressed in the EIA.   

In the end, the Quebec provincial government will make the final decision on the 

acceptability of the EIA and emit their authorization to proceed (the decree), while 

the federal agencies will emit their own permits based on their environmental 

screenings. 

20.2 Environmental Sensitive Areas 

The description of the environmentally sensitive areas are based on existing studies 

conducted in the area by Hydro-Québec for the derivation of the Manouane River project 

and from a site visit conducted on June 22-23, 2011. 

20.2.1 Physical Aspects 

The regional climate is of the continental type and characterized as temperate-cold. 

Information available from the Chute-des-Passes station show a mean yearly temperature 

is of -0.3 
o 

C with up to 225 days of freezing conditions (Hydro-Québec, 2000). Average 

precipitations amount to 1,250 mm resulting in a snow covert that lasts up to at least six 

months, that is from November to April (Hydro-Québec, 2000). Dominant winds come 

from the west and north-west with an average yearly speed of 11.7 km/hr (Hydro-

Québec, 2000). 

Rolling hills and the presence of narrow valleys describe the topography of the area 

surrounding Lac à Paul, which is typical of the Laurentian Highlands. 

The Lac à Paul area is part of the Manouane river watershed. The Manouane River flows 

around the north and west of Lac à Paul and continues southeast to feed the Péribonka 

River. Lac à Paul overflows into the Manouane River through the Naja River.  

Lac à Paul is fed by a number of smaller lakes that overflow into it through various 

unnamed streams. The area is also strewed with wetlands and bogs of various sizes, the 

most important surrounding Epinette Lake, east of Lac à Paul. 

Water quality in the vicinity of Lac à Paul is unknown at this time. However, surface 

water sampling and analysis completed on various section of the Manouane River 

showed, for the section closest to Lac à Paul a neutral pH (7.1), a temperature of 12.8
o
C 

and a conductivity of 18.4 µS/cm. Furthermore, other compiled sources show a slight 

acidity of the lakes water (pH between 4.9 and 6.1) but no other specific problem 

considering Quebec's surface water quality criteria.

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

Air quality in the area is presumed to be good as the only regular sources of pollutants 

includes dust generated by the passing vehicles on the local gravel access road and 

logging activities. 

Ambient sound levels are essentially of natural origin with the exception of vehicles 

passing on the local access road and some logging activities. 

20.2.2 Biological Aspects 

a) Flora 

The area of Lac à Paul is part of the ecological region of the Toulnustouc River and 

is characterized by the forest domain of the Black Spruce with Fir and mosses. This 

type of forest is dominated by coniferous species. Broad-leaves trees are more 

sporadic and rarely form more than 25% of the forest. 

Semi-aquatic vegetation is generally present in narrow bands along the various 

local streams, lakes and ponds.  

Many areas to the north, east and south have been logged some time ago and the 

existing forest is in various stages of development towards the typical regional 

climax of the Black Spruce forest. 

At this time, there are no protected areas near the Lac à Paul site although there is a 

project to create such an area some 20 km to the south west of the proposed mine 

site. This project was initiated by the Parks and Ecological Heritage Direction of 

the MSDEP and is still under review and its protection status has yet to be 

determined (Michel Bergeron, MSDEP, Personal communication, August 2011). 

b) Fauna 

Terrestrial fauna associated with the forest domain of the Black Spruce with Fir and 

mosses includes a wide variety of bird species, various mammals and some reptiles 

and amphibians. Lac à Paul is located in an area perturbed by logging activities and 

the forest is in various stages of development thus creating a wide variety of niches 

for animal species. Approximately 150 bird species could potentially use the region 

for nesting and roosting.  

According to previous study, a little over 40 species of mammals could be observed 

in the area including a wide variety of rodents. 

The Forest Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) a once common mammal of the 

Boreal forest is now considered vulnerable. The Lac à Paul area is located within its 

known range and some specimens have been observed some 30 km to the southeast 

in the area of the Pipmuacan Lake. In its Territorial Portrait of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-

Jean (MRNF, 2006), the MRNF presented various areas under study for the 

protection of this Reindeer. The closest sites extend from the north shores of the 

Pipmuacan reservoir and there western limit is only 11 km from Lac à Paul. A 

second group of sites are located along the shores of Lake Péribonka and their

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

southern limits are located 16 km from Lac à Paul. Finally, a third area, 

surrounding Manouane Lake and extending towards the southeast is located 25 km 

north of Lac à Paul. Nature Quebec has published in 2007 a proposition for the 

creation of protected areas for this reindeer which identified various areas showing 

a good potential to become protected areas. The nearest of these areas is 

corresponds to a section of the Manouane lake site identified by the MRNF (2006). 

This area located approximately 70 km north of Lac à Paul. 

A limited number of herpetofaunal species, including amphibians and reptiles, are 

present in the area. According to the Quebec Amphibians and Reptiles Atlas web 

site (consulted on July 5, 2011), only nine species of amphibians (Newt, 

Salamaders and Frogs) and one species of reptile (Common Garter Snake 

(Thamnophis sirtalis)) could potentially be found in the area of Lac à Paul. 

There is a significant variety of aquatic fauna occupying the various lakes, ponds, 

streams and rivers found in the area. Amongst the main fish species registered by 

Hydro-Québec in 2000 the three most common include the Ouananiche, the Lake 

Whitefish and the Northern Pike. According to Hydro-Québec (2000), the 

Ouananiche is present in Lac à Paul. According to Mr. Omer Gauthier (Personal 

communication, MRNF, July 2011) and information available on the internet site of 

the Lac-Paul Outfitter, the Brook trout, the White Sucker, the Longnose Sucker and 

various species of the Cyprinidae family are also present in the area's watershed. 

20.2.3 Human Aspects 

a) Regional context 

The Lac à Paul Property is located in the northern area of the Lac St-Jean 

administrative area on Crown land. It is part of the unorganized territory of Mont-

Valin corresponding to the northern section of Le Fjord-du-Saguenay Regional 

County Municipality (RCM), one of the RCM of the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean 

administrative division (02). The unorganized territory of Mont-Valin makes up 

85% of Le Fjord-du-Saguenay RCM and is the largest subdivision of the 

Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region. The surface area of the unorganized territory of 

Mont-Valin is 37,565 km
2
. The global mining activities will also have 

repercussions on the MRC of Maria-Chapdelaine where the main infrastructure for 

the shipment throughout North America and the world could be located. 

The project is linked to the more organized areas of the MRC of Maria-Chapdelaine 

through four season and forestry roads connecting the mine site to Dolbeau-

Mistassini (some 225 km to the southwest of the mine). The first town encountered 

in the organized territory when driving on road R0251 is St-Ludger-de-Milot 

located approximately 165 km South of Lac à Paul. 

Similar roads also link the mine to the north shore of the Saguenay River (some 

200 km to the southeast of the mine) at the limit of Le Fjord-du Saguenay RCM in

the municipality of St. Fulgence. From Dolbeau, the mine gains access to the rest of 

North America through a connection with the railway system. This railway system 

also links the mine to the city of Saguenay from where the concentrated ore could 

be shipped anywhere in the world via the Grande-Anse Marine Terminal of Port of 

Saguenay.  

b) Planning 

The official manager of the provincial public land is the Ministry of Natural 

Resources and Wildlife (MNRW). This ministry is responsible for the preparation 

and amendments of public land use plans with the cooperation of various internal 

departments and independent organizations. These plans ensure a coherency of 

interventions across the territory. They convey government direction with respect to 

the development and preservation of land and resources, thereby guiding the 

actions of the government of Québec's departments and public agencies with 

respect to granting rights or status on public land.  

c) Land Use  

The area covered by the Lac à Paul project is completely located within a forest 

land use designation. There is no known residential land use in the project area. 

Most of the area considered for the mining project is located inside the Lac-Paul 

outfitter's territory, where people come for nature recreational activities.  

With a surface area of 98 km
2
, the outfitter's territory includes 26 lakes and two (2) 

rivers. There are some cottages, part of the Lac-Paul outfitter's installations, located 

on an island (1½ km) within the heart of Lac à Paul. Some cottages for hunters and 

fishermen are also present on the lake's shore. 

Ressources d'Arianne was negotiating the purchase of Lac Paul outfitter's rights for 

hunting and fishing on this territory and has since purchased as announced 

November 4
th

, the Lac Paul oufitter's rights. 

According to Hydro-Quebec (Manouane River Derivation Impact Study, 2000), 

some native camping sites can also be found near the Lac à Paul Lake and the 

Manouane River as well as canoe-camping activities along the Manouane River 

which is part of the canoe-camping circuit of the Fédération québécoise du canot et 

du kayak (Quebec Federation of canoeing and kayaking).   

Furthermore, there are various cottages owned by individuals (natives and non-

natives) distributed along the various roads giving access to this region. Their exact 

location has not been determined at this stage but will be in the course of the impact 

study. Also, along the main local roads (R0251 and R0253), there are the facilities 

of the ZEC des Passes (starting approximately 5 km from St-Ludger-de-Milot and 

extending to km 90 along the R0251) and the Des Passes Pavilion (located

approximately 35 km to the south west of Lac à Paul) that could be impacted by a 

traffic increase.   

The project area is located within the Bersimis beaver reserve and trapping ground 

(Hydro Quebec, March 2009). 

d) Cultural heritage 

The evaluation of the archaeological potential of the Manouane River Derivation 

conducted by Hydro-Quebec led to the identification of 125 zones (for a total of 

346 ha) of archaeological potential. However it appears that none of these zones are 

located within the Lac à Paul project area. Nevertheless, there is a good probability 

that the Lac à Paul area was used by the native communities in the past because of 

its proximity to the Manouane River, but this remains to be confirmed. 

e) Native communities  

i) Nistassinan Territory 

The Lac à Paul project area is located within the Innu ancestral territories 

called Nistassinan, or "our land". Globally, Nistassinan corresponds to the 

territory of Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, the RCM's of Haute-Côte-Nord and 

Manicouagan, the southern part of the RCM of Caniapiscau and the eastern 

part of the RCM of Minganie. This territory is divided into various 

Nistassinan, corresponding to the native communities using the land and its 

right of use is presently under negotiation between the government and the 

Innu communities.   

The Lac à Paul project appears to be located entirely within the Nistassinan of 

Betsiamites (Pessamit), but the effective limit with the Nistassinan of 

Mashteuiash is very near to the west of the exploitation area (approximately 

10 km). As mentioned previously, these Nistassinan are also under negotiation 

and the specific limit between these two territories remains under discussion 

and may be revised. 

According to the agreement currently under negotiation, there would be no 

change to the status of this vast territory. It would remain under full Québec 

jurisdiction, and the current laws of Québec and Canada would continue to 

apply there. 

However, on these territories, except for that of the island of Anticosti, the 

Innu governments: 

• Would be entitled to a share of the mining royalties collected by 

Québec for the exploitation of natural resources

• Would supervise the traditional hunting and fishing activities of the 

Innu according to a regime agreed upon with the governments of 

Québec and Canada; 

• Would participate in the government processes to manage the territory, 

natural resources and the environment; 

• Would take part in socioeconomic activities (i. e.: exploitation of 

natural resources, park management).  

In certain precise areas, the proposal for an agreement-in-principle allows for 

the negotiation of special arrangements to protect heritage sites.  

ii) Reserves
4
 

• Mashteuiatsh 

The Mashteuiatsh Reserve is located on the west shore of Lake Saint-

Jean and covers 14.5 km
2
. It is located some 280 km to the southwest of 

the Lac à Paul area. According to Statistics Canada, in 2006, the 

resident population of the Mashteuiatsh Reserve was 1,749 people and 

the population density was 120.6 per square kilometer. The population 

is considered quite young, with 35% of residents below 19 years of age. 

Amongst the various Aboriginal communities established in reserves, 

the Mashteuiatsh community is one of the oldest in Quebec. A great 

number of people work for the Band Council which is the most 

important employer in Mashteuiatsh. The public service, teaching, 

healthcare and social service sectors account for just over half the jobs 

in the community. Other sources of employment are in forestry, 

manufacturing, construction, transportation, retail stores, and the 

accommodation and restaurant industries. 

• Betsiamites 

Covering 256 km
2
, the Betsiamites (Pessamit) community is the largest 

Aboriginal reserve in southern Quebec. In a straight line, t is located 

more or less 160 km from the Lac à Paul area but following the existing 

road network it is at more than 500 km from the future exploitation 

area. The population, which totalled 2,357 people in 2006, is considered 

young as almost 40% of residents are under 19 years of age. The Band 

Council employs close to 200 people full time, providing more than 

two-thirds of jobs in the community. Other fields of economic activity 

are forestry, construction, petty trade and traditional activities.

f) Infrastructures 

Aside from road facilities, there is no infrastructure along the section of the 

Manouane River bordering the project area or within the Lac à Paul area. The main 

road crossing the future mine's property is a four season's gravel road known as 

R0251. South of the lake is Road R0258 that gives access to various forest 

exploitation areas and to the Pipmuacan Lake area. Further south along R0251 is 

R0253 which descends south following more or less the eastern side of the 

Péribonka River and eventually reaches Road 172 at the level of Saint-Fulgence 

near the City of Saguenay. R0251 continues towards the southwest and after 

crossing the Péribonka River, it connects to the R0250 which continue south to 

Saint-Ludger-de-Milot where it connects to the paved regional road network and 

eventually to the provincial road 169 that surrounds the Lac Saint-Jean. 

As mentioned previously, the railway network is accessible from the City of 

Dolbeau-Mistassini located some 50 km west of Saint-Ludger-de-Milot and a 

harbour is accessible within the City of Saguenay which could be reached with the 

train from Dolbeau-Mistassini. 

However, at a larger regional scale, there are two hydroelectric power plants 

located relatively near the project. They are Rio Tinto Alcan hydroelectric complex 

of Chutes-des-Passes located some 35 km to the west-southwest of the Lac à Paul 

area and Péribonka IV located some 60 km away. 

Finally, a series of dams and dikes were constructed by Hydro-Quebec on the 

Manouane River some 10 to 15 km to the northeast of the Lac à Paul area to 

redirect part of the river's water into the Pipmuacan Reservoir. 

g) Initial social concerns 

Two public information sessions were held in the cities of Dolbeau-Mistassini and 

Saguenay on June 8 and 9, 2011. These sessions were mainly aimed at presenting 

some preliminary information on the project and collect first impressions, concerns 

and expectations from the participants. The following aspects highlight the main 

concerns and expectations expressed: 

• The importance of implementing a security plan for the use of the ore's 

transportation routes; 

• The number of trucks and the traffic generated by the ore's 

transportation to southern destinations; 

• The communication of the time and schedules related to the use of the 

transport routes; 

• The environmental and social impacts of the presence of trucks on the 

transport routes and of the overall increase in traffic; 

• The importance of integrating a revegetation and reforestation plan into 

the mitigation measures that will be proposed;

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

• The elaboration of a good communication plan that will ensure 

transparency at all stages of the project. The creation of a round table 

including stakeholders should be considered; 

• The need to clarify the role and participation of native communities; 

• Defining the benefits for the local economy and how local man power 

will be implicated in the project. 

20.3 Environmental Issues 

20.3.1 Physical Issues 

Five main potential physical issues have been identified in relation to the installation and 

operation of a mining facility at the Lac à Paul site. Three are related to water 

management, one is associated with air quality and the last one to ambient noise levels. 

They are: 

• The installation and exploitation of the mining infrastructure and sites will imply 

significant modifications to the local water network, filling some of the smaller 

lakes and ponds as well as sections of existing streams, redirecting streams and 

overflows of some of the local lakes and ponds; 

• The open pit approach proposed for the mine implies the management of an 

unknown amount of groundwater that will infiltrate the pit. This water may contain 

contaminants in concentrations that will make it unfit to be released directly in the 

environment; 

• The processing of the extracted ore, the storing of the sterile material and of the 

excess material resulting from the processing of the ore at the concentration plant 

will result in waste water generated by the concentration process and the leaching 

of rain and snow melting through the piles of residues. This waste water may 

contain contaminants in concentrations that will make it unfit to be released directly 

in the environment; 

• The extraction of waste rocks and of the ore, the crushing and conveying of the 

crushed ore, and the trucking of the waste rock and the tailings in their final storage 

sites will generate dust that will be deposited downwind from the mining site on the 

local vegetation and soils. Depending on its composition, this dust could 

contaminate the soil's surface as well as affect surface water quality and the 

components of the local ecosystems (flora and fauna); 

• The use of dynamite and of various types of heavy machinery to extract and 

transport the rock and ore as well as crushing and conveying will be the source of 

noise and vibration that could affect existing activities (hunting, fishing, etc.) and 

the normal activities and habits of the local fauna.

20.3.2 Biological Issues 

The construction of the mine's components and infrastructure and its operation could be 

the source of six main biological issues affecting the flora and fauna of the Lac à Paul 

area. These issues include: 

• The loss of vegetation cover caused by the logging required for the site preparation 

at the construction stage; 

• The loss of terrestrial fauna habitat through vegetation cutting, excavation and 

backfilling as well as through the presence of the pit, plant and storage areas; 

• The loss of aquatic fauna habitat through the backfilling of some small lakes, ponds 

and local streams; 

• The potential perturbation of local fauna activities through the increase in noise 

levels, vibration generation and dust production; 

• The potential contamination of terrestrial and aquatic habitat through dust fallout 

generated by blasting activities, the manipulation of the sterile rocks and ore and by 

the preparation of the ore for concentration (crushing and sieving); 

• The potential contamination of aquatic habitat through inadequately treated waste 

water generated by the pumping of accumulating groundwater in the pit, by the 

concentration process of the ore and by the leachate generated by the piles of sterile 

rock and of residual material from the concentration process. 

20.3.3 Human Issues 

The construction of the mine's components and infrastructure and its operation could be 

the source of nine main human issues affecting mainly the territories use and access and 

the regional economy of the Lac à Paul area. These issues include: 

• Depending on the resulting modifications to the Mining Act imposed by the current 

review process, it is possible that the RCM will have to be contacted to obtain some 

authorizations to ensure that the mining activities proposed comply with their 

regulations; 

• Potential land use conflict with native communities related to traditional activities; 

• The potential disturbance of recreational activities such as cottages, fishing, hunting 

and outfitting operations; 

• The traffic increase on roads R0250, R0251 and R0253 may have an effect on the 

population using these routes to access their cottage and hunting/fishing territories 

(security and road degradation); 

• The improvement of the quality of the roads that will be used to access the 

exploitation area; 

• The distribution of the economic windfalls of the project which should benefit to as 

much of the regional population possible (job creation);

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

• The continuous implication of the population in the development process of the 

project through information dissemination and direct consultation of local and 

regional stakeholders; 

• The effect of the mining activities on the local and regional landscape (visibility of 

open pit and waste deposit piles); 

• The electrification of the of the exploitation area. 

20.4 Mitigation Measures 

Various mitigation measures have been included in the project design. Additional 

mitigation measures will be developed and identified in the environmental management 

plan during construction, operation and at the mine closure phase of the project.  

• As indicated in Section 18.2.1, a tailings storage facility has been designed for the 

project. The tailings storage facility will include a designated area for potentially 

acid generating magnetite tailings; 

• Location for waste rock material has been identified for both Paul and Manouane 

pits; 

• It is assumed that residual matters will be collected and hauled to the nearest waste 

management facility; 

• The requirements for site monitoring and water management as detailed in 

Guideline 019 for the mining industry will be met. 

20.5 Project Stakeholders List 

A stakeholders' list has been prepared and is based on a preliminary inventory of the 

governmental, community members and associations made by the "Chaire d'Éco-

Conseil" of the Quebec University of Chicoutimi (UQAC). These stakeholders should be 

involved in the information process of the project to ensure that general and specific 

concerns are identified and addressed. 

As mentioned above public meetings have been conducted by Ressources d'Arianne with 

the "Chaire d'Éco-Conseil" early in the project and they are expected to continue as the 

project proceeds with further studies. Separate meetings are also being held with First 

Nations. 

20.6 Health and Safety 

Ressources d'Arianne intends to provide a safe work environment as well as the 

necessary material and training to enable its employees to work safely. Permanent and 

effective programs will be developed and standards and methods will be adopted to 

ensure compliance with laws and enforce regulated standards.  

Provision for a nurse aid station is provided in the change house facility.  

Provision for a fire truck, an ambulance and an emergency vehicle are provided in the 

capital cost estimate.

20.7 Environmental Characterization 

Geochemical testing was conducted on mine rock and tailings samples to give a 

preliminary assessment of the metal leaching and acid rock drainage (ML/ARD) potential 

of mine wastes generated by the project.  

Static testing consisted of acid-base accounting (ABA) and total metal analysis. 

Radioactivity tests were also performed. The metal leaching test was performed 

according to the TCLP EPA 1311 method as per Guideline 019 requirements. These tests 

were completed on four (4) samples from Paul Zone: one waste rock sample, one ore 

sample and on two tailings samples, one from the magnetic fraction of the tailings and 

one from the flotation tailings. 

Requests were made to Maxxam International Analytic Corporation, located in Québec 

City, to perform these tests.  

20.7.1 Acid-Base Accounting 

Acid-base accounting (ABA) determines the neutralization potential (NP) and acid 

potential (AP) of a sample. These values are used to determine the samples Net Potential 

Ratio (NPR, where NPR = NP/AP). Samples with an NPR<1 are considered to be likely 

acid generating, whereas values of NPR <2 are considered possibly acid generating. 

Materials with NPR >2 have a low potential for ARD, and samples with NPR>4 have no 

potential for acid generation. 

Preliminary acid-base accounting data have been gathered and only the magnetic tailings 

sample can be considered possibly acid generating.  

20.7.2 Radioactivity 

The tests performed on both magnetic tailings and flotation tailings samples show very 

low values, below detection at level stated, that do not reach the threshold for radioactive 

tailings as identified in the "Guide de caracterization des résidus miniers et du minerai"
5
. 

Based on these results, radioactivity will not be an issue in the context of this project. 

Results are detailed in the Pre-Feasibility Study report. 

20.7.3 Leaching 

Leaching tests as per TCLP 1311 (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure) were 

performed on all samples and results are given in Table 20.1. 

Results indicate that water quality parameters are not expected to exceed Surface Water 

criteria or "Directive 019" criteria.

20.8 Mine Closure and Rehabilitation 

20.8.1 Introduction 

As stipulated in the current Mining Law, a rehabilitation plan will have to be prepared. 

The rehabilitation and restoration plan will have to be developed in accordance with the 

provincial Guidelines for preparing a mining site rehabilitation plan and general mining 

site rehabilitation requirements (MRNF and MDDEP, 1997). The economic analysis of a 

mining project will have to take into account the costs required for mine closure.  

Furthermore, Project Law 14 to modify Quebec Mining Law (May 2011), suggests 

additional means to ensure the restoration of mining sites. The Project Law 14 proposes 

that the coverage of estimated costs of rehabilitating the accumulation areas be increased 

to 100% and that the security payment schedule be accelerated into 3 payments (50%, 

25% and 25% of total costs) starting Year 1. Provision has therefore been made in the 

economic analysis for the disbursement of 100% of the estimated cost of rehabilitation of 

tailings storage facility and waste rock dumps in the first three years of the project. 

The closure plan, that needs to be approved before the onset of the operations, will need 

to address the following items: 

• Securing the mining area; 

• Dismantling the infrastructures; 

• Reclamation of waste rock disposal areas; 

• Reclamation of tailings management facility; 

• Contaminated waste characterisation and disposal; 

• Waste water management; 

• Emergency plan and monitoring. 

Preliminary closure plan costs have been estimated based on the rehabilitation of the 

tailings disposal area and the waste rock disposal area.  

20.8.2 Closure Cost 

Based on the accumulation areas identified in Table 20.2 the total cost for the 

rehabilitation of the tailings storage facility and waste rock dumps has been estimated at 

$22.8 M.

20.9 Recommendations 

Meetings with Stakeholders should continue as the project progresses to Feasibility 

Studies. 

A summary table of Issues/Potential Impacts identified by Stakeholders should be 

maintained closely.  

A detailed schedule of environmental permitting requirement will need to be prepared. 

This schedule should be integrated in the Master Schedule of the project. 

Based on the preliminary characterization results obtained, it is recommended that at the 

Feasibility Study stage of the project the following be analyzed: 

• Increase the number of samples per type of material that requires environmental 

characterization;  

• Add the environmental characterisation of overburden material type to the database 

of results; 

• Add Manouane zone to the environmental characterisation of waste rock, ore, and 

process tailings;  

• Include Guideline 019 toxicity tests on process tailings decant water for both Paul 

and Manouane deposits.

concentrate production based on a milling rate of 50,000 tonnes per day. The estimate is 

based on Met-Chem's standard methods applicable for a pre-feasibility study to achieve 

the accuracy level of ± 25%. 

The capital cost estimate includes the work required to develop the mine, to build the ore 

processing facilities to process the ore, and to establish all site and off-site infrastructure 

and services necessary to support the mine operation. 

The off-site facilities include the concentrate transportation and stockpile/railcar load-out 

facility. The concentrate transportation facilities consist of the transport trucks and 

trailers, the Mistassini River conveyor bridge and rail spurs and sidings. The concentrate 

stockpile and railcar load-out facility consists of the stockpile and reclaim tunnel, and the 

railcar load-out.  

The base case was developed where the owner executes all the activities. In the 2011Pre-

Feasibility Study for a 33,000 tpd milling rate, scenarios to analyze the effect of using a 

mining contractor for the mining activities and a subcontractor for transportation of the 

concentrate were evaluated but did not proved to be attractive at the time. Based on the 

metallurgical testwork results on processing ilmenite as a by-product to apatite 

beneficiation (refer to Section 13), an alternative was studied to add an ilmenite process 

circuit. This option was developed at a scoping study level and is further discussed in 

Section 22 (Economic Analysis). 

All duties and taxes are excluded from the capital cost, but are considered in the 

economic analysis. Escalation and interests incurred during construction are excluded 

from the Capital Cost. 

The effective date for the cost estimate is first quarter 2012. The estimate is expressed in 

US dollars.    

The estimate is currently in Revision H.  The pre-production initial capital cost for the 

base case scope of work is US$ 813.9 M, of which US$ 583.3 M is direct cost,  

US$ 136.1 M is indirect cost and US$ 94.5 M is contingency.  

The sustaining capital requirement is US$ 307.4 M. The total capital cost for the project 

life is US$ 1,121.3 M.  

The costs are summarized in Table 21.1. Details are provided in Pre-Feasibility Study 

report.

21.1.2 Basis of Estimate for Direct Capital Cost 

a) Currencies 

Updated indices were used for quotation received before first quarter of 2012. No 

allowances for escalation or currency fluctuation are included. The exchange rates 

used when quotations were received in foreign currencies are 1.00 CAD /1.00 USD 

and 1.44 CAD/1.00 EUR.  

b) Construction Labour 

The labour rate was developed for a typical crew from a detailed table of current 

rates developed by the Corporation des Entrepreneurs Généraux du Québec. The 

all-inclusive hourly rate is US$127, and includes the basic hourly rates for the 

tradesman, social benefits and employer's burden, industrial site premium, direct 

supervision, small tools and consumables, and contractor's overhead and profit. 

Indirect supervision is excluded from the hourly rate but is included in the 

construction contractor's site management provision. Similarly, workers 

transportation from the camp to the construction site is covered in owner's cost 

while transportation within the construction site is included in the construction 

contractor's mob/demob provision.

In addition to the labour cost, a construction allowance based on delivered 

equipment cost was established from similar projects to cover for construction 

material, sub-contract and mobile cranes. A factor of 5% is applied for all process 

areas except for the concentrator where 3% is applied. 

The working calendar was defined as one shift per day, 10 hours per day and 7 days 

per week for a total of 70 hours per week.  According to the Québec collective 

agreement for industrial construction, 40 hours are paid at regular rate while 

30 hours are paid as overtime. The typical turnaround would be 4 weeks in and 

2 weeks out, as majority of the workers will probably be coming from outside the 

region.  

The estimate is based on construction contracts attributed on the base of 

competitive bidding process amongst qualified contractors. It is also expected that 

an average level of site management, contract administration, quality control and 

adequate safety requirements will be required from the contractors by the 

construction management. 

Considering the working calendar, the type of project and availability of the 

workforce, a compounded factor of 1.07 was applied to the man hours to account 

for productivity loss with respect to specific conditions such as temperature, work 

schedule, adequate coordination between contractors, continuity of work flow, 

average number of changes to contracts, availability of experienced contractors and 

skilled workers, etc. 

c) Freight, Duties and Taxes 

Based on recent surveys and studies and when not included in the cost, the freight 

was accounted for by adding a factor of 11% to the value of the goods. All other 

duties and taxes are excluded from the capital cost, but are considered for the 

economic analysis. 

d) Contractor's indirect costs 

Provisions have been included to cover for the mobilisation and demobilisation of 

contractor's site establishment including owned and rented construction equipment, 

vehicles and other facilities such as trailers and lunch rooms, tool cribs, power 

panels, containers, maintenance of area, janitorial and clean-up. Special installation 

tools, cranes, scaffolding, cribbing and dunnage are also included as well as work 

place weather protection. Workers transportation within the construction site is also 

included in mob/demob. 

Provision have also been made for construction contractor's site management 

including high level supervision and support staff such as administration and 

procurement, coordination and scheduling, and quality and safety.

e) Mining 

The mine development costs were estimated using unit rates established for the 

production and the pre-development quantities taken from the mine schedule for the 

project.  

Budget prices were obtained from qualified suppliers or database from recent 

similar projects for the major, support and service equipment. Freight and erection 

of the equipment were either quoted by the suppliers or estimated as a percentage 

of the value of the equipment.  

f) Process 

The process facilities at the mine site include the crusher building, the crushed ore 

stockpile and reclaim tunnel, the main process building consisting of the grinding, 

the concentrator area, the mechanical shop, the office and lunch room and the 

laboratory area, the concentrate stockpile and reclaim tunnel as well as the truck 

load-out facility. 

The process facilities off-site include the concentrate stockpile and reclaim tunnel 

as well as the railcar load-out facility. 

i) Civil Work and Concrete Quantities 

Quantities for civil work including site preparation, excavation and backfill, 

for concrete work including buildings foundations, slabs on-grade, elevated 

slabs and equipment foundations, were calculated from plan site and buildings 

layout and based on preliminary assumptions regarding geotechnical 

indication. It is to be noted that these quantities are planned to be re-evaluated 

once final soil conditions will be known. 

ii) Structural Steel and Buildings Quantities 

Preliminary structural steel and building quantities were calculated from 

layouts. 

iii) Budget Unit Prices 

The costs of the Civil, Concrete and Buildings Works were estimated by 

applying budget unit prices to the quantities. The budget unit prices were 

established based on recent similar projects. 

iv) Process Equipment 

The process equipment list was derived from the flow sheets.  For the main 

equipment, budget prices were requested from qualified suppliers based on 

datasheets, data tables or a preliminary technical description.  Excluding the 

Mistassini river conveyor that was estimated based on recent database 

estimation, more than 65% of the process equipment value is based on budget

quotes. The remaining equipment was estimated from databases from recent 

similar projects or in house estimation. 

v) Piping and Pipelines 

Process piping cost was established for each area by factorisation on delivered 

process equipment. Process pipeline costs were established from dimensions 

and budget unit prices from recent similar projects, estimation database and 

local conditions. 

vi) Electrical

diagram. Budget prices were established based on databases from recent 

projects. Quantities and costs for material as well as installation man-hours 

were also established based on recent similar projects. 

vii) Instrumentation 

Instrumentation, automation and communication costs were established for 

each area by factorisation on delivered process equipment. 

viii) Buildings Services and Supplies 

For each process area, buildings services and supplies were estimated by 

applying a factor to delivered equipment cost, based on recent similar 

projects.  

g) Tailings Management Facilities 

The tailings storage facilities were designed and estimated by Journeaux 

Associates. The budget estimate is included in the capital cost.  

h) General Services, Infrastructure and Anciliary Buildings 

General services such as fuel storage, fresh water and sanitary services, as well as 

general fire protection were estimated based on recent similar projects. 

Site preparation and site roads cost estimate was developed based on quantities 

derived from general layouts and budget unit price based on recent similar projects. 

i) Ancillary buildings and facilities 

Quantities were calculated from the layout for the garage and storage area and unit 

rates were applied to estimate the costs. 

Ancillary buildings and facilities such as the office complex, the change house and 

canteen, the permanent camp were estimated from recent similar projects. 

j) Access to Mine Site 

The main road will allow access to the mine site. Provisions have been made to 

upgrade the main road to meet the increase in year-round heavy traffic resulting

from the concentrate transport from the mine site to the storage and load-out near 

Dolbeau.  

k) Power supply, main substation and communication 

Requirements were established for the main power line and two scenarios were 

developed by Hydro-Québec. An early stage order of magnitude budget was then 

estimated by Hydro-Québec based on one of the scenarios. 

Requirements were established for the site distribution power lines. Estimation of 

the cost was based on quantities and prices for material as well as installation man-

hours, based on recent similar projects. 

Requirements were established for emergency power supply. A budget price was 

estimated based on recent similar projects. 

An allowance was made for the main communication tower based on recent similar 

projects 

Requirements were established for the main substation based on the power demand.  

Equipment budget prices and costs for material and installation were established 

based on databases from recent similar projects.  

l) Service Vehicles and Equipment 

An allowance was made for the service vehicles and equipment fleet based on 

recent similar projects.  

21.1.3 Indirect Costs 

A preliminary allowance for indirect costs is included in Table 21.1. This allowance 

should typically cover for the major items detailed here under: Project Development, 

Project Implementation, Financial Costs and Closure Costs.

This manpower level accounts for duplication for staff employees on rotation. 

21.2.4 Mining 

The mine operating cost was estimated for each period of the mine plan. This cost is 

based on operating the equipment, the manpower associated with operating the mine, the 

cost for explosives as well as dewatering, road maintenance and other activities. 

In order to determine the operating cost, the following assumptions were used; 

• Diesel Fuel Price – 1.0 US$/l; 

• Electricity – 0.05 US$ / kWh; 

• Explosives Cost - 0.23 US$/t plus a fixed annual cost of US $ 1,142,076; 

• Dewatering – 200,000 US$/year; 

• Mine Road Maintenance – 100,000 US$/year; 

• Concentrate Transport Road Maintenance – 1,800,000 US$/ year. 

The mine operating cost was estimated to average 1.97 US$/t mined for the life of the 

open pit mine. This cost is divided into 1.83 US$/t for ore, 1.54 US$/t for overburden and 

1.76 US$/t for waste. 

21.2.5 Ore Processing  

For a typical year at design processing rate, the operating costs for the process plant, 

which includes the crusher, are summarized in Table 21.4. These are subdivided into 

these components: labour, electrical power, consumables, reagents, material handling, 

laboratory/environmental/consultants and spare parts. These costs were derived from 

supplier information, Met-Chem's database or factored from similar operations.

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 General 

A preliminary economic analysis of the project (apatite concentrate production based on a 

milling rate of 50,000 tonnes per day) has been carried out using a cash flow model 

prepared in Microsoft Excel. The model is constructed using annual cash flows in 

constant money terms (first quarter 2012). No provision is made for the effects of 

inflation. As required in the financial assessment of investment projects, the evaluation is 

carried out on a so-called "100% equity" basis, i.e. the debt and equity sources of capital 

funds are ignored. Results are presented before and after taxation.  

The model reflects the base case macro-economic and technical assumptions given in this 

report on the basis that the owner will own and operate the mining equipment. 

22.2 Assumptions 

22.2.1 Macro-Economic Assumptions 

The main macro-economic assumptions used in the base case are given in Table 22.1.  

The average phosphate price of 175 US$/tonne of concentrate is based on the 85% BPL 

Russian prices over recent years with consideration of the September 2011 CRU 10-year 

outlook report
6
 on the phosphate rock market.   

The sensitivity analysis examines a range of phosphate prices 30% above and below the 

base case price.  

Table 22.1 – Macro-Economic Assumptions 

Item Unit Base Case Value 

Phosphate Concentrate Price US$/tonne 175 

Exchange Rate CAD$/US$ 1.00 

Life of Mine (Paul zone and Manouane zone) years 17 

Discount Rate 1 % per year 8.0% 

Discount Rate 2 % per year 10.0% 

The current Canadian tax system applicable to mining income is used to assess the 

project's overall annual tax liability. This consists of federal and provincial corporate 

taxes as well as provincial mining taxes (mining taxes in Québec, were revised in the 

2010 budget). The federal and provincial corporate tax rates currently applicable over the 

project's operating life are 15.0 % and 11.9 % of taxable income, respectively. The rate 

applicable for the purpose of assessing mining taxes is 16 % of taxable income. 

The discount rate variants used to determine the net present value of the project is 

assumed to represent the weighted-average cost of capital.

22.2.2 Mineral Royalties 

No provision for mineral royalties is included in the present cash flow analysis. 

A 1% NSR remains on 2 privately owned claims. In lieu of this NSR payment, a buyout 

amount of US$ 700,000 was included in the Project Development Owner's Cost of the 

project capital expenditures.   

22.2.3 Technical Assumptions 

The main technical assumptions used in the base case are given in Table 22.2. 

Table 22.2 – Technical Assumptions 

Total Ore Mined (Life Of Mine) M tonnes 307.1 

Average Ore Grade to Mill % P2O5 6.59 

Concentrate Grade % P2O5 38 

Total Tonnes of Concentrate Produced M tonnes 47.2 

Processing Design Rate Tonnes/day 50,000 

Average Process Recovery over Mine Life % 88.7 

Average Mining Operating Cost  ($ / tonne mined) 1.97 

Average Process Operating Cost ($ / tonne milled) 8.10 

Average General & Administration Cost  ($ / tonne concentrate) 4.12 

Average Concentrate Transport Operating Cost  ($ / tonne concentrate) 10.42 

On average, 18.6 Mt of run of mine ore will be supplied per year to the process plant 

when full production is reached. The amount of concentrate produced is a function of 

head grade and recovery and thus varies from 2 M tonnes to 3.1 M tonnes per year. The 

process recovery for the Manouane zone ore is slightly lower than that of the Paul zone 

ore. 

22.3 Financial Model and Results 

A summary of the base case cash flow results is given in Table 22.3. 

The cash flow statement for the base case is given in Figure 22.1. 

This summary indicates that the total pre-production capital expenditure was evaluated at 

US$ 813.9 M and the sustaining capital requirement was evaluated at US$ 307.4 M for a 

total project capital expenditure over the project life of US$ 1,121.3 M.  

For taxation purposes, all contingencies as well as owner's and contractor's indirects 

were redistributed by area in the cash flow statement of Figure 22.1. The cash flow 

statement shows a capital cost breakdown by area and provides a preliminary capital 

spending schedule over a 2-year pre-production period. 

A working capital equivalent of 3 months of total annual operating costs is maintained 

throughout the production period.

A total of US$ 22.8 M was added for mine reclamation purposes. The total operating cost 

was estimated at US$ 4,274.6 M for the life of the mine or $ 13.9 / tonne milled.  

The financial results indicate positive before-tax Net Present Values (NPV) of

22.4 Sensitivity Analysis 

A sensitivity analysis has been carried out, with the base case described above as a 

starting point, to assess the impact of changes in phosphate concentrate price, total pre-

production capital costs and operating costs on the project's NPV (@ 8% and 10%)  and 

IRR. Each variable is examined one-at-a-time. An interval of 30% with increments of 

10% was used for all three variables. 

The before-tax results of the sensitivity analysis, as shown in Figure 22.2 to Figure 22.7 , 

indicate that the project's before-tax viability is not significantly vulnerable to the under-

estimation of capital and operating costs, taken one at-a-time. The net present value is 

more sensitive to variations in operating expenses, as shown by the steeper curves. As 

expected, the net present value is most sensitive to variations in price. As seen in , a 

reduction of about 23% in the price forecast (from $175 to $135 per tonne) results in a 

break-even net present value @ 10%. Similarly in Figure 22.4, the price curve intersects 

the bold horizontal line (10% IRR break-even) at a relative variation of about -23%. In 

contrast with Figure 22.2 and Figure 22.3 which show linear variations in net present 

value for the three variables studied, variations associated with internal rate of return 

shown in Figure 22.4 are not linear.

The after-tax results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Figure 22.5 to Figure 22.7. 

Figure 22.5 and Figure 22.6 indicate that the project's after-tax viability is mostly 

vulnerable to a price forecast reduction while being less affected by under-estimation of 

capital and operating costs. A reduction of about 17% in the price forecast (from $175 to 

$145 per tonne) results in a break-even net present value @ 10% as shown in Figure 22.6. 

Figure 22.7, which shows variations in internal rate of return, provides the same 

conclusions. Here, the price curve intersects the 10% IRR break-even line at the same 

relative variation of about -17%.

22.5 Additional Scenarios 

22.5.1 Introduction 

Efforts have been made to identify additional scenarios to improve the economics of the 

project. In the original Pre-Feasibility Study for a 33,000 tpd milling rate, scenarios to 

analyze the effect of using a mining contractor for the mining activities and a 

subcontractor for transportation of the concentrate were evaluated but did not proved to 

be attractive at the time.  

Based on the metallurgical testwork results on processing ilmenite as a by-product to 

apatite beneficiation (refer to Section 13), preliminary process design criteria were 

developed for an ilmenite process at a scoping level capital cost estimate. A preliminary 

evaluation of developing Lac à Paul based on a combined apatite/ilmenite process was 

first prepared.  The option of adding the ilmenite circuit a few years after commissioning 

of the apatite beneficiation plant is also addressed.  

Results are preliminary and will need to be further developed as the project advances to 

further stages. Issues such as additional metallurgical testwork as well as price and 

market study will need to be addressed to determine if an ilmenite concentrate at a  

45% TiO2 grade would be marketable.   

22.5.2 Combined Apatite and Ilmenite Processes 

An option to develop the Lac à Paul project based on a combined apatite/ilmenite process 

circuit was evaluated. The proposed process includes magnetic separation, re-grinding, 

flotation, filtration and drying of the ilmenite concentrate. The feed of the ilmenite 

concentration circuit consists of the apatite flotation tailings. Preliminary testwork 

indicate the at an average milling rate of 50,000 t/d of ore, the ilmenite processing circuit 

would produce approximately 4,400 t/d of ilmenite concentrate grading about 45% TiO2 

at a 50% recovery. 

A scoping level capital estimate of this combined apatite-ilmenite process was prepared.   

A combined apatite-ilmenite process operating cost estimate of 12.24 $/tonne milled was 

developed for this analysis.  

In the absence of a price and market study for ilmenite concentrate cash flows and 

economics were developed based on three (3) ilmenite concentrate prices (Scenario A): 

80, 100 and 150 $/tonne of concentrate. 

As indicated in Table 22.4, this scenario would improve the economics of the project 

only if the ilmenite selling price is above 100 $/tonne and can reach 150 $/tonne.

22.5.3 Delayed Introduction of Ilmenite Circuit 

The scenario of introducing the ilmenited circuit a few years after commissioning of 

apatite process was analysed. 

The scoping level capital cost estimate of an ilmenite circuit was introduced in the cash 

flow analysis as a sustaining capital in Year 4 in order to start production in Year 5. In 

this case, construction of the ilmenite circuit was assumed to be an independent stand-

alone building located North of the apatite process plant. 

The additional ilmenite process circuit investment cost of $ 288.4 M is added starting 

year 5. A combined average overall process operating cost of 11.32 $/tonne is used 

(combination of 8.10 $/tonne for the first few years of apatite only operation and 

12.24 $/tonne when the ilmenite circuit starts operating year 5) while the overall mine life 

average G&A cost would amount to 3.01 $/tonne of concentrate.

In the absence of a price and market study for ilmenite concentrate, cash flows and 

economics were developed based on three (3) ilmenite concentrate prices (Scenario B):

Preliminary results indicate that economics would improve the economics of the project 

by 3 points only if the ilmenite selling price is above 100 $/tonne and can reach  

150 $/tonne.

24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

24.1 Project Implementation Schedule 

24.1.1 Paul Deposit 

The project implementation schedule includes the main engineering, procurement and 

construction activities as indicated. The information contained in this schedule is derived 

from information taken from supplier's quotes or in-house database. The schedule 

presents the total duration of the project considering all additional metallurgical testing, 

Feasibility Study are completed first quarter (Q1) of 2013. 

According to the preliminary permitting schedule, it is assumed that if public hearing are 

required, the Minister's decision on the project can be expected March 2014. 

Long lead delivery process equipments and manufacturing capacity for specific type of 

equipment like grinding mills, mining equipments and others need to be considered in 

order to foresee the duration of a project. 

Emphasis should be made on: 

• Advanced procurement of long lead process equipment.  

• Infrastructure and site preparation engineering to satisfy the pre-stripping and 

construction phases. 

a) EPCM 

The main tasks to be accomplished during this phase are: 

 Engineering for the mine, mine infrastructure, tailings management 
facilities, site preparation, site infrastructure, process buildings, offices 

and off-site infrastructure (stockpile, conveyor bridge and load-out); 

 Procurement for the above including bid preparation and evaluation, 
organisation of site visits, contract preparation and contract 

administration; 

 Mobilize the construction management team to site, provide site assistance 
when needed and supervise dry and wet commissioning and ramp-up.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The Lac a Paul property with the Paul, Manouane and Zone 2 resources in addition to the 

newly drilled discovered Nicole, Traverse, Lise and Lucie shows it has not being drilled 

out to its full extent. 

All the above listed zones deserve additional drilling in the following priority: Paul, 

Nicole, Lucie, Lise, Traverse, Zone 2 and Manouane. 

The new drilling at Paul confirms significant extension of mineralization near surface to 

the west and to the east. It is Author opinion that the company should focus on continuing 

extending the zone westward and eastward. The development of near surface to the west 

and to the east should assist in the reduction of the waste to ore ratio for the same amount 

of ore. The latest drilling at Paul has double the strike length of mineralization and it is 

still open at both extremities.  

In a conceptual approach of mining a potential pit in phases where waste rock would be 

placed in the completed open pit, the longer the pit is, higher are the chance of using this 

highly economic lower environmental impact the option becomes feasible. For this 

reason, the author recommends drilling of the Paul zone until it is closed in the western 

extension and the eastern extension. 

The new drilling at Paul and the drilled confirmed discovery at Nicole, Traverse, Lise and 

Lucie shows the property may hide higher than 1 Billion tonnes potential. Drilling is not 

sufficient to validate this number, however the fact that the mineralized zones respond 

well to the magnetic signatures and there are extensions of the drilling, it is clear that the 

current exploration is very limited in regards to available targets in this magmatic apatite 

rich anorthositic complex.  

Proven and probable mineral reserves were developed from the pit designs for the Paul 

and Manouane deposits. These mineral reserves which account for ore loss formed the 

basis of the mine plan that was prepared.  

The Paul pit includes 21.4 Mt of proven mineral reserves and 140.3 Mt of probable 

mineral reserves for a total of 161.7 Mt. The grade of the Paul deposit is 7.16 % P2O5. In 

order to access these reserves, 7.6 Mt of overburden and 163.2 Mt of waste rock must be 

removed, resulting in a waste to ore stripping ratio of 1.1:1. At the planned production 

rate of 18.6 Mt of ore per year, the pit contains roughly 9 years of mineral reserves. 

The Manouane pit includes 123.3 Mt of proven mineral reserves and 22.1 Mt of probable 

mineral reserves for a total of 146.0 Mt. The grade of the Manouane deposit is 5.95% 

P2O5. In order to access these reserves, 14.7 Mt of overburden and 70.3 Mt of waste rock 

must be removed, resulting in a waste to ore stripping ratio of 0.6:1. At the planned 

production rate of 18.6 Mt of ore per year, the pit yields roughly 7 years of mineral 

reserves.

The objective of achieving an apatite concentrate with grade > 38% and recovery  

> 90% P2O5 was achieved for both the bench scale lab work and the locked cycle tests. 

The pilot plant was unable to meet the objective for three main reasons: 

• The pilot plant feed was ground too finely, resulting in a poor selectivity;  

• Due to grind fineness, the sodium silicate depressant, Na2SiO3, was used frequently 

in dosage amounts that depressed the apatite as well as the silicates and aluminates;  

• Closed circuits made reagent dosage control much more difficult and often resulted 

in high depressant concentrations. 

It is expected, with a suitable grind and proper depressant dosages, that flotation 

performance of the pilot plant can achieve an apatite grade of 38.3% and a recovery of 

90.7%. 

The processing plant is designed to process an average of 50,000 t/d of ore to produce 

approximately 8,500 t/d of phosphate concentrate grading at about 38.0% P2O5 based on 

a concentrate recovery of 90%. A suitable process flowsheet includes crushing, grinding, 

magnetic separation, flotation, and concentrate thickening, filtering and drying. Mining 

equipment, tailings storage facility, concentrate transportation and load-out facilities as 

well as infrastructure and services have been added to complete the investment cost of the 

project.  

The total capital cost for the project life, at an accuracy level of ± 25%, is estimated at 

US$ 1,121.3 M where the pre-production initial capital cost is evaluated at US$ 813.9 M 

while the sustaining capital requirement is US$ 307.4 M. 

The life of mine average operating cost estimate is evaluated at 90.50 $/tonne of 

concentrate. 

Preliminary environment considerations have been addressed and legislative framework, 

environmental sensitive areas, issues and project stakeholders have been identified. 

Geochemical testing was conducted on mine rock and tailings samples to give a 

preliminary assessment of the metal leaching (ML) and acid rock drainage (ARD) as well 

as radioactivity potential of the tailings generated by the project. Testing results show that 

radioactivity will not be an issue for the project and preliminary environmental 

characterization indicates that only the magnetic fraction of the tailings can be considered 

potentially acid generating. 

Mine closure and rehabilitation cost have been estimated at US$ 22.8 M. 

The economic analysis of the project has demonstrated positive results at an estimated 

sale price of phosphate concentrate of $175/tonne. The financial results indicate a before-

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

26.1 Geology and Mineral Resources 

The author makes the following recommendations to focus on two aspects: the 

improvement of the available data and a working plan to further develop the property. 

26.1.1 Improvement to Available Data 

• In order to increase the precision of waste to ore ratio, the author suggests that 

specific gravity be measured in the footwall and hanging wall waste rock since 

some zones are ilmenite rich and specific gravity may be underestimated. 

• Prepare a geometallurgical study where behaviour of crushing and especially 

grinding is assessed in 3d across the deposit so energy and liberation of apatite is 

studied and the mill and mining sequence can be adapter accordingly.  

26.1.2 Work Program to Further Develop the Project 

The author is aware that Arianne has continued the drilling and is currently drilling on the 

drilling program prepared on June 2012 at the office of Arianne with the Author. This 

program aims at completing an indicated resource to be used for the feasibility study.  

Phase 1: A diamond drilling program for 20,000 m of NQ drilling is proposed. This 

program will serve the following two goals (this program is actually on going):  

• Increase the quantity and quality of resources in Paul; 

• Define variability within the zones to allow a better mine sequence forecast. 

Phase 2: A diamond drilling program for 25,000 m of NQ drilling is proposed to drill 

western extension to the end of the magnetic anomaly. This program will serve the 

following three goals:  

• Increase the quantity and quality of resources in Paul; 

• Define variability within the zones to allow a better mine sequence forecast; 

• Enable low stripping mining scenario with in pit waste filling, i.e. higher NPV and 

faster payback; 

Phase 3: A diamond drilling program for 30,000 m of NQ drilling is proposed. This 

program will serve the following three goals:  

• Enable preparation of a resources in Nicole, Lucie and Lise suitable for open pit; 

• Increase the quantity and quality of resources of the property; 

• Define variability within the zones to allow a better mine sequence forecast; 

This first phase program is estimated at four million dollars (4,000,000$) out of which 

100% should be dedicated to Paul (infill drilling, lateral extensions and infill drilling for 

lateral extensions).

Of course these recommendations are made without consideration of the market for 

exploration funds. This being said it is author opinion that completion of Phase 1 is a 

requirement for the success of the project. It is likely uncommon in the industry to stop 

drilling while the main deposit is open near surface at both ends. 

26.2 Mining 

Met-Chem has identified the following opportunities that should be studied as the Project 

advances to the Feasibility stage. 

• The sequencing of the Paul and Manouane deposits should be revisited with the 

intent of maximizing the project NPV (Net Present Value). The solution may be to 

mine both deposits concurrently; 

• Assessment and testing regarding pit slope analysis, hydrogeology, and waste rock 

dump stability will need to be performed to further validate the open pit mining 

technical parameters. 

26.3 Process 

Additional metallurgical testing will be required to bring the project to a Feasibility Study 

level. The testing performed to date indicated that: 

• Liberation analysis of the samples from the Paul and Manouane deposits need to be 

completed. 

• Grind times need to be completed to achieve the size determined in the liberation 

study.  

• Reagent dosages need to be adjusted, especially for the depressant sodium silicate, 

for optimized recovery and grade. 

Additional metallurgical testing will be required as the project proceeds to Feasibility 

stage: 

• Additional testwork to firm up design basis of both Paul and Manouane deposits;  

• Continue with testing of ilmenite as a potential by-product. 

26.3.1 Additional Testwork  

• Work indices: Crusher, Ball Mill and Rod Mill (CWi, BWi, RWi). To better define 

rock hardness and rock variability for each of the deposit; 

• Slime removal using cyclones instead of thickeners; 

• Delivery of 60 t from Paul deposit to the selected Laboratory; 

• Batch bench scale test work to make sure that this sample is responding well to the 

developed flowsheet; 

• Continuous Pilot Plant runs;  

• Prepare samples for vendors testwork (Stack Sizers, thickeners, filters, magnetic 

separations);

P:\2010-052\Texte\Rapports\50000 tpd\NI 43-101\2010-052 Lac a Paul 50ktpd PFS 43-101 FINAL.docx 

• Specific Gravity determination, Ore and Product bulk densities, Ore and product 

angle of repose, and other design parameters. 

26.3.2 Ilmenite Testing as a By-Product 

• Liberation analysis of the samples from the Paul and Manouane deposits; 

• Grind size determination for both Paul and Manouane deposits; 

• Batch bench scale test work for flowsheet development of apatite and ilmenite 

production of Paul deposit; 

• Lock cycle test (2) to confirm flowsheet for Paul deposit (cycles to be done until 

circulating loads are constant and/or equilibrium is reached); 

• Batch bench scale test work for flowsheet development of apatite and ilmenite 

production of Manouane deposit; 

• Lock cycle test (2) to confirm flowsheet for Manouane deposit (cycles to be done 

until circulating loads are constant and/or equilibrium is reached). 

26.4 Tailings Storage Facility and Water Management 

• Geotechnical work such as geotechnical drilling, seismic analysis, stability analysis 

is recommended in the Feasibility Stage to confirm assumptions used for the 

tailings storage facility design and waste piles in the Pre-feasibility assessment as 

well as to permit preliminary foundations evaluation for the plant facilities.  

• Rock mechanics as well as hydrogeological studies will be required to further 

confirm rock slopes, rock permeability, ground and underground water flows and 

water balance. 

• Testing of the tailings geochemical and physical/mechanical properties and 

behaviour is recommended, such as: 

 Geochemical properties testing: ABA (for acid generation), humidity tests 
(coarse and fine fractions), fresh and aged supernatant analysis (coarse and 

fine fractions); 

 Physical/mechanical properties testing: size distribution, specific gravity, 
Atterberg limits, proctor maximum dry density and optimum water 

content, maximum density by vibrator and by drying, minimum density, 

settling, low and overburden stress consolidation settlement. 

• Investigation for borrow banks for suitable materials for construction of the various 

dykes, pads and roads as well as concrete aggregates should be undertaken during 

the Feasibility Study to determine quantities available and distance from the various 

facilities. 

• Condemnation drilling will be required in the area of the Paul's mill tailings storage 

facility. 

• More detailed topographic survey of the site during the Feasibility Phase will 

enhance accuracy of the estimates and associated cost analyses.

26.5 Infrastructure 

Condemnation drilling will be required for Lac à Paul mine site and infrastructure 

location such as waste rock dump, primary crusher, process plant, buildings, etc. 

Manouane River, Lac Paul and groundwater hydraulics should be verified at Feasibility 

stage to determine available flow rates for plant make-up water. 

As the project progresses to Feasibility Studies more information regarding potential 

siting of the Dolbeau-Mistassini concentrate handling site and railcar loading station, 

regional development projects and municipal zoning should be gathered in order to reach 

the required level of detail for Cost estimate. Discussions should also be held regarding 

the proposed trestle bridge across the Mistassini River. 

26.6 Environment Considerations 

Meetings with Stakeholders should continue as the project progresses to Feasibility 

Studies. 

A summary table of Issues/Potential Impacts identified by Stakeholders should be 

maintained closely.  

A detailed schedule of environmental permitting requirement will need to be prepared. 

This schedule should be integrated in the Master Schedule of the project. 

Based on the preliminary characterization results obtained, it is recommended that at the 

Feasibility Study stage of the project the following be analyzed: 

• Increase the number of samples per type of material that requires environmental 

characterization;  

• Add the environmental characterisation of overburden material type to the database 

of results; 

• Add Manouane zone to the environmental characterisation of waste rock, ore, and 

process tailings. 

Include Guideline 019 toxicity tests on process tailings decant water for both Paul and 

Manouane deposits.
