Summary (Item 3) 

Property Description and Location 

The West End Deposit (or West End) is one of several gold deposits located within the Golden 
Meadows Project ("Golden Meadows" or the "Project") located near the historic mining town of 
Stibnite, Idaho.  Golden Meadows consists of approximately 8,135ac of unpatented federal lode 
claims, 230ac of unpatented millsite claims, 314ac of patented federal lode claims and 148ac of 
patented millsite claims.  The West End Deposit is located principally within six of the patented 
federal lode claims.  The deposit was seasonally mined for oxide gold, from 1984 to 1995 and is 
centered about Latitude/Longitude coordinates 44° 55'46"N and 115° 19'20"E.  The property 
lies about 95mi northeast of Boise, Idaho, 40mi east of McCall, Idaho, and about 10mi east of 
Yellow Pine, Idaho. 

Ownership 

Midas Gold Inc. ("MGI") is a privately owned corporation, which has assembled a large property 
position and historic exploration database at the Project.  The company owns or controls these 
mineral rights and lands under a variety of tenures.  None of the MGI holdings are subject to 
back-in rights.  None of the claims overlying the West End resource are subject to an NSR.  
Some of the mineralized claims outside of the West End resource are subject to a 5% NSR.  MGI 
has an option to purchase the full 5% NSR, which it has not yet exercised.  On December 7, 
2010, Vista Gold Corp. ("Vista") announced that it had entered into a letter of intent to combine 
Vista's Yellow Pine deposit, which Vista has reported as containing material gold mineral 
resources in the Golden Meadows project area, with Midas Gold's interests, in a new company 
("Newco").  As a result, Vista is to become a 35% shareholder of Newco.  Subsequent to this 
announcement, Newco was given the name MV Gold Corp. ("MV Gold").  In a yet to be 
completed transaction, MV Gold Corp. intends to list in Canada under the name Midas Gold 
Corp. ("MGC").  Collectively, MGI, MV Gold and MGC are herein after referred to as "Midas". 

Geology and Mineralization 

Mineralization associated with the West End Deposit has a primary structural control and a 
secondary lithologic control.  High angle, brittle fault structures have formed conduits that 
provided access to receptive sedimentary rocks for gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids.  The West 
End fault zone and adjacent calc-silicate units are the primary hosts of the gold mineralization at 
the West End Deposit.  The West End fault zone consists of three, major high angle faults, all 
striking at azimuth 30° and dipping 50 to 75° southeast.  The West End faults are referred to as 
the Hanging Wall, Middle and Footwall Faults.  The width of the fault zone, as measured 
between the Footwall and the Hanging Wall faults, varies from 100 to 300ft.  Several subsidiary 
structures extend southeast from the West End fault zone.  These include the Splay fault, Stibnite 
fault and related structures.  The subsidiary structures strike along azimuth 60 to 90° and dip 
steeply south.  Based on the relative offsets of the metasediments, the West End faults have 
experienced, right lateral and/or normal offset.  The calc-silicate units are referred to as the 
Upper Calc-silicate and the Lower Calc-silicate.  The units are nearly identical in composition 
and distinguished only by their relative stratigraphic positions.   

Gold mineralization occurs preferentially where either calc-silicate unit is cut by any of the West 
End or subsidiary faults.  The hanging wall fault tends to exhibit relatively more dilatant and

dispersed structures relative to the lower two faults and therefore has stronger mineralization.  
Open space fill quartz veins are closely associated with the faults and are indicative of higher-
grade zones of mineralization.  Overall, the resource area has a moderately deep level of 
oxidation focused about the West End fault zone.  The materials have been defined as an upper 
oxide zone and a lower sulfide zone.  The transition zone between the two is relatively thin and 
is not distinguished.   

Exploration 

All of the exploration drilling supporting the resource estimation of this report is historical, 
dating from the late 1970's through 1995.  The QP of this report, Dr. Bart Stryhas, was the chief 
geologist at the West End Gold Mine from 1988 to 1993 and was directly responsible for much 
of the exploration work on the West End Deposit.  Additionally, he reviewed in detail nearly all 
of the work conducted prior to 1988.   

The drilling at West End consisted of reverse circulation (RC) and core holes.  RC drilling was 
typically conducted with truck or buggy mounted drills under both dry and wet drilling 
conditions.  Once water was encountered within the drillhole, moderate to high water flow was 
common.  Core drilling was also completed by truck or skid mounted rigs using a standard mud 
system.  The majority of the holes are NQ diameter with a few being BQ.  Core was retrieved in 
a standard core barrel using a wire line system.   

At this time, the resource database for the West End Deposit is comprised of 622 drillholes 
totaling 181,783ft.  There are 517 RC holes and 105 core holes with several different naming 
sequences.  The RC drilling represents 86% of the samples.  The drillholes are generally oriented 
along sections at azimuth 300° and have a wide range of plunge angles.  The maximum drillhole 
depth is 845ft and the average is 290ft.  The current drilling covers 4,300ft of strike length and a 
maximum of 675ft down dip.  

Mineral Resource Estimation 

The mineral resource estimation is based on a geologic model consisting of five general rock 
types, which are cut by the three high angle faults.  The model blocks are 20ft x 20ft x 20ft in the 
x,y,z directions, respectively.  Each model block is assigned a unique specific gravity based on 
rock type.  All block grade estimates were made using 10ft down hole composites.  An Inverse 
Distance Weighting to the second power algorithm was employed to generate a categorical 
indicator grade shell based on a 0.01oz/t Au threshold.  An inverse distance weighting squared 
(ID2) algorithm was also used for the gold grade estimation.  The results of the resource 
estimation provided a CIM classified Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource.  The quality of 
the drilling and data is very good and the Mineral Resource was classified mainly according to 
the general drillhole spacing.   

The base case West End Mineral Resources are reported below at two different cut-off grades, 
depending on the material type.  The oxide material is reported in Table 1 at a 0.008oz/t cut-off 
based on a mining cost of US$1.50/t, a processing cost of US$5.00/t, recovery of 85%, G&A 
cost of $2.00/t and a US$1,200/oz Au value.  The sulfide material is reported in Table 2 at a 
0.016oz/t cut-off based on a US$1.50/t mining cost, US$20/t processing cost, 95% recovery 
G&A cost of $2.00/t and a US$1,200/oz Au value.  The mineral resources are confined within a 
conceptual Whittle® pit design based on the same parameters used for the cut-off grade and a 
50° pit slope based on historic mining practices.  Strip ratio of non-mineralized material versus

Conclusions and Recommendations 

 The West End Deposit of Golden Meadows has an Indicated mineral resource in excess 
of 1Moz of gold plus an additional inferred mineral resource in excess of 330,000oz of 
gold; 

 The combined oxide and sulfide resource from the West End warrants an expanded 
exploration/development program and a scoping level economic evaluation.  An 
estimated budget for the proposed exploration program totals to approximately US$5M; 

 The expanded exploration program should include additional drilling in order to:  

o selectively twin historic RC drilling with core holes to confirm reported assay 
results;

1 Introduction (Item 4) 
1.1 Terms of Reference and Purpose of the Report 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. ("SRK") was commissioned by Midas Gold Inc. (MGI) to prepare a 
Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) compliant Technical Report on Mineral 
Resources for the West End Deposit (or West End), which is one of several gold deposits located 
within the larger Golden Meadows Project (Golden Meadows or the Project) in Valley County 
near Cascade, Idaho.  MGI is a private junior gold exploration/development company.  MGI's 
principal asset is Golden Meadows.  The ownership of the Project was conveyed to MGI in 2009 
by way of several negotiated agreements with several underlying owners.  On December 7, 2010, 
Vista Gold Corp. ("Vista") announced that it had entered into a letter of intent to combine 
Vista's Yellow Pine deposit, which Vista has reported as containing significant gold mineral 
resources in the Golden Meadows project area, with Midas Gold's interests, in a new company 
("Newco").  As a result, Vista is to become a 35% shareholder of Newco.  Subsequent to this 
announcement, Newco was given the name MV Gold Corp. ("MV Gold").  In a yet to be 
completed transaction, MV Gold Corp. intends to list in Canada under the name Midas Gold 
Corp. ("MGC").  Collectively, MGI, MV Gold and MGC are hereinafter referred to as "Midas". 

Golden Meadows consists of approximately 8,135ac of unpatented federal lode claims, 230ac of 
unpatented millsite claims, 314ac of patented federal lode claims and 148ac of patented millsite 
claims.  This document discloses the current exploration status of the West End Deposit within a 
Technical Report, prepared according to NI 43-101 guidelines.  Form NI 43-101F1 was used as 
the format for this report.  The intent of this Technical Report is to provide the reader with a 
comprehensive review of the exploration activities and results based on 622 drillholes totaling 
181,783ft with 35,230 samples.   

This Technical Report is prepared using the industry accepted Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) "Best Practices and Reporting Guidelines" for disclosing 
mineral exploration information, the Canadian Securities Administrators revised regulations in 
NI 43-101 (Standards of Disclosure For Mineral Projects) and Companion Policy 43-101CP, and 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 11, 2005).  
MGI is authorized to file this report, subject to the usual requirements, with Canadian and US 
regulatory authorities. 

1.2 Reliance on Other Experts (Item 5) 

The Qualified Person (QP) of this Technical Report, Dr. Bart Stryhas, has examined the current 
data for the Project provided by Midas, and has relied upon that basic data to support the 
statements and opinions presented in this Technical Report.  In the opinion of this QP, the data is 
present in sufficient detail, is credible and verifiable in the field, and is an accurate representation 
of the West End Deposit.   

This Technical Report includes technical information, which requires subsequent calculations to 
derive sub-totals, totals, and weighted averages.  Such calculations inherently involve a degree of 
rounding and consequently can introduce a margin of error.  Where these rounding errors occur, 
SRK does not consider them to be material.

1.3.1 Site Visit 

On July 27, 2010, Dr. Stryhas traveled with Jed Thomas to the West End Deposit where they 
were met by Chris Dail, James Ebish and Kent Turner.  Approximately five hours were spent 
reviewing the core logging, sampling and QA/QC procedures from a nearby exploration drilling 
program.  Project maps and cross-sections were reviewed and a general site tour was conducted.  
The following day, Dr. Stryhas, Chris Dail and Jed Thomas traveled by 4-wheelers to the West 
End Deposit.  The area consists of several mined areas and partly backfilled pits with exposures 
of the West End faults and various host rocks exposed in the pit walls.  The West End Faults 
structures were inspected and the various rock units were reviewed.  The Stibnite Pit was also 
visited and strongly oxidized and mineralized material was seen in the pit walls.  All of the 
historic haul roads and most of the exploration roads have been reclaimed.  There is little to no 
evidence of any of the historic drill collars.  By midday on July 28, 2010 Dr. Stryhas and Mr. 
Thomas departed from the site.

2.3 Location of Mineralization 

The West End Deposit consists of gold-bearing zones in the West End fault zone and in the 
metasedimentary units and intrusives spatially correlated with the fault zone.  The known 
mineralization is all located within mineral concessions owned by Midas (Figure 2-3).   

2.4 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 

Midas has assembled a large property position at Stibnite, Idaho, totaling about 8,197ac of 
unpatented federal lode claims, 230ac of unpatented millsite claims, 308ac of patented federal 
lode claims and 149ac of patented millsite claims.  (Figure 2-3).  The company owns or controls 
these mineral rights and lands in the Yellow Pine District under a variety of tenures.  None of the 
Midas holdings are subject to back-in rights.  

Midas acquired 229 Federal Unpatented Claims by purchase from the previous owner in 2009.  
These include 46 Federal Mill Site Claims, totaling 230ac which carry surface use rights, but no 
mineral rights (Claim Group 1) and 183 Unpatented Federal Lode Mining Claims totaling 
approximately 3,361ac (Claim Group 2).  These claims require annual filings of Notice of Intent 
to Hold and/or Affidavits of Annual Assessment with appropriate County and Federal Agencies 
and currently carry annual maintenance fees of US$140 for each Mill Site Claim and US$140 for 
each Federal Unpatented Lode Mining Claim plus modest filing fees.  These filing and payments

have been properly made for the current filing year (through August 2011).  There is no 
underlying royalty on these federal lode claims. 

In addition to the purchased claims, Midas has acquired by staking on its own behalf an 
additional 177 Federal Unpatented Lode Mining Claims, totaling approximately 4,836ac since 
September of 2009 (Claim Group 3).  These mill site claims also require annual filings of 
Affidavits of Annual Assessment with appropriate County and Federal Agencies and currently 
carry annual maintenance fees of US$140 plus filing fees for each Federal Unpatented Lode 
Mining Claim.  Filings and payments have been properly made for the current filing year 
(through August 2011).  There is no underlying royalty on these federal lode claims. 

Midas acquired ownership of the "Bradley Patented Lands" by direct purchase of nine patented 
mining claims, totaling approximately 184ac, from the previous property owner in 2009 (Claim 
Group 4).  These lands are subject to a "5% NSR" royalty interest owed to the J.J. Oberbillig 
Estate.  This royal interest is currently under the control of MGI via a purchase option agreement 
with the J.J. Oberbillig Estate.  Property taxes on these Bradley Patented Lands are currently 
US$147/yr. 

Midas has secured a purchase option agreement from the J.J. Oberbillig Estate in 2009 to acquire 
ownership of 30 Patented Federal Mill Site claims totaling approximately 149ac, which include 
both Surface and Mineral Rights (Claim Group 5).  The surface right of portions of 30 of the 
Patented Federal Mill Site Claims was granted to Hecla Mining Company, however the mineral 
rights and right to explore and mine were retained to the J.J. Oberbillig Estate. 

Midas has also secured a purchase option agreement from the J.J. Oberbillig Estate in 2009 to 
acquire ownership and six Patented Federal Lode Claims totaling approximately 124ac (Claim 
Group 6).  The majority of the mineralization constituting the West End Deposit is located within 
these six patented Lode Claims.   

With respect to the two option agreements described above, Midas currently owes a total of 
US$200,000 to the J.J. Oberbillig Estate, due in five annual payments of US$40,000 each to 
complete the purchase option agreement.  The final payment is due in 2015.  Payments due the 
J.J. Oberbillig Estate are currently up to date.  Property taxes on these Oberbillig Patented Lands 
are currently US$578/yr. 

Midas has also secured a purchase option agreement from the J.J. Oberbillig Estate in 2009 to 
acquire the 5% "NSR" Royalty interest held by the J.J. Oberbillig Estate on certain patented 
federal lode mining claims in the district.  The claims subject to this royalty include the "Bradley 
Mining Company" claims acquired by Midas and certain claim also owned by the Bradley 
Mining Company, which are currently under a purchase option agreement with Vista Gold, Inc.  
Midas currently owes a total of US$800,000 to the J.J. Oberbillig Estate, due in five annual 
payments of US$160,000 each to complete the purchase option agreement.  The Final payment is 
due in 2015.  Payments due the J.J. Oberbillig Estate are currently up to date. 

In 2009, a 20% undivided interest in Midas' 5% NSR royalty under purchase option agreement 
from the J.J. Oberbillig Estate was assigned to Mr. Frank Duval, a Midas insider and major 
shareholder.  Mr. Duval subsequently relinquished that interest to Midas.

2.5 Property Boundaries 

Property boundaries are shown on the Project claim map (Figure 2-3).  The Oberbillig and 
Bradley patented lands have boundaries that were originally established by Federal Mineral 
Surveys and were clearly marked at the time of survey.  These monuments commonly consist of 
inscribed brass caps set securely in the ground with cement or iron stakes.  The corners were 
verified and re-marked and the perimeters were brushed and marked in the field during the 2009 
season. 

Locations of the monuments for the unpatented federal lode mining claims acquired by Midas 
commonly consist of 4 x 4 wooden posts that are embedded one foot into the ground.  On a 
rocky substrate, they may be supported by substantial rock cairns.  The posts are at least 5ft in 
length and typically marked with inscribed aluminum tags.  Location notices can be found at one 
of the four or more corner posts of the claim.  Trees at least 9in in diameter can also be used in 
place of wooden posts.  This is common practice in heavily timbered areas. 

2.6 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

2.6.1 Required Permits and Status 

The proposed Phase I exploration program consists of road and drill pad construction and drilling 
on both public and private lands.  There are different permitting requirements for activities on the 
respective public and private land holdings. 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Payette National Forest, Krassel Ranger 
District has jurisdictional authority over mitigating surface disturbance associated with 
exploration and mining-related activities on public lands within its administrative area.  The 
Idaho State Department of Lands, Payette Lakes Area District has jurisdictional authority over 
exploration and mining-related activities on private lands within its administrative area. 

Midas is currently conducting exploration in the West End area under United States Forest 
Service USFS plan of operations POO-NOI-2010-024118 and an Idaho State Department of 
Land (IDL) notice of intent. 

2.6.2 Compliance Evaluation 

At this time, Midas is in full compliance with all governing agencies and all applicable laws and 
regulations related to its work on the West End Deposit.  Midas staff have led staff of the Idaho 
Department of Lands, US Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine 
Fisheries Service onto the Project during ongoing activities and have received approval of the 
activities on the site.

3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography (Item 7) 

3.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 

The West End Deposit is located within the Salmon River Mountains of central Idaho.  The area 
consists of uplifted rocks of the Idaho Batholith deeply incised by the East Fork of the South 
Fork of the Salmon River.  The area is comprised of steep and rugged, forested mountains with 
narrow but flat valleys at an approximate elevation of 6,500ft; nearby mountains rise to an 
elevation of about 8,000 to 9,000ft.  The land is heavily wooded with fir and pine trees and 
underbrush is common.  A large forest fire burned much of the area in 2002 and 2007.   

3.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season 

The climate is characterized by moderately cold winters and mild summers.  Most precipitation 
comes as snowfall in the winter and rain during the spring.  Recent open pit, heap leach mining 
operations in the district were seasonal, commencing in April and being suspended in November.  
Historical open pit and underground mining activities were carried out on a year round basis.  
Weather records indicate that average precipitation is about 27.16 inches per year.  Average 
temperatures and precipitation are shown in Table 3.2.1.

3.3 Physiography 

The West End Deposit follows a SW-NE linear trend extending from Midnight Creek up and 
over a ridge top and then down into West End Creek.  Historical mining at the West End Deposit 
required a French Drain structure to keep West End Creek out of the lower portions of the 
northeast pit area and to keep surface flow from cutting into or percolating through the waste 
dumps.   

3.4 Access to Property 

The primary summer access is via paved road from Cascade to Landmark (Figure 2-1).  From 
Landmark, the single-lane, unpaved Johnson Creek road runs north to Yellow Pine, and from 



Midas Gold Inc  3-2 
West End Deposit - Golden Meadows Project   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 
 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 16, 2011 
West End Deposit_NI 43-1010 Technical Report_200900.020_20110216  

there, the Yellow Pine-Stibnite road runs east to the historic mining town of Stibnite, Idaho.  
Using this route, the trip from Cascade to Stibnite is about 75mi long.  

An alternate, low elevation year round access runs from Cascade to Warm Lake and then 
downstream along the South Fork of the Salmon River to the confluence of the South Fork and 
the East Fork of the South Fork Salmon River (EFSF), then upstream along the EFSF to Yellow 
Pine and onto Stibnite.  Using the alternate route, the trip from Cascade to Stibnite is about 85mi 
long.  

A second summer route starts at McCall, Idaho, and passes over Lick Creek Summit, then down 
the Secesh River drainage to its confluence with the South Fork of the Salmon River and up to 
the confluence of the South Fork and EFSF.  Using this second alternate route, the trip from 
McCall to Stibnite is about 62mi long.  Improved, gravel airstrips are located at Stibnite and on 
Johnson Creek, about four miles south of the town of Yellow Pine. 

3.5 Surface Rights 

Midas currently controls or owns a total of 457ac of private surface rights comprised of 308ac of 
Patented Federal Lode Mining Claims and 149ac of Patented Federal Mill Site Claims.  

3.6 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

3.6.1 Power Supply 

The nearest power lines are located at the town of Yellow Pine, roughly 10mi to the northwest.  
A large-scale mining and milling operation would likely require that power lines will need to be 
upgraded from the power generation facility at Cascade to Yellow Pine and a new power line 
would need to be constructed from Yellow Pine to the mining area. 

3.6.2 Water Supply 

Midas has four water rights in the district.  These water rights were transferred from the estate of 
J.J. Oberbillig and Bradley Mining Company.  A legal firm based in Boise, Idaho has determined 
their validity.  A summary of these water rights is listed below in Table 3.6.2.1.

3.6.3 Processing Site 

Large, relatively flat areas are present with the EFSF Salmon River Valley located 2.3mi south-
southwest of the West End Deposit.  Some of this land is private, controlled by Midas or other 
mining entities through options to purchase or outright, direct ownership.  Much of the land is 



Midas Gold Inc  3-3

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 16, 2011 
West End Deposit_NI 43-1010 Technical Report_200900.020_20110216  

public, controlled by the U.S. Forest Service.  Much of this public land is under a Power 
Withdrawal Status.  This is the area where past mine processing operations have occurred but 
there is no guarantee that these public lands could be used for a processing plant in the future. 

3.6.4 Tailings Storage Area 

Large, relatively flat areas could possibly be used for tailings storage in the valleys of Meadow 
Creek and the EFSF of the Salmon River.  Some of this land is private, controlled by Midas or 
other mining entities through options to purchase or outright, direct ownership.  Much of the land 
is public, controlled by the U.S. Forest Service.  Much of this public land is under a Power 
Withdrawal Status.  There is no guarantee that these public lands could be used for tailings 
storage in the future.   

3.6.5 Waste Disposal Area 

Historic mine dumps have typically been valley fill type or pit back fill.  There are several 
locations where mine waste could be stored.  Most of these are located on public lands, 
controlled by the U.S. Forest Service.  Much of this public land is under a Power Withdrawal 
Status.  There is no guarantee that these public lands could be used for tailings storage in the 
future.   

3.6.6 Manpower 

The nearest town, Yellow Pine, lies about 10mi to the west of the deposit.  It has a population of 
approximately 60 people during the summer months and limited services such as a general store, 
a restaurant and a few lodging facilities.  The nearby towns of McCall, Idaho and Cascade, 
Idaho, however, have a combined population of several thousand people with many diverse 
services available. 

Mining personnel would have to be brought into the area.  Skilled miners and mining 
professionals are generally unavailable locally.  Common laborers could likely be obtained 
locally from the towns of Cascade, Donnelly, and McCall, Idaho.

4 History (Item 8) 
4.1 Ownership 

During the early 1900's two major landowners were working the district.  The eastern part was 
partially consolidated by United Mercury Mines under the control of Mr. J.J. Oberbillig, whereas 
the western part was controlled by the Bradley Mining Company.  Ultimately, the Bradley 
Mining Company consolidated and operated most of the production in the district, first from the 
Meadow Creek underground mine and later from the larger, Yellow Pine open pit mine.  As part 
of that consolidation, the Oberbillig family received a 5% NSR on some claims mined by the 
Bradley Mining Company ground.  Mining claims associated with the Meadow Creek Mine and 
Yellow Pine Mine and their related operations were patented during this period.  Bradley Mining 
operated into the late 1950's and then ceased operations and dismantled the mine and mill 
infrastructure after a worldwide collapse in antimony prices.   

The district was dormant until the early 1970's when a sharp rise in gold prices and the advent of 
large-scale, heap leach processing technology for oxide gold ores revitalized exploration in the 
district.  Louisiana Land and Exploration Company first explored the area followed by El Paso 
Mining and Milling Company and ultimately Canadian Superior Mining took over.  They 
delineated much of what is now the West End Deposit and they brought the mine into production 
in 1982.  Canadian Superior Mining was ultimately acquired by the Superior Oil Company of 
Houston, Texas which, in turn, was acquired by Mobil Oil.  Mobil sold the West End Mine in 
1986 to a 50/50 joint venture of Pioneer Metals Corp. and MinVen Corp, both small Canadian 
registered companies.  Pioneer was the mine operator until it experienced financial problems in 
1990 and ownership was conveyed to Stibnite Mine Inc. (SMI), owned primarily by MinVen.  
MinVen later experienced financial problems and the mine was conveyed to Dakota Mining 
Company.  Operations in the district ceased after the 1997 season when Dakota Mining merged 
with USMX.  Rapidly dropping gold prices, internal company financial problems, increasing 
environmental and regulatory issues and delays in obtaining necessary operating permits led to 
the mine closure.  

In 1990, during the course of these operations, six lode claims and 30 mill site claims (including 
mineral rights) were patented with ownership going to the Oberbillig Family Estate.  The 
Oberbillig estate patented lands and their royalty interest on the Bradley estate is currently under 
a purchase option agreement with Midas. 

In 2006, much of the western portion of the district was staked by Niagara Mining and 
Development, a subsidiary of Gold Crest Mines Incorporated.  These unpatented claims 
surrounded the patented lands of both the Bradley and Oberbillig family estates.  Additional, 
unpatented claims were staked by Gold Crest in 2007 covering the eastern portions of the 
district.  The Gold Crest claims were all purchased by Midas in 2009. 

4.2 Past Exploration and Development 

A detailed history of the Stibnite mining area was chronicled by Mitchell (2000).  Gold 
mineralization was first discovered in the zone of oxidation along the West End Fault by Bradley 
Mining Company in the early 1940's during exploration focused upon replacement of reserves at 
their Yellow Pine mining operation.  A modern era of exploration and development stretched 
from the mid 1970's to the mid 1990's, prompted primarily by both the rise in gold prices and

the modern technology heap-leach oxide gold recovery.  Gold production during this period 
came from the West End, Stibnite, Garnet Creek, and Homestake deposits.  Total gold 
production during that period was about 600,000oz.  

4.3 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 

There are no historic mineral resource or reserve estimations that compare with the mineral 
resource estimation of this report.  Historic data files contain various estimations of oxide and 
sulfide resources of individual mineralized lenses within the West End area, but the resource 
estimates and supporting back-up data are incomplete and are therefore not reported here.

5 Geological Setting (Item 9) 
5.1 Regional Geology 

During the Middle to Late Proterozoic, the area was underlain by uplifted basement rocks.  
These units were eroding into the Belt Basin, a large intra-cratonic basin located to the north.  
The tectonics are believed to have remained relatively stable until approximately 1,350Ma when 
portions of the region were affected by compressional tectonics of the East Kootenay Orogeny.  
This orogeny was followed by rifting during the late Proterozoic-early Paleozoic when large 
portions of the Belt sediments were transported away and the western margin of North America 
was developed.  Over the next several hundreds of millions of years, the area comprised the 
passive margin of the North American Craton.  

The next major tectonic event occurred during the Cretaceous Sevier Orogeny.  Early 
compressional tectonics dominated the area forming large-scale folds, reverse and thrust faults.  
Many of these structures were focused along the Salmon River Suture Zone (Figure 5-1), a wide, 
but linear, north-south trending zone of complexly deformed rocks of highly variable 
composition.  It marks a major structural and crustal boundary approximately 60mi to the west of 
the Project area.  Rocks within the suture zone include volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks 
associated with the Blue Mountains Volcanic arc, sedimentary clastic rocks of the North 
American Continental Province, and the western margin of the Idaho Batholith.  The suture zone 
is interpreted as the zone along which the oceanic Blue Mountains Volcanic-arc was accreted to 
the North American continent.   

During the late Cretaceous, the Atlanta Lobe of the Idaho Batholith was emplaced throughout the 
area.  The western margin of the Idaho Batholith is metamorphosed and foliated parallel to the 
suture zone, which indicates that it was emplaced while the suture zone was still tectonically 
active.  The Atlanta Lobe consists of various types of igneous intrusive rocks, including early 
tonalite and foliated granodiorite (95 to 85Ma), porphyritic biotite granodiorite (88 to 82Ma), 
and late biotite-muscovite granite (78 to 72Ma), (Lund, unpub. data, 1997).  The study area is 
located near the western margin of the Atlanta Lobe, which is composed of early tonalite and 
foliated granodiorite.  The central part is composed of porphyritic biotite granodiorite and late 
granites are relatively common near its northern and eastern margins.  Metamorphic roof 
pendants, inclusions, and hydrothermal mineral deposits also are relatively common near the 
northern and eastern margins of the Atlanta Lobe.  Isotopic age determinations on late biotite-
muscovite granite have about the same range (78 to 72Ma) as age determinations on sericite 
from batholith hosted veins and silica-sericite altered rocks (mostly 79 to 69Ma, according to 
Gammons (1988).  This suggests that most batholith-hosted mineralization is related to 
intrusions of late two-mica granite of the Idaho Batholith.  That granite is peraluminous in 
composition and is interpreted here as an S-type granite, generated largely by partial melting of 
continental crustal metasedimentary rocks.   

Eocene Intrusions related to the Challis Volcanics Field are common near the eastern margin of 
the Atlanta Lobe.  These include dikes, dike swarms, and stocks.  The intrusions generally are 
porphyritic in texture and intermediate to felsic in composition.  They range in age from 51 to 
39Ma.  The Thunder Mountain Caldera Complex of the Challis Volcanic Field lies immediately 
southeast of the study area.  It consists of predominantly felsic volcanic, pyroclastic and 
epiclastic rocks that were erupted and deposited in subaerial and lacustrine environments during

Eocene time (51 to 43Ma).  Several, hot-spring type gold-silver deposits occur in the Thunder 
Mountain district.  

Pleistocene valley glaciers have carved U-shaped valleys with over-steepened, talus-covered 
sides, and hanging valley tributaries with cirques and tarns in their upper reaches.  U-shaped 
valleys also have lateral, terminal and recessional moraines, moraine-dammed lakes, and glacial 
outwash deposits at their lower ends.  Broadly glaciated areas have rounded hills with glacially 
scraped and scoured up-glacier slopes, ground-moraine covered down-glacier slopes.  Early 
Pleistocene moraines contain thoroughly decomposed boulders, whereas boulders in Middle 
Pleistocene moraines have weathered rinds, and boulders of Late Pleistocene moraines are 
relatively un-weathered. 

5.2 Local Geology 

5.2.1 Lithology 

The West End Deposit is hosted by metasedimentary rocks of the Stibnite roof pendant located 
within the Atlanta Lobe of the Idaho Batholith (Figure 5-2).   

Early workers believed that the rocks of the roof pendant were Proterozoic in age, partly because 
of their proximity to the Belt Sedimentary Basin.  However, recent work has determined they are 
Paleozoic in age.  Beales (1981) collected corals of Tabulata, a sub-class of Hexacoralla, from 
within the Stibnite Roof pendent, near the center of Section 12, T18N, R9E.  They were 
positively identified by Lintz (1981).  Tabulata lived from the Ordovician Era through the 
Pennsylvanian Period, thus identifying rocks of the roof pendant as being Paleozoic in age.  One 
bryozoan fossil was also found.  The earliest known bryozoans are from the early Ordovician 
Era.  

Smitherman (1985) constructed the first detailed stratigraphic column of the Stibnite roof 
pendant (Figure 5-3).  The metasedimentary rock units are divided into ten informal units.  They 
are, in ascending stratigraphic order: Quartzite-schist, Lower Calc-silicate, Fern Marble, Quartz-
pebble Conglomerate, Lower Quartzite, Upper Calc-silicate, Middle Marble, Middle Quartzite, 
Hermes Marble, and Upper Quartzite.  The following descriptions are based mainly on 
Smitherman's work. 

Quartzite-schist (Pqs) 

This unit is up to 460ft thick and is apparently the oldest unit in the area.  Exposures are confined 
to two northwest-trending belts; one along the northeast roof pendant border, and one extending 
through the center of the roof pendant.  Batholithic intrusives occur along the lower contact of 
the northeast belt and a major fault forms the lower contact of the central belt.  

Schistosity is moderately developed with 1 to 4ft thick interbeds of quartzite and schist.  
Intermediate lithologies between quartzite and schist are common and the unit is subdivided into 
quartz-mica schist, garnet-bearing quartz-biotite schist, and micaceous quartzite.  The aluminous 
quartz-mica schist consists of quartz-muscovite-biotite + andalusite + sillimanite + chlorite.  The 
garnet-bearing, quartz-biotite schist, outcrops south of the Hermes mine and within West End 
drillholes.  The quartz-biotite schist is 80% fine quartz, 10% biotite grains (in biotite rich layers) 
which define a foliation, and 2 to 3% almandine garnet porphyroblasts.  The micaceous quartzite 
contains over 90% quartz and 5 to 10% muscovite, which has developed a weak schistosity.  
Traces of biotite, sphene, zircon, tourmaline and opaque minerals occur as accessories.

West End Deposit_NI 43-1010 Technical Report_200900.020_20110216  

Lower Calc-silicate (Plcs)   

This unit is 175 to 900ft thick, consisting of thin-bedded, calc-silicate bearing rocks.  The contact 
between the quartzite-schist and the calc-silicate appears to be gradational.  Minor folds are 
common and probably account for much of the variation in thickness.  The unit contains grey 
quartzo-feldspathic layers with alternating green calc-silicate beds in the lower portion and light 
grey calcitic marble with green calc-silicate interlayers in the upper portion.  The dark layers are 
composed of fine oligoclase, microcline and quartz.  Xenoblastic epidote constitutes 20 to 90% 
of the calc-silicate layers, with minor hornblende, actinolite, and scapolite.   

The calcareous calc-silicate rock contains interlayers of calcite marble and calc-silicate rocks.  
Calc-silicate minerals include xenoblastic diopside, pale green tremolite/actinolite and minor 
scapolite.  Epidote occurs as very fine grains between the calcite and quartz-rich layers and as 
coarse grains with tremolite/actinolite intergrown with pyrite.  Accessory minerals include 
phologopite, rare sphene, and allanite.  Locally the rocks have been altered to a skarn assemblage 
of garnet-epidote-diopside, calcite, pyrite, and iron oxide. 

Fern Marble (Pfm)  

The Fern marble overlies the lower calc-silicate and reaches a maximum thickness of about 120ft 
near the Fern Mine.  The best exposures are located in the Fern mine area, where the rock is 
exposed in numerous trenches.  Fresh marble is light tan to white and commonly weathers to tan 
or yellow-tan.  The marble consists of coarse dolomite grains, rare quartz grains, and traces of 
brown amorphous material.  Green gray calc-silicate marble is locally common within 500ft of 
the batholith contact.  One specimen from the West End pit is composed of 60% green diopside, 
40% colorless to green tremolite/actinolite and rare phologopite, forsterite and dolomite or 
calcite.   

Quartz-pebble Conglomerate (Pqpc) 

The quartz-pebble conglomerate is a coarse-grained, pebbly quartzite unit, which contains lenses 
of pebble conglomerates and bodies of quartz-mica schist.  The depositional contact with the 
Fern marble is well exposed northeast of the Fern mine.  The quartz pebbles are coarse, irregular 
to polygonal, grains with flattened quartz grains and muscovite as the matrix.  Small schist lenses 
occur locally, and consist of quartz-muscovite, biotite, sillimanite, and andalusite. 

Lower Quartzite (Plq)  

The quartz-pebble conglomerate unit grades upward into a 300 to 560ft thick, muscovite-bearing 
quartzite.  The quartzite is typically light gray to with and commonly show dark gray streaks 
which appear to be relict bedding.  Outcrops are large and bold occurring along ridges and on 
slopes.  The rock weathers into large blocks and vast talus fields.  Thin sections show that the 
quartzite is 95% fine to very coarse-grained quartz.  Muscovite grains make up to 5 to 10%, 
quartz is up to 85%, and andalusite may be 2%.   

Upper Calc-silicate (Pucs) 

South of the West End pit, along the ridge to the southwest of Midnight Creek, is an area where 
calcitic marble occupies the hinge of a major syncline.  The upper calc-silicate consists of biotite, 
plagioclase, calc-silicate rock.  The unit varies from about 100ft to about 375ft, likely due to 
thick zones of tight folding (plastic deformation).  The internal stratigraphy of the unit includes 
four sub-units.  



Midas Gold Inc  5-4

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 16, 2011 
West End Deposit_NI 43-1010 Technical Report_200900.020_20110216  

The lower, plagioclase calc-silicate rock is dense, laminated, dark-gray and weathers to gray or 
red-brown.  Thin sections show 70% plagioclase, 10% diopside, 10% tremolite/actinolite, and 
5% fine-grained biotite.  The middle, plagioclase-biotite rock is similar to the lower unit with the 
addition of plagioclase-biotite layers.  The upper unit is a massive calcareous, plagioclase calc-
silicate rock with 35% labradorite, 30% scapolite, 30% diopside, and minor calcite.  The 
uppermost unit is a laminated calc-silicate and calcitic marble rock.  This unit varies up to 200ft 
in thickness on northern limb of the syncline.  The calc-silicate layers form thin (1/2in) ribs 
above the easily weathered marble layers.  Minor interbedding folds are common.  The calc-
silicate layers are about 50% scapolite and 50% fine diopside grains.  The marble layers are 
approximately 3/4in thick and contain over 95% calcite with minor scapolite and diopside.   

Middle Marble (Pmm)   

The upper calc-silicate unit grades upward into this 260 to 500ft thick calcitic marble unit.  The 
unit is a light gray thin bedded (1in) laminated marble.  The rock is 80 to 99% calcite with minor 
biotite, diopside, and graphite.   

Middle Quartzite (Pmq)   

A 30 to 250ft thick quartzite unit lies above the middle marble.  This is a light gray, fine-coarse 
grained, vitreous quartzite.  Accessory minerals are K-feldspar, alunite, sericite, graphite, 
leucoxene, zircon, and iron oxide.  The rock is locally very porous due to hydrothermal leaching, 
and sparse alunite grains probably formed during hydrothermal activity.  Carbonate cement is 
locally present, as well as rare biotite schist bodies near the lower contact. 

Hermes Marble (Phm)   

200 to 300ft of dolomite marble overlies the middle quartzite.  The lower 200ft is a light gray 
massive dolomite marble.  This contains 80% dolomite, and 20% altered tremolite 
porphyroblasts.  The alteration is probably hydrothermal and resulted in clay replacing 90% the 
tremolite.  Minor pyrite and iron oxide are locally present.  The upper portion is a gray, 
laminated marble that has essentially the same mineralogy, but generally unaltered. 

Upper Quartzite (Puq) 

Overlying the Hermes marble is a quartzite and minor silitite unit.  Thickness varies from 1400 
to 2,200ft.  The unit forms large, bold outcrops of cliffs and ridges.  In thin section the quartzite 
is nearly pure quartz with less than 3% muscovite, locally black quartzite contains intergranular 
graphite.  Accessory minerals include zircon, magnetite, sericite, and secondary iron oxide, after 
pyrite.  Laminated gray siltite occurs in the upper portion of the unit.  The siltite is composed of 
70 to 90% fine quartz grains, with the remaining 10 to 30% biotite and minor muscovite.  Tiny 
quartz veinlets are locally common, with related iron oxide.  A dark gray, streaky mylonite is 
locally present along northwest trending faults.  The mylonite has been extensively replaced by 
chalcedony, pyrite, and iron oxide. 

Igneous Rocks 

Intrusive igneous rocks fall into two major categories; those associated with the Atlanta Lobe of 
the Idaho batholith and those related to the Challis Volcanics.  The Atlanta Lobe of the Idaho 
Batholith occurs along the roof pendant margins represented by a medium-grained biotite 
granodiorite (along the northeast margin of the roof pendant) and a coarse-grained two-mica 
granite (western margin of the pendant).  Small bodies, sills and dikes of biotite granodiorite

West End Deposit - Golden Meadows Project   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 
 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 16, 2011

occur within the roof pendant, as well as abundant aplite and pegmatite dikes.  Coarse grained, 
two-mica granite has a more prominent foliation defined by biotite grains.  The granite contains 
26% quartz, 37% oligoclase, and 30% microcline, 6% biotite, and 1% muscovite.  Accessory 
minerals include magnetite, zircon, iron oxide, and sericite after oligoclase.   

The Challis Volcanics occurs as porphyritic dikes of rhyolite, andesite, latite (biotite andesite), 
and trachyte.  Phenocrysts include sanidine, andesine, biotite, and rare quartz.  The groundmass 
is fine plagioclase laths, and fine-grained biotite.  A small exposure of micro-brecciated 
sanidine-biotite trachyte is present about 2,000ft east of the West End Deposit.  The microbreccia 
suggests that faulting was active during the intrusion of the porphyritic breccia. 

5.2.2 Structure 

The West End fault zone is the predominant structure associated with the West End Deposit.  
The fault zone consists of three high angle faults, all striking at azimuth 30° and dipping 50° to 
75° southeast.  The West End faults are referred to as the Hanging Wall, Middle and Footwall 
Faults.  The width of the fault zone as measured between the Footwall and the Hanging Wall 
faults, varies from 100 to 300ft.  Several subsidiary structures extend southeast from the West 
End fault zone.  These include the Splay fault, Stibnite fault and related structures.  The 
subsidiary structures strike along azimuth 60 to 90° and dip steeply south.  Based on the relative 
offsets of the metasediments, the West End faults have experienced, right lateral and/or normal 
offset.  The gold mineralization occurs preferentially where the calc-silicate units are cut by any 
of the West End or subsidiary faults.  The Hanging wall fault tends to exhibit relatively more 
dilatant and dispersed structures relative to the lower two faults and therefore has better 
mineralization.  Open space fill quartz veins are closely associated with the faults and are 
indicative of higher-grade zones of mineralization. 

5.2.3 Alteration 

Secondary silica, as veins and disseminations, is the most pervasive alteration of the mineralized 
material.  Silica has replaced and permeated the rock within and near the major fault zones, in 
places silica is over 90% of the rock mass.  Quartz occurs in stockwork veins and veinlets, as 
disseminations, in coliform bands, and with reticulate textures.  Vugs formed by leaching of 
feldspar grains or formed in extensional fractures are either partially filled with euhedral quartz + 
scheelite + gold and commonly with Mn and Fe oxides, or they are completely filled with 
secondary quartz, forming a quartz-eye pattern in the rock (Cookro, 1988).   

Plagioclase is commonly sericitized, although not necessarily in the mineralized zones.  Feldspar 
grains are commonly argillized in the fault zones.  Clay minerals that formed from the alteration 
of feldspar grains are commonly leached out, and the resulting void is filled with euhedral clear 
quartz.  Altered silicates were an important source of secondary silica. 

Dark biotite grains in unaltered granodiorite are only remnant shreds in the altered rocks.  The 
most common opaque minerals occurring in replaced biotite are arsenopyrite, pyrite, and 
pyrrhotite. 

Calcite occurs as discreet grains in metasedimentary inclusions within the batholith, and as 
crystalline calcite in veins and breccia infillings.  The calcite veins and fillings are probably 
hydrothermal in origin.  The hydrothermal calcite is sometimes dark in color and contains Mn 
and Fe oxides and abundant opaque minerals, which include fine grains of arsenopyrite and

pyrite.  This type of calcite is preferentially replaced by scheelite, sometimes massively replaced 
and resulting in very high-grade tungsten ore. 

In the West End Deposit, gold concentrations occur within fractured, metasedimentary rocks.  
Although calc-silicates are the most favorable host rocks, all lithologies contain zones of ore-
grade mineralization and broad areas of anomalous concentrations of gold.  Submicron-sized 
native gold, which occurs along fractures and disseminated in highly fractured zones, makes up 
the ore (Lasmanis, 1981).  Dikes of porphyritic dacite, or latite, are present in the mine area and 
contain stockwork quartz-sulfide veins; the dikes are also within the ore bodies (Lasmanis, 1981) 

Paragenesis of the Au-W-Sb mineralization in the district is complex.  Petrographic and 
geochemical data show that fractures are the major control on the deposition of metal.  Ar/Ar and 
K-Ar age determinations suggest at least two different alteration events, in the late Cretaceous 
and Eocene.  Oxygen isotope and deuterium/hydrogen isotopic ratio data suggest mineral fluids 
of both deep and shallow origin and temperatures less than 200° C (Cookro and Silberman, 
1987).  The trace metal assemblage, Au-Ag-As-Sb-Hg-W is characteristic of epithermal deposits 
(Berger and Eimon, 1983).

6 Deposit Type (Item 10) 
6.1 Geological Model 

The origin of mineralization at West End is related to hydrothermal processes formed within an 
epithermal environment.  Epithermal deposits are generally believed to have developed by 
ascending fluids of igneous emanations.  They typically are formed at depths less than 3,300ft 
under low confining pressures with temperatures up to 300°C.  Veins are the most common host 
but disseminated mineralization also occurs.  Gold and silver are the most common ore minerals 
with silver typically more abundant than gold.  The gangue mineralogy is typically quartz and 
calcite, at depth adularia can occur.  Hydrothermal alteration is pronounced, with abundant 
silicification flanked by clay alteration (Panteleyev 1988). 

The gold mineralization at West End occurs in metasedimentary rocks intruded by the Idaho 
Batholith and within the intrusive rocks.  The metasediments occur as pendants and xenoliths.  
Strong mineralization is localized along a northeast-striking fault zone, and splays faults that 
strike northeast and east.  Pull-apart fracturing along dilatant northeast fault jogs and splays 
provided conduits for movement of mineralizing hydrothermal fluids.  Multiple episodes of 
fracturing allowed multiple episodes of hydrothermal mineralization.  The West End Deposit is 
situated less then 2mi from the western edge of the Thunder Mountain Caldera margin. 

It is generally assumed that mineralization in the district is related to the intrusion of two-mica 
granite, interpreted as S-type granites, generated by partial melting of crustal materials that had a 
significant sedimentary component (Lewis and others, 1987).  Mineral deposits associated with 
S-type granites tend to be enriched in gold, tungsten, antimony and arsenic.

7 Mineralization (Item 11) 
7.1 Mineralized Zones 

Mineralization in the West End Deposit has a primary structural control and a secondary 
lithologic control.  Brittle fault structures provided conduits that provided access to receptive 
sedimentary rocks for gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids.  The West End fault zone and adjacent 
calc-silicate units are the primary hosts of the gold mineralization at the West End Deposit.  

The West End fault zone consists of three, principal high angle faults, all striking at azimuth 30° 
and dipping 50 to 75° southeast.  The width of the fault zone as measured between the Footwall 
and the Hanging Wall faults, varies from 100 to 300ft.  Several subsidiary structures extend 
southeast from the West End fault zone.  The subsidiary structures strike along azimuth 60 to 90° 
and dip steeply south.   

The calc-silicate units are referred to as the Upper Calc-silicate and the Lower Calc-silicate.  The 
units are nearly identical in composition and distinguished only by their relative stratigraphic 
positions.  Higher-grade gold mineralization occurs preferentially where either calc-silicate unit 
is cut by any of the West End or subsidiary faults.  The Hanging wall fault tends to exhibit 
relatively more dilatant and dispersed structures relative to the lower two faults and therefore has 
stronger mineralization.  Open space fill quartz veins are closely associated with the faults and 
are indicative of higher-grade zones of mineralization. 

7.2 Surrounding Rock Types 

The Upper and Lower Calc-silicates host the majority of the mineralized material.  These units 
are bound by The Upper Quartzite, the Lower Quartzite, the Fern Dolomite, the Hermes 
Dolomite and are cut by a granodiorite.  Anomalous mineralization also occurs in all of these 
units.  Rarely, rhyolitic or basaltic dikes cut the metasediments and intrusives. 

7.3 Relevant Geological Controls 

The dominant controls on gold mineralization are structural channeling along faults and 
development of veins by dilation and hydraulic fracturing.  Gold precipitation is dependent on a 
chemically favorable environment strongly influenced by rock composition.  Relatively deep-
seated regional structures appear to have been active at the time of mineralization and have 
played a vital role in the structural preparation of the host rocks and channeling of the 
mineralizing fluids.  The fluids, and their contained metals, are believed to have been derived 
from magmatic sources or the nearby Thunder Mountain caldera complex. 

7.4 Type, Character and Distribution of Mineralization 

Gold mineralization is strongly associated with sulfides, primarily pyrite, arsenopyrite and to a 
lesser extent stibnite.  The sulfides occur as biotite replacement, massive replacements, veins, 
stockworks and breccia filling all in close association with the structurally induced fluid 
pathways.  Sulfide mineralization is closely associated with quartz gangue and alteration halos of 
sericite. 

The gold mineralization localized along the West End fault zone occurs along 4,300ft of strike 
length and has been drill tested down dip for 675ft where it remains open.  Satellite bodies of 
gold mineralization so occur along strike and within various stratigraphic units up to 1,700ft

8 Exploration (Item 12) 
8.1 Surveys and Investigations 

8.1.1 Procedures and Parameters 

At this time, Midas has conducted extensive data compilation and limited surface exploration on 
the West End Deposit.  Midas has completed a thorough compilation of data available from 
geologic, drilling, engineering, and production campaigns completed by several mining 
companies.  This data includes; rock chip samples, blast hole maps, as built surveys used to 
generate pit-bottom boundary surfaces, drillhole logs, assay sheets, manual and electronic 
sectional interpretations, assay certificates, and a variety of interpretive and administrative 
reports.  Drillhole logs have been physically reconciled to corresponding assay data sheets by the 
Midas staff in 2009-2010.  The electronic database used for the resource modeling was 
developed after a 100% audit of assay certificates, drillhole logs, and historic assay databases.   

During the 2009 field season, geologic mapping, outcrop sampling and an airborne 
magnetometer survey were completed.  Extensive geologic mapping, surface rock sampling, 
work was completed to confirm the data compilation of the historic data files.  The control points 
used by the historic developments was re-surveyed in 2009 and early 2010.  LIDAR topographic 
surveying was completed for the entire Stibnite district, including all of the West End resource 
area, in 2009.  An extensive core drilling campaign is currently underway (2010).  All electronic 
and paper files are stored and available for review at the Midas offices in Spokane Washington.   

8.2 Interpretation 

The exploration work conducted by Midas meets current industry standards.  The geologic 
mapping, surface sampling and geophysical survey are all appropriate for the type of 
mineralization.  Midas has made a concerted effort to ensure good sample quality and has 
maintained a careful chain of custody and ensured sample security from the field to the assay 
laboratory.

9 Drilling (Item 13) 
9.1 Type and Extent of Drilling 

The drilling at West End consists of RC and core holes.  RC drilling was typically conducted 
with truck or buggy mounted drills under both dry and wet drilling conditions.  The RC drill 
typically used a down-hole hammer with a 5.5in bit.  Sample was collected by an above-hammer, 
interchange and then traveled up the center of the drill string so that no contamination could 
occur.  Once water is encountered within the drillhole moderate to high water flow was common.   

Core drilling was also completed by truck or skid mounted rigs using a standard mud system.  
The majority of the holes are NQ diameter with a few being BQ.  Core was retrieved in a 
standard core barrel using a wire line system.   

A total of 729 drillholes have been completed in the West End area.  The resource estimation 
used 622 holes totaling of 181,783ft of core and RC drillholes.  (Figure 9-1).  The 107 holes not 
used were rotary drillholes, air track holes, or holes with no confirmed locations.  There are 517 
RC holes and 105 core holes with several different naming sequences.  The RC drilling 
represents 86% of the samples.  The drillholes are generally oriented along sections at azimuth 
300° and have a wide range of plunge angles.  The maximum drillhole depth is 845ft and the 
average is 290ft.  The current drilling covers 4,300ft of strike length and a maximum of 675ft 
down dip.  

9.1.1 Procedures 

A drill location was first laid out by the mine surveyors with a specified easting and northing and 
a drill pad was constructed.  After the pad was completed, the collar point was re-established.  
The drilling was conducted by a number of different companies, all of which have been reputable 
industry contractors.  Typically, the overburden in the resource area is very thin and only a short 
section of casing is required.  There was no hole-abandonment remediation required at the time 
of the historic drilling.  Drillhole collars were typically not preserved. 

9.2 Results 

Reputable contractors using industry standard techniques and procedures have conducted the 
drilling.  This work has defined a large zone of anomalous gold mineralization within the West 
End fault zone and adjacent calc-silicate units.  The mineralization is interpreted to follow two 
main orientations controlled by both the fault planes and the calc-silicate units.  The drillholes 
are generally arranged in parallel at 100ft spacing, inclined steeply to the northwest along 
parallel sections 100ft apart.  This orientation provides a high angle of intersection between the 
predominate plane of mineralization and the drillhole.  Based on the average drillhole 
orientations most of the sample lengths do not represent absolutely, true thickness of 
mineralization but they very close to it. 

9.2.1 Interpretation 

SRK is of the opinion that the drilling operations were conducted by professionals, the RC chips 
and core were handled, logged and sampled in an acceptable manner by professional geologists, 
and the results are suitable for support of a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimation.

10 Sampling Method and Approach (Item 14) 
10.1 Sampling Methods and Chain of Custody 

The RC drilling samples were typically collected by a designated and trained sampler supplied 
by the mine's geological team.  The entire length of the hole was sampled typically every 5ft of 
hole advance from a three-tier riffle splitter or a rotating wet pie-type splitter located on the drill 
rig.  At every sample interval, the hole was blown clean and advancement was halted until all 
material has passed through the splitter and the sample pan has been replaced.  The sample split 
was poured directly into a sample bag pre-labeled with a drill hole interval based sample number.  
The sample bag was immediately tied closed and stored in sight of the sampler at the rig until the 
end of the shift or the end of the drillhole.  A small amount of the reject split was washed and 
then placed into a plastic chip tray.  The chip tray remains closed when not in use.  At the end of 
each drilling shift or at drill hole completion, the mine's geologic personnel transported the 
samples directly to the mines sample processing area.  At this point, the custody of the sample 
was exchanged to the mine lab department.   

During the core drilling operation, the core was typically retrieved from the core barrel and laid 
sequentially into wax coated, cardboard core boxes.  The core was washed and interval blocks 
are placed at all run breaks.  Once the box contained approximately 10ft of core, the ends and 
sides were labeled with drillhole identification, from-to intervals and a sequential box number.  
The box was then covered with a lid and stacked at the rig to assure that the core is not exposed 
to any potential contamination or mix-ups.  At the end of each drilling shift or drillhole, the 
boxes of core were transported by the drillers or the geologic staff to the logging and sampling 
area.  The core was then logged, sample intervals were marked and the core was split by a 
hydraulic splitter.  Samples were placed into bags and shipped to the lab.  There are no details in 
the historic data files as to how the core was transported, or its chain of custody from the core 
logging area to the assay laboratory.   

10.2 Factors Impacting Accuracy of Results 

The various drilling and sampling programs were conducted by professional drillers and 
geologists who undoubtedly, performed to the standards of the mining industry.  The sample 
recovery as recorded on the drill logs, shows that nearly all of the mineralized intervals produced 
very good recovery.  Since the entire hole was sampled, all of the potentially mineralized 
material is tested.  Such thorough sampling ensures that both mineralized and un-mineralized 
material is adequately characterized.  Based on the good recovery, proper chain of custody, and 
thorough sampling methods, the factors impacting accuracy of results are very positive. 

10.3 Sample Quality 

The drilling, logging and sampling procedures described above combined with good recovery 
ensure that sample quality of the West End drilling is very good.  The sample length is 
appropriate to accurately characterize the mineralization and to distinguish any zones internal to 
the mineralization, which may have anomalously high or low-grades.   

10.4 Relevant Samples 

The relevant samples are the mineralized intervals of the drillholes.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 
(Item 15) 

11.1 Sample Preparation and Assaying Methods 

The QP of this report, Dr. Stryhas, worked at the West End Mine during the period when the 
majority of the RC drilling was conducted and has provided the descriptions of the sample 
preparation, analysis and security below.  There is no detailed documentation of the sample 
preparation, analysis and security of the core samples in the historic data files.  During the 
1970's and 1980's it was not a standard component of project reporting to document these 
routines of project operation.  Industry and corporate standards have always been to use 
appropriate sample preparation and analytical methods and to prohibit any outsiders to handle or 
inspect fresh drill core at any stage of exploration operations.   

The RC samples were first dried in their bags within a large drying oven at approximately 100°f 
for 6 to 8 hours.  The dried samples typically weighed about 10lbs and they were then run 
through a jaw crusher and reduced to minus 1/4in.  The crushed sample was then run through a 
riffle splitter and a 200 to 300g subsample was collected.  The split was next run through a ring 
and puck pulverizer for about two minutes and reduced to 85% minus 200mesh.  The pulverized 
material was then placed into a pre-labeled pulp bag.  The crusher, splitter and pulverizer were 
all blown clean with an air hose after each sample.   

Assay directions for each drillhole were provided to the laboratory by the geologic staff.  The 
type of analysis was typically determined by the nature of the oxidation.  If the sample was 
collected from the portion of the drillhole logged as oxidized it was typically analyzed for only 
cyanide soluble gold and silver using atomic absorption (AA).  If the sample was collect near the 
base or anywhere below the oxide zone it was typically analyzed only by fire assay.  The AA 
analysis used a 2g charge and a cold cyanide agitation for approximately two hours.  The fire 
assay used a 15g charge, standard fire assay procedures and a gravimetric finish.   

11.2 Quality Assurance and Quality Controls (QA/QC) 

There is no documentation of the QA/QC, program in the historic data files.  During the 1970's 
and 1980's it was not a standard component of project reporting to document these routines of 
project operation.  The mine lab typically calibrated the AA spectrometer in the mornings and 
again at midday.  The fire assay lab sporadically sent check sample to a commercial lab.  The 
historic lab procedures were somewhat validated by the annual mine reconciliation.  This is 
based on the blast hole analysis factored to production tonnage, pad recovery and the ultimate 
number of ounces sold to the refinery.  During Dr. Stryhas' time at the mine, there were never 
any issues related to laboratory bias.   

11.3 Interpretation 

SRK is of the opinion that the analytical work performed by the mine labs on the West End 
drilling samples was good, and suitable for use in resource estimation.  The AA and fire assay 
methods, were commonly used for gold analysis in that era and continue to be used today.

12 Data Verification (Item 16) 
12.1 Quality Control Measures and Procedures 

The Midas geologic staff have compiled an extensive library (both paper and electronic) of the 
historic data produced during the last 30 years of exploration and production.  This data includes 
as-built blast hole maps used to generate pit-bottom boundary surfaces, drillhole logs, assay 
sheets, manual and electronic sectional interpretations, assay certificates, and a variety of 
interpretive and administrative reports.  Drillhole logs have been physically reconciled to 
corresponding assay data sheets by the Midas staff in 2009-2010.   

The majority of the electronic database used for the resource modeling was retrieved from 
historic electronic data files by the Midas staff.  All drill collar locations and down hole surveys 
were manually verified by comparing the electronic data to individual paper copy drill logs.  Any 
discrepancies were noted and corrected.  The electronic assay database was also verified 
thoroughly to the assay data sheets as available or the paper copy drill logs.  Midas conducted the 
original data verification and the database was then verified again by SRK.   

The control points used by the historic developments was re-surveyed in 2009 and early 2010.  
LIDAR topographic surveying was completed for the entire Stibnite district, including all of the 
West End resource area, in 2009.  An extensive core drilling campaign is currently underway 
(fall 2010).  All electronic and paper files are stored and available for review at the Midas offices 
in Spokane Washington.   

12.2 Limitations 

The database prepared by Midas described above relies on information supplied from various 
professional assayers.  Midas and SRK have handled the data with utmost regards to accurate 
transfer and preservation, but do not take responsibility for the quality of the original source data.

13 Adjacent Properties (Item 17) 
There are two significant gold deposits located adjacent to the West End Deposit.  The "Yellow 
Pine" deposit was discovered in the 1920's by Hennessy, Oberbillig, and others, and mined by 
the Bradley Mining Company from the 1930's to 1950's.  It is located 3,000ft to the west-
southwest of the West End Deposit.  Vista Gold (2006) has reported an NI 43-101 compliant 
resource estimation for the deposit as listed in Table 13.1.

The mineralization is hosted within granodiorite cut by the Meadow Creek shear zone.  
Historical mining of tungsten and antimony has occurred at the location of the Yellow Pine gold 
resource.  Neither SRK nor Midas has verified the resources reported by Vista.  In addition, 
Midas has recovered additional historical data not available to Vista and has commissioned SRK 
to update the Yellow Pine mineral resource estimation.  

The second deposit is currently being called "Hanger Flats".  This incorporates the historic 
Meadow Creek Mine and extension to the mineralization which were drilled by Bradley Mining 
Company and others in the 1930's and the 1950's.  The deposit is located 2.3mi to the south-
southwest of the West End Deposit and is also hosted by granodiorite cut by the Meadow Creek 
fault zone.  Midas has been drilling the Hanger Flats Deposit during the 2009 and 2010 field 
seasons and has commissioned SRK to complete an NI 43-101 compliant resource estimation for 
the deposit.  Historical mining of antimony and gold has occurred at the location of the Hanger 
Flats gold mineralization.

14 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
(Item 18) 

14.1 Recoverability 

The West End Deposit is comprised primarily of sulfide material with the remainder classified as 
oxide.  The oxide/sulfide boundary is typically very sharp and no significant quantities of 
transitional material are defined.   

Extensive metallurgical work was completed on West End oxide ores prior to mine development 
in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  From 1976 to 1978, Mountain States Research and 
Development and several subcontractors conducted leach testing, petrographic studies and 
process mineralogy work-ups.  Work indices calculated for various ore types averaged 12.4kWh 
per short ton.  Column testing of oxide ores indicates excellent recoveries (>90%) with good 
kinematics.  Recoveries reportedly improved with finer crush fractions.  The oxide material has 
been mined historically and processed using heap leaching.  Run of mine material was crushed to 
minus 2in, lime was added and the material was processed by an on/off heap leach pad.  
Typically, a pad was leached for about 30 days and then neutralized for another 15 days.  Based 
on mine and mill reconciliation, historical heap leach recoveries averaged about 90%.   

Metallurgical test work on the sulfide material is fairly limited at this time.  In 1977, Mountain 
States Research and Development completed initial flotation studies and gold balance work.  
These studies indicated gold reported to a sulfide concentrate containing mostly pyrite (70%) and 
to a lesser extent arseonpyrite (10%) with the remainder of the gold occurring in association with 
marcasite (4%), goethite, bismuthinite and tetrahedrite.  Rutile (1%) and siliceous gangue were 
the other components of the concentrates evaluated.  This early work indicated better flotation 
and total gold recoveries from finer grinds. 

In 1978, Britton Research Ltd of White Rock, B.C. performed flotation, cyanidation, and 
cyanidation after roasting test on material derived from two exploration core holes.  The test 
work showed that gold recovery by flotation was 70% however, cyanidation of the concentrate 
for 72 hours only recovered 2.4% of the gold.  Once the ore was identified as "highly refractory", 
a cyanidation of the concentrate after roasting test was performed.  In this case, the concentrate 
was roasted at 500° to 600°C for a total of 5½ hours with agitation.  The roasted concentrate then 
underwent cyanidation for 72 hours and an overall gold recovery of 76% was achieved.  The 
Britton report clearly states that the metallurgical test work was only a first pass evaluation and 
that neither ideal flotation nor roasting condition were achieved.   

In 1987, Coastech Research Inc of North Vancouver, B.C. performed exploratory metallurgical 
test work on a bulk sample from the West End Deposit.  This included preliminary grinding, 
flotation, cyanidation and biooxidation test work.  There is no detail describing the origin or size 
of the West End sulfide sample.  The preliminary grinding test showed the material to have a 
work index of 13.2kWh/t.  Preliminary flotation test were run on three grind sizes including 80% 
minus, 90µm, 120µm and 165µm.  The results showed gold recoveries of 92.5, 90.3 and 88.6% 
respectively.  Direct cyanidation of the concentrate for 58 hours showed recoveries of 6.6%, 
2.4% and 4.0% respectively.  This work reaffirmed the refractory nature of the mineralization.  
Biooxidation tests were next run on an unspecified concentrate grind.  The material was bio-
oxidized for 232 hours and then subjected to cyanidation.  The total gold recovery was 84% and 
total silver recovery was 78%.

In 1988, Hazen Research of Golden Colorado conducted additional flotation tests of the 
refractory sulfide material.  Hazen's flotation work experimented with various pH conditions and 
chemical additives.  The result was a cleaned concentrate with 85% gold recovery and a 20:1 
concentration ratio.  The concentrate contained mainly pyrite and aresenopyrite at a 3:1 ratio 
respectively.  Hazen then completed further testing on six concentrate samples including 
roasting, pressure oxidation, and the Cashman (low temperature chlorination pressure oxidation).  
Cyanidation after the pressure oxidation and the Cashman process both showed improved gold 
recoveries up to 98%.  Hazen also recommended additional metallurgical testing but no work has 
been completed since 1988.

15 Mineral Resource Estimate (Item 19) 
15.1 Qualified Persons for the Mineral Resource Estimate 

Dr. Bart Stryhas constructed the geologic and mineral resource model discussed below.  He is 
responsible for the resource estimation methodology, mineral resource classification and 
resource statement.  Dr. Stryhas is independent of the issuer applying all of the tests in Section 
1.4 of NI 43-101. 

The resource estimate is based on a computerized resource block model using VULCAN® 
modeling software.  The resource model is constructed from the existing drill hole database, 
digitized pit as-built topography, interpreted geologic controls on oxide and sulfide 
mineralization, and LIDAR topographic data. 

15.2 Drillhole Database 

The drillhole database was compiled by Midas and is determined to be of good quality.  The 
database consists of four, Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets containing collar locations surveyed in 
local mine grid coordinates, drillhole orientations without down hole deviation surveys, assay 
intervals with gold analyses by fire assay and/or cyanide soluble assay and geologic intervals 
with rock types.   

The drillhole database contains information from 622 holes totaling of 181,783ft.  There are 517 
RC holes and 105 core holes with several different naming sequences.  The RC drilling 
represents 86% of the samples.  The drillholes are generally oriented along sections at azimuth 
300° and have a wide range of plunge angles.  The maximum drillhole depth is 845ft and the 
average is 290ft.  Due to the relatively shallow depth of drilling, the lack of down hole surveys 
does not have a negative impact on the drillhole database.  The appropriate codes for missing 
samples and no recovery were used during the modeling procedures.   

15.3 Geology 

The resource estimation is based on a generalized geologic model consisting of five rock types; 
including quartzite/schist, schist, calc-silicate, dolomite and granodiorite.  The principal 
mineralization occurs as quartz veinlets and silicate replacement within several of the 
stratigraphic units at and near the intersection of the West End Fault zone, and related structures.  
All of the metasedimentary units strike approximately at azimuth 130° and dip 40 to 60° 
northeast.  They are cut by the West End Fault zone which is comprised of three high angle 
faults, all striking at azimuth 30° and dipping 50 to 75° southeast.  The West End faults are 
referred to as the Hanging Wall, Middle and Footwall Faults.  The width of the fault zone as 
measured between the Footwall and the Hanging Wall faults, varies from 100 to 300ft.  Several 
subsidiary structures extend southeast from the West End fault zone.  These include the Splay 
fault, Stibnite fault and related structures.  The subsidiary structures strike along azimuth 60 to 
90° and dip steeply south and to a lessor extent to the north.  Based on the relative offsets of the 
metasediments, the West End faults have experienced, right lateral and/or normal offset.  Wire 
frame surfaces were constructed for the three main faults based on digitized cross sections 
constructed by Dr. Stryhas in the late 1980's 

The granodiorite bodies are interpreted as tabular or pod shaped bodies aligned parallel to both 
the fault zone and the lithic contacts and they are located primarily in the hanging wall of the

fault zone.  They have preferentially intruded and replaced the calc-silicate bodies.  Wire frame 
solids were constructed for the calc-silicates, dolomites, intrusive bodies and a single schist unit 
based on cross sections constructed by Dr. Stryhas in the late 1980's.  The block model was first 
coded as quartzite/schist for all blocks located below original topography and then the wire 
frames were used to overwrite the lithic codes for each unit.  

Overall, the resource area has a moderately deep level of oxidation focused about the West End 
Fault zone.  Cross section interpretations of the redox boundary were constructed by Dr. Stryhas 
in the late 1980 based on drill log data, core inspection and RC chip inspections.  This data was 
digitized in cross section and then wire framed into a 3-D surface defining an upper oxide zone 
and a lower sulfide zone; the transition zone between the two is relatively thin and was not 
modeled.   

15.4 Block Model 

A block model was constructed within the mine grid coordinate limits listed in Table 15.4.1.  A 
20ft x 20ft x 20ft (x, y, z) block size was chosen as an appropriate dimension based on the 
current drillhole spacing and a potential open pit smallest mining unit.  Two topographic surfaces 
were used to flag the top of original bedrock in the block model.  Within the mined areas, 
original topography was generated from historic cross sections constructed by Dr. Stryhas in the 
late 1980's.  These were digitized and wire framed into a 3-D surface.  Outside of the mining 
areas, as-built blasthole data, and the LIDAR topographic data was used.  A third, as built, 
topographic surface was generated by Midas and this was used to flag all the un-mined bedrock 
in the block model.  Soil thickness varies slightly over the deposit and the soil thickness is 
generally very thin or non-existent.   

Table 15.4.1:  Block Model Limits 

Orientation Minimum (ft) Maximum (ft) Block Dimension (ft) 
Easting 7,400 10,200 20 
Northing 8,400 12,200 20 
Elevation 6,100 7,600 20 

 

15.5 Compositing 

The raw assay gold data was first plotted on histogram and cumulative distribution graphs to 
understand its basic statistical distribution.  The histogram shows a strongly negative skewed 
distribution, typical for most gold deposits.  The cumulative distribution curve illustrates a 
continuous population set with a distinct break in slope and continuity at 0.57oz/t.  The raw assay 
data was capped at 0.57oz/t, which resulted in 18 samples ranging from 0.574 to 0.903 being 
reduced to 0.57 prior to compositing.  The capping resulted in a 0.3% reduction in contained 
gold.  The original assay sample lengths range from 0.4 to 25ft with an average of 5.16ft.  For 
the modeling, these were composited into 10ft down hole lengths.  This length was chosen 
mainly so that two assay samples would be composited and two composites would comprise 
each 20ft block diameter.  The cumulative distribution plot of the composited data showed no 
outlier points.

15.6 Density 

Midas had not conducted density testing on any samples at the time of the mineral resource 
estimation.  The density values presented in Table 15.4.1.below were assigned based on average 
densities of similar rock types.  These values were validated against the historic mine planning 
and mine reconciliation tonnage factor of 12ft3/t used throughout the history of the mining.  
Midas is currently conducting a density study of new core drilling to confirm the assumptions 
listed below and, going forward, subsequent resource estimates will increasingly rely on data 
collected during drilling.

15.7 Variogram Analysis and Modeling 

A series of Variograms were run on the drillhole data to evaluate the spatial variability and 
lateral grade continuity through the deposit and provide limits for the search radius used in the 
grade interpolation process.  The variograms show best grade continuity parallel to the 
predominant structural trend within the West End fault zone, at a bearing of N70E, and plunge of 
-45°.  The variogram range along this search direction is approximately 100ft.  This range 
approximates the average drillhole spacing in this area.  All other variogram orientations 
displayed significant nugget effect.  For this reason, ordinary kriging was not used for grade 
interpolation.   

15.8 Grade Estimation 

The West End Deposit was modeled only for Au.  All block grade estimates were made using the 
10ft downhole composites.   

Due to the variable nature of the mineralization, it was necessary to create a hard boundary grade 
shell within which to confine the estimation.  The grade shell was constructed using a categorical 
indicator approach.  This method first separates the composite data into lower grade and higher-
grade groups based on an appropriate cut-off value, which is below the anticipated mining cut-
off.  In this case, a 0.01oz/t Au cut-off was used.  The composite values below 0.01oz/t Au are 
flagged with a "0" and those above are flagged with a "1".  The composite indicators values ("0" 
or "1") are then interpolated into the block model thus creating indicator block values between 
"0" and "1".  The indicator values were interpolated using an inverse distance weighting squared 
(ID2) algorithm since good variograms could not be generated from the data.   

The categorical indicator interpolation was conducted within each of the five rock types as hard 
boundaries and within three structural domains as soft boundaries.  In addition, each redox zone 
was estimated independently as a semi-hard boundary.  The oxide blocks were estimated using 
the flagged cyanide soluble assays and the sulfide blocks were estimated using the flagged fire 
assay data.  All estimations used a two-pass method.  In the first pass, a min/max of 1/2 



Midas Gold Inc  15-4 
West End Deposit - Golden Meadows Project   NI 43-101 Technical Report on Resources 
 

SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.  February 16, 2011 
West End Deposit_NI 43-1010 Technical Report_200900.020_20110216  

composites was allowed to search within a 20ft x 20ft x 20ft box to ensure that any block 
containing a composite was assigned the value of that composite.  The second pass used a 
min/max of 1/5 composites and was allowed to search according to the parameters listed in Table 
15.8.1.  The search ranges are based mainly on the author's evaluation of what is appropriate for 
the deposit.  Any oxide blocks that were not estimated using only the cyanide soluble gold assays 
were allowed to be estimated in two subsequent passes using the fire assay data from within the 
oxide zone only. 

The estimation of the indicator values effectively assigns a probability to each block as to 
whether it would be above the 0.01oz/t Au cut-off and hence within the grade shell.  Blocks 
assigned with a value of 0.1 have a 10% probability, a 0.5 have 50% probability and those with a 
1.0 have a 100% probability.   

The next step was to run Au grade interpolations using an ID2 algorithm.  The grade estimation 
considered all blocks with a categorical indicator value of 0.50 (50% probability) and above to 
be within the 0.01oz/t Au grade shell.  This estimation continued to honor the structural, 
lithologic and redox boundary domains described above.  Again, a two-pass estimation was used.  
In the first pass, a min/max of 1/2 composites was allowed to search within a 20ft x 20ft x 20ft 
box to ensure that any block containing a composite was assigned the value of that composite.  
The second pass used a min/max of 2/8 composites and was allowed to search according to the 
parameters listed in Table 15.8.2.  The search ellipsoids were oriented the same as for the 
categorical indicator assignment.  The search ranges are based mainly on the author's evaluation 
of what is appropriate for the deposit in order to allow a reasonable amount of smoothing within 
the interpolation.  A representative cross section of the interpolated block model grades is shown 
in Figure 15-1.  Again, any oxide blocks that were not estimated using only the cyanide soluble 
gold assays were allowed to be estimated in two subsequent passes using the fire assay data from 
within the oxide zone only.

15.9 Model Validation 

Four techniques were used to evaluate the validity of the block model.  First, the ID2 interpolated 
block grades were visually checked on sections and bench plans for comparison to the composite 
assay grades.  Second, a nearest neighbor estimation was run using a single composite to

estimate each block within the same parameters used for the Au ID2 grade model.  The total 
contained gold ounces, at a zero cut-off grade in the nearest neighbor model were compared to 
the Au ID2 grade model at the same cut-off.  The Au ID2 grade model contained 1.4% less metal 
than the nearest neighbor estimation, indicating that metal is not being manufactured during the 
modeling process.  Third, statistical analyses were made in the sulfide zone comparing the 
estimated block grades from the Au ID2 grade model to the nearest neighbor estimation and the 
composite drillhole data.  Table 15.9.1 below shows block grades by structural domain and 
lithology, which are slightly less or nearly equal to the composite grades as desired.  Fourth, 
swath plots were generated to compare the interpolated Au ID2 grade model blocks to the nearest 
neighbor grades and composite data for the oxide and sulfide material at regular 100ft swath 
intervals through the deposit.  The results are presented in Figure 15-2 and 15-3.  The swaths 
show an acceptable amount of grade smoothing with the majority of the block grades very close 
to or slightly below the nearest neighbor block grades and composite grades.  All four-model 
validation tests described above provided good confidence in the resource estimation.

15.10 Resource Classification 

Mineral Resources are classified under the categories of Measured, Indicated and Inferred 
according to CIM guidelines.  Classification of the mineral resources reflects the relative 
confidence of the grade estimates and the continuity of the mineralization.  This classification is 
based on several factors including; sample spacing relative to geological and geo-statistical 
observations regarding the continuity of mineralization, data verification to original sources, 
specific gravity determinations, accuracy of drill collar locations, accuracy of topographic 
surface, quality of the assay data and many other factors, which influence the confidence of the 
mineral estimation.  No single factor controls the mineral resource classification rather each 
factor influences the end result.  Generally, most of the factors influencing the mineral resource 
classification at West End are positive.  The history of mining and mineral resource 
reconciliation adds a high level of confidence to the grade and continuity of the mineralization.  
The lack of direct density measurement detracts from the confidence in the tonnage estimates. 

The mineral resources have been classified as Indicated and Inferred based primarily on sample 
spacing as indicated by drilling density.  Indicated Mineral Resources were classified by two

methods.  The first includes all blocks that were assigned grade during the first pass of the grade 
estimation.  These blocks are located within 10ft of a composite sample that represents the same 
confidence that would be demonstrated from production blastholes.  Additional Indicated 
Mineral Resources are confined within a wireframe shape constructed around the core of the 
deposit where most drillholes are spaced approximately 100ft apart.  The wireframe was limited 
at depth to the base of where the drillholes remained closely spaced.  On average, the indicated 
resource blocks were estimated using seven composites from three different drillholes.  

All blocks located outside of the Indicated Mineral Resource wireframe, about the periphery of 
the deposit, were classified as Inferred Mineral Resource.  A representative cross section 
showing the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource blocks is shown below in Figure 15-4. 

15.11 Mineral Resource Statement 

The West End Mineral Resources are reported below at two different cut-off grades depending 
on the material type.  The oxide material is reported in Table 15.11.1 at a 0.010oz/t cut-off based 
on a mining cost of US$1.50/t, a processing cost of US$5.00/t, recovery of 85%, G&A cost of 
$2.00/t and a US$1,200/oz Au value.  The sulfide material is reported in table 15.11.2 at a 
0.02oz/t cut-off based on a US$1.50/t mining cost, US$20/t processing cost, 95% recovery, G&A 
cost of $2.00/t and a US$1,200/oz Au value.  The mineral resources are confined within a 
conceptual whittle pit design based on the same parameters used for the cut-off grade and a 50° 
pit slope based on historic mining practices.  The West End Mineral Resources are also reported 
in metric units in Tables 15.11.3 and 15.11.4.

17 Interpretation and Conclusions (Item 21) 
17.1 Field Surveys 

From the late 1970's to 1995, various owners have conducted surface mapping, surface 
sampling, geophysics, diamond drilling and RC drilling on the West End Deposit.  The surface 
mapping and sampling was focused on the local mineralized structures and surrounding rock 
types.  Drilling has been used to target gold mineralization that follows the structures and 
favorable lithologies.  The results of this work have delineated an anomalous gold zone along a 
northeast striking fault zone traceable for 4,200ft.  This structure has been drill tested by of 622 
drillholes totaling 181,783ft.  There are 517 RC holes and 105 core holes.  The drillholes were 
carefully logged, sampled and tested for gold content using both cyanide soluble, atomic 
absorption and fire assay.  The exploration work conducted by the historic owners meets current 
industry standards.  The exploration drilling programs were well planned and carried out in a 
prudent and careful manner.  All drill core and RC chip logging and sampling has been done by 
trained and professional personnel.   

17.2 Analytical and Testing Data 

SRK is of the opinion that the analytical work performed by the various assayers was good, and 
suitable for use in resource estimation.  The AA and fire assay methods are the industry standard, 
recommended analytical technique used for gold analysis.  There have been no QA/QC programs 
that have verified the original assay analyses.   

17.3 Exploration Conclusions 

The drilling programs adequately define the zone of gold mineralization and are acceptable to 
support the resource estimation of this report.  The deposit remains open in several directions and 
further infill drilling is needed to better delineate the limits of mineralization.   

17.4 Resource Estimation 

The mineral resource estimation is based on a geologic model consisting of five general rock 
types that are cut by the three high angle faults.  The model blocks are 20ft x 20ft x 20ft in the 
x,y,z directions, respectively.  Each model block is assigned a unique specific gravity based on 
rock type.  All block grade estimates were made using 10ft down hole composites.  An Inverse 
Distance Weighting to the second power algorithm was employed to generate a categorical 
indicator grade shell based on a 0.01oz/t Au threshold.  An ID2 algorithm was also used for the 
gold grade estimation.  The results of the resource estimation provided a CIM classified 
Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource.  The quality of the drilling and data is very good and 
the Mineral Resource was classified mainly according to the general drillhole spacing.

18 Recommendations (Item 22) 
18.1 Recommended Work Programs 

Exploration and Development 

 The combined oxide and sulfide mineral resource at West End warrants an expanded 
exploration / development program and a scoping level economic evaluation; 

 The expanded exploration program should include additional drilling in order to:  

o selectively twin historic RC drilling with core holes to confirm reported assay 
results; 

o obtain additional density measurements through the deposit focusing on alteration 
and rock types; 

o define geotechnical characteristics to refine potential pit slope parameters; and 

o upgrade and expand the current resources. 

 The expanded development program should include metallurgical testing in order to: 

o detail the gold mineralogy; 

o define applicable gold recovery techniques; and 

o evaluate and optimize various recovery options and economics. 

 Additional environmental development work should also be conducted to: 

o continue to establish baseline conditions; 

o identify pertinent environmental issues,; 

o identify potential areas of mitigation; and  

o establish a permitting timeline. 

18.2 Proposed Budget

20.1 Mineral Resources and Reserves 

20.1.1 Mineral Resources 

The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (December 2005).  
Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the 
Reserves have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated 
Resources as defined below.   

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 
organic material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 
quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, 
geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 
interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.   

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade 
or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and 
reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on 
limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 
sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 
mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on 
detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely 
enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 
quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 
estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 
economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 
the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, 
pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 
continuity. 

20.1.2 Mineral Reserves 

A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material 
is mined.

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility 
Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 
economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction can be justified.   

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 
demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 
information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.

Grade: The measure of concentration of gold within mineralized rock.   
Hangingwall: The overlying side of an orebody or slope.   
Haulage: A horizontal underground excavation which is used to transport mined ore.   
Hydrocyclone: A process whereby material is graded according to size by exploiting centrifugal forces of 

particulate materials.   
Igneous: Primary crystalline rock formed by the solidification of magma.   
Kriging: An interpolation method of assigning values from samples to blocks that minimizes the 

estimation error.   
Level: Horizontal tunnel the primary purpose is the transportation of personnel and materials.   
Lithological: Geological description pertaining to different rock types.   
LoM Plans: Life-of-Mine plans.   
LRP: Long Range Plan.   
Material Properties: Mine properties.   
Milling: A general term used to describe the process in which the ore is crushed and ground and subjected

product.   

Mineral/Mining Lease: A lease area for which mineral rights are held.   
Mining Assets: The Material Properties and Significant Exploration Properties.   
Ongoing Capital: Capital estimates of a routine nature, which is necessary for sustaining operations.   
Ore Reserve: See Mineral Reserve.   
Pillar: Rock left behind to help support the excavations in an underground mine.   
RoM: Run-of-Mine.   
Sedimentary: Pertaining to rocks formed by the accumulation of sediments, formed by the erosion of other 

rocks.   
Shaft: An opening cut downwards from the surface for transporting personnel, equipment, supplies, ore 

and waste.   
Sill: A thin, tabular, horizontal to sub-horizontal body of igneous rock formed by the injection of 

magma into planar zones of weakness.   
Smelting: A high temperature pyrometallurgical operation conducted in a furnace, in which the valuable 

metal is collected to a molten matte or doré phase and separated from the gangue components that 
accumulate in a less dense molten slag phase.   

Stope: Underground void created by mining.   
Stratigraphy: The study of stratified rocks in terms of time and space.   
Strike: Direction of line formed by the intersection of strata surfaces with the horizontal plane, always 

perpendicular to the dip direction.   
Sulfide: A sulfur bearing mineral.   
Tailings: Finely ground waste rock from which valuable minerals or metals have been extracted.   
Thickening: The process of concentrating solid particles in suspension.   
Total Expenditure: All expenditures including those of an operating and capital nature.   
Variogram: A statistical representation of the characteristics (usually grade).
