FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION 
This report contains forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical 
fact regarding Barrick Gold Corporation or the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture (TRJV), are forward-
looking statements. The words "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "contemplate", "target", "plan", 
"intend", "project", "continue", "budget", "estimate", "potential", "may", "will", "can", "could" and 
similar expressions identify forward-looking statements.  In particular, this report contains forward-
looking statements with respect to cash flow forecasts, projected capital, operating and exploration 
expenditure, targeted cost reductions, mine life and production rates, potential mineralization and 
metal or mineral recoveries, and information pertaining to potential improvements to financial and 
operating performance and mine life at the TRJV that may result from the shaft-sinking project.  All 
forward-looking statements in this report are necessarily based on opinions and estimates made 
as of the date such statements are made and are subject to important risk factors and uncertainties, 
many of which cannot be controlled or predicted. Material assumptions regarding forward-looking 
statements are discussed in this report, where applicable. In addition to such assumptions, the 
forward-looking statements are inherently subject to significant business, economic and 
competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual 
results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors 
include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of commodities (including 
gold, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration and 
development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; 
diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions, and technical 
challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in 
connection with mining or development activities, including disruptions in the maintenance or 
provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; damage to Barrick Gold 
Corporation's or the TRJV's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of 
events, including negative publicity with respect to the handling of environmental matters or 
dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, 
sabotage and civil disturbances; uncertainty whether the TRJV will meet Barrick Gold Corporation's 
capital allocation objectives; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of 
cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact 
of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in interest rates; changes in national and 
local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration 
of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic 
developments in USA; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and 
regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; 
litigation; contests over title to properties or over access to water, power and other required 
infrastructure; increased costs and physical risks including extreme weather events and resource 
shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining 
inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral 
exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, 
unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold ore losses (and the risk 
of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). 

Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect Barrick Gold Corporation's actual results 
and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-
looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Barrick Gold Corporation.  All of the forward-looking 
statements made in this report are qualified by these cautionary statements. Barrick Gold 
Corporation and RPA and the Qualified Persons who authored this report undertake no obligation 
to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward‐looking statements whether as a result of new 
information or future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-1 

1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) to 

prepare an independent Technical Report on the Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources of 

the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture (TRJV) gold mine (the Mine) located in Humboldt County, 

Nevada, USA.  The purpose of this report is to support disclosure of the Mineral Resources 

and Mineral Reserves for the TRJV gold deposit as of December 31, 2017.  This Technical 

Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. 

 

Barrick is a Canadian publicly traded mining company with a portfolio of operating mines and 

projects.  The TRJV mine is located on Barrick's Getchell property on the eastern flank of the 

Osgood Mountains in the Potosi Mining District of northeastern Nevada.  The TRJV mine is a 

joint venture between Barrick (75%) and Newmont Mining Corporation (Newmont, 25%), and 

is operated by Barrick.  Information in this report is based on the TRJV as a whole and not only 

the 75% Barrick interest. 

 

The TRJV consists of the Turquoise Ridge underground mine which produces high-grade 

refractory (carbonaceous/sulphide) gold ores that are processed off-site on a toll milling basis. 

The Mine is a long-life (21 years) underground operation, accessed via two shafts and a 

system of internal ramps, and utilizes underhand drift and fill mining methods with cemented 

rock fill.  The Mine is currently producing 2,300 tons per day of ore with potential for increases 

from a planned 3rd Shaft and a new toll milling agreement.   

 

Table 1-1 summarizes the TRJV Mineral Resources exclusive of Mineral Reserves as of 

December 31, 2017.

CONCLUSIONS 
The Mine has been in production for over 10 years and is a mature operation.  In RPA's 

opinion, there are not any significant risks and uncertainties that could reasonably be expected 

to affect the reliability or confidence in the exploration information, Mineral Resource or Mineral 

Reserve estimates, or projected economic outcomes.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-3 

Based on the site visit and subsequent review, RPA offers the following conclusions: 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES  

• The Turquoise Ridge deposit is a typical Carlin-type deposit and is characterized by 
structurally and stratigraphically controlled, sediment-hosted, replacement deposits 
containing micron-sized gold.   
 

• The drilling, sampling, and quality assurance/quality control is appropriate for the style 
of mineralization.  
 

• The Mineral Resource estimate was completed by TRJV and was reviewed and 
accepted by RPA.   
 

• RPA is of the opinion that the Mineral Resource estimate has been completed to 
industry standard and is suitable to support the disclosure of Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves. 
 

• RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors which could materially affect 
the Mineral Resource estimate. 
 

• Measured and Indicated Resources, effective December 31, 2017, total 7.5 million tons 
grading 0.268 oz/ton Au, containing 2.0 million ounces of gold, exclusive of Mineral 
Reserves. 
 

• Inferred Resources, effective December 31, 2017, total 2.5 million tons grading 0.380 
oz/ton Au, containing 0.9 million ounces of gold. 
 

• Exploration potential remains considerable, and TRJV is pursuing an aggressive 
program on six targets. 

 
MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 

• The Mineral Reserve estimate was completed by TRJV and was reviewed and 
accepted by RPA.   
 

• RPA is of the opinion that the Mineral Reserve estimate has been completed to industry 
standard and is suitable for disclosure. 
 

• Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, effective December 31, 2017, total 17.3 million 
tons grading 0.453 oz/ton Au, containing 7.8 million ounces of gold. 

 
• 2017 reconciliation results show that estimation of gold ounces is a reasonable match 

for subsequent production once all information is available, i.e., relative to the short-
term grade control model.  Mineral Reserve estimates lack data when estimating more 
than a year in advance of mining – significant quantities of Inferred Resources are 
drilled, re-estimated, and upgraded in classification before mining, rendering the 
Reserve estimates conservative.  This is a long-standing pattern at TRJV, and not, in 
RPA's opinion, any cause for concern or change in estimation or operating practices.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-4 

• TRJV has started a pilot program to test mechanical mining via roadheader in softer 
ground.  More continuous operation (in comparison to the cycle of activities in 
conventional drift advance) and less impact on the rockmass are expected to provide 
operating efficiency advantages. 
 

• There is upside potential in higher mining rates, made possible by a new production 
shaft (sinking beginning in 2018), and a new toll milling agreement.  This is not currently 
reflected in operating cost estimates, cut-off grades, or the reserve estimate. 

 
PROCESSING 

• The current sampling protocol for shipped ore is a laborious process but works well.   
 

• The metallurgical accounting is complex but reasonable and consistent with typical 
industry standards. 
 

• The gold recovery equation is based upon a relationship with the ratio between the 
gold feed grade and the organic carbon concentration, adjusted monthly based on 
process results at the Twin Creeks Plant.  RPA's analysis, however, indicates that there 
is little correlation, and therefore the estimation methodology is not accurate.   
 

• There is a concern that the quantity of gold that TRJV is being paid for may be 
inaccurate, as plant recoveries attributed to TRJV feed (10% of the total feed) are 
influenced to a much greater extent by Twin Creeks feed (90% of the total feed).   

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 
RPA has the following recommendations by area: 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES  

• Continue infill drilling and exploration. 
 
MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 

• Review roadheader performance in 2018 and determine where gains can be made by 
changing from conventional drilling and blasting to mechanical mining.   
 

• Now that production is less limited by milling constraints, review potential for higher 
mine production.   

 
PROCESSING 

• RPA recommends that evaluation of gold recovery estimates should continue to be 
assessed in order to improve the accuracy of the estimates.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
This section is not required as Barrick is a producing issuer, and the property is currently in 

production and there is no material expansion of current production.  RPA has confirmed the 

economic viability of the Mineral Reserves through cash flow analysis. 

 

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 

PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The property is located in Humboldt County approximately 25 miles northeast of the village of 

Golconda, Nevada, and approximately 40 miles northeast of Winnemucca, Nevada.  The Mine 

is located at approximately 5,300 FASL and centred near latitude 41° 12' 58'' S and longitude 

117° 14' 39'' W. 

 

LAND TENURE 
The Turquoise Ridge property covers an area of 11,993 ha, which consists of 8,212 ha of 

unpatented mining and mill site claims and 3,781 ha of patented/fee land.  The surface rights 

secured for the TRJV are sufficient to provide the necessary space required for all mining and 

quarrying activities.   

 

As of the end of December 2017, all permits were in compliance or were in the process of 

renewal.   

 

The TRJV is subject to a 2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty payable to Umetco Minerals 

Corporation.  

 

HISTORY 
Mining for copper, lead, and silver first began on the property in 1883.  Tungsten was 

discovered in 1916 and mined sporadically until 1957.  Gold was discovered at the present 

day Getchell mine site in 1933 and Getchell Mine Inc. operated the property from 1934 to 1945, 

producing a total of 788,875 ounces of gold.  From 1960 to 2009, there was sporadic 

production at the Getchell mine including underground mining, open pit mining, and heap 

leaching of the dumps.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-6 

A deep drilling program began in 1993 in the Turquoise Ridge area.  Planning and engineering 

for a new underground mine was completed in 1995.  By mid-1998, a production shaft was 

completed at a depth of 1,820 ft below the surface.  In February 2000, mining was suspended 

at the Getchell Main underground mine.  Drilling continued on the Turquoise Ridge and North 

Zone deposits, but due to depressed gold prices, the entire property was shut down in 

February 2002.  Production resumed in February 2003. 

 

Since the inception of mining on the Getchell/TRJV property to the end of 2017, the Mine has 

produced approximately 6.0 million ounces of gold. 

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
The Turquoise Ridge gold mine is situated within the Basin and Range province, near the 

northeast end of the Osgood Mountains.   

 

The Getchell Fault, one of the most prominent structural features of the region, generally 

strikes north-south to north-northwest, and dips approximately 50° to the northeast in the 

vicinity of the mine site.  The Turquoise Ridge North Zone mineralization largely mimics the 

orientation of the Getchell Fault, with complications from northeast and north-south structures. 

 

The Turquoise Ridge deposit is a typical Carlin-type deposit and is characterized by structurally 

and stratigraphically controlled, sediment-hosted, replacement deposits containing 

disseminated micron sized gold.  The gold occurs in arsenic-rich rims forming on pyrite, chiefly 

within decalcified, carbonaceous rocks.  All gold bearing zones at TRJV are located in 

proximity to granodiorite dikes that splay from the Osgood stock.   

 

Lithology and structure strongly influence the geometry of the mineralization.  To the north, 

strataform mineralized domains exhibit strike lengths exceeding 1,000 ft with typical 

thicknesses in the 200 ft to 500 ft range.  Down dip lengths of over 1,000 ft are common.  Being 

dominantly stratigraphically controlled, the mineralized domains and bedding have a general 

north-northwest trending strike, and dip to the east (between 25° and 45°).   

 

To the south, strataform domains tend to strike north and dip to the east at approximately 30° 

to 60°.  This generalized orientation is slightly different from mineralization occurring in the 

northern part of the deposit.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-7 

The two zones are separated by the northeast trending Turquoise Ridge shear zone, which 

could have contributed to the difference in alignment of the two zones.   

 

EXPLORATION STATUS 
Since acquisition of the Project in 2006, Barrick has completed over 5,000 drill holes.  The 

drilling programs from 2010 to 2017 were largely comprised of definition drilling to upgrade 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adjacent to and within gaps in the Proven and 

Probable Mineral Reserve shapes.  In addition to the definition drilling in 2015, 2016, and 2017, 

TRJV drilled 30,726 ft in 21 step-out and advanced exploration holes. 

 

The TRJV maintains an aggressive exploration program principally comprising diamond 

drilling.  Exploration is being carried out over a number of exploration targets, including the TR 

Corridor Fault Zone, Upper Footwall Pond, the down dip and northeast extension of the 

Footwall Pond, the North Zone and South Zone Getchell Extensions, and the Powder Hill 

Extension. 

 

MINERAL RESOURCES 
The Mineral Resources as of December 31, 2017, are reported in Table 1-1 at a breakeven 

cut-off grade of 0.23 oz/ton Au based on operating costs, gold recoveries, and a gold price of 

US$1,500/oz.  

 

In metric units, the Mineral Resources consist of: 

 
• Measured Resources totalling 3.93 million tonnes grading 9.03 g/t Au and containing 

1.14 million ounces of gold.   
 

• Indicated Resources totalling 2.88 million tonnes grading 9.37 g/t Au and containing 
0.87 million ounces of gold. 
 

• Inferred Mineral Resources totalling 2.3 million tonnes grading 13.0 g/t Au and contain 
0.95 million ounces of gold. 

 

The Mineral Resources were estimated by conventional 3D computer block modelling based 

on surface and underground diamond drilling and core assaying.  Geologic interpretation of 

the drilling data was carried out and wireframes were constructed for 28 gold mineralized 

domains.  Assays were composited to five foot intervals within the domains and statistical 

analysis was carried out to determine grade capping levels for each domain.  Variography was

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-8 

used to determine search parameters and inverse distance squared was employed for grade 

interpolation in the block model.  Alternative interpolations by nearest neighbour methods were 

compared using swath plots for model validation.  Variogram grade continuity ranges and the 

average distance to drill hole composites were used to classify resources into Measured, 

Indicated, and Inferred categories.  Grade smoothing was examined, and reconciliation with 

2016 production was carried out for further validation of the estimate. 

 

RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 

marketing, political, or other relevant factors which could materially affect the Mineral Resource 

estimate. 

 

MINERAL RESERVES 
The Mineral Reserves as of December 31, 2017, are presented in Table 1-2.  Reserves are 

estimated at a cut-off grade of 0.29 oz/ton Au (in metric units, 9.9 g/t Au), based on 2017 

operating costs, adjustments on processing costs related to the new Toll Milling Agreement, 

and an addition for operating margin.  The methodology is appropriate for a process-capped 

operation, however, now that there is potential for higher production rates, the cut-off grade 

used may be conservative. 

 

In metric units, Mineral Reserves consist of: 

 
• Proven Reserves of 9.44 million tonnes, grading 15.57 g/t Au and containing 4.73 

million ounces of gold. 
 

• Probable Reserves of 6.25 million tonnes, grading 15.48 g/t Au and containing 3.11 
million ounces of gold. 

 

Dilution is estimated by expanding mining shapes by one foot on all sides, and adding a factor 

of 4% to account for backfill dilution.  Mining extraction is estimated as 100%, as confirmed by 

reconciliation to production results. 

 

The 2017 reconciliation results show production of higher tons (157%), lower grades, (79%) 

and higher ounces (125%) than estimated for Mineral Reserves, largely through identification 

of additional mineralization immediately before, and during mining.  A closer match is obtained 

in short-term grade control modelling, with higher tons (121%), lower grades, (87%) and higher 

ounces (105%).

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-9 

This is a long-standing pattern at TRJV, and not, in RPA's opinion, any cause for concern or 

change in estimation or operating practices.  TRJV's practice of strategic planning based on 

cases including factored Inferred Resources therefore seems reasonable. 

 

RPA is not aware of any mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting, or other relevant 

factors that could materially affect the Mineral Reserve estimate. 

 

MINING METHODS 
The mine is accessed via two shafts and a system of internal ramps, and utilizes underhand 

drift and fill mining methods with cemented rockfill.  Ground conditions at Turquoise Ridge are 

poor, and the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) is typically less than 20, or very poor, in ore headings.  

The mine is currently producing 2,300 tons of ore per day.   

 

Key challenges in attainment of production levels and costs are the development of sufficient 

stoping areas and the transition from top-cut development to undercut stoping.  Completion of 

the infrastructure development in the North Zone is necessary to achieve and optimize higher 

production levels.  Site preparation for a 3rd production shaft serving the North Zone is in 

progress, and shaft-sinking is scheduled to start in 2018. 

 
MECHANICAL MINING 
TRJV has a started a pilot program to test mechanical mining via roadheader.  The roadheader 

has rotating cutter heads, which are programmed to excavate the desired shape of drift, 

replacing drill and blast as a method of advancing in soft ground.  More continuous operation 

(in comparison to the cycle of activities in conventional drift advance) and less impact on the 

rockmass are expected to provide operating efficiency advantages. 

 

At the time of RPA's site visit, the roadheader was commissioned and deployed in a test 

heading.  The rock conditions were harder than is ideal for mechanical mining, and the 

machine was down due to excessive wear causing a need for replacement parts. 

 

An area with more suitable ground conditions was being prepared for the roadheader, and 

results should be available in 2018.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-10 

PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 
TRJV has prepared a production schedule based on Mineral Reserves, at a steady-state of 

approximately 850,000 tons per year.  The mine life is 21 years. 

 

The Life of Mine (LOM) plan includes a detailed monthly plan for the first two years with detailed 

mine designs in place for that period.  The remainder of the mine life is based on the plans 

used in the development of the Mineral Reserve estimate.   

 

RPA notes that there is an apparent production gap in 2018, which will be filled in by infill 

drilling in the active production areas (some of which has been completed after closing the 

database for year-end resource and reserve estimation).  TRJV has a long history of success 

in short-term resource conversion and gains from infill drilling (between year-end reserve 

estimation and completing mining in an area). 

 

Recent changes to the Toll Milling Agreement provide opportunities for higher production rates: 

• 850,000 tons per year in 2018 and 2019 

• 1.2 million tons per year in 2020 to 2024 

• Flexibility to process ore elsewhere 

 

These opportunities have not yet been part of reserve-level mine planning. 

 

MINERAL PROCESSING 
Virtually all of the ore mined at Turquoise Ridge is processed at Newmont's Twin Creeks Sage 

mill with the exception of a small tonnage of low grade material that was processed at Barrick's 

Goldstrike operation in 2010 and 75% of the non-conforming ore that was rejected by Newmont 

in 2017 that was also processed at Goldstrike.  In the LOM plan, all of the ore will be processed 

at Twin Creeks, although the 2018 Toll Milling Agreement (TMA) between Barrick and 

Newmont provides terms for alternative processing options. 

 

Ore produced from the Turquoise Ridge mine is stockpiled at TRJV throughout the month.  

The contracted processing limit for the agreement that expired at the end of 2017 was 730,000 

dry tons per year.  The new TMA increases the processing limit to 850,000 tons per year in 

2018 and 2019, increasing to 1.2 million tons per year from 2020 through 2024.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-11 

The Sage mill capacity is 11,500 tons per day to 12,000 tons per day.  The target grind size 

was reduced to 35 μm in 2010 and additional Geho pumps were added to the circuit in 2010 

to increase the plant feed rate that had previously been limited by the pump capacity. 

 

The mill includes semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill followed by a ball mill.  The cyclone 

overflow reports to a thickener.  Thickener underflow reports to an acidification circuit where 

sulphuric acid is added as necessary to ensure adequate autoclave free acid solution levels.  

The free acid concentration for TRJV ore needs to be maintained greater than 30 g/L.  

Thickener overflow solution is returned to the milling circuit.  After acidification, ore slurry is 

added to two identical autoclaves that are operated in parallel.  Two stages of flash heat 

recovery are utilized.  Autoclave discharge is cooled before reporting to the lime neutralization 

circuit.  Autoclave waste gas is cooled and scrubbed before discharging to the atmosphere. 

 

Oxide ore and acidic oxidized sulphide ore slurry are combined in the neutralization circuit.  

After neutralization with the carbonate oxide ore and supplemental lime, the ore slurry reports 

to a carbon-in-leach (CIL) circuit where the ore is leached in cyanide solution to extract the 

gold.  Final tailings slurry is pumped to the tailings containment area.  Tailings settle and decant 

solution is reclaimed and reused in the grinding circuit. 

 

Loaded carbon from the CIL circuit is transferred to the recovery plant.  After acid washing to 

remove inorganic contaminants, the carbon is transferred to the pressure Zadra stripping 

circuit.  Gold is stripped from the carbon using caustic and cyanide solution at elevated 

temperature and pressure.  Pregnant solution from the stripping circuit is pumped to an 

electrowinning circuit where precious metal is removed from the solution as sludge.  The 

sludge is filtered, dried in a mercury retort, mixed with fluxes, and refined into doré bars.  

 

After carbon stripping, the barren carbon reports to the kiln regeneration circuit and returns to 

the CIL circuit.

3RD SHAFT PROJECT 
The 3rd Shaft Project consists of sinking and equipping a 24 ft diameter, concrete-lined shaft 

to 3,250 ft total depth.  Shaft sinking will include two skipping levels, a water pressure break 

level, and a shaft bottom pump level.  Shaft equipping will include a headframe and collar 

house; hoists and hoistroom; shaft steel; surface and underground material handling; and a 

shaft bottom pumping system. 

 

The new shaft will serve as a second production shaft, and provide the following advantages: 

• Improved ventilation 

• Shorter hauls underground 

• Provide a secondary escapeway for the north end of the mine 

• Sustain productivity as working areas move away from #2 Shaft. 

 

Site preparation for the 3rd Shaft started in 2017, and shaft sinking will begin in 2018.  

Production is expected in 2022. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Over the years, many environmental studies have been completed, as required.  Total 

permitted surface disturbance for the TRJV is approximately 1,957.5 acres, or 3.1 square 

miles.  

 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 1-13 

The TRJV maintains a number of permits for the operation.  TRJV tracks permits carefully to 

ensure ongoing compliance.  Environmental staff carries out sampling, monitoring, and record 

keeping and are involved in permit applications and renewals as required. 

 

There are no major challenges with respect to government relations, non-Governmental 

Organizations, social or legal issues, and community development.  TRJV has a community 

and social relations policy that is consistent with Barrick core values and governance.   

 

There are both ongoing and active reclamation and closure activities as well as historic or 

legacy activities. 

 

Ongoing and active reclamation include the Turquoise Ridge and Getchell mine facilities; water 

treatment plant and infiltration system; potable water system; wastewater treatment system; 

tailings impoundment; and access and haul roads.  These components will be reclaimed and 

closed at the end of the mine life.  Reclamation of the historic Getchell processing facilities and 

legacy areas has essentially been completed. 

 

The end-of-year (EOY) 2017 closure cost estimate was US$36.3 million. 

 

CAPITAL AND OPERATING COST ESTIMATES 
Current LOM capital costs for the operation are estimated to be US$723 million, as 

summarized in Table 1-3.  Large capital items for 2018 include completion of site preparation 

for the 3rd Shaft, and beginning of shaft sinking.

2 INTRODUCTION 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by Barrick Gold Corporation (Barrick) to 

prepare an independent Technical Report on the Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources of 

the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture (TRJV) gold mine (the Mine) located in Humboldt County, 

Nevada, USA.  The purpose of this report is to support disclosure of the Mineral Resources 

and Mineral Reserves for the TRJV gold deposit as of December 31, 2017.  This Technical 

Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. 

 

Barrick is a Canadian publicly traded mining company with a portfolio of operating mines and 

projects.  The TRJV mine is located on Barrick's Getchell property on the eastern flank of the 

Osgood Mountains in the Potosi Mining District of northeastern Nevada.  The TRJV mine is a 

joint venture between Barrick (75%) and Newmont Mining Corporation (Newmont, 25%), and 

is operated by Barrick.  Information in this report is based on the TRJV as a whole and not only 

the 75% Barrick interest. 

 

The TRJV consists of the Turquoise Ridge underground mine which produces high-grade 

refractory (carbonaceous/sulphide) gold ores that are processed off-site on a toll milling basis. 

The mine is a long-life (21 years) underground operation, accessed via two shafts and a 

system of internal ramps, and utilizes underhand drift and fill mining methods with cemented 

rock fill.  The mine is currently producing 2,300 tons per day of ore with potential for increases 

from a planned 3rd Shaft and a new toll milling agreement.   

 

Prior involvement by RPA consists of Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource audits in 2007, 

2010, 2013, and 2016.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The property is located in Humboldt County approximately 25 mi northeast of the village of 

Golconda, Nevada, and approximately 40 mi northeast of Winnemucca, Nevada (Figure 4-1).  

The mine is located at approximately 5,300 feet above sea level (FASL) and centred near 

latitude 41° 12' 58'' S and longitude 117° 14' 39'' W. 

 

LAND TENURE 
The Turquoise Ridge property covers an area of 11,993 ha, which consists of 8,212 ha of 

unpatented mining and mill site claims and 3,781 ha of patented/fee land (Figure 4-2).  This 

includes 3,684 ha (1,939 ha of unpatented claims and 1,745 ha of patented/fee land) that make 

up the area of influence for the TRJV.  The surface projection of the mine workings can be 

seen on the site plan (Figure 4-3).  Individual claims are outlined within the boundary.  Blank 

areas without claims are administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  Project 

boundaries are established along the Public Land Survey by section and subsection per the 

official BLM master title plan for T39N, R42E, MDM and T38N, R42E, MDM. 

 

The 337 Unpatented Lode Mining Claims are located on public lands the paramount title to 

which is the United States.  These claims require annual filing and payment of fees to the BLM 

(State Office) and to Humboldt County.  Patented claims require annual payment of tax 

assessments to Humboldt County.   

 

All pertinent permits have been received for the operation.  An Exploration Plan of Operations 

is in place which allows the continued exploration of the property. 

 

The TRJV maintains a number of permits for the operation.  These compliance permits cover 

areas such as air quality, water rights, waste water treatment, tailings storage, hazardous 

materials storage, land reclamation, and community relations.  The TRJV maintains a legal 

obligation register to track permitting and ensure on-going compliance.  Environmental staff 

carry out sampling, monitoring, and record keeping and are involved in permit applications and 

renewals as required.  As of the end of December 2017, all permits were in compliance or 

were in the process of renewal.  Further details on permits can be found in Section 20.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 
The TRJV is located in Humboldt County, Nevada, approximately 40 mi north and east of 

Winnemucca.  The site can be accessed from Interstate 80 approximately 15 mi east of 

Winnemucca at the small town of Golconda.  From Golconda, there is a paved road for 15 mi 

and then a 10 mi stretch of improved gravel road to the mine gate. 

 

The nearest airfield is the Winnemucca Airport, which is 52 mi southwest of the mine site by 

road.  The nearest regional airfield is the Elko Airport, which is 135 mi east of the mine site by 

road. 

 

CLIMATE 
The climate is a semi-arid, steppe climate characterized by dry, hot summers and cold winters.  

Average monthly temperatures range from a low of 23ºF in December to a high of 85ºF in July.  

The mine site receives an annual average of only three inches of precipitation, which falls 

primarily as snow in the winter months, though light seasonal rains commonly occur in April 

and September.  The mine operates on a year-round basis and is not regularly affected by 

climatic conditions. 

 

LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
Northern Nevada is a large underground and open pit mining area.  Personnel and supplies 

for mining operations are relatively easily sourced from the local market, though some 

personnel, particularly professionals, are sourced from both out of state and foreign labour 

markets. 

 

The surface rights secured for the TRJV are sufficient to provide the necessary space required 

for all mining and quarrying activities.  Enough land area also exists on the property to 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 5-2 

accommodate all foreseeable processing plants, tailings and waste storage areas, and waste 

disposal areas. 

 

Water volumes necessary for mining operations are available both through reclamation of 

groundwater inflows into the mine as well as water pumped to surface from several water wells 

which have been drilled across the property.  Electrical power is supplied by one 120 kV 

electrical transmission line which enters the property from the southeast. 

 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 
The TRJV property lies near the base of one of many typically north-south trending mountain 

ranges in the area.  These ranges vary in height, from the valley floors at approximately 4,400 

FASL to peaks at elevations between 5,900 FASL and 8,500 FASL. 

 

Vegetation in the vicinity of the Mine is dominated by low dense shrubs and sage bush mixed 

with sparse native grasses and low flowering plants.

6 HISTORY 
Mining for copper, lead, and silver first began on the mine property in 1883.  Tungsten was 

discovered in 1916 and mined sporadically until 1957. 

 

In 1933, Edward Knight and Emmett Chase, two Winnemucca prospectors, found gold at the 

present day Getchell mine site.  In 1934, Noble H. Getchell purchased the mining claims and 

in 1935, approached George Wingfield to invest in his mining company. 

 

Development of the mine began and a full-scale operation was planned, including construction 

of a mill.  Mill construction required additional financial support so Mr. Bernard Baruch agreed 

to invest in the mine.  In 1936, Newmont also agreed to help finance the construction of the 

Getchell mine as the third partner.  The first gold was poured in 1938 and the company paid 

its first dividend in September of the same year. 

 

Getchell Mine Inc. (Getchell) operated the mine from 1934 to 1945, producing and selling 

788,875 ounces of gold.  From 1939 to 1944, the Getchell mine paid out more than $3 million 

in dividends.  Even though mining was suspended in 1945 due to shortages of labour and 

materials, the mill continued to operate.  A Cottrell precipitator was added to the plant to 

recover arsenic, however, mining of gold was discontinued during World War II.  Getchell was 

allowed to continue operations as a producer of strategic arsenic.  In 1942, a scheelite flotation 

plant was built and put into operation. 

 

Under authorization from the Defense Production Act of 1950, the Defense Minerals 

Administration and the Defense Production Administration instituted measures providing for 

the purchase of a standard-grade (60% tungsten trioxide) concentrate at a ceiling price of $69 

per ton unit.  The Getchell mine was one of the major tungsten producers in the United States.  

Tungsten production ceased in 1957 following the termination of the purchase program in 

1956. 

 

Getchell was purchased by Goldfield Consolidated Mines (Goldfield) in 1960.  Goldfield 

modified the mill and a Dorr-Oliver fluidized solids reactor was installed to roast sulphide ores.  

The mine was closed in 1967 and the mill dismantled, because the tungsten deposit was mined 

out.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 6-2 

The Getchell mine was purchased by Conoco Inc. (Conoco) in the mid-late 1970s as the price 

of gold was on the rise.  Extensive development drilling was completed, but production never 

restarted.  E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont) purchased Conoco in 1982-1983 

and instructed them to sell all mineral interests.  Getchell mine was sold via closed bids. 

 

First Mississippi Corporation and FRM Minerals Inc. purchased the property from Conoco in 

1984 for $5 million.  Heap leaching of the dumps and a drilling program to verify gold deposits 

in the pit walls and below the pit floor began in 1986.  A feasibility study was completed and 

identified the Property's reserves.  In 1987, First Miss Gold Inc. (First Miss) was set up as a 

Nevada corporation and in October 1987, development of the open pit mine and construction 

of the processing facility began.  The use of state-of-the-art pressure oxidation allowed First 

Miss to begin production in 1989. 

 

Exploration drilling centred on the area around the original Getchell Main pit until 1992.  In 

1993, a multi-phase exploration project was started.  The purpose of the project was to 

delineate high grade gold mineralization that had been discovered in the footwall of the 

Getchell Fault.  At the conclusion of the exploration program, an economic evaluation was 

undertaken to determine the feasibility of an underground mine.  Planning and engineering 

were completed and initial underground production started in July 1995 from the Getchell Main 

underground mine.  

 

Meanwhile, a deep drilling program began in 1993 in the Turquoise Ridge area.  A high grade 

mineralized zone was discovered at a depth of 1,400 ft to 2,000 ft below the surface.  Based 

on the results of the drilling program, a feasibility study was initiated for a second underground 

mine at Turquoise Ridge.  Planning and engineering for a new underground mine was 

completed in 1995.  Sinking of the ventilation shaft for the Turquoise Ridge mine began in 

1996.  By mid-1998, a production shaft was completed at a depth of 1,820 ft below the surface.  

 

Placer Dome Inc. (Placer) and Getchell Gold Corp. (Getchell) announced their intent to merge 

on December 13, 1998.  Getchell stockholders approved the merger on May 29, 1999. 

 

After initial evaluation of mining options, Placer shut down the mill and suspended operations 

in July 1999, amid a rapid drop in gold prices.  In February 2000, it was determined that 

additional development was required and mining was suspended at the Getchell Main 

underground mine.  Placer's development efforts focused on continued drilling of the Turquoise

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 6-3 

Ridge and North Zone deposits.  Due to depressed gold prices, the entire property was shut 

down in February 2002. 

 

In June 2002, Placer staff defined a vision for the property, based on the concept of operating 

a low-tonnage, high-grade underground mine, in a safe and efficient manner.  In August 2002, 

a start-up study was initiated to develop the defined vision into a mining plan and to assess 

economic impacts. 

 

As gold prices rose in late 2002, the decision was made to restart the Getchell Main 

underground mine using contract mining.  Production recommenced in February 2003. 

 

On April 15, 2003, Placer announced commencement of construction and the subsequent 

start-up of the Turquoise Ridge mine.  On December 23, 2003, a Joint Venture Agreement 

was signed with Newmont.  Newmont contributed pre-existing royalties and at-cost processing 

at the nearby Twin Creek's Sage mill in exchange for a 25% share of the venture.  In January 

2006, Barrick acquired Placer's 75% interest in the property as part of its acquisition of Placer. 

 

As a result of operational and safety issues, the Getchell underground mine was placed on 

care and maintenance in April 2008.  Full closure of the Getchell underground mine occurred 

in the summer of 2009.  

 

Since the inception of mining on the Getchell/TRJV property to the end of 2017, the Project 

produced approximately 6.0 million ounces of gold (Table 6-1).

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
The Turquoise Ridge gold mine of northern central Nevada is situated within the Basin and 

Range province, near the northeast end of the Osgood Mountains.  The Osgood Range is 

underlain by Cambrian Osgood Mountain Quartzite, Cambrian Preble Formation, Ordovician 

"Comus" Formation and the "upper plate" Valmy Formation.  These units are unconformably 

overlain by the Permian Etchart Formation (Antler Peak Equivalent) of the Roberts Mountains 

Overlap assemblage, and by the Triassic Golconda allochthon.  These uppermost units form 

a belt of outcrops flanking the western and northern sides of the Osgood Range.  All of these 

units are intruded by two generations of felsic intrusive rocks – a set of 114 Ma dacite dikes 

and sills at Turquoise Ridge and Twin Creeks and the 92 Ma Osgood Stock and temporally 

related dikes and sills (Figure 7-1).  To date, no Eocene intrusive rocks have been identified 

at the Getchell, Twin Creeks, or Pinson camps. 

 

The Cambrian-Ordovician rocks were deposited on the platform and slope of the western 

margin of the North American Craton during the breakup of the Rodinia super-continent.  The 

basal Osgood Quartzite and Preble formation are generally regarded to represent sourcing 

from a continental land mass and consist of quartz arenite (Osgood), siltstone, and shale with 

subordinate carbonate lenses (Preble).  Carbonates of the Preble were deposited in an open 

shelf or upper slope marine environment and have undergone minor re-working (winnowed 

oolitic and algal pellet limestones, fragmented trilobites).  Carbonates in the upper part of the 

Preble formation are time equivalent to rocks described as "Comus Formation" at Pinson and 

Twin Creeks.  The Ordovician Comus Formation, as it is described in the deposits of the 

Getchell Trend represents a significant departure from the continental derived clastic and 

argillaceous sediments of the Osgood and Preble formations.  The Comus Formation in the 

footwall of the Getchell Fault is characterized as thin to medium bedded carbonate turbidites, 

slumps, and debris flows with interlayered siliciclastic turbidites and argillaceous mudstone.  

The carbonate beds are interpreted to be derived from a carbonate sea-mount (Cook, internal 

reports and field notes) somewhere east of the Osgood Range.  Algal pellets, fragmented 

coral, and crinoids have been observed as clasts in the carbonate debris flow conglomerates.  

The mine occupies the hanging wall of the Getchell Fault, which is a major, moderately east-

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 7-2 

dipping range front structure bounding the east side of the Osgood Mountains.  At Twin Creeks 

and Turquoise Ridge, the hanging wall of the Getchell Fault consists of Ordovician seafloor 

basalt and mafic sills interlayered with the carbonates and siliciclastic/argillaceous sediments. 

 

The Getchell Fault is one of the most prominent structural features of the region and plays a 

significant role in controlling mineralization and the distribution of rock types.  The Getchell 

Fault generally strikes north-south to north-northwest, and dips approximately 50° to the 

northeast in the vicinity of the mine site.  Geophysical interpretations (mostly gravity and 

magnetic data), coupled with limited outcrop data, suggest that several footwall splays are 

present north of the Getchell underground workings, and that the fault continues to the north 

along several strands to the northern end of the Osgood Mountains. 

 

The northern part of the mineralization trend largely mimics the orientation of the Getchell 

Fault, with complications from northeast and north-south structures.  The mineralized domains 

in this area consist of several discrete bodies which generally strike north-northwest and dip 

moderately to the northeast.

LOCAL AND PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
The stratigraphy at Turquoise Ridge consists of carbonaceous mudstones and limestones, 

tuffaceous mudstones and limestones, polylithic megaclastic debris flows, fine-grained debris 

flows, and basalts, all part of the Ordovician Comus Formation (denoted as sub-units OC0 to 

OC7).  This formation is divided into several stratigraphic units in the vicinity of the Mine.  The 

sedimentary members are commonly characterized by extensive soft-sediment deformation.  

The units are shown in Figure 7-2 and described from top to bottom as follows: 

 

Upper Comus Basalt (also known as the Upper Pillow Basalt) - Pillow basalt, vesicular basalt, 
massive basalt, can be intermixed with medium beds of tuff (10 cm to 30 cm).  

 

Comus Unit 0 - Upper Comus mudstone, basalt, minor limey-dolomitic mudstone, abundant 
shearing. 

 

Comus Unit 1 - Laminated mudstone, siltstone, and tuff. The upper contact is marked by the 
distinctive Gemini Tuff. This unit may include one or more thin, discontinuous fine-grained 

enriched mantle type I (EMI)-texture igneous units as well as ashy/gritty fine lapilli tuff. Tuff 

layers become thinner and can become fragmented towards the bottom of the section. Gemini 

Tuff is a coarse lapilli tuff unit at the top of OC1. Generally, it has light to medium brown colour 

and can be 200 ft to 300 ft thick.  

 
Sage Basalt - Medium-coarse grained basaltic igneous unit. Locally split into two or more units 
(481.6 ± 2.4 Ma). 

 

Comus Units 2 and 3 - Thinly laminated (<0.3 cm) mudstone and siltstone with laminated 
(< 1 cm) carbonates, including silty limestone and calcarenite.  Local thin, discontinuous thin-

bedded siltstone units.  These units generally contain a tuffaceous component (higher percent 

titanium) and can contain thinly laminated ash beds (<3 mm). Bedding within this unit is 

generally disrupted and often contains soft sedimentary textures. Mafic sills/sill-like intrusives 

are present throughout the units, but are more abundant at the top of the section.  Debris flows 

become more common towards the bottom of the units (close to the OC5 contact). 

 

DACR- Rare Earth Dacite - Massive, fine grained, light grey to white, sodium rich dacite, 
generally silicified, sometimes argillized.  Quartz eyes/augens 2-4 mm in size are commonly 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 7-5 

observed with 1 mm to 3 mm bleached alteration halos.  This unit occurs within the southern 

portions of the deposit (around the shafts and south of the shafts surfacing south of the dumps).  

 

North Pillow Basalt - Green aphanitic pillow to massive basalt. This unit contains pillow 
margins that are altered to chlorite and sometimes contain epidote. Calcite > quartz > epidote 

veins are common throughout the body. Alters to a pale brown/tan and can contain 

disseminated pyrite which turns the rock a dark grey colour. In high grade zones, realgar is 

common.  

 

Comus Unit 5 - Limestone dominant (> 60%) with thinly laminated (< 0.3 cm) to very thinly 
bedded (1-3 cm) mudstone.  The contact with OC2/3 can be difficult to identify and is typically 

determined by limestone beds becoming dominant over mudstone beds. The "Powder Hill" 

subunit falls within this unit and is determined by very thinly bedded limestone interbedded 

with very thinly bedded mudstone.  Drill core often breaks like "hockey pucks". 

 

Turbidites: Dark grey thin bedded (3 cm to 10 cm) limestone with thinly laminated (< 0.3 cm), 
dark grey to black mudstones. These sections typically contain euhedral pyrite that is sporadic 

throughout the limestone beds, and generally will follow bedding within the mudstones. 

 

Comus Unit 6 – 75% to 90% limestone with interbedded mudstones. Limestones consist of 
thick (greater than 6 inches) turbidites with thinly laminated, siliceous mudstone layers. These 

carbonates resemble a pure limestone with very little terrigenous material (low in chromium, 

zirconium, etc.). Limestones become marble (composed of calcite and wollastonite, and can 

contain diopside, tremolite, and red-brown garnet) and mudstones become hornfels due to the 

metasomatism of the Osgood Granodiorite stock. 

 

Comus Unit 7 – 65% to 75% limestone with interbedded mudstones. Limestones consist of 
medium (-3 inches) turbidites with thinly laminated, black siliceous mudstone layers. 

 

These Comus units are overlain by more basalts, mudstones, and cherts that may be part of 

the Ordovician-aged Valmy formation or a continuation of the Comus Formation.  The 

thickness of this package ranges from approximately 1,200 ft to 1,500 ft.  

 

Stratigraphy in the Mine is interpreted as having been formed in a passive continental mid-

shelf setting with a carbonate source likely to the southeast.  North-dipping monoclinal folding 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 7-6 

at the north end of the mine may be related to deep-seated normal faulting associated with 

basin margin rifting. Northeast trending structures at the Mine are interpreted to be growth 

faults in an extensional setting where the northwest block of a northwest-southeast structure 

is down-dropped in a rapidly subsiding basin.  Stratigraphic units are thickened on the down-

dropped side and basalts ponded against the discontinuity.  Slumping and debris flows along 

with local disruptions to stratigraphy are associated with scarp failures along the major 

structure.  Thick basalts in the north appear to occupy a post-monoclinal submarine canyon 

that cut through existing stratigraphy prior to basaltic volcanism. 

 

The local geology is illustrated in Figure 7-3 and the generalized mine stratigraphy is illustrated 

in Figure 7-4.

ALTERATION 
Thermal metamorphism associated with the intrusion of the Cretaceous Osgood Stock at 

92 Ma is characterized by ubiquitous development of biotite hornfels within the tuffaceous 

mudstones.  Calc-silicate alteration within carbonates is especially prevalent in the southern 

portions, close to the Osgood stock.  Thermal metamorphism associated with basalts has not 

been recognized. 

 

Hydrothermal alteration consists of spotty silicification and locally extensive decalcification and 

argillization of all rock types. The addition of fine-grained, gold-bearing arsenic and iron 

sulphides comprise the main mineralizing event of the deposit.  Hydrothermal alteration 

boundaries can be extremely sharp even where susceptible rocks are in direct, non-fault 

contact with altered rocks. 

 

STRUCTURE 
The four locally prominent structural fault features at the Mine are:  

1. Getchell Fault Zone and related sub-parallel Getchell-like structures 

2. Northeast-southwest faults 

3. 'Better Be There' (BBT) Fault system 

4. Roberts Mountain Thrust 

 

The Getchell Fault Zone and related sub-parallel Getchell structures in the hanging wall of the 

Getchell Fault strike approximately north-northwest to south-southeast and dip 45° to 55° 

northeast. The Getchell Fault Zone shows a long, complex history of movement displaying 

reverse, strike-slip, and normal displacement characteristics.  

 

Rocks of the Comus Formation in the hanging wall of the Getchell Fault Zone are offset by a 

series of sub-parallel Getchell Fault-like structures.  Dips of these sub-parallel structures are 

generally shallow eastward away from the Getchell Fault Zone.  It is understood that the Main 

Dike and other thin, low angle intrusive dikes were preferentially intruded along these sub-

parallel Getchell faults. 

 

A series of northeast-southwest striking, normal faults are also offsetting the rocks of the 

Comus Formation in the hanging wall.  These faults dip northwest approximately 60° to 75° 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 7-11 

and progressively displace the Comus Formation downward in that direction. These northeast-

southwest faults occur at approximately 400 ft to 600 ft intervals through the deposit.  Similar 

faults are observed cutting through the open-pit at the Twin Creeks Mine four miles to the 

northeast of the Turquoise Ridge Mine.  Changes in stratigraphic thickness across at least one 

of the northeast-southwest faults at Turquoise Ridge suggests that it was active during the 

deposition of the Comus Formation. 

 

The diffuse BBT Fault system strikes in variable directions northward in the hanging wall rocks. 

This fault system dips vertically to steeply to the west at 75°. There are indications that the 

BBT Fault system is normal, displacing rocks slightly to the west.  The BBT Fault system offsets 

the Main Dike.  A portion of the BBT Fault system is intruded by the dacite V-Dike which is in 

turn offset by a sub-parallel Getchell Fault. 

 

The Roberts Mountains Thrust (RMT) is identified as a planar fault zone between the basal 

portions of the Valmy Formation and upper units of the Comus Formation. 

   

Synformal and antiformal geometries within the stratigraphy are indicative of modest east to 

west compression, which probably occurred prior to intrusion of the undeformed Cretaceous 

dikes.  Disharmonic soft-sediment slump folding is common, and is especially well developed 

in the BPH limestones and the limestones and mudstones of the Powder Hill unit. 

 

MINERALIZATION 
Lithology and structure strongly influence the geometry of the mineralization.  Mineralization 

at Turquoise Ridge generally consists of disseminated, micron-sized gold occurring in arsenic-

rich rims forming on pyrite, chiefly within decalcified, carbonaceous rocks.  Many gold bearing 

zones are located close to granodiorite dikes and beneath basaltic intrusions.  TRJV geologists 

recognize the ability of dikes, sills, and other intrusives to concentrate mineralization.  Drilling 

actively targets these zones and the adjacent limestone and mudstone horizons. 

 

The 2017 Mineral Resource was divided into 28 mineralized domains based on stratigraphic, 

structural, and analytical criteria.  To the north, strataform mineralized domains exhibit strike 

lengths exceeding 1,000 ft with typical thicknesses in the 200 ft to 500 ft range.  Down dip 

lengths of over 1,000 ft are common.  Being dominantly stratigraphically controlled, the

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 7-12 

mineralized domains and bedding have a general north-northwest trending strike, of 

approximately 330° to 340°, and dip to the east (between 25° and 45°).   

 

To the south, strataform domains tend to strike north and dip to the east at approximately 30° 

to 60°.  This generalized orientation is slightly different from mineralization occurring in the 

northern part of the deposit.  The two zones are separated by the northeast trending Turquoise 

Ridge shear zone, which could have contributed to the difference in alignment of the two 

zones.  Steeper dipping bodies (-58° east to -80° east) have an average strike length of 230 

ft, average dip length of 160 ft, and average thickness of 40 ft.  Moderately dipping bodies 

(-30° east to -50° east) range from 300 ft to 1,700 ft in strike.  The average dip length is 

approximately 850 ft and thicknesses average 100 ft. 

 

Cross-stratigraphic domains can occur at nearly perpendicular angles to the bedded domains.  

This style of mineralization cuts across bedding and is believed to be more structurally 

controlled.  Mineralization may be controlled by low angle shearing, faulting, joint sets, or the 

intersection of these features.  General trends of these domains are a north-northwest strike 

(340° to 360°) and steeply dipping.  Widths of these domains may be in excess of 100 ft.  To 

the south, cross-stratigraphic bodies strike north and are generally steeply dipping to the west 

or nearly vertical.  Strike lengths vary from 100 ft to 650 ft with an average length of 400 ft.  Dip 

lengths vary from 200 ft to 500 ft with an average dip length of 325 ft.  Thicknesses average 

65 ft.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The Turquoise Ridge deposit is a typical Carlin-type deposit and is characterized by structurally 

and stratigraphically controlled, sediment-hosted, replacement deposits containing micron-

sized gold trapped in arsenopyrite.   

 

Along with the Turquoise Ridge deposit, the Preble, Pinson, Getchell and Twin Creeks 

deposits collectively define the Getchell gold belt, which could be described as the northern 

end of the Battle Mountain - Eureka gold belt as currently defined.  It is recognized that both 

the Carlin and Battle Mountain - Eureka gold belts are alignments of sediment hosted gold 

deposits within structural windows, where autochthonous, lower-plate rocks of the Roberts 

Mountains thrust are exposed through allochthonous, upper-plate rocks.  The origin of these 

structural openings is thought to be the product of multiple deformation events beginning with 

middle-late Devonian Antler Orogeny and continuing through at least Cretaceous time.

9 EXPLORATION 
The Turquoise Ridge deposit was discovered at a depth of 1,400 ft to 2,000 ft below the surface 

by a deep drilling program.  While surface exploration has been completed on the property in 

the past, except for drilling, deep penetration geophysical surveys, and structural mapping to 

extend the known dimensions of the mineralized zones, very little of this exploration was 

directed at the Turquoise Ridge deposit.   

 

TRJV has an extensive database of historic soil, rock chip geochemical sampling, and 

geophysical surveys (gravity, airborne electromagnetic, magnetic, controlled source audio 

magnetotellurics (CSAMT), magnetotellurics (MT), and seismic).  Gold mineralization is not 

directly detectable by geophysical methods, however, surveys map subsurface properties that 

are useful in interpreting lithology, alteration, and structure as guides to gold mineralization.   

 

EXPLORATION POTENTIAL 
The TRJV maintains an aggressive exploration program principally comprising diamond 

drilling.  A brief description of the main targets follows (and shown in Figure 9-1). 

 
• TR Corridor Fault Zone (148 Shear) – Prominent northeast striking fault system hoisting 

generally high angle mineralized zones. Mineralization is open to northeast direction 
below the North Pillow Basalt unit. 
 

• Upper Footwall Pond – Apparently continuous mineralization in the footwall of the Main 
Dike and to the west of the V-Dike and up-dip from the Footwall Pond Domain. 
 

• Separate Fault Extension – Down dip and northeast extension of the Footwall Pond. 
 

• North Zone Getchell Extension – Possible up-dip extension in the northern portion of 
the North Zone.  Also possible connection with Getchell parallel mineralization with 
mineralization in the Getchell open pit. 
 

• South Zone Getchell Extension – Test for possible extensions of the South Zone 
mineralization including drill intercepts to the southwest of the Shaft Zone workings. 
 

• Powder Hill Extension – Test for possible extensions of mineralization in the Powder 
Hill Unit.

The cut-off date for the drill data for the EOY 2017 resource and reserve model was October 

9, 2017.  All 2017 drilling to October 9, 2017 was completed in the underground mine area.     

 

The database for the geologic and resource models resides in Elko, Nevada, and is maintained 

and administered by Barrick Exploration.  Paper copies of the assay certificates are maintained 

on site at Turquoise Ridge. 

 

The drilling programs from 2009 to until 2016 comprised mostly definition drilling to upgrade 

Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves adjacent to and within gaps in the Proven and 

Probable Mineral Reserve shapes.   

 

In addition to the definition drilling in 2015, 2016, and 2017, TRJV drilled 30,726 ft in 21 step 

out and advanced exploration holes.  Exploration drill results indicated further potential for the 

targets noted in Section 9.

CORE SAMPLING 
TRJV follows conventional, industry standard practices for geologic and engineering data 

acquisition and sampling.  Drill core is logged manually for geotechnical data and geology, and 

photographed in a modern facility.  Drill holes are logged by the project geologist who 

describes the downhole lithology, structure, alteration, and mineralization.  The entire length 

of the core is sampled.  Split core samples are nominally five feet but can vary to a minimum 

of one foot to respect lithological contacts, at the discretion of the geologist.  All mineralized 

intervals selected for split core assaying are bracketed on either end with a minimum of fifteen 

feet of visibly unaltered core. 

 

RC SAMPLING 
Reverse circulation drill holes are sampled on five foot intervals, designated by measured 

intervals on the drill's pull down apparatus (cables, chains).  Drill cuttings are initially collected 

in a standard cyclone to reduce the sample's velocity to a safe speed, and then are dropped 

through a splitter.  The splitter is actively managed to produce a sample of approximately five 

kilograms, but sample mass can vary from five to 15 kg.  Standards, blanks, and duplicate 

samples are inserted/collected at the same prescribed rate as for diamond drill holes. 

 

PRODUCTION SAMPLING  
The ore stockpile is sampled by a sonic drill rig with four inch tooling.  Samples are collected 

after two foot runs and placed in clear plastic bags.  Samples are moved on palettes and stored 

in the core logging facility.   

 

Production sampling underground consists of 12 lb (5 kg) samples collected by the load haul 

dump (LHD) unit operator during mucking of the round, at a rate of three to five samples per 

round.  The objective is to standardize muck sampling at one per 35 tons.  Due to low Rock 

Mass Rating (RMR) in ore, blasting results in well fragmented muck and samples are 95% 

sand size.  

 

The waste stream is sampled before skipping to surface to confirm material routing.  Waste 

round samples grading above 0.17 oz/ton Au are re-routed as ore.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 10-4 

RPA notes that core samples for assay are appropriately numbered to be blind to the assay 

laboratory.  However, stockpile sonic drill samples are labelled according to hole number and 

footage.  This is practical in view of driller responsibility for the labelling.  

 

RPA further notes that core recovery in the mineralized zones can be poor (40% to 60%) and 

thus there is a risk of selective material loss that may impact on assay grade.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 
All TRJV drill holes from 2009 to 2017 inclusive used for Mineral Resource estimation were 

assayed at the TRJV laboratory.  Exploration drill hole samples followed a separate protocol, 

and were assayed off site in an accredited commercial laboratory. 

 

TRJV LABORATORY 
Samples are dried for a minimum of eight hours at 120°F and crushed to minus 3/8 in.  The 

crusher is cleaned with compressed air following each sample.  A weekly sieve analysis is 

performed to confirm the material fineness and adjustments are made accordingly. 

 

The entire crushed sample is split with a Jones riffler to achieve a 150 g sub-sample which is 

pulverized to 90% minus 150 mesh using a ring and puck pulverizer.  Daily sieve analyses are 

conducted to ensure the particle size.  Every twentieth sample is pulverized separately as a 

separate QA/QC sample for analysis at an independent laboratory. 

 

Samples are analyzed using fire assay with a gravity finish.  Every batch of 20 samples 

contains a standard, blank, and duplicate sample for QA/QC.  If any of the three QA/QC 

samples returns results outside the accepted range, the entire batch is re-run. 

 

INDEPENDENT LABORATORY 
ALS USA, Inc. (ALS) located in Reno, Nevada, is the primary independent analytical facility 

for analysis of pulp samples from core and RC drilling.  This accredited laboratory conforms to 

requirements of CAN-P-1579 (Requirements for the Accreditation of Mineral Analysis Testing 

Laboratories) and CAN-P-4E (ISO/IEC 17025) (General Requirements for the Competence of 

Testing and Calibration Laboratories). 

 

Samples are prepared on site as noted above. 

 

ALS uses fire assay with an atomic absorption spectroscopic finish (FA/AAS) for low grade 

samples and fire assay with a gravimetric finish for AAS assays ≥10 g/t (0.292 oz/ton).  A multi-

element (51) analysis is performed on selected samples of interest for accessory metals and 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 11-2 

trace elements.  The ALS codes are PREP-31Y for preparation, Au-AA23 and Au-GRA21 for 

gold, and ME-MS41 for multi-element analysis:   

 
• Au-AA23: Fire assay fusion and AAS on a 30 g aliquot (one assay ton) (0.005 g/t Au to 

10 g/t Au) 
 

• Au-GRA21: Fire assay fusion and gravimetric finish on a 30 g aliquot (0.05 g/t Au to 
1,000 g/t Au) 
 

• ME-MS41: Aqua regia (full to partial) digestion and inductively couple plasma mass 
spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analysis 
determination for 51 elements 

 

SECURITY 
Drill core in cardboard core boxes is currently stored in racks inside a recently built core storage 

facility.  Pulps are stored indoors on the second floor of the re-purposed drill core laboratory 

and are secure.   

 

RPA is of the opinion that the sample preparation, analysis, and security procedures are 

appropriate for use in Mineral Resource estimation. 

 

QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL 
The quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program for the core and production samples 

processed at the mine laboratory consists of the insertion of a certified reference material 

(CRM) or standard, blank, and pulp duplicate as internal laboratory checks in each batch of 

samples.  Insertion rate is approximately 1:20 for standards, blanks, and duplicates.  Duplicate 

samples are also sent to ALS for analysis.  

 

CRM and blank samples are considered a failure if the assayed value is greater than three 

standard deviations from the expected value.  The pulp duplicates are compared to the original 

results using the Sign Test which tests the number of positive and negative differences in 

sample pairs.  The t-Test is used to compare the means.  The results are also analyzed using 

regression analysis.  

 

Ongoing monitoring of QA/QC results is completed as assay data are received from the 

laboratory before uploading into the TRJV master database.  Monthly and quarterly review and 

comprehensive analysis of the QA/QC results are carried out.  The QA/QC program is 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 11-3 

monitored closely and all issues identified with assay results are resolved before approval of 

data and its importation into the mine database. 

 

RPA also notes that coarse crush duplicate samples (rejects) are not used by the TRJV.  

Coarse crush duplicates would show contamination at the sample preparation stage that would 

not otherwise be evident.  RPA recommends that coarse crush duplicates are analyzed on a 

regular basis. 

 

RPA reviewed the results for mine geology samples analyzed at the TRJV assay laboratory 

between January 1 and September 30, 2017.  A total of 3,097 in-house standards, 3,139 

blanks, and 3,644 laboratory pulp duplicates were inserted into the sample stream during this 

period.  There were 25 standard failures and two blank failures during this period.  The pulp 

duplicates showed no systematic bias. 

 

During the period from January 1 to June 30, 1,315 pulp duplicates were analyzed at the ALS 

laboratory.  The Sign Test, t-Test, and regression analysis indicate that there is no systematic 

bias in the two sets of data.  

 

These failure rates are acceptable and in RPA's opinion the QA/QC results indicate that the 

data is acceptable for Mineral Resource estimation.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 
RPA checked previous Turquoise Ridge estimates and external data reviews, and has 

conducted independent reviews in 2011, 2013, 2016, and again in the preparation of this 

Technical Report.  RPA completed a variety of validation queries and routines in Vulcan to 

identify any remaining data entry errors.  A validity check for data errors such as out of range 

values, missing intervals, and overlapping intervals was carried out.  The database was found 

to be acceptable and no significant problems were noted.  RPA did not collect independent 

samples as the historical production clearly demonstrates the presence of economic 

mineralization.   

 

DATABASE 
The Turquoise Ridge technical database is being managed by the acQuire system 

implemented in 2004, replacing an earlier database system.  Exploration data from a variety 

of sources are imported into acQuire using a variety of techniques and procedures to check 

the integrity of the data entered.  Data that are logged on paper are subject to validation using 

built-in program triggers that automatically check manually entered data upon upload to the 

database.  In May 2000, Second Door Industries performed a data verification project 

comparing pre-2000 certificates and assay data.  A total of 327,222 assays of the 343,069 

records passed the verification process.  Analytical data are uploaded from digital sources.  

Survey data is uploaded by the project geologist from digital survey files.  Verification is 

performed on all digitally collected data upon upload to the main database, and includes 

checks on surveys, collar co-ordinates, lithology data, and assay data.   

 

Database security and integrity is accomplished by restricting access and user level 

permissions that are set by the Database Manager.  Once data entry and validation are 

completed for a drill hole, access is locked.  There are procedures for updates that retain all 

the original information and prioritize use of the updates. 

 

Due to the historic nature of the assay data, several different assay laboratories have been 

used.  Several negative values below 0.00 ounce per ton were in the database.  Generally, 

laboratories have reported assays with different detection limits.  It is apparent that assays 

returning values below detection limits have been seeded with a negative value.  Through the 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 12-2 

years, this value may have changed depending on the people or company in charge.  TRJV 

has therefore set all historic negative assay values to a 0.000 value. 

 

There are now only two negative values residing in the dataset.  They are '-99' and '-66'.  A 

negative 99 value represents an interval that was purposely not sampled whereas the negative 

66 value indicates an interval of lost core, a lost sample, non-recovered interval, or shotcrete 

or backfill. 

 

Reports are available for QA/QC programs dating from 2002 to present, which suggests any 

drilling performed by Placer has been verified and validated.  Drilling data prior to Placer are 

included in the datasets, and the validity is assumed to be good. 

 

The data, which has now been used extensively for the last ten years, has been corrected for 

location and orientation.  Suspect holes are flagged and will not export.  A visual examination 

of the drill holes, in Vulcan, show spatially valid drill hole collar locations. 

 

Based on RPA's past evaluations and current review, it is RPA's opinion that the data are 

acceptable for the purposes of overall resource and reserve estimation and economic 

assessments.  Some of the data may result in minor inaccuracies in local estimates.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
Turquoise Ridge ore has been processed at Newmont's Twin Creeks operation since 

establishing a joint venture agreement between the previous owner of Turquoise Ridge (now 

a wholly owned subsidiary of Barrick) and Newmont on January 1, 2004.  Initially, ore was sold 

by the TRJV to Newmont and subsequently processed at Twin Creeks, however, this was 

amended to a Toll Milling Agreement (TMA) on July 1, 2006.  This agreement contained 

specifications that the ore must meet in order to be "Conforming Ore," including a specification 

that the ore must have a composite organic carbon (COC) concentration of 0.60% or less.  In 

April 2017 Newmont rejected an ore lot that had a COC concentration greater than 0.60%.  

Subsequently, the parties agreed to a "Non-Conforming Ore Agreement" that provided terms 

for Newmont to process non-conforming ore at Twin Creeks.  The agreement expired at the 

end of the previous TMA on December 31, 2017.  A new TMA was executed in January 2018.  

It is effective from January 1, 2018 until December 31, 2024.  The new agreement increases 

the maximum specification for COC to 1.0%, although higher processing costs are incurred if 

the COC concentration is higher than 0.60%. 

 

Virtually all of the ore mined at Turquoise Ridge is processed at Twin Creeks with the exception 

of a small tonnage of low grade material that was processed at Barrick's Goldstrike operation 

in 2010 and 75% of the non-conforming ore that was rejected by Newmont in 2017 that was 

also processed at Goldstrike.  In the Life of Mine (LOM) plan, all of the ore will be processed 

at Twin Creeks, although the 2018 TMA provides terms for alternative processing options. 

 

Ore produced from the Turquoise Ridge mine is stockpiled at TRJV throughout the month.  

The contracted processing limit for the agreement that expired at the end of 2017 was 730,000 

dry tons per year.  The new TMA increases the processing limit to 850,000 tons per year in 

2018 and 2019, increasing to 1.2 million tons per year from 2020 through 2024. 

 

STOCKPILE AND SAMPLING 
At the start of every month, the ore stockpiled the previous month undergoes a rigorous 

program to determine the quantity of contained gold.  A sonic drill is used to drill vertical holes, 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 13-2 

15 ft deep on a 20 ft grid.  Angled holes are drilled around the perimeter of the stockpile.  

Samples are taken from each two feet of the hole and split in thirds.  One sample is assayed 

by Barrick, one is assayed by Newmont, and the third is reserved.  Averages of the two assays 

are used unless the assays conducted by each company are outside the splitting limit.  If this 

happens a sample goes to an umpire laboratory and the settlement is based on the assay that 

was closest to the umpire assay unless the difference is too great.  If this is the case the umpire 

assay is used for the settlement. 

 

In addition to gold, the samples are assayed for organic carbon since the gold recovery formula 

is dependent upon the organic carbon content of the ore. 

 

Between 600 and 800 samples are collected from each stockpile.  The locations of the holes 

are surveyed and the assay data is used to create a block model of the stockpile using Inverse 

Distance to the fourth power (ID4).  The quantity of gold is based on the results from the 

modeling. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the current sampling is thorough and appropriate.  In comparison to the value 

of the high-grade material (i.e., approximately 0.5 oz/ton Au) that is processed the cost of 

drilling, sampling, and assaying is not significant. 

 

TONNAGE DETERMINATION 
Trucks, containing on average 45 tons of ore, are weighed twice, first on the Turquoise Ridge 

scale, and then on the official TRJV scale located at Twin Creeks.  Care is taken to reconcile 

the truck count.  A Shipping Report is produced monthly which details the truck ticket number 

by the trucking contractor, the truck ticket information when it leaves the Turquoise Ridge site, 

as well as the recorded data at both truck scales.  This data is all reconciled monthly and, if 

there are any errors, an adjustment is made. 

 

MOISTURE DETERMINATION 
In order to obtain a moisture determination for the calculation of a dry weight, samples are 

taken as the trucks dump at the run-of-mine (ROM) stockpile at Twin Creeks.  The TMA 

stipulates that the ore is placed in a small pile which is allowed to grow to at least two 

truckloads.  The face of the pile is sampled three times during each shift, generating two 5-gal 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 13-3 

buckets of sample per shift.  The dry tons for each truckload delivered during the shift are 

calculated from this one moisture determination.  

 

GOLD RECOVERY 
The agreed gold recovery is calculated at month end according to the following formula: 

 

% 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 = 𝑎𝑎 × �
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶
𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴

� +  𝑏𝑏 

where: 

 a and b are constants determined each month by Twin Creeks from operating data 
 COC is the agreed organic carbon content in weight percent 

 Au is the agreed gold content in oz/ton from the stockpile 
 

Typical recovery values for TRJV ore are in the 90% to 94% range, although monthly values 

have been as low as 85%.  The weighted average recovery was 92.9% in 2017. 

 

METALLURGICAL ACCOUNTING 
The metallurgical accounting process is monitored by the TRJV Process Committee on a 

monthly basis.  The Process Committee is made up of two people appointed by Barrick and 

two members appointed by Newmont.  A Newmont metallurgist monitors the metallurgical 

accounting on a daily basis.  The ore is shipped in individual lots, is commingled with other 

ores, and then the allocated gold is back calculated by Newmont based on the gold recovery 

formula and various empirical relationships.  The metallurgical accounting process is described 

below. 

 

The recovery formula provided above calculates the "amenable ounces" in the metallurgical 

accounting documentation.  The amenable ounces are then normalized at month end to 

"indicated ounces" based on Twin Creeks' month-end production and an inventory survey of 

the Sage mill using the TRJV percentage of total amenable ounces processed.  The 

"theoretical ounces" in the Sage mill attributable to TRJV can then be calculated from this 

based on the current month's production and the change in inventory month to month.  Finally, 

an allocation of "poured ounces" attributable to TRJV for the month from the overall ounces of 

gold produced in the month can be made based on the percentage of theoretical ounces 

attributable to TRJV ore compared to the overall theoretical ounces from all ore sources. 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 13-4 

Generally, the poured/sold gold ounces in a month, after factoring in the refinery month over 

month change in inventory, is very close to the "indicated ounces", although there are small 

metallurgical discrepancies month to month and year to year.  On an annual basis, these 

discrepancies are less than one percent of the total gold produced. 

 

In RPA's opinion, metallurgical accounting is reasonable and consistent with typical industry 

standards. 

 

For the 2018 LOM plan, a gold recovery of 92% has been used throughout.  RPA agrees with 

the use of this value. 

 

METALLURGICAL TESTING 
Historically, Barrick metallurgists took monthly composite samples from the TRJV stockpiles 

and performed bench top autoclave tests to validate the plant performance.  In general the 

difference in recovery was less than one percent. 

 

In 2017, Hazen Research Inc. completed a series of six tests using a sample from Turquoise 

Ridge that had a head grade of 0.5 oz/ton Au and 0.6% COC and variable testing conditions.  

The results were consistent with the historical results. 

 

For operating mines, unless new ore that will be fed to the mill is expected to change 

appreciably, RPA considers historical data to be most representative of the recoveries that will 

be achieved going forward.   

 

Figure 13-1 shows the recovery as a function of COC/Au Head Grade from January 2012 to 

December 2017.

FIGURE 13-1   RECOVERY AS A FUNCTION OF COC AND GOLD HEAD GRADE 
 

 
 

This graph shows that based on the very low coefficient of correlation (i.e., R2), there does not 

appear to be a relationship between gold recovery and the organic carbon concentration 

divided by the gold head grade in oz/ton as assumed by the gold recovery equation. 

 

Finally, Figure 13-2 demonstrates the range of gold recoveries estimated using the gold 

recovery equation and the monthly equations (i.e., linear intercept and slope) established by 

Twin Creeks.  The calculation methodology assumes that the gold grade and COC 

concentration are approximately the same as the average over the six years from January 

2012 through December 2017 (i.e., 0.5 oz/ton Au and 0.6% COC).

FIGURE 13-2   RANGE OF ESTIMATED GOLD RECOVERY 
 

 
 

This graph shows that the actual gold recovery is quite variable over time.  Using the same 

input of 0.5 oz/ton Au and 0.6% COC in the recovery equation and varying the intercept and 

slope of the linear equations using the information provided by Twin Creeks, results in an 

average estimated gold recovery of 92.0% ranging from a minimum of 86.1% to a maximum 

of 96.5%.  In RPA's opinion, this wide range of results using constant input data indicates that 

the recovery estimate is not particularly reliable for the Turquoise Ridge ore.  Therefore, efforts 

should be made to develop a more accurate estimation methodology. 

 

GOLD PRODUCTION 
Total gold production by TRJV for 2017 was estimated to be 281,077 ounces.  The average 

grade processed in the Sage mill for 2017 was estimated to be 0.441 oz/ton Au, 0.619% COC, 

and mill recovery was approximately 92.6%.  Final production data for 2017 will be available 

after settlement is reached with Newmont.  Due to the terms of the TMA, the settlement takes 

several months after the ore is processed and the ore is processed the month after it is mined 

due to the stockpiling, sampling, assaying, and other procedures that are agreed upon by 

Newmont and the TRJV.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
SUMMARY 
Table 14-1 summarizes the underground Mineral Resources, exclusive of Mineral Reserves, 

at TRJV.  The Mineral Resource estimate has an effective date of December 31, 2017.  The 

resource estimates are based on an October 2017 block model.  RPA examined the EOY2017 

Mineral Resource estimate and is of the opinion that it meets or exceeds industry standards 

and is acceptable to support reserve work. 

 

The Mineral Resources were estimated by conventional 3D computer block modelling based 

on surface and underground diamond drilling and core assaying.  Geologic interpretation of 

the drilling data was carried out and wireframes were constructed for 28 gold mineralized 

domains.  Assays were composited to five foot intervals within the domains and statistical 

analysis was carried out to determine grade capping levels for each domain.  Variography was 

used to determine search parameters and inverse distance squared (ID2) was employed for 

grade interpolation in the block model.  Alternative interpolations by nearest neighbour (NN) 

methods were compared using swath plots for model validation.  Variogram grade continuity 

ranges and the average distance to drill hole composites were used to classify resources into 

Measured, Indicated, and Inferred categories.  Grade smoothing was examined, and 

reconciliation with 2016 production was carried out for further validation of the estimate. 

 

The underground Mineral Resources in Table 14-1 are reported at a breakeven cut-off grade 

of 0.23 oz/ton Au based on operating costs, gold recoveries, and a gold price of US$1,500/oz.   

 

Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 7.50 million tons grading 0.268 oz/ton Au 

and contain 2.01 million ounces of gold (exclusive of Mineral Reserves).  In addition, Inferred 

Mineral Resources total 2.5 million tons grading 0.38 oz/ton Au and contain 0.95 million ounces 

of gold.  Mineral Resources are broken down by ten mining regions as listed in Table 14-2. 

 

In metric units, the Mineral Resources consist of: 

 
• Measured Resources totalling 3.93 million tonnes grading 9.03 g/t Au and containing 

1.14 million ounces of gold.

• Indicated Resources totalling 2.88 million tonnes grading 9.37 g/t Au and containing 
0.87 million ounces of gold. 
 

• Inferred Mineral Resources totalling 2.3 million tonnes grading 13.0 g/t Au and contain 
0.95 million ounces of gold.

RESOURCE DOCUMENTATION 
The following information in support of the Mineral Resource estimate was provided by TRJV: 

 
• A 2017 mid-year model and associated working files to review the block modelling 

workflow. 
 

• A paper copy of the modelling procedure.  
 

• An updated 2017 year-end model with all supporting database files and scripts used in 
its construction. 

 
• Wireframes of grade shells, domains, lithology, alteration, topography, pit designs, 

model limits, underground workings, and faults. 
 

• Excel workbooks and Word files documenting the block modelling procedure and 
parameters utilized, variography, and QA/QC examples.  

 
• An Excel workbook used to derive the final Mineral Resource table. 

 

The 2018 Mineral Resource estimate is described in a comprehensive report entitled 

"Turquoise Ridge Mine, 2017 End Of Year Resource Model", covering all aspects of data 

collection, verification, assaying, QA/QC, data analysis, and resource estimation.  The final 

resource files have access limited to the TRJV resource group and are backed up in the Barrick 

central office in Elko.   

 

RPA performed all of its geological and resource model reviews and validation in Maptek 

Vulcan software.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and database work was completed using 

SQL and Phinar x10 software interrogation of exported comma separated value (CSV) files 

from the Vulcan databases and block model used in the Mineral Resource estimate.  

 

RESOURCE DATABASE 
TRJV maintains the database in AcQuire software which generates CSV text file exports for 

Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation.  RPA received the Mineral Resource data 

from TRJV in CSV format along with a native Vulcan database and associated composite files 

derived from the database.   

 

The Mineral Resource database provided contains drill hole information available as of 

October 9, 2017.  The TRJV database comprises a total of 16,326 drill holes containing 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 14-5 

6,623,987.72 ft of gold assays.  A summary of records in the TRJV drill database is listed 

below. 

• Drill holes: 16,326 
• Channels: 0 
• Surveys: 220,148 
• Gold Assays: 1,131,663  
• Lithology: 488,804 

 

The underground Mineral Resource estimate is based on 6,142 underground holes in the 

extents of the 2017 Mineral Resource.  An additional 146 drill holes have been added to the 

underground database at the time of this report but are not included in the Mineral Resource 

database.   

 

Methods and results to verify the historic drill hole data are provided in Section 10 Drilling of 

this Technical Report.  Section 12, Data Verification, describes the resource database 

verification steps carried out by RPA.   

 

RPA completed a variety of validation routines in Vulcan software and exploratory database 

queries.  RPA notes that the data provided is of sufficient quality to facilitate the Mineral 

Resource estimate.  RPA is of the opinion that the information provided meets industry 

standards.  

 

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
TRJV analyzed the drill hole database using histograms and box plots of uncapped gold 

assays.  TRJV also performed a drill hole spacing study and stored interpolated values into 

the block model.  RPA performed its own high-level EDA on CSV exports of the Vulcan 

database and composite files, based on the mineralized domains.  RPA is of the opinion that 

the TRJV Mineral Resource database is suitable for the purpose of grade estimation. 

 

TOPOGRAPHIC SURFACES 
TRJV has updated the surface topography every few years, with the latest Light Detection and 

Ranging (LiDAR) survey data obtained in 2012.  The Mineral Resource model data did not 

utilize a topographic surface since it is entirely underground, however, a small proportion of 

the drill holes used in the Mineral Resource estimate were surface holes.  RPA compared an 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 14-6 

older simplified topographic surface to the drill collars (in Vulcan software) and found that they 

coincided except where later excavation occurred.  RPA is of the opinion that the surface holes 

are positioned accurately and appropriate for inclusion in the Mineral Resource estimate.  

 

GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION 
Lithological models first created were based on 50 ft sectional (east/west) data interpreted by 

TRJV Senior Geologists.  An extensive re-logging of core photos was undertaken to identify 

stratigraphic contacts. The geological data previously residing in the database were either 

overly complex or too broad and non-descript to model contacts. Lines were drawn in Vulcan 

and meshed together to create new surfaces. The surfaces were 'booleaned' against a 

triangulation covering the model extents to create closed, valid three-dimensional 

lithological/stratigraphic units.  A refinement of this process occurred in 2010, and another 

update was done in 2013.  This interpretation is the basis for the 2017 end of year geologic 

model. 

 

TRJV carried out an extensive re-interpretation/re-logging of down-hole geology by examining 

the library of core photos on the Turquoise Ridge property, and generated 16 lithological 

triangulations within the lithologic model extents and flagged them into the Mineral Resource 

model using codes with values over 100.  Some lithologies occur in multiple units (argillaceous 

mudstone, soft-sediment slumped micrite), so TRJV defined model units according to distinct 

lithologic characteristic in these mixed populations of rock types.  TRJV geological staff created 

solids by linking wireframe surface meshes between 3D polylines, and then truncating the 

surfaces against a triangulation covering the model extents to create closed, valid three-

dimensional lithological/stratigraphic units. Table 14-3 outlines the lithological solids and 

corresponding numerical codes in the block model domain field.

STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION 
TRJV geological staff constructed wireframe surfaces representing five major fault groups: the 

Getchell group, the TR group, the near-surface RMT group, the BBT group, and the Giant fault.  

Known mineralization often coincides with the intersection of major fault groups and previously 

established mineral domains.  Mineralization also frequently extends away from known fault 

traces and into favourable stratigraphy, following porous, decalcified layers.   

 

DOMAIN MODELLING 

MINERALIZED DOMAINS 
Three-dimensional mineralized domains were generated from sectional polygons digitized 

directly into Maptek Vulcan software, taking mineralization trends, stratigraphy, and structural 

controls into account.  Polygons were created at nominal 25 ft spacing, striking 230° 

(northeast-southwest normal to the Getchell Fault), snapping to drill hole intercepts whenever 

possible.  Polygons were linked together to create mineralized domain triangulated solids.  The 

domains modelled were constructed to an approximately 0.07 oz/ton Au cut-off grade, based 

upon diamond drill data, underground channel sampling data, underground geological 

mapping, and underground mine excavations.  Domains reflect hard boundaries used to 

constrain grade interpolation to areas of defined mineralization.  A total of 28 mineralized 

domains were modelled for the deposit. For 2017, TRJV staff used Vulcan's 3D Geologic 

Sculpting Tool to move and add vertices to pre-existing domains. Table 14-4 shows the domain 

names as well as the numerical codes for each domain flagged in the block model (domain) 

and composite databases (bound).  Figure 14-1 shows a plan view example with the locations 

of the domains as well as the underground workings.   

 

RPA reviewed the wireframe models with respect to drilling.  RPA notes that the mineralized 

envelopes are well-designed and snapped to assay boundaries on drill holes, except where 

locally modified by Vulcan's new wireframe 'push-pull' techniques to alter solid topology 

without constructing polylines.   

 

For 2017, TRJV has elected to simplify the nomenclature regarding North and South zones 

(mentioned in Section 7) which comprise the mineralized domains and mining regions, as 

further drilling has shown north-south mineralization continuity.  The North Zone/South Zone 

nomenclature now represents an unnecessary third layer of complication.  Going forward,

MINING REGIONS IN CONTEXT OF MINERALIZED DOMAINS 
For 2017, TRJV has elected to subdivide the Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves into 

mining regions rather than by mineralized domains.  Table 14-5 shows mining regions and 

mineralized domains included in them.  The geographic locations of the mining regions are 

shown in Figure 14-2.

CAPPING OF HIGH GRADE VALUES 
TRJV applied a capping grade according to inflections on log probability plots, and tails on 

histograms in conjunction with decile analysis. TRJV applied capping thresholds to the raw 

assays.  This approach is less likely to allow inordinately high grade to be composited into 

adjacent low grades, which then fall below the capping threshold.  RPA reviewed TRJV's 

capping analysis and is of the opinion that the thresholds applied are generally appropriate to 

each domain and reasonable for grade interpolation.  Table 14-6 summarizes capping 

thresholds for the EOY 2017 resource estimation.

DENSITY TESTWORK 
Prior to 2004, densities assigned to models ranged between 0.071 tons/ft3 and 0.082 tons/ft3. 

Underground samples were collected for density determinations throughout the last half of 

2004 and the beginning of 2005.  A total of 161 samples were collected from the Turquoise 

Ridge mine.  Sample locations (or rock types) were not noted; therefore, an average density 

was used for all rock types.  Of the 161 samples, 153 were used to determine the average 

density.  TRJV personnel removed eight samples from the dataset because they were not 

consistent with the density values measured historically for those rock types.  Although this is 

a very small number of determinations, it was the only documented dataset available.  Based 

on this dataset, an average density of 0.075 tons/ft3 was determined.  

 

In 2009, TRJV completed a study to examine the validity of the in situ material density 

assumption (0.075 tons/ft3).  Density is the mass of a substance per unit volume, and can be 

measured if the volume is easily measured (as in a length of drill core).  For TRJV's 

underground drilling, the core is HQ size with a nominal core diameter of 2.5 in. and a volume 

of 58.9 in.3/ft of core length.  The TRJV study involved weighing of full core boxes of a single 

rock type and measuring the total length of core in each box.  Every fourth core box was 

weighed unless it contained multiple rock types or contained significant core loss.  Rock type 

and alteration was also noted, but box weights, sample tags, and core blocks were subtracted 

from the box weight before the calculations.  A total of 558 core boxes were weighed, 

comprised of six rock types: mud dominated (0.0781, the primary ore host), carbonate 

dominated (0.0810), dacite (0.0789), silica dominated (0.0770), basalt (0.0870), and all ore 

(0.0779).  The six rock types were further subdivided according to alteration intensity.   

 

TRJV concluded that the weighted average of all rock types, except basalt, regardless of 

alteration intensity, is 0.078 tons/ft3.  Basalt is denser, averaging 0.087 tons/ft3.  These results 

agree well with the historically used 0.075 tons/ft3 for rock type other than basalt, however, for 

the 2009 and 2010 reports, the density for all rock types was changed to 0.077 tons/ft3.  The

two domains composed of basalt were assigned a density of 0.087 tons/ft3.  The 2013 Mineral 

Resource estimates are based on a bulk density of 0.076 tons/ft3.   

 

In 2015, an exhaustive reconciliation analysis strongly implied that the mineral domain density 

of 0.077 tons/ft3 was too light.  The study reasoned that ore usually contained mixed 

proportions of altered and unaltered rock, and that production since 2011 averaged 6% more 

ounces than predicted in the Mineral Resource models.  TRJV thus increased the density for 

mineralized domains from 0.077 tons/ft3 to 0.079 tons/ft3 for the EOY 2016 model to bring 

predicted gold content more in line with realized gold production. 

 

RPA is of the opinion that TRJV has taken reasonable steps in density determinations over 

the life of the operation and that the density used for Mineral Resource estimation is valid.  

RPA recommends that TRJV continue to take density measurements over the life of the mine. 

 

COMPOSITING 
TRJV composited drilling information to five foot lengths in mineralized domains and 20 ft 

lengths in the surrounding lithologies. TRJV generated an additional 10 ft composite database 

for additional Sequential Gaussian Simulations and a 'straight' desurveyed (XYZ coordinate 

sample centroids derived from original FROM and TO values logged) assay composite file for 

comparative statistics.  Composites were split at domain boundaries and flagged with the 

domain code in a 'bound' field which corresponds to the 'domain' field in the block model.  

TRJV then analyzed raw assay, capped grades, and composite statistics by domain.  Table 

14-7 summarizes the drill and composite databases.  

 

RPA performed independent statistical analyses of the raw assay and composite data and 

agrees with TRJV's approach.

VARIOGRAPHY 
TRJV completed variographic analyses by domain, using the five foot or 20 ft composited data.  

Sage 2001 software was used to determine the major, semi-major, and minor directional axes 

of greatest continuity.  TRJV modelled experimental variograms using two nested spherical or 

exponential (practical range) structures. Isotropic, omni-directional variograms were generated 

for domains with sparse or poorly correlated data.  Ellipses were visually checked in Vulcan 

using the view search ellipse function.   

 

RPA performed spot checks of search parameters in the block estimation parameter files and 

found that they correspond with the search distances and orientations in the variography 

results.

BLOCK MODEL 
TRJV performed block modelling and grade estimation in Maptek's Vulcan Version 10.1.2 

software.  The unrotated block model extents are shown in Table 14-9.  The model is limited 

to a block size of 5 ft x 5 ft x 5 ft inside the mineralized domains.  Mined blocks in the model 

were flagged with an integer representing the year that the block was mined.  A description of 

the main block model attributes is given in Table 14-10.  There are additional flag, distance, 

and other variables for each metal that are not shown.   

 

In RPA's opinion, the block sizes are appropriate for the drill hole spacing and proposed mining 

method, and are suitable to support the estimation of Mineral Resources.  Comparisons 

between wireframe and block model volumes are reasonable.

GRADE INTERPOLATION 
TRJV interpolated grades into blocks on a parent cell basis using ID2 in nine separate 

estimation passes according to relatively standard Barrick grade estimation practice.  Gold 

estimates are not density weighted.  Density is assigned at 0.079 tons/ft3 for mineralized 

domains.  No high grade indicators, dynamic anisotropy, or high yield restrictions were used 

in the 2017 block model grade interpolation.  Table 14-11 shows the minimum and maximum 

samples used in each estimation pass.  All passes were limited to one sample per drill hole.  

Table 14-12 shows the search orientations and distances used in each pass, for each domain. 

 

RPA reviewed the 2017 mid-year and 2017 end of year Vulcan projects provided by TRJV, 

visually inspected the databases and block estimates, reviewed the estimation parameter files, 

flagging, block calculation scripts, and run scripts.  RPA is of the opinion that the grade 

interpolation strategy is reasonable and conforms to industry standards.

BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION 
TRJV validated the block model using a combination of comparative histograms, statistical 

comparisons, and a Nearest Neighbour check estimate.  TRJV also performed a Sequential 

Gaussian Simulation using the average of 100 unique estimation realizations and stored the 

average value into the block model to quantify the degree of uncertainty in the model. TRJV 

also maintains a separate block for these simulations. Further, the 'risk' variable in the block 

model is used to weight grade against the drill spacing at the block location for a qualitative 

visualization of uncertainty.

RPA VALIDATION 
The December 31, 2017 resource estimation is appropriate for the style of gold mineralization, 

in RPA's opinion.  The following is a list of some of the checks performed on the resource 

model by RPA: 

• Checked for duplicate drill hole traces, twinned holes. 
 

• Checked collar locations for zero/extreme values. 
 

• Checked assays in database for:  
o missing intervals 
o long intervals  
o extreme high values  
o blank/zero values  
o reasonable minimum/maximum values 

   
• Ran validity report to check for:  

o out of range values  
o missing interval  
o overlapping intervals, etc. 

   
• Checked for overlapping wireframes to determine possible double counting. 

o Solids have priority levels in block definition file. 
o Diamond drill hole domains are likewise flagged by priority. 

   
• Checked orebody/wireframe extensions beyond last holes to see if they are reasonable 

and consistent. 
   

• Compared basic statistics of assays within wireframes with basic statistics of 
composites within wireframes for both uncut and cut values. 

   
• Checked for capping of extreme values. 

   
• Checked for reasonable compositing intervals. 

   
• Checked that composite intervals start and stop at wireframe boundaries. 

   
• Checked that assigned composite rock type coding is consistent with intersected 

wireframe coding. 
   

• Checked if block model size and orientation is appropriate to drilling density, 
mineralization, and mining method. 
   

• Checked search volume radii and orientations against available variography. 
   

• Checked interpolation parameters against available variography. 
   

• Visually checked block resource classification coding for isolated blocks.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 14-29 

• Generation of an independent Mineral Resource report to match with the TRJV 
estimate. 
 

• Compared block statistics (zero grade cut-off) with assay/composite basic statistics. 
 

• Swath plots of composites versus blocks and drilling (e.g., Figure 14-4).  
 

• Visually compared block grades to drill hole composite values on sections and/or plans 
(e.g., Figure 14-5). 
 

• Visually checked for grade banding, smearing of high grades, plumes of high grades, 
etc., on sections and/or plans. 

 

RPA is of the opinion that the block model is suitable to support Mineral Resource and Mineral 

Reserve estimation.

CLASSIFICATION 
Definitions for resource categories used in this report are consistent with those used in the 

CIM (2014) definitions and adopted by NI 43-101.  In the CIM classification, a Mineral 

Resource is defined as "a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest 

in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable 

prospects for eventual economic extraction".  Mineral Resources are classified into Measured, 

Indicated, and Inferred categories.  A Mineral Reserve is defined as the "economically 

mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource" demonstrated by studies at 

Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate.  Mineral Reserves are classified into Proven 

and Probable categories.   

 

Barrick's Mineral Resource classification scheme uses a combination of factors including the 

search pass iteration, distances to samples, and number of holes.  TRJV used the following 

criteria for Measured Mineral Resources: 

 

1. If any part of a block was pierced by a drill hole it was deemed Measured, using a 
5 ft box search emanating from the block centroid. 

 
2. If a block centroid lay within a 10 ft radius of any block that was mined out, it was 

deemed Measured.  
 

3. If a block centroid lay within two samples from two different drill holes within a 30 ft 
radius, it was deemed Measured. 

 

Indicated Resource block criteria are based on finding a minimum of two composites, from two 

different drill holes being found within 80% of the variogram range, within a mineralized 

domain.  These criteria are satisfied during the second and third estimation passes. 

 

Inferred Resource block criteria are based on finding a minimum of two composites, from two 

different drill holes, being found within 90% of the variogram range, within a mineralized 

domain. The criteria are satisfied during the fourth and fifth estimation passes. 

 

Passes 6, 7, 8, and 9 are used for estimation and validation purposes, however, the 

estimations remain unclassified. 

 

TRJV geological staff then run a post-processing script which eliminates un-estimated blocks 

and mined blocks, upgrades blocks within 10 ft of a block centroid that is mined out to 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 14-33 

Measured Resource category, and upgrade blocks within 30 ft radius of two composites to 

Measured Resource category. 

 

RPA reviewed these criteria and performed a visual inspection of the results on cross sections.  

RPA is of the opinion that the classification technique is appropriate.   

 

CUT-OFF GRADE 
Cut-off grade inputs for TRJV are based on recent operating experience, projected costs, and 

Barrick corporate guidance.  Separate Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve cut-off grades, 

based on the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve gold prices, are used to report the Mineral 

Resources and Mineral Reserves.  All blocks that fail to meet the cut-off grade are classified 

as waste.  The inputs used to determine the Mineral Resource cut-off grade of 0.23 oz/ton Au 

are shown in Table 14-13.  The principal difference between the Mineral Reserve and Mineral 

Resource cut-off grade calculation is the gold price of $1,200/oz Au and $1,500/oz Au, 

respectively.

RPA notes that the inputs to the cut-off grade do not account for upcoming changes to the 

operation, including higher production rates, installation of the 3rd Shaft, and use of 

roadheaders for mining softer ores.  There is potential for cut-off grades to be reduced over 

time, as discussed further in Sections 15 and 16.

3. Mineral Reserves are estimated using a long-term gold price of US$1,200 per ounce. 
4. Numbers may not add due to rounding. 
5. Mineral Reserves are reported on a 100% basis.  Barrick's and Newmont's attributable share of Mineral 

Resources are 75% and 25%, respectively. 
 

RPA is not aware of any mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting, or other relevant 

factors that could materially affect the Mineral Reserve estimate. 

 

Mineral Reserves are defined for ten different regions of the Mine, as shown in Figure 15-1.

RPA notes that depletion in Table 15-2 accounts for material mined in Q4 2017.  Some of this 

material remains in stockpile, and some has been processed at Twin Creeks, although none 

of it has been through final reconciliation. 

 

CUT-OFF GRADE 
TRJV documents updated cut-off grade inputs and calculations twice a year.  Cut-off grade 

inputs are based on recent operating experience, projected costs, and Barrick corporate 

guidance.  Several different cut-off grades are determined, including: 

 Break-Even Cut-Off Grade (BCOG) – often used for reserve estimation. 
 

 Incremental Cut-Off Grade (ICOG) – based on variable mining and processing costs, 
not used at TRJV due to milling constraints. 
 

 Mill Cut-Off Grade (MCOG) – a set value based on the Toll Milling Agreement. 
 

 Resource Cut-Off Grade (RCOG) – used for resource estimation, parameters as 
described above. 
 

 Operating Cut-Off Grade (OCOG) – incorporates adjustments to the BCOG.  Used for 
the current Mineral Reserve estimate, includes a margin for increased profitability.

All blocks that fail to meet the cut-off grade are classified as waste.  The inputs used to 

determine the Mineral Reserve OCOG of 0.29 oz/ton Au are shown in Table 15-3.

Total costs $/ton 317.48 
Gold Metal Recovery % 92 
Gold Selling Price US$/oz 1,200 
Reserve Cut-off Grade oz/ton Au 0.29 

 

A cut-off grade of 0.324 oz/ton was applied to areas near the Getchell fault, due to higher 

mining costs incurred in more difficult ground conditions.  

 

RPA notes that the inputs to the cut-off grade do not account for upcoming changes to the 

operation, including variable terms in the new Toll Milling Agreement (TMA), higher production 

rates, installation of the 3rd Shaft, and use of roadheaders for mining softer ores.   

 
 TMA: the new agreement includes some terms indexed to gold prices, and a variable 

component based on organic carbon content.   
 

o The carbon adjustment is based on average reserve values.  For the next 
reserve update, this could be applied with greater resolution, where significant 
impacts to costs/cut-off grades exist. 

 
 Higher Production Rates: the new TMA allows for an increase to 850,000 tons per year 

in 2018 and 2019, and to 1.2 million tons per year in 2020 to 2024.  There is also some 
opportunity to consider alternate processing options. 

 
o Higher rates allow fixed costs (a portion of mining costs, and all G&A costs) to 

be spread over more tons, at lower unit rates.  Cut-off grades would therefore 
be reduced. 

 
 3rd Shaft: the impact of the new shaft on operating costs has yet to be determined. 

 
 Mechanical Mining: the cost impact of mining by roadheader has yet to be determined.  

Continuous operation in 2018 should provide useful data. 
 

In RPA's opinion, the net effect of the above is a potential reduction in cut-off grades over time.

RESERVE ESTIMATION 
The 2017 Mineral Reserve was estimated by the construction of mineable stope shapes using 

the modelled distribution of grade.  These were then queried against the respective resource 

model to determine tonnage and grade estimates by excavation.  Stope shapes include 

estimated planned dilution and exclude resource loss where the geometry and grade do not 

warrant inclusion.  The Mineral Reserve estimate also includes allowances for unplanned 

dilution.   

 

For the stope shapes constructed for the reserve estimate, grade shells were constructed at 

the reserve COG using Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource material.  Stope shapes 

were designed to be consistent with existing excavations.  

  

Panel by panel resolution was constructed for near-term (within a two-year period) stope 

shapes, and broader level by level stope shapes for longer-term (beyond two-year period).  

Development designs were generated concurrently for each stope shape.  The design 

engineer used his/her judgment to avoid incorporating low grade or isolated resource blocks.  

The stope shapes were expanded by one foot on all sides as an allowance for planned dilution 

of the Mineral Reserves.  The grade of this planned dilution was taken from the block model 

resulting in the addition of some gold.  

 

Stope shapes were validated against the resource model to generate grade/tonnage 

estimates.  These estimates were imported to a spreadsheet for tabulation for further validation 

and the application of unplanned dilution.  Subsequent design iterations or optimizations were 

undertaken as necessary to ensure that stope designs honour the requisite design criteria. 

 

Over the course of the Mineral Reserve estimation, the planning engineer reviews different 

stope shapes to obtain the highest value.  Small isolated zones were considered individually 

and must generate sufficient return to cover the costs of waste development to the zone. 

 

After the stope shapes were completed and reviewed, the details of the stope materials (tons, 

grades, classifications) were exported to MS Excel and tabulated.  Finally, a provision for 

unplanned dilution in the form of 4% additional tonnage at zero grade to account for backfill 

dilution was added to the totals to generate the Mineral Reserve estimate.

DILUTION 
Internal dilution was included in the mining shapes and is shown as material below the cut-off 

grade, unclassified or unknown.  The stope shapes were expanded by one foot on all sides as 

an allowance for planned dilution of the Mineral Reserves.  The grade of this material was 

taken from the block model resulting in the addition of tons and some gold.   

 

In addition to the planned dilution, 4% was added to the tonnage at zero grade representing 

backfill dilution. 

 

MINERAL RESERVE RECONCILIATION 
TRJV completes and maintains a monthly reconciliation of ore milled compared to the face 

sampling, the grade control sampling, and the Mineral Reserves.  For the reconciliation, TRJV 

has defined four categories for comparison: 

 
 Declared Ore Mined (DOM) tons are derived from weights of trucks shipped to 

Newmont.  Grades are derived from the average grade of the sonic drill samples.  As 
this information is not immediately available at month end, preliminary numbers are 
drawn from the tons and grade entered into the AcQuire system.  Numbers are then 
updated as final numbers become available (usually one to three months later). 
 

 Grade Control (GC) tons and grade are derived from evaluation of as-built survey 
triangulations against the most up-to-date block model.  Only volumes sent for ore 
are considered in this evaluation.  No dilution factor is applied. 
 

 Mineral Reserve (MR) tons and grade are derived from evaluation of as-built survey 
shapes adjusted within reserve blocks against the year-end block model, with dilution 
criteria applied in an arithmetic treatment to reflect expected results from any ore 
block.  Material mined outside of ore blocks is not considered as this is separately 
considered as Ore Gain. 
 

 Face Grade (FG) tons are estimated by Ore Control Geologists who measure the 
length, width, and height of each round blasted using a distomat laser measuring 
device.  Grades are derived from grab samples from each individual blast.  Grades 
are weighted by blast size. 

 

The reconciliation is completed on a monthly basis and reported in the geology department 

monthly report.  The results of the 2017 reconciliation are shown in Tables 15-4 to 15-6 and 

Figures 15-2 to 15-4.  The reconciliation of the DOM to the MR is poor.  The DOM tonnage 

exceeds the MR in every month, while the DOM grade is consistently less than the MR grade 

and the result is that the reconciliation for ounces is favourable. 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 15-7 

The reconciliation indicates that the Mineral Reserve model continues to understate the ore 

available for mining.  This is consistent with management's comments that the level of infill 

drilling has been low and that ore grade material is regularly encountered in areas where it is 

unexpected and in extensions to known ore reserve blocks.  The DOM exceeds the Mineral 

Reserve resulting in consistent gains.  RPA is of the opinion that the reconciliation between 

the DOM and the Mineral Reserve has improved since the previous audit when the DOM:OR 

comparison was 248%.  

 

An evaluation of the reconciliation based upon the resource block model but including Inferred 

Resources in the "ore" category would be useful to determine if the problem lies in the block 

model or if infill drilling may resolve the issue.  The amount of infill drilling undertaken will be 

an economic balance between the cost and time required for drilling and the need to have work 

places ready for production.  However, considering that mine development is generally halted 

when unexpected ore grade material is encountered, there is an argument that infill drilling 

may assist in meeting the planned mining schedule.

FIGURE 15-4   2017 OUNCE RECONCILIATION 
 

 
 

Reconciliation results show that estimation of gold ounces is a reasonable match for production 

once all information is available, as can be seen in the DOM:GC comparisons.  Mineral 

Reserve estimates lack data when estimating more than a year in advance of mining – 

significant quantities of Inferred Resources are drilled, re-estimated, and upgraded in 

classification before mining, rendering the Reserve estimates conservative.  This is a long-

standing pattern at TRJV, and not, in RPA's opinion, any cause for concern or change in 

estimation or operating practices. 

 

TRJV's practice of strategic planning based on cases including factored Inferred Resources 

therefore seems reasonable. 

 

RPA is of the opinion that the Mineral Reserves as stated by TRJV are estimated in accordance 

with CIM (2014) definition standards. 

 

RPA is not aware of any mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting, and other relevant 

factors that could materially affect the Mineral Reserve estimates.

16 MINING METHODS 
The TRJV consists of the Turquoise Ridge underground mine which produces refractory 

(carbonaceous/sulphide) gold ores that are processed off-site on a toll milling basis.  An 

isometric view of the underground workings is shown in Figure 16-1.  The mine is accessed 

via two shafts and a system of internal ramps, and utilizes underhand drift and fill mining 

methods with cemented rockfill.  Ground conditions at Turquoise Ridge are poor, and the RMR 

is typically less than 20, or very poor, in ore headings.  The mine is currently producing 2,300 

tons of ore per day.   

 

Key challenges in attainment of production levels and costs are the development of sufficient 

stoping areas and the transition from topcut development to undercut stoping.  Completion of 

the infrastructure development in the North Zone is necessary to achieve and optimize higher 

production levels.  Site preparation for a 3rd production shaft serving the North Zone is in 

progress, and shaft-sinking is scheduled to start in 2018. 

 

The adjacent Getchell mine has ceased operations and is not considered in this report.

UNDERGROUND MINING OPERATIONS 
The TRJV mine is a shaft access, mechanized mine, with an extensive system of ramps 

connecting the North and South zones to the shafts.  Mining started in the upper areas of the 

South Zone and is now moving to the more distant and lower North Zone.  New infrastructure 

for back fill and shotcrete has been installed near the North Zone. 

 

The majority of the ore zones have a RMR of 20 or less, indicating that the rock is weak and 

ground conditions are very poor. To deal with the poor ground conditions, the mining method 

is underhand drift and fill.  The key to the success of the method is the safe mining and 

backfilling of the topcut, which must take place in virgin ground without backfill protection.  

Experience has shown that the specific dimensions of the topcut are critical to the safe mining 

of additional drifts below this first backfilled zone.  The topcut headings at 15 ft high by 15 ft 

wide are driven with jumbos and mucked by LHDs.  The back and walls are supported with 

mesh and inflatable rock bolts.   

 

The topcuts are backfilled with a cemented rock fill which is placed by haul trucks and then 

jammed with a modified LHD to provide a tight backfill.  Undercuts are driven at 15 ft high by 

15 ft to 30 ft wide beneath the backfill with one- and two-boom jumbos.  The walls are 

supported with mesh and inflatable rock bolts from the back to about four feet from the floor.  

The cemented rock backfill requires no support.   

 

Work is underway to determine whether the heading width in the undercuts can be increased 

to 35 ft to improve productivity. 

 

Mining may be by successive undercuts parallel to and below the topcut or the undercuts may 

be driven at an angle to the topcut.  The latter method has the benefit of allowing the topcut 

backfill to provide more of a beam over the undercuts.  Undercuts are tight filled with cemented 

rock fill after mining. 

 

The mining sequence consists of multiple topcuts in an orebody at various elevations, followed 

by undercuts that will eventually come down to one of the original topcut accesses (Figure 16-

2).

MECHANICAL MINING 
TRJV has a started a pilot program to test mechanical mining via roadheader.  The roadheader 

has rotating cutter heads, which are programmed to excavate the desired shape of drift, 

replacing drill and blast as a method of advancing in soft ground (Figure 16-2).  More 

continuous operation (in comparison to the cycle of activities in conventional drift advance) 

and less impact on the rockmass are expected to provide operating efficiency advantages. 

 

At the time of RPA's site visit, the roadheader was commissioned and deployed in a test 

heading.  The rock conditions were harder than is ideal for mechanical mining, and the 

machine was down due to excessive wear causing a need for replacement parts. 

 

An area with more suitable ground conditions was being prepared for the roadheader, and 

results should be available in 2018.

GEOMECHANICS 
The ground conditions within the ore zone at the Turquoise Ridge deposit are poor, the ground 

is soft, and the RMR is low.  Due to the ground conditions, the underhand cut and fill method 

with tightly-placed fill using cemented rock fill is utilized. 

 

The RMR is 25 or less for the ore zones.  In extreme cases, the ground is so soft that the face 

can be mucked for advance.  There are areas within topcut levels where ground conditions 

are worse than average and topcuts can begin to squeeze in which case the practice is to stop 

development advance, backfill the cut with cemented fill, and then recommence development 

adjacent to the backfill.  At times, this process must be repeated several times before the 

advance across an ore zone is completed. 

 

The mine enforces the policy that all work is done under a supported back or under backfill.  

Backs and walls are screened and bolted and all primary development is shotcreted as well.  

Near the ore zones, the access development can encounter poor ground and structures that 

require additional support such as longer 12 ft to 20 ft inflatable bolts. 

 

The geotechnical risk for encountering major structures that could slow production is 

considered to be low, because areas are drilled and assessed by the geology department and 

geotechnical personnel before mining.  Smaller structures can cause local ground problems, 

requiring backup headings to maintain production levels.    

 

The risk for encountering significant water flow in drifts is considered to be low, and there is 

excess pumping capacity.  Water drainage from production areas is facilitated by probing 

ahead of the face.  Local inflows are pumped out from sump areas.  The mine is most 

vulnerable to introducing water to the system from above the ore body, mostly from overlying 

basalts. 

 

At Turquoise Ridge the mining will continue to be hampered by the poor ground conditions. 

Although the drilling and blasting is easy, it is necessary to support virgin backs and walls to 

the face and to maintain small headings in the topcuts.  Efficiency is further hampered when 

additional support is required (more shotcrete or longer bolts) and by the distance between the 

shaft services, backfill plant, shotcrete batch plant, and the developing faces. 

 

RPA considers the mining method and operations to be appropriate for the deposit.

MINE DESIGN 
Reserve shapes were designed based on the Measured, Indicated, and Inferred blocks within 

the grade shell, however, only those blocks within the reserve shapes that were largely 

Measured or Indicated were reported in the Mineral Reserve summary.  This practice allows 

for more realistic mining shapes and more efficient mining of the deposit.  

 

The long term planning engineer develops the mine plans for the LOM plan and Mineral 

Reserve estimation.  Grade shells are generated in Vulcan software based on the current 

OCOG.  Sections are cut at the mid-rib elevation.  The mine planning is based on 15 ft heights 

 

Using the sections, mining shapes are drawn based on the Measured, Indicated, and Inferred 

(MI & I) Resources.  There is a strict naming convention to maintain order in the LOM plan.  

Manual calculations are used to evaluate small, isolated areas of material that exceed the 

OCOG to ensure that these isolated areas can be economically extracted. 

 

For complex shapes, the planning engineer will examine the impact of different shapes.  

Internal waste is included in the reserve estimate. After mining is complete, an outline of the 

stoped area is drawn and resources, which are now mined out, are removed from the block 

model.   

 

The LOM shapes (MI & I) and main developments are then sent to the geology department for 

visual validation.   

 

The perimeter of each reserve shape is then expanded by one foot to account for overbreak, 

or planned dilution.  Internal waste is added into the total and the reserves are then tallied in a 

spreadsheet.  Finally, 4% at zero grade is added for backfill dilution. 

 

Polygons are triangulated to generate tons and grades which are then exported to 

spreadsheets.  Unclassified material has a grade in the model, but for Mineral Reserve 

reporting, the grade is taken as zero.  Unknown material has no grade. 

 

Extraction of Mineral Reserves is estimated at 100%, as the Mineral Reserves are based on a 

designed shape that is to be extracted.

Stopes were designed based on MI & I material.  Stopes included in the LOM plan meet 

economic requirements and extraction sequencing has been established.  Development 

requirements are also based on detailed design.  Only material inside engineering designs is 

included into the LOM. 

 

RPA considers the mine design procedures to be appropriate for the deposit. 

 

MINE SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 

BACKFILL 
Backfill is essential to the success of the mining at Turquoise Ridge.  Aggregate is mined on 

surface and crushed before being delivered to a borehole, near the main shaft, to the batch 

plant on the 1250 level.  From the batch plant, fill is trucked approximately 200 ft to the borehole 

to 1715 level.  From the 1715 level the fill is hauled to locations in the mine.  This fill system is 

distant from the workings in the North Zone. 

 

A new backfill plant is located in the North Zone and its commissioning has reduced the backfill 

transport time. 

 

In the open pit, which is being mined for backfill, the material is now limestone (previously 

basalt), which has reduced the binder requirements and the fill is less abrasive.    

 

MINE VENTILATION 
Mine ventilation improvements are being implemented with a planned ventilation drift which 

will bring improved airflow to the lower extents of the mine and also reduce dust (generated by 

the roadheader) in the primary airflow.  With the completion of the 3rd Shaft, ventilation will 

improve and allow the addition of another surface fan to increase the primary ventilation flows. 

 

Ventilation planning includes modelling of the heat in the mine. 

 

DEWATERING AND WATER TREATMENT 
Dewatering and water treatment are discussed in Section 18.

The LOM plan includes a detailed monthly plan for the first two years with detailed mine 

designs in place for that period.  The remainder of the mine life is based on the plans used in 

the development of the Mineral Reserve estimate.   

 

RPA notes that the apparent production gap in 2018 is planned to be filled in by infill drilling of 

within the production areas (some of which has already been completed after the database 



www.rpacan.com

was closed for year-end estimation).  TRJV has a long history of success in short-term 

resource conversion and realizing gains from infill drilling (between YE reserve estimation and 

completing mining in an area). 

 

Recent changes to the Toll Milling Agreement provide opportunities for higher production rates: 

• 850,000 tons per year in 2018 and 2019 

• 1.2 million tons per year in 2020 to 2024 

• Flexibility to process ore elsewhere 

 

These opportunities have not yet been part of reserve-level mine planning. 

 

MINE EQUIPMENT 
There is a large fleet of rubber tired mobile equipment for personnel and materials movement, 

utility work, muck loading and hauling, drilling and ground support.  The wide spread nature of 

the mine demands a large fleet of equipment, so that work can continue in any given area 

without waiting for equipment to arrive. 

 

Given the poor ground conditions, a key factor in the mine development is the shortening of 

the stand-up time between opening ground and the installation of ground support.  This means 

that a crew must have access to the equipment to do the work as soon as the face is free of 

muck.  As a result, many units are seen sitting apparently idle but ready for the crew when 

needed. 

 

A summary of the key underground units is included in Table 16-2.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 
The Sage mill capacity is 11,500 tons per day to 12,000 tons per day.  The target grind size 

was reduced to 35 μm in 2010 and additional Geho pumps were added to the circuit in 2010 

to increase the plant feed rate that had previously been limited by the pump capacity. 

 

The mill includes semi-autogenous grinding (SAG) mill followed by a ball mill.  The cyclone 

overflow reports to a thickener.  Thickener underflow reports to an acidification circuit where 

sulphuric acid is added as necessary to ensure adequate autoclave free acid solution levels.  

The free acid concentration for TRJV ore needs to be maintained greater than 30 g/L.  

Thickener overflow solution is returned to the milling circuit.  After acidification, ore slurry is 

added to two identical autoclaves that are operated in parallel.  Two stages of flash heat 

recovery are utilized.  Autoclave discharge is cooled before reporting to the lime neutralization 

circuit.  Autoclave waste gas is cooled and scrubbed before discharging to the atmosphere. 

 

Oxide ore and acidic oxidized sulphide ore slurry are combined in the neutralization circuit.  

After neutralization with the carbonate oxide ore and supplemental lime, the ore slurry reports 

to a carbon-in-leach (CIL) circuit where the ore is leached in cyanide solution to extract the 

gold.  Final tailings slurry is pumped to the tailings containment area.  Tailings settle and decant 

solution is reclaimed and reused in the grinding circuit. 

 

Loaded carbon from the CIL circuit is transferred to the recovery plant.  After acid washing to 

remove inorganic contaminants, the carbon is transferred to the pressure Zadra stripping 

circuit.  Gold is stripped from the carbon using caustic and cyanide solution at elevated 

temperature and pressure.  Pregnant solution from the stripping circuit is pumped to an 

electrowinning circuit where precious metal is removed from the solution as sludge.  The 

sludge is filtered, dried in a mercury retort, mixed with fluxes, and refined into doré bars.  

 

After carbon stripping, the barren carbon reports to the kiln regeneration circuit and returns to 

the CIL circuit.  An overall process flow sheet is shown in Figure 17-1.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 18-3 

MINE ACCESS 
TRJV currently operates two shafts which were driven approximately 900 ft apart into the 

original primary ore sources.  Shaft #1 has a diameter of 20 ft and is used for both exhaust 

ventilation and as a secondary egress.  This shaft reaches to the 1550 level of the mine (1,783 

ft below surface).   

 

Shaft #2 has a diameter of 24 ft and is used as the ventilation intake and primary access to 

the mine.  The shaft extends to 1,818 ft below surface and is the sole means of bringing 

equipment into or out of the mine (nominal hoist capacity of 20,000 lb), and for skipping ore 

and waste (nominal capacity of 3,500 tons per day with 10 ton skips).  Skips can be loaded at 

a mid-shaft pocket or at the bottom loading pocket.  There is an 80 man capacity cage with a 

removable deck.  Both the service and skipping hoists are double drum hoists. 

 

There is an extensive system of ramps within the mine, with long access ramps from the shafts 

to the deposits, which were discovered after shaft sinking and which are well away from the 

shaft location.  All of the mining and development is done with mechanized rubber-tired 

equipment. 

 

MATERIAL HANDLING 
Materials and personnel are transported into and out of the mine via the main cage.  There is 

a large fleet of mobile equipment for the movement of men and materials throughout the mine.  

Crushed rock and cement for backfill are delivered to an underground batch plant by 

boreholes.  Pre-mixed shotcrete is delivered by borehole to the underground shotcrete plant.   

 

Ore and waste may be re-handled a number of times between the face and surface, as the 

material is mucked from the face to a re-muck bay where it is held for a period of time while 

awaiting assays and a determination as to whether the material is ore or waste.  From the re-

muck the rock is hauled by truck to the material handling drift (MHD) where it is re-handled by 

LHD to the skip loading dump.  The MHD consists of four short drifts where ore and waste are 

dumped by truck before being re-handled by loader.  The loader further dumps them to the 

feeder breaker and on the skip loading. 

 

The MHD is necessary as the ore is so soft that it will pack and plug if stored in a vertical pass.  

There is no storage except for the loading pocket feeder belt between the MHD and the shaft.

 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 18-4 

Skipping is done with a skip tender at the pocket as there can be problems with material 

sticking in the skip.     

 

Waste rock which is to be hoisted to surface may be mucked to a short waste pass for loading 

into the skip or it will be hauled to an MHD for subsequent movement to the shaft. 

 

BACKFILL 
Cemented rock fill is used for stoping and is prepared in two underground batch plants, located 

near the shaft on the 1250 level, and near the North Zone.  Rock is quarried on surface and 

crushed before being delivered by borehole to the batch plant.  Cement powder and fly ash 

are delivered from surface silos to the batch plant by borehole.  At the batch plant, an operator 

oversees the preparation of backfill, which is done in approximately eleven ton batches that 

are loaded into a truck.  From the batch plant the backfill is hauled to a nearby raise and is 

delivered to the lower levels of the mine where it is loaded into trucks or LHDs for delivery to 

the stope.  In the stope, the backfill is rammed tight to the back and walls. 

 

Backfill delivery holes have suffered failures and the original 24 in. diameter lined borehole 

required liner replacements until the hole diameter was only seven inches.  At this size, a 

replaceable liner was devised and the liner is replaced rather than simply having a smaller 

liner installed.  The smaller borehole had led to a reduction in the size of backfill from minus 

three inches to minus two inches.  There were also delays incurred in the delivery of backfill 

and in some areas cemented waste fill was being used in order to get fill into headings in a 

timely fashion. 

 

Six inch diameter concrete test cylinders are filled at the batch plant, so that the backfill can 

be tested to determine the unconfined compressive strength (UCS).  Backfill at Turquoise 

Ridge typically has a UCS of 8.3 MPa. 

 

In the mine, the cemented backfill provides a good back under which men can work without 

supporting the cemented fill.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 18-5 

VENTILATION 
Fresh air is delivered through the main shaft which is downcast, and after being passed 

through the mine with a series of ramps and raises, the air is exhausted up the ventilation 

raise. 

 

At the time of the site visit, mine ventilation was generally good though some of the ramps 

were dusty, however, watering of the ramps is ill advised due to the mud that develops very 

quickly in the soft material. 

 

MINE DEWATERING AND WATER TREATMENT 
Mine water is diverted to sumps and then to main pumping stations for settling and pumping 

to surface.  The mine has developed such that the main dewatering sump is in the lower part 

of mine but not at the bottom any more.  At the main pump station, there is a clarifier, three 

clear water pumps, and a piston pump for pumping slimes.  All material is pumped to surface 

in a single stage via the #2 shaft.  

 

The clear water pumping capacity is 3,500 gpm, but the pumps operate at a rate of 

approximately 700 gpm.  Slimes are pumped on a daily basis.  Water is recycled for reuse in 

the mine and excess water is treated in the water treatment plant before discharge to infiltration 

ponds. 

 

Water is treated for arsenic and manganese removal with a ferric sulphate precipitation circuit 

followed by clarification and discharge.  The arsenic limit was recently reduced from 50 ppm 

to 10 ppm, and a new water treatment plant was commissioned in 2017 in order to comply with 

the lower limit.     

 

When water is non-compliant, it is diverted to the Turquoise Ridge tailings impoundment and 

eliminated by evaporation in the summer months.  The tailings impoundment was used when 

the Getchell mill was operational, however, the mill has now been dismantled. 

 

Slimes are recovered, dried, and added to the mill feed stockpiles.

MAINTENANCE AND COMMUNICATIONS 
Mobile equipment maintenance shops and service bays are located within the mine, and 

service trucks and tractors are used to access remote areas or provide repair and maintenance 

services away from the shops. 

 

There are both radio and telephone communications in the mine.  The radio system is a mine 

wide system and telephones are available at central locations. 

 

POWER SUPPLY 
Electrical power is currently purchased from Sierra Pacific Power Company.  The power 

available is more than enough to meet planned operational schedules and any reasonable 

expansion.  Planning is in place to begin taking power from outside of the Sierra Pacific Power 

Company system under open access provisions.  Power will be purchased on the open market 

or from the Western 102 plant, whichever is cheaper.  Power requirements average 8.5 MW. 

 

3RD SHAFT PROJECT 
The 3rd Shaft Project consists of sinking and equipping a 24 ft diameter, concrete-lined shaft 

to 3,250 ft total depth.  Shaft sinking will include two skipping levels, a water pressure break 

level, and a shaft bottom pump level.  Shaft equipping will include a headframe and collar 

house; hoists and hoistroom; shaft steel; surface and underground material handling; and a 

shaft bottom pumping system. 

 

The new shaft will serve as a second production shaft, and provide the following advantages: 

• Improved ventilation 

• Shorter hauls underground 

• Provide a secondary escapeway for the north end of the mine 

• Sustain productivity as working areas move away from #2 Shaft 

 

Figure 18-2 summarizes the project schedule.  Site preparation started in 2017, and shaft-

sinking will begin in 2018.  Production is expected in 2022.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
MARKETS 
Gold is the principal commodity extracted at the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture and is freely 

traded, at prices that are widely known, so that prospects for sale of any production are virtually 

assured.  Prices are usually quoted in US dollars per troy ounce. 

 

CONTRACTS 
The mine is a joint venture and operates under a Joint Venture Agreement between Barrick 

Turquoise Ridge Inc. (BTRI) and Newmont GTR LLC (Newmont LLC) operating at the 

Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture (TRJV).  The ore mined at Turquoise Ridge is processed at the 

Twin Creeks Mine that is owned and operated by Newmont USA Limited (Newmont) under 

Toll Milling Agreements (TMA) between BTRI and Newmont and Newmont LLC and Newmont.  

The two TMAs are separate but the terms are similar.  In addition to the TMAs, there is an 

Administration of Toll Milling Agreement between BTRI and Newmont LLC.  The previous 

agreements expired on December 31, 2017, and new agreements that commenced on 

January 1, 2018 were negotiated and executed. 

 

The Administration of Toll Milling Agreement appoints BTRI as Newmont LLC's agent to 

administer certain provisions of Newmont LLC's TMA and to delegate to BTRI certain rights 

and powers under the agreement including: 

 
 Negotiate all milling of Excess Conforming Ore, Non-Conforming Ore, and other ore 

that BTRI have a right to have milled. 
 

 Dispute Newmont's determination of the Milling Fee. 
 

 Determine whether a dispute exists and, if so, to institute, conduct, resolve, and settle 
the dispute. 
 

 Determine whether to suspend deliveries of ore and/or to terminate the Newmont LLC 
TMA. 
 

 Enforce all indemnity obligations of Newmont LLC TMA. 
 

 Conduct inspections and audits authorized by the TMA. 
 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 19-2 

 Give all notices to Newmont required or permitted by the Newmont LLC TMA. 
 

 Make any waiver to or amendment to the Newmont LLC TMA that is consistent with 
the BTRI TMA. 
 

 Take all other actions that are reasonable and necessary, appropriate or incidental to 
any of the foregoing to provide for consistent and unified administration of the Newmont 
LLC TMA and the BTRI TMA. 

 

In 2017, Newmont rejected some Non-Conforming ore due to high organic carbon content, so 

significant changes were implemented with the new TMAs.  Key changes include: 

 
 Term runs to December 31, 2024. 

 
 Ability to process up to 850,000 tons per year in 2018 and 2019. 

 
 Ability to process up to 1.2 million tons per year in 2020 to 2024. 

 
 New process cost terms, some of which are indexed to the price of gold, and accounting 

for organic carbon content. 
 

 Some opportunity to consider alternate processing options. 
 
Since BTRI is responsible for shipping ore from Turquoise Ridge to the Sage Mill in the new 

TMA and it is not feasible for them to commence ore transport as of January 1, 2018, an Interim 

Ore Transport Agreement was made between Newmont and TRJV.   

 

The 2018 TMA includes a provision for an Optimization Committee which includes technical 

experts with equal representation from both companies.  The purpose of the committee is to 

study preg-robbing effects of carbon in the ore and other technical and blending issues related 

to ore from Turquoise Ridge.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, 
AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 
TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITY 
No tailings are generated at Turquoise Ridge, however, the historic tailings facility is 

maintained for storage and disposal of non-compliant treated mine water. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 
Over the years, many environmental studies have been completed, as required, which were 

sufficient for the granting of various permits required for operations. 

 

PROJECT PERMITTING 
The TRJV maintains a number of permits for the operation.  A list of the key permits and the 

status of the permits is shown in Table 20-1.  TRJV tracks permits carefully for ongoing 

compliance.  In RPA's opinion, TRJV is meeting Barrick's high standards for environmental 

awareness and compliance.  Environmental staff carries out sampling, monitoring, and record 

keeping and are involved in permit applications and renewals as required.

SURFACE DISTURBANCE 
Total permitted surface disturbance for the TRJV is approximately 1,957.5 acres, or 3.1 square 

miles.  In previous years, TRJV reclaimed areas that had the potential to be removed from 

active mining plans, and will continue to do so as necessary, without requesting release of 

bonds for these areas.  

 

SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY REQUIREMENTS 
There are no major challenges with respect to government relations, non-Governmental 

Organizations (NGOs), social or legal issues, and community development.  TRJV has a 

community and social relations policy that is consistent with Barrick core values and 

governance.   

 

TRJV currently has a representative group of employees that serves as a Community 

Relations Team reporting to the Human Resources Superintendent.  The operation is an active 

member of and supports the Mining Industry Foundation for Lowry High School.  It also 

supports the Humboldt Development Authority and provides financial and in-kind support to 

the community.  Barrick supplies water to area ranchers for their cattle.  Contacts are sustained 

with the City of Winnemucca and Humboldt County officials. 

 

MINE CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS  
There are both ongoing and active reclamation and closure activities as well as historic or 

legacy activities. 

 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Barrick Gold Corporation – Turquoise Ridge JV, Project #2893 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 20-4 

Ongoing and active reclamation include the Turquoise Ridge and Getchell mine facilities; water 

treatment plant and infiltration system; potable water system; wastewater treatment system; 

tailings impoundment; and access and haul roads.  These components will be reclaimed and 

closed at the end of the mine life. 

 

Reclamation of the historic Getchell processing facilities and legacy areas has essentially been 

completed. 

 

Closure plans for this long-life operation are updated regularly. 

 
CLOSURE COSTS 
The Barrick Reclamation Cost Estimator is used to calculate closure costs.  The Q4 2017 

estimate was $36.3 million.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
The TRJV is an operating underground gold mine.  There is major capital project involving a 

new production shaft and sustaining capital requirements, however, there are no preproduction 

requirements.   

 

CAPITAL COSTS 
Current LOM capital costs for the operation are estimated to be $723 million, as summarized 

in Table 21-1.  Large capital items for 2018 include completion of site preparation for the 3rd 

Shaft, and beginning of shaft sinking.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 21-2 

RPA notes that the operating costs projected for the LOM are based on 2017 actual costs, with 

an allowance for higher processing cost to account for the new Toll Milling Agreement (TMA).  

The impacts of variable processing terms, higher production rates, installation of the 3rd Shaft, 

and use of roadheaders for mining softer ores are not estimated.   

 
• TMA: the new agreement includes some terms indexed to gold prices, and a variable 

component based on organic carbon content.   
 

• Higher Production Rates: the new TMA allows for an increase to 850,000 tons per year 
in 2018 and 2019, and 1.2 million tons per year in 2020 to 2024.  There is also the 
possibility of processing ore at Goldstrike. 

 
o Higher rates allow fixed costs (a portion of mining costs, and all G&A costs) to 

be spread over more tons, at lower unit rates. 
 

• 3rd Shaft: the impact of the new shaft on operating costs has yet to be determined. 
 

• Mechanical Mining: the cost impact of mining by roadheader has yet to be determined.  
Continuous operation in 2018 should provide useful data. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the net effect of the above is a potential reduction in unit operating costs 

over time.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 25-1 

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The mine has been in production for over 10 years and is a mature operation.  In RPA's 

opinion, there are not any significant risks and uncertainties that could reasonably be expected 

to affect the reliability or confidence in the exploration information, Mineral Resource or Mineral 

Reserve estimates, or projected economic outcomes. 

 

Based on the site visit and subsequent review, RPA offers the following conclusions: 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES  

• The Turquoise Ridge deposit is a typical Carlin-type deposit and is characterized by 
structurally and stratigraphically controlled, sediment-hosted, replacement deposits 
containing micron-sized gold.   
 

• The drilling, sampling, and quality assurance/quality control is appropriate for the style 
of mineralization.  
 

• The Mineral Resource estimate was completed by TRJV and was reviewed and 
accepted by RPA.   
 

• RPA is of the opinion that the Mineral Resource estimate has been completed to 
industry standard and is suitable to support the disclosure of Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves. 
 

• RPA is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
economic, marketing, political, or other relevant factors which could materially affect 
the Mineral Resource estimate. 
 

• Measured and Indicated Resources, effective December 31, 2017, total 7.5 million tons 
grading 0.268 oz/ton Au, containing 2.0 million ounces of gold, exclusive of Mineral 
Reserves. 
 

• Inferred Resources, effective December 31, 2017, total 2.5 million tons grading 0.380 
oz/ton Au, containing 0.9 million ounces of gold. 
 

• Exploration potential remains considerable, and TRJV is pursuing an aggressive 
program on six targets. 

 
MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 

• The Mineral Reserve estimate was completed by TRJV and was reviewed and 
accepted by RPA.   
 

• RPA is of the opinion that the Mineral Reserve estimate has been completed to industry 
standard and is suitable for disclosure.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – March 19, 2018 Page 25-2 

• Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, effective December 31, 2017, total 17.3 million 
tons grading 0.453 oz/ton Au, containing 7.8 million ounces of gold. 

 
• 2017 reconciliation results show that estimation of gold ounces is a reasonable match 

for subsequent production once all information is available, i.e., relative to the short-
term grade control model.  Mineral Reserve estimates lack data when estimating more 
than a year in advance of mining – significant quantities of Inferred Resources are 
drilled, re-estimated, and upgrade in classification before mining, rendering the 
Reserve estimates conservative.  This is a long-standing pattern at TRJV, and not, in 
RPA's opinion, any cause for concern or change in estimation or operating practices. 
 

• TRJV has a started a pilot program to test mechanical mining via roadheader in softer 
ground.  More continuous operation (in comparison to the cycle of activities in 
conventional drift advance) and less impact on the rockmass are expected to provide 
operating efficiency advantages. 
 

• There is upside potential in higher mining rates, made possible by a new production 
shaft (sinking beginning in 2018), and a new toll milling agreement.  This is not currently 
reflected in operating cost estimates, cut-off grades, or the reserve estimate. 

 
PROCESSING 

• The current sampling protocol for shipped ore is a laborious process but works well.   
 

• The metallurgical accounting is complex but reasonable and consistent with typical 
industry standards. 
 

• The gold recovery equation is based upon a relationship with the ratio between the 
gold feed grade and COC concentration, adjusted monthly based on process results at 
the Twin Creeks Plant.  RPA's analysis, however, indicates that there is little 
correlation, and therefore the estimation methodology is not accurate.   
 

• There is a concern that the quantity of gold that TRJV is being paid for may be 
inaccurate, as plant recoveries attributed to TRJV feed (10% of the total feed) are 
influenced to a much greater extent by Twin Creeks feed (90% of the total feed).

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
RPA has the following recommendations by area: 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES  

• Continue infill drilling and exploration. 
 
MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 

• Review roadheader performance in 2018 and determine where gains can be made by 
changing from conventional drilling and blasting to mechanical mining.   
 

• Now that production is less limited by milling constraints, review potential for higher 
mine production.   

 
PROCESSING 

• RPA recommends that evaluation of gold recovery estimates should continue to be 
assessed in order to improve the accuracy of the estimates.
