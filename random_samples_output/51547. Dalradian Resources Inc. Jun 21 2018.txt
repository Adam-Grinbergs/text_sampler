Executive Summary 
 
Introduction 
 
The Curraghinalt project is a pre-development gold exploration project located in Northern Ireland, United 
Kingdom. It is located approximately 115 kilometres west of Belfast, the capital of Northern Ireland. Dalradian 
Resource Inc. (Dalradian) wholly owns 100 percent of the property. 
 
This technical report documents the Mineral Resource Statement prepared by Dalradian and SRK for the 
Curraghinalt gold project. This technical report was prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian 
Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1.  
 
In December 2016, Dalradian disclosed the results of a feasibility study detailing additional exploration, 
hydrogeology, rock and soil geotechnical work, metallurgical and geochemical characterization of the gold 
mineralization and the waste rock, and mine engineering studies to design a new underground mine and mill 
complex targeting the mineral resources disclosed on May 5, 2016. The economic viability was evaluated at a 
feasibility level and documented in a publically disclosed technical report (JDS, 2017). The 2016 mineral 
resource evaluation is now obsolete and is replaced by the mineral resource evaluation reported herein. 
 
The updated mineral resource statement reported herein, along with a revised geotechnical study and ore 
sorting testwork, will support an ongoing updated feasibility study initiated by Dalradian. In this context, the 
results of the feasibility study reported on December 12, 2016 are no longer valid or current. This technical 
report supports a revised mineral resource model only, with the sections reported in the JDS (2017) technical 
report that support the feasibility study now obsolete and no longer required (Sections 14 to 21). 
 
 
Property Description and Ownership 
 
The Curraghinalt project is situated in Counties Tyrone and Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The Curraghinalt 
gold deposit, located near the centre of the property is approximately 115 kilometres west of Belfast by road. 
The property measures approximately 120,000 hectares comprising six contiguous areas (DG1, DG2, DG3, 
DG4, DG5, and DG6), to which Dalradian has mining lease option agreements for gold and silver. Dalradian 
also has prospecting licences that exclude gold and silver for four areas (DG1, DG2, DG5, and DG6) with the 
other two areas (DG3 and DG4) under application. 
 
Dalradian holds, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Dalradian Gold Ltd. (Dalradian Gold), a 100 percent 
interest, subject to four percent royalty payable to the Crown Estate Commissioners upon production of silver 
and/or gold. The Department for the Economy has granted to Dalradian Gold Prospecting Licences for all 
metals over four areas with two others under application. 
 
Access to the property is via a number of highways and local roads from Omagh to Gortin and Greencastle. 
Local country roads, private roads, and farm tracks provide generally good access within the property. The 
topography consists of rolling hills and broad valleys. Much of the property occurs within the Sperrin 
Mountains, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. 
 
Dalradian commenced the environmental and social impact assessment at the end of 2014 to examine the 
potential impacts of a full mine build, as well as options for the elimination or mitigation of such impacts. The 
report, together with a project description, has formed the basis of a planning application for the full mine build 
which was submitted to the Department for Infrastructure in November 2017. During 2018, activities in 
permitting are expected to include preparation of responses to queries on the planning application and 
submission of supporting applications.

History 
 
Gold was recognized in the gravels of the Moyola River to the east of the property in 1652, and in the 1930s, 
an English company reported plans for alluvial gold mining in a prospectus. Documented exploration in the 
area dates back to the early 1970s. 
 
The property containing the Curraghinalt deposit was initially acquired by Ulster Base Metals (which later 
became Ulster Minerals) in 1981, an entity which later became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ennex 
International plc (Ennex). Ennex conducted exploration on the property between 1982 and 1999, and then sold 
its interest in Ulster Minerals to Nickelodeon in January 2000. In February 2003, Tournigan Gold Corp 
(Tournigan) entered into an option agreement with Strongbow to earn an interest of up to 100 percent in the 
Curraghinalt deposit. In October 2009, Dalradian completed a purchase and sale agreement with Tournigan to 
acquire the licences, mineral rights, and surface rights (including easements). 
 
Historical exploration on the licences has included many phases of surface drilling, trenching, soil and stream 
sampling, prospecting, panning, ground and airborne geophysics, underground development, underground 
drilling, and underground channel sampling. 
 
Geological Setting and Mineralization 
 
The bedrock geology of Northern Ireland is a complex assemblage of Mesoproterozoic to Paleogene rock 
units. It can be sub-divided into four quadrants:  
 

• Northwest - composed predominantly of the Proterozoic Dalradian Supergroup and the early 
Ordovician Tyrone Igneous Complex 

• Southeast - composed mainly of rocks of the Southern Uplands/Longford-Down Terrane, an 
allochthonous prism composed of an Ordovician and Silurian turbidite sequence 

• Southwest - underlain mainly by Upper Palaeozoic sedimentary rock deposited in continental to 
marine environments 

• Northeast - underlain by the early Palaeogene (60 – 55 Ma), subaerial Antrim Lava Group and minor 
underlying Paleozoic units 

 
The local geology of the project area comprises three main rock groups: 
 

• Dalradian metasediments in the Grampian terrane to the north of the Omagh Thrust 
• The Tyrone Igneous Complex in the Midland Valley terrane south of the Omagh Thrust 
• Upper Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Palaeogene sedimentary rocks which are widely distributed 

throughout these terranes, particulary within the DG6 Licence. 
 
The Mullaghcarn Formation is host to the Curraghinalt gold deposits and the Alwories prospect, and consists 
predominantly of semi-pelites and psammites with subordinate pelite horizons and chloritic semi-pelites. These 
are bounded to the south by the Omagh Thrust Fault, a moderately northwest dipping thrust fault active as late 
as the Carboniferous.  
 
The Curraghinalt gold deposit is a high grade orogenic gold deposit characterized by a series of west-northwest 
trending, moderately to steeply dipping, stacked quartz-carbonate-sulphide veins and arrays of narrow and 
short extension veinlets. The mineral resource model discussed herein focusses on 21 gold-bearing quartz 
veins. Subordinate auriferous quartz veins exist between the main modelled veins, but their continuity is 
difficult to demonstrate at the current drilling spacing. The quartz-carbonate-sulphide vein system was 
investigated by core drilling, underground mapping, and face and channel sampling where partly exposed in 
underground workings. The veins range from a few centimetres to five metres wide. The veins have been 
traced from surface to a depth of approximately 1,200 metres. They remain open along strike and at depth. On 
average, the quartz veins dip between 50 degrees and 75 degrees to the north.

Exploration and Drilling 
 
The exploration database for the Curraghinalt gold deposit includes 731 core boreholes (178,130 metres). 
Since 2010, Dalradian has drilled 459 core boreholes (146,910 metres) on the Curraghinalt gold deposit, and 
47 core boreholes (12,987 metres) on other regional targets. In addition, airborne and ground geophysical 
surveys, prospecting, mapping, and geochemical surveys have been completed. Most of the drilling on the 
property was at the Curraghinalt deposit, including a number of underground core boreholes.  
 
SRK reviewed the core logging and sampling procedures used by Dalradian and, as far as known, by previous 
operators. In the opinion of SRK, the core logging and sampling procedures used by Dalradian are consistent 
with generally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, adequate for an advanced exploration 
project. Drilling, core logging and sampling procedures followed by previous operators are, in part, difficult to 
assess; however, after analysis of exploration data, SRK considers that historical data are sufficiently reliable 
to inform geology and mineral resource models. 
 
Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security  
 
Exploration samples collected by Dalradian, Tournigan, and Ennex since 1984 were submitted to ALS 
Laboratories Ltd. (ALS) in Loughrea, Ireland. Nickelodeon submitted samples to Chemex Labs Limited 
(Chemex) in Vancouver for sample preparation and analyses. Both facilities are independent, commercial 
geochemical laboratories that operated independently from the companies. 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the sampling preparation, security, and analytical procedures used by Dalradian are 
consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, adequate for an advanced 
exploration project. Sample handling and preparation procedures followed by previous operators are, in part, 
difficult to assess. However, after analysis of exploration data, SRK considers that historical data are 
sufficiently reliable to inform geology and mineral resource models, especially considering that drilling and 
underground sample data collected by Ennex, Nickelodeon, and Tournigan amount to approximately five 
percent of all available exploration data available for the Curraghinalt project. 
 
Data Verification 
 
SRK carried out extensive reviews of exploration data collected by Ennex, Tournigan, and Dalradian between 
1987 and 2018. SRK identified the following issues: lack of analytical quality control data prior to 2000, high 
failure rate of blank samples during discrete periods, and high failure rate of certain control samples used. 
However, the sampling data collected by Dalradian (71,878 core samples) far outweigh historical sampling 
data collected by Ennex (1,551 core samples) and Tournigan (2,289 core samples), significantly reducing the 
risk introduced by the use of historical data that may be less reliable. Overall, SRK considers that the 
exploration data targeting the Curraghinalt gold deposit are globally sufficiently reliable to inform geology and 
mineral resource models. The data examined by SRK do not present obvious evidence of analytical bias. 
 
Metallurgical Testing 
 
The metallurgical test work was summarized by Canenco Consulting Corp. (Canenco). Previous testing was 
undertaken on composite samples blended from various veins and from different areas of the deposit. More 
recent test work was carried out on flowsheet optimization composites, constructed to represent the grade, 
lithology, and spatial aspects of the mineral resources, evaluating both gold and silver recoveries. Test work 
programs were completed by independent reputable metallurgical laboratories using primarily core samples 
from exploration drilling, including bulk processing campaigns. These programs included characterization and 
mineralogical studies, comminution studies, gravity concentration tests, flotation, leach and settling tests. 
Historical test work results indicate that the mineralization responded well to flotation and to direct cyanide 
leaching for precious metal extraction.

Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
The new mineral resource model is based on a revised geological model that considers information from 731 
core boreholes (178,130 metres) and 678 underground channels/faces (2,397 metres). An additional 145 core 
boreholes for 46,487 metres and 181 underground channels/faces for 535 metres were drilled or sampled since 
the 2016 mineral resource model. The mineral resources were evaluated using a geostatistical block modelling 
approach by SRK constrained by 21 resource domains.  
 
The gold mineralization at the Curraghinalt gold project is hosted in narrow, sub-parallel auriferous quartz-
carbonate-sulphide veins. Twenty-one vein wireframe domains were constructed by SRK with the assistance of 
Dalradian. The vein wireframes were modelled on the extents of logged gold mineralized shear veins 
(D veins), and snapped to assays irrespective of gold grades. The veins are cut by a network of late brittle 
faults. The vein wireframes were offset by four main observed faults (Kiln, 105, 106, and 302). The vein offset 
across each fault varies between 1 to 10 metres. Other faults were also modelled but do not offset the vein 
wireframes in the model, due to either not showing any apparent offset or their lower confidence in location 
and offset. 
 
Capping was performed by individual domain and considered core and channel composites separately. 
Capping for the core composites ranges from 20 to 120 g/t gold whereas in the channel composites the capping 
ranges from 30 to 125 g/t gold. 
 
The spatial distribution of the gold mineralization was analysed using variograms and correlograms of the 
composite data on a by-domain basis. In sparsely sampled domains, SRK grouped adjacent domains to 
determine a regional variogram model applicable to the grouped domains.  
 
A block model was generated with a block size of 5 m by 5 m by 5 m with subcells at at 0.50- by 0.25- by 
0.50-metre resolution in the X, Y and Z axes, respectively, which was used to honour the geometry of the 
modelled mineralization. The block model was populated with a gold grade using ordinary kriging. Four 
estimation runs were used, each considering increasing search neighbourhoods and less restrictive search 
criteria. Only the first run allowed the use of underground channel samples. The last pass considers a 
secondary capping threshold to further control the influence of high grade composites in sparsely drilled areas. 
 
The block model was classified using a combination of tools, including confidence in the geological 
interpretation, search radii, minimum number of boreholes and composites, variography, and estimation pass. 
A Measured category was assigned to blocks within a 10 by 10 by 10 metres search radii around the 
underground workings if informed by a minimum of two boreholes. An Indicated classification was assigned 
to blocks estimated in the first pass, using a minimum of two boreholes. The mean average distance of 
informing composites for Indicated blocks is 50 metres; while on average, these blocks are informed by six 
boreholes. All other blocks not classified as Measured or Indicated, whose grade was estimated in a vein 
domain with composites located up to 150 metres away from a borehole, were classified as Inferred. Overall, 
the mean average distance of composites in this category is less than 100 metres. All other blocks estimated 
were unclassified. 
 
SRK examined the classification visually by inspecting sections and plans throughout the block model. SRK 
concludes that the parameters used to define Measured blocks reasonably reflect estimates that can be 
considered to be at a high confidence level, material classified as Indicated reflect estimates made with a 
moderate level of confidence within the meaning of CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves (May 2014), and all other material is estimated at a lower confidence level. Additionally, 
SRK applied a post-smoothing filter on the classified material to ensure continuity within the classification 
categories. In particular, the boundary between Indicated and Inferred is intentionally drawn as parallel or 
perpendicular to potential underground levels, to facilitate underground mine planning. 
 
SRK considers that the gold mineralization is amenable to underground extraction. Through discussions with 
Dalradian, SRK considers that it is reasonable to report as underground the mineral resources those classified 
blocks above a cut-off grade of 5.0 g/t gold. This is based on a gold price of US$1,200 per troy ounce and a 
gold recovery of 95 percent. In the opinion of SRK, the resource evaluation reported in Table i is a reasonable

factors. The effective date of the Mineral Resource Statement is May 10, 2018.

Adjacent Properties and Other Relevant Data and Information 
 
There are no adjacent properties that are considered relevant to this technical report and there is no other 
relevant data available about the Curraghinalt gold project. 
 
Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
An additional 145 core boreholes for 46,487 metres and 181 underground channels/faces for 535 metres were 
drilled or sampled since the 2016 mineral resource model, representing a 35 percent increase to the borehole 
database by meterage. This new information considerably improves the confidence in the overall quality of the 
exploration database and in the continuity of the gold mineralization. 
 
SRK witnessed the extent of the exploration work and can confirm that Dalradian's exploration work is 
conducted using field procedures that meet generally accepted industry best practices. SRK is of the opinion 
that the exploration data are sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence the boundaries of the gold 
mineralization and support the evaluation and classification of mineral resources in accordance with generally 
accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices and CIM Definition 
Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 
 
The bulk of the gold mineralization is hosted in a stacked network of narrow quartz-carbonate-sulphide veins. 
Twenty-one vein resource domains were modelled on the extents of logged gold mineralized shear veins (D 
veins), and snapped to assays irrespective of gold grades. The vein wireframes were offset by four main 
observed faults. Extensive geostatistical studies were carried out on the composited data to select capping 
levels, and derive estimation parameters. Gold, sulphur, and silver were estimated into a block model using 
ordinary kriging informed from capped composited data. A density was estimated into each block. 
 
The block model was classified using a combination of tools, including confidence in the geological 
interpretation, search radii, minimum number of boreholes and composites, variography, and estimation pass. 
A Measured category was assigned to blocks within a 10 by 10 by 10 metres search radii around the 
underground workings informed by core and/or underground channel/face samples. An Indicated classification 
was assigned to blocks estimated in the first pass, using a minimum of two boreholes. The mean average 
distance of informing composites for Indicated blocks is 50 metres; while on average, these blocks are 
informed by six boreholes. All other blocks not classified as Measured or Indicated, whose grade was 
estimated in a vein domain, were classified as Inferred.  
 
The re-interpretation of the vein wireframes from vein intervals as defined in sampled assays, and not 0.5-
metre composites as in 2016, has the impact of reducing vein domain thickness to an average of 0.47 metres. 
This is accompanied by an increase in the average grade of each vein domain. Modelled vein domains 
delineate in-situ gold grade and do not consider a minimum mining width or potential planned mining dilution, 
which will likely be considered during the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves. 
 
The general estimation methodology did not change in 2018; however, some veins in the south, such as Crow 
vein, benefited from infill drilling at depth. The overall impact of the additional step-out and infill drilling and 
updated vein models is a moderate increase in Indicated and Inferred tonnages, accompanied by a significant 
increase in average grade, resulting in a significant increase in Indicated and Inferred metal. The additional 
drilling also delineated areas of considerable exploration potential to be targeted in future drilling campaigns. 
 
The updated mineral resource statement reported herein, along with a geotechnical study and ore sorting 
testwork, will support an ongoing updated feasibility study initiated by Dalradian. With material exploration 
activities concluded, SRK is not in a position to make meaningful recommendations for further work on the 
project until the results of the updated feasibility study have been disclosed.

1 Introduction and Terms of Reference 
 
The Curraghinalt gold deposit is a pre-development exploration project located in Northern Ireland, 
United Kingdom. It is located approximately 115 kilometres west of Belfast, the capital of Northern 
Ireland. Dalradian Resources Inc. (Dalradian) wholly owns 100 percent of the Curraghinalt gold 
deposit, which is part of the Curraghinalt property (previously the Tyrone project). 
 
Since 2016, Dalradian has completed significant infill and step-out drilling programs in addition to 
undergound sampling with the objective to expand the mineral resources of the project. In November 
2017, SRK was retained to prepare a new Mineral Resource Statement that was disclosed publically 
by Dalradian in a news release on May 10, 2018.  
 
This technical report documents the Mineral Resource Statement prepared by Dalradian and SRK for 
the Curraghinalt gold project. It was prepared following the guidelines of the Canadian Securities 
Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1. The Mineral Resource Statement 
reported herein was prepared in conformity with generally accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice and CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and 
Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines.  
 
On December 12, 2016, Dalradian released the results of an independent feasibility study prepared 
by JDS Energy & Mining Inc.(JDS) for the Curraghinalt project, which was documented in a 
publically disclosed technical report on January 25, 2017. The results of that study are now 
considered obsolete and will be superseded by the results of the mineral resource update. SRK 
understands that JDS will update the feasibility study with the mineral resource model corresponding 
to the Mineral Resource Statement reported herein. Hence, this technical report solely updates 
technical information relevant to support the new Mineral Resource Statement that was disclosed by 
Dalradian on May 10, 2018. 
 
The mineral resource model is based on exploration drilling results available to March 20, 2018, with 
a total of 731 core boreholes (178,130 metres) and 678 underground channel/face samples (2,397 
metres). 
 

1.1 Scope of Work 
 
The scope of work was defined in an engagement letter executed between Dalradian and SRK in 
November 2017 that includes the construction of a mineral resource model for the gold 
mineralization delineated by drilling and underground sampling at the Curraghinalt gold deposit. 
During the course of the work program, the scope of the services was revised to include the 
compilation of an updated technical report pursuant to National Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-
101F1 guidelines. This work typically involves an assessment of the following aspects of the project: 
 

• Topography, landscape, access 
• Regional and local geology 
• Exploration history 
• Audit of exploration work carried out on the project 
• Geological modelling 
• Mineral resource estimation, classification and validation 
• Preparation of a Mineral Resource Statement

The scope of the services provided by SRK for this assignment focussed on the geological aspects of 
the project. Where relevant, additional information pertaining to the mining, processing, and 
environmental aspects was provided by Dalradian and other consultants involved with the feasibility 
study work.  
 

1.2 Work Program 
 
The Mineral Resource Statement reported herein is a collaborative effort between Dalradian and 
SRK personnel. The exploration database was compiled and is maintained by Dalradian. It was 
audited by SRK. The geological model and outlines for the gold mineralization were constructed by 
SRK with the assistance of Dalradian. The construction of the mineral resource model was a 
collaborative effort between between Dalradian and SRK. In the opinion of authors of this report, the 
geological model is a reasonable representation of the distribution of the targeted mineralization at 
the current level of sampling. The geological modelling, geostatistical analysis, variography, grade 
models, and the Mineral Resource Statement were completed by SRK between the months of March 
and May, 2018. The update to the Mineral Resource Statement reported herein was presented to 
Dalradian in a memorandum report on May 10, 2018 and was disclosed in a news release dated May 
10, 2018. 
 
The technical report was assembled in Toronto during the months of May and June 2018. 
 

1.3 Basis of Technical Report 
 
This report is based on information collected by SRK on various site visits performed between 
November 2014 and October 2017 and additional information provided by Dalradian throughout the 
course of SRK's investigations. SRK has no reason to doubt the reliability of the information 
provided by Dalradian. Other information was obtained from the public domain. This technical 
report is based on the following sources of information:  
 

• Technical discussions with Dalradian personnel 
• Inspection of the Curraghinalt property area, including geological investigations of 

underground exposures and core 
• Review of exploration data collected by Dalradian 
• Information extracted from previous technical reports prepared for the property 
• Additional information from public domain sources 

 
1.4 Qualifications of SRK and Technical Report Team 

 
The SRK Group comprises of more than 1,400 professionals, offering expertise in a wide range of

3.1 Mineral Tenure 

 
Dalradian's Northern Ireland property measures approximately 120,000 hectares comprising six 
contiguous areas (DG1, DG2, DG3, DG4, DG5, and DG6), to which Dalradian has title. There are two 
elements comprising the titles—mining lease option agreements (Option Agreements) for gold and 
silver, and mineral prospecting licences that exclude gold and silver (Prospecting Licences). Both titles 
are controlled by two separate government bodies. Dalradian does not hold any other titles. 
 
Dalradian holds, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Dalradian Gold Ltd. (Dalradian Gold), a 
100 percent interest, subject to royalties described below, in Option Agreements and Prospecting 
Licences in counties Tyrone and Londonderry, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. The Crown 
Estate Commissioners have entered into Option Agreements with Dalradian Gold for gold and silver 
on six contiguous areas referred to as DG1, DG2, DG3, DG4, DG5, and DG6 (Table 2). The 
Department for the Economy has granted to Dalradian Gold Prospecting Licences for all metals over 
four areas (DG1, DG2, DG5, and DG6) with two others under application (DG3 and DG4) [Table 2]. 
 
The Crown Estate Commissioners Option Agreements have a six-year term and can be renewed 
indefinitely subject to relevant conditions being met and satisfied at the Crown Estate 
Commissioners' discretion.  
 
The Option Agreements for DG1 to DG6 have a renewal term expiring December 31, 2021.  
 
The current Prospecting Licences for DG1 and DG2 (named DG1/14 and DG2/14) expire 
December 31, 2019. A six-year licence can be applied for four months prior to the expiration of DG1 
and DG2. The Prospecting Licences for DG3 and DG4 (named DG3/11 and DG4/11) expired on 
April 23, 2017, and are under application for a new six-year agreement.  
 
The Department for the Economy uses the Irish National Grid system of easting and northing for 
reference. The Northern Ireland property is located at approximately 257,700 mE and 386,000 mN.  
 
The mineral resources discussed herein are located entirely on licence DG1.

Figure 2: Land Tenure Map 
 
 
Table 3 lists the required annual expenditures made on each of the four licences. Tournigan Gold 
Corp (Tournigan) held the licences DG1 – DG4 from 2002 to late 2009, at which time they were 
transferred to Dalradian. The mineral prospecting licences outline the annual general work program 
to be undertaken on the four licence areas.  
 
Prospecting Licences and Option Agreements in Northern Ireland are issued for six-year periods and 
may be renewed (or extended), subject to relevant conditions being met and satisfied. After the end 
of each year, a progress work report is submitted within three months of the licence anniversary date 
to the licensing authorities. Included in the reports is a summary of the work performed for the year 
and an audited summary of the spending. At the end of each six-year period, a full reissuing 
application process must be undertaken, whereby a full six-year work report is submitted to the 
licensing bodies along with a new application for another six-year period. Renewals, extensions, and 
reissuing are not automatic.

The Department for the Economy is required to consult with other departments and with public 
bodies concerning its intention to issue a licence. It is also required to place notices in the Belfast 
Gazette and at least one local newspaper. This is primarily to allow the owners of surface land within 
the area under application the opportunity to make their views known. 
 
The Department for the Economy notes that a draft licence and a "letter of offer" are provided to 
applicants once all comments have been considered. The letter of offer may contain a number of 
conditions, although the Department for the Economy notes that, at the prospecting stage, it is 
usually sufficient for the applicant to inform all listed contacts of its plans and progress. When the 
conditions set out in the letter of offer are accepted and the terms of the draft licence agreed upon, 
the licence is executed by the Department for the Economy and the company. 
 
The Department for the Economy states that planning permission is not required for early stage 
exploration under Part 16 Class A of the General Permitted Development Order (Northern Ireland) 
2015 subject to specified limitations and conditions, although the local council must be informed of 
the planned work, including the nature and scale, time, and location of the company's activities, and 
drilling locations. 
 

3.2 Underlying Agreements 
 
On August 30, 2017, Dalradian concluded the acquisition of the 2% net smelter return royalty on a 
portion of the Northern Ireland properties (as defined in a royalty agreement, dated December 13, 
2004), including the Curraghinalt gold deposit from Minco plc under Rule 2.5 of the Irish Takeover 
Panel Act, Takeover Rules 2013. On April 23, 2018, the royalty agreement was officially terminated.

SRK Team  Dalradian_Curraghinalt_2018_TR_3CD016002_JCS_DC_gc_ol_ah_20180620.docx June 22, 2018 

As provided in the Option Agreements, a 4 percent royalty will be payable to the Crown Estate 
Commissioners upon production of silver and/or gold on the Northern Ireland property. 
 

3.3 Permits and Authorization 
 
For exploration work, formal notice of intention to enter land to carry out work must be given, and 
the agreement of landowners sought, before entering any property. Compensation is generally 
payable to the landowner for any damage caused during exploration.  
 
Dalradian has obtained all necessary permits and certifications from governmental agencies to allow 
for exploration on the property. This includes three permits for the underground exploration program 
(now complete), including approval from Northern Ireland regulators for a number of management 
plans governing items such as waste, water, noise, traffic, and dust. 
 

3.4 Environmental Considerations 
 
Much of the property occurs within the Sperrin Mountains, which are designated an Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) as shown in Figure 1. In addition, there are a number of 
protected and special interest areas around the project. The nearest Areas of Special Scientific 
Interest to the project are the Owenkillew River, the Mullaghcarn/Mountfield Quarry, Murrins, 
Cashel Rock, Boorin Wood, and Black Bog. The nearest Special Areas of Conservation include 
Drumlea and Mullan Woods, Owenkillew River, and Black Bog. 
 
Environmental baseline studies were initiated by SLR Consulting for Dalradian in June, 2010 and 
have included collecting data on meteorology, hydrology, hydrogeology, water quality, sediment 
quality, acid rock generation potential of the mineral and waste rock, flora, terrestrial and aquatic 
fauna, air quality, visual resources, cultural heritage resources, and the local socio-economy. 
Dalradian continues to gather environmental baseline data to be used in support of the environmental 
and social impact assessment and, in addition, more detailed site-specific environmental studies are 
ongoing. Dalradian does not currently have a permit for mining the Curraghinalt gold deposit. 
 
Dalradian commenced the environmental and social impact assessment at the end of 2014 to 
examine the potential impacts of a full mine build, as well as options for the elimination or 
mitigation of such impacts. SRK UK is lead and co-ordinating environmental consultant for delivery 
of the environmental and social impact assessment. The report, together with a project description, 
has formed the basis of a planning application for the full mine build which was submitted to the 
Department for Infrastructure in November 2017. During 2018, activities in permitting are expected 
to include preparation of responses to queries on the planning application and preparation of a 
number of ancillary permitting applications. 
  
Dalradian and SRK UK along with other consultants began stakeholder engagement for the 
environmental and social impact assessment in December 2015 with an initial meeting with the 
Department for Infrastructure officials. This was followed by other government agency meetings and 
initial community consultations in January 2016. The purpose of these meetings was to receive 
government agency, community, and other stakeholder feedback to input into the project description 
and environmental and social impact assessment. Up to November 2017, 44 meetings were held with 
various regulatory authorities alone. Formal stakeholder feedback on the planning application is 
currently being received and will continue to be addressed as the application(s) proceeds.

4 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure, and Physiography 
 

4.1 Accessibility 
 
From Belfast, the capital city of Northern Ireland, the project and the nearest town, Omagh, is 
located approximately 115 kilometres west by paved road, more than half of which is dual 
carriageway (limited access highway). Access to the property is via a number of highways and local 
roads, including the B48 from Omagh to Gortin, and the B46 from Gortin to Greencastle. Local 
country roads, private roads, and farm tracks provide generally good access within the property. 
 
Belfast supports a population of approximately 300,000 inhabitants. A domestic and an international 
airport serve the city, together offering frequent daily flights to the rest of the UK and Europe. 
 

4.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 
The town of Omagh (population 22,000) provides lodging and local labour, as well as the smaller 
local villages of Gortin, Rousky, and Greencastle. Few experienced mining personnel are available 
locally, although there is a small mining industry in Northern Ireland (salt and gold), and the Irish 
Republic has a number of underground base metal mines. There are large quarrying and mining 
supply industries in Northern Ireland and Ireland. The principal economic activities in the area of the 
licences are sheep farming and, to a lesser extent, the raising of beef cattle. 
 
The village of Gortin is located a few kilometres from the Curraghinalt gold deposit at the western 
edge of licence DG1. Dalradian has a field office there, as well as storage facilities, all of which are 
rented. Gortin is centrally located within the licence areas and well situated to support the 
exploration program. Dalradian also leases an office and core storage facility in Omagh near the road 
leading to Gortin. Geology and administration staff are located there, as well as the principal core 
logging and storage facility. The village of Greencastle and the hamlet of Rousky lie east of Gortin 
along the Crockanboy Road. 
 
An electrical power substation is located at Plumbridge, approximately 22 kilometres north of 
Omagh and 6.5 kilometres north of Gortin, and the main 110 kilovolt (kV) power line runs just 
outside Omagh. Local water resources are abundant. 
 
During 2015, surface infrastructure at the mine portal increased significantly with the construction of 
a water treatment plant, offices, temporary rock storage area, and workshops (Figure 3). Throughout 
2015 and 2016, Dalradian completed approximately 989 metres of underground development, 
increasing the total development on the project to 1,785 metres with the Ennex tunneling work 
completed in the 1980s, including drifts, cross-cuts, raises, drilling chambers, and safety bays 
(Figure 3).

4.3 Climate 

 
One of the closest meteorological base station is located in Castlederg, 25 kilometres northwest of 
Omagh and 23 kilometres west of Gortin. Local climate conditions are temperate, with an average 
annual temperature of 9 degrees Celsius, and average daily temperatures varying between 
4.1 degrees Celsius and 14.7 degrees Celsius throughout the year. Average annual precipitation is 
852 millimetres, the majority of which falls in the winter months between September and January 
(average >80 millimetres per month). Snowfall is usually restricted to areas of higher elevation and 
occurs on 10 days or less per year. Exploration activities can generally be conducted year-round. 
 

4.4 Physiography 
 
The topography consists of rolling hills and broad valleys (Figure 3). Glacial deposits and peat cover 
much of the area, resulting in mixed forest and heathlands, as well as farmland in the valleys. Relief 
ranges between around 100 metres above sea level in the major river valleys to a maximum height of 
approximately 680 metres above sea level. 
 
Much of the property occurs within the Sperrin Mountains, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural 
Beauty. Stretching from the Strule Valley in the west to the perimeter of the Lough Neagh lowlands 
in the east, this area presents vast expanses of moorland penetrated by narrow glens and deep 
valleys. In its south, the Burren area is noted for its lakes, sandy eskers, and other glacial features. 
There are eight such Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty in Northern Ireland.

5 History 
 
Information in this section is summarized from a previous technical report prepared by Micon 
International Ltd. (Micon, 2014). 
 

5.1 Prior Ownership and Changes 
 
The property containing the Curraghinalt deposit was initially acquired by Ulster Base Metals (which 
later became Ulster Minerals) in 1981, an entity which later became a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
Ennex International plc (Ennex). Ennex conducted exploration on the property between 1982 and 
1999. Ennex sold its interest in Ulster Minerals to Nickelodeon in January 2000. In August 2000, the 
name of Nickelodeon was changed to Strongbow Resources Inc., and subsequently to Strongbow 
Exploration Inc. (Strongbow). 
 
In February 2003, Tournigan Gold Corp (Tournigan) entered into an option agreement with 
Strongbow to earn an interest of up to 100 percent in the Curraghinalt deposit, located within a 
prospecting licence known as UM-11/96. Terms included staged exploration expenditures of 
C$4.0 million over a period of seven years, the delivery of a bankable feasibility study, and issuing 
shares to Strongbow at a price based on a 90-day trading average. At the same time, Tournigan 
entered into a similar option agreement with Strongbow for its Tyrone project (previous name of 
Northern Ireland property), located within prospecting licence UM-12/96. Tournigan established 
Dalradian Gold Ltd. (Dalradian Gold) as a wholly-owned subsidiary through which it would earn its 
interests in the Curraghinalt (UM-11/96) and Tyrone (UM-12/96) properties. 
 
In the following year (February 2004), Tournigan entered into a letter agreement with Strongbow for 
the outright purchase by Tournigan of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Ulster Minerals 
through the issue of 5 million shares of Tournigan. The earlier option agreements were terminated 
and replaced by the letter of agreement. A net smelter return (NSR) of 2 percent held by Ennex was 
transferred to Minco plc. Full transfer of ownership in Ulster Minerals to Tournigan was completed 
in December 2004. 
 
Tournigan then applied to the licensing authorities, and received licences TG-3 and TG-4 (for both 
minerals and precious metals) to the northwest of UM-11/96 and UM-12/96. 
 
Ulster Minerals licences UM-11/96 and UM-12/96 were later renamed UM-1 and UM-2, and 
ultimately DG1 and DG2. During the renaming and re-registering process, the internal boundary 
between DG1 and DG2 was reoriented from east-west to a position that reflects the approximate 
location of the Omagh Thrust Fault.  
 
In October 2009, Dalradian completed a purchase and sale agreement with Tournigan to acquire all 
of the issued and outstanding shares of Dalradian Gold, which included the licences, mineral rights, 
and surface rights (including easements) in the area of interest. The area of interest is defined in the 
agreement as Mineral Prospecting Licences DG1, DG2, TG-3, and TG-4; the latter two being 
renamed to DG3 and DG4 by the Department for the Economy after acquisition.

5.2 Previous Exploration Work 

 
Gold was recognized in the gravels of the Moyola River to the east of the property in 1652, and in 
the 1930s, an English company reported plans for alluvial gold mining in a prospectus. Documented 
exploration in the area dates back to the early 1970s, when companies such as AMAX Exploration of 
the UK, Consolidated Goldfields, Selection Trust, and RioFinex completed grassroots exploration 
campaigns over the areas covered by DG1, DG2, DG3, and DG4. Following the 1975 report titled 
"The Geology and Metalliferous Mineral Potential of the Sperrin Mountains Area" by the Geological 
Survey of Northern Ireland (GSNI), the ground covered by the licences comprising the property 
received renewed interest by a number of companies. Licence DG1 has been the focus of most of the 
historical exploration on the property, as outlined in Table 4.

The four phases of exploration at Curraghinalt, conducted by Ennex between 1983 and 1997, are 
summarized as follows: 
 
Phase 1 (April 1983 to July 1987): 
 

• Detailed prospecting, geochemistry, and geophysics 
• 71 trenches (4,483 metres) and 72 core boreholes (6,938 metres) 

 
Phase 2 (August 1987 to March 1989): 
 

• Underground development program, including development of an adit (412 metres), lateral 
drifting (325 metres), and raising (60 metres)

• 26 underground core boreholes (659 metres) and 5 surface infill boreholes (546 metres) 
 
Phase 3 (May 1995 to March 1996): 
 

• Infill and reconnaissance drilling  
• Reconnaissance drilling of veins to the southwest (60 core boreholes, 5,096 metres) 

 
Phase 4 (June 1996 to May 1997): 
 

• Infill drilling on 25 metres to 30 metres centres in the main vein areas (50 core boreholes, 
5,412 metres) 

 
Between 1997, when Ennex transferred its interest to Nickelodeon, and late 2002, when the 
agreement was signed between Strongbow and Tournigan, little work was done at Curraghinalt. 
 
The Tournigan exploration at Curraghinalt can be divided into three phases. 
 
Phase 1, 2003 to January 2005: 
 

• 22,910 soil samples  
• Small geophysical survey conducted 
• Mapping and prospecting on the DG1 Licence area 
• 26 core boreholes (4,391 metres) at Curraghinalt 
• 7 core boreholes (830 metres) at Glenlark 

 
Phase 2, January 2005 to 2007: 
 

• 2 core boreholes (183 metres) drilled in the area of the Crowsfoot-Bend 
• 24 infill core boreholes (4,721 metres) primarily on the Southeast Extension target 

 
Phase 3, 2007 to 2009: 
 

• 5 deep core boreholes (3,004 metres)  
 
After completion of the 2007 to 2008 drilling program, Tournigan ceased all exploration activity at 
the Curraghinalt deposit. Except for some prospecting on TG-3 and TG-4 in 2008, the property 
remained inactive until its acquisition by Dalradian in 2009. 
 
Exploration programs on licence DG2 initially targeted base metals; later both gold and base metals 
were sought. Historical exploration on DG2 is summarized in Table 5. 
 
The principal target of interest for Ennex on the DG2 licence was the Cashel Rock showing, where a 
gold-mineralized silicified rhyolite breccia outcrop is exposed at surface. At this location, 15 shallow 
boreholes (985 metres) were drilled in a cluster with an additional six boreholes drilled in the area. 
Results and example sections were presented in a previous technical report by Micon International 
Ltd. (Micon, 2010).  
 
Licences DG3 and DG4 have also been the subject of regional-scale exploration programs (Table 6 
and Table 7). There has not been follow-up drilling on any targets on these licences.

5.3 Previous Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
Historical mineral resource estimates presented in this section are superseded by the mineral resource 
estimate discussed herein. The information presented in this section is relevant to provide context but 
should not to be relied upon. 
 
In May 1997, a polygonal resource estimate was prepared on behalf of Ennex by CSA Group (CSA, 
1997). Tully prepared a mineral resource estimate in 2005 (Tully, 2005).  
 
Micon International Ltd. (Micon) completed a series of mineral resource estimates on the 
Curraghinalt deposit starting with one for Tournigan in 2007 (Micon, 2007), followed by two 
estimates for Dalradian in 2010 and 2011 (Micon, 2010 and Micon, 2012a). The 2011 estimate by 
Micon led to an initial preliminary economic assessment (Micon, 2012b). 
 
T. Maunula & Associates Consulting Inc. (Maunula) prepared a Mineral Resource Statement for the 
Curraghinalt gold deposit in May 2014 (Maunula, 2014) for Dalradian that led to a follow-up 
preliminary economic assessment prepared by Micon in October 2014 (Micon, 2014). The model 
was created with a minimum down-hole width of 2.0 metres and was reported at a cut-off grade of 
5 grams gold per tonne (g/t gold).  
 
In June 2016, SRK prepared a technical report in accordance with the Canadian Securities 
Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 in support of a Mineral Resource Statement disclosed 
by Dalradian on May 5, 2016. This mineral resource led to a feasibility study prepared by JDS 
disclosed by Dalradian on December 12, 2016 and reported in a National Instrument 43-101 
technical report on January 25, 2017. 
 
The 2005 and 2007 Mineral Resource Statements can be found on SEDAR (www.sedar.com), filed 
under Azarga Metals Corp. (current name of Tournigan). The 2010 to 2017 technical reports are also 
available on SEDAR filed under Dalradian.

6 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
 

6.1 Regional Geology 
 
The bedrock geology of Northern Ireland is a complex assemblage of units deposited from the 
Mesoproterozoic to the Paleogene (British Geological Survey, 2016). It can be divided into four 
quadrants (Figure 4): 
 

• Northwest - composed predominantly of the Proterozoic Dalradian Supergroup and the early 
Ordovician Tyrone Igneous Complex 

• Southeast - composed mainly of rocks of the Southern Uplands/Longford-Down Terrane, an 
allochthonous prism composed of an Ordovician and Silurian turbidite sequence 

• Southwest - underlain mainly by Upper Palaeozoic sedimentary rock deposited in 
continental to marine environments 

• Northeast - underlain by the early Palaeogene (60 – 55 Ma), subaerial Antrim Lava Group 
and minor underlying Paleozoic units. 

 
The local geology of the project area comprises three main rock groups: 
 

• Dalradian metasediments in the Grampian terrane to the north of the Omagh Thrust 
• The Tyrone Igneous Complex in the Midland Valley terrane south of the Omagh Thrust 
• Upper Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Palaeogene sedimentary rocks which are widely distributed 

throughout these terranes, particulary within the DG6 Licence. 
 
Mitchell (2004) described the tectonic evolution of Northern Ireland from which the following is 
summarized. The Caledonian orogenic belt of the British and Irish Caledonides resulted from the 
progressive closure of the Iapetus Ocean and Tornquist Sea during the early Palaeozoic. Assembly 
and docking of the terranes that form the basement in Northern Ireland commenced in mid-
Ordovician time and continued for 80 Ma through the Silurian and finished in the Early Devonian. 
Final closure was accommodated by sinistral strike-slip movement on terrane bounding faults. 
Northern Ireland covers three of the seven suspect terranes that together constitute the Caledonian 
Orogen in Ireland. From north to south, these are referred to as the Central Highlands (Grampian) 
Terrane, Midland Valley Terrane, and the Southern Uplands/Longford-Down Terrane. 
 
Dalradian's Northern Ireland property straddles two of these terranes: the Central Highlands to the 
north (DG1, DG3, DG4, DG5 and DG6) and the Midland Valley to the south (DG2). The Central 
Highland Terrane consists of Moinian (Mesoproterozoic, not expressed on property) and Dalradian 
(Neoproterozoic-Cambrian) rocks and Caledonian igneous intrusions. The Dalradian Supergroup that 
hosts the Curraghinalt gold deposits comprises Neoproterozoic metasedimentary and mafic meta-
igneous rocks which were deposited on the Laurentian passive continental margin between ca. 800 – 
500 Ma (Strachan et al., 2002; Cooper and Johnston, 2004). Dalradian sedimentation was terminated 
by an arc-continent collision during the Ordovician Grampian event of the Caledonian Orogeny 
(Hollis et al., 2012), followed by polyphase deformation and regional metamorphism at ca. 475 – 
465 Ma (Friedrich et al., 1999).

The southern margin of the terrane is marked by the concealed Fair Head-Clew Bay Line, which is 
interpreted as the southwesterly extension or major splay of the Highland Boundary Fault in 
Scotland. This forms a major terrane-bounding structure. The associated regional magnetic lineament 
that extends southwestwards to Clew Bay in County Galway is located 10 kilometres north of the 
Grampian northwest-dipping Omagh Thrust Fault. The Omagh Thrust Fault is part of the Fair Head 
– Clew Bay Line, and separates Dalradian rocks to the north from the underlying Ordovician Tyrone 
Igneous Complex to the south (Cooper and Mitchell, 2004) (Figure 5). 
 
The Midland Valley Terrane in Northern Ireland comprises Upper Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Lower 
Cenozoic rocks. However, in County Tyrone, a late Ordovician to early Silurian succession is 
exposed with part of an early Ordovician ophiolite and an island arc volcanic complex (Tyrone 
Igneous Complex) at its base. The Tyrone Igneous Complex is comprised of the Tyrone Plutonic 
Group and the Tyrone Volcanic Group (Cooper and Mitchell, 2004). The Tyrone Plutonic Group 
forms the upper part of a ca. 484 – 480 Ma supra-subduction zone ophiolite. It was accreted with the 
ca. 475 – 469 Ma Tyrone Volcanic Group island arc onto an outboard micro-continental block prior 
to the ca. 470 Ma Grampian event of the Caledonian Orogeny (Cooper et al., 2008, 2011; Hollis et 
al., 2012, 2014).

At the core of the Tyrone Igneous Complex is the fault bounded Central Inlier. This consists of 
psammitic and semipelitic paragneiss known as the Corvanaghan Formation (Cooper and Johnston, 
2004). While originally thought to be of Moinian affinity (Cooper and Johnston, 2004), more recent 
dating has correlated the Central Inlier with either the Argyll or Southern Highland Groups of the 
Dalradian Supergroup (Chew et al., 2008). This formation originally formed part of the Central 
Highlands Terrane, and was metamorphosed and deformed prior to ca. 468 Ma. It represents part of 
an outboard segment of Laurentia, possibly detached as a micro-continent prior to arc continental 
collision (Chew et al., 2008). 
 
The Grampian Orogeny resulted in crustal thickening (folding - D1), nappe structures (recumbent 
southeast-facing folds - D2), and peak metamorphism (development of crenulation cleavage - D3) 
(Cooper and Johnston, 2004). Orogenic collapse was followed by exhumation, extension and partial 
melting at ca. 470 – 450 Ma (Alsop and Hutton, 1993; Flowerdew et al., 2000; Clift et al., 2004). 
The mid-Silurian Scandian event of the Caledonian Orogeny saw the final closure of the Iapetus 
Ocean. This was recorded in Northern Ireland with magmatism and further deformation (Kirkland et 
al., 2013). 
 
Peak metamorphism of the Grampian Orogeny coincided with the southeast-directed emplacement of 
the Dalradian Supergroup over the Tyrone Igneous Complex along the Omagh Thrust Fault (Figure 5 
and Figure 6). This event overlapped with the intrusion of arc-related plutons into the Tyrone 
Volcanic Group at ca. 470 – 464 Ma (Cooper et al., 2008 and 2011; Hollis et al., 2012 and 2014). 
Orogenic collapse was coeval with the development of regional-scale extensional shearing and 
accompanied by northeast-trending quartz veins (Alsop and Hutton, 1993), that coincide with the 
earliest phase of gold mineralization at Curraghinalt.

6.2 Property Geology 

 
6.2.1 Dalradian Supergroup – Licences DG1, DG2, DG3, DG4, DG5 and DG6 

 
Licences DG1, DG3, DG4, DG5, and DG6 are underlain by Neoproterozoic-aged rocks of the 
Dalradian Supergroup that form the Sperrin Mountains (Figure 7). The Dalradian Supergroup is 
divided into the Argyll Group and Southern Highland Group on the property, both comprised of 
predominantly clastic marine sedimentary rocks deposited in a rift basin. The oldest rocks on the 
property belong to the Newtownstewart Formation/Killeter Quartzite Formation (Argyll Group), 
which is exposed in the core of the recumbent Sperrin Fold and is flanked by Dungiven Limestone 
Formation (Table 8) in DG3, DG4, DG5 and DG6. The Southern Highland Group is interpreted to 
flank the Argyll Group on both limbs of the Sperrin Fold, although the stratigraphy differs markedly 
between the north and south limbs. Mitchell (2004) notes that "an absence of distinctive marker 
horizons allied to lateral facies changes makes correlation difficult between formations and results in 
the different nomenclature north and south of the fold axis." 
 
The Southern Highland Group comprises a thick sequence of turbiditic arenite and pelitic 
metasedimentary rocks with rare volcaniclastic (green bed) and calcareous schist units (Figure 7). 
Progressing southeastward onto DG1, the Southern Highland Group is exposed and is divided from 
northwest to southeast into the Dart, Glenelly, Glengawna and Mullaghcarn formations. The 
mineralized quartz-carbonate veins of the Curraghinalt deposit are hosted by the Mullaghcarn 
Formation.

Dart Formation 
At the base of the Dart Formation, in contact with the underlying Dungiven Limestone Formation is 
the Glenga Amphibolite Member, which is interpreted as a resedimented volcaniclastic siltstone and 
sandstone. The remainder of the formation consists of conglomerate, psammite, schistose semi-
pelite, and a volcaniclastic member. 
 
Glenelly Formation 
The Glenelly Formation comprises silvery to greenish grey schistose pelite and semi-pelite with 
minor psammite and limestone. Plagioclase porphyroblasts are ubiquitous in the rocks of this 
formation with more localized occurrences of small euhedral garnet and randomly distributed 
needles of tourmaline. Also present is a volcaniclastic member, and a limestone and calcareous semi-
pelite member.

semi-pelite. Although not subdivided on the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland maps because of 
lack of outcrop (Figure 7), a variation in magnetic intensity is apparent in the regional Tellus 
geophysical data suggesting internal variations are present. 
 
The southern boundary of the Dalradian Supergroup is marked by the Omagh Thrust Fault 
(Figure 7), a moderately northwest dipping thrust fault active as late as the Carboniferous. 
 
Deformation and Metamorphism of the Dalradian Supergroup 
The following is summarized from Mitchell (2004). At least four phases of deformation are 
recognized in Dalradian rocks on the property: 
 

• D1 - Weakly preserved as barely discernible folds and cleavage 
• D2 - Dominant deformation of the Grampian Orogeny associated with the formation of major 

regional southeast-facing recumbent anticlines including the Sperrin Fold 
• D3 - Southeast-directed deformation in the south Sperrin mountains resulted in minor 

southeasterly-verging folds and low-angle, north northwest-dipping thrust faults such as the 
Omagh Thrust Fault which transposed Dalradian rocks to the south southeast over the early 
Ordovician Tyrone Igneous Complex 

• Post-D3 - Late deformation associated with localized sets of kink bands and late stage brittle 
fractures. 

 
The Dalradian Supergroup in Northern Ireland preserves a thermal and pressure gradient increasing 
from lower greenschist facies in the north to lower amphibolite facies in the south, close to the 
Omagh Thrust Fault. 
 

6.2.2 Tyrone Igneous Complex – Licence DG2 
 
The following is taken from Hollis (2012). 
 
"Licence DG2 is largely covered by the Tyrone Igneous Complex, which is exposed over 
approximately 350 square kilometres, within the Midland Valley Terrane and is one of the largest 
areas of ophiolitic and arc-related rocks exposed along the northern margin of Iapetus within the 
British and Irish Caledonides. It is broadly divisible into the ophiolitic Tyrone Plutonic Group and 
the younger arc-related Tyrone Volcanic Group. The northwestern edge of the Tyrone Igneous 
Complex is bounded by the Omagh Thrust Fault, which has emplaced Neoproterozoic Dalradian 
Supergroup metasedimentary rocks above the Tyrone Volcanic Group. Within the central regions of 
the complex (to the southeast of DG2), the structurally underlying metamorphic basement (Tyrone 
Central Inlier) is exposed. A suite of granitic to tonalitic plutons (ca 470 to 464 Ma) intrudes the 
Tyrone Igneous Complex and Tyrone Central Inlier (Cooper et al., 2011)." 
 
"The Tyrone Plutonic Group is interpreted to represent the uppermost portion of a dismembered 
suprasubduction zone ophiolite and is characterized by layered, isotropic and pegmatitic gabbros, 
sheeted diabase dikes and the occurrence of rare pillow lavas (Cooper et al., 2011 and references 
therein). Layered olivine gabbro has provided a uranium-lead zircon age of 479.6 ± 1.1 Ma (Cooper 
et al., 2011). Accretion to the Tyrone Central Inlier must have occurred prior to the intrusion of a 
470.3 Ma ± 1.9 Ma tonalite, which contains inherited Proterozoic zircons and roof pendants of 
ophiolitic material (Cooper et al., 2011)." 
 
"The Tyrone Volcanic Group forms the upper part of the Tyrone Igneous Complex and comprises 
mafic to intermediate pillowed and sheeted lavas, tuffs, rhyolite, banded chert, ferruginous jasperoid 
(ironstone) and argillaceous sedimentary rocks (Mitchell, 2004). The Tyrone Volcanic Group

(473 Ma ± 0.8 Ma, Cooper et al., 2008) is interpreted to have formed within a peri-Laurentian island 
arc/back-arc, which was accreted to the Tyrone Central Inlier following emplacement of the Tyrone 
Plutonic Group (Draut et al., 2009; Cooper et al., 2011)."  
 
Hollis et al. (2012) has revised the stratigraphy of the Tyrone Volcanic Group based on mapping and 
geophysics (Figure 8) and the following is summarized from that work. The lower part of the Tyrone 
Volcanic Group is restricted to south of the Beaghmore Fault (southwestern and eastern blocks) and 
is dominated by basaltic to andesitic lavas and volcaniclastic rocks, with subsidiary agglomerate, 
layered chert, ferruginous jasperoid (ironstone), finely laminated argillaceous sedimentary rocks, and 
rare rhyolite breccia, deformed into the northeast trending upright Copney anticline. All units in the 
lower Tyrone Volcanic Group have been subjected to varying degrees of hydrothermal alteration and 
are characterized by regional sub-greenschist- to greenschist-facies metamorphic assemblages. 
Abundant sills of undeformed quartz ± feldspar porphyritic dacite cut all stratigraphic levels of the 
Tyrone Volcanic Group.

North of the Beaghmore Fault, the Greencastle and Broughderg formations of the upper Tyrone 
Volcanic Group are exposed as a conformable sequence dipping between 35 and 60 degrees to the 
northwest. Dalradian metasedimentary rocks overlie the succession along its western edge, separated 
by the low-angle Omagh Thrust Fault, which dips around 30 degrees to the northwest (Alsop and 
Hutton, 1993). The crosscutting nature of the Omagh Thrust Fault provides a relatively complete 
section through the upper part of the Tyrone Volcanic Group, which has been metamorphosed to 
chlorite-grade greenschist facies. Further south, sub-greenschist facies metamorphic assemblages are 
preserved around Formil. Hydrothermal alteration and associated zinc-lead-copper (gold) 
mineralization are widespread within the Greencastle and Broughderg formations. Mineralization is 
characterized by pyrite-sphalerite-galena and chalcopyrite in locally silicified, sericitic and/or 
chloritic tuff/rhyolite (Clifford et al., 1992). Between Racolpa and Broughderg, bodies of tonalite 
and sills of quartz ± feldspar porphyry intrude both formations. The Greencastle Formation is a 
relatively thick succession dominated by chloritic, locally sericitized and siliceous quartzo-
feldspathic crystal tuff, flow-banded and brecciated rhyolite, rhyolitic lapilli tuff, lesser diorite, rare 
arkosic sandstone, and localized occurrences of hornblende-phyric tuff. The overlying Broughderg 
Formation is a diverse succession of intermediate to felsic crystal and lesser lapilli tuff/schist, 
rhyolite (e.g., around Crosh), vesicular basalt, argillaceous sedimentary rocks, layered chert, and 
black ironstone (silica-magnetite) with bedded pyrite.  
 
A late suite of I-type, calc-alkalic, tonalitic to granitic plutons intrude the Tyrone Igneous Complex 
and Tyrone Central Inlier (Draut et al., 2004). Recent uranium-lead zircon geochronology indicates 
these were intruded between ca. 470 and 464 Ma (Cooper et al., 2011).  
 
A gently northwest dipping cleavage intensifies northwards in the volcanics towards the Omagh 
Thrust Fault, and is correlated with the S3 fabric in the Dalradian Supergroup. The Laght Hill 
Tonalite has variable relationships with the fabric in the volcanics—early stage tonalite porphyry 
bodies are deformed by it, but the main body itself cuts the fabric and contains xenoliths that contain 
the fabric. This suggests that magmatic activity outlasted the overthrusting of the volcanics by the 
Dalradian (Hollis, 2012). 
 
Hollis et al., (2014) suggests the Tyrone Igneous Complex of Northern Ireland represents a possible 
broad correlative of the Buchans-Robert's Arm Belt of Newfoundland, host to some of the most 
metal rich volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits globally. Stratigraphic horizons 
prospective for volcanogenic massive sulphide mineralization in the Tyrone Igneous Complex are 
associated with rift-related magmatism, hydrothermal alteration, synvolcanic faults, and high-level 
subvolcanic intrusions (gabbro, diorite, and/or tonalite). Locally intense hydrothermal alteration is 
characterized by sodium-depletion, elevated silica, magnesium oxide, barium/strontium, bismuth, 
antimony, chlorite-carbonate-pyrite alteration index (CCPI). On the property, stratigraphic horizons 
favorable for VMS mineralization occur in the Greencastle Formation and in the Broughderg 
Formation, all of which contain occurrences of base and precious metal mineralization (Hollis et al., 
2014). 
 

6.2.3 Carboniferous – Licences DG1, DG3 and DG6 
 
Two Carboniferous basins are present within the licence area: the Omagh Basin comprises the 
Omagh Sandstone Group to south and the Newtonstewart Outlier comprises the Owenkillew 
Sandstone Group to the north (Figure 7), while to the northeast of DG6 the Roe Valley Group and 
Tyrone Group unconformably overly the Dalradian basement.

Omagh Sandstone Group 
The Omagh Sandstone Group rests unconformably on Dalradian rocks. The basal unit is up to 
100 metres thick and is composed of non-fossiliferous red sandstone with calcrete nodules, and 
quartz pebble conglomerates (Mitchell, 2004). Much of the remaining sequence is dominated by 
channel sandstone and siltstone that contains Courceyan to early Chadian miospores. However, thin 
algal limestones with evaporite replacement textures occur locally. Some of the limestones contain 
rare brachiopods. The exact thickness of this group is difficult to estimate based on the amount of 
uplift, folding, and erosion that has taken place (Mitchell, 2004). 
 
Owenkillew Sandstone Group 
The Owenkillew Sandstone Group also rests unconformably on the Dalradian rocks and comprises 
approximately 1,500 metres of predominantly non-marine strata present within a half graben. Rock 
types include greenish-grey and purplish-red sandstone and siltstone, with thin beds of algal 
laminated limestone (Mitchell, 2004). Mudstones containing miospores have indicated an early 
Chadian age. The group is thought to have formed in an inter-cratonic basin with current indicators 
suggesting the sediment source is to the north (Mitchell, 2004). 
 
Roe Valley Group 
The Spincha Burn Formation is a basal clastic unit of the Roe Valley Group that unconformably 
overlies the Dalradian meta-sediments. The succession of conglomerate beds have clasts consisting 
of vein quartz and green pssamites, are very coarse and unfossiliferous, and range in approximately 
25 to 100 metres thick. 
 
The Barony Glen Formation of the Roe Valley Group is dominated by calcrete mudstones, siltstones 
and lesser palaeosols. The lower sections has been interpreted as padogenic and lacustrine deposited, 
while its upper sections are dominated by thin limestones and grey mudstones which mark a 
transition to a marginal marine environment. The formation thickness varies between 150 and 200 
metres and the presence of miospores Schopfites claviger and Auroraspora macra place it within the 
Courceyan. 
 
Tyrone Group 
The Iniscarn Formation of the Tyrone group is approximately 400 metres thick and is composed of 
purplish to brown conglomerates and breccias. Clasts of the conglomerate in the lower portion are up 
to two metres long suspended in a coarse matrix. The upper section is poorly sorted with angular 
fedspathic brecciation, however exhibits a minor degree of upwards fining into the overlying 
horizons. 
 
The Drumard and Mormeal members of the Altagoan Formation over the Iniscarn Formation. The 
lower Drumard member is approximately 300 metres thick and consists of purple to brown 
unfossiliferous fining-upwards series of sandstones, siltstones and mudstones. The overlying 
mormeal member is approximately 250 metres thick and consists of mudstone and channelized 
sandstones. Within this section are five narrow evaporite beds that contain calcide pseudomorphs of 
halite and gypsum. Grey mudstones contain fossilized marine macrofaunal bivalves and ostracods, as 
well as miospores Auroaspora Schopfites claviger and more rare Lycospora pusilla, which indicates 
an early Chadian age.

6.2.4 Triassic – Licence DG6 

 
Sherwood Sandstone Group 
The Sherwood sandstones consist of red-bed sediments, mainly pink to brown sandstones and 
siltstones with occasional brown mudstones. The basal unit consists of an approximately 25 metre 
thick pebble conglomerate, which unconformably overlies Carboniferous and older basement rocks. 
The Group is approximately 300 metres thick in the east, varying laterally and is interpreted to have 
been deposited in hot, continental conditions by fluviatile processes that encompass channel, 
overbank, floodlain and lacustrine environments. The occurrence of well-rounded sand grains and 
local large dune forests indicate an Aeolian influence on deposition. This group has been dated to the 
Triassic using scarce miospore assemblage, but may straddle the Permo-Triassic boundary. 
 

6.2.5 Late Cretaceous – Licence DG6 
 
The Ulster White Limestone Formation of the Late Cretaceous unconformably overlies the 
Sherwood Sandstone Group on the property, however other Mesozoic lithologies are exposed 
laterally. The Formation is comprised of 14 members composed of a coccolith-foraminiferal micrite 
with flint nodules. The full succession is not documented in a single locality, however individual 
members are recognizable at outcrops based on flint type, spacing of flint bands, and the 
characteristics of individual beds. The composite thickness of all of the members is approximately 
133 metres. 
 

6.2.6 Paleogene – Licence DG6 
 
The Donalds Hill Ignimbrite Formation is a silicic welded ash-flow tuff and is commonly less than 
one metre thick with a lateral extension of over 30 kilometres. This rhyolitic ignimbrite resulted from 
a substantial volcanic eruption and the base of the unit is often a thin clay with flints formed from 
eroding the underlying Ulster White Limestone. The ash has been strongly silicified from fluids 
percolating downwards through the overlying basalt. The Formation was dated from a low diversity 
assemblage of pteridophyte spores and bisaccate plant pollens. 
 
The upper Basalt Formation is part of the Antrim Lava Group, a series of volcanics associated with 
the North Atlantic Igneous Province. Extrusive material was deposited during the Paleocene when 
the "Icelandic Hotspot" induced widespread magmatism across Greenland and North-West Europe 
and overstepped the older units of the Antrim Lava Group onto Dalradian, Carboniferous and 
Mesozoic lithologies. The Antrim Lava Group is up to 346 metres thick, divided into a lower aphyric 
group and an upper olivine-phyric flow-banded group that are separated by a layer of grey bauxite.  
 

6.3 Mineralization 
 

6.3.1 The Curraghinalt Gold Deposit 
 
High-grade gold mineralization occurs as a series of west-northwest trending, moderately to steeply 
dipping, subparallel stacked veins and arrays of narrow extension veinlets. These veins are hosted by 
the Neoproterozoic Dalradian rocks in the central section of the Sperrin Mountains, and represents 
the largest known gold deposit in the United Kingdom. 
 
The mineral resource model discussed herein focusses on a set of 21 prominent gold-bearing quartz 
veins that occur mainly within psammites, semi-pelites, and pelites of the Dalradian Argyll Group, 
within the Mullaghcarn Formation. Auriferous quartz veins exist between the main modelled veins,

but their continuity is difficult to demonstrate at the current drill spacing. The quartz vein system was 
investigated by core drilling and is partly exposed in underground workings. Surface exposures of 
the vein system are limited to the Curraghinalt and Attagh Burns (creeks), as well as a variety of 
surface trenching excavations completed in 2003 and in the late 1980s. The veins range from a few 
centimetres to five metres wide.  
 
The vein swarm has been modelled along strike for approximately 2,300 metres, across strike for 
approximately 800 metres and down dip for over 1,200 metres by prospecting, trenching, and 
drilling. Though the modelled veins extend 2,300 metres along strike, the vein system is traceable 
with similar strike aligned veins occurring over approximately four kilometres from Alwories in the 
east to Scotchtown in the west. The vein system remains open along strike and at depth. On average, 
the quartz veins dip between 50 degrees and 75 degrees to the north northeast. The modelled veins 
are listed in Table 9 and shown in Figure 9.

In 2012, Miron Berezowski, recognized two main vein sets: 
 

• Shear (D) veins - west-northwest trending, steeply dipping  
• Extensional (C) veinlets - arrays of narrow extension veinlets 

 
Single or multiple D veins form vein zones while vein complexes are anchored by a vein zone and 
are flanked by C vein arrays. 
 
The D or shear veins are thought to be hosted in west northwest trending shear zones dipping 
moderately to steeply to the northeast and with good strike continuity. D veins are often laminated 
and include slivers of wall rock, evidence of incremental development. Additionally, D veins can be 
brecciated. Examples of D veins exposed in underground workings are shown in Figure 10.

A. Exposed No. 1 vein at east end of drift. 
B. Pyrite overgrowing lamination in a vein in main crosscut. 
C. Extensional growth in quartz and pyrite on 10616 vein 
 
The C veinlets are southeast trending, steeply dipping extension veins which are oriented obliquely 
to the D veins. They show evidence of open space filling, are never brecciated, and do not have 
sheared margins. 
 
The gold-bearing vein system in the Curraghinalt deposit is crosscut by several generations of 
structures with different characteristics and orientations. The two most prominent structures in the 
deposit are the Kiln and Crow shear zones. These shear zones are east-west trending, either south-

dipping or north-dipping. The Kiln shear shows evidence of brittle reactivation as indicated by the 
presence of gouge zones along the contact between the highly strained ductile rocks within the shear 
zone and the Dalradian metasedimentary wall rocks. The Kiln shear disrupts and displaces the vein 
zones (D veins) with observed oblique dextral-normal kinematics. 
 
Vein zones are entrained within the Kiln Shear and previous workers (Boland, 1997) have suggested 
that the shears have controlled vein emplacement or at least served to produce wider mineralized 
segments. 
 
In addition, other shear zones and faults  with gouge development crosscut the Curraghinalt deposit. 
These structures trend northeast and dip moderately northwest. Fault thicknesses and characteristics 
vary based on the country rock lithology. Faults and shear zones within the pelite, north of the No. 1 
vein, tend to be wider (typically 0.5 to1.0 metre wide), either crosscut or disrupt the pre-existing 
regional foliation in the pelite, and in some cases, have measurable offsets (e.g., four metre offset of 
the T17 vein).  
 
Limited information is available for the kinematics of the crosscutting fault systems. However, in 3D 
the Kiln shear zone is currently modelled to offset the auriferous vein system with a dextral strike-
separation. Underground mapping by Dalradian shows sinistral strike-separation of the vein system 
along northeast-trending faults, particularly where faults intersect the western section of veins (e.g., 
T17 west, eight metre offset by FZ_107). However, the Dalradian mapping also shows the dextral 
strike-separation of veins where faults intersect the eastern section of veins, for example the V75 
vein east is offset by three metres. This fault contains steep-plunging slickenlines, suggesting the 
movement direction was dominantly vertical. This is possibly related to dominantly normal 
movement creating sinistral or dextral separations given the dip of the faults.  
 
Petrographic work by Clarke (2004) has documented that the gold mineralization at Curraghinalt 
occurs in quartz-pyrite-carbonate veins and is associated with variable abundances of carbonate, 
chalcopyrite, and tennantite-tetrahedrite. Gold is commonly in the form of native gold and more 
rarely as electrum (>20 weight percent silver), and occurs primarily along fractures in pyrite, as 
inclusions in pyrite, and at pyrite grain contacts with carbonate and quartz. Most native gold grains 
are associated paragenetically with carbonate, chalcopyrite, tennantite-tetrahedrite, and telluride 
minerals infilling fractures in pyrite. The seven veins studied at the time have similar mineralogy. 
Native gold was observed in samples from all veins and grains range in size from 2 micrometres to 
150 micrometres. 
 

6.3.2 Tyrone Volcanic Group 
 
The Tyrone Volcanic Group hosts a number of other gold and gold plus base metal prospects, which 
are described in Section 9. Hollis et al. (2014) have identified stratigraphic horizons associated with 
rift-related magmatism, hydrothermal alteration, synvolcanic faults, and high-level subvolcanic 
intrusions, which are prospective for VMS mineralization. Hollis et al., (2014) suggest that the 
Tyrone Volcanic Group is broadly correlative with the Buchans-Robert's Arm Belt of 
Newfoundland, which is host to numerous VMS deposits.

7 Deposit Types 
 
Dalradian's Northern Ireland property has potential to host two distinct deposit types. Licences DG1, 
DG3,DG4, DG5 and DG 6 which includes the Curraghinalt gold deposits, has potential to host 
orogenic gold deposits. Licence DG2, underlain by the Tyrone Igneous Complex, has potential to 
host volcanic massive sulphide mineralization (VMS), as well as porphyry copper-gold, and iron-
gold exhalites (Hollis et al., 2014; Hollis et al., 2015; British Geological Survey, 2016). 
 

7.1 Orogenic Gold Deposits  
 
Rice et al. (2016) noted that the timing of gold mineralization at Curraghinalt (ca. 462.7 – 452.8 Ma) 
closely followed peak metamorphism associated with the Grampian event of the Caledonian 
Orogeny. It is temporally linked with an extensional setting following orogenic uplift and collapse. 
Rice et al. (2016) concluded that Curraghinalt is more likely an orogenic (rather than intrusion 
related) gold deposit. Thus an orogenic gold deposit model best describes the Curraghinalt vein 
system (Figure 11).

Commonly referred to as mesothermal gold deposits in the past, these orogenic ores were formed 
during compressional to transpressional deformation processes at convergent plate margins in 
accretionary and collisional orogens. In both types of orogen, hydrated marine sedimentary and 
volcanic rocks have been added to continental margins during tens to some 100 million years of 
collision. Subduction-related thermal events, episodically raising geothermal gradients within the 
hydrated accretionary sequences, initiate and drive long-distance hydrothermal fluid migration. The 
resulting gold-bearing quartz veins were emplaced over a unique depth range for hydrothermal ore 
deposits, with gold deposition from 15 – 20 kilometres to the near surface environment. On the basis 
of their depth of formation, the orogenic deposits are best subdivided into epizonal (<6 kilometres), 
mesozonal (6 – 12 kilometres) and hypozonal (>12 kilometres) classes (Groves at al., 1998).  
 
The following has been summarized from Tomkins (2013b). 
 
Orogenic gold deposits dominantly form in metamorphic rocks in the mid- to shallow crust (5 
– 15 kilometres depth), at or above the brittle-ductile transition, in compressional settings that 
facilitate transfer of hot gold-bearing fluids from deeper levels (Goldfarb et al., 2005; Groves et al., 
1998; Phillips and Powell, 2009). The term orogenic is used because these deposits likely form in 
accretionary and collisional orogens (Groves et al., 1998). There are two plausible sources for the 
gold: (1) metamorphic rocks, from which fluids are generated as temperatures increase; and (2) 
felsic-intermediate magmas, which release fluids as they crystallize. Gold-bearing magmatic-
hydrothermal deposits are enriched in many elements, including sulphur, copper, molybdenum, 
antimony, bismuth, tungsten, lead, zinc, tellurium, mercury, arsenic, and silver (e.g., Goldfarb et al., 
2005; Richards, 2009). Such deposits have been referred to as gold-plus deposits (e.g., Phillips, 
2013), but most orogenic gold deposits fall into the alternative group of gold-only deposits. These 
are characterized by elevated sulphur and arsenic, and have only minor enrichments in the other 
elements. 
 
The vast majority of orogenic gold occurred in three periods in geologic time: the Neoarchean 
(ca. 2700-2400 Ma), the Paleoproterozoic (ca. 2100-1800 Ma), and a third period from ca. 650 Ma 
continuing throughout the Phanerozoic (Goldfarb et al., 2001).  
 
World-class gold deposits are generally two to ten kilometres long, approximately one kilometres 
wide, and are mined down-dip to depths of two to three kilometres. Most orogenic gold deposits 
contain two percent to five percent sulphide minerals and have gold/silver ratios from five to ten. 
Arsenopyrite and pyrite are the dominant sulphide minerals, whereas pyrrhotite is more important in 
higher temperature ores and base metals are not highly anomalous. 
 

7.2 Volcanic Massive Sulphide Deposit Model 
 
The volcanic stratigraphy of the Tyrone underlying licence DG2 is a potential host to volcanic 
massive sulphide deposits. VMS deposits are syngenetic, stratabound, and in part stratiform 
accumulations of massive to semi-massive sulphide that form seafloor hydrothermal systems at or 
near the seafloor (Gibson et al., 2007; Galley et al., 2007). The deposits consist of two parts: a 
concordant massive sulphide lens (>60 percent sulphide minerals), and discordant vein-type sulphide 
mineralization, commonly called the stringer or stockwork zone, located within an envelope of 
altered footwall volcanic and or sedimentary rocks (Gibson et al., 2007).

Recently, VMS deposits have been classified by host lithologies that define a distinctive time-
stratigraphic event (Barrie and Hannington, 1999; Franklin et al., 2005). These five different groups 
are: 
 

• Bimodal-mafic dominated volcanic – Cu-rich 
• Mafic back-arc (ophiolite associated) – Cu-rich 
• Pelitic mafic back-arc 
• Bimodal felsic-dominated volcanic – Zn-rich 
• Siliciclastic – felsic  

 
The order of the lithologic groups above reflects a change from the most primitive volcanogenic 
massive sulphide environments, represented by ophiolite settings, through oceanic-rifted arc, evolved 
rifted arcs, continental back-arc, to sedimented back-arc. Hollis et al. (2014) have identified the 
Lower Tyrone Volcanic Group as having formed in a bimodal-mafic arc to back-arc, and the Upper 
Tyrone Volcanic Group as having characteristics of the bimodal-felsic model (Figure 12).  
 
Gold-rich VMS deposits are viewed as a subtype where the gold content exceeds the associated 
combined copper, lead, and zinc grades.

8 Exploration 
 
Information for the period 2010 to 2014 has been extracted largely from the 2014 technical report by 
Micon (2014). 
 
Since 2010, Dalradian has drilled 459 boreholes (146,910 metres) on the Curraghinalt gold deposit, 
and 47 boreholes (12,987 metres) on other regional targets. In addition, airborne and ground 
geophysical surveys, prospecting, mapping, and geochemical surveys have been completed. Drilling 
is discussed in Section 9. 
 

8.1 Exploration 2010 – 2011 
 
In 2011, Dalradian commissioned Patterson, Grant and Watson Limited (PGW) of Toronto, Ontario 
to reprocess available geophysical data acquired previously during the government-funded Tellus 
survey (Figure 13).  
 
All available historical ground induced polarization, magnetic, very low frequency electromagnetic, 
and resistivity data were also reprocessed over the four licence areas (DG1, DG2, DG3, DG4). Based 
on this work, 23 exploration targets within the four licences were identified. Dalradian evaluated 
these targets based on published geology and a more detailed data compilation. Following this initial 
work, Dalradian carried out prospecting work on all four licences in the first and second quarters of 
2011.  
 
A total of 929 samples were collected, 143 of which yielded assays results greater than 0.25 grams of 
gold per tonne (g/t gold). A summary of the samples is provided in Table 10. The locations of the 
prospecting samples are shown in Figure 14. 
 
After the initial prospecting campaign, Dalradian integrated and evaluated existing exploration data 
and newly acquired information, and selected 19 of the initial 23 exploration targets for detailed 
exploration work, including core drilling. The targets can be split into two distinct groups: those 
within the Tyrone Volcanic Group on licence DG2, and those within the Dalradian Supergroup in 
licence areas DG1, DG3, DG4, DG5, and DG6.  
 
The Tyrone Volcanic Group is an environment favourable for the formation of VMS deposits and 
contains an abundance of float with VMS-style mineralization. Gold and base metal mineralization is 
most prevalent within the upper part of the volcanic sequence. Historical prospecting results include 
siliceous tuffs yielding 16.1 percent lead and 1.5 g/t gold, as well as chloritic tuffs yielding 8.8 
percent zinc, 1.2 percent lead, and 1.7 g/t gold.

A summary of exploration targets is shown in Table 11 and Table 12 for targets in the Tyrone 
Volcanic Group and the Dalradian Supergroup, respectively. 
 
Following target identification, Dalradian started a regional scout drilling program. Two boreholes 
were completed at target Broughderg, and one borehole was completed at target Tullybrick. 
However, no significant mineralization was intersected in any of these boreholes and in late 2011, 
Dalradian suspended the scout-drilling program in order to gather additional geological information 
to better define drilling targets.

8.2 Exploration 2012 – 2013 

 
In April 2012, Dalradian commissioned Geotech Ltd. (Geotech) of Aurora, Ontario, Canada to carry 
out a helicopter-borne versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) and magnetic survey. The 
survey consisted of 1,009 survey line-kilometres in three separate survey blocks approximately 20 
kilometres northeast, 17 kilometres northeast, and 14 kilometres northeast of Omagh (Figure 13). 
Survey lines in the northernmost survey block were flown in a northwest to southeast direction with 
survey lines spaced 100 metres apart. Three tie lines were flown perpendicular to the principal 
survey direction at a line spacing of 1,000 metres. The central survey block, which covers 
approximately 10 kilometres along the Curraghinalt trend, was flown at a 50-metre line spacing in a 
north-easterly direction (30 degrees) with perpendicular tie lines flown at a 500-metre line spacing. 
The survey lines in the south block were flown in a north-south direction with a line spacing of 100 
metres; tie lines were flown perpendicular with a spacing of 1,000 metres. Terrain clearances were 
43 and 69 metres for the electromagnetic and magnetic sensors, respectively. 
 
The airborne survey was unable to detect conductive horizons caused by the sulphide bearing veins 
that host the gold mineralization at Curraghinalt. However, the conductivity, apparent resistivity, and 
magnetic signatures were able to resolve stratigraphic subdivisions and contacts.  
 
In addition to the airborne geophysical survey, Dalradian initiated a detailed soil geochemistry 
survey on licence DG1 to extend the existing geochemistry grid (Figure 15). A gold-in-soil anomaly 
was interpreted in the Alwories area (Anomaly A on Figure 15), and was followed up with drilling in 
the summer of 2012.

A second soil survey was initiated in the Fallagh area in late 2012 (Figure 15). Based on encouraging 
gold-in-soil results, Dalradian completed trench 13-FA-T01. Although bedrock mineralization was 
not intersected, a sample of quartz-carbonate vein in the till within the trench yielded 14.65 g/t gold; 
a float sample discovered near the trench returned 91.5 g/t gold.  
 
Prospecting was carried out concurrently with the soil survey on licence DG1, and as a separate 
campaign on the other three licences. On DG1, 185 samples were collected, with 63 of them yielding 
results above 1 g/t gold. On licence DG3, a total of 313 bedrock and float samples were collected, 
and a total of 30 samples returned results in excess of 0.5 g/t gold. The most anomalous results were 
returned from the known prospects of Bessy Bell, Pollan Burn/Gortin Glen, and Rylagh/Erganagh. 
On DG4, a total of 168 bedrock and float samples were collected, but only three samples returned 
results in excess of 0.5 g/t gold.  
 
In the Glenlark area, 52 panned concentrate samples were collected, following-up on three boreholes 
completed in the area.  
 

8.3 Exploration 2014 – 2018 
 
Between 2014 and 2018, Dalradian continued to explore across the entire tenement, but focused 
most work on the Curraghinalt deposit area. Table 13 summarizes the exploration work completed in 
this time frame. The location of prospecting, soil, and stream samples are shown in Figure 14.

and follow-up duplicate samples returned assays of 168.0 g/t gold and 42.4 g/t gold from selective 
grab samples. A program of deep overburden sampling was completed in early 2016, yielding a 
multi-element anomaly adjacent to outcropping veins in a stream section. 
 

8.3.1 Underground Development Program 
 
Throughout 2015 and 2016, Dalradian completed approximately 989 metres of underground 
development, increasing the total development on the project to 1,785 metres with the Ennex 
tunneling work completed in the 1980s, including drifts, crosscuts, raises, drilling chambers, and 
safety bays. The development work was conducted largely via single-boom vein-runner jumbo drill, 
and via jack-leg stoper for the raising. An existing 1.8-metre wide and 59-metre long inclined 
borehole was converted to an exhaust raise and fitted with an Alimak conveyance that served as a 
secondary egress and means of conveying materials. At the top of the borehole a 30kW fan was 
installed, as were several small buildings for the storage of blasting materials. 
 
In addition to new development, Dalradian completed the mapping of all remaining historical 
underground workings at either 1:250-scale or 1:500-scale, with emphasis on structural geology, 
vein characterization and morphology, alteration, and lithology. New development was mapped at 
1:250-scale or 1:100-scale on advance during production. Subsequent detailed back-mapping along 
vein drives was undertaken after their completion and return of assays.  
 
Dalradian sampled 230 faces for a total of 878 face samples between August 2, 2015 to July 6, 2016. 
As of October 31, 2016, channel samples collected totalled 1,297. Sludge samples of percussion 
boreholes were also taken in several localities underground, totalling 70 samples. Blasted rock (muck 
samples) totalled 1,224 as of November 8, 2016. 
 

8.3.2 Petrographic Study  
 
A total of 24 rock samples were submitted to Vancouver Petrographics Limited (VPL) for 
petrographic analysis in 2017. A mixture of lithologies and veins from both hand specimen and drill 
core were provided. No geological information or context for the samples were provided to VPL, 
however they were supplied with ICP multi-element assay data to assist in mineralogical 
determination.  
  
Two of the samples were taken from a one-metre wide intrusion intersected deep into the footwall of 
the Curraghinalt vein package, and these were determined to be an olivine-phyric 
basalt/microdiorite. Four samples from gold-bearing quartz-pyrite-calcite-chalcopyrite veins were 
examined, in addition to five samples representing the alteration associated with the gold-bearing 
veins. Nine examples of the host rock lithologies were analysed, representing semi-pelites, 
psammites and various units between these two end-members.  
 
Two samples of a unit encountered adjacent to T17 vein underground, previously logged as a meta-
conglomerate, psammite or a quartz-rich semi-pelite, were determined to be a quartz-albite-white 
mica gneiss. However, Dalradian believe that the metamorphic grade seen in the area is not 
considered high enough for gneiss formation, and thus is more appropriately classified as quartz-
albite-white mica schist. Two hand specimens from a mineralized fault and vein located beyond the 
main Curraghinalt deposit were included to determine their mineralogy.

9 Drilling 
 
Historical drilling on the Northern Ireland property dates back to the 1970s and was carried out in a 
number of campaigns until 2008. Most of the historical drilling was at the Curraghinalt deposit, 
including a number of underground boreholes completed while the Ennex adit was being excavated 
(Figure 16). Celtic Gold completed some drilling at the Golan Burn prospect. The remainder of the 
historical drilling targeted other prospects on areas of current licences DG1 and DG2.

Core drilling of surface boreholes at Curraghinalt was primarily completed with HQ-size core (63.5 
millimetres) with a small number of older surface boreholes drilled with BQ-size core (36.4 
millimetres), representing less than 3 percent of the surface boreholes. Occasionally HQ-sized 
boreholes were reduced to NQ (47.6 millimetres) at depth. Most of the core from former operators is 
stored at Dalradian's core facility in Omagh, Northern Ireland, including the Celtic Gold core from 
Golan Burn. Dalradian completed significant additional core drilling from 2010 to 2018. 
 

9.1 Drilling by Riofinex (1970s) 
 
From 1973 to 1974, Riofinex Ltd. completed seven boreholes (920 metres) on a base metal target in 
the Cashel Rock area in current licence area DG2. None of the boreholes intersected significant 
mineralization.  
 
No information exists regarding the drilling procedures or the sampling methods and approaches 
employed by Riofinex. 
 

9.2 Drilling by Celtic Gold (1987) 
 
Celtic Gold completed 55 core boreholes (3,717 metres) on the Golan Burn prospect that straddles 
the licence boundary between current licences DG1 and DG3. An additional 69 short, reverse 
circulation boreholes are mentioned by Micon (2014) but could not be verified by SRK. Salient 
results from the core drilling include: 6.84 grams gold per tonne (g/t gold) in borehole DG-14, 9.3 g/t 
gold over 0.4 metres in borehole DG-18, and 61.4 g/t gold over 0.6 metres in borehole DG-41. These 
boreholes were drilled outside the Curraghinalt gold deposit area.  
 
No information exists regarding the drilling procedures or the sampling methods and approaches 
employed by Celtic Gold. 
 

9.3 Drilling by Ennex (1984 – 1999) 
 
Ennex in a joint venture with Ulster Base Metals completed two drilling programs at Curraghinalt. 
The first phase, between 1985 and 1989, included surface and underground core boreholes. The 
second phase, between 1995 and 1997, consisted of surface core boreholes. In total, Ennex 
completed 187 core boreholes (17,991 metres) from surface and 26 core boreholes (659 metres) from 
underground. 
 
Ennex completed eight core boreholes (441 metres) in the Glenlark area in licence DG1 north of the 
Curraghinalt deposit area. Notable intersections from borehole DDH 90-200 include 2.09 g/t gold 
and 3.7 g/t silver over 1.93 metres, as well as 8.19 g/t gold, 14.8 g/t silver. And 1.11 percent lead 
plus zinc over 0.75 metres (CSA, 1987). 
 
In addition, Ennex completed 21 core boreholes (1,348 metres) in the Cashel Rock area on the DG2 
licence. A small number of thick very low anomalous gold zones were intersected (up to 145 metres 
grading 0.4 g/t gold), with some shorter, higher grade core length intervals, including 4.3 g/t gold 
over 5.45 metres, 1.3 g/t gold over 6.9 metres, and 30.6 g/t gold over 3.63 metres. In addition, Ennex 
completed 14 reconnaissance core boreholes in the Tyrone Volcanic Group rocks, including four at 
each Formil (324 metres) and Cashel Bridge (249 metres), six at Aghascrebagh-Crouk (442 metres), 
and six other (258 metres).

Drilling procedures used by Ennex remain undocumented. After completion of boreholes, collars 
were cemented. During the 1980s, collar surveys were conducted by measuring the distance from a 
known baseline. Collars of boreholes completed in the 1990s were surveyed using a total station 
and/or GPS receivers. Surveys were conducted by John Barnett and Associates Ltd. and Land Survey 
Services in the 1980s and 1990s, respectively. 
 

9.3.1 Underground Sampling by Ennex (1987 – 1989) 
 
During the original development of the Curraghinalt adit from 1987 to 1989, Ennex completed an 
underground sampling program, including back, face, wall, and muck samples along the length of 
the Sheep Dip, T17, and No.1 drifts. The current database contains 310 historical Ennex 
underground channels (485 metres) for a total of 910 samples. Individual sample lengths vary 
between 0.04 and 1.52 metres, with an average length of 0.52 metre. 
 
Face samples were taken daily, or very regularly, and have accompanying face maps that show rough 
sketches of vein and mineralization position, along with indications of structure and lithology. The 
maps are not to scale, and they lack structure measurements and channel location on the face.  
 
Back channel samples were taken along the back of the Sheep Dip, T17, and No.1 drifts. Back 
sampling was done after face and muck sampling, in between existing channels to achieve a 
maximum distance of one metre between channels.  
 
Wall samples were taken in place of back samples, where the ground was less competent, or where 
the main vein was present only along the wall. A series of muck samples were also taken during drift 
development, with one muck sample taken per eight trams of rock mucked from each heading.  
  
Information about channel sampling can be found plotted on historical maps, as well as documented 
in monthly reports and on individual face map sheets for the No.1, T17, and Sheep Dip drifts. 
Channel sample information was digitally compiled in 1999 in Techbase software, along with all 
other historical assay information. Techbase exports were used initially to populate the main 
database at the time.  
 
Historical underground sampling was reviewed and verified in 2014 by Dalradian staff. 
 

9.4 Drilling by Nickelodeon (1999) 
 
Nickelodeon did not complete any drilling on the project area, but carried out additional sampling on 
existing core.  
 
No information exists regarding the sampling methods and approaches employed by Nickelodeon for 
sampling of historical core. 
 

9.5 Drilling by Tournigan (2003 – 2008) 
 
Tournigan completed 59 core boreholes (12,565 metres) between 2003 and 2008. Tournigan 
contracted Irish Drilling Limited (Irish Drilling) based in Loughrea, County Galway to perform all 
drilling on the project. Drilling equipment consisted of Boyles Brothers 37, mounted on a Go-Tract 
1000. The majority of the drilling was carried out using HQ-size equipment. NQ-sized equipment 
was used in difficult drilling situations where HQ-sized casing was required. Each drill site was 
located with a GPS receiver, staked, and then photographed prior to moving the drill rig onto the site. 
Down-hole surveys were completed on all boreholes using an Encore Reflexit smart multi-shot tool

instrument at the bottom of the borehole and every 6 metres to the casing. Tully (2005) reports that a 
Tropari survey instrument was used for the first four boreholes in the Tournigan program. On 
completion of a borehole, Celtic Surveys Ltd. surveyed the collar using the Irish National Grid to the 
nearest centimetre. All sites were cleared on completion and re-photographed.  
 
Core was delivered daily from the drill site to the core shed by Irish Drilling and placed sequentially 
on trestles. A geologist checked all the core markers, measuring between them to identify any lost 
core and potential tags. Core was orientated and logged on 1:100 purpose-designed logging sheets. 
Logging information included lithologies, structure, alteration, rock quality designation (RQD), 
mineralization, and any other observations deemed important. Core recovery varied from 90 percent 
to 97 percent except in pelitic units and fault zones. Based on recommendation made by Micon in the 
summer of 2007, Tournigan started to photograph vein intersections as part of the routine logging 
procedures. 
 
Once core was logged, vein material was sampled. According to Tully (2005), all quartz vein 
material within known vein systems was sampled. Vein material with high sulphide or breccia 
content was usually sampled separately. Sample lengths varied from 0.25 to 0.5 metres in primary 
veins, and 5 to 15 centimetres in undefined smaller adjacent veins. In addition to vein material, 
Tournigan took additional samples from wall rock adjacent to sampled vein material. 
 

9.6 Drilling by Dalradian (2010 – 2018) 
 
Since acquiring the project in 2010, Dalradian has completed 459 core boreholes (146,910 metres) 
from surface and underground stations in the Curraghinalt deposit area (Figure 16). In addition, 
Dalradian completed 47 core boreholes (12,987 metres) on regional targets elsewhere on the 
property (Table 14).  
 
Drilling was carried out by Irish Drilling until 2012, when Dalradian commissioned Major Drilling 
Group International Inc. (Major) to perform drilling tasks. In October 2015, Dalradian signed an 
additional contract for drilling operations with Mason & St John Ltd. (Mason). In December 2015, 
two more drills were mobilised to site by Priority Drilling (Priority). Underground drilling was 
completed in January 2016, and the surface drilling was completed in February 2016. A short 
underground drilling program was completed between March and April 2016 for stope definition. 
Underground drilling resumed in January 2017 and continued until March 2018 with two rigs from 
Priority and two rigs from Major. Surface drilling contributing to the resource update at Curraghinalt 
resumed in June 2017 and was completed in March 2018 with three Major drills and two Priority 
drills.

Similar to procedures used by Tournigan, surface drilling primarily used HQ-sized equipment. NQ-
sized equipment was used where ground conditions required a reduction in core size. Since April 
2015, Dalradian has used an ACT 2 tool for oriented core. Starting in October 2015, all surface 
drilling was completed using triple tube equipment. The vast majority of boreholes are drilled 
towards the south or the south-southwest in order to intercept the generally north-northeasterly 
dipping gold mineralized veins.  
 
Collar locations were identified using hand-held GPS receivers prior to drilling; drills were oriented 
using a compass. Prior to 2015, all collars were independently surveyed once drilling was completed. 
From 2015 all collars were surveyed by Dalradian surveyors using a total station and from April 
2017 all surface collars were surveyed with a Leica GPS. Down-hole surveys were carried out by 
drill operators during active drilling using a single shot Reflex EZ-Trac instrument. The boreholes 
were subsequently resurveyed upon completion using a Reflex multi-shot tool with readings taken 
every 6 metres.  
 
Underground drilling utilized NQ-size equipment until October 2015, when Dalradian switched to 
triple tube NQ3 equipment. Front-sights and back-sights were installed by the underground 
surveyors for reference by drill crews on set-up via string line. Borehole specifications were +/- 3 
degrees on azimuth and +/- 2 degrees on dip. In cases where a borehole was not within the design 
parameters, the borehole in question would be re-collared. Completed underground boreholes were 
labeled by the drillers with a wooden wedge and aluminum tag. Upon completion of drilling at a 
station, Dalradian underground surveyors surveyed the borehole collar locations and calculated the 
collar azimuth and dip of the borehole by surveying two prisms mounted in a steel pipe partly 
inserted into the borehole. 
 
Until 2011, core was brought from drill sites to the core logging facility located in Gortin at the end 
of each day, where core was logged by the Geologists and stored in Gortin. In 2011 Dalradian's core 
logging and storage facilities moved to Omagh, approximately 15 kilometres from Gortin. Since 
then, core is securely stored overnight in Gortin before being transported to Omagh where logging 
and sampling as well as final storage occurs. Underground core is transported directly to the Omagh 
facilities. 
 
Core logging procedures have been updated from time to time to improve certain aspects of the 
procedures. Logging was carried out by geologists assigned to the project by Aurum Exploration 
Services until July 2011, and subsequently by Dalradian staff. 
 
Tournigan initiated photography of all vein material in August 2007. Presently, Dalradian 
photographs all core, and the photographic record, along with a digital copy of the striplog and 
backup of recorded data are stored in a separate file for each borehole. A historical re-photographing 
program was initiated in conjunction with the historical core evaluation project (HCEP) and was 
completed at the end of 2016. 
 
Until 2012, Dalradian's sampling approach was as follows. All sulphide-bearing quartz vein material 
intersected by drilling was sampled. A geologist selected core sample intervals with a length between 
0.1 and 0.3 metres. The 0.3-metre sample length was selected so that an entire sample could be 
pulverized at the laboratory, eliminating the need to split the crushed sample. Samples in 
unmineralized wall rock had lengths of up to 1.0 metre. Sample intervals honored geological 
contacts, including mineralization styles. 
 
Sample intervals were marked on the core as well as on core boxes. Core was sawn lengthwise for 
sampling. Preprinted sample tags were used; one part of the tag was stapled to the core box, while

another was placed with the half-core sample in a numbered sample bag. Brief mineralogical 
descriptions of individual samples were added to the sample tags. The second half of the sawn core 
remained in the core box for reference. Sample numbers were verified at the end of a shift and 
individual sample bags were placed in large, pre-addressed plastic bags for shipment. The large bags 
were sealed with cable ties.  
 
All core was brought from the drills at the end of shift, and was stored in a rented lockable storage 
facility on the main street of Gortin, across the road from the field office. Until November 2011, core 
was sawn at a nearby farm, and core boxes with unmineralized core were stored in a concrete-floored 
barn at that location. Core boxes with mineralized core were returned to the industrial building where 
they were kept under lock and key. In November 2011, Dalradian leased a new office and core 
facility in nearby Omagh, where all logging, sampling, and storage took place. The Omagh facility is 
located in a secure fenced area. The core storage and logging facility is kept locked when 
unoccupied. Unshipped samples are also stored at this location. 
 
In September 2012, Dalradian revised their logging and sampling procedures. Prior to core logging, 
core was aligned such that the foliation trended from the upper left of the core boxes to the lower 
right. The core was washed and inspected for out-of-sequence core pieces. At this point, metre 
blocks added by the drill crew were verified. Every metre was marked on the core to aid in recovery 
assessment, RQD measurements, and logging. Sampling intervals (From and To) was marked on the 
core boxes. Sample tags for analytical quality control samples were added to the core boxes to 
preserve a continuous series of sample numbers.  
 
In February 2015, Dalradian revisited the sampling procedures again and made the following 
changes to account for oriented core. Core was placed in an angle iron and each piece locked 
together in order to achieve an accurate orientation of the core. An orientation line was drawn along 
the core with blue crayon to mark the bottom of the borehole, metre marks were drawn on the core, 
and the core was returned to the core box. The protocols for the selection of sampling intervals also 
changed: 
 

• D veins are sampled with a minimum sample length of 0.25 metre and a maximum length of 
0.50 metre. The sample length was adjusted to correlate with the 0.50-metre composite 
length used for geology and mineral resource modelling.  

• C veining and sericitic-chloritic altered shear intervals were sampled at intervals from 0.25 
to 1.0 metre.  

• Where a vein intersection is expected based on the geological model, but the core shows no 
veining, structures or alteration will be sampled at 0.5-metre intervals.  

• A minimum of two samples are taken before and after the selected sample interval, these 
samples are up to 1.0 metre in length.  

 
In April 2017, Dalradian revised the logging procedure to reflect input from geotechnical 
consultants. As part of the logging process boreholes were logged in to domains to reflect changes in 
lithology, alteration, mineralisation, structures and RQD. Domains were based on a minimum length 
of 0.25 metres, to correspond with the minimum sample length, and up to a maximum of 3 metres. 
The domains were marked on the core in white crayon indicating the depth, lithology and alteration. 
Once domained the core was logged and sampled to the previous protocol, although samples would 
not cross domain boundaries. This allowed geotechnical logging to be carried out over smaller, more 
appropriate intervals around vein zones.

9.6.1 Underground Core Sampling by Dalradian (2013 – 2018) 

 
Underground core was sealed with a lid at the drill rig and boxes were transported out of the adit and 
placed directly on the core delivery truck each day. Underground muck and chip samples were also 
placed on the core delivery truck by the geologist. The core truck was parked overnight at the secure 
local site, and all samples were transported the following morning to the Omagh logging facilities. 
Logging of core from underground drilling follows the same procedures applied to core from surface 
drilling. Underground chip and muck samples were labelled, packaged, and shipped similar to core 
samples. 
 

9.6.2 Sampling of Historical Core 
 
In 2013, Dalradian re-logged and re-sampled archived core of surface boreholes drilled in the central 
area of the deposit, 12,061 metres were re-logged and 12,790 samples were collected. As part of the 
resampling program, Dalradian also photographed the core.  
 
In 2015, Dalradian acquired the core from the boreholes drilled by Celtic Gold. These were 
transported to Omagh and re-logged, verified, and selectively sampled. An additional 292 samples 
were taken.  
 
In 2017 and 2018, Dalradian carried out additional sampling on 51 historic boreholes with 734 
samples taken in total to improve sampling coverage for the resource update. 
 

9.7 Underground Sampling by Dalradian (2013 – 2016) 
 
In 2013, Dalradian completed an initial underground channel sampling program. Sampling involved 
cutting a four-centimetre-wide channel along the wall of the main tunnel. The majority of the 
channels were cut on the western wall, except through the cross-cuts of the T17 and No.1 drifts 
where the channels were cut on the eastern wall. Cutting and sampling was not possible in certain 
limited zones due to support structures in place. In total, 450 individual samples were collected.  
 
Dalradian continued underground sampling in 2015 and 2016. Sampling was carried out in the 
underground development along veins during advance, across the full width of the face for each 
round (typically 3 metres in horizontal drifting and 1.8 metres in raising). After washing the active 
development face, the geology of the round was described in detail and mapped (at chest height) at 
1:250-scale. This mapping served as the basis for the sampling. Distinct geological and alteration 
zones were sampled separately via panel chip sampling. The locations of samples were measured 
using a laser rangefinder referencing a surveyed control point. 
 
Samples were collected by taking small chips on a regular grid with a rock hammer. Since samples 
were delineated by geological domains, no strict minimum horizontal thickness applied to the zone 
of interest. Maximum horizontal sampling width generally did not exceed one metre. 
 
The production geologist collected 4 to 5 kilograms of material per sample from the face, comprising 
chips of about 3 to 5 centimetres in diameter. Panel style sampling resulted in a composite of 
material confined to the sample zone, from approximately two thirds of the height of the face and, in 
the case of samples from the mineralized zone, in volumetric proportion based on relative abundance 
of mineralization versus gangue. Due to blasting, it was found that sulphide and quartz-carbonate 
gangue were equally fractured on the face, ensuring that neither material was over-sampled due to

SRK Team  Dalradian_Curraghinalt_2018_TR_3CD016002_JCS_DC_gc_ol_ah_20180620.docx June 22, 2018 

the ease or difficulty of collection. Sample collection along raising in the V75 stope block was made 
in the same way as described above, except that the east and west ribs were both sampled. 
 
Samples were placed in labelled bags along with sample tags, and secured with cable ties. The 
horizontal interval of the sample was recorded in a sample book and added to the database at the end 
of the day. Other information also recorded included the date and shift, heading and vein name, 
dimensions of the face and distance from a control point, vein thickness, and dip, estimate of face 
grade, drift azimuth, and sample descriptions. A digital, georeferenced photo was taken of the 
cleaned, sampled, painted face as evidence of what was sampled. 
 
In 2016, Dalradian completed an underground channel sampling program in existing developments 
which consisted of sill channels located at the same location as face samples collected during 
development drives. 110 channels were made (95 of which have a corresponding face sample pair). 
SRK reviewed the channel data by comparing the results to the face samples and the composited data 
informing the 2016 resource model. It was determined that the face samples show only a minor 
positive bias compared to channel samples, but are largely comparable. However, both the face and 
channel samples show a significant positive bias compared to drill composites used in the 2016 
resource model. The previous resource model vein wireframes were snapped to 0.5 metre fixed 
length composites, composited from borehole collar to toe, prior to modelling the veins. This study 
showed that compositing prior to domain definition introduced grade dilution to the 2016 resource 
model not present in underground sampling results. Consequently, the vein modelling methodology 
was revised and is described further in Section 13.3. 
 

9.8 SRK Comments 
 
The SRK qualified person reviewed the core logging and sampling procedures used by Dalradian 
and, as far as known, by previous operators. In the opinion of the qualified person, the core logging 
and sampling procedures used by Dalradian are consistent with generally accepted industry best 
practices and are, therefore, adequate for an advanced exploration project. Drilling, core logging and 
sampling procedures followed by previous operators are, in part, difficult to assess; however, after 
analysis of exploration data, qualified person considers that historical data are sufficiently reliable to 
inform geology and mineral resource models.

10 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security 
 
Exploration samples collected by Ennex, Tournigan, and Dalradian since 1984 were submitted to 
OMAC Laboratories Ltd. (OMAC Labs) in Loughrea, Ireland. Nickelodeon submitted samples to 
Chemex Labs Limited (Chemex) in Vancouver for sample preparation and analyses. Both facilities 
are independent, commercial geochemical laboratories that operated independently from the 
companies. No information exists regarding laboratories used by Riofinex and Celtic Gold. 
 
Tournigan used an unspecified laboratory operated by ALS Chemex in Canada for umpire testing of 
samples from core collected by Ennex.  
 
Dalradian used Geolabs Ltd. (Geolabs) in Birmingham, England for geotechnical testing of selected 
samples. Geolabs is accredited to ISO 17025:2005 by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, 
issue number 013 for tests used by Dalradian. 
 
OMAC Labs was acquired in July 2011 by the ALS group of laboratories, and is currently operating 
as ALS Loughrea (ALS), although OMAC Labs remains the official business name that appears on 
all assay certificates. Umpire testing of samples was conducted through Activation Laboratories Ltd. 
(Actlabs) in Ancaster, Canada. ALS and Actlabs are autonomous, commercial geochemical 
laboratories that operate independently of Dalradian Resources Inc.  
 
OMAC Labs and subsequently ALS Loughrea have been accredited to ISO/IEC 17025 for 
geochemical analyses by the Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB) since 2006 with 
Registration Number 173T, including those used by Dalradian. ALS Loughrea is a part of the ALS 
Group of laboratories that operates under a global quality management system accredited to ISO 
9001. Actlabs Ancaster is accredited to ISO/IEC 17025 for chemical analysis by the Standards 
Council of Canada (SCC) with registration Number 266, including those used by Dalradian.  
 

10.1 Riofinex (1970s) 
 
No information exists about sample preparation procedures, analytical techniques, and sample 
security employed by Riofinex in the 1970s. 
 

10.2 Celtic Gold (1987) 
 
No information exists about sample preparation procedures, analytical techniques, and sample 
security employed by Celtic Gold in 1987. 
 

10.3 Ennex (1984 – 1999) 
 
Sample preparation, analyses and security procedures for core samples taken by Ennex are poorly 
documented and are therefore difficult to review. SRK understands that samples were assayed for 
gold using a mix of wet assay methods and fire assay methods. For a large number of samples the 
assay method is undocumented. Sample sizes comprised 30- and 50-gram charges. The preparation 
techniques are undocumented; assaying techniques are only partly documented. Assay records are 
preserved on paper logs, and have been digitized by Dalradian.

10.4 Underground Sampling by Ennex (1987 – 1989) 

 
Sample preparation, analyses, and security procedures for underground chip samples taken by Ennex 
are undocumented. However, SRK considers that underground samples were treated the same way 
surface core samples were processed. 
 

10.5 Nickelodeon (1999) 
 
No information exists regarding sample preparation and analysis, or sample security for samples 
taken by Nickelodeon. 
 

10.6 Tournigan (2003 – 2008) 
 
Sample preparation and analytical procedures are described in Micon (2007). Samples were dried 
and crushed to less than 2 millimetres using a jaw crusher. The crushed samples was split using a 
riffle splitter, and a 1 kilogram subsample was pulverized to 100 micrometres. 
 
Gold was analyzed using a 50-gram sample by fire assay with an atomic absorption spectroscopy 
finish (Package AU4). Approximately 10 percent of all samples were subjected to repeat analysis 
using packages AU5 and AU1 comprising a 30-gram subsamples digested in a concentrated aqua 
regia solution, extracted with methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) and analyzed by atomic adsorption 
spectroscopy. A further 10 percent of this sample suite was re-analyzed using the same methodology. 
 

10.7 Dalradian (2010 – 2018) 
 
All samples were collected under the supervision of Dalradian staff, maintaining the chain of custody 
from the time of sampling through to receival at the primary laboratory. 
 
Sample preparation and analytical procedures used by Dalradian largely mirror those by Tournigan, 
with the exception of using almost exclusively 50-gram charges for fire assay analyses (ALS Lab 
code Au-AA26). Samples grading over 100 g/t gold were re-analyzed with a gravimetric finish (ALS 
Lab code Au-GRA22). Gold analyses by fire assay with gravimetric finish were conducted on 50-
gram charges to increase accuracy compared to analyses conducted on 30-gram charges.  
 
The excess material pulps of core and underground face/channel samples sent to ALS were returned 
to Dalradian and stored on site. A portion of these pulp samples selected randomly by Dalradian for 
repeat analysis (5.2 percent of the total samples) was sent to the umpire laboratory, Actlabs, for 
check assay testing. Check assay analysis was completed by fire assay using 50-gram subsamples 
and analyzed with an atomic adsorption spectroscopy finish (Actlabs code 1A2-50). Samples grading 
over 100 g/t gold were re-analyzed with a gravimetric finish (Actlabs code 1A3-50). 
 

10.8 Specific Gravity Data 
 
Specific gravity of various rock types and vein mineralization was measured by Tournigan and 
Dalradian using a standard weight in water/weight in air methodology on core from complete sample 
intervals. A total of 11,241 specific gravity measurements were provided to SRK on core intervals, 
including 3,013 located within the modelled shear veins. The average specific gravity within the 
shear veins is 2.81.

The average waste rock density of pelite, semi-pelite, and psammite combined, containing no shear 
veins is 2.75. 
 

10.9 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Programs 
 
Quality control measures are typically set in place to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the 
exploration data. These measures include written field procedures and independent verifications of 
aspects such as drilling, surveying, sampling and assaying, data management, and database integrity. 
Appropriate documentation of quality control measures and regular analysis of quality control data 
are important as a safeguard for project data and form the basis for the quality assurance program 
implemented during exploration.  
 
Analytical control measures typically involve internal and external laboratory control measures 
implemented to monitor the precision and accuracy of the sampling, preparation, and assaying 
process. They are also important to prevent sample mix-up and to monitor the voluntary or 
inadvertent contamination of samples.  
 
Assaying protocols typically involve regularly duplicating and replicating assays and inserting 
quality control samples to monitor the reliability of assaying results throughout the sampling and 
assaying process. Check assaying is normally performed as an additional test of the reliability of 
assaying results. It generally involves re-assaying a set number of sample rejects and pulps at a 
secondary umpire laboratory. 
 

10.9.1 Ennex (1984 – 1999) 
 
There is no evidence that Ennex used an analytical quality assurance and quality control program. 
 

10.9.2 Nickelodeon (1999) 
 
Nickelodeon did not institute an analytical quality assurance and quality control program for its 
resampling program of historical Ennex core. 
 

10.9.3 Tournigan (2003 – 2008) 
 
Tournigan instituted an analytical quality assurance and quality control program for core samples 
involving the use of blanks and certified reference material samples. Tournigan further relied on pulp 
duplicate testing carried out as part of the internal laboratory quality control program routinely 
maintained by OMAC labs to monitor analytical results on an ongoing basis. Tournigan's analytical 
quality control program is described by Micon (2007). 
 
Commercial certified reference material (over a range of gold grades) were sourced from CDN 
Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Langley, BC (CDN-GS-XX) and Rocklabs Limited (Rocklabs) of 
Auckland, New Zealand. Use of reference material from Rocklabs was limited to two occurrences in 
the database reviewed by SRK. The specifications of the control samples used by Tournigan are 
summarized in Table 15. According to Micon (2007), blank material was sourced from limestone 
from the Irish Midlands, near Lisheen. The insertion rate of standard reference material and blank 
samples was approximately one in 10 samples.

According to Micon (2007), results from analytical quality control samples were monitored on an 
ongoing basis to ensure reliability of analytical results delivered by the primary laboratories used. 
SRK was unable to determine performance gates implemented by Tournigan that determined when 
certain assay batches were sent for re-assay based on the performance of analytical quality control 
samples submitted with the regular assay stream. 
 
In addition to analytical quality control procedures implemented on samples collected by Tournigan, 
Tournigan submitted 43 samples from historical core drilled by Ennex for umpire assaying to 
OMAC labs as well as to a laboratory operated by ALS Chemex at an unspecified location in 
Canada.  
 

10.9.4 Dalradian (2010 – 2018) 
 
Dalradian continued to apply the same analytical quality control procedures first introduced by 
Tournigan. During the first phase of underground channel sampling in 2013, Dalradian did not use 
analytical quality control samples. Chip sampling procedures in 2015 were adjusted to mirror the 
insertion rate of analytical quality control samples to that of core samples. 
  
During the first years of operation by Dalradian, the number of reference materials was high. More 
recently, Dalradian has reduced the number of reference material types to streamline the data 
analysis. Analytical quality control data considered for the May 2016 mineral resource model is 
discussed in an earlier technical report (SRK, 2016). 
 
Commercial certified reference material (over a range of gold grades) were sourced from Rocklabs. 
Dalradian has used a total of 14 reference material types between 2016 and 2018, summarized in 
Table 16. Blank material was sourced from limestone from a quarry in Fivemiletown, Northern 
Ireland. The insertion rate of blank and standard reference material was approximately one in ten.

10.10 SRK Comments 
 
The qualified person for the mineral resource in this study reviewed the sample handling and 
preparation procedures used by the independent certified laboratories contracted by Dalradian. In the 
opinion of qualified person, the sampling preparation, security, and analytical procedures used by 
Dalradian are consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, adequate 
for an advanced exploration project. Sample handling and preparation procedures followed by 
previous operators are, in part, difficult to assess. However, after analysis of exploration data, 
qualified person considers that historical data are sufficiently reliable to inform geology and mineral 
resource models, especially considering that drilling and undergound sampling data collected by 
Ennex, Nickelodeon, and Tournigan amount to approximately five percent of all available 
exploration data available for the Curraghinalt project.

11 Data Verification 
 
The verification and analysis of data provided to SRK from Dalradian between 1984 and March, 
2016 is described within the 2016 technical report and includes data produced by Ennex, 
Nickelodeon, Tournigan, and Dalradian. The conclusions from this analysis are summarized at the 
end of this section.  
 

11.1 Verifications by Dalradian 
 
For the verification of drilling data, Dalradian relies partly on verification processes built into 
DataShed and LogChief software used for logging core and storage of data. Possible data errors such 
as logging interval overlaps, end-of-hole values greater than the borehole length, missing 
information etc., are detected automatically and send error messages within the program. A manual 
override of information automatically added to the logging information by the software is possible.  
 
In late 2015, Dalradian commissioned ALS to investigate the performance of fire assays with atomic 
absorption finish using 30-gram aliquots versus 50-gram aliquots and the influence of coarse gold on 
the methods' performance using a screen fire assay methodology as verification. The study was 
conducted on 63 samples with a range of gold values from various locations within the deposit area. 
The results indicate that analyses conducted on 30-gram aliquots show, on average, lower gold 
values than those analyses conducted on 50-gram aliquots. Results from the latter sample size 
correlate well with assay results obtained from screen fire assays, suggesting that the occurrence of 
coarse gold has a direct impact on assay accuracy. Due to the results of this study, all gold assays 
from 2015 onwards have been conducted on 50-gram aliquots. 
 
As part of the analytical data verification, Dalradian submitted 1,066 sample pulps to Actlabs for 
umpire testing between 2016 and 2018. The samples cover a range of gold values and were assayed 
by fire assay with an atomic absorption finish (Actlabs method code 1A2-50 Au) on 50-gram 
aliquots. Samples grading over 100 g/t gold were re-analyzed with a gravimetric finish (Actlabs 
method code 1A3-50). The analysis of this testing is discussed below.  
 
In late 2017, Dalradian identified a potential minor bias with ALS-reported gold grades between 5 
and 15 g/t gold. Within this grade range, the umpire laboratory, Actlabs, reported values consistently 
below those of ALS, however, these were still within 10 percent difference. It is unclear whether the 
bias is related to ALS or Actlabs. In early 2018, Dalradian identified to ALS a high bias from 
medium to high grade certified reference material. ALS investigated the issues and has re-introduced 
a higher grade internal standard for calibration purposes, and has moved from manual hand shaking 
of dilutions to using an electric vortex mixer.  
 

11.2 Verifications by SRK 
 

11.2.1 Site Visits 
 
In accordance with National Instrument 43-101 guidelines, several members of the SRK team visited 
the Curraghinalt gold project to inspect the property, conduct field investigations of core and 
underground exposures, and hold discussions with Dalradian site personnel.

Most recently, Dr. James Siddorn and Mr. Dominic Chartier visited the project from October 22 to 
October 27, 2017, accompanied by Mr. Greg Hope and Ms. Emma Brosnan of Dalradian. The 
purpose of the Dr. Siddorn's site visit was to evaluate the structural controls on gold mineralization 
and review the distribution, geometry, and kinematics of post-mineralization structures that may 
crosscut or displace the gold domains. The purpose of Mr. Chartier's site visit was to review 
exploration procedures, review the exploration database and validation procedures, define geological 
modelling procedures, examine drill core and underground workings, compare database assays with 
original certificates, and collect all relevant information for the preparation of a revised mineral 
resource model and the compilation of a technical report.  
 

11.2.2 Database Verifications 
 
SRK conducted a series of routine verifications to ensure the reliability of the electronic data 
provided by Dalradian. These verifications included checking the digital data against original assay 
certificates, where possible. SRK audited approximately four percent of data generated by Dalradian 
and did not identify any errors.  
 

11.2.3 Verifications of Analytical Quality Control Data 
 
SRK analyzed the analytical quality control data produced by Dalradian from 2016 to 2018 drilling 
and underground sampling programs conducted since the May 5, 2016 mineral resource estimate. All 
data were provided to SRK in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets accompanied by original pdf lab 
certificates. SRK aggregated the assay results of the external analytical control samples for further 
analysis. Control samples (blanks and certified reference materials) were summarized on time series 
plots to highlight their performance. Paired data (preparation, pulp, umpire, and lab internal pulp 
duplicate assays) were analyzed using bias charts, quantile-quantile, and relative precision plots. A 
selection of the charted data is presented in Appendix A. The type of analytical quality control data 
collected, and their associated performances are discussed below and summarized in Table 17.

Analytical Quality Control Data by Dalradian (2016 – 2018) 
In general, analyses of blank samples consistently yielded gold values near or below the detection 
limit of the primary laboratory. The performance of blank samples between 2016 and 2018 is 
acceptable with no sample contamination detected and less than 0.5 percent returning values above 
10 times the detection limit.  
 
Dalradian used a total of 14 certified standard reference material types with a variable range of 
expected gold values (Table 16). Overall, the performance of these materials is acceptable with 
failure rates ranging from 1 to 23 percent, typically below 6 percent. Failure rates of over 10 percent 
were reviewed closely and determined to be marginal. Standard material exhibiting a failure rate 
higher than 10 percent often had a sample count lower than 50 due to recent adoption or discontinued 
use, and therefore the statistical performance of these material may be unevolved or undetermined. 
 
During December 7, 2017 to February 15, 2018, it was noted by Dalradian that assay results for 
standard SP59 were exhibiting an increased failure rate with a positive bias. Only one obvious outlier 
is attributed to the probable mislabelling of standard SN75. Dalradian discussed this issue with ALS 
and the performance of this standard is being monitored after corrective action was implemented.  
 
Approximately five percent of samples analyzed by ALS were chosen randomly by laboratory staff 
from additional pulp material and sent to Actlabs for repeat analysis. Rank half absolute relative 
difference (HARD) plots suggested that 81.8 percent of the umpire check assays conducted on pulps, 
had HARD below 10 percent, suggesting good reproducibility between two laboratories.  
 
Reproducibility of core assays from pulp material was satisfactory with a correlation coefficient of 
0.94. Reproducibility of assays of underground face/channel samples from pulp material was very 
good with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. The available dataset for this type of analytical quality 
control sample for underground face/channel samples was small with 159 sample pairs available for 
analysis between 2016 to 2018. However, pulp duplicate data for core samples acquired between 
2016 and 2018 had similarly good reproducibility with a larger data set of 907 sample pairs. Recent 
exploration data from underground face/channel samples are therefore comparable with those from 
recent core samples. 
 

11.3 SRK Comment 
 
The mineral resource qualified person carried out a detailed quality control review including the 
review of analytical quality control programs and their performance carried out by Ennex, 
Tournigan, and Dalradian between 1987 and 2018. The aim of this review was twofold: a) to verify 
the reliability of exploration data to be used in the resource update, and b) to identify whether 
historical data would impact the reliability of the exploration data as a whole.  
 
In the review of potential risk introduced by historical data, SRK identified the following issues: 
 

• Lack of analytical quality control data prior to 2000 
• High failure rate of blank samples during discrete periods 
• High failure rate of certain control samples used 

 
The sampling data collected by Dalradian (approximately 71,878 core samples) far outweigh 
historical sampling data collected by Ennex (1,551 core samples) and Tournigan (2,289 core 
samples) (Figure 17), significantly reducing the risk introduced by the use of historical data that may 
be less reliable because the associated sampling data are less well documented.

Figure 17: Distribution of Samples by Operator 
 
 
SRK carried out a detailed quality control review including the review of analytical quality control 
programs carried out by Dalradian from 2016 to 2018. The aim of this review was to verify the 
reliability of exploration data generated during this period to be used in the mineral resource update. 
This review is in addition to that conducted and discussed in the 2016 report. 
 
In the opinion of SRK, the paired data results are consistent with results expected for this type of 
gold mineralization. The umpire check assays show that the results produced by ALS can be 
reproduced within acceptable limits by Actlabs.  
 
In its review of quality control data, SRK identified a high failure rate for certain control samples 
used during discrete periods. Standards SP59 and HiSilP3 exhibited increased bias and variability 
over time. Dalradian was proactive in discussing failures with ALS and the use of both have been 
discontinued. This is consistent with previous actions taken by Dalradian, where the use of certain 
standard reference materials that exhibited higher failure rates (for example, Rocklabs SQ48 used 
between 2003 and 2008 with a failure rate of approximately 30 percent) were also discontinued. 
Continued diligence in monitoring quality control data is strongly encouraged. 
 
Based on previous project exposure and on SRK's most recent site visit completed during active 
drilling operations in October 2017, SRK believes that drilling, logging, core handling, core storage, 
and analytical quality control protocols used by Dalradian meet generally accepted industry best 
practices. In the opinion of SRK, the sampling preparation, security, and analytical procedures used

by Dalradian are consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, 
adequate for an advanced exploration project.  
 
Overall, SRK considers analytical results from core sampling conducted at Curraghinalt are globally 
sufficiently reliable for the purpose of resource estimation. The data examined by SRK do not 
present obvious evidence of analytical bias.

12 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 

12.1 Introduction 
 
The metallurgical test work carried out to support development of the Curraghinalt project and 
creates the basis of this section was summarized, managed and directed by Mr. Stacy Freudigmann 
P.Eng.  
 
As permitted by Item 3 of Form 43-101F1 – Technical Report, published by the Canadian Securities 
Administrators (Form 43-101F1), the Qualified Person (QP) responsible for the preparation of this 
Section has relied upon certain reports, opinions and statements of certain experts who are not 
qualified persons. These reports, opinions and statements, the makers of each such report, opinion or 
statement and the extent of reliance are described. 
 

12.2 Testing History 
 
In previous project development phases, testing was undertaken on composites blended from various 
veins and different areas of the deposits on the Curraghinalt property. More recent test work was 
carried out on flowsheet optimization composites, constructed to represent the resource as it was 
understood at the time, and also on variability composites, to determine the change in metallurgical 
response of individual samples selected to represent the grade, lithology and spatial aspects of the 
resource. Testing on the optimization composite was designed to develop the flotation-leach 
flowsheet. The resulting flowsheet, and more closely defined process variables, were then used to 
determine the metallurgical performance of a number of variability composites, evaluating both gold 
and silver recoveries.  
 
A number of testwork programs have been undertaken on the Curraghinalt Project since 1985, as 
illustrated in Table 18. 
 
Test work programs completed by independent reputable metallurgical laboratories using primarily 
drill core samples from exploration drilling, include but are not limited to characterization and 
mineralogical studies, comminution studies, gravity concentration tests, flotation, leach and settling 
tests. Historical test work results indicate that the mineralization responded well to flotation and to 
direct agitated cyanide leaching for precious metal extraction.

12.3 Mineralogical Evaluations 
 

12.3.1 Mineralogy  
 
Historically, mineralogical analysis were conducted by Lakefield Research on head samples, gravity 
concentrate samples, T17 and Sheepdip Vein Composites; by IME on high and low sulphide 
composites determining sulphur speciation; by SGS on both waste and vein samples; by ALS on 
composite and concentrate samples including, photomicrographs, BMAL and QEMSCAN work and 
recently by BaseMet undertaking mineral composition of the vein composites and recent stope and 
development composite materials.  
 
Mineralogical work indicates that gold mineralization at Curraghinalt occurs in quartz-pyrite veins 
and is associated with variable abundances of carbonate, chalcopyrite, and minor amounts of 
tennantite-tetrahedrite. In general, carbonate, chalcopyrite, and tennantite-tetrahedrite are 
paragenetically later than quartz and pyrite, and fill fractures in the latter. Gold occurs mainly as the 
native metal or more rarely as electrum (>20 wt% Ag) and is found primarily along fractures in 
pyrite, as inclusions in pyrite, and at pyrite grain contacts with carbonate and quartz. Most native 
gold grains are associated with carbonate, chalcopyrite, and minor amounts of tennantite-tetrahedrite,

and telluride minerals. Samples from numerous veins have been assessed and it has been observed 
that the mineralogy is generally similar in all the veins found at Curraghinalt. 
A sample of Master Composite (MC) 12-1A was ground to approximately 80% passing 106 µm and 
was submitted for BMAL and QEMSCAN analysis at ALS. The main points of interest are 
summarized below. 
 

• Pyrite was the dominant sulphide mineral observed measuring approximately 5.5 percent of 
the feed. Minor chalcopyrite was also observed, measuring about 1 percent.  

• The dominant minerals were quartz and muscovite, being approximately 51 percent and 25 
percent by weight of the feed, respectively. 

• The copper sulphides and pyrite were well liberated, being approximately 83 percent on 
average. About 16 percent of the copper sulphides were locked in binary with pyrite. The 
liberation data indicates that a primary grind coarser than 106 µm could be used in the 
rougher circuit of a flotation flowsheet. 

• Chalcopyrite accounted for the majority of the copper sulphide minerals in the feed. 
• Results from BaseMet mineralogy in 2015 on the vein composites indicated that the 

dominant copper-bearing mineral occurring in the vein composites was also chalcopyrite.  
 
Pyrrhotite was not identified in the samples analyzed by BaseMet, by ALS, nor was it identified in 
the SGS test work. Pyrrhotite was only identified in a single sample in the 1986 Lakefield Research 
test work. The level of organic carbon in the samples studied by ALS and Basemet was also found to 
be negligible. The dominant minerals observed by BaseMet were quartz and muscovite at 55 percent 
and 22 percent on average respectively and the pyrite averaged 5.1 percent, which aligns well with 
the previous ALS work.  
 
More recently in 2017, BaseMet undertook mineralogical analysis on composite samples derived 
from Test Stope and Underground Mine Development material. Again quartz and muscovite were 
the dominant minerals at 57% and 19% on average respectively. The "Feasibility Study Composite" 
(FSC), which was developed to represent process plant feed and was made up of a 83:17 mix of 
STOPE and DEVELOPMENT material and contained 18% muscovite. The flotation and detoxed 
leach tails contained 14% and 12% muscovite respectively, well below the 20% hazardous material 
guideline.  Minimizing waste rock and dilution in the plant feed would appear to reduce muscovite in 
the tailings. 
 
Although quartz was present in those flotation tailings samples at approximately 62 percent on 
average, there was only approximately 1 percent between 2 to 5 micrometres in size and no result 
less than 1 micrometre in size for the FSC, which would be representative of what would be fed to 
the process plant.

• At ALS, a rougher concentrate sample was submitted for mineral examination, illustrated in 

the photomicrograph below, and was generated from a rougher flotation on the Master 
Composite 12-1A ground to approximately 80 percent passing 141 micrometres. It can be 
observed in these images that, as previously observed in the mineralogical analysis, the gold 
particles in the rougher concentrate occur primarily along fractures in pyrite or as inclusions 
in pyrite.

12.4 Test Work 
 

12.4.1 Historical Metallurgical Testing 
 
Pre-2012 Metallurgical Test work 
The historical test work from 1985 to 1989 examined the amenability of the samples to gravity 
concentration. The gravity recovery of gold using a Wilfley table followed by cleaning on a Mozley 
concentrator varied from 26 percent to 52 percent. Test work undertaken in 1999 with a Knelson 
concentrator decreased the observed variability in the samples tested and ranged from 50 percent to 
52 percent gold. 
 
A Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BBWi) test completed by Lakefield Research in 1986 on a composite 
sample returned a value of 15.4 kilowatt hours per tonne (kWh/t). 
 
Historical cyanidation test work returned metal extractions typically averaging 95 percent for gold 
and approximately 80 percent for silver. A grind of approximately 85 percent passing 200 mesh (75 
micrometres) and a leach time of 48 hours at 1 gram per litre (g/L) sodium cyanide dose was found 
generally effective on whole-ore-leach (WOL). Sodium cyanide consumptions in direct cyanidation 
tests were variable but generally elevated between 1.0 – 2.4 kilograms per tonne (kg/t). Where 
solution assays were available, they showed increased copper and thiocyanate (CNS) concentrations, 
and it was concluded that copper sulphides were the most likely cause for the raised cyanide 
consumptions. 
 
SGS undertook test work in 2011 to investigate heavy liquid separation (HLS) as a means of 
reducing the amount of feed material reporting to process by rejecting the waste portion that would 
come from the mine as dilution. The tests indicated that, using this pre-treatment of the plant feed, it

was possible to reject up to 50 percent of the feed material into the waste stream; however, gold loss 
into the reject material was approximately 4 percent. As part of that test work program, SGS 
completed cyanide leach tests on samples of the rougher concentrate and rougher tailings from the 
sinks and float portions of the HMS test. Extractions for gold were approximately 90 percent on 
average, and indicated that there is likely a strong dependency on particle size, independent of 
grade). The sinks concentrate from the HMS test was also submitted for flotation testing. Gold and 
silver rougher recoveries were 99 percent and 95 percent, respectively (relative to the flotation feed), 
into 42 percent of the mass. This test work suggested that a relatively coarser grind is likely possible 
prior to flotation. The flotation results suggest that the gold occurrence is strongly associated with 
sulphides, which is consistent with the mineralogical observations. 
 
2012-2015 Metallurgical Test work 
A program of test work was carried out by ALS Metallurgy of Kamloops, BC on a representative 
composite sample. Laboratory testing was conducted using a gravity-flotation circuit, on samples 
ground to approximately 80 percent passing 140 micrometres prior to flotation, and produced a bulk 
rougher concentrate grading 82.8 g/t gold and 59 g/t silver.  
 
ALS completed a single BBWi test on composite sample 12-1B that returned a value of 15.2 kWh/t, 
which agreed with the historical test completed by Lakefield Research. ALS also completed a single 
Abrasion Index (Ai) on that composite that returned a value of 0.1278 g. 
 
Gravity concentration test work achieved 81 percent and 76 percent gold recovery into a concentrate 
of 6 percent and 5 percent mass pull for composites 12-1A and 12-1B, respectively. Additional 
testing achieved gold recoveries into the gravity concentrates of 61.5 percent and 67.9 percent with 
mass pulls of 3.1 percent and 3.4 percent, and 29.4 percent and 24.2 percent with mass pulls of 0.2 
percent. These results suggest a good correlation between mass pull and gold recovery into the 
gravity concentrate as illustrated in Figure 19.

The flotation testing by ALS focused on producing a rougher concentrate, both with and without a 
gravity circuit prior to flotation. Gold recoveries into the flotation concentrate without a gravity 
circuit were 98.8 percent to 99.4 percent (Composite 12-1A), and 94.7 percent to 95.3 percent

(Composite 12-1B), and 70.0 percent to 74.6 percent (Composite 12-1A) when a gravity circuit was 
used ahead of the flotation circuit. 
 
Overall gold recoveries from this test program were 99.4 percent, with 29.4 percent of the gold 
reporting to the gravity circuit, and 70.0 percent reporting to a bulk rougher concentrate, 
demonstrated a potential alternative processing method compared to the whole-ore cyanidation 
process used as the base-case scenario previously. Analysis of the flotation concentrate suggested a 
clean, saleable concentrate could be produced, with little to no significant penalty elements present. 
 
A number of other series of WOL and flotation tests were also undertaken with the main results 
summarized as follows: 
 

• Pre-aeration on the leaching process was demonstrated to not be required.  
• Lead Nitrate as an additive to the leaching process was also demonstrated to not be required, 

which would be expected with the almost non-existent presence of pyrrhotite as observed in 
the mineralogy.  

• The tests to determine the amount and effect of graphitic carbon in the mineralization 
demonstrated that there is only a minor trace amount present and that it is not deleterious to 
the flotation or leaching processes.  

• An initial grind size evaluation determined that for the composites tested a grind of 
approximately 80 percent passing 141-148 μm for WOL and approximately 80 percent 
passing 44 micrometre for the cyanide leaching of the flotation concentrate were optimal. 

• Increasing the cyanide concentration on the leach tests indicated an improvement in recovery 
could be achieved. 

 
The test work program undertaken at BaseMet in Kamloops, BC in 2015, assessed the metallurgical 
response of two main flow sheets: WOL, and bulk flotation followed by cyanidation of the flotation 
concentrate, on five vein composites (106-16, No.1, T17, Crow, and Sheep Dip) and a single master 
composite. Vein composite grades ranged from 5.4 – 11.2g/t gold and 4.2 – 9.6g/t silver with the 
master composite at 8.2 g/t gold and 4.6g/t silver, whilst copper was present in all the samples, at 
relatively low levels of around 0.1 percent. Carbon was measured at less than 0.5 percent and again, 
no preg-robbing effects were observed during cyanidation.  
 
The BBWi testing was conducted using a closing screen sizing of 212 micrometres, resulting in a 
product sizing averaging approximately 80 percent passing 169 micrometres. At this closing screen 
sizing, the five composites recorded work indices averaging 12.5 kWh/t.

The mineralization was measured to be moderately abrasive, with abrasion indices between 0.07 –
0.16 g and an average of 0.11 g. SMC tests resulted in an average drop weight index (DWi) of 
3.7 kWh/t. These values would indicate that the Curraghinalt mineralization is moderately soft. 
 
Rougher flotation of the master composite measured greater than 95 percent gold recovery for all of 
the tests, employing a primary grind size of approximately 80 percent passing 145 micrometres, and 
using potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) as the collector. The majority of this recovery was to the 
rougher concentrate with typically less than 2 percent of the gold being recovered to the scavenger 
concentrate. When gravity concentration was included prior to flotation, about 24 percent of the gold 
was recovered to the concentrate. This concentrate graded 747 g/t gold. This in turn led to the 
flotation concentrates obviously grading lower, however, the overall recovery of gold did not appear 
to be influenced by either the inclusion or exclusion of the gravity concentration stage. 
 
Overall gold extractions were lower from the WOL tests than for the combined 
gravity/flotation/leach tests. For WOL, gold extraction after 48 hours measured up to 90 percent. For 
tests on the gravity/flotation/leach flowsheet, gold recovery measured between 90 percent and 94 
percent.  
 
For the flotation concentrates from the master composite tests, in general, gold recovery improved as 
the cyanide concentration increased and as the regrind size decreased. On average, across all 
concentrate leach tests, gold extraction was 95 percent, with the range being between 94 percent and 
96 percent for the groups of sodium cyanide concentrations of 1,500 and 10,000 parts per million 
(ppm). Gold extraction kinetics was greatly enhanced at the higher cyanide concentration of 
10,000 ppm. The high sodium cyanide concentration did also result in increased consumption during 
the leach stage.  
 
Sodium cyanide consumption measured, on average, 0.8 kg/t of master composite for the lower 
sodium cyanide concentration leaches (1,500 and 2,000 ppm sodium cyanide) and 1.5 kg/t for the 
10,000 ppm tests. Lime consumption measured on average 0.2 kg/t. 
 
Carbon-in-leach (CIL) testing on the master composite did not appear to improve gold extraction, 
however, silver recorded a higher recoveries in these tests (8 percent on average). Silver recovery 
also increased when a higher pulp density of 50 percent solids was employed. In the remaining tests, 
silver recovery measured between 63 percent and 69 percent. 
 
On the vein composites, the Sheep Dip vein had the lowest flotation gold recovery, measuring 
approximately 91 percent, while the Crow and 106-16 composites exhibited the highest gold 
recoveries of around 98 percent. The weighted average recovery from the vein composites matched 
that of Master Composite 15-A at 96 percent gold. Copper and silver recoveries measured, on 
average, 92 percent and 86 percent. 
 
The first set of cyanidation tests on rougher concentrates from the vein composites were conducted at 
1,500 ppm sodium cyanide concentration with the second set at 2,000 ppm sodium cyanide 
concentration. An additional test was conducted on No.1 Composite at 10,000 ppm. 
 
In the first set of tests, the Sheep Dip composite had a lower leach recovery than the other 
composites, recovering only 82 percent of the gold from the flotation concentrate. Gold recovery was 
still increasing at the end of the test (48 hours). This composite performed much better in the second 
test with higher sodium cyanide concentration, during which 95 percent of the gold was recovered.

Gold extractions were higher using the flowsheet involving flotation, with approximately 92 percent 
gold overall recovery. Sodium cyanide and lime consumptions using this flowsheet measured about 
1.0 and 0.2 kg/t of flotation feed, respectively. Whole ore cyanidation resulted in, on average, about 
6 percent lower gold extraction compared to the flowsheet involving flotation/cyanidation. 
 
Higher sodium cyanide concentrations in the leaching stage were evaluated and tended to result in 
higher gold extractions. On the master composite, increasing the concentration from 1,500 to 
2,000 ppm sodium cyanide resulted in about 1.5 percent higher gold extraction. Increasing it again 
from 2,000 to 10,000 ppm resulted in an additional 1.6 percent higher gold extraction and gold 
kinetics were greatly improved. 
 
Copper was present in all the samples tested and given the relatively good liberation characteristics 
of the samples, it may be possible to produce a copper concentrate. This would lower the mass 
throughput feeding the cyanidation circuit, and potentially lower sodium cyanide consumption.  
 

12.4.2 Solid-Liquid Separation Test Work 
 
Two solid-liquid separation programs have been conducted on the Curraghinalt mineralization. The 
first flocculent screening and static settling tests were undertaken in July 2015 and were conducted at 
BaseMet on flotation tailings, concentrate, and leach residue produced from the master composite. 
As part of that sample testing program, both flotation tailings and detoxed leach residue samples 
were sent to Paterson & Cooke for solid-liquid separation testing and paste backfill assessment, 
whom reported on the results in September 2015. 
 
BaseMet undertook a preliminary flocculent screening test utilizing anionic, cationic and non-
anionic flocculants, resulting in the anionic (Magnafloc 156) producing the fastest settling rate and 
clearest supernatant in that test series. This flocculent was then tested as follows indicating that a 
dosage of approximately 5 – 10 g/t would produce the best overall performance.

Paterson & Cooke tested the flotation tailings and detox leach residue and were able to achieve 
favorable settling conditions under the following conditions: 
 

• Float Tails: 10 – 15 percent solids feed, 30 – 35 g/t anionic flocculant (Magnafloc 919) 
producing 64 percent solids underflow 

• Detox Leach Residue: 5 – 10 percent solids feed, 20 – 25 g/t slightly anionic flocculant 
(Magnafloc 10) producing 64 percent solids underflow 

 
In their flocculant screening, Paterson & Cooke did not reassess Magnafloc 156 or flocc dosages less 
than 15 g/t as tested by BaseMet as the objective of the Paterson & Cooke work was to produce a 
high underflow density for paste backfill. Paterson & Cooke was able to produce a 58.5 percent 
underflow density on the detox leach residue using a 10 percent solids feed density and a flocculant 
dose of 15 g/t.  
 
Filtration 
Filtration test work was carried out by Paterson & Cooke on flotation tailings and the methodology 
was designed to replicate vacuum disk filtration in terms of filter leaf submersion, form, and both dry 
and total cycle times. High filtration rates were measured, with increased loading observed with 
increased feed density and faster cycle times. The resulting cakes measured between 20 – 22 percent 
moisture. 
 

12.4.3 Cyanide Detoxification Test Work 
 
As part of the BaseMet test programs, samples were sent to the BV Minerals division of Bureau 
Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd., Vancouver in 2015 for detoxification test work. The SO2/O2 
cyanide destruction process was successful in reducing the levels of Weak Acid Dissociable Cyanide 
(CN WAD) to the target of less than 5.0 milligrams per litre (mg/L), achieving 0.07 mg/L of CN 
Total and less than 0.05mg/L CN WAD.  
 
A detox feed slurry containing 974.2 mg/L CN WAD was effectively treated and resulted in a stable 
final CN WAD of less than 0.05 mg/L under reaction conditions of 5.3 grams SO2 / grams CN Total, 
pH 8.7 and six hours of retention time, however 1.5 mg/L CN WAD was achieved after a residence 
time of 60 minutes under the same conditions. Copper catalyst addition was required at 0.7 
grams/grams CN Total in this test work to achieve the final result.

12.4.4 Feasibility Study Metallurgical Testwork (2016) 
 
Base Metallurgical (BaseMet) Laboratories in Kamloops, BC, completed a comprehensive testwork 
program on the Curraghinalt mineralization between January and April of 2016 which included; 
 

• Comminution 
• Gravity concentration 
• Bulk flotation 
• Mineralogy 
• Dewatering (solid/ liquid separation) 
• Oxygen uptake testing, 
• Viscosity evaluation, and  
• Cyanidation 

 
Over 1.5 tonnes of Curraghinalt samples (a mix of coarse rock sample and drill core), was received 
for testing; 277 samples from 11 boreholes were taken as they passed through each discreet vein for 
flotation testing, while an additional 236 intervals were sampled for comminution testing, and the 
bulk vein material generated five different composites for the testwork program. The testwork 
program for Curraghinalt was designed to optimize the overall process for gold extraction, and to 
provide an understanding of the variability in the metallurgical response for the feasibility study.

Comminution Testwork 
Comminution testwork was undertaken, testing the Crusher Work Index (CWi) on material from 4 of 
the veins and the two waste rock types, the SAG Mill Comminution (SMC) and Bond Ball Mill 
Work Index tests (BWi) on the comminution variability composites, and Abrasion indexes (Ai) on 
vein material from five vein deposits and the optimization composite. The summary of the results 
from the comminution testwork can be found in Table 22 and indicates that the mineralization from 
each of the veins tested appears to be relatively soft to moderate in hardness and amenable to SAG 
milling. The abrasiveness of the rock is also relatively low. 
 
The SMC results shown in Table 23 indicates that the variability samples measured an average Drop 
Weight Index (DWi) of 4.9 kWh/m3 which informs that the mineralization is quite amenable to SAG 
milling. The sample test results range between being moderately soft to moderately hard at 2.28 
kWh/m3 to 6.87 kWh/m3 respectively. 
 
A closing screen size of 212µm was used for the Bond Ball Mill Work Index (BWi) Tests with an 
average product sizing of approximately 162µm K80. The average BWi measured 13.3 kWh/tonne, 
ranging from 10.5 to 14.8 kWh/t across the 25 composites, indicating the mineralization to be of 
moderate hardness.  
 
Bond Low Impact Crusher tests were conducted on rock samples specifically suppied by Dalradian 
Resources for this testing. The average work index for each sample set ranged from 6.9 to 9.2 kWh/t, 
which would be considered very soft with respect to crushing.

Optimization Testwork 
A series of flotation and leaching tests were completed to optimize the process flowsheet and 
associated variables. The primary grind – recovery relationship was assessed for both gravity and 
rougher flotation. 
 
There does appear to be an impact of primary grind sizing on gravity gold recovery as illustrated in 
Figure 22. Gravity gold recovery at primary grind sizes between 106 and 145µm K80 measured 
between 28 and 49 percent whereas at 340 to 460µm K80 recovery measured 17 to 20 percent 
respectively.  
 
Intensive leach optimization testwork was also undertaken on the gravity concentrate, the results of 
which indicate that a NaCN dose of 2000ppm or above at a grind of approximately 80 percent 
passing 44 micrometres using NaOH at a pH of 12 for a residence time of 48 hours achieved a gold 
extraction of 99.6 percent. Overall cyanide consumption of NaCN for that test (T69) was 0.18 kg/t. 
Increasing cyanide dose showed limited benefit to the overall extraction at 24 or 48 hours, and only 
gave an increase in gold extraction of approximately 3 percent at the 6-hour mark.

Overall gold recovery, to the combined pan, rougher and scavenger flotation concentrates, was also 
impacted by primary grind, more so once the grind size increase above approximately 80 percent 
passing 300 micrometres such that a primary grind size of approximately 80 percent passing 240 
micrometres was selected. Six of the optimization tests on the Optimization Composite excluded 
gravity concentration, and these tests were at relatively coarse primary grind sizes. One of these, Test 
74, was undertaken to produce products for downstream testing and consumed 150 kilograms of feed 
mass. Tests 56, 65, 71 and 72 measured overall rougher flotation gold recoveries of between 98.9 
and 99.4 percent despite excluding gravity concentration. Comparatively, tests 10 and 11, which had 
the same primary grind time and included gravity concentration, measured gold recoveries of 99.3 
and 99.4 percent respectively. This would potentially indicate that gravity concentration might not be 
required to achieve similar gold recoveries to the rougher flotation concentrate.  
 
Test 58 was conducted to evaluate flash flotation. The nominal primary grind sizing for this test was 
approximately 80 percent passing 650 micrometres (K80). At this sizing, about 85 percent of the 
gold was recovered to the rougher concentrate. Gold was still being readily recovered in the 4th 
rougher stage and longer residence times might allow for higher rougher flotation recovery or an 
assessment of coarse particle flotation. However, the practicality of running longer flotation times at 
plant scale at such coarse primary grind sizes would need to be further evaluated. These optimization 
tests were initially undertaken on a high grade composite due to limited sample mass available, 
however the flowsheet variables were confirmed on both a low grade and LOM grade composite 
with similar results. 
 
Cleaning flotation of the rougher concentrate was also assessed, and upon completion of the 
variability program it was shown that cleaning of the rougher concentrate with no regrind resulted in 
a gold recovery decrease of approximately 2 percent and mass pull decrease on average of 
approximately 6 percent.  
 
Leach parameters were evaluated through 23 cyanidation bottle roll tests that were conducted on the 
bulk Test 17 combined rougher and scavenger concentrate sample. Tests 32 to 37 were undertaken at 
2000 ppm NaCN concentration, and Tests 54 to 55, at 5000ppm NaCN concentration tested the 
effect of particle sizing. These tests are summarized in Table 24.

At finer particle sizings, difficulties were encountered maintaining dissolved oxygen (DO) levels 
above 15 mg/L, despite oxygen sparging at each reading. It appears that this lower DO resulted in 
reduced gold extractions at sizings of approximately 80% passing 35µm and finer. For test 55, the 
DO was maintained above 15 mg/L, but gold extraction was no better than test 54, which had the

same cyanide concentration but a slightly coarser particle sizing of approximately 80 percent passing 
45µm. 
 
Sizings coarser than approximately 80 percent passing 45 micrometres (65 µm and 138 µm K80) 
also had poorer gold recoveries than the equivalent test at approximately 80 percent passing 45 
micrometres K80. Thus, 45 micrometres K80 appeared to be the optimal particle sizing for this 
sample. Further optimization test work and mineralogy would be required to refine the leaching 
extractions of of gold in the samples with finer grinds.

A number of other optimization tests were undertaken including an assessment of the cyanide dose 
on the leach recovery and tail residue grade. From the results performed on this concentrate sample 
reground to approximately 80 percent passing 45 micrometres, with and without CIL, tail residues 
increased once the NaCN dose used decreased below 2000 ppm. A slight improvement in recovery 
and tail grade was observed when a NaCN dose of 5000 ppm was used. Further testwork would be 
required to evaluate the 5000ppm result, however the average cyanide consumption increased to 2.7 
kg/t from 1.6 kg/t for the 2000 ppm NaCN tests. At the time, trade-off calculations indicated that 
increasing the sodium cyanide dose from an optimized 2000 ppm result to 5000 ppm was not an 
economical and consequently 3000 ppm NaCN was selected for the variability testwork. Additional 
testwork would be required to further refine the 2000 – 5000 ppm result. 
 
A summary of results using other cyanide bottle roll test conditions on the Test 17 flotation 
concentrate are as follows: 
 

• Pre-oxidation, involving 12 hours of oxygen sparging prior to the test, did not improve 
extraction 

• The addition of lead nitrate did not improve gold extraction in the range 20 to 250 g/t. 
• The use of cement instead of lime to modulate pH had a minor adverse effect on gold 

extraction. Cement consumption was much higher than lime consumption.

• Higher pulp densities, as compared to 33 percent by weight, resulted in relatively decreased 
gold extractions. 

• Lowering the cyanidation concentration from 2000 ppm resulted in much lower gold 
recoveries and increased tail grades.  

• Lowering the pH to 10 improved gold extraction by about 0.7 percent. Raising the pH 
lowered gold extraction by about 7 percent. 

• Raising the cyanide concentration to 5000 ppm increased gold extraction by about 2.7 
percent, despite the test being at about pH 12. Cyanide consumption was substantially higher 
at this concentration, however. 

 
Variability Testwork 
A flotation test was conducted on each of the process variability composites at a nominal grind size 
of approximately 80 percent passing 240 micrometres. Based on the flotation optimization testwork, 
the tests did not include gravity concentration. Potassium Amyl Xanthate (PAX) was used as the 
collector and Methyl IsoButyl Carbonyl (MIBC) as the frother. Rougher flotation gold extraction, 
weighted for the LOM mine plan, averaged 97.7 percent across the 61 samples with a mass pull of 
approximately 11.2 percent. The extraction of gold from the flotation concentrate cyanidation stage 
alone had a weighted averaged of 96.3 percent.  
 
Figure 25 illustrates the rougher mass pull (%) and gold recovery for the 61 variability samples. 
 
Average rougher recovery, when weighted for gold grade, was 98.1 percent across the 61 samples. 
Average rougher recoveries, weighted for head grades, for silver and copper measured 84.3 and 98.5 
percent, respectively. About 2 percent recovery difference was also observed between the rougher 
and cleaner concentrate for these elements.

Recombined rougher concentrate from each of the flotation variability composites was tested for 
amenability to cyanidation. A single Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) Cyanidation bottle roll test was 
conducted on each of the composites. Each rougher concentrate sample was reground to a nominal 
grind size of approximately 80 percent passing 45 micrometres prior to the bottle roll test. Leach 
recoveries for Au and Ag for the different veins are shown in Figure 26.  
 
Relative silver and copper extractions in the cyanidation circuit averaged 71 and 14 percent. Sodium 
cyanide consumption was moderate, averaging 1.3 kg/t of fresh feed.

Feasibility Recovery Projections 
The overall recoveries for gold above a 5 g/t mine cut-off range from 93.9 to 94.8 percent without 
solution losses. Typical operational inefficiencies can vary from 0.3 to 1 percent and the LOM mine 
plan weighted average gold recovery is estimated at approximately 94.3 percent. From the variability 
data illustrated in Figure 27, it can be seen that there is indeed a grade/recovery relationship for 
silver, but based on a weighted average from the mine plan, the estimated silver recovery is 57.9 
percent.

Solid/Liquid Separation Testwork 
Settling tests were conducted on rougher tailings and CIL residues from the variability program, 
covering 14 veins and the optimization composite #2, which was created from the comminution 
composites to represent the LOM grade. Results are summarized in Table 25.  
 
Rougher tailing settling rates were relatively consistent with free settling rates measuring between 
177 and 195 millimetres per minute. Compaction densities were also quite consistent measuring on 
average 58 percent solids.  
 
CIL residue at finer grinds had settling rates that were slower and less consistent compared to 
rougher tailing settling rates. Free settling rates for the CIL residues measured between 14 and 68 
mm/minute to an average ultimate compaction density of 47 percent solids.

Oxygen Update Rate Determination Testwork 
Reground combined rougher/scavenger concentrate was utilized to determine the oxygen uptake 
characteristics of the mineralization. Oxygen Consumption results are displayed in Table 26. 
 
Although the oxygen consumption within the first two hours appears to be low, it is more than likely 
significantly higher as the initial dissolved oxygen measurements at time zero for these intervals was 
less than 1 mg/L. A satisfactory dissolved oxygen level at time zero for the intervals was not 
achieved until after 3 hours. The sample exhibits a relatively high oxygen consumption with demand 
not decreasing until after 4 hours.

Detoxification Testwork 
As part of the 2016 BaseMet test programs, samples were sent to Kemetco Research Inc., Vancouver 
(Kemetco), to optimize the cyanide detoxification process and deliver representative treated detox 
effluent samples for environmental testing on two grades, high grade (HG) and LOM grade (LG), of 
flotation concentrate.  
 
The two samples were each ground and subjected to a carbon in leach process (CIL) using 
representative test conditions. The relatively higher NaCN addition to the leach and higher sulphide 
levels in the concentrates resulted in relatively higher levels of sulphate, cyanate and thiocyanate in 
solution. Consequently, direct detoxification of the CIL tailings resulted in elevated levels of 
sulphate above 5000 ppm, causing consolidation issues with the paste fill.  
 
The barren leach slurry tailings resulting from each leach was then diluted to 20 percent solids and 
decanted, to mimic the introduction of a cyanide recovery thickener in an effort to reduce the level of 
sulphate in the CIL tailings and eliminate the paste fill consolidation issue. This step produced both a 
separate supernatant solution and thickened slurry sample for detox testing. The test products from 
the HG concentrate were split into smaller test lots and used for detox optimization testing, (due to 
sufficient mass being available) and test products from the LG concentrate were used for 
confirmation of the process parameters through continuous bulk testing under optimized conditions.  
In total, 14 bench scale detoxification tests were performed. The SO2/O2 cyanide destruction process 
was successful in reducing the levels of CN WAD to the target of less than 5.0 mg/L for all streams 
and the principal results obtained from the detox testing were as follows:  
 

• HG tailings slurry sample: CN WAD was reduced to 0.277 ppm, Cu to 0.16 ppm, and Fe to 
0.51 ppm using a 5:1 SO2:CNWAD ratio, 15 ppm Zn and pH 9, with a 150 minute retention 
time. Copper did not work as effectively as zinc as a catalyst for this feed.  

• HG solution sample: CN WAD was reduced to 0.313 ppm and Cu to 4.37 ppm using a 5:1 
SO2:CNWAD ratio, 15 ppm Cu and pH 8.5, with a 150 minute retention time. Replacement 
of copper with zinc as the catalyst may further improve results.  

• LG slurry: CN WAD was reduced to 0.651 ppm, Cu to 0.5 ppm and Fe to 11.9 ppm using a 
5:1 SO2:CNWAD ratio, 30 ppm Zn and pH 9, with a 120 minute retention time.  

• LG solution: CNWAD was reduced to 0.739 ppm, Cu to 3.22 ppm and Zn to 0.12 ppm using 
a 5:1 SO2:CNWAD ratio, 15 ppm Cu and pH 8.5, with a 150 minute retention time.   

 
Overall the detox optimization tests identified suitable conditions for consistently meeting target 
levels for CN WAD removal from this challenging effluent. Replacement of the copper catalyst with 
zinc improved the slurry detox efficiency; however, the effect of the zinc catalyst on the solution 
detox was not investigated due to sample restrictions, and is recommended for future work.  
If significant changes to the process chemistry are needed in the future, particularly if any treated 
effluent is recycled back into the circuit, additional detox testing would be advisable, potentially 
extending to Locked-Cycle testing of detox in combination with CIL testing. 
 

12.4.5 Ore Sorting (2016-2017) 
 
Altogether, 3 ore sorting test programs have been undertaken so far with the direction of Dalradian, 
using both dual energy x-ray transmission (XRT) and laser sensors, and the following is a summary 
of the results.  
 
"With an XRT sensor, the material to be sorted is exposed to the x-radiation while it is moving along 
a conveyor type belt. The x-ray sensor system below the material produces a digital image of the

material, using two different energy bands. The x-ray attenuation through the material is different 
within the two bands and depends on both, the material thickness and atomic density. Special 
transformation of the attenuation images of the two bands classifies each pixel according to the 
measured atomic density. Because the x-rays pass through the particles and are a measure of the 
attenuation through the entire rock, XRT separation is almost independent of surface quality of the 
material or its moisture. Surface properties such as color and texture and/or contaminations such as 
dirt, dust, paint, etc. are mainly irrelevant to the detection. In laser sorting technology, the laser beam 
scans the surface of the particles. The degree of the diffusion or the "scattering effect" of the laser 
beam on the surface of the rocks may vary for different mineral types. This "spot size" is measured 
and indicates differences of the material structure." (Outotec Report, December 2, 2016) 
 
An ore sorting amenability program was initially undertaken at the Steinert sorting facility, 
Kentucky, USA in 2016, where 26 samples were tested. Rocks varying in size from -120+20 
millimetres were selected from the bulk vein samples shipped to BaseMet Labs for the feasibility 
study testwork, to create two samples each from V75, T-17, No.1 and the 106-16 veins. Another 8 
samples of psammite and 10 of semi-pelite were sent to represent the dominant waste rock types. 
After each vein rock was scanned and each waste composite was scanned, the sorting algorithms 
were developed. "Bucket tests" were run through the sorters and the results combined to show that 
with little optimization, the sulphide bearing mineralization contained usable differences in x-ray 
absorption while the laser sensor could easily detect the quartzite inclusions; such that the feed grade 
of approximately 4.7 g/t Au was increased to 10.55 g/t Au in approximately 42 percent of the sorter 
feed, representing a gold recovery to the sorter concentrate of approximately 93 percent. The waste 
rejects from the combined XRT/Laser sorteing bucket test were assayed at 0.58 g/t Au. Clearly this 
initial sorting test indicated that the deposit mineralization was potentially amenable to ore sorting. 
 
Two larger bulk tests were then undertaken, one at Steinert and one at Outotec/Tomra in Wedel, 
Germany. 
 
Steinert was provided with a bulk sample of mine development material in seven large 
polypropylene woven bags with nominal one tonne capacity. This material was screened to -
50+10mm and washed prior to sorting. In this test, 829 kilograms of screen discharge was tested 
through a series of sorters starting with the combination sorter (XRT/Laser/3D), then the waste 
stream from that sorter was sent through an XRT sorter and then the waste stream from that was sent 
through a laser sorter. The combined results showed that a feed grade into the combination sorter of 
approximately 3 g/t Au could be upgraded to 4.3 g/t Au with the waste grading 0.64 g/t Au. This 
would represent a gold recovery through the combination of sorters at approximately 92.4 percent in 
64 percent of the sorter feed mass. However, with this testing, there was insufficient information 
about the fines material that was screened and the proportions thereof that were tested, and 
consequently this result can only be used as indicative. 
 
The second bulk test was undertaken at Outotec/Tomra. 8.5t of mine development sample grading 
10.6g/t Au was crushed and screened to -104 millimetres to +12 millimetres at the Curraghinalt site. 
The fines material (-12 mm) representing 49.5 percent of the mass, was assayed at 24.6 g/t Au. The 
screen oversize (-104+80 mm) represented approximately 34 percent of the screen feed and assayed 
at 2.3g/t Au, while the midsize (-80+12 mm) representing approximately 16.8 percent of the screen 
feed, assayed at 12.8 g/t Au.  It is suggested that with this mineralization there may be a case for 
coarse beneficiation, even without ore sorting. The coarse and mid sized fractions were sent to the 
Tomra testing centre and weighed approximately 4.5 tonnes. At the test centre the sample was 
further screened and washed into the following size fractions: Washing fines, <15 millimetres, +15-
35 millimetres and +35 millimetres. Washing fines and the below 15 millimetres fractions were 
dried, weighed and assayed, however they were not sorted. Sorting was undertaken on the fractions -
35+15 millimetres and +35 millimetres. Each screened fraction was split to create six sub samples in

total and these were sorted using different sorter settings to evaluate the impact of different 
thresholds on the sorting performance for the different size fractions. These ore sorting test results 
are displayed in Table 27. 
 
The XRT stages alone achieved gold recoveries between 95.6 percent and 98.7 percent. These results 
were achieved with a waste removal average of approximately 59 percent of sorting feed mass. This 
would indicate that there is a strong correlation between sulphide detection and gold association for 
this mine development sample. The laser scavenger step was able to increase the gold recovery close 
to 100 percent. However the waste removal decreases to an average below 50 percent. It is 
recommended moving forward that the necessity of a scavenger step be assessed in a trade-off.

During 2016, Dalradian undertook test mining with development and stope material made available 
for processing in May, 2017. This material was shipped from Northern Ireland to the Kettle River 
processing facility in the USA. The material was processed through the plant in three batch 
campaigns, defined as Lot 1, 2 and 3. Lots 1 and 2 contained development material, and Lot 3 
contained material from the Test Stopes 1, 2 and 3. 
 
The Kettle River processing plant flowsheet included: 
 

• Primary jaw crushing,  
• Secondary crushing in closed circuit with a vibrating screen,  
• Primary grinding by rod mills, operated in parallel, 
• Secondary grinding by ball mills, 
• Flash flotation, 
• Flotation concentrate leaching, 
• Flotation tailings leaching, through CIL – concentrate leach tails are added to the feed of this 

circuit, and, 
• Loaded carbon from concentrate and tailings leach is combined, stripped and refined into 

gold doré bars.

During the trial, the Kettle River plant operation was adjusted to ensure smooth processing and was 
supervised by process metallurgists at all times. The plant also ran a single rod mill due to the 
decreased throughput of approximately 45 to 64 tph and to control the product size to the 
downstream processes.  
 
Sampling of the processed material was conducted by a belt sampler and hourly, these cumulative 
belt samples were split, and two samples were collected. 
 
There were minor processing challenges with the Lot 2 material, and most of the limitations of were 
due to high fine ore bin levels rather than any negative metallurgical effects in the plant. Some 
qualitative observations of the material being processed was that it appeared to have a higher clay 
content, however, this did not seem to increase hang ups in the chutes, and although there were a few 
days with high precipitation where this was a potential issue, multiple inspections of the chutes 
indicated that there was not a challenge with material hang up. The fines, clays and precipitation mix 
did cause issues with conveyer tracking, spillage and issues with material wrapping around, clogging 
the rollers and take-up tower; which did cause a number of crushing plant shutdowns while these 
items were addressed. This is a consideration for the conveyor and crushing plant design moving 
forward.  Additionally, the material appeared to be "slabby" and rectangular, which is a 
consideration when selecting screens for particle size separation, but preferred for ore sorting 
applications. 
 
There were very few processing challenges with the Lot 3 material other than those already noted. 
The consumption of reagent was observed to be similar to that predicted in the 2016 Feasibility 
Study (FS) and observed in the laboratory testwork, while the average overall recovery was slightly 
higher than expected at 95.9 percent Au when compared to the predicted 94.3 percent gold in the 
feasibility study. This may have been due to the leaching of the flotation tails in the Kettle River 
flowsheet which is presently not in the proposed Curraghinalt flowsheet.

12.4.7 Flotation Only Flowsheet Testwork (2017) 
 
The objective of this Curraghinalt metallurgical testwork program was to further optimize the 
developed process, and produce a flotation concentrate for downstream testing, including smelter 
testing; and focused on a process including flotation only, without cyanidation leaching.  
Testing and flowsheet optimization focused around one bulk composite, targeting life of mine gold 
feed grade. Testing included rougher flotation evaluating grind size, cleaner flotation evaluating 
regrind size, and the investigation into a selective cleaning circuit to produce a high-grade gold-
copper concentrate. A test, processing 1.2 tonnes of material, was subsequently conducted to produce 
concentrate and products for additional testing.   
 
Optimization testing showed finer primary grinding potentially resulted in marginally higher gold 
rougher flotation recovery but additional testwork would be recommended to confirm this. The

primary grind size K80 of 106 micrometres was chosen, which achieved a gold recovery of 98 
percent to the combined rougher and gravity concentrate.  
 
The effect of regrinding was established to be quite limited in bulk sulphide cleaning flotation. With 
this flowsheet, the upgrading of gold is dependent on the sulphide content in the sample, as gold will 
respond to flotation similar to sulphide mineral, particularly pyrite, under non-selective conditions. 
The coarsest regrind of 45µm achieved the greatest performance, recovering 96 percent of the gold 
to the combined gravity + cleaner concentrate at a gold grade of 199 g/t. 
 
An alternative selective flowsheet was investigated to produce a high-grade gold and copper 
concentrate. The regrind size was decreased significantly to approximately 80 percent passing 15 to 
23 micrometres in order to liberate gold from pyrite, as well as using selective collector and elevated 
pH with lime in the cleaning stages. Initial testing with this schematic indicated the production of a 
high-grade gold concentrate is possible, although at lower gold recovery. Grades of about 1610 g/t 
gold and 29 percent copper were produced recovering between 68 to 74 percent gold and 54 to 59 
percent copper. This flowsheet also included a scavenging or recleaning circuit to recover a low-
grade gold concentrate. An additional 12 to 23 percent of the gold was recovered into this 
concentrate grading 224 to 243 g/t gold. Additional testing including closed circuit tests would be 
required to refine the selective flowsheet design for optimized results.  
 
Bulk testing on 1185 kilograms of material produced 7.3 kilograms of gravity concentrate, and 8.7 
kilograms of final 3rd cleaner flotation concentrate. The combined gold grade and recovery for these 
products were 472 g/t at 81 percent recovery. The first cleaner concentrate + gravity concentrate 
graded about 217 g/tonne gold and recovered 95 percent of the gold. Copper in the flotation 
concentrate measured 15.4 percent copper, at a recovery of about 68 percent. than reference testing, 
which is thought to be a partial result of a slightly coarser regrind (23µm K80). A calculated 
recombined gravity + cleaner 1 concentrate and cleaner scavenger concentrate (Products 1 to 5) 
graded approximately 217 g/t gold and recovered about 95 percent of the gold in the feed. 
 

12.5 Other Design Considerations  
 

12.5.1 Mercury 
 
Only traces of mercury have been observed in the composites sampled. Typically, if the mercury 
level is below 50 ppm in the process plant feed, in gold districts where mercury is present, it is not 
expected to be an issue downstream, either as a competitor for gold in the extraction process or for 
health reasons. 50 ppm is an experience-based guideline as it is dependent on the extraction potential 
of the mercury and its geological form. Above 50 ppm, mercury mitigation actions may be required, 
however, it is understood that the Curraghinalt process facility has included these abatement 
processes in the design. 
 

12.6 Relevant Results 
 
The results from the previously reported metallurgical test programs concluded with the following 
flowsheet:  
 

• Primary grind to approximately 80 percent passing 240 micrometres, followed by flotation 
and CIL of the rougher concentrate ground to approximately 80 percent passing 50 
micrometres.

Based on an analysis of the metallurgical results, the gravity concentrator was removed from the 
grinding circuit during the design phase as it did not benefit gold recovery. Cleaner flotation was also 
removed from the process flowsheet as it did not benefit gold recovery. 
 

12.6.1 Process Design Criteria and Metallurgical Projections 
 
The process plant design criteria and metallurgical projections developed for the selected option 
were based on an analysis of the test work completed between in 2015 and 2016. This is detailed in 
the following sections. 
 

12.6.2 Comminution Design Criteria 
 
The design was based on the 75th percentile of the available results. A summary of the key 
comminution design criteria is presented in Table 29. The comminution design criteria selected 
shows very moderate values for comminution.

12.6.3 Flotation Design Criteria 
 
Flotation results from the 2016 feasibility study testwork were used to estimate flotation recovery. 
Gold grade vs. rougher recovery curves were created from test data and empirical equations were 
then generated to predict gold and silver recoveries.  
 
A summary of the key process design criteria for the flotation area is presented in Table 30. A 
flotation feed F80 of approximately 240 um was selected.  
 
Tests 59 to 61 incorporated only 10 percent of the PAX dosage of other tests; 4.2 g/t instead of 42 
g/t. Despite this reduction in dosage, gold recoveries were similar to other tests.

12.6.4 Regrind Design Criteria 

 
A summary of the key process design criteria for the concentrate regrind is presented in Table 31. A 
final regrind size of approximately 80% passing 50um was selected. The Bond Ball Mill Work Index 
was used to size the regrind mill for the Curraghinalt process facility.

12.6.5 CIL Design Criteria 
 
Cyanidation results from the 2016 BaseMet test program were used to develop the leach circuit 
design criteria. Recovery projections for Curraghinalt are based on all tests conducted at a grind size 
of approximately 80 percent passing 50 micrometres. Further test work is recommended to confirm 
recovery projections and assumptions for Curraghinalt. A summary of the key process design criteria 
for the leach area is presented in Table 32.

12.6.6 Cyanide Destruction Design Criteria 
 
The cyanide destruction data is limited. Therefore, industrial standards were used to develop 
preliminary reagent requirements and operating conditions for the circuit. Further test work is 
recommended to confirm reagent requirements for the other deposits and to more fully define the 
process variables. A summary of the key process design criteria for cyanide destruction is presented 
in Table 33.

12.8 Future Metallurgical Work 
 
Substantial testing has been undertaken on the Curraghinalt mineralization. Additional testing that 
may be beneficial to the Project includes: 
 
Comminution. It is recommended that additional Bond Work Index tests are undertaken at a finer 
closed screen size to confirm energy requirements around the regrind size. It is recommended that 
coarse beneficiation and ore sorting should be further assessed as based on the current testwork there 
is significant potential for these processes to provide additional value to the project. 
 
Flotation. Additional testwork at lower dosages of reagent should be undertaken to further refine the 
operating cost through the next level of engineering. It is suggested that coarse particle flotation 
should also be assessed as it may reduce footprint and add value to the project. 
 
Solid Liquid Separation. Although there are a number of solid-liquid separation tests, it is highly 
recommended that in the next phase of engineering, additional solid-liquid testing be undertaken to 
confirm the thickening, rheology and filtration design parameters. Thickeners have been sized on 
static settling tests and it would be beneficial to undertake dynamic testing prior to placing orders to 
confirm sizing parameters. 
 
Detoxification. Additional oxidation test work should be undertaken to optimize the cyanide 
detoxification process conditions including the use of zinc sulphate as a catalyst on the solution 
detox process. If significant changes to the process chemistry are required in the future, particularly

if any treated effluent is recycled back into the circuit, additional detox testing would be advisable, 
potentially extending to locked-cycle testing of detox in combination with CIL testing. 
 
Bulk Material Handling. In the next phase of engineering, the calculated volumes in stockpiles and 
material flow characteristics assumed through chutes, could be further refined based on results from 
bulk material testwork.

13 Mineral Resource Estimate 
 

13.1 Introduction 
 
This section describes the methodology and summarizes the key assumptions considered to prepare 
the geology and mineral resource model. In the opinion of qualified person for the mineral resource, 
the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable representation of the global gold mineral 
resources of the Curraghinalt gold deposit at the current level of sampling. The mineral resources 
have been estimated in conformity with the widely accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource 
and Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines and are reported in accordance with the Canadian 
Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves 
and have not demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the 
mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 
 
The construction of the mineral resource model was a collaborative effort between between 
Dalradian and SRK staff. Dalradian provided the technical support and assistance related to the 
drilling database and geological modelling. Dr. James Siddorn, PGeo (APGO#1314) provided 
insight to offsetting faults and the structural geology controls on gold mineralization. The data 
review and geological modelling updates and modifications were performed by Mr. Dominic 
Chartier, PGeo (OGQ#874, APGO#2775). Grade estimation and associated sensitivity analyses, and 
mineral resource classification were performed by Dr. David Machuca, PEng (PEO#100508889) 
under the supervision of Dr. Oy Leuangthong, PEng (PEO#90563867). The overall process was 
reviewed by Mr. Glen Cole, PGeo (APGO#1416). 
 
An additional 145 core boreholes for 46,487 metres and 181 underground channels/faces for 535 
metres were drilled and / or sampled since the 2016 mineral resource model was disclosed publicly 
by Dalradian in a news release on May 5, 2016. 
 
Leapfrog Geo™ software (version 4.2.3) was used to construct the geological solids. SRK used a 
combination of Datamine Studio RM software (version 1.2.45.0), Leapfrog Geo™, and GSLib™ 
software to prepare assay data for geostatistical analysis, construct the block model, estimate gold 
grades, and tabulate mineral resources. The mineral resource model considers 731 core boreholes 
(178,130 metres) and 678 underground channels/faces (2,397 metres). The final database for this 
mineral resource model has an effective date of March 20, 2018. 
 
The Mineral Resource Statement was prepared by Drs. Leuangthong and Machuca, and Mr. Chartier, 
who are independent qualified persons pursuant to National Instrument 43-101. The effective date of 
the Audited Mineral Resource Statement for the Curraghinalt deposit is May 10, 2018. It represents 
the ninth mineral resource evaluation prepared for the Curraghinalt gold project. 
 

13.2 Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology 
 
The evaluation of mineral resources for the Curraghinalt gold project involved the following 
procedures: 
 

• Database compilation and verification. 
• Construction of overburden, fault system, and vein wireframe models, using stratigraphy, 

underground mapping, and structural trends.

SRK Team  Dalradian_Curraghinalt_2018_TR_3CD016002_JCS_DC_gc_ol_ah_20180620.docx June 22, 2018 

• Definition and construction geostatistical mineral resource domains. 
• Data conditioning (compositing and capping) for geostatistical analysis and variography. 
• Selection of estimation strategy and estimation parameters. 
• Block modelling and grade interpolation. 
• Validation, classification, and tabulation. 
• Assessment of "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" and selection of 

reporting assumptions. 
• Preparation of the updated Mineral Resource Statement. 

 
The following sections summarize the methodology and assumptions made by SRK to construct the 
mineral resource model. 
 

13.3 Resource Database 
 
Dalradian provided the mineral resource database as exports from a LogChief project database. The 
database used to evaluate the mineral resources of the Curraghinalt gold deposit includes 731 core 
boreholes (178,130 metres) and 678 underground channels/faces (2,397 metres). An additional 145 
core boreholes for 46,487 metres and 181 underground channels/faces for 535 metres were drilled or 
sampled since the 2016 mineral resource model (Figure 28). The final header, down-hole survey, 
lithology intervals, and assay results were received on March 20, 2018.  
 
The drilling and underground channel/face samples were acquired primarily by Dalradian between 
2010 and 2018. Drilling and underground sampling was also completed by Ennex (1987 – 1999) and 
drilling by Tournigan (2003 – 2008), representing a combined total of approximately 20 percent of 
the available meterage. Tournigan and Dalradian used HQ and NQ-sized equipment for all 
boreholes. Ennex used BQ-sized equipment for underground drilling and HQ as well as NQ-sized 
equipment for surface boreholes. All three companies used the smaller diameter equipment for 
drilling in difficult ground conditions. 
 
Collars of boreholes completed by Dalradian were surveyed by a surveyor. Elevations were adjusted 
to coincide with a lidar-generated surface. Down-hole surveys were completed with EZ-Trac and 
Reflex multi-shot tools every 6 to 3 metres. The survey of borehole collars and down-hole surveys 
for underground boreholes completed by Ennex is undocumented. Collars of surface boreholes 
completed by Ennex were surveyed initially by chaining from a baseline and later using a total 
station and GPS receivers of unknown type. Information about down-hole survey methods are 
unavailable. Collar locations of boreholes completed by Tournigan were surveyed using GPS 
equipment. The elevations were later adjusted to coincide with a surface generated from a lidar 
survey. Down-hole surveys on the first four boreholes completed by Tournigan were carried out with 
a Tropari instrument; all later boreholes were surveyed with a Reflex multi shot tool every 6 metres.  
 
Based on previous project exposure and on SRK's most recent site visit completed during active 
drilling operations in October 2017, SRK believes that drilling, logging, core handling, core storage, 
and analytical quality control protocols used by Dalradian meet generally accepted industry best 
practices. In the opinion of SRK, the sampling preparation, security, and analytical procedures used 
by Dalradian are consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are, therefore, 
adequate for an advanced exploration project.  
 
SRK also carried out a detailed quality control review including the review of analytical quality 
control programs carried out by Dalradian from 2016 to 2018, as detailed in a memo dated May 16, 
2018. Overall, SRK considers the analytical results from core and underground face/channel 
sampling conducted at Curraghinalt to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of mineral resource 
estimation. The data examined by SRK do not present obvious evidence of analytical bias.

13.4 Geological Interpretation and Modelling 
 
The gold mineralization at the Curraghinalt gold project is hosted in narrow, sub-parallel auriferous 
quartz-carbonate-sulphide veins. Twenty-one vein wireframe domains were constructed by SRK 
with the assistance of Dalradian (Figure 9). The veins are cut by a network of late brittle faults. The 
vein wireframes were offset by the four main observed shear zones and faults (Kiln, 105, 106, and 
302). The vein offset across each fault varies between one to ten metres on average. Other faults 
were also modelled but do not offset the vein wireframes in the model, due to either not showing any 
apparent offset or their lower confidence in location and offset. Further information on the 
mineralization and faults is presented in Section 6.3.1. 
 
The vein wireframes were modelled on the extents of logged gold mineralized shear veins (D veins), 
and snapped to assays irrespective of gold grades. Other vein types such as extensional veins (C 
veins) can also be auriferous but were only included when immediately adjacent to, or within a 
modelled D vein interval. The previous resource model vein wireframes were snapped to 0.5-metre 
fixed length composites, composited from borehole collar to toe, prior to modelling the veins. The 
new vein wireframes therefore provide a better representation of true vein width, without dilution 
due to compositing (Figure 29).

Figure 29: Vein Domaining Methodology Change Between 2016 Fixed-Length Composites and 
2018 D Vein Assays. 
 
The veins generally strike west northwest and dip moderately to steeply to the north northeast at 50 
to 75 degrees. The true thickness of the modelled vein wireframes averages 0.47 metres but can 
locally be as much as five metres thick. The domains are listed in Table 35 with statistics on domain 
thickness and volume for each domain. Comparisons are made to comparative domain modelling 
conducted in 2016 that had been used to support the previous mineral resource model but which are 
now redundant. A visual comparison between the 2016 and 2018 modeled vein domains is provided 
in (Figure 30).  
 
In addition to the auriferous quartz-carbonate-sulphide veins, SRK and Dalradian constructed a 3D 
lithology model for the purpose of geotechnical evaluation. The geotechnical lithology model 
focussed on delineating the spatial distribution of pelite, semi-pelite, and psammite. The pelite was 
further sub-divided into weak and strong pelite. Due to the large amount of geological drilling 
information and the need for high resolution wireframes, rapid Leapfrog Radial Basis Function 
(RBF) interpolation algorithms were used for 3D modelling of the various geotechnical units. The 
same four faults offsetting the vein model were used to offset the geotechnical lithology model. The 
domains were bound near surface to the bottom of an alluvium overburden surface.

13.5 Compositing, Statistics, and Capping 

 
Table 36 and Table 37 summarize the assay statistics for the core and face samples, respectively, 
within the Curraghinalt gold project, tagged by mineralized domains. Table 38 summarizes the 
length statistics of the core sample intervals in the mineralized domains. Given that the average assay 
interval within the modelled veins is 0.32 metres and the relatively thin vein domain widths (see 
Table 38), SRK chose to composite the assays to 0.30 metres. Approximately 51 percent of assay 
samples within mineralized domains measure 0.30 metres or less, including 55 percent of the core 
samples and 28 percent of the face samples.

Table 39 summarizes the uncapped and capped statistics of these composites. SRK analyzed the 
statistics on the basis of domains and data source, and found that the core and face composites data 
vary significantly in summary statistics. As such, capping was performed on a by-domain basis and 
considered core and face composites separately. 
 
Probability plots and sensitivity curves were assessed in order to determine an appropriate capping 
value. Figure 31 shows an example of these plots illustrated for Domain 160 (T17) considering only 
the core composites. Appendix B contains the complete set of probability plots and sensitivity curves 
for all domains by data type. 
 
In addition to gold modelling, SRK was also tasked with estimating sulphur, silver, copper, 
molybdenum, zinc, iron and arsenic. These secondary metals do not contribute to the economic value 
of the gold mineralization, but may impact on process recovery or environmental waste management. 
Silver, copper, molybdenum and zinc were capped by domain and by data type.

13.6 Specific Gravity 

 
Specific gravity was measured by Dalradian at their core logging facility using a standard weight in 
water/weight in air methodology on core from complete sample intervals. The specific gravity 
database contains 3,013 measurements across all veins, representing an almost four-fold increase in 
the database from 2016. Given the larger database, SRK chose to estimate specific gravity within 
each vein into the block model. Compositing of specific gravity was done at a consistent support 
with gold composites. Specific gravity data were capped on a global basis, similar to the approach 
taken in 2016, to avoid any extreme low and/or high values for estimation. Chosen cap values for 
specific gravity are provided in Table 40; the impact of capping on the average specific gravity was 
less than 1 percent for all veins.

13.7 Variography 
 
SRK used the Geostatistical Software Library (GSLib, Deutsch and Journel, 1998) and GSLib-
compatible programs to calculate and model gold variograms for the mineralized domains. Various 
orientations were considered, including those aligned with the intersection of C-veining and the 
domain. Where anisotropy in grade continuity was identifiable, this was found aligned with these 
geological structures. In sparsely sampled domains, SRK grouped adjacent domains to determine a 
regional variogram applicable to the grouped domains. The modelled variograms for gold are 
summarized in Table 41, and in many cases are based on correlograms. As an example, Figure 32 
shows the gold variogram fitted for domain T17 (Code 160).

13.8 Block Model Parameters 
 
A block model was constructed to cover the entire extent of the gold deposits. Block size was set at 5 
by 5 by 5 metres for parent cells, and subcells at 0.50- by 0.25- by 0.50-metre resolution in the X, Y 
and Z axes, respectively, to honour the geometry of the modelled mineralization. Subcells were 
assigned the same grade as the parent cell. No rotation was applied. The block model coordinates are 
based on Irish Grid TM65. The block model definition is summarized in Table 42.

* Irish Grid TM65 

 
 

13.9 Estimation 
 
The block model was populated with gold values using ordinary kriging, informed by composite data 
and three estimation runs with progressively relaxed search ellipsoids and data requirements. 
Table 43 summarizes the search parameters used for each estimation pass for all attributes; these are 
consistent with the parameters used in the 2016 mineral resource model as a result of extensive 
estimation sensitivity analyses. Each domain was estimated using a hard boundary approach using 
only the composites from that domain. A pass "zero" was included to allow the use of the 
underground face samples, within a limited 10-metre radii. Indicator variograms of the face samples 
were calculated to establish that their continuity is limited to 10 metres. All subsequent passes used 
only the capped core borehole composites.

Internal sensitivity studies in 2017 identified the risk of high grade smearing in sparsely sampled 
areas of the modelled veins. This was confirmed in preliminary estimation results. For this reason, a 
secondary, more conservative, capping threshold was applied to core composites for the third 
estimation pass, which is generally the run during which these sparsely sampled areas tend to be 
estimated. The secondary capping thresholds were chosen based on probability plots, in a similar 
way as the primary capping thresholds but looking for changes in the statistical populations at lower 
grades. These secondary capping thresholds are listed in Table 44.

13.10 Block Model Validation 
 
SRK validated the block model using a visual comparison of block estimates and informing 
composites, and statistical comparisons between composites and block model distributions. 
Figure 33 shows an example of a long section for Domain 160 which compares the composite data to 
the estimated block grades, and also the estimation pass to the Indicated/Inferred boundary. Long 
sections for all other domains are provided in Appendix D.

Swath plots considering all domains were generated, along easting, northing and elevation using 20-
metre intervals (see Figure 34). For each swath, SRK compared two composite distributions against 
the block model: (a) all composites (Figure 34, left column), and (b) only the composites from 
boreholes Figure 34, right column). The swath comparisons show that while the face samples were 
used for estimation in a locally constrained manner, the block model grades are mostly influenced by 
the composites from boreholes. As expected, the profiles of the block model grade are smoother than 
that from the composites, but follow along the same general trends.

Additionally, SRK considered statistical comparisons between ordinary kriging estimates and 
alternate estimators at a zero-cut-off grade. Table 45 shows there is less than 4 percent global 
difference in the contained metal between ordinary kriging, and inverse distance weighting to a 
power of two and three estimates at a zero-cut-off grade.

13.11 Classification 
 
Criteria used for block classification are: 
 

• Measured: Blocks estimated in Pass 0, requiring a minimum of two boreholes and a 
minimum of five composites from core and underground face samples. The mean average 
distance of informing composites for this category is less than 20 metres with an average of 
six boreholes informing the blocks in this category. 

• Indicated: Blocks generally estimated in the first pass, with search radii equivalent to the 
variogram range and requiring a minimum of two boreholes. The mean average distance of 
informing composites for this category is less than 50 metres with an average of six 
boreholes informing the blocks in this category. 

• Inferred: Includes all other blocks estimated in the second pass and some blocks estimated 
in the third pass using composites located up to 150 metres away from a borehole. The mean 
average distance of composites for this category is less than 100 metres. 

 
SRK examined the classification visually by inspecting sections and plans through the block model. 
SRK concludes that the parameters used to define Measured blocks reasonably reflect estimates that 
can be considered to be at a high confidence level, material classified as Indicated reflect estimates 
made with a moderate level of confidence within the meaning of CIM Definition Standards for 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014), and all other material is estimated at a lower 
confidence level. Additionally, SRK applied a post-smoothing filter on the classified material to 
ensure continuity within the classification categories. In particular, the boundary between Indicated 
and Inferred is intentionally drawn as parallel or perpendicular to potential underground levels, to 
facilitate underground mine planning. 
 

13.12 Mineral Resource Statement 
 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014) define a 
Mineral Resource as: 
 

"[A] concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's 
crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for

eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other 
geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 
specific geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling."  

 
The "reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction" requirement generally implies that 
quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that mineral resources are 
reported at an appropriate cut-off grade that takes into account extraction scenarios and processing 
recovery. SRK considers that the Curraghinalt deposit is amenable to underground extraction. 
Through discussions with Dalradian, SRK considers that it is reasonable to report as underground 
mineral resources those classified blocks above a cut-off grade of 5.0 g/t gold. This is based on a 
gold price of US$1,200 per troy ounce and a gold recovery of 95 percent. 
 
SRK delivered to Dalradian a sub-block model with a single classification per block and undiluted 
gold grade. The Mineral Resource Statement reported herein is based on an undiluted block model. 
The mineral resource model does not consider a minimum mining width or likely planned dilution 
which will likely be considered during the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves. 
 
SRK is satisfied that the mineral resources were estimated in conformity with the widely accepted 
CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices Guidelines. The mineral 
resources may be affected by further infill and exploration drilling that may result in increases or 
decreases in subsequent mineral resource estimates. The mineral resources may also be affected by 
subsequent assessments of mining, environmental, processing, permitting, taxation, socio-economic, 
and other factors. The Mineral Resource Statement for the Curraghinalt gold project presented in 
Table 46 was prepared by Mr. Dominic Chartier, PGeo (OGQ#874, APGO#2775), Drs. Oy 
Leuangthong, PEng (PEO#90563867) and David Machuca, PEng (PEO#100508889). Mr. Chartier 
and Drs. Leuangthong and Machuca are independent Qualified Persons as this term is defined in 
National Instrument 43-101.  
 
The effective date of the Mineral Resource Statement for the Curraghinalt gold project is May 10, 
2018.

troy ounce and a gold recovery of 95 percent. 

^ Due a reporting discrepancy, the Measured resources reported in the Press 
Release by Dalradian on May 10, 2018 differ nominally to that reported here.  

 
 
For reconciliation purposes, a detailed breakdown of the Mineral Resource Statement by Domain 
and by resource category is provided in Table 47.

* Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability. All figures have been rounded to reflect 

the relative accuracy of the estimates. Underground mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 5.0 g/t gold. The cut-off 
grades are based on a gold price of US$1,200 per troy ounce and a gold recovery of 95 percent. 

 
 

13.13 Grade Sensitivity Analysis 
 
The mineral resources of the Curraghinalt gold project are fairly sensitive to the selection of the 
reporting cut-off grade. To illustrate this sensitivity, block model quantities and grade estimates at 
various cut-off grades are presented in Table 48 and grade tonnage curves are presented in Figure 35.

13.14 Sensitivity Analysis on Dilution 
 
At the request of Dalradian, SRK considered the impact of potential dilution on the gold grade within 
each modelled domain. Specifically, this involved the conceptual evaluation of mineral resources at a 
minimum of 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.8 metres true widths (minimum mining widths). For each case, 
SRK also considered the impact of assigning a grade of zero or a constant grade of 0.25 g/t gold to 
the host rock as a check on the sensitivity of dilution grade to reported tonnage and gold grades.  
 
The impact of dilution on conceptual combined mineral resource reporting to each minimum width 
scenario is tabulated in Table 49 to Table 53, whereas a detailed tabulation summary of the impact 
the dilution scenarios to each domain is provided in Appendix E. 
 
As expected, increasing the minimum mining width results in lower contained metal for all mineral 
resource category blocks. Assuming a dilution grade of zero, the loss of metal content in the 
Measured plus Indicated mineral resources categories ranges from 18 percent, for the 1.0 metre 
minimum mining width scenario, up to approximately 40 percent for the 1.8 metres minimum 
mining width scenario. 
 
Assuming a dilution grade of 0.25 g/t gold, the loss of metal content in the Measured plus Indicated 
mineral resources categories ranges from 17 percent, for the 1.0 metre minimum mining width 
scenario, up to approximately 38 percent for the 1.8 metres minimum mining width scenario.

13.15 Reconciliation with 2016 Mineral Resource Statement 
 
For comparison, the May 5, 2016 Mineral Resource Statement, generated by SRK, is presented in 
Table 54. Table 55 shows the reconciliation between the May 5, 2016 and the May 10, 2018 mineral 
resource statements.  
 
Dalradian drilled an additional 145 boreholes for 46,487 metres of drilling since the May 2016 
resource model, an increase of 35 percent more drilling. The step out boreholes in Dalradian's drill 
program largely contributed to the extension of existing veins to the west and the introduction of four 
new veins in the south. The re-interpretation of the vein wireframes from vein intervals as defined in 
sampled assays, and not 0.5-metre composites, has the impact of reducing vein domain thickness to 
an average of 0.47 metres. This is accompanied by an increase in the average grade of each vein 
domain. Modelled vein domain wireframes delineate in-situ gold grade and do not consider a 
minimum mining width or likely planned mining dilution, which will likely be considered during the 
conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves.  
 
The general estimation methodology did not change in 2018; however, some veins in the south such 
as Crow vein benefited from the infill drilling at depth. The overall impact of the additional step-out 
and infill drilling and updated vein models is a moderate increase in Indicated and Inferred tonnages, 
accompanied by a significant increase in average grade, resulting in a significant increase in 
Indicated and Inferred metal. There is also some slight gain in Measured quantities, and this is 
largely due to 36 percent more underground face and channel samples relative to 2016. The 
additional drilling also delineated areas of considerable exploration potential to be targeted in future 
drilling campaigns. 
 

13.16 SRK Comment 
 
Considering the variable, but generally narrow width of the vein hosted gold mineralization at 
Curraghinalt, SRK consider it important for Dalradian to evaluate the performance of the mineral 
resource model at stope designs and widths envisaged for the estimation of mineral reserves. This 
evaluation could include the reconciliation of the results of the 2016 test stoping on the V75 vein 
with the updated mineral resources and mineral reserves to be disclosed in the forthcoming 
feasibility study, but also the consideration of additional future test stoping on other veins 
characterized by different width and geometry attributes. The objective would be to assess the 
performance of the modeled veins to a wide spectrum of practical mining outcomes.

14 Mineral Reserve Estimates 
 
In January 2017, Dalradian disclosed the results of a feasibility study detailing additional 
exploration, hydrogeology, rock and soil geotechnical work, metallurgical and geochemical 
characterization of the gold mineralization and the waste rock, and mine engineering studies to 
design a new underground mine and mill complex targeting the mineral resources disclosed on May 
5, 2016, and its economic viability was evaluated at a feasibility level (JDS, 2017). The 2016 mineral 
resource evaluation is now obsolete and is replaced by the mineral resource evaluation reported 
herein. 
 
The updated mineral resource statement reported herein, along with an improved geotechnical study 
and ore sorting testwork, will support an ongoing updated feasibility study initiated by Dalradian. In

24 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
Exploration core drilling on the Northern Ireland gold project has focussed on the Curraghinalt gold 
deposit with the majority of boreholes drilled from the surface. The database used to evaluate the 
mineral resources of the Curraghinalt gold deposit includes 731 core boreholes (178,130 metres) and 
678 underground channels/faces (2,397 metres). An additional 145 core boreholes for 46,487 metres 
and 181 underground channels/faces for 535 metres were drilled or sampled since the 2016 mineral 
resource model, representing a 35 percent increase to the borehole database by meterage. This new 
information considerably improves the confidence in the overall quality of the exploration database 
and in the continuity of the gold mineralization. 
 
SRK witnessed the extent of the exploration work and can confirm that Dalradian's exploration work 
is conducted using field procedures that meet generally accepted industry best practices. SRK is of 
the opinion that the exploration data are sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence the 
boundaries of the gold mineralization and support the evaluation and classification of mineral 
resources in accordance with generally accepted CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve Best Practices and CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves. 
 
The bulk of the gold mineralization is hosted in a stacked network of narrow quartz-carbonate-
sulphide veins. Twenty-one vein resource domains were modelled on the extents of logged gold 
mineralized shear veins (D veins), and snapped to assays irrespective of gold grades. The vein 
wireframes were offset by the four main observed faults. Extensive geostatistical studies were 
carried out on the composited data to select capping levels, and derive estimation parameters. Gold, 
sulphur, silver were estimated into a block model using ordinary kriging informed from capped 
composited data. A density was estimated into each block. 
 
The block model was classified using a combination of tools, including confidence in the geological 
interpretation, search radii, minimum number of boreholes and composites, variography, and 
estimation pass. A Measured category was assigned to blocks within a 10 by 10 by 10 metres search 
radii around the underground workings informed by core and/or underground channel/face samples. 
An Indicated classification was assigned to blocks estimated in the first pass, using a minimum of 
two boreholes. The mean average distance of informing composites for Indicated blocks is 50 
metres; while on average, these blocks are informed by six boreholes. All other blocks not classified 
as Measured or Indicated, whose grade was estimated in a vein domain with composites located up 
to 150 metres away from a borehole, were classified as Inferred. Overall, the mean average distance 
of composites in this category is less than 100 metres. All other blocks estimated were unclassified.  
 
The re-interpretation of the vein wireframes from vein intervals as defined in sampled assays, and 
not 0.5-metre composites such as the 2016 study, has the impact of reducing vein domain thickness 
to an average of 0.47 metres. This is accompanied by an increase in the average grade of each vein 
domain. Modelled vein domain wireframes delineate in-situ gold grade and do not consider a 
minimum mining width or potential planned mining dilution, which will likely be considered during 
the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves. 
 
The general estimation methodology did not change in 2018; however, some veins in the south such 
as Crow vein benefited from the infill drilling at depth. The overall impact of the additional step-out 
and infill drilling and updated vein models is a moderate increase in Indicated and Inferred tonnages, 
accompanied by a significant increase in average grade, resulting in a significant increase in

Indicated and Inferred metal. The additional drilling also delineated areas of considerable exploration 
potential to be targeted in future drilling campaigns.

25 Recommendations 
 
The updated mineral resource statement reported herein, along with an improved geotechnical study 
and ore sorting testwork, will support an ongoing updated feasibility study initiated by Dalradian. 
With material exploration activities concluded, the authors of this report are not in a position to make 
meaningful recommendations for further work on the project until the results of the updated 
feasibility study have been disclosed.
