Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report

1. SUMMARY 

The Dolores Project ("the Project"), located in western Chihuahua, Mexico, is being developed 
as an open pit heap leach gold and silver mine by Minefinders Corporation Ltd. through its 
wholly-owned subsidiary Compania Minera Dolores, S.A. de C.V. ("CMD").  The Dolores 
project is nearing the end of construction and will begin production within the next couple of 
months. 
 
Gustavson Associates, LLC ("Gustavson") has been requested by Minefinders Corporation Ltd. 
to prepare an Independent Technical Report compliant with NI 43-101 on the Dolores Property. 
Purpose of the report is to provide a new Mineral Reserve estimate and production schedule 
based on new economic parameters, for Minefinders' Dolores gold and silver project in 
Chihuahua, Mexico. The work completed by Gustavson is based on an updated Mineral 
Resource estimate that was completed by Minefinders and audited by Chlumsky, Armbrust and 
Meyer, LLC ("CAM") on July 26,  2007.   
 
William J. Crowl, VP Mining and Donald E. Hulse, Principal Mine Engineer, are Qualified 
Persons as defined by NI43-101, are employed by Gustavson and carried out a site visit on 
March 1 through 3, 2008.  All aspects and areas of the project were visited.  Terre Lane, Senior 
Mine Engineer employed by Gustavson was responsible for auditing the resource estimate and 
creating the mine plan, mining sequence, and operating cost estimate. Discussions were held 
with on site staff and at Gustavson's Boulder office with Don Hulse, then Manager Technical 
Services of CMD, Thomas Matthews (Consulting Geologist for CMD) and Gregg Bush (VP 
Operations for Minefinders Corporation, Ltd). 
 
1.1 Property Description 

The Dolores project is located in the Sierra Madre Occidental Range in the State of Chihuahua, 
northern Mexico at Latitude 29Â° 00' North, Longitude 108Â°32' West. It is about 94 km by road 
(45 km by air) southwest of the town of Madera, and 250 km west of the city of Chihuahua. 
Mineral rights to the Dolores Project lie in mining concessions which cover the entire mineral 
resource area and are controlled by Minefinders through CMD. CMD directly owns the Dolores, 
Silvia, and Unificacion Real Cananea concessions. The latter was formed in 2006 by legal 
amalgamation of seven small concessions.  Total area of concessions under control of 
Minefinders remains 27,700 hectares. All concessions are in good standing. Surface-rights 
agreements have been negotiated with surface owners. 
 
1.2 Access and Local Conditions 

The property is accessed via a recently completed/upgraded 92-km access road suitable for truck 
traffic from Yepachi, Chihuahua.  Alternative access is via dirt roads from Madera or light 
aircraft landing on a dirt landing strip located about 8 km from the mine site.  Topography is 
rugged, with elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters. Vegetation is characteristic of the 
Sierra Madre, with thorny plants and cacti, replaced by oak and pine forests at higher  elevations. 
The climate is typical of the Sierra Madre with an average temperature of 18Â° C, lows of -10Â° C 
and highs of 45Â° C. Precipitation averages 250mm, most of it occurring from July to September 
as brief heavy rainstorms. Snowfall is common in December and January but does not remain on

the ground for long. Water is available from a small local reservoir, from underground workings, 
and from Rio Tutuaca.  
 
Construction of the mine plant is presently nearing completion, including crushing facilities, 
leach pad, conveying and stacking, solution ponds, Merryl Crowe and refining facilities, shops, 
permanent campsite, and power generation and distribution.  Pre-production mining (road 
pioneering) is taking place, with an effort to pre-strip waste and avoid ore which would require 
stockpiling. 
 
The village of Dolores occupies an area directly over the southern extend of the mineral 
resource. The agreement between Minefinders and Ejido Huizopa allows for the relocation of the 
village. New homes for the villagers have been completed about three kilometers from the mine 
site.  Residents of the village are in the process of moving. 
 
1.3 History 

Mining in the Dolores region started in the 1800's. Mechanized production occurred between 
1915 and 1929, with no records of any production since that time. Incomplete mining records 
from 1922 to 1931 indicate that total production during this time was about 372,000 tonnes of 
ore containing over 116,000 ounces of gold and 6 million ounces of silver. Most of this 
production came from several underground stope mine operations within and beyond the Dolores 
resource study area. 
 
The district then remained idle until 1993 when Minefinders began acquiring a land position. 
Drilling started in 1996, with a total of over 200,000 meters of combined core and reverse 
circulation drilling in 850 holes to June of 2007.  A joint venture with Echo Bay Mines lasted 
less than a year during 1996-97. Several independent mineral Resource estimates of the Dolores 
property were prepared between 1997 and 2007, showing an increasing mineral inventory as 
drilling progressed. A complete bankable level feasibility study for the project was prepared by 
Kappes, Cassiday and Associates ("KCA") in 2006, and project construction is taking place at 
the site now.  Pre-production stripping is proceeding concurrent with construction.  The first gold 
and silver production is expected in the second quarter of 2008. 
 
1.4 Geology and Mineralization 

The Dolores gold-silver deposit in the Sierra Madre Occidental is a low- to medium-sulfidation 
epithermal deposit hosted in andesite volcanic rocks of the Lower Volcanic Series of Tertiary 
age.  Mineralization is present in a NNW-striking, steeply-dipping structural zone, and is 
concentrated in fractures and stock works that lie within and adjacent to latite dikes. The deposit 
shows characteristics similar to economic deposits in volcanic rocks of Tertiary age in Mexico, 
South America, Indonesia and elsewhere.  Gold and silver mineralization is present in veins, 
silica stockworks, breccias and replacements.  Deeper mineralization tends to be preferentially in 
high-grade structurally controlled zones that evolve into wider stockworks, veinlets and 
disseminations at higher elevations.  Mineralization is limited to the lowermost portion of the 
less competent, more permeable, overlying latite flows and tuffs that overlie the andesitic host 
rocks. Minerals present include galena, sphalerite, stibnite, arsenopyrite pyrite, silver sulfides, 
native silver and visible gold.  Clay-illite-hematite alteration with no significant gold or silver

values (commonly referred to as "steam heated" alteration) also is present above and lateral to 
mineralized zones and is a characteristic feature of this type of epithermal mineralization. 
 
The mineralization considered here occurs in an area over 4,000 meters long and up to 1,000 
meters wide, with over 700 meters of vertical extent. The bulk of the deposit is high in the 
system where feeders widen into breccias and stockworks up to a few hundred meters wide that 
form halos around the main structures. Grades in the feeders are in the ranges of 10 to 30 g/t gold 
and 300 to more than 1,000 g/t silver. Disseminated mineralization that lies adjacent to high 
grade feeder structures at upper levels, has lower grades in the range of 0.3 to 2 g/t gold and up 
to 150 g/t silver. The width of coherent mineralization commonly is about 200 up to 300 meters 
wide, and lies in zones that trend NNW and dip steeply to the west. 
 
Some vein and disseminated gold-silver mineralization is known to extend in a NNW and SSE 
direction beyond the limits of the resource estimate area. This mineralization may be considered 
exploration potential and may eventually be classed as Resource.  
 
1.5 Drilling 

No new drill data has been included in this study. Minefinders Mineral Resource estimate has not 
changed since it was last audited by CAM in July 2007.  Sixteen reverse circulation holes and 
thirteen diamond drill holes were not included in the CAM audit because the results were not 
available at that time.  Gustavson has not modified the earlier resource estimate and has not 
included these drill holes in its analysis.  Current drilling is designed to expand the known 
resource at Dolores and does not impact or otherwise influence the minable mineral reserves 
considered here. 
 
1.6 Sampling and Assaying 

CAM reported in its NI43-101 compliant audit that logging and sampling procedures in 2006-7 
followed industry-standard norms, as did apparently earlier drilling campaigns. CAM concluded 
QA/QC used by the analytical laboratories and by Minefinders protocols are appropriate and 
conform to common industry practice.   
 
1.7 Metallurgical Testing 

In 2006, KCA reviewed bench-scale tests of column leaching by cyanide on Dolores samples. 
The gold and silver recoveries varied by rock alteration type and in some cases grade.  
Minefinders summarized these recoveries and provided that information to Gustavson as a basis 
for its work.  No additional metallurgical test work has been conducted since the 2006 report. 
 
1.8 Mineral Resource Estimation 

The Minefinders mineral resource was audited in July 2007 by CAM.   Minefinders provided 
Gustavson with the audited resource block model, from which Gustavson developed the minable 
reserves and production schedule.  Gustavson was not charged with validating or verifying the 
previously audited resource estimate.  Gustavson used a re-blocked resource model to more 
closely represent current mining practice and the equipment fleet now mining the deposit.  



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 4 Gustavson Associates 

Gustavson investigated the re-blocked model tonnage and grade to verify that the re-blocked 
model represents minable units.  
 
CAM stated "the geologic model developed by Minefinders is appropriate for the Mineral 
Resource estimate, as it is based upon geologic data obtained from surface and underground 
geologic mapping; and from well documented sub-surface features obtained from detailed 
geologic logging of 850 reverse circulation and diamond drill core holes." 
 
Minefinders' Mineral Resource estimates, as audited and publicly released on June 12, 2007, are 
shown in Tables 1-1 and 1-2.  The Mineral Resource is shown by AuEq cutoff Measured and 
Indicated categories in Table 1-3.

1.9 Gustavson Associates Reserve Audit 

Gustavson verified the reserve model by re-estimating the grade using longer composite intervals 
and alternative modeling techniques.  Results indicate the Minefinders mineral resource estimate 
is reasonable.  Reblocking the resource model to 6x10x7.5 meter blocks appears to produce 
selective mining unit grades similar to other estimation methods.  Gustavson recommends 
closely monitoring mine production and reconciling it to the block model.   Modifying the model 
as needed, to match actual mining practice and production data will help create the best possible 
production planning tools. 
 
The Dolores mineral reserve estimate was created and modeled using Datamine's version 4.0 
(release 1740.7) NPV scheduler.  The re-blocked resource model was used for the optimization 
analysis using the Datamine economic pit limit optimizer.   Gustavson ran the model utilizing 
incremental profit factors from 1% to 100% (full value) of the calculated block value to create 
shells of increasing total value and decreasing marginal value.  Gustavson used pit 38 shell as a 
basis for final pit design with haul roads.  
 
Overall, the incremental change going from pit shell 38 to the ultimate pit would require mining 
45% more rock, processing 21% more rock, to increase the life of mine profit by 7%.  Selection 
of this shell gives a more economically robust pit design thus pit shell 38 was selected as the 
basis for final design.   Given the physical topographic constraints on the project, and increased 
risk associated with mining more rock, Gustavson believes the design is prudent. 
 
1.10 Final Pit Design with haul roads 

Gustavson designed the Dolores pit haul roads with a 10% grade and 26 meter overall width.  
6.4m wide catch benches were designed with every other bench (every 15m) having a 67degree 
inter-bench face angle.  Table 1-4 shows the Dolores Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves 
from the final pit design.

The production schedule for the life of the project was created using Datamine NPV Scheduler.  
Optimized extraction sequences were created and used as a basis for design of each mining 
phase. 
 
Rather than balance stripping ratio over the project life, Gustavson balanced truck hours based 
on changing productivity by phase and bench required to deliver rock to their respective dumps 
or primary crusher.   The productivity was then used to determine truck fleet requirements and 
total equipment hours for each time period.  Equipment hours then formed the basis of the 
equipment operating cost estimate. 
 
1.10.1 Life of Mine Production Schedule 

The mine production was scheduled using the phases, balancing equipment hours each time 
period to create the life of mine production schedule as shown in Table 1-5.

1.11 Dolores Project Economics 

Annual cash flow projections were estimated over the life of the mine based on capital 
expenditures, production costs, and sales revenue.  The life of mine is 16 years with some 
residual silver and gold production occurring in year 17. The full reclamation period extends into 
year 17. 



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 9 Gustavson Associates 

A substantial portion of the project capital costs have already been incurred.  The total initial 
capital, including pre-commercial production operating costs and costs already incurred, is 
estimated to be $ 192 million, with $50 million in sustaining capital required over the life of the 
mine.  
 
Unit operating cost will vary by year depending on the mine area, pit-stripping requirements, and 
ore type being processed.  The average operating cost over the life of mine (including startup) is 
estimated to be US$ 9.03 per tonne of ore processed.  Not including start-up costs, direct costs 
total $297 per ounce gold (equivalent) produced.  
 
The economic analysis was developed based on $675 per troy ounce of gold and $13 per troy 
ounce of silver. These metal prices are estimated by Minefinders in accordance with common 
industry practice requiring identification of metal price projections.  Total revenues from the sale 
of gold and silver over the life of mine are $2,023,918,000 based on $675 per troy ounce for gold 
and $13 per troy ounce for silver.   
 
On a pre-tax basis, the project will generate an NPV (at 3% percent discount rate) of $563 
million with an IRR of 26% and a payback of 2 years.  The project is most sensitive to changes 
in metal prices followed by metal production, operating costs, and initial capital costs.   
 
1.12 Conclusions and Recommendations 

Conclusions 
Gustavson has reviewed the work done by Minefinders and CAM and finds both are thorough 
and are well done. 
 
No changes to the Minefinders resource model have occurred since CAM's NI 43-101 compliant 
audit of the Dolores Resource in July 2007.  Based on our review, Gustavson considers that these 
resources are adequate to be used in the estimation of minable reserves and production 
scheduling.  Gustavson has created a NI 43-101 compliant mineral reserve estimate, and 
production schedule based on the CAM audited Resource estimate. 
 
Gustavson used updated cost data and a gold price of $600/oz and a silver price of $10/oz for the 
mine design portions of its evaluation, and $675/oz gold, and $13/oz silver for the economic 
portions of this report. 
 
Gustavson applied reblocking to create blocks 6x10x7.5 meters that represent selective minable 
units approximating current mine practice and the mine equipment fleet. 
 
The proven and probable mineral reserve now contains 99.3 M tonnes at .77 g/t Au and 40g/t Ag 
at a stripping ratio of 3.7:1. 
 
Gustavson and Minefinders have updated the operating and capital costs for the project.  Main 
changes to the operating costs are labor rates, fuel price, reagent costs, and explosives costs.  
 
Gustavson has reviewed Minefinders Capital Costs and cash flow projections and has prepared a 
sensitivity analysis.   



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 10 Gustavson Associates 

Recommendations 
1. Gustavson recommends closely monitoring mine production and reconciling it to the block 
model, modifying the model if needed, using alternative composite lengths and interpolation 
methodologies to match actual mining practice and production data.  
 
2.  Gustavson recommends using geo-statistical methods of mine production planning and grade 
control.  
 
3. The current high metal price ($980Au/$20Ag at the time of writing), and the projected costs 
included in this report, yield economic cutoff grades in the range of 0.15 â€“ 0.21 g/t AuEq.  Using 
a lower cutoff grade (as indicated by current economics) would result in more tonnes of ore 
being available at lower grades.  With fixed throughput in the crushing plant, this lower grade 
would result in lower annual metal production, but longer production life. 
 
Gustavson, recommends investigating the viability of leaching run of mine low grade rock by 
constructing a small (5,000 â€“ 20,000 tonne) test heap on site, to determine leach characteristics 
and potential economics.  A run of mine leach option should be considered in the upcoming 
underground mining / conventional milling study. 
 
4. Gustavson recommends Minefinders investigate the viability of milling higher grade ore.  
Milling will result in increased recovery and better assurance of obtaining the designed recovery. 
This will reduce risk (from coarse gold, sulfide, or other metallurgical issues) associated with 
putting high grade ore on the leach pad and not achieving planned leach recovery. 
 
5. The potential for underground mining deep ore should be investigated.  This work should 
consider trade offs between open pit and underground mining and consider the impact 
underground mining might have on open pit operations.  Underground mining may provide 
benefits to the open pit operation, including dewatering the pit, potentially bypassing open pit 
diversion water through an underground adit.  
 
6. Gustavson's equipment productivity calculations and truck cycle times may be conservative.  
Prior to expansion of the truck fleet in 2010, the actual performance of the mining fleet should be 
analyzed.  There is potential that some of the additional mine haul trucks included in this study 
may not be required for the planned mine production.

2. INTRODUCTION 

Gustavson has been requested by Minefinders Corporation Ltd. to prepare an Independent 
Technical Report compliant with NI 43-101 on the Dolores Property. Purpose of the report is to 
provide a new Reserve estimate and production schedule based on new economic parameters, for 
Minefinders' Dolores gold and silver project in Chihuahua, Mexico. The work completed by 
Gustavson is based on an updated Resource estimate that was completed by Minefinders and 
audited by CAM on July 26,  2007.   
 
William J. Crowl, VP Mining and Donald E. Hulse, Principal Mine Engineer, are Qualified 
Persons as defined by NI43-101, are employed by Gustavson, and carried out a site visit on 
March 1 through 3, 2008.  Mr. Crowl is independent of Minefinders and Mr. Hulse, although 
employed by Gustavson, is not fully independent of Minefinders.  All aspects and areas of the 
project were visited.  Terre Lane, Senior Mine Engineer employed by Gustavson was responsible 
for auditing the resource estimate and creating the mine plan, mining sequence, and operating 
cost estimate. Discussions were held with on site staff and at Gustavson's Boulder office, with 
Don Hulse, then Manager Technical Services, Thomas Mathews, Consulting Geologist and 
Gregg Bush, VP Operations, Minefinders. 
 
3. RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

Various maps and technical reports were provided by Don Hulse in his previous role as 
Technical Services Manager, CMD, Thomas Mathews, and other geological staff of Minefinders. 
Three previous 43-101-compliant reports (CAM July, 2007, Roscoe Postle ("RPA"), 2004  and 
Pincock Allan and Holt ("PAH"), 2002) were reviewed, and are listed in the Reference section. 
Gustavson did not independently verify the boundaries and legal status of the mineral properties, 
the environmental and operating permits, nor did Gustavson conduct an extensive audit of the 
resource estimation other than as it relates to the minablity of the resource. No new data or 
information regarding metallurgical and processing aspects of the project has been created since 
the completion of the 2006 KCA feasibility study.  Gustavson has reviewed historic data and past 
reports and is reporting on project progress since the last pertinent technical report. 
 
4. PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

The Dolores project is located in the Sierra Madre Occidental Range in the State of Chihuahua, 
northern Mexico at Latitude 29Â° 00' North, Longitude 108Â°32' West. It is in the Municipality of 
Madera, about 94 km by road (45 km by air) southwest of the town of Madera, and 250 km west 
of the city of Chihuahua (Figure 4-1).

Mineral rights to the Dolores Project are controlled by three mining concessions shown in Table 
4-1 and Figure 4-2, below. Minefinders, through its wholly owned Mexican subsidiary 
Compania Minera Dolores, S.A. de C. V. (CMD), directly owns the Dolores, Silvia and 
Unificacion Real Cananea concessions. Total area of concessions under control of Minefinders 
remains 27,700 hectares.  
 
As of September 2006, the total payment for the several smaller concessions was completed and 
full title transfers were duly registered and recorded by November of 2006, giving Minefinders 
100 percent interest in all of the properties. The Net Smelter Return (NSR) of 2 percent on silver 
and 3.25 percent on gold production is payable to Royal Gold, Inc. Minefinders confirms this 
royalty ownership and indicates it only applies to the Dolores deposit contained within the 
confines of the Unificacion Real Cananea concession.   There is no royalty on the other two 
concessions, which at this time do not contain reserves.

The three concessions shown on Figure 4-2 and listed in Table 4-1 are contiguous and cover the 
Mineral Resource defined in this study. All claims, license fees and taxes for property owned or 
under the control of Minefinders have been fully paid and are up to date. All concessions have 
been converted to exploitation status. Minefinders reports that surface right agreements have 
been negotiated with Ejido Huizopa, and certain individual members of the Ejido to allow 
Minefinders access and the right to carry out exploration activities up to and including all mining 
operations. (An "ejido" is a uniquely Mexican institution set up by the government during a 
period of land reform. It is a rural agricultural cooperative having well-defined property rights.) 
A new contract with the Ejido, signed in November 2006, terminates the old contract of 1997. 
The new agreement grants Minefinders irrevocable use of land for the mine and roads for a term 
of 15 years with a right to extend for 15 more years. Principal differences from the earlier 
contract are increased cash payments, and other benefits to the Ejido that include construction of 
schools, clinics, sports fields and other infrastructure. Minefinders also agrees to provide 
preferential hiring for jobs and training to members of the Ejido.  
 
The area containing the Dolores Resource as well as the land on which leach pads and processing 
plant lies within the limits of land held by Minefinders.  Lic. Victor Garcia Jimenez, from the 
law firm of Garcia-Jimenez & Asociados, has searched his records as well as those of the 
Mexican Director of Mines, and determined that the concessions are valid and that Minefinders 
is the legal titleholder. The claims are on file in the Municipality of Madera, State of Chihuahua, 
Mexico. CMD reports that the Dolores property is not subject to any environmental liabilities.

The village of Dolores presently occupies an area directly over the southern end of the mineral 
resource.  An agreement between Minefinders and Ejido Huizopa calls for relocation of the 
village.  At the time of writing, the construction of the new town is complete. Many people 
continue to reside in the original town of Dolores, however 12 families have moved to the new 
town.  Another 12 families have moved to Madera, the municipal capital, and CMD is working 
with the balance of families to facilitate the evacuation of the area within the pit. 
 
Minefinders has the land necessary for the current waste dump location and negotiations 
continue for additional land that may be needed for the future expansion of waste dumps.   The 
company expects to complete the negotiations in 2008.

5. ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The property is reached by 92 km of recently upgraded access road from Yepachi, Chihuahua, to 
the mine site and this is now the main road access to the mine and plant.  Access to the property 
can also be achieved by light aircraft landing on a dirt strip located about 8 km from the mine 
site.  
 
The climate is typical of the Sierra Madre with an average temperature of 18Â° C, with lows of -
10Â° and highs of 45Â° C.  Precipitation averages 250mm, most of it occurring from July to 
September as brief heavy rainstorms. Snowfall is common in December and January but does not 
remain on the ground for long.  Vegetation is typical of the foothills of the Sierra Madre and 
includes thorny plants, cacti, with oak and pine forests at higher elevations.  Topography is 
rugged, with elevations ranging from 1,200 to 2,000 meters.  Erosion has resulted in deep V-
shaped valleys and canyons.  
 
The local economy consists of logging, ranching and subsistence farming.  Unskilled workers 
may be found in nearby small villages.  The company has a number of recruiting and training 
programs in place to develop the local workforce.  However, the local population is small and the 
mine work force will have to be supplemented from Chihuahua and Hermosillo, Sonora 350 km 
to the west.  A strong culture of surface mining in both Sonora and Chihuahua states provides a 
pool of experienced workers. 
 
Water is available from wells, from underground workings, and from Rio Tutuaca.  Additional 
water rights have been acquired for the mine and a reservoir is under construction for the primary 
water supply.  Diesel generated power will be required for production facilities.  The mine plant 
is presently under construction and includes crushing facilities, ponds to store solution, an 
extraction plant, shops and a permanent campsite. Leach pads are being constructed as valley 
fills, phase 1A is complete for ore reception.   
 
6. HISTORY 

CAM and others have reported that mining in the Dolores region started with placer mining in 
the 1860's followed by lode mining beginning by 1898.  By 1915, a power line had been 
installed from the town of Madera, and a 25 tpd stamp mill began operation treating the Dolores 
ore.  Pulverized ore was passed through a cyanide leach circuit with zinc precipitation for gold 
and silver recovery.  The stamp mill operated until early 1929 when it was destroyed by fire.  
Only sporadic high-grade production occurred from 1929 to 1931, with no records of any 
production since that time.  Incomplete mining records from 1922 to 1931 indicate that total 
production during this time was about 372,000 tonnes of ore containing over 116,000 ounces of 
gold and 6,000,000 ounces of silver.  This production came from several underground mine 
operations including some beyond the Dolores resource study area.  In 1980, Consejo de 
Recursos Minerales, a Mexican government organization, sampled many of the accessible 
underground workings.

The property essentially remained idle until 1993 when Minefinders began acquiring a land 
position in the district.  The Company initiated a full exploration project in November 1995, and 
drilling started in September 1996, with a total of about 200,000 meters of drilling to June 2007 
with 850 holes of both core and reverse circulation drilling. 
 
In July, 1996, Minefinders granted Echo Bay Mines (Echo Bay) an option to earn 60 percent 
interest in the Dolores Property by participating in a private placement of $5.7 million for the 
first phases of exploration, funding a bankable feasibility study, and paying Minefinders $20/oz 
on 60% of the proven and probable, gold and gold equivalent silver ounces.  In October 1997, 
Minefinders bought-out the Echo Bay interest and owns the property outright subject to the 
underlying agreement.  All data from Echo Bay's complete drilling, sampling, environmental 
data collection, and  metallurgical testing was transferred to Minefinders and in this report is not 
referenced separately as being undertaken by Echo Bay.  Humboldt Mining Services prepared 
independent mineral resource estimates of the Dolores property in August 1997.  In October 
1998, Mineral Resources Development, Inc. (MRDI) of Canada completed a scoping study to 
evaluate development of the Dolores property.  PAH conducted an audit of the Dolores resources 
in December 2002.  Previous historical estimates are listed in Table 6-1.

In November 2002, M3 Engineering and Technology Corporation ("M3") was contracted by 
Minefinders to initiate a series of scoping studies in support of a feasibility study. A complete 
bankable level feasibility study for the project was prepared in June 2005, based upon the results 
of earlier studies.  KCA completed a separate bankable feasibility study in March of 2006 which 
forms the basis for the project now nearing completion.  Additional exploration drilling was

completed in 2006 with the objective of obtaining data that would further enhance quality of the 
Mineral Resource estimate. CAM was engaged in May 2007 to prepare a new audit of the 
Minefinders revised Resource estimation that integrated the newly acquired data.  Gustavson was 
retained in November of 2007 to prepare a reserve estimate and production schedule based on 
the audited Minefinders April 2007 mineral resource.   
 
7. GEOLOGIC SETTING 

 
Descriptions of regional geology, property geology, deposit types and mineralization are from  
the published paper by Overbay and others (2001) and appear here in italics. 
 
7.1 Regional Geology 

The Sierra Madre Occidental (Figure 7-1) is a 1,200 by 300 km northwest-trending mountain system, and 
features a long northwest-trending volcanic plateau within a very broad anticlinal uplift. Regional 
geology is dominated by large-volume rhyolitic ash flow tuffs emanating from calderas of Oligocene age 
(35 to 27 million years), the Upper Volcanic Series. These volcanic rocks are generally calc-alkalic 
rhyolitic ignimbrites with subordinate andesite, dacite, and basalt, with a cumulative thickness of up to 
1,000 meters. The Upper Volcanic Series unconformably overlies rocks of the slightly older Lower 
Volcanic Series that are primarily of andesite composition with interlayered felsic ash flow tuff deposits 
that formed from 46 to 35 million years ago (Eocene time). 
 
Deposition of the Lower Volcanic Series was accompanied by emplacement of hornblende-bearing quartz 
diorite and granodiorite batholiths and small intrusive bodies. The majority of the epithermal and 
porphyry related precious-metals deposits in the Sierra Madre Occidental are hosted in the Lower 
Volcanic Series. Thin basalt to rhyodacite flows of late Miocene and younger age cap many of the 
plateaus and hills in the region. The Baucarit formation, a conglomeratic, basin fill sedimentary unit 
intercalated with several thin basalt flows, was deposited during Pliocene and Pleistocene time.  
 
The oldest structural episode is related to the Laramide orogeny, which produced east-striking, steeply 
dipping strike-slip faults. Later extensional forces resulted in development of N-S to N30W striking, sub-
vertical, dip-slip normal faults of regional extent that produced a series of parallel to sub parallel west-
dipping fault planes showing only limited horizontal displacement. Following these two events, NW-
trending extensional forces resulted in development of N60E oriented normal faults. Structures developed 
in the Dolores area are believed to have controlled emplacement of a series of NNW- trending andesite to 
latite intrusions. Zones of permeability associated with these faults and intrusive contacts formed 
conduits for the ascending mineralizing hydrothermal fluids. 
 
7.2 Local Geology 

The Dolores project is underlain by the two main volcanic packages. The Lower Volcanic Series, consists 
of gently tilted lavas, flow breccia, and tuffaceous rocks with a minimum thickness of 700 meters. It is 
conformably overlain by 100 to 200 meters of felsic latite volcaniclastic breccia.  These units are overlain 
by the Upper Volcanic Series, which is a sub-horizontal volcaniclastic assemblage of mostly felsic 
ignimbrites and tuffs. The Upper and Lower Volcanic Series are separated by an unconformity (Figure 7-
2) that is manifest by a distinctive multilithic, poorly consolidated rubble zone of probable colluvial 
origin. This erosional surface formed after development of a NNW-trending anticlinal uplift. Subsequent 
erosion formed a window exposing mineralized rocks of the Lower Volcanic Series in the Dolores district.  



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 19 Gustavson Associates 

7.3 Property Geology 

The Tertiary Upper Volcanic Series consists of felsic ignimbrites, volcanic breccias, tuffs and flows 
(Figures 7-2 and 7-3). Individual felsic units vary from stratified, poorly-lithified tuff to strongly-welded 
volcaniclastic rocks with interlayered tuffaceous conglomerate and breccia. All the units exposed are 
unsorted and range from unstratified to stratified with monolithic to multilithic compositons. The Tertiary 
Lower Volcanic Series (Figure 7-3) forms a varied package of volcanic rocks. Exposed rocks include 
light-colored coarse lithic lapilli tuff with fragments contained within a non-welded matrix, and latite 
flow rocks of porphyritic character with phenocrysts of K-feldspar and plagioclase.

8. DEPOSIT TYPES 

Gold and silver mineralization at Dolores is present as low to medium sulfidation, gold-silver bearing, 
veins, silica stockworks, breccias and replacements (Figure 9-1). The system is mostly structure-
controlled in a NNW striking extensional fault system. Mineralization occurs as fine-grained quartz-
adularia veins, breccia fill and stockworks in the competent andesite flows of the Lower Volcanic Series. 
Relatively deep mineralization tends to be preferentially in high-grade veins. At higher elevations these 
feeder veins grade into wider stockworks, veinlet and disseminations toward the less competent, more 
permeable, overlying latite flows and tuffs of the Lower Volcanic Series. Near surface mineralization 
shows a strong element of structural control, but mineralization widens out owing to development of 
breccia and fractures adjacent to the main mineralized conduits. Steam-heated clay-illite-hematite 
alteration with no significant gold or  silver values also is present at the surface and is a characteristic 
feature of this type of epithermal mineralization.  
 
Deposits with features discussed above are present through the Sierra Madre Occidental as shown in 
Figure 4-1, and as characterized by Albinson and others (2001). Numerous productive districts are of this 
type.  
 
 
9. MINERALIZATION 

Gold and silver mineralization identified at surface lies in an area over 4,000 meters long and up to 
1,000 meters wide at elevations from 1,100 meters to 1,700 meters above sea level (Figure 7-2). 
Mineralization has been investigated to the depth of drilling at 1,000 meters elevation or over 700 meters 
of vertical extent (Figure 9-1). The extent of mineralization at depth has not been fully defined. 
Mineralization in feeder structures at depth ranges up to five to ten meters wide in tight quartz stockwork 
and mineralized fractures. The bulk of the deposit is high in the system where feeders widen into breccias 
and stockworks up to a few hundred meters wide that form halos around the main structures. Grades in 
the feeders are in the ranges of 10 to 30 g/t gold and 300 to more than 1,000 g/t silver. Disseminated 
mineralization that lies adjacent to high grade feeder structures at upper levels, has lower grades in the 
range of 0.3 to 2 g/t gold and up to 150 g/t silver. The width of coherent mineralization commonly is 
about 200 up to 300 meters wide, and lies in zones that trend NNW and dip steeply to the west. Some vein 
and disseminated gold-silver mineralization is known to extend in a NNW and SSE direction beyond the 
limits of the Resource estimate area, and this mineralization may be considered exploration potential and 
may eventually be included in the resource. 
 
Breccia bodies range from true tectonic breccias cemented by quartz to hydrothermal breccias showing 
streaming textures.  Breccias show evidence of episodic mineralization and re-cementation by quartz, 
adularia, and calcite veining.  Mineralization at Dolores is accompanied by quartz-adularia alteration.  
Locally pervasive silica alteration is closely associated with structures and may contain up to four 
percent fine-grained pyrite.  Quartz textures are fine-gained to drusy encrustations in breccias. Areas of 
intense propylitic alteration are high in gold and silver values in some areas.  Mineralization is generally 
associated with quartz and may be composed primarily of iron-oxides, silver sulfosalts, electrum, and 
native gold where oxidized grading into pyrite, silver sulfides, native silver and visible gold with 
increased galena, and sphalerite at depth.  Other associated gangue minerals include sericite, illite, 
rhodochrosite, fluorite, chlorite, epidote and various secondary minerals. 
 
Well-defined geochemical zonation patterns are characteristic with Sb, and As occurring high in the 
system and Pb, and Zn base metal mineralization increasing at depth.  Combined percentages of Pb and

Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 24 Gustavson Associates 

Zn at elevations below the 1350 meter level locally exceed 3 to 10% and may be of future economic 
interest but are not included in this resource estimation. 
 
Alteration zones include argillization along margins of the feeder structures, various intensities of 
propylitic (chlorite-epidote-calcite-pyrite) alteration of the volcanic wall rocks, as well as a regional low-
grade propylitic overprint in the volcanic host rocks.  The hydrothermal propylitic alteration related to 
mineralization is pyritic and relatively coarse grained.  Latite porphyry magmas are thought to be 
genetically related to emplacement of the epithermal veins.  The regional structural system controls both 
emplacement of latite dikes and fluid flow related to mineralization.  Strongest controls on mineralization 
are contact zones between intrusive latite and the andesite wallrocks where development of fractures and 
brecciation are focused.  Mineralization is the result of ascending epithermal fluids that undergo cooling 
by fluid mixing, repeated boiling and throttling, and subsequent decompression and mineral deposition.  
Patches of steam-heated alteration with kaolin-illite-hematite alteration and not carrying gold-silver 
values is present in the non-welded latite tuff breccias and flows of the Lower Volcanic Series.  Oxidation 
of mineralization is highly variable throughout the deposit and has been noted to the full depth of drilling 
along structures.  The deposit can be regarded as having variable amounts of oxide and mixed oxide-
sulfide grading into sulfide with depth.

10. EXPLORATION 

Exploration drilling now occurring at Dolores is intended to expand the resource below and 
peripheral to the open pit mine.  CAM reported in their audit that no assays determined prior to 
Minefinders' tenure on the property have been used in preparation of their report.  No changes to 
the resource model have occurred since CAM's audit of the Resource in July 2007.   
 
During 1994, Minefinders carried out limited  initial mapping and sampling to evaluate the 
Dolores property.  Since November 1995, the property has been subject to extensive geological, 
geochemical and geophysical surveys and exploratory drilling to identify drilling targets.  define 
a mineralized gold and silver system.  Additionally, surface and underground sampling has 
exceeded 10,000 rock chip samples.  
 
The following sections of this report have been extracted from the July 2007 CAM Technical 
Report and are italicized.  Gustavson considers CAM's description of the Dolores exploration 
programs remain valid. 
 
Minefinders carried out more than six square kilometers of detailed mapping and 12 square kilometers of 
reconnaissance mapping.  Geophysical surveys have included 14.9 kilometers of induced polarization, 
resistivity surveys, and magnetic surveys.  Results of these surveys are not considered material to the 
resource estimates, and were not reviewed by CAM.  Since 1993 all exploration work, including mapping, 
sampling, drilling and geophysical studies have been under direct supervision of Minefinders personnel.  
 
10.1 Exploration Potential 

Deep mineralization below the current pit limit, where core intercepts have returned results, 
which with further testing, may prove to be of high enough grade to support underground 
development. Mineralization is contained within a multilithic breccia, and consists of galena, 
sphalerite  silver sulfides, electrum, and native gold occurring in the matrix and open spaces of 
the breccia. Drill testing will continue in an attempt to determine continuity of grade and 
mineralization . 
  
Recent drilling within the area of the East Dike satellite deposit returned ore grade results over 
minable widths.  The exposed mineralization consists of structurally controlled zones of 
stockwork veining hosted by intrusive latite, with drill results indicating wider zones at near 
surface depths. This new drilling will allow for incorporation of this satellite deposit into future 
mine plans.  The East Dike satellite deposit is located within 200 meters of the east flank of the 
current pit. 
   
Drilling indicates continuation of the main Dolores mineralized zones to the south beyond the 
area of the current pit.  Mineralization  consists of stockworks and vein style high grade 
mineralization. Limited drilling in this area has indicated expanded zones at depth with further 
testing required to determining overall grades and tons.

11. DRILLING 

Gustavson did not specifically audit the Minefinders Mineral Resource estimate because it had 
not changed since it was last audited by CAM in July 2007.  Italicized paragraphs in this section 
are taken directly from the CAM report.   Sixteen reverse circulation holes and thirteen diamond 
drill holes were not included in the CAM audit because the results were not available at that 
time.  Gustavson has not included these drill holes, and has not modified the earlier resource 
estimate.  Current drilling is designed to expand the known resource at Dolores and does not 
impact or otherwise influence the minable reserves considered here. 
 
11.1 Geologic Logging 

Logging drill core and chips is carried out by a degreed geologist, assisted by field technicians, under 
supervision by the principal site geologist. Logging sheets for core holes show core recoveries throughout 
each hole. Space is provided for a narrative description of rock type, color, textures, structures, 
alteration and mineralization. Continuous graphic logs show distribution of rock type, structure and 
mineralization. Space is provided to record on a scale of one to five (weak to intense or pervasive) 
brecciation, fractures, veins (quartz, calcite, epidote), alteration (silica, argillic, propylitic), oxidation 
(pervasive vs. fracture controlled), sulfides (pyrite, galena, sphalerite), oxide minerals (goethite, 
hematite, jarosite, Mn-oxides), and sample number. Samples generally are taken over two meter lengths. 
CAM checked a few logs to see that contacts shown on logs were accurately located on cross sections, 
and the contacts were found to be accurate. Senior members of the geologic staff determine boundaries of 
rock types and of mineralization that become part of the geologic model for resource estimation. Data for 
the geologic model includes surface mapping and sampling, underground mapping and sampling, 
contacts from drill logs, and drill samples.  
 
Logging sheets of reverse circulation drill holes record 1.5-meter sample intervals with sample numbers. 
Space is provided for recording rock type, color, oxidation; and on a scale of one to five as above, 
alteration (silica, argillic and propylitic), veins (quartz, calcite, epidote), sulfides (pyrite), and oxide 
minerals (goethite, hematite and jarosite). Penetration rate is recorded and space is available for a 
written description of rock mineralization and alteration. It is our opinion that all geologic logging was 
carried out in a detailed and professional manner and the geologic data that was used to create a 
geologic model for the resource estimate is accurate and exceeds industry standards.  
 
11.2 Collar Surveys 

For more than 95 percent of drill holes, Minefinders used either a total station or multi-station GPS unit 
to locate collar coordinates. An additional 3 percent of drill holes are located on pads with previously 
surveyed holes. The remaining holes were located by tape-and-brunton survey from previously surveyed 
collars. Brunton-surveyed holes are assumed to be accurate to within five meters, co-located holes to 
within three meters, and surveyed holes to within less than one meter. 
 
11.3 Down Hole Surveys 

About 86 percent of DDH holes prior to 2002 and 100 percent of drilling from 2002 forward were 
surveyed using an Ausmin or Sperry-Sun single-shot camera at down-hole intervals of 25 to 30 meters. 
Only 13 percent of RC drilling prior to 2002 was surveyed down hole. RC holes drilled between 2002 and 
2004 were surveyed down hole using a Tropari instrument. For the unsurveyed RC holes and the 19 
unsurveyed DDH holes of the early campaigns, Minefinders has applied a wander correction based on 



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 28 Gustavson Associates 

drill hole deviation patterns of nearby holes. Thus the holes can be plotted with relatively high accuracy 
to determine the true widths of intercepts of mineralized structures. 
 
CAM conclude that the drilling and logging procedures used on the project in 2006 and 2007 were of 
industry standard. 
 
11.4 Drilling Results 

Many of the 2006-2007 holes intersected significant mineralization. A sampling of these intercepts are 
shown on Table 11-2, as extracted from a Minefinders press release dated 24 April 2007.  
 
12. SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

No changes to the sampling procedures have occurred since the CAM report.  Additionally no 
new assay data is available that would materially affect the resource estimate done by 
Minefinders and audited by CAM.  Gustavson is relying on the data prepared and presented by 
Minefinders and audited by at least three other independent engineering firms.  During the site 
visit, Gustavson briefly reviewed Minefinders' sampling methods and their approach and found 
them to be as reported previously. 
 
13. SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 

No changes to the sample preparation, analysis procedures or security have occurred since the 
CAM report.  Additionally no new assay data is available that would materially affect the 
resource estimate done by Minefinders and audited by CAM.  Gustavson is relying on the data 
prepared and presented by Minefinders and audited by at least three other independent 
engineering firms.  During the site visit, Gustavson briefly reviewed Minefinders' sample 
preparation, analysis procedures and security methods and found them to be as reported 
previously. 
 
14. DATA VERIFICATION 

14.1 Data Verification by Gustavson 

Gustavson ran its standard data validation on the block model provided by Minefinders to ensure 
that the model contained the same data as had been audited by CAM.  Gustavson reported the 
total tonnes and grade and compared that to the previously reported resource to confirm that the 
models were the same. 
 
15. ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The entire area discussed in this report is controlled by Minefinders.  There are no adjacent 
properties as defined by NI 43-101. No data from other properties has been used. 
 
16. MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

There has been no new data generated nor changes in metallurgical testing results since last 
reported by KCA on April 11, 2006  and repeated below (KCA, 2006).  KCA considered the 
samples tested to be representative of all rock types, oxidation levels, and grades of

mineralization for the deposit.  A detailed metallurgical testing program was completed.  An 
additional series of column leach tests on andesite and latite oxide, mixed and sulfide ores were 
in-progress at McClelland Laboratories.  The recoveries and reagent consumptions were based 
on an extensive review of test results by M3, McClelland, Minefinders  and KCA, and 
documented by M3 in their bankable feasibility study.  In KCA's opinion the recoveries and 
reagent consumptions used were justifiable.  The recoveries are summarized in Table 16-1.

17. MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

Gustavson reviewed Dolores resource estimation methods and potential issues including 
composite length, interpolation methodology and treatment of mineralized envelopes.  
 
Minefinders used 2 meter down hole composites and inverse distance to the fifth power (ID5) 
interpolation to create a geologic and grade models of the deposit.  Minefinders used the ID5 
estimation to closely match the block grade distribution to the composite data.  Minefinders goal 
was to create a model of the mineralization that could be utilized for both open pit and 
underground mine planning and reserve estimation.   
 
17.1 Past Resource Estimation. 

No changes to the resource model have occurred since CAM's audit of the Resource in July 
2007.  CAM reported in their audit that the parameters for the April 2007 mineral resource 
estimate were exactly the same as the parameters used for the NI 43-101 compliant resource 
estimate audited by RPA (Report of November 16, 2004) with the following exceptions: 
 
â€¢ The April 2007 resource estimate includes the results of additional drill holes which had not 

been completed for the October 2004 estimate. 
â€¢ Solids models were edited and adjusted to incorporate new information provided by drilling 

subsequent to the October 2004 estimate. 
â€¢ The block model was expanded to include material from 1000m to 1100m elevation 

(previous minimum block model elevation was 1100 meters) to allow for inclusion of data 
and resource from drilling below 1100 meters elevation.

The June 2006 model showed modest increases in tonnage and contained metal over the October 
2004 model. (On the order of 18% increase in tonnes and 12% increase in metal.) The increase 
was due to the impact of new drilling intersecting additional areas of mineralization, extending 
previously intersected mineralization along strike and down dip, and, in certain cases, the 
intersection of higher grades on infill drilling of certain structures. The average grade of the 
resource at a cutoff generally decreased, due to the expansion of resource into areas of somewhat 
lower grade than the core of the deposit. A portion of the resource increase is also due to the 
extension of the model from 1,100 meters to 1,000 meters elevation. 
 
The April 2007 model shows modest increases in tonnage and contained metal over the June 
2006 model (on the order of 4.2% increase in tonnes and 5.3% increase in contained metal). The 
increases were due to the impact of new drilling intersecting additional areas of mineralization, 
extending previously intersected mineralization along strike and down dip. The average grade of 
the resource at cutoff slightly increased (around 1%). 
 
17.2 Sample Database 

No changes to the resource model have occurred since CAM's audit of the Resource in July 
2007.  CAM reported that the sample database for the resource estimation is maintained in 
industry-standard Gemcom software. Geologic information was hand-keyed from drill hole logs, 
while assay data are acquired and entered electronically. The database has been extensively 
reviewed, both by Minefinders personnel as well as by independent engineering firms, and has 
been uniformly considered appropriate for resource estimation. (PAH 2002, RPA 2004). Drill 
and underground data are used for estimation of block grades. Drill, underground, and surface 
data were all used to guide the geologic interpretation, and surface data were included for 
assigning resource classifications. 
 
The drill database used by CAM was comprised of 311 RC and 492 core holes. An additional 16 
RC holes and 13 core holes had been drilled and sampled, but results had not yet been received 
at the time of CAM's resource audit. Gustavson used the CAM audited model which did not 
include these new drill holes. 
 
17.3 Compositing 

No changes to the resource model have occurred since CAM's audit of the Resource in July 
2007.  CAM reported that drill data were composited in 2-meter intervals, starting from the 
collar of the drill hole. Composites composed entirely of void space (as in intersected mine 
workings or other underground openings) were not assigned grade. Underground data were not 
composited, as they were typically 2-meter sample lengths and the structure of the data file 
makes the information more representative without compositing.  
 
17.4 Capping of High Grades 

No changes to the resource model have occurred since CAM's audit of the Resource in July 
2007.  CAM reported that Minefinders capped gold composite grades at 30 grams per tonne (g/t) 
and silver composites to  1000 g/t prior to grade estimation. These capping grades are consistent 
with those in the previous 43-101 resource reports by PAH and RPA. For estimation of waste

blocks (rock codes 12, 20) proximal to the low grade zone, composites were capped at 3 g/t gold 
and 100 g/t silver to avoid extrapolation of high grade assays in those zones.  
 
17.5 Gold Equivalence 

Gold equivalent grade was used by Minefinders for solids modeling.  A 75 to 1 gold to silver 
value ratio was used by Minefinders for several generations of resource reports on the project, 
according to the following formula. 
 
AuEq = ($300/oz x 87.5% rec) / ($5.00/oz x 70% rec) 
 
17.6 Geostatistics 

Each of the independent engineering firms that has audited the Dolores resource estimate have 
evaluated the geostatistical characteristics of the deposit.  There are no new data that would 
materially effect conclusions from previous studies.  
 
17.7 Solids Model 

Two grade shells (envelopes) were used to control estimation of grade in the block model.  The 
low grade envelope was created at a cutoff of 0.2 g/t AuEq, and the high grade envelope at 1.0 
g/t AuEq with a minimum of width of 5 meters and 10 meters respectively.  Minefinders 
projected these zones a maximum of 100 meters though the classification of measured and 
indicated (also proven and probable) are restricted to 17.5 and 35 meters respectively.  The grade 
shells were interpreted on 25 meter sections and 10 meter plans. These envelopes were used to 
create solid models of the high grade and low grade mineralized shapes.  Minefinders coded the 
2 meter composites by the solids in which they resided (high grade/low grade), and used the 
composites within each shape to estimate the grade of the mineralization within that shape.  The 
grade of waste blocks was estimated from composites outside these solids. 
 
The following italicized paragraphs were taken from the CAM 2007 report and describe 
additional aspects of Minefinders' modeling procedure.  
 
Individual structures are considered to be continuous enough to model if they can be traced for three 
consecutive sections and three drillholes. If not, they are left as isolated intercepts. The interpretations 
are refined by comparison and iterative adjustment of both plan and section views. Grade envelopes are 
interpreted for high and low-grade zones as well as lower grade "holes" within the zones.  
 
Drillhole and channel composites are assigned integer codes according to whether they occur within the 
high grade zone, low grade zone, or outside the zones. High-grade zone composites (composites whose 
midpoint are within the high grade solids) are assigned a code of 1000, while low-grade zone composites 
are assigned 100. Composites outside the zones, but adjacent to them, are assigned waste codes (12 and 
20) All other composites were assigned as waste (code 10). 
 
Extruded solid models are used to assign rock codes to the block model. The codes are assigned in the 
following order: 
1. Rock code 20 (Proximal Waste) assigned to blocks within bounding solids. 
2. Rock code 100 assigned to blocks at least 50% within low-grade solids.

3. Rock code 1000 assigned to blocks at least 50% within high-grade solids. 
4. Blocks with at least 51% contained volume in a "hole" in the high-grade zones would be assigned 100 
(i.e. low-grade). (there are currently no 'high grade hole' solids in the solids model) 
5. Blocks with at least 51% in a "hole" in the low-grade were tagged as internal waste (12). 
This solids modeling approach has been reviewed by PAH (PAH 2002) and RPA (RPA 2004) and has 
been considered to be reasonable and appropriate. 
 
17.8 Block Model 

The Minefinders block model was constructed in Gemcom.  Minefinders transferred the 
Gemcom resource model to an ASCII file which was converted into a Datamine block model by 
Gustavson.  Gustavson verified that the model was the same as the model that CAM audited in 
July 2007 by comparing resources reported out of Datamine to that in the CAM resource audit. 
 
17.9 Grade Estimation Methodology 

From CAM (2007):  Block grades are estimated for gold and silver based on an Inverse Distance to the 
5th Power (ID5) interpolation of the anisotropically nearest composites. A minimum of 3 and a maximum 
of 12 composites are used to contribute data to the estimation of grade for a given block with a maximum 
of 2 composites per hole. The composites per hole limitation serves to reduce downhole averaging of data 
and requires the presence of 2 drillholes within the calculation ellipse for estimation of grade into a 
block. The ID5 estimation produces a block model with locally high variability of grade, consistent with 
the grade distribution found in the drilling. This estimation technique was found to be reasonable and 
consistent for this deposit by PAH (PAH 2002) and RPA (RPA 2004). 
 
17.10 Bulk Density 

From CAM (2007): Bulk density estimates for the blocks were based on approximately 250 tests 
conducted prior to 2003 on drill core using the water immersion method on paraffin-sealed core samples. 
The tests were primarily latite and andesite rock units, which comprise the principal hosts for the deposit. 
Average density for the latite is 2.52 t/m3 and for the andesite is 2.58 t/m3. The average abundance of the 
latite host in the deposit is estimated at 40% versus 60% for andesite. An average density of 2.55 t/m3 is 
assigned to all blocks based the relative proportion of host rock lithologies. CAM consider the method 
used to derive the bulk density, and the application of the density to tonnage estimation, to be reasonable 
and appropriate.  Gustavson concurs with CAM's conclusion on bulk density. 
 
17.11 Block Model Validation 

No changes have been made to the resource model since CAM's work.  CAM reported that the 
block model was carefully reviewed to be sure that block grade estimation is consistent with the 
local composite grades. The block model shows high local variability of grade, consistent with 
local variability of composite grades. A comparison of block grade distribution with composite 
grade distribution shows the block grade distribution to be somewhat more smooth than the 
composite grade distribution as predicted by the volume variance relationship. The block and 
composite grade distributions are unbiased.  Gustavson concurs with CAM's conclusions with 
respect to block model validation.

17.12 Mined Out Volumes 

RPA reported a total of 372,000 short tonnes of relatively high grade ore was mined from the 
underground workings at Dolores in the early part of the 20th century. The grade of this material 
is estimated to have been 9.8 g/t Au and 563 g/t Ag. Voids are commonly encountered in the 
drilling, and much of the mined volumes remain unsurveyed. It was RPA's opinion, the mined 
volume constitutes such a small tonnage relative to the overall resource as to be inconsequential 
to the estimate. What is more important, from an operational point of view, is to establish the 
locations of the voids so that they do not pose a safety hazard for personnel and equipment in the 
pit. Gustavson concurs with RPA's conclusion. 
 
17.13 Classification 

CAM states that the Dolores mineral resources were classified according to the definitions in the 
CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines, adopted by the 
CIM Council on November 14, 2004, as incorporated in National Instrument 43-101. Resource 
blocks are classed as Measured, Indicated, or Inferred, depending on the confidence level of the 
estimate. The criteria to classify the resources were established in accordance of industry practice 
by PAH (2002) and RPA 2004 in the course of auditing the resource estimates. 
 
CAM continued saying, the technique used for applying the classification was the anisotropic 
distance to the nearest composite. Anisotropic distances are proportional to the search ellipsoid 
and can vary depending on direction to the composite. In general, the distance criterion is 
approximately equal to the semi-major axis of the search ellipsoid used to capture the sample 
composites. For Dolores, blocks within approximately 17.5 meters of the nearest composite were 
assigned to the measured category. Indicated blocks are those between 17.5 and 35 meters from a 
composite, while Inferred blocks are between 35 and 90 meters from the nearest composite. 
Surface samples were included in the database for the purpose of distance tagging for 
classification. The surface samples were not used in the grade interpolation but were used for 
geological interpretation and, as such, contribute to the local confidence level of the estimate.  
 
17.14 Resource Estimate Review by CAM  

CAM reviewed the Resource estimation procedures used by Minefinders and believed that they 
conform to accepted engineering practice. However they said, "based on experience with 
deposits with similar ore geometry, CAM has found that interpreted ore shapes with just a few 
contained composites tend to have more variable reconciliation with actual mining than those 
shapes containing many composites. This is certainly to be expected statistically and CAM 
suggests that, if convenient, Minefinders assign a unique code to each interpreted shape to allow 
these higher risk volumes to be identified in the next Resource update."   
 
Minefinders' Mineral Resource estimates, as audited and publicly released on June 12, 2007, are 
shown in Tables 17-1 and 17-2.  The Mineral Resource is shown by AuEq cutoff Measured and

17.15 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

Minefinders tasked Gustavson to create a mineral reserve estimate from the CAM audited 
resource model.  This involved Gustavson re-blocking the CAM audited resource model.  
Minefinders' goal in modeling the Dolores project resource was to create a geologic model of the 
mineralization without regard to mining, and then to apply mining dilution by re-blocking. To 
achieve this, the Minefinders model utilized estimation of gold and silver grade from 2 meter 
down hole composites.  Minefinders created grade boundaries (shapes) around the composites at 
0.2g/t and 1.0g/t AuEq cutoffs.  Minefinders then estimated the grade of blocks using ID5 
approximating a nearest neighbor grade estimate within a geologically defined shape.    
 
17.15.1  Gustavson Associates Resource Audit 

Gustavson validated the Minefinders resource model and the reblocked reserve model by 
checking grade sensitivity of the resource estimate to different composite lengths and modeling 
methods.  Gustavson looked at composite lengths from 2 to 10 meters, and inverse distance to 
the third power grade interpolation(with 4 and 7 meter composites), excluding the low grade 
mineralization envelope (grade shell). 
 
The Minefinders resource model was created when metal prices were much lower.  Given the 
current high metal prices, the actual economic cutoff is below the low grade shape Minefinders 
used to define the lower grade mineralized volume.  Future resource estimates should investigate 
the impact of higher metal prices on the resource estimation procedure.  Gustavson recommends 
closely monitoring mine production and reconciling it to the block model, modifying the model 
as needed to match actual mining practice and production data. 
 
17.15.2 Impact of Composite Length. 

To investigate the impact of increasing composite lengths, Gustavson analyzed the behavior of 
composites at 2 meter, to 10  meter down hole intervals are presented in Table 17-4 at AuEq 
cutoffs from zero to 1.0 g/t .  Table 17-5 shows the same composite data Silver grades.

17.15.3 Reblocking for Reserves Estimation  

Gustavson used reblocking of the resource as a means to introduce dilution and more closely 
match current mining practice and equipment fleet size. Reblocking was accomplished using 
Datamine Studio 3 (version 3.0.1742.6) software by sub-blocking each resource model block 
into whole and half blocks vertically, and then adding together  the hole and half blocks 
vertically and 2 sets horizontally to generate a 6x10x7.5 meter XYZ block. Most block 
parameters are averaged during reblocking. The alteration code was re-assigned to the blocks 
based on its constituent parts.  Lithology was assigned by majority percentage.  
 
Gustavson investigated the amount of dilution that is added to the Minefinder geological 
resource model (3x10x5) to the reserve model (6x10x7.5). Reblocking the resource model 
reduced the average grade of mineralization above gold equivalent cutoffs as shown below.  
Gustavson reported the impact on proven and probable tonnes within the final pit design, rather 
than on the global resource.  Re-blocking resulted in a 5-13% reduction in the average grade 
above gold equivalent cutoffs.  These reblocked grades are used in the minable reserve tables 
shown in Table 17-6 and in all planning and scheduling.

17.15.4 ID 3 estimate with 7.0 meter composites 

To validate whether or not re-blocking alone sufficiently diluted the resource, Gustavson used 
alternative estimation methods to model minable grade.   
 
Minefinders, at Gustavson's direction, re-estimated the Dolores resource using inverse distance 
to the third power, using the 4.0 meter and 7.0 meter down hole composites, excluding the low 
grade mineralized envelope.  A comparison of the ID3 estimate to the CAM audited resource (re-
blocked to 6 x 10 x7.5) is shown below at cutoffs ranging from 0.1 g/t to 5.0 g/t gold equivalent.  
At Gustavson's instruction, Minefinders reported the reserves within the final pit design for each 
of the different estimation methods.  Results are shown in Table 17-7.

There is reasonably good correlation between each of the estimates above.  Gustavson 
recommends continuing to monitor mine dilution and a reconciliation of the actual production 
with the resource and reserve models. 
 
17.15.5  Pit Optimization, Pit Design and Economic Parameters 

The Dolores mineral reserve estimate was created and modeled using Datamine's version 4.0 
(release 1740.7) NPV Scheduler.  The reblocked resource model was used for the optimization 
analysis using the Datamine economic pit optimizer.   Gustavson ran the model utilizing 
incremental profit factors from 1% to 100% (full value) of the calculated block value.  This 
creates incrementally larger pit shells to the ultimate pit at the given metal price.  Each 
incrementally larger economic pit shell has the associated ore and waste tonnage, and metal

content that can be used to evaluate relative economic value and risk of producing material out of 
that shell.   The criteria shown in Table 17-8 were used for the pit design.

17.15.6 Pit Shells vs Ultimate Pit 

The Datamine pit limit optimizer generates incrementally larger pit from 1% to 100% (full value) 
of the block, creating successively larger shells of decreasing marginal value to the final (least 
incremental value) economic pit limit.  Gustavson evaluated the Dolores reserve sensitivity to 
gold price, operating cost, and pit slope, and then chose what we believe to be the most robust 
pit, that minimizes risk associated with mining ore that does not add substantial economic value.  
Pit 38 occurs right after the last steep rise in NPV (seen in Figure 17-1), and this point of 
maximum incremental value was selected for design.

Pit 38 mined 94 million tonnes of ore with contained gold of 2,357,000 oz, contained silver of 
123,858,000 oz, and 286 million tonnes of waste.  The ultimate pit at $600 gold and $10 silver 
contained 114 million tonnes of ore(21% increase), 437 million tonnes of waste(53% increase), 
and 2,856,000 oz Gold(21% increase) and 139,106,000 oz Silver(12% increase).  Life of mine 
profit (NPV at 0%) increased from $935m to $1,004m, for an increase of $68m (7% increase). 
 
Overall, the incremental change going from pit shell 38 to the ultimate pit would require mining 
45% more rock, processing 21% more rock, to increase the life of mine profit by 7%.  Pit shell 
38 was selected as the basis for final design.  Given the physical topographic constraints on the 
project, and increased risk associated with mining more rock, Gustavson believes the design is 
prudent. 
 
17.15.7 Design of Ultimate Pit with Haul Roads 

Gustavson used the pit 38 shell as a basis for final pit design with haul roads. Haul roads were 
normally designed with a 10% grade and 26 meter width.  6.4 meter wide catch benches were 
designed every other bench (every 15m) with a 67degree inter-bench face angle.  Gustavson's 
goal was to keep the pit wall as close to pit shell 38 and to mine as much of the ore contained in 
that shell as practical.   In doing the design, Gustavson used the ultimate pit limit and the 
ultimate pit limit at 47 degree pit slope as a guide of where additional layback might be 
acceptable when width was needed to accommodate the haul road.  Gustavson worked to 
minimize haul road distances and haul road induced pit layback.  Currently there is one pit exit at 
1450 meter elevation in the north east portion of pit.  Prior to 2016 ore and waste can be 
delivered to the plant or waste dumps via several pit exit points.   After 2016 ore and waste must 
be delivered to their respective destination by a common haul road. 
 
Further optimization and design will be required if run-of-mine dump leaching is determined to 
be a viable for low grade material. 
 
17.15.8 Dolores Project Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves 

The minable reserve for the Dolores project uses an economic cutoff using the economic 
parameters presented in Table 17-8.  The Dolores deposit has been well defined by drilling, 
proven ore makes up 57 percent of the Dolores Mineral Reserve, with 43 percent probable ore.  
The Dolores Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve is presented in Table 17-9.

17.15.9 Production Phases 

The production schedule for the life of the project was created using NPV Scheduler.  Optimized 
extraction sequences were created and used as a basis for design of each mining phase.  The first 
year of production (phase 1) used Minefinders current mine plan with minor modifications (the 
lowest bench mined in phase 1 is 1470, the eastern high wall is taken to final above 1600). This 
is in the northern most portion of pit. The second phase is in the location of the town of Dolores 
and is mined to 1500.  The third phase mines material between phase 1 and phase 2.  Phase 4 is a 
high wall push back to the west and takes the pit to final design in the northern portion of the pit 
to bench 1370.  Phase 4 is the last of the relatively low stripping ratio phases.  Phase 5 takes the 
pit to final above 1405 bench.  The final phase takes the pit to its ultimate depth and its lowest 
bench 1170.  The annual production schedule and more balanced stripping ratio is achieved by 
mining the upper benches of phases 4 and 5 earlier in the project life.  Table 17-10 shows the 
Mineral Reserve by Phase.

17.15.10 Dump Location and Capacity 

The steep terrain of Dolores project creates challenges in waste dump design and haul distances.   
There are five main waste dump areas, the North Dump, the West Dump, the South West Dump, 
the South Dump and an in-pit dump that becomes useable near the end of phase 6.  An additional 
area to the north west of the diversion dam/lake is available with a slightly longer up hill haulage 
route.  The pit design would require modification if one were to utilize this site beyond 2015. 
 
North Dump has a capacity of 187 M tonnes to 1610 elevation, a second lift to 1700 elevation 
can add 64 M tonnes.  Currently only phase 1 waste rock (26 M tonnes) is delivered to the North 
dump as there is an additional 1100 meter at +10% haulage required to use this dump after phase 
1. 
 
The Western dump has a capacity of 20 M tonnes to an elevation of 1700.  Phase 2 waste rock 
(18 M tonnes) is delivered to the Western Dump. 
 
The SW dump has a capacity of 77 M tonnes to an elevation of 1750.  Waste Rock from phase 3, 
and phase 4 and 5 above benches 1650 totaling (36 M tonnes) are delivered to the South West 
Dump.   
 
South Dump as designed to 1550 elevation has a capacity of 330 M tonnes.  Most of the waste 
rock (288 M tonnes) generated by the project is delivered to the South Dump.   
 
Approximately 11 M tonnes of waste from phase 6 can be disposed of in an in-pit dump in the 
north end of the pit. 
 
Each of the dump locations relative to the final pit limit is shown in Figure17-1 below.

17.15.11 Productivity Calculation 

Rather than balance stripping ratio over the project life, Gustavson balanced truck hours based 
on changing productivity by phase and bench required to deliver rock to their respective dumps 
or primary crusher.  Travel speeds were from the Caterpillar Performance Handbook, a 5 minute 
spot, load, and dump time, 95% availability, 50 minute hours, and 20 hour days were used.

17.15.13 Impact of High Metal Prices on Operations  

Current metal prices ($980 Au / $20 Ag at the time of writing) reduce the cutoff grade to 0.15-
0.21g/t AuEq depending on alteration type.  Reducing the cutoff would lower the overall grade, 
and with fixed capacity of the crushing plant, extend the mine life, but also reduce the annual 
gold and silver production.  To continue to mine at a higher cutoff 0.30 g/t AuEq is in effect high 
grading the project, and about 60 million tonnes (235k oz Au, 1.52m oz Ag â€“ to a 0.15 AuEq 
cutoff) of marginally profitable rock will be put into a waste dump.   
 
Gustavson recommends investigating the optimal cutoff grade to achieve the best project value.  
This might involve dump leaching run-of-mine low grade ores, or stockpiling low grade rock for 
potential future processing.  
 
Dilution induced by blast heave, mine equipment size, mining practice, and mine face advance 
direction should be monitored closely.  Gustavson recommends using geo-statistical methods of 
mine production planning and grade control.

17.15.14 Comparison of Current Production to Block Model 

There is currently insufficient data to make a meaningful comparison.  A small quantity of ore 
grade material had been mined and stockpiled through February.  Minefinders is primarily pre-
stripping waste to avoid potential stockpile issues and re-handle costs. 
 
18. OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

Gustavson is not aware of other relevant information which would change the conclusions of this 
report. 
 
19. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

No changes to the Minefinders resource model have occurred since CAM's NI 43-101 compliant 
audit of the Dolores Resource in July 2007.  Based on our review, Gustavson considers that the 
calculated resources are adequate to be used in the estimation of minable reserves and production 
scheduling.  Gustavson has created a NI 43-101 compliant mineral reserve estimate, and 
production schedule based on the CAM audited Resource estimate. 
 
Gustavson used updated cost data and a gold price of $600/oz and a silver price of $10/oz for the 
mine design portions of its evaluation, and $675/oz gold, and $13/oz silver for the economic 
portions of this report. 
 
Gustavson applied reblocking to create blocks 6x10x7.5 meters that represent selective minable 
units approximating current mine practice and the mine equipment fleet. 
 
The proven and probable mineral reserve now contains 99.3 M tonnes at .77 g/t Au and 40 g/t Ag 
at a stripping ratio of 3.7:1. 
 
Gustavson and Minefinders have updated the operating and capital costs for the project.  Main 
changes to the operating costs are labor rates, fuel price, reagent costs, and explosives costs.  
 
Gustavson has reviewed Minefinders Capital Costs and cash flow projections and has prepared a 
sensitivity analysis.   
 
20. RECOMMENDATIONS 

1. Gustavson recommends closely monitoring mine production and reconciling it to the block 
model, modifying the model if needed, using alternative composite lengths and interpolation 
methodologies to match actual mining practice and production data.  
 
2.  Gustavson recommends using geo-statistical methods of mine production planning and grade 
control.  
 
3. The current high metal price ($980Au/$20Ag at the time of writing), and the projected costs 
included in this report, yield economic cutoff grades in the range of 0.15 â€“ 0.21 g/t AuEq.  Using 
a lower cutoff grade (as indicated by current economics) would result in more tonnes of ore 



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 49 Gustavson Associates 

being available at lower grades.  With fixed throughput in the crushing plant, this lower grade 
would result in lower annual metal production, but longer production life. 
 
Gustavson, recommends investigating the viability of leaching run of mine low grade rock by 
constructing a small (5,000 â€“ 20,000 tonne) test heap on site, to determine leach characteristics 
and potential economics.  A run of mine leach option should be considered in the upcoming 
underground mining / conventional milling study. 
 
4. Investigate the viability of milling higher grade ore.  Milling will result in increased recovery 
and better assurance of getting the designed recovery. This will reduce risk (from coarse gold, 
sulfide, or other metallurgical issues) associated with putting high grade ore on the leach pad and 
not achieving planned leach recovery. 
 
5. The potential for underground mining deep ore should be investigated.  This work should 
consider trade offs between open pit and underground mining and consider the impact 
underground mining might have on open pit operations.  Underground mining may provide 
benefits to the open pit operation, including dewatering the pit, potentially bypassing open pit 
diversion water through an underground adit.  
 
6. Gustavson's equipment productivity calculations and truck cycle times may be conservative.  
Prior to expansion of the truck fleet in 2010, the actual performance of the mining fleet should be 
analyzed.  There is potential that some of the additional mine haul trucks included in this study 
may not be required for the planned mine production.

22. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TECHNICAL REPORTS ON 

DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES 

The Dolores Mine Operation is under construction and nearing production.  All necessary mine 
equipment is now on site, pre-production mining commenced during the fall of 2007.  All project 
facilities including; power generation, crusher, conveyer, and stacking, heap leach, Merryl 
Crowe precipitation, and refining systems will be competed in the next few months.  The camp is 
complete and several people have moved into the new village. 
  
22.1 Mining Operations  

The Dolores mine plan provides ore to a crushing plant at the rate of 6.48 million tonnes per 
year. The ore will be crushed and conveyed to the leach pad at a rate of 18,000 tpd.  Table 22-1 
shows the mine production schedule. The mine plan has approximately 15 years of commercial 
production after the preproduction period.  The peak total material movement is 42 million 
tonnes per year or about 115,000 tpd (assuming 365 operating days per year).  The operation is 
running a 2, 12 hour shifts per day.  The mine labor force works a cycle of 14 days on 7 days off, 
which is typical for similar operations in the area.

22.1.1 Pioneering â€“ Initial Production. 

At this time pioneering of roads for Phase I development is complete,  initial bench access has 
been developed as well as the start of the North Waste Dump.  The road for ore transport to the 
primary crusher is passable, and will be widened and straightened to improve productivity and 
safety by filling with mine waste as time and material allow. 
 
Production rhythms have approached and now surpassed the predicted ore (stockpile) and waste 
production.  As the hydraulic shovels come on line, and the benches open up both ore and waste 
capacity should reach project goals. 
  
22.1.2 Mine Equipment Fleet 

The mining equipment is sized to offer efficiently mine ore and waste from 7.5 meter bench 
height, (which is an increase from 5 m in the feasibility study).  The current fleet is sufficient for 
production through year 2009 after which 5 additional trucks are projected to be necessary to 
meet waste haulage requirements.  The mine auxiliary equipment will be responsible for 
maintaining the main haulage and access road on the property, contract maintenance of the 90 
km main access road is planned. 
 
Support equipment includes track dozers, rubber tire dozers, excavator and graders along with 
smaller equipment for maintenance and other support activities.   
 
All equipment maintenance for the first five years is provided through a maintenance and repair 
contract (MARC).  The contractor will supply needed mechanics and repair parts (Fuel, lube and 
filters are not included), up to 80 mechanics, and maintenance supervision.  The contract 
provides guaranteed equipment availabilities each year of the contract, and parts costs per 
equipment hour each year. Mining costs the first and second year are lower than average because 
equipment maintenance costs are lower.  Equipment is rebuilt the third year, increasing cost 
substantially.  Equipment repair costs after year 5 are the average hourly cost of years 2-5, with a 
maintenance crew of 102 men.  
 
The current mining equipment fleet is shown below.

22.3 Recoverability 

No new data on recoverability since the KCA 2006 feasibility is available.  Gustavson has 
reviewed test work and reports completed.  Test work has shown gold and silver mineralization 
in Dolores to be amenable to conventional cyanide heap leaching technology.  Much of the test 
work was done at McClelland Laboratories, Inc., (MLI) and Colorado Minerals Research 
Institute (CMRI). A total of 32 column leach tests exist for Dolores; 22 different composites 
have been tested in three different metallurgical campaigns.  Analysis of the column and bottle 
roll data by M3 and KCA predict the heap leach recoveries for Dolores ore crushed 80 percent 
minus 6.3mm as shown in Table 22-4.   
 

Table 22-4  Gold and Silver Recovery 
 

 Gold Recovery% Silver Recovery,% 
Oxide All 79% 46.0% 
Mixed All  79%  52% 
Sulfide, High grade 65%  71.0% 
Sulfide, Low grade 56%  55.0% 
Manganese Latite 79%  21.0% 

 
 
The pH will be controlled with lime, and an average of 1.7 kg/tonne of ore has been used.  
Cyanide consumption is estimated at 0.4 kg per tonne of ore stacked.  Permeability testing on 
metallurgical column tests indicated the heaps will have excellent permeability. M3 and KCA 
reported that at a 100 meter stack height, permeability values of 1.4 x 10-1 cm/sec to 9.6 x 10-2 
cm/sec could be achieved.    



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 57 Gustavson Associates 

Should practice prove different than column tests predict, drum or belt agglomeration could be 
added without too much modification or cost increase.   
 
Abrasion indices are reported by M3 and KCA to be "Acceptable" according to Metso estimates.  
The indices ranged from a low of 0.029 to a high of 0.248 with an average of 0.116 
 
M3 and KCA each independently estimated and reported that Metso also provided estimates of 
liner consumption using their in-house data base. They report crushing work indices are 
favorable at 5.4 kWh/tonne for andesite and 7.6 kWh/tonne for latite. The ore body average work 
index is approximately 6.3 kWh/tonne.  An average cost of $0.112 / tonne of ore crushed has 
been used for liners, screen decks and parts in this report. 
 
Power will be generated on site from six 1,800 kw diesel powered generators.  An average load 
factor of 70% was used in this report, which equates to an average load of 7,560 kw.   A fuel 
consumption rate of 200 grams fuel per KWH of power was used.   
 
22.4 Markets  

Gold and silver are both precious metals which will be sold at international market prices.  
Precious metals markets are elastic and are expected to absorb this production easily. 
 
The Dolores mine and processing facilities are expected to produce a high grade silver-gold dorÃ© 
in bars assaying approximately 97.5% silver and 2% gold which is readily marketable. Firm 
quotations are expected from several refiners in coming months. The basic terms used in this 
study are summarized below:  
 
Quantity Average of 4.13 million troy ounces of dorÃ© annually  
Delivery Transportation and refining cost to Salt Lake City is $0.74/oz Gold and $0.24/oz Silver. 
Gold Return 99.70% of assayed contents 
Silver Return 99.70% of assayed contents 
 
Contracts â€“  
Mining and processing of the ore will be directly performed by CMD.  Supplies of fuel, cyanide, 
lime and other key consumables are in place, and have all undergone an open bidding process.  A 
maintenance and repair MARC contract is in place with Road Machinery, Inc. a qualified 
Komatsu representative.  A down the hole, explosives service provider has been selected and 
final negotiations are in progress. 
 
Discussions are in progress with two refiners for dorÃ© refining and metal sales.    
 
22.5 Environmental Considerations  

 
Minefinders has a Draft Environmental Management Plan prepared with the assistance of James 
Beck.  That plan is currently being finalized including all changes in the mine plan and facilities 
as built. 



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 58 Gustavson Associates 

An estimate of reclamation costs is prepared on a quarterly basis.  Minefinders is using an 
accretion of assets in the cash flow model to account for the cost of the eventual remediation.   
 
Minefinders has submitted operating plans for and obtained permits to conduct all aspects of 
Dolores operations.   
 
Minefinders plan to perform concurrent reclamation of the mine waste dumps by re-contouring 
the waste dump slopes to a 2.5:1 slope during normal operations. The cost for the mine dump 
reclamation is included in the mine operating costs.  Dozers will perform the bulk of the work.  
When the last leach period is completed, the ore heap will be allowed to drain down and solution 
quality will be monitored for compliance. Appropriate environmental action will be taken as 
solution quality during drain down is obtained. This could include rinsing, cyanide destruction, 
or microbial treatment to bring solutions into compliance. The pad will be "armored" with 0.5 
meters of run of mine waste. Re-vegetation of the waste dumps and leach pad will be by 
applying seed bed preparation, seed, and fertilizer.  $30,000 per month ($360k annually) has 
been included over the life of the mine for the revegetation. Other provisions for closure include 
pit area fencing, building and foundation demolition, an evapotranspiration cell (ET Cell), and 
ongoing monitoring. The pit will be allowed to flood.  There does not appear to be an acid rock 
drainage (ARD) issue with respect to waste rock disposal. The material was tested according to 
accepted industry practice and Mexican NOMs. Acid Base Accounting (ABA) showed that about 
28% of the waste rock has a potential to generate acid with an ABA ratio of <1.2. A 20-week 
duration dynamic (humidity cell) test showed that only one of four composites made from ABA 
ratio <1.2 material generated a mildly acidic (pH = 5.8 leachate. That single composite 
represents only about 5.2 percent of waste material. The other three components made from 
ABA ratio <1.2 generated neutral or near neutral leachate. 
 
Minefinders estimates the cost of reclamation to be $9.5 million and these costs are nearly offset 
by the estimated $7.5 m salvage value of plant equipment at the end of the mine life.   
 
22.6 Taxes and Royalties 

 
22.6.1 Royalties 

A royalty originally negotiated with the owner of the mining concessions that have since been 
amalgamated into the Unification Real Cananea concession has been purchased by Royal Gold.  
It is based on a net smelter return (NSR) of 2.00% of gold and 3.25% of silver.  Mexico does not 
charge royalties on precious metals production. 
 
22.6.2 Corporate Tax 

CMD will be subject to the normal Mexican Corporate Tax rate of 28%.  There is also an 
alternative minimum tax regimen called IETU (Impuesto Especial de Tasa Unica). This new 
minimum tax of 16.5% is applied to income calculated by deducting certain cash costs from total 
cash revenues.  Analysis indicates that at current gold prices CMD will not be subject to IETU, 
and the 28% Mexican corporate tax rate will apply. 



Minefinders Corporation, Ltd.   
Dolores Gold-Silver Project, Mexico  Technical Report 
 
 

3/25/08 59 Gustavson Associates 

Revenue derived by from the project by Minefinders Corporation Ltd through dividends are 
exempt from income tax according to Canadian tax law.  Tax calculations are outside the scope 
of this report and have not been included in the cash flow calculations. 
 
Importation Taxes (NAFTA) 
In Mexico, importation tax rates are dependent on both the country of origin and on the technical 
specification of the goods. In general, goods imported for industrial purposes are subject to more 
favorable rates and, as a result of membership in NAFTA, goods manufactured in the United 
States and Canada are not subject to importation taxes.  
 
Substantially all the capital equipment identified for the project is supplied from the United 
States or Mexico, with the exception of the hydraulic shovels. These are subject to importation 
duties under the IMMEX program described below. 
 
Value Added Taxes (IVA) 
The value added tax rate (IVA) in Mexico is 15% on all purchases of goods and services 
originating in country and possibly internationally. The IVA payments accumulate to a tax credit 
account and are reimbursed periodically to the Company. Reimbursements of IVA are processed 
by the Secretaria de Hacienda and typically take about 45 days. The Dolores project has 
excluded the IVA tax in the capital cost and financial analysis. 
 
Importation Duty - IMMEX (previously PITEX) 
IMMEX is a conditional Federal program that allows the beneficiary to import items into Mexico 
without paying import duty or IVA. In order to qualify for the program, all equipment subject to 
import duty must be imported on a temporary basis and exported at the end of the project life. 
Consumable items can also qualify for the program if the finished product from the facility is 
manufactured for export. The cost associated with administering the IMMEX program through 
brokers, including incidental fees, can range from 2% to 3% of the equipment cost. Imported 
equipment and consumables for the Dolores Mine are considered exempt of import duties under 
the IMMEX program. Accordingly, the capital cost estimate includes a 2% administration fee for 
equipment and consumables purchased under the IMMEX program. 
 
22.7 Capital and Operating Cost Estimates 

22.7.1 Operating Costs 

Operating costs have been estimated for the life of mine by Gustavson with Minefinders 
assistance, data, and project experience input.   The life of mine annual costs are shown in Figure 
22-5.  The bulk of these cost were developed from actual cost and contractual materials 
agreements. 
 
Gustavson has reformatted that data to more closely coincide with the feasibility study done by 
KCA in 2006.  The life of mine summary comparison of operating cost is shown in Table 22-5.  
The operating cost reported here includes start-up costs.

22.8 Economic Analysis 

The Dolores project was analyzed using a discounted cash flow approach based on 100 percent 
equity financing and costs in constant second quarter 2008 U.S. Dollars.  No provisions were 
made to include price escalation.  The financial indicators examined for the project included the 
Net Present Value (NPV), payback period (time in years to recapture the initial capital 
investment), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR). 
 
Annual cash flow projections were estimated over the life of the mine based on capital 
expenditures, production costs, and sales revenue.  The life of mine is 16 years with some 
residual silver and gold production occurring in year 17. The full reclamation period extends into 
year 17. 
 
Total life of mine capital expenditures are $242 million which includes initial capital, sustaining 
capital and initial working capital.  Total cash costs over the life of mine are $907 million and 
include operating costs, treatment charges, royalty costs, concession payments and property 
taxes. 
 
Total revenues from the sale of gold and silver over the life of mine are $2,023,918,000 based on 
$675 per troy ounce for gold and $13 per troy ounce for silver.  Metal prices were calculated by 
Minefinders based on a weighted average of 60% historical data and 40% future projections in 
accordance with common practice. 
 
The financial analysis was prepared on a pre-tax basis with sensitivities evaluated for the metal 
prices, capital cost, operating cost and metal production. A detailed after tax inclusive financial 
analysis was outside the Gustavson scope.

On a pre-tax basis, the project will generate an NPV (at 3% percent discount rate) of $563 
million with an IRR of 26% and a payback of 2 years.  The project is most sensitive to changes 
in metal prices followed by metal production, operating costs, and initial capital costs.  The life 
of mine pre-tax cash flow is shown in Table 22-8. 
 
22.9 Payback 

Based on the cash flow projections for the life of mine, the payback of the initial capital 
investment can be realized in 2 years following start of production. 
 
22.10 Mine Life 

Mining will occur for a period of 16 years excluding the pre-production period, based on the 
proven and probable reserved identified at present and the selected production rate.  
 
22.11 Sensitivity Analysis 

Gustavson ran cash flow sensitivities (at plus and minus five and ten percent) to changes in 
operating and capital costs, metal price, and recovered metal.  The project is most sensitive to 
metal price changes, followed by variations in recovered metal, and then operating cost.  A large 
percentage of the capital cost has already been spent, so there is much less uncertainty regarding 
capital.  Figure 22-1 shows the project cash cost sensitivity, Figure 22-2 shows the Total Cost 
Sensitivity, and Figure 22-3 shows the NPV Sensitivity.
