Summary  
 
Harmony Gold Corp. has entered into an option agreement with ECI Exploration and Mining 
Inc. (ECI) and wholly owned subsidiary Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. (formally known as 
Electrum Capital Inc.) on the Purisima gold and silver project in the state of Nayarit, Mexico. 
The Purisima project is located in west-central Mexico, 40 kilometers on paved road from the 
city of Tepic, the capital of Nayarit state with approximately 400,000 inhabitants 196 
kilometers northwest of the city and international airport of Guadalajara, Mexico, population 
approximately 6,000,000.   
 
The agreement covers a project comprising 13 concessions totaling 19563.48 hectares in 
good standing and duly registered with The Mine Agency of the Ministry of the Economy. 
Electrum Capital Inc. has an option agreement with ECI, registered with the Mexican Mining 
Authorities, to earn a 100% interest in all properties that comprise this project and properties 
leased by ECI. 
 
The 13 concessions leased by ECI which comprise the Purisima project are shown in Table 2, 
Section 3. Eleven of the concessions consist of historic claims covering areas of known 
mineralization and the projected extensions of that mineralization. Two larger claims 
"blanket" the historic claims, both protecting the areas of known mineralization and covering 
adjacent exploration targets.  
 
In all respects the project is well-situated with respect to the infrastructure needs of a modern 
mining operation. In addition to being accessible by modern paved highway from both Tepic 
and Guadalajara, power, water, transportation and labor are all present on site. 
 
Mineralization at the Purisima Project consists of low sulfidation epithermal veins in Tertiary 
volcanics of the Sierra Madre Occidental.  Low sulfidation epithermal veins are associated 
with volcanic related hydrothermal and geothermal systems and typically are formed at 
shallow depths.  Mineralization is characterized by quartz veins, stockworks and breccias 
carrying gold, silver, electrum, argentinite and pyrite with lesser and variable amounts of base 
metal sulphides and sulphosalts.  Veins in these systems can extend for significant distances 
along strike and down dip.  Diamond core drilling and historical mining on the Purisima vein 
has demonstrated variable width of the vein from 1.2 to 14.5 meters in true thickness.  
Mineralization was historically mined to a depth of approximately 75 meters below surface.   
 
In 2007 Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. acquired the property and conducted reconnaissance 
mapping and sampling, Aster imagery clay mapping, core drilling in 2008 and interpretation 
in 2009.  Minera Electrum's 2008 drilling shows that mineralization extends significantly 
beyond the extent of historic mining.    
 
Cardo Consultants S.A.C and Yukuskokon Professional Services, LLC. carried out this 
project evaluation at the request of Harmony Gold Corp. for the purpose of the preparation of 
a Technical Report in compliance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101. This evaluation 
is based on an examination of reports from previous activities, current work being undertaken 
on the project and a site visits on the 13th of May, 2008 (Owen Miller) and on the 9th of May, 
2011 (William Burnett). The evaluation focused on:  
 

• the current physical and legal status of the concessions  



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  2 
June 29, 2011 
 

• the exploration/development potential of the leases  

• the results of current and historic exploration, development and production programs 
 
The authors Owen Miller and William Burnett (Qualified Persons for this report) conclude 
that the exploration conducted by ECI was sound, and additional exploration and drill testing 
is warranted on this project.  This report recommends the following work program: 
 

- Phase 1: Further mapping and sampling of the concessions to follow up on the 
strike extents of the veins, baseline environmental study, preparation of drill 
roads and platforms and a core drilling program of 3000m designed to test the 
continuity of mineralization down dip and along strike of known 
mineralization. Estimated cost: US$750,000 

 
- Phase 2: Depending on results of the Phase 1 exploration, a third drill program 

of 5000m would be undertaken for infill drilling and collection of material for 
metallurgical testing.  Estimated Cost: US$1,100,000. 

 
The total cost of the proposed is estimated at US$1,850,000.

3. Accessibility, Climate, Infrastructure and Physiography  
 
3.1 Accessibility  
 
The property is located in the state of Nayarit and is accessible by taking the highway from 
Guadalajara City to Tepic for 196 kilometers. From Tepic, the property is reached by taking 
the paved road to the Aguamilpa Reservoir for a distance of approximately 40 kilometers.  
The approximate centre of the Purisima claims lies 3 kilometers east of the town of Las 
Blancas. 
 
3.2 Climate and Vegetation 
 
The climate is warm and sub-humid with a well defined rainy season between June and 
September, extending into October. Average rainfall is 1300mm per annum with 90% of this 
falling between July and September.  Temperatures range from 18o up to 40oC with a mean 
annual average temperature of 27 oC.  Prevailing wind direction is south-east to north-west.  
Operating and exploration season in this region is year around. 
 
Farming is well developed in the area around Tepic, although the project area is not densely 
populated. The land use is mainly cattle and small scale cultivation of market crops. These 
include corn, beans, nuts, sorghum, citrus fruit, mangoes and avocados. Agricultural land use 
tends to be confined to the flatter lying land along the river valleys. 
 
Hills and upland areas, particularly those underlain by basalt flows are covered in sparse to 
moderate oak woodland, low bushes and grass. Valley floors and creek bottoms can be very 
densely vegetated, especially in the rainy season when jungle like growth requires clearing by 
machetes for access. 
 
3.3 Physiography  
 
The project is located on the Western Flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental. 
 
Topography varies from moderate to locally abrupt in the area of property with elevations 
ranging from 50m beside the Rio Grande de Santiago up to around 1000m above mean sea 
level in the area around Cerro Negro. 
 
The main physical feature in the area are the dam and hydroelectric scheme at Aguamilpa 3 
kilometers east of the eastern edge of the Purisima claims and the Rio Grande de Santiago 
with runs north-east to south-west through the south eastern part of the project. 
 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  10 
June 29, 2011 
 

The topography in the area is shown in Figure 3 and the photo on the Title Page indicates the 
degree of relief and the type of vegetation encountered.   
 
3.4. Infrastructure and Local Resources 
 
The project is very well situated with regard to the possible infrastructure requirements of a 
modern mining operation. 
 
The paved two lane highway from Tepic to Aguamilpa runs through the south-eastern corner 
of the project area as does the Rio Grande de Santiago. The main highway (Highway 15) 
from Guadalajara to Mazatlan runs 20 kilometers to the west of the project and, via the 
international airports in both cities, easy access is available from any part of the world. 
 
The 960 Megawatt Aguamilpa Hydroelectric scheme is located 3 kilometers east of the 
project so electrical power will present no problems. 
 
In Tepic, the state capital of Nayarit, with a population of some 300,000, rental vehicles, 
heavy machinery and the personnel to operate them are readily available.  
 
3.5 Surface Rights  
 
The national cadastral system for agricultural land ownership is accurate.  Mexican law does 
not vest surface rights with mineral rights and any proposed development requires the 
developer to:  
 

- purchase the surface rights or 
- make an appropriate agreement with the surface rights owners to have access to the 

property.

The authors observe that ECI's relations with local the local communities are good and that 
there will be no problems obtaining agreements as work advances on the project. 
 
4. History  
 
The exact date mineral exploration and mining activities commenced in the area is unknown. 
However a history of exploration and development is documented in the various available 
reports and in local verbal accounts. Historical records are a combination of historical 
archives, local oral history, and correlation of facts from various other sources.  No accurate 
production records from the project are available. 
 
It seems likely that the property was worked by the Spanish, as old workings were seen by an 
American engineer, Mr A. F. Flynt, M.E., in 1905. He acquired the property, conducted 
development work and erected a small mill but was forced to abandon the property during the 
Mexican Revolution. Mr Flynt wrote a detailed report on the property in 1912 and extracts of 
this report are available and cited in more recent documents (see Section 5.3 and Section 17. 
References).  This report is historical in nature, is not 43-101 compliant, and the authors 
make no claims about the accuracy or reliability of this data.   
 
The mine was partially dewatered for examination and sampling in the 1920´s and was not 
opened again until the late 1950's. 
 
A local Tepic company, Minas de Nayarit S.A. optioned the property, did considerable 
development work which confirmed the earlier Flynt report, extended the orebody and 
shipped several carloads of crude ore and some concentrates. 
 
A 1971 report mentions diamond drilling on the property carried out by a geologist by the 
name of Ordoñez although results or even location for these whole are unknown. 
 
Several other reports were compiled on the property in the early 1960's and again in the early 
1970's but there seems to have been no actual exploration work carried out on the property 
and certainly no further exploitation. 
 
Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. acquired the property in March, 2007 and conducted 
reconnaissance mapping and sampling, Aster imagery clay mapping, core drilling and 
interpretation.. 
 
 
5. Geology  
 
5.1 Geological Setting  
 
5.1.1 Regional Geology 
 
The Purisima project is located on the western flank of the Sierra Madre Occidental (SMO) 
on its boundary with the Coastal Pacific Lowlands and on the northern edge of the Trans-
Mexican Volcanic Belt. 
 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  12 
June 29, 2011 

The SMO is a large geologic terrain that runs some 1500 kilometers north-west to south-east 
along the western highlands of Mexico and averages 250 kilometers wide. 
 
Geologically the SMO consists of Tertiary volcanics that can be divided into Upper and 
Lower Volcanic Groups. 
 

- The Lower Volcanic Group (LVG) consists of mainly calc-alkaline andesitic 
tuffs, flows and breccias. These range in age from Eocene to Oligocene and 
attain a thickness of 1000m in north-western Durango. 
 
Intrusive activity began in the early Tertiary and extends through to the mid to 
late Miocene and consists of dykes, stocks and sills of intermediate to felsic 
composition. 
 

- The Upper Volcanic Group (UVG) is of Oligocene to Middle Miocene age 
and unconformably overlies the Lower Volcanic Group. Lithologically the 
UVG is made up of ash-flow tuffs, ignimbrites and air-fall tuffs and flows of 
rhyolitic to dacitic composition. The UVG constitutes the cap rock in the 
Sierra Madre volcanic pile and can attain thicknesses in excess of 1000m 
along the axis of the Sierra. 

 
The Upper and Lower Volcanic Groups in the Nayarit area have total thicknesses in the order 
of a few hundred meters. 
 
The SMO, and the Lower Volcanic Group in particular, represent one of the largest precious 
metal provinces in the world. Well known mining districts in the SMO include San-Dimas-
Tayoltita, Bacis, Topia, Ocampo, Batopilas, Guadalupe and Calvo.  Epithermal precious 
metal systems hosted by Miocene volcanics of the SMO include El Sauzal, Dolores, Mina 
Real/Santa Fe, La Cienaga and Nuevo Milenio. 
 
5.1.2 Local Geology 
 
The Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. Purisima claims are covered by the Cartas Geologica-
Minera F13-C19 "Santiago Ixcuintla" and F13-D11 "El Venado" although the main area of 
interest to date (and the area visited by the authors) is located in the southern central section 
of the "El Venado" mapsheet around the village of Las Blancas. The rocks exposed consist of 
andesitic to rhyolitic volcanics of Oligocene the Miocene age. They have been intruded by 
granodiorites and porphyritic andesites.  
 
A stratigraphic column is show in Figure 5.  The following units are exposed in the project 
area: 
 

- TomA-TA is the oldest unit exposed in the main project area and consists of 
andesitic tuffs and breccias ranging in colour from brown-green through to a 
pale violet with horizons of dacitic tuff and scarce rhyolitic lithic breccias. The 
unit has an age date of 22.4 ± 4Ma using the K/Ar method on a andesitic 
ingminbrite giving it an assigned age of Upper Oligocene to Lower Miocene. 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  13 
June 29, 2011 
 

 
Figure 4.  Purisima local geology. 

 
- an angular unconformity is followed by TmTR-Ig, a sequence of white, grey 

and pink rhyolitic tuffs and ignimbrites with horizons of rhyo-dacitic volcanic 
breccias, dacites and andesitic tuffs and latite. Various age dates are available 
for this unit (18.7 ± 1.1Ma, 16.2 ±0.34Ma and 13.21 ± 0.35Ma) giving it an 
assigned Miocene age. 

- the sequence continues conformably into a rhyolite and rhyolitic tuff, TmR-
TR, ranging in colour from cream/grey through to pink. There are horizons of 
dacite and sporadic rhyolitic breccias. No age dates are available but from its 
stratigraphic position the unit is of Middle Miocene age. 

There are numerous dykes of basaltic and basaltic-andesite composition. They range in width 
from 1 to 25m and are green, dark green and dark grey. They have been dated as Miocene. 
 
In the north-west part of the main area of interest there are three granodioritic intrusives 
extending some 10 kilometers east-west by 5 kilometers north-south and dissected by 
faulting. They are phaneritic, fine to medium grained and grey to grey-green in color. Field 
relationships and an age date of 18.3Ma give them an assigned age of Miocene. To the south-
west of the claims, and forming a prominent ridge, is a sub-volcanic porphyritic andesite of 
Middle to Upper Miocene. 
The youngest mapped units are Quaternary and Holocene gravels and sediments on the banks 
and courses of the rivers and creeks in the area.   

 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  14

Figure 5.  Regional and local stratigraphy. 

The area has been affected by number of structures trending north-west to south-east and 
ranging in strike from 130-155o, paralleling the limit between the Sierra Madre Occidental 
and the Tepic-Zacoalca Graben. The dramatic effect of these faults can be seen by the almost 
90 o change in the direction of the Rio Grande de Santiago due to sinestral movement on the 
Las Blancas Fault (Figure 6). 
 
Figure 7 shows the simple shear, left lateral structural model for the Purisima/Las Blancas 
Fault. 
 
Antithetic to this is a second NE-SW trend striking between 025 and 040 o and a final third 
north-south trend. 
 
The area has not been subject to any major folding or deformation. 
 
5.2 Deposit Types 
 
The main type of mineral deposit that has been detected on the Purisma project so far is 
precious metal bearing quartz veins. The veins discovered to date outcrop in a small portion 
of the land package and the authors believe the potential exists for further discoveries. 
 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  15
June 29, 2011 

 
Figure 6.  Regional structure (Falla is Spanish for 'Fault'). 

 
The mineralization appears to be of the low-sulphidation epithermal type. This class of ore 
deposit hosts several world class gold mines including Cerro Vanguardia in Argentina, 
Round Mountain in the United States, Hishikari in Japan and Tayoltita in Mexico. 
 
There are a number of these deposit types that are advanced exploration projects and one 
mine within a 90-120 km radius of the Purisima project (Figures 8 and 22).  Figure 9 shows 
the location of major epithermal gold and silver deposits regionally within the Sierra Madre 
Belt.   
 
Low-sulphidation epithermal deposits are characterized by: 
 

- quartz veins, stockworks and breccias carrying gold, silver, electrum, 
argentinite and pyrite with lesser and variable amounts of base metal sulphides 
and sulphosalts. 

- associated with volcanic related hydrothermal and geothermal systems 
- formed at shallow depths, 1-3 kilometers 

 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  16
 June 29, 2011 

 
Figure 7.  Structural model for the Purisima deposit. 

- can be any age but due to shallow depth of formation Tertiary deposits are the 
most abundant. 

- mineralization is typically controlled by vertical structures but may extend out 
into permeable units 

- alteration includes silicification with multiple generation of quartz and 
chalcedony with common adularia and calcite. Sericite-illite and argillic 
alteration are common close to structures and grading out into distal propylitic 
alteration 

- textures include open space filling, crustification, colloform banding, multiple 
brecciation and replacement of blade calcite 

- high grade (bonanza) but normally low tonnage 
 
Many of these features have been recognized at Purisima and will be discussed in more 
detail in the following sections. 
 
 
5.3 Mineralization 
 
The Purisima Project consists of a system of veins associated with emplacement of rhyolite 
domes. 
 
The main structures of the Purísima project (as shown in Figure 10) are:   

1) The Purísima Vein-  a mineralized structure mined historically since the beginning of 
the century. 

2) The Agua Zarca Vein- a structure with typical epithermal mineralization of gold, 
silver and associated zone of rhyolite dikes within parallel structures developed 
during the same tectonic regime responsible for the Purisima vein.   

3) El Magistral and Dique Riolitico- structural targets believed to be related to the same 
system as the Purisma Vein.

Purisima Vein 
 
There has been production from the Purisima vein at various times over the last 100 years 
although there is no information available concerning mineralogy.  To the authors' 
knowledge, there has never been any mining on the Agua Zarca or El Magistral Veins.   
 
Although no production records are available, historic reports (cited in Section 17 
References, Coburn, 1973) show typical gold grades in the 3 to 15g/t range while silver 
values range from 60-300 g/t. Maximum values of 50g/t Au and 1360g/t Ag have been 
reported.  These reports also indicate that in the late 1950's Minas de Nayarit S.A. shipped a 
total of 982 metric tons of ore with an average grade of 12.89 g/t Au and 295.72 g/t Ag. 
 
These are historic figures and the authors make no claims about the accuracy or 
reliability of this data.  
 
Current exposures and accessible workings (most are flooded) show the Purisima vein 
consisting of quartz with weak to locally strong iron oxides and local pyrite. 
 
The observations of the authors are discussed below and in Section 7. 
 
Work by Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. has added considerably to the understanding of the 
Purisima veins and expanded the known outcropping mineralization from 600m to 4 
kilometers. See Figure 11.   
 
The Purísima vein is associated spatially and temporarily to the occurrence of a rhyolite dike, 
with flow textures (trachytic textures) and strong silicification and very fine disseminations of

quartz and pyrite.  Gold and silver values sometimes occur in the quartz-pyrite altered 
rhyolite adjacent to the quartz veins. 
 
Judging by the crosscutting relationships of the rhyolite dikes to related multiple stages of 
hydrothermal breccias and silicification, the rhyolite dikes record multiple episodes of 
magmatism. 
 
The Purisima vein/structure has been traced for 2 kilometers on the eastern side of the Rio 
Grande de Santiago (Figure 11). There is a difference of some 200m in elevation between the 
lowest exposures down by the river and the eastern end of the structure.  This structure trends 
N65°W, and changes direction in the area of the Purisima vein to E-W (Figure 10).  The 
structure dips an average of 70° to the south.  The structure is a simple shear with left-lateral 
offset.  The vein is located within andesite tuffs in the extreme NW and within rhyolite tuffs 
in the SE.  The thickness of the vein on the surface is 1.2 meters, and at depth is from 2-14.5 
meters in true width as indicated by the 2008 drilling.  The vein consists of white quartz with 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  20 
June 29, 2011 
 

banded, cockade, drusy textures and breccias including clasts of grey quartz bands and 
associated gold and silver mineralization. 
 
Figure 12 shows the farthest eastern exposure of the Purisima Vein found to date (517960E 
2407750N. All coordinates are in UTM Zone 13 North and Datum WGS84 unless otherwise 
stated) and corresponds to samples PUR-235 to PUR-244. The outcrops cover an area some 
5m by 4m with silicified and brecciated dacite with a zone of stockworking and veinlets some 
2m wide and trending 120o. The Purisima vein is more of a structural zone than a well 
defined vein at this locality.  
 
Moving west, the Pursima Vein becomes better defined with more veining, a wider structural 
zone with more and closer spaced outcrops.  Elevations are also falling meaning we are 
seeing deeper structural levels within the mineralized system (Figure 13). 
 
Figure 14 shows the most easterly major workings on the Purisima Vein. Here the vein is a 
well defined structure with veining, brecciation and strong sericite alteration and silicificaion 
of the host rocks and local moderate iron oxide. The vein is approximately 4m wide here and 
dipping 50o to the south. Samples from this locality are in the 0.1-0.5 g/t Au range but 
another working 40m to the west returned 12.3 g/t Au and 233 g/t Ag (PUR-14). 
 
Figures 15 and 16 show the main Purisima Vein where it outcrops beside the road to the 
Aguamilpa Dam.  Figure 17 shows a good exposure of well developed quartz vein with 
sericite alteration and moderate to strong iron oxides. PUR-02 returned 0.467 g/t Au and 37.8 
g/t Ag while PUR-03 returned 1.03 g/t Au and 32.9 g/t Ag.

Figure 17.  Samples PUR-02 and 03 with well developed veining and alteration. 

 
Recent work by Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. shows that the Purisima structure continues 
across the Rio Grande de Santiago and has been traced another 2 kilometers following the 
same north-west trend. 
 
Figure 18 shows sampling at the far western end of the structure (PUR-268 to PUR-276, 
5143800E 2410500N). The Purisima Structure on the western side of the river is much more 
of a silicified structure than a vein with lower temperature chalcedonic and opaline silica, 
little wallrock alteration and weak iron oxides. 
 
The geochemistry for samples from the western side of the river is also much less interesting. 
About half of the samples are below detection for gold and silver while the remainder 
returned gold values in the 0.007 to 0.043 g/t range while detectable silver values run from 
0.2 to 2.8 g/t. 
 
Although on the same structural trend the differences in mineralogy, alteration and 
geochemistry suggest we may be looking at a down faulted block west of the river and hence 
a higher structural level in the Purisima vein.   
 
Agua Zarca Vein 
 
The Agua Zarca vein is a quartz filled structure outcropping over 150 meters in strike, 
trending N30°E and bending to N60°E with an average dip of 65°-70° to the SE.  This 
structure is hosted within andesite tuff.  Assay results reflect anomalous As, Bs, Cu and Pb 
(As- 30ppm; Ba – 90ppm; Cu – 601ppm; Pb – 1750ppm) at the surface.  The anomalies of 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  24 
June 29, 2011 
 

 

 
Figure 18.  Sampling at the far western end of Purisima Structure. 

 
As, Ba and Pb correspond to the area where the vein changes strike from N30°E al N60°E .  
Anomalous values suggest a vertical zone where the outcrop of the vein is located near the 
transition zone between As-Sb-Ba-Hg and the zone of Au-Ag-Pb-Zn-Cu.  The structure 
indicates right lateral movement at the time of mineralization, and suggests a plunge of 
mineralization to the west. 
 
Dique Riolitico (Rhyolite Dike)  
 
The geological model proposed by Diaz and Corona (2009) following the 2008 drilling on the 
Purisima vein, suggests a close relationship between rhyolite dikes and veins in the project area.  The 
dikes located in the hangingwall of the Purisima vein are thought to be important structures for both 
localizing and hosting veins.  The Dique Riolitico target is a structural/lithological target coinsisting 
of linear parallel structures in the to the south, in the hangingwall of the Purisima vein.  This target 
consists of rhyolite dikes oriented NW50°-60°SE with local bending to the E-W with sub-
vertical dips.  These dikes have been traced in surface outcrop more than 1km each.  The 
dikes have flow and breccia textures; and are related to the ejection of a sequence of rhyolite 
tuffs, associated with argillic alteration and the presence of white clay alteration.  The assay 
results report anomalous values of up to (Ba) 600 ppm.  No precious metal assay values are 
known to the authors of this report.   
 
5.4 Workings on the Property 
 
Observations in the field show shafts and other workings along an approximately 300m strike 
length of the Purisima Vein where it outcrops beside the road to the Aguamilpa Dam. 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  25

Figures 19 and 20 show sketches of the workings with three main shafts, the deepest of which 
extends to almost 60m below surface and two galleries at 30m and 60m depth. 
 
The locations of shafts and workings shown in Figures 18 and 19 coincides with what is 
observed in the field however no access is available to the underground workings due to 
flooding up what would be the +15m level shown in Figure 18.  No historical production 
records are available for this project. 
 
5.5 Historical Estimation of Reserves 
 
No reserve estimates are available for the Purisima project. 
 
 
6.0 Exploration 
 
As mentioned previously the property has been the subject of various work programs and 
exploration campaigns. 
 
Details of the previous work programs are given below along with a brief summary and 
interpretation of the current exploration program. Sample locations for all located samples are 
shown in Figure 11.  Full results from the sampling are shown in Appendix 5. 
 
6.1 Previous Work 
 
The project has been the focus of several exploration programs and studies. The following 
reports were available to and reviewed by the authors, and cited at the end of this report: 
 
"Memorandum Re. Purisima Mine, Mexico", Robert M. Adams, August 1964. This report 
includes some of the original information from Mr Flynt who worked the property in the 
early 1900's. It details the results of the work carried out by Minas de Nayarit in the 
1950/60's and again goes into details about the economics or reopening the mine. 
 
"Supplemental to Memorandum of August the 3, 1964" Robert M. Adams, April 1972. This 
memo contains additional comments on grades, reserves (not 43-101 compliant) and possible 
operations at the Purisima Mine. 
 
"Purisima Mine, Mexico. 1971 Review", Arturo Abril Coburn, October 1973. This report 
contains extracts of various correspondence from the author Owen Miller detailing probable 
reserves (not 43-101 compliant), the economics of reopening the mine, sketches of the 
workings and sample results from around 90 samples. 
 
Since March, 2007 Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. has been carrying out a mapping, sampling 
and exploration program on the property as summarized below: 

• Geological mapping of 500 Has at a scale of 1:2000. 
• 668 surface geochemical samples have been collected to date and assayed for Au and 

Ag with accompanying ICP analysis. Sample locations are shown in Figure 11. 
• Structural analysis of the vein system. 
• Cross section and longitudinal section interpretation.

6.2 Interpretation  
 
The following is a synthesis of the work undertaken by the Electrum geologists and field 
observations by the authors. 
 
The Purisima district is classified as a low sulphidation epithermal vein with Au-Ag 
mineralization.  The hydrothermal system is genetically related to the abundant rhyolitic 
domes in the area. 
 
Mineral species include native silver, argentite, native gold and auriferous pyrite with trace 
base metal sulphides. Secondary minerals include malachite and manganese oxides. 
 
The veins themselves are composed of quartz with typical epithermal textures including 
replacement after calcite, banding and open space filling, with brecciation, stockworking and 
veining in the wallrocks. 
 
Alteration styles include intense silicification within the vein itself, argillization and some 
oxidation of the wallrock grading into weak propylitic alteration.  
 
The principal structure, known as the Purisima Vein is exposed as a quartz ridge around 5m 
wide and approximately 1.2 kilometers long although there are intermittent outcrops along 
the same structural trend for a total of 4 kilometers. 
 
The dominant structural trend is NW/SE and W-NW/ E-SE and dipping to the SW. 
Movement appears to have been left-lateral and this has led to NNW-SSE extension and 
dilation allowing emplacement of the most continuous and consistent extension of the 
Purisima vein in the area of the old workings shown in Figures 14 and 15. 
 
At the NW end of the Purisima Vein there is a N-S trending structure known as the Magistral 
Vein that formed under the same tectonic regime.

Given the size and geological characteristics of the Purisima District, a very close analog can 
be found in the Cinco Minas District located in the Hostotipaquillo Region some 80 
kilometers to the SE of Purisma as shown in Figure 23.  Table 5 shows the various 
characteristics of the two districts. 
 
Figures 24 and 25 show longitudinal and transverse sections of Purisima and Cinco Minas 
and help illustrate the similarities in the two systems. 
 
Cinco Minas lies on the same structural corridor as Purisima and was known in Pre-
Colombian times. The Spanish exploited the oxide zone while Anaconda Copper operated the 
mine from 1922 to 1928 with a reported production of 2.1 MT of mill feed from just one 
shoot. 
 
The authors have reviewed the work carried out by Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V., inspected 
the core drilled in 2008 and visited the concessions in the field.  Based on the review and 
field visits, the authors are in basic agreement with the interpretation of Minera Electrum 
S.A. de C.V. 
 
The geologic work done at the prospect to date supports the interpretation that there is a low 
sulphidation epithermal vein system on the Purisima project hosted by Oligocene to Miocene 
volcanic rocks. Further mineralization could possibly be discovered by additional 
exploration.

6.3 Reliability of Previous Exploration Data 
  
The authors were not present when the previous exploration data was obtained. 
Consequently, the authors cannot speak directly to the reliability of the data obtained during 
the previous exploration campaigns on the property.  The authors assume that the data is 
reliable and have not conducted an independent review or audit of that data. 
 
6.4 Exploration and Sampling by the Authors 
  
The author Owen Miller visited the property on the 13th of May, 2008 and was accompanied 
by Robert Harrington and Angel R. Cordoba.  The site was again visited on the 9th of May, 
2011 by co-author William Burnett, accompanied by Victor Hugo Mendoza Diaz of ECI. 
 
The exploration conducted for this report was intended to fulfill several objectives: 
 

- Confirm access 
- Revisit previous sample locations and inspect the core drilled and sampled in 2008 
- Obtain independent samples in order to verify the results of historic sampling.

Figure 25.  Transverse sections of the Cinco Minas and Purisima workings (at the same scale) 
showing the possible potential of the Purisima system and depth. 

 
All objectives were achieved. The authors visited relevant portions of the property, performed 
sampling on the surface near existing underground workings, and inspected the core drilled, 
sawn and sampled in 2008.   
 
The access routes to the project area, including International, Regional, and local were 
verified and found to be readily accessible at the time of the site visit.  The presence of towns, 
the quality of the roads, and evidence of other infrastructure and services were noted along 
the route. 
 
In addition, GPS surveying was carried out at the locations of samples, roads and other 
features of interest. 
 
The areas visited correspond approximately with previously reported sampling locations. 
During the first site visit evidence of previous sampling programs was abundant, including 
sample identification and geological markings indicating contact zones spray-painted on the 
surfaces. 
 
Details about the 2008 sampling method and approach are presented in Sections 8 and 9. 
 
The 2008 sampling program consisted of taking of total of six samples from surface 
exposures at various localities on the property in an effort to verify previously reported 
occurrences of high grade gold and silver mineralization. 
 
Exact sample locations and results for gold and silver from the samples collected for this 
report are shown in Figures 26 and 27. Sample descriptions corresponding to those samples 
shown on Figures 26 and 27, UTM coordinates, and gold and silver values for both 
Electrum's sampling and the author Owen Miller's sampling are presented in Table 6. Full 
geochemical results along with coordinates and other information are presented in Appendix 
5.

As would be expected there is some variation between the results for the Electrum sampling 
and from the author Owen Miller's sampling. Most samples have returned lower values 
although 130508-03 returned almost double the value for gold and two-thirds as much silver 
as the same Electrum sampling at the same locality. 
 
This kind of variation is common in high-grade epithermal vein systems and the results 
support the assumption that the information from the previous sampling is reliable. 

 
7. Drilling  
 
Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. conducted drilling on the Purisima project November 2 
through December 13, 2008.  The drill program was directly supervised by geologists Julio 
Cesar Perez (with 8 years experience in the mining industry) and Victor Hugo Mendoza Diaz 
(20 years in the mining industry).  The drilling program was carried out by two drilling 
contractors, SEGEOMEX (500.85 meters) and GLOBEXPLORE (847.05 meters).  The 2008 
drilling totaled 1,347.9 meters of HQ size core in 5 holes.  Drill sites were located by GPS 
and the drill was oriented for both azimuth and dip using a Brunton Compass.  Figure 28 
shows the location of the 2008 drill holes and cross section locations for figure in this section.  
 
Core from the drilling program was placed in corrugated plastic core boxes to be 
photographed, logged and sampled.  Boxes were labeled with sample IDs and sample 
intervals.  The completed drill holes were surveyed using a total station in Universal 
Transverse Mercator system using the North American Datum 1927 (NAD27).

Zone 13.  Drill hole collars were marked with hole IDs etched in concrete monuments (Fig. 
29). Down hole surveys were conducted on drill holes using a reflex survey tool to measure 
both azimuth and dip.   
 
Table 7 summarizes the 2008 drilling.  The drilling was designed to test two zones of 
mineralization on the first of three targets on the property, near the historical mine workings 
of the Purisima.  The mineralization in this area is characterized by an ore shoot within a 
mapped zone of dilation.  The main zone (main mineralized shoot) was tested with 4 drill 
holes and tested 300 meters of strike and 150 meters of depth below the historical Purisima 
Mine workings.  The fifth drill hole tested a target below a soil anomaly to the southeast of 
the Purisima mine and intercepted mineralization indicating the possibility of economic 
mineralization along both strike and dip connecting to the main zone.  Figure 30 is a long 
section showing the drill hole intersections along the vein and associated gold and silver 
grades.   
 
The Purisima vein dips 65-80 degrees to the south and southwest and strikes E-W to N68W.  
The drill holes are oriented perpendicular to strike of the main structure as mapped.  The 
2008 drilling indicates the true thickness of the vein is between 11 and 14.5 meters in the 
main zone and 2.0 meters thick in the southeastern extension of the main zone.

7.1 Drilling Results 
 
The 2008 drilling was successful in demonstrating vein continuity both along strike and down 
dip of the historical mine workings.  The results of the drilling program are as follows: 
 
Drill Hole EPP-1:  The total depth of this hole is 300.45 meters.  Drill hole EPP-1 drilled 
through andesite to a depth of 159.2 meters where it intersected the Purisima Vein 50 meters 
below historic workings (Figure 31).  The mineralized intercept is 17 meters thick (estimated 
true width of 14 meters).  Where EPP-1 intersects the vein, the vein is characterized by 
multiple episodes of hydrothermal brecciation and variable textured quartz (banded, drusy) 
with traces of fine white and gray bands of quartz + sulfide +/- adularia.  Secondary alteration 
minerals include calcite, pyrite, epidote, sercicite, and smectite.  The wallrocks are intensely 
alterered.  The felsic rhyolite dike in the footwall of the vein contains spherulitic textures, 
which Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. interpreted as typical of a rhyolite dike ejecta.  The vein 
shows strong evidence of epithermal mineralization associated with a rhyolite dome.

and 100 meters below the surface (Figure 33).  The wall rocks are logged as andesites cut by 
the Purisima vein and associated rhyolite dike.  The mineralized intercept is 16.1 meters thick 
(estimated true width of 13 meters).  The vein in this intercept is characterized by 
hydrothermal breccias with banded, drusy and cockade quartz textures.  Geologists identified 
at least three pulses of quartz within the matrix of the breccias.  The first event is marked by 
massive white quartz without sulfides.  The second generation of quartz is characterized by 
banded quartz with the presence of bands of fine sulfides and a greenish color (probably due

eastern end, 80 meters below the surface where the vein is oriented N22oW, 350 meters to the 
southeast of the historical mine workings (Figure 35).  The hanging wall rocks are logged as 
andesite.  The mineralized intercept is 2.5 meters thick (estimated true width of 2 meters).  
The immediate hanging wall and footwall of the vein is within a ryholite dike.  The 
hangingwall vein is characterized by hydrothermal breccias consisting of silicified matrix, 
vein quartz and white andesite tuff clasts with no notable sulfides.  The Purisma vein was

Alteration and Mineralization 
 
Three separate stages of brecciation and quartz flooding were recognized in the 2008 drilling 
of Purisima.  Variable alteration stages are present within the clasts in the vein as well as in 
the wallrocks.  In the wall rocks rhyolite tuffs experience strong silicification and andesite 
tuffs exhibit propylitic alteration and iron oxidation.   
 
The zone of veining and mineralization is associated with argillic alteration, and sericitized 
and propylitically altered breccia clasts.  The vein also contains smectite clays, illite and 
adularia.  Figure 35 shows the spatial association of alteration to the three identified 
silicification/brecciation/mineralization/alteration phases.

8. Sampling Method and Approach  
 
2008 Field Visit 
 
During the author Owen Miller's site visit in 2008 a total of six samples were collected for 
geochemical analysis.  
 
All samples were classified as grab samples. The samples typically contained between 1 and 
4kg of material chipped into plastic sample bags. A sample tag was completed for each 
sample in a sample book, with a portion of the tag with the sample ID number being placed 
into the bag.  
 
The samples were of high quality, meaning that the sample was representative of the 
geological material being sampled and its original location can be verified. 
 
2008 Drill Program 
 
In the 2008 drill program core recovery was measured and averaged 98%.  Samples of core 
were chosen based on geological constraints (lithology, structure, mineralization and 
mineralogy) with obvious high grade material sampled seperately, and marked for sawing to 
obtain the best, unbiased representative sample possible, no shorter than 30cm per sample.  
Once core was logged and marked, it was photographed.  Core was cut into equal halves 
using a diamond core saw where competent, and a wedge where friable.  Best efforts were 
made to cut the core perpendicular to the vein contacts.  Core was sawn to two equal halves, 
one half placed in a labeled sample bag, the second half placed back in the box as a witness.  
The core saw was cleaned between each sample to minimize contamination.  The co-author, 
William Burnett, validated the sampled intervals by inspecting well labeled core boxes and 
sample intervals and grade.  The core is stored in a building near the Purisima site. 
 
QA/QC Procedures were followed as outlined in ECI's Procedimientos QA/QC 
(Asequriamiento y Control de Calidad).  The procedures include the use of an accredited 
laboratory, insertion of SRM and CRM (Standard Reference Material and Certified Reference 
Material), duplicate samples, blanks, and replicates (twin samples) at a frequency of 1/30 
samples.  The blanks and standards are inserted within sample batches to monitor laboratory 
sequencing errors, analytical errors, sample preparation issues and analytical precision.  
Blanks were composed of silica sand, and three gold reference standards (high, medium and 
low Au grade) were used.  Standards were obtained from RockLabs, New Zealand.  Replicate 
samples are quarter sawn core from the same interval.    
 
9. Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security  
 
2008 Field Visit 
 
All samples were taken by, or under the direct supervision of Owen Miller Ph.D, Mem. 
AusIMM, a Consultant Geologist for Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. 
 
The samples were catalogued, described, tagged and bagged. They were shipped by the 
Author Owen Miller to Guadalajara and then picked up by the assay lab. There had been no 
tampering with the samples.

Samples from the Purisima project were analyzed by ALS Chemex Laboratories in 
Guadalajara, Mexico. A 30 gram split from each sample (PREP-31) was assayed for gold by 
standard fire assay methods with an AA finish (Au-AA23). A 250 gram split from each 
samples was then assayed for multi element analysis by ICP methods (ME-ICP41). High 
grade gold samples (>10 g/t) were analysed using gravitmetric analysis (Au-GRA21). See 
Appendix 4 for details concerning ALS Chemex Laboratories assaying protocol and ISO 
9001 accreditations. 
 
2008 Drill Program 
 
Drill core was sawn using a masonry saw with a diamond blade under the supervision of a 
trained geologist.  Core and rock samples were placed in labeled, tagged, tied sample bags 
and stored on site under Minera Electrum's geological supervision.  Samples were delivered 
under the supervision of a geologist and delivered by Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V. directly 
to Guadalajara (3 hours) and delivered to ALS Chemex. 
 
Routine samples were weighed, split, crushed to 70% <2mm, split and pulverized using 
standard chrome steel jaws, rings and pucks to 85% <75 microns.   
 
All core samples were analyzed using ME-ICP41 (35 element Aqua Regia ICP-AES), Hg-
CV41 (cold vapor/AAS for trace Hg), Ag-OG46 (ore grade Ag-Aqua Regia), ME-OG46 (ore 
grade elements – Aqua Regia), and Au-AA23 (Au 30g FA-AA finish). 
 
It is of the authors' professional opinions that the Quality Control procedures and results 
implemented by Minera Electrum were satisfactory, and no significant analytical issues were 
encountered.  
 
10. Data Verification  
 
2008 Field Visit 
 
Due to the limited sampling carried out during this program no standards or duplicates where 
submitted with the samples. However, eleven standards and five blanks were inserted by the 
laboratory as part of their own internal check. The samples returned the expected results.  
 
It was not possible to verify the results of the historical sampling on the property but the 
current sampling program was intended to provide confirmation of the previous programs and 
also to provide an independent assessment of the project potential based on the relationship of 
the sample results and the expected deposit model. 
 
2008 Drill Program 
 
Quality control samples were inserted in the drill core sample shipments and submitted for 
assay in the form of standards, blanks and replicates.  Standard gold values of 7.635 g/t, 
1.282 g/t and 0.610 g/t were used.  Silica sand previously commercially tested was used as 
blank material.   
 
All standard results analyzed for the drill program were compared to the known assays and 
were within 96.8% of predicted values, with the exception of one low grade standard that 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  46 
June 29, 2011
 
 

assayed slightly below the 95% confidence level.  All blank assays passed, indicating no 
contamination issues with the lab.  Most duplicate and replicate samples were within 
expected ranges for this type of gold system.  
 
11. Adjacent Properties  
 
To the authors' knowledge, there are no exploration or mining properties adjacent to Purisima 
as defined by NI 43-101.  However there are advanced exploration and mining properties in 
the Tepic area and offer encouragement with regards to the exploration potential of the 
district.      
 
12. Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing  
 
Due to the fact that the Purisima project is in the early exploration stage with respect to 
mining properties, no mineral processing or metallurgical testing has been conducted on 
mineral samples taken from this project. 
 
13. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates  
 
Although estimates of reserves are presented in the reports cited under previous work on the 
property none of these are compliant with NI 43-101. At the current stage of work on the 
property no admissible estimates of resources or reserves are possible. 
 
14. Interpretation and Conclusions  
 
The project described in this report constitutes a prospective exploration project in an area of 
the world known for its mineral occurrences.  The project is considered to be in the early 
stages of exploration. It is of the author and co-authors' opinions as Qualified Persons 
responsible for this report that the drilling density is adequate for this early stage project, and 
that the data is reliable and accurate.   
 
The 2008 drill program confirmed the presence of gold and silver mineralization within the 
Purisima vein system down dip and along strike of historical mine workings.  Surface 
mapping, sampling and drilling confirm a robust zone of mineralization exceeding 600 
meters in strike and 150 meters along dip.  Surface sampling indicates silver grades 0-5 ppm 
over a kilometer southeast along strike from the main showings.  Drilling indicates vein 
thicknesses from 2-14.5 meters, with average vein thickness in the main dilation zone 11-14.5 
meters.  The gold and silver grades identified in the drilling are similar to other deposits in 
the region with gold grades 0.17-25ppm and silver grades from 5-135ppm.  Figure 36 is an 
isometric diagram illustrating the mineralization model and untested potential of this system 
resulting from the 2008 exploration program and field surveys. 
 
Surface mapping and sampling, underground mine rehabilitation, mapping and sampling and 
infill drilling as a continuation of the 2008 program are required to advance this project.      
 
Based on the sampling and the information collected to-date it is concluded that the property 
could contain a sizeable precious metal deposit in veins, breccia and stockwork zones hosted 
by Lower Miocene volcanic rocks of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The identified 
mineralization remains open at depth and along strike.  The grade of the mineralization 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  47
 June 29, 2011
 
 

intercepted in the 2008 drilling confirms encouraging grades that remain fairly consistent 
throughout the shoot.  
 
It is of the opinion of the authors, as Qualified Persons responsible for this report, that all 
exploration work conducted by Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V., has met the planned 
objectives.  Furthermore the authors conclude that the Purisima property warrants the work 
program described in this report.

deposit, showing untested mineralization potential at depth and along strike. 

 
15. Recommendations  
 
The following recommendations for a two phase work program was developed by Victor 
Hugo Mendoza Diaz and Julio Ceasar Antonio Perez Corona of ECI Mining and Exploration, 
Inc..  The authors, Qualified Persons for this report, have reviewed the plan and the estimated 
cost and are of the opinion that the proposed program has significant merit, will advance the 
project, and can be executed at the estimated cost. 
 
General Program 
 
This proposed diamond drilling program is primarily is based upon data compiled from 
previous work.  Proposed are the following activities to follow up on the 2008 exploration 
and drilling as summarized below: 

• Geological mapping at a scale of 1:2000 in the area of rhyolite dikes. 
• Collection of 30 surface geochemical samples. 



 
 

Technical Report on the Purisima Property  48 
June 29, 2011
 
 

• 5 drill holes on the Purisima vein 
• Structural analysis of veins and lineaments.  
• Construction and interpretation of cross sections and longitudinal sections of the 

Purisima vein, Agua Zarca and ryholite dikes. 
• Regional interpretation of the work generated by Minera Electrum S.A. de C.V.. 
• Interpretation of clay map generated by Aster image analysis. 

 
Exploration Program Objectives 
 
All significant structures on the project have characteristics of being formed in an epithermal 
environment; open-filling, banded and replacement textures.  Multiple episodes of intrusions 
and mineralizing events belong to the same tectonic regime as the primary regional 
structures. 
 
The main target is the Purísima vein, located within the largest fault in the region (oriented 
NW/SE), and rhyolite dikes located to the south of this principal fault.  Secondary exploration 
targets are the Agua Zarca and the Magistral veins that are within structures related to the 
same system, and the Dique Riolitico target which is believed to be conduits related to the 
veining on the property. 
 
Purisima Target 
Based on this interpretation and model, 6 drill holes are proposed for the Purisima vein for 
phase 1 drilling.  The objectives of these holes are: 
 

1) To explore the footwall rhyolite dike. 
2) Infill drilling along the Purisima vein. 
3) And test for mineralization in the hangingwall structure south of the Purisima vein.

Proposed Drill Hole "A":  This drill hole is intended to explore the area which includes the 
contact below the rhyolite dike in the andesite tuffs and test for economic mineralization 
within the area between EPP-1 and EPP-2.  The rhyolite dike in contact with the andesite 
tuffs contained values up to 8.35 g/t Au and 568 g/t Ag (EPP-1), confirming the existence of 
mineralization below the dike, opening up the possibility of locating additional mineralized 
zones (Figure 38).

Program Summary 
 
A two phase exploration program is recommended.  Phase 2 is contingent upon positive 
results from Phase 1 of the program. 
 

- Phase 1: Further mapping and sampling of the concessions to follow up on the 
strike extents of the veins, baseline environmental study, preparation of drill 
roads and platforms and a core drilling program of 3000m designed to test the 
continuity of mineralization down dip and along strike of known 
mineralization. Estimated cost: US$750,000 

 
- Phase 2: Contingent upon results of the Phase 1 exploration, a third drill 

program of 5000m would be undertaken for infill drilling and collection of 
material for metallurgical testing.  Estimated Cost: US$1,100,000. 
 

In summary the proposed Phase 1 drill program includes 3,000 meters of core drilling as 
follows:
