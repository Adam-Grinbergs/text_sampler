1.0 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 
This report was prepared for Rizal Resources Corporation ("Rizal" or "the Company"), a company 

incorporated in British Columbia, Canada and listed on the TSX Venture Exchange ("TSXV").  The report 

is a summary of available information at the T'Boli Gold-Silver Project ("T'Boli Project" or "the Project") 

the main project within the T'Boli Property "T'Boli Property" or "the Property"), up to the effective 

date of the report. 

There is no current Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimate for the T'Boli Project or for the 

broader T'Boli Property and the focus of the current activities by the Company is on gathering 

geological information for the purpose of completing a new Mineral Resource estimate.  The business 

objective of the Company is to complete the work necessary to permit the evaluation of a commercial 

production decision.  There is no guarantee that future exploration will result in the establishment of 

a Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserves in quantities large enough to justify an economically viable 

project.  Any production in the absence of a feasibility study and associated Mineral Reserves 

demonstrating economic and technical viability is associated with an increased risk of failure of the 

mining operation due to increased uncertainty of results. 

The author, Steven Olsen, is an independent "Qualified Person" as is defined in NI 43-101 and has 

experience with regard to the exploration, discovery, definition and mining of complex gold deposits 

similar to the T'Boli Project. 

1.2 Property Location and Ownership 
The T'Boli Project is situated approximately 40km due east of the city of General Santos and lies within 

the province of South Cotabato on the Island of Mindanao in the Philippines.  The Property is made 

up of two agreements, known as MPSA (Mineral Production Sharing Agreement) No.090-97-XI and 

APSA (Application for a Production Sharing Agreement) No. 51-XI.  These types of agreements cover 

the rights to the Mining of Minerals as determined by the laws of the Philippines.  

Both agreements are owned 100% by the Philippine company Tribal Mining Corporation ("TMC"), 

which in turn is owned 40% by Rizal (maximum allowable under Philippines laws).  An option 

agreement exists between TMC and Rizal which provides for all revenues earned from the mining and 

processing operations to pertain to Rizal in return for a 0.5% royalty on the gross revenue earned from 

the operations. 

1.3 Geology and Mineralisation 
The Project lies within a mountain range known as the Daguma Range that has formed as part of a 

magmatic arc related to a subduction zone, which exists in the Celebes Sea along the position of the 

Cotabato Trench.  The rocks that have formed within the Daguma Range are dominated by 

Volcaniclasitic Rocks from various volcanic events over time and are intruded in places by a more 

competent magmatic rock, which locally is observed in the form of a porphyritic Dacite rock.  These 

two major rock types make up the host rocks for the gold mineralisation that exists at the Project.   

In terms of the structural setting, it is interpreted that a long-standing period of east-west 

compression, due to the location of Mindanao existing in between two converging subduction zones, 

has resulted in a dominant large scale north-west striking sinistral strip-slip (transverse) faults that 

exist in the south western corner of Mindanao.  Similar faults also developed at the T'Boli Project, with 



Rizal Resources Corporation  T'Boli Gold-Silver Project 

6 | P a g e  
 

sympathetic smaller scale north-west striking faults having a major influence on the location of the 

gold mineralisation at the Project.   

The gold mineralisation exists predominantly in association with tensional faults which link between 

the many north-west striking strike-slip faults.  These linking faults appear to have developed in a 

localised extensional environment creating normal fault movement along predominantly steep 

southerly dipping faults, breccias and veins with occasional linking normal faults dipping in the 

opposing direction to the north. 

The geological environment and alteration associated with the gold mineralisation at T'Boli is 

indicative of the deposit having developed in an intermediate to high level environment close to the 

surface, often referred to as a "low sulphidation epithermal" environment.  Whilst the structural 

controls on the emplacement of the gold and silver at the T'Boli Project have a very strong influence, 

the interpreted depth of the mineralisation may also influence the amount of gold and silver that 

exists throughout the deposit, which will be uncovered with further exploration. 

1.4 Exploration Information and Data 
The exploration activities at the T'Boli Project have focussed on a number of phases of diamond drilling 

programs and underground development to expose and explore the mineralised structures.  The 

diamond drilling has returned a large number of significant high-grade gold assays, which has provided 

confidence that the Project does contain substantial quantities of gold for the consideration of a future 

mining operation.  However, the complexity and continuity of these drill intersections were very 

difficult to interpret without exposing these structures hosting the gold mineralisation and defining 

these structures and the associated gold mineralisation over a broad area. 

Therefore, the decision has been made at multiple stages to develop access into the locations 

indicated by the drilling, and as indicated by the shallow small-scale gold mining, that existed on these 

structures.  The development has occurred over two broad periods, including the current 

development program.  Two large scale vein systems have been defined from this underground 

development, which are known as the north veins and the south veins.  The north veins exist in the 

porphyritic Dacite host rock and are closer to the access from the side of the mountain where the 

portal locations and the mine site exists on the surface.  This has resulted in a reasonable 

understanding of the north veins on one level, with a second level of exploration and development in 

progress. 

The south veins are an additional 80m to the South, which exist in the Volcaniclastic rock and are yet 

to be fully developed on one level.  The drilling information indicates that this vein system has high 

grade gold mineralisation developed in this area, and the host rock appears to be more permeable, 

leading to the interpretation that greater amounts of gold bearing fluids may have passed through 

this rock unit in comparison to the north veins which exist in the more competent and less permeable 

porphyritic Dacitic rock. 

The combined results from the underground development and drilling information appears to identify 

over 300m of strike length on both the north veins and south veins that have potential for high grade 

gold mineralisation.  The combined sections of high grade mineralisation defined to date totals more 

than 450m of strike length.  Definition and confirmation of the continuity of the gold in between the 

levels has yet to be established and this work is planned to take place (along with trial mining) in the 

coming months.

1.5 Conclusions and Recommendations 
The current focus at the T'Boli Project is constrained within a relatively small section of the of the 

T'Boli Property and of the greater potential mineralised region.  This ongoing work program is critical 

to understanding the key controls of the gold and silver mineralisation at the Project, and it is 

recommended to continue this approach up to the point that the understanding of the controls on 

the gold mineralisation will allow for a greater confidence in the interpretation and estimation of a 

Mineral Resource from future drilling programs. 

Of significance to the larger scale prospects and broader definition in the future is to consider testing 

at much greater depths for gold mineralisation particularly on the south veins.  Combining this 

information with some technical studies on the alteration minerals may help to understand how large 

the system is, and possibly define or discover the most favourable locations where gold has come out 

of solution (Boiling Zone) to form the highest concentration of gold in the region.  However, prior to 

any deeper drill testing, it is also recommended that the Company consider the use of more advanced 

and detailed geophysical surveys.  It is the view of the author that a detailed magnetic survey 

combined with an Induced Polarisation ("IP") survey could be the most cost-effective way of 

discovering a much larger part to this epithermal gold system at the Project.  Completing this survey 

prior to any future drilling will aid greatly in positioning the drill tests into the best locations for 

possible large scale and high-grade gold mineralisation.   

It is estimated that a reasonable budget to complete an IP survey and detailed magnetic survey 

including the required processing and interpretation would be in the order of C$150,000 to C$200,000. 

Follow up drilling which required surface drilling is anticipated to cost more than C$1.5 million in the 

initial phase to effectively test the potential from any targets identified from the IP and magnetic 

surveys. 

Targets that exists close to the existing mine site may be tested from the underground workings after 

a dedicated tunnel is completed in an optimal position.  It is roughly estimated that a budget of 

between C$600,000 and C$800,000 would be required for an initial phase of drill testing from a 

dedicated underground drilling position.

4.2 Nature of Title and Interest of the T'Boli Gold-Silver Property 
The ownership structure of the T'Boli Property and T'Boli Project was established on February 15, 
2004, as documented in a report provided by Andresan (2004) and as summarised in Christopher 
(2005) as follows:  
 

In 2004, Sur American Corporation (now Rizal Resources Corporation) acquired a 40% direct 
interest in Tribal Mining Corporation ("TMC") which legally holds 100% interest in the T'Boli 
property tenements. Sur American and TMC entered into a Mineral Processing Option 
Agreement by virtue of which TMC granted Sur American irrevocable and exclusive option to 
enter into a mineral processing agreement in respect of the right to process the ore from TMC 
mineral areas. The parties agreed that both shall agree upon a fee or royalty to be paid by Sur 
American to TMC in an amount not greater than one half of one percent (0.50%) of the gross 
revenue earned from operations. The parties likewise agreed to provide that the net revenue 
earned from processing and mining operations in the project areas shall pertain solely to Sur 
American (Andresan, 2004). 

 
More recent documentation sighted by the author with regard to the nature of the title and legal 

interest in the T'Boli Property and T'Boli Project has been provided by legal firm Fortun, Navasa and 

Salazar in a letter dated May 3, 2017 (Salazar, R. 2017).   This report identifies the following: 

The T'Boli project is comprised of the two tenements MPSA (Mineral Production Sharing 

Agreement) No. 090-97-XI ("the MPSA") and APSA (Application for Production Sharing 

Agreement) No. 51-XI which are held in the name of Tribal Mining Corporation (TMC).  

The MPSA has an area of 84.98 Ha and was approved 20 November 1997. The MPSA is an 

agreement for mineral sharing with the Philippines and has a term of 25 years that can be 

renewed for a further 25 years (prior to November 20, 2022). The APSA has an area of 2,904.24 

Ha and was awarded to TMC26 January 1998 (Figure 2).  The MPSA pursuant to the Republic 

Act No. 7942, An act instituting a New System of Mineral Resources Exploration, Utilization 

and Conservation and its revise implementing rules and regulations provide for the 

exploration, sustainable development and commercial utilization of copper, gold, 

molybdenum, silver, etc and other deposit existing within the contract area, with all necessary 

services, technology, and financing to be furnished or arranged by the contractor and TMC 

under the contract is constituted and appointed as the exclusive entity to conduct mining 

operations in the contract area. 

4.3 Surface rights 
TMC has the surface rights to access the mine workings and a government permit to transport material 

from the mine site to the mineral process plant.  Despite the fact that the rights up to the surface have 

been granted to TMC, there is a practice at a local level of small scale miners accessing the shallow 

parts of the gold mineralisation from a series of small underground tunnels ("small scale miners").  

This is a practice that has existed since the initial discovery of gold in the region in the 1980's. 

To enable TMC to operate uninhibited on its mining lease the Company has entered into an agreement 

with the small-scale miners in the immediate area constrained within its MPSA known as the Drain 

tunnel. The cooperative of small scalers agreed to cede possession and control of the Drain Tunnel 

which is adjacent to the Mafoko Tunnel. In turn the small-scalers agreed to payment terms over 5 

years. This agreement effectively has enabled TMC to carry out operating activities uninterrupted.

4.4 Royalties and Penalties 
Rizal operates the project through affiliated company TMC and has an exclusive right on the basis of 

a Mineral Processing Agreement to process material from the TMC areas for a fee or royalty payable 

to TMC in an amount not greater than 0.5% of gross revenue from operations. 

Additional government and local taxes are tabulated in Table 2 below (Salazar R., 2017).

4.5 Environmental Liabilities and Encumbrances 
TMC has an approved environmental protection and enhancement program and final rehabilitation 

and/or decommissioning plan dated July 2012.  This plan provides for detailed descriptions with regard 

to the required environmental management and final rehabilitation of the T'Boli Project in connection 

with any future production at the mine site. 

As part of the approved rehabilitation plan, there is a requirement for the Company to make gradual 

payments into a "Rehabilitation Fund" over the life of the MPSA (granted up to November 20, 2022) 

up to a total of P42.4 million (C$1.06 million at exchange rate of 40:1, C$ to PHP) 

4.6 Permits Required for Conducting the planned Exploration Activities 
The Company has in place the permits it requires to operate as an exploration Company within the 

MPSA, which is still at the exploration stage.  A summary of the current permits and subsequent 

additional permitting requirements are summarised as follows. (note: the use of the word "ore" in this 

section is used to accurately reflect the terminology used in the permits that are associated with the 

T'Boli Project and are not meant to imply that the project has any currently defined Mineral Resources 

or Mineral Reserves). 

4.6.1 Approvals for Exploration Development 
TMC has been granted an amended Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) for the extraction of 

"Ore for Gold Mining" located at Sitio Tunnel, Barangay Kematu, T'boli, South Cotabato by the 

Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), through the Environmental Management 

Bureau, Region XII. The ECC issuance is under the purview of Presidential Decree 1586. The scope of 

the ECC covers the extraction of "Ore for Gold Mining" at the Project contained only within the mining 

development project area of 84 hectares under the MPSA -090-97-XI located in the above-said place 

and that the "ore extraction capacity" of the project shall not exceed 140,000 MT per year.

4.6.2 Approvals for Mineral Processing 
The Philippines government has granted permission for TMC to mine within the MPSA and undertake 

mining and milling operations up to 72,000 tonnes of "ore" per annum.  TMC has been issued a five 

(5) Year Mineral Processing Permit (MPP) Tenement No. 001-2012 –XII, dated November 05, 2012 and 

expired on November 4, 2017, by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, a line Bureau of the Department 

of Environment and Natural Resources responsible and accountable on the supervision and 

monitoring of the Large-Scale Mining Industry activities issued with Mineral Agreements. On February 

9, 2018, a renewal Mineral Processing Permit was issued to TMC which will expire on February 8, 2023. 

Under the general conditions of the ECC, TMC has secured all necessary requirements as CCO 

Registration Certificate for the use of Cyanide pursuant to RA 6969 otherwise known as the "Toxic 

substance and Hazardous Nuclear Waste Act of 1990" Permit to Operate, Air Pollution, Source and 

Control Installation for the generator sets, Waste Water Discharge Permit, Hazardous Waste 

Generator Registration Certificate. The Hazardous Wastes and Materials Recovery Facilities as well as 

Mechanical and Electrical Permits were issued to TMC. Also, all other special conditions provided in 

the ECC were complied with by TMC. Similarly, under the operation of the Mineral Processing Plant, 

TMC has been granted an Amended, Environmental Compliance Certificate R -121508-0065 for the 

Gold Processing Plant project located at Purok Pag-asa, Barangay Edwards, T'boli, South Cotabato by 

the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) through the EMB whereby all General 

conditions as well as special conditions were complied with by the TMC.  

For the Tailings storage facility, the amended ECC for the Gold- Processing Plant Project provides that 

the operation of a Gold – Processing Plant Project and its appurtenances within the 4.1 hectares area 

covered with TCT Nos. T -941, TCT – T -1539, and TCT –T – 4650 wherein the TSF 1, 2, 3 and 4 of TMC 

are located and constructed.  

4.6.3 Approvals required prior to production 
On April 30, 2015, the DENR issued an Administrative Order (DAO) 2015-07 requiring all contractors 

of mines in the operating stage to secure an ISO14001 Certification.  As TMC is deemed not to be at 

the operating stage it is not currently subject to this requirement. 

4.6.4 Requirement for a Social Development Plan 
The Philippines Government requires mining companies to obtain agreements with local residents and 
indigenous people prior to mining activities taking place.  TMC has in place the required agreements 
which were obtained as part of its Community Development Program, which will expire prior to the 
end of 2018.  It is anticipated that extensions to this agreement and an update to the Company's 
Community Development Program will be required in connection with future mining activities at the 
project. 
 

4.6.5 Other Surface Exploration Activities 
With regard to all other surface based exploration activities, the MPSA and APSA permits held by TMC 

and duly recognized by the Philippine government allow for the recommended exploration work 

programs. Exploration work programs are prepared as three (3) year work programs that are approved 

by the MGB (Mines & Geoscience Bureau) and are updated by Rizal and TMC as required.  There are 

no planned surface exploration work programs in place at this point in time, and approval will be 

required for any planned surface-based exploration activities that are outside of the activities 

associated with the T'Boli mine site.

4.7 Significant Factors and Risks 
In July 2012 the Philippines government approved an executive order which effectively provides for a 

moratorium on all new mining project approvals.  The current approved MPSA associated with the 

T'Boli Project has been approved up to November 20, 2022.  While there have been positive discussion 

and announcements by the Philippines government with regard to lifting this moratorium, there is no 

guarantee that this moratorium will be lifted or that another impediment to obtaining future mining 

approvals will not develop. 

The Company does not have a current Mineral Resources at this point in time.  There is no guarantee 

that future exploration will result in the establishment of a Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserves in 

quantities large enough to justify an economically viable project.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 

AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1  Access 
There is a domestic airport at General Santos City with multiple daily flights from the international 

airport in Manila (NAIA).  Access to T'Boli from General Santos is initially via a paved highway to the 

local towns of Koronadal City and Surallah and then on to the township of T'Boli (Figure 3). 

From the T'Boli town site the Property can be accessed via a gravel and secondary roads and trails to 

various locations within the Property and main underground workings.

Santos, highlighting the position relative to extinct volcanic crater of Mt Parker, and the road access 

from General Santos, up to Koranadal, then Surallah and then back down to the township of T'Boli. 

5.2 Climate 
The T'Boli area is centred at 6o13'N latitude which results in a tropical climate.  The area is typical of 
tropical rainforest environments with rain throughout the year but a heavy rain season from June 
through October influenced by the southwest monsoons.  The northeast trade winds influence the 
climate from December through May resulting in a dryer season from February through May.  An 
average of 1770mm of rain falls annually. 
 



Rizal Resources Corporation  T'Boli Gold-Silver Project 

16 | P a g e  
 

The elevation in the T'Boli region, is between 500m and 800m above sea level, which provides for a 
slightly lower temperature and humidity in comparison to the lower lying coastal regions.  
Temperatures range from 18o to 30oC with generally high humidity. The average temperature is about 
24.4oC with cooler months from November to February and hotter from March through May.  
 
The area is protected from typhoons by local mountains and is outside the 10o40' latitudes where 
typhoons are more prevalent.   
 
Activities at T'Boli are not expected to be significantly impacted by seasonal variations and the project 
is accessible all year round. 
 

5.3 Flora and Fauna 
Throughout the island of Mindanao, most of the traditional forested areas have been cleared and now 

have become grazing land, with the more fertile land portions used for crops. 

Mindanao has no large predators except for pythons, cobras, the world's largest eagle and rare sea 

water crocodiles. There are 1100 recorded land invertebrates, 100 mammal species, and 170 bird 

species.  

Within the MPSA and APSA district, the predominant fauna is domesticated livestock and the 

landscape is characterized by patchy forest interspersed with agricultural plots planted to corn, 

pineapple, bananas and other fruit trees by the local inhabitants. There are also industrial pineapple 

and banana plantations. 

5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
There is an international airport in Manila and Davao as well a domestic airport at General Santos. The 

access to the Project is serviced by 100km of generally well maintained all weather roads from General 

Santos. 

Power is available via the Mindanao power grid and water is abundant from within the underground 

excavations. Power at the mine portal is supplied by diesel generators to provide underground 

dewatering and ventilation. Additional diesel generators are located at camp accommodation and trial 

milling facilities.   

At the time of the site visit by the author, Grid Power had been established at the Company's 

processing plant and connections were being established up to the Company's mine site.  It is 

anticipated that, the Project in the future will be connected to Grid Power removing the requirement 

for the use of the diesel generators (other than for back-up power). 

Philippines has a long history of underground mining and an additional skilled underground workforce 

can be assembled from alternative mining locations within the Philippines. 

At the current point in time the processing plant utilises recycled water from its tailings facility which 

is adequate for the small tonnage rate that is currently being processed as part of the exploration 

development activities.

5.5 Physiography  
The municipality of T'Boli is nestled in a moderately rugged to rolling terrain with valleys and steep 

mountainous slopes. The largest mountain, Mt Malibengog volcano (more popularly known as Mt 

Parker) has a water-filled caldera called Lake Holon (formerly called Lake Maughan) and is now a 

tourist attraction (Figure 3). 

The Property district topography is dominated by paleo-volcanic piles and intrusions that have been 

rapidly eroded by the tropical climate, that has created a geomorphology of steep volcanic slopes, 

ridgelines, incised rivers systems and local broad fertile plains.

6.0 HISTORY 

6.1  Past Exploration 
Gold was first discovered in the T'Boli region by local prospectors in the early 1980's.  This discovery 

led to a period called the T'Boli gold rush, which was a period of artisanal style small scale mining, 

which peaked in the early 1990's.  Cooper (2002) reports that records of gold buyers indicated that 

some 400,000ozs (gold silver ratio unknown) was extracted by small scale miners using basic hand-

held mining methods. 

More organized mining groups later accessed deeper parts of the mineralization by excavating the 

380m Beehive and 260m Cualing adits.  Both the Beehive and Cualing adits exist within Rizal's MPSA 

and APSA respectively.  The Beehive adit exists close to the current mine workings but is no longer 

accessible. 

The first modern exploration in the T'Boli area was conducted between 1994 and 1996 by Chase 

Minerals Corporation and Lemura Minerals Resources Corporation and included sampling of artisanal 

workings, regional mapping, ground magnetics, soil geochemistry, trenching and diamond drilling.  

Cooper (2002) summarised the exploration work completed during this period as follows: 

• Soil sampling on 100m x 40-80 m grid over 65 lines. The C horizon was assayed by auguring 
down to about 1 m. 

• Rock chips (306), which were taken in 27 small miner tunnels by chip channelling every 3 m. 

• Thirty trenches were dug with 3000 m of channel chip sampling. At Lam Asam South, trenching 
results included 9.5 m at 1.02 g/t Au and 22 m at 1.1 g/t Au. Anomalous gold values were 
picked up in soil geochemistry 1 km to the east, which appear to lie on the same structural 
trend as Lam Asam. 

• Ground Magnetics. 152 line km. was completed by McPhar Geoservices on a 50 m x 20 m grid, 
using a G-816 portable Geometrics proton magnetometer. 

• Four diamond drillholes (1640 m) numbered TDH 1- 4 were drilled for Chase Minerals 
Corporation by Asia Pacific Mineral Corp in the Lam Asam area. Hole TDH-1 ended in 
mineralisation (0.9 g/t Au) with the last 67.7 m averaging 0.5 g/t Au. The intercept was 
reported to be in hydrothermal breccia and tested the edge of highly silicified and brecciated 
dacite porphyry from which surface sampling had returned 50 m at 3.0 g/t Au. TDH-2 was 
drilled from the same collar position as hole 1 but tested below it. It located minor brecciation 
and below 100m depth a 50 m zone at 0.3 g/t Au was intersected, which appeared to correlate 
with the intersection in the first hole. The Author's interpretation, based on field observation 
and re-logging of core, suggests that the target zone dips away from the drill collar site and 
that hole 2 did not reach the target while hole 1 was stopped in mineralisation. TDH-3 drilled 
barren dacite porphyry. TDH-4 returned three zones of interest below a depth of 240 m, 14 m 
at 0.48 g/t Au, 3m at 0.19 g/t Au and 7 m at 0.34 g/t Au. 

• All samples from the Chase Minerals Corporation work were prepared at its base camp and 
then dispatched to McPhar in Manila for assay. The 2 kg soil samples were sieved –80 mesh, 
pan concentrates were wet sieved and 100g. of each were despatched to McPhar. Rock 
samples were crushed to – 2 mm with hammer and mortar and 250g riffle split. Core samples 
were cut by saw or hand split in non-mineralised zones and half sent for assay. Assays of core 
used a 50g fire assay for gold. For all other elements, including copper, lead and zinc, AAS 
methods were used. Other areas of anomalous gold were located. Breccias and abundant 
quartz veining were found at Kematu West, and at Kematu South, trenching across altered 
breccia returned gold grades up to 0.5 g/t Au.

Following on from the work completed by Chase Minerals Corporation, an Australian publicly listed 

company, Eastern Corporation Limited ("Eastern") obtained an interest in T'Boli after signing an 

agreement with T'Boli Gold Corporation in 1996 through its Philippine subsidiary Tibalina Pty. Ltd. to 

hold exclusive exploration rights to the Project. Tibalina Pty. Ltd. changed its name to Tibalina Limited 

on 7th April 2000 and then to Sabena Limited on 12th July 2000. 

Eastern completed a 7,057m diamond drilling program (23 holes) and mapped, surveyed and took 184 

adit samples.  Cooper (2002) summarised the exploration work completed by Eastern as follows: 

Eastern completed a phase of drilling of 23 diamond holes, for 7,050m using drilling contractor 
United Pacific Drilling (a drilling company with substantial experience in PNG, at Porgera and 
Lihir, and in the Philippines). Core size used in the programme was HQ, PQ and NQ size core 
all using triple tube core recovery system. Core recovery was excellent except for a few of the 
early holes. 

 
For surface drilling, PQ was used for the first 100 m, HQ to 250 m and NQ beyond that, 
underground holes were collared HQ and completed in NQ. 

 
The drilling was carried out using up to three drill rigs, these included one drill rig operating 
from underground sites in the Beehive Adit and two drill rigs from surface sites Most holes 
were drilled in two fans from the two underground drill sites in the Beehive adit, either sub-
horizontally or directed below the adit level. Because of the dip of the vein systems only a few 
holes have been drilled above the adit level from underground. The drilling pattern included 
fans of holes both laterally and vertically below the adit level, testing a 200 m strike length 
and approx 200 m vertical height of the south veins (Fig 10) and 60 m strike of the north veins. 
The drill density is irregular and there are blocks of potential mineralisation, which have not 
been evaluated, either by drilling or by the sampling of old workings. The drill results indicate 
that there is continuity of veins at widths and grades. 

 
A single shot Eastman camera was used for down hole surveys with survey measurements 
taken approximately every 30m down the holes. The Eastman camera was calibrated regularly 
on a surveyed testing bench. 

 
Some of the better drilling intersections from the drilling completed by Eastern (which also 
exist in the current T'Boli drill hole database) are given below. 

 

• TD022 4m at 5.3 g/t Au (including 1 m at 17.9 g/t Au) 

• TD018 8 m at 4.5 g/t Au (including 3 m at 10.5 g/t Au) 

• TD001 16 m at 2.4 g/t Au (including 2 m at 7.1 g/t Au) 

• TD008 12 m at 7.1 g/t Au (including 4 m at 18.7 g/t Au) 

• TD003 4 m at 13.4 g/t Au and 8 m at 15.2 g/t Au) 

• TD006 10 m at 3.6 g/t Au (including 5 m at 6.0 g/t Au) 

In December 2002, Sur American Gold Corporation ("Sur American") announced it had entered into 

an agreement with Eastern to earn up to 70% interest in Sabena Limited ("Sabena"), a subsidiary of 

Eastern.  Sabena at the time owned interests or had agreements in place to acquire interests in a 



Rizal Resources Corporation  T'Boli Gold-Silver Project 

20 | P a g e  
 

group of gold and copper-gold exploration projects on Mindanao Island in the Philippines.  The T'Boli 

Project was one of the Sabena projects.   

On February 15, 2004, the ownership structure with regard to the T'Boli Project which survives today 

under the ownership of Rizal was established.   This structure was first established under the name of 

Sur American Corporation, which changed its name to Cadan Resources Corporate on August 28, 2007 

and then changed its name again in October 2016 to Rizal Resources Corporation.  

Past exploration is referred to in this report as the broad exploration activities identified up to the 

point that the current ownership structure was established in February 2004.  Exploration activities 

completed by Rizal, under both the names of Sur American, Cadan and Rizal is covered in section 9 

through to section 12 of this report. 

6.2 Historical Mineral Resource Estimates 
As of the effective date of this Technical Report the T'Boli Project does not have a current Mineral 

Resource estimate.  However, over the course of the modern exploration activity at the Project one 

historical Mineral Resource estimate has been reported.   

The author cautions that a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the following 

historical estimates as a current Mineral Resource and the issuer is not treating the historical estimate 

as a current Mineral Resource. 

In October 1997, Ian Cooper reported for the first time a Mineral Resource estimate in accordance 

with the JORC Code in Australia on behalf of Eastern.  The Mineral Resource estimate reported by I. 

Cooper in 1997 defined an Inferred Mineral Resource of 2.4Mt @ 5.5g/t gold and 21g/t silver, for a 

total of 420,000ozs of gold and 1.6 million ounces of Silver. 

The historical Mineral Resource estimate is based on a subset of the information available today along 

with the understanding of the gold Mineralisation at the time.  Any future Mineral Resource estimate 

will utilise a larger dataset that is available over a broader area and is likely to include parameters that 

are based on a greater understanding of the distribution and continuity of the gold mineralisation at 

the T'Boli Project.  Therefore, the information leading to the reported historical Mineral Resource 

estimate is outdated and has limited relevance with regard to the current assessment of the T'Boli 

Project. 

The 1997 Mineral Resource Estimate utilised drill hole information that was completed at the time, 

which were TD001 to TD023.  In addition, they reportedly included a total of 467 adit samples that 

were also available at that time.  The 1997 Mineral Resource estimate used the following reported 

parameters to create the Mineral Resource Estimate: 

• Dilution was only applied to tunnel sampling. Here all samples were diluted to a 2.5m nominal 

vein width at zero grade for included wallrock. 

• Adit sample and drilling sample data were treated as two separate data sets. Data from adit 

sampling and from drilling were treated as separate data sets due to differences in sample 

density and other factors. 

• The assay data distribution has led to a high cut off of 30 g/t Au being applied to the raw drill 

data and 466.7 g/t Au to the adit sampling data. Cuts are made prior to normalising to 2.5m 

widths. This has eliminated the effect of a very small number of high grade assays on 



Rizal Resources Corporation  T'Boli Gold-Silver Project 

21 | P a g e  
 

calculations. Silver values were also included in the resource estimations for the adit sampling 

data with a cut off of 439.6 g/t Ag. 

• The numerous workings dug by small scale miners are to gain access to the richest portions of 

the veins, thus sampling is biased, being mainly confined to the high values, often on specific 

veins.  The drill data on the other hand is able to look at the broad stockwork mineralisation 

as well.  Where drilling and workings overlap the drilling has precedence in estimations. 

• For drilling, cut offs were at 0.5 g/t Au and 30 g/t Au. Silver grades were cut above 243.6 g/t. 

The top cut was based on log normal probability analysis which indicated a change of slope in 

the sample population. 

• Projections were 20 m up and down dip and along strike. 

• Once continuity of the envelope was established a second interpretation at a 1 g/t cutoff was 

made. 

• For adit sampling the corresponding cuts were 1 g/t Au and 466.72 g/t Au. Silver grades were 

cut above 439.6 g/t. Projections were made 20 m along strike, 20 m down dip, and up dip to 

the surface. Widths were taken out to a minimum of 2.5 m. 

• Exa-Min constructed a three dimensional model of the mineralisation based on interpretation 

by Eastern geologists and consultants. 

• Grade was estimated using an inverse squared method for the adit sampling. For the drill data 

set two methods were used for grade estimation. One based on a simple average of all assays 

within the solid, the second used a statistical program (Sichel's t-estimator). No volumes were 

removed to account for workings and stopes as this figure is thought to be less than 5% 

overall. 

The historical Mineral Resource estimate was reported in accordance with the JORC code as at 1997, 

as an Inferred Mineral Resource, which is equivalent to an Inferred Mineral Resource as defined in 

NI43-101.  

6.3 Mining Tenement History 
An Exploration Permit was granted to Tibalina Pty Ltd covering the existing MPSA on October 17, 1996. 

Subsequently Tibalina Pty Ltd relinquished the Exploration Permit and Tribal Mining Corporation 

("TMC") together with Holon Mining Corporation ("HMC") entered into an agreement with Kematu 

Gold Corporation ("KGC") to become exclusive operators over the area. KGC and HMC were 

collectively granted the APSA No. 049-XI and APSA No. 051-XI. 

On January 26, 1998, the Board of Directors and Stockholders of HMC transferred the mining rights 

for the APSA No. 051-XI to TMC. On November 20, 1997, the MPSA No. 090-97-XI was granted to TMC 

by then Department of Energy and Natural Resources ("DENR") Secretary Hon Victor O. Ramos. The 

MPSA is surrounded by the APSA No. 51-XI (Figure 3). 

TMC is the 100% owner of the MPSA No 090-97-XI and APSA No. 051-XI agreements.  The ownership 

structure and relationship between Rizal and TMC is identified in section 4.2.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 
The T'Boli Project is situated within a major northwest-trending mountain range called the Daguma 

Range (Figure 4).  The Daguma Range is on the South West corner of the Island of Mindanao, which is 

a magmatic arc trending parallel to its associated north east-verging subduction zone, defined by the 

Cotabato Trench.  The Cotabato Trench is situated 100km to the southwest of the Daguma Range, 

offshore in the Celebes Sea.  Partly on-lapping and bounding the Daguma Range to the northeast is a 

major sedimentary basin (back-arc basin) known as the Cotabato Basin. 

 

 

Figure 4: Regional Geological map of Mindanao showing the broad geological setting of the T'Boli 

Project (modified after Middleton et al.,2004).  Major influencing regional features on the geology at 

T'Boli include the Cotabato Trench situated 100km to the west off-shore, and a series of major strike-

slip faults, associated with the Cotabato Fault Zone, situated to the immediate West of the Daguma 

Range where T'Boli is located. 



Rizal Resources Corporation  T'Boli Gold-Silver Project 

23 | P a g e  
 

7.1.1 Structural Setting 
The most significant structural trend in the south western corner of Mindanao is dominated by a large 

transverse fault zone, called the Cotabato Fault Zone (Figure 4). This is a sinistral, strike-slip fault zone 

runs in a north-west orientation.  Further to the south-east there exist parallel faults which define the 

boundary between the Daguma Range and the Cotabato Basin.   

Further parallel faulting also exists within the Daguma range, where a series of associated east-west 

striking tensional faults have developed which link up with the north-west trending strike-slip faults.  

It is along the east-west trending tensional faults that vein type hydrothermal deposits have developed 

such as the T'Boli Gold-Silver system in the south-eastern edge of the Daguma Range (Figure 4). 

More locally at the T'Boli Project, the major controlling north-west striking faults are the Kematu and 

the Desawu faults (Figure 6).  The known gold silver mineralisation at T'Boli exists predominantly on 

east-west trending tension structures that exist between these two major controlling faults.  

 7.1.2 Stratigraphy 
The general region of the T'Boli area was mapped originally by the Bureau of Mines as part of a 

programme of regional geological mapping by Santos and Baptista (1963).  This work was followed up 

in more detail by Villamore and Muere in 1990 not long after the discovery of gold at T'Boli. 

The local stratigraphy, as defined by Santos and Baptista (1963) within the Daguma Range was formed 

as part of the Cretaceous to Tertiary Cotabato magmatic arc, in association with the Cotabato Trench.  

The geological formations originally mapped by Santos and Baptista (1963) in order of increasing age 

are listed in figure 5 (after Penna, 2008). 

The basement consists principally of volcanic flows and breccias with coarse volcaniclastic rocks that 

constitute the Kiamba Formation, which in places, lies unconformably over the Salbuyon Schists.  

During the Early Oligocene the basement rocks of the Kiamba Formation and Salbuyon Schists were 

intruded by a Hornblende rich porphyritic diorite called the Daguma Diorite.   

In the Late Oligocene to Miocene, clastic rocks and limestone, including Cablacan Formation were 

deposited, which is intercalated with andesite flows and breccias.  A further series of intrusive rocks 

formed in the Middle Miocene, defined by the Tual Quartz Diorite, which has been observed to intrude 

the Kiamba and Cablacan formations in the vicinity of Kiamba, where there exists a number of iron 

and copper prospects associated with the intrusion. A sequence of sedimentary rocks consisting of 

Tampanan Limestone, Siguil Formation and Allah Formation characterize the Middle to Late Miocene 

package that was laid over the older rock formations. 

7.2 Local Geology 
The rock units in the immediate T'Boli area are underlain by dacitic to andesitic, and some locally 

basaltic agglomerates, flows and tuffs, intruded by high level dacite porphyry rocks (Figure 6).  

Petrographic work conducted by the Philippine Mines and Geosciences Bureau in 2012 on samples 

submitted by Rizal defined the tuff as a dacite, lapili tuff and confirmed the composition of the dacite 

with approximately 5% quartz.

Figure 5: Summary Stratigraphy of the Daguma Range, after Penna 2008.   

The exploration effort by Rizal at T'Boli is currently focused on a structural corridor defined by the 

north-westerly trending Kematu and Desawu Faults (Figure 6).  The gold mineralisation exists 

predominantly within a series of east-west striking vein and breccia zones or structures which are 

interpreted to be linking tensional veins and structures between a series of north-westerly striking 

sinistral strike-slip faults.  The east-west tensional veins have a dominant southerly dip and appear to 

have developed in a localised extensional environment resulting in the steep southerly dipping normal 

faults, with occasional north dipping linking normal faults as the rocks have been pulled apart.

Figure 6: Local Geological map highlighting the area of focus at the T'Boli Gold-Silver Project, situated 

between the Kematu and Desawu Faults. 

The alteration of the host rocks, which is often mineralised, is observable for usually a few metres 

surrounding the more significant structures, or over a broader thickness where there is a cluster of 

proximal structures which appear to have provided a location for greater fluid flow resulting in a larger 

halo of alteration into the host rock.  When the mineralized structures come close together, there is 

often low-grade mineralization within the altered host rock between the structures.   



Rizal Resources Corporation  T'Boli Gold-Silver Project 

26 | P a g e  
 

There are two broad structural "Domains" which are known as the north veins, hosted in a Dacitic 

rock, and the south veins, which straddle a Dacite/Volcaniclastic boundary, but are predominantly 

hosted within a Volcaniclastic rock (Figure 7).  

Each domain has a set of structures/narrow veins which are predominantly striking in an east-west 

orientation and are dipping steeply to south, at between 60 degrees and 90 degrees. In some locations 

a complex series of veins have developed over an area covering a total of 30m in width.  Not all the 

vein structures contain high grade gold mineralization, and progress continues to be made with regard 

to understanding the controls on the higher-grade sections of the veins and structures that exist at 

the T'Boli Project. 

 

Figure 7: Plan projection of the mapped veins and structures from the exploration development at the 

550mRL level.  The two separate vein systems are highlighted with the referenced location of the 

vertical long sections for both the north veins (A-A') and south veins (B-B') as shown in figures 13 and 

14 respectively (see section 9.0). 

There are some observable faults that have developed in a north-western direction parallel to the 

regionally dominant east-west trending transverse faults.  These faults occasionally display narrow 

veining and gold mineralization.  Although some gold mineralization occurs on these faults, they are 

generally "tight" structures with only minimal narrow vein gold and surrounding alteration in the wall 

rock.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The author has observed that both the geological setting and alteration characteristics at T'Boli agree 

with the interpretation of previous authors who have studied and documented their findings on the 

Project.  The geological environment which has resulted in the mineralisation at the T'Boli Project is 

interpreted to be analogous to the types of deposits which are classified as a low-sulphidation 

epithermal deposit (Corbett, 2002; Figure 8). 

 

Figure 8: Schematic representation of the geological environment for the formation of intermediate to 

low sulphidation epithermal deposits (after Corbett, 2002). 

Evidence presented by previous authors to support this interpretation include the following: 

Pyper (2000) stated: "The mineralogy, based on field and petrological information, is skewed toward 

the silicasulphide and carbonate-base metal type. The highest gold grades are found associated with 

potassic feldspar, comb quartz and base metal sulphides, with the clay alteration and other features 

suggesting that the mineralization is of the classic quartz-adularia-sericite, boiling zone style found in 

high level epithermal system. It has similarities to other deposits, many of which, such as Porgera, are 

world class." 

Other carbonate base metal hot style systems of the SW Pacific include Acupan, Wau, Kelian, Mt. Kare 

and Gold Ridge (Cooper, 2002). 

Cooper (2002) also stated: T'Boli is an epithermal vein and stockwork system carrying gold and silver 

and is thought to be of the carbonate base metal hot spring style as defined by Leach and Corbett 

(1994).

An important interpretation of how the gold has formed within these deposit types, is that the gold 

has been carried within hot fluids from a magmatic source location up until the point (closer to the 

surface) where the environment is favourable for the gold to come out of solution and the gold can 

be deposited in concentrations high enough to form a Mineral Deposit.  This interpretation of the 

process for forming a gold deposit is shown in in figure 9 (after Jackson, 2017). 

 

Figure 9: Schematic representation of the boiling zones within a low sulphidation epithermal deposit 

of the type interpreted to be similar to how the gold-silver mineralisation formed at the T'Boli Project 

(after Jackson, 2017).  Note:  The use of the word "ore" in this figure is for representation purposes 

only and does not imply that a Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve exists at T'Boli. 

The best location for the deposition of gold is known as the boiling zone.  The depth of the boiling 

zone can change over time and creates a broad region where gold mineralisation exists within an 

epithermal deposit, however, research associated with this style of deposit indicates that the higher-

grade gold and silver mineralisation will occur over a depth range from 50m to 800m with an average 

of 300m. 

Gold may be deposited at higher levels for an extended depth range, however, typically the location 

where the highest gold mineralisation exists is often found to be constrained over a more limited 

depth range where the boiling zone is interpreted to have existed during the formation of an 

epithermal gold-silver deposit. 

Beneath the boiling zone, it is considered that the gold predominantly remained in solution and that 

very limited gold mineralisation will occur at depths beneath which the boiling zone has developed 

over the life of an epithermal gold deposit.

The more direct implications for this interpretation at the T'Boli project include the following: 

• The Volcaniclastic Rocks are considered to have been more permeable than the Dacite 

Porphyry host rock.  Therefore, the Volcaniclastic host rocks are likely to have had more gold 

bearing fluids pass through the rock to allow for the deposition of more gold in this rock type. 

• The position of the boiling zone is not yet understood at the T'Boli Project.  Therefore, several 

possibilities are considered to exist with regard to the depth extent of the gold mineralisation 

at T'Boli, such as: 

o Higher grade gold mineralisation may exist at depth up to the point where the boiling 

zone exists at this deposit.  This may still extend for many hundreds of metres beyond 

the currently identified position of the gold mineralisation. 

o There may be a position at depth beyond which the boiling zone no longer exists and 

the gold mineralisation no longer exists in high concentrations.  Obtaining evidence 

for high grade gold at depth would provide greater confidence that gold 

mineralisation at T'Boli exists at greater depths than has been currently defined. 

• The structures often locally control the locations where favourable sites have developed for 

the gold to be deposited.  Understanding the local structural environment and which 

structures were active during the time when gold mineralisation developed at T'Boli is another 

important aspect of understanding the size and continuity of the gold mineralisation at T'Boli. 

• Given that the gold mineralisation exists in associated with base metal sulphides and quartz 

veins and/or the introduction of silica as part of the alteration, there may be some relatively 

low-cost geophysical exploration methods that could define the position of the highest 

concentration of gold mineralisation very quickly (Hoschke, 2008), and should  be considered 

an important part of the exploration strategy at T'Boli and the surrounding region .

9.0 EXPLORATION 
Since Rizal (formally Sur American and Cadan) took over ownership and management of the T'Boli 

Project, exploration has been carried out over several stages mostly focussed on diamond drilling 

and/or underground exploration via sampling and mapping of a series of underground tunnels 

("exploration development").  Figure 10 shows the relative position and co-ordinates of all the drilling 

and underground development that has been completed up to the end of February 2018. 

 

Figure 10: Plan view of the recorded drill hole traces and underground development at the T'Boli 

Project.  Previous generations of exploration development are shown in blue (accessed from the 

Mafoko Decline), with the more recent exploration development shown in red (accessed from the new 

Minion Decline). 

9.1 Underground Exploration Development 
Earlier exploration from the underground workings first commenced by Rizal (when under the name 

of Cadan) in 2009.  The focus of this exploration effort was to expose the north and south vein sets in 

deeper underground levels for the purpose of channel sampling, bulk sampling and underground 

drilling.  The north and south veins were accessed from a small underground adit with approximate 

dimensions of 2.5m height and 2.5m width.  The exploration activities from this adit are known as the 

Mofoko workings.  Work in the Mofoko workings continued up until 2013, where limitations on cash 

resources forced the company to stop the underground exploration activities.

31 | P a g e  
 

In May 2016, Rizal commenced a further stage of exploration on the north veins from the 

underground development after a period of 6 months of rehabilitating and establishing a second 

decline access called the Minion Decline into the north veins. Late in 2017 Rizal also re-established 

access via the Mafoko tunnel with the primary purpose of providing a second form of egress, 

ventilation and dewatering of the mine. The Minion Decline commenced at 3.5m in width and 3.5m 

in height and was later expanded to a 4m x 4m decline. The exploration drives have been designed 

at 2.5m in width x 3.5m in height, with some sections of the exploration development drives 

expanded to greater widths to capture a larger zone of mineralization where required.  

Figure 10 shows the relative position, in plan view of the new underground development and the 

earlier Mofoko underground development. 

Total underground development at the T'Boli Project up to the end of February 2018 is summarised 

in Table 3.  The development in waste, which is required to provide access into the mineralised 

structure, is separated from the development on the mineralised structure, where new geological 

information and gold assay information can be obtained. 

Name Time Period Waste Mineralised Structure 

Mofoko Adit/Tunnel 2009 to 2013 1,023m 841m 

Minion Decline June 2016 to Feb 2018 2,132m 829.9m 

TOTAL  3,155m 1,670.9m 

 

Table 3:  Recorded breakdown of the underground development metres completed up to the end of 

February 2018. 

The key objective of the exploration development at the T'Boli Project is to explore at least 2 levels 

across two broadly defined vein sets called the north veins and the south veins.  The current level of 

geological information gathered to date from the underground exposures is greater in the north veins, 

as this location is easier to access and has been developed and explored over a much greater strike 

length than the south veins.   

At the end of 2017 a second level (between the 515mRL and the 525mRL) of exploration 

development drives had commenced on the north veins, with exploration development ongoing to 

the end of February 2018 at this level.  Access into the south veins is anticipated in the second quarter 

of calendar year 2018. 

9.2 Underground Sampling and Mapping 
Sampling and data capture has been relatively consistent over the various stages of exploration 

development at T'Boli.  Each underground exposure has had geological and sampling information 

captured initially on paper data sheets (Figure 11) known as "face sketches".  These face sketches and 

the associated sampling information has also been captured in 3D space in a 3D modeling package.

Figure 11: Typical face sketch which, in this particular case, has identified two structures dipping 

steeply to the South, separated by some altered and mineralized wall rock. 

In terms of assessing where a continuous section of high grade gold mineralization exists, each face 

sample was reviewed to identify the dominant mineralized structures.  The thickness and grade of the 

more continuous structures were then documented in summary form on level plans along with the 

interpreted position of the major structures mapped from the underground development (Figure 12).  

Broad zones of continuous average higher-grade mineralization could then be identified to reveal 

possible locations for future mining, as well as build an understanding of the controls of these larger 

mineralized zones.

Figure 12: Example of summarized face sampling information on the 550mRL level, highlighting the 

thickness and grade of the dominant structures that have been mapped from the underground 

development. 

The existing level development and face sampling results have shown that very high grades exist in 

small discrete locations (ie: Figure 12 - highlighted in orange), often where a footwall or hangingwall 

vein intersects the more dominant east-west tensional vein.  Understanding the location of these very 

high-grade positions appear to be a critical part of understanding the gold distribution at the T'Boli 

Project.   To fully understand the distribution of gold at the mine for the purpose of optimizing a future 

mine plan the Company plans to undertake trial mining in between the exploration development 

tunnels, which will create a 3D geological view of these intersection points and to test the vertical 

continuity of these very high-grade positions. 

The information gathered to date from all stages of underground exploration development at the 

T'Boli mine has been recently collated and summarized for both the north veins and the south veins.  

The information from each vein system has been projected onto a vertical long-section, along with 

any proximal historical drill hole information that exists beneath the current exploration development 

positions. 

There is virtually no information available above the existing level development which has, to a large 

extent, been mined out by small scale miners.  The Company has no intention to attempt to define or 

recover any gold above the existing exploration development due primarily to safety reasons and the 

general belief that the bulk of the high-grade gold above the existing development has already been 

taken.

At the north veins, the mineralization occurs as multiple zones over a 300m strike length.  

Development has also occurred in the hangingwall and footwall to the main structure, particularly 

where the sampling has indicated that high grade gold exists in these other structures.  In total, there 

has been over 700m of development around the 550mRL level over multiple stages to define 210m of 

high grade mineralization, which exists within a 300m strike length corridor (Figure 13).  In addition, 

development has commenced at the 525mRL level and also the 515mRL level with the development 

focused vertically beneath the higher-grade mineralization defined on the 550mRL level.   

 

Figure 13: Vertical long section (view looking to the North) representation of the main structure 

developed in the north veins.  The information obtained from the exploration development has been 

collated into geological domains that represent the higher-grade portions of the uncovered 

mineralized structures.  The results from each domain are represented on this long section in their 

respective position highlighting the total strike length, average thickness (in meters) and weighted 

average (uncut) gold grade (in grams per ton). 

At the 515mRL level, the exploration development has accessed a position where two structures exist 

close together.  Based on an interpretation that this larger mineralized position extends up to the 

550mRL level, the decision was made to commence trial bulk mining methods.  This trial mining is still 

at an early stage of assessment with mining and reconciliation work ongoing. 

It is still considered that many of the narrow, mineralized structures will be mined using narrow vein 

mining techniques. However, a more modern assessment of this approach remains to be tested.  To 

this end, the Company has identified 3 locations on the north vein that will soon be available for trial 

narrow vein mining.  Some further exploration development is required on the 525mRL level on the 

north vein to complete the access for 2 of these trial mining locations.

For the south veins the mineralization appears to exist in sections over a strike length of at least 350m, 

with the high-grade zones interpreted at this stage to cumulatively total a strike length of 

approximately 200m.  The development on the south veins is not as extensive as the exploration 

development on the north veins, however, there has been some smaller sections accessed over 

multiple stages, with multiple access points.  At this stage, the drilling information indicates that high 

grade gold mineralization still exists to the east beyond the current extent of the level development. 

Exploration development is planned to access the south veins close to the defined position of the 

historical drill hole, TG038 which has a reported drill intersection of 8m (true width) at an average 

grade of 14.2g/t. 

 

Figure 14: Vertical long section (View looking to the North) representation of the main structure 

developed in the south veins.  All historical drill hole intersections that exist within 150m depth of the 

of the previous development have been projected onto this long section, with the interval length 

adjusted for their estimated true width. The information obtained from the exploration development 

has been collated into geological domains that represent the higher-grade portions of the uncovered 

mineralized structures.   The results from each domain are represented on this long section in their 

respective position highlighting the total strike length, average thickness (in meters) and weighted 

average (uncut) gold grade (in grams per ton).

10.0 DRILLING 
Drilling conducted under the current ownership of Rizal (and its former names of Sur American and 

Cadan) has been broadly completed over two stages.  There is an additional earlier stage of drilling at 

the T'Boli Project, which is also included in the drilling database for the project and was completed by 

Eastern.  All three stages of drilling are documented in this section as they represent an important 

part of the project information. 

10.1 Drilling Programs 
The first phase of drilling in the immediate T'Boli region includes Drill Holes TD001 to TD023.  They 

were completed by Eastern Corporation Limited ("Eastern") in 1997, who engaged an independent 

diamond drilling contractor Asia Pacific Inc.  to undertake the drilling activities. 

After the change in ownership in 2004, a second phase of drilling was completed by Rizal in 2011 and 

2012. As part of this second stage of drilling Drill Holes TG024 & TG026 were drilled by another 

independent contractor, Drill Corp.  At the same time, Rizal made the decision to acquire and 

commence drilling activities in-house, with the purchase of 3 diamond drill rigs (Longyear 24, Longyear 

38 and a Kempi BQ drill rig).  Rizal continued drilling with its in-house drill rigs and crew to complete 

drill holes TG025 & 027 to TG069 up until December 2012. 

A third phase of drilling was undertaken at T'Boli by Rizal, again with the in-house drill rigs and crew, 

from mid-2013 up until early 2014.  This drilling program included the Drill Holes TG070 up to TG084. 

Table 5 below provides for a summary of each drilling program and the total metres drilled which exist 

in the current T'Boli database.  Table 6 identifies each drill hole with its collar position, its initial 

surveyed direction and the total length of the drill hole.

the T'Boli Project. 

There are 84 drill holes that currently exist in the drill hole database, some 60 of which have identified 

assay results exceeding 1g/t.  A detailed review of all the drill intersections from the database has 

identified 30 intersections that are of particular significance, based on having a gram*meter values 

(thickness x grade) of greater than 10.  The significant intersections summarized in table 7 below 

including their co-ordinates, estimated true thickness and their interpreted geological position 

identified.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

11.1 Diamond Drill Core Sampling 
Sampled drill cores from the historical drilling programs were HQ, NQ and BQ in size.   For drill core 

that was HQ or NQ size, selected sampling intervals were sub-sampled using different techniques 

depending on the nature of the drill core.  Competent drill core was cut longitudinally in half with a 

core saw; Clay dominant or soft core was divided into two halves using a spatula; Broken core or rubble 

was physically separated into 2 separate and equal halves.  For drill core that was BQ in size, the whole 

sample interval was taken for analysis.  Sample intervals taken were predominantly at 1m or less, with 

sample interval boundaries selected to ensure that the sampling interval did not cross over a defined 

geological contact.    

Each drill hole sample was placed into a calico bag, with a batch of drill core samples and 

corresponding tracking number per samples and transported to General Santos for sample 

preparation.  

11.2 Underground Rock Sampling 
Channel sampling undertaken within the exploration development drives have been consistently 

taken on a horizontal line between 1m to 1.5m above the floor of the development which is 

approximately perpendicular to the dominant dip of the mineralized structures.  The dominant 

geological domains and mineralized structures dip to the South at between 60 and 90 degrees.  Sample 

intervals vary from between 0.2m and 1.0m in width with the sample boundaries obeying the 

observed geological contacts. 

The channel samples are taken as rock chips evenly collected along a horizontal line, which is recorded 

on the face maps for each heading and linked to a sample number which is recorded on the sample 

bag (calico bag).  The combined samples for the underground development are collected and sent to 

the internal laboratory with an associated dispatch sheet and including at least one control sample 

per every 20 underground samples.    

11.3 Laboratory Analysis 
Holes TD001 to TD023 were analysed by McPhar Geoservices (Phil). Inc. ("McPhar"). McPhar was later 

purchased by Intertek Testing Services Phils. Inc and incorporated under the trading name Intetek-

McPhar ("Intertek"). 

Drill samples for holes TG024 to TG079 were delivered to the Intertek processing laboratory in General 

Santos by Rizal personnel. From the processing laboratory the pulps were couriered under Intertek 

control to their central analytical laboratory; Warehouse 7, Phicrest 1 Compound Km 23, West Service 

Road, Cupang, Muntinlupa 1772, Manila, Philippines. 

As the Company does not currently utilise the services of Intertek the author did not visit or observe 

the sample preparation, or the analysis undertaken by Intertek. 

Intertek is a recognized ISO approved laboratory.  The reported analytical method employed for gold 

by Intertek was FA50/AA, consisting of lead collection Fire Assay of a 50g aliquot with an Atomic 

Absorption Spectrometry ("AAS") finish for gold to a detection level of parts per million (ppm) gold 

(Au). 



Rizal Resources Corporation  T'Boli Gold-Silver Project 

45 | P a g e  
 

Drill samples for holes TG080 to TG084 in addition to all the underground samples have been analysed 

at the Company's internal laboratory. 

Rizal's internal laboratory is located at the Company's processing plant site, situated 6.4km from the 

mine site.  The author reviewed and observed the sample preparation and assay analysis at the 

Company's laboratory which is in line with their recorded procedures.  The analytical method 

employed for gold by Rizal's internal laboratory is straight fire assay of a 50g aliquot followed by acid 

digestion and weighing to a detection level of parts per million (ppm) gold (Au). 

Rizal's laboratory is not ISO certified.  The author reviewed the full process with regard to the sampling 

taken from the underground headings through to the final analysis at the laboratory.  Based on these 

observations, whilst there are some recommended improvements that could be made, there were no 

obvious issues identified which would place doubt on the validity of the results derived from 

Company's internal laboratory.  In addition, a review of the control standards from the combined 

database (the bulk of which is from underground samples analysed at the Company's internal 

laboratory) has not identified any gross errors or bias to warrant concern with regard to the results 

that exist within the Company's database (see section 11.4). 

11.4 Review of QA/QC Data 
For both the historical drilling and the current channel samples from the exploration development, 

the Company has maintained quality control systems which includes the insertion of blanks, standards 

and pulp duplicates.   

High level and low level commercial gold standards have been utilised as quality control standards at 

the T'Boli Project, which have the following specifications. 

ST462 had an average grade of 4.608g/t Au with a standard deviation of 0.204g/t Au. 

OxP50 had an average grade of 14.397g/t Au with a standard deviation of 0.307g/t Au.  

The historical control samples from the historical drilling information has been reviewed for any 

possible lab bias.  A review of the standard OxP50 has shown that there are not enough samples 

reported in the database to provide for a statistically meaningful assessment, or to identify any 

possible trend or bias.  Only the standard ST462 has been utilized more consistently for the drilling 

programs and underground sampling to provide for a meaningful assessment of any possible lab bias. 

At this stage, an analysis of the QA/QC data indicates that the there is a possible bias towards under 

calling the gold assay in the sampling data (Figure 15).   A proper reconciliation of the assay data 

against the gold produced should confirm this when this exercise is completed.

the acceptable range.  A greater bias appears to be below the acceptable range with an average of all 

the results at 4.53g/t. 

In addition, the repeat samples indicate that there is a significant nugget effect associated with this 

deposit, with substantial variations in the duplicate assay data (Figure 16).  This is most likely a result 

of extreme variability of the distribution of gold in the deposit rather than a problem with the assay 

sampling technique.  This issue will need to be addressed when completing a Mineral Resource 

estimate with some allowance made for this variability in the approach taken to create any future 

Mineral Resource estimate.  

Because of this variability, it will be important to ensure that isolated high-grade samples do not have 

a large area of influence, and it would also help to reduce this issue if there are multiple samples taken 

from the very high-grade sections of mineralization to achieve a more accurate average and 

representation of the actual volume of gold that is present in a defined area.

Figure 16:  Graph of the results from all duplicates in the database.  Substantial variations occur with 

the high-grade assay results.  The data from the standards and blanks indicate that this is not a result 

of variations in the laboratory and is more likely due to a moderate to high nugget effect that is a 

natural part of the deposit.  Over 40% of all duplicate samples have greater than a 50% variation in 

their results. 

Of note with regard to the quality control of the historical drill core samples is that for many of the 

sampling locations the core recovery was reported to be poor.  Based on the observations of the 

mineralized structures from the underground development this is interpreted to be a result of some 

clay rich sections that occur in close proximity to the mineralized structures.  The underground channel 

sampling has also identified that the clay rich locations often contain significant gold mineralization.  

The above observations indicate that the core loss recorded in the historical drilling is due to the poor 

capture of the mineralized clay rich material surrounding parts of the larger structures at T'Boli.  The 

loss of mineralized material may result in an underestimation of the gold content within some of the 

reported historical drilling intercepts. 

It is the authors view that the sample collection and sample preparation is appropriate and up to 

industry standards for the T'Boli Project.  It is considered that some improvements could be made to 

the regularity and review of the control standards as part of the analytical procedures.  However, 

based on a review of the control standards and processes observed at the laboratory, there does not 

appear to be any gross errors or lab bias present in the current database information.  It is advisable 

for an internal laboratory, as is utilized by Rizal at the T'Boli Project, that a process of obtaining ISO 

certification and follow up regular independent audits are completed and appropriately documented.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
The author has viewed the sampling and analytical practices undertaken by the Company at the T'Boli 

Project and completed a review of the control standards that are recorded in the Project database.  

This review included observations of the sampling process from the underground environment, 

through to the sampling preparation and assay methodology and then to the assay results being 

received and entered into the database.   As part of the validation of the current database, the author 

has randomly selected 6 drill holes and checked their original sample request sheets and subsequent 

laboratory report against what was reported in the database.  No discrepancy was observed as part 

of this review. 

The author has not completed any separate analytical test of the samples from the Project.  It is the 

view of the author, that whilst some additional processes can be undertaken to improve the QA/QC 

at the mine site (such as obtaining ISO certification), there are no observable gross errors or bias errors 

that would put into question the reliability of the assay results within Project Database. 

In addition to the review of the analytical results, the author has also observed the production of Gold 

from the Company's Processing Plant at T'Boli.  At this point in time, mixing of the underground 

material and lack of accurate tonnage estimates at the Processing Plant has made accurate 

reconciliation not possible.  However, given the general quantum of gold being produced from the 

exploration development it can be observed that there is unlikely to be any gross error in the 

laboratory analysis and sampling procedures. 

The Company was still working on various upgrades to the T'Boli Processing Plant at the time the site 

visit was undertaken by the author.  It is the understanding of the author that impending 

improvements to the processing plant will soon enable the Company to more appropriately reconcile 

gold grades in feed to the plant with gold grade estimates that have been derived from the 

underground sampling in the exploration development.   

 

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
The author has not sited any recorded metallurgical test-work or mineral processing reports for the 

T'Bold Project.  However, the Company has an existing processing facility which is situated 6.4km for 

the mine site and provides for an assessment of and recovery of the gold derived from the exploration 

activities at the mine. This facility consists of a conventional CIL gold plant with crushing, grinding and 

cyanidation followed by recovery of the gold to activated carbon. The carbon is stripped onsite, and 

the resulting product refined to gold (99.5%) and silver (99.5%) bars onsite. 

The gold typically occurs as both free gold, and gold associated with sulphide mineralisation 

(predominantly pyrite) and is free milling.  The processing plant appears to provide for gold recoveries, 

based on the available information to date, of over 90%.   

More details with regard to the existing processing plant at the T'Boli Project can be found in section 

24.

24.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
The Company has an existing processing plant at the T'Boli Property.  The author has conducted a site 

visit and overview of this processing facility which recovers gold and silver from the company's current 

exploration development activities. Observations of the steps for the recovery of gold and silver at the 

existing processing facility at the T'Boli Project are summarised below. 

Note that the T'Boli Project does not have a current Mineral Resource estimate or Mineral Reserves 

and that in the absence of a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical 

viability is associated with an increased risk of failure of the mining operation due to increased 

uncertainty of results.  Mining and processing activity at the T'Boli Project is ongoing on a small-scale 

basis associated with the Company's underground exploration activities and this should not be 

construed as Rizal having made a commercial production decision. 

• To handle the significant clay material found as part of the mineralised structures, a scrubber 

is required to wash the clays from the rock prior to the crushing circuit; in order for the clays 

not to blind the screen deck and crushers. 

• Following the scrubber, the rock is crushed in a two-stage crushing circuit consisting of jaw 

crusher followed by a rolls crusher; in closed circuit with a 12mm vibrating screen deck. 

Crushed rock is conveyed into a fine ore bin, from which the rock feeds to both of the ball 

mills. 

• The crushed rock is ground in two ball mills, to 80% passing 75 microns; then pumped to the 

CIL leaching circuit. This CIL circuit consists of a conventional cyanide leaching circuit with six 

tanks containing activated carbon for adsorption of the dissolved gold cyanide. 

• The slurry which is by now barren in gold, passes through a cyanide detoxification circuit; then 

is pumped to the tailings storage dam. 

• The final stage of gold recovery consists of two elution columns and two electrowinning cells, 

where gold is electrowon onto steel wool prior to refining into gold and silver ingots. 

The processing facility has recently been upgraded to a nameplate capacity of 200tpd, up to 250tpd 

potentially achievable.  This facility serves to test and reconcile the material mined from the 

exploration development and trial mining activities and to generate revenue from small scale 

production.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The current mine workings and focus of the work effort at the mine site represents an important, but 

relatively small proportion of the much larger system that is interpreted to exist at the T'Boli Property.  

The current exploration effort, at the established underground workings, has the potential to explore 

up to 700m of strike length on two broad structures (known as the north veins and south veins).  

However, the broader region appears to offer considerable potential over 2km of strike length 

(between the Kematu and Desawu faults), and possibly on a larger number of east-west structural 

trends or zones.  

The understanding of the mineralisation and distribution of gold at the T'Boli Project to date show 

similar characteristics to many of the other large epithermal systems that exist in the Asia Pacific 

region, some of which are multi-million-ounce gold deposits.  Based on the size of the broader target 

area, the multiple surface gold workings throughout this region and the current understanding of the 

limited underground exposures it is possible that largest part of this system is yet to be discovered, 

and that the project on a broad scale still offers multimillion ounce potential.  

This larger potential has long been recognised by earlier explorers, however, there has been limited 

detail or confidence with regard to understanding the controls, orientation and continuity of the high-

grade gold mineralisation in the region.  It has been for this reason that at multiple stages, the decision 

has been made to obtain a better understanding of the gold mineralisation at T'Boli by exposing the 

mineralised structures via underground tunnelling (exploration development). 

The current decision to define the gold mineralisation via underground development and to use the 

existing processing plant to process the material and recover gold from this development is still a 

logical way forward.  Given the ability to access the relatively shallow positions of the known 

mineralised structures, the Company can continue to build on the understanding of the gold 

mineralisation for future exploration and to use this information to support any new Mineral Resource 

estimates which can provide a reasonable basis for a future Mine Plan. 

This detailed work and understanding of the gold mineralisation at the T'Boli Project is ideally 

supported by an additional exploration program which will focus on the discovery and definition of 

the gold mineralisation throughout the broader region.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
There are a few recommendations that can be made to address two main aspects of the T'Boli 

Property. 

26.1 Exploration of the Regional Potential 
Whilst there exists large scale gold potential at the Property, the ability to focus any exploration effort 

into the best location and the ability to interpret effectively any drilling results has been difficult.  

There have been significant improvements in the understanding of epithermal gold deposits and some 

proven examples of utilising various geophysical methods to assist with the discovery of gold 

mineralisation in gold systems like T'Boli.  It is recommended that as an initial program, a detailed 

magnetic survey combined with an Induced Polarisation ("IP") survey which can measure the 

resistivity and chargeability of the rocks be completed.  The presence of significant sulphides and silica 

both in the structure and as part of the alteration surrounding the gold mineralisation implies that this 

type of survey may assist with identifying where the largest part of the gold system at T'Boli exists.   

A magnetic survey has been completed earlier, which was of a poor resolution, and so it is 

recommended that a new magnetic survey be completed to hopefully provide better resolution on 

the potential location of the structures at the T'Boli Project which will also assist to interpret the 

results from the IP survey. 

It is estimated that a reasonable budget to complete an IP survey and detailed magnetic survey 

including the required processing and interpretation would be in the order of C$150,000 to C$200,000 

(Phase 1 exploration). 

The costs of any follow-up drill testing of potential defined targets from this work would most likely 

include a combination of underground drill testing and surface drill testing.  The local topography and 

environment may restrict some surface locations with regard to any targets that are defined away 

from the mine site area.  Assuming a number of drill holes are required to test regional targets from 

surface then a total budget would most likely be in the range of C$1.5 million to C$2.0 million (Phase 

2 surface).  More detail on the depth and location of any potential target is required to effectively 

define the anticipated costs of any surface drilling program. 

Drill testing of targets within 500m of the mine site area could be attempted from the underground 

workings.  There would be a requirement to establish a new drilling position, most likely situated in 

the order of 100m south of the proposed workings at the south veins.  The drill testing could then be 

achieved with a number of drill holes, with the depth dependant on the defined location of the targets. 

In summary, it is anticipated that the combined underground development costs and underground 

drilling costs would be between C$600,000 and C$800,000 (Phase 2 Underground).  The costs 

associated with any further drill testing and definition of any successful drilling results is beyond the 

scope of what could be estimated at this stage.  The recommended exploration activities and 

associated estimated expenses are shown in table 8 below.

TOTAL  C$2.2 million to C$2.95 million 

Table 8:  Summary estimate of exploration expenses for proposed regional exploration program. 

26.2 Detailed research at the mine site 
It is important to bring in specialised expertise from time to time to ensure that the large expense 

associated with developing and exposing the mineralised structures is maximised and the information 

gained can also deliver a more reliable interpretation of the gold mineralisation at T'Boli.  Of particular 

importance is the detailed measurements and orientations of the structures and their intersection 

points.  It is considered that this information will provide a more reliable interpretation of the 

orientation and continuity of the high-grade gold zones.  Some additional expertise required includes 

experienced epithermal gold geologists with particular understanding of the alteration systems and 

their likely assessment of the gold distribution. 

The author has managed a number of projects similar to the T'Boli Project at the early stages where 

detailed research has played an invaluable role with regard to appropriately recording the information 

required to build a reliable Mineral Resource estimate.  It is anticipated that with the right expertise 

brought in to view the underground mine exposures at an optimal time further light will be shed on 

the key locations for the very high-grade gold (where assays can exceed over 100g/t), which are likely 

to be significant to any future mining study at the T'Boli Project.
