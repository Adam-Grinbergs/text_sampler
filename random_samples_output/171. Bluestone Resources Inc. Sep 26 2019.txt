1 Executive Summary 

1.1 Introduction 

This report summarizes the results of the Feasibility Study (FS) completed by JDS Energy & Mining Inc. 

(JDS) as commissioned by Bluestone Resources Inc. (Bluestone or the 'Company') for the Cerro Blanco 

Project (the Project) and was prepared in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' National 

Instrument 43-101 and Form 43-101F1, collectively referred to as National Instrument (NI) 43-101. This 

report was prepared with the assistance of Kirkham Geosystems Ltd. (KGL) and Stantec Consulting Inc. 

(Stantec). 

The Cerro Blanco Project is a precious metals resource project located in the Jutiapa department of 

Guatemala. Based on Proven and Probable Reserves, a subset of the Measured and Indicated Resource 

category, the Project will develop a mineralized system with 58 currently defined veins over an 8-year 

production period by way of a ramp access underground mine, a cyanidation gold extraction processing 

facility capable of processing ore at an average rate of 1,250 tonnes per day (tpd), a cyanide destruction 

circuit, a drystack tailings facility (DSTF) for storing filtered tailings, a water treatment plant and related 

infrastructure. 

1.2 Project Description 

The FS Concept is summarized below: 

 Mining:   1,250 tpd UG longhole and cut-and-fill 

 Processing:  Crushing-Grinding-Cyanidation-Refining 

 LOM Mill Feed:  3.4 Mt @ 8.5 g/t Au, 32.2 g/t Ag 

 Plant Recovery:  96% Au, 85% Ag 

 Average Payable Gold: 112,000 oz/yr 

 Mine Life:  8 years 

The Cerro Blanco Project is a gold development project that, since 2006, has had over US$170 M in 

investment including the construction of: 

 Two underground (UG) declines from surface 

 3.2 km of lateral underground development 

 Four ventilation raises 

 17 dewatering wells, and 

 Significant surface infrastructure including workshops, warehouse, office and water treatment plant 

(WTP). 

The mine is designed to a depth of approximately 385 m below surface, or 185 m above mean sea level 

(masl). The mine experiences hot water inflow that must be controlled to mitigate impact on mining

production. In addition to the existing surface dewatering wells and planned pumping from the underground 

mine (up to 1,200 US gallons per minute (gpm)), a series of new, deep dewatering wells will be staged over 

the life of mine to limit the water inflows underground. A portion of the combined dewatering total from 

underground sumps and dewatering wells (up to 1,500 gpm) will be cooled, treated, and discharged under 

existing permit allowances, and the balance (up to 5,400 gpm) will be disposed of through a series of new 

injection wells. 

The processing plant will utilize crushing, grinding, cyanidation leaching and refining processes to recover 

gold (Au) and silver (Ag). Approximately 112,000 oz of gold will be recovered annually, on average, with 

higher value zones being mined early in the Project life. The mine life will be eight years based on current 

defined Mineral Reserves.  

Tailings will be filtered and deposited in an engineered drystack tailings facility (DSTF). A portion of the 

tailings will be deposited back underground as paste backfill, and all waste rock will be deposited 

underground as either cemented rock fill (CRF) or loose rock fill (LRF). 

The site is currently accessible with an all-weather gravel road and has 4 MW of diesel-generated power 

on-site. A new 5 km long access road and 8.2 km long power transmission line will be installed prior to 

start-up. 

The Project already has an approved Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and is fully permitted as an 

underground mine. Amendments to the EIA and some of the existing permits are required for FS design 

optimizations. New EIAs and permits are required for the new access road and power line. 

1.3 Property Description 

The Project is located in southeast Guatemala approximately 160 km by road from the capital, Guatemala 

City. It is located in the municipality of Asunción Mita in the Department of Jutiapa, approximately 9 km 

west of the border with El Salvador. The nearest town to the Project is Asunción Mita, a community of about 

17,500 people, approximately 5 km from the Project. The Project covers a concession encompassing 15.25 

km2 and lies entirely in the municipality of Asunción Mita, in the Jutiapa District. Figure 1-1 provides an 

overview of the property location within Guatemala.

A total of 577 holes were included in the block model inclusive of Bluestones' recent drilling. This drilling 

database contains 85,306 unique assay intervals representing a total core length of 128,411 m.  

1.6 Geology and Mineralization 

The Cerro Blanco district consists of localized precious metal veins and small stockwork deposits which 

occur over an area of more than 30 km2. The Cerro Blanco gold deposit occurs within a large hydrothermal 

alteration zone covering an area approximately 5 km long and 1 km wide characterized by pervasive 

hydrothermal alteration associated with a hot springs-type epithermal system. 

Gold mineralization at Cerro Blanco is hosted within a broadly north-south striking sequence of westerly-

dipping siltstones, sandstones, and limestones (Mita Group) that are capped by silicified conglomerates 

and sediments with contemporaneous dacite / rhyolite flow domes or cryptodomes (Salinas Group). The 

Salinas rocks are syn-mineral and believed to have accumulated progressively in a low-relief graben 

characterized by a shallow groundwater table.  

The Salinas Group includes thin hot spring deposits, including sinters, which are genetically linked to 

underlying swarms of epithermal, gold-bearing quartz veins. The west and east sides of the Cerro Blanco 

ridge consist of flat agricultural plains characterized by Quaternary basalts, interbedded with boulder beds 

and sands. These rocks also appear down-faulted to lower elevations, implying major post-mineral 

extensional movements on such faults; and, they may be neotectonic (active). 

The current gold resource occurs under a small hill and is confined within an area about 400 m by 800 m, 

and is characterized by both high angle and low angle banded chalcedony veins, locally with calcite 

replacement textures. Moderate to high angle mineralized faults and stockwork zones host some of the 

highest gold grades. Gold bearing structures in the Cerro Blanco Project area extend 2 km to the northwest 

of the gold deposit and occur largely confined within the hydrothermal alteration zone.

1.7 Metallurgical Testing and Mineral Processing 

Metallurgical test work was conducted on samples from the Cerro Blanco deposit between April 1999 and 

January 2012 by Kappes, Cassiday & Associates (KCA). The most recent test program, completed in 2018 

in support of this FS, was carried out at Base Metallurgical Laboratories Ltd. (BaseMet) in Kamloops, BC. 

The focus of the recent test program was to optimize the flowsheet and generate tailings for geochemistry, 

geotechnical and paste backfill testing. A global composite from drill core was created to run the 

optimization test program. The test work included grind extraction optimization, gravity, leach optimization, 

tailings generation and cyanide destruction. Bulk samples from the underground workings were collected 

and two composites were created to represent the North and South areas of the deposit. The final flowsheet 

and test parameters determined in the optimization phase were used to generate tailings samples from the 

North and South zones for physical and chemical characterization to be used in defining DSTF and backfill 

applications. 

Based on the results from BaseMet (2018), gold and silver doré can be produced with a primary grind size 

of 80% passing (P80) 53 µm followed by gravity concentration, 2-hour pre-oxidation, a 48 hour cyanide leach 

at a cyanide concentration of 500 ppm, 6 hour carbon-in-pulp (CIP) adsorption, desorption and refining 

process. For the global composite, this recovery method achieved average precious metal recoveries of 

96% Au and 85% Ag.  

1.8 Mineral Resource Estimate 

This resource is based on a Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource estimate undertaken by 

Garth Kirkham, P. Geo., of Kirkham Geosystems Ltd., a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101 and 

independent of the Company. 

The Cerro Blanco deposit comprises over 50 individual veins distributed within two principal swarms that 

extend over a strike length of 800 m. Over 90 percent of the current resource is distributed within 30 veins. 

Individual veins extend to depths greater than 450 m with variable dips averaging between 40 - 60 degrees. 

Principle feeder veins form the footwall of the deposit and trend broadly north-north easterly, with the more 

dominant north-easterly vein sets appearing to converge downwards into the master veins. 

The updated Mineral Resource Estimate incorporates more than 571 drill holes and 288 underground 

channel samples totaling 126,434 m. There is more than 1.2 Moz of gold and 4.53 Moz of silver contained 

in the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. The Project also contains more than 0.36 Moz of gold 

and 1.04 Moz of silver in the Inferred Mineral Resource category. The Mineral Resource Estimate for the 

Cerro Blanco deposit is reported at a base case above a 3.5 g/t Au cut-off, as tabulated below in Table 1-

2.

Notes: 

1. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resources. 

2. Effective date: September 10, 2018. All Mineral Resources have been estimated in accordance with Canadian Institute of Mining 
and Metallurgy and Petroleum ("CIM") definitions, as required under NI 43-101. 

3. Mineral resources reported demonstrate reasonable prospect of eventual economic extraction, as required under NI 43-101. 
Mineral resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

4. Underground Mineral Resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 3.5 g/t Au. Cut-off grades are based on a price of US$1,250/oz 
gold, US$16/oz silver and a number of operating cost and recovery assumptions, including a reasonable contingency factor. 

5. Numbers are rounded. 

6. The Mineral Resources may be affected by subsequent assessment of mining, environmental, processing, permitting, taxation, 
socio-economic and other factors.  

1.8.1 Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology 

The Mineral Resource estimate reported herein was prepared by Garth Kirkham, P.Geo., FGC of Kirkham 

Geosystems Ltd. of Burnaby, BC, Canada, an Independent Qualified Person under Canadian Securities 

Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"). The Mineral Resources presented herein have 

been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral 

Reserves Best Practices" guidelines and are reported in accordance with NI 43-101. There are 75,667 gold 

assays or 112,112 m total which average 0.57 g/t and 109,014 silver assays or 109,014 m total which 

average 3.66 g/t. It is interesting to note that the maximum gold assay is 434.8 g/t while the maximum silver 

assay is 8,656.7 g/t. Specific gravities were assigned to individual rock types and assigned on a block by 

block basis using measurement data by lithology. 

The estimate was completed using MineSightTM software using a three-dimensional block model (5 m by 5 

m by 1 m and using a sub-block size of 1 m by 1 m by 0.1 m sub-blocks). The Cerro Blanco model is 

comprised of 57 interpreted three-dimensional wireframes which were the primary estimation domain; and 

hard boundaries were used to constrain the interpolation of grades into the block model. Interpolation 

parameters have been derived based on geostatistical analysis conducted on 1.5 m composited drill hole. 

Block grades have been estimated using Ordinary Kriging ("OK") methodology and the Mineral Resources 

have been classified based on proximity to sample data and the continuity of mineralization in accordance 

with CIM Definition Standards and Estimation Best Practices.  

1.9 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

The effective date for the Mineral Reserve estimate contained in this report is January 29, 2019 and was 

prepared by JDS. All Mineral Reserves in Table 1-3 are Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. The 

Mineral Reserves are not in addition to the Mineral Resources but are a subset thereof.

Notes: 

1. The Qualified Person for the Mineral Reserve estimate is Michael Makarenko, P. Eng., of JDS Energy & Mining Inc. 
2. Effective date: January 29, 2019. All Mineral Reserves have been estimated in accordance with Canadian Institute of Mining and 

Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) definitions, as required under NI 43-101. 

3. Mineral Reserves were estimated using a $1,250 /oz gold price and gold cut-off grade of 3.5 g/t. Other costs and factors used 
for gold cut-off grade determination were mining, process and other costs of $109.04/t, transport and treatment charges of $5.00 
/oz Au, a royalty of $24.84 /oz Au and a gold metallurgical recovery of 95%. 

4. Silver was not used in the estimation of cut-off grades but is recovered and contributes to the revenue stream in the model. 

5. Tonnages are rounded to the nearest 1,000 t, gold grades are rounded to two decimal places, and silver grades are rounded to 
one decimal place. Tonnage and grade measurements are in metric units; contained gold and silver are reported as thousands 
of troy ounces. 

6. Rounding as required by reporting guidelines may result in summation differences. 

1.10 Mining 

Cerro Blanco is proposed to be mined as an underground operation using a combination of longhole stoping 

(LH) and mechanized cut and fill (MCF) mining methods with cemented paste and rock backfill. A target 

production rate of 1,250 tpd is envisioned over a mine life of eight years that will extract 3.4 Mt of ore. LH 

stoping will account for about 54% of total production, and the remaining 46% will come from MCF and 

development. The Cerro Blanco deposit will be accessed from surface via a series of ramps, and all ore 

and waste rock will be trucked out of the mine. In addition to the four existing ventilation raises, two new 

raises will be required to circulate the required amount of air through the underground workings. 

Dewatering, ventilation, and cooling are important mine design aspects at Cerro Blanco. The water levels 

in the immediate mine area will be lowered by a series of existing and new surface dewatering wells. Any 

remaining water underground will be captured and pumped to surface through collection at underground 

sumps. For ventilation, the quantity of air required has been designed to dilute diesel particulate matter, 

reduce the air temperature from exposed rock and maintain worker comfort. Mine air refrigeration will be 

used to maintain air temperatures in working areas below 28°C wet bulb. 

Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources were included in the mine design and schedule optimization 

process. Where Inferred resources cannot be avoided, they are treated as waste material with zero metal 

grade. Less than 1% of inferred resources are included in the mine reserves. 

The mine production schedule is shown in Table 1-4.

1.11 Recovery Methods 

The processing plant will have a capacity of 1,250 tpd. The plant will consist of the following unit operations: 

 Three stage crushing, 

 1,250 tonne fine ore storage bin and reclaim system, 

 Primary and secondary grinding, 

 Gravity separation and intensive leach, 

 Pre-leach thickening to 50% solids, 

 2-hour pre-oxidation, 48 hour leaching and 6 hour Carbon-in-Pulp (CIP), 

 4 tonne carbon plant and gold recovery, 

 Cyanide destruction, and 

 Tailings thickening, filtration and disposal in the DSTF or underground as paste backfill. 

The leach circuit will have a retention time of 48 hours, and sodium cyanide (NaCN) consumption is 

expected to be in the range of 0.3 kg/t to 0.5 kg/t to maintain a cyanide concentration of 500 ppm. Cyanide 

will be destroyed using the SO2/Air process. The slurry will be agitated in one of two tanks (with one tank 

acting as a standby) for 1 hour using copper sulphate (CuSO4) as a catalyst, maintaining a 25 mg/L 

concentration in solution and sodium metabisulphite (SMBS) solution will be dosed into the system as the 

source of SO2.

The grinding circuit product size is targeted at approximately P80 of 50 µm. The crushing circuit will operate 

at an availability of 65% while the milling, leaching and gold recovery circuits will operate 24 hours per day, 

365 d/y at an availability of 92% processing 1,250 tpd. 

1.12 Dewatering 

Dewatering of the mine will be through a combination of underground dewatering from sumps and 

dewatering at the surface from deep dewatering wells. Certain areas at the Cerro Blanco deposit have high 

temperature groundwater, hindering previous dewatering efforts for depressing the groundwater levels to 

depths required for safe access to ore reserves. An important finding during the FS was that dewatering 

cannot be approached using standard underground mine dewatering techniques. Instead, practices for 

groundwater extraction from the geothermal industry will be implemented to limit steam flashing in the 

dewatering wells outside the developed mine workings. Dewatering from wells will require constant 

backpressure to be applied to the wellhead and pump column to maintain water in a single liquid phase. 

This will require dewatering wells to be installed deeper than the planned mine depth to maintain hydraulic 

head at sufficient levels above the pump intake.  

To demonstrate these methods in practice, field flow tests were conducted at two existing dewatering wells 

with the hottest groundwater temperatures at the mine. This field testing demonstrated that long-term, single 

phase pumping rates can be maintained with higher backpressures. Injection tests also proved successful 

at an existing deep well located in the Mita Geothermal field, adjacent to the mine. Injection test results 

indicate deep injection is a feasible disposal method for mine water. The injection test rates ranged up to 

800 US gallons per minute (gpm) and averaged just over 500 gpm at sustained pressures. 

A numerical groundwater flow model was developed to predict necessary dewatering rates to accommodate 

the mine plan and associated target mining depths. The calibrated model indicates that eight new deep 

dewatering wells (phased over the mine life) capable of producing a cumulative extraction rate of 4,800 

gpm, along with an additional 750 gpm of extraction from five existing mine dewatering wells, will be 

required to achieve dewatering targets. Underground dewatering from sump pumps and conveyance ramps 

will provide approximately 1,200 gpm of additional dewatering from inside the mine, bringing total 

dewatering rates from wells and underground sumps to a peak of 6,750 gpm in later stages of the mine life. 

The peak projected dewatering rates, as calculated from the numerical groundwater flow model, reached 

approximately 6,150 gpm. Therefore, the proposed infrastructure exceeds the projected dewatering needs. 

Extracted water will be delivered to the existing WTP, or to future deep injection wells, for disposal. The 

WTP has a capacity of 1,500 gpm and is currently in operation. It is anticipated that the deep injection wells 

(planned for depths of 800 m) will have a capacity of 600 gpm each, or greater. A total of nine injection 

wells are planned to be phased in over the mine life in order to manage discharge volumes above the WTP 

capacity. 

1.13 Infrastructure 

The Feasibility Study (FS) plans on the installation of the following key infrastructure elements to support 

the mine and process facilities: 

 A new 5 km long access road that will connect the Cerro Blanco project to the Pan-American 

Highway (CA1). A new bridge will be installed over the river Rio Grande de Mita.  



 

 

CERRO BLANCO PROJECT 
FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 1-10 

 

 An 8.2 km 69 kV overhead power line and on-site substation 

 Eight new dewatering wells and nine new reinjection wells for mine water management 

 Surface water management diversions, a levee, and ponds 

 Drystack Tailings Facility (DSTF) 

 Security controlled site access with employee and visitor parking 

 Emergency generator power supply 

 Process plant office and personnel facilities 

 Reagent warehouse with concrete containment storage area 

 New process and fresh / fire water tank 

 Mine support facilities, including a truck shop, new office, mine dry and additional septic system 

bio-digester, and 

 Upgrades to the North and South portal haul roads. 

The site is already well established, with existing infrastructure that will continue to support the mine 

throughout the operations period. These include the following: 

 Water treatment plant (WTP) 

 Shop and maintenance facilities to support WTP and site surface infrastructure 

 Office facility 

 Personnel showers, change rooms, and locker facility 

 Metallurgical laboratory and core handling / logging facility 

 Dewatering wells and infrastructure 

 Medical Clinic, and 

 Existing on-site access roads. 

With respect to domestic / sanitary wastewaters, the mine site is already equipped with a biological 

wastewater treatment unit and septic field, which will be expanded with the addition of a new mine office 

and mine dry facility. 

Some of the existing infrastructure will be upgraded or re-purposed to optimize operations and economics 

of the Project. 

There will be a temporary Waste Rock Facility (WRF) that will be started in the pre-production stage of the 

project. All of the waste rock will be utilized as cemented rock fill (CRF) or loose rock fill (LRF) over the 

course of the mine life.  

A feasibility level design for a filtered Drystack Tailings Facility (DSTF) was completed. The facility is to be 

located south of the process plant and was designed for surface storage of a portion of the tailings, using 

filtered (drystack) tailings placement techniques. The remainder of tailings will be used as paste backfill and

FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 1-11 

 

stored underground. Design features of the DSTF include foundation preparation, foundation groundwater 

drainage system, starter confining embankment with structural outer shell and a water management pond 

to collect runoff and seepage. Ditches will be constructed around the perimeter of the DSTF to divert the 

non-contact water from upper catchment areas and minimize the direct contact water catchment area. The 

facility will be shaped and capped at closure to prevent erosion of the tailings surface, while blending the 

structure into the surrounding topography. 

Surface water infrastructure was developed to do the following: minimize the amount of precipitation and 

runoff that comes into contact with potential contaminant sources during mine operations, collect and 

capture potentially contaminated water for mine reuse or water treatment prior to offsite discharge, or to 

prevent flood inundation from nearby rivers. Potential contaminant sources are areas where filtered tailings 

are stored. The water runoff from these areas is referred to as "contact" water. "Non-contact" water does 

not fall onto, or runoff, from these facilities.  

Potential contact water sources are the Drystack Tailings Facility and the process plant area where filtered 

tailings will be produced, placed, and loaded into trucks prior to being offloaded at the DSTF. Contact water 

will either reused in the process plant or is sent to the WTP. Storm water controls for separating contact 

and non-contact water were sized to route peak flows from the 100-year flood, generated by the 100-year, 

24-hour storm. Levees were sized and positioned to prevent flood inundation from Quebrada Tempisque, 

the nearby river, during the Probable Maximum Flood as based on two-dimensional hydraulic modeling 

results. 

A daily water balance model was developed to evaluate the use of water over the mine dewatering schedule 

and operations schedule, representing Year -1 to the end of Year 7, when maximum projected dewatering 

rates are reached. In the current mine water management plan, dewatered fluid is either sent to the WTP 

or is reinjected. Along with dewatering fluid, the WTP also receives process water and other sources for 

treatment; therefore, the full WTP capacity of 1,500 gpm is not fully available for disposal of mine dewatering 

fluid. The cumulative water balance results indicate that approximately 66% of the WTP capacity is available 

for dewatering fluid.  

Additionally, outflow from the WTP was simulated for use as process makeup water or as discharge to 

Quebrada Tempisque. The mine is permitted to discharge up to 1,500 gpm to Quebrada Tempisque. The 

results show that, cumulatively, the WTP discharges approximately 70% to Quebrada Tempisque, or at a 

rate of approximately 1,050 gpm, not the full 1500 gpm flow currently permitted. The WTP inflow and outflow 

results indicate that modifications to the WTP are possible to reduce demands on the reinjection system. 

The water balance results also indicate that monthly average injection rates are typically below the nominal 

injection capacity of 600 gpm per well, indicating that the planned installation schedule for injection wells is 

appropriate. There are some potential periods where daily simulated injection may exceed the nominal 

reinjection capacity. Potential management scenarios around such events include increased short-term 

injection rates (potentially up to 800 gpm), temporarily reduced dewatering rates, and improving the 

pumping strategy from contact water ponds. Ultimately, the water balance results show that the surface 

water management facilities and planned water balance operations are feasible for the assumptions and 

operating conditions evaluated.

1.14 Environment and Permitting 

The Project is permitted as an underground mine and Bluestone will continue to engage in social and 

environmental commitments inherited from previous ownership.  These responsibilities were previously 

managed by Goldcorp's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) division, who oversaw a comprehensive 

permits register and provided environmental and social management reporting, based on Goldcorp's 

Sustainability Excellence Management System. 

Since the acquisition, Bluestone has reviewed, and when necessary, completed and updated the 

environmental, social and permitting requirements to comply with current worldwide best practices and 

regulations. The organizational structure has been improved with the creation of new positions, including a 

Senior Manager Sustainability to lead and manage all Health, Safety, Environment and Corporate Social 

Responsibility activities, as well as a Communication Coordinator of internal and external communications. 

1.14.1 Environment and Permitting 

As part of the Feasibility Study (FS), a review of the environmental management and permitting 

requirements was conducted. This review included existing environmental studies and continuous 

monitoring activities performed since the start of the project. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 

was submitted and approved by the Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (MARN) in 2007. In 

addition, specific permits have been obtained and renewed since 2009, as required. The EIA and all permits 

remain current and valid. 

The environmental, social and permitting review conducted during the FS showed that specific components 

of the design have been optimized and/or changed since the EIA was originally completed and permits 

were issued (refer to section 20.2 for additional details). Therefore, a combination of permit and EIA 

amendments will be submitted to MARN for notification and/or approval, as required, to ensure permits 

reflect the current project configuration. In addition, new environmental studies will be required, specifically 

for the access road and power line, which are not covered by existing permits. EIAs for these components 

will also need to be submitted to MARN for approval. 

The approved EIA includes an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), a Social Management Plan (SMP) 

and a Conceptual Mine Closure Plan, which have been reviewed and updated during the FS to account for 

current international good-practices and the updated project design.  

1.14.2 Social Aspects and Stakeholder Engagement 

The approved EIA includes a SMP to guide social management activities and stakeholder engagements. 

A dedicated, onsite Community Relations team has managed the social aspects of the Project since 2007. 

Similar to the environmental activities, the social aspects were previously managed and maintained through 

a comprehensive community relationship register. 

During the FS, stakeholder engagements were reviewed and updated based on international good practices 

and the IFC Environmental and Social Performance Standards (2012). The SMP included in the EIA was 

based on the most recent official Guatemalan census. Bluestone carried out an update to the social 

baseline study during the FS to understand the local socioeconomic situation and to guide enhancements 

to the SMP.

Page 1-13 

 

Bluestone has also prepared a Stakeholder Engagement Plan and implemented a new Social Management 

System (SMS) to register and manage all the information gathered relating to community relations activities. 

1.14.3 Rehabilitation and Closure 

The approved EIA included a basic conceptual Mine Closure Plan. Under Guatemalan regulation, the Cerro 

Blanco Mine site Closure Plan will be presented to the authorities three years prior to the mine ceasing 

operation. Accordingly, Cerro Blanco is not yet required to submit a Closure Plan to the authorities. 

However, per good international practise, Bluestone has opted to update the Mine Closure Plan during the 

FS and associated closure costs have been included in the sustaining CAPEX. 

1.15 Operating and Capital Cost Estimates 

1.15.1 Capital Cost Estimate 

Life-of-mine (LOM) project capital costs are estimated to total $335 M, consisting of the following distinct 

phases: 

 Pre-production Capital Costs – includes all costs to develop the property to an average of 1,250 

tpd underground production rate. Initial capital costs total $195.7 M (including $23 M contingency), 

which will be expended over a 23 month pre-production design, construction and commissioning 

period. 

 Sustaining Capital Costs – includes all costs related to the acquisition, replacement, or major 

overhaul of assets during the mine life required to sustain operations. Sustaining capital costs are 

estimated to be $129.0 M and do not include contingency. Sustaining costs are expended in 

operating Years 1 through 8, and 

 Closure Costs – includes all costs related to the closure, reclamation, and ongoing monitoring of 

the mine, post operations. Closure costs total $10.6 M and do not include contingency.  Closure 

costs are primarily incurred in Year 9, with costs extending into Year 12 for ongoing monitoring.

1.15.2 Operating Cost Estimate 

Preparation of the OPEX is based on the JDS philosophy that emphasizes accuracy over contingency and 

utilizes defined and proven Project execution strategies. 

The operating cost estimate in this study includes the costs to mine, process the mineralized material to 

produce doré, site services and infrastructure, and general and administrative expenses (G&A). These 

items total the operating costs and are summarized in Table 1-6. 

The target accuracy of the operating cost is -10%/+15%. No allowance for inflation or contingency has been 

applied to operating costs. 

The operating cost estimate is broken into three major sections: 

 Underground Mining 

 Processing 

 Site Services (including costs associated with operation of dewatering wells), and 

 General and Administrative. 

The total operating unit cost is estimated to be $117.78/t processed. Average annual, total LOM and unit 

operating cost estimates are summarized in Table 1-6.

1.16 Economic Analysis 

An economic model was developed to estimate annual cash flows and sensitivities of the Cerro Blanco 

Project. All costs, metal prices, and economic results are reported in ($US) unless stated otherwise. 

Pre-tax estimates of Project values were prepared for comparative purposes, while after-tax estimates were 

developed to approximate the true investment value. It must be noted, however, that tax estimates involve 

many complex variables that can only be accurately calculated during operations and, as such, the after-

tax results are only approximations.  

This Technical Report contains forward-looking information regarding projected mine production rates, 

construction schedules, and forecasts of resulting cash flows as part of this study. The mill head grades 

are based on sampling that is reasonably expected to be representative of the realized grades from actual 

mining operations. Factors such as the ability to obtain permits to construct and operate a mine, to obtain 

major equipment or skilled labour on a timely basis, or to achieve the assumed mine production rates at 

the assumed grades may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in this economic 

analysis. 

The reader is cautioned that the gold prices and exchange rates used in this study are only 

estimates based on recent historical performance and there is absolutely no guarantee that they 

will be realized if the Project is taken into production. The price of gold is based on many complex 

factors and there are no reliable methods of predicting the long-term gold price. 

Table 1-8 outlines the LOM summary and the basis for the economic analysis while Table 1-9 1-9 highlights 

the economic assumptions.

1.16.2 Sensitivities 

A simple sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which factors most affect the Project economics 

and is discussed in Section 23. Each variable evaluated was tested using the same sensitivity values, 

although some may be more likely to experience significantly more fluctuation in value over the LOM (i.e. 

CAPEX versus metal prices). The confidence attributed to each variable in this study does not factor into 

the sensitivity analysis, the inter-correlation between certain variables, and for this reason is considered a 

simplistic approach to determine which variable would most affect the economic results of the Project. 

Sensitivity analyses were performed on metal prices, mill head grade, CAPEX, and OPEX as variables. 

The value of each variable was changed plus and minus 25% independently while all other variables were 

held constant. The Project shows the most sensitivity to metal price and head grades. The results of the 

sensitivity analyses are shown in Table 1-12.

1.17 Project Development 

The overall construction and commissioning period for the Project is estimated to be approximately 19 

months from start of site development to first gold pour. Year -2 activities will include EIA / permit 

amendments, access road and powerline permitting and construction, geotechnical site investigation, 

metallurgical testwork, detail engineering, and site development earthworks. All other work will take place 

in Year -1. For additional details, refer to the summarized development schedule shown in Figure 1-2.

During Year -2, the underground mine design will be completed, and underground development will 

commence in Year -1. The construction of new dewatering and injection wells to support the mining 

schedule will be staged, as follows: 

 Year -1: one dewatering well, one injection well 

 Year 1: two dewatering wells, four injection wells 

 Year 2 and 3: no new wells 

 Year 4: one dewatering well, one injection well 

 Year 5: three dewatering wells, two injection wells, and 

 Year 6: one dewatering well, one injection well. 

Commissioning of the process plant will take place at the end of Year -1, coinciding with the first ore 

production. Commercial production will commence one month after first ore is produced, and the operation 

will ramp up to nameplate capacity in the following four months.

1.18 Conclusions 

Results of this Feasibility Study demonstrate that the Cerro Blanco project warrants development due to its 

positive, robust economics. 

It is the conclusion of the QPs that the Feasibility Study (FS) summarized in this technical report contains 

adequate detail and information to support a Feasibility Study analysis. Standard industry practices, 

equipment and design methods were used in this FS and, except for those outlined in this section, the 

report's authors are unaware of any unusual or significant risks, or uncertainties that would affect project 

reliability or confidence based on the data and information made available. 

For these reasons, the path forward should focus on obtaining required permit amendments and new 

permits for the access road and powerline, while concurrently advancing key activities that will reduce 

project execution risk and schedule. 

Risk is present in any development project. Feasibility engineering formulates design and engineering 

solutions to reduce risk common to every mining project, such as resource uncertainty, mining recovery 

and dilution control, metallurgical recoveries, political risks, environmental and social risks, and labour 

sourcing. 

1.18.1 Risks 

The most significant project risks are summarized below: 

 Complexity of Ore Body – The complexity of Cerro Blanco's ore body could potentially lead to 

increased mining dilution. As with most vein deposits grade control and proper mining execution 

will maintain minimal unplanned dilution, which would minimize potential impacts on grade, 

throughput, and operating costs. Additional test stoping will help to verify dilution estimates. 

 Groundwater – Groundwater inflows have been modeled and the mine development plan 

addresses estimated flows as well as potential variations that can be controlled by mining 

techniques. Increases in the actual amount of groundwater encountered would impact development 

costs and / or schedule. Drilling for drainage, and operational definition drilling included in the mine 

plan will help to identify specific water bearing zones with higher than expected flows to establish 

control and/or management procedures. Initiating well development earlier in the mine life to allow 

more time for dewatering may also prove to be an effective mitigation measure. 

 Dewatering and Injection Wells – Performance of dewatering and injection wells is based on 

simulations of the calibrated groundwater model. Once wells are installed, there is potential that 

they may not perform as expected (either in terms of inflows or injection capacities), resulting in a 

requirement for additional wells, and ultimately an increase in assumed project schedule and cost. 

 Permitting – While the project is fully permitted and has an approved EIA in place, permit 

amendments are required for some of the proposed modifications, including increased processing 

rate and reinjection of mine water. New EIAs and permits are also needed for the power line and 

access road. Potential delays in approval of permit amendments and/or new permits could result 

in increased duration of assumed project development schedule. 

 Project Schedule – project components are tightly coupled within the schedule and there are many 

components that have to be completed without delay to maintain desired development targets.

 Tailings and Waste Rock Geochemistry – Tailings and waste rock are assumed to be Non-Acid-

Generating (NAG) based on test work completed to date (and the limited exposure time at surface 

for waste rock). Additional test work is required prior to detail engineering to confirm this 

assumption. If classification is changed to Potentially-Acid Generating (PAG), the design will need 

to be updated accordingly. 

 Power Cost – The cost of grid power is based on a market projection and not a power supply 

agreement. A higher power cost would result in increased operating costs. 

 Socio-Political Risk – Although the local community is favorable to the development of Cerro Blanco 

as an underground mine, there is a potential risk of socio-political opposition to mine development 

which could adversely impact the project development schedule, and 

 Land Negotiations – There is a potential for schedule delays due to negotiating land agreements 

and/or right-of-ways for areas impacted outside of the property boundary (i.e. access road / 

powerline right-of-ways and injection well pads). 

1.18.2 Opportunities 

The main opportunities identified for the Project are listed below: 

 Resource Conversion – Through additional infill diamond drilling, there is an opportunity to increase 

Measured and Indicated Resources from Inferred Resources. 

 Resource Expansion – With additional diamond drilling, there is an opportunity to discover and 

develop additional veins and extend known veins to increase resources. 

 Ore Sorting – Initial tests indicate the ore at Cerro Blanco is amenable to laser ore sorting. While 

additional test work is recommended on rock samples representative of the mine plan, if ore sorting 

is implemented in the process design it will result in opportunities to reduce plant size and/or allow 

for more flexibility in mining method by mitigating potential increased dilution. 

 Paste Plant – There is potential to defer the requirement for a paste plant up to three years by using 

cemented rock fill for rib pillars, resulting in significant deferral of capital in the project economics. 

 Target Underground Cooling Temperature – Increasing target wet bulb temperature from 28°C may 

result in smaller cooling plant requirement and result in reduced initial and sustaining capital costs. 

 Capacity of Surface Discharge – The FS water management plan does not use the maximum 

permitted surface discharge capacity for treated water, since a portion of the treated water is being 

returned to the process plant as make-up water. The WTP can be expanded to allow for increased 

treatment capacity to maximize the permitted water discharge rate, which would result in reduced 

injection requirements and capital costs associated with drilling of new injection wells. Additionally, 

treated groundwater could potentially be delivered to the local communities in the dry season to 

support agricultural activity. 

 Geothermal Energy Recovery – While not part of the FS design, there may be potential to recover 

energy from hot mine water to reduce site power requirements from the grid and lower operating 

costs, and

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 1-21 

 

 Used Equipment – There may be an opportunity to source used equipment for the process plant to 

reduce initial capital costs. 

1.18.3 Recommendations 

The project exhibits robust economics with the assumed gold price, exchange rate, labour rates and 

consumables pricing. The recommended development path is to continue efforts to obtain amendments for 

existing permits and new permits for the access road and power line, while concurrently advancing key 

activities that will reduce project execution time and help minimize costs. Associated project risks are 

deemed manageable and identified opportunities could provide enhanced economic value. 

Based on the project risks and opportunities, the following were identified as critical actions with potential 

to strengthen the project and further reduce risk, and should be pursued as part of the project development 

plan: 

 Complete additional infill diamond drilling to convert more of the Inferred Mineral Resource into 

Measured and Indicated resources 

 Conduct trial mining (i.e. test stoping) to verify dilution estimates, confirm drift dimensions, 

support designs and vein geometry, and increase volume of ore stockpiles already on surface 

 Conduct further test work on the viability of employing ore sorting technology as a method of 

rejecting waste in the plant feed and increasing head grade in the process plant  

 Investigate the potential to purchase used equipment to reduce project capital costs, and 

 Develop a mine plan which only considers the ore body above the current water table to determine 

impact on project economics.

2 Introduction 

2.1 Basis of Technical Report 

Bluestone commissioned JDS to complete a Feasibility Study (FS) for the Cerro Blanco Project in 

September 2017. The Project is located in the Jutiapa Department of Guatemala, near the town of Asunción 

Mita. 

The Project is proposed to be mined by conventional underground longhole and cut and fill mining methods 

at an annual average rate of 382,700 tonnes per annum (t/a). Underground openings will be backfilled with 

a combination of paste fill, Cemented Rock Fill (CRF) and unconsolidated waste rock. Run of mine (ROM) 

ore will be hauled to surface via the north access ramp where it will be stored in a stockpile prior to entering 

the crushing circuit. Gold will be extracted through a standard comminution circuit (3 stage crushing and 2 

stage grinding) followed by cyanidation leaching and refining to produce a final doré product. Treated water 

for the process and paste backfill plants will be sourced from the WTP. A network of diversion ditches and 

catchment ponds will be utilized to segregate contact and non-contact water. Contact water will be treated 

through the existing WTP prior to monitoring and discharge; non-contact water will be discharged after 

monitoring to ensure water quality discharge criteria are met. Most of the tailings will be filtered and trucked 

to a drystack tailings facility (DSTF) while a portion of the filtered tailings will be used in the backfill plant to 

produce paste backfill. A series of new deep dewatering and injection wells will be phased over the mine 

life to control inflows of water within the underground mine. A total of 940 koz of gold and 3.6 Moz of silver 

is planned to be recovered over an 8-year mine life. 

This report presents the results of the FS, in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators'

4.2 Mineral Tenure 

4.2.1 Underlying Agreements Specific to the Resource and Land Tenure 

In Guatemala, natural resources are property of the State. Consequently, mining exploitation only requires 

the resolution of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Ministry of the Environment before an exploitation 

license can be granted. Land tenure in Guatemala is regulated by the constitutional law which states that 

all citizens have the right to obtain land as private property. Access to land during exploration and 

exploitation by mining companies can be obtained by outright purchase of surface rights from landowners 

or by lease agreements under civil and constitutional law. 

4.2.2 Mineral Rights 

Guatemalan mining law provides for three types of licenses specifically for reconnaissance, exploration and 

exploitation. A reconnaissance license has a term with the possibility of renewal for an additional six-month 

period. The reconnaissance license can cover an area from 500 to 3,000 km2 and, upon application, can 

be converted to an exploration license. An exploration license covers areas up to 100 km2, has a term of 

three years and can be extended for two additional two-year periods; with each extension, the surface area 

of the exploration license must be reduced by 50% unless a request is made for an extension two months 

prior to expiration of the term. An exploration license is succeeded by an exploitation license, which has a 

25 year term that can be extended for a second 25-year period. It covers a maximum of 20 km2. Surface 

rights fees are payable with all types of licenses and royalties of up to 4% are payable on commercial 

production at the exploitation stage, shared between the State and the municipality where the project is 

situated. 

The Cerro Blanco exploration concession was awarded to Entre Mares de Guatemala, S.A. on November 

12, 1997, and covered an area of 39 km2. The exploitation license was granted to Entre Mares in 2007 for 

25 years, and is identified as LEXT-031-05. This license includes the water rights and rights of way 

associated with the property. 

4.2.3 Land Strategy and Property Ownership 

Minerales Entre Mares de Guatemala, S.A. (Entre Mares) is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of 

Bluestone Resources, who acquired 100% of Entre Mares from Goldcorp Inc. (Goldcorp) in 2017. Goldcorp 

originally acquired the project from Glamis Gold in 2006, as an exploration property. 

Entre Mares has purchased the surface over the expected deposit and additional land for plant facilities. 

Figure 4-3 shows the current land ownership in the immediate area around the Project.

4.3 Mining Rights 

The Project will be developed as an underground mining operation. Entre Mares owns the mining rights for 

Cerro Blanco and has the required approved permits and water rights to develop the property. 

The coordinates of the 15.25 km2 exploitation license are recorded in Decree DIC-CM-158-05, and are 

shown in Figure 4-4. The perimeter of the area is described as having the following vertices in the maps

4.4 Project Agreements 

In 2007, the government of Guatemala (under the Mining Law, Decree Number 114-97) awarded Entre 

Mares an exploitation license "Proyecto Minero Cerro Blanco". This granted the Company exclusive rights 

to mine gold and silver inside the boundaries of the approved concession for a period of 25 years from the 

day that the notification was received. 

4.4.1 Liens, Charges and Encumbrances 

Authorization Canon: In accordance with paragraph a) of Article 66 of the Mining Law, the title holder 

must pay in advance, in Quetzals at the time of the resolution, an authorization payment of 1,300 Quetzals. 

Surface Area Canon: In accordance with Paragraph d) of Article 66 of the Mining Law, the title holder must 

pay in advance, in January of each year, a surface area canon of 12 units per square km or fraction thereof. 

The payment in the first year is made at the time of notification of the resolution; this amount is proportional 

to the time remaining in the year from the approval date to December 31. 

Royalties: The title holder must pay royalties to the State and the Municipality of Asunción Mita for the 

extraction of mineral products. The royalties are determined according to Article 63 of the Mining Law, 

Decree 48-97 and Article 33 of the Mining Law, Agreement 176-2001. The royalties must be paid to the 

State and the Municipality within 30 days after the end of the calendar year. The title holder must attach a 

photocopy of the receipts of payment to his annual report. Failure to pay will attract interest payments at 

the current average rate in the banking system. 

Title Holder Obligations: The title holder of the exploitation license is obliged to: 

1. Start exploitation work on the "orebody" within 12 months of the date of the approval resolution. 

However, this period will be extended if the characteristics of the orebody require it, or when other 

circumstances justify it. 

2. Technically develop the orebody 

3. Within the stipulated periods, pay the surface area canon and royalties. 

4. Comply with the terms of the approved Environmental Impact Study and carry out the 

recommendations indicated in resolution 2613-2007/ECM/LP, August 14, 2007, issued by the 

Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. 

5. Compensate third parties for any damages and harm that may be caused by the operation. 

6. Present a written annual report to the Directorate General of Mining within three months of the end 

of each calendar year. 

4.5 Environmental Liabilities and Considerations 

To the extent known as a result of the FS due diligence review, the Project is not subject to environmental 

liabilities other than the obligations attached to the existing permits. The Cerro Blanco Permits Register 

shows that all applicable permits obligations have been fulfilled.

4.6 Permit Requirements 

As noted in Section 1.12, Cerro Blanco has all necessary permits to proceed with developing the 

underground mine and construction of the process facilities, subject to future operations adhering to the 

conditions of the exiting permits. Two main components of the Project not covered by the existing permits 

are:  

 EIA and permits for the proposed access road and power line, and 

 EIA amendments for injection of mine water. 

These amendments and applications will have to be prepared and submitted to MARN for approval. In 

addition, amendments are required for specific permits (highlighted in Section 20.2) to address updated 

designs stemming from the FS. 

4.7 Property Risks 

During the FS review, no significant factors and risks were identified that may affect access, title, or the 

right or ability to perform work on the property.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 

Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Accessibility 

Current access to site is via the Pan-American Highway (CA1) through the town of Asunción Mita. Existing 

infrastructure is in place to provide year-round access to the site. The topography is relatively flat with rolling 

hills. 

Guatemala has 400 km of coastline, and claims territorial waters extending out 22 km, plus an exclusive 

economic zone of 370 km offshore. Hurricanes and tropical storms sometimes affect coastal regions. 

There are five main ports in Guatemala listed below, along with their main activities: 

 Atlantic ports 

o Puerto Santo Tomás de Castilla (containers) and 

o Puerto Barrios. 

 Pacific ports 

o Puerto San José (liquids) 

o Puerto Quetzal (multi-use), and 

o Puerto Champerico (fishing). 

Puerto Santo Tomás de Castilla is the most important port on the Atlantic coast of Guatemala. It is a cargo 

terminal, which can handle many kinds of cargo such as containers, roll-on, roll-off (RoRo), as well as 

general and liquid bulk cargo, passenger ships, vehicle carriers, and barges. The port facilities are 

approximately 290 km northeast of Guatemala City. The total distance from Santo Tomás de Castilla to the 

Cerro Blanco project site is approximately 440 km. 

Puerto Quetzal is the most important port on the Pacific Coast and has the most modern installations. It is 

mainly a dry bulk cargo terminal; however, it also handles containers, RoRo, general bulk cargo, and liquid 

bulk cargo. The port facilities are about 100 km South of Guatemala City. The distance from Puerto Quetzal 

to the Project site using the coastal highway is approximately 310 km. Puerto Quetzal is 2,050 nautical 

miles from Los Angeles. 

These two ports handle nearly 80% of the sea traffic to Guatemala. Guatemala's Empresa Nacional 

Portuaria is a state-owned corporation of the Guatemalan port facilities. 

5.2 Climate and Physiography 

The climate and vegetation are typical of a tropical dry forest environment. The elevation is between 450 

masl and 560 masl. The wet season is typically from May through to October. The average annual rainfall 

is 1,350 mm. Daily highs reach 41°C and lows reach 10°C. The average annual pan evaporation rate is 

2,530 mm with an annual average humidity of 62%.

Classified as Zona Oriental, the principal characteristics of the region are a deficiency of rain for much of 

the year with high ambient daytime temperatures. Most of the vegetation in the Project area loses its foliage 

because of a lack of precipitation to support growth during the winter months of November through April. 

The Project occurs within a south-southwest trending ridge that extends from higher ground to the north, 

outward into the basin and flood plain deposits of the Rio Grande de Mita. The elevation of the upper part 

of the ridge is in excess of 600 masl. The elevation of the basin and flood plain deposits is about 460 masl 

to 490 masl. 

The west side of the ridge is flanked by a south-southeast trending perennial drainage called Rio 

Tancushapa. The east side of the ridge is flanked by a seasonal drainage called Quebrada El Tempisque 

which also trends to the south-southeast. These drainages join to the south-southeast of the Project area 

and flow into the Rio Grande de Mita about 4 km down gradient. 

The regional area is generally hilly to mountainous with broad flood plains formed by some of the larger 

streams and rivers. Three dormant volcanoes are within sight of the Project area: to the north is the 

Ixtepeque volcano, to the northwest is the Suchitan, and to the southwest is the Las Viboras volcano. 

The Project is located on a hill with two peaks. The surrounding areas are relatively flat with minimal 

undulation. A photo showing the typical landscape around the mine property is included as Figure 5-1.

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Project is situated in proximity to a number of communities, the largest one being Asunción Mita, with 

a population of approximately 17,500 people. The recently constructed La Baranca power substation is 

located a few kilometres south of Mita. The substation has a capacity to supply up to 20 MW of power. 

There is no record of any previous mining in the area; however, with the closure of Goldcorp's Marlin mine 

in late 2017 it is anticipated that a significant contingent of Guatemalan trained labour will be available for 

employment at Cerro Blanco. As such, the Project intends to hire the majority of Operations staff locally 

and has allowed for cost of training programs within the Owner's budget. The mine workforce is expected 

to live in the surrounding communities and provide their own transportation to and from the mine site due 

to proximity of the population centers relative to the Project site (as shown in Figure 5-2).

6 History 

6.1 Management and Ownership 

On January 4, 2017, Bluestone entered into an agreement with Goldcorp Inc. (Goldcorp) to acquire 100% 

of Minerales Entre Mares de Guatemala, S.A. (Entre Mares, or EM), which was Goldcorp's indirect wholly-

owned Guatemalan subsidiary which holds a 100% interest in Cerro Blanco. On successful closure of the 

deal, Entre Mares became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bluestone, a Canadian company headquartered 

in Vancouver, British Columbia. 

6.2 Exploration History 

Mar-West Resources Ltd. (Mar-West) expanded their gold prospecting activities into southern Guatemala 

in 1997 after initially working in adjacent Honduras since 1995. The Cerro Blanco property was identified 

by Mar-West by sampling of densely silicified boulders, in some cases cut by chalcedonic veinlets, during 

an initial reconnaissance evaluation of an area near the active hot springs. An exploration concession was 

applied for and granted in 1997. The hot springs sinter area was soil sampled, trenched and surveyed with 

IP-resistivity-CSAMT geophysics. Subsequent traverses over the hill at Cerro Blanco yielded surface rock 

assays of 1 g/t to 3 g/t Au. Mar-West drilled nine holes from April to June 1998. These initial reverse 

circulation (RC) holes tested near surface open pit potential to shallow depths of 100 to 150 m. At least 

seven holes contained one or more intercepts of 5 to 15 m grading 1 to 5 g/t Au, with the occasional 10 to 

20 g/t Au interval. 

In October 1998, Mar-West's holdings in Honduras and Guatemala were purchased by Glamis Gold Ltd. 

(Glamis) primarily to acquire the San Martin deposit in Honduras; Mar-West geologists continued to manage 

the Cerro Blanco exploration program through March 1999. Drilling was advanced to Hole 19 when 

geophysical orientation surveys were completed. 

Mar-West (1998) and Glamis (1999 to 2006) drilled a total of 233 RC and diamond drillholes totaling 42,711 

m. 

Goldcorp became the sole proprietor of the Cerro Blanco Project through the purchase of Glamis in 

November 2006. Exploration activities at the Cerro Blanco property by Goldcorp included: 

 Surface soil geochemistry; 

 Surface rock geochemistry; 

 Surface geological mapping; 

 Construction of the North and South Ramp access and ventilation raises; 

 Underground geological mapping; 

 Underground chip sampling; and 

 Surface and underground diamond drilling.

6.3 Data Validation History 

Historical core logging, sampling, and QA/QC procedures were reviewed by Golder in 2014. Ten core 

samples were collected from quarter sawn NQ core, and selected drill hole collars were surveyed using a 

GPS. Assayed gold and silver grades were found to be consistent with those reported by Goldcorp. Golder 

was satisfied that the drill hole data was collected in a manner consistent with industry best practice 

standards. 

As part of the core logging data verification, Golder compared a selection of core logs against half-core 

stored at the Project site. Five half-core drill holes were reviewed from the North and South deposits. The 

Excel files were reviewed first, and drill holes were selected that represented the typical mineralization style 

for each deposit. In addition, 10 verification samples were taken from these drill holes. Each verification 

sample was a half-core sample sawed in half again with the quarter sample sent for analysis and the other 

quarter returned to the core racks. Table 6-1 summarizes the samples selected for core logging review and 

verification sampling.

Samples were sawed and bagged under Golder supervision and were transported off-site via helicopter 

and plane to Canada, and then by ground transportation to ALS Chemex laboratories in Sudbury for sample 

preparation and analysis. 

Comparison of the Excel files against the drill core indicated an excellent match between the core logs and 

the retained core.

Eight drill sites were visited, with multiple drill holes located at some sites. Casings had been removed for 

most drill holes. The data collected was a mixture of pre-Goldcorp drill holes (2006 or earlier) and drilling 

completed by Goldcorp during 2010 and 2011. All drill holes from surface were grouted to prevent water 

flow into the underground workings. 

Approximately 5% of the drill holes (20 holes) were subjected to data verification checks by Golder. The 20 

selected holes, summarized in Table 6-3, included a variety of historical data as well as some of the more 

recent holes. The data verification checks consisted of the following: 

 Comparison of final assays to the original laboratory certificates; 

 Analysis of external laboratory duplicate assays by generating XY scatter plots; and 

 Review of down hole survey measurements to identify anomalous changes to hole orientation.

Subsequently, Mineral Resources were reported as in-situ resources at cut-off grades of 1.0 g/t Au and 4.0 

g/t Au in 2014. Blocks were classified based on drill spacing (sample distances) and the number of drill 

holes. In-situ Mineral Resources are summarized in Table 6-5. No wire framing was performed around 

these blocks.

In 2016, Goldcorp listed resources for Cerro Blanco within its Annual Report. The last public statements by 

Goldcorp outlined historical resources of 2.05 Mt grading 12.69 g/t for 840,000 oz of gold in the Indicated 

category, as well as 0.75 Mt grading 9.34 g/t for 230,000 oz of gold in the Inferred category.  

The Indicated and Inferred resources are historical estimates and use the categories set out in NI 43-101. 

These resources are effective as of June 30, 2016 and are disclosed in Goldcorp's press release dated 

October 26, 2016. Resources were estimated using US$1,400/oz AU and US$20/oz Ag. Given the source 

of the estimates, Bluestone considers them reliable and relevant for the further development of the Project; 

however, a qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as current 

Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves, and the Company is not treating the historical estimates as current 

Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

7.1 Introduction 

The geology of Guatemala comprises rocks that are divided into two tectonic terrains due to the collision 

the North American, Caribbean, and Cocos tectonic plates during the Upper Cretaceous (70 to 90 million 

years ago). The Maya Block to the north is characterized by igneous and metamorphic basement rocks 

overlain by late Paleozoic metasediments. Mesozoic red beds, evaporites and marine limestones overlie 

these rocks, and a karst landscape formed in the thick limestone units across the north of the country. By 

contrast, southern Guatemala, south of the Motagua Valley, belongs to the Chortis Block, representing the 

northern part of the Caribbean Plate. This region forms an active volcanic arc which continues from the 

Guatemala-Mexico border along the Pacific side of Central America into central Costa Rica with most of 

the major eruptive events having occurred in the Tertiary and Quaternary.  

7.1.1 Regional Geology of Southern Guatemala 

Southern Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua are located within the Chortis continental 

crustal block. The tectonic event that sutured the Chortis block to the North American craton took place 

between 66 and 70 million years ago along the east-west-striking Polochic-Montagua fault system that 

crosses southern Guatemala (see Figure 7-1). Three regional east-west trending, left-lateral transform 

faults form the plate collision boundary, defined by the Polochic, Motagua and Jocotan fault systems from 

north to south. Nearer the Cerro Blanco deposit, other major regional structures strike north-northeast such 

as the Jalpatagua and Ipala faults, are important local structures.  

A large group of granitic stocks and batholiths intruded the suture zone south of the Polochic-Montagua 

fault with ages of 35 to 85 million years. These broadly bracket, both temporally and spatially, the collision 

event (Donnelly, et al., 1990).

The Jocotán Fault is generally considered the southern-most major suture-related fault. It is an east-west 

fault with considerable Late-Cretaceous dip-slip movement (south side down) but it had little or no Tertiary 

transcurrent movement. Cerro Blanco is located about 50 km south of the Jocotán Fault. 

The ancestral Middle America Trench developed at this time. The Pacific Oceanic plate is subducted 

beneath Central America and is the principal driving force for volcanic and intrusive igneous activity 

throughout Central America along this boundary trench. The earliest documented volcanic outpouring on 

the Chortis block was Paleocene (about 55 to 65 million years ago) (Pindell and Barrett, 1990). 

In Costa Rica and Panama, a series of west-northwest-trending (arc-parallel) back-arc basins developed. 

These accumulated tuffaceous sediments continuously from Eocene (about 55 million years) to the present

(Donnelly, et al., 1990). The principal periods of Andean-style calc-alkaline volcanism in the Chortis block 

include the Paleocene-Eocene (relatively minor), Oligocene (major), and Miocene-Pliocene (the biggest) 

(Pindell and Barrett, 1990). 

The Polochic-Montagua suture was reactivated as a sinistral (left-lateral) transform fault that displaced the 

Chortis block 130 km eastward with respect to the North American craton. Movement took place from 6 to 

10 million years ago (Deaton and Burkart, 1984). Associated extension was accommodated by a series of 

north-south grabens across southern Guatemala and western Honduras. Back-arc rift basins developed 

adjacent to northwest-striking normal faults all along western Central America. The Nicaraguan Rift began 

to form about 7 million years ago and continues to subside today. Bimodal, rhyolite-basalt volcanism began 

during this event and by 7 million years ago was widespread throughout the western half of the Chortis 

block. 

A large number of Central American gold deposits, including Marlin and Cerro Blanco, occur within a narrow 

belt parallel to the western Central American coast from southern Guatemala through to Panama. This 

metallogenic belt follows the volcanic arc. Precious metal deposits are clearly related in space and time to 

Miocene-Pliocene extensional tectonics and associated bimodal basalt-rhyolite volcanism. Published age 

dates cluster between 4 and 8 million years. Argon-argon dating (40Ar-39Ar) of adularia from Cerro Blanco 

returned a date of 2.69 ± 0.01 million years. 

7.1.2 Local Geology 

The Cerro Blanco deposit is a classic hot springs-related, low sulphidation quartz-chalcedony-adularia-

calcite vein system. It was localized along a structural corridor created during late Miocene-Pliocene 

tectonic extension within the active Central American Volcanic Arc. Deep penetrating faults and local 

bimodal igneous activity drove the Cerro Blanco hydrothermal system and formation of the gold deposit. 

The Cerro Blanco project lies within the volcanic province with the principle rock units being Tertiary 

volcanics, volcaniclastics and sediments including ignimbrites, siltstone, limestones and conglomerates that 

are intruded by andesitic and rhyolitic dykes. Recent basalt lava flows form the youngest rocks in the area, 

in addition to locally derived volcanic sediments. 

The gold (Au) and silver-bearing (Ag) veins and upper unit of silicified sediments (Salinas unit) occupy a 

north-trending graben bounded by a fault (termed the East Fault) representing a major structural feature 

that separates the main Cerro Blanco gold deposit from the Mita geothermal field immediately to the east. 

To the north, the graben is concealed beneath much younger, sub-horizontal basalts, and to the south it is 

concealed by recent alluvium. Rhyolite/dacite domes underlie the extreme northeast potion of the district. 

Active hot springs occur immediately south of the Cerro Blanco hill. 

Figure 7-2 shows the simplified geological map for Cerro Blanco.

7.1.2.1 Lithology 

The oldest rocks at Cerro Blanco, intersected in deep drill holes, belong to the Mita Group (Paleocene-

Eocene). This group exhibits a great variety of volcanic and sedimentary rocks with important marker beds 

that are crucial for understanding the complex structural geology. Thicknesses seem fairly constant, with 

little evidence of growth faulting or internal unconformities during their accumulation (Figure 7-3).

The deeper parts of the Mita Group are intersected in relatively few drill holes and correlations are uncertain; 

however, these are dominated by volcaniclastic rocks (Mvo, mass flow deposits, conglomerates) with 

intercalated autobrecciated and amygdaloidal porphyritic andesites (lithology code PA). There is a 

distinctive unit of dark grey siltstones and fine sandstones (Silt), frequently with syn-sedimentary disruption. 

The sequence is capped by a major unit of andesitic-dacitic tuff (Mcv, Figure 7-4), erupted in a single event. 

This is at least 50 m thick and rich in broken crystals and small pumice lapilli. It shows a weak compaction 

fabric or welding (see photographs below). 

Figure 7-4: Examples of Andesitic Lapilli Tuff (Mcv) 

 
Source: Pratt and Gordon (2019) 

The tuff is overlain by sandstones (Mss), followed by a nodular micritic to shelly, oyster-rich limestone (Mls, 

Figure 7-5) which is the most distinctive rock at Cerro Blanco. This limestone sequence is about 20 m thick 

and also includes calcarenites (Msc).

Source: Pratt and Gordon (2019) 

The limestone is overlain by a thick sequence of relatively massive, brick red to light grey siltstone and fine 

sandstone (Mbt). This distinctive rock has local accretionary lapilli, horizons of flaser and ripple cross-

bedded fine sandstone, and local calcareous concretions. The Mbt sequence is divided into lower and 

upper parts by an andesitic crystal tuff (Mat). It is also punctuated by intervals of clean, well-sorted, fine 

grained conglomerate (Mss). These can be rich in metamorphic vein quartz pebbles and dark grey schist, 

indicating a metamorphic hinterland. In the north part of the property there is a second major package of 

limestone (Mlm) (Figure 7-3), in turn overlain by further massive siltstones (Mbt). 

The Mita Group is overlain by the Salinas Group (Svc). This is a complex sequence of interbedded plant-

rich siltstones, sandstones, conglomerates, mass flow deposits, phreatic breccias, and thin hot spring rocks 

(sinters). The sinters (Ss) are mostly less than 1 m thick. The Salinas Group is characterized in the 

mineralized area by widespread chalcedonic alteration, which can make identifications difficult, and 

elsewhere by strong clay (smectite) alteration. In some places rock fragments have concentric chalcedony 

coats (pisoliths), implying they accumulated in a hot spring pool. Silicified reed fragments are common and 

locally upright, in original growth position (Figure 7-6). Rare gastropods were observed.

The sequence also includes rhyolitic tuffs and a rhyolite cryptodome / flow dome (Rp), both with bipyramidal, 

embayed quartz crystals. A dacite cryptodome or flow dome (dp) also crops out around the Cerro Blanco 

village and is observed in drill holes in the hanging wall of the East Fault (Figure 7-2). It has no quartz 

crystals, but distinctive, isolated long hornblende phenocrysts. Sediment dykes, common in geothermal 

districts, where they form the feeders to sand and mud volcanoes, are common in the Salinas Group. 

A typical log as shown in Figure 7-7 of the Salinas Group, with photographs, is shown below. It includes a 

body of rhyolite, possibly a cryptodome since probable peperites were seen at the contacts.

Source: Pratt and Gordon (2019) 

The highest stratigraphic part of the Salinas Group, at least 60 m thick and above the sinters, is cut in the 

graben in the hanging wall of the East Fault. It comprises lacustrine siltstones and volcaniclastic 

sandstones. The rocks are plant-rich and contain rare fish fossils and brine shrimp/ostracods (e.g. drillhole 

CB332). 

The Salinas Group includes common mass flow or hydrothermal breccias. Their geometry is frequently 

unclear; it is uncertain if they are dykes or aprons of phreatic (explosion) breccia ejected from hot springs. 

Some contain sinter clasts, confirming phreatic eruptions. Underground, the South Ramp is dominated by 

hydrothermal breccias (Hbx), with polymict clasts up to 0.5 m diameter. This may be the north margin of a 

south-dipping diatreme. Successive cross sections show it extending progressively deeper towards the 

south. 

Quaternary basalts (bi), with a felted, trachytic texture, crop out in the north of the Cerro Blanco property 

and occur in the low graben either side of the horst. They are clearly lava flows. Around the village of Cerro 

Blanco, they fill in the paleo-topography formed by a large dacite flow dome. It is unclear if this topography 

is erosional or is the original hummocky shape of the dacite flow. The basalts include flow foliated and 

autobrecciated types.

The youngest rocks comprise alluvium and, in a few places, modern travertine and tufa occur at springs 

around the flanks of Cerro Blanco hill (see Figure 7-8 below). The tufa cements colluvial blocks of the 

siliceous sinter (Salinas Group). But these tufas are modern and should not be confused with sinter. They 

imply probable karst formation and dissolution of limestone. 

Figure 7-8: Recent Travertine Exposure 

 
Source: Pratt and Gordon (2019) 

Discordant igneous intrusions are rare at Cerro Blanco, but a few thin rhyolite (Rp) and aphanitic andesite 

(ad) dykes are observed. 

7.1.2.2 Structure 

The gold mineralization at Cerro Blanco is hosted within a broadly north-south-striking graben. The East 

Fault (Figure 7-9), also referred to as the 'East Horst Fault' in previous studies, is cut by several drill holes 

and observed in drillcore as a broad zone of post-mineral cataclasite developed in Mita siltstone; however, 

the structure appears to control a linear rhyolite body, suggesting that it was also active during the 

mineralizing event. This fault seems to have several strands and may be listric. Hole CB332 and 329, in

and conglomerate (Mss). The apparent offset, shown by the offset of the sinter (Ss), is about 300 m.  

The immediate footwall of the East Fault, hosts to the gold-bearing quartz veins, is structurally complex. A 

deep geothermal drill hole (MG-07) shows gold mineralization in the probable down-dip extension of the 

East Fault, at 634-640 m downhole depth.

The Cerro Blanco property has a complex history of faulting. The structural control on mineralization is 

unusual for a low sulphidation epithermal vein deposits, which normally comprise a single, relatively 

continuous vein. At Cerro Blanco there are sheeted vein swarms that resemble a duplex. The screenshot 

below, from a 3D Leapfrog model, indicates the typical complexity in an East-West section (Figure 7-10). 

Note that the thickness of the Mcv west of the Mat Fault, and the Mvo to the East, is an artefact of the 

software and is overstated. Veins are shown in red, faults in white.

Simplistically, the structural history is comprised of:  

1. Sedimentation of the Mita Group in a basinal to shelf environment, with periodic incursions of calc-

alkaline volcanism (mostly waterlain andesitic tuffs and andesite flows, and their volcaniclastic 

equivalents). Some of the beds appear turbiditic (Silt), implying moderate water depth. Some 

metamorphic clasts imply a metamorphic hinterland.  

2. A compressive episode formed a series of broadly North-South-striking, West-verging folds, cored 

by Mita Group rocks, in particular, the Mvo and Mcv. These folds were associated with West-

verging reverse faults and resulted in local overturned limbs. There may have been a component 

of strike-slip, with development of a positive flower structure at the restraining bend in a major 

North-South strike slip fault. There is evidence that most of the gold-bearing veins developed at 

this stage. The controlling structures for the vein swarms are in the footwall of the East Fault and 

apparently steeper (e.g. the Main Fault – see Figure 7-10).  

3. Major extensional faulting with downthrows to the East of up to several hundred meters. These 

include the Ramp and East faults (see above). These faults may have been active during deposition 

of the Salinas Group (Svc), possibly growth faults. Metamorphic clasts in the Salinas Group implies 

continued input from a metamorphic hinterland. Offset of Quaternary basalts implies that the faults 

may still be active (neotectonic). These faults have the greatest surface expression, reflected in the 

modern topography by the Cerro Blanco ridge and flanking low relief alluvial plains.  

Drilling demonstrates that a large chunk of stratigraphy is missing. This comprises the Mls + Mbt (lower) 

and Mat. A NW-striking, SW-dipping fault (the 'Upper Mbt Fault') is inferred. It is unclear if this terminates 

into the major Ramp Fault or vice versa. The throw on the Upper Mbt Fault seems to decline towards the 

north and the stratigraphy is increasingly preserved in the footwall. Together, the Ramp and Upper Mbt

faults define a triangular-shaped block that seems to have slid out southwards. Explaining the geometry, in 

terms of tectonic regime, is difficult, but a reactivated, extensional flower structure is one possible 

explanation. 

Faults are difficult to map underground and in drill core because they are largely 'sealed' by silica; they 

generally do not form the zones of poor rock quality that typify post-mineral faults (though there are 

exceptions, for example along the East and Cross faults). This is reflected underground by the general lack 

of wall rock support. Figure 7-11 shows structural measurements from the underground workings for faults 

and veins. However, most understanding of the principal faults comes from 3D modelling, based on offsets 

of the lithostratigraphy and the marker beds.

The underground workings display numerous swarms of quartz veins. There are examples of conjugate 

veins, pinch and swell structures (for example, many veins thicken as they shallow), and veins refracting 

through different lithologies (competency control). Examples are shown in Figure 7-12.

The gold-bearing veins at Cerro Blanco are focused in the footwall, to the west, of the steep Main Fault 

(also referred to as the 'Main Zone'); in particular, they are concentrated in the uplifted blocks and West-

verging folds of 'basement' volcanic rock (Mcv and Mvo). The Upper Mbt lithostratigraphic unit seems to 

have been less favorable for veining, explaining the relative gap in veining between the North and South 

ramps. Likewise, the veins tend to pinch out in the Salinas Group (though some do make it to surface and 

carry low grades). 

In section view, the veins clearly form lozenge-like duplexes and sheeted swarms, one in the South, the 

other in the North Ramp. Figure 7-13 is a cross section across the South Ramp. Vein wireframes were 

generated in Leapfrog using core logging, alpha angles (angle between core axis and vein) in non-oriented 

drill core, assay data, and underground mapping. They show a distinct branching and converging of 

relatively shallow veins into a steeper zone (Main Fault). Most veins are also constrained to the footwall of 

the Ramp Fault and the hanging wall of the steeper Mat Fault.

Sheeted veins and lozenge-shaped duplexes are also obvious in map (plan) view. Figure 7-14 shows a 

series of horizontal slices at different elevations (North is up, Red = veins, Blue = faults). The gap between 

the South and North resource areas mostly comprises the triangular wedge Upper Mbt stratigraphy between 

the Upper Mbt and Ramp faults. This seems to have been unfavorable for veining.

Underground mapping supports the 3D modelling; it shows a similar steepening and converging of veins 

into the Main Fault / Zone. Individual veins become thicker and more closely spaced along the Main Fault. 

The way individual veins swing into and intersect with the Main Fault creates ore shoots that plunge 

approximately 30° South. 

There are some secondary (conjugate) vein directions, but stereograms for sub areas (Figure 7-15) show 

consistent patterns: steeper veins are mostly in the East and shallow veins in the West. In particular, a 

swarm of thick, sub horizontal veins occur in the immediate footwall of the Ramp Fault (see below). The 

cumulative thickness of the veins exceeds 3 m. The flat veins clearly imply reverse (compressive) 

movement on the Ramp Fault. Clearly, the major faults played an important role in partitioning vein 

development; they did not simply offset existing vein swarms. 

Figure 7-15: Stereograms for More Detailed Sub-areas in Underground Mapping 

 
Source: Pratt and Gordon (2019) 

The stress regime during vein formation can also be calculated from conjugate veins. The stereogram for 

all quartz veins measured underground shows the intersection between the two principal vein directions is 

sub horizontal). The dominant extension direction seems to have been vertical, which is highly unusual; 

epithermal veins generally develop during horizontal extension. The predominance of horizontal veins in 

the West supports the idea of vertical extension.

Field observations, 3D modelling, and stereograms therefore imply that the veins developed during 

compression, rather than extension. This fits with the overall compressional geometry of the West-verging 

folds and reverse faults, later reactivated as normal, extensional faults. These folds seem to have been 

eroded before deposition of the unconformable Salinas Group.  

As some steep veins cut the Salinas Group and the sinters are contemporaneous with hydrothermal activity, 

this suggests that the hydrothermal/geothermal activity spanned the change from compressional to 

extensional tectonics. 

7.2 Deposit Geology 

The Cerro Blanco deposit is a classic hot springs-related, low sulphidation quartz-adularia-calcite vein 

system. It is localized along a complex fault intersection created during late Miocene-Pliocene tectonic 

extension within the active Central American volcanic arc. Local igneous activities that drove the Cerro 

Blanco hydrothermal system include a vesicular andesite dike swarm and mineralization stage rhyolite / 

dacite flow dome eruption and cryptodome intrusion. 

The Cerro Blanco vein systems are best developed (widest and most continuous) within the 300 to 500 m 

elevation ranges. Principal host rocks include a Paleocene-Eocene lithic tuff – calcareous shallow marine-

volcaniclastic sequence and, to a lesser extent, the overlying Miocene-Pliocene volcaniclastic-hydrothermal 

breccia sequence. Productive vein zones often appear to bottom in barren calcite beneath ±300 m elevation 

in the northern half of the deposit. To the south, high-grade quartz-adularia-calcite vein zones narrow, but 

locally continue at least another 100 m down to 200 m elevation. Some veins remain open at depth. 

Massive chalcedonic silicification, referred to as a "silica cap", dominates the conglomerates of the Salinas 

unit. Silica-flooded volcaniclastics and phreatic breccia are interbedded with chalcedonic silica sinter from 

the present surface to depths of ± 100 m. Silicification also occurs in the underlying Mita as irregular 

envelopes, up to several metres wide, around the main veins as well as in the upper part of the limestone 

horizon as jasperoid. The red-bed siltstone is partially bleached and altered to a grey-green, illite- and 

smectite-bearing rock. Chlorite, in addition to illite and smectite, is a prominent alteration mineral in the 

ignimbrite where it is concentrated in the fiamme. 

Wall rock alteration, to a large extent, determines geotechnical rock hardness and also presents contrasting 

resistivity and electrical chargeability characteristics that could be exploited across the district in the search 

for new gold occurrences beneath thin colluvial or basalt cover. 

7.2.1 Mineralization 

The Cerro Blanco gold deposit occurs within a large hydrothermal alteration zone covering an area about 

5 km long and 1 km wide. This zone exhibits the effects of strong, pervasive hot spring type hydrothermal 

alteration. 

Gold mineralization at Cerro Blanco is hosted within a broadly north-south striking sequence of westerly-

dipping siltstones, sandstones, and limestones (Mita Group) that are capped by silicified conglomerates 

and sediments with contemporaneous dacite / rhyolite flow domes or cryptodomes (Salinas Unit). The 

Salinas rocks are syn-mineral and believed to have accumulated progressively in a low-relief graben 

characterized by a shallow groundwater table. The Salinas conglomerate was presumably derived by 

erosion of the flanking horst blocks as relief was created during active faulting. The topographic inversion

required to explain the current prominent position of the graben fill is ascribed to the silicic character of the 

Salinas unit and its consequent resistance to erosion. 

The Salinas Group includes thin hot spring deposits, including sinters, which are probably genetically linked 

to underlying swarms of epithermal, gold-bearing quartz veins. The west and east sides of the Cerro Blanco 

ridge consist of flat agricultural plains characterized by Quaternary basalts, interbedded with boulder beds 

and sands. These rocks also appear down-faulted to lower elevations, implying major post-mineral 

extensional movements on such faults; and, they may be neotectonic (active). 

The current gold resource occurs under a small hill and is confined within an area about 400 m by 800 m. 

The gold deposit is characterized by both high angle and low angle banded chalcedony veins, locally with 

calcite replacement textures. High angle mineralized faults and discontinuous stockwork zones host some 

of the highest gold grades. Gold bearing structures in the Cerro Blanco Project area extend 2 km to the 

northwest of the gold deposit and occur largely confined within the hydrothermal alteration zone. Exposures 

are poor and locally covered by alluvium and post-mineral rocks. Gold bearing structures extend at least 1 

km south and southwest of the deposit under valley fill and post-mineral rocks.  

Geothermal well MG7, located about 0.5 km east of the deposit, encountered a 27 m zone averaging 6.3 

g/t Au and 22 g/t Ag at a depth of 634 m. The upper 6 m of this zone averages 23.9 g/t Au and 79 g/t Ag. 

7.2.1.1 Vein Zones 

Petrographic descriptions of four vein zones, by Economic Geology Consulting (Thompson, et al., 2006), 

concluded that the veins consist of crustiform banded chalcedony, quartz, adularia, calcite, sulphides, and 

visible gold. The samples represent a range of almost 300 m in elevation. Bladed calcite or pseudomorphs 

after bladed calcite were seen in all four samples. Bladed calcite is a rapid depositional texture, common 

when calcite precipitates from boiling fluids. A wide variety of recrystallization textures in quartz and 

chalcedony may also indicate changing fluid conditions and periodic boiling. The only significant depth-

related textural or mineralogical change noted was an increase in quartz relative to chalcedony (Thompson, 

et al., 2006). Figure 7-16 shows a high-grade intercept in drill hole CB-309 with banded chalcedony-calcite-

adularia-sulphides and visible gold in Drill Hole CB-309 that assayed with 218 g/t Au and 525 g/t Ag.

Opaque minerals include pyrite, marcasite, acanthite, miargyrite and visible gold. Disseminated grains 

occur in most textures of quartz, chalcedony, adularia, and calcite. Sulphides and visible gold also fill 

interstices between adularia, quartz, and chalcedony (Thompson, et al., 2006). 

Observations include the following: 

 Vein zones are best developed throughout the model between elevations of 300 m and 500 m. This 

elevation range roughly coincides with the Mcv contact beneath and the Salinas contact above. 

Thus, the principal host rocks are the Mita Group calcareous sediments and overlying tuffs. 

 The quartz veins at Cerro Blanco occur mainly within Mita sediments. These moderate to steep 

veins are associated with a subsidiary conjugate set of low-angle veins. The majority of veins 

appear to stop at the Salinas contact, with the exception of sub-vertical veins in the south-east part 

of the South Zone which cut the Salinas and continue to surface.  

 Vein zones occur as two upward-flared arrays that appear to converge downwards and merge with 

basal master veins around the contact with the Mcv. The South Zone vein array is the better formed. 

High gold grades locally persist at least down to the 200 m elevation, notably in the southern third 

of the model.  

 There are several locations north of 7400N where drill holes pass beneath high-grade quartz veins 

but encounter only massive barren calcite. This is an indication that the bottoms of productive veins 

have been found at those locations. Within vein zone envelopes, individual veins do not form a 

random stockwork but tend to run parallel or sub-parallel to the main structural trends. 

Gold and silver at Cerro Blanco occur almost exclusively in quartz-dominated veins of Low Sulfidation 

epithermal origin. However, low disseminated grades are widespread within the Salinas conglomerates and 

rhyolites.

The definition of economic mineralization depends on the vein thickness, grade, and spacing. The structural 

control on the veins is discussed above. Most veins underground do not exceed 1-2 m; thicker veins only 

appear in the vicinity of the Main Fault. Figure 7-17 shows this in graphic form; every vein greater than 10 

mm in underground mapping is shown as a symbol.

Figure 7-18 shows vein textures associated with gold mineralization; they include bladed calcite, a classic 

indicator of boiling fluids, subsequently replaced by quartz or leached to give a skeletal framework. Other 

classic textures include crustiform banding, bands of cream-pinkish euhedral adularia, and quartz with 

minor dark grey silver sulphides / sulfosalts.

There is a tendency for the Cerro Blanco veins to become dark grey and dominated by banded chalcedony 

upwards. Many of the veins within the Salinas Group have this character; likewise, many of the veins in the 

South Ramp, which cut possible hydrothermal breccia (diatreme).  

There is a late phase of transparent, frequently scalenohedral (dog's tooth), calcite in many veins, 

particularly in the deeper parts of the Main Fault. Assays demonstrate that this late calcite phase is barren 

of gold. This phase may have been contemporaneous with the veins in the Salinas Group, which frequently 

have coarse rhombic (not bladed) calcite, replaced by quartz. They may date from the more extensional 

phase of veining, when the groundwater chemistry had changed to mostly CaCO3-saturated water. The 

hydrothermal cell was probably waning, allowing the influx of more groundwater. 

Many veins and siliceous rocks (rhyolite / dacite) at Cerro Blanco display siliceous mudstone / sandstone 

dykes. There are also common geopetal structures, late cavities filled by horizontally banded siliceous 

sediments of hydrothermal origin mixed with vein gangue. (Figure 7-19). These "fossil spirit levels" indicate 

proximity to the paleosurface and confirmed by the presence of sinter immediately above.

It is unusual to see epithermal veins developed immediately beneath sinter, although other examples do 

exist, e.g. McLoughlin, California, and imply that the topography at the time of mineralization was low and 

the water table very high. This is supported by the presence of accretionary lapilli in the Salinas Group; 

they are typical of 'wet' phreatic-dominated eruptions and pyroclastic surges. Diatremes and rhyolite flow 

domes are also typical in this environment. 

In summary, the principal control on gold mineralization at Cerro Blanco was probably the boiling level in a 

hydrothermal system. The best grades are associated with boiling textures. At many Low Sulfidation 

epithermal deposits, the vertical interval of economic grade is restricted to the former boiling level. This can 

be less than 100 m. These boiling levels form flat ore shoots. There are occurrences of high gold grade 

down to 640 m (downhole depth) in a geothermal hole (MG-07). Only cuttings are available, so the geometry 

is uncertain; it is possible that this is vein material that was caught up in a fault crush zone in the East Fault 

(much like the other exotic lithologies seen within the fault zone). 

There is a spatial association of the veins with limestone (Mls) and it is possible that this reactive rock 

triggered an increase in pH and caused gold deposition. However, the link remains uncertain as there are 

plenty of high-grade intersections in deeper rocks, well below the influence of the limestone. It is also 

possible that the limestone was more receptive to brittle fracturing and veining due to its more competent 

nature compared to the surrounding sediments and tuffs.

7.2.1.2 Hydrothermal Alteration 

Many Low Sulfidation epithermal vein deposits have significant, mechanically weak, halos of illite / smectite 

+ pyrite + sphene / leucoxene, however, the wall rocks at Cerro Blanco are generally only weakly clay 

altered and have a very low sulphide content. Most clay alteration is concentrated along some late faults, 

for example the Ramp and Cross faults, and within some of the hydrothermal breccias, particularly the 

phreatic breccias in the Salinas Group. Lack of disseminated sulphides in the wall rocks means that 

electrical geophysical methods may not give good results in targeting new veins. Likewise, the geochemical 

footprint in soils and rocks may be narrow. 

Silicification is widely developed within the Salinas, and more selectively in the underlying Mita Group where 

it occurs as irregular envelopes, up to several metres wide, around the main veins as well as in the upper 

part of the limestone horizon as jasperoid. The most impressive alteration feature at Cerro Blanco is the 

large "silica cap" hosted in the Salinas sediments, typically beginning at or below 400 m elevation and 

continuing upward to the surface. Most silica is directly related to hot spring activity; the sinters and pisolithic 

beds contain abundant silica (although it is possible that some had carbonate precursors). However, there 

are also numerous beds of sandstone, conglomerate and mass flow deposits in the Salinas Group which 

are highly siliceous and locally flooded by chalcedony and fine-grained pyrite. These rocks are black when 

fresh, white and limonite stained when oxidized. Exposures around the Cerro Blanco ridge show that this 

silicification can be very capricious and replaced abruptly and laterally by smectite-rich clay alteration.  

Where the paleo-groundwater table was several metres below the paleosurface, conglomerate in its 

immediate vicinity was silicified and the vadose zone above it was subjected to steam-heated alteration. 

The steam-heated alteration, containing cristobalite, kaolinite and alunite (an advanced argillic 

assemblage), was the product of acidic solutions formed by the condensation of ascendant H2S-bearing 

steam into downward-percolating groundwater. The overall result is an interlayered sequence of sinter, 

silicified conglomerate and steam-heated alteration.  

Many faults at Cerro Blanco are sealed by silica and are pre-mineral. Examples are shown in Figure 7-20.

Figure 7-20: Examples of Sealed, Silicified Fault Zones

The boiling hydrothermal fluids that formed the Cerro Blanco vein system produced an even larger volume 

of intensely altered wall rock. Alteration types and zoning are typical of low sulphidation epithermal systems. 

The remnant sinter above the deposit suggests that the Cerro Blanco system remains largely intact. 

Silicification continues locally down to 300 m elevation along fault zones and in favourable rock types. 

Overall, the Cerro Blanco silica cap averages 400 m wide and is up to 150 m deep for at least a kilometre 

in strike. Within 50 m to 100 m of the surface, silicification is manifested by opaline silica flooding in the 

fragmental Svc and Sfx units. At depth, very fine-grained quartz replacement of Mita Group calcareous 

sediments (locally forming jasperoid) and tuffs dominate. The Mcv crystal lithic tuff is generally only silicified 

near contacts with overlying sediments and along fault zones. 

Silicification typically yields outward to moderate to strong sericitic alteration above 400 m or 450 m 

elevation. At deeper levels, silicified zones grade outward and downward into large volumes of clay-sericite-

pyrite±calcite (Asp) alteration in Mita Group sediment and tuff. Pyrite contents are commonly in the range 

of 3% to 6%, locally reaching 10%. 

The Mcv is pervasively sericite-chlorite-pyrite±calcite altered virtually everywhere it has been drilled. 

Sericite dominates closer to mineralized faults and higher. Chlorite-calcite dominates outward and at depth. 

Pyrite is ubiquitous but generally less than 0.5%. 

The Cbx collapse/hydrothermal breccia displays diverse alteration assemblages. The alteration mineralogy 

often varies from clay-sericite to clay to chlorite-calcite to silica-dominant over short distances due to

structural and permeability controls. These mixed assemblages suggest that hydrothermal conditions 

fluctuated dramatically and often; never permitting any particular mineral assemblage to attain equilibrium. 

There are several large volumes of Mita Group Msc and Mls that show strong carbonate removal with clay 

alteration near the southern end of the model (7000N to 7150N). These carbonate depleted zones occur 

adjacent / peripheral to large hydrothermal breccia bodies. This rock that has a density around 2 g/ml 

probably has a very low rock strength. The hydrothermal alteration model may be a general indicator of 

rock hardness within and near the mineralized zones as indicated in preliminary analysis.  

Strong propylitic (mostly epidote + chlorite + calcite) alteration occurs in the deeper parts of the Mita Group 

(Mvo) and is seen in drilling. Skarn and skarnoids, all of them exoskarns, crop out on the East flank of the 

Cerro Blanco ridge. They include assemblages of brown garnet + diopside + epidote. Float boulders include 

composite skarn + limestone. The intrusion responsible for the skarnification has not been observed at 

surface or cut in drill holes but is likely from an older event that pre-dates the epithermal mineralization. A 

body of magnetite-rich skarn (Ska lithology code) crops out in the far north of the property, close to the 

overlying basalts. Drill holes in this area show potassic alteration (secondary biotite, e.g. drillhole CB281).

8 Deposit Types 

8.1 Deposit Models 

The low sulphide content and near absence of base metals in the Cerro Blanco veins confirm it as a classic 

hot springs-related low-sulphidation epithermal deposit. In common with most low-sulphidation deposits, it 

appears to be linked to compositionally bimodal, basalt-rhyolite volcanism, the hallmark of intra- and back-

arc rift settings worldwide. The hydrothermal system seems likely to have been initiated during rhyolite dyke 

and cryptodome emplacement, at the base of the Salinas unit, with the rhyolitic magma and magmatic input 

to the mineralizing fluid both being derived from the same deep parental magma chamber.  

Arc-related low sulphidation gold deposits occur at highest crustal levels most removed from inferred 

intrusion source rocks. Figure 8-1 shows the generalized deposit model.

Adularia-sericite epithermal gold-silver deposits characteristically occur as banded fissure veins and local 

vein / breccias which comprise predominantly colloform banded quartz, adularia, quartz pseudomorphing 

carbonate, and dark sulphidic material termed ginguro bands. Examples of adularia-sericite epithermal 

gold-silver deposits include: Waihi and Golden Cross, Pajingo, Vera Nancy, Cracow, Hishikari, Sado, 

Konamai, Tolukuma, Toka Tindung, Lampung, Chatree, Cerro Vanguardia, Esquel, El Peñon. 

At near surficial levels, many are capped by eruption breccias and sinter deposits. Eruption (phreatic) 

breccias, which form by the rapid expansion of depressurized geothermal fluids, are characterized by 

intensely silicified matrix and generally angular fragments including sinter, host rock and local surficial plant 

material. Although sinter deposits formed distal to fluid upflows commonly associated with eruption 

breccias, sinters tend to be barren with respect to gold but may be anomalous in other elements such as 

boron, arsenic and antimony. 

Although cooling and traditional boiling models still hold for the deposition of gangue minerals (adularia, 

quartz pseudomorphing platy calcite and chalcedony), and some gold, mixing of rising pregnant fluids with 

oxygenated or collapsing acid sulphate (low pH) groundwaters is also favoured as a mechanism for the 

development of characteristic bonanza gold-silver grades. Adularia-sericite vein systems are silver-rich with 

Au:Ag ratios greater than 1:10 being common. 

Wall rock alteration formed as halos to veins occurs as sericite (illite) grading to peripheral smectite clays 

with associated pyrite and chlorite, and this alteration grades to more marginal chlorite-carbonate 

(propylitic) alteration. Low temperature acid waters developed by the condensation of volatiles in the vadose 

zone contribute towards the formation of surficial acid sulphate alteration comprising silica (chalcedony, 

opal), kaolin, and local alunite and these acid sulphate waters are interpreted to collapse to deeper levels 

and so aid in mineral deposition. 

Structure and host rock competency are important mineralization controls in adularia-sericite vein systems. 

High-grade mineralized shoots often develop in dilational jogs or flexures in through going veins where 

veins of greater thickness and higher gold grade develop and the intersections of fault splays. Bonanza 

grade material may also develop at preferred sites of fluid quenching at rock competency changes. 

The connection between modern hot spring deposits and ancient hydrothermal systems, some with gold 

mineralization, has long been recognized (Lindgren, 1933). Epithermal mineral deposits are defined as 

those that develop close to the Earth's surface (within 1000 m). They developed from fluids like those in 

modern geothermal systems. Sillitoe and Hedenquist (2003) defined the three types of epithermal deposit: 

High, Intermediate, and Low Sulfidation. The Low Sulfidation variant commonly occurs in rift settings, with 

bimodal volcanism in young, often Tertiary, volcanic arcs (e.g. Henley and Ellis, 1983). It is commonly 

associated with maar volcanoes, diatremes and felsic flow domes. 

Cerro Blanco shows all the characteristics of a completely preserved, non-eroded epithermal deposit. The 

occurrence of hot springs (sinters, silicified reeds, pisoliths) directly above the presumed feeder veins at 

Cerro Blanco implies a high water table and swampy conditions (cf. McLaughlin, California). In areas of 

high topographic relief, outflow springs (sinter) are usually found several km from the upflow zones. The 

widespread occurrence of lacustrine and fluvial clastic sediments in the Salinas Group and accretionary 

lapilli, typical of water-rich pyroclastic surges, supports this interpretation. Sedimentation probably kept up 

with subsidence. Mudstone dykes and geopetal structures - open fractures filled by horizontally bedded 

chalcedonic and sulphide-rich sediment - reinforce the interpretation. The hydrothermal breccia in the South 

part of the South Ramp may be a diatreme.

2017 – 2018 Bluestone Drilling  

Drilling completed by Bluestone in 2017 and 2018 was a combination of surface and underground diamond 

core drilling. Underground channel sampling was also performed and included in the resource estimation.

Drills were operated by Continental Drilling of Guatemala. The surface drilling was performed using two 

Hydracore 1000 portable drill rigs, one of which was replaced later in the programme by a Boart Longyear 

LM-75 belonging to Bluestone, which was later converted for underground drilling. During the height of the 

drill program three LM-75 and two Hyracore rigs were operative. Drill holes are developed by drilling larger 

diameter core at the early stage of the hole (HQ) and reduced to NQ size and BQ size if drilling conditions 

become difficult. 

Core recoveries were high, and by utilizing several drill core sizes, Bluestone was able to ensure drill hole 

target completion. A total of 27 holes were drilled from surface, and 28 holes from underground platforms 

distributed over four platforms in the North and three platforms in the South Zone.  

Drill hole collars were surveyed using a Total Station (coordinate system - UTM NAD 27 Zone 16N). In-hole 

drill surveying for azimuth and dip was completed using the Reflex EZ-Shot system approximately every 

25 m down-hole. Orientation of drill core was performed throughout Bluestones' drill programme using 

Reflex ACT III downhole survey equipment.  

Pre-2017 Goldcorp and Glamis Drilling  

Drilling undertaken prior to Bluestone's ownership was comprised of a combination of reverse circulation 

and diamond with many early holes collared using RC and then switching to NQ size core. Collar data from 

these historical programs were surveyed with a differential GPS system, and down hole survey 

measurements were taken with either a single shot Sperry-Sun camera system or with a multi-shot Flexit 

instrument. 

The majority of drill holes from previous operators were not drilled perpendicular to the strike and dip of the 

veining and therefore do not represent true thickness of the veining. The most common vein intersections 

occur from between 0° and 60° to the core access. These intervals are thought to belong to steep to 

moderately dipping vein sets. These core intervals would be longer than the true thickness of the actual 

veining. Intersections ranging from 60° to 90° to the core axis are less common and are believed to belong 

to flat to near flat vein structures. These vein intervals would be closer to the true thickness of the veining 

but still longer than the true thickness. Only vein intervals drilled perpendicular to the strike and dip of the 

veining would represent the true thickness of the vein. Based on previous reports from Glamis Gold, the 

ratio to the true thickness of the vein on average is about 1.73 (i.e. every 1.7 m represents 1 m of true vein 

thickness). 

Significant Assays Results 

Table 10-2 provides a selection of significant drill hole intervals from the Cerro Blanco drill hole database. 

Drill hole intervals are reported as actual core lengths and do not represent the true thickness.

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

11.1 Sampling Method and Approach 

11.1.1 Sampling Preparation, Analyses and Security (prior to November 2006) 

Prior to Goldcorp taking ownership of the Cerro Blanco Project in November 2006, all previous drilling, 

sampling, and assaying was under the control of Glamis (Voorhees, 2005). 

All sample data used in the Cerro Blanco mineral resource calculations was produced by either diamond 

drill (DD) or reverse circulation (RC) drilling. Drilling contractors were hired to supply the drilling equipment 

and, under the direct supervision of owner field personnel, perform the work. 

The Glamis drill hole program used a variable combination of sample collection: 

 Double tube HQ core in the upper reaches of the hole switching to double tube NQ core deeper in 

the hole; 

 RC in the upper reaches of the hole above the water table and/or the anticipated mineralization 

zone switching to double tube NQ core deeper in the hole; and 

 Reverse circulation for the entire hole. 

Rotary samples collected from the 4 ¾ inch, face-sampling, hammer-drilled RC holes were initially collected 

in a five-gallon bucket. The weight was then recorded, and the sample placed into the hopper of a Gilson 

splitter. The process was repeated until the entire 1.5 m sample was collected. The total weight was 

recorded on the sample sheet along with the sample identification and the time of day collected. Weights 

were only recorded for the dry portion of the drill hole. The Gilson splitter was set to split the sample into 

two halves, one half is retained and the other wasted. The remaining 50% was placed into the hopper again 

and another 50% split was made. The two samples were placed into a pre- labelled plastic sample bags, 

one for assay and the other was stored. An air hose and nozzle were provided for cleaning the Gilson 

splitter, pan, and buckets. A geologist was assigned to the rotary rig to supervise sample collection and log 

geology. A chip tray was created as a permanent record of each hole. 

Core was collected and placed in wooden core boxes. The core was washed to obtain a clean surface for 

geological and geotechnical logging and placed in a covered logging facility. All core was photographed on 

print film. Core was sawn longitudinally with a diamond saw and half the core, on a nominal 1.5 m interval 

broken at lithologic boundaries, and was placed in pre-labelled plastic bags. 

The other half was retained for inspection or additional tests as warranted. Splits from the core holes were 

shipped to a facility operated by CAS labs in Honduras. Unused core was retained for inspection on-site. 

All sample preparation and analyses were conducted by CAS Laboratories in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. 

Samples were transported from Cerro Blanco to the laboratory in Tegucigalpa, Honduras by CAS 

personnel. Reject samples and pulps were stored at the CAS facility. Samples were analyzed for gold, 

using a 30 gram pulp with Fire Assay, AA finish. Samples that ran over 1.0 g/t Au from this method were 

re-analyzed for both gold and silver using a 30 gram pulp, Fire Assay with Gravimetric finish.

Glamis had established a limited Quality Control and Quality Assurance QA/QC program focused on coarse 

reject and pulp reject checks. A frequency of 1 in 20 pulps was systematically submitted to the Chemex 

Laboratories in Nevada for Au and Ag analysis in addition to coarse rejects. 

The drill samples were initially quick-logged to locate and mark significant changes in volcanic stratigraphy. 

Then each volcanic unit is described, the location of structure and their orientations, the percentage of 

quartz veining, and the type of alteration was recorded. 

Standard logging conventions were used to capture information from the drill sample. Detailed logging was 

done daily and transcribed on to log sheets and independently entered into Excel spreadsheets. The 

geologist checked data entry before data was merged with the main database. 

Detailed core logging was done by capturing data in four tables: lithology, alteration and sulphide type and 

geotechnical. Lithology was captured using standardized abbreviations. Alteration was captured as a 

numeric value corresponding to alteration type. The visible sulphide types were captured as a total modal 

percentage and as relative ratios. Structural data was captured in the Comments / Structures table in the 

database as type and angles taken related to core axis are displayed in an area as a graphical 

representation. The geotechnical data recorded was RQD (Rock Quality Designation) data for the core 

portion of the hole. 

All independent laboratories used in the Cerro Blanco Project employed quality control procedures and 

protocols that included duplicates, standard reference materials and blanks. These were available to Glamis 

but were not included in assay reports. 

11.1.2 Sampling Preparation, Analyses and Security (Goldcorp 2010 through 2012) 

Drilling completed by Goldcorp (2010 to 2012) was a combination of surface and underground diamond 

core drilling. Drills were operated by both contract and Goldcorp personnel. The Goldcorp underground drill 

rig (Boart Longyear LM-75) was used on the surface and converted for underground drilling. Drill holes 

were developed by drilling larger diameter core at the early stage of the hole (HQ) and reduced to NQ size 

and BQ size if drilling conditions are difficult. Drill recovery was high and, by utilizing several drill core sizes, 

Goldcorp was able ensure drill hole target completion. Drill hole collar surveys were completed using a 

GPS Trimble system (UTM NAD 27 Zone 16N). In-hole drill surveying for azimuth and dip was completed 

using the Reflex EZ-Shot system approximately every 50 m along the drill hole. 

Drill cores (surface and underground) were stored in wooden labelled boxes from the drill and transported 

to the surface core logging facility at Cerro Blanco surface core facility. 

Technicians first prepared the core boxes by reviewing drill hole depth tags then re-assembling broken 

sections (from zones of poor recovery). 

Core logging to identify lithology, alteration, RQD, and sampling selection for core sawing was completed 

by geologists or by technicians under the direction of the geologist. Sampling was also completed by 

Goldcorp personnel that included technicians and geologists. The typical sample lengths are 1.0 to 1.5 m 

with maximum lengths of 2.0 and 3.0 m; sample lengths were based on the lithology and alteration. Logs 

and the sample database indicated that low grade and high-grade gold and silver samples were of the 

same lengths and were not broken out separately or collected in a way to cause sample bias. Samples 

were collected along the footwall, mineralized zones, and hanging walls without breaks in sampling. Blanks 

were inserted by Goldcorp personnel when a core sample was submitted. All data was initially collected on

paper logs and later transferred to Microsoft Excel files. This data was then entered in MapInfo™ and 

MineSight™ software for geological modelling. 

The core selected for analysis was transported to Inspectorate Laboratories in Guatemala City for sample 

preparation. Samples are prepared at Inspectorate (Guatemala) by crushing and pulverizing the drill core 

down to 100 g pulp samples. 

One pulp sample was sent to Goldcorp's Marlin mine for assaying of gold (Fire Assay with AA or gravimetric 

finish) and silver (AA or AA with gravimetric finish). The second pulp sample was sent to Inspectorate 

(Nevada) laboratory in Reno for assaying of gold (Fire Assay with AA or gravimetric finish) and silver (AA 

or AA with gravimetric finish). The Marlin mine assays were completed quickly, which assisted the 

geologists in developing the drilling program. The Inspectorate (Nevada) assays were used for the purposes 

of mineral resource modelling and estimation. 

The QA/QC program employed at the Cerro Blanco Project was under the direction of Goldcorp which 

included blank samples inserted by Goldcorp geologists prior to shipping to Inspectorate at a frequency of 

1 in 25 sample submission. No duplicates of coarse rejects or standards had been included in the QA/QC 

program at Cerro Blanco; however, it was recommended that duplicates of the coarse rejects be analyzed 

and compared in addition to standards be inserted into the QA/QC sample stream for future drilling 

campaigns. All analytical results were provided to Goldcorp staff and stored first in Excel and later in 

MapInfo™ and MineSight™ software. 

All half-core samples collected by both Goldcorp and Glamis are stored adjacent to the core logging facility 

on the Cerro Blanco Project site. The Cerro Blanco site is fully controlled by perimeter fencing and security 

on the property. All samples removed from site were under the control of Inspectorate Laboratories. 

11.1.3 Sampling Preparation, Analyses and Security (Bluestone 2017 – 2018) 

Drill core from surface and underground was stored in labelled wooden boxes (see Figure 11-1), from the 

drill and transported from the drill to the surface core logging facility. Before core splitting and logging 

commences, drill core is systematically photographed using tripod-mounted camera in high resolution and 

digitally archived for reference as part of the Drill Database.

Logging and sampling were undertaken on site at Cerro Blanco by Company personnel under a QA/QC 

protocol developed by Bluestone. Technicians first prepared the core boxes by reviewing drill hole depth 

tags, re-assembling broken sections, and photographing core. Core logging to identify lithology, alteration, 

RQD, and sampling selection for core sawing was completed by technicians under the direction of the 

geologist. Sampling was also completed by Bluestone technicians. The typical sample lengths are 1.0 to 

1.5 m with a minimum sample width of 1m and maximum lengths of 2.0 m; sample lengths were based on 

the lithology and alteration. Logs and the sample database indicated that low grade and high-grade gold 

and silver samples were of the same lengths and were not broken out separately or collected in a way to 

cause sample bias. Samples were collected along the footwall, mineralized zones, and hanging walls 

without breaks in sampling. All data was initially captured on paper logs and later transferred to Microsoft 

EXCEL. This data was then entered in MapInfo™ and MineSight™ software for geological modelling. 

Specific Gravity readings of both host rock and vein material were taken at regular intervals using the 

displaced water method.  

A total of 288 channel samples were taken along representative veins exposed in the side walls of the Cerro 

Blanco underground tunnels using a portable rock saw. The sampling was undertaken across / 

perpendicular to the mineralized structures wherever possible and carefully surveyed with xyz coordinates 

for use in 3D modeling. The samples were subject to the same QA/QC protocols as drill core and deemed 

suitable for use in calculation of resources. Figure 11-2 shows a saw-cut channel sample across 

mineralized vein in South Ramp of Cerro Blanco underground workings.

The core selected for analysis was transported to Inspectorate Laboratories in Guatemala City in security-

sealed bags for sample preparation before shipping to Inspectorate Laboratories (a division of Bureau 

Veritas) in Reno, Nevada, USA and ALS Chemex in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Both are ISO 17025 

accredited laboratories. Samples were prepared at Inspectorate by crushing and pulverizing the drill core 

down to 85% passing -75 microns. Pulps were weighed and individually packaged into 100g envelopes and 

shipped for analysis. Both coarse rejects and pulp were stored for future use and utilized in Bluestone's 

QA/QC programme. 

Gold and silver were analyzed by a 30-gram charge with Atomic Absorption with gravimetric finish for values 

exceeding 5 g/t Au and 100 g/t Ag. 

All analytical results were provided to Bluestone by respective Laboratory secure servers in excel, csv and 

pdf formats (certificates). Bluestone database files are stored and managed in Access and Excel formats 

before being transferred to MapInfoTM and MineSightTM software. 

All half-core is stored adjacent to the core logging facility on the Cerro Blanco Project site. The Cerro Blanco 

site is fully controlled by perimeter fencing and security on the property. 

11.2 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 

11.2.1 QA/QC Performance and Discussion of Results (Goldcorp 2010 through 2012) 

Field blanks of non-mineralized material were inserted into the sample series every 25 samples (4%) to 

test for any potential carry-over contamination which might occur in the crushing phase of sample

preparation due to poor cleaning practices. A total of 1,390 blanks where analyzed with 558 performed at 

Inspectorate Laboratories, 302 at CAS Honduras and 530 at the Marlin Mine laboratory. Analysis of the 

Inspectorate blanks resulted in five fails or 0.01% with one re-failing on resample. This appears to be the 

result of sample misclassification as both original and resample are relatively high grade. The CAS 

Honduras results showed eight fails or 0.03% with four of those failing on resample. Therefore, there may 

have been some cleaning issues at CAS Honduras although it was not wide spread or significant. The 

blanks from the Marlin Mine laboratory resulted in 14 fails or 0.03% which is not significant and considering 

that the Marlin Mine assaying was utilized for fast turnaround to guide the program and not for resource 

estimation purposes, does not pose an issue. 

Core duplicate samples were used to evaluate analytical precision and to determine if any biases exist 

between laboratories that may affect the overall assay database. The core duplicate samples were quarter-

spilt cores sampled on site and sent to Inspectorate Laboratories and CAS Laboratories, Honduras, 

respectively. A total of 1,060 samples with gold values >2 grams per tonne were selected in the drillhole 

database through hole CB-222. Of those a total of 797 samples were submitted for check analyses with 

618 samples being submitted to Inspectorate for checks of original CAS Honduras analyses while 179 

samples were submitted to CAS Honduras for checks of original Inspectorate analyses. The 618 

Inspectorate duplicate check samples show the CAS Honduras original samples to be 3% higher in gold 

and 16% higher in silver on an individual basis and 3% and 2.8% higher in gold and silver, respectively on 

an overall basis. 

The 179 CAS Honduras duplicate check samples show the Inspectorate original samples to be 1.5% lower 

in gold and 27% lower in silver on an individual basis and 6.8% and 11.4% lower in gold and silver, 

respectively, on an overall basis. 

Duplicate analyses from both labs show high variation in individual gold values, potentially attributable to 

nugget effect particularly for higher grade samples. However, on average the samples show a better 

correlation which has greater implications on a global or resource scale. The CAS Honduras check samples 

appeared to show a relatively small grade bias.  

Standards are used to test the accuracy of the assays and to monitor the consistency of the laboratory over 

time. Neither Glamis nor Goldcorp employed the use of standards. It was recommended that a QA/QC 

program be implemented during all future drill programs that include the insertion and analysis of standards 

in addition to blanks and duplicates along with umpire assays. 

11.2.2 QA/QC Performance and Discussion of Results (Bluestone 2017 to 2018) 

Since 2017, Bluestone has implemented a comprehensive QA/QC program employing industry standards 

and best practices for all its drillcore and channel sampling. This includes the regular insertion of blind 

Certified Reference Materials (blanks and standards) randomly into the sample stream, field blanks and 

duplicate analysis of pulps and coarse rejects at a second laboratory to independently assess analytical 

precision and accuracy of each samples batch as they are received from the laboratory. Additionally, pulp 

and coarse rejects were systematically submitted to ALS Chemex Laboratories in Vancouver for check 

analysis and additional quality control.  

Samples were transported in security-sealed bags to Inspectorate Laboratories in Guatemala City for 

sample preparation. Sample pulps were then shipped to Inspectorate Laboratories in Vancouver, BC,

Canada or Reno, NV, USA, and assayed for gold and silver using a 30-gram charge with atomic absorption 

and gravimetric finish for values exceeding 5 g/t Au and 100 g/t Ag. 

A total of 1,322 control samples (Table 11-1) were assigned for QA/QC purposes and accounted for 

approximately 20% of total samples taken during the program. 

Table 11-1: Quantity of Control Samples by Type (Bluestone 2017 to 2018) 

Source: Bluestone (2019) 

Standards are used to test the accuracy of the assays and to monitor the consistency of the laboratory over 

time. A variety of certified standards of various gold grades were purchased from CDN Laboratories as 

listed in Table 11-2 and inserted by the logging geologists. 

Table 11-2: Summary of Standards (Bluestone 2017 to 2018)

Field blanks are non-mineralized material sourced locally and inserted into the sample series one every 20 

samples (5%). Field blanks are inserted to test for any potential carry-over contamination which might occur 

in the crushing phase of sample preparation, because of laboratory poor cleaning practices.  

Duplicate analysis of pulps and quarter-core are used to evaluate analytical precision and to determine if 

any biases exist between laboratories. Duplicate analysis of coarse rejects is used to analyze preparation 

error. Table 11-3 details the QA/QC sample insertion rate.

QA/QC assay results were checked by a Bluestone database / QA-QC manager on a batch-by-batch basis 

for analytical or batch errors, and also reviewed independently by a consultant. No evidence of obvious 

analytical bias was noted.  

Except for one standard, the performance of the control samples was very good, reflecting the overall high 

quality of the analysis. Standard CDN-GS5T (4.76 g/t Au) utilized early in the Bluestone drill programme 

plotted consistently along the highest acceptable threshold for FA Instrumental Finish. Check analysis at 

both Inspectorate and ALS Chemex laboratories gave similar results. As lower grade CRM / blanks and the 

laboratories internal QA/QC ruled out any calibration issues, use of this particular standard was 

discontinued.  

Duplicates of pulp and coarse rejects were sent to ALS Chemex in Vancouver for check analysis. Coarse 

rejects were processed at ALS Chemex and their pulps analyzed as a check on laboratory preparation 

procedures. Results as shown in Figure 11-3 showed very good correlation evident at both low and high 

gold levels, with a correlation coefficient of 0.995 indicating excellent reproducibility between the two 

laboratories. The results can be interpreted as a reflection of the lack of coarse nuggety gold in the Cerro 

Blanco deposit.  

Analyses of blank samples (Figure 11-4), both pulp and field blanks consistently yielded gold values near 

or below the detection limit of the primary laboratory. No sample contamination was detected.

It is the opinion of the QP, Garth Kirkham, P.Geo., that the sampling preparation, security, analytical 

procedures and quality control protocols used by Bluestone are consistent with generally accepted industry 

best practices and therefore reliable for the purpose of resource estimation.

12 Data Verification 

Multiple site visits were conducted by the QPs, as detailed in Section 2.2. The purpose of these visits was 

to fulfill the requirements specified under NI 43-101 and to familiarize with the property. These site visits 

consisted of underground tours of non-mineralized development headings as well as an inspection of the 

surface core logging, sampling, storage areas and existing infrastructure. 

No limitations or failures to conduct data verification were identified by the QPs in the preparation of this 

Technical Report. 

12.1 Geology, Drilling and Assaying  

Garth Kirkham, P. Geo., first visited the property on May 8, 2017. The site visit included an inspection of 

the property, offices, underground vein exposures, core storage facilities, water treatment plant, ore 

stockpiles and a tour of major centers and surrounding villages most likely to be affected by any potential 

mining operation. 

Since 2017, Mr. Kirkham has visited the property numerous times for extended periods to develop and 

implement data gathering and sampling method and procedures. He also worked with Bluestone geologists 

to develop drill programs and to supervise interpretation and modelling efforts in addition to creating and 

implementing QA/QC procedures. 

Mr. Kirkham is confident that the data and results are valid and can be relied upon, including methods and 

procedures used. It is the opinion of Garth Kirkham, the independent author, that all work, procedures, and 

results have adhered to best practices and industry standards required by NI 43-101. 

Continued data validation and verification processes have not identified any material issues with the Cerro 

Blanco sample / assay data. Mr. Kirkham is satisfied that the assay data is of suitable quality to be used as 

the basis for this resource estimate. 

12.2 Mining 

Mining data was verified during multiple site visits and through review of previous studies completed for the 

site. Any studies referred to were thoroughly reviewed, updated and revised as required to align with the 

FS mine design and mine plan. All mining data was verified and is adequate for the FS Technical Report 

as required by NI 43-101 guidelines. 

12.3 Geotechnical 

The historic geotechnical core logging database was verified by JDS by reviewing the database for internal 

consistency and comparing the data with respective core photographs. Two recent (2018) resource drill 

holes were also geotechnically logged by JDS and underground geotechnical mapping was carried out and 

used to verify historic data.

12.4 Hydrogeology 

Regarding hydrogeology data, Hhan Olsen, P. Geo., first visited the site in 2011 and subsequent dates in 

2012 and 2014 to review the existing dewatering wells, dewatering sumps, monitoring and geothermal wells 

and to perform tests on existing wells. These visits included evaluation of the underground and regional 

surface and groundwater systems in relation to the mine. All hydrogeology data and reports received since 

the initial site visit have been reviewed and validated by Mr. Olsen, who is satisfied the integrity of data 

meets NI 43-101 requirements. 

12.5 Metallurgy 

Historically a number of metallurgical test programs were completed on the Cerro Blanco deposit by 

Kappes, Cassidy and Associates (KCA). The drill holes used for metallurgical test work were plotted against 

the planned area to be mined and were found to be spatially representative and provide sufficient variability 

in head grade for both gold and silver. The samples from these programs ranged in head grade from below 

10 g/t up to 50 g/t. The most recent test work included drill core used to create a global composite and 

samples taken from the underground workings to generate bulk detox tailings for physical and chemical 

test work. The bulk tailings sample was divided into two composites representing the North and South areas 

of the deposit based on the latest resource estimate. The bulk tailings samples and drill core selected for a 

global sample were sent to BaseMet Laboratories in Kamloops, BC. The drill core was used for flowsheet 

and design optimization test work. Within the re-interpreted shape of the ore zone, the global composite 

was mainly taken from the area representing the South portion of the deposit. With the global composite 

representing mainly the South area of the deposit, additional tests were completed using the North and the 

South bulk samples to confirm the flowsheet recoveries. It is the QP's opinion that there is sufficient data 

and test work to estimate metallurgical recoveries and define the flowsheet at a Feasibility Study Technical 

Report as required by NI 43-101 guidelines.  

12.6 Permitting and Environmental 

Data verification for permitting and environmental data included a detailed review of the existing EIA and 

permits. The QP obtained an English translation of these documents and produced a report summarizing 

the EIA and permit requirements, which was distributed to the other QPs as a reference. All other data 

related to permitting, water management and environment were reviewed in detail to ensure authenticity 

and are adequate for the Technical Report as required by NI 43-101 guidelines.

This section will only discuss the results used as the basis for the process design and recovery method 

presented in Section 17. This discussion will include a summary of the results from the BaseMet (2018) 

test program, as well as key historical test results related to comminution and solid / liquid separation. 

Based on the results from BaseMet (2018), gold and silver doré can be produced with a target primary grind 

size of 80% passing (P80) 50 µm followed by gravity concentration, a 48-hour cyanide leach, 6 hour carbon-

in-pulp (CIP) adsorption, desorption and refining process. For the Global Composite, this recovery method 

achieved precious metal recoveries of 96% Au and 85% Ag. 

13.2 Relevant Historical Test Work 

The following section summarizes the relevant historical test work results from the KCA (2012) test program 

that were used to help develop the process design and to size equipment. 

13.2.1 KCA (2012) Sample Selection 

In April 2011, KCA received six pallets from the Cerro Blanco Project. The pallets contained a total of 55 

cloth bags containing ½ split HQ and PQ core material from five samples. A portion from each sample was 

then utilized in the generation of a Master Composite. The amount of each individual sample utilized to 

generate the Master Composite was determined by Cerro Blanco personnel. The head assay results for 

each sample are summarized in Table 13-1.

13.2.2 Phillips Enterprises (2011) Comminution Results 

After bottle roll leach testing, portions of material from each of the individual samples were submitted to 

Phillips Enterprises LLC in Golden, Colorado for comminution testing. Test work was completed to 

determine the Bond ball mill and rod mill work indices for grinding specific energy calculations, and the 

Bond abrasion index for estimating grinding mill consumables. The results of the test work are summarized 

in Table 13-2. The averages from the five samples were used as the design criteria to size the primary and 

secondary ball mills and to estimate mill operating costs.

13.2.3 Pocock Industrial (2011) Solid / Liquid Separation Results 

Two bottle roll leach tests were conducted on a milled portion of the Master Composite material for 

solid/liquid separation test purposes. The combined tailings material was subject to detoxification and the 

slurry was packaged and submitted to Pocock Industrial, Inc. (Pocock) for detoxification analysis and 

solid/liquid separation analysis. KCA also delivered a "Fresh Milled" sample to Pocock that had not been 

leached. 

Solid/liquid separation tests were conducted on "Fresh Milled" and "Leached and Detoxed" samples 

delivered from KCA. The purpose for conducting the test work was to generate data for solid/liquid 

separation equipment design and sizing criteria. All testing was conducted by Pocock Industrial at their 

laboratory facility located in Salt Lake City, Utah during October 2011. 

The following are the key takeaways from the study that were used in the process design: 

 The minimum flocculant dose anticipated varied by individual sample and thickener type or 

application, but was in the overall range of 35 to 55 g/t for Fresh Milled and 30 to 55 g/t for Leached 

and Detoxed materials in the tested pH range, 

 For conventional thickener sizing, Pocock recommended a minimum unit area design basis of 0.30 

to 0.40 m²/tpd for the Fresh Milled, and 0.25 to 0.35 m²/tpd for the Leached and Detoxed material, 

 Dynamic thickening tests conducted on the samples indicated a hydraulic net feed loading rate 

design basis in the maximum range of 3.1 – 4.3 m³/m²·hr for both the Fresh Milled and Leached 

and Detoxed materials to achieve optimal performance, 

 The overall maximum underflow density range for the Leached and Detoxed material was 53 to 

57% based on fully sheared data (but this could be limited to 53 to 55% with rake torque 

considerations based on un-sheared data), and 

 Pressure filter testing for the Leached and Detoxed material based on a tonnage throughput of 

1,250 tpd indicates a minimum sizing requirement of about 190 chambers for a horizontal recess 

plate type press (with 1,500 mm plates, and 15 mm recess (30 mm full chamber)) with no cake 

wash to achieve 18.3% moisture (or 181 chambers to achieve 18.9% moisture with pH adjusted to 

10.5).

13.3 BaseMet (2018) Test Program Results 

The primary objective of the test program was to generate tailings from a bulk sample for downstream 

geotechnical and environmental studies. The bulk sample was separated into north and south areas of the 

deposit and prepared to create two bulk composites. Sub-samples from the north and south were tested 

using the optimized flowsheet to confirm gold and silver extractions. Limited process optimization test work 

was also conducted to further the understanding and optimization of the processing characteristics in 

support of this Feasibility Study.  

The study included sample preparation, interval assaying, gravity concentration, cyanide leach optimization 

and bulk cyanide leaching to produce material for continuous cyanide destruction test work. A single Global 

Composite was constructed from drill core intervals to carry out the gravity concentration, cyanide leach 

and cyanide destruction testing. 

13.3.1 Sample Selection 

Samples were received on April 6, 2018 by BaseMet in two forms. Approximately 90 kg arrived as cut drill 

core (1/4 and 1/2 core) and about 590 kg arrived as bulk rock. In total, 180 individual interval samples were 

received.  

The Global Composite was created using the individual drill core. The drill-core was initially inspected and 

weighed. Each interval was then individually stage crushed to a nominal 3.36 mm (6 mesh). The crushed 

material was blended, and a 250 g sample was riffled split and pulverized for subsequent assaying.  

A representative sub-sample of the Global Composite was removed during sample preparation and 

pulverized. The head assay results are shown in Table 13-3.

13.3.2 Gravity Concentration Results 

One-kilogram test charges were ground in a laboratory rod mill to three target P80 grind sizes of 50 µm, 75 

µm and 100 µm before passing through a laboratory Knelson MD-3 centrifugal gravity concentrator. 

Knelson concentrates were then panned to reject entrained gangue, targeting a 0.1% to 0.5% mass 

recovery. Gravity concentration results are presented in Table 13-4 and indicate moderate gravity 

recoverable gold. Gravity results follow the general trend of improving performance as the grind size is 

reduced from 100 µm to 50 µm with the test series average recovery of 19% Au. Based on these values, a 

gravity concentration circuit was included in the secondary ball mill circuit.

13.3.3 Bottle Roll Leach Results 

Leaching test work was carried out using two different methods. The first method used direct cyanide 

leaching on fresh milled product, the second on gravity tailings. All tests were completed in closed bottles 

on rolls, allowing constant agitation of the pulp as the sample leached for 72 hours. Cyanide levels, 

dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were monitored and controlled throughout each test. Kinetic sampling was 

done at 2, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours.  

The optimization test work focused on the effect of leach time, pre-oxidation, lead nitrate addition and 

primary grind size on gold recovery and leach kinetics. The results are summarized in Table 13-5.

A decrease in grind size was found to improve gold and silver recovery. As grind size decreased from a P80 

of 100 µm (Test #5) to a P80 of 50 µm (Test #4), gold and silver recovery improved by 4.2% and 9.7% 

respectively (72 h leach time). A P80 grind size of 50 µm was selected for design. Figure 13-1 shows gold 

extraction versus time at the different grind sizes.

The addition of lead nitrate may be effective at improving silver recovery, based on this sample. Tests 

completed at a P80 of 50 µm showed an increase in silver recovery from 78.6% (Test #11) to 88.4% (Test 

#17) with the addition of lead nitrate. But in contrast, tests completed at a P80 of 75 µm showed a decrease 

in silver recovery from 86.9% (Test #2) to 82.9% (Test #6) with the addition of lead nitrate. It is 

recommended that any future test work should explore the addition of lead nitrate. 

Pre-oxidation of the slurry with oxygen should be incorporated into the process design. Test #1 did not 

include pre-oxidation and resulted in a measured DO of below 1 ppm until after 6 hours of leaching. This 

had a significant impact on initial leach rates in the first 24 hours. When pre-oxidation was incorporated 

under similar conditions in Test #12, leach kinetics improved considerably. Two hours of pre-oxidation was 

incorporated into the process design.  

Tests were conducted using the optimized flowsheet and test work parameters to investigate gold and silver 

extraction at 40ºC, with site treated (CB-1), untreated site water (CB-2) and bulk rock sample composites 

from the North and South deposits. Gold extractions results ranged from 94 to 96% and silver between 77% 

and 92%. 

The general trend for all tests shows that there is minimal advantage to leaching after 48 hours. Considering 

the increased costs associated with leaching to 72 hours, a leach time of 48 hours was selected to ensure 

adequate gold and silver recovery. The gold extraction vs time curves are shown in Figure 13-2.

recovery for gold was 94.7% and 67.2% silver. Based on the results an additional three tests, CIP-25, 26 

and 27, were completed at 50 g/L carbon. Tests CIP-26 and CIP-27 included the addition of 250g/t lead 

nitrate. The three additional tests produced higher recoveries for both gold and silver. The addition of lead 

nitrate appears to improve silver leach kinetics and final recovery. The results and test work parameters 

from the four tests were used to develop the process design criteria and projected recoveries for the 

leach/CIP circuits. The recovery curves for gold and silver are illustrated in Figure 13-3 and Figure 13-4:

13.3.4 Cyanide Destruction Test Results 

Feed for the cyanide destruction test work was created from bulk leach tests. To determine cyanide species, 

a representative pulp sample was taken and filtered. The filtrate was then submitted for analysis. The 

cyanide solution from the produced pulp contained 283 mg/L total cyanide (CNT), 270 mg/L weak acid 

dissociable cyanide (CNWAD), 10.2 mg/L Fe, and 0.2 mg/L Zn. 

Continuous cyanide destruction test work was completed to produce a treated product using the SO2/Air 

process, targeting less than 5 mg/L CNWAD. A batch test (CND-B1) was conducted on the leached pulp to 

produce a starting pulp with a low residual CNWAD. A series of continuous cyanide destruction tests were 

then completed to establish the cyanide destruction circuit design criteria and understand the effect of 

reagent dosage on the oxidation of cyanide.  

The cyanide pulp produced during the test program responded well to the SO2/Air cyanide destruction 

process, producing a treated pulp with < 1 mg/L CNWAD and < 4 mg/L CNT. The results are shown in Table 

13-7. The conditions used in CND-C7 were incorporated into the process design for the cyanide destruction 

circuit.

13.4 Ore Sorting 

13.4.1 Phase I: Rock Inspection 

Approximately 30 to 50 rock samples representing ore, low grade ore and waste in the size range of 30 to 

60 mm were sent to Outotec in Germany. The rocks were tested with different sorting methods to determine 

if the gold bearing rocks could be identified and separated from the waste rocks. The tests observed a 

difference in the laser scatter pattern between the two different rock types, indicating amenability to ore 

sorting. Figure 13-5 below shows an example of the results from the laser sorter test work completed on 

the ore and waste rock samples. As seen in the processed laser images, the ore samples produced a 

distinct turquoise and white scatter pattern compared to the waste, which remained red.

13.4.2 Phase II: Bulk Sample Analysis 

A 3 tonne bulk sample taken from the underground workings representing the Cerro Blanco ore was sent 

to Outotec for performance test work. The material was screened into 4 size fractions and washed to provide 

a clean detection surface. The sample was separated into four size fractions: Mat 1 (35-60 mm), Mat 2 (25-

40 mm), Mat 3 (15-30 mm) and Mat 4 (8-15 mm). The three larger sizes were tested using a laser sorter 

and the smaller size fraction was tested using a colour sorter. 

Each Mat sample was fed continuously through the sorter. Once approximately half of the material in each 

size fraction was processed, the setting used to identify the percent of material representing the product 

was adjusted. Changing the setting allowed Outotec to evaluate how sensitive the laser needed to be to 

differentiate between product and waste. The best results were seen from laser Tests 1, 3 and 5 and colour 

sorting Test 9 for each of the Mat sizes. From the results gold recoveries of up to 94.4% were achieved to 

the product with 44.4% of the material rejected as waste. The gold grade of the waste is similar to what has 

been estimated in the resource model at ~0.5 g/t. The results of these tests are listed below in Table 13-8.

The results indicate laser sorting of the material in the 15 to 60 mm size fractions had high mass rejection 

with minimal gold losses. To evaluate this opportunity samples from the North and South areas of the 

deposit as well as variability samples will be tested to confirm the results and optimize the flowsheet. 

13.5 Relevant Results 

Based on the results from the BaseMet (2018) test program, the process flowsheet will include three stages 

of crushing followed by two stages of ball mill grinding to achieve a target grind size of P80 of 50 µm. The 

grinding circuit will be designed using a Bond ball mill work index of 19.9 kWh/t and a Bond abrasion index 

of 0.24 g. A gravity concentrator will be installed in the secondary ball mill circuit to collect any gravity 

recoverable gold.

Cyclone overflow from the secondary grinding circuit will then be subjected to pre-leach thickening to 

produce a solids content of 50% prior to leaching. A pre-oxidation stage will be used to oxidize the slurry 

for 2 hours before 48 hours of cyanide leaching at a target cyanide concentration of 500 ppm. The leached 

slurry will then flow through a carbon in pulp circuit to adsorb the gold and silver cyanide complexes onto 

the pores of activate carbon. The loaded carbon will be processed through desorption and refining circuits, 

while the leached slurry will be processed through a cyanide destruction circuit to reduce the CNWAD content 

to below 1 mg/L. The test conditions from BaseMet (2018) T-17 and T-26 were used to design the leach 

circuit, while the test conditions from BaseMet (2018) CND-C7 were used to design the cyanide destruction 

circuit. 

Preliminary estimates of gold and silver recovery are summarized in Table 13-9. Test Gr-CIP-21 was not 

included in the average for silver since there was insufficient carbon (25 g/L compared to 50 g/L) in solution 

to recover all the silver. These projections are based on the results from BaseMet's (2018) CIP test results. 

The economic results presented in Section 22 are based on an average Au recovery of 96% and Ag 

recovery of 85%.

14 Mineral Resource Estimate 

14.1 Introduction 

This section describes the work undertaken by Kirkham Geosystems Ltd. (Kirkham), including key 

assumptions and parameters used to prepare the mineral resource models for Cerro Blanco, together with 

appropriate commentary regarding the merits and possible limitations of such assumptions. 

Prior to its acquisition by Goldcorp, the Cerro Blanco deposit was initially explored as a low-grade bulk 

tonnage open-pitable deposit. Further drilling by Goldcorp better defined the potential of the high-grade 

vein mineralization beneath the Salinas silica cap, and subsequently permitted the deposit for a high-grade 

underground operation with the Guatemalan authorities. Goldcorp proceeded to develop underground ramp 

access which culminated in the >3km of underground infrastructure that was acquired with the project by 

Bluestone in 2017.  

The existence of an active mining permit was key in Bluestone's decision to continue to advance Cerro 

Blanco as a high-grade underground operation, the subject of this Feasibility Study, instead of an open pit 

that would require a new EIA and potentially push back the timeline to production.  

14.1.1 High Grade Underground Resource Estimate 

The Cerro Blanco deposit comprises over 50 individual veins distributed within two principal swarms (North 

Zone and South Zone), that extend over a strike length of 800 m. Over 90 percent of the current resource 

is distributed within 30 veins. Individual veins extend to depths greater than 450 m with variable dips 

averaging between 40 - 60 degrees. Principle feeder veins form the footwall of the deposit and trend broadly 

north-north easterly, with the more dominant north-easterly trending vein sets that appear to converge 

downwards into the master veins. 

The updated Mineral Resource Estimate incorporates more than 571 drill holes and 288 underground 

channel samples totaling 126,434 m. There is more than 1.2 Moz of gold and 4.53 Moz of silver contained 

in the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources. The project also contains more than 0.36 Moz of gold 

and 1.04 Moz of silver in the Inferred Mineral Resource category. The Mineral Resource Estimate for the 

Cerro Blanco deposit is reported at a base case above a 3.5 g/t Au cut-off, as tabulated below in Table 14-

1.

The mineral resource statement is subject to the following: 

• All Mineral Resources have been estimated in accordance with Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and Petroleum 
(CIM) definitions, as required under National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), with an effective date of September 10, 2018; 

• Mineral resources reported demonstrate reasonable prospect of eventual economic extraction, as required under NI 43-101. 
Mineral resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability; 

• Underground Mineral Resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 3.5 g/t Au. Cut-off grades are based on a price of 
US$1,250/oz gold, US$16/oz silver and a number of operating cost and recovery assumptions, plus a contingency;  

• Numbers are rounded; and 

• The Mineral Resources may be affected by subsequent assessment of mining, environmental, processing, permitting, taxation, 
socio-economic and other factors. 

14.1.2 Data 

The drill hole database was supplied in electronic format (i.e. MS Excel and Access) by Bluestone. This 

included collars, down hole surveys, lithology data and assay data (i.e. Au g/t, Ag g/t and down hole from 

and to intervals in metric units). Lithology data was provided as lithology group and description along with 

abbreviated alpha-numeric and numeric codes as described in Table 14-2.

The table above shows intervals that intersect the high grade which are primarily encountered within the Vt 

or code 70, as would be expected. The Vt unit has 1,608 assay intersections, with a total 1,796 m and 

average grade of 10.2 g/t Au and 43.3 g/t Ag. The coefficient of variation is relatively high with 2.7 for Au 

and 3.8 for Ag.

14.1.4 Geology Model 

A solid model of the vein zones within the Cerro Blanco deposit is shown in plan (Figure 14-1) and section 

(Figure 14-2). A comprehensive structural model was developed which incorporated the current drilling, 

underground sampling, mapping and extensive re-logging of drillcore. The revised models were created 

from first principals by Bluestone staff within LeapFrogTM under the supervision of the independent QP. This 

was done utilizing the current and re-logged data, and from sectional interpretations which were 

subsequently wireframed based on a combination of lithology and gold grades. 

Intersections were inspected and the solid was then manually adjusted to match the drill intercepts. Once 

the solid models were edited and complete, they were used to code the drill hole assays and composites 

for subsequent statistical and geostatistical analysis. The solid zones were utilized to constrain the block 

model, by matching assays to those within the zones. The orientation and ranges (distances) utilized for 

the search ellipsoids used in the estimation process were derived from the strike and dip of the mineralized 

zone.

The solids were coded into the composite database by priority, with the vein solids being highest, then the 

sinter unit and lastly the surrounding waste. 

14.1.5 Composites 

It was determined that the 1.5 m composite lengths offered the best balance between supplying common 

support for samples and minimizing the smoothing of the grades. Figure 14-3 shows a histogram illustrating 

the distribution of the assay interval lengths with 96% of the data having interval lengths greater than 1.5 

m. The 1.5 m sample length also was consistent with the distribution of sample lengths. It should be noted 

that although 1.5 m is the composite length, any residual composites of length greater than 0.75 m and less 

than 1.5 m remained to represent a composite, while any composites residuals less than 0.75 m were 

combined to the composite above.

Figure 14-6 and Figure 14-7 show the box plots and basic statistics for the grouped gold and silver 

composites, respectively. Table 14-4 and Table 14-5 show the basic statistics for the 1.5 m Au and Ag 

composite grades within the mineralized domains, respectively. There is a total of 4,625 composites or 

specifically 1,505 in the north and 3,120 in the south composites with the 25 veins in the north and 33 veins 

in the south. 

The weighted average Au grades for the north zone is 7.79 g/t and 6.79 g/t in the south zone with Coefficient 

of Variation (CV's) being between 2.2 and 2.7. Silver mean grades range from 28.6 g/t in the north and 31 

g/t in the south with CV's being between 2.3 to 4.2. CV's or variability is typically high for precious metal 

deposits primarily due to the nuggety nature particularly within epithermal veins; Grade limiting or cutting 

will further reduce the CV's. 

The box plots and statistics show that the mean gold grade is significantly higher in the north. However, the 

spread (i.e. SD or Standard Deviation) and therefore the variability (i.e. CV) are similar. On the other hand, 

the mean silver grades are similar from north to south but with variability significantly greater in the south. 

This may be due to significant outlier grades in the south which has a maximum composite value of 4,678 

g/t Ag.

14.1.6 Evaluation of Outlier Assay Values 

During the estimation process, the influence of outlier composites is controlled to limit their influence and 

to insure against over-estimation of metal content. In the case of the Au composites, values higher than 

110 g/t were cut, with those greater than 600 g/t for Ag cut as illustrated by the breaks in the cumulative 

frequency plots for each in Figure 14-8 and Figure 14-9, respectively.

Table 14-6 show the effects of cutting the outlier grades to the level recommended above. This shows that 

the average gold and silver grades are reduced by 5% and 7%, respectively. In addition, the variability or 

CV is significantly reduced for gold and silver at the respective 110 g/t and 600 g/t cut thresholds by 17% 

and 33%. Further improvements have very limited effect confirming that the level of cutting is adequate.

Table 14-7 shows the specific gravity (SG) assignment by zone using 299 individual measurements using 

standard water displacement methods. The SG assigned for the veins is determined to 2.59, which is 

derived from 63 measurements. It is recommended that future work programs should continue to include 

SG measurements to expand the density distributions.

14.1.8 Variography 

Experimental variograms and variogram models in the form of correlograms were generated for Au and Ag 

grades. The definition of nugget value was derived from the downhole variograms. The correlograms for 

gold and silver within the South and North Zones are shown in Figure 14-10 through Figure 14-13, 

respectively whilst Figure 14-14 shows the correlogram model for waste grades. These variogram models 

were used for the estimation of Au and Ag grades which employed ordinary kriging as the interpolator.

14.1.9 Block Model Definition 

The block model used for estimating the resources was defined according to the origin and orientation as 

shown in Figure 14-15 and the limits specified in Figure 14-16. The block model employs sub-blocking for 

ease of mine planning and is orthogonal and rotated 20° from 0° azimuth, roughly reflecting the orientation 

of the north and the south vein sets within the deposit. The block size chosen was 5 m by 5 m by 1 m and 

using a sub-block size of 1 m by 1 m by 0.1 m. Note that MineSight™ uses the centroid of the blocks as 

the origin.

14.1.10 Resource Estimation Methodology 

The estimation plan includes the following items: 

 Mineralized zone code of modelled mineralization stored in each block; 

 Estimated SG based on rock type code; 

 Estimated block Au and Ag grades by ordinary kriging;  

 Estimated Au and Ag waste grades; and 

 One pass estimation for each individual vein. 

A minimum of two composites and maximum of 16 composites and a maximum of three composites per 

hole were informed to estimate block grades. Following Herco analysis, it was determined that the gold 

estimates in the South appeared to be over-smoothed so for many of the veins in the south the maximum 

number of composites informed was adjusted to eight. 

For the vein domain domains that make up the Cerro Blanco deposit, the search ellipsoids are omni-

directional to a maximum of 100 m and hard boundaries were used so that the veins are tightly constrained. 

14.1.11 Resource Validation 

A graphical validation was done on the block model. The purpose of this graphical validation is to: 

 Check the reasonableness of the estimated grades, based on the estimation plan and the nearby 

composites; 

 Check the general drift and the local grade trends, compared to the drift and local grade trends of 

the composites; 

 Ensure that all blocks in the core of the deposit have been estimated;

Page 14-20 

 

 Check that topography has been properly accounted for; 

 Check against partial model to determine reasonableness; 

 Check against manual approximate estimates of tonnage to determine reasonableness; and 

 Inspect and explain potentially high-grade block estimates in the neighbourhood of extremely high 

assays. 

A full set of cross sections, long sections and plans were used to check the block model on the computer 

screen, showing the block grades and the composites. No evidence of any block being wrongly estimated 

was found; it appears that every block grade could be explained as a function of the surrounding composites 

and the estimation plan applied. 

These validation techniques included the following: 

 Visual inspections on a section-by-section and plan-by-plan basis; 

 The use of grade-tonnage curves; 

 Swath Plots comparing Kriged estimated block grades with Inverse Distance and Nearest 

Neighbour estimates;  

 An inspection of histograms of distance of the first composite to the nearest block, and the average 

distance to blocks for all composites used, which gives a quantitative measure of confidence that 

blocks are adequately informed in addition to assisting in the classification of resources; and 

 Validation of the sub-block models was also performed by estimating the resources within the vein 

domains using partial block where the vein solids were coded as a percentage within the blocks. 

The results showed excellent agreement with the sub-block model results both on a global and on 

an individual block basis. 

14.1.12 Mineral Resource Classification 

Mineral resources were estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral 

Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practices" Guidelines (2003). Mineral resources are not Mineral 

Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

The Mineral Resources may be impacted by further infill and exploration drilling that may result in an 

increase or decrease in future resource evaluations. The Mineral Resources may also be affected by 

subsequent assessment of mining, environmental, processing, permitting, taxation, socio-economic and 

other factors. 

Mineral Resources for the Cerro Blanco deposit were classified according to the CIM Definition Standards 

for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (2014) by Garth Kirkham, P.Geo. of Kirkham Geosystems 

Ltd. (Kirkham), an "Independent Qualified Person" as defined by National Instrument 43-101. 

Drill hole spacing is sufficient for preliminary geostatistical analysis and evaluating spatial grade variability. 

Kirkham is therefore of the opinion that the amount of sample data is adequate to demonstrate very good 

confidence of the grade estimates in the deposit. 

The estimated blocks were classified according to: 



 

 

CERRO BLANCO PROJECT 
FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 

Prepared by JDS ENERGY & MINING INC. 

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 14-21 

 

 Confidence in interpretation of the mineralized zones; 

 Number of composites used to estimate a block; 

 Number of composites allowed per drill hole; 

 Distance to nearest composite used to estimate a block; and 

 Average distance to the composites used to estimate a block. 

The classification of resources was based primarily upon distance to the nearest composite; however, all 

of the quantitative measures, as listed above, were inspected and taken into consideration. 

The spatial variation pattern of gold in the Cerro Blanco deposit can be represented by a variogram or 

correlogram. Using the variogram and the drill hole spacing the reliability of estimated grades in large 

volumes can be predicted. The measure of estimation reliability or uncertainty is expressed by the width of 

a confidence interval or the confidence limits. Then by knowing how reliably metal content must be 

estimated to adequately undertake mine planning, it is possible to calculate the drill hole spacing necessary 

to achieve the target level of reliability. For instance, indicated resources may be adequate for planning in 

most pre-feasibility and production work.  

Confidence intervals are intended to estimate the reliability of estimation for different volumes and drill hole 

spacing. A narrower interval implies a more reliable estimate. The study is based on the ideas outlined in 

the next several paragraphs. Using hypothetical regular drill spacing and the variograms from the 

composited drill hole sample data, confidence intervals or limits can be estimated for different drill hole 

spacing and production periods or equivalent volumes. The confidence limits for 90% relative confidence 

intervals should be interpreted as follows: 

If the limit is given as 8%, then there is a 90 percent chance the actual value (tonnes and 

grade) of production is within ±8% of the estimated value over a quarterly or annual 

production volume. This means it is unlikely the true value will be more than 8 percent 

different relative to the estimated value (either high or low) over the given production 

period. 

The method of estimating confidence intervals is an approximate method that has been shown to perform 

well when the volume being predicted from samples is sufficiently large (Davis, B. M., Some Methods of 

Producing Interval Estimates for Global and Local Resources, SME Preprint 97-5, 4p.) At Cerro Blanco, the 

smallest appropriate production volume is considered to be about one year. Using these guidelines, an 

idealized block configured to approximate the volume produced in one month is estimated by ordinary 

kriging using the idealized spacing of samples.  

Relative variograms are used in the estimation of the block. (Relative variograms are used rather than 

ordinary variograms because the standard deviations from the kriging variances are expressed directly in 

terms of a relative percentage). 

There are twelve monthly production volumes. Assuming approximate independence from month to month 

the formula for the variance of the mean is σ2/N where N = 12 in this case. 

The kriging variances from the ideal blocks and spacing are divided by twelve (assuming approximate 

independence in the production from month to month) to get a variance for yearly ore output. The square 

root of this kriging variance is then used to construct confidence limits under the assumption of normally

Page 14-22 

 

distributed errors of estimation. For example, if the kriging variance for a block is Σ2m then the kriging 

variance for a year is Σ2y = Σ2m/12. The 90 percent confidence limits are then C.L. = ±1.645 x Σy. 

The relative ordinary kriging variance is achieved by scaling the correlogram to the declustered relative 

variance of the composite distribution. The total relative variance can be estimated by squaring the 

declustered coefficient of variation (declustered standard deviation divided by the declustered mean) 

calculated from the composite samples.  

The confidence limits for a given production rate are a function of the spatial variation of the data and the 

sample or drill hole spacing. 

For this exercise, the drill hole spacing test uses 50 m, 25 m and 12.5 m.  

Further assumptions made for the confidence interval calculations are: 

 The variograms are appropriate representations of the spatial variability for presence of 

mineralization and metal grade. 

 The monthly production is approximately 10,000 tonnes. 

 Most of the uncertainty in metal production within the veins is due to the fluctuation of gold grades 

and vein thickness not to variation in the presence or absence of the unit. 

The red curve in Figure 14-17 shows a graphical representation of how the uncertainty decreases with 

decreasing drill hole spacing. In general, the curve shows that sampling at roughly 30 m spacing will 

produce uncertainty for the year slightly greater than ±20% at the designated production rate. The curves 

above and below the base case give an idea how the uncertainty changes with either slightly improved 

(lower curve) or slightly worse (upper curve) continuity in grade and thickness.

In addition to the uncertainty estimate, indicator variograms show continuity of grade extends horizontally 

along strike for over 25 m, essentially supporting the results described above.  

Typically, resource categories are based on the following criteria; Indicated resources must be estimated 

so the uncertainty of yearly production is no greater than ±15% with 90% confidence and Measured 

resources must be estimated so the uncertainty of quarterly production is no greater than ±15% with 90% 

confidence. The results presented above indicate the reliability is around ±15% for the assumed production 

rate at roughly 25 m spacing. 

It should also be noted that the confidence limits only consider the variability of grade within the deposit. 

There may be other aspects of deposit geology and geometry as such as geological contacts or the 

presence of faults or offsetting structures that may impact the drill spacing (see the recommendations for 

classification below). These factors should not be discounted or ignored when making a final choice 

concerning drill locations. 

The following lists the spacing for each resource category to classify the resources assuming the current 

rate of metal production:

 Measured: Note that based on the CIM definitions, continuity must be demonstrated in the 

designation of Measured (and Indicated) resources. For the Cerro Blanco underground, the 

greatest continuity and confidence is along the extensive underground ramps and access. 

Therefore, measured resources were determined to be within 15 m both vertically and horizontally 

from vein exposures within the ramp and access. 

 Indicated: Resources in this category would be delineated from at least three drill holes spaced on 

a nominal 30 m pattern. 

 Inferred: Any material not falling in the categories above and within a maximum 75 m of one hole. 

To ensure continuity, the boundary between the Indicated and Inferred categories was contoured and 

smoothed, eliminating outliers and orphan blocks. The spacing distances are intended to define contiguous 

volumes and they should allow for some irregularities due to actual drill hole placement. The final 

classification volume results typically must be adjusted manually to come to a coherent classification 

scheme. 

The suggested classification parameters are roughly consistent with the past classification scheme. 

Classification in future models may differ, but principal differences should be due to changes in the amount 

of drilling. 

14.1.13 Sensitivity of the Block Model to Selection Cut-off Grade 

The Mineral Resources are sensitive to the selection of cut-off grade. Table 14-8 shows tonnage and grade 

in the Cerro Blanco deposit, at different Au cut-off grades. The reader is cautioned that these values should 

not be misconstrued as a mineral reserve. The reported quantities and grades are only presented as a 

sensitivity of the resource model to the selection of cut-off grade. Au and Ag grade-tonnage curves for 

different resource categories are presented in Figure 14-18 and Figure 14-19. Figure 14-20 through Figure 

14-23 show section views of the block model with drill holes and estimation domains for Au and Ag, 

respectively. Figure 14-24 through Figure 14-27 show long section views of the Au and Ag block models 

for the North and South Zones, respectively.

14.1.14 Comparison to 2017 Resource Estimation 

The following is a comparison between the previous resource estimate performed in January 2017 and the 

current estimate as stated within this report. Table 14-9 shows the total indicated resources stated in 2017 

are relatively unchanged compared to the current combined measured and indicated resources stated 

herein. However, inferred resources have increased substantially between the two estimates. 

The extensive 2017-2018 drilling campaign also included a comprehensive underground mapping and 

sampling program; these are the reasons for the significant increases in inferred resources. These activities 

were focused on developing a better understanding of geology and structure, more accurately defining the 

mineralized veins both in the north and the south, revising the models and domains, targeting of additional 

indicated and inferred resources in addition to allowing for the definition of measured resources.

14.1.15 Stockpile Resources 

Ore from mining activities undertaken to date at Cerro Blanco, including ramp development and access, 

has been stockpiled on-site and segregated for future processing. This material may be considered for 

inclusion within the initial years of mine production or within the ramp-up phase. However, this requires an 

accurate representation of the volumes and grades so a comprehensive sampling program was designed 

and implemented. The stockpile surfaces were surveyed to accurately determine volumes and the sampling

program entailed excavating trenches on 20 m grid lines and 2 m sample intervals as shown in Figure 14-

28. 

Correlograms for gold (Au) and silver (Ag) were created and employed to estimate the stockpile resources 

using ordinary kriging. The estimate was validated using nearest neighbor and inverse distance, illustrating 

good agreement of results.

15 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource 

demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study (CIM, 2010). This Feasibility Study contains 

adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 

demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified. 

Mineral Reserves are those parts of Mineral Resources, which, after the application of all mining factors, 

result in an estimated tonnage and grade that form the basis of an economically viable project. Mineral 

Reserves are inclusive of diluting material that will be mined in conjunction with the economic mineralized 

rock and delivered to the process plant or equivalent facility. The term "Mineral Reserve" need not 

necessarily signify that extraction facilities are in place, or operative, or that all governmental approvals 

have been received. It does signify that there are reasonable expectations of such approvals. 

Mineral Reserves are subdivided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Mineral Reserves and 

Proven Mineral Reserves; a Probable Mineral Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proven 

Mineral Reserve. The reserve classifications used in this report conform to the Canadian Institute of Mining, 

Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) classification of NI 43-101 resource and reserve definitions and 

Companion Policy 43-101CP. These are listed below:  

A "Proven Mineral Reserve" is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral 

Resource demonstrated by at least a PFS. This Study must include adequate information 

on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 

demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified. Application of 

the Proven Mineral Reserve category implies that the QP has the highest degree of 

confidence in the estimate with the consequent expectation in the minds of the readers of 

the report. The term should be restricted to that part of the deposit where production 

planning is taking place and for which any variation in the estimate would not significantly 

affect potential economic viability. 

A "Probable Mineral Reserve" is the economically mineable part of an Indicated Mineral 

Resource, and in some circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource, demonstrated by at 

least a PFS. The study must include adequate information on mining, processing, 

metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of 

reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. 

15.1 Cut-off Grade Criteria 

Mining reserve values were calculated from resource block model tonnes and grades to define a gold (Au) 

cut-off grade (COG) to determine the mineable portions of the Cerro Blanco deposit. Mineable longhole 

and resue cut and fill stopes were defined based on COG values greater than 3.5 g/t Au after dilution and 

mining recoveries are applied. Some lower value or incremental material, less than 3.5 g/t Au, is also 

included in the mining reserve and accounts for approximately 10% of the total mineral reserve. The 

incremental material is predominately development ore that had to be excavated to mine the stope in its 

vicinity and has adequate ore value for paying processing and general and administration (G&A) operating 

costs.

Note: Assumptions stated in this table were used to establish mining cut-off grades only. 

15.2 Dilution 

Three types of dilution were applied to the stope and development designs: 

 External dilution – Additional material (overbreak) that is mined outside of the mineralized vein. 

Average external dilution grades are applied to this material. 

 Backfill dilution – run of mine (ROM) waste, cemented rock fill (CRF) and/or paste back fill expected 

to fall into the stope being mined from adjacent stopes and/or inadvertently scraped off the stope 

floors during mucking. This material is considered zero grade dilution, and 

 Design and/or internal dilution – Additional, lower than COG material within the planned stope or 

development design shape. Grades for internal dilution are taken from the mineral resource model. 

Additional sources of dilution include Inferred Resource. Any Inferred Resource class material within the 

mining reserve stope and development shapes has been treated as waste and has been assigned zero 

metal grades. Inferred dilution comprises approximately 48 kt or 1.4% of the reserve. The total external, 

backfill, planned and Inferred dilution is approximately 39% of the total mining reserve. 

15.2.1 External Dilution 

External dilution estimates have been defined by geotechnical rock mass domains, stope strike length and 

dip, and mining method. The dilution estimates are based on the Equivalent Linear Overbreak / Slough 

(ELOS) method. 

Geotechnical rock mass domains have been defined by JDS for each mineralized vein and based on rock 

conditions, and not only lithology. The rock mass domains are: 

 Domain 1: Upper lithological units that are poor geo-mechanical quality with heavy fracturing and 

relatively weak intact rock strengths, 

 Domain 2: Middle lithological units that typically demonstrates significantly less fracturing and 

higher intact rock strengths compared to Domain 1, and 

 Domain 3: Lower lithological units stratigraphically below Domain 2 that is typically of good geo-

mechanical quality with significantly less fracturing and higher intact rock strengths.

Cut and fill and sub-level development are completed by resue mining, where ore and waste are mined 

separately to minimize dilution from the development. Resue mining is described in Section 16.5.3. Dilution 

estimates for cut and fill and development are based on a 1.0 m minimum ore mining width and is 

summarized in Table 15-4.

Average external dilution grades were taken from the block model and included in the average grades for 

the stope shape. The average external dilution grade is 0.7 g/t Au and 5 g/t Ag. External dilution averages 

17% of the total mineral reserve. Average dilution for longitudinal longhole, transverse longhole, and cut 

and fill stoping is 25%, 17%, and 11% respectively. 

15.2.2 Backfill Dilution 

Backfill dilution is summarized by mining method in Table 15-5 and carries no gold or silver grades.

Backfill dilution averages 4% of the total mineral reserve estimate. 

15.2.3 Design or Internal Dilution 

Planned or internal dilution is lower than COG material within the planned stope or development design 

shape. Grades for internal dilution are taken from the mineral resource model. Design dilution averages 

17% of the total mineral reserve. 

15.3 Mining Recovery 

Mining or extraction recovery is a function of mineralized material left behind due to operational constraints 

typical in the mining process. The longhole mining method is largely dependent on the accuracy of longhole 

drilling and explosive detonation to properly fracture the ore. Where holes deviate from the ore limits, some 

material will remain hung up and may never report to the stope floor for recovery. Lesser factors considered 

to affect recoveries in longhole mining include uneven mucking floors, limited visibility for remote mucking, 

and operator error. A mining recovery of 95% based on industry norms, as well as JDS operational 

experience in stopes and drifts of similar size and dip, has been applied to all mining and ore development 

tonnes. 

15.4 Mineral Reserve Estimate 

The mining stope and sub-level designs with external, backfill and planned dilution along with mining 

recovery factor applied, determined the Mineral Reserve estimate shown in Table 15-6 and Table 15-7.

16 Mining Methods 

16.1 Introduction 

The mine design and planning for Cerro Blanco is based on the resource model completed by Kirkham 

Geosystems Ltd. in 2018, as detailed in Section 14 of this report. Two underground mining methods were 

selected for Cerro Blanco: sub-level longhole open stoping (LH) and mechanized cut -and-fill (MCF). Mining 

method selection was driven primarily by geotechnical rock quality, vein geometry and continuity. Unless 

geotechnical and geometry characteristics required MCF, longhole mining was the preferred mining method 

due to higher productivities and lower mining costs when compared to MCF. 

16.2 Deposit Characteristics 

High-grade mineralization at the Cerro Blanco deposit is in the form of laterally stacked sub-parallel narrow 

veins which generally strike to the northeast at an average azimuth of 25° to 50°. Veins range in dip with 

some tabular structures and others near vertical, however, the average dip values of high-grade vein 

mineralization is 50° to 55°. The average vein width is 1.9 m with average parallel spacing of 8 m. 

Perpendicular to strike, the deposit is approximately 250 m wide. The deposit contains upwards of 50 

modeled veins with variable geometry along strike and dip. 

Mineralization is centralized in two main zones, the North and the South. Both zones show similar vein 

geometry and spacing. The South zone contains more veins by volume and descends to lower elevations 

than the North. The total strike length of the North and South zones is approximately 800 m. High grade 

mineralization occurs from 540 masl to 180 masl. More than 50% of all mineralization occurs between 400 

masl and 480 masl. Generally, lower grade mineralization surrounds the higher-grade lenses.  

16.3 Geotechnical Analysis and Recommendations 

16.3.1 Geotechnical Characterization 

A geotechnical investigation was carried out by Golder in 2011 and 2012 to characterize rock mass 

conditions in support of underground mine design for a 2012 unpublished FS. A combined total of 16 core 

holes were drilled through the deposit and geotechnically logged and sampled for laboratory strength testing 

as part of the program. Point load testing was also conducted on core retrieved from the geotechnical drill 

holes. The original geotechnical database was provided by Golder for incorporation into the current FS. 

JDS has spot checked the database against the respective core photographs for internal data consistency 

and considers the data to be suitable for a feasibility level of study.  

In addition to the previous 2011/2012 geotechnical dataset, JDS also geotechnically logged two recent 

(2018) resource drillholes and carried out geotechnical face mapping at 15 stations within the existing 

development.  

Overall the following information was used to base geotechnical assessments in the current FS: 

 Resource drillhole database with RQD and core recovery data; 

 Core photographs for most resource and geotechnical drillholes;

 Detailed geotechnical logging for 16 holes by Cerro Blanco under Golder Associates training and 

review (2011/2012); 

 Field point load testing of core from 43 holes (total of 1,519 tests) during the 2011/2012 program;  

 Laboratory strength testing for two programs (2011 and 2018) including UCS, Brazilian tensile 

strength and elastic properties; 

 Oriented core for 4 holes in South Zone and one in North Zone (2018); 

 Geotechnical mapping by JDS at 15 locations in existing development (2018); 

 Geotechnical logging of 2 recent resource drillholes by JDS (2018); and 

 3D lithologic and geologic structural models prepared by SGM (2018). 

16.3.2 Geotechnical Domains and Rock Mass Properties 

Based on the geologic structural and lithology models and the geotechnical characterization data described 

above, the deposit was divided into three separate geotechnical domains. Each of the domains grouped 

area of similar anticipated ground conditions and overall rock mass quality which were then used to develop 

geotechnical design parameters. Geologic structure and lithology were identified as the dominant factors 

controlling rock quality domains. The three geotechnical domains are shown on an E-W cross section in 

Figure 16-1 and summarized below. Table 16-1 contains a summary of the key rock mass properties 

derived from the 2011/2012 geotechnical core logging data. The data in Table 16-1 represent the average 

value of all the core runs drilled within the respective domains. Local variations will occur but the values 

presented are expected to be representative of the overall rock mass behavior. 

Domain 1: consists of the upper lithological units of the deposit which include the Upper Mbt and Lower 

Svc. These units are finer grained clastic rocks and typically have more closely spaced fractures. The 

Salinas Conglomerate (Scgl) covering the South Zone of the deposit is also included in the Domain 1 due 

to its very strong clay alteration.  

In addition to the upper lithological units, a large wedge of poor rock quality defined by the Upper Mbt Fault 

and the Ramp Fault is also included within Domain 1. The units within this block have been downthrown a 

large distance along the faults which caused significant distortion of bedding and intense fracturing in areas. 

Domain 1 is typically of poor geomechanical quality with heavy fracturing and relatively weak intact rock 

strengths. The mean intact rock strength is 71 MPa based on the converted PLT dataset with a mean rock 

mass rating (RMR) of 50 which is in the 'Fair' rock mass quality according to the Bieniawski (1976) 

classification system. The mean Q' for domain 1.9 which classifies as 'Poor' rock mass quality based on 

the Barton (1974) classification system. Five underground stations mapped for geotechnical data indicated 

RMR76 values between 42 and 69 with a mean value of 53 ('Fair' rock quality) according to Bieniawski 

(1976) system and Barton's Q' values ranging between 0.8 and 7.8 with a mean value of 2.4 ('Poor' rock 

quality). 

Domain 2: consists of the middle lithological units of the deposit: Mat, Lower Mbt and breccias. The domain 

also includes two sandstone lenses Mss-Qtz and Mss-Poly that lie above the Mat unit and below the Lower 

Mbt, respectively.

Page 16-3 

 

Domain 2 typically demonstrates significantly less fracturing and higher intact rock strengths compared to 

Domain 1. The mean intact rock strength is 78 MPa based on the converted PLT dataset with a mean RMR 

of 58 which is considered 'Fair' geomechanical quality according to the Bieniawski (1976) system. The 

mean Q' for domain 4.7 which classifies as 'Fair' rock mass quality based on Barton's (1974) classification 

system. Four underground stations mapped for geotechnical data indicated RMR76 values between 55 and 

81 with a mean value of 65 ('Good' rock quality) according to Bieniawski (1976) system and Barton's Q' 

values between 3.1 and 33 with a mean value of 6.6 ('Fair' rock quality). 

Domain 3: defined as the lower rock units, stratigraphically below Domain 2 which include the Mls, Mcv, 

and Mvo as well as the sandstone lens (Mss-Mcv) between the Mls and Mcv. The Salinas Conglomerate 

(Scgl) covering the South Zone of the deposit may also be included in Domain 3 because it has been 

strongly silicified. 

Domain 3 is typically of good geomechanical quality with significantly less fracturing and higher intact rock 

strengths. The mean intact rock strength is 93 MPa based on the converted PLT dataset with some 

laboratory test values as high as 233 MPa. Such high or outlier UCS tests were likely conducted on samples 

with exceptionally high silica. Domain 3 has a mean RMR76 of 66 which is considered 'Good' geomechanical 

quality according to the Bieniawski (1976) rock mass classification system. The mean Q' for Domain 3 is 

12 which also classifies as 'Good' rock mass quality based on Barton's (1974) classification system. No 

exposures have been developed yet for underground mapping in Domain 3.

4 Q' calculated from RMR76' values using Bieniawski's 1989 equation (Q' = e [RMR76 – 44]/9). 

The 2011/2012 geotechnical logging was done only according to the RMR76 (Bieniawski, 1976) format 

requiring that a conversion be made to Q' (Barton, 1974) which is necessary for stope and ground support 

design. An equation developed by Barton (1979) was used to estimate Q' values from the RMR76 values. 

The conversion Q' to/from RMR using an equation is generally not preferred over collecting the necessary 

information for each system independently and may not be applicable for all rock masses. However, the 

equation was validated for the Cerro Blanco rock mass by comparing the Q' and RMR76 values collected 

independently by JDS during the underground geotechnical mapping program (Figure 16-2). In addition 

JDS geotechnically logged 2 recent (2018) resource drillholes and confirmed similar Q' data for Domains 1 

and 2 compared to the converted 2011/2012 data.

16.3.3 In-situ Stresses 

The magnitude and direction of in-situ stresses in the Cerro Blanco Project area have not been directly 

measured. As such, stress conditions have been estimated based on regional geologic information and site 

topographic features. Based on a review of the World Stress Map (Heidbach, et al, 2016), the maximum 

horizontal stress may be oriented perpendicular to the vein strike. The World Stress Map maximum 

horizontal stress (1) estimates nearest Cerro Blanco area were calculated from single focal mechanism 

earthquake events and were rated as 'C' quality (+/- 25° accuracy). The closest focal source indicated a 

strike slip regime with several other sources in the area indicating normal faulting. Both the normal fault and 

strike slip regimes indicate 1 oriented towards approximately 345° azimuth.  

It is assumed that the maximum horizontal stress magnitude is relatively low given the shallow (200 to 300 

m bgs) depth of the planned stoping areas. No observations have been made underground indicating high 

horizontal stress conditions.  

It has been conservatively assumed that the ratio of maximum horizontal stress (H) to vertical stress (v) 

is approximately 1.5 to 2 with the maximum horizontal stress oriented parallel to the vein strike. The 

minimum horizontal stress (h) has been assumed to be approximately 0.5 to 1 times vertical stress (v). 

The anticipated range of stresses has been considered in the calculation of stress parameter A for stope 

design as discussed below. Horizontal stresses may need to be assessed in more detail during operation.

16.3.4 Empirical Stope Design Analysis 

Empirical stope design analyses are based on stability graphs where the stability number (N') is plotted on 

the vertical axis against the hydraulic radius (wall area divided by wall perimeter) of the stope face on the 

horizontal axis. The stability number is calculated based on the rock mass quality (Q'), and three empirical 

factors: A (induced stress conditions), B (geologic structure orientation) and C (dip angle of the stope face). 

Maximum stope dimensions were estimated using the Potvin (2001) method for the anticipated range of 

rock mass conditions and stope sizes. The Trueman & Mawdesley (2003) 'Stable' line was then used as a 

check against the Potvin (2001) results. Upper and lower bound estimates of stope face dimensions and 

rock quality (Q') were analyzed for each of the three geotechnical domains. Table 16-2 contains a summary 

of the upper and lower bound estimates of rock mass quality (RMR76 and Q') for each domain.

1 Q' calculated from RMR76' values using Bieniawski's 1989 equation (Q' = e [RMR76 – 44]/9). 

Empirical factors for the calculation of stability number (N') were based on the following assumptions:  

 Induced stress parameter, A equal to 1 given the relatively strong UCS (70 to 100 MPa) and low 

anticipated horizontal stress given the shallow depth of the stoping areas (200 to 300 m bgs); 

 Joint orientation factor, B equal to 0.3 for the hanging wall and footwall based on the dominant 

discontinuity orientation beings sub-parallel to veins; and 

 Gravity factor, C equal to 3.8 for the hanging wall corresponding to a dip angle of 45º and C equal 

to 2.0 for stope backs corresponding to a flat back. 

The maximum level spacing was set at 20 m and the maximum stable lengths and widths were then 

determined from the stability graph for the hanging walls and backs, respectively. When evaluating hanging 

walls with the 45º dip, the hydraulic radii were calculated assuming a stope height of 28 m equivalent to the 

true diagonal distance between the top and bottom cuts. Figures 16-3, 16-4 and 16-5 contain example 

output from the empirical stability analyses for Domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 

Based on the results of the empirical stope stability analyses, the following conclusions were made based 

on the empirical stability analyses: 

 Domain 1:  

o Cut and fill stopes can be mined 4 m high by 4 to 8 m wide and 150 m long. 

 Domain 2: 

o Stopes can be up to 8 m wide without the use of cable bolts for longitudinal mining;

o The maximum stable length for longitudinal stopes is 17.5 m for a 45º hanging wall dip; and 

o Transverse stopes greater than 8 m in width will require cable bolts installed from the top 

cuts. 

 Domain 3; 

o Longitudinal stopes can be up to 15 m wide without the use of cable bolts; 

o The maximum stable length for longitudinal stopes is 22.5 m for a 45º hanging wall dip; and 

o Transverse stopes greater than 8 m in width will require cable bolts installed from the top cuts.

16.3.5 Estimates of Unplanned Dilution 

The potential for unplanned dilution was estimated for stope hanging walls and footwalls using the 

equivalent linear overbreak/slough (ELOS) method developed by Clark (1998). The method is similar to the 

empirical stope stability charts previously discussed with Stability Number (N') plotted on the vertical axis 

and the hydraulic radius (wall area divided by wall perimeter) of the stope face on the x axis but rather than 

showing stable/unstable conditions, the plot contains contours of unplanned dilution. The estimates are 

approximated in terms of the average thickness spread over the entire hanging wall or footwall. 

The ELOS graph is not applicable to small hydraulic radii (<4). For small hydraulic radii such as these, 

blasting quality will be the primary control on dilution. Unplanned dilution estimated for Domain 1 and cut 

and fill areas within Domains 2 and 3 will be controlled primarily by blasting practices and as such, has 

been estimated based on anticipated blasting and excavation practices for those areas. ELOS estimates 

for Domain 2 and 3 long hole stopes are summarized in Table 16-3 along with dilution assumptions made 

for the cut and fill stopes.  

Dilution estimates used for longitudinal LH stopes were increased from transverse LH stope dilution 

estimates.

16.3.6 Stope Sequencing 

To reduce potential stress impacts on mining should stresses be higher than anticipated, stopes should be 

sequenced to direct stresses away from the central mining areas and toward outer abutments. Stopes are 

mined in a hanging wall to footwall retreat sequence to cut-off, or divert, stresses away from the remaining 

stopes on the level. Retreat sequences also present the lowest risk of waste lens pillars failing and 

increasing dilution for transverse LH stopes. 

16.3.7 Backfill Strength Requirements 

Stopes are planned to be backfilled with cemented paste backfill that will provide confinement on the stope 

walls and waste rock pillars left between parallel closely-spaced veins in some of the longer transverse 

stope. The use of cemented backfill also enables secondary stopes to be mined up against backfilled 

primary stopes without having to leave a rib pillar. 

Requirements for cemented paste backfill UCS strength were developed analytically for various stope 

widths using the simplified wedge analysis originally developed by Mitchell (1983). Results of the analysis 

are summarized in Table 16-4 for a stope height of 25 m and assuming a 2.0 safety factor. A factor of safety 

of 2.0 is conservative compared to some operating mines but is considered appropriate for the feasibility 

level of study. It may be possible to reduce the safety factor to 1.5 or 1.3 during operation once specific 

experience with the site materials has been gained.  

Numerical stress modeling could be advantageous at a later stage during mining when more detailed 

backfill and rock mass information is available; however detailed modeling of backfill is not recommended 

at the current level of study.

16.3.8 Ground Support 

Based on the range of anticipated rock quality (Q' values) as well as the size and expected life and use of 

the various mine openings, ground support requirements were initially assessed according to the Barton & 

Grimstad (1994) criteria. The Q-system also accounts for the life and use of the opening (ex. man-entry or 

equipment only) with the excavation support ratio (ESR) parameter. The ESR is used to adjust the design 

span, in order to obtain the equivalent span for use in the Q Support Diagram; in effect, it imposes a higher 

factor of safety on critical structures with long life (such as an underground nuclear power station with an 

ESR rating of 0.5 to 0.8) than on temporary tunnels (such as temporary mine workings with an ESR rating 

of 2 to 5). An ESR of 1.6 was used for permanent development and man-entry ore development with 

temporary, non-entry ore development assessed assuming an ESR of 3.  

Based on the Barton & Grimstad (1994) criteria, the temporary ore development and nearly all of the 

permanent development will only require spot bolting for the openings to remain open. However, pattern 

bolting with welded wire mesh is recommended to control loose material for all development where miners 

will be working. 

Resin bolts were initially considered for permanent development; however, manufacturers expressed 

concern over the structural integrity of the resin over time due to the sustained high ground temperatures 

at Cerro Blanco. Instead, Swellex bolts were selected for permanent development due to their ability to 

better handle the expected high ground temperatures. The pH of groundwater samples obtained from the 

mine area typically varies between 7.5 and 8.5 (neutral) suggesting that the ground support corrosion 

potential is minimal. 

The ground support recommended for each type of permanent and temporary/ore development is 

summarized in Tables 16-5 and 16-6, respectively.

16.4 Mine Planning Criteria 

The mine planning criteria for the Cerro Blanco project are listed below: 

 The pre-production mine development period will be approximately one year, with the duration 

being split between surface preparations, underground rehabilitation and development from both 

the existing exploration declines. 

o Ore will be extracted in the first quarter of Year 1 and the processing plant production rate 

ramps up quarterly from 50% in the first quarter, to 100% of the full average throughput of 1,250 

tpd by the end of Year 1. 

o After Year 1, the mine and mill will operate at a steady state average of 1,250 tpd, 456,250 

tonnes per annum (t/a) 

 Underground mining and maintenance will be carried out by contractors for pre-production and the 

first two years of production, followed by owner operations. Contracted training staff will remain on 

site through the mine life 

 Contractors will be utilized for any raisebore or Alimak raise development 

 Conventional, trackless diesel-electric mining equipment will be utilized, and 

 Most mined voids will be filled with paste fill, cemented rock fill, and/or mine development waste. 

Some mined voids will remain open where backfill is not required. 

Other key mine planning criteria are summarized in Table 16-7.

16.5 Mining Methods 

Two mining methods are proposed for the Cerro Blanco deposit: sub-level longhole (LH), stoping and 

overhand mechanized cut-and-fill (MCF). LH stoping will be used in areas of fair to good ground quality and 

meet geometry constraints as per Table 16-8. MCF will be utilized in areas of poor ground quality or those 

not suitable to LH. A combination of paste backfill, cemented rock fill (CRF), and development waste rock 

fill or loose rock fill (LRF) will be used in the mining sequence.  

The mine will be separated into mining blocks consisting of two to three sublevels that will operate 

independently from one another to increase flexibility and sustain production rates within the mine. Sill 

pillars will be constructed between each mining block to provide safe working cover and high mine 

recoveries.  

Each block will be mined from bottom to top using downhole LH drilling or MCF. As mining advances 

upwards and approaches a mine block above, one final LH stope will be mined with upholes in retreat below 

the sill pillar. The height of the retreat LH stope will equal the height of two MCF lifts in an MCF mining block 

and one standard LH stope height in an LH mining block.  

Approximately 54% of the total mining resource will be mined with LH stoping, 37% with MCF stopes, and 

the remaining 9% mined through stope and level development drifting. 

Infill drilling will be conducted on 15 m spacing from footwall drives to confirm mining method and assist 

stope design prior to production in each mining block. Infill holes could also be used as drain holes to 

dewater any stored water within the stoping area prior to production drilling. 

Figure 16-6 illustrates the ore tonnage breakdown by mining method.

16.5.1 Longhole Mining 

LH mining will be used where rock quality and ground conditions allow and where vein geometry allows for 

economic stope design. LH is the highest productivity method selected for the production phase, but given 

many veins are relatively narrow, considerable preparation is required to maintain stope inventory. 

LH is the least selective of the mining methods when applied over long vertical distances due to potential 

drill hole deviation and vein geometry variations. To mitigate these effects, level spacing was limited to 20 

m (floor to floor) and sill drives are to be fully slashed out above and below the stope to maintain a maximum 

drill length of 16 vertical metres, which is well within selected equipment capabilities and will minimize drill 

hole deviation. Fully slashed top and bottom sills will also allow for parallel drilling rather than ring drilling, 

which increases accuracy when drilling narrow veins. A minimum mining width of 1.5 m was used for design 

and planning purposes. Where the mineralized vein is less than the minimum mining width, internal planned 

dilution is included to increase the width to 1.5 m.  

During top and bottom sub-level sill development, headings will be inspected and mapped to identify 

structural controls and channel samples will be collected as part of the mine grade control protocol. Infill 

drilling on 15 m spacing will take place from footwall drives of each sub-level prior to LH sill development 

to confirm. Information from channel sampling and mapping in the top and bottom sills will be used, in 

conjunction with exploration and definition drilling results, to identify the economic limits and complete final 

stope designs. Mine experience to date at Cerro Blanco verifies that structural boundaries can be used to 

define vein and stope limits.

The collected grade control and vein delineation information will be used to prepare drill hole and blasting 

sequences to minimize extraction dilution and maximize ore recovery. Drill hole locations will be marked in 

the field and drill hole lengths and orientations for drilling will be determined. Blast holes will be drilled from 

the upper drift to the lower drift and drilled to break-through into the lower drift to verify drilling accuracy. If 

the hole deviates significantly from the design, a new hole will be drilled.  

The LH mining cycle will begin with blasting the slot raise to provide a free face for the first LH round and 

initial empty volume for blasted swell. Production blasting will begin at the stope ends and retreat to the 

cross-cut and/or access. Blasted material will report to the bottom of the stope where load haul dump (LHD) 

machines will muck the ore via remote control. LHD remote operators will be stationed in either safety cut-

outs, around the corner, or on pedestals to maintain a safe line of site with the LHD. Specific safety aspects 

of remote operator location will be assessed for each stope prior to mucking. 

Two types of LH stoping will be used at Cerro Blanco: longitudinal and transverse. 

Longitudinal LH methods operate parallel to the strike of the orebody. Longitudinal LH stoping is more 

favourable to transverse stoping in areas where ore thickness is less than 10 m and/or where isolated 

narrow veins are present. The orientation of longitudinal mining methods means that the hanging wall and 

footwall of the orebody will most likely form the sidewalls of the stope. In general, longitudinal methods are 

used where the rock mass quality of the hanging wall rock is competent enough to allow the development 

of a substantial opening in the hanging wall or footwall, usually greater than 15 metres. Longitudinal LH 

methods are very well suited to retreat mining and can be planned such that development occurs within the 

ore itself, reducing development costs, and generating revenue in the process. Longitudinal longhole 

stoping accounts for 15% of mine production, with average stope width of 4.4 metres. 

Transverse LH stoping is a bulk mining method in which the long axis of the stope and access drifts are 

perpendicular to the strike of the orebody. Typically, drawpoints are located in under-cut access drifts which 

extend from the footwall, and the free face is mined in a horizontal retreat from the hanging wall to the 

footwall. In general, transverse longhole stoping is used where the rock mass quality of the hanging wall 

limits the length of the open mining span. This methodology requires more footwall waste development (for 

footwall drifts and drawpoints), however, since each stope has an independent access, it has more flexibility 

with regards to sequencing and scheduling. Transverse longhole stoping accounts for 27% of mine 

production, with average stope width of 11.1 metres. 

Both longitudinal and transverse LH mining utilize top sills for drilling and a bottom sill for material extraction. 

In the event a top sill is unavailable, the lower extraction sill may be used to drill up holes. Mucking is 

achieved with remote control operated LHD machines. Backfilling is achieved from the top sill via paste line 

or ejector trucks and LHD's. Rib pillars are not planned at Cerro Blanco, so transverse stopes will be mined 

in a primary / secondary fashion with cemented backfill placed into the primary stopes to provide structural 

support during excavation of the secondary stopes. In longitudinal LH stoping structural backfill will be 

required in all stopes.  

Figure 16-7 shows a typical mining sequence for LH at Cerro Blanco.

16.5.2 Mechanized Cut-and-Fill 

Overhand MCF mining methods were selected for areas that have lower quality rock and/or where the 

resource geometry is not amenable to LH. 

MCF is a highly selective mining method considered ideal for steeply or shallow dipping high grade deposits 

found in weak host rock. In this method, mining begins at the bottom of the ore body or block and progresses 

upward. During the mining sequence, the back of the excavation is temporarily supported using rock bolts 

before the stope is back filled to form the floor of the next level of development. Backfill is designed to 

provide mild excavation support sufficient to provide a strong working floor for personnel and equipment. 

Progression between stopes is achieved through attack ramps driven at a 15% gradient from a main level 

access point. In a 20 m level there is generally three MCF levels, each four metres tall. The remaining eight 

metres between the last MCF lift and the next level above is mined in retreat using a series of LH up holes. 

This is done to avoid mine workers from drifting underneath sill pillars and increase miner safety. Whenever 

possible, internal ramping on vein is utilized to minimize waste generation and reduce costs. 

Minimum rib pillar spacing between MCF drives is 4.0 metres. Where veins are too narrow to accommodate 

this pillar a primary / secondary mining will take place whereby the primary cuts are taken first and filled 

with a structural cemented backfill. This provides structural wall support to permit mining directly adjacent 

to the primary cut. 

A schematic of a typical stope development is displayed in Figure 16-8.

16.5.3 Resue Mining 

On-vein ore development and MCF mining at Cerro Blanco is primarily done using the resue or split-shot 

mining method. Ore and waste are blasted and mucked in two different steps. If more waste than ore is 

present in the current production face, then waste is blasted first. If there is more ore than waste, then the 

ore is taken first. For design purposes, a minimum mineralized vein width of 0.75 m was used. 

The entire round is drilled using a single-boom jumbo. Either the ore or waste is blasted, and then mucked 

using a 4 tonne (t) class LHD unit. On the next shift, the remaining holes are loaded, and the rest of the 

round is taken and mucked with the 4 t LHD. After both blasts, the area is scaled, and ground support 

installed. Resue mining reduces the dilution tonnage to the mill at the added cost and time of two blasting 

cycles per round of advance. At Cerro Blanco there are enough production faces open at any given time to 

maintain the target mine production feed. A cross section of the resue sequence is shown in Figure 16-9.

Resue mining will also be applied to selected transverse longhole stopes which contain multiple ore veins 

and internal waste lenses wide enough to be blasted independently. In this situation the hangingwall ore 

lens is blasted and mucked out. A separate blast and mucking cycle will then be executed for the waste 

lens, and a final blast and mucking cycle for the footwall ore lens. 

For transverse stopes to be applicable for resue mining there must be a minimum of 1.5 metres of waste 

between two ore lenses dipping greater than 55° on the HW and FW. Stopes undergoing resue mining will 

be 85% effective at removing waste from the stope and 95% effective at recovering the ore. Of all planned 

internal waste mined within the mine plan stopes, 62% of this waste is effectively separated from the ore 

with resue mining. 

16.6 Mine Design 

16.6.1 Level Spacing 

Level spacing was selected based on chosen mine method and effective drill range of planned equipment. 

Top hammer longhole drill machines are planned for Cerro Blanco with an effective drill range of 30 m. With 

an average resource dip of 60° (resource above the minimum stoping requirement of 55°) and a drill hole 

variation of 15°, the optimum level spacing of 20 m was selected.

Larger level spacing of 25 m was evaluated as part of preliminary mine planning, however, it was found 

that the shallow dipping narrow veins received excessive dilution on the hangingwall and footwall that would 

not offset capital development savings. 

16.6.2 Stope Optimization 

Mine planning for the Cerro Blanco project was completed by using Maptek© Vulcan 3D (Vulcan). Vulcan's 

stope optimization software was utilized to generate optimum stope shapes within the resource block 

model. Based on geotechnical criteria described in Section 16.3, stope dimensions of 20 m tall x 7.5 m wide 

were run through the optimizer at 3.5 Au g/t cut-off. 

Stope optimization parameters for the selected optimization trial are listed below in Table 16-8.

*Au_sop is the combination of Auok and Auw with the exclusion of all inferred blocks 

Optimizations were run both individually on each vein, and in bulk, on all veins with a minimum waste pillar 

of 4.0 m between stopes. The resulting stope optimizer shapes were reviewed in plan and section and 

adjusted as necessary to improve grade, tonnage, and/or mineability of each stope. Ultimately every stope 

was designed manually with the stope optimization shapes used as a guide. 

LH stopes were restricted to measured and/or indicated resource blocks as well as blocks outside of the 

poor ground domains. Stopes may, by default, include small portions of poor ground or inferred material 

provided the bulk of stopes are not within these areas. In all cases, Inferred blocks were assumed zero 

grade during stope optimization and inferred grades were not included in any reserve estimations. 

16.6.3 Production Rate 

The following factors were considered in the estimation of the underground mine production rate:

 Mining inventory tonnage and grade 

 Geometry of the mineralized zones 

 Amount of required development 

 Stope productivities, and 

 Sequence of mining and stope availability. 

An underground mine production rate of 1,250 tpd was selected for this FS study and is considered 

appropriate due to the high degree of mechanization and productivities of the selected stoping methods 

and available working faces and/or stopes. The selected mine rate of 1,250 tpd requires that approximately 

40 vertical metres are mined annually, or two mine levels. 

During mine operation two zones, North and South, each with multiple mining horizons will be in production 

simultaneously. On average, a total of 12 mine levels are planned to be in various stages of development 

and production at any given time. 

The underground mine life is estimated at eight years in addition to the one year of pre-production. 

16.6.4 Mine Design Criteria 

Development profiles and gradients were selected based on the equipment specifications, ventilation 

requirements and selected sub-level spacing as shown in Table 16-9.

16.6.5 Mine Access 

Previous exploration campaigns at Cerro Blanco have resulted in the development of extensive 

underground workings consisting of over 2,700 m of lateral development (with dimensions of 4.5 m W x 5.0 

m H) in the form of two portals, declines, and various crosscuts and vein drifting. Main development is 

serviced with power, ventilation, and piping for air and water. Portals have been established into the hillsides 

using steel arches, corrugated steel sheeting, and shotcrete. On surface each portal is outfitted with supply 

water tanks, compressed air tanks, and a power house. No vent fans or duct enters the portal as the mine 

is already equipped with exhaust raises which draw fresh air into the underground workings. There are four 

existing 3.0 m diameter round raises approximately 100 m each in length with square concrete collars 

extending approximately 1.5 m above the surface.  

The existing workings have been incorporated and utilized for access, ventilation, and as production levels 

in the proposed FS design. Additional declines and ramps will be developed at a maximum gradient of 15% 

to access mine levels. Declines and ramps will be driven at 5.0 m x 5.0 m to accommodate 30 tonne haul 

trucks and temporary 1.4 m diameter vent ducts. Two separate ramps will be driven to access the lower 

levels of the North and South zone. 

As the proposed mine does not descend much farther than 300 m below surface, and mineralization begins 

near surface, no shafts were investigated as part of this feasibility study. 

16.6.6 Development Types 

Spiral ramps will provide access to each production level spaced 20 m vertically apart. The spiral ramps 

are driven at -15% grade and 5.0 m by 5.0 m, with a maximum curvature radius of 25 m. At each operating 

level the spiral ramp will run at 0% grade for 20 m to provide equipment better visibility and turning abilities 

on and off the haulage ramp.  

Each level is serviced with a footwall drive to provide ventilation, definition drilling, and crosscut 

development for stopes. Access drifts and footwall drives are developed 5.0 m x 5.0 m to allow truck access

and reduce haul distance of LHDs. Footwall drifts are spaced a minimum 15 m away from LH stopes to 

prevent stability issues as a result of production blasting.  

Transverse LH stopes are accessed by 4.0 m x 4.0 m cross-cuts developed from footwall drives on 7.5 m 

spacing. Cross-cuts are used to provide a platform for LH production drills, as well as remote mucking 

access for blasted material. 

MCF zones are accessed by attack ramps from footwall drives or the haulage ramp directly. Attack ramps 

are driven at a maximum 15% grade and will stack vertically to access multiple production levels from a 

single access point, as shown in Figure 16-8. MCF drifts are driven at 4.0 m x 4.0 m to maintain structural 

integrity in the lower rock quality areas for which cut-and-fill is targeted.  

Ventilation access drifts are driven on each level to ensure fresh and exhaust air raise connections to the 

stoping levels. The cross-cuts are approximately 4.0 m x 4.0 m. 

Remucks are excavated on the main ramp and footwall drives to reduce the development mucking cycle 

time. A maximum of 150 m separates the remucks, which are typically driven 5.0 m W x 5.0 m H x 12 m L. 

The back at the intersection of remucks and the connecting drift will require slashing to 6.4 m H to allow full 

extension and dumping of the LHD bucket.  

Water collection sumps are located on every level adjacent to the exhaust raise, and after level intersection 

in the main ramps. Sumps have been sized at 4.0 m x 4.0 m. Additional cut-outs will be driven beside level 

sumps to accommodate a portable pumping skid that will collect water from level sumps pump directly to 

main dewatering sumps. 

Electric power centers will be located outside the access drift on each level in drifts 4.0 m H x 4.0 m W. 

Additional power centers will be located adjacent to major power draws such as main dewatering sumps 

and cooling machines. 

Refuge stations cut-outs 4.0 m x 4.0 m will be established on every level adjacent to fresh air raises. 

Portable refuge chambers will move between these cut-outs as needed depending on activity within the 

mine. Refuge chambers will provide sufficient capacity for all persons working in the vicinity. 

There is no plan to develop drifts dedicated entirely to diamond drilling. Any definition diamond drilling will 

be carried out from footwall drives and level cross cuts. 

A fresh air raise 3.0 m in diameter will be driven to connect the access drift of each level. Two exhaust 

raises 3.0 m in diameter will be developed at the extents of footwall drifts on each level where possible. 

The raises are driven via raisebore or longhole machine depending on height. Fresh air raises will be 

equipped with ladders for secondary egress. The raises are sequenced in a leapfrog pattern to enable the 

fresh air to be carried in the direction of the ramp progression. Some return air raises will be equipped with 

dewatering lines and paste delivery lines as needed to supply each level of the mine. 

In general, long term development will incorporate a 1.0 m radius arched back, while all temporary drifts 

will be driven with a flat back. In areas of poor ground, it may be required to drive stope sublevels with an 

arched back, as their life span is generally longer than that of an MCF drift. 

Figure 16-11 depicts the various drift dimensions used in the Cerro Blanco mine plan.

16.6.7 Mine Design Considerations 

The geotechnical review prepared by JDS highlighted the potential difficulty and increased support 

requirements involved in creating large open stopes in the weaker ground zones in the Cerro Blanco 

resource. As a result of this, the FS mine design has been optimized to restrict LH stoping to Domain 2 and 

3, and extracting any remaining ore through MCF. As an example, Figure 16-14 below depicts the 420 m 

elevation level, where LH stoping is restricted within Domain 2 (North of upper geotech domain boundary 

line) and MCF stopes extract the remaining economic resource from Domain 1 (South of upper geotech 

domain boundary line).

16.7 Mine Services 

16.7.1 Mine Ventilation 

The ventilation network and fresh air supply quantities were designed to comply with British Columbia (BC) 

ventilation standards. Local mine ventilation standards were not reviewed as part of this FS study; however, 

U.S. and Canadian standards typically carry more stringent requirements compared to Latin American 

countries. All work and equipment pertaining to mine ventilation facilities shall be designed, manufactured, 

installed and tested in accordance with the latest applicable local codes, regulations and standards. In the 

event of conflict, the more stringent standard shall apply. 

16.7.1.1 Key Design Considerations 

Mobile equipment is to be rubber tired and equipped with Tier-3 diesel engines or above. Airflow 

requirements for mobile equipment is equivalent to five times the Particulate Index (PI) for diesel equipment 

that runs on a CANMET certified engines, or 0.063 m3/s/kW (100 cubic feet per minute/brake horsepower 

(cfm/bhp)) for non-approved engines. The design assumes that primary equipment such as trucks and 

loaders have an engine utilization of 90% operating at 2,200 rpm, while auxiliary equipment will have a 

utilization of 15%.

Page 16-29 

 

Given the mine plan assumes contract mining for start-up it is assumed that most Latin American mining 

contractors would not bring this type of equipment to the project site without owner capital support. 

Bluestone also already owns several diesel-operated mobile loaders, trucks, and drills that will be utilized 

as part of the mine plan. 

16.7.1.2 General Arrangement 

The proposed ventilation system consists of two networks providing separate air flows to North and South 

zones. A push-pull system is proposed whereby main fans mounted on surface ventilation raise collars will 

push fresh air into the mine and draw exhaust air from production areas. The South zone will utilize one of 

two existing raises for intake air, and the installation of two new raises are proposed to handle return air. 

North Zone will utilize two existing raises, one for fresh air injection, and the other for exhaust extraction. 

Two existing declines, one to North and South zone each, will serve as mixed air ways for primary egress 

of equipment and labour. Fresh air raises will extend down each zone in a series of drop raises and be 

equipped with ladder ways to provide secondary egress. Figure 16-15 illustrates the proposed ventilation 

network at Cerro Blanco. 

Figure 16-15: Mine Ventilation Process Flow Diagram 

 
Source: JDS (2019) 

Parallel fans installed in a bulk cooler will deliver chilled fresh air to each working area within the mine. 

Fresh air will be discharged from the base of fresh air drop raises at the intersection of the main ramp and 

level access. Fresh air will be drawn into working levels via a level fan equipped with 1.4 m diameter ducting, 



 

 

CERRO BLANCO PROJECT 
FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 16-30 

 

with a portion of fresh air permitted to leak into the ramp and main haulage way, and a portion into another 

vent ducting to provide fresh air to ramp development crews. On level, fresh air will be drawn across footwall 

drives and ultimately exit the level via exhaust raises equipped with louvered air regulators. Smaller 

production fans will push fresh air into stopes and exhaust back into the footwall drive where dirty air is 

directed to the exhaust raises. Where possible, production fans will be placed on the ground behind drills 

to push cold air to the face and allow hot air to rise and exit the working area. 

16.7.1.3 Airflow and Fan Selection 

The calculation of ventilation requirements for the mine was based on: 

 Diesel equipment fleet and mining activity in work areas of the mine 

 Underground fixed facilities such as service bays, pump stations, etc. 

 Inactive areas that need nominal airflow to keep the temperatures within acceptable limits 

 Haulage routes with any equipment including trucks 

 Personnel working underground, and 

 An estimated airflow leakage factor.  

For sizing the main surface and underground infrastructure, peak ventilation demand was calculated 

followed by the airflow requirements at individual ventilation milestones. The peak ventilation demand for 

the Cerro Blanco mine plan is 252 m3/s (534 kcfm) based on the equipment fleet profile (top-down 

approach), and 296 m3/s (628 kcfm) based on work place activity (bottom-up approach). Due to the higher 

airflow requirement, the bottom-up ventilation demand was taken as the final driving factor for the ventilation 

demand. 

The main fan duty points respective to each ventilation milestone were determined using Ventsim™ 

modeling software. The mine requires four main intake fans and six exhaust fans at the peak ventilation 

demand phase. These fans will be commissioned on the main intake and return raises. Until the 

commissioning of main fans on the raises, the existing surface fans will be used for the development of 

declines, with forced ventilation flexible ducting system. 

Fan selection considered parallel fan installations at each raise rather than one large fan for ease and 

flexibility of maintenance during operation, and for staging installations as airflow demand increases over 

time. Parallel fans are desirable to keep efficiencies high when ventilation requirements are low and only 

one fan is required, and to permit a reduced ventilation flow (as opposed to none) when fan maintenance 

is required. 

The specifications for the main intake fans and exhaust fans located at the collars of the main raises of 

North and South zones are summarized in Table 16-10 and Table 16-11 respectively.

was determined. 110 kW fans were sized for ramp and level ventilation, and 15 kW fans were sized for 

stope and miscellaneous local ventilation. 

16.7.1.4 Ventilation Phases 

Four ventilation milestones are identified in the life of Cerro Blanco mine. They are: 

 Development Phase (Year -1) 

 Early production Phase (Year 1) 

 Steady State Production Phase (Year 3), and 

 Worst-Case Production Phase (Year 7). 

Development Phase 

In its current state, the Cerro Blanco mine has small fans located at collars of the surface Alimak raises 

along with auxiliary fans employed for decline development. Due to the interception of hot ground water at 

the development face and high virgin rock temperatures, installing a main surface cooler along with the 

main intake fan is recommended for maintaining safe temperatures in the work areas underground. 

Early Production Phase 

The timeframe where only the upper levels in North and South zones are fully developed and producing 

ore, with primary ventilation network established, is considered as the early production phase. Ramp 

development crew advances to the levels 340 South and 380 North, and the level development crew starts 

developing each level as ramp reaches those levels. The airflow requirement is around 180 m3/s. One main 

intake fan is commissioned on the fresh air raise (FAR) collar of both the North and South zones. One main 

return fan is also commissioned on the return air raise (RAR) collar of North zone. All these fans operate 

with variable frequency drives (VFDs). 

Steady State Production Phase 

Once the mine reaches its steady state production capacity, the overall mining activities do not vary with 

time, but the location of the respective mining activities varies during the life of mine, according to the 

development and production sequence. This phase is modeled at a timeframe when most mining activity is 

in the upper parts of the mine. The mine development activities continue to reach the bottom levels of the 

mine. The airflow requirement for the mine at this stage is about 275 m3/s. 

Worst-Case Production Phase 

During this phase, all the main surface fans are installed, and they operate at their maximum duty points, 

pushing enough airflow to the bottom-most levels of the mine to support the mining activities in both North 

and South zones. This time frame is defined as the Worst-Case Production Phase and occurs during and 

after Year 6. Ramp development is complete, and all the levels are fully developed and connected to 

ventilation network. Depending on the production schedule, any level could be under production at a given 

point of time.  

The total airflow requirement for the mine at this stage is about 296 m3/s; however, the main fans handle 

an airflow of 340 m3/s for the following reasons: 



 

 

CERRO BLANCO PROJECT 
FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 16-33 

 

 To maintain minimum required airflow velocities in the internal ramp and main decline to portals, 

for dust issues 

 To maintain sufficient airflow rates in all the haulage routes to ventilate trucks 

 To maintain required temperatures in all the work areas underground, and 

 To account for density variations due to surface refrigeration plant; and auto-compression due to 

the mine depth. 

16.7.2 Mine Air Cooling 

Due to the interception of hot ground water at the development face and high virgin rock temperatures, the 

Cerro Blanco mine will operate at elevated temperatures and it will be imperative to exhaust heat sources 

as quickly and efficiently as possible. Where possible, temperature control mitigations have been exercised 

through mine design and mobile equipment selection. Dewatering lines will route through exhaust raises 

located at the extremities of each working level to minimize hot water exposure to the mine workings. 

Enclosed cabs equipped with air conditioning will be utilized on mobile equipment where possible. Mine air 

cooling will supplement temperature controls with surface mounted bulk air chillers on the fresh air intake 

raises. Chilled air will be pushed into the mine workings and distributed among levels by way of ventilation 

regulators and auxiliary ventilation fans. The cool air will absorb heat produced by the mine and be 

exhausted to surface, effectively reducing the working temperature underground. 

Cerro Blanco mine climate modeling was carried out with various heat loads occurring at Worst-Case 

Production scenario to quantify the air refrigeration requirements for the mine. The following sub-sections 

detail the design criteria and heat loads applied to the Ventsim model. 

16.7.2.1 Design Criteria 

16.7.2.1.1 Intake Conditions 

The pressure, temperature, and humidity of the ambient air flowing into the mine will vary seasonally as 

well as day to night. These variances typically result in the transfer of heat to or from the intake shaft/raise 

walls and are damped by a thermal flywheel effect. Thus, average summer intake conditions were taken as 

the basis for the estimation of refrigeration requirement for Cerro Blanco mine. These are tabulated in Table 

16-12 below.

16.7.2.1.2 Geothermal Gradient and Rock Properties 

Based on rock temperature measurement data from the existing main decline, a base virgin rock 

temperature (VRT) is taken. Any measurement data that was affected due to the interference from ground 

water was omitted in the estimation. The VRT at 497 m elevation (decline portal) is estimated to be at 51°C. 

The mine geothermal gradient is 0.1°C per m.

16.7.2.1.3 Maximum Reject Temperature 

Wet bulb temperature index (WBGT) for heat stress indices was used to select a design parameter of 28°C 

wet bulb (Twb) for the FS ventilation modeling. 28°C will ensure high efficiency of acclimatized workers. 

Workers may safely perform work underground up to 32°C wet bulb (Twb), albeit under short work durations 

and reduced efficiency. Work performed above 32°C wet bulb (Twb) must be planned on a case by case 

basis with application of appropriate heat stress safety measures. 

16.7.2.2 Heat Loads 

A total heat load of 12 MW is estimated to be imparted onto the ventilation system of Cerro Blanco mine in 

average summer conditions. The breakdown of heat loads is given in Figure 16-16 and Table 16-14 and 

these are estimated for Worst-Case Production Phase.

 The total ground water inflow to the mine is 75.7 liters/second (l/s) or 1,200 gallons per minute 

(gpm), with north and south zones getting equal share (37.5 l/s or 600 gpm) 

 Each mining level receives the same amount of ground water inflow, which means North zone 

levels would see an inflow rate of 3.2 l/s (50 gpm), and South zone levels would see 2.7 l/s (43 

gpm) at steady state mining phase 

 Development heading see similar ground water inflow rates, for instance, 3.2 l/s for a ramp 

development heading in North zone, and 

 Ground water exposed to the air on each level lose 5°C temperature, which imparts a heat load on 

to the respective level.  

After the ground water gets collected into the level sump and pumped into the borehole by the level pump, 

there is no further heat transfer between water and air, until the water gets exposed to the mine air at the 

main pump station. An estimated total heat load of 1,949 kW is coming from ground water at Cerro Blanco 

mine, provided all the levels are open and active. 

Any heat transfer in between the ground water at main pump stations and mine air is not accounted for in 

the heat loads; because the pull ventilation system arranged at the main pump stations will take any heat 

generated at the pumps and reject directly into the main return air system of the mine. 

16.7.2.2.2 Diesel Equipment 

Diesel engine releases heat energy (sensible and latent) based on its rated power, duration of utilization, 

heat load factor, and efficiency. Table 16-15 and Table 16-16 illustrates the heat load calculations for the 

ramp development crew and 30 tonne haulage truck. Depending on the ventilation phase, heat loads are 

applied to the Ventsim model based on the mining activity with respect to the ventilation phase.

16.7.2.2.3 Mobile Electrical Equipment 

Equipment including jumbo, bolter, exploration drills, etc., run on diesel engines for tramming, but use 

electrical power for operating. The heat released from such equipment during operation is detailed in this 

section. The electrical engine efficiency is much higher (in the order of 90%) compared to that of a diesel 

engine, and thus, the heat released from electrical equipment is relatively less compared to that of a diesel 

fleet. Table 16-17 illustrates heat calculations for electrical equipment from the ramp development crew. 

Depending on the ventilation phase, heat loads are applied to the Ventsim model based on the mining 

activity in the specific ventilation phase.

16.7.2.2.4 Fixed Electrical Equipment 

Main fans and auxiliary fans are considered to operate 100% of the time with a heat output of 100% of their 

rated electrical demand. Ventsim considers 100% of the input power to all the fans, except for the main 

return fans on the surface, as heat power input to the system. Thus, the heat load from fans is automatically 

added to the system by the model. 

It is assumed that approximately 5% of the total load from the underground load centers will be rejected in 

the form of sensible heat into the mine. The heat added from the substations / load centers is nominal due 

to the electrical efficiency. Pumps located at the main pump stations in North and South zones also impart 

heat to the ventilation system. Table 16-18 shows the heat load from main pump stations.

16.7.2.2.5 Explosives 

The chemical energy released from the explosives during the blast is considered available as thermal 

energy at the location of the blast (production stope / development face); the location of the stope is 

considered as point source of release of this heat. It is assumed that 20% of the energy released by the 

explosives is dispersed into the ventilation system during the blast clearance cycle (in the first hour of firing 

the shot). The remaining 80% is released to the level as the rock is removed from the production stope / 

development face). Table 16-19 below provides the calculations for explosives heat.

The two types of explosives to be used for blasting the rock in Cerro Blanco are ANFO and Powermite 

Thermo. The latter has a higher specific energy, and thus, is used for calculations for a conservative 

estimate. It is calculated that an approximate 1,000 kg of explosives is required for the required peak 

advance rate of 30 m /day in the mine, releasing approximately 36 kW of heat over duration of shift. 

16.7.2.2.6 Broken Rock Haulage 

The heat transfer between the broken rock and the fresh air in the decline, during haulage via trucks is 

detailed in this section. The initial temperature of broken rock is assumed to be at the virgin rock 

temperature of the respective mining elevation. Due to the lack of measurement data, it is assumed there 

is a temperature drop of 10°C from the excavated rock in the loaded trucks by the time they reach the 

decline portal. A linear heat load of 48 W/m is applied along the decline in both North and South zones of 

the mine. The heat load calculations are shown in Table 16-20.

16.7.2.3 Cooling Plant Design 

To provide sufficient cooling for the Cerro Blanco mine, a surface cooling plant is proposed without any 

underground cooling infrastructure. The surface cooling system for the mine will be comprised of centrifugal 

water chillers, cooling towers, bulk air coolers, and pump skids for chilled and condenser water. Both North 

and South zones will have separate cooling systems, located at respective fresh air raise collars. 

Though the total heat loads during the worst-case production scenario is about 12 MW, the cooling plant 

capacity required for Cerro Blanco mine is about 13.5 MWr (refrigeration). This is partly due to the cooling 

power leakage to the surface portals via main decline from the main fresh air raises. With a coefficient of 

performance of 3.5, it is estimated that a total of 3.4 MW electrical power is required on surface for surface 

cooling plant. 

16.7.3 Water Supply 

The underground workings are currently supplied service water from the treatment plant into two 22,000 L 

tanks, one at each portal. Mine plan equipment requirements were reviewed to determine peak service 

water requirements of 38 gpm. Each service water tank will be filled an average of 5 times daily to meet 

this demand. Water will be piped down the main decline and ramps to each working level via a 2-inch water 

line. Level switches installed in the surface tanks will be connected to pump controls to maintain supply. 

Mobile drilling equipment will shut down when water temperatures exceed 75⁰C. Given groundwater inflow 

temperatures are expected to meet or exceed this temperature, using underground inflow as a water supply 

is not part of the plan. 

16.7.4 Dewatering 

Dewatering of the Cerro Blanco mine can be achieved through a combination of underground dewatering 

from sumps and dewatering at the surface from deep dewatering wells. The mine is currently being 

dewatered at a rate of approximately 600 gpm, with 2 dewatering wells and underground mine sump pumps 

in operation. Based on analyses conducted to date, well dewatering rates for future mine development are 

expected to be approximately 5,550 (gpm) and mine sump dewatering rates are expected to be

Page 16-40 

 

approximately 1,200 gpm. The dewatering plan involves addition of dewatering wells over the life of the 

mine to provide access to deeper ore. 

A primary challenge of dewatering while advancing mining operations at Cerro Blanco is the high 

temperature of the groundwater, which ranges up to 190°C near some of the perimeter mine dewatering 

wells and up to 120°C near the mine workings. While the temperatures drop quickly as the water enters the 

mine workings (i.e. typical sump temperatures range from 50°C to 65°C), the high groundwater 

temperatures have significant engineering and design implications for pumping strategies, well design, 

health and safety considerations, equipment/facilities material selection, and water disposal methods. For 

example, without proper backpressure on the dewatering wells, steam flashing can occur causing the water 

to vaporize, which makes pump designs critical. In addition, the temperature of water to be reinjected affects 

the injection well efficiencies and maintenance needs. 

For these reasons, it is important to note that approximately 55% of the North Zone reserves and 35% of 

the South Zone reserves existing above the current water table, as depicted in Figure 16-17, which provides 

flexibility in mine planning and other engineering and system design.

16.7.4.1 Dewatering System Objectives 

The primary performance objective of the dewatering system is to reduce and maintain manageable 

groundwater inflow into mine workings throughout the life of the mine. Extracted water is to be conveyed to 

an on-site water treatment plant for treatment and/or reuse in mine operations or discharged at surface or 

injected into deep aquifer zones. 

16.7.4.2 Field Investigations 

Field investigations were conducted in 2018 to assess feasible dewatering and reinjection methods, 

including flow tests, water-level monitoring, and water quality sampling. 

Flow tests at existing mine dewatering wells in 2018 demonstrated that long-term sustained pumping could 

be achieved while limiting steam flashing in the dewatering wells by exerting backpressure. Extraction rates 

at some existing wells appear to be limited by existing pump equipment and a limited saturated interval.

These findings suggest that deeper wells with additional head above the pump intake will improve 

operations and allow higher pumping rates, thus potentially requiring fewer wells to achieve the necessary 

dewatering. 

Field injection tests were conducted in 2018 in both shallow and deep wells. Results from a short-term 72-

hour injection test in a shallow injection well (constructed in unconsolidated material to 150 m below ground) 

indicated insufficient injection rates (13.2 gpm). However, a successful long-term injection test was 

completed over a two-month period using a deeper (842 m) existing geothermal well screened in a fractured 

/ faulted rock zone. Resulting injection rates into the deeper fractured rock ranged up to 800 gpm, and 

averaged just over 500 gpm at sustained pressures, demonstrating that deep injection is feasible as a 

disposal option for mine dewatering well water. There were indications that injection into this particular test 

well impacted water levels at several monitoring wells located near the mine, indicating hydraulic connection 

between the screened zone of the test well and monitoring wells near the mine. 

16.7.4.3 Numerical Groundwater Model 

A numerical groundwater flow model was developed and calibrated to evaluate impacts of groundwater 

pumping near the mine and to predict dewatering rates based on the mine plan and mining depths (Stantec, 

2018b). The model was used to estimate the number of dewatering wells required over time, along with 

underground sumps, while limiting the number of wells and phasing in operation of the wells through time 

so that costs are spread out over the life-of-mine.  

The mine drainage simulation was modeled for a total of 10 years (3,650 days), and the model output 

indicates that eight new deep dewatering wells capable of producing a cumulative extraction of 4,800 gpm, 

along with an additional 750 gpm of extraction from existing mine dewatering wells will be required as 

shown in Figure 16-18. Also, underground dewatering using sump pumps will account for approximately 

1,200 gpm, bringing total dewatering to a peak rate of 6,750 gpm in later stages of the mine life. This water 

will be delivered to the water treatment plant, or to deep injection wells for disposal. The currently operating 

water treatment plant at the mine has a capacity of 1,500 gpm. 

It is anticipated that the deep injection wells (planned for depths of 800 meters) will have capacities of 600 

gpm each. A total of nine injection wells are planned to be installed and phased into operation through time, 

to manage extracted water volumes above the water treatment plant capacity.

16.7.4.4 Dewatering System 

Due to high groundwater temperatures, geothermal industry technology and practises for groundwater 

extraction were incorporated into the dewatering system design. Well pumping will require constant 

backpressure to be applied to the wellhead and pump column to maintain water in a single liquid phase.  

As indicated by numerical groundwater modeling results, groundwater will be captured in underground 

sumps and pumped up to a total rate of 1,200 gpm. The sump flows will be supplemented by operation of 

five currently existing wells (total of 750 gpm) and eight new dewatering wells (total of 4,800 gpm) that will 

be phased into operation over a six-year period. Considering sump flows and existing and new dewatering 

wells, the total possible dewatering rate would be 6,750 gpm but the numerical model indicates sump 

dewatering rates will decrease through time resulting in likely maximum dewatering rates of 6,150 gpm. 

The new dewatering wells are planned to be approximately 600 m deep and to have a minimum of 12-inch 

casing and screen diameter to accommodate variable speed pumps capable of operating in high-

temperature groundwater. The pumping rates for the existing wells are anticipated to be approximately 150 

gpm each based on historical performance and improved heat management techniques as demonstrated 

in recent field testing.  

The proposed dewatering schedule minimizes the number of wells and distributes operation of these wells 

over time to spread operation costs over the life of the mine. Dewatering is expected to begin during pre-

production Year -1 with wells phasing into operation in subsequent years. The proposed dewatering 

implementation schedule is summarized in Table 16-21.

16.7.4.5 Underground Dewatering Strategy 

Given the high temperature of water anticipated at Cerro Blanco, it will be important to handle water inflow 

quickly and effectively to minimize its exposure active mine workings. The general underground water 

management strategy at Cerro Blanco is to briefly collect water in catch sumps and level sumps, re-direct 

this water into portable pumping skids, pump water up exhaust raises to main booster stations and 

eventually to surface. Level sumps have been strategically placed adjacent to exhaust raises to minimize 

the exposure of hot water to active areas of the mine and minimize the pumping of hot water through cooled 

drifts. 

Two main booster pump stations (BPS) are planned for Cerro Blanco, one at each the North Zone and 

South Zone. BPS will be equipped with two 200 hp centrifugal Techno-jet pumps (one operational and one 

standby) and located on the 400 and 380 mine level in the North and South Zone respectively. BPS will 

pump water up the N1 and S3 return air raises from where water will be directed to the water treatment 

plant on surface for discharge or re-injection. 

Portable pumping skids (pump skids) equipped with three 60 hp Techno-process pumps (two operational 

and one standby) will be utilized to re-direct water from level sumps and face pumps to the BPS. Pump 

skids will follow level development and be placed temporarily in crosscuts adjacent to level sumps. As the

mine is developed at depth, the pump skids will be relocated to the level below. Sumps no longer in use 

will receive pilot holes connecting to the next level sump, gravity feeding water to the nearest pump skid. 

During the mine life the North Zone will require one pump skid. As the maximum vertical pumping head is 

reached one pump skid will become permanently located on level 260 in the South Zone, and an additional 

pump skid will be used to continue dewatering at depth. 

Catch sumps will be located after the intersection of mine levels on the ramp to minimize ramp flooding. 

Level sumps will be located adjacent to the return air raise on each working level to minimize hot water 

exposure to air conditioned drifts. Submersible pumps will be used at the face and in level sumps to re-

direct water to the pumping skids.  

Probe drilling during mine development will be utilized to encounter stored water and allow a controlled 

release. Infill drilling on levels will also serve as dewatering holes prior to production stoping on level. 

The underground dewatering model was designed to accommodate a maximum underground inflow of 

1,200 gpm and peak inflow of 50 gpm at each working face. Water discharged on surface will be discharged 

to the environment following water treatment process and/or re-injected to the regional water table. 

The dewatering single line diagram is shown in Figure 16-19.

16.7.4.6 Water Disposal 

Water disposal will be via the existing water treatment plant, which discharges to the nearby Quebrada 

Tempisque, and deep injection wells. While the permitted and designed water treatment plant capacity is 



 

 

CERRO BLANCO PROJECT 
FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 16-45 

 

1,500 gpm, it has available capacity to accept approximately 1,230 gpm from the dewatering system (with 

approximately 270 gpm occupied by process water treatment). With the simulated peak dewatering rates 

reaching approximately 6,150 gpm (assuming surface well and sump dewatering) the remaining water 

(4,920 gpm) beyond the treatment plant capacity will be directed to injection wells. 

During high precipitation events, dewatering flows to the treatment plant may need to be diverted to 

accommodate the treatment of contact storm water, temporarily limiting available capacity to accept 

dewatering flows (Stantec, 2018d). Flexibility in injection capacity at the injection wells may provide some 

temporary outlet for higher flows; however, extreme storm events or high precipitation for an extended 

period may require a temporary curtailment of dewatering well pumping. On-going real time water quality 

monitoring will be used to evaluate how much storm water flow will require treatment and more precisely 

calculate available treatment capacity during potential storm events. 

Injection was demonstrated to be a viable disposal alternative based on long-term testing conducted at 

geothermal well MG-05. Average injection rates sustained at MG-05 were greater than 500 gpm, with flows 

up to 800 gpm. However, this test injection rate was limited by pumps with insufficient flow/pressure rating 

available at the mine, indicating potentially greater injection capacity at this well. The proposed nine deep 

injection wells will likely be located along the East Fault alignment, and operations will be phased-in through 

time as shown in Table 16-21. The proposed injection system nominal capacity is 5,400 gpm at full 

construction. 

16.7.5 Underground Electrical Distribution 

The underground power distribution follows a 13.8 kV dual feed redundant power supply strategy. Each 

power supply from 13.8 kV overhead power distribution line steps down to 4.16 kV through a 5 MVA power 

transformer located at the mine portal. Each main feed and all main distribution equipment are sized to 

accommodate the entire underground mine loads. The mine substation on surface complete with secondary 

selective systems will consist of two single-ended 4.16 kV switchgears with normally open tie breakers 

linked between.  

As the existing mining equipment on site is mostly rated 4.16 kV, the selected distribution voltage level for 

underground is 4.16 kV which could be re-used in the new development. A total of two major power feeders 

from the portal mine switchgear will provide the electrical distribution for underground mining operation. For 

lateral distribution the required power feeder cables (mine cable) are routed through the main ramp decline 

via permanently installed overhead messenger cables. Development and permanent junction boxes are 

installed every 350 m for mine power center (MPC) connection. An MPC is standardized with a fused 

disconnect switch, a step-down dry type transformer converting 4.16 kV (distribution voltage) to 480 V 

(utilization voltage) and a 480 V distribution switchboard for mining development and utility equipment 

connection. 

The lateral distribution will be changed to vertical descent through ventilation raise when power feeders 

need to approach another level. The vertical cable installation (shaft cable) is to reduce cable length and to 

maintain the overall voltage drop within 3%. A cross-over isolation switch is also required at every second 

level complete with a kirk key interlock so that only two switches close at one time. The isolation switch 

allows the maintenance of power feeder cables and MPCs without interrupting downstream equipment 

operation or causing major underground power outages.

The demand load for underground mine is estimated up to 3 MVA as the mine development and mineral 

ore extraction progress. Underground power distribution single line diagrams have been developed to 

explain the proposed electrical distribution system and are shown in Figure 16-20 and Figure 16-21.

16.7.6 Mine Communications 

An underground network with leaky feeder radio communication systems exists on site and will be 

expanded at depth. Mobile equipment operators, light vehicles, and supervisors will be equipped with hand-

held radios to communicate with personnel on surface. Communication protocols will be used to ensure 

safe travel on the ramps and decline. 

16.7.7 Compressed Air 

Newer mining equipment often has built-in air compressors and does not need to be connected to the mine 

compressed air system. However, compressed air will be required by certain mining equipment including 

several of the used machines purchased from the Marlin operation. Peak compressed air requirements are 

estimated to 3,290 cfm. An existing compressed air system is installed on site with 1,100 cfm at the North 

Portal, 1,200 cfm at the South Portal, and 675 cfm installed underground. The existing compressed air 

system is anticipated to meet future requirements with the addition of planned compressed air line 

extensions down ramp. 

16.7.8 Explosives and Detonator Storage 

No long-term explosive storage underground is planned; explosives needed for daily production and 

development will be transported as needed from the surface where they will be stored in the existing 

explosive silo and cap magazine. The bulk explosives facility is located a safe distance from the mining 

facilities. Existing surface magazines can accommodate 75,000 kg of bulk explosives and 10,000 

detonators. These facilities will provide enough explosives for approximately 50 days of mine operation. 

16.7.9 Fuel Storage and Distribution 

An equipment fueling and lube station will be located near the North portal to provide fuel for the mobile 

underground equipment fleet. As the mine gets deeper and tramming distances increase portable 500 

gallon Satstat fuel and 250 gallon lubrication storage units will be installed in permanent fuel bays 

underground. Fuel and lube bays will service drill and auxiliary equipment that do not regularly exit the 

mine, while trucks and scoops will fuel on surface.  

One fuel and lube bay will be installed on the 400 level in the South Zone in year three, with a second fuel 

and lube bay constructed in the North Zone during year four of operation. A mobile fuel and lube truck will 

make daily deliveries to the underground fuel bays, as well as servicing any mobile equipment too far from 

both surface and portable fuel stations. 

16.7.10 Mobile Equipment Maintenance 

An underground maintenance facility with equipment wash bay, lube and oil change bays, electrical shop, 

and small warehouse will be constructed for routine services and small repairs. All equipment requiring 

major service, component change-out or repairs will be taken to the surface facility. 

A maintenance supervisor will provide a daily maintenance work schedule, ensuring the availability of spare 

parts and supplies, and providing management and supervision to maintenance crews. The supervisor will 

also provide training for the maintenance workforce.

A maintenance planner will schedule maintenance and repair work, as well as provide statistics of 

equipment availability, utilization and life cycle. A computerized maintenance system is recommended to 

facilitate planning. 

The equipment operators will provide equipment inspection at the beginning of the shift and perform small 

maintenance and repairs as required. 

16.7.11 Mine Safety 

Self-contained portable refuge stations will be provided in the main underground work areas. The refuge 

chambers are designed to be equipped with dedicated fresh air, potable water, and first aid equipment; 

they will also be supplied with a fixed telephone line and emergency lighting. The refuge chambers doors 

are sealed to prevent the entry of gases. The portable refuge chambers will be moved to the new locations 

as the working areas advance. There will also be one permanent lunch room, which will also function as a 

refuge station. Although refuge stations will be placed adjacent to fresh air raises, dedicated fresh air piping 

will be required for each refuge chamber in the event of an emergency where fresh air raises are inoperable. 

Fire extinguishers will be provided and maintained in accordance with regulations and best practices at the 

underground electrical installations, pump stations, fueling stations, and other strategic areas. Every vehicle 

will carry at least one fire extinguisher of adequate size. All underground heavy equipment will be equipped 

with automatic fire suppression systems. 

Primary mine access will be through the main portal and decline. Secondary emergency egress will be 

through the fresh air raises on each level and connecting to the existing portals. The raises will be equipped 

with all the necessary equipment to provide secondary egress. 

A fully equipped mine rescue team will be available every shift to respond to emergencies. 

16.8 Unit Operations 

16.8.1 Drilling 

There are six principal drilling machines selected for Cerro Blanco. Each has their own primary use: 

 Two-boom Electric-hydraulic jumbos for large dimension development headings 

 Single-boom Electric-hydraulic jumbos for small development and production headings 

 Mechanized bolters for ground support installation 

 Electric-hydraulic longhole drills for production and cable bolt drilling 

 Electric-hydraulic in-the-hole (ITH) hammer drill – Slot raise, utility drill hole drilling, and 

 Jackleg drills – Safety bay drilling, services drilling, etc. 

Drilling productivities (metre drilled/percussion hour) were built up from first principles and industry 

standards. Jumbo drilling rates vary from 30 m/hr in small headings (1-boom) to 50 m/hr in large headings 

(2-boom), and longhole drill machines average 11 m/hr. Drilling rates include penetration rates, reaming 

rates, repositioning, set-up / mark-up, and a 5% factor for re-drilling.

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 16-51 

 

Smaller headings such as on vein ore development will be conducted by single-boom electric jumbo drills. 

The single-boom jumbos will be equipped with 4.3 m (14 ft) drill steel and will advance an average 4.4 m/d 

per machine throughout the mine, which equates to approximately 0.5 round per eight hour shift. 

Capital ramps, cross-cuts, footwall drives and other large headings will be developed by two-boom electric 

jumbo drills. Jumbos will be equipped with 4.88 m (16 ft) drill steel and will advance an average 4.5 m/d per 

machine throughout the mine, which equates to approximately 0.3 rounds per eight hour shift. 

Of all holes, re-drilling is anticipated at approximately 5%. 

16.8.2 Blasting 

For explosives use, blasting crews will be trained and certified. Bulk or packaged emulsion will be used for 

production blasting and development rounds in hot or wet ground. Ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) 

product will be used where possible in dry and cool areas below 55°C. Boosters, primers, detonators, 

detonation cord and other ancillary blasting supplies will also be utilized. Smooth blasting techniques may 

be used as required in headings, with the use of trim powder / bulk emulsion for loading the perimeter holes. 

Bulk explosives will be stored on surface in powder magazines in accordance with current Guatemalan 

explosives regulations. The blasting crews will pick up the estimated quantities of explosives required for 

each shift using explosives transport vehicles and deliver those explosives to working faces and explosives-

loading equipment underground. Excess explosives and accessories will be returned to the secure powder 

magazine every shift. All explosives and detonators in and out of the magazines will be documented as per 

Guatemalan explosives regulations. 

During the pre-production period, blasting in the development headings will be done at any time during the 

shift when the face is loaded and ready to blast. All personnel underground will be required to be in a 

designated Safe Work Area during blasting. During the production period, a central blast system will be 

used to initiate blasts for all loaded development headings and production stopes at the end of each shift. 

Where ventilation allows, multi-blasting of isolated high priority development headings is possible. 

Rock temperatures underground are expected to exceed the limits of standard blasting products. ANFO 

and emulsion have recommended ground temperature limits of 55ºC and 50ºC respectively, while In-situ 

ground temperatures may exceed 120ºC. At elevated temperatures standard ANFO and emulsion products 

begin to degrade and can cause blast failures which bring lengthy delays in reblasting or poor 

fragmentation. It is noted that high temperatures do not cause premature detonation.  

High temperature explosives and detonators will be required for blasting under hot conditions. In hot and 

non-reactive ground, Senatel Pyromex is rated to 150˚C for 8 hours. Explosive sleep times increase with 

decreased ground temperature to a maximum of 60 days. Orica's recommended blasting procedure for 

high temperature explosives includes the following products and time lines: 

Initiation Product: i-kon III electronic detonator – standard or RX. 

 +176ºF to 185ºF (+80ºC to 85ºC) =  

o The total exposure time from the start of loading of the blast to the firing of the blast must not 

exceed 4 hours and the maximum delay time programmed to be no greater than 20 seconds. 

All explosive columns primed with i-kon III detonators are to be checked for high current

leakage before firing. A back-up primer shall be top primed in any hole that has high current 

leakage. No holes over 185ºF (85ºC) to be loaded with i-kon III detonators. 

 +158ºF to 176ºF (+70ºC to 80ºC) = 

o The total exposure time from the start of loading of the blast to the firing of the blast must not 

exceed 48 hours. 

 Below 158ºF (70ºC) = 

o 60 days maximum. 

Primer Product: Senatel Pyromex packaged detonator sensitive emulsion. 

 TDS 

o The total exposure time from the start of loading of the blast to the firing of the blast must not 

exceed 12 hours.  

 Mine X 

o The total primer exposure time from the start of loading of the blast to the firing of the blast 

must not exceed the safe loading windows for i-kon III detonators as detailed above. 

Column Load: Senatel Pyromex packaged detonator sensitive emulsion, or Subtek Eclipse bulk emulsion.  

 TDS 

o Determined by reactive ground testing and measured in hole temperature. 

 Mine X 

o The total column load exposure time from the start of loading of the blast to the firing of the 

blast must not exceed the safe loading windows for i-kon III detonators as detailed above. 

Blast holes will be probed after drilling to ensure appropriate explosives are used and no holes are loaded 

above 85°C. Where holes exceed maximum blasting temperatures the face will be left to cool before 

loading. JDS has assumed that 25% of all rounds will require a cooling period of 12 hours. 

High temperature explosives are assumed to be used wholly in all decline ramp development, where hot 

water inflow is anticipated to be the greatest. Half of all level development and production blasting is also 

assumed to require high temperature blasting product. Excessive temperature tends to lead to blast failures, 

instead of premature detonations. Remaining blasts will use a mixture of packaged emulsion in wet ground 

and ANFO product in dry areas. By weight the total requirement of high temperature explosives, standard 

bulk emulsion, and ANFO product is 65%, 22%, and 13% respectively. 

16.8.3 Ground Support 

Ground support will be installed in accordance with specifications based on geotechnical analysis provided 

in Section 16.3 for the various rock qualities expected. Electric-hydraulic bolters, longhole drills, and 

shotcrete spraying machines will be used. Some ground support may be installed using jackleg drills. 

Ground support will be installed post-mucking of the blasted drift. No additional development will be 

commenced in the heading prior to the installation of ground support. In areas where resue mining occurs,

FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 16-53 

 

the waste and ore will both be blasted and mucked prior to ground support installation. At no time will mine 

workers be under unsupported ground. 

Different ground support criteria are recommended for various types of ground conditions, rated from good 

to poor, and largely associated with lithological domains. Discretion will be made by the development lead 

as to which ground support is required, with additional review and recommendations provided by the on-

site geotechnical engineer. 

Regular pull tests will be conducted on-site to ensure adequate installation of rock bolts are being done. 

Shotcrete, when required, will also be sampled by use of splatter boards and in-situ coring to be tested for 

strength and adequacy. 

Rock bolts and screen will be installed from a bolter machine. Jackleg and stoper drills will be available and 

used in areas the bolter cannot access or during times of maintenance. 

Cable bolts will be installed in intersections and along sub-level LH sill drifts when required. Cable bolts 

may be installed behind the development crew as to maintain the advance rate of the drift. Intersections 

located in poor ground conditions will be reinforced with shotcrete and cable bolts prior to development of 

the intersection. Cable bolts will be drilled with a long hole drill and installed from a scissor deck manually. 

Shotcrete application is not expected to require quantities that justify an on-site shotcrete batch plant, and 

pre-mixed bags of shotcrete have been budgeted for the project. Mobile shotcrete machines will apply 

shotcrete to the underground workings as needed. 

16.8.4 Mucking 

Three LHD sizes are scheduled for the Cerro Blanco project. Generally, the largest LHD will be used to 

perform the task where possible to maximize efficiencies, and smaller units will be used in areas the larger 

units do not fit. The largest LHD with a nominal 4.0 m3 (10 t) bucket capacity will be used for primary ramp 

development and excavation of other larger development headings or stopes. Additionally, the largest LHD 

will load trucks from remuck bays. Bluestone has already acquired two of these units from an adjacent 

operation. The mid-size LHD has a 3.0 m3 (7 t) bucket capacity and will be used for material handling in 

smaller crosscut and ore development headings. The smallest LHD has a 2.0 m3 (4 t) bucket capacity and 

will be used to muck out MCF resue stopes. 

LHDs will typically muck a blasted round to a nearby remuck bay to clear the working face prior to ground 

support installation. Rock temporarily stored in the remuck is then loaded into a haul truck. Where 

development headings are proximal to MCF stopes, development waste rock will get trammed to the MCF 

stope for backfill. When available, LHDs will direct load trucks from the face. 

Mucking will be performed by LHD machines for all MCF and waste development drifts. In LH stopes, an 

LHD equipped with remote control will be utilized to keep personnel away from unsupported ground. Muck 

will be hauled at a maximum of 200 m to a nearby remuck drift or directly into haul trucks. When applicable, 

waste rock will be hauled directly to empty LH stopes that are ready for non-structural backfill placement. 

16.8.5 Hauling 

Muck will be hauled to surface by 30 t underground haul trucks. Trucks will be loaded at remuck stations 

by LHD machines. In most cases, trucks will be restricted to loading at remuck stations due to the increase 

back height requirements for LHDs to load over the side of the truck box. Trucks will haul muck to surface

Page 16-54 

 

and dumped in ore and waste piles, to be re-handled by surface equipment for transport to the mill site. 

When possible, development waste will be hauled directly to stopes for placement as backfill. 

16.8.6 Backfill 

Backfilling strategy will provide structural fill to primary longhole stopes, longitudinal longhole stopes, and 

sill pillars. Non-structural fill will be placed in secondary longhole stopes, MCF stopes, and abandoned 

working areas. 

Permitting constraints require all potentially acid generating (PAG) waste rock from mining to be 

permanently stored underground. As such, priority will be given to placing mined waste rock back 

underground as structural and non-structural backfill in the form of CRF and loose rock fill (LRF). Any 

remaining backfill requirements will be met with cemented paste fill generated from mill tailings.  

Life of mine backfill requirements are (distribution by tonnage): 

 Loose Rock Fill   52% 

 Cemented rock fill  27% 

 Cemented Paste Fill  21%. 

16.8.6.1 Loose Rock Fill 

LRF is the primary backfill method at Cerro Blanco. LRF consists of blasted waste rock from the 

underground workings and is not subjected to any crushing, screening, or cement addition. LRF will report 

to excavations which do not require any structural support from backfill, such as secondary LH or MCF. 

LRF will be delivered to stopes by either truck or LHD depending on location, back height, and activity. 

Whenever possible waste will be directly hauled to an empty stope to minimize re-handling of material 

brought to surface for temporary storage. It has been assumed that 50% of all LRF hauled underground 

will be on back-haul from trucks delivering ore to surface, and 50% will be from dedicated waste haulage 

trips. 

16.8.6.2 Cemented Rock Fill  

CRF will be prepared on surface in a ~60 m3/hr batch plant located adjacent to the waste stockpile 

immediately outside the south mine portal. Mine waste will be crushed and screened to 2" minus at the 

waste stockpile and loaded into the batch plant via front end loader. Trucks equipped with ejector beds 

and/or slinger units will deliver CRF to empty stopes underground requiring structural backfill. Backfill trucks 

will be washed on exit from the mine to remove any cement product and return to the batch plant for 

additional loads. 

16.8.6.3 Paste Backfill 

The overall paste backfill philosophy is to pump thickened slurry from the mill to the surface paste plant, 

where vacuum filtration, cement addition, mixing and paste pumping/distribution will be carried out. A five 

(5) inch (127 mm) pipe line distribution system will be installed to deliver paste fill from the paste plant, 

through a booster pump, and to the underground workings to be placed in empty longhole stopes.

According to the LOM plan, the Cerro Blanco mine will operate at an approximate annual production rate 

of 459,600 t/y. The paste plant is designed to meet a peak of 62 m3/h (t/h). Paste delivery will be an 

intermittent exercise, where campaigned fills are required only after stopes are fully mucked out and 

prepared with fill fences. As a result, backfilling will be conducted with an average utilization much lower 

than peak design capacity. 

Paste backfill bench strength testing was carried out for whole tails as well as tails with a 20% aggregate 

addition. Aggregate addition did provide higher strength tails at a lower cement content; however, higher 

capital and operating cost of this system precluded the addition of an aggregate paste product in the 

feasibility study. 

Typical fill strength requirements with span of openings were used to derive recommended cement content. 

Life of mine stope tonnages falling into each stope width categories were evaluated to determine an 

average life of mine cement requirement of 8.8% 

The target strength for LH stopes after 14 days of curing is shown in Table 16-23.

Once transported to the paste plant, tailings will be further prepared for paste production through a two-

stage dewatering process. The tailings of increased solids content after thickening and pressure filtration 

will be mixed with binder at a specified ratio. Like tailings diversion, the paste plant will operate on a 

continuous basis while pouring underground. Although the process will be automated, operators will be 

required to ensure that the equipment operates properly; they will also be responsible for paste sample 

collection and analysis for comparison against quality targets. If the measured paste quality does not meet 

the specification, the operator will make changes to the process to bring the quality back in-line with the 

requirements. 

The paste plant consists of two multilevel buildings. Contained within the first building will be the major and 

supporting pieces of equipment required to produce filter cake for storage onto a stockpile. The second 

building will contain all major and supporting equipment to create paste backfill from stockpiled filter cake. 

Views of the paste plant are shown in Figure 16-22; and Figure 16-23 shows simplified flow diagrams for 

the mixing areas of the paste plant.

Paste backfill is pumped from the paste plant and up the mountain adjacent to the paste plant along a 660 

m overland pipeline to a booster pump station located above the orebodies, in a location central to the 

North and South Zone return air raise collars. The booster pump station is located at a distance and 

elevation such that a paste with yield stress of 400 Pa can be pumped from the paste plant to the booster 

pump station with 135 bar operating discharge pressure. 

Outside the booster pump station, an automatic switch-over station will be used to direct flow to either the 

North or South Zone raise collars and directed down the raise in 5 inch schedule 80 pipe. Once 

underground, distribution of the paste to the various working areas will be accomplished by manual switch-

overs from the main trunk lines to the level piping and eventually the stope piping. Instrumentation will be 

installed in key locations to report pressure data back to the plant operator. Manual valves will be installed 

just before the stopes to allow for diversion of flush water away from the stope to a containment area. 

The paste backfill distribution system includes two surface-to-underground cased boreholes to supply paste 

to the underground workings. The second borehole will be constructed as backup, which is considered 

good industry practice. 

Once underground, the paste backfill travels through a network of pipelines to reach the locations where 

the paste is needed. The main distribution piping is referred to as trunk piping and transports the paste to 

the various underground mining levels. The trunk piping essentially includes all the lateral piping 

connections between the inter-level boreholes underground as well as the surface piping from the past 

plant to the surface borehole collars. 

Level and low-pressure piping is used to transport the paste backfill from the main trunk piping to the extents 

of each mining level. This piping is less heavily utilized and has a lower wear allowance than the trunk 

piping. Stope piping is used within the cross-cuts to transport the paste backfill from the level piping to the 

discharge points at the stope entrances. The stope piping has the lowest pressure requirements and is 

utilized the least of the underground piping (P&C, 2018). 

The general layout of the paste plant and overland distribution is shown in Figure 16-24.

16.8.6.4 Sill Pillars 

In areas where mining is to take place beneath a backfilled stope such as in underhand cut and fill mining 

or mining up against a sill pillar, a structural sill pillar will be constructed using a combination of high strength 

cemented paste fill, rock bolts, and sill mats, to achieve a minimum combined strength of 2 MPa. The 

following sill pillar preparations are recommended. 

1. Spread 30 cm of prep fill over the floor to act as a sacrificial blast curtain to protect the structural 

fill from mining activities in the cut below 

2. Lay 10 cm - 20 cm aperture wire mesh on the floor and pin to the corners of the drift 

3. Erect 1.8 m Dwyidag rock bolts on a 1.2 m spacing through-out the drift, with plates on either end 

and on either side of the wire mesh placed on the floor 

4. Use twine to tie rock bolts standing vertically, and 

5. Erect a fill barricade and fill the excavation with high strength paste fill, minimum 10% cement. 

16.8.6.5 Backfill Fences 

Backfill fences will be required to control paste flow in a stope and prevent seepage into the mine workings. 

Backfill fences will be constructed by miners using a combination of wire cables, mesh, Fabrene, shotcrete, 

and muck piles. Two sets of 15 mm wire cable are used to weave a net, which loops through eyebolts drilled 

0.5 m apart along the floor, back, and walls of the drift. Fabrene is placed in front of the cables and then

Page 16-60 

 

sandwiched with wire mesh also tied into the eyebolts. The perimeter of the backfill fence is then sprayed 

with 0.1 m of shotcrete to seal the edges. It is expected that stopes will be producing water in some areas 

of the mine so this design allows any build-up of water to drain through the Fabrene and wire mesh in the 

centre of the fill fence. Two muck piles are also added to the construction, one larger pile pushed against 

the fence to reduce stresses during initial pour, and a second smaller muck pile slightly behind the first to 

catch and direct any spillage.

16.10.2 Contract Mine Labour 

All labour positions required for lateral and vertical development, as well as production stoping, will be 

provided by contract labour during pre-production and the first two years of production. During this time 

owner labour force will consist of key management positions, technical services teams, and an underground 

construction crew responsible for capital installations. Contracted supervision will transition to the local

workforce over time, as the mine staff becomes adequately trained. Experienced expatriate or regional 

professional training staff will be employed through the life of mine to train local labour for safe and efficient 

activities within the mine.

16.11 Mine Production Schedule 

16.11.1 Schedule Optimization 

The criteria used for scheduling underground mine production at the Cerro Blanco mine were as follows: 

 The mine will operate three 8-hour shifts per day, 365 days per year 

 An average annual mill feed production rate of 456 kt/a was scheduled, including ore from 

development and stopes 

 Provide enough production faces to support a daily mine production rate of an average of 1,250 

tpd  

 Target the mining blocks with higher profitability in the early stages of mine life to improve project 

economics, 

 Minimize mobile equipment requirements by smoothing ore and waste development, and 

 Production ramp up of 50%, 65%, 90%, 100% of total 1,250 t/d production rate over first four 

months 

Minemax iGantt™ scheduling software was used to optimize the mine production schedule by maximizing 

the NPV, subject to constraints including maximum lateral development rates, maximum production rates,

maximum backfill rates, minimum backfill cure times, and extraction sequence. Summary of iGantt 

scheduling constraints are listed below: 

 1,000 lateral metres per month 

 60 vertical metres per month, and 

 80 metres per ramp per month. 

The mine schedule was also developed to respect site wide dewatering activities by limiting vertical mine 

advance to match surface dewatering well placements around the mine. Table 16-27 outlines the restriction 

placed on level development as part of the mine schedule.

Backfill and curing is not a part of the cycle times stated above given not all stopes receive the same fill 

material or cure period. Backfilling cycle times were added to the production and development cycle time, 

by fill type. Paste backfill was scheduled at an average 34 m3/hr delivery plus a 14 day cure time. Cemented 

rock fill was scheduled at 11, 16, and 40 m3/hr mucking rate depending on which LHD or truck is delivering

the fill material, plus a three day cure time. Loose fill was scheduled at 11, 16, and 40 m3/hr mucking rate 

depending on which LHD or truck is delivering the fill material, with no cure time. 

Development, production, and backfill cycle times were added together to realize a total cycle time for each 

mine object, the result of which was imported to iGantt software for application to the mine schedule. 

16.11.2 Mine Schedule 

Development and production ramp-up were modelled using initial periods of reduced productivities. Pre-

production scheduling guidelines were established to: 

 Ensure sufficient development for sustaining ore production when plant construction and 

commissioning will be complete 

 Include only development that was required for pre-production, and 

 Adequate LH stope preparation and initiation of longhole mining in selected locations. 

A number of schedule iterations and manual adjustments to the sequence were made to produce a robust, 

sensible, and realistic schedule. 

The schedule targets the upper portion of the Cerro Blanco deposit early in the mine life. By targeting the 

upper portion, the pre-production period is reduced to 12 months. Multiple iterations and decline designs 

were considered in pre-production schedule optimization and it was found that 12 months was required to 

sustain ramp up and steady state 1,250 t/d production rate while achieving target ounce profiles for initial 

production years.  

Final results of the iGantt schedule were organized such that physical metres, tonnes and ounces were 

broken down into different categories for direct use in the cost model. From the final schedule, cost model 

requirements including items such as the mining fleet, workforce, consumables, ventilation, pumping, and 

power were determined and used to develop costs from first principals. Reports were generated monthly 

and then summed into quarterly and annual totals for financial modeling. 

16.11.2.1 Mine Development 

Total underground capital and sustaining lateral waste development are 4,560 m and 15,350 m, 

respectively. Underground capital development averages 1,427 m/yr or 6.7 m/d from Year -1 to Year 8 

when all underground capital is completed. Lateral waste development averages 786 m/yr or 3.1 m/d Year 

-1 to Year 8.  

Total ore sub-level development is 58,135 m and averages 6,459 m/yr or 21.7 m/d over the eight year ore 

production period.  

Annual ore and waste development is shown in Figure 16-25.

16.11.2.3 Mine Backfill 

Mine Backfill required a LOM placement of 1.95 M m3 of fill material. 52% of backfill is loose rock, 27% is 

cemented rock fill, and the remaining 21% is cemented paste fill. Cemented rock fill is prioritized in the early 

mine life over paste fill to return mined PAG waste underground as soon as possible. There is no permitting 

constraint requiring an immediate return of PAG waste underground, however, limiting the surface stockpile 

footprint and capacity dictates this necessity. Figure 16-28 depicts the mine backfill schedule by fill type.

16.11.3 Pre-Production Mine Development 

Mine development is divided into two periods: pre-production development (prior to commercial production) 

and ongoing development (during commercial production). The objective of pre-production development is 

to provide access to high grade areas and prepare enough resources to support the mine production rate 

once commercial production commences. 

Pre-production development is scheduled to: 

 Rehabilitate mine workings 

 Develop a decline and ramp 

 Provide level access and infrastructure, and 

 Raise services.

FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

Page 16-72 

 

16.11.3.1 Rehabilitate Mine Workings 

During pre-production development crews will rehabilitate existing underground development by check 

scaling, spot bolting, and debagging mesh. Intersections that do not have the required long term ground 

support requirements will be outfitted with the appropriate bolts and cables. QP site visits and review of site 

photos indicate that conditions of installed ground support are in generally good standing, however, 

corroding split sets installed in the mine ramps will need to be supplemented with appropriate long term 

rock bolts as stated in Section 16.3 of this report. It is estimated that 50% of all existing mine workings will 

require rehabilitation to meet the FS ground support standards. 

16.11.3.2 Develop a Decline and Ramp 

Previous mine development efforts started ramping from 444 masl to 430 masl in the North Zone. This 

ramp will continue at depth, splitting in two directions at the current face. One ramp will continue on azimuth 

towards to the South zone until it is approximately below the South Zone fresh air raise for fresh air 

connection, where it will begin spiraling down to access all South Zone mine levels. The other face will turn 

to the north and begin a spiral ramp to service all North Zone mine levels. Pre-production decline 

development will access levels 360 in the South Zone and 390 in the North Zone. Approximately one half 

of all reserve ounces exist above these elevations. 

16.11.3.3 Provide Level Access and Infrastructure 

Mine levels spaced 20 m apart will be developed with access, footwall, and initial crosscuts to provide 

access for mobile equipment. Auxiliary development including remucks, electrical bays, refuge chambers, 

sumps, and vent drives will be developed on these levels to provide all supporting infrastructure required 

for a quick ramp up of production. 

Pre-production efforts for mine dewatering will include the development of ramp catch sumps and 

permanent level sump stations. The main booster station in the North Zone will be developed and 

constructed with South Zone booster station following shortly into production. 

16.11.3.4 Raise Services 

Mine ramping network is separated into two zones, North and South, and as such a secondary egress will 

be required for each zone. At the 455 bypass level there are two portals available for egress, however, for 

additional safety the S1 raise is not planned for use in long term mine ventilation plans and will be equipped 

with adequate infrastructure to permit quick and safe secondary egress from the mine in the event of 

emergency. Fresh air raise extensions within the mine will be equipped with raise ladders to provide 

secondary egress from production levels. Raise ladders will meet all safety specifications outlined in the 

Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia (HSRC BC) including offset platforms 

spaced no more than 7.5 m in length. 

Main dewatering and paste delivery lines will be routed through the exhaust raises. During pre-production 

15 cm dewatering lines and 12.7 cm paste lines will be installed in one exhaust raise of each North and 

South Zone. Given existing raises were developed by Alimak and are fully bolted, an Alimak crew will be 

required to re-enter the raises to install the piping and supports. This activity will be campaigned for piping 

in exhaust raises and ladder installations in the fresh air raises. On mine levels the piping will be 

appropriately connected or teed and capped for later use.

The ventilation system designed for Cerro Blanco as described in Section 16.8.1 utilizes a push-pull 

approach with primary fans mounted to collars of ventilation raises to direct volumes of fresh and return air 

in and out of the mine. During pre-production one additional 3.0 m return air raise will be developed in the 

South Zone to provide an exhaust route for dirty air, as well as a conduit for installing dewatering and paste 

lines described in the next sub section. No fan will be installed on this raise at this time, however collar 

preparations will be made during construction for the future addition of one surface mounted exhaust fan. 

The fresh air raise will be equipped with one of two planned surface mounted fresh air fans coupled to a 

mine air cooling unit, details of which are described in Section 16.8.1. 

The North Zone will be equipped with one exhaust fan and one fresh air fan placed on the return air and 

fresh air raise respectively. Both raises will ultimately be equipped with two parallel fans and surface 

preparations for expansion will be made during pre-production to avoid any future disruptions to mine 

ventilation.

by grade during the year of production.

17 Process Description / Recovery Methods 

Bluestone has developed a recovery method for their Cerro Blanco project to process run-of-mine (ROM) 

material and produce gold (Au) and silver (Ag) doré. The recent metallurgical test program completed at 

Base Metallurgical Labs in Kamloops, BC (BL0246), summarized in Section 13, has demonstrated that 

gravity concentration followed by cyanide leach, carbon adsorption/desorption and electrowinning can yield 

an average overall recovery of 96% Au and 85 % Ag. Results from this test program were used to develop 

the corresponding process design criteria, mechanical equipment list, flowsheets and operating costs. 

The process plant will include: 

 Three stages of crushing, 

 Two stages of grinding with hydrocyclone size classification, 

 Gravity concentration, 

 Cyanide leaching and carbon adsorption using carbon-in-pulp (CIP), 

 Cyanide destruction, dewatering, storage of drystack tailings or deposition underground as paste, 

 Carbon acid wash, elution and regeneration, and 

 Electrowinning and refining. 

The primary crushing plant will have a throughput of 1,250 tpd with average life of mine (LOM) head grades 

of 8.5 g/t Au and 32.2 g/t Ag. The crushing circuit will operate at an availability of 65%, resulting in an hourly 

throughput of 80.1 t/h. The milling, gravity, leaching and CIP circuits will operate 24 hours per day, 365 

days per year at an availability of 92%, resulting in an hourly throughput of 56.6 t/h. The carbon plant will 

process 4 tonnes of loaded carbon daily to produce gold (Au) and silver (Ag) doré. 

The three-stage crushing circuit will reduce the material down to a product size of 80% passing (P80) 8.3 

mm and the two-stage grinding circuit will target a final P80 grind size of 50 µm. A batch gravity concentrator 

will be installed in the secondary ball mill circuit to recover any gravity recoverable gold. Ground slurry will 

then be leached with cyanide and the gold-cyanide complexes will be adsorbed onto the pores of activated 

carbon in a CIP circuit. The loaded carbon will then be washed with hydrochloric acid and stripped under 

pressure using a hot 1% sodium hydroxide solution. The resulting pregnant gold and silver solution will be 

subjected to electrowinning and the recovered precious metal sludge will be refined in an induction furnace 

to produce gold and silver doré. Leached slurry from the CIP circuit will be treated with the SO2/Air cyanide 

destruction process, and the final tailings will be pressure filtered to a moisture content of 18.6% and 

transferred to a drystack tailings facility or mixed with cement to produce paste to be deposited 

underground. 

17.1 Introduction 

The recovery method will consist of the following unit operations: 

 Primary Crushing – A vibrating grizzly feeder and 895 mm x 660 mm jaw crusher in open circuit, 



 

 

CERRO BLANCO PROJECT 
FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT 

 

 

Prepared by JDS ENERGY & MINING INC. 

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 17-2 

 

 Secondary / Tertiary Crushing – Two stages of cone crushing in closed circuit with a double deck 

vibrating screen, producing a final product P80 of 8.3 mm, 

 Crushed Material Bin and Reclaim – A 24 hour live capacity bin (1,250 t) with two reclaim belt 

feeders feeding the primary grinding circuit, 

 Primary Grinding – A 3.66 m diameter x 6.1 m long ball mill in open circuit, producing a T80 transfer 

size of 300 µm, 

 Secondary Grinding – A 3.66 m diameter x 6.1 m long ball mill in reverse closed circuit with a 

cluster of hydrocyclones, producing a final product target P80 of 50 µm, 

 Gravity Concentration and Intensive Leach – A semi-continuous batch gravity concentrator to 

recover gravity recoverable gold from the ball mill cyclone underflow followed by intensive leach of 

the gravity concentrate, 

 Pre-leach Thickening – A 12 m diameter high-rate thickener to achieve an underflow solids 

density of 50% prior to leaching, 

 Pre-oxidation – An agitated tank sparged with oxygen to oxidize the slurry prior to leaching, 

 Cyanide Leaching – Five agitated leach tanks, giving 48 hours of retention time to leach gold and 

silver into solution, 

 Carbon in Pulp (CIP) – Eight CIP tanks, providing 6 hours of retention time to adsorb gold and 

silver cyanide complexes onto the pores of activated carbon, 

 Carbon Elution and Regeneration – Acid wash of carbon to remove inorganic foulants, elution 

(strip) of carbon to produce a precious gold and silver rich solution, and thermal regeneration of 

carbon to remove organic foulants, 

 Gold and Silver Refining – Precious metal electrowinning (sludge production), filtration, drying, 

and refining to produce gold and silver doré, 

 Cyanide Destruction – Two agitated tanks, one operating and one standby, to reduce the CNWAD 

(weak acid dissociable) concentration in the CIP tailings to < 1.0 mg/L with sodium metabisulphite 

for SO2, air, lime and copper sulphate, and 

 Final Tailings Dewatering – A filter plant to reduce final tailings to a moisture content of 18.6% for 

drystacking or paste production. 

17.2 Plant Design Criteria 

17.2.1 Process Design Criteria 

The Process Design Criteria and Mass Balance detail the annual production capabilities, major mass flows 

and capacities, and availabilities for the crushing and process plants. Consumption rates for major operating 

and maintenance consumables can be found in the operating cost estimate described in Section 22. Key 

process design criteria from Section 13 are summarized below in Table 17-1.

17.4 Process Plant Description 

17.4.1 Crushing 

Material from the underground mining operations will feed a crushing plant that consists of three stages of 

crushing. The plant will process 80 t/h of material, operate 16 hours per day and produce a final product 

P80 of 8.3 mm. 

17.4.1.1 Primary Crushing 

Run-of-mine material will be dumped onto a 500 mm static grizzly. Undersize material will flow into a 15 m3 

dump pocket, while oversize material will be removed for later size reduction using a rock breaker. A 

vibrating grizzly feeder will draw material from the dump pocket at a rate of 80 t/h. The vibrating grizzly 

oversized material will feed directly into the 895 mm x 660 mm jaw crusher with an installed power of 75 

kW. The undersized -75 mm material will bypass the crusher and feed directly onto the screen feed 

conveyor. The primary crushing stage will produce a product P80 of approximately 62 mm at a crusher 

closed side setting (CSS) of 50 mm. 

The screen feed conveyor will collect crushed product from all three stages of crushing and feed a 1.5 m x 

5.0 m double-deck vibrating screen. The top deck of this crushed product screen will have an aperture size 

of 28 mm, and the +28 mm material will be conveyed to the secondary crusher. The bottom deck will have 

an aperture size of 11 mm, and the -28 mm, +11 mm material will be conveyed to the tertiary crusher. The 

-11 mm final product, at an estimated P80 of 8.3 mm, will discharge onto the bin feed conveyor and be 

transferred to the crushed material storage bin. 

17.4.1.2 Secondary Crushing 

Oversize material from the top deck of the crushed product screen will be transferred to the secondary 

crusher surge bin via the secondary crusher conveyor. The secondary crusher pan feeder will withdraw 

material from the bottom of the surge bin, depositing it into a standard cone crusher with an installed power 

of 90 kW. The secondary crusher will reduce the material using a CSS of 16 mm. Crushed product will 

discharge onto the screen feed conveyor and circulate back to the double-deck screen. 

17.4.1.3 Tertiary Crushing 

Oversize material from the bottom deck of the crushed product screen will be transferred to the tertiary 

crusher surge bin via the tertiary crusher conveyor. The tertiary crusher pan feeder will withdraw material 

from the bottom of the surge bin, depositing it into a short head cone crusher with an installed power of 90 

kW. Crushed product will discharge onto the screen feed conveyor and circulate back to the double-deck 

screen. 

17.4.2 Crushed Material Storage Bin 

The Crusher plant product, with a P80 of 8.3 mm, will be conveyed to the crushed material storage bin. The 

bin will provide 1,250 t, or twenty-four hours, of live storage capacity. Two belt feeders, located underneath 

the bin, will be installed with variable frequency drives (VFD) to control the reclaim rate feeding the primary 

grinding circuit. Each belt feeder will be capable of providing the total plant throughput of 56.6 t/h.

17.4.3 Grinding 

The grinding circuit will consist of a primary ball mill followed by a secondary ball mill. A gravity concentration 

circuit will be installed in the secondary ball mill circuit to recover any gravity recoverable gold. The primary 

ball mill will operate in open circuit, while the secondary ball mill will operate in reverse closed circuit with a 

cluster of hydrocyclones. Cyclone underflow will be processed through the gravity circuit. The grinding 

circuit will be able to process a nominal throughput of 56.6 t/h (fresh feed), producing a final product P80 of 

50 µm. 

17.4.3.1 Primary Grinding 

Reclaimed material from the crushed material storage bin will feed a 3.66 m diameter x 6.1 m long overflow 

ball mill via the ball mill feed conveyor. The mill will be installed with a 1,194 kW induction motor and a VFD 

to control the speed of the mill. A belt-scale on the feed conveyor will monitor feed rate. Reclaim water will 

be added to the ball mill to maintain the slurry charge in the mill at a constant density of 70%. Ground slurry 

will overflow the ball mill into the cyclone feed pump box, combining with secondary ball mill product and 

gravity concentrator tailings. The primary grinding circuit has been designed to produce a T80 transfer size 

of 300 µm. 

17.4.3.2 Secondary Grinding 

Slurry from the cyclone feed pump box will be pumped up to a cluster of eight (6 operating / 2 standby) 250 

mm hydrocyclones for size classification. The coarse cyclone underflow will be split into two streams, with 

75% of the slurry flowing by gravity to the secondary ball mill for additional grinding, and 25% feeding the 

gravity circuit. The fine cyclone overflow, at a final target product P80 of 50 µm, will be pumped to the pre-

leach thickener. The hydrocyclones have been designed for a 300% circulating load. 

Cyclone underflow will feed a 3.66 m diameter x 6.1 m long overflow ball mill with an installed power of 

1,194 kW. Ground slurry will overflow from the ball mill onto a trommel screen attached to the discharge 

end of the mill. The trommel screen oversize, consisting mainly of scats, will discharge into a trash bin for 

removal from the system, while the undersize will flow into the cyclone feed pump box. 

Both ball mills are identical in size to allow for common spares. 

17.4.3.3 Gravity Concentration 

A portion of the cyclone underflow will flow by gravity to the gravity concentrator feed screen. With an 

aperture size of 1 mm, the feed screen will remove any oversize particles prior to gravity concentration. The 

screen undersize will feed a semi-continuous batch gravity concentrator. Using high gravitational forces, 

high density gravity recoverable gold will collect in the concentrate cone, while lower density material will 

flow out of the tailings discharge port and combine with the gravity feed screen oversize in the gravity 

tailings pump box. The material will then be transferred to the cyclone feed pump box. 

The gravity concentrator will operate in ten-minute cycles. During a cycle, gravity recoverable gold will 

collect in the concentrate cone. At the end of the cycle, the gravity concentrator feed will be diverted to the 

gravity tailings stream, and the concentrate cone will be flushed with water, sending the concentrate to an 

intensive leach reactor for further concentration.

17.4.4 Pre-Leach Thickening 

Cyclone overflow, at the target cut size P80 of 50 µm, will flow onto a vibrating trash screen for removal of 

trash material. Oversize material will discharge into a trash bin, while screen undersize will flow by gravity 

to a 12 m diameter pre-leach thickener. Flocculant solution will be added to the thickener feed to promote 

the settling of fine solids. The high-rate thickener will thicken the slurry to 50% solids. The thickener 

underflow will be pumped to the pre-oxidation tank, while the thickener overflow will flow by gravity into the 

process water tank to be used as make-up water in the grinding circuit. 

17.4.5 Leaching 

Pre-leach thickener underflow will be pumped to a 6 m diameter x 8 m high pre-oxidation tank prior to 

leaching. Oxygen will be sparged into the bottom of the agitated tank and slurry will be conditioned for 2 

hours to oxidize sulphide minerals.  

Based on metallurgical testing, pre-oxidation will help reduce the consumption of dissolved oxygen during 

cyanidation, improving metallurgical recovery. It will also reduce sodium cyanide (NaCN) consumption by 

preventing the formation of thiocyanate and complexing some of the heavy metals such as iron. This step 

will also reduce reagent consumptions in the cyanide destruction circuit. 

The oxidized slurry will then flow to the first of five 10 m diameter x 12 m high agitated leach tanks. The 

leach circuit is designed to provide 48 hours of retention time. Lime slurry will be added to the first and 

second leach tanks at a rate of up to 1.71 kg/t to maintain protective alkalinity at a design pH of 11.0, 

preventing the creation of hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN). NaCN solution will be added to the circuit at a rate 

of up to 0.30 kg/t, while oxygen will be sparged in from the bottom of each tank to maintain dissolved oxygen 

(DO) above 20 mg/L. As the slurry progresses through the circuit, gold and silver will be leached into 

solution. 

Slurry from the leach circuit will then flow by gravity to the CIP circuit for carbon adsorption. 

17.4.6 Carbon in Pulp 

Leached slurry will flow into the first of eight 4.6 m diameter x 6.7 m high CIP tanks. Each tank will be 

installed with an agitator and an inter-stage screen pumpcell for retaining activated carbon. As the slurry 

flows through the eight CIP tanks, gold-cyanide and silver-cyanide complexes will be adsorbed onto the 

pores of activated carbon. The average carbon concentration in the CIP circuit is expected to be 

approximately 50 g/L to maximize adsorption. 

As the slurry proceeds through the circuit, metal values in the solution will progressively decrease. The 

carbon will be transferred countercurrent to the slurry flow to maximize precious metal recovery. 

Regenerated carbon, with the highest adsorption potential, will be introduced into the last CIP tank, 

interacting with the lowest concentrations of gold and silver. Loaded carbon, with the lowest adsorption 

potential, will be located in the first CIP tank, interacting with the highest concentrations of gold and silver. 

Once per day, loaded carbon from the first CIP tank will be pumped to the loaded carbon screen where the 

slurry will be separated with the carbon transferred to the acid wash circuit. The separated slurry will then 

flow by gravity back into the first CIP tank. Fresh activated carbon from the regeneration circuit will be 

pumped into the first CIP tank, becoming the last tank in the CIP train.

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 17-12 

 

The tailings stream from the last CIP tank will flow onto a stationary safety screen to capture any carbon 

particles that may have escaped the CIP circuit. Captured carbon particles will be collected in bins and 

processed to recover gold and silver. Safety screen undersize will then be pumped to the cyanide 

destruction circuit. 

17.4.7 Carbon Processing 

The carbon processing plant has been designed to process 4 tpd of loaded carbon, producing gold and 

silver doré. On average one batch of carbon will be processed through the acid wash, stripping and 

regeneration circuits. 

17.4.7.1 Acid Wash 

Loaded carbon from the CIP circuit will flow by gravity into a four-tonne capacity acid wash vessel 

constructed of fibre-reinforced plastic. The carbon will be treated with a circulating 3% hydrochloric acid 

(HCL) solution to remove calcium deposits, magnesium, sodium salts, silica, and fine iron particles. Organic 

foulants, such as oils and fats, are unaffected by the acid and will be removed after the elution step in the 

regeneration circuit using a horizontal electric kiln. 

During the acid wash cycle, the carbon will first be rinsed with fresh water. HCL solution will then be pumped 

from the dilute acid tank upward through the acid wash vessel, overflowing back into the dilute acid tank. 

The carbon will then be rinsed with fresh water to remove the remaining acid and any mineral impurities. 

A recessed impeller pump will transfer acid washed carbon from the acid wash vessel into the elution vessel 

using transport water. Carbon slurry will discharge directly into the top of the elution vessel. Under normal 

operation, only one acid wash and elution cycle will take place per day. 

17.4.7.2 Carbon Stripping (Elution) 

The carbon stripping (elution) process will utilize barren strip solution to strip the loaded carbon, creating a 

pregnant gold and silver solution which will be pumped through the electrowinning cells for precious metal 

recovery. The solution exiting the electrowinning cells will be circulated back to the barren solution tank for 

reuse. 

The strip vessel will be a carbon steel tank with a capacity to hold approximately four tonnes of carbon. 

During the strip cycle, solution containing approximately 1% sodium hydroxide and 0.1% NaCN, at a 

temperature of 140°C (284°F), will be pumped up through the strip vessel at a pressure of 450 kPa (65 psi). 

Solution exiting the top of the vessel will be cooled below its boiling point by the heat recovery heat 

exchanger. Heat from the outgoing solution will be transferred to the incoming cold barren solution prior to 

passing through the solution heater. An electric boiler will be used as the primary heating source. The strip 

will be complete in approximately 12 hours allowing additional strips to accommodate higher feed grade 

material. 

17.4.7.3 Carbon Regeneration 

The carbon regeneration circuit will thermally regenerate the stripped carbon, re-activating the pores and 

removing any organic foulants, such as oils and fats. Fresh activated carbon will be added to account for 

any carbon lost during the adsorption and desorption processes.

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 17-13 

 

A recessed impeller pump will transfer the stripped carbon from the elution vessel to the carbon sizing 

dewatering screen. The 1.2 m diameter vibratory screen doubles as a dewatering screen and a carbon 

sizing screen, where fine carbon particles will be removed. Oversize carbon from the screen will discharge 

by gravity into the regeneration kiln feed hopper. Screen undersize carbon, containing carbon fines and 

water, will drain by gravity into the carbon fines tank. Periodically, the carbon fines will be filtered and 

collected in bags and sent to a refinery to recover gold and silver. 

A horizontal electric kiln with residual heat dryer will be utilized to treat 4 t of carbon per day, equivalent to 

100% regeneration of stripped carbon. The regenerated carbon from the kiln will flow by gravity into the 

carbon quench tank, cooled by fresh water and/or carbon fines water, and pumped back to the CIP circuit.  

To compensate for carbon losses from attrition and impact, fresh carbon will be added to the carbon attrition 

tank and mixed with fresh water to activate the carbon pores. The fresh carbon will then drain into the 

carbon quench tank and combine with the regenerated carbon discharging from the kiln. 

17.4.8 Electrowinning and Refining 

Pregnant solution from the strip circuit will be pumped to the refinery for electrowinning, producing a gold 

and silver sludge. The sludge will then be filtered, dried and refined in an electric induction furnace, 

producing gold and silver doré bars. 

Pregnant solution will be pumped through two dual electrowinning cells operating in parallel. Gold and silver 

will plate on the pair of 36 stainless steel cathodes, while the barren solution will flow into the barren return 

tank and be pumped back to the barren solution tank for reuse. To prevent a build-up of impurities, a 15% 

daily bleed of barren solution will be pumped to the CIP circuit. 

Gold and silver rich sludge will periodically be washed off the stainless steel cathodes into the 

electrowinning sludge tank using high pressure water. Once the tank is filled, the sludge will be drained, 

filtered, dried, mixed with fluxes, and smelted in a 125 kW induction furnace, producing gold and silver doré. 

This process will take place within a secure and supervised area, and the precious metal product will be 

stored in a vault until shipped off site. 

17.4.9 Cyanide Destruction 

The cyanide destruction circuit will consist of two 5 m diameter x 5 m high mechanically-agitated tanks (1 

standby), each with a capacity to handle the full slurry flow for the required residence time of 1 hour. Cyanide 

will be destroyed using the SO2/Air process. Treated slurry from the circuit will then be pumped to the final 

tailings thickener. The cyanide destruction circuit will treat CIP tailings slurry, process spills from various 

contained areas, and process bleed streams. 

Oxygen will be sparged from near the bottom of the tanks, under the agitator impeller. Lime slurry will be 

added, if necessary, to maintain the optimum pH of 8.0 – 8.5 and copper sulphate (CuSO4) will be added 

as a catalyst, maintaining a 25 mg/L concentration in solution. A sodium metabisulphite (SMBS) solution, 

at a rate of up to 789 g/t, will be dosed into the system as the source of SO2. This system has been designed 

to reduce the CNWAD concentration to below 1.0 mg/L. 

17.4.10 Tailings Management 

Treated slurry from the cyanide destruction circuit will be pumped to the final tailings thickener and then 

pumped to a filter plant where the material will be reduced to a moisture content of 18.6%. The tailings will

Page 17-14 

 

then be transported to the DSTF or conveyed to the paste mixing plant. The excess water will be circulated 

back to the process water tank. 

17.4.11 Reagents Handling and Storage 

Reagents consumed within the plant will be prepared on-site and distributed via the reagent handling 

systems. These reagents include: sodium cyanide (NaCN), lime, lead nitrate (Pb2NO3), hydrochloric acid 

(HCl), caustic soda (NaOH), copper sulphate (CuSO4), sodium metabisulphite (SMBS), antiscalant, 

flocculant and activated carbon. All reagent areas will be bermed with sump pumps which will transfer any 

spills to their respective storage tanks. The reagents will be mixed, stored and then delivered to the 

thickener, leach, CIP, acid wash, elution, and cyanide destruction circuits. Dosages will be controlled by 

flow meters and manual control valves. The capacity of the storage tanks will be sized to handle one day 

of production. The reagents will be delivered in dry form, except HCl and antiscalant, which are delivered 

as solutions. 

Table 17-2 summarizes the reagents used in the process plant and their estimated daily consumption rates. 

The table also includes other major process consumables.

17.4.12 Air Supply 

An instrument and plant air system with four compressors and associated dryers, filters, and receivers will 

be provided and located in a compressor room inside the plant building. 

Oxygen will be used in the pre-oxidation, leach, CIP and cyanide destruction circuits and will be supplied 

by two oxygen generation systems. 

17.4.13 Water Supply and Consumption 

Overflow water from the pre-leach and tailings thickeners and filtrate from the filters will be used as process 

water. This water will have a low precious metals concentration and will be used predominantly in the

primary and secondary grinding circuits to dilute slurry to the required densities. Treated water will supply 

process make-up water, gland water, reagent make-up water and cooling water services in the strip circuit. 

A bleed of 25% of the thickener overflow water will be sent to the water treatment plant to reduce the buildup 

of chemicals and metals in the circuit. 

17.4.14 Control Philosophy  

The key design criteria for the instrumentation and control are to provide and implement sufficient 

supervisory and control to achieve design production rates, to enable stable process operations within 

design limits and to facilitate safe operation of all processes and equipment. 

Equipment and process will primarily be monitored and controlled remotely from a central control room 

situated in the process plant and a satellite control room situated in the primary crusher facilities. The control 

room operators will be able to input set points, open/close valves, start/stop 

motors/pumps/conveyors/equipment and visualize all alarms and interlocks via the process control 

system's human machine interface system. 

Equipment and process parameters will be monitored and automated when it is deemed critical for process 

productivity and quality or is required to support human, equipment or environmental safety functions. 

Equipment will be field operated, where it is only required for infrequent actuation or activation with no 

significant impact on process, equipment or safety. 

Intelligent type motor control centers will be located in electrical rooms throughout the facilities. A digital 

interface to the process control system will facilitate remote operation and monitoring of motor control center 

equipment. Field instrumentation and devices will be hardwired to the process control system via input and 

output modules. 

The site-wide process communication system will be an industrial Ethernet and fiber optic network, 

providing communication between the process controllers, the motor control centers, remote input and 

output modules and the operator's workstations and graphical interface consoles in the control rooms. 

The following areas and associated processes will be monitored and controlled: 

 Underground production, 

 Comminution and conveying, 

 Pre-leach thickening, pre-oxidation and leaching, 

 Absorption, desorption and refining, 

 Cyanide destruction, 

 Reagents, 

 Process and fire water, 

 Process and instrument air, and 

 Dewatering, filtering and paste backfill.

18.3 Site Geotechnical 

Stantec completed a series of evaluations on the site geotechnical information gathered prior to and during 

a 2018 site investigation to provide feasibility-level foundation recommendations for facility structures that 

range in both size (footprint) and anticipated loading conditions. Liquefaction potential analyses and soil 

bearing capacity analyses were conducted on the existing site soils. The soil bearing capacity analyses 

were developed using three methodologies: Terzaghi (1943), Hansen (1970), and Vesic (1973, 1975), 

which are each considered reliable methodologies employed in practice. Stantec estimated the amount of 

settlement anticipated to occur at locations throughout the plant area. The foundation designs also take 

into account the seismic design criteria for the site. The scope of this study was focused on the analysis of 

statically loaded foundations. 

Stantec's recommendations pertain to select primary and secondary structures for the following areas: 

 Primary crushing plant, including fine ore bin 

 Grinding circuit 

 Tanks and reactors associated with the carbon-in-pulp plant 

 Thickeners 

 Filter plant 

 Paste plant, and 

 Electrowinning (EW) plant. 

The Stantec assessment was used to prepare the concrete foundation estimates for the process plant and 

facilities installation. Recommendations for further geotechnical investigation work prior to detail 

engineering are included in capital costs under Section 21.7, and are detailed below: 

 Geophysical surveys, additional drilling with Cone Penetration Tests (CPTs), and additional test 

pitting to supplement the project-wide field campaign conducted to date  

 A project specific seismic hazard study due to presence of potentially liquefiable materials in the 

process plant area, and  

 Additional evaluations of the moisture content and Atterberg limits for strata with liquefaction 

potential, to better understand whether the material would be susceptible to liquefaction or display 

a cyclic softening behavior. 

Subsequent to the geotechnical investigation and liquefaction potential evaluations described above, 

settlement estimates will be updated for anticipated vibratory loads and seismically-induced ground 

motions.  

18.4 Fresh Water Supply 

Mine water will be the primary source of fresh water for the process plant, dust control, and for grey (treated 

water) water use for the site personnel facilities. The mine water will be treated in the existing water 

treatment plant prior to use as the site fresh water supply. On-site office facilities, mine dry, and staff /

contractor dining facilities will use the treated water for washing, laundry, and bathing. Drinking water and 

cooking water will be provided by purchasing potable bottled water from a local vendor. 

18.5 Surface Water Management 

Surface water infrastructure was developed to minimize the amount of precipitation and runoff coming into 

contact with potential contaminant sources during mine operations. Potential contaminant sources are 

areas where filtered tailings are stored and include the process plant and DSTF footprint. The water runoff 

from these areas is referred to as "contact" water. "Non-contact" water does not fall onto or runoff from 

these facilities. Currently, potential contact water sources are the DSTF and the Process Plant area. The 

Process Plant area is where filtered tailings will be produced, placed, and loaded into trucks prior to being 

offloaded at the DSTF. Contact water is either reused in the Process Plant or is sent to the WTP. Non-

contact water is released as surface water discharge at specified control points. The non-contact discharge 

locations also have capacity for sediment storage during smaller storm events. 

A total of 13 stormwater conveyance channel sections route stormwater toward seven ponding areas. The 

stormwater channels are lined with High-Performance Turf Reinforcement Mat (HPTRM), riprap, or 

concrete to prevent local scour during the design event. Concrete lining is limited to a section of the DSTF 

Collection Channel to reduce potential infiltration of contact water runoff. There are also two drop-inlet 

culverts, four box culverts, and four bridge structures to route water around trafficked areas. Six of these 

locations also discharge into riprap-lined energy dissipation structures to prevent local scour at outlet points 

or at the bottom of ponding areas. The seven ponding areas, which collect contact or non-contact water, 

are the:  

1. North Diversion Non-Contact Pond 

2. North Non-Contact Pond 

3. Process Plant Pond 

4. DSTF Low-Flow Pond and DSTF Stormwater Pond 

5. Existing South Cooling Pond  

6. Waste Rock Low-Flow Pond and Waste Rock Stormwater Attenuation Basin, and 

7. South Non-Contact Pond. 

Contact water is received by the Existing South Cooling Pond, Process Plant Pond, DSTF Low-Flow Pond, 

and DSTF Storm Water Pond while non-contact water is conveyed to the other ponds. The contact water 

ponds were initially sized to retain the 100-year, 24-hour storm and then were further evaluated as part of 

the site-wide water balance, which evaluated contact water runoff for the historic climate record from 1970 

to 2017. The channels and ponding areas surrounding the DSTF are shown on Figure 18-3.

Given the proximity of the site to two rivers – Quebrada Tempisque and Rio Tancushapa – a floodplain 

analysis was performed for the 100-year flood and for the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) events, which 

was calculated based on the Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) depth of 450 mm. The maximum 

water levels on site were approximately 1 m during the PMF. To prevent storm water inundation, levees will 

be built to protect existing mine facilities. The locations of the levees are shown on Figure 18-3. The design 

levee heights are 2 m above existing ground, based on available topographic data. In addition, raising 

select mine facilities approximately two meters above existing grade reduces the likelihood of inundating 

those areas. These facilities include: reagent storage and preparation area, filter plant, paste backfill plant, 

metallurgical lab, and fine ore bin. 

18.6 Site Water Balance 

The water balance includes the proposed management of water for balancing dewatering and water 

recycling of contact water during operations. Other potential water uses requiring non-potable water, 

including dust suppression water or water requirements for underground operations, were not simulated. 

This water may be taken from the WTP, from non-contact water ponds, or other local ponds developed 

during construction periods. The water balance was designed utilizing the management strategy of 

separating contact and non-contact water while integrating planned mine dewatering and mine processing 

water requirements. Cerro Blanco is a water positive mine, meaning there is more water than needed for 

mining operations. Excess water is sent to the WTP and discharged to Quebrada Tempisque or is sent to 

the reinjection well field. 

The water balance modeling analysis was performed in GoldSim (Version 12.1). The primary modeling 

inputs included runoff areas reporting to the contact water ponds, precipitation and pan evaporation data 

collected from two weather stations within 5 km of the Project site, the proposed dewatering schedule, water 

inflows and outflows to the Process Plant and Filter Plant, and inflows and outflows from the WTP. The 

conceptual water balance model is shown on Figure 18-4.

The water balance model was used to: 

1. Validate the proposed reinjection well schedule as provided in the Cerro Blanco Dewatering and 

Water Disposal Report (Stantec, 2018c) 

2. Estimate the required capacity of the contact water ponds under typical operating conditions, and 

3. Evaluate the capacity to use collected contact water as makeup water in the Process Plant and 

assess the demand for treatment of contact water in the WTP. 

The water storage capacity for each pond was confirmed to be sufficiently sized for the normal operating 

conditions simulated in the water balance. 

18.7 Dewatering and Injection Infrastructure 

Dewatering and injection wells, and supporting infrastructure required for their operation, will be installed 

at the project site as per the dewatering plan outlined in Section 16.7.4. The schedule for wells installation 

is provided in Table 16-21. 

18.8 Water Treatment Infrastructure 

18.8.1 Mine Water Treatment Plant 

The existing water treatment plant (WTP) in use at Cerro Blanco is capable of treating up to 1,500 gpm. It 

is currently limited to a discharge rate of 1,500 gpm into Quebrada Tempisque due to permit limitations, but 

treatment capacity can potentially be increased by adding modules to the treatment plant. The plant is 

designed for removal of arsenic using co-precipitation with ferric salt. The treatment regimen at the plant 

includes chemical oxidation, pH adjustment, ferric iron addition, and solids separation to achieve removal 

of dissolved arsenic from the various wastewater streams that are treated at the facility. An inflow to the 

treatment plant is expected to be the process water bleed from the process plant tailings thickener overflow 

stream, which is expected to have a flow rate of up to 270 gpm. 

Process modifications to the treatment plant have been included to achieve the treatment objectives for 

removal of mercury and copper from the process plant effluent stream. The proposed modifications to the 

plant will likely utilize TMT-15©, a sulfide compound that is widely utilized in industrial wastewater 

applications for removal of divalent heavy metal cations such as mercury and copper as detailed in a 

technical memorandum titled "Cerro Blanco WTP — Cost Estimate for Treatment of Process Plant Effluent 

for Mercury and Copper (Stantec, 2018f)". 

The primary purpose of the treatment facility is to treat mine water to an allowable standard for discharge 

directly to the environment. The treatment facility also cools mine water to ambient temperature through a 

series of cooling ponds. The cooled, treated water that will be used in the process and other facilities will 

be pumped from the treatment facility to a raw water storage tank that will also serve as the fire water 

storage tank. The raw water outlet will be located above the fire water reservoir level to ensure a continual 

reservoir of fire water. The raw water/fire water storage tank will be located a short distance from the 

process plant. The elevation difference between the tank and service points is insufficient for a gravity flow 

system; therefore, pumps will be installed to provide the required pressure at the distribution locations.

18.8.2 Potable Water Treatment 

Potable water for drinking and cooking will be provided by purchasing potable bottled water from a local 

vendor, eliminating the need for a potable water treatment facility. 

18.8.3 Sewage Treatment 

Black water and waste water will be handled by standard septic tank collection systems using natural 

breakdown bioreactors prior to discharge. The sanitary waste from buildings at the plant and main 

infrastructure site will drain to a buried septic system area below the process area. An existing bio-reactor 

tank is already installed and connected with buried sewer pipe for the existing site facilities buildings. An 

additional unit will be installed and connected to the new facilities that are being added for the project. 

Sewage will be treated, separated, and the liquid discharged. Water for septic operation and wash use will 

be made up from the raw water supply. 

18.9 Support Infrastructure 

18.9.1 Fuel Storage and Distribution 

An existing diesel fuel storage facility is installed at site for the existing power generators. It consists of two 

10,000 US gallon (approx. 37,500 L) tanks within a concrete containment area and includes fuel dispensing 

equipment. The existing fuel storage facility will be expanded by installing an additional 10,000 US gallon 

diesel tank and increasing the containment area to accommodate the additional tank. 

This expanded fuel storage facility will service the underground mining and site surface fleet with capacity 

for approximately 14 days of mobile equipment operations. In the event of an extended grid power outage 

(> 12 hrs), the fuel storage capacity for the backup generators is two days running all critical support loads. 

In the event that a power outage occurs for a duration of longer than 24 hours, the mine will cease 

operations, be evacuated and the UG ventilation and cooling systems will be turned off. This will extend the 

fuel capacity to maintain critical mine dewatering and process plant activities on generator power, without 

fuel replenishment, for up to about five to seven days. 

Any gasoline powered vehicles will be fueled in Asunción Mita. 

18.9.2 Explosive Storage 

The existing explosives storage and magazine will be used throughout the mine life. It is located west of 

the South portal on the southwest side of the property. The warehouse capacity is sufficient for 

approximately 50 days of support for mining operations: 

 Explosives = 3,000 bags x 25 kg each = 75,000 kg 

 Detonators = 10,000 units. 

Monthly deliveries will be organized based on mining operations requirements. The storage building is of 

concrete and reinforced concrete block construction surrounded by earthen / rock berms.

18.9.3 Solid and Hazardous Waste Management 

18.9.3.1 Non-Hazardous Solid Waste 

Landfill disposal is proposed for inert solid waste disposal, as per current practices, for construction and 

operations. Current waste management practices at site include valorization, recycling, and reuse, with this 

material taken off site. The current landfill facility will be expanded to accommodate the remaining non-

hazardous construction waste. The facility will continue for operations and be reclaimed and closed at the 

end of the mine life. 

Currently, a temporary facility is located north west of the site infrastructure, where the new 69 kV substation 

is going to be located. This facility stores the WTP sludge waste until it can be disposed of underground. A 

new temporary facility will be constructed next to the construction landfill to store the existing and future 

operations WTP sludge until it is placed underground for permanent disposal during mine operations and 

closure. 

The current landfill will be used for construction waste, as well as for operations. The location at the top of 

the hill negates the need for water diversions, as it is not located in a catchment area. The landfill consists 

of a trench cut with a dozer, and will be periodically compacted with a dozer to reduce the volume. Once 

an excavated trench reaches capacity, it will be backfilled and compacted with a minimum cover of 1.5 m 

of excavated material. A new trench will then be constructed adjacent to the old trench, as required. 

18.9.3.2 Hazardous Waste Disposal 

Anticipated hazardous wastes consist primarily of waste oils, process reagents and laboratory chemicals. 

Waste oils will be incinerated or recycled by the supplier. Most reagents and chemicals that require disposal 

will be disposed of within the process, and the remainder to be recycled with supplier. 

All cyanide containers or packaging and other reagent containers will be washed using fresh water. 

Washing will be done in contained areas at the re-agent warehouse and storage area. Washing of cyanide 

containers will comply with the International Cyanide Code standards for disposal of cyanide products. 

Neutralized products and containers will be disposed of or recycled with the supplier in accordance with 

local regulations. 

Laboratory fire assay wastes may contain small amounts of lead. These wastes along with any lead 

contaminated dust from the bag houses will be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 

Clean up of spills of hazardous materials on site will be given the highest operating priority and will generally 

involve the excavation of contaminated soils, neutralization of the affected site, and disposal and/or 

neutralization of the affected soils on site or at a licensed facility off site. The site surface equipment will be 

made available for use in such circumstances. 

18.9.4 Site Buildings 

Buildings will be equipped with smoke, carbon monoxide and heat detectors and appropriate chemical fire 

extinguishers.

18.9.4.1 Existing Facilities 

There are a number of existing facilities on the Project site that will continue to be used during the 

construction and operations period. These are described in the following sections. 

18.9.4.1.1 Administration Office  

An existing administration building on site will continue to be used by the site management team and 

administrative staff. It is a cinderblock construction building with 10 offices, a meeting room, open working 

area, bathroom facilities, and a reception desk and area. General staff with specific functions, such as the 

environmental staff, and various technical staff will use continue using existing facilities at site.  

18.9.4.1.2 Security Office and Entrance Gate 

An existing security office for the security manager and monitoring of visual surveillance will continue to be 

used. It is a 20' container modified as a field office with a control room. The existing entrance gate will be 

closed off and de-commissioned once the new access road and site entrance are ready for use. 

18.9.4.1.3 Personnel Dry 

The site currently has a 60 person mine dry, with personnel change areas, showers, bathrooms and locker 

and PPE storage area. This will remain in place and become the process plant personnel dry facility during 

operations. 

18.9.4.1.4 Geology Offices 

A geology office on site houses the exploration and geology staff. It is made up of three modified 40' 

containers that have been converted into offices, in a U–shaped configuration with a roof covering to allow 

for an open working area to view and log core. 

18.9.4.1.5 Assay Laboratory Facility 

A complete sample prep and assay laboratory facility is currently under construction. It includes the 

complete lab equipment package purchased from the recently closed Marlin mine in Guatemala. It will serve 

as the main site metallurgical testing and analytical facility for the process plant and geology department. 

18.9.4.1.6 Clinic and Emergency Response Training Room 

A first aid clinic is currently under construction and will serve future operations. The facility has been 

designed with a 100 m2 room for emergency response training and includes a storage facility. The 

ambulance and fire truck will be parked at the ready, outside the process plant, within covered parking 

stalls. 

18.9.4.1.7 Safety Office and Training / Large Meeting Room 

An existing office building will house the site Health and Safety Coordinators and surface support technical 

staff. Adjacent to this building, there is an existing single room building which will serve as the site training 

facility. Site orientations and specialty staff training sessions will be held at this location.

18.9.4.1.8 Warehouse and Storage Facilities 

There are multiple storage areas and facilities currently at site. A small parts warehouse that services 

ongoing drilling programs and water treatment plant will continue to be used for the same purposes. 

An existing steel storage building will be used for spare parts and consumables storage. It consists of a 

steel storage shed, 11 m x 12 m x 4 m high, with a concrete floor and a lean-to for hazardous material 

storage and containment area (approximately 5.5 m x 6 m). The surrounding area will be cleared and fenced 

as a secure laydown area for large parts, and the building will be equipped with pallet racking and clerical 

offices for operations. 

Multiple lockable shipping containers that are currently used for secured parts storage will continue to be 

used for that purpose. 

18.9.4.1.9 Site Work Shop and Storage 

A maintenance facility, workshop, and storage area with a wash pad is located north of the WTP. It currently 

serves as the project site maintenance facility and truck shop; and it will continue as such until the new 

truck shop is constructed and in service in the first year of operations. Once the new truck shop is fully 

functional, this existing facility will continue to be the maintenance shop for the site facilities and any 

specialty work required for process plant equipment. Generally, process plant maintenance will be 

conducted at the process plant site, but specialty work, such as pump rebuilds and small parts machining, 

will take place at this facility. 

This facility consists of a 14 m x 12 m steel shop building, an 8 m x 14 m roofed area between two 40' steel 

containers, and a secured tool crib area, and is equipped with tools and an air compressor. An additional 

locked and secured storage area houses spare dewatering pumps and equipment. 

18.9.4.1.10 Drill Maintenance Shop 

There is a second storage and maintenance shop currently serving the contract drillers and exploration 

team. It consists of a roofed working area, 19 m wide x 8 m long, between double stacked 20' shipping 

containers and includes a back wall. It will continue to serve as a maintenance shop for well drilling and UG 

exploration drilling equipment. 

18.9.4.1.11 Environmental Offices and Facility 

There is an existing office facility for the environmental department, consisting of double stacked 20' 

containers covered by a roof. This serves as the office area, sample prep and records area for the 

environmental department. 

18.9.5 Site Access and Security 

An access gate and guard facility will be installed at the new site entrance and will include a barrier and 

fenced gate. Preliminary screening of all traffic entering the property will be conducted at this location. 

The project property is enclosed by chain link fencing with barbed wire or razor wire crowns where 

accessible to the public, and/or four strand, barbed wire fencing to prevent livestock from wandering onto 

the property. Additional security fencing (chain link fence with barbed wire or razor wire crowns) will be 



 

 
CERRO BLANCO PROJECT

Page 18-15 

 

installed around new installations, including: warehouse area, parts of the refinery, and electrical 

substations. 

A short distance from the access gate into the property will be a site access control building and a parking 

lot. The control building will house the security access control office and provide control of all personnel 

entering and leaving site. Only site-approved and security-cleared vehicles will be allowed to proceed 

beyond this point. Employees and visitors (non-approved vehicles) will park their vehicles at this location 

before passing through the security control point. 

Regular employees will use the on-site bus, transport vans, or small vehicles for travel between work areas 

and the security access point. 

Security personnel will be employed to provide on-site security during operations, consisting of uniformed 

and plain-clothes executive security staff and supervisors. The guards will perform security duties at the 

guard post at the main site entrance, provide roving patrols around the project site and provide internal / 

external security at the refinery area. Plains clothes security personnel will augment the on-site uniform 

guards, provide security for staff in town, and coordinate with local law enforcement and contractors' 

security teams. Additional security will be added during the construction period, with an additional uniformed 

guard on site for each shift, and additional executive staff for visitors and to coordinate with the contractors' 

security personnel. 

18.9.6 Mine Offices 

A mine office facility will be constructed adjacent to the existing administration office facility. It will be a pre-

fabricated modular building with concrete slab floor, approximately 10m x 18m. It will be equipped with 

three offices, a conference room, and an open working area with multiple cubicles for technical support 

staff. 

18.9.7 Process Plant Buildings 

The primary crusher will not require a covered building. A 5 m tall Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) wall 

will be constructed to allow loader access to the crusher dump pocket. The proposed crusher location has 

been optimized to allow easy access from the North and South portals while minimizing conveying lengths 

to the process plant. 

Roofing and cladding will be installed in the process plant area where required for operations, equipment 

or materials that are rain sensitive, and for high security areas. These localized covers will be used wherever 

feasible to provide rain and sun protection. In general, most of this roofing and cladding in the process plant 

area will be engineered as part of the equipment structural support steel. It will be designed with 

consideration for maintenance and mobile crane access to critical equipment.  

18.9.8 Refinery and Gold Room 

The refinery system will be a pre-fabricated modular design housed in a total of 14 x 40' sea containers. 

The gold room will also be pre-assembled in a single 40' sea container fully fitted with all necessary 

equipment. A complete security system is included in the vendor design, including cameras, digital 

recording, monitors and ability to connect this system to the main plant control room. 

The refinery and gold room installation will be separated from the other work areas with security fencing 

and have a single security-controlled access point.

18.9.9 MCC Buildings and Operator Control Rooms 

The electrical equipment buildings, which house the motor control centers (MCC's) and operator control 

rooms (e-houses) for the crusher, process plant, tailings filtering and paste areas will be pre-fabricated 

shipping containers built to meet all local electrical and fire codes and regulations. Where economical, the 

units will have MCC's and control equipment pre-installed to reduce the amount of field work. 

18.9.10 Mill Office and Personnel Facilities 

A mill office and personnel facility will be situated next to the process plant. It will be a pre-fabricated 

modular building with concrete slab floor, approximately 10 m x 18 m. The facility will be divided to provide 

an office and working area, and personnel lunch and washroom facility. 

18.9.11 Reagent Warehouse 

All process plant chemical and reagents will be stored in a pre-engineered warehouse building with 

approximately 360 m2 of covered storage space (approximately 15 m x 24 m). The reagents will be 

segregated by concrete curbs where required to avoid any potential cross contamination. Liquid spillage in 

this area will be contained within the building. Figure 18-5 provides a general arrangement of the reagent 

warehouse building. 

A separate fenced and gated area will house the sodium cyanide storage area, with its own concrete 

containment. Sodium cyanide will be shipped to site and stored within the same shipping containers used 

for delivery within this storage containment pad. The delivery trucks will return with an empty container for 

exchange.

18.9.13 Mine Dry 

A new mine dry will be installed next to the mine office to serve as the underground personnel mine dry. It 

will be a similar structure to the existing facility and be built using pre-fabricated modular structures with a 

roof covering and hook / basket storage areas between the shower and change room modules. It will serve 

230 underground workers. 

18.9.14 On-Site Water Tanks 

A new dual-purpose fresh / fire water tank will be erected with a capacity of 785,000 L. Internal risers on all 

non-firewater suction lines will ensure a minimum fire water reserve of 470,000 L, allowing for approximately 

two hours of firefighting capability. 

A new process water tank with 170,000 L capacity will also be erected adjacent to the fresh/fire water tank 

to service the process plant. 

18.9.15 Soil Stockpile Areas 

Excess topsoil removed for the preparation of site facilities such as the process plant and DSTF, will be 

stockpiled as suitable on site. The stockpile will remain until the end of operations, when it will be reclaimed 

and used for site closure. 

18.9.16 Site Access Road 

Road access to the site is currently through Asunción Mita, which includes several narrow streets. The 

project site is accessed by gravel road from the eastern edge of Asuncion Mita, crossing the river Grande 

de Mita using a bridge (El Achotal) that has a 27 tonne capacity. The route is not considered suitable for 

year round delivery of heavy equipment and materials during construction and operations. 

A base case design including a road and river crossing over the Río Grande de Mita has been prepared to 

support the feasibility study cost estimate. The new access road will be able to support the heavy equipment 

loads anticipated during construction and operations. In addition, it is expected that the road will originate 

from the CA-1 Pan American highway to avoid the residential development around Asunción Mita. 

The road is designed for a maximum speed of 50 km to accommodate two way traffic. The development of 

the new road will may include upgrading some sections of existing farm access roads. The road design 

includes a new bridge to be installed over the Rio Grande de Mita.  

18.9.17 Site Roads 

The main site roads that will be developed include the access road (from the access control entrance to the 

plant and infrastructure site) and the portal connector road (between the North and South portals). 

Additional ancillary roads will be developed for mine dewatering wells and reinjection wells access and 

maintenance. Various roads have already been developed for accessing wells and drilling locations, and 

these will continue to be used wherever practical. 

The access road stays within the property boundary and security fencing from the access point to the plant 

site. It will continue on the lower elevations around the waste rock dump and DSTF and enter the plant site 

from the south.

Ore will be transported on the portal connector road from the North portal to the crusher. Waste will be 

transported from the South portal to the waste rock dump from the portal connector road.  

Various temporary construction access roads will be made or modified from existing roads for temporary 

construction laydown facilities, the staged DSTF construction, and for construction access, where required.  

18.10 Power Supply and Distribution 

18.10.1 Power Supply 

Electrical power to the plant will be supplied from a utility substation, Energuate Barranca Honda 

Substation, located approximately 1 km south of Asunción Mita. A 69kV single circuit overhead transmission 

line, approximately 8.2 km long, will be constructed from the substation to the project site switchyard. A 

preliminary plan and estimate has been prepared by a line contractor who has previously installed all 

existing power infrastructure at site. 

The total estimated operating power demand for the site, considering full dewatering and injection pump 

operation, is provided in Table 18-1. 

Table 18-1: Electrical Load Summary 

Item Unit Value 

Total Operating Load 14.3 MW 

Total Connected Load 25.0 MW 

Source: JDS (2019) 

18.10.2 Surface Electrical Power Distribution 

The proposed electrical distribution systems are described below. 

18.10.2.1 Primary Power Distribution 

The main 69 kV switchyard on site contains SF6 live tank circuit breakers, motor operated disconnect 

switches, overhead transmission structure and step-down power transformers which have already been 

purchased from the Marlin site that utilized a 69 kV switchyard. The 69 kV power supply goes through an 

overall live tank circuit breaker with a set of motorized disconnect switches at each side and back to the 

overhead structure, then is split into two circuits. Each circuit runs through a set of motorized disconnect 

switches, a live tank circuit breaker and a step-down power transformer to the 13.8 kV main switchgear 

located in a pre-fabricated modular building (i.e. the main substation). 

The power transformer capacity can be increased up to 50% with additional (forced) cooling. In the event 

that one step down transformer is out of operation, the second one would have sufficient capacity to supply 

full-demand power to the plant. 

The main switchgear consists of two sections connected by a normally open tie-breaker. The power 

correction equipment, in form of two harmonic filters, will be installed as part of the main substation and fed 

from the 13.8 kV main switchgear. 13.8 kV is defined as the primary on-site power distribution voltage. 

Distribution is from the main substation to the key area substations (mine, crushing plant, process plant,

paste plant, cooling plants, dewatering wells, injection wells, etc.) through a system of 13.8 kV single circuit 

overhead distribution lines. Each feeder line originates from the 13.8 kV switchgear in the main substation. 

The existing on-site overhead power distribution lines are currently operating on 4.16 kV. Site operators 

have confirmed that the line system and all the accessories are designed and installed with the capability 

for 13.8 kV. Therefore, this system will be re-used, where possible, to supply 13.8 kV power from the main 

substation to electric loads spread throughout the site.  

A new 13.8 kV overhead power distribution line system will be built to accommodate the loads of mine 

portal, mill and mine buildings due to the limitation of the existing line capacity and distribution. 

18.10.2.2 Secondary Power Distribution 

The selected secondary distribution voltage levels for the plant are 4.16 kV, 3-phase, 60 Hz (medium 

voltage) for large drives and 480 V, 3-phase, 60 Hz (low voltage) for smaller drives. The secondary 

distribution system originates at Area substations (i.e. Mill Substation, CIP substation, etc.) and will 

distribute power to each individual end user. 

The Area substation step-down transformers have been based on the Area electrical load calculation with 

a 25% growth factor applied and rounded up to the next closest rating level of standard transformers. 

18.10.3 Emergency Power 

The existing on-site power plant will be altered as the emergency power plant with the diesel generators 

relocated from Marlin site. Some generator output voltages are 4.16 kV and the others are 600 V which will 

be converted to 4.16 kV through internal step-up transformer. There are six 1.6 MW generators and two 

1.2MW generators for a total capacity of 12MW. 

The purpose of the standby power system is to provide an alternate source of power to critical process 

equipment and underground mine fans and pumps in the event of failure of the grid power supply, allowing 

for orderly shutdown of the process plant, maintaining operations of critical underground equipment and 

providing the minimum emergency power in the event of an overall power interruption. The output from the 

standby power generators will be connected to a common standby power switchgear assembly. 

The standby switchgear assembly will be connected to the main 13.8 kV switchgear in the main substation 

via a step-up transformer. Upon loss of connection to utility power, the diesel generator units will start to 

provide power to all area substations through the main 13.8 kV switchgear and 13.8 kV site power 

distribution line system.  

The total estimated emergency power demand for the plant is just below 7 MVA for both surface and 

underground facilities. 

18.10.4 Construction Power 

The existing standalone generators will supply power required during the construction phase. Temporary 

construction generators will be used where required to provide power to remote locations, or where 

distribution from the existing generators is not practical.

18.11 Communications / IT 

The existing communications tower currently provides sufficient access to stream data to and from the site, 

and will service the site during the initial construction period. A new fiber optic cable will be installed as part 

of the 69 kV powerline. A portion of this cable is dedicated to the power utility communication with the site 

substation, leaving 24 fibers available for site voice and data communications link connected at the La 

Barranca Honda substation.  

The site communications will be by fibre optic cable distributed among the site facilities with the power 

transmission infrastructure. The underground mine will use a dedicated communications system, as 

described in Section 16. Mobile equipment and security will also use hand held radios for communications. 

18.12 Mobile Equipment 

A list of surface equipment has been prepared for the site surface activities. EM has already purchased 

some equipment from the Marlin mine, and this has been taken into account for the new equipment 

required. The new equipment required for the site is listed in Table 18-2.

18.13 Drystack Tailings Facility 

The DSTF design consists of a starter facility constructed from earthfill / rockfill and a centerline raised 

filtered tailings embankment.  

The main components of the initial capital construction would include a portion of the starter facility, haul 

road for tailings delivery (via dump trucks), tailings facility underdrainage and decant systems, blanket drain, 

surface stormwater channel downstream of the ultimate DSTF footprint, and reclaim water pipelines. 

Additionally, it will include the barges and pumps for the DSTF low-flow and stormwater reclaim water ponds 

as well as the associated mechanical and electrical components. A sump will be located within the low-flow 

reclaim pond, downstream of the toe of the ultimate embankment footprint, to pump seepage and DSTF 

surface runoff water back to the process plant. The general layout of the DSTF is provided in Figure 18-7. 

18.13.1 Design Objectives and Criteria 

The design objectives, design basis, and design criteria adopted for the feasibility-level design of the 

proposed DSTF are described below. 

18.13.2 Design Objectives, Basis and Criteria

18.13.3 Geotechnical Investigations 

A feasibility-level geotechnical and hydrogeological subsurface investigation program was performed to 

characterize the site conditions and develop feasibility-level design criteria for the proposed DSTF. The 

following sub-sections describe the purpose, methods, and findings / results obtained from the subsurface 

investigation programs performed at the project site. 

18.13.3.1 Background 

Over the last six years, three separate feasibility-level site geotechnical characterization programs have 

been implemented in support of a proposed DSTF: 

 In 2012 and 2013 a Phase I geotechnical investigation program and an updated feasibility study 

was performed by Golder (2012, 2013) 

 A third feasibility-level geotechnical program was performed by Stantec between May and July 

2018 to assess and characterize the conditions in support of an evaluation for the DSTF location. 

Although the 2012 and 2013 investigations were for a DSTF site located outside of the current project 

boundaries, all the subsurface data collected from these feasibility investigation programs are considered 

applicable to the engineering analysis for the DSTF.

18.13.3.2 Surface and Sub-surface 

As part of the field program (Stantec 2018), boreholes were completed within the DSTF area to improve 

understanding of the soil strength and the stratigraphic characteristics of foundation soils. The borehole 

locations are shown in Figure 18-8. It should be noted that there were no historical geotechnical boreholes 

within the currently planned DSTF area to supplement those completed by Stantec (2018). In total, 11 test 

pits were completed in the vicinity of the DSTF, with depths ranging from 0.6 m to 5.0 m. A total of five 

boreholes were completed in the area of the DSTF, with depths ranging from 8.7 m to 30.3 m. 74 Standard 

Penetration Tests were completed in the borings, as well as 122 in-situ permeability tests. 

Ground conditions in the vicinity of the DSTF consist of a surface colluvium and alluvium layer overlying 

residual soil (composed of the breaking down of sedimentary rocks and tuffs). Bedrock was not encountered 

in any of the borings to the depths investigated. 

18.13.4 Tailings Geochemistry 

18.13.4.1 General 

For the Feasibility Study (FS), a new sample of tailings was subject to geochemical testing or analyses, 

and existing information regarding the geochemistry of the ore and tailings was reviewed. A summary of 

the historical information and FS testing is provided in following sub-sections. 

18.13.4.2 Previous Test Work 

A report by WMC (2006) summarizes Preliminary and Phase I material characterizations. Waste rock and 

ore samples were selected from the five major ore veins: S1A, S1B, S2, S3, and North zone. Acid Base 

Accounting (ABA) testing was performed on 65 samples and leach extractions were performed on 

17 samples. Net Neutralization Potential (NNP) values indicate that 27 samples were Non-Acid-Generating 

(NAG), 27 samples were uncertain, and 9 samples were potentially acid generating (PAG). Using 

neutralization potential ratios (NPRs), Phase I data (n = 42) is mostly NAG (48%), followed by PAG (36%) 

and uncertain (17%). 

The ore samples tested by WMC would ultimately become tailings and the milling process would not likely 

change the original geochemical characteristics of the ore. WMC reported a range in NPR for ore with a 

low of 0.01 to a high of 1163 and a geometric mean of 3.4. Thus, on average for a skewed sample 

population, the tailings generated by processing the ore samples tested would most likely be NAG. 

In the previous DSTF feasibility-level design and cost estimate report (Golder, 2012), there is description 

of geochemical testing for a single tailings sample (run in duplicate). The sample was evaluated using both 

static and kinetic test methods. Results indicate that the one sample of tailings classified as NAG with an 

abundance of carbonate (calcite) available to neutralize any acid generated by the limited amount of 

residual sulfide minerals in the tailings. Furthermore, no evidence was found of metal leaching either under 

aggressive conditions (NAG testing) or conditions more consistent with the ambient environment, as tested 

by the synthetic precipitation leaching procedure (SPLP). Thus, the single sample of tailings evaluated 

showed no potential for either development of acid drainage or leaching of metals.

18.13.4.3 FS Test Results 

A tailings sample was available from the current testing program. The sample of the tailing (JDS-32-0261 

Tailings) was submitted to Maxxam Analytics in Burnaby, British Columbia for analysis of ABA, for 

evaluation of potential for acid rock drainage (ARD), and a shake flask extraction (SFE), for analysis of 

potential metal leaching. The sample was created by blending numerous ore types from different locations 

around the mine. 

Table 18-6 lists the results of acid base accounting data from the previous testing (Golder 2012) and the 

results obtained from the most recent tailings sample analyzed.

Tailings A and B are from the previous testing conducted by Golder (2012) represent a sample and a 

duplicate. The recent sample (JDS-32-0261) has generally similar characteristics and can be summarized 

by the abundance of acid-neutralizing potential (ANP) as compared to the acid generating potential (AGP). 

With an NPR value of 4.1 and an NNP of 41, the tailings classifies as non-acid generating. This result is 

comparable to the previous analysis reported by Golder in 2012. 

Table 18-7 lists the results of the SFE test for the recent sample as compared with results from the SPLP 

test previously conducted on tailings by Golder (2012). Note that the water to rock ratio in the two tests is 

not the same and the resulting concentrations likely reflect the difference. In the SFE, the water:rock ratio 

is 3:1; whereas in the SPLP extraction the ratio is 20:1. The lower water to rock ratio in the SFE is more 

comparable to conditions in the field than is the ratio in the SPLP. In contrast, the SPLP test evaluates the 

total potential release of chemical mass from the tailings. Therefore, if the amount of chemical mass 

released is similar between the two tests, then the concentration should be higher in the SFE extract than 

in the SPLP.

Table 18-7: Comparison of Leach Test Results 

 

Of the metals listed in Table 18-7, mercury is the only constituent leached at a concentration at the limit 

identified by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). All other metals that might cause impact to the 

environment if discharged in surface water or groundwater are below both the IFC and limits identified by 

the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

It is on the basis of this information that a liner or lining has not been included in the design of the DSTF.

18.13.5 Drystack Tailings Facility Design 

Tailings from the milling process will be further dewatered through filtration before being transported to the 

designated drystack tailings facility. The DSTF is designed to accommodate approximately 3 Mt of filtered 

tailings. 

18.13.5.1 Material Balance 

A material balance model was developed for the feasibility-level design of the DSTF. The purpose of the 

material balance was to evaluate the height of the required starter berm, and to estimate the elevation of 

the embankment and the tailings impoundment on an annual basis throughout the operation of the DSTF. 

The model was also used to establish the embankment material required from borrow within impoundment 

basin area, to estimate the rate of rise of the embankment and the impoundment, and to estimate the 

ultimate capacity of the facility.  

The tailings production rate for the DSTF is shown in Table 18-8.

The results of the material balance calculations indicate the following: 

 The selected starter facility height is appropriate for the project. A change in the design storm 

management concept may result in a potential reduction in the required starter berm height 

 The starter facility will provide storage for the tailings materials for approximately the first year of 

operation, and 

 At the end of mine operations the freeboard will be 2 m. 

18.13.5.2 Layout and Staging 

The initial stage of the DSTF, constructed partially during the mine's expected 18-month long pre-production 

period and completed during the first quarter of the operations period, will provide storage capacity for at 

least the first wet season of tailings production. The starter facility will be constructed of alluvium/colluvium 

excavated from local borrow sources located within and near the footprint of the ultimate DSTF

impoundment as well as compacted, filtered tailings. The starter facility will have a crest elevation of about 

490 m, a crest width measuring 10 m, and downstream and upstream slopes of 2:1 (H:V).  

The facility will be expanded in a downstream manner. The downstream structural zone will be constructed 

of compacted filtered tailings to an overall slope angle of 2.75:1 and have a crest width of 10 m to 

accommodate two-way traffic of the anticipated mine haul fleet trucks. Material will be placed in this zone 

during the dry season, and in lifts consistent with the use of mine fleet trucks and dozer or motor-grader for 

placement and compacted by preferential traffic routing and the use of conventional compaction equipment. 

Sufficient drying of the tailings in the compacted zone will be required to meet moisture and density 

specifications. The successful compaction of this structural zone is vitally important. Annual construction of 

the dry season structural zone is designed to provide capacity of the subsequent wet season. A cross-

section through the facility is provided in Figure 18-9.  

The estimated total capacity of the ultimate facility, after seven years of tailings production, will be 3 Mt. 

Considering an average dry density of 1.59 t/m3, based on a weighted average of 1.63 t/m3 for dry-season 

tailings and 1.53 t/m3 for wet season tailing, this equates to 1.9 million m3 of required capacity. 

To help reduce the likelihood of increased pore pressures within the tailings stack over time, a network of 

seepage underdrains will be installed at the foundation level of the facility, as shown in Figure 18-10. 

Additionally, perforated vertical decant 'towers' will be constructed to aide in the evacuation of surface water 

that may accumulate at times. Water collected within these pipe networks will report to a low-flow seepage 

collection pond located southeast of the DSTF area. Following a significant storm event or accumulation of 

water from subsequent events, the water reporting to the low-flow pond will spill into the adjacent, larger 

capacity storm water pond. Sumps have been designed within these ponds and pumps will be installed to 

return collected water to the mill for use in processing. The decant and underdrain systems will be stage-

constructed ahead of tailings deposition only as much as practicably possible. 

18.13.5.3 Drystack Tailings Placement Considerations 

The tailings will be transported from the filter plant stockpile to the DSTF via a mine fleet of trucks. Following 

the construction of the starter facility, filtered tailings will be deposited in one of two fashions, as described 

below.  

Tailings deposition occurring during the wet season of each year will take place within the western portion 

of the DSTF footprint. These tailings will be dumped and left in a relatively loose state with little to no 

compaction effort required. Surface shaping of the tailings placed in the wet season should take place to 

generate localized depressions in the tailings surface near the vertical decant towers to direct surface water 

runoff into these pipes. This localized grading is expected to be performed with light pressure, track-

mounted equipment. Prior to placing tailings material during the initial rainy conditions, access ramps for 

the mine fleet of trucks and spreading equipment will be constructed from local borrow sources. After start-

up of the plant and filtration system, the access ramps will be extended using filtered tailings material. 

Tailings deposited during the dry season will take place within the eastern portion of the DSTF footprint as 

indicated in Figure 18-11. These tailings will be spread in relatively horizontal lifts and compacted into place 

to provide structural containment of the wet season tailings and provide capacity to store the runoff volume 

of water associated with the design storm event. Prior to each wet season and tailings deposition within the 

facility's western basin, the vertical decant towers should be raised to remain above the anticipated tailings 

surface.

18.13.6 Drystack Conceptual Closure Plan 

Because the DSTF is constructed continuously over its operational life using the downstream construction 

method, concurrent reclamation will not be possible. At the end of operation, exposed portions of the decant 

piping will be dismantled and the decant pipes plugged below the final surface, using a blind flange, and 

that area covered with a concrete slab. 

The surface of the DSTF should be domed so that it will shed precipitation, rather than impound it. Topsoil 

that was stockpiled from the DSTF footprint will be spread over the surface of the DSTF. Native grass seed 

mixture will be planted to reduce erosion. 

18.14 Waste Rock Facility 

The waste rock facility (WRF) is located southwest of the DSTF, adjacent to the south portal. The facility 

has been designed to accommodate in excess of 120,000 m3 of waste rock. The facility is shown in plan 

on Figure 18-12 and is labeled "waste rock stockpile". 

The WRF serves as a temporary stockpile for waste rock that is generated during the mining process. It is 

Bluestone's intent that the waste rock will be used in the underground backfill program. Typically, there will 

be only a minimal amount of material in this stockpile. During the pre-production operations, the stockpile 

may contain up to 120,000 m3 of waste rock. 

While further testwork needs to be carried out to confirm if the waste rock is PAG, because the exposure 

time will be limited it currently assumed that acid generation will not have sufficient time to occur. It is 

suggested that Bluestone conducts individual field humidity cell tests (also referred to as "blue barrel" tests) 

on various representative samples of waste rock to bear-out this concept prior to detail engineering. 

Because the WRF was not sited prior to the site investigation, there were no specific site investigation 

activities advanced directly under WRF footprint area. It is noted that the current pre-development waste 

rock material at the south portal appears to be hard and durable. There are, however, test pits that were 

advanced in the WRF footprint area, and those test pit logs indicate that the footprint area is typical for the 

vicinity; containing primarily sands and gravels. Based on engineering judgment and experience with similar 

materials elsewhere, Stantec has confidence that at this feasibility level, the WRF is adequately designed. 

During subsequent design phases, the WRF should be the subject of engineering analyses.

19 Market Studies and Contracts 

19.1 Market Studies 

No market study was completed on the potential sale of doré from the Cerro Blanco Project. The terms 

used in the economic analysis, however, are considered to be in line with current market conditions and 

were sourced by contacting various refiners and transportation companies. The indicative terms were 

reviewed and found to be reasonable by QP Maz Mohaseb, P.Eng. 

The study recommends that as the Project advances towards development, a detailed marketing report 

and logistics study should be undertaken to ensure the accuracy of the terms. Table 19-1 outlines the terms 

used in the economic analysis.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social  

When Bluestone acquired Cerro Blanco in 2017, the responsibilities for overseeing environmental and 

social management, including monitoring of social and environmental commitments, and management of 

approved studies and ongoing permits, were an integral part of the acquisition. Cerro Blanco maintains a 

comprehensive permits registry and environmental/social management systems, initially set up under 

Goldcorp's Sustainability Excellence Management System. Two dedicated site-based teams provide 

ongoing management of these project aspects: an environmental team and a community relations team. 

The teams remain largely intact since the acquisition and continue to provide extensive knowledge, 

understanding, and feedback regarding the local environmental and socioeconomic contexts to Bluestone 

management. 

In addition, Bluestone has reviewed, and as required, updated the environmental, social and permitting 

aspects based on current international good practices which meet or exceed local regulations. This has 

been done with the support of experienced international and Guatemalan consultants.  

The onsite organizational chart has been improved with the creation of new positions, including a Senior 

Manager Sustainability and a Communications Coordinator. The Senior Manager Sustainability is 

accountable for all Health, Safety, Environment and Corporate Social Responsibility aspects of the project. 

The environmental and community relations teams now report directly to the Senior Sustainability Manager. 

The Communication Coordinator manages the flow of project related information internally and externally, 

particularly with community stakeholders. Additional positions currently being recruited to support the 

project include a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Manager and a Social Investment Coordinator.  

Bluestone is committed to developing the Project with well-defined sustainability objectives that protect the 

environment and are aligned with the local communities, for both near-term and future needs. In 2018, 

Bluestone deployed significant efforts to develop and implement new CSR, Human Resources and Health, 

Safety and Environment (HSE) policies and procedures, and is committed to continued improvement in 

these areas as the project advances. 

20.1 Environment 

There are various environmental studies and ongoing monitoring activities which have been performed at 

the Cerro Blanco site since the start of the project. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was 

submitted and approved by the Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (MARN) in 2007.  

The environmental and permitting review during the FS showed that some components of the mine design 

have changed since the approval of the EIA and permits in 2007. Therefore specific permit / EIA 

amendments will be submitted to MARN for approval and/or notification (refer to section 20.2 for further 

details), as required, to support the updated FS design. In addition, it is noted that new baseline 

environmental and social studies are required for the new access road and power line. 

The approved EIA from 2007 included basic Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and Social 

Management Plan (SMP), both of which were reviewed and updated during the FS are based on current 

international good practice.

20.1.1 EIA Areas of Influence 

In 2007, the approved EIA was prepared based on three specific areas, as shown in Figure 20-1. The 

approved EIA has defined the direct area of influence within an irregular polygon 235,452 m2 in area. This 

includes the underground mine, the process plant and its attached service buildings. The indirect area of 

influence includes exploration areas in addition to the direct area of influence and covers a total area of 

7,050,000 m2. An external area of influence is also considered; this includes the surrounding areas and 

following seven communities (total area of 5,500 ha): 

 Caserlo La Lima 

 Trapiche Vargas 

 El Cerron 

 El Tule 

 Las Animas 

 San Rafael Cerro Blanco, and 

 Municipality of Asunción Mita.

20.1.2 Water Management 

Water management infrastructure at the Project site includes an existing WTP, pipelines, settling ponds, 

collection and cooling channels and ponds, groundwater wells and related minor facilities. Monitoring of 

surface and ground waters is done regularly and is an ongoing activity. The onsite water management and 

monitoring requirements are well understood, as the environmental team has been collecting data for the 

past 10 years. The approved EIA (2007) indicates that metal constituents, including Aluminum, Arsenic, 

Iron and Manganese, are naturally occurring in the surface and ground water and are commonly found 

throughout the region. 

The existing WTP was installed in 2011 and is capable of treating up to 1,500 gpm. The approved discharge 

location for treated water is the Quebrada Tempisque. The WTP is specifically designed for removal of 

arsenic using co-precipitation with ferric salt. The treatment process includes chemical oxidation, pH 

adjustment, ferric iron addition, and solids separation to achieve removal of dissolved arsenic. A complete 

monitoring and sampling program has been in place since 2011, with regular monthly compliance reports 

submitted to and approved by MARN. To date, there have been no incidents of non-compliance. This 

program will continue into the operations phase of the project to ensure compliance with permitted 

discharge requirements. 

20.1.2.1 Water Quality 

The environmental monitoring program includes continuous sampling of surface water and groundwater. 

The monitoring performed at the discharge point to date shows that the concentrations of all parameters 

are within the criteria outlined by MARN and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for ore 

mining effluent. 

A 2010 study conducted by Consultoria y Tecnololgia Ambiental, S.A. (CTA), a Guatemalan environmental 

consultant, summarizes results of the water quality monitoring conducted between 2002 and 2007 

(Consultoria y Technologia Ambiental, S.A. (CTA SA), Sept. 2010, Linea base ambiental 2002-2007, 

Proyecto minero Cerro Blanco, Asuncia Mita, Jutiapa, Guatemala). The results indicated: 

 pH levels between 6.3 and 8.5;  

 Temperatures in surface water between 26°C and 27°C, and groundwater between 33°C and 72°C; 

and 

 Conductivity in surface water between 226 and 693 μS/cm, and groundwater between 2,235 and 

3,962 μS/cm. 

20.1.2.2 Surface Water Management 

Proposed surface water management infrastructure is described in Section 18.5 and is intended to minimize 

the volume of precipitation and runoff that comes into contact with areas that could negatively impact water 

quality. Runoff water from these areas is classified as "contact" water, while water that is diverted away 

from these areas is classified as "non-contact" water. Contact water is either reused in the Process Plant 

or sent to the WTP for treatment. Treated water from the WTP is monitored for quality prior to discharge. 

Non-contact water is also monitored prior to discharge to ensure quality meets discharge criteria.  

The current design is an improvement compared to the concept included in the approved EIA, which did 

not distinguish between contact and non-contact water.

20.1.2.3 Groundwater Management 

To effectively dewater the mine, the current dewatering plan includes a combination of surface dewatering 

wells and underground sumps located in the mine workings. The proposed dewatering and injection system 

for mining operations is essentially an expansion of the existing system and is outlined in Section 16.7.4. 

The dewatering system will allow for mining activities to proceed safely and productively by controlling 

inflows within the underground mine.  

Up to 1,500 gpm of mine dewatering water will be directed to the cooling ponds and then to the WTP for 

treatment. Once treated, a portion of the water will be reused in the process plant and for mine services, 

with the remainder pumped to the approved discharge point in the Quebrada Tempisque. Most of the 

groundwater coming from the mine dewatering wells will be directly reinjected via a series of deep 

reinjection wells downstream of the mine. Water that is not directly reinjected will be treated and discharged 

on surface.  

Groundwater injection was demonstrated to be a viable disposal alternative based on long-term testing 

conducted at an existing geothermal well MG-05. The project proposes nine injection wells, which will likely 

be located along the East Fault alignment and phased in over the mine life as described in Section 16.7.4.  

20.1.2.4 Water Treatment Plant (WTP) 

The existing WTP is designed to adhere to national Sewage Disposal and Reuse regulations and to World 

Bank Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines for ore mine effluent. Arsenic, a naturally occurring 

element in the region's groundwater, is the primary element that is reduced during the treatment process. 

The plant is designed to remove arsenic using co-precipitation with ferric salt. The treatment process 

includes chemical oxidation, pH adjustment, ferric iron addition, and solids separation. The treatment 

capacity is 1,500 gpm.  

The sludge generated from the treatment process is extracted from the WTP and disposed of in lined 

trenches with cement caps, as required by the recently approved Resolution number 00244-2016-

DIGARN/FACD/gamc MARN (as indicated in Table 20-2). At the end of the mine operations, the sludge will 

be excavated from the trenches and backfilled into the underground facilities, as outlined in the closure 

section 20.1.12.  

With construction and operation of the processing facilities, it is expected that 270 gpm of process water 

will be sent from the process plant to the WTP to prevent build-up of metals. The WTP process will require 

a modification to treat mercury and copper expected in the process plant effluent stream. The proposed 

modification will include addition of TMT-15© (or an approved equal), a sulfide compound widely utilized in 

water treatment systems for removal of divalent heavy metal cations such as mercury and copper. 

20.1.3 Waste Rock 

The waste rock facility is described in Section 18.14. The facility is designed to temporarily store waste rock 

(up to a period of one year on surface), before the waste rock is deposited back underground as cemented 

rock fill (CRF) or loose aggregate fill. 

The approved EIA indicates a total waste rock storage capacity of 629,268 tonnes, while the maximum 

capacity required in the current design is 80,000 tonnes. This reduction is based on the use of waste rock 

as backfill within the mine.

Page 20-5 

 

Based on historical testwork it is currently assumed that since waste rock exposure time will be limited, and 

any potential acid generation will not have sufficient time to occur. Additional testwork, including individual 

field humidity cell tests on various representative samples of waste rock, will be completed prior to detail 

engineering to confirm this assumption. The current design includes a pond that collects run-off water from 

the waste rock facility. A water quality monitoring program will be implemented to evaluate groundwater 

and run-off water quality prior to discharge. 

20.1.4 Tailings 

The DSTF is described in Section 18.13 and summarized below. 

20.1.4.1 DSTF Design Features 

Tailings generated from the process plant will be dewatered through a filtration process before being 

transported to the DSTF. The ultimate DSTF footprint covers a total area of 15 ha south of the process 

plant and is designed to accommodate 2.6 Mt of filtered tailings, with a 3 Mt design capacity. The ultimate 

height of the current design is 25 m and maximum slope of material stacked on the embankment is 2.75:1. 

A separate contact water management system is designed to collect all run-off from the DSTF to prevent 

potential surface water contamination. Contact water will be pumped to the WTP for treatment prior to 

discharge. 

20.1.4.2 Tailings Characterization 

As discussed in Section 18.13.4.3, a tailings sample was generated and submitted to Maxxam Analytics in 

Burnaby, British Columbia, for evaluation of potential for acid rock drainage in June of 2018. The results 

were similar to historical testing campaigns and showed an abundance of acid neutralizing potential (ANP) 

compared to the acid generating potential (AGP). With a neutralization potential ratio (NPR) value of 4:1 

and a net neutralization potential (NNP) of 41, the tailings has been classified as non-acid generating.  

Consistent with the approved EIA, tailings is considered to be NAG. 

20.1.5 Flora and Fauna 

An Environmental Baseline Study was prepared in 2007 and included in the approved EIA. The onsite 

environmental team is responsible for conducting periodic monitoring in the direct, indirect and external 

areas of influence. A flora and fauna monitoring program has been implemented and is a useful tool in 

evaluating the potential changes to the ecosystem and species as a result of Project activities. Information 

gathered through the monitoring program allows for adequate mitigation measures to be put in place, if 

required, but until now preventive plans have resulted in no apparent impact from the Project on biological 

populations in the region. One of these preventive plans is a biological conservation management plan 

which has been implemented in order to protect the natural environment and species, as discussed in 

Section 20.1.5.1. 

The most recent flora and terrestrial fauna monitoring was conducted in June 2017 by Everlife (Junio 2017, 

Everlife S.A., Monitoreo de biologia terrestre 2017, Proyecto Cerro Blanco, Asunción Mita, Jutiapa, 

Guatemala, C.A). The aquatic fauna information was collected during monitoring conducted in 2016 by 

Everlife (Everlife, S.A., 2016, Monitoreo de Biologia Acuatica 2016, Entre Mares de Guatemal, S.A.). The 

monitoring results do not indicate any significant impact to the species monitored and their conditions as a

Page 20-6 

 

result of mining activities. Flora and fauna monitoring activities will continue through the construction and 

operations phases of the project to mitigate impact on native species. 

A summary of the recent flora and fauna monitoring results is provided below. These were based on 

sampling points located within the direct, indirect and external areas of influence.  

Flora 

The Project is located in Sub-Tropical Dry forest and Tropical Dry forest areas where the vegetation is 

dominated by shrubs, graminoid savanna, deciduous shrubs, and deciduous forests with many species of 

microfoliate composite leaves. A total of 81 species (43 trees, 16 bushes, 17 herbal and 5 lianas) are 

distributed in the 26 floristic families that have been observed.  

Terrestrial Fauna 

The results of the terrestrial fauna monitoring performed at the sampling points in June 2017 registered a 

total of 65 species. The most frequently observed species were birds, followed with minor numbers of 

herpetofauna species. These results are consistent with the previous three years of monitoring.  

Aquatic Fauna 

The aquatic fauna monitoring is performed twice a year during the dry and wet seasons by Everlife, with 

data collected and compiled from four monitoring stations. There are no significant changes relating to the 

physicochemical parameters between the two seasons and both are within the permitted limits. The most 

recent results from 2016 indicate an electrical conductivity between 213 and 1,350 μS/cm (dry season) and 

282 to 2241 μS/cm (wet season), a pH range of 7.5-7.8 (dry season) and 7.4-8 (wet season) and 

temperature ranges between 25.8-27.8 °C (dry season) and 21.7-25.3 °C (wet season). 

Fish 

During the dry season, a total of 369 individual samples distributed among 10 species were observed, 

mainly consisting of Poecilia gilii and Astyanax aeneus. During the wet season, a total of 231 individual 

samples distributed among 7 species were observed, still mainly consisting of Poecilia gilii and Astyanax 

aeneus but also including Archocentrus nigrofasciatus and Rhamdia guatemalensis.  

Trophic Evaluation of Lake Güija 

The phytoplankton sampling results at Lake Güija (a 45 km2 lake located approximately 9 km SE of the 

Cerro Blanco site) were similar to the previous monitoring campaigns conducted from 2013 to 2015. The 

most representative species is Astyanax aeneus (Characidae). 

20.1.5.1 Flora and Fauna Management Plan 

Cerro Blanco has implemented a specific Flora and Fauna Management Plan to protect both flora and 

fauna environments and species (Entre Mares de Guatemala, S.A., Julio 2018, Manejo de Flora y manejo 

de Fauna). 

The main objective is to protect the native species and potentially threatened species, and to optimize 

onsite natural growth and habitat conditions. Before any onsite disturbance, the environmental team first 

inspects the area to evaluate the flora and fauna species potentially affected. If potentially endangered 

species are identified (such as orchids, tillandsias, cactus or pitayas), a specific relocation protocol is 

implemented. This includes identification of the impacted species' geolocation and local conditions in order 



 

 
CERRO BLANCO PROJECT 

FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 20-7 

 

to optimize their future habitat by ensuring the new location will offer similar conditions and minimize stress 

due to relocation.  

The species relocations are carefully carried out in a private reserve (El Pedernal) where periodic 

monitoring is performed. The species collected on site can thus continue to grow/live in a protected 

environment.  

20.1.6 Cultural and Archeological Resources 

As outlined in the approved EIA, along with Bluestone's corporate initiatives, the onsite environmental team 

members are identifying, monitoring and mitigating potential impact to any cultural and archeological 

artifacts. Similar to the fauna and flora management plan, a defined inspection procedure is performed prior 

to any activity and external archeologist experts are consulted, if required. Until now, no cultural and 

archeological resources have been identified within the direct area of influence. 

20.1.7 Environmental Monitoring 

Cerro Blanco is currently operating a comprehensive environmental monitoring network, consisting of 26 

monitoring stations for water quality located within and outside of the Project boundaries. There are also 

six stations for monitoring ambient air quality and noise. Monthly and annual reports are prepared and 

presented to the Authorities (MARN, Ministerio de Energia y Mina (MEM), Ministerio de Salud Jutiapa and 

Ministerio de Ambiente Jutiapa) to report on monitoring. 

As part of the commitments under the approved EIA, Cerro Blanco performs monthly monitoring to evaluate 

the water quality, air quality and noise levels in the direct and indirect areas of influence. The monitoring 

reports are submitted to MARN for approval. 

The environmental baseline study prepared in 2007 did not include air quality or noise parameters so there 

is no data regarding the conditions before onsite activities commenced. However, this monitoring is 

currently conducted on a monthly basis at six different sampling stations strategically located in the direct 

and indirect areas of influence. Due to lack of baseline conditions at site prior to 2007, it was agreed with 

MARN that air quality and noise monitoring results will be compared to the data collected between 2008 

and 2012 and EPA standards as baselines. The most recent results can be found in the August 2018 report 

submitted to MARN (Entre Mares de Guatemala, S.A., August 2018, Informe correspondiente al mes de 

agosto 2018, Asunción Mita, Jutiapa, Guatemala, preparado por el Ministerio de Ambiente y Recursos 

Naturales). 

20.1.8 Environmental Management Plan 

The approved EIA for the Project included a basic EMP which has been reviewed and updated as part of 

the FS. Using the environmental experience and monitoring data collected at site over the past decade, the 

current environmental procedures have been reviewed in detail and updated to ensure improvement and 

increased effectiveness in order to satisfy all local regulations and incorporate worldwide good practices. 

The updated EMP now also includes sections relating to the corporate Health, Safety and Environment 

Program (HSE) and the Emergency Response Plan (ERP).

20.2 Permitting 

The approved EIA and permits allow the project to proceed with the development of the underground mine 

and construction of the process facilities, on the condition future operations adhere to the existing permit 

requirements. Since the design has been updated and optimized during the FS, an amendment of the EIA 

and specific permits will be required for approval in order to be aligned with the updated project design.  

Two new infrastructure items, the access road/bridge and power line, are not covered by any previous 

studies or permits. These require new baseline studies, EIAs, and permit applications to be submitted to 

MARN for approval, with input from the following Guatemalan authorities: Ministerio de Energia y Mineria 

(MEM), Consejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas (CONAP), Instituto Nacional de Bosques (INAB), Ministerio 

de Salud y asistencia social (Ministry of Health & Social Assistance), and the local municipality of Asunción 

Mita. The anticipated duration for completion of baseline studies, submittal/approval of EIAs, and issue of 

permits is 8-10 months for the power line. For the access road, the assumed duration is expected to be 3-

4 months on the basis that the local municipality of Asunción Mita looks after the EIA/permit application 

process. 

Table 20-1 provides a summary of main permit amendments and new permits required. 

The Cerro Blanco permit register indicates all applicable permit commitments have been fulfilled to date.

Design updates done as part of the FS have the potential to reduce the Project's environmental impact. 

The key environmental developments of the FS are summarized below: 

 The FS mine plan has been designed to accommodate all waste rock underground as CRF or loose 

waste rock fill. As a result, no potentially acid generating waste rock will be left on surface after 

closure. 

 The updated FS mine closure plan eliminates the two existing surface waste rock stockpiles by 

returning this material to the underground mine. 

 Surface water management design now includes a levee to protect the mine site infrastructure in 

case of a major flood event. 

 Tailings deposition into the DSTF has been optimized to consider both dry and wet seasons. Dry 

season tailings is used to build up the downstream embankment, while wet season tailings is placed 

upstream of the embankment and does not require compaction. 

 The FS mine plan has been developed so that up to 38% of the tailings can be accommodated 

underground paste backfill. This design approach reduces the amount of filtered tailings to be 

stored on surface. 

20.3 Mine Closure 

The approved EIA (2007) includes a basic conceptual closure plan. Under Guatemalan regulation, the 

Cerro Blanco mine closure plan does not need to be submitted to the authorities until three years in advance 

of the projected mine closure. Based on this timeline, Cerro Blanco is not yet required to submit a closure 

plan to the authorities. However, Bluestone has opted to produce an updated conceptual closure plan based 

on the current FS level design. Requirements of this updated closure plan are summarized in Table 20-3 

and provide the basis for closure costs highlighted in Section 21.

that is stockpiled from the DSTF footprint during construction will be spread over the surface of the DSTF. 

Native grass seed mixture will be planted in order to reduce erosion. 

20.4 Social Environment and Relationships with Communities 

Similar to the environmental management program, the social aspects of Cerro Blanco had been previously 

maintained under Goldcorp's CSR management plan, including annual reporting on social engagement and 

sustainability initiatives (referred to as "Informe Annual"). Cerro Blanco has maintained a comprehensive 

community relationship register and reporting system based on Goldcorp's Sustainability Excellence 

Management System. During the FS, the social management processes were reviewed and a 

comprehensive Social Management System was developed using information available from the Cerro 

Blanco database, applicable reports, and onsite CSR team. 

Bluestone is committed to developing Cerro Blanco with good internationally accepted practices in line with 

its corporate sustainable and transparency objectives.  

In 2018, Bluestone completed an update to the Social Baseline Study (Social Capital Group (SCG), 2018, 

Social Baseline Study Update) to provide a current socioeconomic context for the project. The Social 

Baseline Study (SBS) included in the EIA was prepared in 2006 using information extracted from 2002 

national census. The SBS update performed during the summer of 2018 included the most recent 

Guatemalan official data, a census that was conducted in the rural area, along with numerous face to face 

meetings with representatives of local organization. In addition, relevant project social aspects and 

stakeholder engagements were reviewed and updated based on international good practices and IFC 

performance standards. In 2018, Cerro Blanco developed and initiated the implementation of a new Social 

Management System (SMS), which includes a database to register all community engagements, activities 

and key information related to the community relationships. The SMS is used to track and monitor 

performance against key CSR objectives.  

The onsite organizational structure has been reviewed and improved with the addition of new positions, 

including the Senior Sustainability Manager and CSR Communication Coordinator (refer to Section 25.1.4 

for additional details). 

20.4.1 Social Baseline Study (SBS) Update 

The primary objective of the SBS update was to obtain current information regarding the socioeconomic 

status in the project areas of influence. The scope of the study covers the town of Asunción Mita (capital of 

the municipality, also referred to as the "Urban Area"), plus 6 rural villages included in the external area of 

influence and nine rural villages located near Lake Güija (collectively referred to as the "Rural Area"). The 

Lake Güija villages were included in the SBS update to gain a better understanding of the project perception 

outside of the external area of influence. 

Field visits were conducted between June and August of 2018, which included a census of the 1,035 

households in the rural area. In addition, workshops, semi-structured interviews and general observations 

were conducted and completed in both the urban and rural areas. Official Guatemalan documentation was 

also reviewed to understand the context of the study area and establish historical trends.

20.4.1.1 Asunción Mita (Urban Area) 

Asunción Mita is characterized as a municipality in constant growth. In 2016, it had already exceeded the 

population projections made in 2011 for 2025. Its inhabitants are mostly children and adolescents. The 

population is almost evenly split between men and women, with a slight predominance of women. Typical 

families in this urban area are consistent with the trends in other urban areas within the department of 

Jutiapa: traditional nuclear families of 3 or 4 members, with a male head of household. The town has more 

than 4,500 homes. Buildings are characterized by block walls with sheet roof and floors of cement or granite.  

The primary industry in the urban area of Asunción Mita is commercial trade. This has evolved in part due 

to the large population of migrants that have relocated to the town. Agricultural activities, such as melon 

production for export, and services such as masonry and plumbing, are common and act as an important 

economic drivers in the region. The population of the urban area is ladino, characterized as a 

heterogeneous population which expresses itself in Spanish as a maternal language, possesses specific 

cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with indigenous cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly 

considered as Western.  

In Asunción Mita, a total of 28 registered small local community organizations, called Consejos 

Comunitarios de Desarrollo (COCODEs), manage public budgets and formulate projects to meet 

community need. During the SBS update, meetings were held with representatives from the 20 active 

COCODEs in the urban area.  

The urban area also has a municipal council called Consejo Municipal de Desarrollo (COMUDE), which 

includes the mayor, councillors, and other municipal officials. The COMUDE mandate is to ensure projects 

identified by the COCODEs are carried out. An independent civil organization dedicated to environmental 

monitoring, called Asociacion de Monitoreo Ambiental Regional (AMAR) works closely with the Cerro 

Blanco team and local representatives. Additional social organizations identified include: the School 

Parents' Board and Catholic, Mormon and Evangelical churches. 

Cerro Blanco team members are actively involved with local organizations and communities to inform the 

population project activities and development strategies. In order to respond to the concern around lack of 

specific knowledge regarding the Project, COCODE representatives and the general public were invited to 

visit the Cerro Blanco site. These site visits have proved to be very successful and are still ongoing. 

In 2018, approximately two thirds of the population over the age of 14 was either employed or looking for 

work. Earnings for both men and women are far below minimum wage. There is a clear gender gap in the 

labour market where women are less represented. Absence of contracts and proof of payment or social 

security are indicators of informal employment. There is no evidence of child labour. 

20.4.1.2 Surrounding Villages (Rural Area) 

The Cerro Blanco team maintains active contact, meetings and discussions with all the villages surrounding 

the mine. 

The majority of villages in the area studied have small populations (i.e. less than 400), with the exception 

of Trapiche Vargas (566) and San Joaquín (745). The population characteristics of the villages are generally 

in line with those in the urban area. There is no significant immigration in the rural area, while there is 

emigration to the United States and the interior of Guatemala. Although the information collected represents 



 

 
CERRO BLANCO PROJECT 

FEASIBILITY STUDY TECHNICAL REPORT

For BLUESTONE RESOURCES INC. 

Page 20-16 

 

a low percentage of migrant population within the rural area, there is daily commuting to the town of 

Asunción Mita for work which is not considered as migration by the population of the villages. 

The majority of the employed rural population earns below the national minimum wage. There is a 

significant availability of workforce in the villages as 7 out of 10 residents are of working age. However, the 

employment rate of approximately 50% is below the national rural average. Formal employment is almost 

non-existent at only 4%, and 87% of the rural population have not completed secondary school. 

20.4.2 Social Management Plan 

The approved EIA (2007) included a Social Management Plan (SMP) and there has been a dedicated CSR 

team at site since the start of the project to manage social aspects and obligations.  

During the FS, the SMP was reviewed and updated to comply with current IFC performance standards on 

environmental and social sustainability. This updated SMP integrates the social commitments from the 

approved EIA and satisfies all ongoing IFC requirements, including the following social process manuals: 

 Grievance Mechanism 

 Communication Plan 

 Conjuncture Monitoring 

 Local Relationship 

 Social Commitments Monitoring 

 Contractors and Sub-Contractor Monitoring 

 Social Impact Evaluation 

 Continuous Training 

 Social Investment 

 Corporate Social Alignment 

 Community Requests and Donations 

 Participative Socio-Environmental Monitoring 

 Recruitment: Talent and Human Resources Selection 

 Local Procurement, and 

 Land Access. 

The review of the previous SMP confirmed compliance with the approved EIA commitments. The one non-

conformity highlighted through the SMP review is implementation of a Social Monitoring Committee (SMC). 

The Cerro Blanco team are in the process of setting up a SMC and associated mandate. This initiative is 

fully aligned with Bluestone's Responsible Mining Policy. The information collected by the committee will 

be published and available to the local communities.

20.4.3 Stakeholder Engagement 

A stakeholder engagement plan has been designed and implemented by Bluestone to comply with the IFC 

Performance Standards. Since the project inception, the community relations team has been engaged with 

local stakeholders on an ongoing basis. Specific meetings designed to involve all local stakeholders were 

completed in 2018 during the SBS update and all participants were invited to visit the Cerro Blanco site. A 

calendar of presentations and guided site visits has been developed, allowing all stakeholders the 

opportunity to observe the current activities occurring onsite and meet with the onsite team. These visits 

are intended to be participative and interactive, with all concerns or questions raised registered by the site 

team and improvement and actions implemented, when necessary. 

Bluestone has prioritized continuous communication with project stakeholders. A second round of 

consultation meetings is scheduled for 2019 to ensure all stakeholders remain engaged through the 

development process.  

20.4.4 Social Management System (SMS) 

The project SMS has been reviewed and improved during the FS. A dedicated software has been 

implemented as a tool to register, monitor and report all aspects of the social management program. 

Specific management processes have been developed and implemented, such as a grievance mechanism, 

in order to formalize the responses to any social concerns. This has improved the access to information for 

the onsite team, and resulted in more efficient monitoring and reporting activities. 

20.4.5 Visitor Center 

In line with corporate policies, Bluestone intends to provide interpretive and educational information to the 

local communities. A visitor center is currently under development and is scheduled to open to the public 

in Q1 2019. Detailed information about the project will be presented through various interactive media tools. 

The visitor center is located in the urban area of Asunción Mita where the community relations office was 

previously based, so members of the local community are familiar with the location. The visitor center will 

offer a complete virtual tour of the Cerro Blanco site, with access to online information, brochures, posters 

and other media. A representative of the Project will be permanently available to answer questions, assist 

visitors in understanding the project details and address any concerns.

21 Capital Cost Estimate 

LOM Project capital costs total $335.2 M, consisting of the following distinct phases: 

 Pre-production capital costs – includes all costs to develop the property to a 1,250 tpd production. 

Initial capital costs total $195.7 M and are expended over a 23-month pre-production period on 

engineering, construction and commissioning activities. 

 Sustaining capital costs – includes all costs related to the acquisition, replacement, or major 

overhaul of assets during the mine life required to sustain operations. Sustaining capital costs total 

$129.0 M and are expended in operating Years 1 through 8; and 

 Closure Costs – includes all costs related to the closure, reclamation, and ongoing monitoring of 

the mine, post operations. Closure costs total $10.6 M, and are primarily incurred in Year 9, with 

costs extending into Year 12 for ongoing monitoring activities. 

The capital cost estimate was compiled using a combination of quotations, database costs, and factors; the 

overall cost estimate was benchmarked against similar operations. Table 21-1 presents the capital estimate 

summary for initial and sustaining capital costs in Q4 2018 dollars with no escalation.

Figure 21-1 and Figure 21-2 present the capital cost distribution for the pre-production and sustaining 

phases. As typical with underground operations, the majority of sustaining capital costs relate to 

underground lateral and vertical development. In addition, due to the geothermal nature of the Project, the 

sustaining capital costs include a significant amount of dewatering and injection well installation costs 

(captured under "On-site Infrastructure").

21.3 Scope of the Estimate 

The Project capital estimates include all costs to develop and sustain the project at a commercially operable 

status. The capital costs do not include the costs related to operating consumables inventory purchased 

before commercial production; these costs are considered within the working capital estimate described in 

Section 23. Sunk Costs and Owners Reserve accounts are not considered in the Feasibility Study estimates 

or economic cash flows. 

21.4 Key Estimate Assumptions 

The following key assumptions were made during development of the capital estimate: 

 The capital estimate is based on the contracting strategy, execution strategy, and key dates 

described within the Project Execution Plan described in Section 25 of this report 

 Underground mine development activities will be performed by a Contractor from pre-production to 

the end of Year 2. The Owner's team will take over mine development activities at the start of Year 

3, and 

 All surface construction (including earthworks) will be performed by contractors.

21.6 Basis of Estimate 

21.6.1 Mine Capital Costs 

Capital cost estimates are based on a combination of budgetary quotes from equipment suppliers, in-house 

cost databases and similar mines in Latin America. Table 21-3 summarizes the underground mine capital 

cost estimate. 

  

                                                      
1 ACEE defines a Class 3 estimate as a budget authorization estimate based on 10% to 40% project definition, semi-
detailed unit costs with assembly level line items, and an accuracy of between -20%/+30% and -10%/+10%.

21.6.1.1 Underground Mobile Equipment 

Underground mining equipment quantities and costs were determined through buildup of mine plan 

quantities and associated equipment utilization requirements. Budgetary quotes were received and applied 

to the required quantities. The mining fleet is assumed to be provided by a contractor up to the end of Year 

2, after which the Owner purchases new mobile equipment and takes control of mining development. 

21.6.1.2 Underground Infrastructure 

Design requirements for underground infrastructure were determined from design calculations for 

ventilation, dewatering, and material handling. Budgetary quotations or database costs were used for major 

infrastructure components. Allowances have been made for miscellaneous items, such as initial PPE, 

radios, water supply, refuge stations, and geotechnical investigations. Acquisition of underground 

infrastructure is timed to support the mine plan requirements. 

21.6.1.3 Capital Development 

Capital development includes the labour, fuel, equipment usage, power, and consumables costs for lateral 

and vertical development required for underground access to stopes, and underground infrastructure. 

 Lateral development fuel, equipment usage, power, and consumables requirements were 

developed based on the mine plan requirements. Manufacturer database equipment usage rates 

were applied to the required operating hours; and 

 Lateral development labour requirements were determined by the required equipment fleet in 

operation. Supervision and support services were pro-rated to the development costs, based on 

the mix of underground activities occurring. 

21.6.1.4 Capitalized Production Costs 

Capitalized production costs are defined as mine operating expenses (operating development, mineralized 

material extraction, mine maintenance, and mine general costs) incurred prior to the introduction of feed to

the processing facilities and the commencement of Project revenues. They are included as a pre-production 

capital cost. 

The basis of these costs is described in Section 22, Operating Costs, as they are estimated in the same 

manner. Capitalized production costs are included in the asset value of the mine development and are 

depreciated over the mine life within the financial model. 

21.6.1.5 Contractor Development 

Contractor mine development is based on bid proposals received for Latin American contractors working 

in similar locations and production rates. Unit cost of development and stoping are based on unit costs for 

mine activities including drill, blast, muck, haul, and support. A nominal $250 k was assumed for contractor 

mobilization and demobilization, including the cost to set up and take down any additional site facilities to 

store and maintain equipment. No official contractor bids have been issued as part of this FS mine plan at 

the time of issue, however, rates have been benchmarked against other operations. Table 21-4 outlines 

contractor rates used for capital development.

21.6.2 Surface Construction Costs 

Surface construction costs include site development, mineral processing plant, tailings management facility, 

and on-site and off-site infrastructure. These cost estimates are primarily based on material and equipment 

costs from material take-offs and detailed equipment lists. Pricing for main equipment and bulk materials 

was primarily determined from quoted sources, with some factors applied for minor cost elements. 

Table 21-5 presents a summary basis of estimate for the various commodity types within the surface 

construction estimates. Growth factors were included above neat material take-off quantities for all areas.

22.3.2.1 Labour 

Underground mining staffing levels related to production activities are built up based on the productivities 

(work-hours) required for mining activities occurring within a given time period. As such, mining workforce 

fluctuates throughout the mine life. 

Mine labour (including supervision and support) related to development drifting is distributed between 

capital development (sustaining capital costs) and operating development (operating costs), based on the 

activities being performed within a given time period. As such, only a portion of the mine staffing is allocated 

within the mining operating costs. Table 22-6 below, shows Underground Mining Labour Costs.

23 Economic Analysis 

An engineering economic model was developed to estimate annual cash flows and sensitivities of the 

Project. Pre-tax estimates of Project values were prepared for comparative purposes, while after-tax 

estimates were developed and are likely to approximate the true investment value. It must be noted, 

however, that tax estimates involve many complex variables that can only be accurately calculated during 

operations and, as such, the after-tax results are only approximations. 

Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in metal prices, head grades, operating costs, 

capital costs, and discount rates to determine their relative importance as Project value drivers. 

This technical report contains forward-looking information regarding projected mine production rates, 

construction schedules and forecasts of resulting cash flows as part of this study. The mill head grades are 

based on sufficient sampling that is reasonably expected to be representative of the realized grades from 

actual mining operations. Factors such as the ability to obtain permits to construct and operate a mine, or 

to obtain major equipment or skilled labour on a timely basis, to achieve the assumed mine production rates 

at the assumed grades, may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented in this economic 

analysis. 

The estimates of capital and operating costs have been developed specifically for this Project and are 

summarized in Section 21 and Section 22 of this report (presented in 2019 dollars). The economic analysis 

has been run with no inflation (constant dollar basis). 

23.1 LOM Summary and Assumptions

 Revenues, costs, taxes are calculated for each period in which they occur rather than actual 

outgoing/incoming payment 

 Working capital calculated as one month of operating costs (mining, processing, site services and 

G&A) in Year 1 

 Results are presented on 100% ownership 

 No management fees or financing costs (equity fund-raising was assumed), and 

 The model excludes all pre-development and sunk costs up to the start of detailed engineering (i.e. 

exploration and resource definition costs, engineering fieldwork and studies costs, environmental 

baseline studies costs, financing costs, etc.). 

Table 23-2 outlines the metal prices and exchange rate assumptions used in the economic analysis. The 

gold price selected was based on the 9-month average as of December 2018 and the silver price is in line 

with recently released comparable Technical Reports. 

The reader is cautioned that the metal prices and exchange rates used in this study are only 

estimates based on recent historical performance and there is absolutely no guarantee that they 

will be realized if the Project is taken into production. The metal prices are based on many complex 

factors and there are no reliable long-term predictive tools.

23.3 Taxes 

The Project has been evaluated on an after-tax basis to provide a more indicative, but still approximate, 

value of the potential Project economics. A tax model was prepared by Wentworth Taylor, an independent 

tax consultant, and reviewed by JDS and Bluestone personnel. Current tax pools were used in the analysis. 

The tax model contains the following assumptions: 

 Income Tax: the lesser of 25% on net income for tax purposes or 7% on gross income 

o The tax on gross income applied in for four years for the mine life and the tax of net income 

applied for five years.  

 No state taxes

 VAT modeled with a net zero impact due to expected VAT credits and status as exporter 

 Withholding Taxes assumed to be 5% on royalties 

 Stamp Tax (captured within contingency)  

 Capital cost allowance applied on units of production basis and at specific rates in the tax act – to 

approximate blended CCA rate (~13%), and 

 Exploration carry forwards of $149 M applied on a straight-line basis over five years. 

Total taxes for the Project amount to US$64 M. 

23.4 Royalties 

The Cerro Blanco Project is subject to two royalties – both of which have been included in the economic 

analysis and cash flow model. Table 23-4 outlines the royalty terms. Total royalties for the Project amount 

to US$24 M over the life of mine.

23.5 Results 

The Cerro Blanco Project is economically viable with a post-tax IRR of 34% and a net present value using 

a 5% discount rate (NPV5%) of $241 M using the metal prices described in Section 23.1. Figure 23-2 shows 

the projected cash flows, and Table 23-5 summarizes the economic results of the Cerro Blanco Project. 

The post-tax break-even gold price is approximately US$787/oz, based on the LOM plan presented herein, 

and a silver price of US$18.00/oz. This is the gold price at which the Project NPV @ 0% discount rate is 

zero. 

The life of mine all-in sustaining cost (AISC) and AISC (net of by-product) is US$639/oz, and US$579/oz 

respectively. The straight AISC cost is calculated by adding the refining, transport, royalty, operating, and 

sustaining and closure costs together and dividing by the total payable ounces of gold. This metric does 

not consider the value of silver in the calculation. The AISC (net of by-product) is a similar calculation – it 

adds the refining, transportation, royalty, operating and sustaining and closure costs but subtracts the value 

of the silver before dividing by total payable ounces of gold.

23.6 Sensitivities 

A univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to examine which factors most affect the Project economics 

when acting independently of all other cost and revenue factors. Each variable evaluated was tested using 

the same percentage range of variation, from -25% to +25%, although some variables may actually 

experience significantly larger or smaller percentage fluctuations over the LOM. For instance, the metal 

prices were evaluated at a +/- 25% range to the base case, while the recovery and all other variables 

remained constant. This may not be truly representative of market scenarios, as metal prices may not 

fluctuate in a similar trend. The variables examined in this analysis are those commonly considered in 

similar studies – their selection for examination does not reflect any particular uncertainty.

Notwithstanding the above noted limitations to the sensitivity analysis, which are common to studies of this 

sort, the analysis revealed that the Project is most sensitive to metal prices and head grade. The Project 

showed the least sensitivity to capital costs. Table 23-6 and Figure 23-3 show the results of the sensitivity 

tests, while Table 23-7 shows the NPV at various discount rates.

25 Other Relevant Data and Information 

25.1 Project Execution Plan 

25.1.1 Introduction 

The purpose of the Cerro Blanco Project Execution Plan ("PEP") is to describe the project development 

strategies that were considered for the FS capital cost estimate and project schedule, and to provide the 

future framework for organizing the engineering, procurement, and construction. The PEP will also serve 

as a guide in: 

 Promoting safety in design, construction, and operations to succeed 

 Promoting sustainable social investment and community relations within the area during the 

planning, construction and operations phases 

 Ensuring environmental aspects and impacts of the project are considered completely and 

comprehensively during the construction, operational and post-operational phases of the project, 

and 

 Negotiating contracts with suppliers, contractors, and engineers with proven track records in 

Guatemala. 

Although the PEP provides guidance for executing the Project, the planning stage will evaluate alternate 

execution strategies and other opportunities that add further value overall. This may include items such as 

variations to portions of the execution strategy (i.e. Engineering, Procurement and Construction 

Management (EPCM), Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC), Engineering, Procure and 

Supply (EPS), etc.) or, inclusion of Owner resources for smaller scopes of work. 

25.1.2 Project Development Schedule 

A level 32 schedule was developed for the Project, using the capital cost estimate as the basis for on-site 

work hours to drive activity durations. Figure 25-1 presents a summarized version (level 12) schedule for 

the development of the Cerro Blanco Project. 

The critical path of the schedule runs through the following activities: 

 EPCM contract formation 

 Trial mining and mine detailed engineering 

 Mine cooling and ventilation procurement, delivery and installation 

 New dewatering and injection well development 

 Completion of pre-production mining activities  

 Grinding mills procurement and installation, and

25.1.6.2.3 Design Criteria Approval 

The Project critical path includes timely completion of engineering activities. To prevent delays or late 

changes in engineering deliverables and to keep efforts focused, an approval procedure will be developed 

and adhered to. 

25.1.6.2.4 Engineering Progress and Performance Monitoring 

Each engineering contractor will provide a deliverables list as part of their services proposal. Deliverables 

(and their associated budgets) will be grouped into logical Engineering Work Packages (EWPs), which will 

be used as the metric for tracking engineering progress for the Project.  

25.1.7 Procurement and Contracting 

25.1.7.1 Procurement Execution Strategy 

The general procurement execution strategy for the Project will include utilizing known suppliers, with a 

preference for local or regional suppliers and construction contractors. The commercial manager (with input 

from the technical manager) will have overall responsibility for the majority of pre-purchased procurement 

and contract formation activities. Contract administration will be the responsibility of the commercial 

manager. 

25.1.7.2 Construction Contracting Strategy 

Table 25-1 presents a listing of the major contract packages identified for the Project. For the purpose of 

the Feasibility Study, all mechanical, piping, electrical, and instrumentation (MPEI) works have been 

identified as performed by a single entity within the Project estimate and schedule. During project execution, 

a minimum of two MPEI contractors will be engaged to avoid reliance on the performance of a single entity. 

During contractor pre-qualifications, if multi-discipline contractors cannot be sourced, then a horizontal 

contracting strategy will be employed (separate contractors for each trade, i.e. mechanical, piping, 

electrical, and instrumentation). 

Construction Work Packages (CWPs) will be developed to manage the execution of the scopes of work on 

site. A CWP is an executable construction deliverable that is defined by logical subdivision of the overall 

construction scope into manageable packages based primarily on geographical boundaries that do not 

overlap. It includes a budget and schedule that can be compared against actual performance and used to 

track construction progress. The CWP's will be used as a scoping document for Requests for Proposal's, 

contracts, and / or portions of contract. 

The strategy for the underground mining activities on the Project is to use a mining contractor to install the 

UG infrastructure, complete pre-production development, and execute the first two years of operations.

25.1.7.3 Procurement Schedule and Critical Activities 

The major procurement phase of the Project will occur in Year -2. Procurement activities will be prioritized 

to schedule critical items, both due to fabrication/delivery time of the equipment (such as the mine cooling 

and dewatering infrastructure, paste pumps and grinding mill package), and due to the necessity to obtain 

certified vendor data to complete structural and foundation designs. Table 25-2 presents the critical and 

long lead packages for the Project, with estimated lead times shown in weeks After Receipt of Order (ARO).

Tendering and award of the following packages are considered time critical (on or near critical path): 

 EPCM contractor selection 

 Dewatering and injection well drilling 

 Procurement of ball mills 

 Procurement of dewatering and injection wells pumps 

 UG mine contractor selection, and 

 Detailed engineering contracts, particularly for UG mining, dewatering, processing and paste plant 

packages. 

25.1.7.4 Selection of Suppliers and Contractors 

A competitive bidding process will be applied to achieve the best commercial and technical results from the 

procurement effort. During the project setup phase, preferred vendors will be identified (where deemed to 

add value to the project) and sole source strategies implemented into the procurement plan. Local 

involvement will form part of the bid evaluation scoring criteria to give preference for suppliers and 

contractors in Guatemala, and whenever possible, the local area of Asunción Mita and Jutiapa. 

The level of vendor quality surveillance / inspection (VQS) required for each package will be established 

during bid evaluations and will be determined by evaluating a supplier's ability to achieve suitable quality 

according to specifications and project QA requirements. 

25.1.7.5 Alternatives and / or Variations to the Procurement and Contracting Strategy 

During the project setup phase, the Project Team will evaluate, assess and implement alternates and / or 

variations to the Procurement and Contracting Strategy that will add value or de-risk the project. Variations 

may include changes to the scope of the contracts, the number of contracts, or the number of contractors 

on site depending on the results of the contractor pre-qualifications or the detailed engineering. Alternatives 

may include an EPS or EPC contract for portions of the project scope.

25.1.8.5 Site Materials Strategy 

The general strategy for site materials control is as follows: 

 Control and supervise materials movement at site through materials / inventory control from 

receiving, preservation, inventory, and free-issue to contractor to meet the Project requirements for 

all equipment and materials procured by the construction team or EM (i.e. process equipment) 

 Include in contractor's scope requirements for receipt, storage, and retrieval of procured materials 

required for its work 

 Utilize a common labour pool for warehouse and laydown staff (equipment operators and labourers) 

to support the management and movement of freight, except for items requiring special handling 

or rigging (such as structural steel), and 

 Utilize a temporary warehouse for the receipt and storage of all equipment requiring climate 

controlled indoor storage. Equipment and material that do not require climate-controlled storage 

will be stored in laydown areas within the construction site. Use of sea containers and/or temporary 

shelters will be required to store goods that need to be protected during construction. 

25.1.9 Construction 

25.1.9.1 Construction Execution Plan Overview 

The main objectives of the construction execution strategy include: 

 Execute all activities with a goal of zero harm to people, assets, the environment, or reputation 

 Strive to eliminate process, operational and maintenance safety hazards 

 Meet or exceed environmental regulatory and permit requirements to minimize impact 

 Cultivate an atmosphere of positive social impact in the surrounding communities 

 Deliver a high-quality facility that meets or exceeds the defined project goals 

 Establish and maintain a high level of motivation by providing a positive working environment for 

all personnel 

 Identify and remove barriers that affect project progress, and 

 Recognize, identify and communicate outstanding achievements during construction and 

commissioning of the Project. 

25.1.9.2 Site Management 

During the construction Phase, the Project Director (or his designate) will be responsible for the 

development and construction areas. The EPCM Site Manager and EM General Manager will closely 

coordinate site activities, and responsibilities will be separated for areas such as the underground mine.

turned over to EM for ownership and operation. A detailed Commissioning Plan will be developed during 

detailed engineering. 

25.1.10.2 Commissioning Safety and Training 

The Health, Safety, and Environmental Plan (HSE Plan) developed during execution will address specific 

safety procedures that will apply during the commissioning stage of the Project. The commissioning and 

turnover phase presents significant and unique safety risks. A comprehensive lock-out tag-out program is 

an effective control to manage these risks. 

25.1.10.3 Commissioning Stages 

 Construction Release (Stage 1): Construction contractor completes a system subject to agreed

26 Interpretations and Conclusions 

26.1 Risks 

It is the conclusion of the Qualified Persons that the Feasibility Study summarized in this technical report 

contains adequate detail and information to support a feasibility level analysis. Standard industry practices, 

equipment and design methods were used in this Feasibility Study and except for those outlined in this 

section, the report authors are unaware of any unusual or significant risks or uncertainties that would affect 

project reliability or confidence based on the data and information made available. 

For these reasons, the path going forward should continue to focus on obtaining permit amendments for 

injection wells and new permits for the access road and power line, while concurrently advancing key 

activities that will reduce and de-risk the project execution schedule. 

Risk is present in any development project. Feasibility engineering formulates design and engineering 

solutions to reduce that risk common to every mining project such as resource uncertainty, mining recovery 

and dilution control, metallurgical recoveries, environmental and social impact, political risks, schedule and 

cost overruns, and labour sourcing. JDS is of the opinion that these risks have been clearly identified and 

mitigation measures have been considered. 

Table 26-1 identifies what are currently deemed to be the most significant internal Project risks, potential 

impacts, and possible mitigation approaches.

Table 26-1: Main Project Risks 

Risk Explanation / Potential Impact Possible Risk Mitigation 

Permitting 

While the project is fully permitted and has an approved EIA in 

place, permit amendments are required for injection of mine 

water and new EIAs/permits are required for the power line 

and access road. Potential delays in approval of permit 

amendments and/or new permits could results in increased 

duration of assumed project development schedule.  

Proceed with application of permit amendments and new 

EIAs/permits immediately to mitigate potential schedule 

impact. Continued discussions with local regulatory bodies 

are required to ensure avoidance of unforeseen delays in 

permitting. 

Groundwater 

Groundwater inflows have been modelled and the mine 

development plan addresses estimated flows as well as 

potential variations that can be controlled by mining 

techniques. Increases in the actual amount of groundwater 

encountered would impact development costs and/or 

schedule. 

Drilling for drainage, and operational definition drilling 

included in the mine plan will help to identify specific water 

bearing zones with higher than expected flows to establish 

control and/or management procedures. Initiating well 

development earlier in the mine life to allow more time for 

dewatering may also prove to be an effective mitigation 

measure. 

In addition, a mine plan should be developed to only 

consider mining the ore body above the current water table 

to determine impact on project economics. 

Dewatering and Injection Wells 

Performance of dewatering and injection wells is based on 

simulations of the calibrated groundwater model. Once wells 

are installed, there is potential that they may not perform as 

expected (either in terms of inflows or injection capacities), 

resulting in a requirement for additional wells, and ultimately 

an increase in assumed project schedule and cost. 

Additional scope contingency has been included in CAPEX 

for dewatering and injection wells to allow for drilling of 

additional wells, if required, without impacting project cost.

Risk Explanation / Potential Impact Possible Risk Mitigation 

Complexity of Ore Body 

The complexity of the ore body could potentially lead to 

increased mining dilution. Grade control and proper mining 

execution will maintain minimal unplanned dilution, which 

would minimize potential impacts on grade, throughput, and 

operating costs. 

Test stoping will help to verify dilution estimates. The 

potential for ore sorting should also be further evaluated to 

determine if it can be incorporated into the project design. 

Tightly Coupled Project 
Schedule 

Project components are tightly coupled within the schedule 

and there are many critical components that have to be 

completed without delay in order to maintain desired 

development targets 

Advancement of key activities, such as drilling of new wells 

and application for permit amendments should be pursued 

as soon as possible. 

Tailings and Waste Rock 
Geochemistry 

Tailings and waste rock are assumed to be Non-Acid 

Generating (NAG) due to testwork completed to date (and 

limited exposure time at surface for waste rock). Additional 

testwork is required prior to detail engineering in order to 

confirm this assumption. If classification is changed to 

Potentially-Acid Generating (PAG), then a liner needs to be 

included in future design, resulting in increased capital cost 

Geochemistry testing costs are included in the project 

budget and should be carried out prior to detail 

engineering. 

Power Cost 

The cost of grid power is based on a market survey and not an 

actual power supply agreement. A higher power cost would 

result in increased operating costs 

Negotiate and secure a power supply agreement. 

Socio-Political Risk 

Although the local community is favorable to the development 

of Cerro Blanco as an underground mine, there is a potential 

risk of socio-political opposition to mine development which 

could adversely impact the project development schedule 

Continue to monitor and update stakeholder engagements 

through the site Community Relations team. The 

development of close relationships with the local 

communities, land owners and government along with 

implementation of the EMP and SMP is required.

Risk Explanation / Potential Impact Possible Risk Mitigation 

Land Negotiations 

There is a potential for schedule delays due to negotiating 

land agreements for areas impacted outside of the property 

boundary (i.e. access road / powerline right-of-ways and 

injection well pads) 

Engage in land negotiations promptly  

Working Days per year 
Mine plan assumes 365 day operation with no allowance for 
down days. Potential impact on mine throughput and annual 
ounce delivery to market. 

Over-mine where possible to keep adequate stockpiles to 
mill during periods of unscheduled downtime. 

Ability to Attract 
Experienced/Trained Local 
Labour 

The ability to attract and retain competent, experienced local 
labour is a key success factor for the Project. 

The early search for trained labour as well as competitive 
salaries and benefits identify, attract and retain critical local 
personnel. 

High turnover or the lack of appropriate technical staff at the 
Project could result in difficulties meeting Project goals. 

Further opportunity may exist in hiring trained labour from 
the Marlin mine which has been in closure since 2017.

26.2 Opportunities 

This Feasibility Study has highlighted several opportunities to increase mine profitability and project 

economics and reduce identified risks. These are summarized in Table 26-2.

Table 26-2: Identified Project Opportunities 

Opportunity Explanation Potential Benefit 

Resource Conversion 
Through additional infill diamond drilling, there is an opportunity to 
increase the Measured Category from Indicated and the Indicated 
Resource Category from Inferred. 

Additional gold and silver ounces in the Measured and 
Indicated Resource resulting in additional gold and silver 
ounces in the Mining Reserves, which has potential to improve 
economic results. 

Resource Expansion 
With additional diamond drilling, there is an opportunity to 
discover and develop additional veins and extend known veins to 
increase resources. 

Additional gold and silver ounces in the Measured and 
Indicated Resource resulting in additional gold and silver 
ounces in the Mining Reserves, which has potential to improve 
economic results. 

Ore Sorting 
Initial tests indicate the ore at Cerro Blanco is amenable to ore 
sorting.  

While additional test work is recommended on rock samples 
representative of the mine plan, if ore sorting is implemented 
in the process design it will result in opportunities to reduce 
plant size and/or allow for more flexibility in mining method by 
mitigating potential increased dilution. 

Paste Plant 
There is potential to defer the requirement for a paste plant up to 
three years by using cemented rock fill for rib pillars. 

Deferral of capital and improved economic results. 

Target Underground 
Cooling Temperature 

Increase in target wet bulb temperature from 28°C. 
Reduced cooling plant requirement and potentially reduced 
initial and sustaining capital costs. 

Capacity of Surface 
Discharge 

The FS water management plan doesn't use the maximum 
permitted surface discharge capacity for treated water, since a 
portion of the treated water is being returned to the process plant 
as make-up water. The WTP can be expanded to allow for 
increased treatment capacity to maximize the permitted water 
discharge rate. In addition, treated groundwater could potentially 
be delivered to the local communities in the dry season to satisfy 
agricultural requirements 

Reduced injection requirements and capital costs associated 
with drilling of new injection wells. 

Geothermal Energy 
Recovery 

While not part of the FS design, there is potential to recover 
energy from hot mine water. 

Reduction in site power requirements from the grid and lower 
operating costs. 

DSTF Construction 
Sequencing 

Because the DSTF is constructed continuously over its 
operational life using the downstream construction method, 
concurrent reclamation is not be possible. Future designs could 
be modified to incorporate concurrent reclamation. 

Potential reduction in sustaining/closure costs.

27 Recommendations 

Based on the Feasibility Study results, it is recommended to advance the Project to construction and 

development, and then production. The recommended development path is to continue efforts in obtaining 

the environmental permit amendments for groundwater injection and new EIA/permits for the access road 

and power line, while concurrently advancing key activities that will reduce and de-risk the project execution 

schedule. Associated project risks are deemed manageable; and identified opportunities can provide 

enhanced economic value. 

The project exhibits robust economics with the assumed gold price, currency exchange rates, and 

consumables pricing. Value engineering and recommended fieldwork should be advanced in conjunction 

with preparation of permit amendments to de-risk the construction schedule and minimize costs. 

From the identified project risks and opportunities, the following activities are noted as critical actions that 

have the potential to strengthen the project and further reduce risk: 

 Complete additional infill diamond drilling to convert more of the Inferred Mineral Resource into 

Measured and Indicated resources  

 Conduct trial mining (i.e. test stoping), as early as possible, to verify dilution estimates, confirm drift 

dimensions and support designs, and vein geometry 

 Conduct further test work on the viability of employing ore sorting technology as a method of 

rejecting waste in the plant feed and increasing head grade in the process plant 

 Investigate potential for purchasing used equipment to reduce project capital costs, and 

 Develop a mine plan to only consider ore body above the current water table to determine impact 

on project economics. 

Table 27-1 provides an estimate for each of the activities recommended above.
