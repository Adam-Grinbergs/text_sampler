KNICK EXPLORATION INC., NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT, OGDEN PROPERTY

SOLUMINES 4

3.0) SUMMARY

The Ogden property is situated in Ogden township, which is part of the Timmins mining camp. The

property is located 12 km in a straight line to the SW of the city of Timmins, and is covered by NTS

sheet 42A/06. It is made of eight unpatented mining claims totalling 1,120 ha. and expiring between

December 31, 2010 and January 11, 2011. Assessment work required for claims renewal amounts

to $27,400; there are currently no assessment credits on the claims.

Knick Exploration Inc. acquired the property from North American Exploration Ltd. on June 1, 2009,

in exchange for a cash payment of $6,206 and 300,000 common shares of Knick. The property

remains subject to two royalties: a 2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty on all smeltable minerals or

metals extracted from the property, and a 2% gross overriding receipts (GOR) royalty on all

diamonds extracted from the claims. One percent (1%) of either royalty can be bought back for $1

million, and Knick has a right of first refusal on all or part of the remaining 1%.

To the best knowledge of the author there are no environmental liabilities pertaining to the Ogden

property. The property is easily accessible, being traversed by the Wawiatin road off provincial

highway #101. There is no mining infrastructure on the property. All the personal, services and

equipment required to carry out exploration and eventually mine an orebody are readily available in

the city of Timmins, which has a long, rich mining history.

From 1946 to 2004, several mining companies carried out exploration on the property, the main

players being Tex-sol Exploration, Mattagami Lake Mines, Noranda Exploration, Inmet Mining

Corporation and Haddington Resources. To date, a number of magnetic and IP surveys have been

completed on parts of the property, as well as 24 diamond drill holes and reverse circulation holes

totalling 2,045 m. Tex-Sol obtained the most interesting results, with three non-contiguous

mineralized intersections of 12 g/t Au over 1.52 m in Hole #1 drilled in 1965. Subsequent attempts

by Tex-Sol and later by Gossan Resources failed to duplicate these results.

Geologically, the property is located in the SE part of the Superior geological province, and more

precisely in the Abitibi subprovince. In the Timmins area, the Abitibi subprovince is subdivided into

nine assemblages with ages ranging from 2670 to 2730 Ma, the youngest being the sedimentary

rocks of the Timiskaming Assemblage and the oldest the volcanic rocks of the Deloro Group.

The Ogden property is underlain by the volcanic rocks of the Deloro Group and the metasedimentary

rocks of the Porcupine Group. The property is situated less than one kilometre south of the



KNICK EXPLORATION INC., NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT, OGDEN PROPERTY

SOLUMINES 5

Porcupine-Destor Fault, which marks the boundary between the Deloro and Tisdale groups.

Although the bulk of the gold produced from the Timmins mining camp, approximately 68 million

ounces, was mined from the Tisdale Group, several gold occurrences and mines can be found in the

Deloro Group. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Naybob and Faymar mines, both located in the Deloro

Group, produced 178,650 tonnes and 108,800 tonnes respectively at grades of 6.2 and 6.3 g/t Au.

This is an indication of the potential of the Deloro Group.

Exploration on the Ogden property will be aimed at two types of deposit:

ÔÇ∑ The Archean mesothermal type, as the property contains several lithological contacts and

faults. This is the type of orebody generally seen in the Tisdale Group of rocks;

ÔÇ∑ The Archean hypothermal type or greenstone-hosted quartz-carbonate vein deposit, as

seen in Tex-Sol's Hole # 1, with gold values associated with a silicified fragmental rock in

an altered ultramafic rock.

Since its acquisition by Knick, line cutting, with corresponding magnetic and VLF surveys and 25.4

km of induced polarization (I.P) have been completed in the central part of the property. Two strong

magnetic anomalies were located along with major faulting. One of them, the most westerly, is

probably the Mattagami River Fault, which marks the limit between the sediments and volcanics.

Several moderate to strong VLF anomalies oriented almost perpendicular to the main structures

probably represent subsidiary faulting.

The I.P survey revealed 4 clusters of anomalies. Once cultural effects (power line, roads etc)

removed, real anomalies remain, located at depth varying from 30 to 80 m. At these depths they can

not be explained by trenching or prospecting, but only by diamond drilling.

The Ogden property geology is a favourable environment for gold deposits, as it is located close to

the Porcupine-Destor Fault and covers both tholeiitic and calk-alkalic metavolcanic rocks in contact

with sedimentary rocks along the Mattagami River Fault. Several cherty iron formations have also

been mapped on the property in the past and can potentially have trapped gold mineralization.

The author strongly believes that a systematic exploration program is required to determine the

property's gold potential. A two-phase exploration program is recommended. The first phase will

include line cutting followed by IP and magnetic surveys over the entire property. A geological

survey over the main anomalous zones and a satellite photo interpretation will help define the best

drill targets. Finally, diamond drilling is recommended to test the selected anomalies.

If warranted, a second phase consisting exclusively of diamond drilling is recommended to test the

remaining anomalous zones and any other zones with a favourable geological setting. A detailed

readily available in Timmins. Equipment can be transported from its loading point to the Ogden

property by road.

7.D) CLIMATE5

The property is in a humid continental climate zone characterized par warm summers, mainly in July,

cold winters and abundant rain. Daily average temperatures range from +17.40 C in July to -17.50 C

in January. Annual precipitation averages 558 mm of rain and 313 cm of snow. These are normal

conditions in the northern Ontario context and do not hamper exploration or mining work.

8.0) HISTORY

Exploration was first reported on the property in 1946 by Goldmont Porcupine Mining Syndicate Ltd.,

with a magnetic survey in the SE part of the current Ogden property. Four holes were

recommended, but no further follow-up was reported. In 1958, Hollinger Mines Ltd. drilled four holes

approximately 500 m N of the NW property boundary. Sedimentary rocks, mainly in the form of

greywackes, were intercepted. The drill core was completely sampled; unfortunately, the assays

results were not reported.

From 1958 to 1964, no exploration was reported. In 1964, Tex-Sol Explorations Ltd. did ground

magnetometer and electromagnetic surveys. The magnetometer survey revealed an anomaly varying

in strength from 8,000 to 12,000 gammas on a background of 500 to 700 gammas in the NE part of

the property. The EM survey did not revealed any anomalies. The geophysical surveys were

followed in 1965 by three diamond drill holes totalling 1,095 feet (333.8 m). The holes, numbered 1,

2 and 3, cut mainly ultramafic rocks, reported as soapstone in the drill logs. Three gold intersections

were obtained in Hole #1, with:

ÔÄ≠ 0.35 oz Au/ton over 5' from 340' to 345';

ÔÄ≠ 0.35 oz Au/ton over 5' from 350' to 355'; and

ÔÄ≠ 0.35 oz Au/ton over 5' from 365' to 370'

in what is described as a "siliceous fragmental, fine pyrite throughout, pepper and salt" in an

ultramafic unit (soapstone). Hole #2, drilled 140' (42.7 m) north of Hole #1 with the same dip (-45¬∞)

and azimuth (N) failed to return any gold values. Hole #3, a vertical hole drilled 50' (15.2 m) E of

Hole # 2, intercepted fragmental rocks, but no assays are reported.

At around the same time in 1967, H.D. Carlson mapped Ogden Township on behalf of the Ontario

Geological Survey. Eleven years later, the same geologist, H.D Carlson, did a VLF-EM-16 survey

over the NE part of the property. Several anomalies were detected, but were determined to be

caused by variations in overburden thickness. The property was later optioned by Mattagami Lake

Mines, and an IP survey was completed, with the following technical parameters: dipole-dipole

electrode configuration, electrode separation of 200 feet, with n = 1 to 4. Three weak anomalies

were discovered. No further follow-up was done by Mattagami Lake Mines.

In 1980, Gossan Resources Ltd., held the NE part of the actual Ogden property. An evaluation

report was completed by R.J Bradshaw, and four drill holes were recommended to test the gold

intersections obtained by Tex-Sol Exploration in 1965. One year later, in 1981, five holes numbered

C-81-1 to C-81-5 were drilled for a total of 2,000' (609.8 m). These five holes were drilled in the

vicinity of the hole that intersected three gold values of 12 g/t over 1.52 m in 1965. However, they

failed to confirm the Tex-Sol gold intersections and, in fact, to return any anomalous gold values.

In 1982, D.R. Pyke carried out river and stream sediment sampling on his own claims located along

the Grassy River, in the SW part of the Ogden property. The goal of this survey was to verify the

possibility of a gold placer occurrence. Nineteen samples were collected. Only one anomalous

value of 3 g/t Au was obtained from the heavy mineral concentrate in Sample #P-60.

Noranda Exploration was the next company to carry out exploration, performing an exploration

program on the N part of the property in 1985, with nine RC7 holes totalling 245.9 m for an average

depth of 27 m. Au and Ag analytical results for bedrock chips did not return Au or Ag values; heavy

mineral concentrates were sent to the laboratory but no results are indicated in the report.

From 1986 to 1996, no exploration work was reported. In 1997-8, Inmet Mining Corporation explored

the Croxall-Kangas project, which covers the W part of the current Ogden property. Inmet did 32.4

km of magnetic surveying. Two intrusions and two NE trending faults were located. The magnetic

survey was followed by 19 km of Phase IP8 covering the SW part of the property; several weak IP

anomalies were discovered. In 1998, Inmet did diamond drilling on the same Croxall-Kangas project,

but this time, the holes were drilled to the S of the Ogden property. During the same period, in 1998,

Haddington Resources completed 44.6 km of magnetic and VLF surveying over the N part of the

property. One major EM anomaly likely due to a fault was located, along with four magnetic highs

interpreted as an iron formation. An IP survey was recommended, but apparently was not executed.

Still in 1998, Noront Resources completed 3.7 km of magnetic and VLF surveying on a property

adjacent to the property held by Haddington Resources, to the W. The VLF did not detect any

anomalies, and one magnetic anomaly was interpreted as a probable iron formation.

The latest exploration was reported by Porcupine Joint Venture (between Placer Dome and Kinross

Gold Corp.), with one hole totalling 200 m drilled in the NE part of the property. No gold values were

intercepted.

9.1) REGIONAL GEOLOGY

The Ogden property is located in the SE part of the Superior geological province, itself situated at the

heart of the Canadian Shield. The Superior province extends from Manitoba to Quebec, and is

mainly made up of rocks Archean in age (>2.5Ga). Generally, metamorphism is at the greenschist

facies, except in the vicinity of the intrusive rocks, where it can attain the amphibolite to granulite

facies. Figure 3, "General Geological Setting", shows the location of the property in the south-

eastern part of the Superior province.

were deposited unconformably on deep water turbidite sediments of the Porcupine assemblage.

Coeval with the Porcupine sediments are the "Krist" felsic fragmental rocks dated at 2687 Ma. The

Krist is considered to be the extrusive equivalent to the quartz feldspar porphyries in the Timmins

area of similar age.

Underlying Tisdale assemblage rocks have an age of 2710 to 2706 Ma and consist predominantly of

mafic to felsic volcanic rocks and are further subdivided into a series of nine sequence formations.

The Tisdale assemblage rocks, particularly mafic volcanic rocks with high iron tholeiitic affinity, are

the most productive for gold mineralization. Variolitic lavas of the Vipond Formation in the Tisdale

assemblage provide useful volcanostratigraphic marker horizons. Deloro assemblage rocks

immediately underlie the Tisdale assemblage and consist of mafic to felsic volcanic rocks with minor

banded iron formation and clastic sediments near the top of the sequence.

The Shaw dome is a structural feature south of Timmins that juxtaposes iron formation and Deloro

assemblage rocks against Tisdale assemblage komatiitic rocks, yielding deposits of magmatic

massive sulphide and nickel mineralization. Coincident with the north boundary of the Shaw dome,

the Porcupine Destor Fault is a major structural feature that is spatially related to many of the

Timmins gold deposits."9

The immediate vicinity of the property is underlain by the rocks of the Tisdale and Deloro Groups.

They are in mutual contact along the Porcupine ‚Äì Destor fault, which is located immediately north of

the Ogden property. The Deloro Group forms the oldest rock assemblage in the Timmins area and is

immediately overlaid by the Tisdale formation. The timeline for the evolution10 in the Timmins area is

illustrated in Figure 4 below:

9.3) PROPERTY GEOLOGY

The Ogden property is underlain by sedimentary rocks of the Porcupine Group and the volcanic

rocks of the Deloro Group. The west part of the property is covered by clastic and chemical

sedimentary rocks which are believed to be part of the Porcupine Sedimentary Group. They are in

contact to the east with the volcanic rocks of the Deloro Group along the north-south striking

Mattagami River Fault. The E-W striking Bristol fault is located immediately north of the property, in

sedimentary rocks. This same Bristol fault has been recognized 7 km further west on the Timmins

West property of Lake Shore Gold Inc, approximately 150 m north of the deposit.11

The geology east of the Mattagami River Fault, which is part of the Deloro Group, is divided into two

units, north and south. The north unit is the domain of the calc-alkalic felsic to mafic metavolcanic

rocks, in which several horizon of cherty iron formation occur. The north part of this rock series ends

at the Porcupine-Destor Fault, less than one kilometre north of the Ogden property. The south unit is

composed of tholeiitic mafic to intermediate metavolcanic rocks. All the rock formations on the

property are cut by north-south trending diabase dykes. A small granodioritic stock, about 1 km x 2

km, occurs several hundred metres north-east of the property.

An airborne geophysical survey (electromagnetic and magnetic) performed in 1988 by Geoterrex on

behalf of Ontario Geological Survey did not revealed any electromagnetic anomalies. The magnetic

survey roughly outlined the geological units already described. The strike of the formations is

generally E-W with a dip close to vertical. Outcrops on the property are very scarce; from historical

drilling, overburden depth varies from a maximum of 44 m to a minimum of 1.5 m. The property

geology is illustrated in Figure 6 on the next page.

10.0) DEPOSIT TYPES

Historically, the Timmins district has been a major gold producer, with over 68 million ounces of gold

mined in the immediate vicinity of Timmins. Almost all the gold mines in the Timmins area are located

in the Tisdale Group, which overlies the Deloro Group. Over the years, many gold showings have

been found in the Deloro Group, along with two past producers, the Naybob and the Faymar mines,

located in Ogden and Deloro townships respectively.

The Naybob12 mine produced 238,000 tonnes grading 6.3 g/t Au and 0.6 g/t Ag from 1932 to 1945;

the Faymar13 mine produced a total of 108,800 tonnes grading 6.3 g/t Au and 3.8 g/t Ag from 1940 to

1942, as well as 635 tonnes recovered in 1979 during crown pillar recovery.

Generally, the gold deposits in the Tisdale Group are of the Archean mesothermal type, where the

gold mineralization is better developed in areas of structural heterogeneity such as lithological

contacts, and near intrusions.

However, in 1967, Carlson, who mapped Ogden, Deloro and Shaw townships, described four types

of gold occurrences in the Deloro Group of rocks:

1) In lensing quartz and quartz carbonates veins in sheared volcanic rocks in the general

vicinity of sialic porphyry dykes;

2) In quartz stringers which appear to occupy tension fractures of no great lateral extent near

the contacts of some greenstone flow rocks and in some porphyry dykes;

3) In coarse cubic pyrite associated with secondary quartz vein material which impregnates

and cements fractured and brecciated cherty banded iron formation units;

4) In quartz-carbonates stringer and veinlet stockworks in zone of intense carbonate

alteration of the volcanic rocks.14

Based on these observations, two types of deposit will be explored for on the Ogden property:

1) The Archean mesothermal type, as the property contains several lithological contacts and

faults;

2) The Archean hypothermal type or greenstone hosted quartz-carbonate vein deposits, as

seen in Tex-Sol's Hole #1, with gold values associated with a silicified fragmental rock in an

altered ultramafic rock. See Item 11, "Mineralization", for the results obtained.

Figure 715 shows the depths of formation for the epithermal, mesothermal and hypothermal types of

gold deposit. Figure 816 illustrates the orebodies of the area, with their relation to the main fault

zones.

FIGURE 8: MAIN OREBODIES OF THE AREA IN RELATION WITH THE MAJOR FAULTS

11.0) MINERALIZATION

There are no mineralized zones with estimated resources on the Ogden property. However, Hole #1

drilled by Tex-Sol in 1965 in the NE part of the property at UTM coordinates 467924E/5359457N,

Zone 17, Nad 27, returned the following values:

ÔÄ≠ 12 g/t Au over 1.52 m from 103.66 to 105.18 m;

ÔÄ≠ 12 g/t Au over 1.52 m from 106.71 to 108.23 m;

ÔÄ≠ 12 g/t Au over 1.52 m from 111.28 to 112.8 m,

These gold values are associated with what is described in the drill log as a "silicified fragmental, fine

pyrite throughout, pepper and salt", enclosed in what is described as a soapstone, which is probably

an altered ultramafic. There is not enough information in the Tex-Sol report to clearly establish the

relation between sample length and true thickness.

12.0) EXPLORATION

Since acquiring the property, Knick has completed 48.7 km of line cutting followed by the

corresponding magnetic and VLF17 surveys on the central part of the property. An IP18 survey

totalling 25.4 km was completed from April 20, 2010 to June 16, 2010.

The magnetic survey revealed two high magnetic anomalies in the north and middle part of the

survey. They are both strong and the middle is cut by a structural feature, probably a major fault, to

the west. This is further confirmed by the interpretation map completed by geophysicist Marc Boivin,

P.Geo. In fact, two major faults have been interpreted on the western part of the survey, the most

westerly one being probably the Mattagami River Fault, which marks the boundary between the

sediments to the west and the volcanics to the east.

Several VLF anomalies were located. They vary in strength from weak to strong, and possibly

represent subsidiary structures, as they are generally oriented almost perpendicular to the main

structures. A magnetic map and geophysical interpretation map can be found in Schedule 2 to this

report. Magnetic and VLF surveys were completed by Knick's personnel.

The Phase I.P survey was done using a dipole-dipole electrode configuration with a dipole dimension

of 50 m with n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Survey was executed by crews of R√©my B√©langer Geophysics

of Rouyn-Noranda, Qu√©bec and the interpretation was completed by G√©rard Lambert, Eng. Four

clusters of I.P anomalies were located by the survey, they are described by G. Lambert, hereafter.

"Cluster #1 is located in the southern portion of the grid, between L-677E and L-680E and between

about 57500N and 57900N. It consists of about 9 individual I.P. anomalies and includes a number of

I.P. anomalies that are believed to be of cultural origin, given the proximity of two power lines with

grounded wires in that area. However the following anomaly is to be considered of probable bedrock

origins: L-680E at about 57650N, far enough from any cultural sources so as to be considered

legitimate. Reasonable amplitude on the phase and even possibly a slight decrease in resistivity.

Depth to top at about 75m.

Cluster #2 is located in the central-west portion of the grid, between L-676E and L-680E and

between about 58400N and 58600N. It consists of about 9 to 10 individual I.P. anomalies and

includes a number of I.P. anomalies that are believed to be of cultural origin, given the proximity of

one power line with grounded wires, along the access road leading to the hydro-electric plant to the

south. However the following anomalies are to be considered of probable bedrock origins: (a) L-676E

at about 58575N, far enough from any cultural sources so as to be considered legitimate. Nice

amplitude on the phase, and even possibly a slight decrease in resistivity. Depth to top at about 50m.

(b) L-677E at about 58500N, far enough from cultural sources so as to be considered legitimate.

Reasonable amplitude on the phase. Depth to top at about 75m. (c) L-679E at about 58450N, maybe

not far enough from any cultural sources so as to be considered legitimate, but a very well-defined

anomaly. Depth to top at about 80m.

Cluster #3 is located in the central-east portion of the grid, between L-682E and L-686E and between

about 58800N and 59000N. It consists of about 8 individual I.P. anomalies and includes a number of

I.P. anomalies that are believed to be of cultural origin, given the proximity of one power line with

grounded steel towers and wires. However the following anomalies are to be considered of probable

bedrock origins: (a) L-682E at about 58625N, far enough from any cultural sources so as to be

considered legitimate. Well defined anomaly, nice amplitude on the phase, with a slight increase in

resistivity. Depth to top at about 30m. (b) L-683E at about 59020N and L-684E at about 59000N.

Somewhat weak but mainly because it is deep, located in what appears to be a bedrock depression

through at maybe 70m depth. (c) L-685E at about 58850N and 58910N and L-686E at about 58825N.

Two closely spaced responses near a bedrock depression, depth to top of about 30m with Phase

getting definitely stronger at N-5 and N-6 (therefore at depth). An attractive target.

Cluster #4 is located in the northern portion of the grid, and is fairly broad and extensive, covering an

area between L-676E and L-686E (one kilometer-long) and between about 594N and 600N (600

meters-wide). It is believed that no cultural contributions are present within this cluster. At least 24

anomalies can be recognized within this cluster. Some of them are deep (as on L-677E at 59400N,

59525N and 59800N) whereas a few are a little shallower (as on L-679E at 59675N). A few

anomalies are associated with higher resistivity environment (as on L-682E and L-683E, from

59700N to 59900N). The northernmost anomaly on L-684E, near 59900N is quite nice.

The I.P. anomalies listed above probably originate from metallic accumulations in the form of

disseminated to stringer sulphides at relatively substantial depths (30m-80m) in the bedrock. For

the time being, it is believed that they occur in the form of sub-vertical tabular mineralized zones. It

is my opinion that they constitute defendable exploration target on the property, at least from a

geophysical point of view. It is quite unlikely that any of the anomalies will be within reach of surface

prospecting and/or trenching.

Other less significant I.P. responses could bethe result of minor sulphide contents in the bedrock or

to the presence of other polarizable minerals such as phyllosilicates (micas, particularly biotite), or

crystalline magnetite." I.P and resistivity maps for n=3 are given in schedule 3 of this report.

16.0) DATA VERIFICATION

For the reasons given in Items 13.0, 14.0, and 15.0, the author was unable to verify the data. As

only reports and drill logs are available, the drill core being destroyed or impossible to locate, the

data cannot be verified. For exploration work completed before Knick acquired the property, this

situation is completely beyond its control, and simply reflects what was the norm before NI 43-101

came into effect in 2001. For the magnetic and VLF survey completed by Knick, the author has

reviewed the data and maps and confirms that it was done according to industry standards and is

sound and reliable.

17.0) ADJACENT PROPERTIES

No significant exploration results that would have a material impact on the Ogden property were

obtained on adjacent properties. However, Lake Shore Gold (LSG) reported a mineral reserve of 3.4

million tonnes at 7.6 g/t Au19 on their Timmins West property, located approximately 7 km west of the

Ogden property. The Timmins West property is underlain by the Tisdale and Porcupine Groups of

rocks, and the deposit is located approximately 150 m north of the Bristol fault, which also occurs on

the Ogden property.

Please note that the qualified person has been unable to verify this information, and that the

information is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the property.

18.0) MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING

No mineral processing or metallurgical testing has been done by Knick, and none has been reported

in the past.

19.0) MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES

No mineral resources or mineral reserve estimates have been completed by Knick or reported in the

assessment work covering the Ogden property.

20.0) OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION

To the best knowledge of the author, all the relevant data and information have been provided in the

preceding items.

21.0) INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS

The Ogden property is underlain by the volcanic rocks of the Deloro Group and the metasedimentary

rocks of the Porcupine Group. The property is situated less than one kilometre south of the

Porcupine-Destor Fault, which marks the boundary between the Deloro and Tisdale groups.

Although the bulk of the gold produced from the Timmins mining camp, approximately 68 million

ounces, was mined from the Tisdale Group, several gold occurrences and mines can be found in the

Deloro Group. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Naybob and Faymar mines, both located in the Deloro

Group, produced 178,650 tonnes and 108,800 tonnes respectively at grades of 6.2 and 6.3 g/t Au.

This is an indication of the potential of the Deloro Group.

Over the years, 24 reverse circulation and diamond drill holes totalling 2,045 m were drilled on the

property and in its immediate vicinity. One hole drilled by Tex-Sol in 1965 returned values of 12 g/t

Au over three non-contiguous sections of 1.52 m in silicified fragmental rock in what can be

interpreted as an altered ultramafic. Several other drill holes by Tex-Sol and other exploration

companies failed to reproduce these gold intersections. There is not enough data to establish the

true length of the mineralized gold samples. Given the information currently available, it is

impossible to determine whether the failure to reproduce the Tex-Sol results is due to a laboratory

error, a nugget effect or the erratic nature of the mineralization.

Since its acquisition by Knick, line cutting, with corresponding magnetic and VLF surveys and 25.4

km of induced polarization (I.P) have been completed in the central part of the property. Two strong

magnetic anomalies were located along with major faulting. One of them, the most westerly, is

probably the Mattagami River Fault, which marks the limit between the sediments and volcanics.

Several moderate to strong VLF anomalies oriented almost perpendicular to the main structures

probably represent subsidiary faulting.

The I.P survey revealed 4 clusters of anomalies. Once cultural effects (power line, roads etc)

removed, real anomalies remain, located at depth varying from 30 to 80 m. At these depths they can

not be explained by trenching or prospecting, but only by diamond drilling.



KNICK EXPLORATION INC., NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT, OGDEN PROPERTY

SOLUMINES 30

The geology shows a favourable environment for gold deposits, as it is located close to the

Porcupine-Destor Fault and covers both tholeiitic and calk-alkalic metavolcanic rocks in contact with

sedimentary rocks along the Mattagami River Fault. Several cherty iron formations have also been

mapped on the property in the past and can potentially have trapped gold mineralization.

The author strongly believes that a systematic exploration program is required to demonstrate the

property's gold potential. This exploration program is described in detail in Item 22,

"Recommendations".

22.0) RECOMMENDATIONS

A two-phase exploration program is recommended to explore the property. The first phase will

include line cutting followed by IP and magnetic surveys to cover the un-surveyed parts of the

property. A geological survey over the main anomalous zones and a satellite photo interpretation will

help define the best drill targets. Finally, diamond drilling is recommended to test the selected

anomalies.

If warranted, a second phase consisting exclusively of diamond drilling is recommended to test the

remaining anomalous zones and any other zones with a favourable geological setting. A detailed

budget for both phases is given on next page:
