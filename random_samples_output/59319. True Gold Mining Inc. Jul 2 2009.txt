Technical Report on the Karma Property

1 . 0 S U M M A R Y

Riverstone Resources Inc. (Riverstone) retained Wardrop Engineering Inc.
(Wardrop) in May 2008 to estimate the National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101)
compliant mineral resources for the Kao, Goulagou, and Rambo gold deposits within
the Karma project in Burkina Faso, Africa, and to prepare an independent NI 43-101
technical report.

The Karma project is located in the north-central region of Burkina Faso and
comprises the four contiguous permits of Kao, Goulagou, Rambo, and Rounga. The
permits are located directly north and east of the town of Ouahigouya, which is
connected by a well maintained 185 km paved road to the capital, Ouagadougou. All
four permits are easily accessed via numerous, well-maintained un-paved roads.

The Karma project is situated in the Paleo-Proterozoic Baolé-Mossi domain of the
West African craton. The Baolé-Mossi domain in Burkina Faso involves belts of
volcano-sedimentary rocks of variable form and dimension arranged in association
with belts and batholiths of plutonic rocks. The Karma project is underlain by
Birimian supracrustal units including paragneiss, volcano-sedimentary schist, meta-
basalt, and meta-andesite, with bodies of gabbro and diorite.

The Kao deposit occurs within a plutonic body; the Goulagou deposits occur
peripheral to known or suspected plutonic masses, and the Rambo deposit
embraces a plutonic contact zone. A preliminary evaluation by Hein (2007)
advanced a "thermal aureole style" mineralization model, in which the gold
mineralization may relate to aureole conditions during pluton emplacement and/or
later contraction.

The first work recorded on the Kao permit was a regional soil geochemical survey
conducted by the PNUD-BUMIGEB in the 1980s. In 1995, Kinbauri Gold Corp.
(Kinbauri) completed a regional soil geochemical survey and trenches over an
orpaillage zone to the northwest of the Kao deposit. In 1999, Ashanti Exploration
Ltd. (Ashanti) conducted soil geochemical surveys over the eastern part of the
present survey, and trenched an orpaillage site north of the Kao deposit. Riverstone
has completed mapping, sampling, and prospecting over the entire permit as well as
two soil geochemistry grids at 200 m x 50 m over Kao deposit and in the northeast
corner of the permit, four trenches (195 m), and a 2 km x 2 km grid of an IP
geophysical survey over Kao Main. A large northeast trending gold-in-soil
geochemical anomaly measuring approximately 6 km x 2 km was identified. Rotary
Air Blast (RAB) drilling at the southern end of this anomaly led to the discovery of
Kao Main. The rest of the soil anomaly has been tested by limited RAB and RC drill
programs, but remains largely untested. In total, Riverstone has completed 3
programs of RAB drilling totalling 279 drill holes and 21,298 m, and 6 programs of



Riverstone Resources Inc. 2 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

RC drilling totalling 172 holes and 17,740 m. Drilling was mostly concentrated in the
immediate vicinity of the Kao deposit and covered an area 800 m x 400 m. Shallow
100 m RC holes, together with a few deeper holes, were drilled on a grid at 60°. The
gold mineralized zone remains open in all directions, and limited additional drilling
has traced this zone along a 1,100 m strike length within a larger gold-in-soils
geochemical anomaly, which can be traced along strike for over 4 km.

Between 1994 and 1997, Channel Resources Ltd. (Channel) prospected, mapped,
conducted geophysics, sampled soil, RC drilled a number of orpaillage zones, and
conducted follow up RAB drilling on the area covered by the current Goulagou permit
(formerly part of the historic SOMIFA permit). In late 1997, Channel optioned the
SOMIFA property to Placer Dome Inc. (Placer Dome). Between late 1997 and 1999,
Channel and Placer Dome drilled 10 RC holes (651 m) and 1 core hole (232 m) at
Goulagou I as well as 57 RC (3,353 m) and 4 core holes (769.8 m) at Goulagou II.
Channel also performed some basic metallurgical test work on the two deposits
including bottle roll tests.

In 2000, Channel published an inferred resource for the two zones at Goulagou of
19.5 million tonnes (Mt) at 1.12 g/t gold at a cut-off of 0.5 g/t gold, for a total of
698,580 oz gold. This resource was prepared under the Canadian Mining Standards
Task Force guidelines, which predate NI 43-101.

In late 2000 or early 2001, Channel returned the SOMIFA property to its owner, who
subsequently allowed the permit to lapse. A new, much smaller Goulagou permit
was granted to Mr. Julien Birigui Ouédraogo on November 19, 2002, and St. Jude
Resources Ltd. (St. Jude) optioned the property at about the same time. Over the
next 3 years, St Jude completed soil geochemistry, topographic surveys, and drilled
51 core drill holes (4,523.2 m) on Goulagou I and a further 165 core drill holes
(17,181.1 m) on Goulagou II.

St. Jude was acquired by Golden Star Resources Ltd. (Golden Star) in late 2005,
who conducted exploration outside of the Goulagou I and Goulagou II deposits,
mainly in 2007. In January of 2006, SRK Consulting estimated that the two zones at
Goulagou had an indicated resource of 5.1 Mt averaging 1.7 g/t Au containing
280,000 oz and a further inferred resource of 5.7 Mt average 1.49 g/t Au containing
270,000 oz.

Riverstone was active on the permit in 2008, completing a mapping and sampling
program on other prospects removed from Goulagou I and Goulagou II. Riverstone
drilled five RC drill holes (685 m) at Goulagou I and 29 RC drill holes (3,733 m) at
Goulagou II.

The GG1 mineralized zone has been traced by drilling for 1,400 m along strike to a
maximum depth of 130 m. The GG2 mineralized zone has been traced 1,800 m
along strike to a maximum depth of 180 m.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 3 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

The Rambo pit and surrounding orpaillage shafts were dug between 1985 and 1995,
with most of the activity occurring in the early 1990s. A 121 km2 area surrounding
the Rambo pit was awarded to Goldhurst Resources Inc. (Goldhurst) on December
29, 1995. This property adjoined the SOMIFA permit to the east.

In 1996, Incanore Gold Mines Ltd. (Incanore) optioned the property, and it was
transferred to Incanore on May 28, 1997. During 1996 and 1997, Incanore explored
Rambo and the Titao permit to the north. Incanore completed regional 500 m x
500 m soil geochemical surveys over the entire permit, plus more detailed soils over
the Rambo, Idriss, and Todiam grids (to the east of the Rambo pit). Incanore also
completed geological mapping and sampling, ground geophysical surveys (Mag,
VLF-EM, and IP), 24 trenches (1,179 m), and 22 core drill holes (3,344.5 m). The
trenching and drilling concentrated on the Rambo pit area, targeting a north-south
structure. The property was dropped in the late 1990s.

Since late 2003, Riverstone has completed regional and detailed soil geochemical
surveys, and regional and detailed geological mapping and sampling over the entire
permit. This work indentified a number of gold targets outside of the Rambo pit area,
some of which have been followed up by additional mapping and sampling, but most
of Riverstone's work has been focussed on the Rambo pit area.

Riverstone excavated 19 trenches (1,565.2 m) and 8 pits surrounding the Rambo pit,
and conducted magnetic and VLF-EM ground geophysical surveys. Riverstone also
drilled 16 RC drill holes (2,088.5 m) and 9 diamond drill holes (1,634.6 m) into the
Rambo zone. The orientation of the Riverstone drilling was based on a
reinterpretation of the zone trending east-west, rather than north-south.

In 2008, Riverstone completed one additional RC drill hole (106 m) plus 72 RAB drill
holes (2,460 m), including fences east and west of the Rambo zone and over a
separate area to the southeast. Several targets were identified for follow up RC
drilling. Drilling on Rambo has defined a narrow gold zone 150 m along strike, up to
15 m true thickness, that has been traced for 180 m down dip.

The Kao sample database contains 8,573 samples collected from 166 RC drill holes
completed over the Kao deposit, covering an area 800 m x 400 m. Holes were
drilled on a 50 m grid at 60° and mostly reached depths of 100 m; however, a few
holes were drilled to depths of 160 m. In several localized areas, drill spacing along
lines was decreased to 25 m and, at the lateral extent of the drilling, spacing
increased to 100 m. Cuttings from the RC holes were collected, stored in rice bags
at 1 m intervals, and then sampled and composited over 2 m intervals for analysis.

The Goulagou sample database contains a total of 23,891 samples collected from
RC and diamond drill holes oriented north south, designed to intersect near vertical
east-west mineralization. Riverstone collected 2,227 samples from 34 RC drill holes
completed in 2008. Overall, samples were collected from holes that were drilled on
50 m spaced north-south sections across GG1 and GG2. Cuttings from the



Riverstone Resources Inc. 4 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

Riverstone RC holes were collected, stored in rice bags at 1 m intervals, and then
sampled and composited over 2 m intervals prior to shipment for analysis.

The Rambo sample database contains 4,529 samples collected from RC and
diamond drill holes. Incanore collected 1,913 samples, 1 to 2 m in length, from 22
diamond drill holes over a 1.2 km long north-south zone. Riverstone collected a total
of 2,616 samples – 1,483 samples 1.5 m in length from RC drill holes, and
1,133 samples ranging approximately 0.5 to 3 m in length from diamond drill holes.
Drill holes dipping at 45° to 60° to the north, were spaced 20 to 40 m along 50 m
spaced north-south sections across an area 350 m along strike.

Riverstone's quality control procedures have been successful in showing that assay
data from the Karma drilling are in general terms acceptable. Riverstone regularly
submitted standards, blanks, and field duplicates. Riverstone also submitted
samples to a secondary laboratory for duplicate checks. Laboratory duplicates
samples (preparation and assay duplicates) were also reviewed. The procedures
also showed how various laboratory issues were identified and, in most cases,
rectified. There has been a demonstrable improvement in laboratory procedures and
results following the ALS Chemex takeover of Abilab Burkina SARL (Abilab).

Wardrop validated 100% of the records from the drill hole assay database on a 10%
drill hole selection. Wardrop concluded that the assay database was sufficiently free
of error to be adequate for resource estimation.

McClelland Laboratories Inc. conducted a series of metallurgical tests in 2005 on
selected Goulagou samples from the Channel drilling in order to assess amenability
of the ores to heap leaching. Direct agitated (bottle roll) cyanidation tests were
conducted on each of 7 core composites and on 4 select 1 m intervals at various
feed sizes. Gold recovery percentages were generally in the high 80s to low 90s.

Mineral resources at the Kao, Goulagou, and Rambo properties were estimated by
Wardrop with the use of 3D geological modelling software, GEMS Version 6.1.3
(GEMS), provided by Gemcom Software International. Resources were estimated by
Mr. Michael Waldegger then verified and validated by Dr. Gilles Arseneau (P.Geo.),
Manager of Geology at Wardrop.

Wardrop estimated that the Kao deposit, at a cut-off of 0.3 g/t Au in the oxide and
0.5 g/t in the fresh rock, contains capped indicated resources of 14.7 Mt averaging
0.79 g/t Au. Wardrop estimated that the Kao deposit contains additional capped
inferred resources of 3.6 Mt averaging 0.54 g/t Au.

Wardrop estimated that the Goulagou deposit, at a cut-off of 0.3 g/t Au in the oxide
and 0.5 g/t in the fresh rock, contains capped indicated resources of 6.6 Mt
averaging 1.80 g/t Au. Wardrop estimated that the Goulagou deposit contains
additional capped inferred resources of 8.3 Mt averaging 0.70 g/t Au.

Wardrop estimated that the Rambo deposit, at a cut-off of 2 g/t Au, contains capped
inferred resources of 245,000 t averaging 5.82 g/t Au.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 5 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

Wardrop recommends a $1.375 million two-phase work program on the Kao and
Goulagou deposits.

Wardrop recommends submitting samples for metallurgical test work (specifically,
column tests on material collected from the Kao deposit). Wardrop also
recommends additional drilling on the existing grid as the deposit is currently
modelled to the extent of the drilling. A phased approach is recommended,
beginning with 50 holes spaced at 100 m and then, contingent on positive results
from Phase 1, infilling to a 50 m grid in some areas.

Wardrop recommends drilling additional holes on existing sections over the
Goulagou I zone to confirm the model assumptions and provide additional
intersections for resource estimation. Wardrop also recommends at least three lines
of infill drilling on the Goulagou II deposit to investigate the control on mineralization
in the thickest, central portion of the zone, currently classified as inferred resources.
Definition of the zone in this region may benefit from drilling holes angled from the
northeast to the southwest.

The Rambo Research Permit was attributed to Mme. M.L. Guirma on April 24, 2003
by arrêté number 2003-019/MCE/SG/DGMGC. On September 22, 2003 a
partnership agreement was established between Mme. Guirma and Mr. James A.
Matlock, and the two partners subsequently optioned the permit to Riverstone on
October 28, 2003, retaining a 3% NSR. The permit was renewed by arrêté number
2006-06-103/MCE/SG/DGMGC and subsequently transferred to Riverstone in 2008
by arrêté number 2008-08-201/MCE/SG/DGMGC. The permit was renewed and
reduced in size in April of 2008, although the new arrêté is not yet in hand. The
original coordinates for the Rambo permit are presented in Table 4.3.

The permits are located directly north and east of the town of Ouahigouya, which is
connected by a well-maintained 185 km paved road to the capital, Ouagadougou
(Figure 4.2). All four permits are easily accessed via numerous well-maintained
un-paved roads, including National Route 23, which traverses Goulagou and
National Route 15 that passes through Kao.

The main regional centre of Ouahigouya provides basic supplies; a number of small
villages are present within each permit. The main activity near the villages is the
cultivation of millet and the herding of goats, sheep, and cattle. Ouagadougou has
most services and supplies needed for exploration and mining, and is served by daily
international flights.

The climate is semi-arid (Soudano-Sahelian type) with two pronounced seasons – a
rainy season from July to October, and a dry season from November to June.
Seasonal rainfall averages 500 to 600 mm and temperatures range from 15°C in
November to 45°C in April. The topography is dominated by low rolling
peneleplained plateaus cut by weakly developed drainage systems. The major
topographical features are long ridges capped by hard ferruginous laterite cuirasse.
The area is vegetated by scrub woodlands and by savannah type grasslands.

The first work recorded over this permit was a 1 km x 1 km regional soil geochemical
survey conducted by the PNUD-BUMIGEB in the 1980s. In 1995, Kinbauri explored
the northern part of the current permit, completing a regional soil geochemical survey
and trenches over an orpaillage zone to the northwest of Kao Main. In 1999, Ashanti
conducted soil geochemical surveys over the eastern part of the present survey, and
trenched an orpaillage site north of Kao Main.

Riverstone has completed mapping, sampling, and prospecting over the entire permit
as well as 2 soil geochemistry grids at 200 m x 50 m in the northeast corner,
4 trenches (195 m), and a 2 km x 2 km grid of IP over Kao Main. Riverstone has
also completed 3 separate programs of RAB drilling, totalling 279 drill holes and
21,298 m plus 6 programs of RC drilling, totalling 172 holes and 17,740 m.

The present Goulagou Exploration Permit covers a small portion of the historic
2,300 km2 SOMIFA permit optioned by Channel from Mr. Julien Birigui Ouédraogo in
1994. Between 1994 and 1995, Channel prospected, mapped, sampled, and RC
drilled a number of orpaillage zones on the the area covered by the current Goulagou
permit (formerly part of the historic SOMIFA permit), excluding the Goulagou I and
Goulagou II zones, which had not yet been discovered. Channel subsequently
performed large regional programs over SOMIFA in 1996, including regional soil
geochemistry at 500 m centres, SPOT satellite imagery, and airborne geophysics
including magnetic and radiometric surveys.

The soil survey identified a weak point anomaly over what is now known as the
Goulagou II deposit, and several lines of shallow RAB drilling was undertaken by
Channel in 1997.

In late 1997, Channel optioned the SOMIFA property to Placer Dome. Between late
1997 and 1999, Channel and Placer Dome drilled 10 RC holes (651 m) and 1 core
hole (232 m) at Goulagou I as well as 57 RC (3,353 m) and 4 core holes (769.8 m) at
Goulagou II. Channel also performed some basic metallurgical test work on the two
deposits, including bottle roll tests.

In 2000, Channel published an inferred resource for the 2 zones of 19.5 Mt at
1.12 g/t gold at a cut-off of 0.5 g/t gold, for a total of 698,580 oz gold. This resource



Riverstone Resources Inc. 14 0854210100-REP-R0001-01

is of limited relevance in that it indicates the general size and grade of the deposits; it
is of unknown reliability as little information could be located on the methodology
used to prepare the estimate. The Channel estimate is being replaced by the
estimate presented in Section 17.0 of this report.

In late 2000 or early 2001, Channel returned the SOMIFA property to its owner, who
subsequently allowed the permit to lapse. A new, much smaller Goulagou permit
was granted to Mr. Julien Birigui Ouédraogo on November 19, 2002 and St. Jude
optioned the property at about the same time. Over the next 3 years, St. Jude
completed soil geochemistry, topographic surveys, and drilled 51 core drill holes
(4,523.2 m) on Goulagou I, and a further 165 core drill holes (17,181.1 m) on
Goulagou II.

St. Jude was acquired by Golden Star in late 2005, who conducted exploration
outside of the Goulagou I and Goulagou II deposits, mainly in 2007. In January of
2006, SRK Consulting prepared a mineral resource estimate for the two zones at
Goulagou. The estimate was published on SEDAR by St. Jude. .

Riverstone was active on the permit in 2008, completing a mapping and sampling
program on other prospects removed from Goulagou I and Goulagou II. Riverstone
also completed a clean-up and verification of the historic Golden Star Goulagou
database, and then drilled 5 RC drill holes (685 m) at Goulagou I and 29 RC drill
holes (3,733 m) at Goulagou II. The drilling was designed to both confirm earlier drill
results, as well as to move inferred resources to the indicated category.

The Rambo pit and surrounding orpaillage shafts were dug between 1985 and 1995,
with most of the activity occurring in the early 1990s. A 121 km2 area surrounding
the Rambo pit was awarded to Goldhurst on December 29, 1995. This property
adjoined the SOMIFA permit to the east.

In 1996, Incanore optioned the property and it was transferred to Incanore on May
28, 1997. During 1996 and 1997, Incanore explored Rambo and the Titao permit to
the north. Incanore completed regional 500 m x 500 m soil geochemical surveys
over the entire permit, plus more detailed soils over the Rambo, Idriss, and Todiam
grids (to the east of the Rambo pit). Incanore also completed geological mapping
and sampling, ground geophysical surveys (Mag, VLF-EM, and PI), 24 trenches
(1,179 m), and 22 core drill holes (3,344.5 m). The trenching and drilling
concentrated on the Rambo pit area, targeting a north-south structure. The property
was dropped in the late 1990s.

Since late 2003, Riverstone has completed regional and detailed soil geochemical
surveys, regional and detailed geological mapping and sampling, plus magnetic and
VLF-EM ground geophysical surveys over the Rambo pit area. Riverstone also
excavated 19 trenches (1,565.2 m) and 8 pits surrounding the Rambo pit, and drilled

16 RC drill holes (2,088.5 m) and 9 core drill holes (1,634.6 ) into the Rambo zone.
The Riverstone work was based on an early reinterpretation of the zone trending
east-west, rather than north-south. In 2008, Riverstone completed one additional RC
drill hole (106 m) plus 72 RAB drill holes (2,460 m), including fences east and west of
the Rambo zone and over a separate area to the southeast.

The Karma group permits are situated in the Paleoproterozoic Baolé-Mossi domain
of the West African craton (Bessoles, 1977; Wright, 1985), which comprises
supracrustal rocks ascribed to a dominant, earlier Birimian group and a subordinate,
later Tarkwaian group, that are deformed, intruded by distinct tonalitic and granitic
suites of plutonic rocks and metamorphosed mainly at lower greenschist facies. In
general terms, the Baolé-Mossi domain contains supracrustal rocks that were
probably developed upon a juvenile Paleoproterozoic crust (circa 2.40 to 2.20 Ga) in
an environment distal from Archean crust and that underwent a period of accretion
between 2.15 to 2.07 Ga (Abouchami et al., 1990; Boher et al., 1992) during the
Eburnian orogeny, which is responsible for polyphase regional deformation.

The Baolé-Mossi domain in Burkina Faso involves belts of volcano-sedimentary
rocks of variable form and dimension arranged in association with belts and
batholiths of plutonic rocks (Hottin and Ouédraogo, 1976; Castaing et al., 2003).
Two major sinistral shear zones oriented NNE-SSW (namely, the Houndé-
Ouahigouya shear zone to the west and the Tiébélé-Dori-Markoye shear zone to the
east) divide it into three structural zones (Castaing et al., 2003). A western zone is
comprised of large Birimian supracrustal belts oriented NNE-SSW to N-S (e.g.
Banfora and Houndé belts) containing parallel structures. A central zone, in which
the Karma group permits occur, contains large arcuate supracrustal belts (e.g.
Boromo-Goren and Dori belts) displaying first-order NW-SE trend and superposed
structures of NE-SW orientation (c.f. Feybesse et al., 1990). An eastern zone
contains supracrustal belts in the form of relatively smaller segments and lenses (e.g.
Manga and Sebba belts) surrounded by granitoid masses and cut by a network of
dextral shear zones oriented ENE-WSW. The late-tectonic intrusive centres of
elongate granitoid masses in this zone, like those of the Tenkodogo-Yamba complex,
evolved in a regional dynamic framework of dextral shear (Naba et al., 2003).

The Karma project permits in the Ouahigouya region occur in the north-central part of
the Boromo-Goren supracrustal belt and are underlain by Birimian supracrustal units
including paragneiss, volcano-sedimentary schist, meta-basalt, and meta-andesite,
with bodies of gabbro and diorite (Gamsonré, 2003). The volcano-sedimentary
schist unit is much generalized and dominated by intercalated components of
siltstone and (± graphite) argillite, sericite and sericite-chlorite schist, and subordinate
greywacke or local arkose.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 17 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

Feybesse et al. (1990) argue that the structural assemblage of the arcuate Boromo-
Goren belt in the central zone was developed by three main deformation phases. An
early deformation (D1), which affected a dominantly sedimentary assemblage, is
represented by a penetrative S1 foliation, isoclinal folds, and a metamorphism
ranging from lower greenschist to amphibolites facies. The presence of a penetrative
S1 foliation, and thus of an implied regional discordance, is corroborated by studies
in the Yako-Batié region (Ouédraogo and Prost, 1986) and the Kwademen region
(Lompo et al., 1991) in the central and western parts of the belt. Feybesse et al.
(1990) propose that two other successive tectonic phases (D2 and D3) of
transcurrent nature affected both the early assemblage and a later volcano-
sedimentary assemblage, whereby sinistral faults oriented north and northwest (D2)
and dextral and dextral reverse faults oriented ENE (D3) controlled the distribution
and geometry of F2 and F3 folds.

In contrast, in the Goren segment of the belt near Kaya, Hein et al. (2004) do not
recognize either an early S1 foliation or a discordance in the supracrustal sequences,
and consider the D2 phase of Feybesse et al. (1990) as a manifestation of east-west
compression (their D1) responsible for early macroscopic folding. Furthermore, Hein
et al. (2004) describe a regional foliation oriented NE (their S2) and associated tight
folds and sinistral reverse shear zones resulting from major NW-SE compression
(their D2), and correlate these with structures of the D3 phase of Feybesse et al.
(1990). This deformation was accompanied and followed by granitoid intrusions and,
according to Hein et al. (2004), marks a culminating Eburnean event.

Hein et al. (2004) identify two successive phases of deformation (their D3 and D4) in
the Goren segment which were not previously recognized. One deformation phase
(their D3) is responsible for the development of sinistral reverse shear zones oriented
northwest (e.g. Sanmatenga zone). This deformation and crustal slicing, caused by
east-west compression, are probably related to the development of an early foliation
("S1") in the neighbouring supracrustal belts to the north and east. This "S1" foliation
is oriented north-south in the Bouroum belt in the region of Dori to the north (Nikiéma
et al., 1993; Debat et al., 2003) and northwest-southeast in the Yalago belt to the
east (Bourges et al., 1998).

Hein et al. (2004) identify another phase of deformation (their D4) responsible for the
development of dextral reverse shear zones oriented WNW (i.e. Wabi-Tampelse
zone). This deformation is correlated with late thrusts and folds in the Bouroum belt,
which are oriented east-west and verge to the north. Elsewhere in the Aribinda
region, thermal fronts at the contacts of late-tectonic granitoid intrusions reflect a
progressive metamorphism of moderate pressure (5 to 6 kilobars) with successive
mineralogical zones, superposed on the regional greenschist facies, which are
displaced by post-metamorphic thrusts toward the north (Debat et al., 2003). This
deformation is also correlated with a crenulation cleavage oriented east-west in the
Yalago belt ("S2" of Bourges et al., 1998).

The Baolé-Mossi domain is unconformably overlain to the north near the Malian
border by early clastic sequences of the Taoudéni basin, of Neoproterozoic to



Riverstone Resources Inc. 18 0854210100-REP-R0001-01

Ordovician age (Bertrand-Sarfati et al., 1991), and by coarse sandstones of the
Terminal Continental series, of mid-Eocene to Pliocene age (Castaing et al., 2003;
Gamsonré, 2003). A network of magnetic doleritic dykes oriented NE-SW and
WNW-ESE to NW-SE cut the Paleoproterozoic rocks and the cover sequences of the
Taoudéni basin. Locally dykes of the latter orientation cut dykes of the former with
an apparent dextral sense of displacement. The age of the dykes is poorly
constrained between the Mesoproterozoic and the Mesozoic, and dyke swarms of
different ages may be involved. Nevertheless, it seems likely that at least some of
the dykes were emplaced during a period of crustal extension and fracturing
coinciding with the lower Jurassic opening of the proto-Atlantic Ocean.

7.2.1 KAO

Outcrop is generally sparse on the permit. Published maps show the Kao permit
being underlain by schistose northeast trending meta-sedimentary and meta-volcanic
rocks intruded by small granitic stocks and cut by at least two northeast trending
dolerite dykes. Both northeast and northwest structures have been identified on the
permit, and the intersection point of these two seems to be a particularly favourable
place for gold mineralization. Orpaillage sites are concentrated in a broad band
running northeast through the centre of the permit.

The Kao mineralized zone occurs under a slight topographical rise covered by
laterite. The laterite is only a few metres thick and is underlain by saprolitized meta-
sediments that are, at most, a few tens of metres thick. The gold mineralization
occurs in a flat lying tabular zone or zones within granodiorite, which subcrops in the
western part of the zone. There are no quartz veins or stringers, although the
intrusive is silicified with some hematite and carbonate present.

7.2.2 GOU LAGOU

Reference: Thivierge, 2008.

The Goulagou I area contains two deep-pit style orpaillage zones, namely the
Goulagou I East orpaillage zone and Goulagou I West orpaillage zone, and drilling-
defined gold mineralized zones. The Goulagou I West mineralized zone measures
overall at least 450 m x 175 m and the Goulagou I East mineralized zone measures
700 m x 10 to 50 m. The orpaillage zones occur along an ENE-trending elevated
zone controlling a local drainage divide and underlain by subcrop of fine-grained
clastic meta-sedimentary rocks. The latter are composed mainly of argillitic siltstone
and argillite, with local graphitic and/or chloritic argillite intercalations. Intrusive units
composed of dioritic to granodioritic rocks and of more non-descript felsic rocks, are
reported in the drilling programs.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 19 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

The rocks are folded and variably foliated, with a dominantly ENE-trending
lithostructural anisotropy, which trends continuously between the Goulagou I West
and East zones along the subcropping keel of bedrock that forms the drainage
divide. The trend may represent:

� the long limb of an asymmetric F2 fold in the Goulagou domain, or

� a regular attitude developed in a crosscutting D2 shear zone.

The Goulagou II prospect involves the Balélogo (or Goulagou II) orpaillage zone and
a drilling-defined gold mineralized zone.

The area of subcropping bedrock around the Balélogo orpaillage site is comprised
mainly of meta-sedimentary rocks (argillite, argillitic siltstone, minor fine-grained
sandstone, and chert) with local bands of dioritic plutonic rocks. The dioritic rocks
vary widely in texture from medium- to coarse-grained and granoblastic to fine-
grained and foliated. The rocks are variably foliated, and the layering and foliation
are asymmetrically folded by macroscopic F2 folds with north-south trending axial
traces. The long limbs of these folds trend WNW-ESE and reflect the prevalent local
structural trend, roughly sub-parallel with the direction of the Goulagou-Rambo
deformational corridor.

The current mapping indicates that the "Ouahigouya pluton", previously interpreted to
underlie the southern boundary of the Goulagou permit with a circumscribed outline,
more likely comprises a broad band of smaller plutonic bodies (or "whalebacks")
enveloped by a carapace of supracrustal rocks with an irregular plutonic interface.

The Balélogo orpaillage zone occurs within an area of subcropping bedrock situated
to the north of the drill-defined mineralized zone. The site is physiographically
"perched" and occurs upon a low mound of subcropping saprock exposed at the
approximate interface with an overlying recycled laterite carapace, which caps an
adjacent hill-plateau immediately to the south. This hill plateau, whose carapace
dips gently to the south, is underlain by the eastern part of the Goulagou II
mineralized zone. The Balélogo orpaillage site is characterized by shallow surface-
scraping pits with very few deep pits, and mainly involves the reworking of surface
debris, both covering and including the subcropping meta-sedimentary saprock. The
shallow surface style of orpaillage at the perched site may imply a remobilization and
reconcentration of gold (from a source presumably related to the Goulagou II
mineralized zone) in a paleo-weathered profile that is now further eroded and
dispersed, and capped by a transported laterite ferricrete. Gold may have been re-
concentrated at the interface with a paleo-saprolite and paleo-laterite, prior to an
earlier erosion of the latter and deposition of a recycled laterite carapace.

7.2.3 RAMBO

The main orpaillage zone at Rambo measures 60 m x 40 m, elongated east-west,
and is 40 m deep. It was exploited from 1985 to 1995, although sporadic activity



Riverstone Resources Inc. 20 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

continues to the present. The pit is excavated within meta-sediments and meta-
volcanics, and directly overlies the Rambo mineralized zone.

The meta-sediments are fine- to medium-grained clastic rocks, composed of
argillaceous siltstones, argillite and arkosic greywackes. The argillites tend to be
monotonous, thinly bedded sequences containing some graphitic argillite, and are
moderately to strongly foliated. The greywackes are fine- to medium-grained and
commonly silicified, and contain quartz stringers. Chloritic schist, probably derived
from intermediate to felsic volcanic rocks, forms a 60 m wide northeast-trending band
within the Rambo mineralized zone.

A large granodiorite pluton lies immediately north of the Rambo pit and it dips to the
south below the pit. The intrusion is not exposed on surface but is evident in the drill
holes. It appears to be both sheared and brecciated at its margin, and also displaced
by late faults that break the pluton up into blocks that step to the south.

The deposits share a common association with granodioritic plutonic masses:

� the Kao deposit occurs within a plutonic body

� the Goulagou I and II deposits occur peripheral to known or suspected
plutonic masses

� the Rambo deposit embraces a plutonic contact zone.

Smaller plutonic masses and dykes (diorite, quartz diorite, and/or granodiorite) are
present in the metasedimentary rocks and within the margins of the plutonic masses,
and may represent structurally-controlled dyke networks associated with the
carapace of the plutonic bodies.

The development of progressive and retrogressive metamorphic minerals (e.g. albite,
ankerite, calcite, sericite, chlorite, epidote, actinolite, hornblende, and adularia in
metasedimentary rocks; biotite, cordierite, chloritoid, andalusite or kyanite in pelitic
metasedimentary units) may be in part related to orogenic plutonism.

Gold mineralization is associated with the presence of disseminated sulphide mineral
phases (mainly pyrite and/or arsenopyrite), quartz veins, and hematitic alteration. A
preliminary evaluation (Hein, 2007) advanced a "thermal aureole style" mineralization
model, in which the gold mineralization may relate to aureole conditions during pluton
emplacement and/or later contraction.

The Kao mineralized zone has been traced 800 m northwest-southeast and is up to
400 m wide. It forms a thick (up to 60 m), shallowly dipping tabular zone containing
disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite. The zone is open to the north and at depth to
the east. There is evidence in the drilling of additional tabular zones both above and
below the main zone.

9 . 2 G O U L A G O U

The Goulagou I mineralized zone intersected in drilling is related to pyrite-gold quartz
veins and disseminated pyrite developed in the meta-sedimentary host rocks within
band- or lens-like zones that are quasi-concordant with the ENE-trending layered
anisotropy. Consequently, the mineralization pattern may reflect in part a stratiform,
lithological control (Thivierge, 2008). The GG1 mineralized zone has been traced
1,400 m along strike to a maximum depth of 140 m. Most of the investigative work
has occurred in the upper 60 m of the mineralized zone in the saprolite. Limited
sampling has been carried out in fresh rock, but only very locally.

The Goulagou II mineralized zone is defined through drilling programs, and
comprises an elongate zone trending WNW-ESE and measuring at least 2,100 m x
10 to 180 m, situated to the south of the Balélogo (Goulagou II) orpaillage zone. As
in the Goulagou I deposit, the gold mineralization is developed within lens-like zones
quasi-concordant to the lithostructural anisotropy in the meta-sedimentary host rocks,
and is manifested by pyrite-gold quartz veins and disseminated pyrite (Thivierge,
2008).

9 . 3 R A M B O

The mineralized zone has been traced east-west for approximately 350 m, 180 m
down dip, and it crosscuts the northeast trending meta-volcanics and meta-
sediments at a high angle. It occurs within a steeply south dipping shear zone along
the brecciated southern contact of a granodiorite pluton, and the zone plunges
steeply to the southwest. The shear zone is marked by strong sericitization,
disseminated pyrite and lesser arsenopyrite, and little real quartz veining (Thivierge
et al., 2004).

permit. This work indentified a number of gold targets outside of the Rambo pit area,
some of which have been followed up by additional mapping and sampling, but most
of Riverstone's work has been focussed on the Rambo pit area. Riverstone
excavated 19 trenches (1,565.2 m) and eight pits surrounding the Rambo pit, and
conducted magnetic and VLF-EM ground geophysical surveys. Riverstone also
drilled 16 RC drill holes (2,088.5 m) and 9 diamond drill holes (1,634.6 m) into the
Rambo zone. The orientation of the Riverstone drilling was based on a
reinterpretation of the zone trending east-west, rather than north-south.

In 2008, Riverstone completed 1 additional RC drill hole (106 m) plus 72 RAB drill
holes (2,460 m) including fences east and west of the Rambo zone and over a
separate area to the southeast. Several targets were identified for follow up RC
drilling.

Riverstone completed a total of 17,831 m of RC drilling in 2007 and 2008. Drilling
was mostly concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the Kao deposit and covered an
area approximately 800 m x 400 m. Shallow 100 m RC holes, together with a few
deeper holes, were drilled on a grid at 60°. The gold mineralized zone remains open
in all directions and limited additional drilling has traced this zone along a 1,100 m
strike length within a larger gold-in-soils geochemical anomaly, which can be traced
along strike for over 4 km. Table 11.1 summarizes relevant sample results from the
Riverstone drilling.

Incanore completed a total of 3,345 m of drilling from 22 diamond drill holes in late
1997. The drilling investigated a possible north-south continuation of the Rambo
mineralized structure and therefore missed the east west striking zone, with the
exception of 3 of 22 holes.

Riverstone completed a total of 2,268 m of drilling from 17 RC drill holes in 2004 and
2008, and 2,003 m from 11 diamond drill holes in 2004 and 2005. Drilling was
oriented perpendicular to the east-west striking deposit.

Drilling on Rambo has defined a narrow gold zone 350 m along strike, up to 15 m
true thickness, which has been traced for 180 m down dip.

The Kao sample database contains 8,573 samples collected from 166 RC drill holes
completed in 2007 and 2008 covering an area 800 m x 400 m. Holes were drilled on
a 50 m grid at 60° and mostly reached depths of 100 m; however, a few holes were
drilled to depths of 160 m. In several localized areas, drill spacing along lines was
decreased to 25 m and, at the lateral extent of the drilling, spacing increased to
100 m. Cuttings from the RC holes were collected and stored in rice bags at 1 m
intervals and then sampled and composited over 2 m intervals for analysis.

The Goulagou sample database contains 23,891 samples collected from RC and
diamond drill holes oriented north south, designed to intersect near vertical east-west
mineralization.

Channel collected 1,707 samples from 67 RC drill holes. Holes were drilled at -50°

Samples were collected from drill core at 1 m intervals.

Riverstone collected 2,227 samples from 34 RC drill holes completed in 2008. Holes
were drilled on 50 m spaced north-south sections across GG1 and GG2. Cuttings
from the RC holes were collected and stored in rice bags at 1 m intervals and then
sampled and composited over 2 m intervals prior to shipment for analysis.

All RC samples were assayed using standard fire assay with atomic absorption
techniques, with samples grading in excess of 2.00 g/t gold re-assayed with a
gravimetric finish, at the independent Abilab laboratories in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso, which is part of the ALS Chemex group. All work was supervised by Paul G.
Anderson (P.Geo.), the designated Qualified Person (as defined by NI 43-101) for
the project. The results were verified by G. Peatfield (P.Eng.) an independent
consultant.

Details on sample preparation and analytical procedures are in Appendix A.

Peatfield summarized the quality control program and results for Riverstone's drilling
programs on the Kao, Goulagou, and Rambo properties. Peatfield's reports are
summarized in this section and have been included as Appendix B.

13.1.1 KAO

Peatfield summarized the quality control program and results for the 2007 and 2008
RC drilling campaigns at Riverstone's Kao deposit in Burkina Faso. This includes all
RC drilling to date.

In the course of this review, Peatfield considered four separate sets of data:

� Phases 1 and 2 drilling (early 2007 – Holes Kao-07-RC-001 to Kao-07-042,
inclusive) where assaying was by Abilab, before the merger with ALS
Chemex.

� Phase 3 drilling (late 2007 – Holes Kao-07-043 to Kao-07-099, inclusive)
where assaying was also by Abilab but Peatfield suspected that there was
considerable ALS Chemex influence.

� Phase 4 drilling (early 2008 – Holes Kao-08-RC-100 to Kao-08-150,
inclusive) where assaying was officially under the aegis of ALS Chemex.

� Phases 5 and 6 drilling (late 2008 – Holes Kao-08-151 to Kao-08-173,
inclusive) where assaying was conducted by ALS Chemex.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 37 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

Data presented in a review by Peatfield suggests that Riverstone's quality control
procedures have been successful in showing that assay data from the Kao drilling
are in general terms acceptable. The procedures also showed how various
laboratory issues were identified and, in most cases, rectified. There has been a
demonstrable improvement in laboratory procedures and results following the
ALS Chemex takeover of Abilab.

STANDARD S

Standards were, in general, inserted in rotation after every 20th regular sample. In
the early work, the choice of standards was less than optimal, in the sense that there
was no control at lower levels, but this was corrected at a later stage. Peatfield
observed that, although there were laboratory quality assurance/quality control
issues with standards in the early stage of the program, most of the errors were to
the low side, thus implying a possible conservative bias. In cases of highly aberrant
assays, the laboratory was queried and, in some cases, re-assays were initiated.
Most of the out-of-range standards assays were within strings of low to very low
routine assays, and therefore were not regarded as being of great concern.

The performance of the standards program in Phase 3 onward was much superior to
that in the earlier phases. Very few of the assays lie outside the accepted ranges,
and those only by very small amounts. The results of standards assaying were
considered to be acceptable.

FIEL D, PR EPARAT ION, A ND ASSAY DU PLICATES

During early phases of the drilling program, the rig duplicates were initially collected
after every 20 samples and 2 to 4 control samples; later in the program, the
frequency decreased so that there were 60 regular and several controls between rig
duplicates. Preparation duplicates and assay duplicates were chosen by Abilab and
were at very irregular intervals.

In general, the duplicate assays show an increase in precision from field to
preparation to assay duplicate pairs, as expected. There were no areas of concern
observed.

BLANK S

In all sample shipments for the Kao RC drilling, coarse blank samples were included
in a regular rotation. The material used was collected from a road quarry and
assumed to have a negligible gold content. Blank samples were inserted after every
20 or 40 regular samples and some other controls.

The performance of the blanks samples was not particularly good. Although most
assays are below 30 ppb Au, which is marginally acceptable, there are a few above
this level. Performance improved in Phase 5, but was still not perfect. The



Riverstone Resources Inc. 38 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

improvement may have something to do with the entry of ALS Chemex into the
picture. In light of the fact that the laboratory quotes its blank assays consistently as
<5 or 5 ppb Au, one is forced to conclude that the company blank material is less
than perfect.

FIR E ASSA Y/AT OMIC AB SORPT I ON VS. FIR E ASSAY/GRA VIM ETRIC ASSAY

In many cases where the original fire assay/atomic absorption (FA/AA) assays
exceeded 2,000 ppb, the samples were re-assayed using a fire assay/gravimetric
(FA/Grav) technique. The object was to provide a check on assays above this value
and to see if there was a bias between techniques. In preparing the database for
resource purposes, the FA/Grav values were used. Peatfield did not observe any
bias to be of concern.

SEC OND LAB ASSAY CH ECK S

In the course of early RC drilling on the Kao project, two small sets of pulps were
forwarded to second laboratories for check FA/AA assays.

A group of 100 pulp samples from the early drilling at Kao (from holes Kao-07-RC-
005 to Kao-07-RC-020) were selected and forwarded to ALS Chemex in North
Vancouver. They were assayed using the FA/AA technique, as had been applied by
Abilab in Burkina Faso. A total of 17 of these pulps were also re-assayed in Burkina
Faso. Furthermore, a sub-set of four samples were assayed in both North
Vancouver and Burkina Faso using a FA/Grav technique. In all cases, bias was
observed to be low and correlations very strong.

A group of 30 sample pulps was forwarded to the Abilab facility in Bamako, Mali, for
comparative FA/AA assays. All in all, these results show that, for the early phases of
RC drilling at Kao, there was good agreement between results of re-assaying of
sample pulps at second laboratories.

13.1.2 GOU LAGOU

Peatfield summarized the quality control program and results for the RC drilling
campaign conducted by Riverstone at the Goulagou deposits in Burkina Faso.
Peatfield considered two separate sets of data from RC drilling in 2008:

� the first phase of assaying by Abilab

� the second phase of assaying under the aegis of ALS Chemex.

Data presented in this review suggested that the various quality control procedures
have been successful in showing that assay data from the Goulagou RC drilling in
2008 are, in general terms, acceptable.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 39 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

STANDARD S

In 2008, Riverstone used three different CDN Resource Laboratories (CDN)
standards. These standards were inserted at a rate of 1 per each set of 20 regular
samples and 1 other control sample. The performance of assays for Riverstone
inserted standards for the 2008 RC drilling at Goulagou was, in general, acceptable.
A very small number of results lay outside acceptable limits but not far enough
outside to be of serious concern. Peatfield observed that the assays for the higher
grade standard (CDN-GS-3B) tended to be on the low side with some outside the
lower limit in Phase 1, before the completion of the ALS Chemex transition. Assays
for this standard were, on average, higher although still within range following the
transition.

FIEL D, PR EPARAT ION, A ND ASSAY DU PLICATES

Riverstone inserted field duplicate samples at regular intervals in the sample stream
and preparation duplicates (two pulps from a single sample) were also inserted in a
regular rotation by the laboratory. Assay duplicates (two assays on an individual
pulp) were done routinely by the laboratory in both drilling phases. Peatfield
observed little apparent bias and good correlation between originals and duplicates.

BLANK S

In all shipments for the Goulagou RC drilling, coarse blank samples were included in
a regular rotation. The material used was collected from a road quarry and assumed
to have a negligible gold content. These plots show less than perfect results for
blank assays, leading to one questioning the material used. Peatfield also observed
that the performance improved markedly following the ALS Chemex transition.

FIR E ASSA Y/AT OMIC AB SORPT I ON VS. FIR E ASSAY/GRA VIM ETRIC ASSAY

In cases where the original FA/AA assays were in excess of 2.0 ppm, the samples
were re-assayed using a FA/Grav technique. The object was to provide a check on
higher assays, and to see if there was a bias between techniques. In preparing the
database for resource purposes, FA/Grav values were used if available. In the case
of the Phase 1 drilling, there is a slight bias toward lower results for the gravimetric
assays, and a good correlation.

13.1.3 RAMBO

Peatfield summarized the quality control work for the core and RC drilling campaigns
at the Rambo deposit, including work in 2004, 2005, and 2008. This includes all of
Riverstone's drilling to date, to be used in a resource estimate for the deposit.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 40 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

In the course of this review, Peatfield considered three separate sets of data. These
were made up of assay information for:

� RC and core drilling in 2004

� core drilling in 2005

� RC drilling in 2008.

In the case of the first two sets, assaying was by Abilab before the merger with ALS
Chemex. The third set assaying was under the aegis of ALS Chemex.

Peatfield considered several types of quality control data. Peatfield did not include
plots for blank assays but reported that, in 2004 and 2005, there were only Abilab
blanks and all reported assays were "less than detection". In 2008, Riverstone and
Abilab inserted blanks were all <10 ppb.

Data presented in this review suggest that the various quality control procedures
have been successful in showing that assay data from the Rambo drilling in 2004,
2005, and 2008 are, in general terms, acceptable.

STANDARD S

There are several sub-sets to consider here:

� Riverstone and Abilab inserted standards for RC and diamond core drilling
in 2004

� Abilab inserted standards for diamond core drilling in 2005

� Riverstone inserted standards for RC drilling in 2008.

Certified standards were obtained from Rocklabs Ltd. (Rocklabs) and CDN, and
inserted in reasonably regular rotations.

In 2004, Abilab and Riverstone employed three different Rocklabs standards. These
standards were inserted at a rate of 1 per each set of 20 assays. Peatfield observed
that the performance of assays for Abilab inserted standards for this drilling phase
was, in general, acceptable.

In 2005, Abilab employed four different Rocklabs standards. Peatfield observed
acceptable performance of standards assays for the 2005 diamond drilling program.

Standards in 2008 were inserted in rotation after every 20th regular sample and one
other control sample. By this time, the choice of standards was more reasonable for
the grades expected and the standards performance was observed to be acceptable.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 41 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

ASSA Y DUPL ICAT ES

Abilab performed duplicate assays of pulps on an irregular basis for the 2004 and
2005 drilling. There are no field or preparation duplicate assays available for this
work, and too few duplicates of any kind available for the 2008 program to warrant
comment. For the most part, the results show that there is little bias between results
for original and duplicate assays, and what there is can probably be ascribed to
relatively few higher assays.

A sub-set of the above data involves the duplicate pulp assays performed on the
minus 150 mesh fraction in metallic screen analyses. In this analytical technique, the
minus fraction (that part of the pulp that passes a 150 mesh screen) is routinely
assayed in duplicate by the standard FA/AA technique, and the average of the two
values used in the computation of the final assay. In some cases, the samples
subjected to metallic screen assaying were also assayed by the standard FA/AA
technique. In a smaller sub-set of these samples, there were also second assays, as
separate reports rather than simply duplicate assays. Peatfield observed that there
was not a strong bias either way in these data; however, the correlation coefficients
were not very strong.

In preparing the database for resource estimation, the metallic screen values were
used in preference to the FA/AA assay results.

FIR E ASSA Y/AT OMIC AB SORPT I ON VS. FIR E ASSAY/GRA VIM ETRIC ASSAY

In a few cases where the original FA/AA assays were relatively high, the samples
were re-assayed using a FA/Grav technique. The object was to provide a check on
higher assays and to see if there was a bias between techniques. There are a very
limited number of assays available; therefore, it was not possible to draw definitive
conclusions regarding the correlation between these datasets. In preparing the
database for resource purposes, FA/Grav values were used if available.

SEC OND LAB ASSAY CH ECK S

A small set of pulps from the 2005 diamond drilling program was re-assayed by
ALS Chemex in North Vancouver. Peatfield observed a very small, probably
insignificant, bias in favour of the North Vancouver results and a reasonable
correlation. The suggestion from this admittedly small sample set is that the Abilab
assays are acceptable.

During a site visit conducted between June 25 and 27, 2008, Dr. Gilles Arseneau
(P.Geo) collected five composite samples of RC rejects at the Kao deposit – four at
the Goulagou deposit and one grab sample from inside of the excavated pit at the
Rambo deposit. Results from the independent samples are compared in Table 14.1
to the average grade of sample values across the interval from the assay database.

The samples collected by Wardrop from the Koa and Goulagou deposits returned
values that are within the acceptable range when compared to the original assays
collected by Riverstone.

McClelland Laboratories Inc. conducted a series of metallurgical tests in 2005 on
selected Goulagou samples from the Channel drilling in order to assess amenability
of the ores to heap leaching. Direct agitated (bottle roll) cyanidation tests were
conducted on each of 7 core composites and on 4 select 1 m intervals at various
feed sizes. Gold recovery percentages were generally in the high 80s to low 90s.

Goulagou ores are saprolitic; therefore, detailed agglomerate strength and stability
tests were conducted to optimize agglomerating conditions for each core composite.
Results showed that cement binder requirements varied between 5 to 10 kg/t of ore.

Column leach tests of the core composites averaged 91.1% gold recovery in 77 to
149 days of leaching and rinsing. Goulagou ore represented by these core
composites are readily amenable to heap leach cyanidation treatment with
agglomeration pre-treatment. Typically, column leach tests are factored by 3 to 5%
for use in feasibility studies. This would suggest an average recovery in the range of
85 to 87% for the Goulagou ore.

The material tested consisted of composites typically made up from samples from
two or more holes and from varying down hole intervals. Hence it is unclear from the
test work report that different recoveries could be assumed or determined for oxide,
transition, and fresh material. Typically these different material types will exhibit at
least some difference in communition requirements and leaching characteristics.

17.1.1 EXPLORAT OR Y DATA AN AL YSIS

Wardrop received digital spreadsheet files with drill hole collar locations, borehole

Riverstone. Each dataset was formatted and imported into a GEMS database.

ASSA YS

A total of 8,918 assay results from 173 holes were received by Wardrop from
Riverstone. For the purpose of geological modelling and resource estimation,
Wardrop used 8,573 assays results from 166 holes in the direct vicinity of the Kao
mineralized zones. All assay results considered for resource estimation were
derived from samples collected on a very regularly drilled grid of 166 RC drill holes.
Almost all of the samples collected were 2 m in length. Descriptive statistics of the

CAPPING

Grade capping was considered and evaluated by examining the cumulative
frequency distribution, histogram, and decile analysis for gold composites. Wardrop
capped 21 composites to 4 g/t.

BULK DENSITY

No test work has been completed to determine specific gravity of the material at the
Kao deposit. A literature review of surrounding deposits supports the use of a
specific gravity of 2.0 for oxidized rock types and 2.75 for fresh rock.

17.1.2 GEOLOGIC AL INT ER PRET ATION

A surface representing the topography was modelled using the Laplace method with
drill hole collar data. A surface representing the upper limits of fresh rock was
modelled using the Laplace method with drill hole data.

Mineralization at the Kao property is mostly concentrated in a shallowly dipping
tabular zone of approximately 50 m thickness that continues from the saprolite rock
at surface into fresh rock to a depth of about 100 m below surface. A sub-
horizontally mineralized zone of approximately 10 m thickness was identified near
surface.

Two mineralized envelopes were interpreted by Wardrop on the basis of a grade cut-
off of 0.3 g/t. Polylines were generated on parallel inclined sections every 50 m. The
inclined sections were oriented north-south, dip 60° to the west, and are coincident
with drill hole traces. The polylines honoured the drill hole assay boundaries in 3D.
Wireframes were generated from the lines.

17.1.3 COMPOSIT ES

Assays were composited to a fixed length of 2 m within and outside of the wireframes
representing the mineralized zones above cut-off. Composites were generated
starting from the collar of the drill hole downwards and incorporated all assay data.
Composite lengths were interrupted at wireframe contacts. A total of 8,579
composites were generated. Composited grades were used for the grade
interpolation in the block model. Descriptive statistics on composited data within the
wireframe representing the mineralized zone are presented in Table 17.2.

17.1.4 SPAT IAL AN AL YSIS

Geostatisticians use a variety of tools to describe the pattern of spatial continuity or
strength of the spatial similarity of a variable with separation distance and direction.
The correlogram measures the correlation between data values as a function of their
separation distance and direction. The distance at which the correlogram reaches
the maximum variance is called the "range of correlation" or simply the range. The
range of the correlogram corresponds roughly to the more qualitative notion of the
"range of influence" of a sample; it is the distance over which sample values show
some persistence or covariance.

Using Sage 2001 software, variography was completed for gold within each
mineralized zone at the Kao deposit. Directional sample correlograms were
calculated along horizontal azimuths of 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, 240, 270,
300, and 330 degrees. For each azimuth, sample correlograms were also calculated
at dips of 30° and 60° in addition to horizontally. Lastly, a correlogram was
calculated in the vertical direction. Using the 37 correlograms, an algorithm
determined the best-fit model. This model is described by the nugget (C0), two
nested structure variance contributions (C1, C2), ranges for the variance contributions
and the model type (spherical or exponential). After fitting the variance parameters,
the algorithm then fits an ellipsoid to the 37 ranges from the directional models for
each structure. The final models of anisotropy are given by the lengths and
orientations of the axes of the ellipsoids (Table 17.3).

Note: Rotation angles were set to correspond to Gemcom Software's rotational convention, which
follows the right hand rule with rotation about Z-axis being positive when X moves towards the Y-
axis; rotation about the Y-axis is positive when Z moves towards the X-axis.

ROCK TYPE MODEL

The rock type model was coded from the modelled wireframes representing the main
and upper mineralized zones. The selection of blocks for coding from the wireframes
was based on the block being at least 0.001% by volume within a wireframe using a
needling accuracy of nine needles per block oriented vertically. The surrounding
blocks at least 50% above the fresh rock surface were also coded for interpolation.

DEN SIT Y MOD EL

Blocks 50% above the fresh rock surface were coded with density value of 2.0 and
block below the surface were coded with the density value of 2.75.

17.1.6 GRAD E INTER POLATION

Gold grades were interpolated into blocks using ordinary kriging.

Gold grades were interpolated into blocks found within the main zone using only
composites from within the main zone wireframe and into the upper zone using only
composites from within the upper zone wireframe. Blocks outside these two zones
and above the fresh rock surface were interpolated with only those composites that
were situated outside the main and upper zones and above the fresh rock boundary.

Interpolation was carried out in two passes using a different search ellipse for each
pass as outlined in Table 17.5. For the first pass, grades were interpolated only if a
minimum of 9 samples from at least 3 holes were found within the search ellipse, and
no more than 3 samples per hole or 18 samples in total were used to interpolate
grade within a block. For the second pass, grades were interpolated if at least 9
samples were found within a larger search ellipse, and no more than 3 samples per
hole or 18 samples in total were used to interpolate grade within a block. The
second pass only interpolated grades into blocks that had not been interpolated
during the first interpolation pass.

axis; rotation about the Y-axis is positive when Z moves towards the X-axis.

17.1.7 MIN ER AL RESOU RCE CLASSIF ICAT ION

Mineral resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by the CIM
as stipulated in NI 43-101. The mineral resources at Kao were classified by Wardrop
as indicated and inferred.

Blocks within the main and upper zones were classified as indicated or inferred
based on the following parameters:

� blocks that were interpolated during the first pass, using samples from at
least 3 holes within 70 m were classified as indicated

� blocks interpolated in the second pass were classified as inferred.

The interpolation resulted in a small rim of inferred blocks being interpolated at the
limits of the modelled wireframes and with the majority of blocks being classified as
indicated.

Blocks outside of the modelled grade shells that were interpolated above the fresh
rock surface were classified as inferred.

17.1.8 MIN ER AL RESOU RCE TABULAT ION

Wardrop estimated that the Kao deposit, at a cut-off of 0.3 g/t Au in the oxide and
0.5 g/t in the fresh rock, contains capped indicated resources of 14.7 Mt averaging
0.79 g/t Au. Wardrop estimated that the Kao deposit contains additional capped
inferred resources of 3.6 Mt averaging 0.54 g/t Au, as outlined in Table 17.6.

examined relative to drill hole composite values by inspecting sections and plans.
The checks showed good agreement between drill hole composite values and block
model cell values. An example of block values compared to drill hole composites is

BULK DENSITY

No test work has been completed to determine specific gravity of the material at the
Goulagou deposit. A literature review of surrounding deposits supports the use of a
specific gravity of 2.0 for oxidized rock types and 2.75 for fresh rock.

17.2.2 GEOLOGIC AL INT ER PRET ATION

A surface representing the topography was modelled using the Laplace method with
drill hole collar data. A surface representing the upper limits of fresh rock was
modelled using the Laplace method with drill hole data.

Gold mineralization at the Goulagou property is concentrated in two sub-vertical
zones. Both zones strike east-west and continue from surface into saprock and into
fresh rock below, which exists about 40 to 80 m below surface. Drilling at Zone 1

(GG1) is limited mostly to the oxidized material; however, locally the body has been
intersected to a maximum depth of 125 m below surface. Zone 2 (GG2) has been
intersected at a maximum depth of about 180 m below surface.

Mineralized envelopes were interpreted by Wardrop on the basis of a grade cut-off of
0.5 g/t for zone 1 and zone 2. Polylines were generated on parallel north-south
sections every 50 m and are coincident with drill hole traces. The polylines honoured
the drill hole assay boundaries in 3D. Wireframes were generated from the lines and
then clipped against the topography surface and fresh rock surface.

17.2.3 COMPOSIT ES

Assays were composited to a fixed length of 2 m within the wireframes representing
the mineralized zones. Composites were generated starting from the collar of the
drill hole downwards and incorporated all assay data. Composite lengths were
interrupted at wireframe contacts. A total of 3,214 composites were generated.
Composited grades were used for the grade interpolation in the block model.
Descriptive statistics on composited data within the wireframe representing the
mineralized zone are presented in Table 17.9.

ROCK TYPE MODEL

The rock type model was coded from the modelled wireframes representing the GG1
and GG2 zones and also by oxidation state. The selection of blocks for coding from
the wireframes was based on the block being at least 0.001% by volume within a
wireframe using a needling accuracy of 9 needles per block oriented vertically.
Blocks at least 50% above the fresh rock surface were coded as oxide and below
were coded as fresh rock.

DEN SIT Y MOD EL

Blocks 50% above the fresh rock surface were coded with density value of 2.0 and
block below the surface were coded with the density value of 2.75.

17.2.6 GRAD E INTER POLATION

Gold grades were interpolated into blocks using the distance weighted estimation
method known as inverse squared distance (ISD). In ISD, the estimate for the
average grade of a block is a weighted average of sample grades selected within a
search ellipse, with the weight of any given sample inversely proportional to the
square of the anisotropic distance between that sample and the centre of the block.
The anisotropic distance calculation is based on the shape of the search ellipse,
where a sample found at the edge of the long range of the ellipse is given the same
distance weighting as a sample found at the short range of the ellipse, even though
its actual distance from the block centre is greater. Using anisotropic distance
weighting implies maximum continuity in the direction of the longest axis of the
search ellipse.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 57 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

Gold grades at Goulagou were interpolated into blocks found within GG1 using only
composites found within the GG1 wireframes and into GG2 blocks using only
composites found within the GG2 wireframes.

Interpolation was carried out in two passes using a different search ellipse for each
pass as outlined in Table 17.11. For the first pass, grades were interpolated only if a
minimum of 11 samples from at least 3 holes were found within the search ellipse,
and no more than 5 samples per hole or 20 samples in total were used to interpolate
grade within a block. For the second pass, grades were interpolated if at least 11
samples were found within a larger search ellipse, and no more than 5 samples per
hole or 20 samples in total were used to interpolate grade within a block. The
second pass only interpolated grades into blocks that had not been interpolated
during the first interpolation pass.

Note: Rotation angles were set to correspond to GEMS's rotation convention of "Azimuth Dip

azimuth of the anisotropy X axis in degrees, the principle dip is the dip angle of the anisotropy X
axis in degrees (negative downward), and the intermediate azimuth is the true azimuth of the
anisotropy Y axis in degrees.

17.2.7 MIN ER AL RESOU RCE CLASSIF ICAT ION

Mineral resources were classified in accordance with definitions provided by the CIM
as stipulated in NI 43-101. The mineral resources at Goulagou were classified by
Wardrop as indicated and inferred.

All blocks within GG1 were classified as inferred. Many of the sectional
interpretations were based on one drill hole intersection, which does not provide
enough confidence on dip of the deposit nor extent at depth. Where sampling was at
a greater density, drilling did not extend far enough beyond mineralization to
establish boundaries between mineralized and non-mineralized zones or support the
notion of continuity with enough confidence to warrant a higher classification.

Blocks within GG2 that were interpolated using samples from at least 3 holes with an
average distance of less than 75 m were classified as indicated. Blocks interpolated
using samples from at least 3 holes with an average distance of greater than 75 m

were classified as inferred. The effect was a small rim of inferred blocks at the limits
of the modelled wireframes with the majority of blocks classified as indicated making
up the core. A zone between the sub-parallel sheets in GG2 was classified as
inferred. In this zone, the control on mineralization is currently poorly understood
and the estimate of grade in blocks is of a lower confidence level than the
surrounding zone.

model cell values. An example of block values compared to drill hole composites is
presented in Figure 17.2.

CAPPING

Grade capping was considered and evaluated by examining the cumulative
frequency distribution, histogram, and decile analysis for gold assays. Wardrop
capped 5 assays to 30 g/t.

BULK DENSITY

No test work has been completed to determine specific gravity of the material at the
Rambo deposit. A literature review of surrounding deposits supports the use of a
specific gravity of 2.0 for oxidized rock types and 2.7 for fresh rock.

17.3.2 GEOLOGIC AL INT ER PRET ATION

A surface representing the topography was modelled using the Laplace method with
drill hole collar data. A surface representing the upper limits of fresh rock was
modelled using the Laplace method with drill hole data.

One mineralized envelope was interpreted by Wardrop. Polylines were generated on
parallel north-south sections every 50 m and are coincident with drill hole traces.
The polylines honoured the Riverstone drill hole assay boundaries in 3D.
Wireframes were generated from the lines and then clipped against the topography
surface. Three historical Incanore drill holes were interpreted to intersect the zone;
however, the holes were oriented sub parallel to the zone and, with the lack of down
hole survey records, Wardrop did not include them in the wireframe modelling.

17.3.3 COMPOSIT ES

Assays were composited to a fixed length of 2 m within the wireframes representing
the mineralized zone. Composites were generated starting from the collar of the drill
hole downwards. Composite lengths were interrupted at wireframe contacts and
those "stubs" shorter that 1 m were incorporated into the preceding composite. A
total of 78 composites were generated from 17 holes.

Assay data from intersections that were interpreted to have intersected the zone from
three historical Incanore holes were also composited. A total of 26 of the 78
composites were generated from these three holes.

Composited grades were used for the grade interpolation in the block model.
Descriptive statistics on composited data within the wireframe representing the
mineralized zone are presented in Table 17.17.

17.3.4 RESOURC E BLOCK MOD EL

A block model was prepared with parameters presented in Table 17.18.

ROCK TYPE MODEL

The rock type model was coded from the modelled wireframe representing the
Rambo mineralized zone and also by oxidation state. The selection of blocks for
coding from the wireframes was based on the block being at least 0.001% by volume
within a wireframe using a needling accuracy of 9 needles per block oriented
horizontally across the strike of the wireframe.



Riverstone Resources Inc. 63 0854210100-REP-R0001-01
Technical Report on the Karma Property

DEN SIT Y MOD EL

Blocks 50% above the fresh rock surface were coded with density value of 2.0 and
block below the surface were coded with the density value of 2.7.

17.3.5 GRAD E INTER POLATION

Gold grades were interpolated into blocks using the distance weighted estimation
method known as ISD. In ISD, the estimate of the average grade of a block is a
weighted average of sample grades selected within a search ellipse, with the weight
of any given sample inversely proportional to the square of the distance between that
sample and the centre of the block.

Gold grades at Rambo were interpolated into blocks found within the wireframe using
only composites found within the wireframe.

Interpolation was carried out in two passes using a different search ellipse for each
pass as outlined in Table 17.19. For the first pass, grades were interpolated only if a
minimum of 3 samples from at least 2 holes were found within the search ellipse, and
no more than 2 samples per hole or 12 samples in total were used to interpolate
grade within a block. For the second pass, grades were interpolated if at least 3
samples were found within a larger search ellipse, and no more than 2 samples per
hole or 12 samples in total were used to interpolate grade within a block. The
second pass only interpolated grades into blocks that had not been interpolated
during the first interpolation pass.

Note: Rotation angles were set to correspond to the GEMS' rotation convention of "Azimuth Dip

azimuth of the anisotropy X axis in degrees, the principle dip is the dip angle of the anisotropy X
axis in degrees (negative downward), and the intermediate azimuth is the true azimuth of the
anisotropy Y axis in degrees.

17.3.8 BLOCK MOD EL VALID ATION

Wardrop completed a detailed visual validation of the Rambo block model. The
model was checked for proper coding of drill hole intervals and block model cells, in
both section and plan. Coding was found to be correct. Grade interpolation was
examined relative to drill hole composite values by inspecting sections and plans.
The checks showed good agreement between drill hole composite values and block
model cell values. An example of block values compared to drill hole composites is
presented in Figure 17.3.

Wardrop recommends further investigation on the Kao and Goulagou deposits.

Wardrop recommends submitting samples for metallurgical test work (specifically,
column tests on material collected from the Kao deposit). Wardrop also
recommends additional drilling on the existing grid as the deposit is currently
modelled to the extent of the drilling. A phased approach is recommended,
beginning with 50 holes spaced at 100 m and then, contingent on positive results
from Phase 1, infilling to a 50 m grid in some areas.

Wardrop recommends drilling additional holes on existing sections over the
Goulagou I zone to confirm the model assumptions and provide additional
intersections for resource estimation. Wardrop also recommends at least three lines
of infill drilling on the Goulagou II deposit to investigate the control on mineralization
in the thickest, central portion of the zone, currently classified as inferred resources.
Definition of the zone in this region may benefit from drilling holes angled from the
northeast to the southwest.

Quality Assurance and Control Program

Reception:

For every shipment of samples that enters the laboratory a batch number
is issued, incorporating the following information transferred from the
requisition sheet to our worksheet: date received. Company name, project
number/name, name of geologist. sample type, method of analysis.
elements to be analyzed and sample weight.

The original requisition sheet is submitted to the lab manager/chemist for
the review of analysis to be executed and a copy is -attached to the
worksheet. Every employee that performs a task on a batch of samples
e.g. sample preparation, fire assay or wet lab analysis; checks the above
information, including any notes from prior tasks and initializes his work. A
record of complete batches in order of date and time is an ongoing
process to assess priority, quality control and production data:

A batch of samples for analysis consists of no more than twenty (20)
samples to include a check on the 10th and 20th sample, a quality control
standard and a blank. Should 200 samples arrive in one shipment. this
shipment will be divided into 1O batches consisting of 20 samples per
batch. The samples are placed in order, checked with the requisition forms
to ensure all are accounted for and placed into pans to be dried in an oven
if they are humid. Sample numbers are recorded on our in-house
worksheet from the tickets that were sent with each sample. These tickets
are then stapled or put into the paper pulp bag which is attached to the
worksheet.

Prior to the sample preparation stage, the samples are individually
observed for high sulphide content, graphitic material or labels identifying
<<visible gold >>. This information is noted on the worksheet and these
specific samples are processed only at the end of the batch. Any problems
associated with the processing of samples. including analysis, are directed
and dealt with the lab manager/chemist immediately in order to discuss
the situation promptly with the client.

Employees at Abilab undergo training programs which include methods,
procedures, health and safety aspects for each task undertaken in the
laboratory. Monthly meetings are held to review and comment on quality



performance and team work. Recommendations are always welcomed
and well received by all on how to improve our efficiency and productivity
bearing in mind our quality control and assurance program is number one
priority at all times.

Sample preparation:

Abilab has a sample preparation area which is divided into two sections.
Both sections have the same equipment to produce a final pulp material
for assaying and analysis. One section is dedicated to exploration material
such as core samples (geochemical) and the other one is dedicated to
mining material (high grade) such as muck and chip samples.

Samples are crushed to approximately 1/4 inch through a jaw crusher.
The jaws are visually checked to ensure no rock or residual material is left
behind and then blown with compressed air to prevent any contamination
to the next sample. The =shed 1/4 inch material is then passed through a
smaller jaw crusher to produce material having a size of 10 mesh or
better. Once again the jaws are inspected to prevent any contamination.

This material is transferred to a splitter and mixed to provide homogeneity
within the sample. The material is split until a 250-300 gram portion is
obtained for pulverizing. Compressed air is blown through the splitter to
collect any residuals and prevent contamination into the next sample. The
sample reject is placed into marked boxes for storage or future analysis.
The 250-300 gram portion of material, representing the original sample, is
then pulverized through disk plate pulverizers or ring mill pulverizers to
obtain 90 to 95 % minus 150 mesh pulps. A small amount of compressed
air is introduced to collect any residuals and pure silica is passed after
each sample to ensure the plates and rings are clean prior to the next
sample.

The sample is then rolled 200 times (50 times at each comer) on a matting
sheet to ensure the homogeneity of gold particles throughout the pulp
material and then placed into b respective pulp bag, ready for assaying
and analysis. The pulp bags are then transferred into the weighing room.

Weighing room:

Abilab has a weighing room divided into two sections, one for geochemical
samples which includes exploration samples such as core and the other
section for regular mine samples such as muck and chip samples.



Each analytical balance is calibrated using known certified weights on a
daily basis prior to weighing any samples. Crucibles, known as fusion
pots, are checked for contamination and usage to prevent carry over of
gold from one sample to the next For geochemical samples, the crucibles
are removed when a value of 500 ppb or higher is noted. New pots are
then used to replace those discarded.

Should a pulp sample appear to be coarse, the sample is automatically
repulverized and another portion is taken from its reject, pulverized and
included as a check- Abilab's normal weight of sample used during fusion
is 30 grams (1 assay ton). The weighed pulps are recorded to the nearest
0.01 gram and then placed into their respective crucibles. As checks. a
duplicate portion is also taken on the 1Oth and 20th sample, including the
in-house quality control standard and a blank, completing a tray of 24
samples.

The tray of samples is noted an the worksheet for future reference to
determine which samples were processed in that tray, at what time they
were weighed and fused, and which pots need to be removed prior to
reusing this tray for future samples. The tray and worksheet are then
transferred into the fire assay room with a priority listing on which samples
need to be fused. RUSH samples are ALWAYS number one priority.

Fire assav:

Abilab has four (4) furnaces in its fire assay room: three furnaces for
fusion assays and the fourth one used strictly for cupellation. Normal
fusion and cupellation temperatures vary between 1,900 to 2,000 degrees
Fahrenheit (1,038 to 1,093'C). Normal fusion and cupellation times vary
from 40to 50 minutes depending on the sample material.

Each sample is individually dosed with flux according to the type of
material, depending upon the content of different rack components such
as quartz soapstone. sulphide or graphic material to name a few. An in-lab
recipe known as <<regular flux>> or <<excess flux>> are used in the
fusion process. The sample is mixed with a spatula to ensure
homogeneity of the sample within the flux recipe allowing complete fusion
of the sample. A prescribed volume of silver nitrate solution is added to
ensure a 3:1 (Ag:Au) ratio to prevent the problem of electrum in the wet
lab analysis. The dosage of silver nitrate solution is tripled for the last
sample of each batch to easier pin point the end of the batch and the
beginning of the next



Fusion loads of 24 crucibles are the normal charge placed into the
furnace. When fusion time has expired, the crucibles are inspected
individually during pouring into a mold to ensure fusion is complete and a
lead button is produced. The glass slag and crucibles are checked for
color and if lead shots are observed, the sample number is noted an the
worksheet and the sample is re-assayed.

The lead button is separated from the slag and hammered into a cube to
remove the remaining excess slag. Should the lead button be smaller than
15 grams or larger than 40 grams or a matte problem has occurred, the
fusion is repeated and this is recorded on the worksheet

Cupels are placed in the furnace for approximately 10 minutes to drive off
any moisture, The lead buttons are then placed into the preheated cupels,
allowed to melt and undergo the cupellation process in an air rich medium
to induce oxidation and absorption of the lead into the cupels. After the
cupellaton process is complete the cupels are removed and allowed to
cool prior to collecting the silver beads for wet tab analysis.

The cupels are observed for any discolouration from copper or other
elements giving an indication of what type of sample was processed. This
information is recorded on the worksheet. The silver beads containing
precious metals such as gold and PGM's are flattened and placed into
Coors cups for wet lab analysis. The worksheets are initialed by the fire
assayer along with the time fusion and cupellation was complete including
information relating to samples that may require re-assaying. The trays
holding the cups are recorded on the worksheet for ease of reference as
there may be varied analysis being executed such as atomic absorption or
gravimetric analysis.

Wet lab analysis:

Prior to processing the silver beads in the wet lab. The worksheets are
checked for the tasks that have been completed and the type of final
analysis, either gravimetric or atomic absorption. to be performed on the
samples. The beads collected in the cups are also cross-checked with the
worksheets to identify to which batch and company the samples belong.

Atomic Absorption (A.A.S.) finish: (Detection Limft of 5 ppb)

The silver/gold beads. previously collected in Coors cups are placed into
test tubes for acid digestion. The test tube trays are recorded on the



worksheet All dispensing (acid and water)equipment are calibrated on a
daily basis. An accurate volume of dilute nitric acid is added to each tube.
The tray containing the test tubes is placed into a hot water bath to help
dissolution of silver into the solution, resulting in the formation of a black
sponge should gold be present.

Any sample showing a large black sponge (gold) which we feel will result
in over calibration results are marked with a black magic marker and noted
an the worksheet. It is most probable that these samples would need a
dilution, or better, be re-assayed using the gravimetric procedure. An
accurate volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to the test
tubes to form a strong aqua regia solution that. dissolves gold into
solution. The high grade samples are checked once again to determine
complete dissolution. An accurate volume of distilled water is added to
each test tube to ensure the solution matrix of the solution is identical to
the solution matrix of the calibration standards used in atomic absorption
analysis.

The solutions are thoroughly mixed( solids << silver chloride>> allowed to
settle) and concentrations are read directly from the atomic absorption
spectrophotometer. The solution in the test tubes is then discarded in a
neutralization basin and test tubes are discarded into waste disposal.
Samples exceeding 1000 ppb in gold content are re-assayed using
gravimetric (microbalance) finish. Concentration values are reported on
the worksheet entered into the computer and printed out on a final report
format to produce the Certificate of Analysis. Approved by the chemist

Gravimetric (Microbalance) Finish: (Detection Limit 0.001 oz/ton)

The silver/gold beads are placed into porcelain parting cups containing
warm diluted nitric acid and placed on a hot plate at a low temperature
until the silver has completely dissolved. Any gold present is visible as a
black sponge in the parting cup.

The cups are removed from the hot plate and allowed to cool. The spent
acid solution containing silver nitrate is decanted and the gold sponge
carefully washed three times with distilled water. The washed cups
containing the gold sponges are placed on the hot plate to dry any
remaining water. The cups are then transferred to an annealing tray and
placed in an oven at 865C for 2 minutes to anneal the black sponge into a
gold doré bead.



The gold doré beads are allowed to cool at room temperature and
weighed on a microbalance. Prior to the weighing step, the microbalance
is calibrated. The results are recorded on the worksheet, entered into the
computer and the Certificate of Analysis produced and approved by the
chemist

The parting cups are cleaned and washed in diluted acid, rinsed with
distilled water and allowed to dry prior to reuse.

Note :

Should an electrum situation occur in the above analysis procedure, the
beads are removed and placed in a location away from any digestion and
this information is recorded on the worksheet An electrum situation refers
to a problem whereby the ratio of silver to gold is not wide enough(less
than 3:1) and the silver bead from the fire assay process does not show
any reaction in diluted nitric acid. in other words, the silver does not
dissolve into solution. A reassay using larger amounts of silver nitrate is
required.

Base metal analysis:

Base metals for example silver, copper and zinc undergo different
analytical procedures compared to those of fire assay. A different type of
worksheet is used for base metal analysis and this sheet is placed in the
pulp boxes after the amount of pulps has been weighed for gold. The box
is transferred to another weighing station within our complex.

A three digit balance is used when weighing the 1.000 gram of sample
necessary for base metal analysis. The balance is calibrated on a daily
basis. Depending upon the elements to be determined. Various CANMET
standards are used to ensure quality control over a wide range of values
from low to very high concentrations.

Various digestion (acid attack) procedures are used, depending upon the
mineralogical composition to ensure proper dissolution of base metals into
solution for atomic absorption analysis. The most widely used digestion
is dissolution of the sample pulp into an aqua regia(HN03/HCI) solution
and bringing up to an accurate volume with distilled water, respecting the
strength/matrix of the calibration standards. Concentrations are read
directly on the atomic absorption spectrophotometer, Values are recorded
on the worksheet and the computer, entered into another computer for



statistical treatment and a Certificate of Analysis produced and approved
by the chemist

Pulp metallic sieve analysis: (Total pulverization)

Based on a method developed for gold distribution problems associated
with coarse free gold or nugget effect and also when assays are difficult to
produce, we offer the alternate sample preparation and analysis
technique.

The entire sample is crushed to 10 mesh size or smaller using multiple jaw
crushing steps. The crushed material is then pulverized in a large volume
ring and puck mill or a disk pulverizer depending on customers
preference, The pulp material is transferred onto a vibratory screener
using 150 mesh screens to perform the sieve separation of the -150 mesh
and the +1 50 mesh. We utilize 150 mesh screens because particles
smaller than 100 microns are usually well homogenized with the entire
pulp, thus enabling an assay replication over 9O%. On the other end,
particles larger than 100 microns may create a nugget effect

The majority of the sample is passed through the screen, leaving an
amount of approximately 25 to 35 grams of coarse material on top of the
screen which will contain the larger free gold particles. This is called the +
150 mesh fraction which is processed entirely through fire assay as well
as two 30 gram sub-samples of the -150 mesh fraction.

Assay certificates will show the gold distribution; gold in milligrams for
each fraction, weight of pulp, weight of metallics fraction and the
calculated assay grade of the sample submitted.

Turn around time of assaying by this procedure vary depending on the
sample size, although we have performed up to 25 samples per day
through the sample preparation stage and within the next two to three
days the results were available for the customer.

Additional quality controls:

On a regular basis, we are sending samples to our facilities in Val d 'Or,
Rouyn-Noranda (Canada) or to competitors to compare the quality of our
analytical results.



Furthermore, segregation of crucibles from established cut-off grades, are
frequently washed using a special flux to eliminate a potential source of
contamination.

All the glassware is washed using an organic detergent and a special
brush after each use,

We frequently dissolve with aqua regia, gold beads produced for
gravimetric finish and read them on the atomic absorption spectrometer to
correlate both methods and verify if there are any discrepancies from one
technique to the other.

When high-grade gold is observed using gravimetric finish. We dissolve
the gold bead and read it for silver on the AAS. in order to see if there is
any silver left within the bead and subtract any amount of silver found in
the gold beads.

On a daily basis, we perform screen tests to control the quality of the
sample preparation.

We do perform many more quality control checks and if you would like to
know more of our quality program, you should give us a call.

MEMORANDUM

Date: 22 September 2008 

To: Gilles Arseneau - Wardrop 

CC: Paul Anderson, Cyriaque Ki, Mike McInnis 

From: Giles Peatfield

Re: Summary of QC data for Riverstone's Kao project RC drilling:

I have summarised the quality control ("QC") work for the RC drilling campaigns at 
Riverstone's Kao deposit in Burkina Faso, including all work in both 2007 and 2008. 
This includes all RC drilling to date, to be used in a resource estimate for the deposit. 

In the course of this review, I considered four separate sets of data.  These were made
up of assay information for: Phases 1 & 2 drilling (early 2007 – Holes Kao-07-RC-001 to 
042 inclusive); Phase 3 drilling (later 2007 – Holes 043 to 099 inclusive); Phase 4 drilling
(early 2008 – Holes Kao-08-RC-100 to 150 inclusive); and Phases 5 & 6 drilling (later 
2008 – Holes 151 to 173 inclusive).  In the case of the first two sets, assaying was by 
Abilab Burkina S.A.R.L., before the merger with ALS-Chemex.  The third set assaying 
was also by Abilab, but I suspect that there was considerable ALS-Chemex influence by 
this time.  The fourth set assaying was officially under the aegis of ALS-Chemex.

I have considered four separate types of QC data, as shown graphically on following 
pages.  The first is a set of standards monitoring data.  Certified standards were obtained
from CDN Resource Laboratories, and inserted by field personnel in a regular rotation. 
The second data set involves series of duplicate assay data, for field (two samples from 
an interval at the rig), preparation (i.e. two discrete pulps from a single sample) and assay 
(two assays of a pulp) duplicate pairs. The third set includes assays for Company 
inserted "blank" material.  The fourth set involves comparisons of fire assay / atomic
absorption ("FA/AA") assays and gravimetric fire assays ("FAGrav") on the same pulp. 

Defining the sampling protocols was an evolving process, as field personnel initially 
had little experience in rigorous procedures.  It took some time and effort to establish a 
routine protocol.  Complicating this was the fact that the laboratory changed its procedure
at the time of the ALS-Chemex transition; previously, they had provided routine 
preparation duplicate assays, whereas after the transition it became necessary to request
such duplicate pulp preparation on a routine basis, meaning that the sampling protocol 
had to be altered.

Before the advent of the automated assay recording procedures instituted by ALS-
Chemex, the assays were transferred to the electronic database manually.  This involved 
two steps.  First, the result on the atomic absorption instrument was read and written on a
paper record.  Then, the record was given to another technician to transfer to the 
database.  As can be appreciated, this procedure gave ample opportunity for transcription 
errors.  Most commonly, these involved missing or adding a digit in the final number (i.e. 
200 became 20, or conversely 20 became 200).  These were easy to catch if they involved
duplicate data, but more difficult in routine assay sets.  However, a few obvious 
discrepancies were observed and queried.  A more subtle problem involved possible 
incorrect keying of numbers (i.e. incorrect adjacent numbers on the number pad, such as 
8 for 5, etc.).  A very few of such suspicious numbers were seen and queried.  Such 
problems, although minor, occurred in the first three data sets. 

Standards monitoring plots – Phases 1 & 2 drilling (Holes Kao-07-RC-001 to 042): 
Standards in these phases of drilling were, in general, inserted in rotation after every

20th regular sample and one other control sample.  In the early work, the choice of 
standards was less than optimal, in the sense that there was no control at lower levels, but 
this was corrected at a later stage.  The monitoring plots for these phases follow:

It is evident from these plots that there were issues with standards at this stage of the 
program.  Fortunately, most of the errors were to the low side, thus implying a possible 
conservative bias.  In cases of highly aberrant assays, the laboratory was queried and in 
some cases re-assays were initiated.  Most of the out of range standards assays were 
within strings of low to very low routine assays, and therefore were not regarded as being 
of great concern. 

Standards monitoring plots – Phase 3 drilling (Holes Kao-07-RC-043 to 099): 
Standards in this phase of drilling were inserted in rotation after every 20th regular

sample and one other control sample.  By this time, the choice of standards was more 
reasonable for the grades expected.  The monitoring plots for this phase follow:

The standards performance in the Phase 3 drilling campaign was obviously much
superior to that in the earlier phases.  Very few of the assays lie outside the accepted
ranges, and those only by very small amounts.

One assay of standard CDN-GS-1P5 returned a value almost exactly one-half the 
expected value.  When queried, Abilab had a procedural explanation for this discrepancy. 
They were requested to re-assay a total of 14 nearby samples, as well as the offending 
standard.  The results for the routine samples were not substantially different and the 
standard now assayed well within the accepted range. 

The procedural problem has to do with formation of an excessively large lead button, 
which is then split in two for cupellation.  The two silver prills should then have been 
combined, but in rare instances this was not done, resulting in an assay about one-half
what it should have been.  One hopes that this is not a common occurrence – in any event 
such an error errs on the conservative side. 

Standards monitoring plots – Phase 4 drilling (Holes Kao-07-RC-100 to 150): 
tandards in this phase of drilling were inserted in rotation after every 20th regular

sam le and one other control sample.  Again, more appropriate standards were employed
for the grades expected.  The monitoring plots for this phase follow:

The standards performance in the Phase 4 drilling campaign was obviously much
superior to that in the first phases, but no better than that in Phase 3.  A few of the assays 
lie outside the accepted ranges; these are mostly within runs of very low routine assays
and do not give rise to serious concerns.  It is also interesting to note that standards assays 
in this phase tend to occupy the entire accepted range, rather than lying dominantly in the 
lower half as was the case in Phase 3. 

In the case of standard CDN-GS-3B, there are four assays well below range.  The 
lowest of these, on Report AB080094, is again just over one-half the accepted value, and 
when re-assayed fell within the range.  Nearby samples on re-assay showed no 
appreciable change in assay value.  One low result on Report AB080152 was within a 
long string of very low assays and was not checked.  Two results on Report AB080161 
were re-assayed and fell within range.  Surrounding samples returned somewhat higher 
values than originally, but the differences were not considered material.

Report OU08109434

The results of standards assaying in this phase of work are considered to be 
acceptable.  A few assays tend to lie very slightly above the upper edge of the range, but
not enough to warrant serious concern. 

Duplicate assay plots – General statement: 
Duplicate assays have been performed throughout the several drilling campaigns.  As

noted earlier, the protocol changed after the ALS-Chemex takeover, in that it then 
became necessary to request specific samples for duplicate pulp preparation. 

Duplicates are of three types.  The first, field or rig duplicates, involve taking a 
second sample from a given interval at the rig and applying a sequential number, so that 
the duplicate is blind to the laboratory.  This duplicate is designed to give, in conjunction 
with subsequent preparation and pulp assay duplicates, some measure of the total 
uncertainty due to field sampling.  The second, preparation duplicates, are prepared by 
having a second pulp prepared from a crushed sample.  These duplicates are designed to 
say something about the amount of uncertainty in the preparation plus assaying stages. 
The third, or pulp assay duplicates, involve a second assay from a pulp and are designed 
to say something about analytical precision. In an ideal situation, the precision should 
increase from rig to preparation to pulp assay duplicates.

Duplicate assay plots – Phases 1 & 2 drilling (Holes Kao-07-RC-001 to 042): 
In these phases of the drilling program, the rig duplicates were initially collected after

every 20 samples and 2 to 4 control samples; later in the program (Phase 2) the frequency
decreased so that there were 60 regular and several controls between rig duplicates. 
Preparation and assay duplicates were chosen by Abilab and were at very irregular 
intervals.  Plots of the three duplicate types for these phases follow:

"Blank" assay plots – General statement: 
In all sample shipments for the Kao RC drilling, coarse "blank" samples were 

included in a regular rotation. Blanks are inserted to try to evaluate the possibility of 
contamination from previous samples in the preparation process.  The material used was
collected from a road quarry and assumed to have a negligible gold content.  Assays to 
date lead one to question if this assumption is strictly speaking true. 

"Blank" assay plots – Phases 1 & 2 drilling (Holes Kao-07-RC-001 to 042): 
"Blank" samples were inserted after every 20 or 40 regular samples and some other 

controls.  A performance plot follows – note the logarithmic scale: 

The performance here is not particularly good.  Although most assays are below 20 
ppb Au, which is marginally acceptable, there are a few above this level.  The very high 
value (560 ppb) in Report AB07996 is almost certainly a sample mixup, whether in the
field or the laboratory is not known. 

"Blank" assay plots – Phase 3 drilling (Holes Kao-07-RC-043 to 099):

Performance for this phase is no better than for the previous phase. 

"Blank" assay plots – Phases 5 & 6 drilling (Holes Kao-07-RC-151 to 173): 
"Blank" samples were inserted after every 40 regular samples and three controls.  A 

performance plot follows – note the logarithmic scale: 

Performance here is somewhat better, but still not perfect.  The improvement may
have something to do with the entry of ALS-Chemex into the picture.  In light of the fact 
that the laboratory quotes its "blank" assays consistently as <5 or 5 ppb Au, one is forced 
to conclude that the company blank material is less than perfect. 

FA/AA v/s FA/Grav assay plots – General statement:
In many cases where the original fire assay / atomic absorption (FA/AA) assays 

exceeded 2000 ppb, the samples were re-assayed using a fire assay / gravimetric
(FA/Grav) technique.  The object was to provide a check on assays above this value, and 
to see if there was a bias between techniques.  In preparing the database for resource
purposes, the FA/Grav values were used.

QC Summary – Kao RC 

These plots show that for the first three data sets, there was a slight bias, with the 
FA/Grav assays on average being slightly lower.  This pattern was reversed in the fourth 
set (after the advent of ALS-Chemex), with the FA/Grav results being on average very 
slightly higher.  The differences are not considered to be material. 

Data presented in this review suggest that the Company initiated quality control 
procedures have been successful in showing that assay data from the Kao drilling are in 
general terms acceptable.  They also show how various laboratory issues can be identified 
and in most cases rectified.  There has been a demonstrable improvement in laboratory 
procedures and results following the ALS-Chemex takeover of Abilab.

CC: Paul Anderson, Cyriaque Ki, Mike McInnis 

From: Giles Peatfield

Re: Summary of second lab assay checks for Riverstone's Kao project RC drilling:

In the course of early RC drilling on the Kao project, two small sets of pulps were 
forwarded to second laboratories for check FA/AA assays.  The results of this work are 
detailed below: 

Pulps re-assayed by ALS-Chemex in North Vancouver: 
A total of 100 pulp samples from the early drilling at Kao (from holes Kao-07-RC-

005 to Kao-07-RC-020) were selected and forwarded to ALS-Chemex in North 
Vancouver ("N.V.").  Here they were assayed using the fire assay / atomic absorption 
("FA/AA") technique, as had been applied by Abilab in Burkina Faso ("B.F").  A total of 
17 of these pulps were also re-assayed in B.F.  Furthermore, a sub-set of four samples
were assayed in both N.V. and B.F. using a fire assay / gravimetric ("FA/Grav") 
technique.

The plots on the following pages show the correlation plots for the several different 
assay pair sets: 

The first two charts show the results of correlation plotting of the N.V. check assays 
against the B.F. originals, and the plot of the N.V. check assays against the B.F. data with 
the substitution of the B.F. re-assays.  There is very little difference between these two
plots.  There is little bias in either data set, and the correlations are strong. 

Note that all the charts presented here have logarithmic scales.

he next chart is a plot of the sub-set of assays for the 17 samples re-assayed by

to the Abilab facility in Bamako, Mali for comparative FA/AA assays.  Of these, one pair 
has been deleted because it appears to have been a transcription error in B.F., i.e. reported

From: Giles Peatfield

Re: Summary of QC data - Riverstone's Goulagou project drilling – 2008:

I have summarised the quality control ("QC") work for the RC drilling campaign at
Riverstone's Goulagou deposits in Burkina Faso, including work in two phases in 2008. 
This includes Riverstone drilling only; QC data for earlier drilling have been reported on 
elsewhere.

In the course of this review, I considered two separate sets of data.  These were made
up of assay information for two phases of RC drilling in 2008.  In the case of the first 
phase, assaying was by Abilab Burkina S.A.R.L. ("Abilab"), before the merger with 
ALS-Chemex.  The second set assaying was under the aegis of ALS-Chemex.

I have considered several types of QC data, as detailed on following pages.  The first 
is a set of standards monitoring data.  I have included charts for Riverstone inserted
standards for both phases of RC drilling in 2008.  Certified standards were obtained from 
CDN Resource Laboratories ("CDN"), and inserted in regular rotations, one standard 
after each 20 regular samples and one other control.  The second data set involves assays
for Riverstone inserted "blanks" for both phases of drilling.  The third data set involves
results of field, laboratory preparation and laboratory duplicate assays for each phase of 
drilling.  The fourth data set involves comparisons of fire assay / atomic absorption 
("FA/AA") assays and gravimetric fire assays ("FA/Grav") on the same pulp, for assays
for samples from both phases of RC drilling in 2008.  This comparison refers to all 
samples where the original (FA/AA) assay exceeded 2 ppm.

Defining the sampling protocols for Burkina Faso projects has been an evolving 
process, as field personnel initially had little experience in rigorous procedures.  By the 
time of the second phase of Goulagou drilling in 2008, rigorous field protocols had been 
established.

Standards monitoring plots – general comments: 
In the preparation of the monitoring charts for standards assays, I have used two sets 

of limits.  The first is that given by the company that prepared and certified the standards.
The second is a set designed for the analytical method, based on a formula provided by 
ALS-Chemex, which is in effect + 7% of the mean with a small factor added.  In the case 
of the three standards used, which were obtained from CDN, there is very little difference
between these sets of limits.

Monitoring plots – Riverstone inserted standards, 2008 Phases 1 & 2: 
In 2008, Riverstone used three different CDN standards, as shown on the following 

plots.  These standards were inserted at a rate of one per each set of twenty regular
samples and one other control sample.  Monitoring plots for the 2008 drilling follow:

hese plots show that the performance of assays for Riverstone inserted standards for 
the 2008 RC drilling at Goulagou was in general acceptable.  A very small number of 
results lay outside acceptable limits, but not far enough outside to be of serious concern. 
It is interesting to note that the assays for the higher grade standard (CDN-GS-3B) tended
to be on the low side, with some outside the lower limit, in Phase 1, before the
completion of the ALS-Chemex transition.  Assays for this standard were on average 
higher, although still within range, following the transition. 

Monitoring plots – Riverstone inserted "blanks", 2008 Phases 1 & 2: 

In all shipments for the Goulagou RC drilling in 2008, coarse "blank" samples were 
included in a regular rotation. Blanks are inserted to try to evaluate the possibility of 
contamination from previous samples in the preparation process.  The material used was
collected from a road quarry and assumed to have a negligible gold content.  Assays to 
date lead one to question if this assumption is strictly speaking true. 

Plots of the performance of blank assays for the two drilling phases are presented on 
the following page:

These plots show less than perfect results for blank assays, leading to one questioning 
the material used.  It is interesting to note, also, that the performance appears to have
improved markedly following the ALS-Chemex transition.

Duplicate assay plots – general statement:
For 2008 programs, Riverstone inserted field duplicate samples at regular intervals in 

the sample stream, and in the second phase of work (after the ALS-Chemex transition), 
requested preparation duplicates (two pulps from a single sample), also in a regular
rotation.  Prior to the transition, these had been done directly by Abilab.  Assay duplicates
(two assays on an individual pulp) were done routinely by the laboratory in both drilling 
phases.  Correlation plots for both phases follow – note the logarithmic scales:

FA/AA v/s FA/Grav assay plots – general statement: 
In cases where the original fire assay / atomic absorption (FA/AA) assays were in 

excess of 2.0 ppm, the samples were re-assayed using a fire assay / gravimetric
(FA/Grav) technique.  The object was to provide a check on higher assays, and to see if
there was a bias between techniques.  In preparing the database for resource purposes, 
FA/Grav values were used if available. 

The plots below show the relationship for the 2008 assaying for both drilling phases. 
There are a limited number of assays available for second phase.

In the case of the Phase 1 drilling, there is a slight bias toward lower results for the 
gravimetric assays, and a good correlation.  In the Phase 2 work, there are a limited 
number of samples and it is difficult to draw firm conclusions.

Re: Summary of QC data - Riverstone's Rambo project drilling – 2004, 2005 and 2008:

I have summarised the quality control ("QC") work for the core and RC drilling

and 2008.  This includes all Riverstone drilling to date, to be used in a resource estimate
for the deposit.

In the course of this review, I considered three separate sets of data.  These were
made up of assay information for: RC and core drilling in 2004; core drilling in 2005; and 
RC drilling in 2008.  In the case of the first two sets, assaying was by Abilab Burkina 
S.A.R.L. ("Abilab"), before the merger with ALS-Chemex.  The third set assaying was 
under the aegis of ALS-Chemex.

I have considered several types of QC data, as detailed on following pages.  The first 
is a set of standards monitoring data.  There are several sub-sets to consider here: I have 
included charts for both Riverstone and Abilab inserted standards for RC and diamond
core drilling in 2004; for Abilab inserted standards for diamond core drilling in 2005; and 
for Riverstone inserted standards for RC drilling in 2008.  Certified standards were 
obtained from ROCKLABS Ltd. ("ROCKLABS") and from CDN Resource Laboratories 
("CDN"), and inserted in reasonably regular rotations.  The second data set involves 
results of laboratory duplicate assays for RC drilling in 2004 and for diamond core
drilling in 2004 and 2005.  The third set includes sub-sets of assays relating to various 
types of duplicates in the screen metallic process used for many of the assays in 2004. 
The fourth set involves comparisons of fire assay / atomic absorption ("FA/AA") assays 
and gravimetric fire assays ("FAGrav") on the same pulp, for a small number of assays in 
2004, 2005 and 2008.  The final set is for a small number of second laboratory checks for
samples from diamond core drilling in 2005. I have not included plots for blank assays:
in 2004 and 2005 there were only Abilab "blanks" and all reported assays were less than 
"detection"; in 2008, Riverstone and Abilab inserted blanks were all <10 ppb.

Defining the sampling protocols was an evolving process, as field personnel initially 
had little experience in rigorous procedures.  The work in 2004 and 2005 was completed
before rigorous field protocols had been established, and relied much more heavily on 
laboratory quality controls.  New field protocols had been established by the time of the
2008 drilling, but there are very few samples in this data set. 

Most of the assay work considered was completed before the advent of the automated
assay recording procedures instituted at Abilab by ALS-Chemex.  In this process, the 
assay data were transferred to the electronic database manually.  It is my understanding 
that this involved two steps.  First, the result on the atomic absorption ("AA") instrument
was read and written on a paper record.  This record was then given to another technician
to transfer to the electronic database.  As can be appreciated, this procedure gave ample 
opportunity for transcription errors. 

Standards monitoring plots – general comments: 
In the preparation of the monitoring charts for standards assays, I have used two sets 

of limits.  The first is that given by the company that prepared and certified the standards.
The second is a set designed for the analytical method, based on a formula provided by 
ALS-Chemex, which is in effect + 7% of the mean with a small factor added.  In the case 
of the ROCKLABS Ltd. standards, the certified limits are in many cases much more 
restrictive, and I consider that the method limits are reasonable for monitoring purposes. 

Standards monitoring plots – Abilab inserted standards for 2004: 
In 2004, Abilab employed three different ROCKLABS standards, as shown on the

following plots.  These standards were inserted at a rate of one per each set of twenty 
assays.  Monitoring plots for the 2004 drilling follow:

These plots show acceptable performance of standards assays for the 2005 diamond
drilling program.  There were insufficient Riverstone inserted standards to warrant
preparation of charts; general performance for these standards was acceptable.

Standards monitoring plots – Riverstone inserted standards for 2008: 
Standards in this phase of drilling were inserted in rotation after every 20th regular

sample and one other control sample.  By this time, the choice of standards was more 
reasonable for the grades expected.  The monitoring plots for this phase follow:

The standards performance in the 2008 RC drilling campaign was acceptable.  Only 
one of the assays lies very slightly outside the accepted ranges. 

In summary, it is fair to say that the standards performance for the various drilling
campaigns at Rambo was reasonable.  There were no serious issues requiring re-assaying.
It is interesting, although probably not significant, that the Abilab inserted standards seem 
to assay somewhat closer to accepted values than do the Riverstone inserted ones.  The 
differences are not great enough to be a matter of concern.

Duplicate assay plots – General statement: 
Abilab performed duplicate assays of pulps on an irregular basis for the 2004 and 

2005 drilling.  There are no field or preparation duplicate assays available for this work, 
and too few duplicates of any kind available for the 2008 program to warrant comment.

For the most part, the results show that there is little bias between results for original 
and duplicate assays, and what there is can probably be ascribed to relatively few higher 
assays.  Note that for these and all subsequent duplicate assay charts, the axes have 
logarithmic scales. 

Duplicate assay plots – Rambo drilling, 2004– metallic screen assaying:

A sub-set of the above data involves the duplicate pulp assays performed on the
minus 150 mesh fraction in metallic screen analyses.  In this analytical technique, the 
minus fraction (that part of the pulp that passes a 150 mesh screen) is routinely assayed in 
duplicate by the standard FA/AA technique, and the average of the two values used in the
computation of the final assay. 

The two plots on the following pages show the results of this work for the RC and 
diamond core drilling respectively for 2004:

The plot for this data set shows a very small, probably insignificant, bias in favour of
the North Vancouver results, and a reasonable correlation.  The suggestion from this 
admittedly small sample set is that the Abilab assays are acceptable.

Data presented in this review suggest that the various quality control procedures have
been successful in showing that assay data from the Rambo drilling in 2004, 2005 and
2008 are in general terms acceptable.
