AMC 111041 : October 2011 1 

1 SUMMARY 

Overview 

Ivanhoe Australia Limited (IVA) has a number of mineral prospects in the Cloncurry 
area of Queensland. The prospect area is covered by eleven Mining Leases held by 
IVA within the Mount Isa Mining District. Access is by air from Mount Isa or 
Townsville and by road from Townsville. 

Priority is being given to development of the Merlin Molybdenum-Rhenium Project 
("The Project"), which is located some 145 km south-east of Mount Isa and 53 km 
north of the Osborne processing complex. 

In October 2010, IVA purchased mining leases and the Osborne mine, concentrator 
and infrastructure from Barrick (Osborne) Pty Ltd. The purchase included a 2 million 
tonne/year copper gold concentrator and associated maintenance and office 
facilities, a 24 MW gas/diesel power station, accommodation village for 470 people 
and a sealed airstrip. 

Mineral Reserves 

The Merlin Mo/Re orebody has unusually high molybdenum and rhenium grades 
compared to most other molybdenum-containing orebodies. Concentrate that will be 
produced by the Merlin project is not a by-product of copper sulphide flotation but 
instead is a primary source of molybdenum and rhenium.  

An independent Mineral Resource estimate by Golder Associates (Golder) of 
Brisbane, in August 2010 for Merlin and Little Wizard using a 0.3% molybdenum cut-
off reported: 

• Indicated Mineral Resource of 6.5 million tonnes @ 1.3% molybdenum and 
23 g/t of rhenium; and 

• Inferred Mineral Resource of 0.2 million tonnes @ 0.9% molybdenum and 
15 g/t of rhenium. 

This was reported in a NI43-101 technical report prepared by Golder titled "NI43-101 
Technical Report: Mount Dore - Merlin Deposit, NWQld, Australia; Report number 
107631016-011- Rev0; Submitted 19 Oct 2010". 

A Pre-Feasibility study (PFS) on the mining and processing of the Merlin deposit for 
the recovery of molybdenum, rhenium, copper and silver has been completed. This 
PFS has resulted in a Mineral Reserve estimate by AMC Consultants Pty Ltd (AMC) 
for the Merlin project as set out in Table 1.1.

Probable 6.7 75,000 128,000 1.1 19.1 

Total 6.7 75,000 128,000 1.1 19.1 

The effective date for this mineral reserve is 10 October 2011. 

The initial project life based on the known Mineral Reserves is greater than 10 years.  

Operating and Cost Data 

As a consequence of the purchase of the Osborne infrastructure, IVA's PFS scope 
was adjusted to consider regional aspects of the development of the Merlin deposit. 
The PFS has identified that project economics would be optimised by the 
development of a new access road between Merlin and Osborne and the 
construction a new purpose-built molybdenum/rhenium sulphide flotation 
concentrator located adjacent to the existing copper/gold concentrator.  

Ore will be crushed at Merlin and transported the 53 km to Osborne for processing. 
This pathway will allow synergies between the proposed Merlin molybdenum based 
operations and processing and the proposed copper-gold production and processing 
activities centralised at Osborne. 

The key Merlin project PFS operating and cost data are summarised in Table 1.2.

Further information is provided in Section 21 of this report. 

Economic Analysis 

As part of its economic evaluation, IVA commissioned a report on the outlook for 
molybdenum and rhenium markets from Roskill Consulting Group Ltd ("Roskill").  

Roskill expects the molybdenum market to move into deficit from 2013, with prices 
thereafter rising to around US$30 /lb Mo (Roskill, July 2011). In its report, Roskill 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 3 

forecasts molybdenum oxide prices to increase from an average price of 
US$16.50 /lb for 2011 to US$27.00 /lb (US$23.77 /lb in real terms) in 2016. 

Roskill forecasts rhenium metal prices to increase from an average of US$4,300 /kg 
in 2011 to US$5,500-5,900 /kg (US$4,842-5,194 /kg in real terms) in 2016 (ibid).  

IVA has adopted Roskill forecast real prices for molybdenum and the mid-point of 
forecast real prices for rhenium from 2011 to 2016 inclusive, with 2016 prices held 
constant thereafter together with a forecast AUD:USD exchange rate of 1.00 for the 
first three years of the project (inclusive), reducing to 0.83 thereafter. 

These evaluation assumptions together with the PFS assumptions yield the following 
economic results for the Merlin project: 

• NPV (at 8% real discount rate): A$690 M. 

• After-tax cash flow: A$1,563 M. 

• Internal rate of return (IRR): 32%. 
• Payback Period (from the date of first production) of approximately four years. 

Further information regarding the outlook for the molybdenum and rhenium markets 
is provided in Section 19 of this report. Further information regarding the economic 
evaluation of The Project is provided in Section 22 of this report. 

PFS optimisation opportunities 

The PFS has identified a number of optimisation opportunities that will be 
investigated during any feasibility study (FS) of The Project.  

The key opportunities are briefly outlined below. 

Mining cost: 

• The PFS has assumed 15 m sublevels in the underground mine. As a 
consequence of further evaluation following completion of the PFS these have 
now been modified to 20 m sublevels which will reduce the mining cost. Any FS 
will be completed on this basis. 

• The PFS focused attention on traditional mining methods. It has been identified 
that innovative mechanical mining may have potential at The Project and thus 
will be included in any FS scope. A mix of long hole open stoping and drift and 
fill stoping will also be considered as part of the optimisation of mining 
methods. 

• Sensitivity analysis which has been undertaken on The Project indicates that a 
10% reduction in mine operating costs is likely to improve NPV and after-tax 
cash flow by approximately A$47 M and approximately A$85 M respectively. 

Molybdenum concentrate grade: 
• In this report, for design purposes, it has been assumed that all of the Mo/Re 

concentrate grade will be 30% Mo, however testwork has shown that two 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 4 

concentrate grades at 50% Mo and 30% Mo can be produced. Further work will 
be completed during the early stages of the FS to optimise the product streams 

Capital cost: 

• The molybdenum/rhenium sulphide concentrate produced will be processed 
through a purpose-built, conventional technology, roasting and 
hydrometallurgical plant to produce saleable products including molybdenum 
trioxide and ammonium perrhenate (APR). The sale of the Mo/Re concentrate, 
the optimisation of the process design to minimise capital cost as well as the 
potential to produce other Mo products including ferro-molybdenum (FeMo), 
ammonium di-molybdenate and sulphuric acid, will be investigated in the early 
stages of the FS. This has the potential to reduce the capital cost of the 
processing plant. 

• This PFS assumed that the Mo/Re roaster and hydrometallurgical plant is 
located at Osborne. Alternative locations in other countries will be evaluated in 
the early stages of the FS to potentially reduce the capital expenditure and 
optimise the return on investment. 

Sensitivity analysis which has been undertaken on The Project indicates that a 
10% reduction in overall capital costs is likely to improve NPV and after-tax 
cash flow by approximately A$31 M and approximately A$35 M respectively. 

Life extension: 

• Exploration within the existing tenements where there have been high grade 
molybdenum finds has the potential to extend the life of the Mo/Re project. 

Property 
The property consists of five Mining Leases containing molybdenum, rhenium and 
copper mineralisation suitable for treatment by flotation and further processes. As 
The Project underlies the Mount Dore Copper Heap Leach Project, the leases cannot 
be identified separately for those two projects. Exploration drilling for The Mount 
Dore Copper Heap Leach Project intersected the Merlin deposit and studies of The 
Project have been performed in parallel with studies for the development of the 
Mount Dore Copper Heap Leach Project. 

Ownership 
The five Mining Leases are owned by Cloncurry Mines Pty Ltd and are on the 
Starcross Pastoral Holding, which also is owned by Ivanhoe Cloncurry Mines Pty Ltd. 
Ivanhoe Cloncurry Mines Pty Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IVA. 

Geology and Mineralisation 
Mount Dore is part of a wider exploration focus for IVA over a number of tenements 
in the same region. This area lies within the Eastern Fold Belt of the Mount Isa Inlier. 
The project area stratigraphy is part of the Soldiers Cap Group and Young Australia 
Group, which are part of regional Cover Sequence 3. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 5 

Molybdenum-rhenium and copper mineralisation at Mount Dore is hosted within a 
tectonised sequence of metashale, metasiltstone, schist and phyllite belonging to the 
Proterozoic Kuridala Formation in the Eastern Fold Belt of the Mount Isa Inlier. This 
stratigraphic package lies to the west of the over-thrust Mount Dore Granite and 
extends north-south along strike for several kilometres and dips eastward 
underneath the granite. A massive, easterly-dipping, intensely-silicified quartzite 
ridge in the western side of the area forms the footwall to the deposits. 

Copper and Mo-Re mineralisation is hosted within variable proportions of 
interfingered black carbonaceous and grey micaceous metasiltstone and grey 
metashales with thicker beds of phyllite and schist. These metasedimentary units 
exhibit recrystallisation textures but retain relict sedimentary features such as 
bedding and folding in outcrop. 

Status of Exploration, Development and Operations 
There has been exploration drilling performed to support mineral resource and 
mineral reserve estimates at The Project. A decline has been commenced. There is 
no operating mine or mill at the property. 

Conclusions 
1. The Project orebody and associated processing facilities have the capacity to 

produce, on average, 5,030 t/a molybdenum and 7.21 t/a rhenium in saleable 
products for a period in excess of 10 years. 

2. Capital cost to first production is estimated at A$337 M and Life of Mine 
A$518 M. 

3. Economic analysis shows the Project is viable for a range of molybdenum and 
rhenium prices. Based on Roskill's forecast prices for molybdenum and 
rhenium and an AUD:USD exchange rate of 1.00 for the first three years of the 
project (inclusive) reducing to 0.83 for the remaining mine life, NPV is 
A$690 M, after-tax cash flow is A$1,563 M and IRR is 32%. 

Recommendations 
1. Continue development of The Project decline to be able to access and develop 

the mineral reserve to be able to mine 500,000 t/y ore by the third quarter of 
2013. 

2. Proceed to Feasibility Study to optimise the mining method and cost, 
commence detailed design of the Mo/Re sulphide flotation plant and roaster 
and hydrometallurgical plant to produce saleable products. 

3. Continue to explore in the region to extend the project life.

3 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

A solicitor's report dated 19 October 2010 on the status of the Mount Dore mining 
tenements was prepared by Minter Ellison Lawyers and was included as Appendix B 
in the Golder Associates NI43-101 report dated 19 October 2010. The Minter Ellison 
report concluded that the Mount Dore Mining Licenses appear to be in good standing 
and unencumbered. AMC has relied upon this advice and on advice from IVA that 
lease renewals were subsequently completed and has not sought further advice on 
the standing of the tenements.

All of the relevant mining leases are valid for the purpose of mining gold, silver, 
copper, cobalt, molybdenum, zinc and lead. ML 2566 is also valid for mining a 
number of other minerals. Rhenium is not listed as a specified mineral for the existing 
mining leases. IVA has applied for rhenium to be added to the mining leases and 
AMC understands this should only be a formality. Otherwise rhenium falls with the 
encompassing Exploration Permit for Mining (EPM) held by IVA.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY  

5.1 Accessibility 

Access is by chartered aircraft via an all-weather airstrip from Mount Isa and 
Townsville, or by road from Cloncurry, 140 km to the north. Currently Mount Dore is 
serviced by a charter flight from Townville on two days per week and a number of 
smaller charter flights to Mount Isa. 

Mount Isa is the largest city and main supplies centre for the region, whereas 
Cloncurry is a smaller, local supply town. The population of Mount Isa and 
surrounding area is about 35,000; and Cloncurry has a population of 2,400. 

IVA announced the strategic acquisition of the Osborne copper and gold mine, 
processing facilities and tenements on May 25 2010. Osborne is a fly-in fly-out 
operation with its employment base at Townsville. Osborne operates charter flights to 
and from site to Townsville, currently on four days per week. Supplies are 
transported by road haulage from Mount Isa. Services are sourced from Mount Isa or 
Townsville. 

5.2 Vegetation and Climate 

Vegetation consists of arid spinifex and sparse eucalypt trees. The area has a semi-
arid climate with temperatures averaging from 10° to 25°C in the winter and from 25° 
to 40°C in the summer. Average rainfall is 350 mm, most of it occurring during the 
summer months of December to March. 

The climate at Osborne is typical of the inland arid zones of sub-tropical north west 
Queensland. The majority of rainfall comes from summer thunderstorms and 
decaying depressions drifting down from the north coast. The average annual rainfall 
is 320 mm. Temperatures range from extremely hot (average maximum 38°C) in 
summer to mild (average minimum 7.6°C) in winter. 

The weather is amenable for mining operations year-round, although construction 
activity could be affected in the wet season. 

The area forms part of the interior lowlands physiographic region with topography 
varying between gently-undulating plateau and local hilly terrain. Surface elevations 
vary from about 200 to 400 m above sea level. Eucalypt-spinifex grass-woodland 
vegetation predominates on deep soils; grass with scattered scrub is common within 
flat, open, soil-filled drainages. 

5.3 Water Supply 

IVA has rights to extract 260 Ml of water from the Mount Dore aquifer. IVA has a 
pipeline to the Burke River Bore Field that can supply up to 100 l/s and has annual 
rights to extract 1,000 Ml from this field. IVA has a partly filled licensed tailings 
storage facility that was in use when the Selwyn Operation closed in 2003.

5.4 Infrastructure 

Power would be supplied by rental power station, with gas trucked from the Osborne 
mine site. An access road to the Osborne mine site would be upgraded. Water would 
be supplied from nearby boreholes. There is an existing village and aerodrome at 
Mount Dore. More details are supplied in Section 18, Project Infrastructure. 

5.5 Mining Surface Infrastruture 

All mining surface infrastructure is to be accommodated within the existing mining 
leases.

6 HISTORY 

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in 
October 2010 (Golder, 2010) and reproduced here with some exclusions of Mount 
Dore specific information which is not relevant to the Merlin Mo-Re resource. 

Relevant history for the Mount Dore and the Merlin Zone has been summarised by 
Lazo and Pal (2009).  

Copper mining commenced in the area at Mount Elliott (20 km north of Mount Dore) 
in the early 1900's. A mining and copper smelting operation was established that was 
linked by rail to Cloncurry. This operation closed in the 1920's. It was during the early 
part of the 1900's that copper was most likely first mined from Mount Dore from 
outcropping oxides, although total recorded production up to 1961 was only 
5.9 tonnes of copper. Figure 6.1 displays the previous surface workings and with 
limited waste dump confirming previous mining was not extensive. 

Figure 6.1 Historic Workings at Mount Dore Displays Limited Disturbance 

 

The first modern drilling was conducted in 1957, and only one hole intersected the 
deposit, returning 1.3% Cu over 8.8 metres at a depth of 49.7 metres.  

Mount Dore was subsequently subjected to a series of company acquisitions, 
mergers and joint ventures. The tenement was acquired by Amoco, which later 
became Cyprus Minerals Australia Company (Cyprus), in 1975. In 1984, Mungana 
Mines Limited (later on Elders Resources Limited) got involved in the project while 
Cyprus took on Sunland Petroleum (later Arimco NL) as partner in Australia. The 
project in 1990 became a joint venture between Cyprus (50%), Arimco (25%) and 
Elders (25%) and briefly closed in 1999 before Selwyn Mines Limited purchased the 
property and recommenced operations on the Starra Line and Mount Elliott. This 
operation failed after an attempt to increase production to 2 million tonnes per year 
from 700,000 tonnes per year. A fall in the copper and gold price and a slower than 
expected ramp up in production caused the banks to foreclose on the owners in 
December 2002. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 17 

In September 2003 Ivanhoe Cloncurry Mines Pty Ltd acquired the tenements, 
exploration data and pastoral station from the receivers of Selwyn Mines Limited. 
Other items purchased at the sale were fixed assets, including the water pipeline, 
power station and camp. 

Between September 2003 and June 2008, IVA completed an additional 19,273 m of 
drilling. During a reverse circulation (RC) drilling campaign, aimed at identifying 
additional near-surface copper occurrences to the north of the Mount Dore deposit, a 
hole encountered significant molybdenite mineralisation. 

This prompted a review of drilling data to determine the potential of the area, which 
led to the identification of the 700 m long, north-north-easterly-trending Merlin Zone 
that contained molybdenite at the northern end and molybdenum oxide at the 
southern end. Following the discovery, additional analytical work was conducted to 
investigate the associated rhenium content, which returned high values.  

Exploration work conducted on the Mount Dore Project is defined in this report as 
that within the area bounded by 7,604,000-7,606,150 mN and 447,000-448,000 mE. 
The Merlin Zone lies within the northern area of the overall project, from 7,605,000 to 
7,606,150 mN, with the Little Wizard 'bonanza' shoot at the far south edge of the 
Merlin Zone. The majority of drilling on the Merlin Zone has been done by diamond 
drilling (DD), and lesser portion by reverse circulation drilling (RC). Most of the 
drilling was done by Ivanhoe Australia Limited, and a minor amount by previous 
operators. IVA's work also included twinning of RC and DD holes, which indicated 
that the RC drilling underestimates copper and molybdenum grades-one reason why 
RC was discontinued. 

The history of exploration and mining at Mount Dore includes: 

1900's High grade surface copper enrichment mined. Total recorded production 
up to 1961 was only 5.9 tonnes of copper (it is unclear if this is ore or 
metal).  

1957  Initial drilling was conducted in 1957, and only one hole intersected the 
deposit, returning 1.3% Cu over 8.8 metres at a depth of 49.7 metres.  

1976-80 Cyprus completed 40 diamond and 47 percussion drill holes. 

1989-91 Cyprus completed 8 diamond drill holes, plus 54 Airtrack and 15 RAB 
near surface drill holes. 

1999 Arimco completed 5 RC and diamond drill holes. 

2003 Ivanhoe Cloncurry Mines (ICM fully owned by IVA) acquired the Mount 
Dore tenements from the receivers of Selwyn Mines. 

2003-7  IVA undertook widespread exploration with some drilling at Mount Dore. 

2007  IVA RC drilling completed to define near surface extent of the 
mineralisation at Mount Dore South.  

2008 IVA drilling at Mount Dore south targeting secondary copper zone. QG 
completed an initial resource estimate for Mount Dore South in 2008. IVA

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in 
October 2010 (Golder, 2010) and reproduced here for reference. 

Descriptions of geological setting presented here are based on work by Lazo and Pal 
(2009) and Carter et al. (2009). References are contained in these two reports. 

Mount Dore is part of a wider exploration focus for IVA over a number of tenements 
in the same region. This area lies within the Eastern Fold Belt of the Mount Isa Inlier 
(refer to Figure 7.1).The project area stratigraphy is part of the Soldiers Cap Group 
and Young Australia Group (which are lateral facies equivalents), and which are part 
of regional Cover Sequence 3. The depositional age for these Groups is 
1712-1654 Ma, while the main phase of deformation and metamorphism is 
considered as equivalent to the Isan Orogeny at 1530-1480 Ma, associated with the 
Williams-Naraku Batholith. 

Figure 7.1 Cloncurry-Selwyn Zone of the Eastern Fold Belt 

 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 21 

7.1 Regional Geology 

For the Mount Elliott and Mount Dore district the tenement package is a highly 
prospective locality hosting four advanced projects (Merlin, Mount Dore, Starra and 
Mount Elliott) as well as significant copper-gold and molybdenum-rhenium 
exploration projects. 

The majority of the copper-gold deposits in the area belong to the IOCG style of 
mineralisation. The copper-dominant polymetallic zone at Mount Dore has only low 
levels of iron oxide and could represent an iron-oxide poor member of the IOCG 
spectrum, with fluids and fluids sources similar to the other IOCG deposits. Merlin, 
the molybdenum-rhenium mineralised zone is a late phase overprint on the copper 
system at Mount Dore. 

The deposits in the region tend to focus on geological and structural elements, 
namely being in close proximity to: 1) the contact of the Kuridala and Staveley 
Formations, 2) regionally extensive north-south trending shear and fault zones (long-
lived faults that have been the principal conduits for fluid flow and alteration), 3) late 
NE and NW trending structures, and 4) proximity to a Williams-Naraku Batholith 
intrusion. 

Figure 7.2, demonstrates the surface relationship. The plan shows the NS linear belt 
of the metasedimentary packages of Stavely and Kuridala Formations, in part 
bisected by the Mount Dore Fault Zone (MDFZ), increasingly intense NW-NE faulting 
around prospect locations. The whole metasedimentary package is buttressed either 
on one or both sides by granites, generally in close proximity to the major prospects. 

Stratigraphy 

Proterozoic lithologies of interest in the project area are the Staveley Formation and 
the Kuridala Formation. The Staveley Formation comprises a >2000 m thick linear 
belt of shallow water, well-bedded to brecciated variably calcareous, ferruginous, 
feldspathic, micaceous, and siliceous sandstone, siltstone, and phyllite, impure 
limestone (marble), and lenses of breccia, together with schist and banded calc-
silicate rocks (mainly near granite), and minor basalt lava, conglomerate, and banded 
quartz + hematite +/- magnetite rock. The Stavely Formation has a depositional age 
of <1720±20 Ma. 

The Kuridala Formation is a tightly folded package of moderately deep-water 
turbiditic sediments (schistose greywacke, siltstone and shale) with quartzite, 
carbonaceous and pyritic slate and calc-silicate rocks. The thickness of this 
sequence is >2000 m, although neither the top nor the base of the Kuridala 
Formation is well established. The Kuridala Formation has a depositional age of 
<1681±5 Ma. 

Intrusives 

The series of linear batholith scale granitic intrusives are significant lithologies in the 
Mount Elliott to Mount Dore district (refer to Figure 7.2). These include the Wonga 
Granite (Gin Creek Granite) (1760-1730 Ma) which was emplaced 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 22 

contemporaneously (into CS2), and the Williams-Naraku Batholiths (Mount Dore, 
Squirrel Hills, Yellow Waterhole, Wimberu Granites and SWAN Diorite) 
(1556-1504 Ma) outcrop over a large area in the EFB and were emplaced in late syn- 
to post-Isan Orogeny time. 

Several dykes and sills intrude the Kuridala and Staveley Formations. In Mount 
Elliott, distinct bedding concordant basalt intrusives (metamorphosed to amphibolite) 
were noted in the host Kuridala Fm. The same concordant dykes and/or sills were 
noted in Mount Cobalt, Lady Ella, and Starra. 

Tectonics 

A complex regional metamorphic history (comprising six sequences) and peaking 
prior to the emplacement of Williams-Naraku intrusives has been proposed. The 
Mount Elliott - Mount Dore district has been mapped at greenschist facies to 
amphibolite facies metamorphism. The basement and cover sequences were 
deformed and metamorphosed by the Isan Orogeny (ca 1600-1500 Ma). Up to seven 
deformational events in the Eastern Fold Belt have been postulated. Of these 
deformation events four major events impact on the project area: 

• D1: Early thrusting. 

• D2: Upright N-S large scale folding synchronous with the peak of 
metamorphism. 

• D3: Folding of D2 folds. Brittle-ductile deformation with intrusion of. 

• D4: Upright N-S folding. Brittle events producing NE - NW faults are integral to 
the formation of many of the deposits in the region. 

Structure 

District structure is dominated by the regional-scale Starra, Selwyn and Mount Dore 
shear and thrust zone, which runs through the core of the district. These NS striking 
structures host a number of deposits (refer to Figure 7.2), and include: 

• Mount Dore Fault Zone (MDFZ): A north-south striking deep seated structure 
along the limb of two major regional folds, resulting in sheared sub-parallel 
series of faults which host a number of prospects including Marilyn, Mount 
Dore, Merlin, Flora, Busker and Metal Ridge. 

• Mount Dore Silicified Zone (MDSZ): A north-south striking silicified ridge that 
extends for at least 10 km both north and south of Mount Dore, and broadly 
marks the western limit of the MDFZ. This forms the footwall to the Merlin and 
Mount Dore (refer to Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4). 

• The Starra Shear Zone is located 2 km west of and parallel to the MDSZ. 
• The Selwyn Line comprises an intensely alkali-iron-silica-carbonate altered 

section of the Starra shear zone, which is host to multiple high grade gold-
copper shoots.  

• The Selwyn Shear Zone runs parallel to the Starra Shear and the Starra 
deposits area. It essentially marks the Eastern Haematites, a line of ironstones.  



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED

AMC 111041 : October 2011 23 

• Brecciation is a feature of many deposits in the district. Both hydrothermal 
(Amethyst Castle) and faulted and crackle (Mount Elliott) breccias are 
represented as well as combinations and overprints of the all styles throughout 
the region. The abundance of late brittle fractures may have also contributed to 
the development of secondary copper enrichment as noted in the Mount Elliott, 
Mount Dore, Victoria and Lady Ella.

Alteration 

In the Southern Cloncurry District metasomatic alteration events play a fundamental 
part in the formation of the majority of ore deposits within the belt, by either being 
directly associated with carrying ore minerals or by rheologically preparing rocks for 
brittle fracture or ductile shearing. There are two main regional scale alteration 
events: 

• The first of these events is a regional Na-Ca metasomatic event. 
• The second regional alteration event consists of large scale K-Fe-Mg alteration. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 26 

Both these alteration assemblages are commonly found associated with 
mineralisation within the region. 

Specific alteration types and episodes noted in the district and deposit related are: 

• Iron-oxide alteration early - shear hosted (Starra) magnetite or hematite rich. 

• Iron-oxide alteration later - veined replacive (Mount Elliott) magnetite. 

• Sodic alteration (widespread) - replacive, veined, stockworking and brecciation 
(Mount Elliott). 

• Sodic-calcic alteration - banded, veined, massive and breccia replacive and 
infilled (Starra, SWAN and Mount Elliott). 

• Potassic alteration (widespread) - veins and breccia clasts replacement and 
matrix infill K-feldspar, carbonate and biotite veining (Mount Dore, Merlin, Lady 
Ella and Starra). 

• At least four fluid sources have been proposed as being involved in the 
regional alteration, metasomatism and formation of ore deposits. 

7.2 Local and Property Geology 

Molybdenum-rhenium and copper mineralisation at Mount Dore is hosted within a 
tectonised sequence of metashale, metasiltstone, schist and phyllite belonging to the 
Proterozoic Kuridala Formation in the Eastern Fold Belt of the Mount Isa Inlier (refer 
to Figure 7.7). This stratigraphic package lies to the west of the over-thrust Mount 
Dore Granite and extends north-south along strike for several kilometres and dips 
eastward underneath the granite. A massive, easterly-dipping, intensely-silicified 
quartzite ridge in the western side of the area forms the footwall to the deposits. 

Copper and Mo-Re mineralisation is hosted within variable proportions of 
interfingered black carbonaceous and grey micaceous metasiltstone and grey 
metashales with thicker beds of phyllite and schist (refer to Figure 7.7). These 
metasedimentary units exhibit recrystallisation textures but retain relict sedimentary 
features such as bedding and folding in outcrop. Brief descriptions of these units 
which appear to have a spatial correlation with mineralisation are included below and 
can be related to the example core photographs in Figure 7.5. 

Hanging Wall Granite 

The Mount Dore Granite, dominating the eastern section of the project area, is part of 
the extensive Williams-Naraku Batholith. This intrusion forms the unmineralised 
hanging wall to the Cu and Mo mineralisation and conceals the greater part of the Cu 
and Mo ore body. 

Metasiltstone 

The metasiltstone consists of recrystallised quartz grains with a micro mosaic texture 
with occasional incipient K-feldspar grain of hydrothermal origin. Another variety of 
the metasiltstone appears to have a slightly silky sheen due to fine muscovite 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 27 

(sericite) and is probably derived from clayey or muddy protolith. The metasiltstone is 
the predominant unit in the metamorphic sequence. 

Figure 7.5 Typical Host Rocks for Mount Dore North 

 

Black Shale 

The carbonaceous metashales consists of extremely fine-grained oriented muscovite 
(sericite) and the dark colour is attributed to the presence of abundant ultrafine 
graphite along laminations (generally <5% of rock). The black shale unit occurs 
predominantly within the hanging wall to mineralization, stratigraphically below the 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 28 

Mount Dore Granite (refer to Figure 7.6). However, it is also observed as a 
mineralization host rock, as well as in a footwall position. This unit bifurcates into at 
least three (3) discrete lithological units above the mineralization to the north, and is 
interpreted to be offset by vertical structures down dip. 

Figure 7.6 Geology, Mo & Cu Significant Intersections on Section 7605450 N 

 

Phyllite 

The phyllite unit occurs predominantly as a single unit which broadly follows the 
geometry of the bounding granite and quartzite (refer to Figure 7.7). Mineralization 
can be contained within the phyllite, but also sits in a footwall position from 
7,505,600 mN moving south. This unit has been geologically modelled with the view 
to using it as a geological marker unit throughout the deposit. 

Quartzite 

The footwall unit to the Kuridala Formation forms a narrow linear and north-south 
trending ridge west of the project area. This massive, intensely silicified 'quartzite' 
ridge, with little internal texture, dips east and is less than 40 m in true thickness. 
This zone may define the Mount Dore Fault and may serve as the boundary between 
the host metasedimentary package of the Kuridala Formation and the underlying 
siltstone and shale units of the Staveley Formation.

The Mount Dore project is situated within the meta-sedimentary rocks of the 
Proterozoic Kuridala Formation to the west of and below the Mount Dore granite 
body shown in Figure 7.2. 

Mount Dore is a polymetallic deposit containing copper, zinc, silver, gold, lead, cobalt 
and molybdenum with rhenium in the Merlin zone all within the Kuridala Formation.  

The near surface mineralisation has been extensively oxidised such that the copper 
rich zones outcrops as copper oxides above a thick zone of chalcocite mineralisation. 
The primary zone consists of chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena and molybdenite as the 
visible ore minerals. Chalcocite extends into the primary zone and may also be 
hypogene (ie original mineralisation). 

Mineralisation dips to the east beneath the Mount Dore granite body in a zone of 
about 180 m true thickness.  

Surface oxidation of the primary sulphides produced overlapping zones of copper 
rich minerals dominated by a suite of secondary copper sulphide and copper oxide 
minerals, as well as native (metallic) copper. 

The supergene process at Mount Dore involves the conversion of the primary copper 
and other sulphides to predominately chalcocite followed by further oxidation to 
produce chrysocolla, native copper, cuprite and pseudomalachite. 

7.3.1 Copper Mineralisation 

The bulk of the currently known Cu mineralisation in the project area consists of 
secondary Cu oxides and carbonates (chrysocolla, cuprite, chalcotrichite, 
pseudomalachite, minor to trace azurite and malachite) and native Cu after 
chalcocite. This oxide zone is underlain by a transition zone dominated by chalcocite 
(replacing pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) and trace covellite (Lazo and Pal, 
2009). The oxides and native Cu penetrate deeper into the transition zone within 
major shears and fault zones. Primary Cu mineralisation was emplaced in breccias 
and fractures that were best developed in the metasiltstones and black shales and 
are only weakly developed in the schists and phyllites. 

Two major episodes of Cu mineralisation have been recognised: an earlier 
chalcopyrite-pyrite-sphalerite-bornite assemblage emplaced into brecciated 
metasiltstone and black shale with associated K-feldspar ± quartz, and a later 
dolomite-hosted breccia with chalcopyrite-pyrite sphalerite. Trace to minor galena, 
cobaltite, arsenopyrite and molybdenite are noted in the primary sulphide zone. Both 
types of primary Cu sulphide became the source of the secondary enrichment zones 
for Cu by weathering, after the unroofing of the granite cover by erosion. Very little 
gossan is developed. 

Note the overlap of copper mineral species in the transitional zone and the presence 
of chalcocite, native copper and sulphides in the Primary zone as graphically 
indicated in Figure 7.8.

7.3.2 Molybdenum-Rhenium Mineralisation 

Fracture-controlled and breccia-matrix molybdenite mineralisation is hosted within K-
feldspar-altered and albitised black shales and siltstones, which lie above and below 
the foliated schist and phyllite (Lazo and Pal, 2009). The footwall structure at the 
base of the foliated phyllite and schist appears to have the strongest Mo and is 
inferred to have developed good open structures due to competency contrast. This 
basal contact also appears to have acted as good barrier for the Mo-rich fluids, thus 
resulting in ponding of the metals in the favourable structures just below the contact. 
The mineralised matrix-breccias contain sub-rounded clasts of K-feldspar and clay-
altered siltstone with very minor clay; with molybdenite partially to completely 
replacing the breccia matrix (refer to Figure 7.9). Minor patchy pyrite and chalcopyrite 
within the matrix are commonly enveloped by molybdenite. The molybdenite breccias 
are between several centimetres to several metres thick but most commonly less 
than one metre.  

Infill drilling has continued to demonstrate a consistent mineralised structure. At 
depth additional structures are defined. The style of mineralisation can vary from a 
few narrow zones of massive molybdenite to a broader zone of mixed mineralisation. 

The high grade Mo-Re mineralisation zone at Merlin comprises one or more narrow 
high grade veins between generally 2 and 10 m in width defined over a strike length 
of 1000 m and between depths of 60 and 580 m. This is surrounded by weak low 
grade mineralisation, predominantly in the footwall. Cu and Zn mineralisation 
increase at depth where Merlin overprints the lower Mount Dore North copper zone. 
Molybdenite also occurs as stylolitic fracture fill, disseminations and preferential infill 
of folded bedding planes. Molybdenite mineralisation in this form is often one to over 
10 m thick and is considered continuous between holes 25 to 50 m apart. Narrow 
patchy clay zones (illite, montmorillonite) are noted in some of the fractures infilled by 
molybdenite.

There will always be concerns with the short range continuity and how the zones can 
be interconnected. Golder has not observed any indication that the mineralisation is 
not largely continuous and can be extracted by conventional stoping methods. 
Continuity is currently demonstrated on 25 m to 50 m drill spacing. Exploration plans 
currently include an exploration decline with further underground drilling to prove up 
mineable units. 

Mo-Re mineralisation is very strongly correlated. This is partly related to the 
occurrence of Re which can largely only occur within the mineral structure of 
Molybdenite, the primary Mo bearing mineral. 

Figure 7.9 displays an example molybdenite breccia. On the left hand side there is a 
silica-feldspar altered metasiltstone clasts within massive molybdenite matrix fill, from 
hole MDQ0137; at a depth of 338.8 m. On the right hand side of Figure 7.9 is a 
breccia after feldspar-altered carbonaceous slate with porous matrix partly infilled by 
molybdenite and hematite, from hole MDQ0147; at a depth of 238.4 m.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in 
October 2010 (Golder, 2010) and is reproduced here for reference. 

Primary copper occurrences at Mount Dore are typical of many hydrothermal copper 
deposits in the Kuridala Formation south of Cloncurry. Mo-Re mineralisation is 
classified as late-stage hydrothermal mineralisation that overprints the Mount Dore 
mineralisation in part.  

Mount Dore  

The Mount Dore Deposit has polymetallic (Cu, Au, Ag, Zn, Pb, Mo and Co), 
secondary copper and Mo-Re mineralisation along the MDFZ. The deposit is hosted 
in tectonised carbonaceous metapelites, metasiltstones, schists and phyllites of the 
Proterozoic Kuridala Formation. The Mount Dore Granite to the east has been thrust 
over the Kuridala Formation, with east-dipping contact forming the hanging wall to 
mineralisation. Similar to the Merlin Mo-Re deposit, the polymetallic mineralisation 
and the resulting secondary copper zone have been emplaced along breccias 
parallel to the granite contact.  

The bulk of the currently known Cu mineralisation in the project area consists of 
secondary Cu oxides and carbonates (Chrysocolla, cuprite, chalcotrichite, 
pseudomalachite, minor to trace azurite and malachite) and native Cu after 
chalcocite. This oxide zone is underlain by a transition zone dominated by chalcocite 
(replacing pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite) and trace covellite. The oxides and 
native Cu penetrate deeper into the transition zone within major shears and fault 
zones. Primary Cu mineralisation was emplaced in breccias and fractures that were 
best developed in the metasiltstones and black metashales and are only weakly 
developed in the schists and phyllites. 

Merlin 

Merlin mineralisation is hosted within carbonaceous metapelites and metasiltstones. 
The molybdenite mineralisation occurs as breccia infill, disseminations, stylolites and 
irregular fracture infill along and adjacent a major fault contact between the 
underlying Staveley Fm and overlying Kuridala Fm. Much of the Mo-Re 
mineralisation at Merlin, and the overlying Cu mineralisation at Mount Dore, remain 
concealed under extensive granite.  

The high-grade, northeast-trending and east-dipping molybdenite mineralisation 
occurs at the base of the carbonaceous metapelite unit (Kuridala Formation) and 
above the calc-silicate banded unit (Staveley Formation). The contact is complex and 
this is manifest as several high grade lenses in some holes. Evidence from drilling 
suggests an overlap of the molybdenum-rhenium and the polymetallic mineralisation 
phases.  

Fracture-controlled and breccia-matrix molybdenite mineralisation is hosted within K-
feldspar-altered and albitised black shales and siltstones, which lie both above and 
below the foliated schist and phyllite. The footwall structure at the base of the foliated

phyllite and schist appears to have the strongest Mo and is inferred to have 
developed good open structures due to competency contrast. This basal contact also 
appears to have acted as significant barrier for the Mo-rich fluids, thus resulting in 
ponding of the metals in the favourable structures just below the contact. The 
mineralised matrix-breccias contain sub-rounded clasts of K-feldspar and clay-
altered siltstone with very minor clay, with molybdenite partially to completely 
replacing the breccia matrix. Minor patchy pyrite and chalcopyrite within the matrix 
are commonly enveloped by molybdenite. Molybdenite also occurs as stylolitic 
fracture fill, disseminations and preferential infill of folded bedding planes.

9 EXPLORATION  

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in 
October 2010 (Golder, 2010) and is here reproduced in its entirety for the 
convenience of the reader. 

The project history and exploration process is summarised in Item 6. 

Exploration work is only described in detail for the area relevant to the resource 
estimate at Mount Dore and Merlin within the area defined in Table 14.15 and Figure 
9.1. This area is subdivided into three distinct mineralised zones, including: 

• Mount Dore South (south of 7,605,000 mN) represents a deeply weathered 
copper dominated zone which has historically been targeted for exploration for 
near surface copper oxide material suitable for leach extraction; 

• Mount Dore North (north of 7,605,000 mN) is less deeply weathered but 
overlain by a depleted zone; hence the copper does not come near surface and 
has only been defined by more recent extension drilling. Polymetallic 
mineralisation with notable Zn mineralisation occurs in the primary zone. 

• Merlin and lower Mount Dore North (lower sequence north of 7,605,000 mN). 
This lower copper and polymetallic (mainly Zn) mineralisation contains some 
lower grade and some very high grade Mo-Re veins referred to as Merlin. 
Discovery and drill definition of the Merlin Mo-Re mineralisation resulted in the 
definition of both the lower and upper Copper zones in 2009 and 2010. 

Historic drilling is mostly diamond core and some near surface percussion and open 
hole drilling. Drilling is now dominated by IVA drilling. Initial IVA drilling at Mount Dore 
south included some RC drilling, but subsequently concentrated on diamond core 
drilling when the high grade Mo-Re resource was discovered. RC is still used 
primarily for precollars for deeper diamond drilling. 

IVA's work also included twinning of RC and DD holes (MDQ0153A and MDQ0153), 
which indicated that the RC drilling appears to underestimate copper and 
molybdenum grades. 

A map of the drill hole collar locations is shown on the geology plan in Figure 9.1. 

Drill spacing at depth from the historic drilling is too broad to consistently track the 
location of the higher grade mineralised zones such that in the past resources have 
been estimated within a grade shell at a cut-off grade of 0.2% Cu. To advance Mount 
Dore, the drill spacing has been closed up with step outs of between 50 m and 100 m 
down dip and across strike from the highest grade existing holes.

A diamond drilling program over the secondary copper zone and the northern 
primary copper zone at Mount Dore commenced in late 2007, intersecting significant 
Cu mineralisation. 

Inspection of the drill locations had shown that a large area up dip and along strike 
from the main Mount Dore copper mineralisation had not been adequately tested. A

few open hole percussion holes from the 1970s had been drilled to shallow depths 
indicating some weak copper mineralisation in the area. 

To test this area on a broad scale an RC percussion program was also carried out to 
define the near surface limits of the secondary copper mineralisation and to test the 
large area to the north-west of the main Mount Dore body. In total 36 holes were 
drilled in this program for 4,566 m.  

It was during this drilling that MDQ0153 located strong molybdenum mineralisation at 
the very base of the Kuridala sequence beneath copper oxides and sulphides.  

Drilling to the north of the main secondary copper zone has confirmed the presence 
of significant primary copper, zinc and silver mineralisation with elevated 
molybdenum values. RC drilling has found significant shallow secondary copper 
mineralisation and molybdenum at depth in MDQ0153 on the northernmost traverse 
drilled at Mount Dore. This intersection was twinned by diamond hole MDQ0153A. 

Figure 9.2 displays drilling activities and a panorama view of Mount Dore viewed 
from around the middle area of Mount Dore North. Looking west the quartzite ridge 
occurs in the footwall of the mineralisation. Granite hills lie to the east, behind the 
view provided, overlying the mineralisation in the hangingwall. The road traverses cut 
into the eastern side of the ridge allowed vertical RC drilling to test the near surface 
copper oxide continuation up dip in an area that could not be drilled with angle holes 
due to the steep topography.

looking South (left), West (middle) and North (right) 

MDQ0153 drilled into the flat area in the middle foreground and discovered Merlin; 
other RC holes on the flat were then extended with diamond tails to intersect the 
deeper Merlin mineralisation. 

During the definition and geotechnical drilling completed to assist the exploration 
decline development plan, a small very high grade zone was discovered in mid 2009. 
Called Little Wizard, this small zone has now been followed up with 13 mineralised 
drill intersections on roughly a 12.5 m drill spacing.

9.1 displaying the current resource intercepts, Zn and Pb values are low and not

Other exploration work by IVA consisted of termite mound sampling, which outlined 
copper and molybdenum anomalies along the stratigraphic belt between the 
overlying granite and underlying quartzite. Prior to IVA's work, Selwyn Mines Limited 
(Selwyn) conducted a CSAMT survey (Controlled Source Audio-Frequency 
Magnetotellurics) over the entire area, which didn't return any recognizable 
anomalies; however, when IVA re-examined the data and implemented refined data 
processing techniques, a broad north-north-easterly trending anomaly that roughly 
coincides with the Merlin Zone was outlined. IVA also completed a small SAM (Sub-
Audio Magnetic) and gravity survey over part of the area.

10 DRILLING 

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in 
October 2010 (Golder, 2010) and is here reproduced in its entirety for the 
convenience of the reader. 

The mineralisation at Mount Dore and Merlin is largely restricted to the Kuridala 
Formation and internal and bounding structures. These roughly dip at 50° to the east 
and can be as steep as 70° or as shallow as 30°. The Merlin high grade Mo 
mineralisation forms narrow planes or zones typically only a few metres in width 
which averages 3.9 m in true width and varies between 1 and 20 m (note a minimum 
2 m width is applied for resource domaining). This is contained within a low grade Mo 
mineralised dipping zone around 50 m in width. For the copper the higher grades 
form roughly planar zones around 4 to 10 m in width and are included within the 
lower grade envelope used for resource estimation of between 5 and 30 m in width at 
Mount Dore North and a more amorphous shape at Mount Dore South of between 
30 and 150 m in true width. Figure 14.17 to Figure 14.19 provide examples of the 
mineralisation widths modelled. 

Most drill holes are vertical or are inclined up to 60° to the west. This results in 
oblique intersections in most cases and apparent intersection widths much larger 
than the true width of the mineralisation.  

Typical dips of inclined mineralisation of 50° and drilling inclination of 70° would 
result in down hole intersections of 10% longer than true width. This scenario is 
common for the upper Cu and Mo-Re resource but increases with depth when 
targeting the narrow high grade Mo-Re resource where both steeper structures and 
occasional vertical drilling can result in down hole lengths up to 100% longer than 
true width. All resource estimation was undertaken using 3D modelling methods that 
account for the drill intercepts in true space and the different intersection lengths 
achieved by the drill orientation. The drill orientation approach undertaken by IVA is 
the most practical given the terrain and target depth. 

10.1 Drilling Methods 

Drilling by pre-IVA companies included a range of drilling types and sample 
procedures. 

Cyprus completed 32 diamond holes between 1976 and 1980 and used the data 
generated to calculate some preliminary geological resource estimates for the 
prospect. A number of open hole percussion holes were also drilled in the area. 

In 1989 to 1994 Cyprus completed a program of 16 diamond holes and 2 water bores 
in the Mount Dore prospect. 

Arimco undertook a significant part of the Mount Dore drilling in 1999-2000. To test 
near-surface open pit potential, 54 Airtrack and 15 RAB holes were drilled. In 
addition 8 diamond holes and 7 RC water bores were sampled. 43 RC holes in 2000 
added to this substantial campaign that tested the upper 50 m of the mineralisation.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 41 

This material was deemed unsuitable for the Selwyn plant due to the presence of 
malachite and chrysocolla, and the proposed open pit scenario was found to be 
uneconomic. Initial drilling by IVA from 2004 used diamond core for definition of the 
Mount Dore mineralisation. 

An RC program was carried out at Mount Dore south to help define the near surface 
limits of the secondary copper mineralisation.  

Subsequent to the 2008 RC program drilling has been targeted to intersect expected 
mineralisation with diamond core drilling. This preference has been accentuated 
since the discovery of the Merlin narrow high grade Mo-Re zone. Subsequent drilling 
has been by diamond core except for RC precollars which are restricted to areas 
expected to comprise hangingwall waste, i.e. generally granite. 

Typically holes cored from surface start at PQ, reducing to HQ and eventually NQ as 
the drilling conditions become more difficult with depth.  

The discovery of the Merlin deposit in December 2008 changed the emphasis of the 
exploration program from shallow infill of the Mount Dore South copper oxide 
resource to progressive extension and infill of the Mount Dore North and underlying 
Merlin deposits. This resulted in drilling progressively becoming deeper and stepping 
out further to the north. The focus on Merlin and Mount Dore North (north of 
7605000 mN) required RC precollars where there is significant unmineralised 
hanging wall granite expected. Table 10.1 summarises the exploration programs and 
drilling methods, and is restricted to only the exploration data relevant to the Mount 
Dore and Merlin resources, excluding exploration drilling at other nearby prospects.

10.2 Collar Surveys 

For the recent drilling by IVA, drill hole set-outs were by hand held GPS, then picked 
up by a contract survey company from Mount Isa using differential GPS over a 
number of campaigns from July 2009. All IVA drill holes were surveyed with the 
exception of 5 drill holes from 2004 that were buried and could not be located. One 
hole, started on 25 June 2010 for the most recent drilling had not been accurately 
surveyed. Since no sampling of that hole had been completed at cut off of 28 June it 
is not considered in the resource drilling subset. 

Historic drill hole collars (pre-IVA, from the 1970's onwards) were picked-up using 
traditional theodolite-based methods. Table 10.2 summarises the collar survey 
method for the drilling within the Mount Dore resource area. Collar survey data and 
methods are considered appropriate for detailed resource evaluation. The majority of 
the hole collars in the Merlin Project area have been accurately positioned using the 
prevailing industry standards.

10.3 Down Hole Surveys 

Recent down hole surveying techniques at Mount Dore have been performed by an 
electronic Reflex instrument ('EZ-SHOT') survey tool which operates in both single 
and multi-shot modes. Generally survey shots are taken initially at 30 m intervals in 
diamond core holes, but at much greater intervals (or sometimes even not at all) in 
the RC pre-collars. The single shot surveys are written down at the drill site and 
manually entered into the acQuire database. This device relies on magnetism to 
determine the drill hole azimuth, so it will be affected by magnetic minerals. Since 
2009 the same survey tool is regularly used to resurvey the drill hole in multi-shot 
mode at even 6 m intervals down hole. This data is to the acQuire database. 

Pre-IVA, the most common form of down hole surveying was by Eastman single shot 
camera. However, as there appears to be very little magnetite, pyrrhotite or other 
magnetic minerals at Merlin or the oxide zones at Mount Dore, the azimuths should 
be quite reliable. A small number of holes drilled in 1999 in the southern part of the 
deposit were surveyed with a Maxibor instrument, with good correlation to the 
magnetic single shot surveys during drilling. 

Validation of the down hole surveys was undertaken by IVA based on several criteria 
including survey intervals greater than 50 m and survey deviations in dip or azimuth 
>3°. The down hole surveys were reviewed and historical records checked.

Two programs of gyroscopic down hole survey were undertaken to both resurvey 
earlier suspect IVA drill hole surveys identified in the internal review and also to 
locate some of the deeper Merlin drilling more accurately. These were surveyed 
using hired GyroSmart (Reflex) and Multishot Ez Track camera (Reflex) and in 2010 
a Humphries SR Gyro operated by Surtron Technologies. A total of 24 drill holes 
were check surveyed in late 2009 and 57 in mid 2010. 

The implementation of the acQuire database allows the replacement of earlier down 
hole surveys with more accurate methods by using a priority system. The 
implementation of the survey review by IVA and resurveying of many drill holes has 
corrected or removed many of the down hole surveys that were previously suspect or 
inadequate. 

Table 10.3 summaries the down hole survey method for the drilling within the Mount 
Dore resource area. There remain some deep drill holes which rely heavily on down 
holes surveys that may be too widely spaced to accurately locate the drill hole 
location at depth. With drilling as deep as 836 m there will always be issues with 
locating drill holes for accurate design purposes. Typically the vein locations are 
redefined by underground drilling and mine development. Down hole survey data and 
methods are considered appropriate for resource evaluation.

10.4 Recoveries and Rock Quality 

QG, 2010 noted that much of the core from the southern section of Mount Dore is 
very broken, with very low Rock Quality Designation (RQD), but the quality of the 
core appears much better in the Merlin Zone. The rock at Merlin and Mount Dore 
North is generally less weathered and more competent, with less shearing and 
faulting than further south, and core recovery is significantly greater as a 
consequence. 

IVA record RQD and other geotechnical information as part of their routine core 
logging. Orientated core is available for some of the drilling that is not vertical and 
where reliable orientations could be obtained. The core is sufficiently broken that only 
some core is orientated.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

This section is unchanged from sections in the Technical Report prepared by Golder 
in October 2010 (Golder, 2010) which were headed "Sampling Method and 
Approach" and "Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security" and are here 
reproduced in their entirety for the convenience of the reader. 

11.1 Methods 

All significant sampling conducted on the Mount Dore Project was done using 
diamond drill core or RC cuttings. IVA drilling at Mount Dore dominates the available 
resource data and has had a total of 329 holes drilled with 290 relevant to the 
Mount Dore resource, of which 131 were diamond core, 119 were diamond core with 
RC precollars and 40 were RC. Two thirds of the IVA drilling is in the Mount Dore 
north area which concentrated on the definition of the Merlin resource at 50 m grid 
spacing and some closer infill at Little Wizard. The IVA drilling at Mount Dore 
includes 36,700 samples of which 35,000 were included in the Mount Dore - Merlin 
resource estimate and the remainder at nearby exploration prospects.  

Many RC precollars commence in the overlying granite that was not sampled if there 
was no visible mineralisation. IVA samples were taken from HQ core (77%), PQ core 
(10%), RC cuttings (12%) and NQ core (1%). Most of the samples were from HQ 
core, which was split along the long axis, and one-half of the core over 2 m intervals 
made up each sample. 

All sampling of diamond drill core and RC cuttings was conducted by IVA personnel 
at IVA's Mount Dore core processing facility several km from the drill sites. Core 
recovery within near-surface oxide zones can be quite poor, but below the oxide 
zone, overall core recovery was excellent, and only few broken zones were 
encountered that could impact accuracy and reliability of results. 

Sample quality and procedures in this section concentrate on the recent IVA work 
which dominates the resource database. Historic drilling procedures and quality 
sampling is poorly documented. IVA is currently indexing a large volume of work 
reports from the old Starra mine which may provide further details for the historic 
drilling and sampling. 

11.2 Procedures 

11.2.1 Sample Dispatches 

Prior to conducting sampling of diamond drill core and RC cuttings, Sample Cut 
Sheets, created by logging geologists or by QAQC technicians, were delivered to 
Core Shed Supervisors. The Sample Cut Sheets were used to guide samplers in 
compiling dispatches for shipping. These sheets are then used to create the Sample 
Shipment Memos (SSMs), which provide a set of instructions for the laboratory. Each 
Sample Dispatch sheet comprises details for 70 routine and QAQC samples and 
corresponds to one bulka bag for shipping purposes. Dispatches were assigned 
numbers that correspond to the first sample in the dispatch and were divided into two 
batches that also were assigned numbers corresponding to the first sample. Each 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 45 

dispatch contained the following samples for which assays were reported on a 
regular basis:  

• 59 routine samples (29 per first batch and 30 per second batch). 

• 4 standard reference materials (2 per batch, randomly inserted at site). 

• 2 field blanks (one per batch, randomly inserted at site). 

• 2 pulp duplicates (one per batch, inserted at laboratory in fixed position). 
• 2 coarsely-crushed duplicates (one per batch, inserted at laboratory in 

fixed position). 

• 1 core duplicate (one in first batch, randomly inserted at site).  

In addition to the above samples, pulp duplicate samples were made-up by the 
laboratory and returned to the work site to be used for independent check sampling.  

All samples were put into cloth or plastic sample bags with numbered tags, and two 
of these bags were placed together into a larger plastic bag that was put into a 
security sealed woven bulka bag for shipping to the laboratory. When sampling of a 
dispatch was completed, Sample Dispatch Sheets and SSMs were given to the 
QAQC Technician who arranged transportation from the core shed to the ALS 
Laboratory. 

Additional quality control measures were implemented during the drilling program: 
reduced usage of cloth sample bags by using plastic bags to eliminate dust 
contamination issues; flushing of all sample preparation equipment after mineralised 
samples; and flagging of high-grade samples.  

11.2.2 Sampling of Diamond Drill Core 

Prior to logging, the following was done: all driller's core metreage markers were 
checked for errors; core was pieced together; recovery was determined for runs 
between markers; metreage lines were drawn across the core and onto box rungs 
where depths were written; a continuous line was drawn along the long axis of the 
core to guide splitting to minimise sampling biases; and photographs were taken of 
all core boxes, with core dry and wet, to facilitate future checking work. After logging, 
the core was cut in half along or beside the cutting lines using a rock saw flushed 
with water, and it was placed back into the core box with the cutting surface oriented 
vertically.  

Individual samples were marked at 2 m intervals down drill holes throughout zones 
that were designated for sampling by logging geologists. Sample numbers were 
written at the start of each sample interval after the metre mark on box rungs on the 
left side of the core as one looks down-hole. The right-hand half of the drill core, as 
one looks down-hole, was collected for assaying, and if a core duplicate was to be 
collected, then it was taken using the left-hand half of the drill core. If core was 
excessively broken, a stainless steel spoon was used to collect one-half of the chips 
along the side.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 46 

11.2.3 Sampling of Reverse Circulation Cuttings 

The cyclone output from one metre intervals was split at the cyclone to obtain an 
eighth (10 to 15%) split subsample, which was placed in cloth bags. Because a 
splitter was not available, for some of the earlier samples, they were bagged in their 
entirety, and then several spear samples were taken from each bag and placed 
together in cloth bags. The cloth bags were allowed to dry; the lumpy portion of the 
cuttings was broken inside the bag; the bag was tossed several times to mix the 
cuttings; and, finally, the bag was weighed. A scoop, comprising about 250 ml, was 
taken from each cloth bag for compositing, and scoops from two consecutive 
intervals were combined for a two metre composite. The composited samples were 
compiled into dispatches as described earlier. 

11.3 Bulk Densities 

Investigation of the bulk density database has revealed more density determination 
methods are present than previously described. Work is ongoing to more fully 
describe the available data.  

The description of the density measurement process undertaken by IVA from 2007 to 
mid 2009 is as follows. 

IVA undertook bulk density determinations (BD) at regular intervals of 5 to 10 m. A 
10 to 20 cm length of core was used, with the selected BD sample halved to allow 
measurement while the rest of the core was sampled and processed. The BD 
determination method used a wax dip approach where the samples are weighed dry 
and during immersion in water to determine their bulk density relative to that of water. 
The BD samples are not generally returned to the original core tray but retained 
separately in a specimen library. A correction is made for the buoyancy and mass of 
the paraffin wax. The method is a high quality approach well accepted and used in 
the industry, but was discontinued in mid-2009 as it was found to be time intensive 
and measured relatively small sticks of core after cutting. QG (2008) reviewed the 
process used at the time and considered the method, scale calibration, reference 
measurements (a piece of basalt in every 10 samples), data handling were all 
suitable, though some improvements could be made. 

The systematic density measurement process was discontinued during mid 2009 due 
to a number of reasons including, safety concerns with the use of hot wax, 
inadequate coverage of the narrow Merlin zones and concerns over the adequacy of 
small specimen measurement for the Merlin mineralisation which varies in sulphide 
content. Trials of different density determination methods were undertaken in late 
2009 and early 2010. From mid 2010 a program of density measurements was 
resumed using a standard water immersion method.

NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 47 

The acQuire database supplied to Golder from IVA contained 10,390 density 
measurements for the area relevant to the Mount Dore resource. The existing data is 
appears to fall into three groups, one of which correlates to the available description 
for the project. These include: 

• 6,645 density values with weight data for dry, waxed and wet measurements. 
These correspond to the standard measurements taken by IVA using the 
described wax method process by IVA for only IVA drilling. The database 
contains weight data that supports the density values, using an assumed wax 
density of 0.8 m/t3 which corresponds to paraffin wax. This wax was changed 
to a different wax with a lower more safe melting temperature which has a 
density closer to 1 m/t3. This yellow wax was sighted by Golder. The change 
over period is currently under investigation so that the calculated density 
values can be corrected. This small correction is not likely to be material to the 
current estimate. 

• 1,507 density values with weight data for wet and dry measurement. These 
appear to correspond to measurements taken in 2008 using a water 
immersion method by IVA for only IVA drilling plus a few older drilling holes. 
There are 31 density values within this set that do not correspond to the 
supporting weight data. The rest are supported by recorded weight 
measurements. The source and description of this data is currently being 
investigated. The data appears to be consistent with the other available data 
and considered suitable for resource evaluation. 

• 2,238 density values with no supporting weight data for only older drilling 
between 1997 and 1994. This data is not documented but is presumably older 
density records that were uploaded to the current database. IVA is currently 
determining the source of this data. It is consistent with the other available 
data and is retained for resource purposes as it covers historic drilling areas.  

Additional density data was provided to Golder separately for recent work and is yet 
to be imported into the acQuire database. This includes two sets of data, including:  

• A trial program of bulk density methods was undertaken in late 2009 by IVA to 
derive a method more suitable for measuring drill core at Merlin, which can 
contain both massive molybdenite and clayey material, see Hillier, 2009. This 
program used several techniques and confirmed the previous waxed 
immersion method was suitable. It also indicated other methods performed 
comparably, including water immersion, direct volume measurement and 
vacuum sealing. This trial program indicated that density derived from 
stoichiometric calculations were generally too high. The trial program included 
multiple subsamples from some Merlin and Little Wizard Mo intercepts from 58 
specimens. These correspond to 30 separate sample intervals. 

• Bulk density data collected in 2010 has used a standard water immersion 
method with data collected for 893 measurements. The measurements were 
obtained for existing core and cover a range of drilling, including pre-IVA 
drilling. 

In 1,687 cases there are multiple density measurements for specimens within the 
same sample interval. Comparison of these density pairs provides a measure of

variability presented in Table 11.1 as the half absolute relative difference (HARD). 
The relatively low HARD values for all the comparisons, indicates reasonable 
precision for each method. There are insufficient comparisons between the four main 
methods or periods of data collection to draw any statistically significant conclusions. 
A plot of all the data comparison in Figure 11.1 indicates generally a tight cluster of 
data around 2.5 t/m3 with no evidence that any particular data sets are significantly 
different.

11.4 Magnetic Susceptibility 

Magnetic susceptibility is measured for each 1 m of drill core. This has previously 
been used to identify the red rock unit in the lower sequence of the Kuridala 
Formation that contains the mineral magnetite. Data entry errors were noted in data 
collected between March 2008 and December 2009. These errors were largely 
corrected but imply some doubt as to the integrity of the data available. 

Nonetheless, magnetic susceptibility values can be grouped into readings that are 
high and low. It can be seen that the area footwall to the molybdenum mineralisation 
has a high magnetic susceptibility signature. The contact is approximately the 
contact between the hangingwall carbonaceous meta-sediment and underlying calc-
silicate, see Figure 11.2. 

11.5 Logging 

Geological logging comprises recording the core size, sampling intervals, the 
lithology zone (lith zone), the dominant lithology (lith1 and lith2), major silicate 
minerals, the dominant alteration and alteration minerals, the opaque minerals in 
order of abundance, brecciation and the nature of clasts and matrix, the oxidation 
horizon and the major geotechnical properties which includes rock strength along 
with the joint breaks and fracture logging. Measurement of vein characters and 
structures is dependent on the availability of the down hole drill / orientation lines. 

Drill hole logging is direct to pocket acQuire on laptops. Validation of lithology, 
mineralisation etc. codes is done upon data entry, and the data is then downloaded 
onto the main server every day, reducing the risk of data loss on the laptops. 

Logging to date has been setup to log a defined lithological sequence. Recent 
petrological work indicates greater influence of magmatic units, magmatic fluids and

alteration being responsible for some if not all of the variations previously noted 
within the Kuridala formation. Relogging and reworking of the logging has been 
commenced and only completed for 100 m spaced sections to date.

11.6 Database Management 

IVA has been using acQuire as the company geological database since 2009.  

Assay data is imported electronically from the laboratory (ALS). Assay priorities are 
assigned by assay method if different methods were used for the same interval. 
"Best" assay is the highest priority. Repeats are not averaged to produce the "best" 
assay; which is good practice. The original two-acid digest used by ALS (OG46) was 
not performing properly leading to a low-bias for the molybdenum and rhenium 
assays by up to 20%. This method was replaced with a four-acid digest method 
(OG62) where Mo values are above 500 ppm. These different methods do not affect 
the copper assays. Further information is provided by Sketchley (2009). 

Down hole surveys have priorities based on method used, but at Mount Dore the 
main method used so far is by electronic single shot. The results of the down hole 
surveys are written onto survey forms by the driller, and entered by hand into the 
database (seven degrees is added to the magnetic azimuth to align the reading with 
the local grid). QG (2010) noted there is potential for transcription errors, but the data 
is also available electronically, so further validation is possible. 

Collar surveys also have priorities commencing with drill hole set-outs by GPS which 
are then superseded when picked up by a contract survey company using differential 
GPS. 

Drill hole logs are generally entered directly into acQuire loggers at the core shed 
allowing the entry forms to perform basic validation during logging.

QAQC data routinely loaded into database with site personnel dedicated to QAQC. 

QG (2009) audited the data base for 7 IVA drill holes (approximately 5% of the 110 
core and RC holes drilled at Merlin) checking the original electronically-supplied 
assays from the laboratory against data in acQuire database. Also the bulk density 
measurements and down hole surveys readings in the database were checked 
against the original worksheets and documents. Comments from this audit indicate 
the database management was acceptable with only minor issues such as assay 
rounding, a few minor transcription errors, a missing correction for magnetic 
declination in one hole and some manual smoothing azimuths for vertical down hole 
surveys and one density calculation error. 

Golder has not audited the database at this stage due to timing issues but considers 
a more formal audit of both new and old drilling data is required in preparation to the 
feasibility study. 

11.7 Adequacy of Sampling 

There were no diamond drilling or core recovery factors that might have resulted in 
sampling biases for samples from competent rocks below the oxide zone. In addition, 
the sampling procedures that were set up and followed for diamond drilling have 
provided samples that adequately represent the whole original drill core. 

However, for RC drilling in incompetent rocks, poor recoveries could affect how 
representative grades are. Although modern RC drilling systems typically use face-
centred bits to eliminate contamination by channelling cuttings back up the centre of 
the drill stem, recoveries are variable and low enough that they could affect the final 
assay results. This is supported by analytical results from twinning of RC and 
diamond drill holes that indicate a significant low bias for the RC drilling samples, 
which is discussed in a later section of this report.  

As there was a tendency to drill more vertical to steeply-inclined holes, recovered 
lengths of some mineralised intersections are greater than the true thicknesses. 
There could be grade biases related to drilling non-orthogonal intersections.  

11.8 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures 

Quality control procedures used by IVA comprise inserting of Standard Reference 
Materials (SRMs), Field Blanks (FBs), and duplicates (DPs) into sample dispatches. 
In addition, the analytical laboratory used internal reference materials and pulp 
replicates. SRMs are used to measure accuracy; FBs, to check for contamination 
and mix-ups; and DPs to monitor precision at several stages of sample preparation.  

SRMs used by IVA for exploration work on the Mount Dore project are either 
commercial standards purchased from Geostats Pty. Ltd. (GSTAT), Ore Research 
and Exploration Pty. Ltd. (OREAS), and CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. (CDN), or 
matrix-matched standards developed by Ore Research and Exploration Pty. Ltd., and 
CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. A total of 20 different SRM types were used for 
2,285 assay determinations, comprising several elements (refer to Table 11.2). The 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED

AMC 111041 : October 2011 51 

SRMs comprise series for oxide copper; sulphide molybdenum; sulphide copper and 
gold; and sulphide molybdenum, rhenium, copper, and gold.

ALS = Internal laboratory SRMs 

As rhenium SRMs are uncommon, initial monitoring of rhenium performance was 
totally reliant upon ALS' use of commercially-purchased SRMs, which comprised two 
types that were used in 943 determinations (refer to Table 11.2). Standard deviation 
data were provided by the manufacturer for the higher value SRM, and the standard 
deviation for the lower value SRM was calculated by ALS using actual data. Several 
major checking programs, encompassing several labs, were completed to ensure 
that rhenium performance was checked independently. 

Tolerance limits for SRMs were set at two and three standard deviations (2SD and 
3SD) from the Round Robin (RR) mean value of the SRM. A single batch failed if any 
of the following criteria were met: a single SRM value was greater than the RR 3SD 
limits; two consecutive SRM values were greater than the RR 2SD limits on the same 
side of the mean; and a FB value was over 0.06 g/t Au, 0.06% Cu, 0.005% Mo, or 
0.2 ppm Re. These limits were used because, if an analytical system were under 
control, there would be only a 1% chance that an SRM would return assays 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 52 

exceeding 3SD, or a 0.625% chance that two SRMs in adjacent batches would 
exceed 2SD on the same side of the mean. In all cases, a barren override can be 
applied for batches deemed to have insignificant values. 

Round robin programs also were conducted on barren material that was obtained 
from fresh, unaltered, non-mineralised rock of the Mount Dore Granite about five 
kilometres to the north. A total of 115 samples were tested by ALS laboratories at 
Mt. Isa, Townsville, and Brisbane, and the material was accepted as a suitable blank 
for monitoring contamination and sample mix-ups. A total of 1,625 field blanks were 
used (refer to Table 11.2). 

11.9 Laboratories 

All routine samples collected for resource estimation were prepared and analysed at 
independent sample preparation and analytical laboratories. No aspects of the 
sample preparation and analytical work conducted at the laboratories were done by 
an employee, officer, director, or associate of IVA.  

Samples were shipped from the work site to the Australian Laboratory Services Pty. 
Ltd. (ALS) facility in Mt. Isa (ALS-MI) where they were prepared, and some base 
metal analytical work was completed. All gold analytical work was conducted by ALS 
at Townsville facility (ALS-TV), and the remaining analytical work was done by ALS 
at Brisbane facility (ALS-BR). 

Check assay samples were sent to Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) in Perth, 
Western Australia, and Ancaster, Ontario, Canada; Genalysis in Perth, Western 
Australia, and Townsville, Queensland; and Becquerel in Mississauga, Ontario, 
Canada. Additional checking work, part of a metallurgical testing program, was 
conducted by Burnie Research Laboratory in Burnie, Tasmania. 

ALS operates in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 under Nata accreditation No. 825; 
Actlabs, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 under Nata accreditation No. 266 and 
SCC accreditation No. 266; Genalysis, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 under 
Nata accreditation No. 3244; and Becquerel, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 
under SCC accreditation No. 422. Burnie has no accreditation.  

11.10 Sample Preparation 

Sample dispatches comprising 70 samples, including quality control samples, were 
delivered to the ALS-MI laboratory for sample preparation. The ALS-MI facility has 
one 23 m3 drying oven; two 200 mm wide jaw crushers (Jacques and Essa); one riffle 
splitter with 18 slots at 23 mm wide and 200 mm long; three Boyd crushers with 
attached rotary splitters; and ten LM2 pulverisers. Occasionally, when ALS-MI has 
become overloaded with samples, they were shipped to ALS-TV for preparation. The 
ALS-TV facility is set up similar to the MI facility and has the following equipment: two 
15 m3 drying oven; two 200 mm wide Jacques jaw crushers; three coarse riffle 
splitters; three Boyd crushers with attached rotary splitters; six LM2 pulverisers; and 
twenty LM5 pulverisers.  



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 53 

All crushing and pulverizing work was conducted at work benches set into a plenum 
ventilation system, which creates a negative pressure to remove dust. Compressed 
air was used for cleaning. When a backlog arose at ALS-MI due to shipping 
difficulties during the rainy season, a small number of samples were sent to ALS-TV 
for sample preparation.  

The following protocol was used for preparing samples: 
• Sorting - All samples are sorted and checked. 

• Weighing - All samples are weighed. 

• Drying - Samples were dried at 100ºC as necessary. 

• Coarse-crushing - Samples were crushed using a 12 mm jaw setting, which 
produces a product of approximately 70% passing 6 mm. This step was 
omitted for samples comprising RC cuttings.  

• Splitting - Samples were ½ split through a 1 cm riffle splitter to obtain 
subsamples weighing approximately 3 to 4 kg. The remaining material was 
archived. 

• Fine-crushing - Splits from coarse-crushed samples were fine-crushed to 90% 
passing 2 mm. Screen tests were initially done at 5 mm and later were 
changed to 4 mm. 

• Splitting - Fine-crushed samples were split to obtain a 1 kg subsample and the 
remaining material was archived. 

• Pulverizing - Splits from fine-crushed samples were pulverised to 90% passing 
75 µm.  

• Subsampling - Three subsamples, weighing about 100 g each, were obtained 
by taking multiple scoops from the pulverised samples and placing into Kraft 
bags. The remaining material was archived.  

• Cleaning - After processing each sample, all equipment was flushed with 
barren material, if a request for mineralised samples was made by a logging 
geologist on the SSMs. If barren flushes were used, crushers were blown out 
only after the flush had gone through, whereas pulverisers were blown out 
before and after the flush. If flushes were not used, all equipment was blown 
out after each sample.  

• Coding - Each sample was assigned an internal ALS bar code, and stickers 
with a code were printed for all sample bags. 

Screen tests were conducted on crushed and pulverised material taken from one 
sample out of each batch of samples. Results were reviewed as part of this report 
compilation, and only a few anomalous crushing results related to schistose material 
were noted. 

11.11 Analyses 

All samples were analysed by ALS for molybdenum, copper, rhenium, and gold using 
assay methods and a multi-element geochemical suite. The key difference between

AMC 111041 : October 2011 54 

the two methods is precision: the assay method uses larger acid volumes and a large 
volumetric finish, whereas the geochemical method uses small volumes. Measuring 
larger volumes leads to a better precision than measuring smaller volumes. All over-
range geochemical samples were re-analysed using assay methods. Primary 
analytical methods comprise Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission 
Spectrometry (ICP-OES), Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-
MS), and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). Analytical work for some samples 
was done at ALS-MI for copper and molybdenum assays and for multi-element 
geochemical suites; at ALS-TV, for gold assays; and at ALS-BR, for some copper 
and molybdenum assays and multi-element geochemical suites. ALS-MI has two 
Varian Vista Pro ICP-AES instruments; ALS-TV, two Varian Spectra 220 AAS 
instruments and one Varian Spectra 240 AAS instrument; and ALS-BR, nine ICP-
AES and four ICP-MS instruments. 

Copper and molybdenum were initially determined by an assay method, using a two-
acid digestion (ALS code OG46). Following internal ALS checking work that was 
conducted at IVA's request to improve assay precision, the procedure was changed 
to an assay method using a four-acid digestion (ALS code OG62). As part of the 
switch in procedures, all molybdenum assays over 0.05% that had been completed 
by OG46 were redone using OG62. Analyses for the multi-element geochemical 
suite were done by two-acid (ALS code ME-ICP41) or four-acid digestions (ALS code 
ME-ICP61). The detection limit for copper was initially 0.01% for the OG46 method, 
but it was later changed to 0.001%; the latter detection limit was carried through for 
the OG62 method. Molybdenum detection limits were 0.001%.  

Rhenium was initially determined by a geochemical method, using a two-acid 
digestion (ALS code ME-MS42). This method was later changed to a geochemical 
method that used a four-acid digestion (ALS code ME-MS61). Since IVA requested 
that assay methods be used for rhenium to improve precision, the method was 
changed to a four-acid digestion under ALS code OG62, and rhenium assays were 
done by this new method. When molybdenum assays over 0.05% that had been 
completed by OG46 were redone by OG62, rhenium was included. The detection 
limit for rhenium was 0.001 ppm for all methods.  

The following procedures were used for copper, molybdenum, and rhenium 
analyses: 

• OG46 - copper and molybdenum assays, using two-acid digestion: 

- 0.4 g sample. 
- 31.25 ml of HCL and 5.75 ml nitric acids. 

- Digested at 115°C for 10 minutes and then at 150°C for 60 minutes. 

- Diluted to 100 ml with distilled H2O. 

- Analysed by ICP-OES / ICP-MS. 

• ME-ICP41 / ME- MS42 - multi-element geochemical analyses, using two-
acid digestion:  

- 0.5 g sample. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 55 

- 3 ml of HCL and 1 ml of Nitric acids. 

- Digested at 115°C for 45 minutes. 

- Diluted to 12.5 ml with distilled water. 

- Analysed by ICP-OES / ICP-MS. 

• OG62 - copper, molybdenum, and rhenium assays, using four-acid 
digestion:  
- 0.5g sample. 

- 2 ml of Nitric, 1 ml of Perchloric, and 2 ml of Hydrofluoric acids. 

- Digested at 185°C for 2½ hours. 

- Leached with 30 ml of 50% HCL to dissolve soluble salts. 

- Diluted to 100 ml with distilled water. 

- Analysed by ICP-OES / ICP-MS. 

• ME-ICP61 - multi-element geochemical analyses, using four-acid 
digestion:  

- 0.5 g sample. 

- 2 ml of Nitric, 1 ml of Perchloric, and 2 ml of Hydrofluoric acids. 

- Digested at 185°C for 2½ hours. 

- Leached with 5 ml of 50% HCL to dissolve soluble salts. 

- Diluted to 12.5 ml with distilled water. 

- Analysed by ICP-OES / ICP-MS. 

Gold was determined by a 30 g fire assay fusion, cupelled to obtain a prill, digested 
with Aqua Regia, and finished by AAS with a detection limit of 0.01 g/t. 

All analytical results were posted by ALS to Webtrieve, a client accessible website. In 
addition, results were reported digitally by email to individual IVA personnel as 
requested in CSV, SO2, and PDF formats. 

11.12 Monitoring 

Digital assay results were imported into an acQuire database, and the laboratory's 
values for SRMs and FBs were compared to the established SRM pass-fail criteria. 
Sample batches that passed were given a Priority 1 status, whereas batches that 
failed were given a Priority 3 status, and the laboratory was asked to re-assay until 
they passed, at which point they were re-assigned a Priority 1 status. Monitoring 
charts that recorded the performance of individual SRMs with respect to RR 
tolerance limits were maintained to monitor performance.

11.12.1 Standard Reference Materials 

All SRMs used by IVA for monitoring copper, molybdenum, and rhenium 
performance had round robin programs completed that provided statistical tolerance 
limits for passing and failing data. Monitoring charts with final SRM assays for more 
than 20 determinations are presented in Figure 11.3 to Figure 11.18. Overall 
performance has been good with only a low number of failures. Copper had an initial 
slightly-high bias that diminished with time; molybdenum was initially biased slightly 
low with failures due to digestion issues that were rectified with a procedural change; 
and rhenium initially had poor precision, but it improved with time. Only a few failures 
remain from batches deemed to be barren.

11.12.2 Field Blanks 

Monitoring charts for copper, molybdenum, and rhenium analyses, using 
Field Blanks (FB), are presented in Figure 11.19 to Figure 11.21. Results show a low 
incidence of contamination and mix-ups for gold and copper; however, some carry-
over issues were noted with molybdenum and rhenium, following extremely high 
grade samples. This issue was investigated in detail, and the cause was found to be 
mineralised rock fragments that were caught up inside a ledge on a coarse jaw 
crusher. Rhenium shows a similar pattern to molybdenum as the two elements are 
strongly associated. The issue was rectified with the laboratory, and all affected 
dispatches were re-assayed. Several samples with elevated molybdenum and 
rhenium values remain, because coarse reject material was unavailable for re-
assaying. The significance of the remaining values was deemed to be negligible 
compared to the grades of surrounding samples.

11.13 Duplicates 

Three types of duplicate samples were collected: field, coarse, and pulp. Field 
duplicates were obtained from drill core or RC cuttings; crush duplicates, from 
crushed samples; and pulp duplicates, from pulverised samples. In addition, lab 
replicate data were provided by ALS. The type and number of duplicate samples 
classified by analytical methods is tabulated in Table 11.3. These data were 
compiled for copper, molybdenum, rhenium, and gold, and statistically analysed by 
scatter (SC), quantile-quantile (QQ), relative difference (RD), Thompson-Howarth 
(TH), and percentile rank (PR) plots. Results are presented only for IVA duplicates 
from samples used mostly for resource modelling: duplicates from core samples 
assayed for molybdenum, copper, and rhenium, using method OG62, and for copper, 
using method OG46.

SC plots compare values on X and Y axes, whereas QQ plots rank values first and 
then compare them. RD plots compare absolute or relative differences between pair 
values and the mean grade of a pair. These statistical plots are used to search for 
biases, which would indicate sampling issues. SC, QQ, and RD plots with descriptive 
statistics for field, crush, and pulp duplicates taken from core samples and assayed 
for copper, molybdenum, and rhenium are shown in Figure 11.22 to Figure 11.33. 
Other than a few obvious sample mix ups, all plots show symmetrical patterns about 
zero, indicating unbiased sampling.  

TH plots show grade on the X axis and precision on the Y axis. Practical detection 
limits occur where the precision is 100%; however, bearing in mind that the precision 
here is really the difference between pair values, 100% precision really means 100% 
variability. Precision levels for TH plots should ideally be better than or close to 15% 
for coarse duplicates and 5% for pulp duplicates-this is because these can be 
controlled by the sub-sampling protocol. Core duplicates precision cannot be 
controlled by the sub-sampling protocol; however, it should ideally be better than or 
close to 30%, but it is not unusual for it to be several tens of percent higher. TH plots 
for field, crush, and pulp duplicates taken from core samples and assayed for copper, 
molybdenum, and rhenium are shown in Figure 11.34 to Figure 11.37. The levels of 
precision are presented in Table 11.4 and are within or close to ideal ranges.

PR plots are chosen at values where the precision begins to decrease dramatically 
as the detection limits are approached. These plots are used to compare precision at

various stages in the sampling and preparation process to ensure that it improves 
with decreasing particle size and that it is within reasonable limits for the style of 
mineralization. Precision levels for PR plots at the 90th percentile should ideally be 
better than 15% for coarse duplicates and 10% for pulp duplicates-this is because 
these can be controlled by the sub-sampling protocol. Although the core duplicates' 
precision cannot be controlled by the sub-sampling protocol, it would ideally be better 
than or close to 30% at the 90th percentile; however, it is not unusual for it to be 
several tens of percent higher. PR plots for field, crush, and pulp duplicates taken 
from core samples and assayed for copper, molybdenum, and rhenium are shown in

11.14 Checking Programs 

11.14.1 Programs 

Nine external assay checking programs were completed for Mount Dore assays, 
including:  

• MD1 - Digestion method checks for copper and molybdenum. 

• MD2 - Metallurgical checks for molybdenum. 

• MD3 - Discovery checks of rhenium. 

• MD4 - Analytical method checks for molybdenum and rhenium. 

• MD5 - Routine checks for copper, molybdenum, rhenium, gold, and zinc. 

• MD6 - Routine checks for copper, molybdenum, rhenium, gold, and zinc. 

• MD7 - Routine checks for copper, molybdenum, rhenium, gold, and zinc. 
• MD8 - Routine checks for copper, molybdenum, rhenium, gold, and zinc. 

• MD9 - High grade ratio checks for rhenium and molybdenum. 

In addition to the assay checking programs, a twinning program for comparing RC 
and diamond drilling samples was conducted to assess variations between the two 
methods of data collection.

11.14.2 Set MD1 - Digestion Checks 

ALS conducted internal checking work to compare copper and molybdenum assays 
that were obtained by the OG46 (two-acid) and the OG62 methods (four-acid). 
Results indicated little difference between the two methods for copper assays  
(refer to Figure 11.42), whereas molybdenum assays showed that OG46 assays can 
be up to 20% lower than the OG62 assays (refer to Figure 11.43). Differences are 
related to higher temperatures used for the OG62 method. The results of this work 
were used to support changes to the analytical protocol and re-assaying of all 
samples that were analysed by OG46 that initially returned over 0.05% molybdenum.

11.14.3 Set MD2 - Metallurgical Checks 

As part of a metallurgical testing program, a total of 16 half-core samples were 
submitted to Burnie Research during February 2009, as part of a metallurgical testing 
program. Analytical test work included X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analyses for 
molybdenum, which were compared to ALS OG62 assays (refer to Figure 11.44). 
Results indicate that the ALS OG62 assays compare quite favourably with the Burnie 
XRF assays. 

11.14.4 Set MD3 - Discovery Checks 

A total of 349 pulp samples were submitted to Actlabs during November 2008, for 
initial checking of rhenium analyses by neutron activation. The results of the rhenium 
validation by neutron activation are shown in Figure 11.45. A linear regression 
analysis using Actlabs analyses as the independent umpire analyses indicates that 
ALS analyses agree well.

11.14.5 Set MD4 - Method Validation Checks 

Following the discovery of the Merlin Zone, a validation program was conducted to 
compare rhenium and molybdenum analyses using different analytical methods. The 
validation work was conducted because IVA was unable to introduce molybdenum 
and rhenium reference materials into the sample stream immediately following the 
Merlin discovery, consequently a gap existed in QAQC monitoring until commercial 
molybdenum standards were purchased and matrix-matched rhenium and 
molybdenum standards were developed. A total of 536 samples, which was originally 
analysed at ALS, were sent to Genalysis, Actlabs, and Becquerel laboratories for 
molybdenum and rhenium analyses. The wet digestion and dry preparation methods 
that laboratories used are as follows: 

• ALS: 
- Molybdenum assays initially done by two acid but later switched to 

four acid. 
- Molybdenum geochemical analyses (four acid). 
- Rhenium assays (four acid). 
- Rhenium geochemical analyses (four acid). 

• Genalysis: 
- Molybdenum assays (four acid). 
- Rhenium assays (four acid). 

• Actlabs: 
- Molybdenum assays (four acid). 
- Rhenium assays (four acid). 
- Rhenium analyses (neutron activation). 

• Becquerel: 
- Rhenium analyses (neutron activation). 

Several statistical comparisons were completed. The primary objective was to 
validate the original rhenium analyses that used a four acid digestion wet assaying 
method with neutron activation analyses using pressed powder pellets. A secondary 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 79 

objective was to validate rhenium and molybdenum assays with four acid digestion 
methods using different laboratories. 

The results of the rhenium validation by neutron activation are shown in  
Figure 11.46. A linear regression analysis using Becquerel and Actlabs analyses as 
the independent umpire analyses indicates that ALS analyses agree well with 
Actlabs, but appear to be biased high compared to Becquerel. 

The results of the rhenium validation by four acid digestion methods are shown in 
Figure 11.47. A linear regression analysis using Genalysis and Actlabs analyses as 
the independent umpire analyses indicates that ALS analyses appear to be slightly 
high.  

The results of the molybdenum validation by four acid digestion methods are shown 
in Figure 11.48. A linear regression analysis using Genalysis and Actlabs analyses 
as the independent umpire analyses indicates that ALS analyses agree well.

11.14.6 Set MD5 - Routine Checks 

IVA operated an ongoing routine checking program that comprised four pulp 
duplicate samples per dispatch of 70 submitted samples, which were taken from 
fixed positions at the laboratory and returned to the work site. A total of 1,729 
samples from the Mt. Elliott, Mount Dore, and Recon projects were sent to Genalysis 
for checking of assays previously completed at ALS. Of these samples, 
approximately 30% were from the Mount Dore project. Samples were compiled 
together, divided into groups of 18, and two QC samples consisting of a SRM and a 
FB were inserted randomly into each group to create batches of 20 samples. SRMs 
were certified for gold and copper, but not for molybdenum and rhenium because this 
was one of the first routine check assay programs conducted that included 
Mount Dore samples. Copper and gold assays were conducted on all samples, and 
samples from Mount Dore were check assayed for molybdenum, rhenium, and zinc. 
When assays were received from the laboratory, IVA's standard quality control 
monitoring criteria were applied, which has been described in a previous section.  

The results of the copper check assaying by Genalysis are shown in Figure 11.49. A 
linear regression analysis using Genalysis as the independent umpire analyses 
indicates that ALS copper analyses are overall biased low. However, the bias is 
grade dependent and appears to be related to Genalysis assays as they are actually 
biased high above 8% and biased low below 8%, which is noted on the QC 
monitoring charts.  

The results of the molybdenum check assaying by Genalysis are shown in  
Figure 11.50. A linear regression analysis using Genalysis as the independent 
umpire analyses indicates that ALS molybdenum analyses are overall biased high. 
However, this bias appears to be related to Genalysis assays as the observation is

11.14.7 Set MD6 - Routine Checks 

A second set of routine check samples from the Mount Dore project was compiled 
using the same procedures as described under Set MD5. A total of 451 samples 
from the Mount Dore, Mt. Elliott, and Recon projects were sent to Genalysis for 
checking of assays that were previously completed at ALS. Approximately 75% of 
the samples were from the Mount Dore Project. Copper, molybdenum, rhenium, gold, 
and zinc check assays were conducted on all samples. 

The results of the copper check assaying by Genalysis are shown in Figure 11.51. A 
linear regression analysis using Genalysis as the independent umpire analyses 
indicates that ALS copper analyses agree well.  

The results of the molybdenum check assaying by Genalysis are shown in  
Figure 11.52. A linear regression analysis using Genalysis as the independent 
umpire analyses indicates that ALS molybdenum analyses appear to be biased high. 
However, this bias appears to be related to Genalysis assays as the observation is 
affected by a small number of higher grade data and is not supported by the Set 
MD2 metallurgical checks and Set MD4 method validation checks, which have more 
data at higher grades. 

The results of the rhenium check assaying by Genalysis are shown in Figure 11.53. 
A linear regression analysis using Genalysis as the independent umpire analyses 
indicates that ALS rhenium analyses agree well. 

11.14.8 Set MD7 - Routine Checks 

A third set of routine check samples from the Mount Dore project was compiled using 
the same procedures as described under Set MD5. A total of 290 samples from the 
Mount Dore project were sent to Genalysis for checking of assays that were 
previously completed at ALS. Copper, molybdenum, rhenium, gold, and zinc check 
assays were conducted on all samples. 

The results of the copper check assaying by Genalysis are shown in Figure 11.54. A 
linear regression analysis using Genalysis as the independent umpire analyses 
indicates that ALS copper analyses agree well.  

The results of the molybdenum check assaying by Genalysis are shown in  
Figure 11.55. A linear regression analysis using Genalysis as the independent 
umpire analyses indicates that ALS molybdenum analyses are overall biased low. 
Considering that the IVA check assay sample submission did not have any SRMs 
above 2000 ppm, which is where biased data are, then the bias could be related to 
Genalysis data.  

The results of the rhenium check assaying by Genalysis are shown in Figure 11.56. 
A linear regression analysis using Genalysis as the independent umpire analyses 
indicates that ALS rhenium analyses agree well.

11.14.10 Set MD9 - High Grade Ratio Checks 

During submission of the routine check assays during drilling of the Merlin Zone, it 
became apparent that higher grade molybdenum and rhenium assays were not being 
checked adequately. In addition, some routine assays showed anomalously high or 
low Mo to Re ratios, which was disconcerting considering the strong association of 
molybdenum and rhenium. In order to address these concerns, a separate high 
grade ratio checking program was initiated. The program comprised 285 samples in 
groups of six to twenty-four, taken from 20 drill holes. The selection was based on 
strings of higher grade molybdenum assays, particularly where anomalous ratios 
were observed. Samples were compiled together, divided into groups of 18, and two 
QC samples, consisting of an SRM and a Field Blank were inserted randomly into 
each group to create batches of 20 samples. All samples were assayed for 
molybdenum, rhenium, copper, gold, and zinc at Genalysis. IVA's standard quality 
control monitoring criteria, described in a previous section, were applied to all 
assays. This particular set of check assays utilised matrix-matched SRMs and 
included an external standard with extremely high molybdenum and rhenium grades.  

The results of the molybdenum check assaying by Genalysis are shown in  
Figure 11.60. A linear regression analysis using Genalysis assays as the 
independent umpire values shows that ALS molybdenum analyses are overall biased 
low. However, this observation is affected by a high bias with Genalysis that was 
noted with matrix-matched SRMs in the 1% to 8% range, which returned values up to 
10% above the round robin mean. There are no matrix-matched SRMs above 8% Mo 
and, although an external SRM at 56% Mo does not show this bias, there are no 
check samples at that grade.  

The results of the rhenium check assaying by Genalysis are shown in Figure 11.61. 
A linear regression analysis using Genalysis assays as the independent umpire 
values shows that ALS rhenium assays agree well.  

The results of the copper check assaying by Genalysis are shown in Figure 11.62. 
Two sets of check assays were provided: one by ICP-OES, and the other by AAS. A 
linear regression analysis using Genalysis assays as the independent umpire values 
shows that ALS copper assays agree well.

11.14.11 Twinning 

Analytical data from RC hole MDQ0153 were compared to those from diamond drill 
hole MDQ0153A to assess variations between the two methods of data collection. 
The two holes were collared 3.3 m apart at the same elevation and drilled at minus

NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 85 

90°. The diamond drill hole is down dip from the RC hole, and lithological contacts 
are calculated to be about 4 m lower in depth; however, grade breaks are at similar 
depths.  

Three correlatable copper zones are present: a thicker upper zone, 36 m wide; and 
two narrower lower zones, 10 and 18 m wide (refer to Table 11.6 and Figure 11.63). 
A thick zone of molybdenum, 30 m wide, underlies the lowermost copper zone (refer 
to Table 11.6 and Figure 11.64). Four sulphur zones correspond to the three copper 
zones and one molybdenum zone, and most zone boundaries are at the same 
depths, except for the upper sulphur zone, which has the lower boundary further up 
hole (refer to Table 11.6 and Figure 11.65).

Diamond Drilling Cu

Figure 11.65 RC Sulphur Versus 
Diamond Drilling Sulphur 

 
 

RC grade profiles are smoother than those from diamond drilling, which is expected 
because of homogenization of chips from larger samples in RC and the actual 
heterogeneity of mineralization from smaller diamond drill core samples. There 
appears to be no down-hole contamination below higher grade zones. Overall 
intercept values from RC are typically lower than those from diamond drilling, except 
for the upper copper zone. RC copper intercepts are 15% to 30% lower than 
diamond drilling; molybdenum, 196% lower; and sulphur, 5% to 66% lower. The large 
differences are probably related to loss of fine copper and molybdenum 
mineralization during RC drilling and sampling.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 87 

The upper copper zone appears to be an exception to the grade comparison pattern 
as RC copper is 42% higher than diamond drilling; however, a closer look at the 
down-hole grade profiles for this zone indicates that several RC copper spikes 
correlate to diamond drilling copper troughs, which has skewed the intercept 
comparison. When these spikes/troughs are removed, the RC copper intercept drops 
to 15% below the diamond drilling intercept, similar to the other copper zones. 

The RC copper spikes occur in two groups, comprising three samples each. The 
lower group correlates to a thin siltstone - phyllite unit that is characterised by non-
sulphide copper minerals, based on core logging-this is supported by lower sulphur 
analyses. As the upper group does not have a separately-logged interval, no direct 
comments can be made about lithological associations. However, it is interesting to 
note that the upper group has a sulphur spike in the diamond drilling analyses, 
suggesting the presence of secondary sulphates such as jarosite or gypsum rather 
than pyrite, which is less likely to be present in strongly oxidised rocks. 

The effect of extreme values on intercept comparisons between the two drilling 
methods was investigated further by removing from the calculation pairs of data with 
large differences. After approximately 25% of values were removed, RC intercept 
values were still typically lower than those from diamond drilling, although not as 
extreme. RC copper intercepts were 20% to 305% lower than diamond drilling; 
molybdenum, 95% lower; and sulphur, 0% to 66% lower.  

Although modern RC drilling systems typically use face-centred bits to eliminate 
contamination by channelling cuttings back up the centre of the drill stem, recoveries 
are still low enough that they could affect the final assay results. The twinning 
comparison of RC and diamond drilling indicates that significant low biases in RC 
analytical results mean that care should be exercised if RC is to be used as a tool for 
obtaining analytical data for resource modelling. 

11.14.12 Security and Chain of Custody 

All bulk bags for shipping samples were sealed with individually numbered tamper-
proof security tags and transported by IVA vehicle to the ALS Laboratory in Mt. Isa. 
SSMs, corresponding to the shipment dispatches, were sent electronically to the 
laboratory; shipments were examined upon arrival at the laboratory; and the SSMs 
were returned back to IVA, marked with a confirmation of the state of the security 
seals on boxes, the presence of all samples comprising each batch, and laboratory 
report numbers assigned to each batch. Following completion of assaying, samples 
were stored at the laboratory and then transported back to the work site by IVA 
vehicle for long-term storage.  

11.15 Adequacy of Sample Preparation, Analytical, and Security Procedures 

The sample preparation, analytical, and security procedures were adequate to 
ensure high quality drill-hole assay data acceptable for geological modelling and 
reliable resource estimation. There is an unbroken chain of custody from the site to 
the analytical laboratory; sufficient reference materials have been used to control 
analytical processes; appropriate analytical procedures were used that take rock

NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 88 

matrices into account and provide acceptable levels of precision; and sufficient 
checking work has been done to demonstrate that the data are unbiased. 

Data were imported into the database via automated processes that have essentially 
eliminated transcription issues. Record duplication issues do arise when querying the 
database to obtain data sets for statistical analyses and plotting-these issues are 
covered by manual checking of exports in spreadsheets through comparison of data 
and conditional statements. Since the database has some built in quality control 
plotting routines; a mixture of manual and only limited automated routines was used 
for compiling and plotting. The manual portion of the work is required to maintain an 
ongoing working data verification process. There are no limitations to the verification 
process.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in 
October 2010 (Golder, 2010) and is here reproduced in its entirety for the 
convenience of the reader. 

IVA has applied modern drilling, sampling and surveying methods to derive the data 
used as the basis for the current resource estimate. Golder has reviewed the data 
and considers it suitable for resource estimation purposes. 

Previous independent verification of the mineral resources is available as: 

• IVA drilling and resource estimates have achieved similar copper grades and 
volumes to those defined by previous workers at the Mount Dore South 
copper resource; see Table 2, Golder 2010, for a listing of previous results. 

• QG (2010) reviewed eight holes and confirmed that the range of grades 
observed in the assay log correlated well with the observed abundance of 
MoS. In particular high grade >1% Mo correlated with Mo breccia in the core.  

• QG (2010) undertook some database validation for the previous  
NI43-101 report, including an audit of 5% of the Merlin drilling, which 
highlighted some minor issues that were resolved at the time.  

Other reviews include the following: 

• The majority shareholder IVN (Ivanhoe Mines) regularly reviews the 
operations of IVA for procedures, laboratory and QAQC, see Sketchley 
(2008abc, 2009, 2010abc). These reviews are completed every 6 months and 
provide a high level of technical assistance to the site geologists as well as a 
regular review of processes and procedures. IVA has demonstrated a resolve 
to address the concerns previously raised and to improve its practises.  

• IVA undertakes extensive QAQC work amounting to 23% of all assay results. 
This proportion is above typical industry practise and demonstrates a 
commitment to quality. 

• IVA demonstrates a commitment to sample security in its sample dispatch 
processes.  

• IVA reviewed all surface and down hole survey work, IVA (2010). Following 
previous reviews IVA committed to resurveying all collars and many down hole 
surveys. 

• Where possible collar surveys and tenement locations are located by an 
independent surveyor. 

• Poorly defined or unusual down hole surveys have been resurveyed using 
more thorough gyroscopic methods to remove survey uncertainty in most 
cases. This remains an area of constant review and reassessment due to the 
length of some of the deeper drilling. 

• In 2009 the drilling data were migrated to acQuire database. This provides on 
entry data validation and improves the data integrity and capture processes. 
The process of the migration included a review of the database and inclusion 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 90 

of meta-data required. IVA has been progressing through the issues raised 
during the migration addressing some issues. 

Golder reviewed the procedures and processes available while on site which 
included drilling, sampling, logging, standard down hole survey, database and 
interpretation processes. Due to timing of the site visit Golder did not observe density 
measurement or other periodic process such as survey and gyroscopic down hole 
survey processes, but understand the processes used and believe they are suitable. 

Golder completed the following verification and audit processes: 

• Golder (2010) reviewed a complete drill section and observed significant 
sections of massive molybdenite mineralisation where high grade Mo assays 
were present. These observations confirm the general tenor of the Mo 
mineralisation indicated. 

• ALS provided 642 batches of assays with over 44,000 assay records covering 
Mount Dore drilling from November 2007 to August 2010. The assay data were 
provided directly by ALS without possible interference from IVA. These were 
compiled into assays for each sample and method for 32,140 samples relevant 
to the Mount Dore resource estimate (excluding samples for QAQC and 
surrounding exploration). Preferred assays for Au, Ag, Cu, Co, Mo, Re, Zn, Pb, 
S and Fe were compiled from the different assay methods using Golders' 
independent assumption of the preferred precedence of analysis methods. The 
data were then compared directly to the assay data provided by IVA and used 
for the resource estimate. The results indicated a very low proportion of 
discrepancies which highlighted only a few areas for further validation and 
correction. Most differences related to the preferred assay method for low grade 
samples which is not material to the resource estimate. Significant 
discrepancies equating to the cut-off grade for resource reporting included 1 
sample for Re, 3 samples for Mo, 2 samples for Au, 1 sample for Zn, 0 samples 
for Cu and do differences at all for Ag, Co, Pb, Fe, S. 

• 12 pages of hardcopy assay certificates (~360 assay) from pre IVA drilling were 
validated against the drill database. This represents 3% of the pre IVA drilling 
data and is limited to a sample of the available certificates. No issues were 
determined except for rounding of Cu analyses to 3 decimal places which is not 
material to the resource estimate. IVA is currently indexing several thousand 
documents from the now closed Starra mine. This may provide access to more 
historic work and allow a more systematic audit of the historic data.  

• 20 pages of hardcopy assay certificates (~800 assay) from early 2004 IVA 
drilling were validated against the drill database. This data was assayed by 
SGS a different laboratory to that subsequently used by IVA for all analyses. 
This represents one quarter of the early IVA drilling data. Comparison of a 
regular 10% sample of the data indicated correct data entry for all Au and 
sequential Cu analyses. Very similar values were recorded for most total Cu 
analyses, indicating reanalysis of Cu at ALS for these samples. IVA undertook 
this reanalysis due to issues with the Cu analyses at SGS and the desire to 
analyse for additional elements including Mo, Re, Co, Ag, Zn, Pb, S and Fe. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 91 

This reanalysis was confirmed and demonstrated by IVA explaining all the 
differences noted.  

• Lodewyk Surveyors provided point survey data directly to Golder without 
possible interference from IVA. The data were compiled and compared directly 
to the collar data provided by IVA and used for the resource estimate. Of the 
322 collar records that could be matched. Golder noted 18 discrepancies which 
were all attributed to either multiple surveys or 1 mm differences attributable to 
rounding error. Two remaining drill hole errors of 2 m are related the mix-up of 
the collars on one drill site resolved later during resurveying of the down hole 
orientation. This comparison of the collars verifies the location of the majority of 
drilling data and confirms the collar locations as inspected by an independent 
licence surveyor. 

• Golder independently surveyed some collars during the site visit with a hand 
help Garmin GPS60csx. The comparison of the collar surveys to the GPS 
coordinates and track log confirmed the location of the prospect and layout of 
the project drilling, concentrating on the northern area relevant to Merlin. 

• Golder compiled 1089 results from the detailed gyroscopic down hole surveys 
from 21 drill holes. These were completed by IVA in 2009 and by Surtron 
Technologies Pty Ltd in 2010. Some filtered values were confirmed as 
erroneous data correctly removed.  

• 129 pages of hardcopy density measurement worksheets were reviewed that 
cover measurements between 3/2009 and 9/2009. 1 in 10 were selected and 
checked against the data used in the resource estimate. The records supported 
the density values calculated. 5 data entry errors from 309 indicate a low data 
entry error rate with all errors discovered being minor and insignificant to the 
use of the data. Some significant blocks of data were identified as requiring data 
entry. The incomplete entry of data is an ongoing area IVA needs to address on 
all of their projects. This should not affect the resource evaluation as there is a 
sizable database of existing data which indicates low variability in the density 
values at Mount Dore. Golder calculated all density values independently and 
did not use any density values that did not have supporting measured weights.  

Additional comments include: 

• A full review of the older historical drill data is not yet complete. Some assay 
values were verified. IVA is currently indexing a large quantity of historic reports 
from the closed Starra mine where additional supporting documents for the 
older drilling should be located for future use. Note that the older drilling does 
not contribute to the Merlin Mo-Re resource and only significant contributes to 
the Mount Dore south Cu resource.  

• Though there are no independent density samples available, the values 
supplied by IVA are typical for those expected for the type rocks which have a 
low observed porosity and high silica content. The values indicate little 
variability in dry bulk density and are similar to surrounding properties that 
Golder has worked on. A variety of density measurement methods have been 
used resulting in comparable results.

Golder considers the drilling data base, its collation using specialised third party 
database software and the processes meets industry standard practises. The 
resource drilling data is suitably supported and maintained for resource estimation 
purposes.  

Ongoing work should include: 

• Detailed review of the acQuire database structure (now in progress). 
• Physical database audit of both the oldest drilling (pre 2007) as further records 

are discovered and indexed. 

• Selected independent bulk density samples.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Metallurgical Testwork 

Preliminary metallurgical testwork was carried out by Burnie Research Laboratories 
(AMMTEC 2009) to determine crushing, grinding and flotation characteristics, and 
with sighter tests for ferric leaching, roasting and calcine leaching to determine metal 
deportment though the process. This work was referenced in the SRK NI 43-101 
report (SRK 2010). No further work on crushing and grinding was undertaken for the 
PFS. 

Metallurgical testwork on fresh samples were carried out by Metcon Research 
(Metcon, 2011, three reports) to refine the flotation plant flowsheet. The testwork 
results were interpreted by EHP Consulting, Inc. and incorporated into the process 
design criteria used for the PFS (EHP Consulting, 2009). 

Samples of Molybdenum Rougher Flotation Tails were prepared by KD Engineering 
and Metcon and shipped to Pocock Industrial Inc (Pocock) in slurry form for solids 
liquid separation (SLS) testing in late December 2010. Pocock is located in Salt Lake 
City, Utah. 

The SLS testwork was reported in Pocock (2011). EHP and Jacobs reviewed 
available information for concentrate treatment plants and their recommendations 
were incorporated into the design criteria for the concentrate treatment plant. 

13.2 Summary of Testwork 

The samples were selected to ensure coverage over the depth and strike length of 
the deposit. In addition all lithologies and mineralisation styles were covered. In all 
approximately 1.1 tonnes of material was sent to Metcon. 

Metcon testing was subdivided into three phases: 

• Phase I focused on optimising conventional flotation conditions and running 
locked cycle testing on a composite representative of the entire ore body. The 
primary goal was to evaluate the potential of eliminating the ferric chloride 
leach and post roast leach from the flowsheet using conventional molybdenum 
flotation techniques. 

The test work indicated the ferric chloride leach could be eliminated, but the 
molybdenum concentrate grade could not be upgraded above 35-40% 
molybdenum using conventional techniques. A post roast leach would be 
required. The primary contaminants were gangue and carbon. All indications 
were that the gangue reporting to the concentrate was associated with the 
carbon. 

• Phase II expanded the test-work to non-conventional techniques for 
concentrate grade improvement; the evaluation of higher grade copper 
composites to test the robustness of copper depression; and the potential of 
producing a saleable grade by-product copper concentrate. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 94 

No technique was found to improve the molybdenum concentrate grade above 
the 35 to 40% molybdenum range. The testing showed that a three stage 
copper depression circuit eliminates the need for a ferric chloride leach even 
with high copper content ores. A flowsheet incorporating a regrind can be used 
to produce a saleable grade by-product copper concentrate. The copper 
concentrate contains 3 to 5 g/t gold and 70 to 90 g/t silver. 

• Phase III looked at 18 variability samples and an initial evaluation of roasting 
requirements. 

In nine of the variability samples, saleable grade molybdenum concentrate was 
produced. The culprit responsible for concentrate downgrading was identified 
as graphite. The distribution of molybdenum to throwaway tail streams 
averaged 5 to 7%. The distribution of molybdenum to recycled tail streams 
averaged 10 to 15%. Accounting for recovery from the recycle streams, Metcon 
anticipates overall molybdenum recoveries of 90%.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in 
October 2010 (Golder, 2010) and is here reproduced in its entirety for the 
convenience of the reader. 

14.1 Resource Domains 

Geological domains are used to distinguish and divide areas of different 
mineralisation style or statistical nature. Domains attempt to create zones of 
statistical stationarity where structure and controls are constant. When achieved the 
domains are then suitable for statistical and geostatistical analysis and for estimation. 

14.2 Grade Domains 

Initial analysis by QG (2008) for the copper mineralisation at Mount Dore South 
resulted in the simple approach of domaining based on geological units, oxidation 
profile and economic copper cut off. Domaining became more complicated with the 
discovery of the Merlin Mo-Re resource and the evaluation of the Mount Dore North 
mineralisation.  

Mount Dore North is more complicated due to overlapping Cu-Mo-Zn zones, 
including: 

• Mo-Re mineralisation at Merlin generally lies just below the carbonaceous 
metasediments at the contact with silicified calc-silicate rocks, locally identified 
by the limit of red rock (haematite +/- K feldspar) alteration; 

• Relatively little copper mineralisation has been intersected in the upper 
sequence of the carbonaceous metasediments whereas at depth copper 
becomes more prevalent and overlaps with the Mo mineralisation while also 
extending into the hanging wall of the Mo mineralisation; 

• Zn mineralisation becomes more prevalent towards the north. This is 
particularly the case for the upper copper mineralisation (above Merlin) at 
Mount Dore North where the Zn is apparently leached from most of the oxide 
zone but occurs as a broader domain than Cu, both overlapping with and 
linking the two main upper Cu mineralisation lenses; 

• Zn mineralisation also occurs in the more distal hanging wall extensions to the 
lower Cu mineralisation. Again overlapping with the Cu (and Mo) lenses and 
extending both above and further into the hanging wall.  

Finally, Mount Dore north and south areas contrast markedly in oxidation depth. The 
southern area is deeply weathered with the fresh zone poorly defined or tested. 
Occasional Zn in the fresh zone of the south indicates that Zn domains may persist 
to some extent. The northern areas has a shallower oxide and transition zones as 
well as deeper drilling that targeted the depth extent of the Merlin mineralisation, 
allowing the Mo and Zn zones to be well defined.  

Towards the north a depletion zone for Cu is evident near surface whereas Cu 
extents to surface in the southern and south-western most areas.

Previous work by QG (2009) at Mount Dore North identified domains based on 
geology, oxidation and mineralisation cut-offs including: 

• >0.5% Mo for high grade Mo at Merlin. 

• >0.01% Mo for anomalous Mo around and mostly below Merlin. 

• >0.25% Cu for potentially economic copper mineralisation. 

• >0.25% Zn for anomalous Zn mineralisation. 

This required the use of multiple partially overlapping mineralisation domains to flag, 
assess and estimate different elements. This represented the first pass in 
understanding and domaining the Mount Dore resource. Golder undertook geological 
review and statistical analysis that confirmed the statistical basis for the original 
domains.  

Golder reviewed the domaining process by first reassessing the Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) used to assist QG in its original domaining. The original work by QG 
(2009) identified four principal element groupings, including: 

• Mo-Re-S. 

• Cu-Ag-Au-Co. 

• Pb-Zn. 

• Fe. 

Golder undertook a global PCA analysis for all samples from the Kuridala formation, 
including both mineralisation and background samples. This was used to assist 
domaining and determine grade relationships. 

Review of cross sections indicates that there is some correlation between some 
elements in some areas which are not evident elsewhere. For example the high Mo 
grade Merlin domain does contain Cu in places and can display some correlation of 
high Cu grades with higher Mo grade that would suggest a relationship which is not 
present when there is no Mo mineralisation (away from Merlin). This conclusion is 
further supported by the analysis of correlation statistics which indicate weak 
correlation between some elements across the element groups defined by QG for 
some domain subsets.  

There is sufficient evidence both from the PCA and geological review that separate 
estimation of the four main element groups is not warranted as it runs the risk of 
removing local correlations between elements from different groups i.e. it decouples 
the estimation of elements that may still have local correlation. The most significant 
risk is in the narrow high grade Mo domain where previous estimation of other 
elements and density using broader shapes could significantly dilute and smooth the 
other elements compared to Mo and Re. 

Golder adapted the domaining process to produce a set of interpretations that were 
largely concentric and able to define a domain on precedence. The changes to the 
interpretation included: 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 97 

• Addition of the carbonaceous meta-sediment footwall. This boundary appears 
to be the structural location for much of the high grade Mo mineralisation. Its 
interpretation allows better control and understating of the high grade Mo 
zones. 

• The Cu cut-off was retained at 0.25% Cu to define the core Cu zone but 
relaxed to include contiguous grade down to 0.1% Cu. This relaxation 
improved the interpretability of the Cu domains after infill drilling made some 
zones difficult to follow at a rigorous 0.25% Cu cut-off.  

• The previous Zn domain cut-off did not consider any economic factors or the 
occurrence of other potentially economic elements such as Pb, Au, Ag and 
Co. The domain was found to largely include the Cu mineralisation below the 
oxide zone with correlation between Zn and Cu evident in the Cu domain 
though Zn extended beyond the Cu. The interpretation of the Zn domain was 
revised using a Cu equivalent (ECu) grade using the same approach and cut-
off as used for Cu. This allowed the interpretation of a concentric zone 
surrounding the Cu domain and including interstitial or additional areas mostly 
on the basis of the additional value potential from Zn, though considering all 
other elements. 

• Retention of the Mo domains using 0.01% Mo and 0.5% Mo cut-offs. 

14.3 Mo Domaining (MODOM) 

Domaining based on Mo grade is based on two cut-offs at 0.01% Mo and ~0.5% Mo 
to define background, medium and high grade domains. 

The high grade domain is defined by a significant grade contrast and the narrow 
continuous structural location and is referred to as the Merlin resource. It comprises 
narrow zones of massive molybdenite carrying high grade Mo and Re grades either 
as a single narrow zone or a closely spaced cluster of narrower intercepts. 

The Merlin mineralisation consists of a distinct molybdenite rich narrow breccia zone 
with grades typically >10% Mo over short intervals. The regular 2 m core sampling 
that was adopted for Cu mineralisation and used throughout the Merlin drilling 
campaign up until 2010, has resulted in non selective sampling and produced a 
range of Mo grades from the typical rich intercepts to more moderate grades in 2 m 
samples. This has contributed to considerable edge dilution and the smoothing of the 
grade distribution. Despite this dilution the Merlin resource is sufficiently high grade 
that a cut-off 0.5% Mo offers excellent discrimination of the high grade Mo zone into 
four defined narrow structural domains that display sufficient continuity to warrant 
separate consideration. 

The definition of the Merlin structural domains effectively accounts for all high Mo 
and Re grades from the remaining material, minimising any chance of smearing or 
overestimating Mo and Re in lower grade areas. The narrow structural domains offer 
a potential target as for narrow selective mining options. 

Re displays a close relationship with Mo and its occurrence and maximum 
concentration is intimately related to molybdenite occurrence and hence Mo grade.

The segregation of the very high grade Mo and Re samples is well justified to 
improve the volume - grade estimates. A very good correlation exists indicating an 
intimate association of the two metals, see Figure 14.1.The "dirty" molybdenite is the 
Re host however the intimate relationship with "clean" molybdenite does not offer a 
potential for physical separation of the two phases during milling (refer to Figure 
14.2).

Molybdenite (Kirby 2009) 

 

The Merlin deposit extends north of 7,605,050 mN. A small high grade extension 
known as Little Wizard at around 7,605,000 mN is the southern and upper most 
extension of the Merlin structure. It represents a small higher grade domain that is 
treated separately due to its potential economic influence on the project and the 
bonanza grades present. The main Merlin domain defined displays a distinct spatial 
relationship with the base of the logged carbonaceous meta-sediment, within the 
Kuridala Formation. At depth this zone appears to split into several structural 
domains, some follow the base of the carbonaceous meta - sediment and others 
extend in to the hanging wall mineralisation, where additional Cu and Zn 
mineralisation becomes more prevalent. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 99 

The medium Mo grade domain forms a broad zone, largely including and 
surrounding the high grade Mo domain, though it is situated predominantly below 
and only extending a few meters above the high grade Mo domain into the hanging 
wall. It comprises disseminations or stylolitic veinlets and disseminations that are 
small and lower grade than the Merlin domains. To define a domain for the medium 
Mo grade significant interburden is included to enable all anomalous Mo and Re 
grades to be included in the domain and limit any potential smoothing of grades 
beyond the limited extent on Mo mineralisation. There is a smaller zone of 
anomalous Mo mineralisation in the hanging wall Cu mineralisation package (just 
below the granite contact) that is identified in a few drill holes. Both the grade and 
occurrence of this mineralisation is not significant and it has not been modelled 
separately. 

The statistical basis for domaining the high grade Mo zone that is the Merlin deposit 
is well founded at a cut-off of around 0.5% Mo on the basis of the distribution of 
grades, see Figure 14.3. Note that the histogram bin size changes to allow all the 
data to be plotted as the high grade tail is very long.  

Figure 14.3 Mo & Re Grade Distribution from all Samples 

 
Source: Golder 2010 

Mo is generally situated below the oxide weathering surface and generally displays 
little effective change across the weathering boundaries. Molybdenite appears to 
remain unoxidised in near surface high grade areas such is Little Wizard and there is 
no expected loss of recovery due to oxidation that would warrant metallurgical 
domaining. 

Figure 14.4 displays the log-probability plots for all samples based on the Mo 
domaining and basic geology. In this figure the three Merlin high grade Mo domains 
are combined (MO_345) but separated from the higher grade Little Wizard domain 
(MO_6) and the medium grade domains (MO_12). There is good separation of the 
distributions indicating effective domaining. Furthermore separation of the 
background mineralisation based on geology is also warranted. 

Note the change in slope of the log probability plots between the high and medium 
grade Mo domains is a further indication of the change in grade distribution between 
the two styles of Mo occurrence.

14.4 Cu Domaining (CUDOM) 

Domaining for copper remains the same as previously establish by QG (2009 and 
2010) and is based on a 0.25% Cu cut-off. This cut-off is supported by the grade 
distribution displayed in Figure 14.5 where there is an inflection in the grade profile at 
around 0.2% Cu. At this cut-off interpretable domains can be defined that have 
significant continuity. At Mount Dore South this includes a single wide shallow 
dipping zone within predominantly oxidised or partial oxidised material. At 
Mount Dore North defined narrow zones are evident with zones of lower grade or 
interburden. In total 6 Cu mineralisation structures can be defined with three in the 
upper mineralisation package and three in the lower mineralisation package. The two 
packages are separated by a wide zone of largely barren material. Though 
occasionally the Zn mineralisation will close this gap the copper remains fairly distinct 
as two defined packages.

For the upper mineralisation package the upper two Cu domains occur consistently 
throughout the Mount Dore North area, whereas the low third domain only occurs on 
a few sections and has some continuity issues that are yet to be resolved 
adequately. 

The uppermost Cu domain in the lower package is, at times the same as the Mo 
domain but elsewhere the Cu mineralisation appears to separate and follow its own 
path. This indicates separate mineralisation event that in places follow the same 
structural feeder. The lowermost two Cu zones are relatively small and are not 
interpreted or domained separately as they are adequately defined by the Mo 
mineralisation shapes. 

The 0.25% Cu cut-off was relaxed to allow the inclusion of contiguous mineralised 
samples down to a lower cut-off of 0.15% Cu. This improved the interpretability of the 
domain structures which becomes more difficult as infill drilling progresses. This 
process also includes some edge dilution softening the hard domain boundary 
approach used for estimation. 

14.5 Polymetallic Domaining (P_DOM) 

Previous estimates have domained Zn separate to Cu and Mo and there are good 
indications that Zn mineralisation is different in many respects, including: 

• Zn and Pb are partially leached in the oxide and transition zones resulting in 
lower grades near surface. 

• Zn and Pb are significant at Mount Dore North but the mineralisation appears 
to become progressively weaker south of 7,605,000 mN and into Mount Dore 
South. 

• In the upper mineralisation package at Mount Dore North Zn occurs with the 
Cu mineralisation but also in and around the Cu domains linking them together 
into a broad zone of mineralisation and helping to define the upper package as 
one zone. 

• In the lower mineralisation package at Mount Dore North Zn occurs mainly 
down dip in and around the Cu which also appears to get stronger down dip. 
Zn rarely occurs in any significant amount towards surface and the dip trend is 
stronger than Cu and appears in places to persist beyond the Cu 
mineralisation, particularly into the hanging wall. 

Initial Zn was domained on the same basis as previously undertaken by QG (2009), 
based on a 0.25% Zn cut-off, see Figure 14.6. This approach is justified but becomes 
very complicated when considering the overlap between the other domains for Cu, 
high grade Mo and low grade Mo shapes.

This complicated approach of overlapping domains which resulted in inevitable 
inconsistencies in interpreted structure and over domaining of the resource with 
inherent difficulties in validating the estimation results. To resolve the complexity the 
low grade Mo domain and Zn domains were replaced with a single polymetallic 
domain to capture outer areas that have potentially economic value from other 
elements. This used a Cu equivalent grade calculation to create an outer shell that 
encompassed all the areas of potential value, in most cases these are dominated by 
the occurrence of Zn in the Mount Dore North upper and Mount Dore North lower 
(down dip) and Mo for Mount Dore North lower (middle to up dip). 

Copper equivalence was calculated using the available recovery and price 
assumptions from an early draft of Merlin scoping study (SRK, 2010) and is 
summarised in Table 14.1. Note that final public version of the SRK study had 
revised prices that are not reflected in Table 14.1 or the geological interpretations. 
This is not considered significant as the prices used reflect the general comparative 
value and are suitable for geological domaining. The conversion factors are rounded 
to one or two significant places to provide general factors commensurate to the level 
of study. These factors may require revision as the metallurgical results, processing 
options and prices are refined, but are suitable for low grade geological domaining as 
used here.

relogging program was undertaken in mid 2010 to resolve the inconsistencies and 
bring all drill holes up to the same standard of coding. 

Geological domaining was undertaken by IVA site geologist and is based on 100 m 
spaced sections logged to date. The interpretations are not snapped to drill holes 
since not all drilling has been relogged and the geological boundaries are not critical 
to the mineralisation interpretations. 

Structural modelling is ongoing but the current interpretation includes some faulting 
to account for the larger offsets noted during the relogging. 

14.7 Weathering Domains (MINL) 

Previously logging of oxidation has used a mixture sulphide mineral occurrence and 
material characteristics and has changed slightly over time as the Mount Dore project 
has progressed and numerous geologists have undertaken logging. 

In 2010 IVA undertook a relogging program to provide a more standardised basis for 
the definition of the oxidation profile based on physical characteristics, without the 
partial integration of assumed leaching characteristics. The logging has been 
completed on 100 m sections and focused on the definition of two surfaces to define 
the three principal weathering types, defining the MINL domains. These surfaces 
include: 

• Base of complete oxidation (BOCO). This is the contact between completely & 
partially oxidised material types based on degree of degradation of the core, 
conversion of feldspars to clay and internal limonitic dissemination throughout 
the core.  

• Base of partial oxidation (BOPO). This is the contact between partially 
oxidised and fresh material types and is based on the amount of oxidation on 
joint and fracture planes, presence of clays on fractures and presence or 
absence of calcite or vughs throughout the core. 

The oxidation surface models are relatively approximate as they are only compiled 
on 100 m sections, there is some intermixing of materials locally, oxidation logging 
includes some subjective decisions and there is sufficient faulting and other variation 
to complicate the simple surface model. 

14.8 Metallurgical Domains (METDOM) 

Golder previously reviewed the copper sequential analyses (Golder, 2010) where a 
ternary plot of the three assayed copper components defines four distinct zones of 
different mineralogy. Figure 14.7 reproduces the ternary diagram of the three 
sequential copper assay components Cu_SOL (Cu in acid), Cu_CN (Cu in Cyanide) 
and Cu_Res (Cu in residual material). The four populations defined include: 

• Insoluble minerals (bottom right red), representing relatively insoluble copper 
as possibly Cu-phosphate, Mn wads, native copper or tied up in clays 
(possibly kaolinite & illite). 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 104 

• Highly acid soluble minerals (top red), representing copper oxide, carbonates 
and silicate. 

• Highly cyanide soluble minerals (bottom left blue), representing copper 
supergene minerals such as chalcocite. 

• Insoluble minerals (bottom right blue), representing primary copper minerals 
such as chalcopyrite and bornite.  

These grouping were classified and cross sectional interpretations completed to 
indentify the four groups as sequential zones. Figure 14.7 displays the samples 
colour coded for the four domains interpreted and provides a reasonable definition of 
the zone given some intermixing is inevitable. 

Figure 14.7 Sequential Cu Ternary Diagram Colour Coded on Existing Initial 
Reinterpretation Based on Sequential Copper 

 

During the relogging completed by IVA in 2010, on 100 m spaced cross sections, the 
base of predominantly leachable copper was also interpreted. This was primarily 
interpreted from the dominance of the sulphide copper minerals and the review of 
sequential copper assays where present. It is noted that this interpretation lies below 
the lowermost surface defined from the ternary diagram, presumably because a 
lower effective cut-off for the residual copper has been applied. Since the IVA 
interpretation includes an assessment of the logged mineralogy that persists beyond 
the available copper sequential analyses this surface has been used to assist the 
lateral extension of the copper sequential domains. 

Together these surfaces define five domains available; to assist metallurgical 
assessment of the copper leachability. There are insufficient copper sequential 
analyses across the entire resource to allow effective estimation of the leachable 
copper components. Table 14.2 presents the average copper sequential analyses for 
each of the metallurgical domains for all available samples and also only those inside 
the copper resource domains in Table 14.3. 

The copper sequential assays report slightly lower total results than the original 
sample; but are within expected error margins for the assay method. The result 
indicate reasonable zonation is achieved with:

14.9 Domain Definitions 

The definition of the codes and associated wireframe models for each individual 
domain is defined in Table 14.4. 

14.10 Combined Domains (DOM) 

Although each domain for Cu, Mo and polymetallic mineralisation are defined and 
flagged separately these are combined for estimation and analysis purposes using 
an order of precedence that includes: 

• MODOM: Mo domains take precedence followed by. 
• CUDOM: Cu domains then. 

• P_DOM: polymetallic domains.

NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 106 

Since the polymetallic domains are defined by a copper equivalent cut-off they 
provide outer shells that encapsulate much of the copper domains. The wireframe 
ignored areas adequately modelled by the copper domains and targeted only 
significant areas where additional value is provided by other elements, most notably 
Mo or Zn.  

The precedence of the Mo domains over Cu domains does result in the copper 
domains being split up where the Cu and Mo domain cross or change from being 
coincident. There are areas where Mo and Cu display significant correlation. This is 
not always consistent and suggests that if the Cu and Mo mineralisation are not 
related to the same mineralising event then they may be related in part due to the 
use of the same structures or due to scavenging or remobilisation of the original 
mineralisation during the formation of the secondary mineralisation. Since Mo 
provides the most dominant economic target for underground mining and tends to be 
the most spatially restricted of the two it is used to subdivide the Cu domain into that 
which occurs with Mo and that which does not.

The combined domains for waste and ore materials (excluding weathering) are 
defined in Table 14.5. The domain codes roughly define a top down sequence and 
split the upper and lower mineralisation sequence to allow separate statistical 
analysis. The change in style of mineralisation from South to North Mount Dore at 
around 7,605,000 mN is not well defined by drilling in that area making it difficult to 
determine how the upper and lower sequence of mineralisation that is evident in 
Mount Dore North join to the single sequence defined in Mount Dore South. The 
current interpretation infers that the lower mineralisation sequence continues and the 
upper sequence disappears.

14.11 Domain Boundary 

Domain boundaries may be defined as 'soft' or 'hard'. Previous statistical 
assessment of the domain boundary behaviour by QG (2009, 2010) indicated abrupt 
grade changes across the domain boundaries which indicate hard boundaries were 
required.  

This behaviour is still evident visually for Mo at the Merlin high grade domains and is 
also evident for Cu in the Cu domains and is the basis of the existing interpretation. 
The subdivision of the copper domains by the Mo domains and subdivision of the 
polymetallic domains by the copper domains are areas where soft boundaries for 
some elements could be considered. In both case the same hard boundaries are 
used for all elements to ensure any local correlations with the principal economic 
elements are preserved. 

14.12 Data Preparation 

14.12.1 Database Preparation 

The Mount Dore drilling data was supplied by IVA in a Microsoft Access database 
export format, as used by IVA for Micromine software presentation and processing. 
The data was briefly validated at several stages for cross table conformity and 
integrity. Minor corrections identified by Golder were undertaken by IVA on an 
ongoing basis. The final dataset delivered 
"acQuire_MD_Drilling_Database_Jun_27.mdb" included all data available up until 
27 June 2010. Drilling at Mount Dore stopped several weeks prior to this allowing the 
assays to be completed for the Prefeasibility Study. 

The data provided included all drilling in and around the Mount Dore area and 
included 760 drill holes. This includes many shallow air core drill holes to the south 
and drilling at another small prospect to the east. This data was initially subset for the 
modelling area defined in Table 14.15 and displayed in Figure 9.1, to provide 
491 drill holes relevant to the Mount Dore and Merlin resource study. Twenty-two of 
these drill holes have no available assays for the following reasons: 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 109 

• Precollars drilled but extensions abandoned or cancelled (MDQ0087, 
MDQ0144, MDQ0215, MDQ0215A, MDQ0333, MDQ0334, MDQ0347, 
MDQ0349). 

• Geotechnical drill holes for the Merlin decline (MDQ0262, MDQ0263, 
MDQ0265, MDQ0266, MDQ0268 to MDQ0270, MDQ0272, MDQ0291, 
MDQ0311, MDQ0382, MDQ0385). 

• Metallurgical drill holes (MDQ0337, MDQ0338, MDQ0400). 

• Water test drill hole (MDQ0401). 

• No assays available (MDQ0368). 

Drill holes with outstanding assays that missed the final database cut off date include 
MDQ0368 and extensions to MDQ0220 and MDQ0251. All drilling was used for 
interpretation; however unassayed drill holes and intervals listed above were 
excluded from the resource estimate, leaving a total of 469 assayed drill holes. 

Table 14.7 summarises drilling data by drilling type for collar information. This table 
indicates that sampling is dominated by diamond drilling and includes:  

Table 14.6 Drilling Data by Drilling Type 
Pre-IVA DDH 12.5% 

Pre-IVA percussion 7.5% 

IVA DDH 60% 

IVA RC 20% 

RC drilling by IVA includes an initial RC drilling program in 2008 of 39 drill holes. 
Other RC drilling by IVA includes pre-collar drilling for diamond drill tails, with the RC 
mostly in expected waste zones in the granite overburden. Pre-IVA drilling by 
previous companies includes a number of drilling types including RC, percussion and 
air core drilling.  

QG (2008) reviewed RC drilling and spear sampling of wet samples undertaken of 
IVA and raised some concerns regarding the sample quality. No test work has been 
completed to date to validate the spear sampling used in 2008. Subsequent RC pre-
collar drilling has used on rig riffle splitters. 

Comparing the collar and assay results in Table 14.8 indicates the degree of 
completeness of assaying for each drill program. As drilling has become deeper, 
selective sampling processes has resulted in a lower proportion of drilling being 
assayed.

14.12.2 Recovery 

Drilling by IVA and previous companies have used some selective sampling 
processes, namely to avoid sampling and assaying long runs of footwall or hanging 
wall waste where no logged mineralisation occurs. This introduces a potential bias in 
the interpretation and estimation process. 

The drill data were prepared to best identify loss from unsampled core using the 
available recovery information and some assumptions. The process involved: 

• Missing unsampled drill hole intervals were generated in an Access database 
software from the collar information that includes the total hole depth. 

• All unsampled intervals were broken down by any available recovery logs 
(based on core run intervals). 

• Assigned length weighted core recovery averages to each drill hole interval 
(accounting for sample intervals that can span recovery or core run intervals). 

• Recovered core was then designated as either sampled or unsampled. 

• Since the recovery logs are in places incomplete (ie the database does not 
identify 0% recovery core runs), lost core was identified as unsampled 
intervals. Lost core was flagged if the recovery was either: 

- 0% recover. 

- <90% recovery where the recovered length was <1 m (assumed the 
interval to sample). 

- Missing recovery and the interval <3 m where up and down hole 
intervals do have recovery details (ie missing recovery logs in holes that 
do have recovery available). 

- Interval <1 m and no recovery logs for the drill hole. 

- No recovery logs at the end of hole. 

• Unsampled drilling was identified as either: 

- Recovered length >2 m. 

- Recovery >40%. 
- Sample type was RC or other percussion type and sample interval >2 m. 

- Remaining intervals >3 m with no recovery logs. 

• Finally lost or unsampled flags were copied down hole to neighbouring 
unflagged intervals to fill the remaining sample intervals. 

Table 14.11 summarises the tagged values for the samples as either: 

• Some recovery and sampled, ie where assay are available. 

• Some recovery and not sampled, ie where defaults should be assigned for 
economic values as no mineralisation was logged to warrant sampling. 

• Lost where no assay could be taken and the interval treated as missing. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 112 

The average recovery of 96% for all IVA diamond drilling should be revised down by 
1% to account for the lost core with no recovery records entered into the database. 
Recovery data is available for 85% of the IVA drilling. 

QG (2009) notes poor recovery near surface at Mount Dore South in the earlier IVA 
drilling. The available data does not suggest this observation and further 
investigation is required. 

14.12.3 Dry Bulk Density 

Assignment of density values to the assay table in acQuire was noted to result in 
some irregularities where a single density measurement from a ~20 cm specimen 
was assigned to intervals up to 16 m long. Subsequent compositing would result in 
multiple duplicates of the same data potentially biasing any analysis. 

To avoid this issue the sampled or unsampled drill intervals >2 m were broken into 
2 m subintervals using a Visual Basic macro, prior to compositing. Dry bulk density 
values were then averaged for the available drill hole intervals before being assigned 
to the drill hole interval. This provides a database where closely spaced density 
specimens are averaged for the same sample interval providing:  

• A better basis for statistical analysis and sample support for estimation 
purposes. 

• A database where density can be paired with assay data. 

• An avoidance of any duplication of the individual density values. 

Table 14.9 summarises the dry bulk density data for each combined mineralisation-
lithology domain and weathering type. Bulk density varies slightly with the degree of 
oxidation; but there is relatively little variation in density for the different lithology and 
mineralisation domains.  

The consistency of dry bulk density samples taken across Mount Dore-Merlin can be 
attributed to the relative lack of other sulphide minerals such as pyrite and the 
pervasive alteration that has made most lithology type similar. Even Merlin (Dom=6) 
which contains high grade molybdenite, a very dense mineral, does not appear to 
display larger density values on average. A closer inspection of the relationship 
between Mo and density does indicate a weak positive relationship (refer to Figure 
14.8); this does not appear to have resulted in a higher average density for the 
domain that would reflect the high Mo grade. Table 14.10 indicates that if the Merlin 
samples are weighted by the density values the average grade increases by 3%. 
This would indicate the potential bias if a blanket average density was assigned to 
the entire domain.

14.12.4 Default Grades 

As discussed in Section 14.12.2 selective sampling of drill core can result in 
estimation bias when only samples with visible mineralisation are selected for 
assaying. This bias is present in only a few early drill holes within the mineralised 
zones but is more systematic in the peripheral waste zones, where the estimation of 
low grade mineralisation, waste and possible dilution material may become biased if 
the selective sampling is not addressed. For grade estimation purposes all 
unsampled intervals were assigned default grade of 0.001 for all potentially economic 
elements including Cu, Mo, Re, Zn, Pb, Au, Ag and Co. Other non economic 
elements such as Fe and S were left as missing. Table 14.11 summarises the 
proportion of each domain that is unsampled and set to default grades and that 
designated as lost core and left as missing and ignored during compositing. 

14.12.5 Domain Flagging 

Samples for the domains described in Section 14.1 were flagged in Vulcan software 
for samples lying inside the mineralisation solid wireframe models or above/below 
the oxidation, lithology and metallurgy surface wireframe models.

14.12.6 Compositing 

The majority of the drilling has been sampled on regular 2 m intervals. Only some 
sub-sampling or irregular intervals were undertaken by IVA. Limited early drilling prior 
to IVA was sampled on less regular intervals. 

Though the open pit estimation for Cu oxide resource could justify a larger composite 
size, 2 m was retained for all estimation and analysis as the preferred composite 
length as this will support selective open pit and underground mining options.  

Compositing the available data to 2 m presents potential variance deflation issues in 
some selected areas as there are a few drill holes where sub-sampling down hole at 
a geological contact has not always been followed by a regular sampling protocol. In 
most cases sampling returned to the 2 m regular intervals set from the drill collar, but 
is some case the sampling returned to 2 m intervals from the geological contact. This 
presents an issue for generic compositing routines to achieve composite files that do 
not result in variance deflation somewhere. An adapted "smart" compositing 
approach was adopted whereby samples were only composited in Vulcan software if 
the samples were not within the desired length of 1.9 to 2.0 m, noting that all 
intervals larger than 2 m were already split to a maximum of 2 m. This was 
implemented by first assessing the database using a Visual Basic program to 
determine if the samples required compositing.  

Lost core defined in Table 14.11 was treated as missing during compositing where 
as unsampled intervals were assigned default values for all elements with potential 
economic significance (other elements were treated as missing). 

Majority rules were used to preserve the flagged domain codes. The composites 
were assessed visually and statistically along the mineralisation boundaries to 
ensure the original sub 2 m intervals still honoured the boundary interpretations 
which were based on the original sample intervals. This involved adjusting the 
interpretation for Cu and polymetallic domain to reflect 2 m selectivity and enforcing 
the Mo domain boundary to break the compositing.  

Figure 14.9 displays the progression of the sample database from original intervals 
(top left), split samples (top right) and final 2 m composites (bottom). For the entire 
database there are relatively few sub 2 m composites remaining after compositing.

Figure 14.9 Distribution of all Sample and Composite Lengths 

 

Recent sampling protocols by IVA allow for sub-sampling and assaying <2 m 
intervals in and around the Merlin high grade Mo domains. Figure 14.10 compares 
the distribution of original samples and final 2 m composites for the high grade Mo 
domains at Merlin. This indicates that some 1 and 1.5 m samples remain which 
require length weighting during estimation to avoid estimation biases that may result 
from the shorter intervals. 

Figure 14.10 Distribution of Merlin Domain Sample and Composite Lengths 

 

For only the mineralised domains, where selective sampling and the effect of default 
grades is minimal, it is possible to compare the length weighted average grades for 
the original samples and 2 m composites, see Table 14.12. The metal content is 
expected to increase due to both the addition of default grades to unsampled 
intervals and the handing of lost core which has been ignored and effectively 
assigned grades from neighbouring samples. The results for Cu indicate a small 
decrease in average grade with a similar metal content for Cu which is assayed

consistently across the deposit except for a few older drill holes where default grades 
have reduced the mean grade. Significant decreases in the mean grade and minor 
increase in metal content for Mo and Re and to a lesser extent Pb and Zn are a 
result of the addition of a significant proportion of default grades; mostly from early 
Mount Dore South drilling that was completed before the discovery of the Merlin and 
polymetallic zones further to the north. The default samples are mostly situated in the 
oxide copper domains of Mount Dore South where Zn and Mo mineralisation is not 
recognised to date. Though such mineralisation could exist the addition of the default 
grade will ensure neighbouring grades are not over extrapolated past drilling where 
logging did not recognise such mineralisation.

14.12.7 Declustering 

Declustering was used remove potential biases in sample statistics that can arise 
from variable drill density. This can arise from purpose driven infill drilling of higher 
grade areas and local clustering and drill spacing variations due to inherent issues 
with placing drill holes and completing a deep drilling program used to define the 
Merlin mineralisation. 

Normal cell declustering without any boundaries can present issues for structural 
deposits where the edge cells become overweighted as the cell size is increased. A 
modified cell declustering algorithm was used that weights the cells to the block 
model volume within each cell. This allows domains to be declustered separately 
without introducing any boundary issues. 

The cell size was optimised for a cubic window size of 100 m and the origin offset 10 
times. The calculated weights were used in addition to the sample length to weight 
samples for declustered statistics and log-probability plots.

14.12.8 Top-Cutting 

The presence of outliers (or 'extreme' values), and the need to apply 'top-cut' values 
(or 'capping', where samples above a certain threshold are assigned the top-cut 
value) to sample populations was assessed using a number of techniques: 

• Examination of grade distributions using box plots, histograms and probability 
plots. 

• Statistical assessment of the grade distributions. 

• Examination of the spatial locations of identified outlier samples and the 
relative impact of the default grades. 

The combination of domains and oxidation creates a large number of combinations 
where cutting and grade estimation division could be considered. Statistical analysis 
of these domain combinations indicates that some elements display different 
behaviour and can be arranged in groups suitable for both estimation and grade 
cutting as follows: 

• Mo and Re are both highly correlated to the occurrence of Molybdenite, see 
Golder 2010. This is a mineral that will often persist in the weathering zone 
though most of the Merlin deposit dissipates before reaching the surface or 
the oxide zone. The only significant occurrence of the Merlin Mo mineralisation 
in the oxide is at Little Wizard (MODOM=4) where massive high grade 
molybdenite occurs along with other sulphide minerals that have withstood 
any oxidation. As a result it is not considered likely that Mo or Re should be 
affected by the weathering profile with lower grades in the oxide related to 
weaker peripheral mineralisation rather than oxidation effects. Note IVA is yet 
to analyse for the presence of Mo oxide minerals as most core visually 
indicates that molybdenite persists in the oxide zone. 

• The Little Wizard zone (MODOM=4) within the Merlin high grade Mo domains 
indicates significantly higher grades populations for Cu, Mo, Re and Au and 
lower grades for Co, Zn and Pb, see Golder 2010. Though this domain is 
relatively small, it's potential economic significant for the mine development 
indicates that separate assessment and grade cutting is warranted. 

• S, Zn and Pb display significant changes in grade distribution through the 
weathering profile between oxide, transition and fresh material type (MINL=2, 
3, 4 respectively). In each case separate cutting and grade estimation is 
warranted. 

• Cu, Co, Au and Ag display reasonable similarity between transition and fresh 
materials with different grade distributions evident in the oxide, see Appendix 
A, Golder 2010. The oxide is generally lower grade although for Au there are 
some cases where small higher grade pods are noted in the oxide; these are 
thought to be local Au accumulations but could also be a result of some 
remnant supergene enrichment. For these elements the oxide is treated 
separately to the transition and fresh zones. 

• Cu displays some indication that the transition zone is higher grade sub-
population both in north (upper sequence) and south Mount Dore. This was 
evident during sectional interpretations and in statistical plots broken down by 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 118 

weathering. It is not evident if this is a natural variation where the transition 
just happens to coincide with the central and higher grade portion of the 
mineralisation or if supergene enrichment of Cu in the transition has produced 
some of the higher grade zones down open fractures. The differences are 
sufficient to warrant separate grade cutting for Cu in the transition and fresh 
zones. 

Top cuts are those defined in Table 14.13. Distributions before top cuts can be 
compared to those after cutting in Appendix A, Golder 2010.

The approach taken to grade cutting was to implement a consistent statistical 
approach by cutting all economic elements to roughly the 99th percentile based on 
the original assay grades, without the inclusion of default values. The values were 
rounded and simplified to maintain similarity between domains where justified. The 
approach included:  

• Little Wizard and Merlin were considered separately for all elements. 

• Copper mineralisation for Mount Dore South and North (using 7,604,900 mN) 
were considered separately in case of there being significant difference due to 
the change in weathering depth. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 119 

• Mineralisation for Mount Dore North was subdivided into the upper and lower 
mineralisation sequences. 

• Weathering was considered as previously described. 

14.13 Data Analysis 

14.13.1 Density Data 

The dry bulk density data was supplied in a separate table to the other assay data, 
and was sometimes represented as a discrete point in a drill hole as opposed to a 
down hole interval. In general, the length of core used for the density determination is 
about 10 cm, and it is common practice to assign this density value to the 
corresponding down hole sample length used for assaying. Although this has been 
done for some density data, density is left as points elsewhere. Compositing to an 
equal length cannot be achieved if original down hole intervals are not known. 

QG notes that the samples for density were taken on essentially equal support, 
therefore compositing is not strictly necessary.  

It is common in resource estimation to density-weight assay data during compositing, 
but this usually requires the density data to be as extensively collected as the assay 
data. Due to the mismatch between the frequency of density and assay data in this 
case, the assay compositing has not been density-weighted. 

The density data was flagged with the same domain codes as for the assayed 
variables, and six separate zones for geostatistical analysis and estimation were 
established: 
• Kuridala formation (outside Mo domains), oxide. 

• Kuridala formation (outside Mo domains), transitional. 

• Kuridala formation (outside Mo domains), fresh. 

• Medium grade Mo (including hanging wall), oxide + transitional. 

• Medium grade Mo, fresh. 

• High grade Mo (all in fresh). 

14.13.2 Statistics 

Summary statistics for the composited data for all domains, for the combined 
domains, along with log-probability plots by individual and combined domains are 
presented in Appendix A. Table 14.21 also displays the changes from cutting 
including the metal loss and decrease in variance. As expected, many of the 
domains that previously had very high coefficients of variation (CV) have significantly 
lower CV's after top grade cutting.  

Multivariate statistics are presented in Appendix A as Pearson correlation coefficients 
by domain in Appendix A, Golder 2010. This demonstrates some correlation is 
present for elements in some domains which are not present globally. Notably the 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 120 

correlation between Mo-Re and other elements like S-Au-Ag-Cu increase within the 
high grade Mo domain at Merlin compared to other domains. This strengthens the 
rationale for ensuring that high grade domains such as those for Mo and Cu are 
estimated with all elements constrained in the same envelope as there is sufficient 
positive correlation present between many elements.  

14.13.3 Variography 

Cut 2 m composites were used for all variogram analysis. Traditional semi-
variograms provided erratic results in some instances and a combination of semi-
variograms and inverted correlograms were used as a basis for all variogram 
modelling. All semi-variograms were scaled to the domain variance to enable the 
different variogram and correlogram types to be overlayed at the same scale. 

Variogram maps for the major element domains were assessed to ensure that the 
variograms support the shape and structure of the domains, which predominantly 
strike N-S and dip at average of 50° towards the east. None of the variograms 
indicated any significant trend within the plane of mineralisation. This lack of plunge 
was also the case for Mo and Re where the overall grade trends suggest a northerly 
plunge might be present. The Oxide Cu suggests a greater continuity N-S than down 
dip. Despite this indication the geological interpretation still indicates reasonable 
down dip continuity for Cu, though this may be lost for Zn which is leached and 
occurs only in deeper patches in the oxide zone. 

Variogram models were primarily based on the inverted experimental correlograms 
and are plotted in black in all figures. In all cases the experimental semi-variogram 
was overlain (in green) and used to assist the interpretations. The semi-variograms 
suffer from being both erratic and not converging to the expected sill due to 
occurrence of grade pods within the resource. The semi-variograms were used as a 
guide to the shape and suitability of the correlograms for modelling and estimation. 

The dip of the principal mineralisation varies along the strike length from near vertical 
in the deeper sections of the Merlin Mo domains to near horizontal in flexures 
towards Mount Dore South for Cu domains. To remove these structural changes 
simple unfolding of the variograms and correlograms to a N-S reference plane 
dipping 50° towards the east was used for the principal model orientations. The 
validity of the variogram model derived from the unfolded composites was verified by 
overlaying the variogram models with directional semi-variograms and correlograms. 

Down hole variograms with a lag of 2 m used for all cross strike model orientations. 
Down hole orientations vary from 60° to 90° towards the west and represent oblique 
intersections. Separate assessment of variograms at 60° to 90° was found to provide 
some conflicting results as the different orientations tend to be clustered. In most 
cases the down hole data from the various orientations were pooled to provide more 
robust results. However some small longer range structures were ignored in some 
instances where these were found to be only present in the vertical drill holes and 
likely to be slight down dip effects from the more dip parallel drilling.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 121 

The majority of the drilling is spaced at 50 m. There is only limited regular 25 m infill 
drilling with other closer spaced drilling occurring in only some localities, such as at 
crossing drill holes, twin holes, near surface Mount Dore South drilling, 12.5 m infill at 
Little Wizard etc. Since many variogram structures appear to be less than the 50 m 
general spacing 12.5 m lag was selected for unfolded experimental variograms and 
correlograms in order to provide sufficient lags to model the indicated structures. 
Longer 25 m lags were used for the directional variogram validation. 

Additional variogram parameters used in most cases for the unfolded variogram 
calculation include: 

• One or two structure spherical scheme models. 

• Horizontal angle of 45° for modelling and 15° for assessing possible plunges. 

• Vertical angle of 25°. 

• Horizontal distance of 50 m within the unfolded plane. 

• Vertical distance of 6 m across the unfolded plane. 

Variogram models used a two structure spherical scheme model in all cases.  

The relatively short ranges evident for most variograms and the use of a short lag to 
help define these structures, at a quarter of the general drill spacing, make the 
variogram model particularly sensitive to the limited clusters of close space drilling 
and localised data arrangements. 

Initial analysis indicated considerable similarity between the variogram structures for 
some element groups, notably: 

• Zn - Pb. 
• Cu - Co - Au - Ag. 

• Mo - Re. 

• S - Density. 

• Fe.  

Where possible, variogram model parameters were retained at similar values 
between orientations, domains and elements, so as not to produce artefacts in the 
estimations. In particular this was done to ensure element relationships or 
correlations evident between samples are respected implicitly during estimation and 
reflected in the resource estimate.  

Evidence for anisotropy between strike and down dip orientations was only noted in a 
few cases where the variograms indicated anisotropy was evident, notably for Merlin 
Mo-Re.  

Closely related elements such as Mo-Re and Pb-Zn used the same variogram model 
based on the more significant element, i.e. Mo and Zn respectively, though the other 
elements were considered in the modelling process.  



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 122 

Co, Au and Ag displayed reasonable similarity to the Cu variograms. In most 
domains the Cu variogram model is used for Co, Ag and Au with satisfactory results. 
Even though there are some small accumulations of Au and Co that do not correlate 
with Cu it appears that generally these four elements display sufficient correlation 
and similar behaviour for Cu to provide a reasonable indication of the continuity, 
despite their lower less significant abundance.  

Variogram modelling was undertaken on the basis of the domains derived for each 
element group and used for estimation purposes.  

Variogram models are summarised in Table 14.14. Mo, Cu and Zn variogram models 
for the principal mineralised domains are presented in Figure 14.11 and Figure 14.12 
and demonstrate the continuity models typical for each element.

Density data is not as abundant as the other elements and has a relatively narrow 
range in values compared to the expected measurement error. As a result the 
density variograms were particularly erratic. Where structure was indicated the 
density variograms displayed a similarity to those for S. This correlation has some 
geological basis and S was used to indicate the Density variogram model in most 
cases.

14.13.4 QKNA 

Quantitative Kriging Neighbourhood Analysis (QKNA) was undertaken to assist the 
search parameter selection. This used three trial blocks to determine the sensitivity 
of the model estimates to the selection of the estimation parameters, and in particular 
search radius and number of samples. QKNA analysis is method of assessing and 
measuring the benefit/disadvantages between different search parameters for 
ordinary kriging by assessing four parameters including: 

• Slope of regression.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 125 

• Negative kriging weights. 

• Reliance on simple kriging mean. 

• Kriging variance. 

Mount Dore and Merlin are relatively evenly drilled on 50 m grid centres that equates 
to a 50 N-S x 70 m down dip drill hole spacing. Exceptions to this general spacing 
include (refer to Figure 9.1): 
• Little Wizard drilling at 12.5 m centres for a small target area. 

• At Merlin and Mount Dore North there are two 25 m lines of drilling with 50 m 
spaced drill holes on a diagonally offset grid. 

• Fanning of drill holes to drill the depth extent of Merlin has resulted in some 
closer spaced drilling data in the upper sequences of mineralisation at Mount 
Dore North. 

• A small area of shallow close spaced RC drilling in Mount Dore South. 
• A few sections of wider spaced lines to the south and north of the drilled areas 

where infilling is not complete or not warranted. 

The general spacing would indicate a minimum strike and down dip search range of 
>50 m is required for adequate sample selection. QKNA analysis confirms that a 
minimum 75 m lateral search is required to produce near optimal results.  

Block sizes used for parent cell estimation vary from 5 mE x 5 mRL for underground 
targets at Merlin to 10 mE x 10 mRL for open pit estimation. The majority of the 
resources at Merlin and Mount Dore dip from between 30° to 80° and average around 
50°. This angle is not ideal as it increases the width of the search range required to 
ensure that sufficient samples are used in the estimation such that the block is wholly 
defined and the data is not subset with respect to the true area of influence needed 
for parent cell estimation. For this purpose the minimum required cross strike search 
range required for estimation should be 8.5 m and 17 m respectively for the two 
parent cell sizes.  

14.13.5 Geological Block Model 

The block model PFS1006v2.bmf has 1,255,208 blocks created in Maptek Vulcan 
Software V8.02 using multiple parent/maximum block sizes for different domains, as 
defined in Table 14.15. These parent block sizes correlate to the parent block size 
used for grade estimation with Ordinary Kriging. 

Domain and category fields supplied for the model are defined in Table 14.16. 
Domain values are previously defined in Table 14.4 and Table 14.5. Sub-blocking is 
only undertaken for the mineralisation domain boundaries and the top and bottom of 
the Kuridala Formation. Other boundaries for oxidation, metallurgical domain, 
classification and other geological boundaries were flagged from wireframes and are 
not sub-blocked. This is commensurate with the accuracy of the models which are 
largely based on 100 m section interpretations.

Figure 14.13 displays the wireframe model in plan view to compare their extent. Note 
that the polymetallic domain includes the Cu domains and the abrupt southern 
extend for the polymetallic domain is only due to its extension along the existing 
copper interpretations to extend the interpretation. The polymetallic zone becomes 
progressively smaller south of 7,605,000 mN.

14.13.6 Grade Estimation Parameters 

Estimation by Ordinary Kriging (OK) was performed for all domains, with grade 
estimation for parent cells listed in Table 14.15 and not the sub-cells. The parent cell 
size was used to limit the maximum size of the blocks to different sizes depending on 
the mineralisation type and anticipated mining method. The two predominant parent 
blocks sizes used for mineralised material includes: 

• 10 x 25 x 10 m for mineralised waste and upper sequence mineralised 
sequences including all of Mount Dore South. This includes all areas to 
present a potential open pit target based on the current scoping study 
development plan. This block size is considered a suitable size for estimation 
of open pit copper targets and is well supported by the 50 m drilling grid. 
Though some copper lenses to the north do become narrow they are generally 
at least 10 m in width. 

• 5 x12.5 x 5 m for all lower sequence mineralisation at Mount Dore North (ie 
north of 7,604,950 mN). This includes the narrow high grade Merlin high grade 
Mo mineralisation that presents a narrow stope target where blocks muck 
wider than 5 m would present an estimation issue with the majority of the 
parent cell lying well outside the constrained lens. Defined high grade copper 
also presents a narrow lens in places requiring a narrow block width. Previous 
block models by QG and Golder have used a larger parent cell size of 12.5 x 
25 x 10 m and 10 x 25 x 10 m respectively for the mineralisation around the 
Merlin high grade zone. This zone comprises disseminated and stringer 
mineralisation of Mo-Re and additional lenses of Cu and/or Zn. The relatively 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 131 

wide parent block sizes compared to the drill hole composites of 2 m has 
resulted in a lack of any moderate grade mineralisation being represented in 
the model and as a result not of this mineralisation, including some of the 
larger copper lenses, have not previously contributed to the stope design as 
neighbouring dilution or potential low grade stope addition. The smaller block 
size of 5 x12.5 x 5 m has been used for the wider lower grade copper and 
polymetallic zone best rectify this issue.  

Search Parameters 
Search parameters were selected on the basis of the general drill spaced ~ 50 m and 
QKNA results (refer to Section 14.13.4). Three search passes were undertaken as 
follows: 

• Pass 1 : 75 x 75 x 15 m (strike, down dip and cross strike orientations). 

• Pass 2: 150 x 150 x 30 m. 
• Pass 3: 300 x 300 x 60 m. 

All estimates were restricted to a maximum of samples. The blocks were re-
estimated if insufficient drill holes or number of composites were available on the 
previous search pass, such that the estimation passes enforced: 

• Pass 1: Minimum 10 composites from a minimum of 4 drill holes. 

• Pass 2: Minimum 10 composites from a minimum of 4 drill holes. 

• Pass 3: Minimum 2 composites. 

Some parameters were varied on the basis of the two principal parent block sizes: 
• Open pit 10 x 25 x 10 m blocks or larger:  

- Discretisation: 2 x 5 x 2. 

- Maximum of 9 composites per drill hole. 

- Maximum of 36 composites. 

• Underground 5 x 12.5 x 5 m blocks or smaller: 

- Discretisation: 2 x 5 x 2. 

- Maximum of 5 composites per drill hole. 
- Maximum of 20 composites. 

Since a small number of composites remain at <2 m and their removal from the 
narrow high grade Mo zones could result in bias. Hence, kriging estimates weighted 
by the composite length were employed to improve local estimation by accounting for 
shorter intervals. This is applied during kriging but after the calculation of the kriging 
weights. The number of sub 2 m samples is minimal and not considered to be 
significant (refer to Figure 14.9).  

Variables estimated using ordinary kriging used the variogram models presented in 
Table 14.14. Copper and polymetallic domains were estimated separately for oxide 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 132 

and transition + fresh material using different variograms model parameters. The 
estimated variables included: 

• Potential economic elements Cu, Co, Zn, Pb, Mo, Re, Au and Ag with 
assigned default grades to avoid bias introduced by selective sampling of drill 
core. 

• Non-economic elements Fe and S without assigned default grades. 
• Dry bulk density measurements averaged for composite intervals. 

Estimation used Golder in-house estimating routines that allow unfolding to individual 
surface or solid model. These were used to account for the small variations in dip 
that occur throughout the deposit. Most mineralised domains were unfolded to the 
middle of each mineralised wireframe (refer to Table 14.4). The main lower 
polymetallic domain (P_DOM=5) contains a bifurcation which complicates unfolding. 
A simple surface model following the top of the main Cu of Mo mineralisation was 
used for unfolding in this case. This surface was also used for unfolding the Kuridala 
Formation unmineralised material (DOM=2, 5). Hanging wall granite waste material 
was unfolded to the base of the granite. Footwall waste units were unfolded to the 
top of the quartzite. 

14.13.7 Estimation Results 

To ensure completeness of the block estimates and avoid potential issues for 
missing grades during mine planning the third and final search passes used large 
search radii to ensure most relevant blocks were assigned estimated grades. This 
ensured that nearly all mineralised blocks were assigned estimates. 

Table 14.20 displays the degree of completeness of the three pass estimation. Most 
blocks within the mineralised domains are estimated. Unestimated blocks comprise 
mostly extrapolated waste areas. Default values were assigned to all unestimated 
blocks, as either 0.001 for all economic elements Cu, Mo, Au, Ag, Co, Re, Zn, Pb or 
assigned values defined in Table 14.19 by domain, region and weathering type for 
Fe, S and Density.

14.14 Model Validation 

Validation of the block model included: 

• Visual inspection of the grade estimates. 

• Global mean and variance comparisons. 

• Review of estimation quality parameters such as number of drill holes, number 
of samples, slope of regression, kriging variance, and average distance of 
samples.  

• SWATH plots. These include comparison of block model and declustered 
composite grade averages for East-West, North-South and Vertical slices.  

• Discrete Gaussian comparisons. This compares the block model distribution 
(grade - volume) to the declustered composite distribution after theoretical 
Gaussian adjustment for the change of support from 2 m composites to the 
two principal block sizes used for estimation. 

A comparison of the global mean and variance between the declustered composites 
and the volume weighted block model estimates for each combined domain is 
provided for Mo and Cu in Table 14.21. The mean grades compare favourably and 
indicate no significant bias.

The change in variance from composite to block support can be calculated as the 
F Factor. This can be compared to the theoretical F Factor calculated from the 
variogram model for the desired selective mining unit, or in this case the parent cell 
size used for estimation (10 x 25 x 10 m for open pit areas and 5 x 6.25 x 5 m for 
underground target areas). Since theoretical selectivity is rarely achieved in practise 
due to the information effect and mining errors the theoretical F factors presented in 
Table 14.21 are reduced by 20% based on previous experience. The comparison of 
the F Factors in Table 14.21 provides some indication as to the ability of the block 
model estimate to represent the desired parent blocks that are estimated. The 
following can be concluded as far as the grade estimates within each domain: 

• Open pit estimates for Cu display greater smoothing than desired for the 
selective 10 m widths estimated. The parent blocks used for estimation are 
smaller than can effectively be supported by the 50 m spaced drilling resulting 
in the smoothing. These grade estimates effectively reflect a larger selectivity. 

• Underground estimates generally display greater degree of smoothing as the 
target block size is smaller again. For the narrow Merlin zone Cu performs well 
and Mo reasonably well given the greater grade range. For the wider Cu and 
polymetallic underground zones this is reversed with Cu performing poorly and 
Mo performing better. Overall the results indicate significant smoothing of the 
grade estimates for the block sizes selected. 

For both target mining sizes the F Factor comparison does not take into account the 
hard domain boundaries and searching geometry that have driven the selection of 
block sizes used for estimation. The comparison clearly indicates that the drilling 
data is not sufficient to effectively estimate the parent block sizes used. As such the 
parent block sizes do not reflect the effective selectivity of the resource estimate 
which equate to a larger block size. However there is some degree of selectively built 
into the hard domain boundaries used in the estimate. The smaller parent block size 
used for underground estimation displays a higher F Factor and hence less 
smoothing than would have occurred if a larger block size were estimated and that 
achieved in the open pit estimates. As a result the resource model will have a greater 
chance of reflecting some of the local grade variation within the lower grades areas 
surrounding the high grade veins at Merlin, particularly near the hard domain 
boundaries, and which could improve the mine stope optimisation and design. 

The theoretical F Factors can also be used to adjust the composite grade population 
to reflect the block size being estimated. This uses a discrete Gaussian adjustment. 
The block model estimates can then be compared to the scaled discrete Gaussian 
composite distribution to determine if bias or smoothing is significant across the 
distribution. Figure 14.32 to Figure 14.34 presents the discrete Gaussian comparison 
for Cu, Zn and Mo broken into three domain groups for the main mineralisation 
packages. Results for Cu and Zn are relatively comparably indicating the model 
effectively reproduces the range of grades expected. A small degree of smoothing is 
indicated, particularly in Mount Dore North which displays greater structural control, 
where volume below 0.3% Cu or 0.4% Zn are possibly overestimated slightly while 
grades above 0.5% Cu are slightly underestimated.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 138 

For Mo estimates within Merlin there is a higher level of smoothing evident for grades 
<1% Mo. These can be attributed to two areas; interburden within multiple high grade 
Mo intercepts where smoothing is inevitable and selective mining unlikely to be 
achieved, and low grade peripheral areas. Peripheral areas of low grade are typically 
thin and there is some small degree of risk than during definition or mining these 
areas may incur some loss of reserves. As with any narrow vein mining scenario it is 
essential that the mine planning process include a review of the drilling to determine 
those areas where smoothing may result in higher risk areas for conversion of 
resources to reserves.

14.15 Mineral Resource Classification 

The Mount Dore and Merlin resources were previously classified by Mike Job of QG 
(2009, 2010), largely on the basis that: 

• The target drill spacing of 50 x 50 m was sufficient to define Indicated 
Mineral Resource under both JORC and NI 43-101 guidelines. 

• The resource interpretations were sufficiently robust. 

• Data quality and quantity are sufficient for Indicated classification. 
• Cu, Mo and Re display the level of continuity required. 

Exploration work completed since the last resource estimate has largely 
concentrated on the extension of the 50 x 50 m infill drilling pattern at Mount Dore 
North. This work along with the subsequent resource analysis and reviews do not 
present any reason to change the classification criteria. As a result the basic premise 
that 50 m spaced grid drilling is sufficient to define Indicated Resources has been 
retained and applied by defining the plan area where 50 x 50 m drilling intersects the 
Merlin or lower copper mineralisation, allowing for 25 m of extrapolation. Figure 9.1 
presents the plan outline of the Indicated Mineral Resource, which does not directly 
correlate the collar locations to the point of intersection with the mineralisation. The 
classification was then modified to account for areas of lower continuity including: 

• Hanging wall and footwall lithology units for granite, quartzite and Stavely 
Formation, outside any mineralisation shapes was reset to unclassified. 

• Waste zones outside the mineralisation shapes and within the Kuridala 
Formation were reset to Inferred Mineral Resource given that any 
mineralisation does not display the continuity required for a higher 
classification.

• A few blocks that lie above the depletion zone modelled at Mount Dore North 
were reset to Inferred Mineral Resource. 

Figure 14.21 demonstrates the application of the classification process with 
Unclassified (orange), Inferred (red) and Indicated (blue) classification viewed in 
section. 

There are a few small areas of more detailed drilling that are not considered suitable 
for Measured Mineral Resource classification, including: 

• 12.5 m spaced drilling at Little Wizard defines a very small high grade zone. 
The limited extent and the variation in thickness and grade raise some 
concerns that Measured Mineral Resource classification may be optimistic. 

• 2 infill lines of staggered 50 m drilling on 25 m offsets are available at Mount 
Dore North. These close down the drill spacing to about 35 m spacing. This is 
not considered sufficient for Measured Mineral Resource classification. 

• An area of close spaced RC drilling at Mount Dore South provides sufficient 
drill spacing, however the previous RC has some untested concerns about 
sample quality that require further investigation before Measured Mineral 
Resource should be considered.  

14.16 Mineral Resource Statement 

The total Mineral Resource estimated for Mount Dore - Merlin deposits is presented 
in two exclusive parts at different cut-off grades. 

The Merlin and Little Wizard total Mineral Resource estimate at a 0.3% Mo cut-off is: 
6.5 Mt at 1.3% Mo and 23 ppm Re Indicated Mineral Resource 
0.2 Mt at 0.9% Mo and 15 ppm Re Inferred Mineral Resource 

The Mount Dore total Mineral Resource estimate at a 0.25% Cu cut-off is: 
86 Mt at 0.55% Cu Indicated Mineral Resource 
58 Mt at 0.47% Cu Inferred Mineral Resource 

Note this excludes all Cu mineralisation included in the above Merlin + Little Wizard 
Mineral Resource reported above a 0.3% Mo cut-off. 

Significant additional Zn mineralisation exists outside of the quoted Cu mineralisation 
at Mount Dore North. Viable recovery of Zn is not yet demonstrated and stand alone 
Zn resources are not included in this resource statement. 

Previous resource statements have included some small updates at an upper 
bonanza Mo zone at Little Wizard, but otherwise the data used for the previous 
greater Mount Dore resource includes drilling completed to 27th July 2010. This 
update sees the addition of 93 drill holes for 26,253 m for a total of 469 assayed 
resource drill holes for 113,928 m. Drilling over the last twelve months has largely 
targeted:

Note: The effective date for this mineral resource estimate is 27 June 2010. 

The resource was estimated independently by Golder. Technical items of interest 
include: 

Tenure: 

• All resources are held by Ivanhoe Cloncurry Mines Pty Ltd, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of IVA, giving IVA 100% ownership. 

• The majority of the resource falls within 4 granted mining leases which cover 
the extraction of copper and molybdenum and some other minor elements.  

• Two of the mining leases have expired but have pending renewal applications. 
IVA has no reason to believe that these leases will not be renewed. 

• IVA has applied for rhenium to be added to the mining leases and understand 
this should only be a formality. Otherwise rhenium falls with the encompassing 
EPM held by IVA.  

Exploration: 

• The majority of Mount Dore North mineralisation is drilled by modern diamond 
drilling completed by IVA, where data has been collected and collated digitally 
using an integrated commercial data management software, namely acQuire. 

• Mount Dore South is drilled by a mix of RC and diamond drilling by IVA up till 
2008 and several other previous companies over several periods of 
exploration from 1976 through to 2004 when IVA acquired the property.  

• IVA sampling is on regular 2 m intervals with recent changes allowing some 
sub-sampling at the high grade Merlin mineralisation. 

• Density samples are generally undertaken every 10 m using an industry 
standard wax weight method. 10,390 measurements indicate a low variation in 
density values across most lithology, weathering and mineralisation types.  



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 142 

Quality Control: 

• An Ivanhoe Mines expert from Canada has reviewed the IVA exploration 
procedures and QAQC on a six monthly basis.  

• QAQC assaying by IVA is completed at a high frequency and includes 23% of 
all assays. 

• IVA has completed two gyroscopic down hole survey programs to locate older 
suspect drill holes and some deep holes at Merlin (down to 836 m). 

• IVA has resurveyed the majority of the older drilling and the mining tenements. 

• Independent reviews have been completed by QG and Golder. 

Resource Estimation: 

• Polymetallic domaining and interpretations are defined by in the following 
descending order of precedence. 

- Merlin domains with >0.3% Mo. 
- Copper mineralisation with >0.25% Cu. 

- Remaining polymetallic zones (from Zn, low grade Mo or other 
elements) where Cu equivalent >0.25%. Note Cu equivalence is based 
on values presented in a prior scoping study on Merlin and is only used 
to aid interpretation and is not used for reporting. 

• Grades are estimated from cut 2 m composited assays using parent block 
ordinary kriging. Elements estimated include Cu, Co, Mo, Re, Zn, Pb, Au, Ag, 
Fe and S as well as dry bulk density. 

• Unfolding to simple surfaces was used to improve search and sample 
selection and account for the variation in dip which varies from 30° to 80°. 

• Open pit potential parent block size for mineralisation is 10 x 25 x 10 m. 

• Underground block potential parent block size for mineralisation is 5 x 12.5 x 
5 m. 

• Indicated Mineral Resource classification is based on the completion of 50 m 
grid drilling, see Section 14.15. 

• Interpretation used for the resource mineralisation limits most extrapolation to 
a maximum of 25 m. 

Resource Issues: 

• At Mount Dore South the resource drilling quality raises some known concerns 
with respect to the quality of the older assaying, selective sampling of older 
drilling and some suspect wet RC sampling processes. These issues have not 
been followed up due to higher priority to define Merlin and remain 
outstanding. As a result close spaced drilling at Mount Dore South is not 
classified as Measured. 

• The Merlin high grade Mo zone is on average 3.9 m in width and defined 
largely on a 50 m spaced square grid. Overall the Merlin vein(s) display good 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 143 

continuity. However, there are no intensively drilled areas at Merlin to 
demonstrate the short range continuity of the vein i.e. if the vein is dislocated 
or pinches and swells. It is unlikely that this can feasibly be done until 
underground development allows the next phase of infill drilling from a more 
direct angle and in a more cost effective manner.  

• Mount Dore is polymetallic with many potentially economic elements present. 
Some of these will not be recoverable or have very low recoveries for some 
processing options such as heap leach. Since more work is required to test 
their economic significance, they are not part of the resource statement which 
includes only Cu, Mo and Re where metallurgical studies have indicated 
potential for reasonable recovery. 

• Open pit resource estimates are based on the assumption of a bulk mining 
scenario where high quality grade control practises are employed.  

• Drill spacing is currently at around 50 m. Though sufficient for Indicated 
Mineral Resource classification the area is structurally complex and there is 
still room for the thin high grade Merlin zone to be offset and folded locally. 
The block model size has been driven by geometry issues and the blocks 
estimated are smaller than can be adequately informed for the general drill 
spacing. Essentially the block estimates include significant smoothing and 
relate to a larger selectivity than the block sizes estimated. 

• No specific close spaced drilling has been completed to date to assist the 
definition of the grade variability and demonstrate continuity of the Merlin vein 
at short range, with the exception of the near surface Little Wizard bonanza 
zone that may not be indicative of the greater Merlin deposit. Such information 
will be required at the next stage of work and may be more practical to derive 
from underground drilling programs. 

• Significant additional Zn mineralisation exists outside of the quoted Cu 
mineralisation at Mount Dore North. Viable recovery of Zn is not yet 
demonstrated and stand alone Zn resources are not included in this resource 
statement. 

Development 

• The Prefeasibility Study has been completed with this report documenting the 
resource used as a basis for the current study. 

• IVA has recently completed the purchase of the Osborne mine and mill 
facilities 50 km for the South, see ASX announcement dated 4 October 2010. 
Current development proposals include the transport of ore to Osborne for 
milling and processing. This reduces the required capital cost and permitting 
requirements for establishing a mill at Mount Dore.  

• IVA awarded the contract for underground development of the Merlin deposit 
by means of a decline targeted initially at exploration but eventually for mining. 

This Mineral Resource estimate is based upon and accurately reflects data compiled 
or supervised by Mr John Horton, Principal Geologist, who is a Member of the 
Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and a full time employee of Golder 
Associates Pty Ltd. Mr Horton has sufficient experience that is relevant to the style of

mineralisation and the type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which 
he has undertaken to qualify as a Competent Person as defined in the 2004 edition 
of the 'Australasian Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral 
Resources and Ore Reserves' or as a Qualified Person under NI43-101.  

Table 14.23 present the Indicated Mineral Resource, broken down by weathering 
domains. This indicates: 
• There is a higher proportion of oxide and transitional copper resource at 

Mount Dore South. 

• That Merlin lies below the oxide zone predominantly in fresh rock. 

• The upper metallurgical domain displays some residual copper content based 
on sequential copper analyses and comprises a minor though significant 
proportion of the Mount Dore South mineralisation which may require further 
metallurgical assessment.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 

The Mineral Reserve estimates were prepared after selection of the mining methods 
as described in Section 16. The following factors are relevant to the selection of a 
minimum mining unit (MMU): 

• Ore body geometry including continuity, width and dip. 

• Anticipated ground conditions during mining. 
• Mining method and equipment selection. 

For The Project, the ore body geometry is known to be relatively continuous, with 
narrow to moderate widths, and shallow to moderate dip. For the two main mining 
methods selected (ie DAF and LHOS methods) the following MMUs apply: 

• DAF mining using mechanised mining with 2-boom jumbos requires a profile of 
4.5 m wide x 5.0 m high, with a variable length of drift. The DAF method is able 
to adapt reasonably closely to a variable orebody geometry and the profile is 
largely unaffected by the anticipated ground conditions. 

• LHOS mining using mechanised mining with uphole drilling from 15 m spaced 
levels and applying a minimum stope excavation width of 3.5 m, before 
unplanned over break. Modelling of narrower widths for the stoping was shown 
to be inconsequential, based on the current resource interpretation. For the 
shallow to moderate dip and variable ground conditions, it is expected to be 
difficult to achieve narrower excavations in practice. 

The Datamine Mineable Shape Optimiser (MSO) process was used to apply 
mineable shapes to the resource model. The shapes include 0.5 m of dilution on the 
footwall and 1.5 m of dilution on the hangingwall of the orebody. The mining 
inventory was prepared using the mineralised inventories as follows: 

• Development inventories from the development design wireframes were 
evaluated against the resource block model, with a 98% recovery of the 
Mineral Resource applied. 

• DAF inventories from the MSO inventories inclusive of dilution, with a 97% 
recovery of the Mineral Resource applied.

16 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Geotechnical 

Following an initial high level review and site visit AMC conducted further work to 
provide parameters for use in preliminary mine design. (AMC 110031 
September 2010). 

The work was primarily based on information in the geotechnical drill hole database 
and used in the construction of the May 2010 resource model. The data related the 
four high grade molybdenum orebodies, being 2A, 2B, 2C & 2D. Information in the 
database was reviewed and basic checks made to gain an understanding of the level 
and quality of data prior to inclusion in geotechnical analyses.  

Each of the logged intervals was assigned parameters to characterize the rock mass. 
The rock mass characterization and subsequently defined geotechnical domains 
considered the following: 
• Firstly, consideration was given to the rock mass conditions that impinge on 

stoping. For example the granite will not impinge upon the hangingwall of the 
stoping areas and therefore was not considered in the geotechnical domains. 

• Within the rock mass which might impinge on stoping there were only minor 
variations in lithology. Lithology was not considered in subsequent analyses. 

• Physical characteristics such as weathering and spatial variations were also 
considered as part of the geotechnical domains. Lens 2A was spatially 
extensive and was divided into zones, however, Lens 2B, 2C and 2D were 
restricted spatially and didn't warrant dividing. 

The resulting geotechnical domains were hangingwall, resource and footwall units for 
the different lenses and where appropriate, these were sub-divided by weathering 
and spatial location such as north and south zones. 

In general the weathering and fracturing have resulted in poor rock mass conditions 
in the hangingwall and resource units. A trend can be seen of improving ground 
conditions with an increase in depth and distance from the hangingwall contact of 
Lens 2A. 

Stope stability was assessed using the drilling data in each domain and the 
Matthews Stability Graph method. This resulted in basic stope dimensions for each 
lens to be used in on-going mine design work. 

In the weathered zone very restricted stope dimensions and extensive support are 
required to achieve stable spans. Drift and fill is achievable and more suited to the 
weathered rock mass conditions. Drift and fill may also be required in the parts or all 
of the unweathered zones because the resource rock mass conditions are poor. 

The drift and fill dimensions are based on a 4 to 5m drift height interval are shown in 
Table 16.1.

* Assumes the installation of cablebolts. 

The strike length of the stopes increases with a steeper resource dip in the northern 
zone. The end walls in the resource are currently restricting stope dimensions. 
Longitudinal stoping could be achieved in zones where the resource is less than 6 to 
7 m wide. If a vertical unsupported footwall is required in the resource unit, strike 
length will be restricted to 10 m. 

The Lens 2B and 2C dimensions allow for transverse and longitudinal stoping of a 
greater dimension than currently used in the mine design. 

If an underhand sequence is adopted, the crown values will be replaced with 
dimensions based on pastefill exposure and strength requirements. The Project is 
based on a zone of molybdenum-rhenium mineralisation that occurs as molybdenite, 
hosted in an east-dipping shear and breccia zone, with extremely high-grade portions 
occurring as a molybdenite-supported breccia. Given the high value of the ore 
material, it was considered likely, at an early stage, that maximising ore recovery was 
to be a key attribute of the successful mining system. 

The high grade molybdenum orebody (refer to Figure 16.1) comprises of east dipping 
tabular lenses dipping from 30° to 60°. The main lens (5) is a large, moderate dipping 
and generally narrow lens, with two minor footwall lenses (6 and 7) that are steeper

AMC 111041 : October 2011 149 

dipping and thicker, and a minor Little Wizard (LW) lens (4) that is a very high grade, 
up-plunge pod. 

The host rock sequence is highly variable and is weathered in the upper levels, and 
contains rocks with very poor to fair rock strengths. The footwall rock sequence is 
mostly competent. The mine access including decline system and ventilation system 
is planned to be constructed mostly within the competent footwall rock sequence.

Aug '10 Model) 

 

16.2 Stoping Methods 

The mining methods considered included: 

• Open pit. 

• Caving methods. 

• Unsupported methods. 
• Supported methods. 

An open pit for all or part of The Project is considered possible. Evaluation showed 
that while technically and financially possible the pit option has a very high stripping 
ratio of 83:1, involves a total material movement of 429 Mt, and can only sustain the 
targeted mill feed rate with use of substantial ROM stockpiles in some years.

The caving methods of mining are considered unsuitable due to the orebody being of 
insufficient size to consider the block caving method, and the unacceptable risk of 
excessive dilution due to the poor ground conditions. 

The unsupported methods are considered unsuitable due to the generally poor 
ground conditions and the project requirement for high recovery of the high value 
ore. 

The supported methods of mining identified were: 

• Mechanised development stoping - includes mechanised cut and fill stoping 
and drift and fill stoping, (includes overhand and underhand sequences). Both 
are considered suitable for a variety of orebody conditions and geometry. 

• Blast hole bench stoping - includes benching and Avoca stoping overhand 
methods. Benching is suitable for moderate to steep dipping, narrow orebody 
sections with widths of less than 10 m. 

• Blast hole open stoping - includes Longhole Open Stoping (LHOS), Sublevel 
Open Stoping (SLOS), Vertical Crater Retreat (VCR), Alimak, Raise & Slashing 
variations, up and down holes, overhand and underhand methods. Generally 
not suited to poor ground conditions. SLOS generally not suitable for shallow 
dipping, narrow orebodies. 

Given the generally very poor ground conditions within the host rock sequence, it 
was resolved that only mining methods comprising small openings and using 
consolidated backfill were appropriate for further consideration. 

Therefore, the appropriate methods were determined to include: 

• Drift and Fill mining (DAF). 

• Small-scale long hole open stoping (LHOS) with cemented fill. 

DAF (refer to Figure 16.2) was chosen as the preferred method for mining in very 
poor ground and in flatter sections of the high grade orebody. Small-scale LHOS was 
chosen as the preferred method of mining in fair to good ground at moderate to steep 
dips. The LHOS may be longitudinal in narrow sections and change to transverse 
orientation in wide sections of the orebody. An underhand mining sequence (from 
top-down) was chosen as the default sequence.

Figure 16.2 High Underhand DAF Mining in a Narrow Orebody 

 

A Strategy Optimisation (SO) study using comparative assessment techniques was 
performed to determine suitable mining parameters, such as Cut-off Value (COV), 
mining system selection and production rate. The SO optimised the value of The 
Project, taking into account the constraints imposed by key information for resource, 
geotechnical conditions, mining productivities, metallurgical performance, cost and 
financial assumptions. Based on the assumptions and criteria applied, underhand 
small-scale LHOS mining was shown to provide the highest value if this mining 
method could be implemented on a mine wide basis, with small scale LHOS used 
where geotechnical conditions permit. 

16.3 Mine Design 

The underground mine was designed to suit modern trackless mining, using the DAF 
and LHOS mining methods. The PFS mine design was prepared for the purpose of 
enabling further decisions to be made and included optionality in the design, as 
follows: 

• Case 1: DAF mining method for all lenses and all mining blocks. 

• Case 2: DAF mining in main lens, with predominantly transverse LHOS mining 
in footwall lenses in mining blocks C & D. 

• Case 3: DAF mining in south main lens only, with transverse LHOS mining in 
footwall lenses in mining blocks C & D, and longitudinal LHOS in north main 
lens in mining blocks E, F, G & H. 

Case 2 was selected as the basis for mineral reserve estimation and further work. A 
common decline access and ventilation infrastructure development system will suit 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 152 

the three mine design cases. Figure 16.3 shows the Case 2 mine design with the 
common decline and ventilation infrastructure. The mine was divided into nine mining 
blocks (Little Wizard plus blocks A-H) for scheduling purposes. 

Based on the objective of targeting the maximum recovery of economic ore, a break 
even cut-off was applied in preparing the PFS mine designs and schedules. The 
application of an optimal cut-off should be reviewed following further detailed studies. 

The cut-offs applied to the PFS mine designs and schedules +were: 

• DAF ore mining, ore handling and ore processing at A$ 200 /t. 

• LHOS ore mining, ore handling and ore processing at A$ 150 /t. 

Figure 16.3 Case 2 Mine Design Layout 

 

16.4 Mining Schedule 

The mining schedule was prepared assuming a top-down mining system is employed 
in all mining areas, as follows: 
• DAF mining assuming 40 m/mth average advance (including backfill) rate per 

available ore heading, based on a single level, centre-out sequence. 

• Longitudinal LHOS assuming 420 t/d stoping rate (including backfill, excluding 
development) based on a single level, 2 stope end-retreat sequence. 

• Transverse LHOS assuming 600 t/d stoping rate (including backfill, excluding 
development), based on a single level, 2 stope centre-out sequence. 

The mining schedule was prepared using the Earthworks Production Scheduler 
(EPS) software with input information prepared in Mine2-4D and Excel. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 153 

The mine designs were evaluated in EPS on 15 m vertical increments to align with 
the sublevel interval. All scheduling was based on activities accumulated within each 
15 m increment, based the north and south mining areas. 

The following assumptions apply to the schedule: 

• Commencement of the surface decline on 1 October 2010 (completed). 

• The schedule was prepared on a quarterly (3 monthly) basis. 
• There are no external constraints applied to the schedule, and all activities are 

able to start when available to do so. 

• Where multiple lenses occur on a level, DAF mining is assumed to be able to 
operate concurrently on adjacent lenses, although in practice this may involve 
multiple levels. 

• Decline development is scheduled to occur "as soon as possible" (ASAP). 

• Production is scheduled to occur ASAP. 
• Waste and ore drives are scheduled to occur "as late as possible" (ALAP). 

The resultant production schedule is shown in Figure 16.4. Ore is sourced from 60% 
DAF mining, 8% development, and 32% LHOS. All mining blocks are opened up 
quickly and production reaches 150 kt/a in 2012, 300 kt/a in 2013 before reaching full 
production of about 500 kt/a in 2014. The peak rate of 500 kt/a or above is 
maintained for about ten years and is generally able to be maintained whilst the high 
productivity footwall lens (6 & 7) stoping blocks are producing and then falls away 
rapidly thereafter.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Process Plant Design Criteria 

The process design criteria are primarily a compilation of data from the results of 
bench test work programs, vendor and independent consultants and information 
supplied by IVA. Jacobs provided additional engineering design criteria from their 
past experience on similar applications. Where test work results were unavailable, 
assumed data was used. 

The majority of the concentrate treatment area design criteria were sourced from the 
experience of independent consultants as only limited test work has been completed 
to date. Given that insufficient concentrate sample was available to undertake 
extensive roasting test work within the project schedule, the process design criteria 
for each of the concentrate treatment areas relies on the experience of those who 
have operated these processes. 

Jacobs database was referenced where no other data were available. The following 
is a summary of the process plant design criteria. 

17.1.1 General 

Annual ore throughput, operating schedules and plant availabilities were agreed with 
IVA and reflect best practice for each of the operating areas. The annual ore 
throughput is limited by the mining rate. 

17.1.2 Ore Blending 

Head grades of the ore reflect the expected average ore grade. As the mine plan 
evolves and variability is better understood, the design ore grade and its implications 
on the plant design should be reviewed. 

Ore mineralogy was extrapolated, using the most recent head grades, from the 
mineralogical assessment of the four major lithologies (AMMTEC, 2009). 

The run-of-mine (ROM) ore physical properties were based on similar ore types. 

17.1.3 Crushing 

Metallurgical design parameters for the crushing properties of the ore were taken 
from the crushing test work report (AMMTEC, 2009). Samples of each of the four 
major lithologies were subjected to a series of tests to determine the unconfined 
compression strength (UCS) and Bond abrasion index (Ai), along with the Bond rod 
and ball mill work indices. The crushing parameters are a summary of a Bruno 
crushing model prepared by Metso (2009). 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 156 

17.1.4 Grinding  

As with crushing, the grinding metallurgical parameters were taken from the 2009 
AMMTEC crushing report. A conservative Bond ball mill index was used for the 
design of the mill to ensure this area does not become a process bottleneck. 

17.1.5 Flotation 

The flotation design criteria are the culmination of flotation test work findings from the 
2010 laboratory program undertaken at Metcon (2011, 3 reports). A scale up factor of 
2 between the laboratory and plant residence times was used for the study, however 
this will be reviewed in the next phase to ensure sufficient residence time is available 
to achieve the desired metal recoveries. 

A conservative concentrate grade of 30% molybdenum was used for the design. This 
ensures sufficient capacity in the flotation cells and maximum volume of concentrate 
to be roasted. 

17.1.6 Services & Tailings 

Thickening test work had not been undertaken at the time of writing the Metcon 
(2011) reports. Similar settling characteristics to the existing Osborne material were 
assumed, giving an underflow density of 70% as advised by Metago Environmental 
Engineers, who are designing the tailings storage facility.  

Subsequent to the Metcon report, tailings settling testwork has been undertaken 
which indicates that the PFS assumptions are valid and will not require a material 
change to the design. The final results will be incorporated into the detailed design of 
the plant. Existing Osborne services will be used where possible. 

17.1.7 Concentrate Handling 

The settling and filtration characteristics of the molybdenum concentrate were based 
on testing by Pocock Industrial. Drying properties of the molybdenum concentrate 
were assumed based on the experience of EHP Consulting Inc. These assumptions 
will be reviewed as further test data becomes available. 

It has been assumed that the copper concentrate produced will be directed to the 
existing copper concentrate thickener, with this thickener having adequate capacity 
to handle the additional small volume of material. 

17.1.8 Roaster & Off Gas Handling 

The roaster design criteria were provided by EHP Consulting Inc based on their 
operating experience. Only limited roasting test work has been undertaken on small 
samples. 

The design allows for a much higher temperature in the lower hearths of the roaster 
to promote maximum rhenium volatilisation and recovery to the off gas. The off gas 
handling system has been designed with the aim of maximising rhenium recovery. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 157 

Bearing this in mind, wet scrubbing of the off-gas directly from the roaster was 
selected to minimise the recirculation and potential rhenium losses expected from a 
dry dust collection system that is more typically seen in this application. The solids 
collected in the wet scrubbing system are likely to be fine and hard to settle, hence a 
conservative approach has been taken to thickener design. 

A wet sulphuric acid production plant has been selected for the duty of SO2 removal 
prior to release of gas to the atmosphere. Without a sulphuric acid plant a lime 
scrubber would be required. 

17.1.9 Rhenium Recovery 

The rhenium recovery design criteria, including solvent extraction, ion exchange, 
rhenium evaporation and crystallisation, product drying and packaging, were 
generated by EHP Consulting Inc based on their operating experience. No test work 
has been completed in this area. 

The ion exchange design criteria may be considered conservative as the new 
generation resins which are much more selective against molybdenum were not 
selected, opting instead for a resin with more history on loading capacity in 
production facilities. 

17.1.10 Calcine Leach & Molybdenum Recovery 

The calcine leach and molybdenum recovery design criteria were provided by EHP 
Consulting Inc based on operating experience. Only limited leach test work has been 
undertaken on small calcined samples to confirm complete molybdenum dissolution 
can be achieved. The final molybdenum trioxide product will be packed in 1 tonne 
bags for sale. 

17.2 Process Plant Design 

Jacobs E & C Australia Pty Ltd (Jacobs) was engaged to determine process plant 
requirements, together with capital and operating costs of the process plants to an 
accuracy of -20% +30% for a treatment rate of 500,000 t/a of ore using IVA specified 
average head grades of 1.2% molybdenum, 0.2% copper and 18 g/t rhenium, where 
the molybdenum is present as molybdenite, and copper as chalcopyrite. 

The Jacobs process plant engineering study (Report 11402-00-G0712 Rev P1) was 
completed in December 2010 and progressively updated in 2011. The PFS report 
and this Technical Report are based on the Rev P3 update of February 2011. 

The capital cost estimate for the process plant was based on process flow sheets 
and the attendant plant requirements to produce saleable products of molybdenum, 
copper with silver credits, and rhenium as ammonium perhennate. 

The operating cost estimate was based on labour, power, consumables and 
maintenance to operate the aforementioned process plants. 

The flow sheet for the process plant engineering study is divided into three sections: 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 158 

• Crushing (Figure 17.1). 

• Concentrate Production (Figure 17.2). 

• Concentrate Treatment (Figure 17.3). 

The crushing facilities are located at The Project mine site and consist of a Run of 
Mine (ROM) ore pad, three stages of crushing, and a fine ore stockpile. 

The concentrate production facilities are located at Osborne and consist of a fine ore 
stockpile, ball mill, rougher, scavenger and cleaner flotation to produce a bulk 
sulphide concentrate. This is followed by concentrate regrind and copper depression 
flotation stages to produce both molybdenum and copper concentrates. The 
molybdenum concentrate is thickened, filtered and dried. 

The concentrate treatment facility is to be located adjacent to the concentrate 
production facility at Osborne. The facility consists of a concentrate roaster and off-
gas scrubbing system including a sulphuric acid production plant, together with 
hydrometallurgical plants to purify the molybdenum and rhenium to saleable grade 
products. Note that in Figure 17.3 the strip solution from the SX advances to IX as 
shown, and the raffinate is neutralised and disposed of (not shown). The strip 
solution from the IX advances to crystallization as shown, and the barren solution 
advances to the calcine leach or recycles to the quench tower (not shown). 

The processing plants are supported by utility and ancillary facilities. Utilities include, 
water treatment facilities, compressed air, along with reagent mixing and dosing 
systems. Power will be provided from the Osborne power station. Site ancillaries for 
the Osborne site include an administration building, maintenance workshops, a 
canteen and change house, laboratory, store, and domestic waste treatment 
facilities. 

Key process plant parameters are outlined in Table 17.1. 

Table 17.1 Key Process Plant Parameters 
Key Design Parameters Value Unit 

Total ROM ore feed 500,000 dt/a 
Molybdenum grade, ROM ore 1.1 wt%

Molybdenum production 5,030 t/a 
Overall molybdenum recovery 84.5 % 
Rhenium production 7.209 dt/a 
Overall rhenium recovery 80.9 % 

A number of option studies were undertaken, all based on modifying the existing 
Osborne plant to produce molybdenum concentrate and allowing for spare capacity 
to treat copper/gold ore which may be mined. As the modification required to the 
existing processing plant would result in reducing the capacity of the copper/gold 
circuit, IVA directed that a new and separate molybdenum concentrate circuit was to 
be constructed at Osborne, so as not to impact on the capacity of the existing 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED

AMC 111041 : October 2011 159 

copper/gold circuit. This involved the following changes to the Options Study 
facilities: 

At Merlin 

• ROM pad, crushing facilities and ore handling facilities. 

• Crushed ore transported to Osborne. 

At Osborne 
• Crushed ore delivery and stockpiled on existing ROM pad. 

• Ore reclaim and conveying to new ball mill. 

• New flotation, concentrate filtering, storage and load-out. 

• Tailings dewatering. 

• Concentrate treatment facility and associated services and utilities. 

The crushing facilities located at the Merlin mine site consist of a ROM ore pad, three 
stages of crushing, and a fine ore stockpile.  

The concentrate production facility located at Osborne consist of a ball mill, rougher, 
scavenger and cleaner flotation to produce a bulk sulphide concentrate, followed by 
concentrate regrind and copper depression flotation stages to produce both 
molybdenum and copper concentrates. The molybdenum concentrate is thickened, 
filtered and dried ready for transfer to the concentrate treatment plant. 

The concentrate treatment facility consists of a concentrate roaster and off-gas 
scrubbing system incorporating a sulphuric acid production plant, along with 
hydrometallurgical plants to purify the molybdenum and rhenium to saleable grade 
products. 

The process plant is not innovative and there are several examples of similar plants 
in commercial operation: 

• The ore preparation circuit is designed to treat 500,000 t/a dry ore. There is no 
design margin applied to the mill design capacity. Run-of-Mine (ROM) ore is 
transported 50 km by truck to the concentrate production plant. 

• Approximately 18,000 dt/a of molybdenum concentrate is produced in the 
concentrate production plant. The concentrate contains 30% molybdenum. 

• The concentrate treatment facility includes roasting of the sulphide concentrate 
to produce a molybdenum calcine. 

• The roaster is designed to treat a total of 18,000 dt/a in a single roaster. 

• The downstream calcine leach is designed to treat 15,000 dt/a. 
• The average power load for the crusher at the Merlin mine site is 600 kW, and 

for the Osborne concentrator (including the ball mill) and roaster plant are 
2,500 kW and 1,500 kW respectively. 

• The process plant water requirement is 72 m3/h. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

Significant new plant and infrastructure will be established at the brownfield Merlin 
mine site to support the underground mine. Ore from the Merlin mine site will be 
crushed on site and hauled to Osborne for treatment in a new molybdenum / rhenium 
treatment facility. The run of mine (ROM) pad for Merlin mine site will be located in 
the area north of decline boxcut and the existing haul road between the Mount Dore 
Copper Heap Leach Project and Merlin mine site. The design of these facilities will 
form part of the Feasibility Study and should include: 

• Surface infrastructure and facilities: 

- Administration office complex. 

- Heavy vehicle workshop. 

- Hydrocarbon storage facility. 

- Light vehicle workshop. 
- Wash down bay. 

- Refuelling bay. 

- Settling ponds. 

- Box-cut services pad. 

• Underground infrastructure and facilities: 

- Electrical distribution. 

- Primary dewatering system. 

- Primary ventilation system. 
- Refuelling bay. 

- Service bay. 

- Magazine. 

- Communications. 

Power supply to the underground workings will come from an overhead feeder which 
will terminate adjacent to the surface portal. 

Studies undertaken for PFS purposes indicate a maximum demand of 8.0 MVA at an 
11 kV supply voltage. 

The ventilation circuit for the mine will consist of two major intake airways, the Main 
Decline and Fresh Air Raise, and two major exhaust airways, the North Return Air 
Raise and South Return Air Raise. The mine will be divided into two separate, 
ventilation districts, North and South, although there will be some limited interaction 
between the two districts along connected foot wall drives and shared intake airways. 
The PFS work indicated a total mine airflow requirement of 460 m3/s.

NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 165 

The water supply for the mine is assumed to be provided by a bore field adjacent to 
the Merlin mine site. Estimates prepared as part of the PFS suggested that the mine 
demand for process water will be 13 l/s. 

Water pumped from the mine will be treated in surface settling ponds and be 
available for reuse or transfer to evaporation ponds for disposal. 

18.1 Paste Plant 

Besides the mining operations and associated infrastructure listed above the Merlin 
mine site will include a paste fill backfill plant. This plant will be a new dry paste fill 
plant or the relocated existing Osborne paste plant if it is not required for ongoing 
mining operations at Osborne. There is a sufficient supply of dry tailings at Osborne 
and at nearby old Starra tailings dams for making backfill at the Merlin mine site. The 
Merlin mine site paste backfill plant will have a rated capacity of 144 m3/h processing 
approximately 250 t/h of tailings. Tailings could be backhauled from Osborne in the 
trucks used to haul ore to Osborne. The feasibility study will include further work on 
the selection of a backfill option. 

The paste plant will be located on top of the proposed mine workings at about mid 
distance along orebody strike in order to enable gravity delivery of paste fill to most 
of the mining areas. This will position the plant on the eastern side of the quartzite 
ridge, above the underground production areas. The final plant location will be 
determined in future studies. 

Paste fill will be delivered underground by gravity through one of the two inclined 
175 m long cased 200 mm NB surface boreholes and a series of internal boreholes 
and level distribution pipelines. Little Wizard and upper south areas will have their 
own borehole which will receive paste fill by agitator trucks. 

The paste production system is simple. Harvested dry tailings will be fed to a dry 
paste backfill plant similar to the one at Osborne using a front-end loader. Tailings 
will be repulped and mixed with cement. These dry system paste plants are 
essentially "off the shelf", have short delivery times and will require up to six months 
to commission. The paste backfill plant at Osborne has been in use for three years 
only and is in very good condition. If future operations at Osborne will not require 
paste backfill then it may be more cost effective to relocate the plant to the Merlin 
mine site. 

18.2 Infrastructure 

Infrastructure is required to support The Project, both at the Mount Dore/Merlin mine 
site area and at the Osborne site. The infrastructure components include power, 
water supply, aerodrome, accommodation villages and communications. 

18.2.1 Electric Power 

• Power by contract generation, approx 10 MW. This will be a gas-fired power 
station supplying power at 11 kV, with the gas trucked from Osborne. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 166 

• Power supply to the underground workings will come from an overhead feeder 
which will terminate adjacent to the surface portal. 

• Power quality equipment (eg: harmonic filters and power factor correction) will 
be provided at the mine site instead of back at the power station. This will 
provide flexibility of supplying future loads by the same power station. Provision 
will be made for expanding the power station to enable supply to other future 
mines if required. 

• The existing power station at Osborne will be refurbished/upgraded to provide 
24 MW. 

18.2.2 Other Infrastructure 

Other infrastructure required at Mount Dore/Merlin mine site includes: 

• Water supply from nearby boreholes. 

• The existing aerodrome will be used for small charter aircraft commuter flights 
primarily from Mount Isa and for medical evacuation where necessary. 

• A microwave dish will be installed to provide a link to the Osborne site.  

The infrastructure facilities to support the Osborne site will include: 

• Water supply will be from the existing borefields at the Longsight sandstone 
aquifer. 

• The existing Osborne aerodrome will be used for fly in fly out commuter 
services and for medical evacuation. 

• Accommodation is provided by a 320 room village 4 km south of the Osborne 
mine. An additional 132 man contractors camp is also available. 

• Mining personnel will commute daily to the Merlin mine site at Mount Dore. 

• The Osborne site is serviced by a microwave link that connects into the 
national grid. A mobile radio installation is being constructed to allow for mobile 
phone usage around the Osborne site.  

18.3 Tailings and Effluent Management 

Metago Environmental Engineers (Australia) Pty Ltd (Metago) prepared a report on 
tailings and effluent management for the PFS. 

At Osborne, high density tailings (HDT) were deposited on Tailings Storage Facility 2 
(TSF2) from 2002 up to cessation of the Barrick Osborne operations in 2010. This 
facility has approximately 100,000 m3 of capacity remaining for tailings storage. 

IVA proposes to process copper ores mined from Kulthor, Lucky Luke and other 
orebodies at a rate of 1.5 Mt/a for 9 years. It is proposed that management of the 
tailings continue to be at high density in light of the cost and water savings previously 
demonstrated at Osborne. Assuming a density of 1.8 t/m3 for HDT, the capacity 
required for the copper tailings is 5 Mm3 which means that additional tailings storage 
capacity is required for the copper tailings. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 167 

Processing of molybdenum ore from The Project is proposed to be at a rate of 0.5 
Mt/a for 16 years and, given the benefits in cost and water savings, it is proposed 
that these tailings will also be managed as a high density slurry. At a density of 1.8 
t/m3 the volume of molybdenum tailings that need to be stored is 4.5 Mm3. A new 
storage facility for these tailings will also be required. 

Three options were considered: 
• Option 1 - A new HDT facility located on immediately west of TSF1. 

• Option 2 - A new HDT facility located between TSF1 and TSF2. 

• Option 3 - An expansion of TSF2 to the south and west, together with the 
relocation of the current return water dam. 

The concept-level study assessed the long term deposition layout and embankment 
development to contain the HDT for the copper and molybdenum scenarios 
proposed. The conceptual design includes: 
• New containment bunds for each scenario, sized and positioned to contain the 

required tailings volumes. 

• Stormwater, seepage and collection channels where deemed necessary to 
allow free movement of seepage and runoff water from the facility as well as to 
keep 'clean' and 'dirty' runoff separated. 

• Spillways and spillway locations based on bund alignment. 

• A contributing catchment assessment of the storage requirements for the 
proposed new reclaim dam. 

• Pipework including the length of the tailings delivery pipelines and the reclaim 
water pipeline from the reclaim pond to the plant. 

• A complete set of conceptual level drawings for each option. 

• A schedule of quantities and a cost estimate for all potential options. 

From these assessments, Table 18.1 shows the cost (A$) per m3 of tailings material 
deposited for the potential TSF's Options.

With respect to gypsum and effluent management facilities at a potential smelter in 
Townsville, Metago developed a concept level design for the gypsum evaporation 
facility to assess the feasibility of evaporating effluent at Townsville. In addition, a 
comparison of evaporation facility requirements at Townsville compared with 
Osborne was made. The assessment of the gypsum storage facility included: 

• Sizing of a three year storage of gypsum and ammonia leach in a contained 
storage pad. 

• Preparation of a schedule of quantities for the storage pad. 

A similar assessment was made of an effluent evaporation facility. While it was 
concluded that the gypsum storage costs will be similar for either Townsville or 
Osborne locations, the higher evaporation potential at Osborne results in a smaller 
and hence lower-cost facility. 

18.4 Personnel 

The implementation of construction of the process plants, infrastructure and haul 
road will be undertaken by the Owner's team supervising the engineering company 
under an EPCM contract or other contract defined during the Feasibility Study stage. 

Once constructed, The Project will be managed by a General Manager Operations 
responsible for managing two separate operations: 

• Mining copper/gold sulphide ores at Osborne and processing the ore through 
the existing 2 Mt/a Osborne processing plant. 

• Mining the Merlin mine site molybdenum/rhenium ore and processing the ore 
through a new 500,000 t/a flotation plant and roasting plant at Osborne. 

Both copper/gold and molybdenum/rhenium operations will use shared services for 
geology, mining, processing, maintenance, administration and health safety and 
environment. Operating costs for these shared services are proportioned 50:50 
between the two operations. 

The mining workforce for the initial decline development at the Merlin mine site is 
being provided by a contractor. The PFS assumes that the development and 
operation of the mine will be by IVA. The peak workforce for the mine is estimated at 
180 employees and contractors with an average of around 160 personnel. The 
processing and maintenance workforce is estimated at 85 employees for concentrate 
production and 51 employees for concentrate treatment.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

19.1 Marketing Studies 

The Project is unusual with respect to the grades of molybdenum and rhenium and 
has a number of attributes which make it unusual in a geological sense. This will 
strongly impact on the marketing strategy that is to be adopted. These attributes are: 

• The Project's  average mine grade is 1.1 % molybdenum and 19 g/t rhenium 
compared to the Henderson Mine (USA) grade of 0.2% molybdenum which has 
been considered the world's highest grade molybdenum mine. 

• The rhenium in the Merlin deposit represents the first direct source of rhenium 
in the world and is not a typical by-product rhenium produced by convoluted 
molybdenum by-product streams via primary copper flotation. 

• The Project production represents approximately 3.5% of the world output of 
molybdenum and approximately 15% of the world production of rhenium. 

• The Project rhenium can be marketed as "secure supply". 

19.2 Molybdenum 

As part of this economic evaluation, IVA commissioned a report on the outlook for 
molybdenum and rhenium markets from Roskill (2011). The following discussion 
regarding the molybdenum market has been sourced from that report. 

While the market for molybdenum is transparent and well understood, the rhenium 
market is opaque, shadowy and small. These factors will affect how the products are 
marketed. 

Molybdenum is used primarily as an alloying agent in steels. Molybdenum enhances 
wear resistance, toughness and corrosion resistance in steels. It is also used as a 
catalyst for some chemical reactions. In the sulphide form of molybdenite it is used 
as a lubricant and in the oxide form used for pigments, tool steels, super alloys, cast 
iron, welding alloys, high strength low alloy steels and stainless steels. 

Molybdenum concentrates are either processed to the oxide by companies with their 
own roasting plants or sold to toll treatment roasting operators. They are normally 
sold on long term contracts and occasionally on spot. Spot sales rise when there is a 
high demand for the product. The molybdenum price has been low up until 2003 
when the price increased substantially then dropped in the GFC. The price is now 
recovering to around the US$ 15-18 /lb range. 

Between August 2008 and March 2009 molybdenum prices, responding to the global 
financial crisis and downturn in world economies, fell from US$34 /lb to US$8 /lb. In 
2010 prices recovered to US$16 /lb Mo. Until the financial crisis, prices had risen in 
response to supply limitations and growing demand, principally in China. In the next 
five years the molybdenum market will resume the growth in the years to mid-2008, 
with consumption expected to grow by 5% per year for the period 2011 to 2015. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 171 

In 2011, a recovery in global economies saw production of mined molybdenum reach 
a record high of 225 kt, an increase of 12% year-on-year, having declined by around 
6% in 2009. The increase in production in 2010 took place across producing 
countries, with output rising by 10% in China, and 26% in the USA. Prior to this, 
global output had increased strongly. For the period 2000 to 2008, production 
increased by an annual average rate of 5% per year. 

Molybdenum production is concentrated in a relatively few countries, with China, the 
USA and Chile accounting for almost 80% of total world production in 2010. Chinese 
molybdenum production was the largest in the world from 2002 to 2004 but fell 
sharply in 2005 because of government-enforced mines closures. It then more than 
doubled between 2005 and 2008, to regain its leading position. In 2010 Chinese 
output was 80 kt, rising by 10% over 2009. 

The ten largest producing companies accounted for 65% of world molybdenum mine 
production in 2010. Freeport McMoran in the USA and Codelco in Chile were the 
largest producers, together accounting for 23% in 2010. 

Consumption 

Consumption of molybdenum is also estimated to have risen by around 12% in 2010, 
as improving economic sentiment has seen demand for all commodities rise. 
Demand at the world level has increased faster than that of mine supply. For the 
period 2000 to 2008, when global consumption was at its largest, demand rose by an 
average of 5.4% per year. 

China's domestic economy continued to grow during the global recession, with the 
result that it became the world's largest consumer of molybdenum. In 2010, Chinese 
consumption was 60 kt, accounting for almost 30% of the world total. 

Molybdenum is consumed mainly as the oxide or ferromolybdenum in stainless and 
low alloy steels. Estimated worldwide demand for molybdenum by application in 
2010 is shown in Table 19.1.

Prices 

Between August 2008 and March 2009 the price of molybdenum oxide fell from 
US$34.50 /lbMo to a low of US$8 /lbMo, and that of ferromolybdenum fell from 
US$81.50 /kgMo to US$20.50 /kgMo, levels not seen since early 2002. 

Cutbacks by major producers, and demand in China remaining strong, resulted in 
tightening of supplies and a weak rally of molybdenum prices, which had doubled by 
July 2009 to peak at US$18 /lbMo for oxide and US$40 /kgMo for ferromolybdenum. 

During 2010, molybdenum prices remained stable, without much volatility. Oxide 
prices in Europe averaged US$16 /lbMo, with ferromolybdenum prices averaging 
US$40 /kgMo. In the first seven months of 2011, prices rose slightly, averaging 
US$16.67 /lbMo and US$40.96 /kgMo, for oxide and ferromolybdenum respectively. 

Market Outlook 

With the decline in prices in late 2008, many new mining projects were slowed or 
suspended. With more than thirty molybdenum mine projects with combined capacity 
of about 136 ktpa at some level of feasibility assessment, longer term supply appears 
to be assured.  

Over the next five years, around 140 kt of new roasting capacity is expected to come 
online, of which around 60 kt will be located in China. This will raise world capacity to 
more than 400 ktpa, which is more than sufficient on a global basis. 

Demand for molybdenum is expected to grow at above 5% per year up to 2016, 
driven primarily by 7% per year growth in China. Production of stainless, carbon and 
alloy steel is expected to increase strongly throughout the forecast period. 

The outlook for molybdenum prices up to 2016 is one of some volatility. In 2011 and 
2012 prices are likely to firm towards US$18 /lb as demand increases at a faster 
pace than new supply. As the market moves into deficit after 2013, prices will rise to 
around US$30 /lb.

19.3 Rhenium 

The following discussion regarding the rhenium market has been sourced from the 
Roskill report (Roskill, 2011) on the outlook for the molybdenum and rhenium 
markets. 

Rhenium has the unique property that, when alloyed, it improves mechanical 
strength and reduces plastic deformation at elevated temperatures and as such is 
used in a number of high temperature applications including: 

• Aerospace applications such as turbine blades and other static parts. 

• Rocket thruster elements. 

• Reforming catalysts for the petroleum industry. 

• Small high temperature applications such as crucibles, electrical contacts, 
electromagnets, electron tubes, heating elements, ionization gauges, mass 
spectrographs, semiconductors, temperature controls, thermocouples and 
vacuum tubes. 

• Medical applications. 

Over 80% of rhenium is used in the aerospace industry in single crystal nickel 
superalloy turbine blades operating in the high temperature zone of the engine. 

Rhenium addition to the alloys allows the turbines to be operated at higher 
temperatures without creeping. It therefore is a major contributor to improved fuel 
efficiencies of jet engines over the past ten years and the use of rhenium in jet 
turbines is expected to increase substantially in future. Rhenium is sold in the form of 
ammonium perrhenate (APR), which has the chemical formula NH4ReO4. 

Rhenium prices have settled down after the volatility and high prices seen in 2008. 
The credit crisis and associated recession in the major economies (China excepted) 
burst the rhenium 'bubble' and prices plummeted. Prices fell back to US$4,000 /kg 
after averaging just over US$6,000 /kg in 2009, almost half of the average spot price 
in 2008. 

In Roskill's rhenium report published in mid-2010 (Roskill, 2010), rhenium prices 
were forecast to average between US$4,000 and US$4,250 /kg in 2010 and between 
US$4,750 and US$5,500 /kg in 2011 as the market recovered from the steep drop in 
2009.As shown in Table 19.3, the average price for rhenium metal in 2010 was 
US$4,300 /kg, which was close to the figure forecast. However, in the first 6 months 
of 2011, rhenium prices have averaged US$4,250 /kg, significantly below the figure 
forecast in Roskill's 2010 report. Even allowing for a slight recovery in rhenium prices 
in the second half of 2011, the 2011 average is unlikely to top US$4,500 /kg, which is 
still 10 to15% lower than the original Roskill forecast. 

It appears that the rhenium market has found a new equilibrium level at between 
US$4,000 and US$5,000 /kg. This is still significantly higher than the contract prices 
recorded in Chile in the 2010 report, although as contracts are renewed the 
disconnect between spot and contract prices has narrowed considerably. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 174 

Compared to the forecasts made in the 2010 report, Roskill does not expect to see 
any significant changes to the forecast supply/demand balance in the remainder of 
the forecast period. On the demand side, the catalysts market continues to exhibit 
steady growth, as predicted. The aerospace sector is cyclical and a flattening out in 
demand was expected in 2012, while high oil prices may also have a dampening 
effect on demand for air travel with a knock on effect for the superalloy industry. 
Moves by some consumers, such as GE, to reduce or even remove rhenium from 
superalloys appear to have had a limited effect on demand to date. 

On the supply side, there would appear to be sufficient refining capacity on-line and 
in the pipeline to cope with the forecast growth in demand to 2016. However, the 
quantities of rhenium in concentrates may continue to be a constraining factor. A 
significant future source of rhenium units could come from increased recycling in the 
superalloy industry. However, the organisation of recycling in the industry is still 
somewhat haphazard and with rhenium prices at much lower levels than 2 years ago 
the incentive is slightly less pressing. 

It appears that the Roskill forecasts made in 2010 were a little on the bullish side and 
given that prices in 2011 are likely to be 15% or more lower than forecast in the 2010 
report, we have adjusted our forecasts for 2012 to 2016 accordingly. As we expect 
the forward supply/demand curve to be similar to the 2010 forecast, the future price 
trends for rhenium are forecast to be similar, albeit at a slightly lower level.

The marketing strategy is to sell the molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) in long term supply 
contracts and on the spot market, while the bulk of the APR would be sold in a long 
term supply agreement with aerospace engine manufacturers. Production peaks will 
be sold on the spot market. 

The PFS includes an option to sell concentrate to a toll roasting outfit and not build a 
roaster and rhenium recovery plant.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 175 

The base case for the PFS is to produce all of the molybdenum rhenium concentrate 
at 30% Mo grade. Provided the ore can be mined selectively, it will be possible to 
produce two grades of molybdenum rhenium concentrates. 

• A high grade product of >50% Mo grade representing 60% of the molybdenum 
production. 

• A medium grade product of 30% Mo grade representing 40% of the 
molybdenum production. 

These two sulphide concentrate products have different cost structures for sale or toll 
treatment. The following assumptions were made: 

Concentrate Grade > 50% Molybdenum 
• Processing Cost US$ 0.65 - 0.75 /lb Mo (assume US$ 0.70 /lb for this study). 

• Metal Return 99% Molybdenum payable. 

• Rhenium   ~10% metal return. 

Concentrate Grade ~30% Molybdenum 
• Processing Cost US$ 1.50 /lb Molybdenum. 

• Metal Return 93% Molybdenum payable. 

• Rhenium  ~10% metal return. 

19.4 Contracts 

AMC is aware of the following contracts and understands that they have been 
awarded or will be awarded on normal commercial terms. 

19.4.1 Mining 

The box cut and exploration decline was started under contract in the fourth quarter 
of 2010. The scope of work is to access the Merlin orebody at the end of the second 
quarter of 2012. Development to the orebody and extraction of ore will then 
commence around the third quarter of 2012. This timetable sets the time to 
implement construction and commissioning of the crushing and flotation plants to be 
available by the third quarter of 2012. 

The decline was adjacent to the Little Wizard orebody in late June 2011 and this now 
permits an access to be driven to start trial mining of Little Wizard. Ore recovered 
from this orebody will be stockpiled until the concentrator is available to process the 
ore. Work is being undertaken by an experienced mining contractor, managed by the 
IVA Operations staff. 

19.4.2 Haul Road Access to Osborne 

A 53 km long haul road is planned to join the Merlin mine site with the Osborne 
treatment plant. A redesign is under way to reduce the cost and improve construction 
efficiency. No contract has yet been awarded. Construction time is approximately 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 176 

10 months depending on the timing of the wet season at the end of the year. It is 
proposed that road construction will be implemented by one civil contractor and 
managed by an IVA team reporting to the IVA Project Group. 

19.4.3 Power Station 

The existing power station at Osborne includes five diesel/gas Wartsila 3.85 MW low 
speed and one 100% gas Jenbacher 3.35 MW medium speed generators. The 
Wartsila engines require major overhauls and conversion to 99% gas usage. IVA 
expected to let contracts in July 2011 for upgrades to these engines with a 
completion date of September 2012. IVA expects that the work will be managed by 
Wartsila and assisted by IVA staff. 

19.4.4 Process Plants 

Jacobs has prepared an implementation plan for the process plants. The plan 
excludes other areas of the project, such as mining, infrastructure and tailings. 

The process plant facilities are based on two separate locations of the facilities: 

• Merlin mine site for the Crushing Plant. 

• Existing Osborne facility for the Concentrator Plant and Concentrate Treatment 
Plant. 

The Merlin mine site will be a greenfield site and Osborne will be a new plant on an 
existing facility which is effectively greenfield except for tie-ins to existing utility 
systems. 

Due to the separate locations of facilities the implementation strategy for each will 
vary. 

• Engineering will generally be performed in a single location. 

• Procurement will be performed using world-wide suppliers to ensure that best 
quality, price and delivery is achieved. The Procurement function will be co-
located with Engineering such that design can be progressed efficiently. 

• Separate construction contracts will be awarded within each facility. The split of 
contracts will be generally based on engineering discipline, schedule and trade 
competence. A typical split is: 

- Earthworks. 

- Civil works. 

- Structural / mechanical / piping installation. 

- Electrical & instrumentation installation.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY 
IMPACT 

The current Plan of Operations identifies a total rehabilitation liability of $4.9 M, of 
which $3.7 M is for rehabilitation of Legacy Sites associated with previous operations 
which Ivanhoe has a legal responsibility to resolve. Further assessments of surface 
and ground water quality are being undertaken along with acid producing potential of 
waste rock and ore which will further define these liabilities and the potential controls. 
Whilst these Legacy Sites are separate from The Project they are part of the overall 
Cloncurry Project. 

20.1 The Project Operation: 

The Project is a simple underground mining operation with relatively low volume 
production of 500,000 t/a ore. Waste rock will largely be disposed on surface in 
relatively low volume waste rock dumps located to fit within the existing topography. 
The development of The Project relies on the dewatering of the adjacent Mount Dore 
aquifer which has been partly dewatered during past operations and recovered to 
pre-existing levels within 6 years and water quality once dewatering ceased. 

20.2 Waste Rock Characterisation   

The decline is being excavated in the Staveley Formation, which is separated by a 
40 m thick inert quartzite unit from the mineralised Kuridala formation containing the 
Merlin deposit.  

For the exploration decline sixteen samples of the strata, representative of the waste 
rock from the decline development had been analysed for acid producing potential 
and reported in the current Plan of Operations. The samples are all classed as 'non 
acid forming' and geochemically benign.  

A second geochemical assessment of the waste rock and ore from the mine areas 
has confirmed this earlier observation on the decline material and indicates that a 
small proportion of the waste rock generated from the development of the deposit is 
PAF (potentially acid forming). It is expected that only low volumes of potentially acid 
forming waste rock will be encountered close to the footwall of the ore body and this 
will be managed by preferential handling and disposal into one of the existing open 
pit voids. 

During the mining phase progressive sampling of decline development waste will be 
undertaken to confirm the material designation from the previous assessments.  

Ore will be managed on an elevated ROM pad and crushed prior to transport to the 
Osborne site for processing. The ROM pad and crusher will drain to a pond designed 
to hold a 1:100 year 2 month wet season. Due to the turnover of ore material it is not 
expected that significant oxidation or liberation of metals or salts will occur. The catch 
dam is a conservative option to contain any deleterious contaminants in all except 
extreme events. Regular water sampling will also provide early warning of any 
contaminant development.

NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 179 

20.3 Groundwater 

Apart from the Mt Dore aquifer there are no significant ground water resources within 
a radius of at least 10 km. The aquifers associated with the mineralised areas are 
generally sparse and difficulty has been experienced in obtaining sufficient 
groundwater for exploratory drilling programs. As the ore bodies on Starra were 
developed outflows of water increased with depth and it is apparent that the orebody 
is the aquifer while the surrounding sediments of the Stavely formation are tight with 
little to no groundwater. The Merlin Mine is bounded to the east by the Mt Dore 
Granite and to the west by the Stavely formation both of which appear to act as 
obstacles to any significant groundwater movement. The mineralised aquifers have 
water quality which is generally moderately to highly saline with elevations of arsenic, 
boron, cobalt, copper, fluoride, iron, manganese, molybdenum, uranium, zinc and 
sulphates. There is little opportunity for significant impact on groundwater systems. 

20.4 Surface Water 

The area is drained by ephemeral streams that flow only during wet season rain 
events and for a short time after. There are naturally significant metal levels in 
surface soil and stream sediments adjacent to mineralised zones. This equates to 
significant metal elevations in surface water in undisturbed areas of arsenic, cobalt, 
copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel and zinc. Within the context of the mineralised 
surface water quality and the proposed management of mineralised material at 
Merlin it is unlikely that there will be any significant impacts on surface water quality. 

20.5 Conclusion 

The above summaries indicate the proposed Merlin operation has a low probability of 
causing any significant environmental liabilities. It is also recognised that The Project 
contains a number of Legacy Sites for which the environmental liability has been 
summarised in the current Plan of Operations at approximately $3.7 million. Further 
detailed assessments may increase the cost of the known liability. Active 
rehabilitation and control of the Legacy Sites will be implemented from 2011, thus 
progressively reducing liability.

20.7 Social/Community Relations Requirement 

IVA is the owner of Starcross Pastoral Holding which is the owner of the Pastoral 
Leases that cover The Project area. IVA has entered into a sub-leasing agreement 
with a pastoralist in relation to this ground.  

Social and Community relations are an ongoing priority for IVA. Engagement occurs 
regularly and as required based on the stage of project. IVA conducts an annual 
Community Relations Day each year where mining and exploration plans for the 
following year are discussed. This day also includes representatives from the Local 
Authority, Queensland Department of Employment, Economic Development and 
Innovation (DEEDI) and Department of Environment and Resource Management 
(DERM) (the regulators).  

Merlin mine site area is covered by a Native Title Claim held by the Yulluna People 
(QUD 189/10) with whom IVA has a Cultural Heritage Management Agreement. The 
existing mining leases were granted pre-native title and are subject to no 
agreements. Any new applications for mining leases will trigger a Right to Negotiate 
process.

Note: Mining indirect costs are included in the AMC mining direct costs. 

21.1.4 Contingency 

Contingency for mining was estimated by AMC at 15%. This is increased to 17% to 
include the diamond drilling program and aquifer dewatering. 

A contingency of 20% is applied to the total cost of Direct and Indirect costs for 
processing, infrastructure and owners costs. AMC considers this level of contingency 
appropriate for a PFS quality estimate and is consistent with the contingencies 
applied by IVA's engineers for mining and process plant estimates. 

The total contingency is A$ 86.4 M as shown in Table 21.4.

• Sustaining costs. 

21.1.6 Total Project Capital Cost 

The total project cost is A$518.6 M as set out in Table 21.1. 

Mining capital includes all development work, ventilation, dewatering for the life of 
mine. 

Processing - Crushing and Flotation includes a three stage plant located at the Merlin 
mine site and the 500,000 t/a grinding and flotation facilities at Osborne including 
EPCM costs to construct and install. 

Processing - Roaster includes the molybdenum multi-heart roaster, gas cleaning and 
recovery of molybdenum and rhenium products for sale. 

Infrastructure - includes 50% of the Osborne to Merlin mine site haul and access 
road, 50% of the re-build and conversion of the power station to 99% gas, additional 
accommodation units for mining and processing employees. 

Owners costs includes the Owners project management team, consultants, detailed 
mine design and plant engineering design to improve the accuracy of the capital cost 
estimate. 

Commissioning includes specialists in roasting and the cost of the first few weeks of 
plant commissioning until first concentrate production. 

Contingency of 20% has been allowed to account for the level of accuracy of the 
engineering design and study. 

21.1.7 Cost to First Production 

The total capital costs to first production are estimated to be A$ 337.0 as shown in 
Table 21.1. 

Mining capital includes the decline development and ventilation required to access 
the Merlin orebody to provide ore to commission and operate the flotation processing 
plant to first concentrate production. This cost also includes access to the Little 
Wizard orebody which will provide the first molybdenum ore. This ore will be 
stockpiled until the processing plant is available for commissioning. 

21.2 Operating Costs 

21.2.1 Introduction 

The operating cost estimate was compiled by IVA and is presented in summary 
format. The operating cost estimate is compiled from information provided by AMC 
for mining, from Jacobs for the process plant together with other data from IVA. AMC 
has reviewed the reasonableness of the compilation by IVA for the purpose of this 
report.

21.2.2 Employee Costs 

Employee cost estimates were prepared as follows: 

• Management salaries based on existing cost structure and numbers at 
Osborne. 

• Mining - AMC produced operating costs for mining assuming all the work was 
being undertaken by the IVA employees. AMC did not include escalation, 
capital cost, royalties, taxes, employee on-costs, mine water, air-commute and 
accommodation costs. 

• Processing - Jacobs produced the labour costs for the crushing, flotation and 
roasting process plants. Excluded were salary on-costs. 

• Administration cost of salaries is based on the number of employees in the 
areas of commercial, warehouse, IT, human resources, safety, environmental 
and indigenous relations that were employed when Osborne was operating at 
full capacity. 

• An accommodation cost of $50 per person per day was included. 

Employee costs were derived from the study to evaluate site options. Employee 
costs were calculated on the basis of: 

• A stand-alone operation where only the Project ore was processed through the 
existing modified Osborne flotation circuit. 

• The number of additional employees required to operate a new molybdenum 
rhenium flotation plant while the existing copper gold plant is being operated. 

• The number of employees required to operate both copper gold and 
molybdenum rhenium process plants using a shared workforce which includes 
management, supervision, maintenance and administration. 

• The combined operating costs, less the costs already included in the mining 
and processing. 

Employee numbers are summarised in Table 21.5.

IVA is liable to pay a production royalty to the Queensland State Government. The 
royalty is calculated from the value of the products sold, less the costs of 
transportation to the market and refining costs, times 2.7%. The Queensland 
Government does not prescribe a royalty rate for rhenium and there is some potential 
for rhenium to be liable for royalty at 2.5% or some other rate determined by the 
Queensland Government. 

Amendments to the Queensland royalty rate will see copper and other base metals 
move to a variable rate based on quoted market prices. Royalty rate for molybdenum 
concentrates is 2.7%.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Introduction 

The financial model was developed in-house by IVA. AMC reviewed the model logic, 
consistency of input assumptions and integrity of the calculations. 

All costs are constant in 2010 Australian dollars (A$), as established at the start of 
the PFS, with no provision for inflation escalation. The annual cash flow projections 
were estimated over the life of the mine based on capital expenditures, production 
costs, corporate costs and sales revenue. The financial indicators examined for each 
option of the project include after-tax cash flow, net present value (NPV), internal rate 
of return (IRR) and payback period. 

This section incorporates a number of changes to the project schedules, metal prices 
and exchange rates that have been adopted by IVA since the draft PFS report was 
completed. AMC is satisfied that these changes reflect the most likely scenario for 
project development. It will be necessary, prior to initiating a final Feasibility Study, to 
examine the effects of the changed assumptions on the mining and processing 
schedules and costs. 

The following sections identify the assumptions which form the basis for the 
economic analysis. 

22.2 Metal Sale Prices 

Sale prices of metals are based on a Roskill independent report on the outlook for 
molybdenum and rhenium markets which was commissioned by IVA (Roskill 2011). 
These prices are non escalated real prices. Sensitivity analysis, which has been 
prepared for metal sale prices above and below Roskill's forecasts, demonstrates 
financial returns at a wide range of molybdenum and rhenium prices. 

22.3 Exchange Rates 

Figure 22.1 shows the historical exchange rates for A$/US$ rates. The Australian 
dollar is currently (September 2011) at a high against the US$ due to the weakness 
in the US economy and the strength of the minerals sector in Australia driven by the 
strong demand for iron ore and coal exported to China. 

The financial model for The Project uses A$/US$ 1.00 for the first three years (ie 
2011-2013) and 0.83 thereafter. (The implied average A$/US$ (weighted by revenue) 
over the Life of Mine is approximately 0.84.)

Figure 22.1 A$ / US$ Exchange Rate 

 

22.4 Taxes 

Australian corporate tax is payable by IVA at the company level, not the project level. 
The assumption is that IVA and any new legal entities created for the purpose of The 
Project will be consolidated for taxation purposes. The following assumptions have 
been applied when calculating corporate tax payable. 
• 30% corporate tax rate (for the purpose of the economic model, this is applied 

to the Project cash flows only (ie the impact of other IVA company cash flows 
has been ignored)). 

• Tax payable yearly. 

Project assets are depreciated over their useful life, according to Australian Taxation 
legislation. A number of other factors will impact the quantum and timing of tax 
payable within the Ivanhoe Australia Consolidation group. 
• As at 31 December 2010, the IVA group has carried forward tax losses of 

approximately A$204 M. The IVA group's tax losses were not included in the 
economic analysis of The Project and as such represent potential upside to the 
economic evaluation of The Project. 

• IVA will generate further tax losses pre-production from The Project and 
continued exploration activities during 2011. (Project tax losses have been 
factored into the calculation of tax payable in the economic model. No forecast 
of future tax losses relating to other IVA projects or corporate activities is made 
in the economic model).

22.5 Goods and Services Tax 

A Goods and Services Tax (GST) at a rate of 10% is levied by the Federal 
Government on purchases by individuals and corporations on non-exempt goods and 
services. Business can claim back GST on most business inputs. It is assumed that 
most of the product sales will be to overseas customers, so no GST is applicable. 
For sales to customers in Australia, GST will be applicable, but would have minimal 
impact on the timing of the project cash flows. 

22.6 Carbon Trading Scheme 

The Australian Federal Government announced its Policy for a Carbon Tax on 10 
July 2011. 

The majority of the work for the Project PFS was undertaken prior to this 
announcement, and hence the impact of a carbon tax has not been factored into the 
economic model or the PFS. 

22.7 Royalties 

22.7.1 Queensland State Royalty 

Queensland State Mineral legislation imposes a royalty on the sale of minerals. The 
royalty rates applicable to sales of molybdenum and rhenium are fixed at 2.7% and 
2.5% respectively. Effective from 1 January 2011, the royalty rate applicable to 
copper sales is variable between 2.5% and 5.0%, varying in 0.02% increments, and 
depending on average metal prices. 

The financial analysis of The Project has applied royalty rates of 2.7% to sales of 
molybdenum, 2.5% to sales of rhenium and 4.7% to copper sales. AMC notes that 
based on the US$2.00/lb Cu price assumption used in modelling, the royalty rate 
applicable to copper sales is around 3.0% and thus the analysis is conservative. 

The Queensland Department of Minerals and Energy offers a discount on the royalty 
rates applicable to sales of molybdenum and other prescribed metals as stated in the 
Minerals Resources Regulation 2003 where, as a result of further processing 
undertaken in Australia, the product for sale reaches prescribed grades. A 20% 
discount may be applicable to sales of molybdenum from The Project as a result of 
the roasting which is planned to take place in Australia. (Note that no such discount 
has been included in the economic analysis of The Project and as such represents 
potential upside to the economic evaluation of The Project.).  

22.7.2 Previous Owner Royalty 

There is no previous owner royalty or commitments to third parties based on The 
Project mineral sales.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 191 

22.8 Native Title Compensation 

IVA currently pays compensation on a yearly basis to the local communities. For 
Exploration tenements and Mineral Leases, the claimants are paid a fixed amount, 
which is CPI increased for subsequent years. This amount, although currently small 
and immaterial is included in administration costs for The Project economic model. 

If IVA changes the size or shape of the mineral lease or applies for more surface 
rights than originally granted, then there is a need to negotiate new agreements. If 
this were the case then the current compensation calculation may change. 

22.9 Other Royalties/Agreements 

Burke River Bore field compensation is a flat fee, plus Consumer Price index (CPI) 
increases, and is included in the administration costs estimated for The Project. 

22.10 Revenue Deductions 

Shipping and logistical cost for molybdenum trioxide and APR are based on the 
products being roasted on site and transported to Townsville. The cost of roasting 
the molybdenum and the flue capture of the rhenium are incorporated into the 
processing costs, while transport is a revenue deduction for the purpose of 
determining Queensland State royalties payable. No storage costs have been 
estimated for the rhenium if it is decided to store and sell in future periods. (Note that 
rhenium volumes are low relative to other products and given the density of the 
metal, will require little space for storage). 

22.11 Reclamation 

A total amount of A$18 million has been allocated for reclamation and rehabilitation 
from 2017 onwards. 

22.12 Project Financing 

No assumptions have been made for project financing in the economic model. 

22.13 Assumptions 

Table 22.1 gives the key assumptions used in the financial model.

Roskill forecasts molybdenum oxide prices to increase from an average price of 
US$16.50 /lb for 2011 to US$27.00 /lb (US$23.77 /lb in real terms) in 2016. Roskill's 
forecast for rhenium metal is US$4,350 /kg in 2011 increasing to US$5,700 /kg 
(US$5,018 /kg in real terms) in 2016.  

The economic model is based on Roskill forecast real prices for molybdenum and 
rhenium from 2011 to 2016 inclusive. IVA has held 2016 prices constant thereafter 
and has selected an AUDUSD exchange rate of 1.00 for 2012 - 2013 and 0.83 
thereafter. Further information regarding the outlook for the molybdenum and 
rhenium markets is provided in Section 19.1 of this report.

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 

The Merlin Mo-Re resources lie within the Mount Dore North lower Cu-Zn sulphide 
mineralisation. This is below the Mount Dore upper oxide mineralisation that is 
subject to a separate preliminary economic analysis based on open pit mining and 
heap leach extraction of copper. 

The Merlin and Mount Dore deposits are located in the Kuridala formation and is 
overlain uncomformably by largely barren granite. The deposit lies below the 
southernmost contact with this granite body. Exploration has identified anomalous 
copper mineralisation to the North of Mount Dore extending along the margin of the 
thrusted granite for over 8 km. Lady Ella is a copper deposit previously mined by 
Selwyn in 1990's. It lies in the same structural and stratigraphic position as Mount 
Dore but resides on the northernmost contact of the same granite body. 

Further to the north lies Mount Elliot which was previously mined and is another 
focus for IVA's exploration and definition work. 

Other nearby deposits mined by Selwyn in the 1990's reside on the Starra line of 
mineralisation 1 km to the West. These bear no direct relationship to the Mount Dore 
mineralisation but their close proximity was the cause of the remnant infrastructure 
including the existing ex-mine camp, mill footings and tailings facilities.

24 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 

24.1 Pre-feasibility Study Optimisation Opportunities 

The PFS has identified a number of optimisation opportunities that will be 
investigated during any feasibility study (FS) of the Merlin project.  

The key opportunities are briefly outlined below. 

Mining cost: 
• The PFS has assumed 15 m sublevels in the underground mine. As a 

consequence of further evaluation following completion of the PFS these have 
now been modified to 20 m sublevels which will reduce the mining cost. Any FS 
will be completed on this basis. 

• The PFS focused attention on traditional mining methods. It has been identified 
that innovative mechanical mining may have potential at Merlin and thus will be 
included in any FS scope. A mix of long hole open stoping and drift and fill 
stoping will also be considered as part of the optimisation of mining methods. 

• Sensitivity analysis which has been undertaken on the Merlin project PFS 
indicates that a 10% reduction in mining costs is likely to improve NPV and 
after-tax cash flow by approximately A$47 M and A$84 M respectively. 

Molybdenum concentrate grade: 

• In this report, for design purposes, it has been assumed that all of the Mo/Re 
concentrate grade will be 30% Mo, however testwork has shown that two 
concentrate grades at 50% Mo and 30% Mo can be produced. Further work will 
be completed during the early stages of the FS to optimise the product 
streams. 

Capital cost: 

• The molybdenum/rhenium sulphide concentrate produced will be processed 
through a purpose-built, conventional technology, roasting and 
hydrometallurgical plant to produce saleable products including molybdenum 
trioxide and ammonium perrhenate (APR). The sale of the Mo/Re concentrate, 
the optimisation of the process design to minimise capital cost as well as the 
potential to produce other Mo products including ferro-molybdenum (FeMo), 
ammonium di-molybdenate and sulphuric acid, will be investigated in the early 
stages of the FS. This has the potential to reduce the capital cost of the 
processing plant. 

• This PFS assumed that the Mo/Re roaster and hydrometallurgical plant is 
located at Osborne. Alternative locations in other countries will be evaluated in 
the early stages of the FS to potentially reduce the capital expenditure and 
optimise the return on investment prior to commencing the FS. 

Sensitivity analysis which has been undertaken on the Merlin project PFS 
indicates that a 10% reduction in overall capital costs is likely to improve NPV 
and after-tax cash flow by approximately A$31 M and A$35 M respectively. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 199 

Life extension: 

• Exploration within the existing tenements where there have been high grade 
molybdenum finds has the potential to extend the life of the Mo/Re project.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

25.1 Geology 

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in 
October 2010 (Golder, 2010) and reproduced here with some exclusions of Merlin 
specific information which is not relevant to the Mount Dore copper oxide resource. 

25.1.1 Merlin - Little Wizard Mo-Re Deposit 

The Merlin Zone Mo-Re deposit lies within the northern half of the Mount Dore 
project area, Cloncurry district, Queensland, Australia. The high-grade hydrothermal 
Mo-Re mineralisation is a recent discovery that has been subject to a substantial 
exploration program by Ivanhoe Australia Limited. To June 30, 2010, 143 holes 
intersect the Merlin and Little Wizard domains, up from 76 used in the last Merlin 
estimate QG (2009). Though QG did update the small Little Wizard deposit in 
February 2010, significant drilling has been completed at Little Wizard and Merlin 
that is material to the Mineral Resource. 

Molybdenum-rhenium (Mo-Re) and copper (Cu) mineralisation at Mount Dore is 
hosted within a tectonised sequence of metashale, metasiltstone, schist and phyllites 
belonging to the Proterozoic Kuridala Formation in the Eastern Fold Belt of the 
Mount Isa Inlier.  

Fracture-controlled and breccia-matrix molybdenite mineralisation is hosted within K-
feldspar-altered and albitised black metashales and siltstones, which lie above and 
below the foliated schist and phyllite. The footwall structure at the base of the foliated 
phyllite and schist appears to have the strongest Mo and is inferred to have 
developed good open structures due to competency contrast. This basal contact also 
appears to have acted as a significant barrier for the Mo-rich fluids, resulting in 
ponding of the metals in the favourable structures just below the contact. The 
mineralised matrix-breccias contain sub-rounded clasts of K-feldspar and clay-
altered siltstone with very minor clay, with molybdenite partially to completely 
replacing the breccia matrix.  

Exploration of the Merlin deposit has primarily been diamond drilling with lesser RC 
drilling. IVA has implemented a rigorous set of protocols for logging, sampling, 
assaying and quality control. These protocols have been effective in ensuring data 
quality is not compromised throughout the exploration programs. 

The spatial distribution of Mo-Re grades in the Merlin zone displays an abrupt 
boundary often marked by the occurrence of massive molybdenite over short 
intervals. Such sharp boundaries require hard domain boundaries to control grade 
estimation and smooth of high and low grades. 

The high grade domain boundary was wireframed to constrain the high grade Mo 
mineralisation as a continuous narrow planar body with some lower splay structures. 
The broad orientation of the mineralised domains is parallel with the lithological units 
and structures. The available drilling remains relatively wide requiring significant 
interpretation that the modelled vein is continuous without small scale disruption.

AMC 111041 : October 2011 201 

25.1.2 Resource Estimate 

A block model was constructed to estimate grade and for mine planning purposes. 
The principal block size used for the ordinary kriged estimates was varied from 10 x 
25 x 10 m block size for the upper Mount Dore copper zones deemed suitable for 
open pit assessment and a smaller 5 x 12.5 x 5 m block size for lower and Merlin 
underground mining assessment. 

Classification of resources was based on the target drill spacing of 50 m for Indicated 
Mineral Resource, which is now largely complete for the Merlin deposit. 

The Merlin and Little Wizard total Mineral Resource estimate at a 0.3% Mo cut-off is: 
6.5 Mt at 1.3% Mo and 23 ppm Re Indicated Mineral Resource 
0.2 Mt at 0.9% Mo and 15 ppm Re Inferred Mineral Resource 

The Mount Dore total Mineral Resource estimate at a 0.25% Cu cut-off is: 
86 Mt at 0.55% Cu Indicated Mineral Resource 
58 Mt at 0.47% Cu Inferred Mineral Resource 

Significant additional Zn mineralisation exists outside of the quoted Cu mineralisation 
at Mount Dore North. Viable recovery of Zn is not yet demonstrated and stand alone 
Zn resources are not included in this resource statement. 

25.2 Geotechnical, Mining and Mineral Reserve 

A decline-access underground mine is most suitable. The drift and fill (DAF) and 
longhole open stoping (LHOS) underground mining methods were selected as most 
suitable. The mining schedule was prepared assuming a top-down mining system is 
employed in all mining areas, as follows: 

• DAF mining assuming 40 m/mth average advance (including backfill) rate per 
available ore heading, based on a single level, centre-out sequence. 

• Longitudinal LHOS assuming 420 t/d stoping rate (including backfill, excluding 
development) based on a single level, 2 stope end-retreat sequence. 

• Transverse LHOS assuming 600 t/d stoping rate (including backfill, excluding 
development), based on a single level, 2 stope centre-out sequence. 

The resultant production schedule shows that ore is sourced from 60% DAF mining, 
8% development, and 32% LHOS. All mining blocks are opened up quickly and 
production reaches 150 kt/a in 2012, 300 kt/a in 2013 before reaching full production 
of about 500 kt/a in 2014. The peak rate of 500 kt/a or above is maintained for about 
ten years and then falls away rapidly thereafter. 

After rounding, The Project mineral reserve estimate (including Little Wizard) is: 
6.7 Mt at 1.1% Mo and 19.1 ppm Re Probable Mineral Reserve

25.4 Infrastructure 

Infrastructure requirements for the Mount Dore/Merlin mine site area and for the 
Osborne site include power, water supply, aerodrome, accommodation villages, 
communications and tailings storages. Suitable arrangements have been identified 
for each of these items and can be further developed in a Feasibility Study. 

25.5 Risks 

Significant risks and uncertainties that have been identified include: 

• Delays in roaster approval through the environmental impact statement 
process. 

• Delays in mine development or production. 
• Failure or poor performance of the proposed underhand mining methods. 

• Inability to find a suitable roaster location. 

• Management of mine water. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 203 

• Inability to secure buyer or off take for molybdenum. 

• Mineral grade incorrectly modelled, reducing mineral reserve. 

• Capital cost or operating cost underestimated.  

• Adverse movements in foreign exchange rates. 

• Uranium content in ore results in reduced product marketability. 

• Inability to secure sufficient water supply and/or water quality. 
• Decrease in molybdenum or rhenium prices. 

• Insufficient human resources to manage multiple projects. 

• The effect of cement from shotcrete on mill recovery. 

• The effect of poor ground conditions on mining. 

Further studies are required to resolve these uncertainties.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS  

AMC recommends that, subject to a decision by IVA to proceed, the next phase of 
work should be data acquisition and studies leading to completion of a Feasibility 
Study. AMC notes that underground development is already under way. 

From AMC's own data, the cost of a Feasibility Study for an underground mine 
(including processing plant) at this scale can range from 2% to 12% (average 6%) of 
the project capital cost. Given the work already completed and the existing shared 
facilities, AMC expects that the cost will be at the lower end of this range. On the 
estimated capital cost of A$518.6 M for this project AMC estimates the Feasibility 
Study cost, including fieldwork, consultants, owners' costs and permitting, to be 
around $10 M. AMC considers this estimate to be consistent with an element of the 
Indirect Costs listed in Table 21.3 although the itemisation of costs is different. 

The following recommendations are made for some of the work areas for a 
Feasibility Study. The recommendations are not intended to set out a Scope of Work 
for a Feasibility Study. The costs of the recommended work would be included in the 
Feasibility Study cost.  

26.1 Geological 

This section is unchanged from the Technical Report prepared by Golder in October 
2010 (Golder, 2010) and is here reproduced in its entirety for the convenience of the 
reader. 

Resource definition work is a process of building upon existing knowledge and at the 
same time rebuilding from a new starting position. This is a progressive process and 
there usually remains some area where more work is required. Excluding the next 
logical step of infilling the current resource drilling to bring the resource to a higher 
level of confidence, for exploration and resource definition the following areas are 
identified as requiring further work:  

• Continue the drill hole relogging process such that the lithological model 
can be more tightly defined. 

• Undertake a more detailed audit of the drilling undertaken by previous 
companies and the early IVA drilling pre 2007. 

• Review the occurrence and grade of the wet RC samples at Mount Dore 
South and determine if corrective action is required. 

• Make better use of the orientated core results to assist the interpretation 
of the narrow mineralisation shapes. 

• Further assess the apparent change between the northern and southern 
areas. 

• Improve the understanding of the weathering profile on potential metal 
recovery. 

Additional exploration program drilling should be targeted at The Project source 
which is the focus of the current development plan. At this stage no Measured

Mineral Resources are defined and the current 50 m spaced drilling is at the lower 
end of the Indicated Mineral Resource confidence range. Additional drilling is 
required to define: 

• The close range variability and continuity of the Merlin veins both for grade 
estimation and for mine planning purposes. This should be initiated with a 
small program of targeted surface drill holes followed by both exploration 
development and sampling and close spaced underground drilling in a few key 
areas. 

• The general drill spacing should be closed down to 25 m. Given that 
underground development has been commenced, infill drilling would be most 
effective from underground both in terms of cost and possibly intersection 
angle. 

26.2 Geotechnical 

Work in subsequent studies should include: 

• Further assessment of major geological structures, discontinuity orientations 
and weathering profile. 

• Stress modelling of mine openings and backfill. 

• Development of the ground control management plan. 

• Guide on geotechnical requirements, systems and monitoring program for the 
implementation of the mine. 

• An outline of further geotechnical work required for the implementation phase 
of the project. 

• Further assessment of geotechnical risks to the project. 

In order to produce a study to feasibility level the following information is required, to 
an appropriate standard; this would be gained from a targeted geotechnical drilling 
programme: 

• Geotechnical and geological logging data and down hole surveys from the 
geological drilling programmes with documentation of quality control process. 

• A focus on gathering structural logging information form oriented core. 

• All core photos for both geological and geotechnical drilling programmes. 

• Geotechnical laboratory test data. 

• Geological interpretations of lithology / alteration / faults / shears as 
wireframes. 

• Any hydrogeological studies or information. 

• Site specific in-situ stress information. 

Work on these matters is ongoing.

26.3 Mining 

Further key areas of work to be completed as a basis for further mining studies 
include: 

• Geotechnical work as described above. 

• Revision of metallurgical recovery parameters and associated cost and 
financial assumptions affecting the mining value model. 

• Completion of appropriate levels of open pit and associated studies, to confirm 
that underground mining remains the most attractive option. 

• Completion of suitable test work to optimise the paste fill. 

• Revision of optimisation studies using PFS mining and metallurgical 
information to determine the appropriate cut-offs to apply to the mine design 
and schedules. 

The mining component of the Merlin Feasibility Study should include the following 
mining components: 

• Advanced geotechnical review, assessment and modelling. 

• Mine design and scheduling. 

• Mine services and infrastructure planning. 

• Mine ventilation planning. 

• Backfill planning and preliminary system design. 

• Mine equipment and organisational planning. 

• Operational review and benchmarking. 
• Re-estimation of Mineral Reserves. 

26.4 Processing 

A review of the process highlighted several areas for refinement of the process. 
These are discussed below, and should be pursued in the next phase of the project. 

26.4.1 Concentrate Production 

• Recent test work has revealed that the level of graphite in the ore appears to 
be a good indicator as to whether a high grade concentrate can be achieved. 
Graphite levels below 0.1% consistently gave saleable grade concentrate in the 
variability flotation tests. There does not appear to be a strong correlation to the 
total carbon and concentrate grade. The high levels of graphite appear to be 
isolated to the black shale ore lithology. A review of the black shale lithology 
should address whether ore can be produced with little or no black shale 
content, in which case the concentrate grade could be much higher than the 
estimated 30% molybdenum used in this study. This may open the opportunity 
to either sell the concentrate prior to roasting, or reduce the requirement for the 
calcine leach circuit post roasting. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 207 

• Regrind testwork was successful in allowing depression of the copper 
sulphides from the molybdenum concentrate. A study should address whether 
the ferric chloride leach stage can be deleted. 

• A study should address whether, instead of cleaning the copper concentrate to 
increase the grade, the lower grade concentrate can be fed directly into the 
existing copper flotation circuit for upgrading and blending to final concentrate. 
There may be a need to oxidise the residual sodium hydrosulphide (NaHS) 
prior to the transfer. If so, this would be done with the addition of peroxide to a 
mixing tank. 

• A review of the mechanical flotation cells is required to ensure that additional 
retention time is allowed for to ensure expected recoveries are achieved in 
periods of higher grade feed. 

• Allowance should be made for lime addition to the mill feed belt. This will allow 
for pH control of the rougher feed slurry. Sometimes this is required to improve 
froth characteristics. A higher pH may also be required if the feed has a lot of 
copper as this will help copper recovery. pH control may also be required if any 
of the ore is 'acidic' to avoid corrosion issues. 

26.4.2 Concentrate Treatment 

• The Ion Exchange (IX) feed will be oxidised with peroxide. This is to oxidise 
any selenium which might be present and would otherwise precipitate on the 
resin and foul it. It is unlikely that there will be any selenium present and the 
requirement for this step should be reviewed in the next phase of work. 

• The molybdenum leach is fast and may not need the 5 tanks specified in this 
study. A review is required. 

• Collecting the molybdenum leach residue as a filter cake rather than repulping 
should be considered. If repulping is required, using the neutralised raffinate 
would be more suitable than fresh water. 

• Anhydrous ammonia should be considered to replace aqua ammonia due to 
the large quantity used in an effort to reduce operating costs. 

26.4.3 Crushing Facility 

• A study should be undertaken to compare a new plant against a contracted 
crushing facility. This would reduce the capital cost by approximately A$8.5 M. 

26.4.4 Location of the Concentrate Treatment Facility 

Alternate locations to site the molybdenum rhenium roasting and hydrometallurgical 
plant to produce molybdenum trioxide and ammonium perrhenate for sale from the 
sulphide concentrates produced at Osborne were investigated. 

Three potential locations were investigated: 

1. In the heavy industrial designated zone in Townsville, North Queensland 
adjacent to the Port of Townsville. 



IVANHOE AUSTRALIA LIMITED 
NI 43-101 Technical Report Merlin Project Prefeasibility Study 

AMC 111041 : October 2011 208 

2. An overseas location to take advantage of lower capital and operating costs. 
Joint ventures with Korean companies located in Korea were identified along 
with other potential locations in Asia. 

3. At the Osborne mine site. 

In the PFS, the location of the roaster was selected to be at the Osborne site, but the 
option for an overseas site is still possible. The final decision should be made 
following further investigation and studies during the Feasibility Study. 

26.4.5 Sulphur Dioxide Roaster Gas Cleaning 

The initial roaster flowsheet developed by Jacobs was based on scrubbing the SO2 
from the exit gas stream using a lime scrubber. This produced a gypsum product and 
an emission level of 320 t/a SO2. To comply with perceived maximum SO2 emission 
levels for Queensland (there is no legislated emission level) it was questionable 
whether the lime scrubber would meet DERM requirements. Alternative scrubbers 
were evaluated. These include: 

• Lime/caustic soda scrubber, caustic soda or sodium carbonate neutralising 
SO2 gas scrubber. 

• Haldor Topsoe wet sulphuric acid (WSA) plant. 

A conventional sulphuric acid plant was rejected early on in the evaluation process 
because of the high capital cost (> A$50 M) and inefficiency due to the low 
concentration of SO2 (2%) in the gas stream.  

The final plant configuration adopted for the PFS was for a Haldor Topsoe wet 
sulphuric acid (WSA) plant. 

The final decision over these two alternatives should be made in the 
Feasibility Study. 

26.4.6 Sell or Toll Treat Molybdenum Concentrates 

The option studied was to export the sulphide concentrate and sell or toll treat the 
concentrates at an existing facility. This option avoids the construction of a roaster 
plant in a remote location in Australia. 

The capital cost reduction for not constructing a roasting plant is approximately 
A$108 M. 

A financial analysis compared the base case with a molybdenum roaster at Osborne 
with the expected return of metal and refining cost based on the value of the rhenium 
in the concentrate. The analysis showed a substantial reduction in NPV if the 
molybdenum concentrate is sold or toll treated instead of constructing a purpose built 
roaster. 

It was concluded that a purpose built roaster and rhenium recovery plant had a 
significantly higher NPV compared to selling concentrate and was therefore essential

to extracting the full value of the mineral resource. This should be confirmed in the 
Feasibility Study.
