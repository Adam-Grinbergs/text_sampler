Summary (Item 1) 
SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) has been commissioned by Marlin Gold Mining Ltd. (Marlin Gold). 

to prepare a Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) 

compliant Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the Trinidad Property 

(Trinidad or the Project) located in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico. 

Marlin Gold will file this Technical Report in accordance with NI 43-101 requirements.  This amended 

PEA report dated January 28, 2013 contains no material changes since the previously amended 

PEA report dated July 12, 2012.  Amended areas of the report address the following items: 

 Clarification of the authoring Qualified Persons (QP), their qualifications and their respective 
sections of responsibilities; 

 Clarification regarding reliance on other experts, information sourced, extent of reliance and 
sections of the report to which the reliance applies; 

 Expanded discussion on the impact of aggregate taxes on the cash-flow model, post-tax 
results, tax depreciation and amortization of deferred cost; 

 Addition of cautionary language to address that the PEA is preliminary in nature, that it 
includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as 

mineral reserves, and that there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. 

Property Description and Ownership 
The Trinidad property is located in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico at the UTM coordinates of 438,928E, 

2,537,196N, within the WGS84 Zone 13 system.  It is approximately 110 km southeast of the city of 

Mazatlan and 42 km southeast of the town of Rosario.  The property is accessed by way of paved 

Federal Highway 15 from Mazatlan to El Rosario then by a 42 km dirt/gravel road through the 

villages of Palmarito and Buena Vista. 

Marlin Gold Mining Ltd. (formerly Oro Mining Ltd.) was formed as the result of a business 

combination of Oro Silver Resources Ltd. and Oro Gold Resources Ltd., effective as at 

October 22, 2010.  Within this technical report, the combined business unit is collectively referred to 

as "Marlin Gold",or "the Company". 

The Trinidad property is comprised of six contiguous mineral concessions totaling 61,602.26 ha that 

are either granted or assigned to Marlin Gold or for which Marlin Gold has an option-to-buy 

agreement from a group of owners.  A number of small concessions not owned by the Company are 

located internal to the Trinidad property but are not in the immediate area of interest covered by this 

report.  Several of the concessions have been legally surveyed. 

Geology and Mineralization 
The project lies within the moderately extended part of the Tertiary Basin-and-Range Province, and 

is underlain by Tertiary volcanic, volcaniclastic and intrusive rocks of the Sierra Madre Occidental 

geologic province.  These rocks comprise late Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic arc rocks of largely 

intermediate composition, and upper Oligo-Miocene ignimbrites.  Intermediate to felsic intrusions are 

exposed at low topographic level, and are likely part of the Laramide Sinaloa Batholith, which

extends from southern Sinaloa into Arizona.  Quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusive rocks intrude mid-

Tertiary andesite volcanic rocks, suggesting a mid-Tertiary or younger age for this intrusive unit.   

The Trinidad property occurs within the Rosario mining district, of which the Rosario mine was 

probably the most significant past Au-Ag producer.  The ore mined in the district was predominantly 

exploited from gold-rich intermediate sulfidation veins hosted by NW- and ENE-trending faults.   

The Taunus resource area lies near the contact between intermediate volcanic rocks to the west, 

and felsic intrusive to sub-intrusive rocks to the east.  The contact between the two units forms a 

narrow "v" shape with the andesitic units to the west and a quartz feldspar porphyry breccia at the 

center of the "v".  The eastern contact is defined by the near vertical, north-south trending Chandler 

Fault.  This fault forms the eastern wall of the current pit and is the boundary between the quartz 

feldspar porphyry breccia to the west and a fractured quartz feldspar porphyry to the east. 

Metallic assay analysis and petrographic evaluation of gold-bearing specimens indicate gold occurs 

as native gold, is fine-grained, and is not subject to appreciable "nugget" effect.  A Ag:Au ratio of 6:1 

is reported, making Taunus a relatively gold-rich intermediate sulfidation-state epithermal system.  

The area evaluated by Exploraciones Eldorado is entirely within the supergene oxidation zone.  

Primary sulfide minerals are therefore rare, comprising very minor pyrite and chalcopyrite, digenite, 

and covelite.  Copper occurs as the secondary copper minerals chrysocolla and malachite, and with 

Pb and Zn as a secondary vanadian mineral, mottramite.  Silver occurs as native silver, and 

jalpaitite.  Silver and the base metal elements are reported to have a good positive correlation, and 

very poorly correlated with gold. 

Exploration Status 
Regional-scale exploration work was conducted by Marlin Gold, and by Minera Camargo S.A. de 

C.V. on behalf of Marlin Gold, throughout the Trinidad property during 2005 to 2006.  This led to 

smaller scale exploration work by Marlin Gold within the Trinidad (Taunus) resource area beginning 

in 2007.  Property scale work included prospecting and lithology/alteration mapping, in conjunction 

with the collection of approximately 703 stream sediment samples, 509 rock grab, chip, and channel 

samples, and 482 soil samples.  The objective of the regional exploration program was to provide a 

preliminary geological and geochemical assessment of the regional potential for the area, and to 

better understand the regional geologic framework in which the Trinidad resource area resides.  

In early 2007, Marlin Gold carried out a diamond drill program totaling 727.6 m at its San Miguel gold 

prospect(1), located approximately 4 km due southeast of, and along the same structural trend that 

passes through the Trinidad resource area.  An additional 1,154 m of diamond drilling in 10 holes 

were completed in the Taunus and Colinas areas.   

In early 2008, Marlin Gold completed 6,524 m in 34 reverse circulation holes in the Taunus, Colinas 

and Bocas areas and an additional 26 shallow reverse circulation holes were drilled in the Taunus 

South and Buena Vista town site totaling 622 m. 

                                                      
1 The purchase option on the San Miguel concession, which was listed in the previous NI 43-101 was 
cancelled by mutual agreement of the parties in 2010.

In 2009 Marlin Gold completed 6,810 m of diamond drilling comprising 27 holes in the Taunus, 

Bocas and Colinas areas.  The focus of this drilling was to define resources at depth in the Taunus 

pit area and to define the extents of the newly discovered HS zone. 

In 2010, Marlin Gold completed 5,530 m of diamond drilling in 24 holes in the Colinas, Taunus and 

Bocas areas.  An additional 8,470 m in 73 reverse circulation holes were completed in the same 

areas.  A trial sonic drillhole campaign was also completed in 2010, with 11 holes (157 m ) 

completed to test the leach pad and another 6 holes (493 m) to completed in the Colinas, Taunus 

and Bocas areas. 

In 2011, Marlin Gold continued its exploration drill program, which included the completion of 32 

sonic drillholes totaling 3,840 m. 

Mineral Resource Estimate 
SRK considers that the blocks located within the conceptual pit envelope show "reasonable 

prospects for economic extraction" and can be reported as a mineral resource.  Mineral Resources 

are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty 

that all or any part of the Mineral Resource estimate will be converted into Mineral Reserves 

estimate.  The Mineral Resource Statement for the Taunus and the Colinas (satellite) deposits at 0.3 

g/t Au cut-off is presented in Table 1.

Mining and Production Schedule 
The Taunus deposit was historically mined by Exploraciones Eldorado S.A. de C.V., an affiliate of 

Eldorado Gold Corporation and is situated in relatively flat terrain, ringed by ephemeral arroyo's in a 

semi-arid environment that are influenced by periods of heavy rain in the wet season.  To the north 

and south, the Taunus pit is supported by two satellite areas of mineralization that are currently 

classified as inferred.  For the PEA, the size of the pits have not been constrained by site 

infrastructure, arroyo's or other factors that may reduce the size of the potential pit and a 45º slope 

formed the bases for potential economic extraction.  The final pit was determined to be

approximately 225 m deep, 900 m from north to south, 550 m from east to west with a total volume 

of 27 Mm3.  Above a cut-off grade of 0.17 g/t Au, the total feed is estimated at 7.8 Mt at a grade of 

1.12 g/t Au with a strip ratio of 7.2:1 (waste:feed) and 281 koz of gold contained in-situ before 

recovery.  The production schedule calls for a 5 year mine life with annual gold delivery to the heap 

of 30 koz Au, 40 koz Au, 60 koz Au, 60 koz Au and finally 90 koz Au with a LoM average total 

production rate of 37 kt/d.  The mine production schedule is shown in Table 2.  It should be noted 

that the resource numbers referenced in the mining and economic modeling sections are based on 

an internal cut-off of 0.17 g/t.  This is different from the 0.3 g/t Au cutoff used for the resource 

estimate.  As such, mining figures represent diluted grades to a selective mining unit of 5 m x 5 m x 

5 m that result in more tonnes at a lower grade and slightly less contained ounces than reported in 

the resource. 

The mine fleet will likely consist of 100 t capacity (Caterpillar 777 or equivalent) rigid body haul 

trucks supported by either front end loaders or hydraulic excavators.  Blasting will be included in the 

default mine assumptions but some areas may be amenable to free-dig operations. 

It is likely that mine contractors will be employed at Taunus and initial contractor interviews have 

been taking place through early 2012. 

Waste will be disposed of approximately 1.5 km away from the pit.

The mine production schedule in Table 2 includes inferred mineral resources includes that are 

considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that 

would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will 

be realized. 

Geotechnical 
Only limited rock characterization data are available at the site.  The preliminary source of 

information was rock mass rating (RMR) estimates from observations in the existing pit and limited 

borehole data on rock quality.  The quality of this data was not reviewed in detail, but it appears 

reasonably consistent from borehole to borehole and can be used as a relative indicator of the

variation in rock quality.  In the absence of a site-wide RMR zonation block model, average RMR 

values were estimated beneath the east and west sides of the pit. 

Faulting and fractures observed in the existing pit to assess the dominant jointing that might be 

present in the pit walls.  These fractures are known to control local bench face stability, especially in 

the west wall. 

Empirical rock mass characterization methods were used to estimate allowable geotechnical mine 

design parameters with respect to maximum pit bench, intra-ramp and overall angles and bench 

widths required to maintain stability.  These methods rely on average RMR estimates to quantify 

rock mass strengths.  Using these methods for estimating scoping-level mine design parameters is 

reasonable given that they are based on calibration to many case histories in similar rock masses 

and pit depths. 

Metallurgy and Processing 
During 2011 Metcon Research (Metcon) undertook a metallurgical investigation on six separate test 

composites formulated from sonic drill intervals from Marlin Gold's Taunus Pit.  This work included a 

full head sample characterization of each of the test composites, bottle roll cyanidation studies, 

column agglomeration studies and larger diameter closed-circuit column leach tests. 

As summarized in Table 3,  an average gold recovery of about 70% and an average silver recover of 

about 23% are estimated based on the closed-cycle column leach testwork presented in this report.  

These recovery estimates include a 5% reduction in recovery to account for leach inefficiencies 

normally encountered in a commercial heap leach operation.

Recovery of gold from the Trinidad project will be performed by heap leaching.  Mined material will 

be transported by truck and stockpiled at the crusher facility.  The heap material will be crushed, 

agglomerated, and transported to the leach pad with grasshopper conveyors, radial stacked and 

then leached with a weak cyanide solution to extract the contained gold values.  Gold will be 

recovered from the pregnant leach solution (PLS) in an ADR plant  by adsorbing the extracted gold 

onto activated carbon followed by desorption into an upgraded and purified gold-bearing solution, 

electrowinning  and smelting to recover the extracted gold as a final product.    

A total of 95 employees have been allowed for process operations at an estimated cost of US$2.0 

million per year, including a 30% burden.  This is equivalent to US$1.29/t of material processed. 

Total process plant operating cost (excluding labor) is estimated at US$5.73 per tonne of material 

processed.  Of this total, consumable costs are estimated at US$2.30/t, operating and maintenance 

supplies at US$1.68/t, wear parts at US$1.06/t and power at US$0.59/t.

Environmental 
Project permitting of Taunus is currently ongoing, with the submittal of the Manifestación de Impacto 

Ambiental (MIA), including the Analisis de Riesgo, to the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos 

Naturales (SEMARNAT) in April 2012 and approved by SEMARNET in November 2012.  The 

subsequent submission of the ETJCUS (estudio tecnico justificativo para el cambio de uso de suelo) 

or "land use change" was submitted in November 2012, with a tentative response date by the 

agencies of January 31, 2013.  These three documents constitute the primary environmental 

permitting authorization necessary for mining in Mexico.  However, a number of smaller permits are 

also required prior to initiation of operations.  

The documentation needed to meet the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance 

Standards are currently under development, and mostly not available for this assessment.  

Marlin Gold has entered into an exploitation and temporary occupation agreement with the 

Community of Maloya, pursuant to which Marlin Gold was granted surface use and mine 

development rights on the Taunus deposit.  The details of the project Social Management Plan are 

currently under development, and not available for this assessment. 

Current regulations in México require that a preliminary closure program be included in the MIA and 

a definite program be developed and submitted to the authorities during the operation of the mine 

(generally accepted as three years into the operation).  Marlin Gold has attempted to prescribe the 

necessary closure activities for the operation and anticipates the associated costs to be on the order 

of US$3,048,500.  This is generally in keeping with smaller international gold heap operations, but 

does not consider the possibility for longer-term process solution management following closure.  

Details of this calculation were not provided to SRK for this assessment, so an opinion on the rates 

and quantities used could not be developed. 

Project Costs and Financials 
Life of Mine (LoM) capital and operating costs are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.  Initial capital of 

US$27.9 million is included in the first year of pre-production and a negative capex of US$ (2.4) 

million represents the ongoing capital.  This negative value is composed of the closure costs 

combined with a salvage value of US$1.8 million and the return of a Mexican equivalent of Value 

Added Tax called Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA), correspondent to 16% of the original estimate 

of capital investment, during the first year of operation. 

The PEA is preliminary in nature that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 

speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 

them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

 Legislated taxes rates are different for each year and range from 30% to 28%  
 Capital assets are depreciated using a straight line rate of 12% for 8.3 years. 

Post Tax Results 
The SRK LoM plan and economics are based on the following: 

 Capital costs of US$25.5 million dollars are applicable for a depreciation schedule; 
 The depreciation model adopted is a straight line rate of 12%; and 
 Effective income tax rate varies between 28% and a 30%. 

The post-tax economic analysis results indicate a net present value of US$53.4 million, based on an 

8% discount rate, and an IRR of 43%. 

Conclusions and Recommendations 
Exploration and Resource 

The drilling programs adequately define the zone of gold mineralization and are acceptable to 

support the resource estimation of this report.  The mineralization remains open at depth, but is 

relatively well constrained to the north and south. 

Because the data has some underlying quality complexities (downhole surveys/spatial location of 

mineralization compounded with relatively thin zones of mineralization), further drilling may be 

warranted to increase the confidence in structurally controlled higher grade mineralization, 

particularly between the Top and Bottom zones. 

Exploration recommendations include: 

 Additional in-situ specific gravity testing should be undertaken to further confirm specific gravity 
determinations from drill core.  Once this has been established, it might be possible to do the 

estimation of block specific gravity from nearby data.  

 It appears that sonic drilling returned quite similar results to diamond drilling.  Considering that 
the sonic drilling is much more expensive, future drill campaigns should potentially be based on 

a combination of large diameter core holes and sonic drill holes.  

 Currently, the immediate area within and around the Taunus pit is fragmented in terms of the 
solid models.  Consider unifying the models so that at least the Bocas, Eldorado-HS and 

Red Zone are analyzed together and therefore form geologically sensible domains.  It may be 

possible to incorporate Taunus and Colinas data in the same way. 

 Further drilling should be considered where it would benefit the quality of the mineral resource, 
and where there is uncertainty regarding the volume and spatial location of key higher grade 

mineralization and where it will lead to a more unified mineralization model. 

 Complete analysis of silver, copper, arsenic, molybdenum and zinc for any further sampling of 
the mineralization and surrounding rocks so that these metals can be incorporated into the next 

resource estimate, to allow the assessment of potentially deleterious metals within the context of 

process metallurgy. 

Mining 

Mining operations at Taunus are sensitive to the geometry of the orebody and the ability to phase 

the operation based on mining width.  This suggests the strategic directives of Marlin Gold will

heavily influence the size, stripping profile and feed delivery possible in any given period.  Mining will 

utilize contractor operations utilizing standard mining equipment under the direction of Marlin Gold 

mine staff.  Precise pit slope excavation and ability to manage water will be important to liberate high 

grade heap leach material found at the pit bottom as the ability re-excavate a pushback will be cost 

prohibitive if a mistake is made.  The mine plan calls for an average 37 kt/d operation with a 

reference mining cost of $1.35/t over a five year mine life. 

Detailed contractor evaluations based on a monthly schedule (Including predicted cycle time and 

haul distances) will be vital to optimize the periodic mining cost as the pit deepens. 

The use of a mixed fleet for stripping and detailed heap material excavation should be looked at to 

reduce ramp widths at the pit bottom. 

The current PEA pit is not limited by arroyo or process plant buffer widths.  When the selection of 

future pit sizes are determined, these widths should be included. 

The PEA pit includes both phase 1 and phase 2 pit extraction.  During future studies, an evaluation 

should be made of including only phase 1 extraction, but breaking it up into minimum mining widths 

that will improve the strip profile.  Including the phase 2 pit, forces higher stripping ratios in the early 

years for only incremental gains in NPV. 

The amount of free-dig versus drill and blast should be evaluated, and if significant, a move away 

from front end loader to excavators should be considered.  Particularly, if the breakout force of the 

excavator negates the need for blasting. 

Geotechnical 

Additional recommended geotechnical activities to advance design include the following: 

 Drill coreholes in west and east highwall areas to characterize rock quality and obtain 
samples for strength testing; 

 Perform laboratory testing for rock strength; 
 Obtain oriented core of fractures and assess orientation, frequency and spacing of dominant 

joint sets expected at depth; 

 Characterize the hydrogeology for seepage rates into the pit and need to dewatering 
program; 

 Develop 3-D structural/lithologic model and RMR block model that can be used to optimize 
the overall pit slope angles; 

 Complete a seismic hazard assessment to assess likely ground motion that pit walls and 
surface structures will be exposed to for the dynamic stability;  

 Assess pit slope stability along critical orientations of the pit using numerical stress analysis 
methods; 

 Assess pre-mining in situ stress conditions from borehole conditions and, if necessary, 
conduct stress measurements to assess horizontal stress conditions; and 

 Assess stability of heap leach pad at critical porewater pressure conditions and impact on 
ultimate stable height of heap leach pad.  

Metallurgy and Processing 

An average gold recovery of about 70% and an average silver recover of about 23% is estimated 

based on the closed-cycle column leach testwork presented in this report.  These recovery estimates

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

include a 5% reduction in recovery to account for leach inefficiencies normally encountered in a 

commercial heap leach operation. 

It is very likely that material from the Taunus pit will present percolation issues during multi-lift heap 

leach operation.     

Additional agglomeration studies and full-height column leach tests should be conducted during the 

next phase of study.  In addition, compacted permeability tests should be conducted to assess 

solution percolation rates at sequentially higher loadings designed to simulate conditions in a multi-

lift heap leach operation. 

Environmental 

Permitting of the project is progressing, though more attention should be given to addressing the IFC 

Performance Standards for future financing.  Geochemistry test work on the waste rock, spent heap 

material and post-closure wall rock is currently limited and needs to be expanded to include longer-

term kinetic testing to establish the potential for poor quality seepage from the waste piles and future 

pit lake.  Post-metallurgical testing of the spent heap material would provide a better understanding 

of the anticipated draindown chemistry and the need for long-term management.  Predictive 

geochemical modeling of the future pit lake would also be appropriate. 

Project Costs and Financials 

Project capital costs seem fairly detailed for this level of study, including a number of quotes to back 

up the included costs.  The adopted mining cost is also backed up by third party preliminary 

quotations.  SRK recommends that Marlin Gold address the following: 

 Assess the correct mass and grade of existing spent-heap material.  Its movement is 
currently included in the costs, but the eventual recovery of its gold content is not considered 

as a revenue generator; 

 Analyze the resources for silver, as its recovery could further improve project results; and 
 A more detailed assessment of the beneficiation costs will be required in future studies.

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

1 Introduction (Item 2) 
SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) has been commissioned by Marlin Gold Mining Ltd. (Marlin Gold) 

to prepare a Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) 

compliant Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the Trinidad Property 

(Trinidad or the Project) located in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico approximately 110 km southeast of 

the city of Mazatlan and 42 km southeast of the town of Rosario. 

This Technical Report was prepared for Marlin Gold at the request of its directors and chief operating 

officer.  SRK prepared this report to standards provided by NI 43-101, and the Standards of 

Disclosure for Mineral Properties, Form 43-101F.  Marlin Gold (formerly Oro Mining Ltd.) was formed 

as the result of a business combination of Oro Silver Resources Ltd. and Oro Gold Resources Ltd., 

effective as at October 22, 2010.  Within this technical report, the combined business unit is 

collectively referred to as Marlin Gold. 

Marlin Gold will file this Technical Report in accordance with NI 43-101 requirements.  This amended 

PEA report dated January 28, 2013 contains no material changes since the previously amended 

PEA report dated July 12, 2012.  Amended areas of the report address the following items: 

 Clarification of the authoring Qualified Persons (QP), their qualifications and their respective 
sections of responsibilities; 

 Clarified discussion of reliance on other experts, information sourced, extent of reliance and 
sections of the report to which the reliance applies; 

 Expanded discussion on the impact of aggregate taxes on the cash-flow model, post-tax 
results, tax depreciation and amortization of deferred cost; 

 Addition of cautionary language to address that the PEA is preliminary in nature, that it 
includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have 

the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as 

mineral reserves, and that there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

1.3 Reliance on Other Experts (Item 3) 
The Consultant's opinion contained herein is based on information provided to the Consultants by 

Marlin Gold throughout the course of the investigations concerning environmental, depreciation and 

tax matters relevant to the technical report.   

The principal document used in the environmental assessment for Section 18 of this Technical 

Report was: 

 Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental Modalidad Partícular, (MIA) Para el Proyecto 
Explotación y Exploración Mina La Trinidad, Comunidad de Maloya, El Rosario, Sinaloa was 

completed and submitted to SEMARNAT in April 2012, and approved in November 2012 

(including the resolutions for the terms of reference for preparation of the MIA developed and 

issued by SEMARNAT). 

Depreciation and tax information relied upon for Sections 20.4 through 20.6 of this Technical Report 

was based upon work performed by Marlin Gold's CFO and provided to SRK on January 8.2012. 

The Consultants used their experience to determine if the information from previous reports was 

suitable for inclusion in this technical report and adjusted information that required amending.  This 

report includes technical information, which required subsequent calculations to derive subtotals, 

totals and weighted averages.  Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and 

consequently introduce a margin of error.  Where these occur, the Consultants do not consider them 

to be material. 

1.4 Sources of Information 
Standard professional review procedures were used in the preparation of this report.  SRK reviewed 

data provided by Marlin Gold, conducted a site visit to confirm the data and mineralization, and 

reviewed the project site.  Most of the drill core and the RC cuttings from the various drilling 

campaigns remain on site and are organized for easy access.  Some of the project data was 

generated by previous operators, primarily dating from the 1990's.  All exploration since 2005 has 

been conducted by Marlin Gold.  Additional sources of information are presented throughout the 

body of the text and in Section 25 References. 

All mineral title, license and permit information was provided by Marlin Gold and verified through the 

review of a land title search completed on behalf of Marlin on March 9, 2012. 

All 2011 drillhole data (collars, surveys and sample information) was provided by Marlin Gold staff. 

All of the historic data relied upon in this study, such as drill logs, assay certificates, feasibility report 

and other reports, were obtained by Marlin Gold from Almaden Resources Corporation, the joint 

venture partner of Exploraciones Eldorado, S.A. de C.V (Exploraciones Eldorado) at Trinidad in the 

late 1990's.  The drill logs, and feasibility report (Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995) were produced by 

Exploraciones Eldorado, the assay certificates were from Bondar-Clegg Ltd., and check assays from 

Chemex Labs Ltd.  Historic information was obtained from maps, longitudinal and cross sections, 

data tables and documents prepared by EGC between 1994 and September, 1996.  Documents 

used in the preparation of this report are assumed by the authors as accurate and complete in all 

aspects.

2.4 Property Taxes and Assessment Rights 
All property tax and assessment information provided in this section has been provided by Marlin 

Gold and has not been verified by SRK. 

All minerals found in Mexico are the property of Mexico, and may be exploited by private entities 

under concessions granted by the Mexican Government.  The process was defined under the 

Mexican Mining Law of 1992, and excludes petroleum and nuclear resources from consideration.  

The Mining Law also requires that non-Mexican entities must either establish a Mexican corporation, 

or partner with a Mexican entity. 

Under current Mexican mining law, amended April 29, 2005, the Direccion General de Minas (DGM) 

grant concessions for a period of 50 years, provided the concession is maintained in good standing.  

There is no distinction between mineral exploration and exploitation concessions.  As part of the 

requirements to maintain a concession in good standing, bi-annual fees must be paid, and a report 

submitted to the DGM each May.  This report covers work conducted over the previous year on the 

concession. 

Two schemes cover the calculation of the bi-annual fee, and are calculated on a per-hectare basis. 

For concessions granted prior to January, 2006, one of two fee structures apply to the calculation,

depending on the type of concession (exploitation or exploration), and the amount of time that has 

passed since granting of the concession.  For concessions granted after January, 2006, a per-

hectare escalating fee applies (Table 2.4.1).

 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Interest, Royalties, Agreements and 2.4.1
Encumbrances 

All information regarding Marlin Gold's interest in the property presented in this section, has been 

provided by Marlin Gold and has not been verified by SRK. 

The Nueva Trinidad was originally staked by Minera Camargo, SA de CV in 2005.  On December 7, 

2005, the Company, through its 100% owned affiliate Oro Gold de Mexico S.A. de C.V. ("Oro Gold 

Mexico"), entered into an Assignment of Rights agreement with Minera Camargo, whereby the 

Company acquired 100% of the mineral rights to the Nueva Trinidad concession for a 0.5 to 1.0% 

NSR royalty consideration, depending on the price of gold.  This agreement is registered with the 

Direccion General de Minas, Registro Publico de Mineria. 

The purchase option on the San Miguel concession, which was listed in the previous NI 43-101 was 

cancelled by both parties in 2010 as the concession was not considered to be a key concession and 

did not have any current resources. 

On February 6, 2006 the Company, through Oro Gold Mexico, entered into an Exploration 

Agreement with Purchase Option (as amended) with a group of owners for the acquisition of 100% 

interest of, among others, the concessions Nancy, La Poderosa and Santa Cesilia in consideration 

for staged cash payments over time.  A sliding scale NSR royalty of 0.5 to 1.5% depending on the 

price of gold also applies.  The agreement is registered with the Direccion General de Minas, 

Registro Publico de Mineria. 

La Patilla II and San Carlos were staked by the Company through Oro Gold Mexico in 2011 and 

therefore are not subject to a royalty with a third part. 

2.5 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 
All information presented in this section has been provided by Marlin Gold and has not been 

independently verified by SRK.  However, the authors are not aware of any environmental issues on 

the Property.  Tailings, stockpiles dumps, a heap-leach pad and water-filled open pit occur in the 

Trinidad resource area.

In order to obtain a permit for construction and exploitation, Exploraciones Eldorado was required to 

file a mine reclamation plan. This plan was summarized by Exploraciones Eldorado in their pre-

feasibility study for Trinidad, and includes pit-slope stabilization, back-filling and contouring, and 

leach pad neutralization.  The mean pit slope is currently about 70°, clearly indicating that at least 

part of the reclamation has not taken place. 

Marlin Gold recorded the surface conditions on digital photos and video prior to commencing 

exploration activities.  The authors are informed by the Company, that no environmental issues are 

known to exist on the property. 

According to Marlin Gold, all required permits that are currently necessary for Marlin Gold's activities 

at Trinidad have been obtained, and are in good standing. Nautilus completed the environmental 

assessment and permitting requirements to dewater the historic pit.  A pumping permit was approved 

by the National water commission of Mexico (CNA).  Copies of the permits are available in Marlin 

Gold's site files. 

SRK has not conducted an investigation as to the current status of all the required permits.  At this 

time, SRK is not aware of any outstanding permits or any non-compliant at the project or nearby 

exploration sites. 

2.6 Other Significant Factors and Risks 
No other risk factors were identified.

3 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography (Item 5) 

3.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 
Topographic relief across the property is about 1,640 m, with a maximum elevation of about 1,700 

masl.  Most of the rural population lives in the valley, in small, closely spaced villages.  Land use is 

free-range cattle grazing and subsistence agriculture.  The hydrology is dominated by the Baluarte 

river that runs through the northwest corner of the property and its tributaries, the Matatan river and 

Agua Zarca river draining the central and southern part of the property.  Except for the Baluarte river, 

flow is intermittent through the year, occurring only during the summer rainy season (July through 

September).    

3.2 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
Rainy season is July to the end of September.  The average annual temperature is 24.9° C 

(Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995), and the average annual precipitation is 1,067 mm.  The greatest 

rainfall occurs in July, averaging 310 mm.  Access to the southern extreme of the property is difficult 

during the rainy season due to swollen rivers and the fact that the road crosses the river in about 

seven locations.  Access to the campsite and Taunus areas is not an issue during the rainy season, 

however, on occasion the Baluarte river may swell to levels that make crossing the river unsafe.  The 

river usually subsides within a few hours, making crossing possible again. 

3.3 Sufficiency of Surface Rights 
SRK has not independently verified Marlin Gold's surfaces rights to the Trinidad/Taunus property. 

In May 2011, Marlin Gold's 100% affiliate Oro Gold de Mexico SA de CV entered into a 15-year 

exploitation and temporary occupation agreement with the Community of Maloya whereby Marlin 

Gold was granted surface use and mine development rights on the Taunus deposit.  The community 

is supportive of a mining operation and has voted in favor of building a mine on the community 

ground.  

3.4 Accessibility and Transportation to the Property 
The Trinidad property is accessed from the Mazatlan-Tepic highway (Federal Highway 15) to the 

town of Rosario, and by gravel roads eastward of Esquinapa, or Rosario.  The gravel road passes 

through the villages of Palmarito and Buena Vista.  The Taunus and Colinas resource area is 

situated adjacent to the town of Buena Vista, approximately three hours by vehicle southeast of 

Mazatlan, and about 1.5 hours (42 km) east of Rosario (Figure 3-1).  It is located in the south-central 

part of the Trinidad property.  Mazatlan is serviced daily by international airline flights from Los 

Angeles, California and Tucson, Arizona, USA, as well as numerous international flights.

3.5 Infrastructure Availability and Sources 
SRK finds the local resources and infrastructure adequate to support the current exploration program 

and anticipated potential future mining operations. 

 Power 3.5.1

Electrical supply is supplied from a substation in Rosario.  A three-phase line using four cables 

supplies electricity to the town of Buena Vista where the resource is located.  The capacity of the line 

is 33,000 volts utilizing "000" type conductors.  The line will need to be upgraded for future mining 

and processing requirements.

 Water 3.5.2

Water for the exploration camp is supplied from a well in Buena Vista.  The water is pumped from a 

well into a water tank which supplies the community with water.  Another well and water network is 

located in the town of Maloya.  Additional water wells will be required for mining and processing 

requirements. 

 Port 3.5.3

A deep water port is located in Mazatlan, 100 km west of the project. 

 Buildings and Ancillary Facilities 3.5.4

Marlin Gold has refurbished the Exploraciones Eldorado offices as well as the old plant site.  Both 

facilities are used as offices and sleeping quarters.   

 Camp Site 3.5.5

The exploration camp can house and feed approximately 30 people and has running water and 

electricity.  It is reasonable to assume that these facilities can be upgraded for any potential future 

mining requirements. 

 Mining Personnel 3.5.6

The current number of workers is variable, depending on the exploration programs, and ranges 

between 10 and 50 people.  Local skilled labor for mining operations is available from the 

communities of Maloya and Buena Vista, which have a combined population of approximately 200 

people.   

 Tailings Storage Area 3.5.7

There are no tailings disposal areas.  There is sufficient land available for tailings storage for future 

operations. 

 Waste Disposal Area 3.5.8

There is a historic heap leach pad and waste rock disposal area.  Adequate locations for waste rock 

disposal and heap leach pads are available to accommodate the current resources for future 

operations.

4 History (Item 6) 
This section presents the property ownership changes and a short description of any exploration 

activities and mineral resources defined prior to Marlin Gold acquiring this property.  Any exploration 

results and/or mineral resource presented in this section are historic and presented only for context 

related to the current exploration and mineral resource defined in this report.  No part of this 

information has been updated or reviewed by the current QP's and all mineral resource estimates 

are no longer current. 

4.1 Prior Ownership 
The Trinidad deposit was discovered by Porfidio Tirado Beltran, a Mexican "gambusino" who worked 

the iron-oxide rich veins for gold near the village of Buena Vista.  To the south and north of Buena 

Vista, the towns of Pilas de Estancia and Maloya were centers for small-scale placer gold 

operations.  In the 1980's, an exploration campaign by Anaconda culminated in 1,804 m of diamond 

drilling before it left Mexico in 1988.  East of Pilas de Estancia, the Guayabo deposit was worked by 

"gambusinos" for tungsten in the 1980's.  In 1992, Almaden Resources Corporation (Almaden) 

acquired the Trinidad Property, and increased the land position by staking.  In 1993 Exploraciones 

Eldorado acquired an option to earn a 51% interest in the property and Almaden optioned 51% 

interest the Property to Exploraciones Eldorado in 1993 and Exploraciones Eldorado acquired its 

51% interest in 1995 by completing a feasibility study for the mine.  The joint-venture eventually 

increased the size of the Property to about 20,000 ha.  After a short RC drill campaign, they defined 

a non NI 43-101 compliant resource of 3,682,000 t of 1.6 g/t Au or 176,736 oz Au (Almaden 

Resources Corporation, News Release October 2, 1996).    

4.2 Historical Exploration Work 
Past exploration is summarized by Eldorado (Robertson and Thomson, 1994; Exploraciones 

Eldorado, 1995).  There are anecdotal reports of Hispanic and pre-Hispanic exploitation.  The first 

recorded exploration occurred in 1982 when Porfirio Tirado Beltran acquired the concessions and 

produced a small quantity of gold from the Taunus and Bocas areas. 

Anaconda Minerals Corp. started exploration in the area in 1984, through its Mexican subsidiary, 

Cobre de Hercules, S.A.  They completed soil sampling, geologic mapping, and bulldozer trenching 

and sampling in Taunus and Bocas areas, and elsewhere in the district.  Their results indicated a 

gold mineralized zone at Taunus, of 7 to 30 m wide, and 335 m long.  Nineteen holes were drilled 

between 1985 and 1988, totaling 1,803.9 m.  Of these holes, 14 or 1,209.3 m were collared in the 

Taunus area. 

In 1993, Exploraciones Eldorado, conducted mapping, sampling, trenching and soil sampling.  In 

1994, they initiated a reverse circulation drill program comprising 75 holes and 4,008 m of drilling, 

followed by 4,226 m of drilling in 77 holes in the Taunus area, with an additional 300 m in 28 holes, 

intended as condemnation holes.  Four more RC condemnation holes (390 m of drilling) were drilled 

in 1995.  The next phase of drilling focused on in-fill and resource expansion at Taunus.  A total of 

12,113 m of drilling was completed by Exploraciones Eldorado on 30 m sections, spaced between 15 

and 30 m apart.  The average hole depth is 58 m.

This work formed the basis of a feasibility study completed by Exploraciones Eldorado, prior to 

exploitation of the Taunus zone as an open-pit, heap-leach mine. 

Drilling was conducted after the completion of Exploraciones Eldorado's feasibility report, and during 

production at the Taunus pit.  Marlin Gold has acquired several short progress reports which post-

date the feasibility study and give summary assay composites of 28 RC holes in the Taunus area, 18 

holes in the Colinas area and 18 RC holes in the Bocas area (Flores, 1996; Guilinger, 1997; 

Anonymous, 1996).  These updates do not include geology, sample intervals or assay certificates 

and were not included in the current resource estimate.  This data has been used to guide OGR's 

current exploration in the three areas.  A map showing the location of historic drillholes is provided in 

Figure 7-1.   

4.3 Historic Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 
Anaconda Minerals Company (Anaconda) and Exploraciones Eldorado, and the consultants that 

they contracted made a number of mineral resource estimates (non NI 43-101 compliant).  In 

November 2007, Marlin Gold produced its first mineral resource estimate (NI 43-101 compliant) 

based on historic drillholes.  In June 2008, Marlin Gold produced a NI 43-101 compliant, inferred 

mineral resource estimate shown in Table 4.3.1 at a 0.5 g/t Au gold cut-off.    

Table 4.3.1:  June 2008 Inferred Mineral Resources at a 0.5 g/t Gold Cut-Off 

Tonnage (t) Average Au Grade (g/t) Metal Content (oz)
4,491,800 1.39 200,930 

 

4.4 Historic Production 
According to Exploraciones Eldorado's August 1995 feasibility study (non NI 43-101 compliant), "the 

Trinidad project Minable reserves, calculated at a cut-off grade of 0.50 g/t of gold amount to 2.077 Mt 

at a grade of 1.98 g/t of ore, or 132,266 total troy ounces with an average strip ratio of 1.68.  On an 

average basis, 540,000 t of ore per year will be mined, crushed and leached to produce 20,000 to 

30,000 oz-t of gold."  

Based on Exploraciones Eldorado's annual reports of 1996, 1997 and 1998, production from the 

Taunus Pit commenced in 1996, and 51,692 oz of gold was produced from Trinidad prior to shutting 

down their Mexican operations in the fall of 1998.

5 Geological Setting and Mineralization (Item 7) 

5.1 Regional Geology 
Section 5.1 has been excerpted from the Jutras and Powell, 2008 Technical Report.  Changes 

to headings and standardizations have been made to suit the format of this report.  Changes 

to the text are enclosed in brackets or in sentences containing SRK. 

The project lies within the moderately extended part of the Tertiary Basin-and-Range Province, and 

is underlain by Tertiary volcanic, volcaniclastic and intrusive rocks of the Sierra Madre Occidental 

geologic province.  These rocks comprise late Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic arc rocks of largely 

intermediate composition, and upper Oligo-Miocene ignimbrites (Barrios Rodriguez et al., 1999; 

Robertson and Thomson, 1994; Garcia Padilla et al., 2000).  Intermediate to felsic intrusions are 

exposed at low topographic level, and are likely part of the Laramide Sinaloa Batholith, which 

extends from southern Sinaloa into Arizona.  Quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusive rocks intrude mid-

Tertiary andesite volcanic rocks, suggesting a mid-Tertiary or younger age for this intrusive unit.   

Jurassic to lower Tertiary plutonic and sedimentary basement rocks of the Guerrero Terrane are 

exposed in the region, but have not been identified on the property.  Regional topography is 

controlled by NW- and ENE-trending oblique extensional faults of Tertiary age. 

The Trinidad property occurs within the Rosario mining district, of which the Rosario mine was 

probably the most significant past Au-Ag producer (Figure 3-1).  The ore mined in the district was 

predominantly exploited from gold-rich intermediate sulfidation veins hosted by NW- and ENE-

trending faults (Tarnocai and Fonseca, 2006).  At Guayabo and La Viguita on the Trinidad property, 

small-scale exploitation of W-Mo veins was recorded.  Figure 5-1 shows the location of precious 

metal mineral occurrences and past producers in the Trinidad area.

5.2 Local Geology 
The Taunus resource area occurs in a local low lying area on the eastern margin of a broad 

northwest trending valley.  The Taunus area is underlain by a sequence of mid-Tertiary andesitic 

flows and volcaniclastic units.  The volcanic units have a gentle to moderate dip to the east.  

Contacts between units appear to be associated with the NW-SE trending Taunus Fault system. 

5.3 Property Geology 
The Taunus resource area lies near the contact between intermediate volcanic rocks to the west, 

and felsic intrusive to sub-intrusive rocks to the east.  The contact between the two units forms a 

narrow "v" shape with the andesitic units to the west and a quartz feldspar porphyry breccia at the 

center of the "v".  The eastern contact is defined by the near vertical, north-south trending Chandler 

Fault.  This fault forms the eastern wall of the current pit and is the boundary between the quartz 

feldspar porphyry breccia to the west and a fractured quartz feldspar porphyry to the east (Figure 5-

2).

In cross section, the north-south trending Chandler fault marks a boundary between intensely 

fractured and brecciated units to the west and moderately fractured to massive rocks to the east.  On 

the western side of the Chandler fault, the upper 200 m consists of felsic to intermediate volcanic – 

subvolcanic units that are intensely fractured to brecciated underlain by a semi-consolidated 

andesitic conglomerate (Figure 5-3).

conglomerate, a massive andesite interpreted to be a flow, and an andesitic–dacitic lithic tuff.  The 

lithic tuff is intensely clay altered and pyritic in all of the holes that have intersected this unit.  The 

relationship between the two lowest units has not been established.   

Gold is hosted in two main zones at Taunus, the Eldorado zone, which was outcropping when 

Exploraciones Eldorado started mining operations in 1996.  A portion of the zone still exists below 

the bottom of the current pit.  The second zone is called the HS zone and was discovered by Marlin 

Gold in 2009 zone which was discovered by Marlin Gold and is located approximately 30 m below 

the Eldorado zone or approximately 150 m below surface.  The zones are discussed in more detail in 

section 7. 

 Local Lithology and Alteration 5.3.1

Eight lithologic units have been identified and systematically logged in the Taunus resource area.  

Figure 5-3 is a schematic sketch of the units shown on a generalized east west cross section through 

the historic pit. 

Petrographic and megascopic descriptions are based on observations by Frank Powell and 

descriptions provided by Enrique Quintanilla (Quintanilla, E, 2011).  

QFP – Quartz Feldspar Porphyry 

The QFP is a buff to light pink colored porphyritic apahanitic rhyolite composed of medium grained 

euhedral feldspar crystals, quartz eyes and minor biotite as fine grained subhedral laths.  The QFP 

outcrops to the east of the north-south trending Chandler fault and in the north-east face of the 

historic Taunus pit.  The QFP has been observed mainly in diamond drillholes which have crossed 

the Chandler fault from the west at depths of about 200m vertically.   

Alteration of the QFP as observed in drillholes is variable with zones of hydrothermal biotite which 

occur as fine grained shredded biotite in the groundmass and as occasional centimetric biotite veins.  

Silicic alteration is present as cloudy white silica flooding in the groundmass sometimes forming a 

clast supported breccia texture.   

Geochemical anomalies in the QFP have not been detected east of the Chandler fault.  To the west 

of the Chandler fault, the QFP outcrops at the northeastern portion of the pit.  The QFP in this area is 

moderately to intensely fractured.  Approximately six vertical meters of this unit is exposed in the pit.  

The lower contact is a low angle fault which puts the overlying QPF in contact with the BQP below. 

In thin section, the QFP is characterized by a porphyrytic-aphanitic texture composed of reabsorbed 

quartz (15 to 25%), crystalline potassic feldspars (40 to 50%) and plagioclase laths (30 to 40%).  The 

groundmass is composed of fine grained crystalline feldspars and to a lesser extent very fine grained 

quartz.  Electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) indicates the composition of the plagioclase is 

labradorite (An50-70) and the alkaline feldspars are anorthoclase (Figure 5-4).

BQP – Quartz Feldspar Porphyry Breccia 

The BQP is the main host of gold mineralization in the HS zone at Taunus, it is also considered to be 

the main host of gold in the Eldorado zone based on historic descriptions.   

The BQP appears to be the same lithology as the QFP, but is separated as a mappable unit in both 

outcrop and core based on its textural characteristic of being a clast to matrix supported breccia.  

Clasts vary in size from large boulders up to several meters in size to pebbles, and are angular to 

subangular.  The matrix is predominately composed of rock flour although in places the rock flour 

appears to have weathered to clay (Figure 5-5). 

 

Note:  A) BQP from diamond drillhole 09TR025 at 139.8 m.  This sample shows a clast that appears fairly fresh next to a 
bleached, sericitic clast.  B) Outcrop of the clast supported breccia in the Bocas area.

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

Alteration of the BQP in hand specimen is variable.  Silicic alteration usually occurs as microveins of 

cloudy quartz, and less commonly, silica flooding of the matrix.  Selective clay alteration of the 

feldspars can be observed locally.  In this type of alteration, the feldspars are variably replaced by 

clay, probably after sericite.  Where the alteration is more intense the clay is often washed out 

leaving lath shaped vugs.  This type of alteration appears to be spatially related to the HBX which is 

the main host of gold at Taunus.   

In thin section, the BQP is very similar in composition to the QFP.  Alteration observed in this section 

consists of variable silica flooding of the matrix and microveinlets of quartz.  Moderate choritization of 

biotite is also observed.  

HBX – Hydrothermal Breccia (Figure 5-6) 

The gold bearing zones at Taunus are directly associated with the HBX.  The HBX is a chaotic, 

polymictic, clast to matrix supported breccia.  The majority of the clasts are intensely silicified often 

obliterating original textures.  Multiple silica events are recorded resulting in silicified clasts rimmed 

by silica, goethite, hematite and chlorite.  The clasts are angular to sub- angular and vary in size 

from small pebbles to large boulders.  The matrix is often orange red to red and generally composed 

of rock flour +/- clay.   

The HBX occurs as distinct units which vary in thickness from 6 m to over 50 m.  The HBX units 

occur at or near the contact between other rocks types and generally follow the trends of the other 

volcanic units.  At least three stacked zones of HBX have been mapped with diamond drilling in the 

northern portion of the Taunus resource.  Additional units are inferred to exist in the upper Eldorado 

zone however this has not been confirmed with drilling to date.  The HBX bodies measure 50 to 100 

m wide in an east west direction 4 to 50 m thick and have a strike extent of approximately 300 m.  

The HBX is interpreted as representing multiple silica events in a structurally active zone that has 

been brecciated, and subject to multiple pulses of silica +/- gold +/- iron +/- chlorite.  It is likely that 

the last event was a tectonic event which produced the rock flour and did not have associated silica.   

Alteration is dominated by silica flooding which has usually destroyed original rock textures in hand 

specimens.  Occasional faint textures are discernable which are similar to the QFP and/or Andesite.  

Rare, fairly fresh clasts of both QFP and Andesite have been mapped within the HBX unit, usually 

close to the contacts with other units.  Iron oxides are very common within the HBX as staining and 

as occasional rims on clasts.  Specular hematite is common as fine grained disseminated 

aggregates.  Chlorite and/or other massive green/grey minerals also occur as rims on clasts and are 

often associated with higher gold grades.  Vuggy texture in the HBX is not uncommon and is inferred 

to be from weathering of other minerals.  Visible gold is rare, but has been identified in several 

samples with gold assays greater than 30g/t.  Most of the visible gold that has been identified occurs 

as very fined grained gold in vugs or open spaces.  Sulfide minerals are extremely rare, however 

very minor amounts of fine grained pyrite, galena and sphalerite have been identified.  Secondary 

minerals include rare chrysocolla, often associated with higher gold grades and manganese.  A 

grass green mineral inferred to be motramite-descloizite is often associated with the HBX.  This 

mineral series is a secondary lead-zinc-copper vanadanite and is described as a secondary mineral 

frequently found principally in the oxidized zone of ore deposits (mindat.org). 

In thin section, remnant porphyritic textures similar to the QFP are observed.  The rock matrix is 

largely silicified and cut by quartz veinlets commonly with disseminated or aggregate specular 

hematite.  Three types of alteration were observed in the groundmass: 1) quartz-sericite-pyrite (now

The AND is a green/grey massive medium to fine grained porphyritic andesite.  This unit outcrops at 

the northern end of Bocas and has been encountered in drillholes below the conglomerate (CNG) 

and polymictic breccia (BVC). 

The andesite often has calcite veining and is usually propylitically altered.  Disseminated fine grained

BAN - Andesite Breccia  (Figures 5-8 and 5-9 ) 

The BAN is a matrix supported breccia with dominantly andesite clasts.  Clasts are angular to 

subangular and range in size from 1 to 20 cm.  Angular clasts of carbonate veins are not uncommon 

in this unit.  The matrix is composed of rock flour to clay.   

This unit is intercalated with the BVC in the western side of the Taunus pit and it is the dominant rock 

type in the southern portion of the pit.  Several occurrences of HBX and associated gold zones occur 

in the southern portion of the Taunus resource area.

BVC – Polymictic Breccia (Figures 5-9, 5-10 and 5-11,) 

The BVC is a heterogenous, matrix supported breccia.  Clasts are chaotic and angular to 

subrounded.  The size of the clasts varies from 1cm to more than 1m.  The majority of the clasts 

have an andesitic composition.  Texturally, approximately 80% of the clasts are massive and 

interpreted to be derived from andesitic flows, the rest of the clasts are interpreted to be derived from 

andestic tuffs and ignimbrites.  The matrix is a brown to orange rock flour and in places can be 

coarser grained giving it a sandy appearance.   

Alteration is quite variable in this unit with some clasts moderately to strongly propylitically altered 

and other clasts are moderately to strongly bleached and sericitized.  

This unit does not appear to be an important host to gold mineralization, although some gold 

anomalies are associated with this unit, usually close to the contact with the HBX.

CNG – Conglomerate (Figure 5-12) 

The CNG is a multicolored, heterolithic, matrix supported conglomerate.  The clast distribution is 

chaotic.  This unit is differentiated from the BVC due to the roundness of the clasts.  It has been 

encountered at depth, below the BQP on northwest side of the chandler fault.

LTFF - Lithic Tuff (Figure5-13) 

The LTFF is a grey-green, dacitic, lithic tuff.  Textures in this unit vary from massive to laminated.  In 

some places the unit displays a fine laminar banding with irregular ragged shaped clasts interpreted 

to be juvenile fragments.   

This unit has been intersected in several deep holes below the conglomerate as well as at depth in 

the southern portion of the pit area.   

The LTFF is displays intense quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration in all of the places it has been 

intersected in drilling.  Often the contact is strongly oxidized giving it an earthy red color for several 

meters and then it grades into a sulfide stable green-grey color.  The oxide zone is usually massive 

clay and several holes have been lost in this unit since they were not able to penetrate the massive 

clay.   

Gold or other geochemical anomalies have not been identified in this unit to date, however the 

intensity of the alteration in the deepest portions of the current drill coverage indicates that the 

mineralized system is still open at depth.

 Alteration 5.3.2

The bulk of gold mineralization is contained in the HBX which displays multiple stages of silicification 

and brecciation.  Quartz-sericite-hematite (after pyrite) alteration has been identified in thin section 

within the HBX unit in the HS zone.  Quartz sericite pyrite has also been identified at depth in the 

LTFF unit below the current resource.  

The entire resource area is strongly oxidized which tends to mask original alteration minerals apart 

from silica.  Specular hematite is often observed in the BQP and HBX units.  Strong iron oxide 

staining and fracture coating is generally associated with gold mineralization.  

Alteration in the individual units is discussed in the previous section.    

 Structure 5.3.3

Section 5.3.3 has been excerpted from Goodman S. 2010, an SRK structural geology memo.   

The gold deposits in the Taunus area lie within a NW-SE trending structural 'corridor', and are 

hosted within a variety of siliceous breccias developed in volcanic and volcaniclastic host rocks.  

Much of the breccia at Taunus appears to be tectonic in origin i.e. breccia related to repeated fault 

movement, although volcanic and hydrothermal processes have also produced breccias and/or 

modified fault breccia.

The Chandler fault is a subvertical structure, trending N-S, which bounds the deposit to the east.  It 

can be traced for several kilometers northwards from the Taunus area, however south of the pit it is 

not easily identified, suggesting a step in the N-S fault system, probably along an E-W fault trend.  

The last phase of movement on the Chandler fault is considered to be post-gold event, as the fault 

cuts mineralized zones without showing alteration or mineralization within the fault zone.  A 

precursor to the late fault was probably a controlling structure to the mineralized system, however, as 

there is a spatial relationship between fault termination and hydrothermal activity. 

To the west of the Chandler fault there is a lozenge-shaped zone containing the known gold 

mineralization, which is delineated by faults in a variety of orientations, as identified by ground 

mapping, drillhole intersections and by IP survey data.  The degree of brecciation and silicification 

along the fault planes precludes kinematic analysis from fault plane structures; however the fault 

pattern is consistent with that characteristic of a right-lateral strike-slip system.  The fault network 

may have formed on a releasing bend on the Chandler Fault, located on a step or jog in the N-S fault 

system, as suggested by the apparent southerly termination of the Chandler fault.  

Irregularities on strike-slip fault systems tend to focus fluid flow as they are zones of localized intense 

deformation, with steep structure able to tap fluids from depth.  Gold mineralization in the Taunus 

area is closely correlated with fault breccias along steep structures and their intersections.  Within 

the fault bounded domain, flat-lying breccia zones have developed as accommodation structures 

linking steep faults, possibly along original bedding orientation.  These flat-lying breccias are also 

gold-mineralized as they provided fluid pathways at the time of hydrothermal fluid migration.  

On a regional scale, three main phases of deformation can be distinguished: pre-mineralization 

regional compression during the Laramide orogeny which caused the margin-parallel NW-SE 

structural grain of the area; the change to a right-lateral strike-slip regime coincident with 

hydrothermal activity and gold mineralization centered on steps in the fault system; and post-

mineralization Basin and Range style extension which reactivated the pre-existing fault network to 

produce tilted fault block architecture.  

The prospective stratigraphy of the lower volcanic complex is best exposed in valleys, due to the 

geometry of the tilted fault blocks; however the distribution of mineralized zones is controlled by the 

pre-existing strike-slip fault system.  In a right-lateral strike slip system, right stepping jogs are zones 

of dilation that may focus fluid flow; in this area N-S trending segments such as the Chandler fault 

represent right-stepping jogs within the overall NW-SE structural corridor.

Descriptions of mineralization at Taunus are provided by Eldorado (Robertson and Thoman, 1994; 

Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995) from geologic work completed prior to open-pit mining.  Three 

mineralized areas were defined along a northerly striking corridor, from Colinas in the south, through 

Taunus, and Bocas in the north (Figure 5-14).  All three areas received historic artisanal exploitation.  

Only the Taunus area has experienced detailed modern exploration and exploitation.

 Mineralized Zones 5.4.1

Taunus Zone 

Potentially economic mineralization identified by Marlin Gold and Eldorado (Robertson and 

Thomson, 1994; Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995) at Taunus (Figure 5-15) is consistent with intensely 

silicified tectonic and quartz-matrix hydrothermal breccia, with chlorite and hematite, and occasional 

adularia.  Quartz-textures are described as massive, fine-grained and cherty, drusy coatings, 

colloform banding and cockscomb.  Amethyst also occurs in the Taunus area.  Distal alteration is 

described as quartz veinlets in both andesite and quartz-feldspar porphyritic rocks, and weak 

propylitic alteration in the andesite rocks.  Carbonate minerals are not reported, but may occur 

outside of areas affected by sulfide weathering. 

The breccia zones are hosted within a quartz-feldspar porphyry unit, and its contact with adjacent 

andesite rocks.  This lithologic contact is described as both structural, and intrusive in nature. 

Silicified breccia bodies in the Eldorado zone dip steeply east in the southern part of the Taunus 

area, and sub-horizontal to shallow east-dipping in the central and northern part of the Taunus zone.  

The breccia zone appears to be constrained between the Colinas, Taunus and Chandler faults.  The 

HS zone is located below the Eldorado zone and has a shallow easterly dip in the northern part of 

the taunus area, the zone is not well contrained in the southern part of taunus (Figure 5-15).  

Eldorado (Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995) interprets breccia-hosted mineralization as a relatively 

high-level expression of a precious metal epithermal system, overlying a moderate to steep-dipping 

north-south trending "feeder" structure. 

Metallic assay analysis and petrographic evaluation of gold-bearing specimens, conducted by 

Metcon Research and Sid Williams on behalf of Eldorado (Robertson and Thomson, 1994; 

Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995) indicate gold occurs as native gold, is fine-grained, and is not subject 

to appreciable "nugget" effect.  They report an Ag:Au ratio of 6:1, making Taunus a relatively gold-

rich intermediate sulfidation-state epithermal system.  The area evaluated by Exploraciones 

Eldorado is entirely within the supergene oxidation zone.  Primary sulfide minerals are therefore rare, 

comprising very minor pyrite and chalcopyrite, digenite, and covelite.  Copper occurs as the 

secondary copper minerals chrysocolla and malachite, and with Pb and Zn as a secondary vanadian 

mineral, mottramite.  Silver occurs as native silver, and jalpaitite.  Silver and the base metal elements 

are reported to have a good positive correlation, and very poorly correlated with gold. 

Colinas and Bocas Zones 

The Colinas zone (Figure 5-15) extends southward from the Taunus zone, along the Colinas fault.  

Quartz veins occur within chlorite and hematite altered andesite volcanic rock wallrocks.  Eldorado 

(Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995) describes the style of alteration as similar, but weaker than the 

Taunus zone.  Auriferous mineralization at Colinas was historically exploited by artisanal miners.  

Bocas Zone 

The Bocas zone (Figure 5-16), 275 m north of Taunus, hosts artisanal gold exploitation.  

Mineralization occurs as cobbles and boulders of hematite-rich silicified breccia, visually identical to 

ore material exploited by Exploraciones Eldorado from the Taunus pit.  It is interpreted as a shallow-

dipping layer of colluvial material, in the hangingwall of a post-mineral fault.

Type, Character and Distribution of Mineralization 

Petrographic descriptions were completed on two polished thin sections collected from panned 

concentrates of two metallurgical samples from the HS zone.  The samples were composites of PQ 

half–core from diamond drillhole 10TR034.  The first sample represents 18 m down hole and was 

collected from the interval 132 to 150 m.  The average core recovery from this interval is 87% and is 

considered to be good core recovery; the weighted average grade was 10.7g/t gold.  The second 

sample represents 16.5 m and was collected from the interval 150 to 165.5 m.  The average core 

recovery from this interval is 40% and is considered to be poor recovery; the weighted average 

grade was 7.8 g/t gold. 

The style of mineralization and alteration is conserved to be representative of the HS zone based on 

geologic logging of other diamond holes in the same zone.    

The following results are extracted from the report prepared by Economic Geology Consulting, 

March 6, 2010. 

Petrographic descriptions are based on preserved textures/mineralogy in small chips, typically <4 

mm.  Many of the chips are from a porphyritic igneous rock that includes resorbed quartz 

phenocrysts, and euhedral feldspar and biotite phenocrysts in a finely crystalline matrix of vuggy, 

granular to reticulate quartz, locally chalcedonic. 

Gold occurs in vugs and less commonly in a goethite replacement of pyrite or encapsulated within 

the quartz matrix. 

The rock matrix is largely silicified and cut by quartz veinlets commonly with disseminated or 

aggregate specular hematite. 

Three types of alteration were observed in the groundmass: 1) quartz-sericite-pyrite (now hematite), 

2) hydrothermal biotite flooding and 3) hydrothermal specular hematite. 

Results from the petrographic analysis are consistent with megascopic observations by Marlin Gold's 

geologists who have described the HS zone as a matrix supported breccia where the matrix is 

composed of a red/orange hematitic rock flour/clay.  Clasts are described as subangular multi-phase 

silica often displaying colliform banding of calcedonic quartz, goethite and a dark grey green mineral 

interpreted to be chlorite/biotite.  Qualitatively the higher grades appear to be associated with the 

presence of fine laminations chlorite/biotite.    

Visible gold is rare and has only been observed in a few core samples with assay grades over 30 g/t.  

When observed it has been very fine grained gold in open vugs or associated with vuggy hematite.     

The Taunus deposit is a complex deposit composed of a number in individual zones.  Ten individual 

solids were modeled in the Taunus area based on geology and grade.  The two main zones are the 

Eldorado Zone and the HS Zone.   

The Eldorado zone was modeled using 4 different zones.  These zones extend from Bocas in the 

north to El Tanque in the south, a distance of 1.4 km.  The main portion of the Eldorado zone located 

in the pit is approximately 125 m wide in an east west direction and extends for approximately 625 m 

in a north south direction.  The entire zone is approximately 95 m thick and is composed of three 

zones which average about 15 m in thickness.

The HS Zone is located approximately 30 m below the Eldorado zone and starts at a depth of about 

150 m below surface.  The HS zone was modeled using six different zones.  The main zone 

measures approximately 400 m in a north south direction and about 75 m in an east west 

direction.  The thickness varies between 15 and 40 m with an average thickness of 25 m.  The other 

HS zones are 50 to 250 m in length and about 75 m in an east west direction, with the thickness 

ranging from 5 to 15 m.  The full extents of the HS zone have not been determined to date. 

The Colinas zone is located approximately 350 m southeast of the southern extent of the Eldorado 

zone in El Tanque.  The Colinas resources are based on 12 different zones.  These zones are about 

3 to 15 m in thickness and extend 30 to 100 m in a north south direction and about 40 to 100 m in an 

east west direction.  The Colinas zones are not well understood at this time and significant 

mineralization potential remains in this area.

6 Deposit Type (Item 8) 
Section 6 has been excerpted from the Jutras and Powell, 2008 Technical Report.  Changes to 

headings and standardizations have been made to suit the format of this report.  Changes to 

the text are enclosed in brackets or in sentences containing SRK. 

The Sierra Madre Occidental geologic province is richly endowed with precious metal deposits 

(Staude and Barton, 2001), most of which are considered related to porphyry Cu-(Au), and 

epithermal systems.  Gold mineralization at Trinidad has been described as vein and hydrothermal 

and tectonic breccia-hosted low sulfidation epithermal style mineralization (Robertson and Thoman, 

1994). 

Epithermal vein systems in Mexico largely date from 48 Ma to 18 Ma (Camprubi et al., 2003), and 

are controlled by Tertiary extensional structural fabrics, as is volcanism of the SMO.  In the Sinaloa 

and parts of western Durango region, most precious metal veins are northwest trending, and 

northeast trending.   

Epithermal systems may be classified as high, intermediate, and low sulfidation styles.  They are 

characterized by the sulfidation state of the hypogene sulfide mineral assemblage, and show general 

relations in volcano-tectonic setting, precious and base metal content, igneous rock association, 

proximal hypogene alteration, and sulfide abundance (ie., John, 2001; Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 

2003).  Mineralization in all occurrences is of the type formed under epizonal conditions, that is, 

generally within 2 km of the paleo-surface.  Veins in epithermal systems often display epizonal 

textures indicative of repetitive and sustained open-space filling, and boiling. 

Significant members of the low sulfidation class of epithermal systems include Sleeper, Midas, and 

El Penon.  Those associated with bimodal basalt-rhyolite sequences and subalkaline magmas 

display illite proximal alteration zones, with adularia and local fluorite.  They generally display low 

total sulfide content (<2 volume %).  Base metal sulfides occur in very low abundance, and systems 

tend to be Au-rich.  Selenides are common in some systems.  The alkaline magma associated 

systems are temporally associated with alkaline basalt and trachyte, have roscoelite-bearing 

illite+adularia proximal alteration, more abundant sulfides (up to 10% volume), and selenides are 

uncommon.  Both subclasses contain pyrrhotite, pyrite, and minor arsenopyrite.  Low sulfidation 

epithermal systems often have Ag:Au ≤15, and <200 ppm Cu (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003). 

Low sulfidation epithermal veins are generally not considered transitional to intermediate sulfidation 

state epithermal systems (Sillitoe and Hedenquist, 2003), although this is based solely on the 

different tectonic environments under which they may typically form.  It does not exclude them from 

occurring in a similar area however.  They are related to andesite, rhyodacite and occasionally 

rhyolite sequences.  Adularia is rare to absent in the proximal alteration assemblage, and the gangue 

contains abundant, often manganiferous, carbonate.  Sulfide content in veins typically exceeds 5% 

volume, and comprises pyrite, Fe-poor sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and tennanite-tetrahedrite. 

Selenides and pyrrhotite are uncommon, and Mexican examples tend to be Ag-rich, with Ag:Au 

exceeding 10:1, and often >100:1.  Significant members of the intermediate sulfidation epithermal 

class are well represented in Mexico, and include Fresnillo and Pachuca-Real del Monte.  The 

Plomosas mine at La Rastra, located 19 km northeast of Taunus, has characteristics typical of an 

intermediate sulfidation state vein system.  Although poorly documented, precious metal occurrences

and past-producing mines in the El Rosario district, including those in the El Rosario town area, are 

best characterized by Au-rich intermediate sulfidation state veins (Tarnocai and Fonseca, 2006). 

Most significant members of both classes have vertical mineralized extents of <1 km, often <500 m. 

Mineralized material is hosted by fault-related veins and breccias, and elevated precious metal 

content occurs in plunging, lenticular zones within the plane of the vein (chutes).  Hydrothermal 

breccia and stockwork vein bodies are common in some orebodies (McLaughlin, Cerro Crucitas) and 

may be associated with areas of restricted hydrothermal flow and elevated fluid pressure, and host 

rock mechanical competency (Hedenquist, et al, 2000). 

Vertical zonations in metal content occur in some low and intermediate sulfidation state systems (i.e., 

Albinson et al., 2001).  In systems displaying such zoning, gold, silver, mercury and tellurium are 

relatively enriched in the upper portions of the system, and base metal contents occur in higher 

concentrations at deeper levels in the system. 

The occurrence of precious metal mineralization associated with quartz veins with epizonal textures, 

silicification, and propylitic wallrock alteration, support a low to intermediate sulfidation state vein 

interpretation for the Taunus mineral system.  Apparently hypogene covelite and digenite occur with 

pyrite in the auriferous zone, and suggest intermediate to high sulfidation-state conditions.  The 

authors consider that precious metal mineralization at Taunus is associated with an Au-rich, 

intermediate sulfidation state epithermal vein system.

7 Exploration (Item 9) 
Section 7.1 through 7.1.1 has been excerpted from the Jutras and Powell, 2008 Technical 

Report.  Changes to headings and standardizations have been made to suit the format of this 

report.  Changes to the text are enclosed in brackets or in sentences containing SRK. 

7.1 Historical Exploration Work 
Exploration work conducted prior to Marlin Gold's involvement in the Trinidad property is considered 

historic and is briefly discussed in the history section of this report. 

7.2 Exploration Work Undertaken by Marlin Gold 
Regional-scale exploration work was conducted by Marlin Gold, and by Minera Camargo S.A. de 

C.V. on behalf of Marlin Gold, throughout the Trinidad property during 2005 to 2006.  This led to 

smaller scale exploration work by Marlin Gold within the Trinidad (Taunus) resource area beginning 

in 2007.  Property scale work included prospecting and lithology/alteration mapping, in conjunction 

with the collection of approximately 703 stream sediment samples, 509 rock grab, chip, and channel 

samples, and 482 soil samples.  The objective of the regional exploration program was to provide a 

preliminary geological and geochemical assessment of the regional potential for the area, and to 

better understand the regional geologic framework in which the Trinidad resource area resides.  

In early 2007, Marlin Gold carried out a diamond drill program totaling 727.6 m at its San Miguel gold 

prospect(2), located approximately 4 km due southeast of, and along the same structural trend that 

passes through the Trinidad resource area. 

Additional exploration work focused on defining new drill targets in the Taunus and Colinas areas, as 

well as regional exploration was conducted during the period June to September 2007.  During this 

period 634 channel samples, 15 rock chip samples and 181 soil samples were collected in the 

Taunus and Colinas areas.  Regional exploration consisted of 342 channel samples 150 rock Chip 

samples and 1,152 soil samples.  Results of this program were used to target drillholes for an 8,000 

m diamond and reverse circulation drilling program which commenced in October 2007.  In 

December 2007, Marlin Gold completed ten HQ diamond drillholes in the Taunus and Colinas areas, 

for a total of 1,154 m with a maximum depth of 150 m and an average depth of 110 m.  In January of 

2008 Marlin Gold drilled 34 reverse circulation holes in the Taunus, Colinas and Bocas areas for a 

total of 6,524 m with a maximum depth of 264 m and an average depth of 190 m.  An additional 26 

shallow RC holes to a depth of 20 m were drilled in the Taunus South and Buena Vista town site 

totaling 622 m. 

In 2009 Marlin Gold completed 6,800 m of diamond drilling comprising 27 holes in the Taunus, 

Bocas and Colinas areas.  The focus of this drilling was to define resources at depth in the Taunus 

pit area and to define the extents of the newly discovered HS zone.  Marlin Gold also completed an 

IP and mag survey over the Bocas, Colinas and Taunus areas in an effort to identify new drill targets.  

The geophysical program did identify a broad resistivity anomaly interpreted to be a pull apart basin.  

                                                      
2  The purchase option on the San Miguel concession, which was listed in the previous NI 43-101 
was cancelled by mutual agreement of the parties in 2010.

Subsequent drill testing of a number of geophysical anomalies in the 2010 program did not yield new 

resources.   

In 2010, Marlin Gold completed 5,510 m of diamond drilling in 24 holes in the Colinas, Taunus and 

Bocas areas.  An additional 8,347 m in 69 reverse circulation holes were completed in the same 

areas. Four shallow RC holes were also completed to test for shallow resources in the Taunus south 

area these holes amounted to 122 m.  A pilot sonic drill program of 650 m in 17 holes was completed 

to test the sonic drilling technology and determine the maximum depth that sonic drilling could 

penetrate.  The results of the sonic program were positive and a 5,000 m sonic drill program is 

planned for 2011. 

In 2011, Marlin Gold continued its exploration drill program.  This included the completion of 38 sonic 

drillholes.  This drilling is discussed further in Section 8.  In addition, Marlin Gold completed a 

structural geology study with Sally Goodman, of SRK.  The study involved mapping of structures and 

lithologies within the Taunus Pit as well as the analysis of the regional geological structures. 

Areas Outside of Taunus 

Early-stage exploration work in surrounding areas named Tequila, Cerro Colorado, and San 

Cristobal has been performed.  This includes geophysics, stream sediment sampling, soil sampling, 

grab and trench rock sampling, reverse circulation drilling and diamond drilling.  A summary of the 

work is presented in Table 7.1.1.

The surface sampling and geophysics were done to focus exploration culminating in drill targets.  

Targets were identified, and if warranted, drill programs were planned and executed. 

Significant drill results in the Tequila area are 6 m of 1.72 g/t gold.  However, there are numerous 

intervals of elevated copper and molybdenum with maximum levels of 1,533 ppm Cu and 180 ppm 

Mo. 

At the San Cristobal area, 3 drillholes intersected significantly anomalous values for gold, silver 

copper and molybdenum.  The anomalous gold values range from 30 m at 0.45 g/t to 6 m at 0.67 g/t.  

The most significant silver, copper and molybdenum geochem values are 10 m at 58 ppm, 4 m at 

1,044 ppm and 16 m at 362 ppm, respectively. 

These areas are still under active exploration, but are lower priority than the immediate Taunus 

resource areas, and follow-up exploration programs will be prioritized accordingly.

8 Drilling (Item 10) 
The historic drilling in the Taunus and Colinas resource areas is discussed in Section 4.2 and the 

extents of historic drillholes are show in in Figure 7-1.  Drilling assays and geologic information for 

drillholes completed by Cobre de Hercules, S.A are not available to Marlin Gold.  These holes were 

inclined diamond drillholes.  Later drilling conducted by Exploraciones Eldorado was by reverse 

circulation, in vertical holes.   

8.1 Marlin Gold Drilling, 2007 to 2010 
Marlin Gold commenced diamond drilling on the property in October 2007.  Drill programs between 

2007 and 2010 have been discussed by previous technical reports including Jutras and Powel 

(2008) and Volk (2011). 

8.2 2011 Drilling Program 
The following is a brief synopsis of the new drilling available since the February 2011 mineral 

resource estimate, completed by SRK. 

The previous mineral resource (February 2011) included diamond drill holes to 10TR057 and RC 

holes to 10TRRC076 and did not include any sonic drill hole data. 

Three diamond drill holes were completed in 2010 after the resource cutoff date, all in the southern 

portion of the Taunus area.  All diamond drill holes were drilled by BDW and all RC holes were drilled 

by Drift Drilling. 

Late in 2010, a sonic drill rig was brought in from Boart-Longyear to test the viability of the sonic 

technique due to recovery concerns from traditional diamond drilling methods.  Hole 10TRSN001 

demonstrated that the sonic rig was able to penetrate and recover this material and thus, five more 

holes were drilled to compare results of the sonic technique to the previous methods. 

The late 2010 results indicated that the sonic method would give more accurate results and solve 

many recovery problems.  The sonic drill program commenced in February 2011, with a plan to 

complete 5000 m of drilling.  Unfortunately, the drilling proved to be slower than projected and in 

early June, the program was abandoned because of the inability to maintain stable drill platforms, 

due to the excessive precipitation associated with the seasonal rains.  A total of 3703 m from 32 

holes was completed during the 2010 to 2011 sonic drill program. 

The main target for the drill program was to define a "feeder" zone connecting the shallow 

mineralized zone mined by Eldorado (termed the Eldorado zone by Marlin Gold) and the deeper, 

higher grade zone discovered by Marlin Gold dubbed the HS zone.  There were a few holes testing 

for structural corridors possibly hosting offset mineralization as well, but this type of mineralization 

was not found.  Some exploratory holes were planned in the original 5000 m program, but these 

were not completed because of the truncation of the program. 

As with the historical drillholes, the 2011 sonic holes were challenging to complete due to poor 

ground conditions and the largely unconsolidated coarse breccia material.  This made completion of 

downhole surveys difficult and in 2011, 18 of the 32 sonic drillholes did not have any down hole 

surveys completed.  The lack of down hole surveys does make the spatial location of samples within

these holes slightly uncertain, however the large diameter of the sonic holes (5 to 7 inch) likely 

resulted in relatively small deviations.

8.3 2011 Drilling Procedures 
Drilling was supervised by qualified Marlin Gold geologists who were stationed nearby the drill sites 

24 hours per day during the program.   

Drill locations were planned by a geologist and located on plans and sections.  Once the planned 

drillhole was approved by management, the drillhole location was located in the field by a geologist 

using a GPS.  The geologist flagged the location and supervised the pad construction.  In the case of 

a diamond hole, a sump was usually dug nearby with a backhoe.   

To mark the location of all completed holes, a PVC or a metal tube was cemented into the hole and 

the drillhole number was marked on the tube as well as etched into the cement. 

Down hole survey readings were usually taken once a hole was completed.  Readings were typically 

taken at the bottom of the hole and then every 50 m upward, however many holes did not have 

completed surveys due to unstable ground conditions at the completion of the hole.  Down hole 

surveys were completed utilizing a flex-it down hole tool drawn through the open hole where this was 

possible. 

Due to generally poor sample recovery with conventional diamond core and reverse circulation 

drilling, Marlin Gold employed sonic drilling in the Taunus Pit during 2011, with the objective to 

provide a better measure of grade and continuity of mineralization.  The sonic drilling was completed 

under contract to Boart-Longyear. 

Sonic drilling employs the use of high-frequency, resonate energy to advance a core barrel or casing 

into subsurface formations.  The sonic drill has the capability to recover unconsolidated material with 

a minimum of disturbance as well as coring consolidated material.  Contamination is minimized by 

the process of overriding the core barrel to limit the amount of foreign material that can enter the 

sample.  As there is no wire line system, the complete drill string must be pulled to retrieve the 

sample.  Three sizes of core barrels are used; nominally 5" (12.7 cm), 6" (15.24 cm) and 7" (17.78 

cm).  Typically, the hole will begin with the larger diameter core, reducing with depth. 

Sonic drilling is a relatively new alternative for drilling rock.  The drill uses sonic vibrations applied to 

the pipe to drill and retrieve continuous samples from broken and semi-consolidated material without 

the use of water or mud.  Many types of conventional drilling techniques which rely on fluid or air 

circulation do not efficiently recover soft, unstable, varied and highly broken material. 

8.4 Interpretation and Relevant Results 
SRK is of the opinion that the Marlin Gold drilling operations were conducted in a professional 

manner, and that the RC chips, diamond drill core and sonic drill material were handled, logged and 

sampled in an acceptable manner by professional geologists and the results are suitable for use in 

resource estimation. 

Reputable contractors using industry standards have conducted the drilling.  Drilling conditions on 

the Taunus project are considered to be very challenging due to the nature of the rock in most of the 

resource area.  Unconsolidated breccias have been encountered to depths of 250 to 300 m.  Due to 

these conditions, it is not uncommon to get drilling rods stuck in the hole or lose a drillhole due to 

caving.  As such, drillers need to case the hole as deep as possible and keep the hole "conditioned"

using a variety of drilling muds.  Marlin Gold has worked closely with the drilling contractors to 

develop and refine techniques to optimize the drilling.    

The majority of the historical drilling completed by the previous mining company Exploraciones 

Eldorado was completed using reverse circulation drilling.  Marlin Gold made the initial discovery of 

the HS zone approximately 150 m below the current pit bottom by using RC drilling.  Subsequent 

diamond twins of the RC holes were substantially higher grade than their RC counterparts.  

Additional twins and closely spaced diamond drillholes confirmed that the RC drilling had a 

consistent and substantial low bias as compared to the diamond holes.  Due to this bias, Marlin Gold 

has restricted the use of RC drilling to initially identify new targets.  Resource drilling has been 

dominated by diamond drilling.  While diamond drilling appears to produce more reliable results, 

recovery is often an issue due to the unconsolidated nature of the rock in the area.     

In an effort to determine the most suitable drilling technique for the unique rock conditions at Taunus, 

Marlin Gold tested and then utilized sonic drilling techniques in late 2010 and all 2011 drilling.  

Results from this test program indicate that sonic drilling was able to achieve a maximum depth of 

200 m below surface with nearly 100% recovery of the unconsolidated material.  The sonic drill was 

also able to penetrate up to several meters of hard rock.   

Completing down hole surveys remains a challenge in the Taunus area, as the poor rock conditions 

within the breccias result in drill holes collapsing quickly after completion.  This is especially true with 

the sonic drillholes where the flex-it tool is manually lowered below the drill rods.  The paucity of 

down hole surveys in the 2011 data, creates some uncertainty regarding mineralization volumes, 

however SRK believes that this is mitigated by the early drilling data as well as the dense drill holes 

spacing.

9 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security (Item 11) 

9.1 Drill Hole Sampling 
Historic sample data was obtained from Exploraciones Eldorado's Feasibility study drill programs; 

they describe their sampling and procedures in their Feasibility and summary geology reports 

(Robertson and Thomson, 1994; Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995).   

All Eldorado drillholes were completed by reverse circulation, collecting samples at 2 m intervals.  

For dry holes, a double cyclone was used to minimize loss of fine material.  A rotary splitter was 

used for wet holes, and in some cases, a series of two rotary splitters were used.  Samples were 

collected from both outlets of the splitter.  Flocculent was used to facilitate sedimentation of fine 

material in pails before collection in sample bags.  Sample bags were "micropore" sample bags.  For 

dry samples, a Jones splitter was used to reduce sample size to between 2 and 5 kilograms. 

During the 2007 to 2011 drill program, Marlin Gold sampled both diamond and reverse circulation 

drillholes.  Diamond sample intervals were marked by a geologist using pink flagging and sample 

tags.  Intervals were based on geology and have a minimum length of 40c m and a maximum length 

of 2 m.  Recovery and RQD was measured on all sample intervals.  Drill core was photographed in 

both wet and dry conditions, using a digital camera.  Diamond drill samples were cut in half with a 

gas powered diamond core saw.  Half samples were placed in a plastic bag with a sample number 

and sealed with a plastic tie and sent to the Inspectorate sample prep facility in Durango, Mexico.  

Reverse circulation chips were sampled on 2 m intervals at the drill rig.  Drilling consisted of two 12 

hour shifts and sampling was under direct supervision of a geologist on both shifts.  For dry holes 

samples were collected using a cyclone into a large plastic bag inside a rice bag.  Dry samples were 

weighed to check for recovery and then split at site with a Jones splitter.  The Jones splitter was 

cleaned with compressed air between samples.  Wet samples were collected using a rotary splitter 

into plastic pails.  The rotary splitter was set to split the samples into a ¼ and ¾ splits.  The ¼ split 

was transferred from the bucket into clear plastic bags and sealed with a plastic tie.  Samples were 

left to settle and small holes were poked in the top of the bags when the water was clear to drain.  

On occasion, samples were composed of colloidal material which did not settle, these samples were 

placed in large double plastic bags inside a rice bag and sent in their entirety to the inspectorate 

sample prep lab in Durango.   

Due to generally poor sample recovery with conventional diamond core and reverse circulation 

drilling, Marlin Gold employed 'sonic' drilling in the Taunus Pit during 2011, with the objective to 

provide a better measure of grade and continuity of mineralization.  The sonic drilling was completed 

under contract to Boart Longyear Ltd. 

Sonic drilling employs the use of high-frequency, resonate energy to advance a core barrel or casing 

into subsurface formations.  The sonic drill has the capability to recover unconsolidated material with 

a minimum of disturbance as well as coring consolidated material.  Contamination is minimized by 

the process of overriding the core barrel to limit the amount of foreign material that can enter the 

sample.  As there is no wire line system, the complete drill string must be pulled to retrieve the 

sample.  The sample usually stays in the core barrel and is extruded into a plastic tube pulled over 

the core barrel.  The sample fills the tube in the same manner as a sausage casing is filled.  Three

sizes of core barrels are used; nominally 5" (12.7 cm), 6" (15.24 cm) and 7" (17.78 cm).  Typically, 

the hole will begin with the larger diameter core, reducing with depth.  

When material is very loose and cannot be retained in the core barrel, a special bit with a 'flapper 

valve' is used.  There would usually be some loss of sample when loose material is encountered as 

the drill string would have to be removed to install the bit/valve, resulting in the material drilled 

remaining in (or falling to) the bottom of the hole. 

 Marlin Gold 2011 Sonic Sampling 9.1.1

Due to generally poor sample recovery with conventional diamond core and reverse circulation 

drilling, Marlin Gold employed 'sonic' drilling in the Taunus Pit during 2011, with the objective to 

provide a better measure of grade and continuity of mineralization.  The sonic drilling was completed 

under contract to Boart-Longyear. 

Sonic drilling employs the use of high-frequency, resonate energy to advance a core barrel or casing 

into subsurface formations.  The sonic drill has the capability to recover unconsolidated material with 

a minimum of disturbance as well as coring consolidated material.  Contamination is minimized by 

the process of overriding the core barrel to limit the amount of foreign material that can enter the 

sample.  As there is no wire line system, the complete drill string must be pulled to retrieve the 

sample.  The sample usually stays in the core barrel and is extruded into a plastic tube pulled over 

the core barrel.  The sample fills the tube in the same manner as a sausage casing is filled.  Three 

sizes of core barrels are used; nominally 5" (12.7 cm), 6" (15.24 cm) and 7" (17.78 cm).  Typically, 

the hole will begin with the larger diameter core, reducing with depth.  

When material is very loose and cannot be retained in the core barrel, a special bit with a 'flapper 

valve' is used.  There would usually be some loss of sample when loose material is encountered as 

the drill string would have to be removed to install the bit/valve, resulting in the material drilled 

remaining in (or falling to) the bottom of the hole. 

To provide an even split, the sample was frozen in the plastic bag and cut with a diamond saw just 

as diamond core samples.  Water is added to the sample prior to freezing to consolidate dried or 

damp sections then placed in a custom built 'walk in freezer'.  

Prior to shipping to the sample preparation facility, quality control samples including a field blank, 

certified reference material (standard) and a field duplicate are added into the sample stream at the 

rate of one of each per 20 samples submitted. 

9.2 Sample Preparation 

 Historical Sample Preparation 9.2.1

Historical sample procedures and analysis is described in Robertson and Thomson (1994), and 

Exploraciones Eldorado's feasibility report (Exploraciones Eldorado, 1995).  All samples collected 

during the Eldorado pre-feasibility were submitted to Bondar-Clegg's preparation facility in 

Hermosillo, Sonora.  Samples were crushed to 75% passing 10 mesh.  A 250 g split was sent to 

Bondar-Clegg in Vancouver for analysis.  A second 250 g split was retained from the reject and 

analyzed for gold by Bondar-Clegg as an internal replicate, for every fourth sample.

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

Each split was pulverized to 95% passing 150 mesh using a ring-and-puck pulverizer.  Samples 

were digested by nitric and hydrochloric acid.  Silver, copper, lead, zinc, and arsenic were analyzed 

by ICP.  Gold was analyzed by fire assay, with an atomic absorption finish, on a 30 g sample.  The 

detection limit was reported at 5 ppb Au.  For samples exceeding 5,000 ppb, samples were analyzed 

by fire assay with a gravimetric finish.  

About every seventh sample was also submitted for check assay to Chemex Labs Ltd., in 

Vancouver.  Gold was analyzed by fire assay, with an atomic absorption finish.  The detection limit is 

reported as 0.03 g/t gold.  A group of check samples analyzed by Chemex were also re-numbered, 

and submitted as blind duplicates, to Bondar-Clegg. 

Sample blanks and standards were not inserted by Exploraciones Eldorado into the sample stream.  

Sample chain of custody was not described in documents available to Marlin Gold.  These were fairly 

standard sample practices at the time the work was completed by Exploraciones Eldorado.  

Samples, and check samples, were analyzed by internationally recognized labs and are considered 

to be of reasonable quality.  Marlin Gold intends to twin a selection of the historic drillholes as part of 

the historic assay database validation process. 

 Marlin Gold 2007-2011 Sample Preparation 9.2.2

Samples were transported by company employees directly to the sample preparation facility of 

Inspectorate de Mexico, S.A de C.V., in Durango, Mexico, maintaining chain of custody until received 

by the lab.  

Samples were crushed in a jaw crusher to >70% passing 10 mesh (2 mm).  A 250 g split of the 10 

mesh material was pulverized to >85% passing 200 mesh (75 µm) using a ring-and-puck pulverizer.  

A split of this pulp was sent to Inspectorate's ISO 9001:2008 certified analytical lab in Sparks (Reno), 

Nevada, USA. 

Gold was analyzed by fire assay fusion of a one assay ton sample (29.17 g) followed by digestion of 

the resulting bead in aqua regia and analyzed for gold by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).  

Samples returning an initial assay of greater than 5 g/t gold are re-assayed by fire assay followed by 

gold separation by nitric acid and a gravimetric gold measurement.   

Inspectorate inserts standard reference materials, analytical blanks and pulp duplicates in each 

analytical batch.  The first sample in each workorder is coarse barren rock that is prepared to a pulp 

in the same manner as the routine samples.  It is only analyzed if the first drill sample of the

A comprehensive quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program has been established at 

Trinidad (Taunus) and includes routine insertion of standards, field duplicates as indicated 

previously, but also includes a preparation duplicate split after coarse crushing in each group of 20 

samples.  Pulp duplicates taken by Inspectorate were also incorporated with the field and 

preparation duplicates to monitor precision at each stage of sample mass and particle size reduction.  

Analytical results from the quality control samples were continuously and independently monitored to 

assure that the quality of analyses is maintained.  A 'failure table' was been maintained to document 

departures from the accepted limits and to track corrective action.  Assays exceeding the acceptable

limits are examined to determine if there has likely been a sample mix-up in the field or laboratory, or 

whether it is likely an analytical issue that will require corrective action.  Where necessary the 

analytical batch is re-assayed.  

9.4 Bulk Density 
Specific gravity ("SG") measurements were taken to determine appropriate bulk density values for 

both the mineralized and unmineralized rocks. 

Bulk density samples were collected by four methods: 

 waxed core; 
 waxed sonic; 
 vacuum; and 
 in-situ measurement.  

The core SG determinations were done on dried waxed core.  These types of core samples did not 

include the matrix of the breccia.  The core samples were wax sealed and weighed in water and to 

calculate a specific gravity value. 

The sonic samples represent dried and waxed clasts and matrix.  They exhibit generally lower SG 

values than the core SG values.  The lower SG values are most likely due to some swelling of the in-

situ volume after extraction.  Once again SG was derived by differential weight of the material in air 

and water. 

The vacuum sealed plastic bag samples were tested by first vacuum sealing core material before 

water immersion measurement of SG.  Remnant air in the sealed bag made this method unreliable. 

In-situ measurement of density was completed by excavating a known volume from the pit bottom or 

other location and weight the material derived from the sample. 

9.5 Conclusions 
Overall SRK has found that the sample preparation, analysis and security has been completed with 

due care and with effective procedures.

10 Data Verification (Item 12) 
Section 10.1 and 10.3.1 have been excerpted from the Jutras and Powell, 2008 Technical 

Report.  Changes to headings and standardizations have been made to suit the format of this 

report.  Changes to the text are enclosed in brackets or in sentences containing SRK. 

Data verification procedures of Exploraciones Eldorado specified Robertson and Thomson (1994) 

and Exploraciones Eldorado (1995). 

Five twin RC holes were completed in 1995, twinning previous RC holes TTC-20, TTC-22, TTC-26, 

TTC-72, and TTC-220. 

10.1 Verification by Marlin Gold 

 Historic Data  10.1.1

Marlin Gold received all property data in paper format.  Drill logs were provided without assay data, 

but with sample interval and sample identification number.  Assay data was provided as copies of the 

original assay certificates.  A collar location file, or list of collar coordinates, was not included with the 

data package.   

Marlin Gold manually entered into Excel the geologic data, geologic interval, and sample number.  

Assay certificates were scanned and processed with optical character recognition (OCR) software.  

Misidentification errors created by the OCR software amounted to less than 0.1% and were mainly 

restricted to specific assay report pages.  Corrections were then made to the digital database by 

manual entry.  As a final verification step, 2% of the digital geologic data and the sample intervals, 

each, were checked against the original data.  The final scanned assay data were found to be 

without error, after a random check of 5% of the data.  Following this, a check was made of 10% of 

the assay data, which recorded an error rate of 0.3%. 

Drill collar locations were determined from collar location maps.  Location maps of Eldorado 

displayed a "UTM" grid, but did not specify the UTM projection.  It was found that the projection was 

neither NAD 27, NAD 83, nor WGS84.  Maps were then scanned, and registered to existing 

topographic features present in the field, and on the maps.  In most areas, the planned and actual pit 

outline, and existing road and drainage traces, corresponded within 5 m, suggesting relatively small 

spatial error was imparted by the registration process.  Collar locations were then digitized from the 

maps, and a drill collar location file created from these data.  During a site visit in August 2007 a drill 

collar for hole TCC-090 was spotted in the field and GPS measurements indicated reasonable 

agreement given the GPS' accuracy. 

 Core versus RC drilling 10.1.2

Marlin Gold discovered a new gold zone below the historic pit by using reverse circulation (RC) 

drilling.  The discovery hole, hole 08TRRC023 intersected 100 m at 1.62 g/t gold.  Another hole was 

drilled on the same section and intersected the zone approximately 30 to 40 m away.  This hole, 

08TRRC040 returned a similar intersect of 74m at 1.45 g/t gold.  Marlin Gold then drilled a diamond 

hole between the two RC holes in order to confirm the gold grade in the RC holes.  Diamond hole 

08TR012 was lost 40 m prior to achieving the target depth and intersected 61m at 8.5 g/t gold.  

Results from the diamond drillhole were significantly higher than the RC holes.

Subsequently, Marlin Gold drilled an additional 4 diamond holes as twins or closely spaced holes in 

order to investigate the apparent bias between the two drilling methods.  Results of the core holes 

confirmed that RC drilling has a consistently low bias in gold grade as compared to diamond holes in 

the same zones.  As a result of this study, Marlin Gold has used RC drilling to explore for new zones 

and has used diamond drilling results to estimate resources where possible.  A comparison of the 

core versus RC assay results in the higher grade mineralized intervals is summarized in Table 

10.1.2.1.  From the analysis, it appeared that the RC drilling had a consistently low bias in gold 

assays as compared to diamond drilling.

10.2 Verification by SRK 

 Site Visit 10.2.1

SRK visited the Trinidad project in July, 2011.  Mike Johnson, P.Geo. (APEGBC# 34923) traveled to 

the site on July 4, 2011 and left the site on July 6, 2011.   

The site visit was completed while drilling was underway on the project.  During the site visit, SRK 

reviewed the data accumulated on the property, the local and regional geology in outcrop, the 

historic pit, and sonic drill material.  SRK also observed and reviewed the processes and procedures 

associated with sonic drilling, logging, sampling and material handling, and shipping. 

SRK found that the procedures and practices being implemented were reasonable for the geology of 

this deposit and the drilling method being utilized. 

 Database Verification 10.2.2

SRK downloaded assay certificates from Inspectorate Labs and compared them with the assays 

from the database.  Approximately 6,150 samples were compared and 200 assays from the lab 

certificates had different values than those in the database.  Most of the miss-matched assays turned 

out to be re-assays of the failed batches.  A small portion was identified as data entry errors.  Those 

were corrected in the database. 

A portion of historical Eldorado data available in PDF format was converted to ASCII format and 

compared with the database assays.  Approximately 1,550 assays were compared.  Some errors in 

96 assays were resolved.

After the review, SRK is of the opinion that the Trinidad Project database is sufficiently reliable for 

resource estimation. 

 Comparisons of different data types 10.2.3

The Trinidad Project has been drilled out by three types of drill holes: RC, Core, and Sonic.  

Throughout the history of the project there has been some concern that assays from RC holes may 

be biased on the low side.  In 2009, Marlin Gold drilled four diamond twins of RC holes.  Results 

from the core holes confirmed that the assays from RC drilling are generally biased on the low side.   

For the 2011 resource update, SRK made some additional comparisons of assays from different 

types of drill holes.  The comparisons confirmed that assays from RC drill holes are marginally 

biased closer to surface in the Top domain and strongly biased at depth in the Bottom domain.  

Figure 10-1 shows how assays from RC holes compare to nearby assays from core and sonic holes.  

In the Bottom domain, assays from the Sonic drilling or from the core drilling are generally much 

higher.  For this reason, for the estimation, assays from RC drilling in the Bottom domain were not 

used.  Note that a description of the Top and Bottom zones is provided in the Resource Section.

10.3 Verification of Analytical Quality Control Data 
Quality control results in previous drill programs were disclosed in earlier NI 43-101 Technical 

Reports (Jutras and Powell, 2008, Jutras et al, 2007) and will not be repeated here. 

Analytical results following the 2008 NI 43-101 Technical Report (Jutras and Powell, 2008) and prior 

to 2010 were continuously monitored by a QC program consisting of the insertion of standards, 

blanks and duplicates.  The 2010 drill program continued with the sampling protocol established with 

the previous program with a number of changes implemented as the program was evaluated.  These

changes included the increase in the number of quality control samples submitted, introduction of 

new standards, the insertion of more systematic preparation duplicates and regular update reports to 

management and field staff.  Reports include a 'failure table' documenting all samples exceeding 

established limits indicating any corrective action taken. 

In addition to the routine QC samples inserted into each sample shipment, a randomly selected set 

of pulps were submitted to a second laboratory as a check on relative accuracy.  

A detailed description of the results of the QC analyses in pre-2009 years and for 2009 to 2010 years 

have been reported by Jutras (2008) and in the SRK (2011) technical reports. 

The analytical quality control results from the 2010 and 2011 drill programs were monitored by G.N. 

Lustig Consulting Ltd (Lustig, 2011) and the results from these programs have been summarized 

below.  SRK has reviewed the quality control data and results compiled by G.N. Lustig.  SRK finds 

that the compilation and conclusions established by G.N. Lustig Consulting are accurate 

 2010 Monitoring of Analytical QA/QC 10.3.1

Accuracy 

To monitor accuracy, certified reference materials (standards) were inserted at regular intervals in 

the sampling stream.  All standards in use were purchased from CDN Resource Laboratories Ltd. of 

Langley BC, Canada.  All standards are certified through a round robin program consisting of 120 

analyses at 12 independent laboratories. 

A listing of the standards in use, recommended values and standard deviation can be found in Table 

10.3.1.1.  Also listed are the actual results received from the prime analytical laboratory. 

Table 10.3.1.1:  Standards Used on the Resource Analytical Dataset  

 
 
 
 
 
 
Note:  SD = standard deviation 

 

Upper and lower control limits (UCL & LCL) are established at recommended mean ±3s (standard 

deviation) and warning limits (UWL & LWL) at recommended mean ±2s.  Assuming a normal 

distribution of analyses of a single standard, one could expect 5% of analyses exceeding ±2s and 

only 0.3% of analyses exceeding ±3s.  Any single standard analyses beyond the upper (UCL) or 

lower (LCL) control limits is considered a 'failure'.  In addition two successive standard analyses 

exceeding (UWL) or lower (LWL) warning limits on the same side of the mean could also constitute a 

'failure'. 

Analytical batches are not automatically re-analyzed in the event of a standard failure; the complete 

batch is examined to determine the cause and significance of the failure.  Analyses with large 

differences from expected values are often mixed standard identifiers or have been switched with a 

routine drill samples.  Batches where all results are less than detection generally do not require re-

analyses, but batches where there are mineralized results are always re-analyzed if it is determined 

that the error is analytical rather than a sample mix-up.

Results of the analyses of the standards are routinely plotted on separate Shewhart charts for each 

standard; plotting concentration vs. the sample sequence, with warning and control limits plotted as 

horizontal lines.  Summary plots that include all standards on a single plot, with the assay value 

converted to a 'z-score' are also prepared to give an accuracy overview of the complete program.  A 

z-score is calculated by subtracting the accepted value of the standard from the analytical value and 

dividing it by the standard deviation derived from the analyses used to establish the accepted value 

(round robin assays).  This converts the analytical value to standard deviation units above and below 

the mean, so all standards can compared on the same plot.  

The overall z-score plot indicates a slight overall high bias with six analyses exceeding the control 

limits.  Four of the failures can be attributed to standard CDN-GS-1E (Figure 10-2).  

 

Figure 10-2:  Overall Z-Score Plot 

 

Precision 

Precision was monitored through a program of field and laboratory duplicates representing each time 

a sub-sample was taken.  These included quarter core duplicates from drill core, a duplicate split 

from RC cuttings and preparation duplicate splits after coarse crushing.  In addition to these 

samples, Inspectorate Lab routinely analyzed pulp duplicates.  With the exception of gross errors 

indicating sample mix-ups, samples or batches are not passed or failed based on the results of 

duplicate analyses, rather they indicate how representative the sampling and sub sampling 

procedures are.  The general expectation is that the precision will improve progressively from the 

field duplicate to preparation duplicate to pulp duplicate as the samples become more homogenous 

due to finer crushing, pulverizing and mixing.  It is also expected that precision will improve with 

concentration.   

Of all of these duplicates, the most important are the duplicates of the core and RC cuttings (the first 

split) as precision error estimated with these data is a cumulative error, which will include all 

subsequent sample preparation and analytical error as well as the natural variation of the parent 

material (Abzalov, 2008).

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

The split core represents the maximum geological variability and ideally the duplicate should consist 

of the other half of the primary sample.  As this leaves no material for that interval for a permanent 

record, this practice is often not acceptable and as a compromise, ¼ split core is used, ¼ core sent 

to lab as primary sample, and ¼ core sent as duplicate with a half core split retained in box.  

Contamination 

Contamination during sample preparation is monitored by the routine insertion of coarse field blank 

material that goes through the complete sample preparation process of crushing and pulverizing. It is 

industry practice to set an arbitrary limit at 5X the detection.  With some assays with very low 

detection limits this can be unrealistic as the normal background of the material can be greater than 

5X the detection limit.  There were a relatively large number of failures early in the program, but 

there was no indication of contamination in the actual drill samples indicating that the higher values 

likely originated with the blank material 

Corrective Action 

As indicated previously, all results exceeding the established limits were logged into a failure table 

with an indication of the nature of the failure and what remedial action if any was required.  Where 

standards have failed, batch reanalyses would be considered if the interval was mineralized or above 

background.  Where the failure appeared to be due to sample mix-ups or misidentification of the 

standard, multi-element data was used to compare the analyzed standard with a geochemical 

'fingerprint' of the specific standard to confirm the actual standard identification.  There were 9 

groups of samples re-assayed due to QC failures and 11 standards that had been misidentified in 

the field. 

External Check Assays 

As an external check on relative accuracy, a set of randomly selected pulp samples were submitted 

to the ALS sample preparation facility in Guadalajara with analyses in Vancouver.  The selection was 

made using a random number generator computer program from a subset of samples that had been 

geologically determined to be part of the Taunus mineralizing system.  The selection consisted of 5% 

of this subset and included samples from all holes from 2007 to 2010.     

Comparing the original Inspectorate analyses with the ALS checks indicates a low bias of the 

Inspectorate original assays at lower concentrations.  The mean of the Inspectorate originals are 

2.3% lower than the ALS duplicates.  The median of the originals is 14% lower.  What is significant, 

however, is that at the third quartile (75th percentile) the Inspectorate original assays are actually 

0.35% higher than the check samples. 

Overall the check samples are relatively similar to the original sample results. 

 2011 Monitoring of Analytical QA/QC 10.3.2

Accuracy 

Accuracy was monitored by the analyses of certified reference material.  Six different standards were 

employed during the 2011 drill program with recommended values ranging from 0.91 g/t to 14.9 g/t 

gold.  The standards employed are certified commercial standards provided by CDN Resource 

Laboratories Ltd. of Langley BC, Canada (Table 10.3.2.1) and have values established by at least 

120 analyses from 12 labs.

Program 

 

There was a slight overall low bias relative to the recommended values of the standards in use at the 

beginning of the program, with a change to a high bias in late June.  Part of this high bias was 

related to higher and erratic analyses of standard CDN-CM-6 as well as higher values returned for 

CDN-GS-1G. 

Gravimetric analyses for standards with initial analyses of >5 g/t indicates an overall low bias.  

Standards used by Inspectorate as part of their internal QA/QC program indicates a low bias up to 

late September, with later results near the recommended values for the standards. 

There were 23 standard analyses considered 'failures' during the drill program.  Four of these were 

identified as misidentified standards.  Ten standard failures required corrective batch re-analyses.

Precision 

Precision of the analytical results has been monitored plotting field duplicate, preparation duplicates 

and pulp duplicates (from Inspectorate's internal QC program) on a variety of plots including 

scatterplots, ARD% vs. rank and ARD% vs. pair mean.. 

Although there is considerable variability in the gold analyses at the various stages of sample grain 

size/volume reduction as interpreted from the various plots, an overall measure of precision error 

expressed by the average coefficient of variation (CVAVE[%]) indicates that the results are within the 

high range the acceptable precision.  The CVAVE(%) for duplicate analyses was 29% for field 

duplicates, 19% for preparation duplicates and 15% for pulp duplicates.   

Contamination 

To monitor contamination during the sample preparation stage, coarse blank material from a local 

quarry was inserted into the sample stream at a rate of 1 in each group of 20 samples submitted.  A 

general industry guideline is that blanks should not return results greater than 5 times the detection 

limit.  This guideline obviously has to take into account the actual detection limit and the gold 

background values of the blanks.  As the background was variable a threshold of 0.05 g/t was used 

rather than the 0.025 g/t gold based on the detection limit.  

There were three analyses exceeding the threshold and were documented in the failure table.  It was 

concluded that these analyses represented some minor contamination from a very high grade 

section, with no indication of contamination of following samples. 

External Check Assays 

As a check for relative bias and as an independent confirmation of grade, 139 sonic core pulps from 

the 2011 drill program were randomly selected and submitted to a second laboratory for gold 

analyses.  The samples, representing 5% of all core samples analyzed, were assayed at the ISO 

9001 accredited Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) facility in Zacatecas, using comparable 

methods as those used by Inspectorate for the primary analyses.  

A statistical summary of the original and duplicate results indicates that there is a relative high  bias 

of the primary Inspectorate  assays compared to the Actlabs check assays of 0.678% comparing 

means and 5.479% comparing medians.  Correlations are good at 0.994 (Pearson) and 0.989 

(Spearman).  Significant outliers were removed prior to statistical calculations. 

10.4 2010 to 2011 QA/QC Monitoring Conclusions 
Marlin Gold has instituted a quality control program at the Trinidad (Taunus) project to monitor the 

accuracy, precision, and contamination of the sampling and during the 2010 and 2011 drill 

campaigns.  Quality control samples consisted of one blank, one duplicate and one standard 

reference material in each group of 20 samples.  In addition approximately 5% of the sample pulps 

from core holes have been randomly selected for check assays at a second laboratory. 

The analytical results of the quality control samples have been continuously and independently 

monitored throughout the programs, with a table of QC failures maintained to document both the QC 

failures and corrective action taken where necessary.  All outstanding QC issues have been 

resolved.

The primary analytical laboratory, Inspectorate, is an ISO 9001:2008 accredited laboratory.  External 

check assays have been performed at Actlabs in Zacatecas, Mexico, which is also accredited to ISO 

9001 and at ALS in Vancouver, which is accredited to ISO/IEC 14025:2005. 

The quality control and check assays completed confirm that the 2010 and 2011 Trinidad (Taunus) 

assay data is accurate, precise and free of contamination to industry standards and is of sufficient 

quality to be used in resource estimation. 

10.5 SRK Conclusions on Data Verification 
The drilling, logging and sampling procedures described in previous sections are consistent with 

industry standards and are suitable for resource estimation.  The sample length is appropriate to 

accurately characterize the mineralization and distinguish any zones internal to the mineralization 

which may have anomalously high or low grades. 

After reviewing Oro's procedures, practices, QA/QC data as well as the monitoring compilation 

produced by G.N. Lusting Consulting, SRK found that the methods implemented were reasonable for 

the geology of this deposit and the applied drilling methods. 

SRK is of the opinion that the Trinidad Project database is sufficiently reliable for resource 

estimation.

11 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing (Item 
13) 
Material from Trinidad was mined by open pit and processed by heap leaching by EGC between 

1996 and 1998.  Approximately 50,000 oz of gold were reported to have been produced during this 

period.  Details of the process operations and production data are not available, although a feasibility 

study prepared by Exploraciones Eldorado containing a summary of the results of metallurgical 

Investigations conducted by Metcon Research, Inc. (Metcon) in 1994 is available.  More recently, 

Marlin Gold has undertaken a scoping-level metallurgical study at Metcon to more fully evaluate the 

amenability of sonic drill composites from the Taunus pit to gold and silver recovery by standard 

heap leaching.  The relevant results from these studies are presented in this section. 

11.1 Initial Metallurgical Investigations – Metcon 1994 
Exploraciones El Dorado completed a metallurgical test program at Metcon in 1994 and the results 

of this program are detailed in Metcon's report: "Trinidad Project – Preliminary Metallurgical Study", 

September 1994.  This program included an evaluation of a variety of recovery techniques including:  

gravity concentration, Amalgamation, flotation and cyanidation.  Table 11.1.1 provides a summary of 

average gold and silver recoveries obtained with each processing methodology.  As can be seen, 

cyanidation was identified as the preferred gold and silver recovery method with an average of 89% 

gold extraction and 39% silver extraction obtained from test composites ground to 40% and 80% 74 

microns.  The results of the bottle roll cyanidation tests reported by Metcon are summarized in Table 

11.1.2

11.2 Marlin Gold Metallurgical Investigations – Metcon 2012 
During 2011 Metcon undertook a metallurgical investigation on six separate test composites 

formulated from sonic drill intervals from Marlin Gold's Taunus Pit.  This work included a full head 

sample characterization of each of the test composites, bottle roll cyanidation studies, column 

agglomeration studies and larger diameter column leach tests.  The results of this program are 

documented in Metcon's report, "Trinidad Project – Agglomeration and Column Leach Study on 

Composite Samples", April 2012, are presented in this section. 

 Test Composite Characterization 11.2.1

Drill Hole Location 

Marlin Gold submitted six samples for metallurgical testing at Metcon that were obtained from sonic 

drill intercepts in both the Eldorado and HS zones.  The composites were formulated to represent 

high grade, medium grade and low grade material in each of these zones.  Figure 11-1 shows the 

location of each of the sonic drill holes and Table 11.2.1.1 shows the drill hole intervals and 

anticipated grade for each composite.

Head  and Screen Analyses 

Approximately 200 kg of material for each sample was received by Metcon.  Each sample was air-

dried and screened to obtain the as-received particle size distribution (PSD).  Based on the as-

received PSD, four 10 kg test charges and one 60 kg test charge were prepared for each composite 

for metallurgical testing and head analyses.  One 10 kilogram test charge was selected at random as 

a head sample for each composite and then stage-crushed and sub-sampled to obtain a 150 gram 

pulverized (-150 micron)  sample that was then submitted for gold fire assay/AA finish and silver 

assay by geochem, as well as, cyanide soluble gold and silver.  Head analyses for each composite 

are provided in Table 11.2.1.2.  Gold in the head samples ranged from 0.29 g/t – 4.17 g/t and silver 

ranged from 2.18 g/t – 9.44 g/t.  Cyanide soluble gold ranged from about 34% to 86%.

Mineralogical Analyses 

A one kilogram sample from each test composite was submitted to Montana Tech Cente

Advanced Minerals and Metallurgical Processing for mineralogical analysis and mineral libe

characterization.  The results of this work are detailed in their report, "MLA Characterizat

Composite Samples from the Oro Gold Project", January 2012.  Table 11.2.1.4 provides a sum

of mineral constituents found in each of the composites.  Overall, quartz and other silicates cons

85 to 95% of the main rock matrix.  Kaolinite represented 9.9% of composite 11TRSN-27 and 

of composite 11TRSM-21, and was found in lesser amounts in the other four composites. 

Electrum was the only gold carrier identified in the study.  Gold content of the electrum ranged

60 to 80 %, occurring primarily as small grains between 5 and 10 microns in size.

 Bottle Roll Testwork 11.2.2

Bottle roll cyanidation testing was conducted on all composites, except for 11TRSN-24, at a 

size of 100% - 3/8 inch.  The following test conditions were used:  

 Test Charge: 5 kg; 
 Cyanide:  2 g/L NaCN; 
 pH:  10.5 – 11.0; 
 Slurry Density: 45% solids; and 
 Leach Time: 96 hours. 

The results of the bottle roll testwork are summarized in Table 11.2.2.1.  Gold extractions ra

from 64.7 - 79.9% and silver extraction ranged from 26.1 - 58.1%.  Cyanide consumption ra

from 1.1 – 2.3 kg/t and lime consumption ranged from 0.03 – 0.5 kg/t.

 Preliminary Agglomeration Testwork 11.2.3

Preliminary agglomeration tests were conducted on 10 kg test charges to evaluate the Portland 

cement dosages of 2, 4 and 6 kg/t during agglomeration.  Each test charge was agglomerated with 

the specified quantity of cement and loaded into 4 inch diameter x 10 ft high columns and leached for 

30 days.  The following parameters were common for all column leach tests: 

 Size:  As-Received particle size; 
 Cement: 2, 4 and 6 kg/t; 
 Moisture: 6-8%; 
 Cyanide Conc: 1 g/L NaCN; 
 Flowrate: 7.3 Lph/m2; and 
 pH  10.5-11.0. 

The results of the preliminary agglomeration tests are summarized in Table 11.2.3.1.  It was found 

that both gold and silver extraction declined as cement dosages were increased to 4 and 6 kg/t.  It is 

speculated that at these higher dosage rates the cement seals off the particles, preventing contact 

with the leach solution.  At a cement dosage of 2 kg/t gold extraction ranged from 42.2 – 75.9% and 

silver extraction ranged from 12.9 – 43.3%.  A cement dosage of 2 kg/t was selected for subsequent 

larger diameter closed-cycle column testing.  Although a cement dosage of 2 kg/t resulted in the best 

extractions no agglomerate strength testing was conducted.

 Closed-Cycle Column Leach Testwork 11.2.4

Five closed-cycle column leach tests were conducted on the composite samples at the "as-received" 

particle size in columns that were 6 inches in diameter by 10 ft high.  All test composites were 

agglomerated with 2 kg/t cement and the initial lime (CaO) addition was based on the consumption 

obtained from the earlier bottle roll tests.  The leach parameters common to all column tests are 

summarized as follows: 

 CaO added to the column necessary to maintain pH at 10.5-11.0 was calculated based on 
the alkalinity contributed by the Portand cement; 

 The  initial leach solution flowrate was maintained at about 10 Lph/m2, but was reduced to 
about 5-7 Lph/m2 later in the leach cycle; 

 The columns were operated in closed-cycle by contacting the pregnant leach solution with 
activated carbon to remove the extracted gold and silver.  The resulting barren solution was 

then cycled back to the column after addition of cyanide and CaO to maintain the leach 

solution at 1 g/L NaCN and pH 10.5-11.0; 

 The loaded activated carbon from each column test was dried, weighed and assayed for 
gold and silver; 

 Each column was leached for 90 days; 
 At the end of the leach cycle each column was washed for four days and allowed to drain for 

3 days.  The column residue was then unloaded and weighed; 

 Approximately 30 kg of leached residue was split from each sample and submitted to Golder 
Geotechnical for consolidation and compacted percolation testing; and 

 The remaining residue was oven dried and then assayed for gold by fire/AA finish and silver 
by Geochem method.

additional 2-3% gold extraction was obtained after 90 days of leaching.   

Silver extraction after 60 days of leaching ranged from 19.3 – 38.9% with an average of 27.2%.  Only 

about 1% additional silver extraction was obtained after 90 days of leaching.

11.3 Recovery Estimate Assumptions 
As summarized in Table 11.3.1, an average gold recovery of about 70% and an average silver 

recover of about 23% is estimated based on the closed-cycle column testwork presented in this 

section.  These recovery estimates include a 5% reduction in recovery to account for leach 

inefficiencies normally encountered in a commercial heap leach operation.

12 Mineral Resource Estimate (Item 14) 

12.1 Introduction 
In February 2011, SRK Consulting (US) Inc. prepared a National Instrument (NI) 43-101 compliant 

technical report on resources on the Trinidad Project, based on December 23, 2010 resource 

estimates (Table 12.1.1).

* Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty that all 
or any part of the Mineral Resource estimate will be converted into Mineral Reserves estimate; Resources stated as contained 
within a potentially economically minable open pit stated above a 0.3g/t Au cut-off; Pit optimization is based on an assumed 
gold price of $1,200/oz, metallurgical recovery of 95% and a processing and G&A cost of $22.00/t; Mineral resource tonnage 
and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the accuracy of the estimate, and numbers may not add due to rounding; 
and Mineral resource tonnage and grade are reported as diluted to reflect a potentially minable bench height of 6m. 

 

Since then, additional drilling by Marlin Gold lead to further updates of the Taunus geology model.  

Consequently, SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. ("SRK") was engaged by Marlin Gold in June 2011 to 

update the mineral resources for the Trinidad Project.  

The mineral resource model presented herein incorporates all drilling completed by Marlin Gold to 

date.  The resource estimate was completed by Marek Nowak, P.Eng. (APEGBC#16985), an 

appropriate "independent qualified person" as this term is defined in National Instrument 43-101.  

The effective date of the resource statement is November 29, 2011. 

This section describes the resource estimation methodology and summarizes the key assumptions 

considered by SRK.  In the opinion of SRK, the resource evaluation reported herein is a reasonable 

representation of the gold mineral resources found in the Trinidad Project at the current level of 

sampling.  The mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with generally accepted CIM 

"Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best Practices" guidelines and are reported 

in accordance with the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101.  Mineral 

resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no 

certainty that all or any part of the mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 

The database used to estimate the Trinidad Project mineral resources was audited by SRK.  SRK is 

of the opinion that the current drilling information is sufficiently reliable to interpret with confidence 

the boundaries for hydrothermal breccia mineralization and that the assay data are sufficiently 

reliable to support mineral resource estimation. 

SURPAC Version 6.2 was used to evaluate and validate the geological solids, and GEMS Version 

6.3 was used to prepare assay data for geostatistical analysis, construct the block model, estimate 

metal grades and tabulate mineral resources.  Non-commercial software was used for geostatistical 

analysis and Sage2001 was used for variography. 

This section describes the work undertaken by SRK and key assumptions and parameters used to 

prepare the mineral resource model.  Roughly 80% of the overall resource is located in the Taunus

deposit.  Other resources from the Colinas deposits, referred to in the report as satellite deposits, 

and almost all in the inferred category, are scattered throughout five much smaller gold mineralized 

areas.  There has been no new drilling done outside the Taunus deposit since the last NI 43-101 

report.  Therefore, the discussion, and more specifically data statistics, will be presented mainly for 

the Taunus deposit. 

12.2 Resource Estimation Procedures 
The resource evaluation methodology involved the following procedures: 

 Database compilation and verification; 
 Validation of Marlin Gold designed wireframe models for the boundaries of the 

mineralization; 

 Definition of resource domains; 
 Data conditioning (compositing and capping) for geostatistical analysis and Variography; 
 Block modeling and grade interpolation; 
 Resource classification and validation; 
 Assessment of "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" and selection of appropriate 

cut-off grades; and 

 Preparation of the Mineral Resource Statement. 

12.3 Resource Database 

 Drill Holes 12.3.1

The database used to estimate the Taunus and Colinas Zones was audited by SRK.  The gold 

mineralized boundaries of the Zones were modeled by Marlin Gold personnel and validated by SRK.  

SRK is of the opinion that the current exploration information is sufficiently reliable to adequately 

interpret the boundaries of the gold mineralization and that the assay data are sufficiently reliable to 

support the estimation of mineral resources.   

The Trinidad database was provided to SRK in an Access format.  Within the resource area, the 

database contains almost 22,000 samples from 384 drill holes.  Table 12.3.1.1 provides a summary 

of the database used for the Trinidad resource estimation.  

Table 12.3.1.1:  Exploration Data within the Trinidad Resource Area 

Source Type Number DH Length (m) Number of Samples

RC 80 11,637 5,822 
Sonic 38 4,300 3,510 

Eldorado DDH 4 312 195 
RC 206 11,080 5,540 

 

The Trinidad database comprises data from drilling programs conducted by Marlin Gold as well as 

Exploraciones Eldorado during the period 1994 to 2010.  The 2011 database received by SRK is 

much smaller than the database with more than 600 drill holes reported by SRK in the previous 

report (SRK, 2011).  The current database includes only historical drill holes (Eldorado) to which 

there is access to drill logs or assay certificates (Jutras, 2008).  In addition, the historical drill holes 

had to have located and surveyed the collars to be included for the resource estimates.  Current

drillhole database includes additional 92 holes not used in the December 2010 resource model, as 

they were completed after this analysis. 

SRK was provided with a digital database including collar, survey, assay and geologic information for 

all drillhole data within the resource area.  A total of 384 drill holes accounting for more 39,000 m of 

drilling were used for resource modeling.  Within the Taunus deposit area, boreholes have been 

drilled at 10 m to 20 m spacing.  In the satellite deposits drill hole spacing is larger, approximately 

betweeen15 and 40 m.  The majority of the holes were directed to the northeast-southwest and east-

west, although many of the earlier drilled holes were vertical.  Drilling was conducted using RC, HQ 

and NQ diamond drill core diameters and larger diameter sonic drillholes.  Down-hole surveying for 

the Marlin Gold drilling programs was conducted using a Flexit HTMS® magnetic survey instrument, 

with readings conducted on an average of 50 m intervals down hole.  Down-hole survey 

methodology utilized for the Exploraciones Eldorado drilling programs is not documented. 

In addition to gold, the provided database contains assays for silver, copper, arsenic molybdenum 

and zinc.  No analysis was conducted on these secondary metals, and they were not utilized during 

the resource estimation process.  

 Bulk Density 12.3.2

The available SG data was evaluated to determine appropriate bulk density values to be used to 

convert volumes into tonnages.  Currently, there are a large number of bulk density data collected by 

four methods: (1) waxed core, (2) waxed sonic, (3) vacuum, and (4) in-situ.   

The core SG determinations were done on dried waxed core.  These types of core samples do not 

include the matrix of the breccia.  The sonic samples represent dried and waxed clasts and matrix.  

They exhibit generally lower SG values than the core SG values.  The lower SG values are most 

likely due to some swelling of the in-situ volume after extraction.  The vacuum sealed plastic bag 

samples generally returned much lower SG values than all other groups of data.  Most likely, the 

most reliable group represents 20 in-situ samples collected in the most representative exposures of 

the main units in the Taunus area. 

Figure 12-1 shows statistics of the SG values for each group of data.  Overall, the average SG 

values from core samples are very close to the average SG values from in-situ samples.  Note that 

one very high in-situ value and two lowest in-situ values collected from the Chandler fault were 

excluded from the analysis. 

Considering large uncertainty on local SG values, one global SG of 2.37 was assigned to the gold 

mineralized domains and 2.42 to the waste areas.

 Coordinate System 12.3.3

All drilling data as well as the digital topographic surface and grade wireframes have been provided 

to SRK in a UTM coordinate system (WSG84 Zone 13), and resource modeling and grade estimation 

work has been conducted in this coordinate space.   

 Overburden and Topography Surface 12.3.4

A wireframe digital terrain model (DTM) surface of topography was provided to SRK by Marlin Gold.  

The source of these data is a 3-D Contour file which is a composite of data inherited from El Dorado, 

and Marlin Gold who updated the plan in 2008 to reflect modified topography in the Tajo Taunus, 

Waste Dump, Heap Leach pad, Bocas open cut areas.  The 2008 update utilized differential GPS 

(Magallen Promark3 RTK) which was tied into a Government beacon, "LPAZ " downloaded from 

ngs.noaa.gov (WGS84 Coordinates E-40975.504, N+2679883.934, Elev. +27.275). 

A visual comparison between the drillhole collars and the provided resurveyed topography shows 

generally good agreement in most areas, however the resurvey area is limited to the immediate area 

of known mineralization.  SRK recommends that Marlin Gold complete an updated and expanded 

survey program to better tie in the topography with surveyed drill collars, as well as to allow for a 

reasonable area peripheral to the deposit for infrastructure planning as the project advances.  

However, SRK considers that the resurveyed topography over the deposit area as provided by 

Marlin Gold is reasonably accurate and appropriate for use in resource estimation. 

Historical open pit mining has occurred in the central portion of the Main Eldorado deposit.  Based on 

historical records, and recent drilling results, there is evidence of a waste dump north of the existing 

pit.  SRK has elected to zero out tonnage and grade in the block model in the vicinity of this waste

dump, between a northing of 2,537,370.0 and 2,573,610.0 and above an elevation of 104 m amsl in 

the Eldorado zones.  No modeled overburden surface exists, and site inspection revealed that 

overburden is limited to a maximum thickness of a few meters, and mineralization outcrop at surface. 

12.4 Solid Body Modeling 
Solid models were created by Marlin Gold using Vulcan three dimensional ("3D") wireframes.  The 

wireframes were used to bound the gold mineralization and the geological and structural units.  SRK 

reviewed all wireframes. 

The gold mineralization associated with this deposit is interpreted to be controlled by a combination 

of specific breccia units and fault structures. Gold mineralization has been defined in five areas: 

Bocas, Eldorado-HS (Taunus pit area), Redzone, Tanque and Colinas.  The gold mineralization is 

elongated to the north and south, dominantly along the western side of the Chandler fault. The bulk 

of the gold mineralization lies under the Taunus pit area (Eldorado-HS) with Bocas to the north and 

Redzone, Tanque and Colinas to the south.  Throughout the area, the gold mineralization is 

terminated to the east by the Chandler fault. 

To create a 3D model in the Eldorado-HS zone, geological units, gold and zinc grades were 

interpreted on 60 east-west cross sections at 30 m spacing.  Zinc was used to guide the overall trend 

of the gold mineralization, while gold values and brecciated quartz porphyry ("BQP") geology were 

directly used to form the final models.  Sections were interpreted between 2,537,510 mN and 

2,536,850 mN.  The sectional interpretation for the BQP geological unit and gold grades were then 

imported into Vulcan where 3D polygons were created for these units by snapping to the holes.  

Interpretation of the gold mineralization was based on a combination of geology, gold grade, zinc 

grade and field observations.  A 0.2 g/t cut-off for gold grade was used as a guide for the polygons, 

which were modeled roughly parallel to the interpreted geology.  

While all of the geological units were modeled on sections, only the BQP unit was model in 3D since 

it is interpreted to be the main host of gold mineralization and shows good continuity from section to 

section.  The other geological units were used to guide modeling of gold grades, but were not 

explicitly modeled in 3D. 

The north-south trending chandler fault is interpreted as a hard boundary to gold mineralization 

within the Taunus pit area.  The fault was incorporated as the eastern limit of the solid models.  The 

Chandler fault can be observed at surface in the pit area as being near vertical to steeply east 

dipping.  The fault can be traced in drill holes to the south to approximately 2,537,120 mN.  Further 

to the south, the fault is not clearly defined and some gold grades are observed east of the projection 

of the fault. 

The final 3D solid model for Eldorado-HS results in a model in which the E-W section view forms two 

half-champagne glass shapes, stacked one above the other.  This results in an upper and lower 

volume.  The main "stem" of the shapes is located along the Chandler fault, while the gold 

mineralization extends to the west of the fault along the BQP or other fault structures.  This is shown 

in Figure 12-2.  In order to limit the effect of the sample during estimation, the two volumes were split 

by a hard boundary, into "top" and "bottom" zones.  Therefore, in the end, the Eldorado-HS Zones 

were split into Top and Bottom domains.  The top model was extended above the current pit surface 

for estimation purposes, but the resource was clipped below this surface.

Models for the Bocas, Redzone, Tanque and Colinas were created similarly.  Generally, sections 

were created on 30 m intervals and interpreted into 3D models in Vulcan software.  These zones are 

volumetrically much less significant that the Eldorado-HS Zone.

12.5 Compositing 
Most of the samples inside the gold mineralized domains were collected at 2.0 m and shorter 

intervals (Figure 12-3).  Note that the sonic sample lengths are the most variable from the three 

types of drill holes.  Accordingly, all capped assays were composited to 2 m intervals.

12.6 Evaluation of Outliers 
Block grade estimates may be unduly affected by very high grade assays.  Therefore, the assay data 

were evaluated for the high grades outliers.  The capping values were chosen by establishing a 

correlation between indicators of assays in the same drill holes at different thresholds and by 

reviewing probability plots.  The inflection points on probability plots at high ends of grade 

distributions were interpreted as thresholds to high grade populations and candidates for choice of 

capping.  Capping was completed on original assays in the Top and Bottom domains and is 

presented in Table 12.6.1.  No capping was carried out in the satellite deposits.

Experimental correlograms and the models were generated for the Top and Bottom domains in the 

Taunus deposit (Figure 12-5).  In all other gold mineralized zones, due to paucity of data, variogram 

models were not designed.  The nugget effects (i.e., gold variability at very close distance) were

both domains was modeled at 10% of the total sill.  Note that the sill represents the grade variability 

at a distance beyond which there is no correlation in grade.  The parameters of the correlogram 

models are presented in Table 12.7.1.

The gold grades in the Top and Bottom domains of the Taunus deposit were estimated in two 

successive steps.  The first step considered a relatively small search ellipsoid while, for the second 

step, the search ellipsoid dimension was increased, as presented in Table 12.8.2.  In all satellite 

deposits one estimation stage was applied.

In all cases, search ellipsoid rotations are Identical to variogram rotations in the Top and Bottom 

Domains.  In all satellite deposits, no rotations were applied. 

In the Taunus deposit, block metal grades were estimated using ordinary kriging.  On the other hand, 

inverse distance squared was applied in all satellite deposits.  Note that waste areas outside of the 

modeled gold mineralized domains were not estimated.  

12.9 Model Validation  
The Taunus resource block model was validated by completing a series of visual inspections and by: 

 Comparison of declustered average capped composite grades with average block estimates; 
 Comparison of local "well-informed" block grades with composites contained within those 

blocks; and 

 Comparison of average assay grades with average block estimates along different directions 
– swath plots. 

Table 12.9.1 shows how the declustered average composite assay grades compare with the block 

estimated grades in the mineralized zones.  Overall, the block estimated grades are quite close to 

the average composite grades.  One of the largest differences is in the RedZ domain.  Considering 

that there are only 86 composite assays in this domain, the differences are acceptable. Note that the 

average block grades represent straight average and were not weighted by the mineralized volumes.

Figure 12-6 shows a comparison of estimated gold block grades with borehole assay composite data 

contained within those blocks within the Top and Bottom gold mineralized domains in the Taunus 

deposit.  On average, the estimated blocks are similar to the composite data, although there is a 

substantial scatter of points around the x = y line.  This scatter is typical of smoothed block estimates

compared to the more variable assay data used to estimate those blocks.  This is indicated by a thick 

white line.  The thick white line that runs through the middle of the cloud is the result of a piece-wise 

linear regression smoother.

As a final check, average composite grades and average block estimates were compared along 

different directions.  This involved calculating de-clustered average composite grades and 

comparison with average block estimates along east-west, north-south, and horizontal swaths.  

Figure 12-7 and Figure 12-8 show the swath plots in the Top and Bottom domains.  The average 

composite grades and the average estimated block grades are very similar in all directions.  Overall, 

the validation shows that current resource estimates are a very good reflection of drill hole assay 

data.

12.10  Mineral Resource Classification 
Block model quantities and grade estimates for the Trinidad Project were classified according to the 

CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) by Marek 

Nowak, P.Eng. (APEGBC#16985), an appropriate independent qualified person for the purpose of NI 

43-101. 

Mineral resource classification is typically a subjective concept, industry best practices suggest that 

resource classification should consider both the confidence in the geological continuity of the 

mineralized structures, the quality and quantity of exploration data supporting the estimates and the 

geostatistical confidence in the tonnage and grade estimates.  Appropriate classification criteria 

should aim at integrating both concepts to delineate regular areas at similar resource classification. 

SRK is satisfied that the geological modeling honors the current geological information and 

knowledge.  The location of the samples and the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support 

resource evaluation.  The sampling information was acquired primarily by core, RC, and sonic 

drilling.  

Sample data in the Taunus deposit are sufficient for geostatistical analysis and evaluating spatial 

grade continuity by variography.  For the satellite deposits, there are an insufficient number of 

assays to model reliable variograms.  SRK is therefore of the opinion that the amount of sample data 

is generally sufficient to demonstrate reasonable geostatistical confidence for the Taunus deposit, 

but that for the satellite deposits there is a low confidence in both geological and grade continuity. 

The estimated blocks were classified according to: 

 Confidence in interpretation of the gold mineralized zones; 
 Continuity of Au grades defined from the variogram models in the Taunus deposit; 
 Number of data used to estimate a block; and 
 Average distance to the composites used to estimate a block. 

In order to classify gold mineralization as an Indicated Mineral Resource, "the nature, quality, 

quantity and distribution of data" must be "such as to allow confident interpretation of the geological 

framework and to reasonably assume the continuity of gold mineralization."  (CIM Definition

Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, December 2005).  To satisfy this 

requirement, all blocks estimated during the first step of the estimation process in the Top and 

Bottom domains were flagged for Indicated category.  Search radii in the first step can be roughly 

approximated to modeled grade continuity at 85% of the variogram sill.  Those blocks were 

estimated from three or more drill holes within an average distance from samples to estimated blocks 

of approximately 15 m in the Top and 20 m in the Bottom domains.  

The boundaries of the Indicated category were adjusted by a smoothing procedure.  This procedure 

excluded small clusters of blocks assigned to the Indicated category and included some areas 

originally assigned to the inferred category.  This necessary smoothing of the boundaries resulted in 

a number of blocks re-classified from the Inferred to the Indicated resource.  All estimated block 

grades not assigned to the indicated category were assigned to the inferred category. 

Considering the higher uncertainty of volume of smaller gold mineralized domains in the satellite 

deposits, SRK considers that resource blocks in those domains would be appropriately classified as 

an Inferred Mineral Resource. 

12.11 Mineral Resource Statement 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (December 2005) defines a 

mineral resource as: 

"A concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid 

fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in 

or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has 

reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological 

characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 

specific geological evidence and knowledge".  

The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally implies that the quantity 

and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the Mineral Resources are reported 

at an appropriate cut-off grade taking into account extraction scenarios and processing recoveries.  

SRK considers that the gold mineralization evaluated on the Trinidad Project is amenable for open 

pit extraction. 

In order to determine the quantities of material offering reasonable prospects for economic extraction 

from an open pit, SRK used a Whittle pit optimizer to evaluate the profitability of each resource block 

based on certain optimization parameters selected from comparable projects.  The optimization 

parameters include: mining costs of US$1.50 per mined tonne, material processing and G&A costs 

of US$5.00 per processed tonne, overall pit slope angles of 45°, metallurgical recovery of 70%, and 

a gold price of US$1,365 per ounce was used.  The reader is cautioned that the results from the 

conceptual pit optimization work are used solely for the purpose of reporting Mineral Resources that 

have "reasonable prospects" for economic extraction by an open pit and do not represent an attempt 

to estimate mineral reserves. 

SRK considers that the blocks located within the conceptual pit envelope show "reasonable 

prospects for economic extraction" and can be reported as a mineral resource.  Mineral Resources 

are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.  There is no certainty

12.12 Sensitivity Analysis 
The mineral resources of the Trinidad Project are sensitive to the selection of the reporting cut-off 

grade.  To illustrate this sensitivity, the block model quantities and grade estimates within the 

conceptual pit used to constrain the mineral resources are presented in Table 12.12.1 and Table 

12.12.2 at different cut-off grades.  As can be observed from these cut-off tables, the resource is 

relatively insensitive to cut-off grade in the 0.2 to 0.5 g/t Au cut-off range on a contained metal basis, 

which is likely the cut-off grade range of economic interest. 

The reader is cautioned that the figures presented in this table should not be misconstrued with a 

Mineral Resource Statement.  The figures are only presented to show the sensitivity of the block 

model estimates to the selection of cut-off grade.  Figure 12-9 and 12-10 present this sensitivity as 

grade tonnage curves.

14 Mining Methods (Item 16) 
The Taunus deposit was historically mined by Eldorado gold and is situated in relatively flat terrain, 

ringed by ephemeral arroyo's in a semi-arid environment that are influenced by periods of heavy rain 

in the wet season.  To the north and south, the Taunus pit is supported by two satellite areas of 

mineralization that are currently classified as inferred.  For the PEA, the size of the pits have not 

been constrained by site infrastructure, arroyo's or other factors that may reduce the size of the 

potential pit and a 45º slope formed the bases for potential economic extraction.  The final pit was 

determined to be approximately 225 m deep, 900 m from north to south, 550 m from east to west 

with a total volume of 27 Mm3.  Above a cut-off grade of 0.17 g/t Au, the total feed is estimated at 7.8 

Mt at a grade of 1.12 g/t Au with a strip ratio of 7.2:1 (waste:feed) and 281 koz of gold contained in-

situ before recovery.  The production schedule calls for a 5 year mine life with annual gold delivery to 

the heap of 30 koz Au, 40 koz Au, 60 koz Au, 60 koz Au and finally 90 koz Au with an average LoM 

total production rate of 37 kt/d. 

The mine fleet will likely consist of 100 t capacity (Caterpillar 777 or equivalent) rigid body haul trucks 

supported by either front end loaders or hydraulic excavators.  Blasting will be included in the default 

mine assumptions but some areas may be amenable to free-dig operations. 

It is likely that mine contractors will be employed at Taunus and initial contractor interviews have 

been taking place through early 2012. 

Waste will be disposed approximately 1.5 km away from the pit. 

The resource numbers referenced in the mining and economic modeling section are based on an 

internal cut-off of 0.17 g/t.  This is different from the 0.3 g/t reported in section 13.  As such, mining 

figures represent diluted grades to a selective mining unit of 5 m x 5 m x 5 m that result in more 

tonnes at a lower grade and slightly less contained ounces than reported in the resource. 

14.1 Geotechnical Design Parameters  

 Geotechnical Characteristics of Geologic Units  14.1.1

The area receives 120 cm/yr of annual precipitation.  A single 100 year event can produce 39 cm of 

precipitation and the average July precipitation is 31 cm.  The precipitation is the primary source of 

water inflow to the pit.  See Section 3.0 for more detail discussion. 

Regional Geology – The regional geology is a mid-tertiary age volcanics.  The Upper Volcanic Group 

(Oligocene – Miocene age) outcrops on east and west sides of the basin and consists of thick 

sequences of rhyolitic ignimbrites.  There are some basaltic flows.  The Lower Volcanic Group 

(Pleocene – Eocene age) is comprised of principal units of tertiary dacite – rhyolite volcanic 

sequence of flows and tuffs, overlain by upper tertiary rhyolite ash-flow tuffs, breccias and 

conglomerates.  The intrusive units include gabbro and diorite units grading to granodiorite and 

quartz-feldspar porphyry units.  Section 5 has detailed discussion on the regional geology.  From a 

geotechnical perspective, the regional geology is known to contain material contacts, weather rock 

masses and regional faulting that impact stability conditions in the pit. 

Taunus Geology – The local geology near the Taunus deposit consists of a quartz feldspar porphyry, 

andesite and mixed volcanic.  The deposit is bounded by northwest trending parallel faults: the

Chandler Fault on the east and the Taunus Fault on the west.  Mineralized zone is a silicified breccia 

that has been altered and replaced by chlorite, hematite and silica.  A silicified breccia zone steeply 

dips to the east in south portion of the deposit and is near horizontal in north pit area.  Weak argillic 

alteration along fault zones exist, but are limited to the quartz porphyry, parts of tuffs and structural 

trends.  There is evidence for post-mineralization faulting along east-dipping fault at base of silicified 

zone.  Several drill holes encountered a zone of voids, clay and caving at the silica-andesite contact.  

There are low-angle east-dipping structures exposed at low water in the Arroyo Azul on northeast 

margin of the Taunus orebody.  The primary mineralization is gold and silver, but the deposit 

includes copper, lead, zinc and arsenic.  

The heap material contains sufficient clay fines that the historic heap leach pile had a low 

permeability.  Test results from Metcon suggest that an agglomeration process may help to bind the 

fines to allow for increased permeability.  Agglomeration involves the addition of 2.0 kg/t of cement 

and 1.5 kg/t of lime to the crushed leach material prior to leaching.  The clay content in the breccia 

matrix will contribute to a reduction in matrix strength for the in situ rock, especially after exposure to 

weathering.  Figure 14-1 shows an east-west cross section of the important geologic units in the 

Taunus pit.

Previous Pit Mining – Eldorado Mining owned the property and mined the Taunus pit from 1994 to 

1999.  They mined 1.4 Mt of ore during that 5-year period at an average grade of 1.85 g/t.  The mine 

produced up to 55,000 oz of gold over a 24 mo period at one point, but was producing at an average 

rate of 30,000 oz. per year after the ramp up period.  

The current pit is about 345 m along north-south strike of the deposit and 169 m wide at the surface.  

The local ground elevation is 136 m masl and the bottom of the pit is at about 86 m masl, for a total

Current Ground Conditions – During the site visit observations of ground conditions from the top 60 

m of the east pit wall were made (i.e., the portion above the waterline).  The west highwall was 

observed from a distance viewed from the east ramp.  

The east wall of the pit is defined by Chandler Fault, which is a high angle, pervasive fault that lies 

along the entire east side of the pit.  East of the fault is the clastic breccia (QFP) which is quite 

competent along the north end of the east wall.  In the south endwall the rock on either side of the 

Chandler fault has sloughed away and there are localized tension cracks unsloughed rocks.  

Bench stability in the west wall is controlled by both bench-scale jointing and pit-scale faulting. The 

west wall is delimited by the boundary of the Taunus Fault.  The condition of the west wall is not as 

favorable as the east wall, suggesting a lower overall rock quality. 

The exposed pit walls that the walls can be divided into the following five rock quality zones. 

 Top Zone – The top 15 m is a weathered transition zone which is consistent around the pit.  
This rock visually appears weakest of the exposed rocks in the pit. 

 East Wall Zone – The northern end of the east wall is most competent rock with very stable 
bench face and minimal sloughing onto the benches.  The rock is a quartz feldspar porphyry 

(QFP) and visually appears strongest/ most competent of the exposed rocks in the pit.  At 

the southern end of the wall there are several oblique faults that intersect which has resulted 

in bench-scale failures and raveling.  This rock visually appears of medium competency 

dominated by rock fabric structure, but competency may improve with depth. 

 South Wall Zone – The south wall contains steeply dipping north-south faults in which the 
adjacent rock has raveled.  No benches are currently visible, but it is not known if they had 

been constructed at the time of mining.  The rock is quartz feldspar porphyry (QFP) on the 

east side and a brecciated rhyolite (BQP) in the center and a brecciated andesite (BAN) on 

the west.  Visually the rock appears to have an above average competency with little 

influence by exposed medium to flat dipping joints.  This region is roughly delimited by the 

Chandler Fault on the east and Taunus Fault on the west.  The southern end of the west wall 

has had a temporary ramp reestablished and it was not possible to view much of the 

exposed bench faces below the top 15 m.

 West Wall Zone – The northern end of the west wall has extensive bench failures controlled 
by bench-scale jointing that forms moderately-high angled wedges that fail by raveling over 

the long-term.  This rock a brecciated andesite (BAN) in the south portion and a brecciated 

clastic (BVC) on the north end.  The rock visually appears to have lower than average 

competency. 

 North Wall Zone – The north endwall has benches still in good condition and exposed flat-
lying joints do not appear to control stability.  The flat fault exposed in the endwall steepens 

as it outcrops at the surface near the Chandler Fault.  This steepening can also be seen in 

the local sub-parallel flat joint set.  The rock visually appears to be the second most 

competent rock around the pit walls. 

 Geotechnical Conditions 14.1.2

Rock Characterization – Only limited RQD data exists from the core drilling.  Values for long lengths 

of core had RMR values of zero which are not explained in the core logs but have been verified from 

core box photos and core inspection.  It was not possible to verify factors influencing RQD values 

(e.g., core size variations, drilling-induced damage, etc.).  The cores are likely more fractured than 

the in situ undisturbed condition.  It is likely that large diameter core (PQ-size) carefully drilled and 

handled would have higher RQD values.  RQD values are used to estimate the rock mass rating 

(RMR) values used to characterize rock quality. 

Values of RMR89 (Beniewaski, 1989) and Q (Barton et al, 1974) were estimated for the five zones 

around the pit.  RQD values were averaged from the boreholes within the rock region.  Values of 

unconfined compressive strength (UCS) were estimated based on field observation of the rock types 

and from typical values found in literature.  Values for joint spacing, joint set number, joint alteration, 

and groundwater conditions were estimated based on visual observations made from the pit ramps.  

The estimated rock quality is summarized in Table 14.1.2.1 according to rock type and zone around 

the pit.  No rock strength testing has been performed for the project.  

Fractures and Faulting – Mapping of geologic features and discontinuities have been conducted 

(Mendoza, 2011).  Figures 14-2 and 14-3 show the mapped fractures and faults for the Taunus pit 

and the north outcrop, respectively.  The orientations of the mapped faults are summarized on Table 

14.1.2.2.  

The fracture data for the 103 mapped structures were analyzed using the DIPS program.  The 

stereographic projections of mapped fractures are shown on Figures 14-4.  The four potential 

dominant joint sets are indicated on this figure.  Figures 14-5 shows a rose diagram of mapped 

fractures orientations.  The two pairs of sub-orthogonal sets can be seen in the fracture count of the 

rose diagram.  A summary of the average joint set orientations is provided on Table 14.1.2.3.

Hydrogeologic Characterization – No hydrogeology testing has been conducted for the project.  

However, the following statements can be made based on history of flooding and draining of the pit. 

The pit was allowed to fill with water after mining ceased in 1999.  It remained filled until May 2010 

(5/21/10) when Marlin Gold started pumping it out for access to the pit bottom for exploration drilling.  

The water level in the pit at the time was +125 masl, or about 2-3 m below the ground surface.  The 

high water level in the pit suggests that the local groundwater elevation is near surface.  

The pit was pumped empty by Feb 2011 (2/12/11).  It took about 267 days to pump the pit empty.  

The pumped volume is estimated to be 1,075,785 m3 based on an average pumping rate of 

approximately 65 liters/sec.  The total volume of the pit is about 758,823 m3.  The difference would 

be water that came into the pit via precipitation, surface runoff and groundwater inflow. 

Continuous pumping was maintained after the pit was emptied until the in-pit drilling program was 

completed.  During drilling, the pump ran for approximately 1.7hrs/day at 32.6 litres/sec, or about 

194,817 litres per day.  During the drilling period when the pit was pumped there were no obvious 

seeps or springs in the pit wall.  The pumps were shutoff July 2011 (7/15/11) and the pit was allowed 

to naturally refill.  The current water elevation as of the site visit (2/16/12) was 65 masl, or 21 m 

above the pit floor.  Over the last 7 months (216 days) the pit has since been allowed to naturally 

refill.  

Techtronic Stress and Seismic Conditions – No stress measurements have been made at the mine.  

A literature review also does not indicate that stress measurements have been made in the vicinity of 

the mine.  The likely principal horizontal stresses, according to the world stress map, are oriented 

north-south.  This information is based on borehole breakout data and could be a combination of 

strike-slip and thrust displacements.  The regional faulting provides little indication of the current

stress regime.  However, in the absence of on-site stress measurements, it is reasonable to assume 

the major principal stress is oriented north-south parallel the Chandler Fault and is equal in 

magnitude to the lithostatic vertical stress (i.e., �H = �V = �gh).  It is also assumed that the minor 

principal stress is oriented east-west perpendicular to the Chandler Fault and is half of the vertical 

stress (i.e., �h=0.5 �V). 

The site is located about 615 km north-west of the source of the Mn =8.1 Michoacan earthquake of 

1985.  This earthquake was offshore in the San Andreas Fault.  According to a seismic study of the 

Aguamilpa dam, which is about 140 km southeast of the site, the region is sufficiently inland from the 

San Andreas fault system that, according to the Mexican Seismic Chart (Esteva, 1970), it is located 

in Seismic Zone 1 (low seismicity).  Figure 14-6 shows the historic seismic events near Aguamilpa 

Dam, about 140 km south of site.  The maximum considered earthquake (MCE) maps for spectral 

ordinates at 0.2 sec and 1.0 sec indicate Ss = 0.6 and S1 = 0.28, respectively, for the area around 

Mazatlan should be used to estimate the seismic response spectra parameters.  These maps are 

generally based on the USGS probabilistic maps for ground motion with 2 percent probability of 

exceedance in 50 years; approximately 2,500-year return period (IBC, 2008).  The site is assumed to 

be classified as a Class D site class consisting of stiff soil with shear wave velocities between 180 

m/s < sv < 360 m/s and standard penetration tests between 15< N < 50 or the undrained shear 

strength between 50 kPa < Su < 100 kPa. The response spectra factors Fa = 1.3 and Fv = 1.8 should 

be used.

 Open Pit Geotechnical Stability 14.1.3

The estimated rock mass conditions for open pit highwall are summarized in Table 14.1.3.1.  Visual 

inspection of the data suggests that rock quality immediately around the veins will be variable.   

Table 14.1.3.1:  Summary of Average Rock Quality Used for Pit Wall Stability 

Highwall RMR Rock Quality Rock Class Shear Strength Parameters
Top 15 m zone 17 ± 8 Very Poor, highly weathered Class V φ=20, Coh=50 kPa 
East wall zone 45 ± 10 Fair, minor cross structure Class III φ=30, Coh=250 kPa 
South wall zone  34 ± 10 Poor, sheared Class IV φ=25, Coh=150 kPa 
West wall zone 25 ± 10 Poor, cross structure Class IV φ=25, Coh=150 kPa 
North wall zone 42 ± 10 Fair, some sheared Class III φ=30, Coh=250 kPa 

 

Broad design concept for pit layout 

The relevant processing test and exploration results that apply to assessing stability of the pit walls 

primarily depends on the maximum depth of the pit.  Total mineable material is about 7.75 Mt, of 

which 5.9 Mt is high grade material at an average 1.6 g/t and 2.8 Mt is low grade material at 0.27 g/t.  

The life of mine is planned to be about 5 years, during which time a total of about 49.43 Mt of waste 

rock will be removed.  The planned pit depths by phase are the following.  

 φI = 15 m deep, 1 Mt heap material, 1 Mt waste; 
 φII = 37 m deep, 4 Mt heap material, 26 Mt waste; 
 φIII = 63 m deep, 5 Mt heap material, 47 Mt waste; and 
 Ultimate pit: 230 m deep, 7.75 Mt heap material, 49.43 Mt waste. 

Acknowledging that these pit shells may change as additional data are collected and analyzed, they 

become the starting point for assessing appropriate geotechnical mine design parameters.  For 

reference, the ground elevation 136 msl and is nearly flat beyond the limits of the pit.   

Assumed Pit slope design constraints 

Open pit production rate will be 32,000 t/d over 5 years to mine to the ultimate pit shell.  This mining 

rate includes stripping and waste rock removal.  A mining flitch will be in 5 m vertical block height 

increments.  A single operating bench is assumed to be 3 flitches or 15 m high.  Consistent, good 

quality controlled blasting will be used to produce a relatively undisturbed wall face. 

The average density of the heap material is assumed to be about 2.7 t/m3 and the averaged density 

of waste rock is about 2.53 t/m3.  These values were used to convert pit volumes into tonnes of rock 

mined. 

This area of Mexico receives over 120 cm of rain per year.  Groundwater elevations are known to be 

near the ground surface from observations of water levels in the inactive pit.  It is anticipated that pit 

dewatering will be required to depressurize the rock mass below the pit walls.  This will be necessary 

to maintain the required stability of pit walls.  Dewatering will be on an inter-ramp scale on all rock 

walls. 

The joint sets were analyzed for potential structural stability control.  Figure 14-7 is a lower-

hemisphere stereographic projection of the dominant joint sets.  This figure indicates the potential 

kinematic wedges day-lighting in west bench wall.  Repeating wedges are formed by the intersection 

of joint sets as follows

 Joint sets #1 (50/54) and #3 (43/125) – wedges in the west wall benches; and  
 Joint sets #2 (82/228) and #4 (47/312) – wedges in the east wall benches.  

Observations from the current pit suggest that these moderately-high angled wedges fail by raveling 

of the rock mass in small blocks over the long-term as the bench relaxes.  The schematic shown on 

Figure 14-8 illustrates the potential 3-D blocks that would be formed in the west wall of the pit as 

formed by joint sets 1 and 2.

Assuming a single bench height of 15 m it might be feasible in competent rock areas to mine a 

double benched configuration of 30 m high.  This would apply to the east wall; however the current 

pit has been designed for only single 15 m bench heights because of the limited geotechnical data 

available to have confidence in recommending double bench heights.  The minimum bench width is 

assumed as follows: 

 7 m widths for single operating 15 m bench height; and 
 14 m widths double 30 m bench height. 

The minimum ramp width is 14 m for the type of haul trucks planned.  The single bench is preferred 

for arresting ravel-type rockfalls and localized wedge instabilities, while a double bench could be 

used periodically as a catch bench to arrest low-probability rockfalls that role from previous benches 

above.  Such catch bench should include a 1 m berm and be vertically spaced less than about 100 m 

from the previous catch bench where there are no ramp crossings on the wall. 

The overall pit angle required for stability is assumed to be a single consistent angle.  Insufficient 

geotechnical data exists to justify compound pit angle.  The ultimate pit depth (230 m) will control 

global stability.  This wall height is considered high by historic standards.  However, there is a lack of 

failure data in the literature.  The state-of-practice for new pits are commonly approaching these 

depths and are utilizing more detailed analyses (e.g., numerical models) to demonstrate adequate 

stability.   

An empirical approach to assessing maximum overall pit angle is adopted for this study based on 

work by Reed and Stacy (2004).  Figure 14-9 indicates that an overall pit angle of 45° in a dewatered

rock mass with a GSI range of 30 to 40 should have a factor of safety (FOS) of about 1.3 for a pit 

wall height of 230 m.  It is estimated that GSI values are about 5 points less than RMR values after 

accounting for weathering, orientation of structures, mining induced stresses, blasting disturbance 

and residual water after dewatering. The inter-ramp angle is assumed to be 50°.

14.2 Pit Optimization 
Pit optimization was based on preliminary economic estimations of mining, processing and selling 

related costs.  These preliminary costs are likely to vary from those reported in the final economic 

analysis, which are based on the final pit selection and mine production schedule. 

As part of the resource evaluation, Whittle® pit optimizations were carried out on Taunus Deposit.  

For the PEA, pit optimization results have been used as a guide for pit and waste dump construction.  

In all cases, measured, indicated and inferred resources have been considered during pit 

optimization.    

Pit optimization was carried out on the SRK resource model using Whittle™ v4.2 pit optimization 

software in conjunction with Maptek's Vulcan 8.1™ general-purpose mine planning package. 

The PEA is preliminary in nature, that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 

speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 

them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

 Whittle® Results and Analysis 14.2.2

As a result of the pit optimization, the relationship of potential pit shells is based on stripping ratio 

variability and subject to a gold revenue of US$1,500/oz Au.  By looking at the relationship of 

potentially mineable resource to waste and the associated best case (blue line) and worst case (red 

line) cash flows (Figure 14-10) generated at each incremental pit, the risk profile and revenue 

generating potential of the deposit can be estimated.  For illustration purposes, pit 36 represents the 

maximum possible cash flow at US$1,500/oz Au, pit 86 represents a pit constructed using 

US$3,000/oz Au gold (But dependent on US$1,500/oz Au revenue) and pit 1 represents a pit 

constructed using US$420/oz Au.

Figure 14-10:  Default Pit Shell Graph 

 

With reference to Figure 14-11, the Whittle® analysis for Taunus indicated that the best value within 

the deposit can be obtained from pit 0 through pit 20.  After this time the majority of resource is 

depleted and only incremental increase in value can be achieved.  SRK would consider this deposit 

to be resource limited at US$1,500/oz Au. 

An unusual feature of the pit analysis, are the two pronounced increases of resources at pit 3 and pit 

20.  To better define additional pits that may form the basis for detailed phase design, the 

optimization parameters relating to revenue factor were restricted to 0 and 1 (or $0 to $1500 gold).

Figure 14-11:  Detailed Pit Shell Analysis 

 

Even using a much lower gold value increment for pit shell construction, (pit 48 = $1,500Oz Au and 

pit 1 = $90/Oz Au) the definitive step between a potential phase 1 and phase 2 pit still exists.  This 

pronounced jump between these two shells (pit 15 and pit 33) and significant size difference, indicate 

how sensitive the optimization is to liberate the main pods of heap material, and, lack of mine 

selectivity for phase design.  Without the inclusion of mining width and detail economic modeling, 

whittle suggest the breakeven pit is between the $480/oz Au and $510 oz Au pit shells. 

14.3 Pit Design Parameters 
To improve the geotechnical stability of the pit wall and reduce the need for a catch bench in addition 

to the design berm widths, the ramp was located in a circular spiral from the bottom of the pit up.  

Ramp widths were based on expected mining trucks on the order of 100 t capacity and sized at 22 

m.  One-way traffic haul roads were used at the pit bottom at a width of 14 m. 

It is expected that the mining face will be 6 m high and berms placed every 30m for geotechnical 

reasons. 

Roads have a maximum gradient of 10% assigned to the shortest distance along a ramp, which 

prevents gradient rules being broken around corners.  The inside circumference of a ramp may be 

greater than 8% if the gradient is applied to the ramp centerline or high wall.

Table 14.2.1 is a summary of the recommended geotechnical design parameters for the open pit 

design.

Berm Width m 16 
Double Bench Height m 30 
Ramp Width – 2 way m 22

Pit design parameters will need to be verified with additional slope stability analyses for any 

prefeasibility or further design, however, for this scoping-level design the parameters are reasonable. 

 Pit and Phase Design Commentary 14.3.1

The pit design was constructed using Vulcan 8.1 mine planning software and used both bench toe 

and crest string placement.  Commentary on the pit and phase design includes: 

 Mining widths for phase 1 are liberal and appropriate for bulk mining excavation; 
 Mining widths for phase 2 on the northern end of the pit are extremely tight at 2 ramp widths 

or approximately 40 m.  The north end of the wall is essentially shared between phase 1 and 

phase 2; 

 Ramps are not favored to either east or west and the exit was targeted near the crusher; 
 No Arroyo limitation was considered for the PEA; 
 Phase 1 has 4 single lane benches; 
 Phase 2 has 4 single lane benches;  
 30 m benches were favored to extend width of catch berms to ensure loose material did not 

accelerate down the pit slope; and 

 Phase construction based on mining width was considered but discarded due to difficulty in 
providing the heap with a consistent ounce feed based on orebody geometry.

14.4 In-Situ Production Schedule 
Production scheduling was carried out using Vulcan™ (v8.1.2) and its scheduling package 

Chronos™.  The schedule was constructed around a maximum annual tonnage that decreases as 

the pit deepens and balanced by the consistent ounce supply that grade upward as deeper higher 

grade resource is encountered.   

The potential heap feed was defined using a 0.17 oz/t Au cut-off grade (CoG) as indicated from pit 

optimization work.  A preproduction pre-strip period was not included in the production schedule

although with the inclusion of re-processing of the historical heap pad, year one may be treated as 

pre-production.  

Phase design triangulations were cut into benches, and then into reasonably sized mining shapes for 

creating an annual schedule.  Tonnes and grades were calculated for each of these mining shapes 

and this information was imported to the schedule.  An optimized scheduling method using CPLEX 

linear solver was then used until ounce and total production targets were met for each time period.   

This scheduling method ensured control of the following: 

 Number of benches mined in a period; 
 Lag between phases; and 
 Ramp up ounce feed

The PEA is preliminary in nature, that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too 

speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable 

them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.

14.5 Mine Operations 
Contractor mining operations are expected to be used at Taunus given the short mine life of the 

Project. 

As part of initial evaluations, Marlin Gold has interviewed 6 potential mine contractors and the results 

are detailed in Table 14.5.1.  Prices do not include explosives and therefore have been estimated at 

$0.15/t.

Drilling 

The initial drilling equipment fleet would consist of Roc 9 (or equivalent) blast-hole drills capable of 

drilling 127 mm blast holes.  Working benches will be 6 m.  Blast-hole cuttings will be collected and 

analyzed in the mine sample laboratory.  Together with blast hole survey data, the results will be 

plotted on maps, and laid out in the field as part of a grade control program.

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

Blasting 

Heavy ammonium nitrate/fuel oil (ANFO) explosives would predominantly be used but may be 

supplemented by emulsion during wet periods or groundwater inflows.  The anticipated powder 

factor for main production blasting is 0.2 kg/tonne. 

Loading 

The main loading equipment fleet will either consist of hydraulic shovels, Terex RH90-C (or 

equivalent) capable of loading the truck fleet of most likely Caterpillar 777 (100st capacity) rigid body 

haul trucks (or equivalent) or Caterpillar 992G (or equivalent) front-end loaders. 

Hauling 

Cycle times have not been calculated at this level of study.  It is expected the haul distances will be 

in excess of 1,000 m so the incremental hauling cost (Ie: 15 c/km over 1,000 m) will need to be 

negotiated with potential contractors. 

Mining Support 

The mine major mining support equipment may consist of one-track dozer (Cat D8 class), one 

rubber-tired dozer (Cat 834 class), a grader (Cat 16G class), a water truck (8,000gal) and a backhoe.  

The track dozer will be required for drill site preparation, road and ramp development, waste dump 

and stockpile maintenance, and other duties.  The rubber-tired dozers will assist the hydraulic 

shovels if needed, and other lighter dozing duties.  The grader and water truck will maintain mine 

roads, ramps and operating surfaces, and the excavator will perform ancillary work, and site 

development work including pioneering and road development.  The mine will also have equipment 

for pit lighting.  Various other mining equipment maintenance support trucks will be required. 

The mine department will have mine surveying equipment, mine engineering and geology office 

equipment (instruments, computers, software, printers, plotter etc.), and mine communications 

(radios). 

Ancillary Mining Operations 

Ground Preparation 

Where necessary, the mining advance will be preceded by ground preparation consisting of soil 

clearing and cleanup, and will be carried out with a Cat D8-type track dozer and backhoe.  Topsoil 

will be stockpiled in an appropriate location and will be used later for reclamation purposes. 

Mine Area Drainage 

The mine will be responsible for mine water management operations.  To the extent possible, 

diversion ditches will be located above the open pit areas to drain water flowing towards the pit area 

and re-direct it into natural or potential engineered drainages.  Where this is not possible diversion 

ditch structures will be developed within the pit area to drain water away from the pit.  Mine 

dewatering will also be accomplished using diesel generator powered submersible pumps placed in 

sumps at pit bottoms.  Water coming into contact with the mining operations will be pumped from the 

pit area and collected.  All collected drainage water will be held in drainage basins, where suspended 

solids will be removed by decantation.

15 Recovery Methods (Item 17) 

15.1 Processing Methods  
Recovery of gold from the Trinidad project will be performed by heap leaching.  Mined heap material 

will be transported by truck and stockpiled at the crusher facility.  The heap material will be crushed, 

agglomerated, and transported to the leach pad with grasshopper conveyors, radial stacked and 

then leached with a weak cyanide solution to extract the contained gold values.  Gold will  be  

recovered from the pregnant leach solution (PLS) in an ADR plant  by adsorbing the extracted gold 

onto activated carbon followed by desorption into an upgraded and purified gold-bearing solution, 

electrowinning  and  smelting to recover the extracted gold as a final product.  Figure 15-1 shows a 

schematic process flowsheet.

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

The crushing, agglomeration and stacking circuits are designed for 260 t/h, with operations 

scheduled for 24 hours per day and 7 days per week.  At an expected 70% operating availability, this 

will result in the conveying and stacking of an average of 4,300 t/d onto the heap leach pad, 

equivalent to 1.55 Mt/y. 

Run-of-mine (ROM) heap material will be truck-dumped into a feed hopper and fed to a vibrating 

grizzly feeder with 1.5 inch openings.  The grizzly oversize will be crushed by a 30 inch x 42 inch jaw 

crusher with a 4 inch closed-side setting (CSS).  Both the grizzly undersize and the jaw crusher 

discharge will be combined and conveyed to the secondary crushing circuit. 

The secondary crushing circuit consists of a 7 ft x 20 ft double deck screen, fitted with a 1.5 inch top 

deck screen cloth and a 3/8 inch screen cloth on the bottom deck and an MVP 380 cone crusher 

operated in open circuit.  The +1.5 inch screen oversize will feed the secondary cone crusher set at 

a 3/4 inch CSS.  The cone crusher discharge will   be conveyed to the tertiary crushing circuit which 

consists of an MVP 380 cone crusher operated in closed circuit with a 7 ft x 20 ft double deck screen 

fitted with  ¾ inch top deck and  3/8 inch bottom deck to produce a final -3/8 inch crushed product. 

The final crushed product will be agglomerated in an agglomerating drum with approximately 2 kg/t 

Portland cement prior to being conveyed to the heap leach pad.  Water (or barren solution) will be 

added to achieve the proper slurry consistency.  The plant will be equipped with a belt scale to 

control the heap material feed rate and cement addition.  Dust control will be by an engineered wet 

dust suppression system. 

 Heap Leaching 15.1.1

The agglomerated heap material will be conveyed to the lined heap leach pad by a series of 36 inch 

wide by 100 ft long grasshopper conveyors, which will feed a 36 inch x 140 ft long telescopic radial 

stacker.    

Cyanide solution at a concentration of about 300 g/L NaCN will be pumped from the barren pond to 

the leach pad and distributed by a series of pipes and emitters.  The leach cycle time is estimated at 

60 days and will consist of two 30 day cycles.  The first 30 day leach cycle will have an application 

rate of 10 L/hr/m2; the second 30 day leach cycle will have an application rate will be 5 L/hr/m2.  Total 

area under irrigation is estimated at 55,000 m2.  

The current design is for a conventional multi-lift heap leach will include a maximum of six 8m meter 

high lifts.  It is noted, however, that the material from the Taunus pit is expected to have a high 

percentage of fines, and it is uncertain at this level of study whether heap leaching will best be 

accomplished with a conventional multi-lift dedicated heap, or by an on/off heap leach strategy.  

Additional studies will be required to assess the degree to which heap material can be stacked and 

leached while maintaining adequate leach solution percolation rates. 

The pregnant solution pond has been designed with a holding capacity of 20,182 m3, which, at a 

nominal flow of 338 m3/hr, will have and storage capacity for 60 hours flow.  The barren solution 

pond has been designed with a holding capacity for 15,353 m3 and at a nominal flow of 383 m 3/hr 

will have storage capacity for 40 hours of flow.  Designs also include provision for an emergency 

pond with a capacity of 27,667 m3 which will provide an additional 82 hours of storage capacity at 

nominal flow of 338 m3/hr.  Figure 15-2 shows the Phase 1 heap leach pad and ponds layout, and 

Figure 15-3 shows the heap leach pad at its ultimate design height.

 ADR Plant  15.1.2

A carbon ADR (gold adsorption, desorption and recovery) circuit will be used to recover the gold and 

silver values from the pregnant leach solution. The ADR plant will include a 5-stage carbon-in-

column (CIC) circuit consisting of five, 12 ft diameter cascading columns, each having 2 t carbon 

capacity.  Pregnant solution will be pumped to the first of the adsorption columns and then cascade 

sequentially to next four columns in the series.  The discharge from the fifth column will be barren 

and flow to the barren pond.  Carbon will be transferred counter-current to the solution flow.  The 

"loaded" carbon from the first column will be transferred to an acid wash vessel, where it will be acid 

washed, neutralized and transferred to the strip vessel. 

Gold and silver will be stripped from the carbon by circulating a hot NaOH/NaCN solution maintained 

at about 1500 F through the vessel for about 16 hours per batch.  The stripped carbon will then be 

transferred to a 2 t/d regeneration kiln, or sent directly to the washing and sizing circuit. The 

reactivated carbon will then be transferred to a storage bin for recycle back to the CIC circuit. 

The gold-bearing "strip" solution will be pumped at the rate of about 1.5 m3/h to a bank of electrolytic 

cells where the gold will be recovered as a sludge on the cathodes.  The gold "sludge" will be 

collected, filtered, dried, mixed with fluxes and then smelted in a diesel-fired furnace.  If, during 

subsequent studies, significant levels of mercury are identified in the heap material, it may be 

necessary to make provision for appropriate mercury handling facilities.

15.4 Consumable Requirements 
Process plant consumable and operating costs are summarized in Table 15.4.1.  The total process 

plant operating cost (excluding labor) is estimated at US$5.73 per of material processed.  Of this 

total, consumable costs are estimated at US$2.30/t, operating and maintenance supplies at 

US$1.68/t, wear parts at US$1.06/t and power at US$0.59/t.  

Cyanide consumption is estimated at 0.3 kg/t and is based on the cyanide consumption reported 

from the closed-cycle column testwork conducted at Metcon and adjusted based on experience with

commercial operations.  It should be noted that cyanide consumption in a commercial operation is 

typically much less than reported during column testing.  

Lime consumption is estimated at 1 kg/t and is based on column test results.  Cement consumption 

is estimated at 2 kg/t and was determined to be the maximum amount of cement that could be added 

without detrimentally effecting gold extraction. 

Total power consumption is estimated at 4.57 kWh/t of material processed.  At electrical supply cost 

of US$0.13/kWh, this is equivalent to US$0.59/t.

18 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or 
Community Impact (Item 20) 

18.1 Environmental Studies and Background Information 
SRK's environmental specialist did not conduct a site visit of the Trinidad/Taunus Project.  As such, 

the following assessment is predicated on a review of available documentation and direct 

communications with the project proponent. 

The site is currently disturbed as a result of previous mining operations.  Current conditions at the 

site principally include residual facilities from that operation: 

 Open pit (flooded); 
 Waste rock disposal facility (naturally re-vegetated); 
 Heap leach pad (to be re-mined and re-leached); and  
 Various refurbished buildings and exploration cap facilities. 

These existing facilities are intended to be incorporated into the proposed exploration and mineral 

exploitation plan currently proposed by Marlin Gold.  The small village of Buenavista is situated 

approximately 0.5 km west of the open pit, while the town of Maloya is just over 1.25 km to the 

northwest. 

Limited data and documents are available for this early stage of the project.  Those that were 

provided for review have not been officially translated, and SRK was obliged to employ electronic 

translation software to convert them from the original Spanish, thus limiting the efficiency of the 

review.  In addition, several of the documents were conceptual or only available in draft form and 

may not accurately reflect the final design conditions of the facility.  

The principal document used for the environmental assessment was: 

 Manifestación de Impacto Ambiental Modalidad Partícular, (MIA) Para el Proyecto 
Explotación y Exploración Mina La Trinidad, Comunidad de Maloya, El Rosario, Sinaloa was 

completed and submitted to SEMARNAT in April 2012, and approved in November 2012 

(including the resolutions for the terms of reference for preparation of the MIA developed and 

issued by SEMARNAT). 

The current plan for exploration and mining is provided in the MIA, along with the Level 2 Risk 

Analysis (Analisis de Riesgo).  The ETJCUS (estudio tecnico justificativo para el cambio de uso de 

suelo, or "change of use of land"), the third critical permitting document for exploration and mining in 

Mexico, was submitted for approval in November 2012, with a tentative response date by the 

agencies of  January 31, 2013. 

 Tailings Disposal 18.1.1

There are no tailings disposal areas currently proposed or included in the project.  There is sufficient 

land available for tailings storage for future operations, if necessary.

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

 Waste Management 18.1.2

There is a historic heap leach pad and waste rock disposal area.  Adequate locations for waste rock 

disposal and heap leach pads are available to accommodate the current resources for future 

operations.  The existing heap leach material will be excavated and re-leached on a new engineered 

pad system, thus reducing its potential to be a future liability for the project. 

Knight Piésold conducted a static acid/base test on ten samples of ore/waste (Exploraciones 

Eldorado, 1995).  The total sulfide and sulfur contents of the samples were at, and below detection 

limit.  From the observations, it was concluded the rocks presented little acid generating capacity.  

Samples were collected from material generally within the oxide zone.  Therefore, rocks from deeper 

levels, below the depth of past exploitation, may have a different acid generating capacity.Site 

Monitoring 

Baseline monitoring has been conducted as part of the environmental impact assessment process 

for both the original exploration as well as the currently proposed exploitation projects.  Groundwater 

and surface water samples were collected for analysis.  Studies of the local flora and fauna were 

also undertaken.  This information is presented in the current MIA document submitted to 

SEMARNAT in April 2012. 

Marlin Gold engaged Servicios Profesionales Nautilus, S.C. ("Nautilus") from Mazatlan, Mexico to 

collect water samples and fish samples from the mined pit to assess the water quality of the pit.  

Samples were sent to Laquin Mazatlan Labratorio Quimico Industrial, Mazatlan Mexico.  Results of 

the analysis indicated that both the water and fish samples are within acceptable limits as defined in 

NOM-001-Semarnat_1996 for water and Norma official Mexicana NOM-027-SSA1-993 for fish 

samples.  None of the samples had anomalous readings in any of the elements tested.   

Additional water samples were collected by Nautilus in 2010 and analyzed by Laquin Mazatlan 

Laboratory.  The samples were taken at three different water levels in the pit to determine if the 

water was safe to pump into the local stream.  Results from the analysis indicated that the water was 

within acceptable limits to be pumped.Site monitoring, especially groundwater monitoring will 

continue throughout operations, and into post-closure.  The protection of groundwater resources, 

including monitoring, is provided for in Environmental Management Plan (Plan de Manejo Ambiental) 

(MIA, Appendix 8).  Three groundwater monitoring wells are include in the current site plans to 

monitor groundwater conditions around the heap leach pad and process solution ponds; wells No. 1 

and 2 north of the ponds, with  No. 3 southeast of the pad.   

In addition, mitigation and monitoring of the resources impacted by the proposed operation are also 

detailed in the EMP, specifically in:  

 Wildlife displacement mitigation and management program; 
 Floral salvage and relocation program for ecological restoration of the project; 
 Rescue, conservation and restoration of soils; and 
 Water protection program. 

 Water Management 18.1.3

The existing open pit is currently flooded as the result of stormwater overflows from Arroyo Azules 

and Arroyo El Bacin.  Marlin Gold engaged the Nautilus environmental group from Mazatlan, Mexico 

to collect water samples and fish tissue samples from the pit to assess the water quality and the

condition of aquatic life. Results of the testing indicated that both the water and fish tissue samples 

are within acceptable limits as defined in Norma Official Mexicana (NOM)-001-Semarnat_1996 for 

water and NOM-027-SSA1-993 for fish samples.  Additional pit water samples were collected by 

Nautilus in 2010 at three different depths in the water column.  The results suggested that the water 

was of sufficient quality to pump and discharge directly into the adjacent drainages.  Nautilus was 

then commissioned to complete the environmental assessment and permitting requirements to 

dewater the historic pit.  A pumping permit was approved by the National Water Commission of 

Mexico (CNA).  Copies of the permits are available in Marlin Gold's site files. 

Signed permission was granted by the community to proceed with dewatering the pit.  Pit dewatering 

commenced June 2010.  By February 2011, less than 1 meter of water was left in the pit.  Marlin 

Gold intends to keep the pit dewatered as it continues to assess the viability of resuming mining 

operations through additional exploration. 

18.2 Mexican Environmental Regulatory Framework 

 Mining Law and Regulations 18.2.1

Mining in Mexico is regulated through the Mining Law, approved on June 26, 1992 and amended by 

decree on December 24, 1996, Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution.  

Article 6 of the Mining Law stipulates that the exploration; exploitation and processing of minerals or 

substance are of public use and have priority over any other use of the land, subject to compliance 

with laws and regulations.  

Article 19 specifies the right to obtain easements, the right to use the water flowing from the mine for 

both industrial and domestic use, and the right to obtain a preferential right for a concession of the 

mine waters.  

Articles 27, 37 and 39 rule that exploration; exploitation and processing activities must comply with 

environment laws and regulations and should incorporate technical standards in matters such as 

mine safety, ecological balance and environmental protection. 

The Mining Law Regulation of February 15, 1999 repealed the previous regulation of March 29, 

1993.  Article 62 of the regulation requires mining projects to comply with the General Environmental 

Law, its regulations, and all applicable norms.  

 General Environmental Laws and Regulations  18.2.2

Mexico's environmental protection system is based on the General Environmental Law known as Ley 

General del Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección al Ambiente - LGEEPA (General Law of Ecological 

Equilibrium and the Protection of the Environment), approved on January 28, 1988 and updated 

December 13, 1996.  

The Mexican federal authority over the environment is the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos 

Naturales - SEMARNAT (Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources). SEMARNAT, 

formerly known as SEDESOL, was formed in 1994, as the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente Recursos 

Naturales y Pesca (Secretariat of the Environment and Natural Resources and Fisheries). On 

November 30th, 2000, the Federal Public Administration Law was amended giving rise to 

SEMARNAT. The change in name corresponded to the movement of the fisheries subsector to the

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

Secretaría de Agricultura, Ganadería, Desarrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentación - SAGARPA 

(Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food), through which an 

increased emphasis was given to environmental protection and sustainable development. 

SEMARNAT is organized into a number of sub-secretariats and the following main divisions: 

 INE – Instituto Nacional de Ecología (National Institute of Ecology), an entity responsible for 
planning, research and development, conservation of national protection areas and approval 

of environmental standards and regulations; 

 PROFEPA - Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente (Federal Attorney General for 
the Protection of the Environment) responsible for law enforcement, public participation and 

environmental education; 

 CONAGUA – Comisión Nacional del Agua (National Water Commission), responsible for 
assessing fees related to water use and discharges; in addition, the CNA issues permits and 

concessions relating to the construction and use of surface water, as well as land use in the 

federal zones managed by this authority, after obtaining the relevant environmental 

authorization from SEMARNAT; 

 Mexican Institute of Water Technology; and 
 CONANP – Comisión Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas (National Commission of 

Natural Protected Areas). 

The federal delegation or state agencies of SEMARNAT are known as Consejo Estatal de Ecología 

– COEDE (State Council of Ecology).  

PROFEPA is the federal entity in charge of carrying out environmental inspections and negotiating 

compliance agreements.  Voluntary environmental audits, coordinated through PROFEPA, are 

encouraged under the LGEEPA. 

Under LGEEPA, a number of regulations and standards related to environmental impact 

assessment, air and water pollution, solid and hazardous waste management and noise have been 

issued.  LGEEPA specifies compliance by the states and municipalities, and outlines the 

corresponding duties. 

Applicable regulations under LGEEPA include: 

 Regulation to LGEEPA on the Matter of Environmental Impact Evaluations, May 30, 2000; 
 Regulation to LGEEPA on the Matter of Prevention and Control of Atmospheric 

Contamination, November 25, 1988; 

 Regulation to LGEEPA on the Matter of Environmental Audits, November 29, 2000; 
 Regulation to LGEEPA on Natural Protected Areas, November 20, 2000; 
 Regulation to LGEEPA on Protection of the Environment Due to Noise Contamination, 

December 6, 1982; and 

 Regulation to LGEEPA on the Matter of Hazardous Waste, November 25, 1988.  

Mine tailings are listed in the Regulation to LGEEPA on the Matter of Hazardous Waste.  Norms 

include: 

 Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM)-CRP-001-ECOL, 1993, which establishes the characteristics 
of hazardous wastes, lists the wastes, and provides threshold limits for determining its 

toxicity to the environment;

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

 NOM-CRP-002-ECOL, 1993 establishes the test procedure for determining if a waste is 
hazardous; 

 On September 13, 2004, SEMARNAT published the final binding version of its new standard 
on mine tailings and mine tailings dams, NOM-141-SEMARNAT-2003.  The new rule has 

been renamed since the draft version was published in order to better reflect the scope of 

the new regulation.  This NOM sets out the procedure for characterizing tailings, as well as 

the specifications and criteria for characterizing, preparing, building, operating, and closing a 

mine tailings dam.  This very long (over 50 pages) and detailed standard sets out the new 

criteria for characterizing tailings as hazardous or non-hazardous, including new test 

methods.  A series of technical annexes address everything from waste classification to 

construction of the dams.  The rule is applicable to all generators of non-radioactive tailings 

and to all dams constructed after this NOM goes into effect; and 

 Existing tailings dams will have to comply with the new standards on post-closure.  The 
NOM formally went into effect sixty (60) days after its publication date.  

PROFEPA "Clean Industry" 

The Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente (the enforcement portion of Mexico's 

Environmental Agency, referred to as PROFEPA), administers a voluntary environmental audit 

program and certifies businesses with a "Clean Industry" designation if they successfully complete 

the audit process.  The voluntary audit program was established by legislative mandate in 1996 with 

a directive for businesses to be certified once they meet a list of requirements including the 

implementation of international best practices, applicable engineering and preventative corrective 

measures.  

In the Environmental Audit, firms contract third-party, PROFEPA-accredited auditors, considered 

experts in fields such as risk management and water quality, to conduct the audit process. During 

this audit, called "Industrial Verification," auditors determine if facilities are in compliance with 

applicable environmental laws and regulations.  If a site passes, it receives designation as a "Clean 

Industry" and is able to utilize the Clean Industry logo as a message to consumers and the 

community that it fulfills its legal responsibilities.  If a site does not pass, the government can close 

part, or all of a facility if it deems it necessary.  However, PROFEPA wishes to avoid such extreme 

actions and instead prefers to work with the business to create an "Action Plan" to correct problem 

areas.  

The Action Plan is established between the government and the business based on suggestions of 

the auditor from the Industrial Verification.  It creates a time frame and specific actions a site needs 

to take in order to be in compliance and solve existing or potential problems.  An agreement is then 

signed by both parties to complete the process.  When a facility successfully completes the Action 

Plan, it is then eligible to receive the Clean Industry designation. 

PROFEPA believes this program fosters a better relationship between regulators and industry, 

provides a green label for businesses to promote themselves and reduces insurance premiums for 

certified facilities.  The most important aspect, however, is the assurance of legal compliance 

through the use of the Action Plan, a guarantee that ISO 14001 and other Environmental 

Management Systems cannot make. 

According to mine personnel, Marlin Gold intends to participate in the Clean Industry program.

SIGA 

Many companies in Mexico adopt the corporate policy, Sistema Integral de Gestión Ambiental 

(SIGA) (Integral System of Environmental Management), for the protection of the environmental and 

prevention of adverse environmental impacts.  SIGA emphasizes a commitment to environmental 

protection along with sustainable development, as well as a commitment to strict adherence to 

environmental legislation and regulation and a process of continuous review and improvement of 

company policies and programs.  The companies continue to improve their commitments to 

environmental stewardship through the use of the latest technologies that are proven, available, and 

economically viable.  According to mine personnel, Marlin Gold intends to adopt SIGA once 

production has begun and is stable. 

Other industry programs that Marlin Gold intends to participate in include: 

 Seeking accreditation under the voluntary self-management program for health and safety 
with the Mexican Department of Labor and Social Welfare (PASST); and 

 Strive to receive the Social Responsible Company (ESR) Distinctive, which is awarded by 
the Mexican Center of Philanthropy. 

 Other Laws and Regulations  18.2.3

Water Resources  

Water resources are regulated under the National Water Law, December 1, 1992 and its regulation, 

January 12, 1994 (amended by decree, December 4, 1997). In Mexico, ecological criteria for water 

quality is set forth in the Regulation by which the Ecological Criteria for Water Quality are 

Established, CE-CCA-001/89, dated December 2, 1989. These criteria are used to classify bodies of 

water for suitable uses including drinking water supply, recreational activities, agricultural irrigation, 

livestock use, aquaculture use and for the development and preservation of aquatic life. The quality 

standards listed in the regulation indicate the maximum acceptable concentrations of chemical 

parameters and are used to establish wastewater effluent limits. Ecological water quality standards 

defined for water used for drinking water, protection of aquatic life, agricultural irrigation and irrigation 

water and livestock watering are listed in Table 2.3. 

Discharge limits have been established for particular industrial sources, although limits specific to 

mining projects have not been developed.  NOM-001-ECOL-1996, January 6, 1997, establishes 

maximum permissible limits of contaminants in wastewater discharges to surface water and national 

"goods" (waters under the jurisdiction of the CONAGUA).  

Daily and monthly effluent limits are listed for discharges to rivers used for agricultural irrigation, 

urban public use and for protection of aquatic life; for discharges to natural and artificial reservoirs 

used for agricultural irrigation and urban public use; for discharges to coastal waters used for 

recreation, fishing, navigation and other uses and to estuaries; and discharges to soils and to 

wetlands.  Effluent limitations for discharges to rivers used for agricultural irrigation, for protection of 

aquatic life and for discharges to reservoirs used for agricultural irrigation have also been 

established. 

Ecological Resources 

In 2000, the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) (formerly CONABIO, the 

National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity) was created as a decentralized entity

of SEMARNAT.  As of November 2001, 127 land and marine Natural Protected Areas had been 

proclaimed, including biosphere reserves, national parks, national monuments, flora and fauna 

reserves, and natural resource reserves.  

Ecological resources are protected under the Ley General de Vida Silvestre (General Wildlife Law). 

(NOM)-059-ECOL-2000 specifies protection of native flora and fauna of Mexico.  It also includes 

conservation policy, measures and actions, and a generalized methodology to determine the risk 

category of a species.  

Other laws and regulations include: 

 Forest Law, December 22, 1992, amended November 31, 2001, and the Forest Law 
Regulation, September 25, 1998; 

 Fisheries Law, June 25, 1992, and the Fisheries Law Regulations, September 29, 1999; and 
 Federal Ocean Law, January 8, 1986. 

Regulations Specific to Mining Projects 

All aspects related to Mine Safety and Occupational Health are regulated in Mexico by NOM-023-

STPS-2003 issued by the Secretariat of Labor.   

NOM-120-ECOL-1997, November 19, 1998 specifies environmental protection measures for mining 

explorations activities in temperate and dry climate zones that would affect xerophytic brushwood 

(matorral xerofilo), tropical (caducifolio) forests, or conifer or oak (encinos) forests.  The regulation 

applies to "direct" exploration projects defined as drilling, trenching, and underground excavations.  A 

permit from SEMARNAT is required prior to initiating activities and SEMARNAT must be notified 

when the activities have been completed.  Development and implementation of a Supervision 

Program for environmental protection and consultation with CONAGUA is required if aquifers may be 

affected.  Environmental protection measures are specified in the regulations, including materials 

management, road construction, reclamation of disturbance and closure of drill holes.  Limits on the 

areas of disturbance by access roads, camps, equipment areas, drill pads, portals, trenches, etc. are 

specified. 

 Expropriations 18.2.4

Expropriation of Ejido and communal properties is subject to the provisions of agrarian laws. 

 NAFTA 18.2.5

Canada, the United States and Mexico participate in the North American Free Trade Agreement 

(NAFTA).  NAFTA addresses the issue of environmental protection, but each country is responsible 

for establishing its own environmental rules and regulations.  However, the three countries must 

comply with the treaties between themselves; and the countries must not reduce their environmental 

standards as a means of attracting trade. 

 International Policy and Guidelines  18.2.6

International policies and/or guidelines that may be relevant to the Trinidad/Taunus Project include: 

 International Finance Corporation (Performance Standards) – social and environmental 
management planning; and

 World Bank Guidelines (Operational Policies and Environmental Guidelines). 

These items were not specifically identified and included in SRK's environmental scope of work; 

however, the baseline environmental data and impact analyses presented in the MIA appears to be 

of sufficient detail and quality to meet most of these policies, though the necessary Environmental 

and Social Management Plans are currently under development.  Until in operation, comparison to 

World Bank environmental quality criteria cannot be assessed. 

 The Permitting Process 18.2.7

Environmental permits are required from various federal and state agencies.  The general process 

for obtaining authorization to construct a new industrial facility is shown in Figure18-1.

Marlin Gold is in the 
progress to determinate 
the water well location to 
submit the water well 
construction permit in 
CONAGUA 

A permit is required for the 
extraction and use of 
groundwater and surface water 
(e.g., wells to supply potable 
water). The use of 
groundwater is regulated by 
CONAGUA and mine 
operators must pay for the 
water used. However, mine 
dewatering is regulated under 
the Mining Law and no permit 
is required to extract mine 
water.

the same procedure for the 
MIA authorization to 
dewater the pit for 
construction and operation. 

Water discharge is regulated 
by CONAGUA and a permit is 
required for most industrial 
discharges. The quality of the 
discharge must meet NOMs, 
although CONAGUA may 
issue particular limits.

Copies of the permits are available in Marlin Gold's site files. 

Signed permission was granted by the community to proceed with dewatering the pit.  Pit dewatering 

commenced June 2010.  As of February 2011 less than 1m of water is left in the pit.  Marlin Gold 

intends to keep the pit dewatered as it continues to assess the viability of resuming mining 

operations.

According to Marlin Gold, all required permits that are currently necessary for Marlin Gold's activities 

at Trinidad have been obtained, and are in good standing. 

In May 2011, Marlin Gold signed an exploitation and temporary occupation agreement with the 

community of Maloya, for which Marlin Gold was granted surface use and mine development rights 

on the Taunus deposit.   

18.3 Social Management Plan and Community Relations 
Marlin Gold has entered into an exploitation and temporary occupation agreement with the 

Community of Maloya, pursuant to which Marlin Gold was granted surface use and mine 

development rights on the Taunus deposit.  The details of the project Social Management Plan are 

currently under development, and not available for this assessment. 

18.4 Closure and Reclamation Plan 
Current regulations in México require that a preliminary closure program be included in the MIA and 

a definite program be developed and submitted to the authorities during the operation of the mine 

(generally accepted as three years into the operation).  These closure plans tend to be conceptual 

and typically lack much of the detail necessary to develop an accurate closure cost estimate.  

However, Marlin Gold has attempted to prescribe the necessary closure activities for the operation 

and anticipated costs as follows: 

Table 18.5.1:  Trinidad Cost of Reclamation and Closure of the Mine 

Closure Activity Cost Estimate US$

Demolition and removal of structures  $300,000

19 Capital and Operating Costs (Item 21) 

19.1 Capital Cost Estimates 
Capital costs totaling US$25.5 million are summarized in Table 19.1.1.  Initial capital of US$27.9 

million is included in the first year of pre-production and a negative capex of US$(2.4) million 

represents the ongoing capital.  This negative value is composed of the closure costs combined with 

a salvage value of US$1.8 million and the return of a Mexican equivalent of Value Added Tax called 

Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA), correspondent to 16% of the original estimate of capital 

investment, during the first year of operation. 

No sustaining capital has been included in the schedule, as construction of the complete heap leach 

and ponds infrastructure will occur in the pre-production year and the mine and process equipment 

should last through the entire life of the project, which is a short term of five years. 

Cost estimates are in Q4 2011 US constant dollar terms.  Table 19.1.1 summarized LoM capital 

costs.

19.2 Basis for Capital Cost Estimates 

 Mine 19.2.1

The mining operations has been considered to be contractor based, only ancillary equipment to 

maintain the accesses and support smaller operations have been included in the capital expenditure.  

The estimated cost of mine equipment is shown in Table 19.2.1.1.  Mine capital equipment costs 

were obtained from recent cost models and handbooks.

 Back-up Generators 2 $100 $200
Total $5,045

 

The overall mine equipment cost is US$5.045 million.  The open pit mining operation will be 

developed by a mining contractor. 

Additional to the capital cost of the equipment, an estimate of US$4.0 million has been included to 

cover initial site development costs. 

No mine sustaining capital was included for overhaul costs and fleet replacement, as the considered 

equipment should last through the entire life of the project, which is a short term of five years. 

 Process Capital Costs 19.2.2

Marlin Gold prepared capital cost estimates for the process infrastructure and these are presented in 

Table 19.2.2.1.  Most of the process capital cost estimate comes from preliminary budgetary 

quotations.  The adopted exchange rate is Pesos $12.50 for every US$1.00.

No sustaining capital has been included in the capital cost estimate, as SRK expects the initial 

capital investment to be sufficient for the short five year life of the project.  It should be noted that the 

entire heap leach pad for the life of the project will be constructed as part of initial capital. 

 Owner's Capital Costs 19.2.3

A capital estimate to cover owner's item has been included in the overall project capital.  This capital 

should cover the revamp of existing office facilities at the site, installation of the water and power 

systems, initial stock of reagents and spare parts and costs associated with the engineering 

procurement and construction management.  Table 19.2.3.1 presents owner's capital cost 

investments. 

Table 19.2.3.1:  Owner's Costs (US$000s) 

Description Total Capital 
Water System Facility, Transformers and CFE Authorization $500 
Offices Revamp and Camp for 40 Employees $1,300 
Reagents and Spares $969 
Engineering $500 
Total  $3,269 

 

Costs associated with the water and power systems, offices and infrastructure and engineering 

procurement and management are ball park numbers that have been plugged in the model, this data 

has no backup quotes, but is supported by Marlin Gold professionals' experience with similar 

projects.  SRK has reviewed those estimates and is in agreement with them.  

The costs with initial fills and spare parts have considered as the operating costs of the first month of 

operation.  This estimate of cost has been included as working capital and amounts to 

US$2,588,848.

 Other Capital Costs 19.2.4

Mine closure costs haves been estimated as US$3.05 million, however, provision for US$1.8 million 

in salvage value results in a net closure cost of US$1.25 million (Table 19.2.4.1).

Cost with the Mexican Value Added Tax (IVA) has been included as one line item, corresponding to 

16% of the total estimate of capital.  The technical economic model considers that this tax will be 

recovered during the first year of operations. 

 Payback 19.2.5

The prepared economic evaluation indicates that payback will occur in the end of the second quarter 

of the third year of production.

 Basis for Operating Cost Estimates 19.3.1

Marlin Gold invited seven different companies to presents proposals to conduct the mine operations 

of Trinidad, these quotes were based on the mining plan prepared for the project.  Figure 19-1 

presents a graph comparing the quotes and a table with the yearly average costs.  Contractor 3's 

costs were selected to be included in the technical economic model.  The costs provided by the 

companies were exclusive of explosives, which were considered as an additional US$0.15/t-blasted.  

Overall the LoM mining cost is an average of US$1.35/t-moved.

Process operating costs have been estimated based on the following operation basis: 

 360 days of operation per year; 
 2 shifts per day; 
 12 hours per shift; 
 70% crushing plant availability; 
 1,546,551 t-RoM/year; and 
 Exchange rate of Pesos $12.50 to US$1.00. 

Process costs are based on either an assumption of consumption rate and unitary cost, or an 

assumption of a period total cost, either monthly or yearly, supported by experience of Marlin Gold 

with similar scale projects.  SRK has reviewed these operating costs and believes they are in line 

with the projects of this type and scale.  Tables 19.3.1.1 through 19.3.1.7 provide a detailed 

summary of process operating costs by category.

Marlin Gold has prepared an estimate of general and administration labor (G&A).  A total G&A cost 

of US$1.35 million is estimated during a typical year of operation.  The technical economic model 

has considered a typical year cost with G&A as US$1.5 million in order to allow for other undefined 

costs.  The starting and ending year G&A costs have been assumed to be US$1.0 million with the 

expectation that during these years of commissioning and decommissioning G&A labor costs will be 

reduced.  Table 19.3.1.9 presents the detail of the G&A labor cost calculation.

20 Economic Analysis (Item 22) 
The technical-economic results summarized in this section are based upon work performed by Marlin 

Gold's engineers and consultants; these have been prepared on an annual basis.  The economic 

model was developed by SRK.  All costs are in Q4 2011 US constant dollars. 

The project under analysis is a brown field gold deposit, where the results were derived from a base 

case with an average production rate around 35,000 t/d and a maximum production rate of around 

45,600 t/d, including RoM and waste movement.  Life of mine stripping ratio is roughly 7.2 and 

average gold grade of about 1.12 ppm.  Gold recovery in the model has been considered as a flat 

rate of 70%, where the process returns the gold deposited in the heap leach within the same 

modeled period. 

Readers are cautioned that this analysis is only a preliminary assessment based on conceptual mine 

plans and process flowsheets.  There is no certainty that this PEA will be realized.  Since there is no 

estimate of proven or probable reserves for the Project, this assessment only includes cash flow 

forecasts on an annual basis for the mineral resource estimated as of January 2013. 

20.1 Principal Assumptions 
The economic model is pre-tax and assumes 100% equity to provide a clear picture of the technical 

merits of the project.  Assumptions used are discussed in detail throughout this report and are 

summarized in Table 20.1.1. 

Table 20.1.1:  Technical Economic Model Parameters 

Model Parameter Technical Input 
General Assumptions  
 Pre-Production Period 1 year 
 Mine Life 5 years 
 Operating Days per year 360 days/yr 
 Production Rate (avg.) 35,000 t/d 

Market  
 Discount Rate 8% 
 Gold Price (avg.) US$1,500/Au-oz 
Royalty  
 Private Royalty 1% of NSR starting from third year of production 

 

This study assumes one year of pre-production required to install process infrastructure, including 

crushing system and heap leach and ponds and ADR plant.  The mine will have an estimated life of 

5 years, given the resources described in this report and the assumed 35,000 t/d production rate.   

Revenue from gold sales are based upon a fixed US$1,500/Au-oz, including the calculation of the 

respective NSR, considering that the project would be selling gold in a doré bar.  Transportation to 

the refinery and insurance charges have been considered.

20.2 Pre-Tax Cashflow Forecasts and Annual Production Forecasts 
The SRK LoM plan and economics are based on the following: 

 A fixed US$1,500/Au-oz and an average NSR of US$1,494/Au-oz.;   
 Sales price and Opex refer to a gold doré production; 
 Indicated and inferred resources, and a preliminary mining studies; 
 A mine life of 5 years, at an average designed rate of 35,000 t/d;   
 An overall average metallurgical gold recovery of 70%; 
 A cash operating cost of US$753 Au-oz;  
 Initial capital costs of US$27.9 million and total capital costs of US$25.5 million dollars.  The 

difference between initial and total capital is the recovery of an added value tax charged by 

the Mexican government (IVA); 

 Capital costs include an estimate of US$3.05 million dollars for closure costs and a salvage 
value of US$1.8 million; and 

 Sustaining capital has not been considered, due to the short life of the project. 

The cashflow model is included as Appendix B. 

The base case economic analysis results, shown in Table 20.2.1, indicate a pre-tax net present 

value of US$79 million at an 8% discount rate with an IRR of 53%.

SRK has prepared sensitivity analyses of this base result for key economic parameters, these are 

shown in Table 20.1.1 and Figure 20-1.  This analysis suggests that the project is most sensitive to 

market gold price.  Operating costs are considerably more sensitive than capital costs.

20.4 Taxes, Royalties and Other Interests 
Royalties 

A signed agreement between Marlin Gold and the party currently holding the royalties related to the 

area indicates the following. 

The parties recognize that the project area is under a NSR Royalty, which shall be granted once the 

capital investment required has been recovered or commercial production has been carried out for 

two years, whichever occurs first: 

 0.5% (zero point five percent) if the per ounce price of gold (Au) is below US$400 (four 
hundred and 00/100 Dollars) legal currency of the United States of America; and 

 If the per ounce price of gold (Au) is above US$400, 1% royalty. 

The technical economic model includes a 1% NSR Royalty starting from the third year of production, 

considering that cash flow does not foresee a return of the investment before the end of the second 

year of production. 

Marlin Gold also has the option of purchasing the royalty at any time.  Each 0.5% of NSR Royalty for 

the amount of US$1,000,000 or its equivalent in Mexican currency on the date of payment, according 

to the exchange rate given by Banco de México as applicable for payment of obligations contracted

which the payment in question must be made, adding the IVA corresponding to each payment. 

20.5 Tax Depreciation and Amortization of Deferred Costs  
Fixed asset costs and other deferred costs may be deducted via tax depreciation and amortization. 

Tax depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis and the rate varies depending on the type of 

asset. The depreciation rate for mining equipment and machinery is 12%.  

For the determination of post-tax NPV calculations, the following has been applied: 

 Legislated taxes rates are different for each year and range from 30% to 28%; and 
 Capital assets are depreciated using a straight line rate of 12% 8.3 years. 

20.6 Post Tax Results  
The SRK LoM plan and economics are based on the following: 

 Capital costs of US$25.5 million dollars are applicable for a depreciation schedule; 
 The depreciation model adopted is a straight line rate of 12%; and 
 Effective income tax rate varies between 28% and a 30%. 

The post-tax economic analysis results indicate a net present value of US$53.4 million, based on an 

8% discount rate, and an IRR of 43%.

The Taunus and Colinas resource areas lie within the [61,602.26 ha] Trinidad concession of Marlin 

Gold, part of the El Rosario mining district.  Veins in the district have been exploited since pre-

colonial times, but only the Taunus pit and the nearby Plomosas mine at La Rastra have recent 

recorded production.  Production from La Rastra occurred at a rate of 600t/d, mining 98,162t in 2000, 

after which mining was suspended. 

Grupo Mexico S.A. de C.V. reported a non NI 43-101 compliant mineral reserve estimate 

(http://www.secinfo.com/d11MXs.2efw.htm) postdating mine closure (Table 21.1).

23 Interpretation and Conclusions (Item 25) 

23.1 Mining Conclusions 
Mining operations at Taunus are sensitive to the geometry of the orebody and the ability to phase the 

operation based on mining width.  This suggests the strategic directives of Marlin Gold will heavily 

influence the size, stripping profile and feed delivery possible in any given period.  Mining will utilize 

contractor operations utilizing standard mining equipment under the direction of Marlin Gold mine 

staff.  Precise pit slope excavation and ability to manage water will be important to liberate high 

grade heap leach material found at the pit bottom as the ability re-excavate a pushback will be cost 

prohibitive if a mistake is made.  The mine plan calls for an average 37 kt/d operation with a 

reference mining cost of $1.40/t over a five year mine life. 

23.2 Metallurgy and Process Conclusions 
An average gold recovery of about 70% and an average silver recover of about 23% is estimated 

based on the closed-cycle testwork presented in this report.  These recovery estimates include a 5% 

reduction in recovery to account for leach inefficiencies normally encountered in a commercial heap 

leach operation. 

It is very likely that material from the Taunus pit will present percolation issues during multi-lift heap 

leach operation.  Additional studies will need to be conducted during the next phase of study to more 

fully evaluate agglomeration strategies and process options.   

23.3 Other Relevant Information 
The comparison between closely spaced RC and core drilling shows a tendency for the gold assays 

in the core to be statistically higher than those in corresponding RC holes.  This is especially true in 

the Bottom domain.  The recent sonic drilling program has shown a similar relationship between core 

and sonic drill results, with the sonic results somewhat lower than corresponding core results.

24 Recommendations (Item 26) 

24.1 Recommended Work Programs 
Exploration and Resource 

The following recommendations provide a framework for future drilling and improved geology and 

resource models: 

 Additional in-situ specific gravity testing should be undertaken to further confirm specific gravity 
determinations from drill core.  Once this has been established, it might be possible to do the 

estimation of block specific gravity from nearby data.  

 It appears that sonic drilling returned quite similar results to diamond drilling.  Considering that 
the sonic drilling is much more expensive, future drill campaigns should potentially be based on 

a combination of large diameter core holes and sonic drill holes.  

 Currently, the immediate area within and around the Taunus pit is fragmented in terms of the 
solid models.  Consider unifying the models so that at least the Bocas, Eldorado-HS and 

Red Zone are analyzed together and therefore form geologically sensible domains.  It may be 

possible to incorporate Taunus and Colinas data in the same way. 

 Further drilling should be considered where it would benefit the quality of the mineral resource, 
and where there is uncertainty regarding the volume and spatial location of key higher grade 

mineralization and where it will lead to a more unified mineralization model. 

 Complete analysis of silver, copper, arsenic, molybdenum and zinc for any further sampling of 
the mineralization and surrounding rocks so that these metals can be incorporated into the next 

resource estimate, to allow the assessment of potentially deleterious metals within the context of 

process metallurgy. 

Hydrogeology 

SRK notes that there is limited hydrogeology information at depth, and recommends initiation of 

hydrogeologic data collection studies in conjunction with the 2011 drilling program.  Given that the 

depth of the current resource pit extends approximately 175 m below the current pit, a better 

understanding of hydrogeologic conditions is warranted. 

SRK has recommended an initial data collection and analysis program as outlined below. 

Geotechnical 

Given the highly variable rock mass properties observed in both core and sonic drilled material, SRK 

recommends initiation of lab test work and geotechnical logging/mapping to adequately assess rock 

mass properties for input for pit design.  SRK has recommended a program and budget as outlined 

below. 

The objective of this program would be to assess geotechnical data to a level sufficient to support 

geotechnical mine design parameters required for substantial engineering design of the pit that will 

be reported in a public technical report. 

Field Investigation – Develop drilling and sampling program suitable for geotechnical and 

hydrogeological investigation at Taunus pit and shallow exploration at San Carlos pit.  We anticipate

drilling up to six (6) PQ-size diamond drill holes along planned pit walls in each region for 

characterization. 

 Drill coreholes in west and east highwall areas to characterize rock quality and obtain 
samples for strength testing; 

 Furnish geotechnical logging and support to driller; 
 Sample selection and packaging for shipping to laboratory for testing; 
 Teleview all 6 DDH holes and 5-6 open historic sonic/DDH holes and obtain fracture 

orientation data; 

 Obtain oriented core of fractures and assess orientation, frequency and spacing of dominant 
joint sets expected at depth; 

 Assess pre-mining in situ stress conditions from borehole conditions and, if necessary, 
conduct stress measurements to assess horizontal stress conditions; 

 Perform hydrogeologic pump testing and/or slug tests and collect data; and 
 Characterize the hydrogeology for seepage rates into the pit and need to dewatering 

program. 

Laboratory Testing – Laboratory rock testing for strength properties will include the following 

 Point load tests; 
 Unconfined compression tests; 
 Stress-strain deformation tests; 
 Triaxial compression tests; 
 Direct shear tests; 
 Brazilian tensile tests; and 
 Density tests. 

Data Analysis and Reporting – Limit equilibrium stability analyses of each rock region should be 

performed to demonstrate stability of the overall and inter-ramp slopes.  This analysis should include 

both static and dynamic analyses.  Other tasks include the following; 

 Develop 3-D structural/lithologic model and RMR block model that can be used to optimize 
the overall pit slope angles; 

 Complete a seismic hazard assessment to assess likely ground motion that pit walls and 
surface structures will be exposed to for the dynamic stability; and  

 Assess pit slope stability along critical orientations of the pit using numerical stress analysis 
methods. 

Topography Survey 

A review of the currently available topography shows minor discrepancies as related to drillhole 

collar locations and post-historical mining topography.  SRK has recommended a program and 

budget as outlined below. 

Metallurgy and Process Test Work 

Additional agglomeration studies and full-height column leach tests should be conducted during the 

next phase of study.  In addition, compacted permeability tests should be conducted to assess 

solution percolation rates at sequentially higher loadings designed to simulate conditions in a multi-

lift heap leach operation.

BCS/MLM Trinidad_NI 43-101_PEA_343200.010_029_Amended_MLM February 1, 2013 

Mining 

Detailed contractor evaluations based on a monthly schedule (Including predicted cycle time and 

haul distances) will be vital to optimize the periodic mining cost as the pit deepens. 

The use of a mixed fleet for stripping and detailed heap material excavation should be looked at to 

reduce ramp widths at the pit bottom 

The current PEA pit is not limited to arroyo or process plant buffer widths.  When the selection of 

future pit sizes are determined, these widths should be included. 

The PEA pit comprises of a phase 1 and phase 2 pit extraction, serious evaluation should be made 

to only include phase 1 extraction but break it up into minimum mining widths that will improve the 

strip profile.  Including the phase 2 pit forces higher stripping ratios in the early years for only 

incremental gains in NPV. 

The amount of free-dig versus drill and blast should be evaluated, and if significant, a move away 

from front end loader to excavators should be considered.  Particularly, if the breakout force of the 

excavator negates the need for blasting. 

Environmental (Geochemistry) 

Geochemistry testwork on the waste rock, spent heap material and post-closure wall rock is currently 

limited and needs to be expanded to include longer-term kinetic testing to establish the potential for 

poor quality seepage from the waste piles and future pit lake.  Post-metallurgical testing of the spent 

heap material would provide a better understanding of the anticipated draindown chemistry and the 

need for long-term management.  Generation of a predictive geochemical model of the future pit lake 

would also be appropriate to determine to the need for possible post-closure water treatment. 

Project Costs and Financials 

Project capital costs seem fairly detailed for this level of study, including a number of quotes to back 

up the included costs.  The adopted mining cost is also backed up by third party preliminary 

quotations.  SRK recommends that Marlin Gold address the following: 

 Assess the correct mass and grade of existing spent heap material.  Its movement is 
currently included in the costs, but the eventual recovery of its gold content is not considered 

as a revenue generator; 

 Analyze the resources for silver, as its recovery could further improve project results; and 
 A more detailed assessment of the beneficiation costs will be required in future studies. 

 Future Proposed Expenditure Cost to Develop a Feasibility Study 24.1.1

SRK anticipates that the recommended work program will cost US$1.75 million.  The details of this 

estimate are provided in Table 24.1.1.1.

26 Glossary 

26.1 Mineral Resources 
The mineral resources and mineral reserves have been classified according to the "CIM Standards 

on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines" (November 27, 2010).  

Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the Reserves 

have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated Resources as 

defined below.   

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized organic 

material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has 

reasonable prospects for economic extraction.  The location, quantity, grade, geological 

characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 

specific geological evidence and knowledge.   

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 

quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 

assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited 

information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, 

trenches, pits, workings and drillholes. 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 

sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine 

planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed 

and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from 

locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for 

geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape, physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated 

with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, 

to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate 

is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through 

appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that 

are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 

26.2 Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource 

demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 

information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that 

demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral Reserve 

includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.   

A 'Probable Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 

circumstances a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility

Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, 

economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 

extraction can be justified.   

A 'Proven Mineral Reserve' is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource 

demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate 

information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 

demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.

CERTIFICATE OF QUALIFIED PERSON 
 

I, Mark Willow, M.S., C.E.M., RM-SME, do hereby certify that:

Preliminary Economic Assessment, Trinidad/Taunus Project, Sinaloa, Mexico" with an Effective Date of 
June 1, 2012 and a 2nd Amended Report Date of February 1, 2013 (the "Technical Report"). 

3. I graduated with Bachelor's degree in Fisheries and Wildlife Management from the University of Missouri 
in 1987 and a Master's degree in Environmental Science and Engineering from the Colorado School of 
Mines in 1995. I have worked as Biologist/Environmental Scientist for a total of 18 years since my 
graduation from university. My relevant experience includes environmental due diligence/competent 
persons evaluations of developmental phase and operational phase mines through the world, including 
small gold mining projects in Panama, Senegal, Peru and Colombia; open pit and underground coal 
mines in Russia; several large copper mines and processing facilities in Mexico; and a mine/coking 
operation in China. My Project Manager experience includes several site characterization and mine 
closure projects. I work closely with the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management on 
several permitting and mine closure projects to develop uniquely successful and cost effective closure 
alternatives for the abandoned mining operations. Finally, I draw upon this diverse background for 
knowledge and experience as a human health and ecological risk assessor with respect to potential 
environmental impacts associated with operating and closing mining properties, and have experienced in 
the development of Preliminary Remediation Goals and hazard/risk calculations for site remedial action 
plans under CERCLA activities according to current U.S. EPA risk assessment guidance. I am a Certified 
Environmental Manager (CEM) in the State of Nevada (#1832) in accordance with Nevada 
Administrative Code NAC 459.970 through 459.9729. I am a Registered Member of the Society for 
Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration. Before any person consults for a fee in matters concerning: the 
management of hazardous waste; the investigation of a release or potential release of a hazardous 
substance; the sampling of any media to determine the release of a hazardous substance; the response 
to a release or cleanup of a hazardous substance; or the remediation soil or water contaminated with a 
hazardous substance, they must be certified by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, Bureau of 
Corrective Action.  

4. I have read the definition of "qualified person" set out in National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) and 
certify that by reason of my education, affiliation with a professional association (as defined in NI 43-101)
