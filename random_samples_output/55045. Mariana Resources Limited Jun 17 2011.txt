1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 

Mine Development Associates ("MDA") has been engaged by Mariana Resources Ltd. ("Mariana") to 

prepare a technical report for the Las Calandrias project, Argentina.  The Las Calandrias property is an 

early-stage exploration property with a discovery and is a property of merit.  Earlier names for the Las 

Calandrias project were Tongoril, Pampa del Tongoril, and Dos Calandrias.  There are currently two 

principal areas being explored by Mariana on the Las Calandrias property – the Las Calandrias zone and 

the El Nido complex.  

 

This report has been prepared in compliance with the disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in 

the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"), Companion Policy 

43-101CP, and Form 43-101F1. 

 

1.1 Location and Ownership 
 

The Las Calandrias property is located in the eastern part of Santa Cruz province in southern Argentina, 

approximately 210km southwest of Comodoro Rivadavia.  The property consists of the Pampa del 

Tongoril II cateo, which was registered in June 2008 and which grants the right to explore for a four-

year primary term.  The cateo consists of 5,560ha at the present time and is owned 100% by Mariana.  

There is no associated annual holding cost.  Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd. has a right of first offer 

over Mariana's portfolio of wholly owned properties and applications in Santa Cruz province, 

Argentina, for a two-year period that expires on November 12, 2010. 

 

The surface at Las Calandrias is part of the approximately 24,430 hectares La Calandria estancia.  On 

December 16, 2009, Mariana signed a two-year purchase option agreement for the estancia. 

 

1.2 History and Exploration 
 

Other than a few indications of previous rock-chip sampling by unknown explorers, there has been no 

known previous exploration on the Las Calandrias property.  Through a study of satellite imagery and 

subsequent follow up on the ground, Mariana discovered quartz-sulfide veins and breccias over two 

broad zones about 600m apart and staked the cateo in April 2008.  High-grade gold vein-style 

mineralization was first discovered at Calandria Norte, followed by discovery of silver- and gold-rich 

breccias at Calandria Sur. 

 

Since 2008, Mariana has undertaken rock-chip sampling, coarse-fraction ("lag") soil sampling, 

diamond-saw channel sampling from 21 shallow trenches, detailed mapping, geophysical surveying, and 

drilling on the property.  Since September 2009, Mariana has drilled 53 core holes totaling 5,963m as of

June 30, 2010.  Of those, two were drilled at El Nido Este; five, at El Nido Norte; and the remaining 

holes were drilled at Calandria Sur and Calandria Norte. 

 

1.3 Geology and Mineralization 
 

The Las Calandrias property is located in the east-central part of the Deseado Massif, a 60,000km
2
 rigid 

crustal block in southern Argentina bounded to the north by the Río Deseado, to the south by the Río 

Chico, to the east by the Atlantic coast, and to the west by the Andean Cordillera.   

 

The basement of the Deseado Massif consists of Cambrian metasedimentary rocks intruded by 

granitoids and tonalities.   These are overlain by Permo-Triassic and Triassic continental sedimentary 

rocks.  The Massif is dominated by extensive Jurassic volcanic and intrusive rocks, in which older 

andesitic and basaltic units are overlain by rhyolites, ignimbrites, and volcaniclastic rocks.  Cretaceous 

lake beds overlain by Tertiary and Quaternary alkali basalts partly cover the Jurassic volcanic plateau.  

One of the most striking features of the Patagonian stratigraphy is that the Permian, Mesozoic, and 

Cenozoic volcanic-sedimentary sequence is roughly horizontal, disrupted primarily by north- and 

northwest-trending extensional structures.  The Deseado Massif hosts numerous low-sulfidation, 

epithermal, precious-metal quartz vein and vein-breccia deposits that appear to have closely followed 

the Jurassic acid volcanism. 

 

The Las Calandrias property is dominated by the Jurassic volcanic units.  In the vicinity of Calandria 

Norte, Calandria Sur, and the El Nido zone, rhyolite domes, ignimbrites and tuffs, and lacustrine 

sedimentary rocks predominate.   Calandria Sur, the best-explored target to date, is a northwest-trending 

rhyolite dome that flattens at depth and steepens on the northeastern margin.  Low-grade gold 

mineralization occurs as quartz-sulfide stockwork veining in vein-breccia zones within the rhyolite 

dome.  Strong silicification and kaolinite alteration are developed within the dome.  Sulfides are mainly 

pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite, and acanthite. The best intercept as of June 30, 2010 was in hole CSD23, 

which encountered 69.5m of 2.1 g Au/t and 39 g Ag/t from 47m, including 22m of 4.3 g Au/t and 78 g 

Ag/t from 81m.  The mineralized zone at Calandria Sur extends over an area of 400m by 200m to depths 

exceeding 100m and is open to the southwest. 

 

Calandria Norte is a circular rhyolite dome that intrudes lapilli tuff.   Northwest- and northeast-trending 

veins and vein-breccia mineralization occur on the eastern side of the dome and contrast to the more 

widely silicified breccias at Calandria Sur.  Drilling at Calandria Norte has identified a 3m-wide sulfide-

rich silicified structure 100m below surface.  Two holes drilled in 2010 70m apart and along strike 

intersected wide zones of marcasite-pyrite veining up to 125m down hole in strongly silicified rocks in 

the hanging wall of this structure.  As of May 26, 2010, the best intersections of these two holes were: 

 Hole CND45 with 4.0m of 76g Au/t and 70g Ag/t from 92.5m 

 Hole CND46 with 4.5m of 102g Au/t and 72g Ag/t from 81.5m. 
Mineralization at Calandria Norte is in a breccia zone of marcasite/pyrite with interstitial electrum.  The 

breccia is associated with a 60 to 100m-wide envelope of stockwork marcasite and quartz veining.   

 

The El Nido zone, lying west and northwest of the domes of Calandria Sur and Calandria Norte, appears 

to consist of several coalescing rhyolite domes aligned on a northeast-trending structure that crosses the 

major regional northwest structural trend of the area.  Two holes have been drilled into the Nido Este 

target, intersecting pyrite-marcasite veinlets and wide zones of disseminated pyrite and marcasite in the

rhyolite dome, but neither hole found significant gold and silver values.  Drilling on the Nido Norte 

target has found sulfide-rich quartz veins, stockworks, breccias, and sulfide disseminations. 

 

1.4 Metallurgical Testing and Mineral Processing 
 

Preliminary metallurgical test work on samples from Calandria Sur is currently being conducted by 

Metcon Laboratories in Australia. 

   

1.5 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 

The Las Calandrias property is an early-stage exploration property with a discovery of significant gold-

silver mineralization at the surface and in drill core in a favorable geologic setting.  From a review of the 

data and field examination, it is concluded that Mariana has performed technical work that meets or 

exceeds industry standards.  The drilling to date at Calandria Sur indicates three dimensional continuity 

of gold mineralization and it is concluded that the Las Calandrias property is a property of merit and 

warrants further work, including additional drilling to advance the project.   

 

Grades of mineralization obtained by MDA from six trench samples and eight half-core samples support 

both the general tenor of grades reported by Mariana and the presence of mineralization. 

 

About 10,000m of core drilling at an estimated cost of $2.2 million is proposed through January 2011, in 

addition to lag/rock sampling, mapping, and additional geophysical surveying.

4.1 Location 
 

The Las Calandrias property is located in the eastern part of Santa Cruz province in southern Argentina, 

approximately 210km southwest of Comodoro Rivadavia (population ~140,000) (Figure 4.1).  The 

center of the project lies at approximately 47° 36' 21"South and 67° 29' 20"West. 

 

All maps and sections in this report use UTM coordinates in meters, Zone 19, WGS 84 Datum. 

 

There are currently two principal areas being explored by Mariana on the Las Calandrias property (see 

Figure 7.2).  One is the Las Calandrias zone that includes the Calandria Sur and the Calandria Norte 

targets.  The second is the El Nido complex, which includes the El Nido Sur, El Nido Norte, El Nido 

Este, El Nido Oeste, and El Nido Centro targets. 
 

4.2 Land Area 
 

In April 2008, Mariana applied for the Pampa del Tongoril II exploration permit (Dossier: 

407963/MMA/08), which comprises the Las Calandrias property.  The application was provisionally 

registered in June 2008 and is in the process of being formally granted.   

 

An "exploration permit" or "cateo" grants the right to explore for a period of time according to the size 

of the area granted by the Mining Authority. Regarding the duration of the cateo, the Mining Code 

states:  "ARTICLE 30 - An exploration permit covering ONE (1) measurement unit, shall be granted a 

term of one hundred and fifty (150) days. Exploration permits shall be extended for another fifty (50) 

days per each increased measurement unit.  After three hundred (300) days of such term have elapsed, 

an area equal to half an area larger than four (4) measurement units shall be discounted. Whenever 

seven hundred (700) days of such term have elapsed, an area equal to half the remaining area, as 

reduced above, shall be discounted, excluding, also, the foregoing four (4) measurement units. For these 

purposes, the permit holder shall file an application to release such an area before any such term as 

applicable is due. This application shall show the coordinates of every vertex of the area thus held. Non-

filing in due time of this application shall cause the mining authorities, at the request of the mining 

cadastral register office, to proceed under the foregoing paragraph, to release any such areas as 

appropriate at its own discretion, and to demand the exploration permit holder to pay a penalty in the 

amount of the royalty which has been previously paid". 

 

At any time, the holder may convert the cateo into a mineral discovery ("Manifestación de 

Descubrimiento").

September 28, 2010   

The Pampa del Tongoril II cateo consists of 5,560ha at the present time and is owned 100% by Mariana.  

At the time of application, Mariana paid 5,200 Argentine pesos (approximately US$1,333) for the cateo; 

there is no associated annual holding cost.  Argentine mining law does not require surveying of cateos or 

exploration permits, and the Pampa del Tongoril II cateo has not been surveyed; the law does require 

surveying for exploitation license. 

 

The surface at Las Calandrias is part of the approximately 24,430 hectares "La Calandria" farm 

("estancia").  Mariana has an option-to-purchase agreement with the owner of the estancia (Section 

4.3). 

 

Figure 4.2 shows the Pampa del Tongoril II cateo that comprises the Las Calandrias property and the La 

Calandria estancia.  As shown on Figure 4.2 and described in Section 15.0, the Calandria Sur dome 

extends southward off of the Pampa del Tongoril II cateo onto a cateo held by another party.

4.3 Agreements and Encumbrances 
 

At this time, the Pampa del Tongoril II cateo has no associated royalty or annual holding cost because it 

is a 100%-owned exploration permit.  At such time as the cateo is converted to an exploitation license, 

there will be an annual holding cost and royalty costs paid to the government. 

 

Pampa del Tongoril II (as well as Mariana's other wholly owned properties in Santa Cruz) is subject to a 

Collateral Agreement with Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd. ("Hochschild"), as part of a private 

placement made by Hochschild in Mariana in November 2008 (see news release of November 17, 2008, 

on Mariana's website).  Hochschild has a right of first offer over Mariana's current portfolio of wholly-

owned properties and applications in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, which includes Las Calandrias. 

The right of first offer applies for a two year period from the date of signing of the collateral agreement 

of November 12, 2008.  This provision requires that Hochschild will be approached first in the event 

Mariana seeks a JV partner or wishes to sell any of the wholly owned properties. 

 

Most of the surface of the property is part of the La Calandria estancia.  On December 16, 2009, 

Mariana executed a purchase option agreement for the estancia.  The duration of the agreement is for 24 

months from December 1, 2009 to December 1, 2011, and the terms of the agreement are reasonable. 

 

4.4 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 
 

According to Mariana (Rodriguez, 2009), the Las Calandrias property has no known environmental 

liabilities or required mitigation measures. 

 

Mariana filed an Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA"), which was approved in September 2009.  

This covers expected exploration work.  The EIA must be updated biannually or when the foreseen 

program of activities concludes, whichever happens first.

5.0 ACCESS, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

5.1 Access 
 

The Las Calandrias project is located about 210km southwest of the coastal city of Comodoro 

Rivadavia.  The port of Caleta Olivia is 140km north-northeast of the property.  Access to the project is 

via paved national road N3 from Comodoro and then by 4km of good gravel road to the Las Calandrias 

estancia.  The project is 11km beyond the estancia to the west of the main estancia building (casco de 

estancia) via gravel and graded dirt road.  Travel time from Comodoro to the property by car is about 

three hours. 

 

5.2 Climate 
 

Las Calandrias lies in the arid to semi-arid Patagonian region of southern Argentina.  As described by 

Rodriguez (2009), the climate in the region is cool, dry, and windy.  Temperatures range from 25°C in 

the summer to -5°C in the winter (late June to the end of August).  The average annual rainfall is about 

200mm.  There is only occasional light snow in winter.  Wind in this region averages 26 to 39km per 

hour and is persistent.  

 

Although inclement weather might hamper exploration for brief periods, exploration and mining can be 

conducted year-round on the property. 

 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
 

The Las Calandrias project area is sparsely populated. Isolated sheep-grazing farms (estancias) have 

been largely abandoned since the early 1990s, when deposits of ash from the eruption of a volcano in 

Chile severely disrupted the industry.  The ash also covered areas of surface mineralization, making 

geochemical prospecting difficult (Mariana uses lag sampling, in which coarse particles in the range 2.0 

to 6.0mm are screened on site from the unconsolidated surface material). 

 

The town of Caleta Olivia is 140km north-northeast of Las Calandrias on paved national road 

N3.  Caleta Olivia has a population of 36,000 and is an active oil and gas field center with supporting 

services including transport, trucking, and oil-field rigs.  The city of Comodoro Rivadavia is 70km north 

of Caleta Olivia and about 210km north of Las Calandrias on N3.  Comodoro Rivadavia has a 

population of 140,000 and is also an oil industry center with a regional airport having daily flights to 

Buenos Aires.  Both of these cities can provide services for exploration and mining.  Fitz Roy and 

Jaramillo are small villages 60km north of Las Calandrias.   The population of each village is about 250 

people, and although the two villages are about 20km apart, they are under the same local government. 

Mariana has undertaken collaborative efforts with these villages and is organizing a provider chain in 

order to improve the local service capacity. As an example, Mariana has contracted with a local 

company to provide camp and food services.   

 

The nearest power line, 132KV, is about 70km to the north.  The Las Calandrias property is located 

10km west of one of the principal gas pipelines in Argentina. The 3,756 km, 30in.-diameter General San

Martin Gas Pipeline begins in Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of Argentina, crosses the Strait of 

Magellan, and ends near the city of La Plata. 

 

Water needed for drilling at Las Calandrias was obtained from a collection system that sourced several 

small seeps and shallow lakes that intermittently contain water from runoff.  Most of the basins are dry 

lakes with internal drainage.  A hydrogeologic study for Mariana (Giaccardi and Aquilera, 2010) 

measured the water level at depths of 51 to 64.9m in three of 16 drill holes in Calandria Sur.  The 13 

holes not measured were caved above the water depth.  Results of water analyses from the three drill 

holes exceeded levels of fluorine allowed for drinking water, and one of the holes had high chlorine 

values.  The preliminary hydrogeologic study by Giacarrdi and Aquilera was unable to develop a 

hydrogeologic model due to the limited data available.  Further hydrogeologic studies would be required 

in order to develop a hydrogeologic model. 

 

5.4 Physiography 
 

The project lies on the low-lying Patagonian plains of southern Argentina.  The terrain in the project 

area has subdued relief (Figure 5.1) and lies at altitude between 130 and 200 masl.  There are numerous 

scattered dry-lake basins (playas) that intermittently hold water from rainfall runoff.  Vegetation is 

sparse.

6.0 HISTORY 
 

6.1 Exploration History  
 

There has been no known previous exploration at Calandria Norte and Calandria Sur prior to that of 

Mariana.  Elsewhere on the Las Calandrias property, there are a few indications of previous rock-chip 

sampling, but it is not known which company or companies conducted this exploration. 

 

Through a study of satellite imagery and subsequent follow up on the ground, Mariana discovered 

quartz-sulfide vein/breccias over two broad zones about 600m apart and staked the cateo in April 2008.  

High-grade gold vein-style mineralization was first discovered at Calandria Norte, followed by 

discovery of silver- and gold-rich breccias at Calandria Sur (Rodriguez et al., 2010).      

 

Exploration by Mariana is described in Section 10.0. 

 

6.2 Historic Mineral Resource Estimates 
 

There is no evidence of previous mineral resource estimates having been made at Las Calandrias; 

indeed, as noted above, there is no known previous exploration beyond a few rock-chip samples for 

which there is no information.

7.0 GEOLOGIC SETTING 
 

The following discussion of the geologic setting of Las Calandrias is largely taken from Rodriguez 

(2009) with additional information as cited. 

 

7.1 Regional Geology 
 

The Las Calandrias property is located in the east-central part of the Deseado Massif, a 60,000km
2
 rigid 

crustal block in southern Argentina bounded to the north by the Río Deseado, to the south by the Río 

Chico, to the east by the Atlantic coast, and to the west by the Andean Cordillera.   

 

The basement of the Deseado Massif consists of Cambrian metasedimentary rocks (La Modesta 

Formation) that were intruded by granitoids and tonalities.  Fluvial Permo-Triassic sequences of the La 

Juanita and La Golondrina formations unconformably overly the basement rocks; they were deposited in 

north- to northwest-trending rift basins that formed along older reactivated basement structures 

(Fernandez, 2010).   The fluvial units are overlain by continental Triassic sedimentary rocks (arkosic 

sandstones, shales, conglomerates, and redbeds) of the El Tranquilo Formation (Fernandez, 2010).  

Deposition of the lower- to middle-Jurassic tuff of the Roca Blanca Formation in angular unconformity 

on the Triassic sedimentary rocks signaled initiation of extensive Jurassic volcanism on the Deseado 

Massif.  Andesitic and basaltic volcanic and intrusive rocks of the Bajo Pobre Formation were followed 

by the rhyolitic Bahia Laura Group, including at least 2km-thick rhyolitic and dacitic ignimbrites of the 

Chon Aike Formation and tuff, tuffites, and pelites of the La Matilde Formation.  Pankhurst et al. (2000) 

studied the ages of Jurassic volcanism in Patagonia using high-resolution SHRIMP U/Pb ages on 

zircons. They concluded that Jurassic volcanism occurred over more than 30 million years, with periods 

of peak activity at 188 to 178Ma, 172 to 162Ma and 157 to 153Ma. 

 

Cretaceous lake beds cover much of the Jurassic volcanic plateau.  Tertiary and Quaternary alkali basalts 

cut the older units and form volcanic cones and flood basalts. 

 

One of the most striking features of the Patagonian stratigraphy is that the Permian, Mesozoic, and 

Cenozoic volcanic-sedimentary sequence is roughly horizontal.  Jurassic horsts and grabens trending 

northwest cut the Paleozoic basement; northwest- and north-trending regional extensional structures 

appear to have controlled the locus of Jurassic magmatism and may also have controlled intrusion of 

Tertiary and Quaternary alkali basalts (Sanders, 2000).   

 

The Deseado Massif hosts numerous low-sulfidation, epithermal, precious-metal, quartz vein deposits 

that appear to have closely followed the Jurassic acid volcanism. 

 

Figure 7.1 is a simplified geologic map of the Deseado Massif.

7.2 Local Geology 
 

According to Hodder and White (2010), the portion of the Las Calandrias property in the vicinity of the 

current exploration targets is a window through ash flows of the Chon Aike Formation exposing felsic 

domes, interbedded gray-green tuff, lacustrine sedimentary rocks, and mafic rock of the Bajo Pobre 

Formation.  The ash flows appear to dip outward from the window, suggesting that the window may be 

exposing a geologic and paleo-topographic high.  Three irregularly shaped domes – Calandria Sur, 

Calandria Norte, and El Nido Este – occupy the central area of the window and appear to intrude the 

lacustrine sedimentary rocks and the tuff.  A fourth dome, or cluster of coalescing domes, called El Nido 

occupies the northwest portion of the window. 

 

Calandria Norte and Calandria Sur are hosted by two rhyolite domes that cut shallowly dipping, welded 

ignimbrites, probably part of the Chon Aike Formation (Sillitoe, 2009b); this suggests that while the 

domes may be exposed in a window through the Chon Aike Formation, at least some of the intrusive 

activity was contemporaneous with Chon Aike deposition.  The two domes are separated by only 400 to 

600m of the host ignimbrite.  Both are completely devitrified and are characterized, especially in their 

marginal parts, by well-developed spherulitic texture.  The dome cut by the Calandria Norte veins is 

distinguished by delicate, highly contorted flow foliation; the dome containing the hydrothermal 

breccia-hosted mineralization at Calandria Sur typically is non-banded and is largely composed of clast-

supported breccia (autobreccia) at the surface. 

 

Figure 7.2  shows the geology of the Las Calandrias property.

7.3 Project Geology 
 

The following information is taken from reports by Rodriguez (2009), Sillitoe (2009a), and Mariana's 

website (http://www.marianaresources.com/projects/argentina/argentina_las_calandrias.php as of July 

19, 2010).   

   

The Las Calandrias project includes the Calandria Sur and Calandria Norte Jurassic rhyolite dome 

complexes in the southeastern part of the project area and the recently discovered El Nido dome 

complex located to the west that includes prospects at El Nido Sur, El Nido Norte, El Nido Este, and El 

Nido Centro. 

  

7.3.1 La Calandria Zone 

The La Calandria mineralized zone is part of a rhyolite dome complex 3km by 3km in area that intrudes 

Mesozoic volcaniclastic rocks and breccias.  The La Calandria zone includes the Calandria Sur and

Calandria Norte domes (Figure 7.2) centered on an area 1.5km by 1.3km.  An early polymictic breccia, 

interpreted to be a phreatic or phreatomagmatic vent fill (Sillitoe, 2009a), crops out on the lower ground 

around the dome margins.  The rhyolite domes were emplaced into the breccia fill and exhibit flow 

banding and total devitrification.   

 

7.3.1.1 Calandria Sur 
 

The following information is taken from Sillitoe (2009b) and from Hodder and White (2010). 

 

Calandria Sur is the best-explored target to date.  Figure 7.3 shows the geology of Calandria Sur. It 

consists of a northwest-trending rhyolite dome that flattens at depth and steepens on the northeastern 

margin (Figure 7.4).  Broad zones of disseminated gold and silver cross the body of the dome in a 

northwest direction. 

 

Calandria Sur appears to consist of coalescing felsic domes (Hodder and White, 2010).  These domes 

reached the surface and became short lobe flows, leaving septa of ash-flows between domes and beneath 

lobes.   

 

The domes and lobe flows have a carapace of autoclastic crackle and jig-saw breccia a few meters thick, 

in which the clasts are generally finely flow banded and the rectangular clasts' long axes are parallel to 

the flow banding.  The clasts are interpreted as devitrified glass.  With depth, the flow-banded clasts 

give way in a few tens of meters to less abundant clasts of massive rhyolite.  Abundant and large 

spherulites and lithophysae fade downward to fewer and smaller ones as the rock becomes more 

massive. 

 

A simplified geological section across Calandria Sur comprises: 

1- The upper parts are spherulitic and partially brecciated (clast-supported breccias), typically from 

the surface to 45m in depth.  

2- A central part is composed of flow-banded rhyolite (in part, amygdaloidal). 

3- A dome breccia (peperite-like breccia) is close to the dome margin. 

4- A transition zone contains intercalated dome and volcaniclastic rocks. 

5- Finally there are volcaniclastics rocks and quartz-poor, lithic-rich (fiamme-rich) ignimbrites. 
 

Figure 7.3 shows the geology of the Calandria Sur dome, and Figure 7.4 is a cross section through the 

dome.

7.3.1.2 Calandria Norte 
 

The following information is taken from Hodder and White (2010). 

 

Outcrops at Calandria Norte appear to be of a single dome that intrudes accretionary lapilli tuff, either 

extending just into or overlain by ash flow.  Calandria Norte is considered distinct from Calandria Sur 

primarily because of intervening low ground in which there is no outcrop. The rock at Calandria Norte is 

a white, spherulitic, flow-banded devitrified and limonitic glass that is clay rich.  It is not significantly 

brecciated except for a one-meter interval that appears to be a late, silicified fault.  Microcrystalline to 

crystalline quartz in outcrop at Calandria Norte is mostly confined to structures that appear to dip gently 

into the dome.  This silica is a lower-temperature variety than that observed at Calandria Sur. 

 

Figure 7.5 shows the geology of Calandria Norte, and Figure 7.6 is a cross section through the dome.

(Section B-B' as shown on Figure 7.5) 

 

 
 

 

7.3.2 El Nido Zone 

The following is from Hodder and White (2010) and from the Mariana website. 

 

El Nido appears to consist of several coalescing rhyolite domes aligned on a northeast-trending structure 

that crosses the major regional northwest structural trend of the area (Figure 7.2).  The domes form a 

northeast-trending belt that is 3.5km by 2.5km in area and lies west and northwest of the Calandria Sur 

and Calandria Norte domes.  The El Nido domes appear to be rather passively emplaced into tuff and 

overlying ash flows. 

 

El Nido has carapace autobreccias of flow-banded devitrified glass overlying massive coherent rhyolite.  

The rock is not spherulitic in the north but is in the south.  Planar quartz veins follow cooling joints 

through the breccia.  Surface exposures are thoroughly oxidized and have only trace amounts of precious 

metals.  Figure 7.7 shows a rhyolite flow breccia from El Nido Sur.

Figure 7.7  Rhyolite Flow Breccia from El Nido Sur 

 

 
 

 

El Nido Este is the most central dome, situated between Calandria Sur and El Nido.  It is probably the 

stratigraphically highest dome in the district (Hodder and White, 2010).  In outcrop, it is the smallest and 

most circular in shape.  El Nido Este intrudes thinly laminated lacustrine sedimentary rock and crystal-

rich ash flows.  The lacustrine beds contain authigenic marcasite that Hodder and White (2010) interpret 

as sedimentary rather than hydrothermal. 

 

This dome has a very spherulitic margin surrounding a massive cryptocrystalline rhyolite with small 

quartz eyes.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES IN THE DESEADO MASSIF 
 

The Deseado Massif hosts numerous low-sulfidation, epithermal, precious-metal quartz vein and vein-

breccia deposits, of which the Las Calandrias deposits are examples.  The deposits accompanied Jurassic 

magmatism and extension of the Deseado Massif.  The Deseado Massif is becoming a significant gold-

silver mining province following the discovery and development of the Cerro Vanguardia gold mine in 

the early 1990s.  The region hosts over thirty gold-silver mineralized areas, including four producing 

mines: 

  

 Cerro Vanguardia (operated by AngloGold Ashanti-Formicruz);  

 Mina Martha (Coeur /d Alene Mining Co.);  

 San Jose (Hochschild-Minera Andes); and  

 Manantial Espejo (Pan American Silver). 
 

In addition there are seven advanced-stage exploration- to feasibility-stage deposits: 

 

 Don Nicolas (Hidefield / Minera IRL);  

 Cerro Negro (Andean Resources);  

 Cerro Morro (Extorre-Fomicruz);  

 Pinguino (Argentex);  

 Lomada de Levia (Patagonia Gold);  

 Cap Oeste (Patagonia Gold); and  

 La Josefina (Hunt Mining/Cerro Cazador). 
 

Although the Deseado Massif deposits are considered to be of a similar geologic type, they differ in 

significant aspects, including economic metal content. For example, Cerro Vanguardia is gold-

dominated (by value) deposit with a Ag:Au ratio of  9:1, whereas Mina Martha is silver-dominated with 

a Ag:Au ratio of 1000, and Pinguino has a Ag:Au ratio of 128 with elevated base metals of Zn, Pb, and 

In (From company 43-101 reports and news releases of reported resources).  This variation in metal 

signature may be due to vertical level of deposit formation or simply to differing metallogenic sub-

provinces. 

 

Las Calandrias is gold-dominated (by value) with a Ag:Au ratio that averages 20 at Calandria Sur and 5 

at Calandria Norte and with  a relatively low base-metal content.  Mineralization at Las Calandrias is not 

restricted to sharp-walled quartz veins but occurs also as disseminations in wall rock and in chalcedonic 

hydrothermal breccia filling.  Some of the mineralized zones in drill-hole intercepts appear to correlate 

as roughly sub-horizontal zones rather than steeply dipping veins.  These geologic features are favorable 

for bulk-tonnage deposits.  Las Calandrias mineralization is related to certain rhyolite-dome complexes 

that may exhibit feeder zones.  Although the deposits contain locally abundant sulfides (pyrite-

marcasite), they are dominantly a low-sulfidation epithermal system.

9.0 MINERALIZATION 
 

The following information has largely been taken from reports by Rodriguez (2009), Rodriguez et al. 

(2009, 2010), Sillitoe (2009a), and news releases on Mariana's website. 

 

The mineralization on the Las Calandrias property appears to be of low-sulfidation epithermal type.  

Mariana has identified several occurrences of surface gold hosted by silicified structures and vein 

breccias, of which the most promising are located in the southeastern part of the property.  High-grade 

gold and silver veins and breccias are closely related to subaerial rhyolite flow domes that were 

emplaced at the junction of northwest- and northeast-trending fractures. 

 

Calandria Sur, a poorly exposed, northwest-trending mineralized zone 700m in length and up to 150m 

wide, consists of quartz-sulfide stockwork veining.  Rock-chip samples taken in 2008 returned 

anomalous gold and silver assays.  Calandria Norte, located about 600m to the north, consists of 

subcropping vein breccias striking northeast for over 550m.   At least three structures were found within 

this second zone.  Visible gold is commonly found in limonite-filled vugs with minor sulfides (pyrite, 

marcasite, and arsenopyrite).  

 

Veins and sulfide breccias have also been identified in the El Nido dome complex, mostly at the dome 

margins and specifically at El Nido Sur, El Nido Norte, and El Nido Centro. 

 

At the surface, the veins of the Las Calandrias project area are composed almost entirely of dense brown 

chalcedony that is, in part, hydrothermally brecciated.  This chalcedony is locally crustified, and cavities 

within the veins are filled with massive kaolinite.  High levels of arsenic, antimony, and mercury are 

present, which combined with the presence of chalcedony and late vug-filling kaolinite suggests a 

shallow level of exposure (Sillitoe, 2009a). The veins are irregularly developed but locally are up to 1m 

in width.  Pyrite and marcasite are found in both brecciated and non-brecciated vein material; Sillitoe 

(2009a) noted that the abundance of iron sulfides, particularly at such shallow levels in the system, is 

considered unusual.  At the surface, gold values in the veins range from almost zero to 106g/t (Nido 

Norte); Sillitoe (2009a) reported a notable concentration of >5g Au/t among the few samples that had 

been analyzed at the time of his visit.  He reported that arsenic, antimony, and mercury values in surface 

vein samples averaged ~1,000ppm, ~60ppm, and ~5ppm, respectively, which was much higher than 

normal for veins of the Deseado Massif. 

 

9.1 Calandria Sur Target  
 

Calandria Sur was discovered in November 2009 with discovery hole CSD13.  Presently, Calandria Sur 

appears to be a complex system.  This target consists of a northwest-trending rhyolite dome which hosts 

low-grade gold mineralization that is cut by steeply dipping structures; these structures might continue 

below the base of the dome into the volcaniclastic rocks.  The vein breccia system is composed of 

northeast- and northwest-trending structures that appear to dip steeply inward within the dome.  The 

most robust mineralization encountered in drilling, e.g., CSD13, CSD23, CSD24, and CSD39, occurs 

where both sets of structures intersect, according to Mariana staff. 

 

At Deseada breccia (see Figure 10.1), the contact with the volcaniclastic apron is exposed.  Strong 

silicification and kaolinite alteration are developed within the rhyolite dome, grading to illite-smectite in

the volcaniclastic rocks.  In several places, the volcaniclastic apron occurs as roof pendants, indicating 

that the cupola of the rhyolite dome is exposed at Calandria Sur. 

 

The initial holes drilled in late 2009 intersected wide zones of shallow-level, low-sulfidation, epithermal 

gold-silver mineralization in the pervasively brecciated rhyolite dome (Sillitoe, 2009b).  Sillitoe (2009b) 

commented that Calandria Sur was the first example of bulk-tonnage gold-silver mineralization hosted 

in a dome-related hydrothermal breccia discovered as of that date in the Jurassic epithermal precious-

metal province of Patagonia. Where subsequent drill holes have terminated in the volcaniclastic wall 

rock, anomalous gold values of up to 1.2g Au/t have been intersected, indicating that the mineralization 

is not totally confined to the rhyolite dome.  The best intercept as of June 30, 2010 was in hole CSD23, 

which encountered 69.5m of 2.1 g Au/t and 39 g Ag/t from 47m, including 22m of 4.3 g Au/t and 78 g 

Ag/t from 81m.  Additional intercepts of note are:  102m of 1.4g Au/t and 21g Ag/t from 12.5m in hole 

CDS24; 68m of 2.4g Au/t and 24g Ag/t from 74m in hole CSD25; and 106m of1.6g Au/t and 27g Ag/t 

from 3m in hole CSD39.  The mineralized zone extends over an area of 400m by 200m to depths 

exceeding 100m and is open to the southwest. 

 

Mineralization at Calandria Sur is dominated by breccia zones up to 30m wide and striking northeast 

and northwest.  There appear to be three main types of breccias: 

 Type A:  Contains fine-grained angular monomictic fragments with brown chalcedony cement 

without sulfides.  Grades are around 0.1g Au/t and <10g Ag/t. 

 Type B:  Monomictic breccia with sub-angular to rounded fragments.  Microcrystalline quartz to 

chalcedony cement is low in sulfides (<2%) with grades between 0.2 and 0.6g Au/t and 5 to 15g Ag/t. 

 Type C: Monomictic breccia with pervasively silicified monomictic clasts, sulfide-rich (<20% 

volume), with grades between 1 and 5g Au/t and 30 to 400g Ag/t. 

 

Type C breccias are thought to have developed at or near main fluid conduits and to grade upward or 

laterally to Type B and Type A breccias.   

 

In the early drilling, the highest gold-grade intercepts were found abutting the brecciated dome contact 

and were hosted by massively silicified breccia overprinted by a marcasite-pyrite stockwork (Sillitoe, 

2009b).  Sulfides are mainly pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite, and acanthite; locally realgar is found in 

limonite-rich vugs.  High grades correlate with strong pervasive silicification and high sulfide content; 

grades appear to increase where more veinlets are present.  However, samples with pervasive 

silicification and high sulfide content may return assays with low grades of precious metals. 

 

Although pyrite and marcasite are present sporadically with iron oxides in outcrop and to depths of 20 to 

30m in drill core, limonite, hematite, and minor jarosite are most common to these depths.  The iron 

oxides appear to be mostly on planar joints.  The coincidence of primary and secondary concentration of 

precious metals, which is the layer of enrichment, may be critical to increasing grade to economic 

significance. 

 

Sillitoe (2009b) reported that there are three alteration-mineralization stages.  The first appears as 

cementation of breccia clasts by quartz and minor pyrite.  The rhyolite clasts are pervasively altered to 

illite.  That illite extends for a short distance into the host ignimbrite but gives way to lower-temperature 

smectite alteration.  The second stage, confined to the dome margins, consists of pervasive silicification 

of breccia clasts accompanied by introduction of iron sulfide.  The third stage overprinted only the

external parts of the silicified breccia and consists of fine-grained marcasite and pyrite in the form of an 

irregular veinlet stockwork; iron sulfide may locally reach 20% volume.  Gold and silver were 

apparently introduced during all three stages but become progressively higher in grade from stage one 

through stage three.  Gold and silver are present in the fine-grained marcasite-pyrite stockwork and 

apparently also accompany the lesser quantities of iron sulfides precipitated during the first two stages. 

 

9.2 Calandria Norte Target 
 

Calandria Norte, located about 700m north of Calandria Sur, consists of northwest- and northeast-

trending veins and vein-breccia mineralization on the south-eastern side of a circular rhyolite dome.  

This mineralization is in contrast to the more widely silicified breccias at Calandria Sur.  At the 

discovery outcrop of the Calandria Norte vein-breccia, where the mineralization was identified by 

trenching, the vein-breccia is up to 0.7m wide with multiple parallel veins; the vein-breccia strikes 

northeast and dips steeply to the north.  The vein-breccia is filled with brown chalcedony and 

microcrystalline quartz with black sulfides.  This vein has been followed for almost 400m along strike 

with widths typically between 0.4 and 0.8m, assaying between 2.3 and 20.2g Au/t and 8 to 55g Ag/t at 

the surface (Rodriguez et al., 2009).  At least five vein zones have been identified, including La 

Calandria, La Mora, and the Tongoril veins.  Backhoe trenching has identified low-grade stockwork-

style mineralization up to 8m wide at La Mora vein. 

 

Drilling at Calandria Norte has identified a 3m-wide sulfide-rich silicified structure 100m below surface.  

Two holes drilled 70m apart along strike in 2010 intersected wide zones of marcasite-pyrite veining up 

to 125m down hole in strongly silicified rocks in the hanging wall of this structure.  As of May 26, 2010, 

the best intersections of these two holes were: 

 Hole CND45 with 4.0m of 76g Au/t (screen fire assay) and 70g Ag/t from 92.5m 

 Hole CND46 with 4.5m of 102g Au/t (screen fire assay) and 72g Ag/t from 81.5m. 
 

True width is approximately 80% of the drilled width based on the current geologic model.  

 

Mineralization is in a breccia zone of colloform/crustiform and skeletal marcasite/pyrite with interstitial 

electrum.  The breccia is associated with a 60 to 125m-wide (apparent thickness) envelope of stockwork 

marcasite and quartz veining.  The stockwork zone on the hanging wall side of the vein-breccia 

averaged 32.5m of 0.7g Au/t from 60m.  

 

These two drill-hole intersections are interpreted by Mariana geologists to be the down-dip extension of 

the La Calandria vein-breccia zone, which at the surface strikes for at least 450m and dips steeply to the 

northwest. 

 

9.3 El Nido Este Target 
 

The Nido Este target is a northeast-trending rhyolite dome located just west of Calandria Norte and 

1.1km northwest of Calandria Sur.  Northeast-trending veins have been mapped in the northern part of 

this dome.  Two holes have intersected wide zones of disseminated pyrite and marcasite as well as 

pyrite-marcasite veinlets in the rhyolite dome.  The intersections ranged in length from 70m in NED48 

to 120m in NED47, with high-sulfide zones with up to 10% sulfides by volume ranging from 6m to

27m; however, neither hole returned significant gold and silver values.  Mineralization is similar to that 

at Calandria Sur, consisting of opaline chalcedonic quartz veinlets and replacements with pyrite and 

marcasite and smectite/illite alteration. 

 

9.4 El Nido Norte Target 
 

The Nido Norte target (Figure 9.1) is located 2km northwest of Calandria Sur and consists of multiple 

rhyolite domes aligned in a northeast direction and cross cut by a long northeast-trending vein.  Drilling 

has targeted bonanza gold and silver mineralization from surface channel samples that assayed up to 

0.5m of 106g Au/t and 504g Ag/t.  One hole (NND49) intersected a pervasively silicified and sulfide-

rich structure 4m wide within a 30m-wide zone of sulfide-rich quartz veins, stockworks, breccias, and 

sulfide disseminations.  The oxidation zone from 5m to 26m is characterized by goethite-hematite and 

jarosite veining with relict sulfides.  A 14.4m interval in NND49 assayed 0.3g Au/t.  The best assay was 

a 2m interval of 4.9g Au/t and 72g Ag/t from 68m in drill hole NND50.

9.5 Other Targets 
 

Detailed mapping and IP geophysics have indicated new, largely concealed, dome-related mineralization 

with new targets.  This new zone of mineralization is related to sub-cropping rhyolite domes located 

between and to the west of the Nido Norte and Nido Este targets, adding three new targets to the Nido 

sector of the Las Calandrias project.

10.0 EXPLORATION  
 

Using satellite imagery, structural analysis, and coincidence of Jurassic Bahia Laura Group rocks, 

Mariana identified alteration zones in the Las Calandrias area.  Initial exploration identified eight 

distinct areas of gold-silver mineralization on the property, of which the La Calandria zone in the 

southeastern part of the property appeared to be the most promising target (Rodriguez, 2009). 

 

Initial rock-chip samples returned assays of 21.7g Au/t and 62g Ag/t; 3g Au/t and 6g Ag/t; and 1.2g Au/t 

and 133g Ag/t.  In early 2009, consultant Dr. Richard Sillitoe recognized that the rhyolite domes had the 

potential for low-sulfidation epithermal mineralization in veins and breccias (Sillitoe, 2009a). 

 

Coarse-fraction ("lag") soil sampling in the first half of 2009 defined two gold anomalies:  one 850m by 

150m at Calandria Sur and one 550m by 100m at Calandria Norte. A total of 327 samples was collected.  

At Calandria Sur, samples were collected every 50m on east-west lines paced 50m apart over an area 

800m by 600m.  At Calandria Norte, samples were collected every 25m along southeast-northwest lines 

spaced 50m apart over an area 600m by 300m.  Assays ranged up to 717ppb gold; 8% of the samples 

were anomalous (Au > 73ppb).  Soil gold anomalies coincided with known silicified rocks.   

 

Follow up of lag gold anomalies revealed further veins at Calandria Norte and breccias at Calandria Sur 

(Figure 10.1).  Rock chips at Calandria Sur assayed up to 0.8m of 5.7g Au/t and 241g Ag/t from the 

Deseada breccia zone and up to 4.5g Au/t and 405g Ag/t from the El Abra breccia zone located 200m 

northwest of Deseada.  Low-sulfide breccias that surround the sulfide breccias at Calandria Sur yielded 

assays of up to 0.8g Au/t, 36g Ag/t and 1.2g Au/t, 62g Ag/t at Deseada and Cristal (750m northwest of 

Deseada), respectively.

Mariana excavated diamond-saw channel samples from 21 shallow trenches at both Calandria Sur and 

Calandria Norte (Table 10.1).  Shallow channel samples included assays of 17.5m of 1.9g Au/t and 

56.3g Ag/t at Calandria Sur and 2.7m of 5.4g Au/t and 7.7g Ag/t, including 0.7m of 20.2g Au/t and 

25.4g Ag/t at Calandria Norte.  At Calandria Sur, trenching confirmed that wide zones of gold and silver 

mineralization are hosted in brecciated rhyolite bodies.

Mariana commenced drilling in the fall of 2009 and in late 2009 discovered disseminated gold 

mineralization around the eastern brecciated margin of the rhyolite dome at Calandria Sur.  Section 11.0 

describes Mariana's drilling on the Las Calandrias project.

September 28, 2010   

Detailed mapping, rock-chip geochemistry, and geophysical surveying were conducted following the 

Calandria Sur discovery in late 2009.  Detailed mapping revealed the northeast-trending El Nido rhyolite 

dome complex.  Mapping and rock-chip sampling identified outcropping sulfide-bearing vein and 

breccia mineralization at El Nido Sur, El Nido Norte, and El Nido Centro with rock chips at El Nido 

Norte assaying up to 2.7g Au/t and 638g Ag/t. 

 

Mariana contracted with Quantec Geoscience Ltd. ("Quantec") to conduct a 3D induced polarization 

("IP") and resistivity survey over an area about 1.4km by 1.8km over the Calandria Sur, Calandria 

Norte, and El Nido Norte rhyolite domes (Rideout, 2010).  In addition, Quantec conducted a north-south 

pole-dipole test array and five pole-dipole sections of 500m each for a total of 3km on Nido Norte, Nido 

Centro, and Nido Sur, according to Mariana. The survey utilized an "offset pole-dipole 3D array," which 

can image sulfide mineralization to depths greater than 300m.  Sizeable IP anomalies with moderately 

elevated chargeabilities were identified at both Calandria Norte and Calandria Sur.  According to 

Rideout (2010), these anomalies suggested the possibility of sulfides, which have been shown to 

accompany mineralization.  In addition, the survey identified a large chargeability anomaly on the west 

side of the survey area at Nido Este that had values similar to those from Calandria Norte and Calandria 

Sur but representing a larger target volume. 

 

Surface channel sampling was undertaken at El Nido Norte and returned bonanza gold and silver assays 

that included 0.4m of 62g Au/t and 332g Ag/t; 0.5m of 106g Au/t and 510g Ag/t; and 0.7m of 8.2g Au/t 

and 2,940g Ag/t.  Detailed mapping, lag sampling, and limited trenching were conducted at El Nido 

Norte. 

 

According to Mariana staff, Quantec is currently conducting additional geophysical surveying at Las 

Calandrias.  Two detailed 2D grids of pole-dipole-array IP are being run on Calandria Norte and 

Calandria Sur.  At the former, six lines 750m in length are being run 100m apart with 25m dipole 

spacing.  At Calandria Sur, five lines 1,000m in length are being run, also 100m apart with 25m dipole 

spacing. In addition, two blocks of 3D offset pole-dipole IP, 2.8km east-west by 1.8km north-south, are 

being run covering Nido Norte and Nido Sur. 

 

Preliminary metallurgical test work on samples from Calandria Sur is being conducted by Metcon 

Laboratories in Australia as described in Section 16.0.

11.0 DRILLING 
 

11.1 Summary 
 

Drilling by Mariana began at the Las Calandrias project in September 2009.  No drilling had been 

undertaken on the property prior to that of Mariana.  Fifty-three diamond-drill core holes totaling 

5,963m have been drilled at Las Calandrias by Mariana in 2009 and through June 30, 2010.  The initial 

drill program in 2009 consisted of 16 shallow holes totaling 1,563m testing Calandria Norte and 

Calandria Sur.  The 2010 core drilling program consisted of a total of 37 holes that were drilled at 

Calandria Sur (28 holes for 3,212m), Calandria Norte (2 holes for 299m), El Nido Este (2 holes for 

309m), and El Nido Norte (5 holes for 580m).   

 

Figure 11.1 is a map of drill-hole locations.  Table 11.1 summarizes the significant mineralized 

intercepts for the 2009 and 2010 drilling. 

 

11.1.1 Calandria Sur Target 

The Calandria Sur target has had the most drilling of any of the four targets, with a total of 37 holes to 

date, including two holes that have been drilled into a rhyolite dome located just north of Calandria Sur. 

The 2010 drill program tested an area about 600m long by 200m wide to depths of up to 150m.  

According to Mariana news releases, most of the holes intersected broad zones of brecciation, 

silicification, and stockwork marcasite-pyrite mineralization at depths of from 14m to 80m down hole.  

 

11.1.2 Calandria Norte Target 

A total of nine holes have been drilled to date at Calandria Norte.  Seven shallow reconnaissance (aka 

scout) holes were drilled in 2009, intersecting thin vein-breccia and disseminated sulfide zones.  Two 

2010 holes, CND45 and CND46, tested a 3D IP anomaly near the core of the dome and intersected wide 

zones of marcasite-pyrite veining up to 125m down hole. 

 

11.1.3 El Nido Este Target 

Two reconnaissance or scout drill holes, NED 47 and NED 48, have been drilled into El Nido Este.  The 

holes, collared 100m apart, tested an IP anomaly.  Both intersected pyrite-marcasite disseminations and 

veinlets, with intersections ranging in length from 70m to 120m and containing high-sulfide (up to 10% 

by volume) zones ranging from 6m to 27m. 

 

11.1.4 El Nido Norte Target 

Five reconnaissance drill holes, NND49 to NND53, have been drilled into El Nido Norte.  Hole NND49 

intersected a pervasively silicified and sulfide-rich structure 4m wide.

11.2 Drilling Procedures 
 

Mariana has used Boart-Longyear Argentina as their drill contractor at Las Calandrias.  A Boyles 37A 

drill rig was used in the 2009 drilling up to drill hole CSD16.  A 25HH-3 rig capable of drilling 300m 

depths was used for the 2010 drilling.    

  

Drill rigs are set up with a collar peg, and the side of the rig is aligned to azimuth along an offset parallel 

line marked with lime, pegs, and a shallow trench.  Collars are initially located using hand-held GPS 

units measuring in WGS 84 Datum.  The rig has a clinometer for setting the mast's inclination.  In the 

field, a geologist checks the azimuth and inclination of the core hole and progress of the drill. 

 

All of the drilling produced HQ core, and, in general, core recovery appeared to be high (Fitch and 

Ristorcelli, 2010).  The core is placed in one-meter-long, three-row wooden core boxes, and lids are put 

on the boxes prior to hauling to the core-logging and sampling shed. 

 

The core is hauled to the core shed at the estancia office, where it is laid out and washed by a technician.  

Core recovery and RQD are measured between wood blocks placed at the end of each core run.  A 

technician measures core recovery and performs RQD logging; a geologist verifies recovery, position of 

the core run blocks, and RQD.  The length of missing core for the run (if any) is written on the core-box 

partition at the end of a run.  The missing lengths are recorded in the database.  A geologist logs 

lithology, mineralization, alteration and oxidation codes.  The core is then marked up in one-meter 

intervals, taking core recovery into account.  Marks are placed on the core-box partition, and the sample 

number is written on the core-box partition.  Sample numbers are consecutive, and standards, blanks and 

duplicates are included in the numbered sequence.  Placement for standard samples is represented by an 

empty, marked, and ticketed bag.   

 

The core is photographed both dry and wet before sawing.  The core photo library is quite complete and 

is well organized (Fitch and Ristorcelli, 2010).   

 

Down-hole surveying was performed by the driller for Boart-Longyear Argentina, using a Reflex, EZ-

Shot tool and providing a Drill-Hole Survey Record form with manual entries for the depth, azimuth, 

and inclination/dip.  No down-hole core orientation was applied in the first two drill campaigns.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 

Mariana uses the following sampling procedures for its core drilling.  All of their drilling has been core 

at HQ size.  All samples are collected under the supervision of Mariana geologists. 

 

Core is sampled by geologic contacts or on approximately one-meter intervals where geologic contacts 

are not present. Mariana reports that they try to keep minimum and maximum sample lengths at 0.5 and 

3m, respectively.  About 95% of the core is sampled; unsampled core is mostly at the bottom of the drill 

hole in unaltered rock that lacks sulfides.  

 

The core is cut in half with an electric diamond saw by a technician along the line marked by the 

geologist who logs the core, and both halves and any fines are set back into the core box in the same 

position taken.  The saw table is cleaned with water periodically to prevent sediment accumulation.  The 

left side of the core split is taken and bagged by a geologist, with the sample numbers written on the 

outside of sample bags.  The sample ticket is inserted into one edge of the upper part of the bag, which is 

folded accordion-style with the ticket number visible, folded over, and secured with a plastic lock tie.  

Each sample is weighed, and the weight recorded.   

 

The bagged core samples are laid out and then placed sequentially into larger bags, which end up 

weighing about 25kg each.  The larger bags are marked with sample numbers and contain approximately 

seven samples each.  These larger bags are transported to the lab.  Sample shipments are tracked.  

 

Duplicates are created in the following manner:  a duplicate sample interval is chosen, then the core is 

sawed in ½, and that core is sawed in ½ to provide two samples of ¼ core, leaving ½ core in the box for 

future reference.  The duplicate samples are bagged and tagged with sequential numbers and inserted 

into the sample sequence.  Blanks are bagged and inserted in the sample sequence.  The blanks are from 

an outcrop source of granite near the estancia.  Mariana has assayed the material to be less than 0.005g 

Au/t and less than 0.20g Ag/t.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 
 

Depending on the bulk quantity, the samples are either picked up at the estancia by AndesMar trucking 

company or delivered to the station at Caleta Olivia by Mariana personnel for transport to the sample 

prep lab in Mendoza.  AndesMar is under contract to ALS Chemex ("Chemex") in Mendoza, the 

primary assay lab.  Mariana sends all samples to Chemex for sample preparation at their facilities in 

Mendoza and assaying at their facilities in Chile.  An employee of Mariana takes the pulps in Mendoza 

and inserts the standards into the correct sample sequence, prior to air shipment to La Serena, Chile 

 

Sample preparation includes weighing, drying, crushing of the entire sample to greater than 70% -2mm, 

taking a split of 250g, and pulverizing the split to greater than 85% passing 75microns (Chemex PREP-

31, DRY-22). 

 

Analyses consist of gold assays and multi-element ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma) analysis.  Gold 

analyses for all samples are by fire assay with an atomic absorption ("AA") finish (Chemex Au-AA24, 

50g nominal sample weight, range 0.005-10ppm).  Any results over 10g Au/t are checked using a 

gravimetric finish (Chemex Au-GRA22, 50g, with a range of 0.05-1.000g Au/t).  The 34-element ICP 

analyses (Chemex ME ICP41 package) uses aqua regia digestion.  Silver grades exceeding 100g Ag/t 

are checked by fire assay with a gravimetric finish (Chemex Ag-GRA21, 30g nominal sample weight, 

range 5-10,000ppm).  

 

Screen or metallic screening (AU-SCR22) consists of preparation of a 1000g pulp that is then washed 

through a 75micron(200 mesh) screen to separate any coarse (+75 micron) material. Any +75micron 

material remaining on the screen is dried, weighed, and analyzed in its entirety. The 75micron fraction is 

dried and homogenized. Duplicate sub-samples are analyzed using standard fire assay procedures. The 

gold values for both +75micron and 75micron fractions are reported together with the weight of each 

fraction as well as the calculated total gold content of the sample.  

 

Chemex is ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 17025:1999 certified.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

14.1 Database Verification 
 

During its site visit, MDA did work to verify that the original "quick logs" geological data entered into 

the database are a reasonable representation of the core and that the RQD and core recoveries were 

measured and entered correctly.  No errors were found during the detailed comparison of the core, 

"quick log", sample numbers and assay results, as well as checking the core recovery.  Verification 

included a field check of the collar locations using a hand-held GPS and measuring drill-hole azimuths 

and dips by Brunton compass.  MDA field checked collar locations, azimuths, and dips for eight drill 

holes spread over the Calandria Sur, Calandria Norte, El Nido Norte, and El Nido Este areas (Table 

14.1).  It should be noted that MDA's location checks are done only to the precision of a hand-held GPS, 

which confirms reasonableness and the drill holes' positions relative to each other are correct, not their 

absolute geographic positions.    Trench locations were also checked by GPS.  The drill hole and trench 

location measurements checked within reasonable limits.

14.2 Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
 

Mariana reports that certified standards are inserted at an average of one per 20 samples.  At one time, 

Mariana had four different certified gold standards, but they are now using three different standards as 

the fourth has been consumed.  In-house blanks are inserted at an average of one per 40 samples.  On 

site, blank material is drawn from an aplitic granite outcrop that was assayed by Mariana and determined 

to be barren. Of 110 blanks reported in the database from previous assays, 102 were <0.005g Au/t, three 

were 0.006g Au/t, and five ranged from 0.009g Au/t to 0.012g Au/t.  Of the 110 blanks, 103 assayed 

0.20g Ag/t, four were 0.30g Ag/t, two were 0.40g Ag/t, and one assayed 0.60g Ag/t.  Field duplicates of 

core are quarter-core and are placed in sequence after the original sample.  Quarter-core duplicate 

samples are inserted at intervals of about 35 samples.  A total of 9% quality control samples have been 

inserted.  Mariana reports that assays that meet the quality assurance/quality control ("QA/QC") 

specifications are incorporated into the Mariana database. 

 

Mariana reviews the results from the QA/QC samples as they are received.  If corrective action is 

required, Mariana issues the necessary instructions. 

 

Mariana analyzed and reported on the statistical analysis of three standards, blanks, and duplicates from 

16 diamond-drill holes totaling 1,500m in September 2009 (Gomez, 2009).  A total of 769 samples were 

taken, including 17 blanks, 16 duplicates, and 37 standards.  The samples were taken from core and split 

with a diamond rock saw.  For two of the three standards, all of the assays fell within the precision 

expected, but for one of the three standards, the assays were lower by 16 to 18% of the standard.  Blanks 

consisted of previously assayed aplitic granite with low values of precious and other metals.  The 

precision and reproducibility of the blanks for gold were good.  For silver, all reported values were 

below the limit of detection.  An analysis of blanks to preceding samples showed a very low correlation 

coefficient of R
2
= 0.0388.  Duplicates are ¼ core split, diamond-sawed from the original split. There is 

good correlation between the original and duplicate samples with a correlation coefficient of R
2
= 0.9573 

for Au and 0.99 for Ag. 

 

While MDA did not do any independent evaluations of the QA/QC data because the database is not 

being used for a resource estimate at this time, MDA considers Mariana's current QA/QC program to be 

very good. 

 

14.3 Independent Sampling 
 

MDA took six trench samples (Figure 14.1) and eight ¼-core samples from mineralized zones as 

independent samples for analysis to verify the presence of gold-silver mineralization.  All of the samples 

were taken under MDA supervision, and each sample bag was secured with sequentially numbered 

plastic ties.  The sample bags from the first day's samples were placed in a plastic box with further ties.  

These samples were later transferred to three larger bags, together with the final samples taken.  Each of 

the three large sample bags was secured with large sequentially numbered plastic ties.  The samples 

were kept under the direct supervision of MDA whether at the estancia or in a field truck.  The samples 

were taken by pickup truck to Caleta and handed to AndesMar for transport to Chemex in Mendoza.  

AndesMar is under contract to Chemex for sample shipments.  Assay results for the check samples are 

shown on Table 14.2.  MDA notes that the grades obtained by MDA support both the general tenor of 

grades reported by Mariana and the presence of mineralization.

15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 

Minera IRL Ltd. ("IRL"), through a takeover of Hidefield Gold and amalgamation of Hidefield 

Argentina into Minera IRL Patagonia SA, acquired the Escondido project immediately adjacent to the 

Las Calandrias property near Calandria Sur.  According to an IRL news release dated June 30, 2010 (see 

SEDAR), a large breccia body has been identified and named Escondido.  Surface sampling on 

Escondido has returned anomalous gold values over a strike length of some 700m.  Eleven of 22 outcrop 

rock samples assayed >0.1g Au/t, with the highest assaying 2.4g Au/t and 84g Ag/t (May 20, 2010 news 

release on SEDAR).   

 

In a news release dated September 15, 2010 (see SEDAR), IRL reported a new gold/silver discovery on 

the Escondido project, which they described as an extension of Mariana's Calandria Sur discovery.  

According to the IRL news release, 10 of the 11 holes into the "Northern Breccia Zone" at Escondido 

have intersected "substantial zones of mineralized breccia."   Best intersections are: 

• E-D10-02 25.38 meters averaging 1.45 g/t gold and 9.62 g/t silver, including 13.75 meters 

grading 2.39 g/t gold and 14.56 g/t silver 

• E-D10-03 100.0 meters averaging 1.19 g/t gold and 7.77 g/t silver, including 48.00 meters 

grading 1.71 g/t gold and 9.18 g/t silver 

• E-D10-07 120.40 meters averaging 0.65 g/t gold and 5.70 g/t silver, including 14.70 meters 

grading 1.30 g/t gold and 11.86 g/t silver and 8.40 meters grading 2.45 g/t gold and 8.31 g/t 

silver.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

No metallurgical test work had been conducted on the Las Calandrias property prior to Mariana's tenure. 

 

The following information has been provided by Mariana.  Preliminary metallurgical test work is 

underway at Metcon Laboratories in Sydney, Australia, under the supervision of Consulting Metallurgist 

Peter Lewis to estimate the gold and silver recoveries that could be obtained from a resource at 

Calandria Sur once and if defined.  The test work is designed to provide information that could be used 

in a preliminary economic assessment. 

 

The first step in the program involved LeachWell assaying of mineralized intervals from nine selected 

drill holes to determine the likely variation in gold recoveries across the deposit.  This showed that the 

recoveries will be dependent on the degree of oxidation.   

 

Bulk composite samples of oxidized, slightly oxidized, and unoxidized mineralization are now being 

prepared from the nine drill holes.   Gravity concentration and carbon-in-leach ("CIL") tests will be 

completed on each composite, and, in addition, their abrasion index and the rod mill and ball mill work 

indices will be determined.   The potential for heap leaching the oxidized mineralization will also be 

assessed.  

 

Tests will be completed on the unoxidized composite to determine the increases in gold and silver 

recoveries that can be achieved over straight CIL processing.   These will involve flotation, followed by 

oxidation of the flotation concentrate, and then cyanidation of the oxidized concentrate.   The effect of 

ultrafine grinding of the flotation concentrate before cyanidation will also be assessed.

18.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 

At the time of MDA's site visit, Mariana had a licensed surveyor on site, performing a survey of the drill 

holes, trenches, and a part of the southern property boundary.  In addition, new geophysical surveys 

were planned or had begun.  The new survey and geophysical work were in progress and, therefore, 

have not been reviewed for this report.

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

With only 53 holes completed to date, Las Calandrias is an early-stage exploration property.  

Nevertheless, the drilling has resulted in a discovery significant gold-silver mineralization in a favorable 

geologic setting and the drilling to date at Calandria Sur indicates three dimensional continuity of gold 

mineralization.  From a review of the data and field examination, it is concluded that Mariana has 

performed technical work that meets or exceeds industry standards.  It is further concluded that the Las 

Calandrias property is a property of merit and warrants further work, including additional drilling to 

advance the project, and an estimate of in-situ resources. 

 

MDA took six trench samples and eight ¼-core samples from mineralized zones as independent samples 

for analysis to independently verify the presence of gold-silver mineralization.  MDA notes that the 

grades obtained by MDA support both the general tenor of grades reported by Mariana and the presence 

of mineralization. 

 

Las Calandrias lies within the Deseado Massif, which hosts numerous low-sulfidation, epithermal, 

precious-metal, quartz vein and vein-breccia deposits that appear to have closely followed Jurassic acid 

volcanism.  The southeastern portion of Mariana's Las Calandrias property contains numerous rhyolite 

domes, several of which have been identified as hosting gold mineralization associated with sulfide-

bearing veins and vein breccias. 

 

Calandria Sur is the best-explored target to date.  Widely silicified vein-breccia zones within the rhyolite 

dome contain low-grade gold in quartz-sulfide stockwork veining.   Calandria Norte, a second rhyolite 

dome, has northwest- and northeast-trending veins and vein-breccia mineralization.  Reconnaissance or 

scout drilling at Nido East and Nido Norte has identified the presence of sulfide-bearing veinlets, veins, 

stockworks, breccias, and sulfide disseminations in an area of two rhyolite domes that are part of the 

northeast-trending El Nido system of coalescing domes. 

 

Las Calandrias is gold-dominated (in value) with a Ag:Au ratio that averages 20 at Calandria Sur and 5 

at Calandria Norte and a relatively low base-metal content.  Mineralization at Las Calandrias is not 

restricted to sharp-walled quartz veins but occurs also as disseminations in wall rock and in chalcedonic 

hydrothermal breccia filling.  Some of the mineralized zones in drill-hole intercepts appear to correlate 

as roughly sub-horizontal zones rather than steeply dipping veins.  These geologic features are favorable 

for bulk-tonnage deposits.  Las Calandrias mineralization is related to certain rhyolite-dome complexes 

that may exhibit feeder zones.  Geology, geochemistry, and exploration drilling away from Las 

Calandrias suggest good exploration potential remains.

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

Las Calandrias warrants substantial additional work.  The work should concentrate on defining the 

resource at Las Calandrias and drilling at El Nido.  The following programs are recommended: 

 Drilling at Calandria Sur: (approximately 4,000m in 35 holes) - Delineation drilling of a 

breccia-hosted gold-silver resource including closer-spaced drilling of potentially higher-grade 

zones indicated to date.  Best drill intersections have included 68m of 2.4g Au/t and 24g Ag/t 

from 74m (Hole CSD25) and 106m of 1.6g Au/t and 27g Ag/t from 3m (Hole CSD39). 

 Drilling at Calandria Norte:  (approximately 4,000m in 25 holes) - Priority drilling below and 

along strike from previous exceptional drill intersections of bonanza-grade vein-breccia-hosted 

gold/silver mineralization of 4.0m of 76g Au/t and 70g Ag/t from 92.5m (Hole CND45) and 

4.5m of 102g Au/t and 72g/t Ag from 81.5m (Hole CND46).  This drill program will include 

drilling of the entire 450m-long target trend. 

 Drilling at El Nido Dome Field:  (approximately 2,000m in 20 holes) - Exploration drilling of 

the 1.5km-long target trend at El Nido Norte prospect and new targets identified from IP, 

magnetics, geochemistry, and geological mapping.  

 Lag/rock sampling: A large grid of lag sampling is proposed with lines oriented WNW-ESE, 

sample spacing of 50m, and lines spaced 100m apart over El Nido area (about 2,000 samples at 

$30 /sample) and some 200 rock/diamond-saw samples (at $45/sample).  The purpose of this 

sampling is to define new or concealed mineralization; lag sampling was the most important 

sampling technique leading to identification of Calandria Sur.  Total cost of about $70,000. 

 Geophysics:  Detailed magnetic survey over an area 3km by 3km covering Las Calandrias and 

El Nido, with line spacing of 50m, and N-S lines at a cost of $25,000; 3D IP (2km by 2.8km at 

Nido Norte and 1.8km by 2.8km at Nido Sur) and two detailed  pole-dipole array grids (dipole 

spacing 50m, line 100m apart) with seven WNW-ESE lines 800m in length at Calandria Norte 

and five E-W lines about 1,000m in length at Calandria Sur at a total cost of $250,000. 

 Resource estimation and reporting: Begin resource modeling on Las Calandrias and when 

warranted, at El Nido.  Expected costs are around $100,000. 

 

The total cost of the drilling program is estimated at $2,200,000. With the addition of lag/rock sampling 

($70,000), additional geophysical surveying ($275,000), and resource estimation and reporting 

(~$100,000), the total cost of these recommendations is approximately $2,645,000.   

 

MDA recommends that during the just-described exploration work, Mariana begin a program of density 

determinations and continue analyzing for the 32-elements by ICP.   

 

Should the above programs prove successful, ensuing work would be expected to be substantially 

greater in magnitude and could, if warranted, provide the basis for initial scoping studies.  Tasks needed 

if this phase is successful, could include more detailed metallurgical testing of mineralization and 

engineering studies.  Any discoveries in other domes or at possible targets adjacent to Calandria Sur and 

Calandria Norte mineralization would be followed up more intensively in the next phase.
