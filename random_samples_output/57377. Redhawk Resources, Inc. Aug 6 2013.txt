1.0 SUMMARY 
 

 Following is a summary of the relevant details of the Copper Creek Project. 
Supplemental information is presented in the report text and appendices. 
 
1.1 Property Description and Location 

 
 The Copper Creek project is located about 75 road miles northeast of Tucson, 
Arizona USA. The property lays approximately 10 miles from the town of Mammoth, in 
the Bunker Hill Mining District on the western slopes of the Galiuro Mountains, Pinal 
County, Arizona, USA (indicated by red star). It lies in Township 8S, Range 18E, 
Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 GSRBM and is centered at 32°45' N 
Latitude, 110°30' W Longitude. (Figure1.1). The property is owned by Redhawk 
Copper, USA a wholly owned subsidiary of Redhawk Resources Inc. of Vancouver, BC 
Canada.

1.2 Geological Setting and Deposit Types 

 
 In addition to numerous breccia pipe deposits, the Copper Creek property is 
host to the American Eagle/Keel (AEK) "early-halo" type copper-molybdenum porphyry 
deposits, at depth. The Keel is located below the Mammoth breccia, and the AE is the

continuation of the porphyry deposit situated to the east and south of the Keel. Above 
the porphyry system, over three hundred breccia occurrences, overlying the AEK, and 
extending to the north, northwest, west, and southeast have been identified. Previous 
studies have evaluated the potential of mining the Childs, Mammoth, Old Reliable, 
Prince and Globe breccia deposits by selective mining methods. 
 
 At depth, where drilling density is sufficient, the base of the breccia pipes neck 
down into small gray or dark porphyry bodies. These appear to be the feeder zone to 
the breccia mineralization. The Keel zone (a zone of sheeted veins, veinlets and 
stockworks) is situated below the Mammoth breccia, while the AE porphyry is situated 
below several breccias that outcrop.  
 
 The AEK deposit exhibits disseminated mineralization in the form of clots, low 
angled, "sheeted" early dark micaceous (EDM) vein sets, high angled EDM vein sets, 
well mineralized intense quartz-sericite zones, and some areas that are likely deep-
seated breccias. 
 
 Based on detailed core logging and surface mapping, the AEK deposit is 
described as a sheeted vein, early-halo type, porphyry-like system (cf. Proffett, 2009). 
The mineralization is predominantly structurally controlled by fracture systems of 
several orientations, with some mineralization being disseminated. The mineralization 
is zoned with depth, going from predominately pyrite, near surface, and transitioning to 
chalcopyrite, and then to bornite, with depth. 
 
 At Copper Creek, copper oxide minerals have very limited replacement of the 
sulfides in the near-surface supergene weathering environment. A chalcocite and 
copper oxide enriched, supergene zone forms the principal part of the Old Reliable 
deposit above the water table. Molybdenite occurs in sufficient amounts in the AEK 
porphyry, as well as the Childs-Aldwinkle breccia, and the Old Reliable breccia, to be 
of interest economically. Gold and silver occur occasionally and have not been 
systematically assayed by previous owners. Redhawk has re-assayed individual 
intervals to better understand the precious metal grade distribution, where previous 
owners had assayed long composite runs. 
 
 Based on recent core drilling in the AEK, a significant tonnage of indicated and 
inferred mineralization has been identified. Based on these results, studies have been 
initiated to determine the economic potential of mining these deposits by bulk 
underground mining methods, or possibly by an open pit. 
 
 The existing models for the AEK deposit were updated with the recent drill hole 
information by Independent Mining Consultants (IMC) of Tucson, Arizona, using blocks 
100 ft by 100 ft by 25 ft high. From the model, mineralization limits at various cutoff 
grades, between the surface and depths of almost 4,000 ft, were determined.

1.3 Mineral Resource Estimates 
 
 The resource tons and grades contained within the American Eagle, Keel, 
Mammoth and lower Childs deposit grade shells, at a breakeven cutoff grade of 0.55 
percent Cueq, were tabulated by IMC, for each 20 ft bench height, between elevations 
500 and 4200, with the results presented in the following Table 1.1. 
 
 

 
 A new 20 ft x 20 ft x 20 ft model was developed by IMC based on the latest 
drilling input, and new tonnages and grades tabulated. Bench plans on 20 ft centers 
were drawn to indicate above cutoff areas in the Keel and AE deposits.  
 
 Using MineSight software, four areas, above the 0.55 percent Cueq cutoff grade, 
were then identified, in the AE, Keel, Mammoth and lower Childs deposits, that 
contained a sufficient tonnage, which could be mined by a post-pillar cut and fill mining 
method, and each could support a production rate of 6,250 t/d. Haulage level 
elevations were then located at the base of each area.  
 
 The individual bench maps within the deposit grade shells were then reviewed 
for above cutoff grade blocks that would not support development access, or needed 
to be re-classified by location. These changes were then tabulated to reflect the 
minable tons and grades available within the resource shells. Factors for mining 
(external) dilution and recovery, based on the proposed mining method, were applied.

The results of these exercises indicate the potentially minable tons and grades within 
the resource grade shells for the various deposits, and were used in the cashflow 
evaluation of the Copper Creek deposits.  
 
 The following Table 1.2 provides a summary of the diluted/recovered 
Resources. 

 
1.4 Mining 
 
 The basic mine plan would access the Mammoth-Keel and AE deposits mine 
through a 33 ft diameter, 3,800 ft deep, vertical shaft located at coordinates 638765 N 
and 401629 E. The current location was the result of evaluating four different locations, 
which considered the surface road access, deposit locations, Redhawk "patented" 
property boundaries, Old Reliable pit limits, and the projected geotechnical crack lines 
to the surface. This shaft size is capable of handling a production rate of 25,000 t/d. 
 
 Four major production levels (16 ft x 16 ft in Section) were selected. These 
levels would allow access from the shaft to the base of the most favorably-mineralized 
areas in the Mammoth, Lower Childs, Keel and AE deposits. The uppermost level 
(3000 Level) would access the bottom on the Mammoth and Lower Childs deposits,

while the 1000 and 1500 Levels would access both the Keel and AE deposits. The 
lowest level (500 Level) would access the deeper extensions of the Keel deposit only.  
 
 Internal ramps (15 ft x 15 ft), from the major haulage levels, would allow access 
to successive mining lifts and the base of the secondary deposits located above the 
haulage levels. The initial production would be situated in four stoping areas - two in 
the Keel (one above the 1000 Level, and one above the 1500 Level), and two in the 
AE deposit - (one above the 1000 Level, and one above the 1500 Level). Each stope 
would be designed for a production rate of 6,250 tons per day, for a total production 
rate of 25,000 tons per day.  
 
 Two, 20 ft diameter, approximately 3,000 ft deep, ventilation shafts would be 
sunk from the surface to the lowest level in each of the Mammoth-Keel and AE 
deposits, with connections to each of the haulage levels. Ten-ft diameter, bored 
passes would connect the mining levels with the haulage levels.  
 
 Mining would proceed from the haulage level upwards in 20 ft lifts, utilizing a 
post-pillar cut and fill mining method. Blast-hole drilling would utilize electric-hydraulic, 
two-boom, jumbos. Loading would be performed with 9 to 10 cy LHD's, which would 
move the blasted rock from the faces, or muck bays, to passes that would transfer the 
blasted rock to the haulage level. Fifty-ton haulage trucks would move the rock from 
the passes to grizzlies, equipped with a rock breaker, located on each haulage level, 
approximately 1,300 ft from the shaft. The broken rock would pass through the 
grizzlies to 60-in jaw crushers, be reduced to a nominal 6-in product, and then be 
moved via an inclined conveyor to a 4,000 ton storage pocket located adjacent to the 
production shaft. Fifty-five-ton skips would move the rock through the shaft to the 
surface.  
 
 When a 20 ft lift has been exploited, bulkheads will be installed to contain an 
engineered backfill consisting of deslimed mill tailings, classified mine waste, fly ash, 
and cement. When this backfill has consolidated, the next lift can be started on the top 
of the previously-excavated lift. The use of an engineered backfill will allow smaller 
pillars than would normally be allowed, to be left. This will optimize mining recovery of 
material from each of the deposits. In addition, by returning a large portion of the mill 
tailings back into the mine, the surface tailings impoundment size, and cost, can be 
minimized.    
 
 In general, the rocks at Copper Creek are very strong, with an average 
compressive strength of 10,000 to 20,000 psi, and median RQD's in the range of 80 to 
90 percent. The phreatic surface has been interpreted to be at the level of the San 
Pedro river, which is around the 2,000 ft elevation. The surface elevation over the 
deposits is around the 4,200 ft elevation, with the upper limit of reasonably contiguous 
mineralization in both deposits being around the 2,000 ft elevation. The better 
mineralization, in the both deposits, continues downward to approximately the 500 ft 
elevation. Preliminary geotechnical investigations indicate that rooms 20 ft wide and

20 ft high can be excavated in the rocks in the Mammoth-Keel and AE deposits, 
leaving 20 ft square pillars for initial support. This would result in a mining recovery of 
75 percent. The RQD's in the breccias (Mammoth/Childs) are somewhat less, thusly 
CNI has recommended leaving 25 ft x 25 ft pillars in these areas, resulting in an overall 
recovery there of 65 percent.  
 
 The upper (above the 3500L) Childs, Prince, and Globe breccia deposits would 
be developed and mined by the previously-proposed decline and access drifts, with a 
cut and fill mining method. A third ventilation shaft, as previously proposed, would be 
located adjacent to the upper Childs deposit access. 
 
1.4.1 Geotechnical Evaluation  
 
 Call & Nicholas, Inc. (CNI) has evaluated the American Eagle, Keel, Mammoth 
and Childs deposits as potential post-pillar cut and fill operations (PPCF). The 
American Eagle and Keel deposits have similar RQD distributions and intact strength 
properties, which are greater than those of the Mammoth and Childs. 
 
 Based on surface geologic structures, a room width of 20 ft is recommended 
using 4-ft long split set bolts on 3 to 4 ft centers. As additional joint set data from within 
the deposits are gathered, there is the potential for the American Eagle and Keel to be 
widened to a 25 ft room width, while in the Mammoth and Childs room widths may 
need to be reduced. 
 
 The recommended pillar widths for the American Eagle and Keel are 20 by 20 
ft, and in the Mammoth and Childs 25 by 25 ft. These pillar widths are based on mining 
15-ft high lifts for five (5) lifts after which mining heights can be increased to 20 ft. 
 
 Because the Mammoth and Childs deposits are at or near surface and because 
the actual mining area is yet to be finalized, CNI used a 70 degree crack angle to 
identify where Copper Creek is likely to be impacted and where to locate potential 
shaft locations.   
 
 CNI recommends diverting Copper Creek when either of the following happens: 
 

▪ The fill height of the American Eagle or Keel is 600 feet, or 
▪ When mining starts at either the Mammoth or the Childs. 
▪ When post pillar cut and fill mining starts at either the Mammoth or Childs.  
 
The mine schedule includes open stope mining part of the Childs and Mammoth 

deposits as the access is developed down to the American Eagle and Keel. This 
mining will be of a limited area and the backfill will be a cemented fill. Therefore the 
surface subsidence is unlikely.

 A mining recovery factor of 75 percent can be expected in the American Eagle 
and Keel deposits, and a mining recovery of 65 percent can be expected in the breccia 
post-pillar room and pillar mining 
 
1.4.2 Basic Mine Plan 
 

The basic mine would access the Mammoth-Keel and AE deposits mine through 
a 33 ft diameter, 3,800 ft deep, vertical shaft located at coordinates 638765 N and 
401629 E. These coordinates may change with better definition of the deposits, 
surface topography, and Redhawk "patented" property boundaries. The current 
location was the result of evaluating four different locations, which considered the 
surface road access, deposit locations, Redhawk "patented" property boundaries, Old 
Reliable pit limits, and the projected geotechnical crack lines to the surface. This shaft 
size is capable of handling a production rate of 25,000 tons per day. 
 
 Four major production levels (16 ft x 16 ft in Section) were selected. These 
levels would allow access from the shaft to the base of the most favorably-mineralized 
areas in the Mammoth, Lower Childs, Keel and AE deposits. The uppermost level 
(3000 Level) would access the bottom on the Mammoth and Lower Childs deposits, 
while the 1000 and 1500 Levels would access both the Keel and AE deposits. The 
lowest level (500 Level) would access the deeper extensions of the Keel deposit only.  
 
 All four haulage level shaft stations are planned to be developed during the 
shaft sinking phase to allow level development on the 500, 1000, 1500, and 3000 
levels. 
 
 Internal ramps (15 ft x 15 ft), from the major haulage levels, would allow access 
to successive mining lifts and the base of the secondary deposits located above the 
haulage levels. The initial production would be situated in four stoping areas – two in 
the Keel (one above the 1000 Level, and one above the 1500 Level), and two in the 
AE deposit – (one above the 1000 Level, and one above the 1500 Level). Each stope 
would be designed for a production rate of 6,250 tons per day, for a total production 
rate of 25,000 tons per day.  
 
 Two, 20 ft diameter, approximately 3,000 ft deep, ventilation shafts would be 
sunk from the surface to the lowest level in each of the Mammoth-Keel and AE 
deposits, with connections to each of the haulage levels. Ten foot diameter, bored, 
rock and ventilation passes would connect the mining levels with the haulage levels.  
 
 Mining would proceed from the haulage level upwards in 20 ft lifts, utilizing a 
post-pillar cut and fill mining method. Blast-hole drilling would utilize electric-hydraulic, 
two-boom, jumbos. Rock loading would be performed with 9 to10 cy LHD's, which 
would move the blasted rock from the faces, or muck bays, to rock passes that would 
transfer the blasted rock to the haulage level. Fifty-ton haulage trucks would move the 
rock from the passes to grizzlies, equipped with a rock breaker, located on each

haulage level, approximately 1,300 ft from the shaft. The broken rock would pass 
through the grizzlies to 60-inch jaw crushers, be reduced to a nominal 6-inch product, 
and then be moved via an inclined conveyor to a 4,000 ton storage pocket located 
adjacent to the production shaft. Fifty-five ton skips would move the rock through the 
shaft to the surface. 
 
 When a 20 ft lift has been exploited, bulkheads will be installed to contain an 
engineered backfill consisting of deslimed mill tailings, classified mine waste, fly ash, 
and cement. When this backfill has consolidated, the next lift can be started on the top 
of the previously-excavated lift. The use of an engineered backfill will allow smaller 
pillars than would normally be allowed, to be left. This will optimize mining recovery of 
material from each of the deposits. In addition, by returning a large portion of the mill 
tailings back into the mine, the surface tailings impoundment size, and cost, can be 
minimized.    
 
 In general, the rocks at Copper Creek are very strong, with an average 
compressive strength of 10,000 to 20,000 psi, and a median RQD's in the range of 80 
to 90 percent. The phreatic surface has been interpreted to be at the level of the San 
Pedro river, which is around the 2,000 ft elevation. The surface elevation over the 
deposits is around the 4,200 ft elevation, with the upper limit of reasonably contiguous 
mineralization in both deposits being around the 2,000 ft elevation. The better 
mineralization, in the both deposits, continues downward to approximately the 500 ft 
elevation. Preliminary geotechnical investigations indicate that rooms 20 ft wide and 
20 ft high can be excavated in the rocks in the Mammoth-Keel and AE deposits, 
leaving 20 ft square pillars for initial support. This would result in a mining recovery of 
75 percent. The RQD's in the breccias (Mammoth/Childs) are somewhat less, thusly 
CNI has recommended leaving 25 ft x 25 ft pillars in these areas, resulting in an overall 
recovery there of 65 percent.  
 
 The upper (above the 3500L) Childs, Prince, and Globe breccias deposits would 
be developed and mined by the previously-proposed decline and access drifts, with a 
cut and fill mining method. A third, 16 ft diameter, ventilation shaft, as previously 
discussed, would be located adjacent to the upper Childs deposit access. 
 
1.5 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
 

A conceptual process flowsheet was developed for processing 25,000 tons per 
day with an overall availability factor of 92.5 percent. The process design incorporates 
modern equipment where applicable. For example, larger flotation cells have been 
selected for the rougher flotation with vertical mills for the regrinding circuit. Designs 
incorporated in this study are considered standard mining industry practice.  

 
Locked cycle flotation tests conducted by Mountain States R&D International, 

Inc. (MSRDI) on the average grade composites showed copper recovery above 95 
percent and copper concentrate grades between 32 and 62 percent. Molybdenum

recoveries were proportional to the molybdenum head grade with the high-grade 
sample giving 94 percent recovery and the low-grade sample giving 28 percent 
recovery. 

 
In year 2012, METCON Research (METCON) conducted open cycle copper-

molybdenum second cleaner flotation testing using the scheme of reagents developed 
by MSRDI on 14 composite samples representing different zones from the Copper 
Creek Project. The composite samples were identified as follows: 

 
 Composite 1 - Copper Grade  in the 0.2  to 0.3 Percent Range 
 Composite 2 - Chalcopyrite Dominant ≥ 0.2 to 0.5 Percent Copper 
 Composite 3 - Chalcopyrite Dominant ≥ 0.5 Percent Copper

The following comments relate to the open cycle copper-molybdenum second 
cleaner flotation tests on composite samples from Copper Creek Project. 

 
 Copper recovery obtained ranged from approximately 77 percent to 93 

percent. The highest copper recovery of approximately 93 percent was 
observed on Composite 10. 

 
 The lowest copper recovery of approximately 77 percent was obtained on 

Composite 5. 
 
 Molybdenum recovery ranged from approximately 38 to 97 percent. 

Composite 14 provided the highest molybdenum recovery of approximately 
97 percent. 

 
 The lowest molybdenum recovery of approximately 38 percent was obtained 

on Composite 9. 
 
 Complete mass balances for gold and silver were conducted on Composites 

9 through 14. 
 
 Additional locked cycle flotation testing should be conducted to determine 

the ultimate concentrate and tailing values that will be realized when internal 
products are recycled as occurs in normal plant practice. 

 
1.6 Tailings Storage Facility 
 
 The proposed mining operation will process 25,000 tons per day with 
approximately 50 percent of the process tailings used for underground mine backfill. 
The tailings storage facility (TSF) will be required to contain approximately 15,750 tons 
per day of tailings, including fine rejects from the hydraulic backfill operation (cyclone 
overflow), and whole tailings when the backfill plant is not in operations. 
   
 A TSF site with a capacity of approximately 90 million tons has been identified 
on State of Arizona land approximately 4.2 miles west of the proposed Saloon Gulch 
shaft site. The foundation of the facility is composed on alluvial gravels. As such, 
borrow materials, for embankment construction, are anticipated to be readily available 
locally. 
 
 TSFs for base metal mining projects in Arizona typically employ an earthen 
starter dam followed by upstream construction of subsequent raises using tailings 
sand. Because the TSF will be required to contain fine rejects from the backfill plant, 
the conventional construction approach is not considered. The preliminary layout of the 
tailings impoundment assumes a dam constructed with borrowed fill material by the 
downstream raise method. This downstream construction method can be used to 
construct a stable TSF dam regardless of the characteristics of the tailings, however;

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13   

that method required more embankment fill material. Subject to testing and 
demonstration of feasibility, the currently proposed design approach could potentially 
be modified to reduce embankment fill requirements and construction costs. 
 
1.7 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact 
 
1.7.1 Hydrology and Geochemistry 
 
 Building on previous hydrological studies conducted within 1/2-mile of the 
proposed mine site, Golder Associates conducted a regional hydrogeological 
investigation and well siting study incorporating major hydrogeological regions of the 
San Pedro river basin including areas with historic high yield deep production wells.  
 
 The lower San Pedro river basin contains two major water-bearing units:  the 
streambed Holocene alluvium that forms the San Pedro River channel and floodplain, 
and the alluvial basin fill deposits that are composed of a younger basin-fill, older 
basin-fill, and a basal conglomerate. The basin-fill deposits form the basin's primary 
aquifer because of their high permeability and large groundwater storage. However 
due to recent surface water adjudication, water rights, and permitting issues, 
groundwater from the upper San Pedro River aquifer including its base flow (Holocene 
alluvium) should not be considered as potential supply water for the Copper Creek 
project. The Golder study concentrated on the lower basin fill groundwater that is 
believed to be hydrologically isolated from the San Pedro River Holocene alluvial 
system, and identified four locations for potential siting of production wells. 
 
 Geochemical analysis of the mine development rock from the Mammoth and 
Childs-Aldwinkle breccia areas indicate that the country rock in the vicinity of the initial 
breccia mining operation has a low potential for acid generation, and drainage from the 
development rock is expected to be of good quality. Similar testing has not been 
performed for development rock in the vicinity of the deeper porphyry mineralization of 
the Keel and American Eagle deposits. Future development rock is likely to be 
consumed in mining backfill operations. Analysis of the geochemical properties of the 
future tailings has not been performed, though the potential for acid generation and/or 
leachable arsenic could lead to a requirement for lined tailings disposal facilities to 
mitigate impacts to water resources.   
 
1.7.2 Environmental Permitting 
 
 Environmental permitting for the project will be required at the state and federal 
level. Some key considerations with regard to cost and schedule include: 
 

▪ Proximity (less than 2 miles) of the Galiuro Wilderness Area, a Class I air 
shed 

 
▪ Significant historic mining features throughout the project area 



Redhawk Copper, Inc. - Copper Creek PEA 25,000 TPD Mill Page 18 
 
 

 
 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July 2013 

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13   

 
▪ Significant NEPA review requirements and associated public involvement 

 
 In addition, the project has several favorable attributes from a permitting 
perspective, including proximity to existing mining districts and associated 
infrastructure, and remoteness from residential and urban centers. 
 
1.7.2.1 Federal Permitting 
 
 Because significant portions of the project are located on lands managed by the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM), it is assumed for this evaluation that a Mine Plan 
of Operations (MPO) will be required for development of the project. Once the MPO 
has been submitted, the BLM will begin its review process under NEPA. Given the size 
of the proposed project and recent NEPA evaluations for other mining projects, it is 
assumed for the purposes of this analysis that an EIS will be required. Following 
submittal of the MPO, public scoping will be initiated by the lead federal agency (in this 
case, BLM) in order to identify potential environmental concerns, or issues. 
Alternatives to the proposed action will be developed by the BLM, in part from the 
issues identified during scoping. Given the potentially significant processing times for 
the NEPA effort, it is advisable to approach the BLM as early in the permitting process 
as possible. 
 
 With regard to Clean Air Act (CAA) permitting,  the project area is less than two 
miles from the Galiuro Wilderness Area, a Class I airshed. CAA permitting would 
consist of application for a new Title V permit for a new mill; no other aspects of the 
project are anticipated to require permitting of air emissions. The Title V permit 
application for this facility would be subject to preconstruction review under the New 
Source Review provisions, and the permit would have to comply with the Arizona 
regional haze SIP. 
 
  A Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404 permit is required if a project will result 
in the discharge of dredged or fill material into jurisdictional waters of the U.S. (waters). 
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) administers the Section 404 program. The 
definition of waters is broad; the Corps has commonly asserted jurisdiction over the 
typically dry arroyos or washes found throughout Arizona. Guidance related to the 
identification of waters was promulgated in 2007 (and revised in 2008) which has had 
the effect of limiting the scope of Corps jurisdiction over some ephemeral washes. A 
jurisdictional waters determination will be completed for the Copper Creek Project area 
to determine the extent of Corps jurisdiction, though it is anticipated that at the very 
least Copper Creek itself is likely jurisdictional. Given the proposed impacts to Copper 
Creek, it is reasonable to assume that an Individual Permit will be required for the 
project. Significant components of the Individual Permit include the 404(b)(1) 
alternatives analysis and habitat mitigation and monitoring plan. Once the jurisdictional 
waters determination has been completed and approved by the Corps, the scope of

 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July 2013 

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13   

the Section 404 permitting effort will be determined. Again, it is anticipated that an 
individual permit will be required. 
 
 Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires that, for any federally 
permitted action, the permitting authority must evaluate the potential impact of a 
project to federally listed species, and if an impact is anticipated, consult with the 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). For the development of the Copper 
Creek Project, consultation with USFWS would be required for either the CWA Section 
404 permit or the Mine Plan of Operations for the BLM. It is anticipated that the BLM 
would act as the lead federal agency for the purpose of the Section 7 consultation. 
Given the location of the project area and the nature of the onsite habitat, three 
federally listed species are anticipated to have a reasonable potential to occur on the 
project area:  southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus; SWWF), 
lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae; LLNB), and Chiricahua leopard 
frog (Rana chiricahuensis). In addition, the Sonoran desert tortoise (Gopherus 
morafkai) is a candidate for listing, which may be listed as soon as 2015.  
 
 As with the ESA, federal permitting authorities are required to evaluate the 
potential for any proposed project to adversely impact properties listed, or eligible for 
listing, on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). A large portion of the 
project area has been surveyed for cultural resources. A number of the historic mining 
features within the project area have been identified by archaeological consultants as 
eligible for listing, either separately or as a single site. Any adverse effects to these 
features would require consultation and, likely, mitigation. 
 
1.7.2.2 State Permitting 
 
 In general, an Aquifer Protect Permit (APP) will be required for any activities or 
facilities that may result in a discharge of a contaminant to an aquifer, including tailings 
and waste rock facilities, and non-stormwater impoundments. A review of the APP 
permitting materials for AMT's project indicates that AMT was expecting to encounter 
some acid-generating waste rock that would need to be temporarily stockpiled on the 
surface. They had agreed to routinely sample, segregate and special-handle this 
material, to stockpile it on a constructed foundation, and then return it to the excavation 
site prior to 5 elapsed years. In addition, runoff diversion ditches associated with waste 
rock stockpiles were required to be lined. The APP process can be time and labor 
intensive, and for mining projects generally requires extensive hydrologic 
characterization, engineering (i.e. BADCT demonstration), geochemical 
characterization, and reclamation design. Completion of the APP process can take up 
to two years, or more. 
 
 In 2011, Redhawk acquired right-of-way access across lands managed by the 
Arizona State Land Department (ASLD) in support of the development of the 
exploration decline near a minor tributary of Saloon Gulch. The right-of-way includes 
the majority of Copper Creek Road as well as the construction of a new all-weather

access road that avoids Copper Creek itself. For the larger mine, it is assumed that the 
access roads will need to be upgraded beyond what is considered in the current ASLD 
right-of-way in order to accommodate the anticipated increase in the volume and type 
of traffic required for the mining effort. In that case, a revision to the right-of-way will be 
required through coordination with ASLD. As part of the right-of-way application 
process, a native plant inventory and cultural resources survey will be required. 
 
 The State of Arizona requires that mining projects greater than five (5) 
contiguous acres on private lands submit a reclamation plan to the State Mine 
Inspectors Office. This plan must outline planned reclamation activities and costs. The 
reclamation requirements under this program are different than those for the APP 
program, described above. 
 

The Copper Creek operations are currently covered under the Arizona Pollutant 
Discharge Elimination System (AZPDES) Multi-Sector General Permit (MSGP-2010) 
Storm water program administered by the Arizona Department of Environmental 
Quality (ADEQ), for the historic mining operations within the project area. It is 
anticipated that the proposed project will not require coverage under an individual 
AZPDES permit. 
 
 Critical path items related to environmental permitting for the project are: 
 

▪ BLM Approvals (including NEPA, ESA, and NHPA compliance), 
▪ Clean Air Act permitting 
▪ CWA Section 404 permit (including NEPA, ESA, and NHPA compliance), 
▪ Aquifer Protection Permit 

 
 In general, other approvals are readily acquired within the critical path. 
 
1.8 Capital Cost 
 
1.8.1 Mining 
 
 The capital required to develop and sustain a 25,000 ton per day Post-Pillar Cut 
& Fill mining operation for extracting Copper Creek material from the Childs, 
Mammoth, Keel, and American Eagle deposits has been estimated to a +/- 35 percent 
accuracy. These costs are presented in first quarter 2013 US dollars. 
 
 The costs are based on unit prices applied to estimated development quantities, 
recent equipment quotes from mining equipment manufactures, and labor cost build-
ups for the mine site location, similar installations, and in-house information on labor 
productivities for large-tonnage underground room and pillar operations.

1.9 Operating Cost 
 
1.9.1 Mining 
 
 Mine operating costs have been estimated, based on producing 25,000 tons per 
day, using a post-pillar cut and fill mining method, from four separate deposits, 
simultaneously. The estimate was based on prevailing wage rates in the U.S copper 
mining industry, and underground equipment operating costs in average ground 
conditions. An electric power cost of US$ 0.077/Kwh was used for estimating power 
costs. All costs are in first quarter of 2013 US dollars. A summary of this estimate is 
provided in the following Table 1.7.

Project. Pre-production capital cost of US$ 857.1 million and sustaining capital and 
closure costs of US$ 342.8 million were estimated. The pre-tax economic parameters 
at various discount rates are summarized in Table 1.9. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table1.9 above assumes values of US$ 3.00 per lb of copper, US$ 12.00 per lb 

of molybdenum, and US$ 20.00 per ounce of silver. Economics of the project are 
highly leveraged to copper price. 
 
 Additional details concerning the pre-tax cash flow analysis are found in 
Section 22. 
 
1.11 Conclusions and Opportunities  
 
 The following measures are recommended in order to improve the economic 
viability of the project: 
 
1.11.1 Mining 
 

Additional exploration drilling to fill in gaps in the existing resource; 
 

▪ Create larger, more consistent, above cutoff grade mining areas 
▪ Increase current resource Measured and Indicated tons 
▪ Convert Current Inferred tons to Measured and Indicated tons 
▪ Potential to improve grades 
▪ Potential to find additional deposits and expand existing deposits 

 
Additional exploration in the many unexplored breccias pipes that exist in the 

area; 
 

▪ Additional tons at higher grades 
▪ Potential for new mining areas, at shallower depths 

 
Perform additional deep exploration;

11.11.2 Milling 
 

Further Metallurgical Testing and studies are recommended to improve; 
 
▪ Plant Design 
▪ Recovery 
▪ Concentrate Grade 
▪ Operating Costs - additional studies are required to attempt to reduce power 

consumption since this will be a significant operating cost. 
 

1.11.3 Infrastructure 
 

▪ Power: The option for on-site power generation was considered; however, 
the cost associated with the supply and transportation of natural gas to the 
mine site and installing a gas turbine engine power generation system on 
site requires a detailed study. 

 
▪ Water Supply: The investigation of a source for mine water is in progress. 

The well field target has been selected in the alluvial pediment of Galiuro 
Mountains to the west of the mining area on state owned land. The proposed 
well field is located in the vicinity of an existing state-owned well where 
preliminary pumping tests yielded encouraging results. 

 
▪ Access Road: Currently there is an unpaved dirt road access to the 

proposed mine and mill site. For this study it was assumed that this 10 mile 
access road will be upgraded and paved to improve access to the plant site.  

 
1.11.4  Tailings Storage Facility 
 

There is potential to mine the upper portion of the Old Reliable by open pit 
methods. The use of mine waste rock for TSF embankment fill could potentially reduce 
fill costs and decrease the disturbance area associated with fill borrow and waste rock 
disposal.   

 
 The evaluation of future tailings properties could demonstrate the feasibility of 
alternative construction methods for TSF embankment raises. Upstream or centerline 
dam raises could reduce embankment fill requirements in later TSF construction 
phases. Alternative construction methods will have no impact on initial capital costs, 
however; sustaining capital costs could be significant reduced if fill requirements are 
reduced.

information, the claims and leases appear to be in good standing as of the date of this 
report.  
 
 To renew unpatented claims, an Annual Maintenance Fee of US$ 140 per claim 
levied by the Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) must be paid on or before 
1 September each year. The current annual maintenance cost of the unpatented claims 
is approximately US$ 106,120. In addition, there is a small yearly County filing fee for 
the unpatented claims. There are currently twelve Arizona State mineral exploration 
permits that belong to the Copper Creek landholdings. These permits are valid for five 
years, assuming the work requirements are fulfilled each year. All twelve leases, which 
expire mid-2016, are in the name of Redhawk Copper, Inc. There is a renewal fee of 
US$ 100 each per year. In addition, there is a fieldwork requirement due (or cash in lieu 
of work) for each lease, and that is in the amount of US$ 10 per acre for years 2 and 3 
and US$ 20 per acre for years 4 and 5. The fifteen permits encompass a total of 
4,490.61 acres. The work must be done on these permits, or approximately US$ 44,491 
must be paid as cash in lieu. The patented claims and some of the unpatented claims 
have been surveyed; the permits have not been surveyed (their location is determined 
by a legal description (i.e. Section, Range, Township, etc). Annual property taxes to 
Pinal County are currently US$ 9,667. Surface title over the area of the Federal 
unpatented claims is comprised of BLM, State of Arizona Lands, and private ownership 
under the Stock Raising Homestead Act. State exploration permits are under State of 
Arizona jurisdiction. Unpatented mining claims are under BLM jurisdiction. The surface 
title over the patented claims is held by Redhawk Copper, Inc. The surface access to 
carry out work to the BLM and State land is through normal BLM and State permitting 
procedures respectively.

5.0   ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 
 The Copper Creek Property is located in a ranching and mining area about 75 
road miles northeast of Tucson, Arizona. Tucson is a major population center and 
transportation hub with well-developed infrastructure and services to support the area 
mines. Access to the property from Tucson is by paved highway 65 miles to the 
property road junction, then 10 miles on gravel road to the site. The driving time from 
Tucson to the site is approximately two hours. A network of ranch and mine roads 
provides access to most parts of the property.  
 
 The Copper Creek Property is located in rugged terrain of the eastern Basin and 
Range physiographic province of South Eastern Arizona. Elevations on the property 
range from 3,400 ft to 4,900 ft above mean sea level.  
 
 Climate varies with elevation, but over most of the property summers are hot and 
dry and winters are mild. Data collected over a fifty-year period at a weather station 
approximately 10 miles from site at an elevation of 3,500 ft indicates the average 
summer temperatures range from a low of 67.4oF at night to a high of 96oF during the 
day. During winter, average temperatures range from a low of 35.7oF at night to a high 
of 61.8oF during the day. The lowest temperature recorded was 12oF and the highest 
recorded temperature was 111oF. Precipitation data collected from the same weather 
site indicates the average annual rainfall ranges from 6.3 to 26.8 inches and averages 
13.8 inches per year. A rain gauge maintained on Copper Creek since 1987 recorded 
average annual rainfall of 13.0 inches in a range of 8.94 inches to 24.7 inches. 
Occasional light snow falls at higher elevations in the winter months. The average 
annual evaporation rate, approximately 90 inches per year, greatly exceeds the average 
annual precipitation rate.    
 
 Vegetation, including various cactus, mesquite and palo verde trees, grasses and 
scrub brush, are common in the area.   
 
 The area has an exceptionally well-developed mining infrastructure. BHP's San 
Manuel operation was located approximately 10 miles to the west of Copper Creek. This 
operation was shutdown in 2001, but substantial infrastructure including roads, power, 
and towns are available near Copper Creek. The large operating mine-concentrator-
smelter complex owned by Asarco (Grupo Mexico SA) is located at Hayden, 30 miles to 
the northwest of Copper Creek. Other similar facilities are located throughout Arizona.  
 
 The previous property operator carried out ground water studies and determined 
that adequate water for exploration drilling and any possible future mining operation 
may be obtained from wells on or near the property.

6.0   HISTORY 
 
6.1 The Early Years 
 
 According to old reports, some rich lead-silver ore was mined from the Bluebird 
vein as early as 1863; however, the Bunker Hill (Copper Creek) mining district was not 
organized until 1883, after completion of the transcontinental Southern Pacific railroad 
(1880). Some ore was shipped from the Bluebird vein during the 1880s silver boom, 
Claims were staked to cover copper deposits prior to 1900, but little work was done in 
the district until after 1902. Principal freight access was over the crest of the Galiuro 
Mountains, to Wilcox. 
 
 In 1903, Copper Creek Mining Company acquired claims covering narrow 
copper-silver veins in Tertiary-age volcanic rocks near the headwaters of Copper Creek 
and later acquired ground along Copper Creek, as far west as the Laramide age Old 
Reliable pipe deposit. The wagon road from Mammoth to Copper Creek reportedly was 
constructed in 1908; this provided more favorable freight haul after the railroad 
extended to Winkleman in 1911. By 1913, the Copper Creek Mining Company and its 
successors (the Minnesota-Arizona Mining Company and Copper State Metals Mining 
Company) had constructed a dam, power plant, dispensary and 200 ton per day gravity 
concentrator in the vicinity of Post Office Point. They had developed and mined a small, 
tabular breccia ore body at American Eagle; the Old Reliable pipe deposit was partially 
developed for mining and was connected to the concentrator with about two miles of 
narrow gauge railroad. By the end of 1913, the company was in default and employees 
were working the Old Reliable to recover unpaid wages. The company was refinanced 
in 1914 and operated at Old Reliable where about 30,000 tons were produced prior to 
shutdown in 1919. The Old Reliable claim group was surveyed for patent in 1919. 
 
 Commencing in 1907, the Calumet and Arizona Mining Company (C & A), guided 
by Ira Joralemon, explored the Copper Giant, Copper Prince, Glory Hole (Globe), and 
Superior pipes by adits, shafts and drifts. To supplement the underground exploration, 
C & A drilled about 6,000 ft in fourteen surface holes, during 1914. A copper resource 
was found in both the Glory Hole and Prince pipes, but there was no production. The 
C & A group of 26 claims was surveyed for patent between 1908 and 1919; title passed 
to Phelps Dodge Corporation in 1931 when it purchased the Calumet and Arizona 
company. The only recorded production from the C & A ground has been by Arizona 
Molybdenum Corporation which mined and milled 23,312 tons from the Copper Prince 
pipe with average grade of 3.19 percent copper, during 1937. Written logs of the C & A 
drill holes reside in Redhawk's files, but core has not been located.  
 

C & A holes are numbered DH-1 through DH-14. 
  
 An adit, driven below the outcrops of the Childs Aldwinkle pipes in 1915, 
discovered the copper-molybdenum ore body there and the pipes were partly developed 
for production during 1917-1918; the claims were surveyed in 1916 and patented in

1919. Arizona Molybdenum Corporation acquired the property in 1933 and proceeded 
to develop the copper and molybdenum ore body to 520 ft below the haulage level. The 
old Arizona-Minnesota Mining Company gravity concentrator was converted to flotation; 
about 350 tons per day were processed. In 1935, a new flotation concentrator was 
constructed on the Childs Aldwinkle property, near the portal of the haulage adit; about 
300 tons per day were processed there. Between 1933 and 1938, about 329,000 tons 
were milled. Leasers worked the mine in 1939 and again during 1957-1965. At some 
time prior to 1957, the Childs Aldwinkle winze was extended to 680 ft below the haulage 
adit; the 680 level was developed and six short holes were drilled there by Inspiration 
Consolidated Copper Company; Magma Copper Company obtained logs of these holes 
from Inspiration in 1967. These logs are in Redhawk's files, but the core has not been 
located. 
 
 Holes drilled by Inspiration at Childs Aldwinkle:  H-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 
 
 During his work at Copper Creek for C & A, Ira Joralemon postulated that the 
area between the chalcocite-enriched Old Reliable and Glory Hole pipes may be 
underlain by a chalcocite blanket of commercial tenor. In the late 1940's, Copper Creek 
Consolidated Mining Company (Morris Elsing) secured the patented claims at Old 
Reliable and, during 1950, drilled four holes with a churn-drill to disprove Joralemon's 
idea. Copper Creek consolidated held the Old Reliable property, without recorded 
production, until about 1954. 
 
 Holes drilled by Morris Elsing near Old Reliable:  CDH-1, 2, 3, 4 
 
6.2 The Modern Era 
 
 In 1956, Siskon Corporation acquired ground that had been part of the more 
westerly properties of the old Copper State Metals Mining Company, most in Sections 
10, 11 and 14. Siskon's principal interest was the Old Reliable mine. The Old Reliable 
had been rehabilitated and sampled in 1942 and 1943 by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and 
very encouraging results reported in RI 4006 (1947). Siskon drilled 21 diamond core 
holes from the 100 and 200 levels of the Old Reliable mine. Neither logs nor core are 
available.

OR1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18; SW-1, 2, 3 

 
 In 1959, Bear Creek Mining Company (Kennecott) optioned the Siskon ground 
and also the Childs Aldwinkle patented claims. Bear Creek mounted the first integrated 
exploration (geologic mapping, geochemical and geophysical surveys, followed by 
drilling), at Copper Creek. Fifteen holes were drilled there by Bear Creek and several of 
these cut mineralized zones. However, none of the Bear Creek intersections appeared 
to be minable and they abandoned the project in 1962. The Bear Creek drill core was 
stored in a cabin at the Old Reliable under care of watchman Pete Carey. This core was

 In 1966, Newmont Exploration Limited (NEL) optioned the Siskon property and 
enlisted Magma Copper Company (80.3 percent owned by Newmont Mining 
Corporation) as co-venture and operator. The Childs Aldwinkle patented claims were 
also optioned, as were adjacent claims owned by Clark, Downey and Lehman as well 
as the patented Redbird claims (Bluebird Mine). Additional claims were located to cover 
open Federal land and State land was leased. Exploration was directed toward 
discovery of a major disseminated copper deposit; breccia pipes were not a primary 
target. Between 1966 and 1970, geology of the district was mapped and 30 deep core 
holes were drilled. Core from these and all other JV holes drilled at Copper Creek was 
stored in a warehouse at Magma's plant at San Manuel, until June, 2005. This work 
demonstrated a significant copper-mineralized zone, at depth, beneath the American 
Eagle Area. Magma became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont in 1969.

 Although Newmont acquired the Siskon ground in 1966, Siskon retained the right 
to deal separately with the upper part of the Old Reliable pipe and certain adjacent 
claims, for a period of 15 years. In 1968, Occidental Minerals Corporation (Oxymin) 
leased that ground from Siskon and also optioned part of the adjacent Phelps Dodge 
ground that covered the mineralized Glory Hole, Copper Prince and Copper Giant 
pipes. The old workings that C & A had driven to test the (Phelps Dodge) pipes were 
rehabilitated above the water table and Oxymin drilled 67 surface and underground 
holes to test the Old Reliable, Glory Hole, Prince and Giant pipes. Oxymin released 
their option on the Phelps Dodge ground in about 1970. Redhawk has copies of Oxymin 
core logs, but no logs for percussion holes; location of the core is not known.

 Oxymin, in 1971, assigned their interest in the Old Reliable to Ranchers 
Exploration and Mining Company. Ranchers drilled three holes to confirm results of 
Oxymin drill holes; logs of the Ranchers holes are in Redhawk's file, but location of the 
core is not known. In 1972, Ranchers, in association with Du Pont, rubblized the Old 
Reliable pipe above the 3730 elevation, by blasting with ANFO. Copper was leached 
from this rubble-column with dilute sulfuric acid; copper was recovered from the leach-
liquors by precipitation on tin-cans in a plant below the mine. More than 12,077,000 
pounds of cement copper were recovered between 1972 and 1981, when Ranchers' 
lease expired.

 In the years 1972 - 1974, after retrieving its property from Oxymin, Phelps Dodge 
(now Freeport Copper & Gold, Inc.) geologists mapped, sampled and tested the Phelps 
Dodge ground with geophysics; nine holes were drilled to test deep targets, with 
disappointing results. Phelps Dodge did not explore the pipe deposits on its ground.  
Redhawk has copies of the Phelps Dodge drill hole logs. Phelps Dodge has the core.

 Humble Oil joined Newmont and Magma in exploration for porphyry copper 
deposits at Copper Creek in 1971. Humble assumed project management during 1971-
1972, their "earn-in" period and drilled 20 deep holes. It was Humble-Newmont hole HN-
12 that discovered the third (north) finger of the Childs Aldwinkle pipe. Redhawk has 
both logs and core.

 Humble Oil was renamed Exxon Corporation in about 1973. In 1979, Exxon, at 
their sole cost, drilled a hole to test a geological theory that was advanced by their 
exploration management (but failed to find ore). Redhawk has both log and core.

 Newmont resumed management of the Copper Creek Joint Venture in 1973 and 
drilled six angled holes from surface to test pipe targets. However, by the mid-1970s, 
Newmont's corporate interest in porphyry copper exploration had waned. The Copper 
Creek project reverted to care and maintenance; drill targets were carefully selected, 
but drilling was reduced to the amount needed to underwrite property maintenance 
costs. Hole NE-6 discovered the lower Mammoth feeder-zone and hole NE-10 
discovered the Mammoth breccia pipe. Redhawk has both logs and core for these 
holes. Between 1972 and 1977, the joint venture surveyed for patent claims on public 
domain that would be interior to a crack-line projected at 45 degrees from the bottom of 
the American Eagle deposit. This survey was filed with the BLM but the claims were not 
patented. Exxon ceased contributing to the joint venture in 1985 and withdrew in 1987.

 When Newmont distributed Magma's equity to Newmont's shareholders in 1987, 
Newmont's ownership interest in properties at Copper Creek was incorporated into 
Magma and Magma became an independent company. Magma's management had little 
interest in exploration at Copper Creek; they reduced the size of the property package, 
but held the core property. Magma met the requirement for assessment expenditure by 
drilling three holes. Redhawk has logs and drill core for these holes.

6.3 Work At Copper Creek By AMT (USA) Inc. 
 
 Arizona Mineral Technology (Kushal Singh) finalized an agreement to acquire the 
Copper Creek property from Magma in 1994. Singh's company was renamed AMT 
International Mining Corporation when it was incorporated in Canada. 
 
 Between 1960 and 1995 when AMT became active at Copper Creek, more than 
77 deep holes had been drilled there by major copper companies and large amounts of 
geological, geophysical, geochemical and other analytical data had been generated by

them. These explorers were searching for a major porphyry copper deposit; the 
mineralized pipes were too small to interest these major companies. 
 
 AMT began field investigations at Copper Creek in the spring of 1995; the 
relatively shallow mineralized pipes were favored targets for AMT. Claims were staked 
to recover the ground dropped by Magma and to fill fractions. Agreements to acquire 
the Bell (Ryland) ranch and the Mercer ranch were signed. An agreement was signed 
with Phelps Dodge Exploration Corporation to obtain an interest in their patented claim 
block. AMT obtained a prospecting permit for State lands in the south half of Section 2, 
near the Bluebird mine. 
  
 Access and drill roads were repaired and a new access road was constructed 
from Saloon Gulch to the top of White Bear hill. 
 
 During May and June 1995, AMT drilled nine reverse circulation (RC) holes at 
Old Reliable to confirm that leaching by Ranchers had not significantly depleted the 
chalcocite ore body there. In addition, three RC holes were drilled at Old Reliable in 
June 1996 and 20 RC holes were drilled there in January through March, 1997. Six of 
these vertical RC holes were extended with the core drill to test the deposit below the 
rubble column. These holes plus pre-AMT holes and rock sample assays comprise the 
data-base from which the resource in the Old Reliable pipe has been estimated.

 AMT drilled 40,135 ft in 37 angled diamond core holes to test the Childs 
Aldwinkle pipe above 2800 elevation, in March through September, 1996. These 
westerly-directed holes were drilled from four surface sites, east of the Childs Aldwinkle 
glory-holes. In addition, 3580 ft were drilled in nine RC holes to test the top of the blind 
north finger of the pipe and three vertical core holes were drilled to obtain metallurgical 
test samples. These holes, plus pre-AMT holes, comprise the data-base from which the 
resource in the Childs Aldwinkle pipe deposit has been estimated.

 In the years 1976 through 1982, Newmont drilled two core holes beneath the 
south wall of Copper Creek canyon, almost directly beneath the prior location of the 
Arizona Molybdenum Corporation concentrator. Both of these holes cut mineralized 
intervals, of potential ore-grade. The near surface intercept in hole NE-10 was similar to 
other copper-mineralized breccia-pipe deposits in the area, but the deeper intercepts in 
hole NE-6 were pervasive sericite-chalcopyrite replacement of granodiorite. Follow-up 
holes drilled by AMT, 37,578 ft in 24 angled and seven vertical holes, defined the 
Mammoth breccia, a pipe-form, quartz-chalcopyrite veinlet stockwork deposit with 
N25W elongation; potentially economic parts of the pipe, bottom above the 2800 
elevation. These 31 core holes drilled by AMT, plus Newmont's hole NE-10, comprise 
the data-base from which the Mammoth pipe resource was estimated. 
 
 Holes drilled by AMT to test the Mammoth pipe: 
  CK32+0, 33+1Y, 33+3Y, 34.5-50, 35+3Y, 35.5-50, 36+0, 37+100, 37+50

 During November, 1996, hole VIX 28-2 extended through the relatively shallow 
Mammoth pipe and into sericite-chalcopyrite rock, similar to the deep mineral intercept 
in Newmont hole NE-6. The similarity between these mineral intercepts, about 700 ft 
apart, stimulated drilling of holes to test the continuity of the intervening "Lower 
Mammoth" (LM) mineralized zone. The Lower Mammoth deposit is a steep, N25W- 
trending, altered and mineralized sheared zone that clearly has fed mineralizing fluids 
upward, into the Mammoth pipe. In addition to Newmont's hole NE-6, the Lower 
Mammoth zone has been tested by an additional 13 holes drilled by AMT; it is, however, 
incompletely drilled at this juncture. The limited current information indicates potentially 
economic parts of the Lower Mammoth feeder zone tops near 2400 elevation; it 
appears to have reasonable continuity for at least 700 ft along strike, to be open 
downward and to the southeast. Both tenor and thickness appear to increase toward the 
south, where thickness of the zone probably exceeds 100 ft.

  LM-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 
 
 In addition to holes drilled to test the four major ore bodies described previously, 
AMT drilled a number of core and RC holes to test other mineral occurrences at Copper 
Creek. Some of these holes returned interesting (but generally sub-economic) assays 
that warrant follow-up. Hole logs, split drill core and RC cuttings trays are in possession 
of Redhawk.

 AMT mounted a staggered, 200 ft grid, which covered much of the productive 
ground at Copper Creek. This grid was used to guide collection of geochemical 
samples, ground magnetic and radiometric surveys. The exploration survey data is in 
files controlled by Redhawk and warrants study.   
 
 AMT exhausted its financial resources in 2001 and ceased all exploration. 
Norshield Investments, AMT's primary creditor, advanced funds necessary to maintain 
the key properties at Copper Creek, but agreements to secure the "Ryland" ranch, the 
Mercer Ranch, the Phelps Dodge claims and Downey's Moose claims were dropped.

 Redhawk Resources reviewed the project data in 2004. Redhawk acquired AMT's 
property at Copper Creek, as well as the drill core, rock samples and the accumulated 
project data, in 2005. Redhawk spent considerable time following the acquisition 
organizing and consolidating the available data and drill core. The core is now housed 
in a core storage facility at Redhawk's project office in San Manuel, Arizona. During the 
review of the drill core, it was discovered that some of the last holes drilled by AMT 
were not split or assayed. Redhawk has logged, split and assayed this core and the 
results were added to the data base.

 Redhawk commissioned Independent Mining Consultants, Inc. (IMC) to develop a 
resource estimate of four of the mineralized targets (Mammoth Breccia, Childs-
Aldwinkle Breccia, Old Reliable Breccia and the Lower Mammoth – Keel deposit) on the 
Copper Creek ground. IMC's work started in March 2006 and a resource was 
announced in September 2006. The NI 43-101 Technical Document for this resource is 
titled "Copper Creek Property Mineral Resource, Pinal County, Arizona, USA, Technical 
Document", dated October 31, 2006 and filed on SEDAR on November 8, 2006. 
 
 Redhawk commenced a drilling program in 2006 in the Mammoth Breccia deposit 
and in the breccia pipes located on the claims acquired from Phelps Dodge Corporation. 
 
 In 2007, Redhawk commissioned IMC to develop a resource estimate for the 
American Eagle deposit to report the resource and to provide guidance to Redhawk's 
drilling in the American Eagle. The resources are documented in the IMC's NI 43-101 
Technical Report titled "American Eagle Deposit Mineral Resource, Copper Creek 
Property, Pinal Country, Arizona, USA, Technical Report" dated November 26, 2007 
and filed on SEDAR on November 29, 2007. 
 
 In late 2007 and early 2008 Redhawk completed twelve rotary hammer pre-collar 
holes totaling 18,024 feet in the American Eagle area. One pre-collar drill hole was 
deepened 246 feet with core drilling and one core drill hole was completed from surface 
to a depth of 3,806 feet in the American Eagle area. Redhawk also drilled three core 
drill holes from surface totaling 10,975 feet. 
 
 Redhawk drilled twelve core holes totaling 3,800.4 feet from surface on the Copper 
Prince Breccias and three core holes from surface on the Globe Breccias totaling 1,220 
feet in early 2008. 
 
 IMC updated the property mineral resources in October 2008. This estimate 
included resources in the Globe and Copper Prince breccias for the first time. The 
resources are documented in the IMC's NI 43-101 Technical Report titled "Copper 
Creek 2008 Mineral Resource, Pinal Country, Arizona, USA, Technical Report" dated 
October 28, 2008 and filed on SEDAR on October 29, 2008. 
 
 Redhawk commissioned K D Engineering of Tucson to provide a scoping level 
economic study for the project in late 2009, based on the 2008 resource estimate. The 
NI 43-101 Technical Document for this resource is titled "Copper Creek Project 2,500 - 
10,000 TPD Scoping Study", dated March 12, 2010 and filed on SEDAR on May 12, 
2010. 
 
 Redhawk conducted a district exploration program in 2010 and early 2011. This 
program targeted previously six undrilled areas outside the existing breccia and 
porphyry resources which Redhawk judged prospective for potentially higher grade 
mineralization in mafic volcanic and diabase host rocks. Encouraging copper intercepts 
in hole REX-10-047 west of the Keel and American Eagle areas suggested the

possibility of extending these porphyry resources westward. Consequently, two 
additional angled holes were drilled from the same site. Drilling for the expanded eight-
hole program totaled 32,871 feet. A key result of the district exploration program was 
that it showed for the first time the scale of the Copper Creek sulfide system. These 
holes expanded the footprint of known porphyry-style alteration and sulfide 
mineralization from approximately 5,500 to 13,000 feet in the northwest-southeast 
direction.  
 
 Starting in February 2011, Redhawk embarked on a 100,000-foot (30,000 meter) 
program of in-fill and step-out drilling intended to upgrade a significant portion of the 
American Eagle and Keel porphyry resources from the 'Inferred' category to the 
'Measured and Indicated' category. In addition, the program was designed increase the 
size and confidence of the potential resource area connecting the Keel and American 
Eagle porphyry resources. Both objectives were successfully achieved. The program 
included both vertical and angled core holes, and completed core drilling from a number 
of rotary pre-collars drilled in 2007 and 2008. As of the end of July 2012, 77 holes (plus 
a wedge from one hole) totaling 190,388 feet had been completed by Redhawk on the 
project. 
 
 At Redhawk's request, IMC updated property-wide breccia and porphyry 
resources in April-May 2012, based on drilling through end-March, 2012. This NI 43-101 
compliant mineral resource estimate was announced in Redhawk's news release dated 
May 10, 2012, and forms the basis of the resource report titled "Copper Creek 2012 
Mineral Resource Update, Pinal County, Arizona, USA – Technical Report", dated June 
25, 2012. This resource estimate considered potential open-pit extraction of a much 
larger scale resource. 
 
 Redhawk and its consultants evaluated the opportunities of developing Copper 
Creek as either a large open pit at mill rates of 100,000 to 120,000 tons per day  or a 
large scale underground mine with mill rates in the 20,000 to 25,000 tons per day. To 
support the underground alternative, the Copper Creek mineral resource estimate was 
updated with any additional information to target an underground resource. The mineral 
resource estimate was revised for the Keel and American Eagle deposits based on 174 
drill holes (343,799 feet) and the mineral resource for the breccia deposits is based on 
the mineral resource announced in the October 28, 2008 Technical Report. This 
resource estimate was announced in the Redhawk press release dated December 19, 
2012 and is documented in the technical report titled "Copper Creek December 2012 
Mineral Resource - Pinal Country, Arizona, USA - Technical Report", dated January 31, 
2013. This mineral resource is the basis of the current PEA.

7.0   GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 
 The Copper Creek Property lies in the porphyry copper metallogenic province of 
the southwestern United States of America. 
 
7.1 Regional Geology 
 
 The regional basement consists of a variety of Proterozoic rocks that lie on the 
southern flank of the Achean craton of North America. During the Mesozoic Era, back 
arc and foreland basin volcanic and sedimentary formations covered much of southern 
Arizona. This Mesozoic event was succeeded by a Laramide age (Late Cretaceous - 
Early Tertiary; 80-50 Ma.) volcanic-plutonic arc event accompanied by a major ENE-
WSW compressional tectonic regime. This tectonism resulted in northwest-trending, 
basement sourced uplifted blocks and a widespread ENE-trending brittle structural 
fabric. The majority of porphyry copper deposits in the southwestern United States 
(including Copper Creek) date to this period of Laramide tectonism. Thick Galiuro 
Volcanics of mid-Tertiary age then covered the area and subsequent erosion has locally 
re-exposed the underlying copper-bearing bedrock. Figure 7.1 is a regional geologic 
map showing the geologic units by age. 
 
 The Copper Creek Property lies at the intersection of an ENE-trending belt of 
porphyry copper deposits, which include Ajo, Lakeshore, Silver Bell, San 
Manuel/Kalamazoo, Safford and Morenci, and a NNW-trending belt that includes 
Superior (Resolution), Ray, Christmas and Miami-Inspiration. Many of these deposits 
are tilted, faulted, and deeply eroded, but the Copper Creek porphyry system appears to 
be nearly upright and largely intact. Previous exploration and development have taken 
place on high level porphyry copper breccia pipes. Below these breccias, drilling has 
indicated an extensive porphyry copper-molybdenum mineralized system, which has 
been the focus of Redhawk's exploration in recent years.  
 
7.2 Copper Creek Geology 
 
 The Copper Creek district is centered on the Copper Creek granodiorite, the 
central of three Laramide granodiorite intrusions forming a northwest-oriented cluster on 
the west side of the Galiuro Mountains. The Copper Creek granodiorite was emplaced 
approximately 62 million years ago into Precambrian and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, 
Late Precambrian diabase, and Cretaceous Glory Hole volcanics. The Copper Creek 
stock and adjacent Glory Hole volcanics have been intruded by a sequence of Laramide 
granodiorite, monzogranite, and quartz diorite porphyry plugs and dykes. The district is 
marked by over 400 hydrothermal breccia bodies, ranging from a few feet to several 
hundred feet across, which (like the porphyry bodies) are concentrated in two 
northwest-trending belts. Post-mineral Galiuro Volcanics cover all these rocks on the 
east and northeast. To the southwest, the district is bounded by a northwest-trending 
range-front fault which downdrops Tertiary Gila Conglomerate against the Laramide and

7.3 Mineralization 
 
 The Copper Creek mineralization consists of chalcopyrite, bornite, and chalcocite. 
Copper oxide minerals locally replace sulfides in the near surface supergene 
weathering environment. A chalcocite enriched, supergene zone forms the principal part 
of the Old Reliable deposit above the water table. Molybdenite occurs in sufficient 
amounts in the Childs-Aldwinkle breccia, the Old Reliable breccia, the Keel, and the 
American Eagle to be of economic interest. Gold and silver occur but were not 
systematically assayed by previous owners. Redhawk has re-assayed individual 
intervals to better understand the precious metal grade distribution where previous 
owners had assayed long composite runs and routinely assays for silver in drilling. 
 
 Near-surface mineralization at Copper Creek occurs predominately in the breccia 
bodies and to a lesser extent in high angle "early halo" veins. Sulfides are concentrated 
within the breccia matrix, and are dominated by chalcopyrite, bornite, and pyrite, with 
minor chalcocite in the upper parts of some pipes. High-grade mineralization in the 
breccias typically occurs as prominent masses and clots of copper minerals filling open 
spaces, or as sheeted veins along the edges of the pipes. Relative levels of copper, 
molybdenum, gold and silver vary considerably from breccia to breccia. Molybdenite 
Re-Os ages from the breccias yield mineralization ages between 62 and 57 million 
years.  
 
 Recent drilling indicates that the deeper American Eagle and Keel porphyry-style 
resources are connected and form a single copper-mineralized body at least 5000 ft 
long northwest-southeast, which is open in most directions. This mineralized body is 
controlled by a broad dome-shaped zone of common, subhorizontal to steep "early 
halo" quartz-sulfide veins. These veins display thin centerlines of quartz and sulfides, 
surrounded by much thicker halos of biotite, sericite, and abundant copper sulfides. The 
early halo vein zone is hosted mostly in Copper Creek granodiorite but appears 
centered on a cluster of syn-mineral granodiorite porphyry bodies. In parts of the 
American Eagle/Keel, many early halo veins are re-opened as semi-massive 
chalcopyrite-bearing veins that enhance the copper grade. Superimposed on the early 
halo vein zones are breccias and zones of intense quartz-sericite alteration, both of 
which tend to carry high-grade copper which further upgrades copper mineralization 
within the same volume of rock. A near-vertical set of early halo veins crosscuts and 
extends above the well mineralized dome-shaped early halo vein zone to the present 
surface, where outcropping veins are widespread and typically trend east-northeast. 
Sulfides in the American Eagle/Keel zone are zoned with depth, with pyrite-dominant 
mineralization near the surface transitioning into chalcopyrite-dominant rock in the 
better mineralized zones and increasing bornite content at depth. 
 
 Small lead and zinc prospects, primarily vein occurrences, occur toward the edges 
of the breccia-porphyry system.

8.0   DEPOSIT TYPES 
 
 The Copper Creek area contains multiple styles of Laramide copper-
molybdenum-silver+/-gold deposits characterized by relatively high primary copper 
grades. Early development of the district dated from 1863, and focused on the exposed 
copper-rich (>>1% Cu) breccia bodies and peripheral silver-lead-zinc veins. In the 
1960s and 1970s deeper drilling discovered porphyry-style sheeted and stockwork vein 
mineralization (~0.8% Cu) at depths between 1,200 to +4,000 feet in the American 
Eagle and Keel areas, beneath a small portion of the near-surface breccia cluster.  
 
 The breccias are clast- to matrix-supported and consist of angular to subrounded, 
pebble- to boulder-sized, commonly quartz-sericite altered fragments formed from the 
host wall rock. Matrices of most breccias are partially to completely filled with varying 
combinations of quartz, sulfide minerals, tourmaline, specularite, and minor rock flour. 
Breccias are known to persist over 3000 feet vertically. They terminate abruptly upward 
into lower grade material; the Mammoth pipe, the largest breccia in the current 
resource, is "blind" a mere 105 feet below the surface. Where drilling density is 
sufficient, the bottoms of the breccia pipes neck downwards into bodies of granodiorite 
porphyry. Over 90 percent of the mapped breccia bodies have not been drilled. 
 
 Evidence suggests that the breccia pipes were formed during implosive wall-rock 
collapse initiated by widespread porphyry magma withdrawal. As magma withdrew from 
the apex of a given intrusive body, gravity induced collapse initiated brecciation of the 
wall rock. The brecciation propagated to form the breccia bodies that are elongate in the 
vertical direction.  
 
 The American Eagle and Keel porphyry zones were previously classified as 
"hybrid porphyry" or "sheeted vein type" deposits due to their unusual vein styles. 
Recent work by Redhawk geologists has led to the recognition that the Copper Creek 
porphyry deposits are typical of the "early-halo type" of porphyry system described by 
Proffett (2009). In these deposits the dominant style of copper-bearing veins are early 
dark micaceous (EDM) veins or early potassic halos lining incipient fractures, rather 
than the A-type sugary quartz stockwork veins common in many porphyry systems. Well 
known early-halo type porphyry deposits include Butte, Montana, and Chuquicamata 
and Los Pelambres, Chile.

9.0   EXPLORATION 
 
 Exploration activities on the Copper Creek Property have spanned over 140 
years by many different companies as noted in Section 6, History. The exploration work 
conducted since 1950 focused on the two different mineralization types:  the breccia 
pipes or the deep porphyry deposits. The focus depended on the mining/exploration 
company doing the work with the larger, copper producing companies focusing on the 
large porphyry targets and the smaller companies (looking to develop production 
quickly) focusing on the breccia targets. 
 
 AMT mapped the surface expressions of breccia occurrences on the property 
and Redhawk is expanding on this work. Portions of an internal Redhawk memo are 
included below to provide an initial measure of the exploration potential on the property. 
 
 "Between the coordinates of 630,000 to 646,000 north and 394,000 to 410,000 
east, a total of 358 breccia occurrences were counted, not including the Old Reliable, 
Childs-Aldwinkle or Mammoth. As best can be determined, 34 of the individual breccias 
have been drill tested on the Redhawk property, many with multiple holes. This figure 
includes only holes which appear to penetrate a specific breccia, and does not take into 
account roughly 30 holes scattered throughout the property which were not collared in 
(or directed towards) a breccia, but may well have intercepted the irregular subsurface 
continuation of one of the bodies. From this it follows that there are at least 324 of the 
mapped breccia occurrences on Redhawk property that have not been tested by drilling. 
With the acquisition of the PD claims and additional surface exploration, the number of 
mapped breccias now exceeds 400." 
 
 If the heavily drilled area is excluded, then within the Redhawk property south of 
the PD claim block, there are 235 breccia bodies that have been tested by only ten drill 
holes. Many of these breccias have had surface samples collected and analyzed with 
about 590 samples taken in the breccias. The compilation of this data by Redhawk 
reveals: 
 
 "The western breccia belt was found to have 15 samples anomalous in copper 
(>200 PPM) from 14 breccias, of which one has been drill tested. One anomalous 
untested molybdenum (>40 PPM) sample was noted from breccia sampling in the 
western belt. In the southern area are 37 breccia samples anomalous in copper from 
roughly 26 breccia bodies, with one of these having a drill test. Ten breccia samples in 
this area are anomalous in molybdenum from 8 bodies, again with one having a drill 
test. Eight of the breccia bodies from the southern area have coincident anomalous 
copper and molybdenum values, and one of these has been drill tested. In the northeast 
are there are only about 14 breccia samples, with two of these anomalous in copper 
and one anomalous in molybdenum, with no drilling to test the anomalous samples."

 Work by Redhawk since 2009 has resulted in determining that the Copper Creek 
mineralization system is an "early halo" style characterized by a large percentage of 
"early dark micaceous" (EDM) and later "D" type veining hosting the vast majority of 
copper and molybdenum values in the "porphyry" mineralization. The abundant breccia 
bodies appear to be a late phase of mineralization. The EDM and D style veins are 
identifiable in road cuts, drainages, and sometimes in outcrops. The EDM and D style 
veins are being mapped on the surface and show a strong correlation with the "footprint" 
of the porphyry mineralization area. Zones of more intense EDM and D veining on the 
surface are most commonly ENE trending and have very steep to vertical dips and are 
target areas for developing open pit mineable grades above the more massive zones of 
porphyry mineralization at deeper levels. The deeper porphyry mineralization is 
dominated by the EDM and D veining but dips of the veining is strongly sub-horizontal 
to moderate angles rather than the steep to vertical dips at shallower levels. 
 
 Detailed drill hole logging has resulted in determining a series of porphyritic 
intrusions that intrude the main granodiorite body that hosts the vast majority of the 
porphyry style mineralization. Crosscutting relationships between the porphyritic 
intrusions and various veining episodes are being used to develop a full three 
dimension geologic model in the resource areas. The Redhawk geologists have now 
identified five unique porphyries. In these porphyries there are early halo and the later D 
vein systems, and there are instances where the later D veins have been cut by early 
halo veins of a later porphyry intrusive pulse. 
 
 During 2010 and 2011 six widely spaced drill holes were drilled on exploration 
targets within the district. The holes were designed to test various target concepts and 
most of the test holes were 1 to 2 kilometers from the edge of the 2008 deep porphyry 
resource of the Keel and American Eagle. Five of the six holes encountered significant 
grades of copper and molybdenum and alteration and veining styles consistent with that 
found in the resource area. The drilling and the presence of the breccia bodies over a 
large area indicate a large hydrothermal system that is largely under explored. 
 
 Drilling during 2011 and 2012 focused on drill targeting to move as much of a 
large "inferred" resource tonnage in the American Eagle/Keel into the higher quality 
"indicated" and/or "measured" resource categories. The drill program also made a 
strong connection between the American Eagle and Keel mineralization showing the 
area to be one continuous mass of similar mineralization. 
 
 Recent work by the Redhawk geologists has included the mapping of the 
intensity and location of many trace elements and their relationship to the copper, 
molybdenum and precious metal mineralization. The Keel-American Eagle deposit has 
the most drill hole information with many of the drill intervals assayed for a full 32 
element suite in addition to copper, molybdenum, silver and gold assays. The assay 
results from surface sampling over the Keel-American Eagle deposit were added to 
database. Levels and sections of several of the elements show strong zonation patterns

in relation to the porphyry. The results of this work show that the more volatile elements 
tend to move differently away from the porphyry where the base metals are 
concentrated. There appears to be a sequence of these elements with distance from the 
porphyry.   
 
 Using this model, the patterns of the trace elements were studied in more 
sparsely drilled and sampled areas, including areas of only shallow drilling. The 
mapping of the intensity and sequence of the trace elements has indicated the potential 
of several other large porphyry systems to the west and north of the current Keel-
American Eagle porphyry.   
 
 Another interesting result of this trace element mapping is the occurrence of the 
trace elements which usually appear above the porphyry system being found in similar 
intensity below the Keel-American Eagle porphyry in holes which extended to depth 
below the porphyry. Using the trace element model, this leads one to believe that the 
potential exists for another porphyry below the Keel-American Eagle in a stacked 
system. 
 
 Additional drilling is needed to test this hypothesis of deeper porphyries below 
the Keel-American Eagle and in other locations within the Copper Creek claim block. If 
successful, the ability to target the location of other porphyries using this metal zonation 
model can lower the cost and speed up the exploration for and delineation of other 
porphyries which may exist on the un-tested areas of the Copper Creek claim block, 
thus increasing the mineral resource of Copper Creek.

10.0   DRILLING 
 
 Exploration drilling has been conducted by most of the previous owners of the 
Copper Creek property, and Redhawk commenced drilling during the fourth quarter 
2006. A summary of the number of holes and footage by company is summarized in 
Table 10.1 which totals 551 holes for 659,521 ft. Table 10.2 summarizes the drilling by 
drill type and this total will exceed the 551 number of holes because some holes were 
drilled using more than one drilling method. Since the June 2012 mineral resource 
estimate and up to the cutoff date for the current mineral resource update, Redhawk 
has added 6 holes for an approximately 26,861 feet of drilling information to the Copper 
Creek database. 
 
 There are six mineralized areas which are of interest at Copper Cheek and are 
the combinations of the breccia zones (Globe, Copper Prince, Old Reliable, Childs-
Aldwinkle, and the Mammoth) with the deeper porphyry mineralization (Keel, which is 
below the Mammoth breccia and the American Eagle, to the southeast of the Keel). 
Figure 10.1 shows the drill holes and the limits of the mineralized areas. Table 10.3 
summarizes the number of holes, footage and number intervals plus intervals with 
assays for copper, moly, and silver within each of the mineralized area limits shown on 
the map. The total number of holes on this table exceeds the 551 total because some 
holes cross from one area to another.

11.0   SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
11.1 Prior to Redhawk 
 
 Redhawk does not have any record of the methods used for core logging and 
sampling from drilling that predates AMT's involvement with the property (AMT optioned 
the property in 1995). The earlier drilling was done by several major mining and 
resource industry companies and it is assumed that they used industry standard 
practices at the time. Review of the geologic logs, down hole survey records and assay 
certificates that Redhawk has on file confirms that data was collected and handled with 
good practices.   
 
 As the various companies participated in the exploration of Copper Creek, assay 
checks were often done on previous assay work as part of the new company's due 
diligence. This check assay work was reviewed by IMC and is presented in Section 14 
of the IMC report "Copper Creek 2008 Mineral Resource, Pinal County, Arizona, USA, 
Technical Report" dated October 28, 2008 and posted on SEDAR. 
 
 AMT started work at Copper Creek in 1995. There are no written records of its 
sampling methods and data handling, but verbal discussions by Joe Sandberg of 
Redhawk with Claus Wiese, a former employee of AMT, confirmed that the procedures 
followed industry standards. In summary, the drill core or cuttings were logged for 
geologic and geotechnical information, core was split by either sawing or mechanical 
splitting, and half core was sent for assay. The particulars of the sample split for the RC 
drilling is not known.   
 
 Redhawk has spent much time and effort organizing and reviewing the data from 
the previous work since it took over the property in 2005. A summary of its activities and 
chain of custody of the information is included in Section 13 of the IMC report 
mentioned above. Redhawk has consolidated the drill core, cuttings and assay pulps 
into one storage facility under its control. Redhawk has re-logged a majority of the core 
to both confirm the previous logging and to evaluate new theories. Redhawk found the 
core from several of the holes drilled by AMT late in its property ownership had not been 
split or assayed. Redhawk has sampled and assayed these holes and updated the drill 
hole data base.   
 
11.2 Redhawk Sample Handling Procedures 
 
 All drill core (or RC samples) is either picked up on the drill site by Redhawk 
personnel and brought directly to Redhawk's secure facility in San Manuel, AZ, or is 
delivered directly to Redhawk's facilities by the drilling crew. Redhawk's geologists log 
the core and mark the core for sampling. Redhawk personnel saw or split the core as 
per the geologist's marked intervals and split lines. One half of the split core is placed in 
marked bags and delivered by Redhawk personnel directly to Jacobs Assay in Tucson,

AZ for sample prep. The second half of the core is stored in the Redhawk core storage 
facilities for reference. IMC has observed the logging and splitting practices during its 
2008 visits and found them to meet industry standards. Redhawk has confirmed that the 
practices have not changed. 
 
11.3 Current Sample Preparation Procedures 
 
 The split core is delivered to Jacobs Assay for preparation of a pulp sample for 
assaying. The procedure is documented below from a verbal conversation with Michael 
Jacobs. 
 

▪ On delivery, the samples are checked against the list provide by Redhawk, 
and then logged into the lab records in the same order as on the Redhawk 
list. 

 
▪ The entire sample is processed through a jaw crusher, three times to reduce 

the size to a nominal minus 1/2 inch. 
 

▪ The jaw crusher is brushed off and blown clean with compressed air between 
each sample. 

 
▪ The sample is mixed, pan to pan, six times; then poured through a Jones 

splitter. One quarter of the sample is retained for further processing and the 
remaining three quarters is placed back in the bag as the reject sample. 
These are retained for future use. The Jones splitter is cleaned with 
compressed air between each sample. 

 
▪ The one quarter split of the sample goes through a second jaw crusher and 

roller (one pass), mixed, and further crushed if needed to reach minus 10 
mesh size. 

 
▪ The sample passes through a Jones splitter to get a 250 gram split, which is 

pulverized to minus 150 mesh. The Jones splitter is cleaned and the 
pulverizer is cleaned with silica sand after each sample. 

 
▪ The pulverized 250 gram sample is mixed on rolling cloth 25 times from each

 The prepared pulps are shipped directly by public carrier from Jacobs to ALS 
Chemex Laboratory in Reno, Nevada for assay. Reject samples designated for 
metallurgical work by Redhawk personnel are sorted by Jacobs and delivered to Metcon 
in Tucson, AZ.   
 
 Jacobs prepares a second pulp from the sample reject material for every tenth 
sample and those pulps are given to Redhawk personnel or delivered back to the 
Redhawk office. Once several jobs of reject check pulps are collected, these are boxed 
and shipped to ALS in Reno for assay.   
 
 In 2007, Jacobs prepared five standards (one to three 5 gallon buckets each) of 
various copper assay levels from Copper Creek mineralized material. Either 5 or 10 
samples from each standard created were sent to three separate laboratories for 
copper, molybdenum and silver assaying. The results from each laboratory were 
compared and an average value for the standard created for copper, molybdenum and 
silver. One of the five standards is selected at random and inserted in with the pulps 
sent to ALS for assaying. The standards are inserted at the rate of about 1 in 10. The 
standards vary from 0.014 to 5.678 percent copper and from 0.00032 to 0.0092 percent 
molybdenum. In late 2012 a sixth standard was prepared and 10 samples were sent to 
5 certified labs for assay of copper, molybdenum, and silver. The results from each lab 
were compared and an average value for the standard created at 0.745 percent copper, 
0.0285 percent molybdenum, and 3.13 ppm silver. A blank standard has been prepared 
and is being readied for use in future work.  
 
11.4 Assay Procedure 
 
 Redhawk samples were analyzed by ALS Chemex in Reno, Nevada. The 
samples are assayed for copper and molybdenum using standard four acid digestion 
assay techniques. Significantly mineralized intervals were then re-assayed for gold 
using 30 gram charge fire assay and AAS and multi-element ICP (48 elements) to get 
silver values, copper and molybdenum check values, and other elements for 
geochemical and metallurgical information. Copper values from the ICP exceeding 
10,000 ppm were re-assayed using an additional "ore grade" assay method. All drilling 
starting in 2010 is assayed by ALS for multi-element methods with copper values 
exceeding 5,000 ppm or, later in the drilling program, 2,000 ppm being re-assayed by 
AA 62 and values exceeding 10,000 ppm are re-assayed using an additional "ore 
grade" assay method. 
 
 Approximately one in 12 to 14 original pulps is selected for check assay by 
Redhawk. The list of pulps for check assay is sent to ALS, which retrieves the pulp 
samples and these samples are transferred to the Inspectorate Lab in Reno. The check 
samples are assayed for copper, molybdenum and silver with the results provided to 
Redhawk.

11.5 Independent QAQC Review 
 
 Redhawk commissioned an independent review of the project quality assurance 
and quality control (QAQC) program in October 2012. This review was conducted by 
industry recognized expert Dr. Jeffrey Jaacks (Geochemical Applications International 
Inc.). Dr. Jaacks examined all controls and procedures related to sample preparation 
and security, internal standard samples, duplicates, inter-lab check analyses, and 
ongoing QAQC monitoring to ensure adherence to industry best practices. Dr. Jaacks' 
reports to Redhawk dated 15, 16, and 30 October 2012 indicate the company passed 
the review without any issue. Dr. Jaacks made minor recommendations to raise QAQC 
protocols used on the project to an even higher standard.

12.0   DATA VERIFICATION 
 
 This section is taken from the IMC technical report titled "Copper Creek 2012 
Mineral Resource Update, Pinal County, Arizona, USA - Technical Report" dated June 
25, 2012 (posted on SEDAR). Redhawk has continued to run assay checks, standards 
and blanks and this data is being supplied to IMC who is in the process of updating its 
findings.  
 
12.1 Pre-2010 Drilling 
 
 Check assay and other relevant results for the earlier drilling conducted by 
Redhawk and preceding companies at Copper Creek are discussed in Section 14 of the 
NI43-101 Technical Report entitled "Copper Creek 2008 Mineral Resource" dated 
October 28, 2008 and posted on SEDAR. The review of the available assay data base 
used for the 2008 Mineral Resource was divided into two parts:  review of the assay 
data itself in the form of check assays run by previous owners and spot check the 
Redhawk data base as it was provided to IMC against original data in the form of assay 
certificates, geologic logs and survey notes. IMC found the data to be acceptable for the 
development of a resource estimate and notes some areas that require additional 
attention as the project continues. 
 
12.2 2010 - 2012 Redhawk Drilling - Summary 
 
 This review summarizes the results of the QAQC and check assaying program 
on the Redhawk drilling conducted from 2010 through 2012. The data base assays for 
the 2010-12 Redhawk drilling were run by ALS on pulps prepared by Jacobs Assay. 
The QAQC data supplied to IMC consist of assays run by ALS on standards, check 
assays run by Inspectorate on Jacobs pulps, assays run by ALS on a second Jacobs 
pulp from the sample coarse reject and assays run by METCON on pulps prepared by 
METCON. Based on its analysis of these data IMC's conclusions are: 
 

▪ ALS's assaying procedures for copper, molybdenum and silver are 
acceptable. 

 
▪ The only assays that act as a complete check on Jacob's sample preparation 

procedures are those run by METCON on METCON pulps, and the fact that 
these assays are biased up to 17 percent low relative to the ALS data base 
assays for copper indicates a possible sample preparation problem at 
METCON or at Jacobs. Jacobs did prepare a second pulp from the coarse 
reject material for selected samples and this pulp was assayed by ALS and 
falls within acceptable ranges. IMC believes that the problem most likely 
occurred at METCON, but the possibility that it occurred at Jacobs cannot be 
discounted at this time. As a result, IMC believes that the 2010-12 Redhawk 
assays are conditionally acceptable until Jacobs' sample preparation

procedures are validated. This validation needs to be done prior to any future 
resource updates. Redhawk has sent a batch of 73 coarse reject samples 
(from intervals where the pulp was prepared by Jacobs) to ALS for sample 
preparation and assay. Redhawk has commented to IMC that this check work 
came back fine, and IMC needs to follow up on the results.  

 
▪ To do this it is recommended to ship every 20th reject sample from the post-

2008 drilling (approximately 600 samples) to a check laboratory, have this 
laboratory prepare pulps from the rejects and assay them with the same 
procedures as used by ALS. If the assays compare acceptably with the data 
base assays, the Jacobs sample preparation procedures will be validated. 
(IMC recommended in Section 14.4 of the October 2008 Technical Report 
that future check assays be run on rejects rather than pulps to obtain a check 
on both analytical and sample preparation procedures.) 

 
▪ Consideration should be given to adding a higher-grade molybdenum 

standard and a silver standard. Since the June 2012 technical report, 
Redhawk has added a 0.028 percent molybdenum standard to its suite of 
standards. A silver standard is also being run. 

 
▪ Blank samples should be inserted in the sample stream as part of the QAQC 

program. Redhawk has created a blank sample for use once drilling resumes. 
At that time, the round robin assay work from a group of assay labs will be 
done to verify the assay of the blank standard. 

 
12.3 Assays on Standards 
 
 The results of the ALS Chemex assays on five copper - molybdenum standards 
are summarized in Tables 12.1 and 12.2. A standard was inserted approximately once 
every 13 samples (1,625 standards in 12,725 total assays). The five standards were 
prepared from Copper Creek drill samples by Jacobs and expected grades were 
determined by assaying the standards at three assay laboratories and taking the mean 
of all the assays. There are no silver standards.

 The mean copper grade of the standard assays is 2 to 4 percent lower than the 
expected grade for standards 2, 3 and 4 and the mean molybdenum grade is 5 to 
7 percent lower than the expected grade for standards 2 and 3. The grades of the other 
standards are too low to allow a meaningful mean/expected grade comparison to be 
made. (Median values are shown in the tables because the scatter of the standard 
assays makes it difficult to determine whether the outlier points are a result of assay 
variability, poor homogenization of the standard, sample mislabeling or data entry 
errors. Under these circumstances the median might be considered a more meaningful 
estimate of the mean of the standard assays.) 
 
 The results of the standard assays are summarized in Figures 12.1 through 
12.10. There is no indication of any significant variations in grade with time for any of 
the standards. 
 
 IMC considers these results acceptable. However, QAQC programs commonly 
include assays run on blanks and it would therefore be desirable to insert blanks into 
the sample stream. (Standard 5 could be replaced by blanks). Adding a higher-grade 
molybdenum standard in the +/- 0.05 percent range and a silver standard in the +/- 1 g/t 
range should also be considered.

12.4 Check Assay Comparisons 
 
 The results of the check assay comparisons for copper are summarized in Table 
12.3. Copper represents the bulk of the economic value of the Copper Creek resource, 
so the copper comparisons are the most important. 
 

Table 12.3 
ALS Database Assays (on Jacobs Pulps) Versus Check Assays for Copper 

Check Lab Pulps from Number ALS mean, % Check mean, % Check/ALS % QQ-plot % 
Inspectorate Jacobs 562 0.366 0.379 +3.6 +3.0 

ALS duplicates Jacobs 295 0.323 0.306 -5.2 -3.6 
METCON (AA) METCON 97 0.570 0.470 -17.5  
METCON (AA2) METCON 61 0.545 0.490 -10.1  
METCON (ICP) METCON 61 0.545 0.542 -0.6  

 
 According to these results a Jacobs pulp was sent to Inspectorate for check 
assay approximately once every 23 samples (562 assays in 12,725 total assays) and a 
second pulp prepared from the coarse reject by Jacobs was re-assayed by ALS 
approximately once every 43 samples (295 assays in 12,725 total assays). The 
METCON assays were run on pulps prepared separately from Jacobs rejects by 
METCON. 
 
 IMC generally considers check assay results to be acceptable when the mean 
grade of the check assays is within 5 percent of the mean grade of the data base 
assays and/or when the gradient of a QQ-plot, which compares the grade distributions 
of the two data sets rather than the mean grades, falls within 5 percent of a 1:1 line. 
This criterion is met for the ALS versus Inspectorate copper comparison. However, 
because both the ALS data base and the Inspectorate check assays were run on 
Jacobs pulps the results act to verify only ALS's analytical procedures.  
 
 The criterion is also met for the ALS versus ALS duplicate assay copper 
comparison. The ALS duplicate assays were run on second pulp prepared by Jacobs 
and therefore acts as a check only on analytical procedures. If there were any problems 
with Jacobs' sample preparation procedures the duplicate comparisons would not 
identify them. 
 
 The METCON assays are the only assays that were run on pulps prepared by a 
lab other than Jacobs and are therefore the only ones that act as an independent check 
on Jacobs' sample preparation procedures. The 5 percent criterion is met in the 
METCON (ICP) case but not in the two METCON AA cases, which show METCON 
biased 10 to 17 percent low relative to ALS. These results suggest a sample 
preparation or assaying problem at METCON, but the possibility that the Jacobs sample 
preparation procedures are biasing the ALS copper assays high is being investigated by 
having ALS create new pulps from the coarse rejects to check the Jacobs sample 
preparation.

 The results of the check assay comparisons for molybdenum and silver are 
summarized in Tables 12.4 and 12.5. These comparisons are less important because 
molybdenum and silver are byproduct minerals that contribute only a small proportion to 
the economic value of the Copper Creek resource.

METCON METCON 97 1.77 2.02 +14.1 
 
 The Inspectorate and ALS duplicate comparisons for molybdenum and silver also 
generally meet criteria for acceptance but again the ALS versus METCON comparisons 
show apparent biases, although in the opposite sense to copper. 
 
 The results of the check assays comparisons are shown in the following Figures:

13.0   MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
  
  The following is a discussion of the metallurgical testing and mineral processing 
aspects of the proposed project. 
 
13.1 Metallurgical Testwork Discussion 
 
13.1.1 Bulk Copper Molybdenum Flotation Test Program 

 
The previous property owners of the Copper Creek property had metallurgical 

tests conducted at Mountain States R&D International, Inc. (MSRDI). Much of the test 
work evaluated heavy media separation or heavy media separation followed by flotation 
as processing techniques. Results from conventional flotation tests, described in the 
"Report of Metallurgical Testing on Copper Sulfide Resources of the Copper Creek 
Property" by MSRDI dated 3 January 1997 are summarized below. Additional work on 
other mineralized zones, conducted in 2008 is described in the "Copper Creek Project 
Preliminary Flotation Study" by METCON Research (METCON) dated November 2008. 
Results from this work are also summarized below.   

 
In the first test series conducted by MSRDI, rougher flotation tests were 

conducted on four different composite samples from the Copper Creek Property. Three 
of the composites were from the Childs-Aldwinkle area and the fourth was from the 
Creek Breccia. These selected composite samples represented three copper grades: 
low (about 0.5 percent copper); average (1.5 to 2.5 percent copper); and high (plus 3 
percent copper) for each mineralization type. The tests were planned to evaluate the 
effect of particle size (grind) on the recovery of copper and molybdenum. 

  
Test conditions for the series are noted below: 
 
▪ Lime = 3.5 lb/t  pH = 10.8 - 11.2  
▪ S-5741 = 0.01 lb/t  
▪ Nalco 9743 = 0.017 lb/t  
▪ Z-11 = 0.002 lb/t  
▪ Fuel Oil = 0.023 lb/t 

 
 Results from the test series are summarized in the following Table 13.1.

 As shown in Table 13.1, the copper recovery and rougher concentrate grades 
realized were both excellent. Generally, the effect of finer grind was to increase copper 
recovery. The effect of grind on molybdenum recovery is not as clear. The target grind 
P80 equal to 140 microns was selected for the remainder of the test program.   

 
 The second series of tests conducted by MSRDI, summarized in Table 13.2, was 
run to evaluate cleaning the rougher concentrate produced. The rougher concentrate 
was not reground, and excellent cleaner concentrate grades, averaging over 40 percent 
copper, were achieved.

  The effect of flotation retention time was also evaluated by MSRDI. The recovery 
- time profile for both copper and molybdenum from two composites are shown in 
Figure 13.1. Results indicate rapid flotation kinetics with over 95 percent of the copper 
recovered in three minutes with the flotation reagents used. 
 

 
Figure 13.1 - MSRDI Rougher Flotation Kinetics 

 
 After the batch test described above, MSRDI conducted locked cycle tests on the 
average grade composites. Results are summarized in Table 13.3. Concentrate grades 
between 32 and 62 percent copper were obtained with copper recoveries all above 
95 percent. Molybdenum recoveries were proportional to the molybdenum head grade 
with the high-grade sample giving 94 percent recovery and the low-grade sample giving 
28 percent recovery. As can be seen, flotation response of all the various mineralization 
types, as well as grades, was excellent averaging over 97 percent for copper and 
72 percent for molybdenum.

 METCON results indicate that recovery is a function of oxidation and head grade. 
METCON conducted sulfidization tests with sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) in an attempt 
to improve results from the oxidized composites. These tests did not result in significant 
recovery improvement. Redhawk geologists indicate that the amount of oxide material 
in the deposit is low.

13.1.2 Copper Molybdenum Separation Test Program 
 

 Limited testing was conducted by MSRDI to demonstrate the copper 
molybdenum separation process. The tests using NaHS, the conventional reagent for 
copper-molybdenum separation circuits, were not successful and additional testing to 
optimize reagents used in the bulk copper molybdenum flotation step and the 
subsequent copper molybdenum separation is recommended. It should be noted that it 
is difficult to undertake the proposed copper-molybdenum separation in the initial 
laboratory testing phase of the mining project due to lack of the appropriate quality and 
quantity of bulk copper-molybdenum concentrates.  
 

MSRDI carried out the proposed copper-molybdenum separation testing on a 
composite sample made up of higher grade molybdenum samples from the Childs-
Aldwinkle deposit (Samples 3-1, 3-2 and 3-3). These samples contained a mixture of 
chalcopyrite, bornite, and chalcocite, and had an average copper grade of 1.28 percent 
and an average molybdenum grade of 0.10 percent. In this testing program, ten 
kilograms of the composite sample were ground to the desired size distribution (P80 = 
150 microns) and were subjected to flotation using the standard flotation conditions and 
reagents to obtain the final copper-molybdenum concentrates for the subsequent 
copper-molybdenum separation tests (Test No. BM-47). The bulk concentrate from the 
preceding test was split into eight equal portions of about 50 grams each and an 
additional sample for head assay. The eight samples were subjected to selective 
flotation techniques utilizing various copper or molybdenum depressants. The results of 
this testing program are summarized in the following Table 13.6. 
 

Table 13.6 
Summary Results of Copper-Moly Separation 

Test No. Reagent Amount (lb/t) Remarks 
BM-47-A NaHS 10.0 No depression of copper 
BM-47-B Na-Ferrocyanide Up to 5.0 No depression of copper 
BM-47-C Na-Cyanide Up to 5.0 No depression of copper 
BM-47-D Na-Hypochlorite Up to 5.0 No depression of copper 
BM-47-E Steaming 4 Hours No depression of copper 
BM-47-F Oven-Drying 8 Hours Some depression of copper 
BM-47-G CM-Guar Up to 3.0 Some depression of molybdenum 

   
 The results of the scoping tests indicated that selective flotation of molybdenum 
from the bulk copper-moly concentrates produced using conventional copper 
depressants such as NaHS, ferro-cyanide, and hypochlorite was not effective. This lack 
of effectiveness may be attributed to the fact that the collectors S-5741 and Nalco 9743 
form very strong chemical bonds with the copper minerals. This strong bond renders 
typical copper depressants ineffective. 
 

A single test evaluating the use of a milder xanthate collector to obtain a bulk 
copper-moly concentrate followed by selective flotation of molybdenum using NaHS 
reagent (Test BM-49) was run. Results of this test indicate that effective selective

 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July 2013

flotation of molybdenum from the bulk concentrate was achieved. The molybdenum 
grade of the rougher concentrate was 29.80 percent. This favorable result indicates that 
it should be possible to obtain acceptable molybdenum recovery at marketable grades 
using xanthate collectors but more testwork on representative samples is needed to 
confirm and optimize the process.  

 
It should be noted that molybdenite occurrences in the Copper Creek deposits 

contain appreciable amounts of rhenium (up to 1100 ppm). Since the rhenium is 
contained in MoS2, crystals, it will be concentrated with molybdenum and can be 
recovered during the conversion of molybdenite concentrates to technical grade 
molybdic oxide.   

 
In 2008, METCON also attempted a copper-molybdenum separation using 

NaHS. The test was run on a concentrate from the Keel & American Eagle composite 
sample. Unfortunately, the test head grade was very low, so the resulting test mass 
balance may not be representative. Consequently, it is not possible to verify the 
molybdenite separation process on this material. Results from the test are summarized 
in Table 13.7.

13.1.3 Bond Grinding Work Index 

 
Two composite samples of Copper Creek mineralization (one comparatively soft 

and the other comparatively hard) were prepared and subjected to standard Bond 
Grinding Work Index tests at 100 mesh by MSRDI. The results of these tests revealed 
that the harder composite has a Work Index of 13.2 kWh/ton while the softer composite 
has a Work Index of 11.5 kWh/ton.   
 
13.1.4 Mineralogical Studies 

 
 The mineralogical studies indicated that the mineral grains were very coarse and 
that the mineralized material may be amenable to processing by heavy-media-
separation techniques. For this reason, much of the work conducted at MSRDI was 
aimed at evaluating the response of the mineralization to a heavy-media-separation 
technique. The mineralogical studies and subsequent chemical analyses indicated the 
presence of tennantite, an arsenic-bearing mineral in some of the copper concentrates 
produced.

The general mineralogy distribution, as interpreted by AMT, indicates the 
following:  

 
▪ Chalcocite occurs on the upper portions and down the margins of the breccia 

deposit. Significant chalcocite may exist to the 3,750 ft elevation. Chalcocite 
is noted to replace chalcopyrite and bornite. It is possible some of the bornite 
in this upper zone may be supergene in origin.  

 
▪ Chalcopyrite forms the main hypogene zone. It occurs by itself and mixed 

with bornite or pyrite. It occurs mainly at the outer portions of the pipe and at 
depth. 

 
▪ Bornite appears to occur in the core of the breccia body, usually with 

chalcopyrite. It does not seem to occur below 3,450 ft elevation. 
 

▪ Below the 3,450 ft elevation, tennantite occurs, usually replacing chalcopyrite 
and bornite. Above 3,530 ft elevation the arsenic content is less then 10 ppm 
and does not exceed 1,000 ppm (0.10 percent) until the 3,460 ft elevation is 
reached. 

 
MSRDI concluded the following from this phase of the testwork: 
 
▪ The flotation response of all the mineralization types and grades to standard 

flotation operating conditions employed at the San Manuel concentrator is 
excellent. 

 
 In the single-stage flotation tests, copper recoveries ranged from plus 90 percent 
for lower grade composites to as high as 99 percent for higher grade mineralization, 
along with rougher concentrate grades ranging from about 22 percent copper to as high 
as 42 percent copper depending on the bornite content in the feeds. 
 

▪ In the confirmatory locked-cycle flotation tests, the recoveries of copper in the 
final concentrates were 96 to 98 percent with grades varying from 27 to 42 
percent copper depending on the bornite content in the feeds. 

 
▪ It should be noted that the excellent results obtained in the above tests 

required a grind P80 equal to 140 microns. 
 

▪ The results also showed that the recoveries of the by-product molybdenum 
were also relatively high and varied from a low of 26 percent to a high as 94 
percent depending on the head grade of Mo in the composite samples. 

 
▪ The Work Index determined for the composite samples investigated were as 

follows:

  Softer Mineralization Composite: 11.5 kWh/ton  
  Harder Mineralization Composite: 13.2 kWh/ton. 

 
▪ In regard to the quality of the final flotation concentrates, the detailed 

chemical analysis for 22 elements including toxic elements indicated that all 
the final products were relatively clean of toxic elements except for unusually 
high arsenic contents in some of the concentrates. 

 
▪ This presence of arsenic was attributed to tennantite occurrences in some 

localized areas of the Copper Creek deposits. It is important to acknowledge 
the presence of arsenic and to put in place appropriate steps need to keep 
the arsenic content below the smelter penalty limit in the final copper 
concentrates. 

 
▪ Results of copper-molybdenum selective flotation tests on the bornite rich 

bulk flotation concentrates indicated that molybdenum depressants such as 
dextrine and starches were more effective in depressing molybdenite rather 
than sodium hydrosulfide, ferrocyanide and cyanide used for copper 
depression. Effective copper-molybdenum separations were also achieved by 
floating the molybdenum selectively with fuel oil prior to flotation of copper by 
conventional collectors. Similarly, effective separation of molybdenum from 
the copper-moly bulk concentrates was achieved by using the xanthate type 
collector for bulk concentration. In this case, the xanthate complex was 
decomposed by acid conditioning and then the copper was depressed with 
the conventional sodium hydrosulfide technique. Equally effective separation 
of molybdenum was achieved by this technique using the standard flotation 
reagents that were used by the San Manuel concentrator. 

 
Review of the chemical analyses of the final copper concentrates from locked-

cycle tests shown in Table 13.8 indicated that two out of eight composite samples 
showed high arsenic content. Since this high arsenic content could render the 
concentrates difficult to market or may involve a substantial penalty at the smelter. It is 
recommended that the AMT geological staff fully evaluate the extent of copper and 
arsenic mineralization (tennantite) in the Copper Creek Property. James Guthrie, AMT 
Chief Geologist indicated that the arsenic content is rather limited and that arsenic is not 
present in any significant amount above the 3,460 ft elevation in the Copper Creek 
Property. Accordingly, the arsenic content in the final copper concentrates would be 
under the acceptable limits for a major portion of the mine life. If the arsenic content in 
the copper flotation concentrate becomes an issue, then blending with concentrates 
having a lower arsenic content will be utilized.

13.1.6 Copper-Molybdenum Separation on Two Composite Samples 
 
 In third quarter of year 2012, METCON conducted a copper-molybdenum 
separation on two composites identified as Open Pit and Underground from the Copper 
Creek Project. The composite samples were reconstituted per instructions received 
from Mr. Joe Sandberg, President and CEO of Redhawk Resources (Redhawk). 
 
 Approximately 700 kilograms of sample was prepared for the Open Pit 
Composite and approximately 1,100 kilograms of sample was prepared for the 
Underground Composite. Each composite sample was stage crushed to 100 percent 
minus 10 mesh and test charges of 1,000 grams were prepared for head assays, grind 
calibration and flotation testing. The test charges were saved in a freezer to minimize 
oxidation. 
 
 A test charge from each composite was selected at random, pulverized to 100 
percent minus 150 mesh and a sample submitted for head assays. The results are 
summarized in Table 13.11 below.

using the best rougher flotation and cleaner flotation conditions developed for each 
composite sample. The grinding product size of P80 140 microns was used for flotation 
circuit. Copper/molybdenum separation was conducted using sodium hydrosulfide and 
the molybdenum concentrate was subjected to at least five stages of cleaner flotation to 
produce the final molybdenum concentrate.

The JKTech Drop-weight and SMC Tests were conducted on the RAE-08-45 and 

RMK-11-065 drill core samples at SGS Minerals Services in Lakefield, Canada (SGS). 
The JKTech drop-weight test was performed on the two samples. For the top fraction, 
the specimens were tested under the two possible orientations below, and the 
fragments were analyzed separately as follows: 

 
▪ Vertical, i.e. the cylinder was sitting on its flat side and the hammer was 

hitting the other flat end. 
 
▪ Horizontal, i.e. the cylinder was sitting on the round side and the hammer was 

hitting the other round side.  
 
The data was interpreted by Contract Support Services (CSS), the North 

American agent for JKTech. The overall test results are summarized in Table 3.18. The 
effect of orientation on the overall interpretation and parameters determination was very 
marginal, so the combined results were used.

14.0   MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
14.1 Summary 
 
 The December 2012 mineral resource is a combination of the re-statement of the 
October 2008 mineral resource for the five breccia deposits and the re-estimation of the 
Keel - American Eagle porphyry deposit. No new drilling has been done in the breccias 
so the October 2008 resource models are used with the resources updated to reflect a 
new calculation of the copper equivalent. The Old Reliable is reported separate from the 
other breccia deposits because it is anticipated to be mined by an open pit method, 
while the remaining breccia deposits would be mined underground. The Keel - 
American Eagle deposit has been re-estimated to include the additional drilling results 
since March 2012 (data cutoff date for the June 2012 resource) and to model the 
deposit for a potential underground mining approach. 
 
 Grades in the updated Keel - American Eagle resource model were estimated 
using inverse distance to the fourth power (ID4) in three estimation domains defined by 
Redhawk geologists as copper grade shells based on 20ft drill hole composites. Zone 5 
was defined by composite grades where total copper greater than or equal to (>=) 0.50 
percent, Zone 4 was defined by composite grades where total copper >= 0.40 percent 
and less than (<) 0.50 percent, and Zone 3 was defined by composite grades where 
total copper >=0.30 and < 0.40 percent. All three zones were estimated with a 350 ft by 
350 ft (horizontal) and 275 ft (vertical) search. Blocks in Zone 3 were estimated using 
composites in Zones 3 and 4, blocks in Zone 4 were estimated by using composites in 
Zones 3, 4, and 5, and blocks in Zone 5 were estimated using composites in Zones 4 
and 5. 
 
 The five breccia models used the outlines of the breccia bodies as limits to the 
grade estimates. There is isolated mineralization to the exterior of the breccia bodies 
and the estimate of grade of this mineralization was made using a polygonal estimation 
with a limited search distance. The Childs-Aldwinkle and Mammoth grade models were 
estimated using indicator kriging and the Old Reliable, Globe and Copper Prince grade 
models used ordinary kriging. A summary of the development of these resource models 
is presented later in this section and the details are found in the October 2008 technical 
report.  
 
 Tonnages were calculated assuming a constant density of 12.5 cu ft/ton (2.56 
g/cc). Resources were classified as measured, indicated or inferred based on the 
number of holes within the search and the kriging variance. In preparing this estimate 
IMC has assumed that all of the data supplied to it, including assay and survey data, are 
correct to within normally-accepted limits of error. 
 
 The mineral resource in Table 14.1 is tabulated at different copper equivalent 
(CuEq) cutoffs for each of three areas: 
 



Redhawk Copper, Inc. - Copper Creek PEA 25,000 TPD Mill Page 105 
  

 
 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July 2013 

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

▪ The near surface Old Reliable breccia is tabulated using a 0.40 percent CuEq 
cutoff to reflect a potential open pit resource. 

 
▪ The breccia deposits of Globe, Copper Prince, Childs-Aldwinkle and 

Mammoth are tabulated using a 0.75 percent CuEq cutoff to reflect a selective, 
underground mining approach. 

 
▪ The Keel - American Eagle porphyry is tabulated at a 0.50 percent CuEq cutoff 

to reflect a bulk underground mining approach. 
 

 The copper equivalent grade is based on the metal prices and estimate of 
recoveries for copper, molybdenum, silver and gold (estimated in the breccia deposits 
only).  
 

 Metal Price Recovery 
Copper $2.75/lb 90% 
Molybdenum $12.00/lb 80% 
Silver $20.00/oz 90% 
Gold  $1100/oz 40% 

 
 The copper equivalent calculations are: 
 
 Keel - American Eagle: 
  CuEq% = Cu% + 3.875 x Mo% + 0.3636 x Ag (opt) 
 
 Breccia Deposits: 
  CuEq% = Cu% + 3.875 x Mo% + 0.3636 x Ag (opt) + 8.89 x Au (opt)

 Holes are mostly vertical in the American Eagle area and spaced a few hundred 
feet apart on average. The holes that test the higher-grade breccias to the northwest 
are mostly inclined and hole spacing is highly variable. The drilling in the areas of 
Globe, Copper Prince, and Old Reliable were not included in the current resource model

the deeper holes have down hole surveys that generally show deviations of less than 5 
degrees. Hole diameters and recoveries were not recorded in the data base supplied to 
IMC. 
 
 For the Copper Creek Keel - American Eagle model, three copper grade shell 
zone boundaries were interpreted by Redhawk Copper geologists on each 20ft level. 
These boundaries were total copper >= 0.50 percent (Zone 5), total copper = >0.40 
percent, < 0.50 percent (Zone 4), and total copper >=0.30 percent, < 0.40 percent (Zone 
3). These outlines were used to tag the blocks in the block model. All other blocks were 
in Zone 0. Composite data was "dipped" into the block model and the composites were 
assigned a zone code based on which grade shell they were located. Table 14.4 
summarizes the drilling by the grade shell domain.

 Assays were composited into 20 ft bench composites to match the 20 ft level 
height in the resource model. Copper and molybdenum assays and composite statistics 
are compared in Table 14.5. Table 14.6 summarizes 20 ft level composite statistics by 
defined grade zone.

 Figure 14.3 shows log-transformed cumulative frequency plots of 20 ft composite 
copper grades by grade shell zone. The Zone 0 (No Zone on the plot) includes drill hole 
composites within the Mammoth and Childs-Aldwinkle breccias which were not modeled 
by the grade shells. The higher grade composites within these breccias account for the 
kink in the cumulative frequency curve for this zone. This is also present in Figure 14.4 
for molybdenum, although more gradual.

14.4 Variograms, Distribution of Mineralization 
 
 Copper variograms at Copper Creek were looked at separately in all the defined 
grade zones. Reasonable results were obtained with covariance variograms run on 20 ft 
copper composites within each of these zones. A combined zone variogram is shown in 
Figure 14.5. The results of the variograms are summarized in Table 14.7.

 These ranges are restricted in the horizontal distances by the size of the zone 
boundaries. Zone 3 has the longest vertical range. In Zones 4 and 5 the vertical range is 
shorter than the horizontal range. 
 
 Molybdenum variograms were not constructed because molybdenum has a 
lesser economic contribution to the overall copper equivalent value and the 
molybdenum grade tends to track copper grade.

 Drilling at American Eagle is reasonably evenly-spaced, and on the Figure 14.6 
section it defines a broadly continuous mineralized zone at depth which is open in some 
directions. Drilling outside of the higher grade intersections has intervals which were not 
assayed. Redhawk continues to add to the drill hole data base with new drilling and the 
assaying of intervals in previous drilled holes which were not assayed. This is an 
ongoing program to make the data base more complete. 
 
14.5 Grade Estimation 
 
 The Copper Creek underground model extends from 63,3860N to 63,8400N, 
from 40,1000E to 40,800E and from -100 to 3800 ft elevation. With a model block size 
of 20x20x20ft it contains 350 columns, 227 rows and 195 tiers for a total of 15,492,750 
blocks. This model was developed to update the mineral resource for the Keel - 
American Eagle porphyry. The 20 x 20 x 20 ft block was selected as a reasonable 
mining unit for a room and pillar underground mining approach which is being 
considered for the porphyry zones. The block model extends into the breccia areas, but 
mineral resources for these areas are tabulated for the 2008 block models and thus 
were not modeled even though they fall within this block model framework. 
 
14.5.1 Selection of Grade Estimation Operator 
 
 IMC's experience in porphyry copper deposits where mined-model comparisons 
are available shows that a higher-power inverse distance operator is usually needed to 
match the model grade distribution to the blast hole grade distribution, and that the blast 
hole grade distribution is usually best matched when this operator "splits the difference" 
between ordinary kriging (OK), which tends to overstate tons and understates grade, 
and nearest-neighbor polygons (NNP), which tends to understate tons and overstate 
grade.   
 
 Using these criteria it was found that an inverse distance to the fourth power 
(ID4) operator was appropriate for Copper Creek. Figure 14.8 compares the copper 
block grade distributions obtained using this operator with the distributions obtained 
using ordinary kriging (OK) and nearest-neighbor polygons (NNP) in the Copper Creek 
model for initial block model runs.

14.5.2 Internal Boundaries and Grade Estimation Searches  
 
 Grade shell zone boundaries were interpreted and digitized by the Redhawk 
geologists. This information was assigned to the block model and to the composite data. 
Figure 14.9 shows the 1980 bench with the grade zone boundaries and the 20 ft 
composites for that bench. Zone 3 is total copper >=0.30 percent and < 0.40 percent, 
Zone 4 is total copper >=0.40 percent and < 0.50 percent and Zone 5 is total copper >= 
0.50 percent.

  Figure 14.9 - Grade Zone Boundaries with Composites on the 1980 Bench 

  Zone 3 is Blue, Zone 4 is Green, and Zone 5 is Red. 
 
 Copper, molybdenum and silver were estimated using a 350 ft by 350 ft 
horizontal and 275 ft vertical search and a maximum/minimum of 12/2 20 ft composites 
in all three zones. The number of composites from a single drill hole was restricted to 6 
composites. Blocks in Zone 3 were estimated with composites in Zones 3 and 4. Blocks 
in Zone 4 were estimated with composites in Zones 3, 4, and 5. Blocks in Zone 5 were 
estimated with composites in Zones 4 and 5. Blocks in Zone 0 were not estimated. This 
estimation did not assign grades to all the blocks within the grade shells. A second 
estimation pass was made in Zones 3, 4, 5 with the search radius expanded to 800 ft by 
800 ft horizontal and 275 ft vertical to fill in more of the blocks within the shell zones, but 
the results of this pass were not included in the mineral resource estimate. 
 
14.5.3 Treatment of Un-assayed Intervals 
 
 Within the grade shells used to estimate the porphyry mineral resource there are 
a total of 3,167 composites of which 3,159 have values for copper (99.7%), 2,874 has 
values for molybdenum (90.7%) and 1,758 have values for silver (55.5%). Copper is the 
largest contributor to the copper equivalent calculation, followed by molybdenum and 
silver making a minor contribution. The copper grades are complete throughout the

grade shell zones and molybdenum has coverage of 90 percent. No default values have 
been assigned to either the assay or composite data bases. 
 
14.5.4 Model Results 
 
 In the zone assigned blocks 9 percent of the composite intervals that are 
assayed for copper are not assayed for molybdenum, 841,594 blocks in the IMC model 
are assigned copper grades, 838,024 blocks are assigned molybdenum grades and 
213,683 blocks are assigned silver grades. At a 0.5 percent copper cutoff, however, 
almost all of the blocks that are assigned copper grades are assigned molybdenum 
grades (318,882 vs. 316,128). Silver has fewer assigned at 122,388 blocks.  
 
 Block grade distributions in the IMC model are summarized in the following

14.5.5 Resource Classification 
 
 The classification of the mineral resource for the Keel – American Eagle porphyry 
started with all the resource being classified as inferred if the copper grade was 
estimated for a block. The confidence was increased as further restrictions were applied 
based on the number of composites or drill holes used to estimate a block's grades.   
 
 Resources were initially classified as indicated where composites with copper 
values from three or more holes were present, within the search ellipse and the number 
of composites within the search ellipse was twelve or greater. Additionally for Zone 3, a 
block was classified as indicated if there were five or more holes present, within the 
search ellipse. For Zones 4 and 5 a block was classified as indicated if there were four 
or more holes present, within the search ellipse.   
 
 The three-hole-minimum criterion for the zones is supported by kriging variances, 
which are a measure of the errors to which individual block grade estimates are subject. 
Figure 14.15 plots kriging variance against the number of drill holes in the search for 
each zone, these show kriging variance increasing gradually as the number of holes 
within the search decreases from twelve to three but increasing more rapidly as the 
number falls below three. This inflection defines the three-hole minimum as an 
appropriate confidence threshold for segregating inferred from indicated material.

 The indicated classification was sub-divided into measured and indicated by 
using the number of drill holes within a shorter distance from the block center. To be 
classified as measured there either had to be six or more drill holes used to estimate a 
block or there had to be 3 drill holes within 200 ft of the block.   
 
 The final resource classifications are strictly applicable only to copper grades, but 
since molybdenum and silver make only a comparatively small economic contribution 
the classifications have also been applied to these grades as well. 
 
 Resource classification results are summarized in Figures 14.13 and 14.14, 
which show indicated and inferred blocks along the east-west sections at 635500N and 
636500N drill hole composite grade sections used in Figures 14.5, 14.6, 14.8 and 14.9

14.6 2008 Breccia Resource Models 
 
 The mineral resources are summarized here and described in detail in the 
Independent Mining Consultants, Inc. (IMC) report titled: "Copper Creek 2008 Mineral 
Resource, Pinal County, Arizona, USA, Technical Report", dated October 28, 2008 and 
filed on SEDAR on October 29, 2008. The five breccia deposits (Copper Prince, Globe, 
Old Reliable, Childs-Aldwinkle and Mammoth) contain copper mineralization with 
associated molybdenum (moly), gold and silver, in potentially economic concentrations.   
 
 The drilling used for the mineral resource estimates (the footage is only what is 
within each model area and does not include the total footage of drilling from the 
surface) is: 
 

▪ Mammoth Breccia  63 surface drill holes totaling 95,745 ft 
 

▪ Childs-Aldwinkle Breccia 85 surface holes and 6 underground holes  
totaling 90,064 ft 

 
▪ Old Reliable Breccia  49 surface holes, 61 underground holes, 31   

channel samples totaling 41,913 ft 
 

▪ Copper Prince   18 surface holes totaling 8,438 ft 
 

▪ Globe    23 surface holes totaling 16,054.8 ft 
 
 The five breccia models used the outlines of the breccia bodies as limits to the 
grade estimates. There is isolated mineralization to the exterior of the breccia bodies 
and the estimate of grade of this mineralization was made using a polygonal estimation 
with a limited search distance. The Childs and Mammoth grade models were estimated 
using indicator kriging and the Old Reliable, Globe and Copper Prince grade models 
used ordinary kriging. Block size in the breccias is 15' x 15' x 15' based upon the 
assumption of the potential for blast-hole cut and fill mining methods. 
 
14.7 Mineral Resource 
 
 Tonnages were calculated assuming a constant density of 12.5 cu ft/ton (2.56 
g/cc). Resources were classified as measured, indicated or inferred based on the 
number of holes within the search ellipse. In preparing this estimate IMC has assumed 
that all of the data supplied to it, including assay and survey data, are correct to within 
normally-accepted limits of error. 
 
 The mineral resource in Table 14.8 is tabulated at different copper equivalent 
(CuEq) cutoffs for each of three areas:

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

▪ The near surface Old Reliable breccia is tabulated using a 0.40 percent CuEq 
cutoff to reflect a potential open pit resource. This resource has been 
confined within a pit shell based on process plus G&A costs of $10.00/ton and 
mining costs of $2.00/ton. 

 
▪ The breccia deposits of Globe, Copper Prince, Childs-Aldwinkle and 

Mammoth are tabulated using a 0.75 percent CuEq cutoff to reflect a selective, 
underground mining approach. 

 
▪ The Keel - American Eagle porphyry is tabulated at a 0.50 percent CuEq cutoff 

to reflect a bulk underground mining approach. 
 

 The copper equivalent grade is based on the metal prices and estimate of 
recoveries for copper, molybdenum, silver and gold (estimated in the breccia deposits 
only). 
 

   Metal Price Recovery 
Copper $2.75/lb 90% 
Molybdenum $12.00/lb 80% 
Silver $20.00/oz 90% 
Gold  $1100/oz 40% 

 
The copper equivalent calculations are: 
 
 Keel – American Eagle: 
  CuEq% = Cu% + 3.875 x Mo% + 0.3636 x Ag (opt) 
  
 Breccia Deposits: 
  CuEq% = Cu% + 3.875 x Mo% + 0.3636 x Ag (opt) + 8.89 x Au (opt)

14.8 Uncertainties 
 
 The resource estimates assume that the copper and molybdenum at Copper 
Creek occurs entirely in the form of sulfides. However, approximately 10 percent of the 
intervals at Copper Creek are assayed for acid soluble copper, and acid soluble/total 
copper ratio values in these intervals indicate that significant oxidation is present down 
to depths of at least 500 feet in the Globe, Copper Prince, Old Reliable and Peripheral 
areas, although oxidation in Childs-Aldwinkle, Mammoth and American Eagle is mostly 
superficial.  
 
 Table 14.11 summarizes mean acid soluble/total copper ratios by depth range 
and deposit. (Ratios of over 0.1 are indicative of some oxidation, ratios of over 0.2 are 
indicative of significant oxidation and ratios of over 0.5 are indicative of dominant 
oxidation. Blank cells signify no data.) This work is from the June 2012 technical report 
and has not been updated with the additions to the drill hole data base.

0. Peripheral 0.53 0.65 0.25     

 
 The current resources make no allowance for lower mill recoveries in oxidized or 
partially-oxidized material because the distribution of oxidation could not be defined in 
the model (the acid soluble copper data are not extensive enough and the assay data 
base contains no "oxide" variable). However, the Globe, Copper Prince and Old 
Reliable deposits contain only a small percentage of the total resource, so the impacts 
are unlikely to be appreciable, but should be kept in mind as the project moves forward.

16.0   MINING METHODS 
 

16.1 Tonnage Estimate for Post Pillar Cut & Fill Mining 
 
 As a follow-up to a previous block caving study, a review of a more selective 
mining method for extracting the AE, Keel and Mammoth deposits was undertaken. The 
most effective mining method would allow extraction of the higher-grade portions of 
each deposit, at a somewhat lesser production rate, but still provide an acceptably low 
unit operating cost, deliver a higher head grade to the mill, and require less 
preproduction and sustaining capital. A review of the potential mining methods indicated 
that only a post-pillar cut and fill method would meet all of the requisite parameters. 
 
 Post-pillar cut and fill is a method similar to room and pillar mining, but allows the 
recovery of deposits that are more than 100 ft. thick. Mining proceeds from the bottom, 
upward. After each level is mined, it is backfilled with an engineered backfill. The pillars 
are designed to yield while mining the fourth or fifth lifts; so the pillar yielding occurs 
within the fill, thus limiting any movement. 
 
 MineSight mine planning software, bench maps and sections were used to 
identify higher-grade areas within the AE, Keel and Mammoth deposits, and the lower 
portion of the Childs Aldwinkle deposit, that could be mined by a post-pillar cut & fill 
method. As a basis for mine planning, four areas were selected in the Keel and 
American Eagle (AE), which could produce approximately 6,250 t/d each, for a total 
production rate of 25,000 t/d. Early production would include mining of the upper breccia 
deposits (Childs, Prince, and Globe) to take advantage of the tons and higher grades 
available from these deposits. In addition, it is assumed that the small Old Reliable open 
pit should also be included with this mine plan to provide additional tons and to provide 
a source for backfill that may be needed in the Keel/AE mining. 
 
16.1.2 Cutoff Evaluation 

 
 Since this study would be classed as a "Preliminary Economic Assessment" 
(PEA); "measured", "indicated" and "inferred" resources were included in the evaluation. 
In order to calculate the portion of the various deposits that would be available for 
mining, it was necessary to identify the resources within those deposits that might be 
economically extracted. 
 
 The economic portion of the resource is typically determined by the application of 
a breakeven cutoff grade, or NSR value, that considers the total operating cost (mine, 
plant and administration), metal price(s), process recovery(s), applicable royalties, and 
forward costs for concentrate freight, insurance, smelting and/or refining.  
 
 These parameters are equated to determine the minimum grade, grade 
equivalent, or value of metal(s) that will need to be mined in order to cover the total 
direct operating costs.

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

 
 The rock conditions in the AE and Keel deposits appear to be much better than 
parts of the breccia deposits, and the mineralization appears to be more consistent.  
 
 Although gold, silver and molybdenum are typically present in minor quantities in 
all of the deposits; only molybdenum and silver have been considered as payable bi-
product metals in this evaluation. With three metals present, it was deemed easier to 
express the breakeven cutoff grade as a copper equivalent grade. 
 
 Since the breakeven cutoff grade represents the minimum grade, or value, that 
will be mined, the average grade, or value delivered to the mill, will always be higher 
than the breakeven cutoff grade. The increment, between the breakeven cutoff grade 
and the mill head grade, provides for return of the capital investment and profit on the 
investment. 
 
 Other cutoff grades (incremental) may be employed later in the mine planning 
process, by the mine planners/management, to handle situations where mineralized 
material, with a value below the economic cutoff grade, must be mined in order to reach 
ore, or to optimize the cash flow. However, these incremental cutoff grades are not 
normally used in determining the initial, breakeven cutoff grade used to establish 
minable material. 
 
 The following algorithm illustrates the typical relationship between the various 
parameters to calculate at the breakeven cutoff copper equivalent grade: 
 

Cueq.  = 
                          Total Operating Cost 
(Cu Price + Credits – Fwd. Costs) x Cu Rec. x 20 lbs/t/% 

 
 If the breakeven cutoff is expressed as a value, it is the sum of the mine, mill, 
G&A, and forward operating costs. If an NSR (net smelter return) is used (including 
concentrate freight and royalties), it must exceed the total on-site unit operating costs. 
The following parameters were used in determining the breakeven copper equivalent 
cutoff grade: 
 
Production Rate (stpd):  25,000 
Process Recovery: 
   Copper (%) 0.890  
   Molybdenum (%) 0.840 
   Silver 0.500 
 
Smelter Recovery (%) 0.965

 The large, undiluted resource tonnage, and the relatively low copper grade, 
associated with a 0.55 Cueq. cutoff, indicated that the deposits would preferably be 
mined by a highly-productive, low operating cost mining method, such as block caving, 
or by a post-pillar cut and fill mining method. A preliminary study has indicated that 
mining the AE and Keel deposits using a block caving mining method, could not be 
economically justified. The use of a post-pillar cut and fill method allows for much more 
selectivity in the mining process, but limits the production from any one stoping area to 
less than 6,500 stpd, and results in a slightly higher mine unit operating cost.  
 
 The resource tons and grades contained within the AE, Keel, Mammoth and 
lower Childs deposit grade shells, at a 0.55 percent CuEq., were tabulated by 
Independent Mining Consultants (IMC), for each 20 foot bench height, between 
elevations 500 and 4200, with the results presented in the following Table 16.1.

 A new 20 ft x 20 ft x 20 ft model was developed by IMC based on the latest 
drilling input, and new tonnages and grades tabulated. Bench plans on 20 ft centers 
were drawn to indicate above cutoff areas in the Keel and AE deposits.  
 
 Using MineSight software, four areas, above the 0.55 percent Cueq. cutoff grade, 
were then identified, in the AE, Keel, Mammoth and lower Childs deposits, that 
contained a sufficient tonnage, which could be mined by a post-pillar cut and fill mining 
method, and each could support a production rate of 6,250 t/d. Haulage level elevations 
were then located at the base of each area.  
 
 The individual bench maps within the deposit grade shells were then reviewed for 
above cutoff grade blocks that would not support development access, or needed to be 
re-classified by location. These changes were then tabulated to reflect the minable tons 
and grades available within the resource shells. Factors for mining (external) dilution 
and recovery, based on the proposed mining method, were applied. The results of these 
exercises indicate the potentially minable tons and grades within the resource grade 
shells for the various deposits, and were used in the cash flow evaluation of the Copper 
Creek deposits. The following Table 16.2 presents a summary of the results.

16.2 Geotechnical Considerations 
 
 Call & Nicholas, Inc. (CNI) has evaluated the American Eagle, Keel, Mammoth 
and Childs deposits as potential post-pillar cut and fill operations (PPCF). The American 
Eagle and Keel deposits have similar RQD distributions and intact strength properties 
which are greater than those of the Mammoth and Childs. 
 
 Based on surface geologic structures, a room width of 20 ft is recommended 
using 4-ft long split set bolts on 3 to 4 ft centers. As additional joint set data from within 
the deposits are gathered, there is the potential for the American Eagle and Keel to be 
widened to a 25 ft room width, while in the Mammoth and Childs room widths may need 
to be reduced. 
 
 The recommended pillar widths for the American Eagle and Keel are 20 by 20 ft, 
and in the Mammoth and Childs 25 by 25 ft. These pillar widths are based on mining 
15-ft high lifts for five (5) lifts after which mining heights can be increased to 20 ft. 
 
 Because the Mammoth and Childs deposits are at, or near, surface and because 
the actual mining area is yet to be finalized, CNI used a 70 degree crack angle to 
identify where Copper Creek is likely to be impacted and where to locate potential shaft 
locations.   
 

CNI recommends diverting Copper Creek when either of the following happens: 
 
a) The fill height of the American Eagle, or Keel, is 600 ft, or

 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July 2013 

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

b) When post pillar cut and fill mining starts at either the Mammoth or Childs. 
 

 The mine schedule includes open stope mining part of the Childs and Mammoth 
deposits as the access is developed down to the American Eagle and Keel. This mining 
will be of a limited area and the backfill will be a cemented fill. Therefore, the surface 
subsidence is unlikely. 

 
 The location of potential shaft sites based on the property boundary and 
estimated crack limit can be seen in Figure 16.1. The predicted distance over which 
Copper Creek should be diverted is shown in Figure 16.1. 
 
 Shaft location Option 1 is preferred because it is at a lower elevation and further 
away from the proposed Old Reliable pit crest. 
 
 CNI's full report and details supporting these geotechnical recommendations can 
be found in Appendix 2.

16.3   Basic Mine Plan 
 
 The basic mine would access the Mammoth-Keel and AE deposits mine through 
a 33 ft diameter, 3,800 ft deep, vertical shaft located at coordinates 638765 N and 
401629 E. These coordinates may change with better definition of the deposits, surface 
topography, and Redhawk "patented" property boundaries. The current location was the 
result of evaluating four different locations, which considered the surface road access, 
deposit locations, Redhawk "patented" property boundaries, Old Reliable pit limits, and 
the projected geotechnical crack lines to the surface. This shaft size is capable of 
handling a production rate of 25,000 tons per day. 
 
 Four major production levels (16 ft x 16 ft in Section) were selected. These levels 
would allow access from the shaft to the base of the most favorably-mineralized areas 
in the Mammoth, Lower Childs, Keel and AE deposits. The uppermost level (3000 
Level) would access the bottom on the Mammoth and Lower Childs deposits, while the 
1000 and 1500 Levels would access both the Keel and AE deposits. The lowest level 
(500 Level) would access the deeper extensions of the Keel deposit only.  
 
 All four haulage level shaft stations are planned to be developed during the shaft 
sinking phase to allow level development on the 500, 1000, 1500, and 3000 levels. 
 
 Internal ramps (15 ft x 15 ft), from the major haulage levels, would allow access 
to successive mining lifts and the base of the secondary deposits located above the 
haulage levels. The initial production would be situated in four stoping areas – two in the 
Keel (one above the 1000 Level, and one above the 1500 Level), and two in the AE 
deposit – (one above the 1000 Level, and one above the 1500 Level). Each stope would 
be designed for a production rate of 6,250 tons per day, for a total production rate of 
25,000 tons per day.  
 
 Two, 20 ft diameter, approximately 3,000 ft deep, ventilation shafts would be 
sunk from the surface to the lowest level in each of the Mammoth-Keel and AE 
deposits, with connections to each of the haulage levels. Ten foot diameter, bored, rock 
and ventilation passes would connect the mining levels with the haulage levels.  
 
 Mining would proceed from the haulage level upwards in 20 ft lifts; utilizing a 
post-pillar cut and fill mining method (see Figure 16.2). Blast-hole drilling would utilize 
electric-hydraulic, two-boom, jumbos. Rock loading would be performed with 9 to10 cy 
LHD's, which would move the blasted rock from the faces, or muck bays, to rock passes 
that would transfer the blasted rock to the haulage level. Fifty-ton haulage trucks would 
move the rock from the passes to grizzlies, equipped with a rock breaker, located on 
each haulage level, approximately 1,300 ft from the shaft. The broken rock would pass 
through the grizzlies to 60-inch jaw crushers, be reduced to a nominal 6-inch product, 
and then be moved via an inclined conveyor to a 4,000 ton storage pocket located 
adjacent to the production shaft. Fifty-five ton skips would move the rock through the 
shaft to the surface (Figure 16.3).

 When a 20 ft lift has been exploited, bulkheads will be installed to contain an 
engineered backfill consisting of de-slimed mill tailings, classified mine waste, fly ash, 
and cement. When this backfill has consolidated, the next lift can be started on the top 
of the previously-excavated lift. The use of an engineered backfill will allow smaller 
pillars than would normally be allowed, to be left. This will optimize mining recovery of 
material from each of the deposits. In addition, by returning a large portion of the mill 
tailings back into the mine, the surface tailings impoundment size, and cost, can be 
minimized.    
 
 In general, the rocks at Copper Creek are very strong, with an average 
compressive strength of 10,000 to 20,000 psi, and a median RQD's in the range of 80 to 
90 percent. The phreatic surface has been interpreted to be at the level of the San 
Pedro river, which is around the 2,000 ft elevation. The surface elevation over the 
deposits is around the 4,200 ft elevation, with the upper limit of reasonably contiguous 
mineralization in both deposits being around the 2,000 ft elevation. The better 
mineralization, in the both deposits, continues downward to approximately the 500 ft 
elevation. Preliminary geotechnical investigations indicate that rooms 20 ft wide and 
20 ft high can be excavated in the rocks in the Mammoth-Keel and AE deposits, leaving 
20 ft square pillars for initial support. This would result in a mining recovery of 
75 percent. The RQD's in the breccias (Mammoth/Childs) are somewhat less, thusly 
CNI has recommended leaving 25 ft x 25 ft pillars in these areas, resulting in an overall 
recovery there of 65 percent.  
 
 The upper (above the 3500L) Childs, Prince, and Globe breccias deposits would 
be developed and mined by the previously-proposed decline and access drifts, with a 
cut and fill mining method. A third, 16 ft diameter, ventilation shaft, as previously 
discussed, would be located adjacent to the upper Childs deposit access.

16.4   Preproduction Infrastructure/Development/Equipment 
 
 The underground preproduction phase includes all surface and underground 
preparation necessary to initiate production. Typically, this includes: site preparation, 
mine surface infrastructure construction, utilities, production and ventilation shaft 
sinking, emergency escape-way system installation, equipment purchases, and the 
underground utilities, infrastructure and development necessary to initiate production. 
 
 During the preproduction period, the Company infrastructure will be limited to 
administration/quality control office trailers, while the permanent surface infrastructure is 
being constructed. 
 
 All preproduction construction and underground development is assumed to be 
performed by a mining contractor. During the preproduction phase, a training program 
will be initiated that will allow company employees to perform all production-related 
tasks once the preproduction phase is completed. 
 
 The following Table 16.3 summarizes the estimated preproduction quantities and 
construction times.

16.5  Production 
 
16.5.1 Production Personnel 
 
 Direct and indirect labor requirements were established to match the selected 
mining method, support systems, equipment and general mine requirements for a shaft-
accessed, 25,000 stpd, and underground mining operation. Personnel requirements are 
based on an operating schedule of 8 hours per shift, three shifts per day, seven days 
per week. The mine is scheduled to operate 360 days per year. Many new mines are 
now working on a two, 12 hour shift basis, which may prove to be a more effective 
schedule once more detailed engineering is completed. 
 
 It is understood that training of the work force will be an important requirement for 
the success of the project. However, this study assumes a trained workforce will be in 
place. 
 
 Personnel are presented as direct and indirect staffing for the production phase 
of the project. All preproduction development work is assumed to be performed by a 
reputable underground mining contractor. 
 
 The Owner's project and quality control team will oversee the work performed by 
the Contractor, and coordinated by the EPCM Contractor, during the preproduction 
period. 
 
 The following Table 16.5 lists the estimated direct and indirect mine labor for 
staffing a 25,000 stpd post-pillar cut and fill underground mining operation.

 With the mine scheduled at three shifts per day, seven days per week, and 
24 hours per day, a fourth crew will be required to relieve rotating labor. This additional, 
non-working labor will require additional mine office and dry facilities, and add to the 
cost of accounting for this additional labor. The work schedule for this rotation schedule 
adds approximately 6.35 percent in scheduled overtime to the mine labor costs. 
 
16.5.2 Shafts 
 
 The main production shaft will provide for essentially all of the movement of rock, 
personnel, materials, equipment, and supplies for the mine. It will also be the primary 
fresh-air ventilation intake. The shaft is a 33-ft diameter, concrete-lined shaft, equipped 
with steel sets on 20 foot centers. A 9 ft x 12 ft, counter-weighted, single deck cage will 
handle personnel, equipment, and supplies in and out of the mine. A small (10-man

capacity) "auxiliary-chippy" cage is included to handle small groups of personnel 
entering and leaving the mine. 
 
 Because of the requirement for multi-level hoisting, all hoists are assumed to be 
ground-mounted units for moving skips, the main service cage and the auxiliary man 
("Chippy") cage. The production hoist will raise 55-ton skips, moving on rope guides, at 
speeds of approximately 3,000 fpm. The hoisting capacity from a depth of 3,800 feet is 
approximately 27,000 tpd. 
 
 The main service hoist will have a 40 ton payload capacity, travel at 2,000 fpm, 
and accommodate 150 personnel. 
 
 From a 4,000 ton bin located adjacent to the shaft, crushed material will be fed 
by apron feeders onto weigh belts that load the shaft skips on each haulage level. The 
belts will load the skips directly, with a separate belt for each skip.  
 
 On the surface, the skips will discharge into a 2,000 ton steel-lined bin. Material 
from the bin will be discharged by an apron feeder to an underlying conveyor that will 
carry the material to a stacking conveyor. A reclaim system from the stacker stockpile 
will feed an overland conveyor for movement of the material to the coarse storage 
located adjacent to the mill. 
 
16.5.3 Maintenance Shops 
 
 Primary maintenance shops will be located on each haulage level adjacent to the 
# 1 exhaust ventilation shaft to allow for rapid exhausting of smoke and fumes in case of 
a fire in this area. The number of service bays is estimated from the fleet size and the 
equipment availability. The shops will be equipped to service diesel LHD's, jumbos, 
trucks, rock bolters, and support equipment. A wash bay will be positioned so that all 
equipment can be washed prior to service. A 12-ton crane will be located in the access 
drift, and smaller cranes located in each service bay. A dedicated sump will be used to 
collect mud carried into the shop area by the vehicles. 
 
 A dispatch office, lunch room, first aid and toilets will be located within the shop 
complex. Field service and repair trucks will be available for minor repairs and 
equipment lubrication. 
 
  A fuel storage station and storage tanks will be located in the shop area and fed 
by a borehole from the surface. Fuel will be dispatched daily from the surface in batches 
equal to the daily usage.

16.5.4 Explosives Storage  
 
 The underground storage facility will be constructed to accommodate ANFO, 
caps and high explosives for boosters, primers and stick powder. The explosives will be 
transported from the surface magazines via the shaft to the main underground 
magazine. Upon arriving at the underground shaft station, specially equipped and 
authorized transport trucks will deliver the explosives to the magazine by certified 
personnel. These trucks will be equipped with special warning signs and flashing lights 
on the front and rear. All other traffic in the travel way will be stopped, while the 
explosives are being transported. 
 
 The explosives will be stored in separate bays, separated by 60 feet of rock. The 
access to each storage bay will be secured with 7-foot high, locked gates, with two 
entrances provided for each bay. The location of the explosive facility will be a minimum 
of 300 feet from any blasting area, and at least 75 feet from the main travel way.  
 
16.5.5 Compressor Requirements 
 
 The preliminary design will not include a main surface compressor station 
feeding compressed air through pipes in the supply shaft to the production areas of the 
mine. Rather, a combination of portable and equipment on-board compressors will 
provide the required compressed air for local requirements. Small, fixed compressors 
will be located in the underground maintenance shops.  
 
16.5.6 Service Water Requirements 
 
 Mine service water will be supplied from the surface, as the mine is expected to 
be essentially dry. Mine service water will be needed for production and development 
drilling, wash-downs, and dust suppression. Peak usage rates are estimated to be 
approximately 675 gpm. The following Table 16.6 summarizes the estimated water 
requirements.

 For a 19.5 hour day, this would equate to approximately 790,000 gallons per day. 
Waste water collection and clarification could reduce this amount by potentially 
25 percent, or by approximately 200,000 gallons per day. 
 
 This total average water gpm requirement, over a 21 hour period, would equate 
to a total daily use of approximately 800,000 gallons per day in the underground mine. 
About 80 percent of the total gpm required, or approximately 500 gpm, would need to 
be clean water brought into the mine from the surface for drills, gland water, etc. The 
remaining 150-200 gpm, primarily needed for dust suppression, could come from water 
clarified within the mine.  
 
 Water collected from face drilling and ditches should be clarified in underground 
sumps and potentially recover about 20 percent of the 500 gpm clean water entering the 
mine, or about 100 gpm. In addition, the backfill coming into the mine from the mill will 
contain about 30 percent water. It has been assumed that one-half of this water would 
be decanted and clarified in the underground sumps and be available for dust 
suppression on roads, muck piles, crushers, etc. The decanted and clarified water from 
the backfill would amount to about 250 gpm, for a total of approximately 350 gpm 
available for dust suppression. With a need for only 150 to 200 gpm for dust 
suppression, this would indicate that only about 200 to 300 gpm of clarified water would 
need to be pumped from the mine. 
 
16.5.7 Power and Communications Systems 
 
 A primary voltage of 13.8 kV will be routed from the surface substation through 
the production shaft to underground primary substations located near the shaft station 
on each level. From there the voltage will be transformed to 4.16 kV for distribution 
throughout the level. Underground secondary transformer stations will provide feeds for 
crusher and conveyor requirements. The development and production loads will be fed

by mine load centers that will provide 440V/220V/110V power to mobile equipment and 
temporary loads.   
 
 The total estimated power consumption by the mine is summarized in the 
following Table 16.7. 
 
 Communication throughout the mine will be provided by leaky feeder radio and 
VOiP telephone secondary system. A personnel emergency dispatch system (PEDS) 
will allow one-way, mine-wide, emergency communication from the surface to all cap 
lamps equipped with the PEDS pager.

16.5.8 Ventilation 
 
 The total estimated quantity of ventilation air is estimated at 3,036,000 cfm, 
based on the equipment and personnel working within the mine, and summarized in 
Table 16.8. The basic ventilation scheme is to draw air down the production shaft and 
access decline to the upper Childs workings, pass the fresh air through the active 
mining areas and exhaust the contaminated air through three, concrete-lined, ventilation 
shafts fitted with primary exhaust fans on the surface. Within the mine active areas, 
ventilating air will be regulated with small axivane fans, stoppings and air doors.

16.5.9 Production Schedule 
 
 The full production rate of 25,000 t/d is scheduled to be produced primarily from 
four separate working areas within the Keel, and American Eagle deposits, with some 
contribution from the breccias in the early years to enhance the mill feed grade. Each 
area will normally be programmed to produce 6,250 t/d, with variations as dictated by 
mine planning. The mine is planned to operate three shifts per day, seven days per 
week, 360 days per year. Initial production is scheduled from the 1000 and 1500 levels 
in the Keel and American Eagle deposits, with two stoping areas in each deposit. The 
following Table 16.9 provides a summary of the projected production tons and grades 
for the anticipated 18-year mine life. The first year production reflects a 20 percent 
reduction from the scheduled full production rate to allow for a start-up learning curve.

17.0   RECOVERY METHODS 
 
17.1 Process Description 
 

The design criteria developed for this study is attached as Appendix 4. The 
operation is designed to process 25,000 dry tons per day. The design basis for the 
various unit operations is included in the Design Criteria.   

 
Primary crushing, SAG and ball mills, bulk rougher and cleaning flotation, 

differential copper-molybdenum flotation and concentrate filtering and handling 
operations are planned to process the design tonnage. 

 
The process plant is designed to operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week and 

360 days per year. The utilization factor used for the calculation of the nominal hourly 
flow rates is 92.5 percent. Metallurgical work indicates that copper recovery increases at 
finer grind sizes. For the purposes of this study a grind size of 80 percent passing (P80) 
of 140 microns has been specified.

17.2 ROM Handling 
 

The crushing circuit will consist of single-stage primary jaw crushers that will be 
located underground in the mine. The crushers reduce the size of run-of-mine material 
from maximum 18 inches to nominally 80 percent passing 5 inches. Crushed rock is 
transported to the surface from underground and drops into a dump hopper. An apron

feeder transfers crushed rock at a controlled rate from the dump hopper to an overland 
conveyor. Dust is controlled in the dump pocket and transfer points with water sprays. 

 
Primary crushed material will be stockpiled on the ground. One reclaim tunnel will 

be installed beneath the stockpile. The stockpile will contain approximately 25,000 tons 
of live storage. When required, material will be moved from the dead storage area to the 
live storage area by front-end loaders or bulldozers. 

 
Material will be withdrawn from the coarse reclaim stockpile by variable speed 

apron feeders (two operating and one standby). The feeders will discharge to a 
conveyor belt. Conveyor will discharge to the SAG mill in the grinding circuit. The 
reclaim rate will be monitored by a belt scale mounted on the conveyor. Crushed 
pebbles will be added at the SAG Mill Feed Conveyor. 

 
Dust control in the Coarse Ore Stockpile Area will be by the dry type dust 

collector system. It will be installed to control dust in the reclaim tunnel. 
 

17.3 Grinding Plant 
 
Material will be ground to rougher flotation feed size in a semi-autogenous (SAG) 

mill primary grinding circuit and a ball mill secondary grinding circuit. 
 
The SAG mill will operate in closed circuit with a trommel screen, pebble wash 

screen, and a pebble crusher. Trommel screen undersize will flow by gravity to the 
cyclone feed pump box. Trommel screen oversize will be transported by conveyors to 
the pebble crushing system. Tramp iron and broken media will be removed using two 
self-cleaning belt magnets that will be installed over the pebble conveyor ahead of the 
pebble crusher. A pebble wash screen, a pebble wash pump box and pebble wash 
pumps will be installed between the two pebble conveyors to wash the pebbles. The 
pebble wash pumps will discharge the pebble wash screen undersize to the cyclone 
feed pump box. 

 
The pebble crushing circuit will consist of a 200 ton SAG oversize surge bin, 

pebble crusher belt feeder and a short-head cone type crusher. Trommel screen 
oversize can be bypassed around the pebble crushing circuit via diverter gate ahead of 
the pebble crusher to the pebble conveyor which feeds the SAG mill feed conveyor. 
Trommel screen oversize will normally discharge from the transfer conveyor through the 
diverter gate into a surge bin ahead of the pebble crusher. Material will be removed 
from the surge bin by variable speed belt feeder that will feed the pebble crusher. The 
crusher will discharge onto the pebble conveyor. A belt scale mounted on a conveyor 
will monitor the SAG mill recycle rate, and another belt scale mounted on a conveyor 
will monitor the pebble crusher feed rate to the SAG mill conveyor.

rougher flotation cells (four rougher flotation cells and six rougher scavenger cells). The 
rougher flotation concentrate from the first four cells in the rougher flotation row will be 
sampled with the rougher concentrate primary sampler and pumped by the rougher 
concentrate pump (one operating and one stand-by) to the regrind cyclone feed pump-
box. The flotation concentrate from the last six cells in rougher flotation row will be 
pumped back to rougher flotation feed tank. Tailings from rougher flotation row will be 
sampled. The rougher flotation tails will flow by gravity to the tailing de-aeration tank. 
Copper-moly concentrate regrinding will be performed in a vertical mill. The vertical mill 
will operate in closed circuit with hydrocyclones. Vertical mill discharge will be combined 
with copper-moly rougher flotation concentrate and cleaner scavenger flotation 
concentrate in the copper regrind cyclone feed pump box and will be pumped by a 
variable speed horizontal centrifugal slurry pump (one operating and one stand-by) to a 
hydrocyclone cluster. Hydrocyclone underflow will feed the regrind mill which 
discharges back to the copper regrind cyclone feed pump box. Hydrocyclone overflow 
(final regrind circuit product) will flow by gravity to the copper first cleaner flotation 
circuit.

to the packaging system. Molybdenite concentrate will be bagged in Super-sacs for 
shipment by trucks to market. 

 
17.8 Tailings 
 

When the backfill plant is in operation tailings from the flotation circuit will be 
routed to a cyclone plant to recover that sand fraction for mine backfill. When the backfill 
plant is in operation, rejects from the backfill plant (slimes) will be thickened to 
approximately 50 percent solids by weight prior to transport to the TSF. When the 
backfill plant is not in operation, the flotation tailings discharge will bypass the cyclone 
plant and be transported to the thickener and TSF.

18.0   INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

18.1 Access Roads/Project Roads 
 
Currently there is an unpaved dirt road access to the proposed mine and mill site. 

For this study it was assumed that this 10 mile access road will be upgraded and paved 
to improve access to the plant site.  
 
18.2 Power Supply and Distribution 
 

Power supply options considered for the Redhawk mine include the local utility 
and on-site power generation, using natural gas as fuel. The local utility, APS (Arizona 
Public Service), is the primary option whereas, on-site generation using gas turbine 
engine for generating electricity was considered as a potential alternative.  

 
The Redhawk mine is within the service territory of APS. Utility power is 

considered to be supplied to the mine via a high voltage overhead transmission line, 
about 20 miles long, from San Manuel substation. The line will be capable of handling 
the entire power requirement of 50MW for the Redhawk mine project. The power supply 
voltage will be stepped down to distribution voltage via overhead and/or underground 
power lines to the different facilities of the mine. The main substation will be located in 
close proximity to the concentrator that houses the biggest loads of the mine. The 
distribution voltage will be stepped down as required for medium voltage and low 
voltage applications. A SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system will 
be utilized for controlling mechanical systems, based on feedback signals from motor 
control centers and instruments via PLCs (programmable logic controllers). All electrical 
installations, including transformers, switchgear, motor control centers, instrument 
controls, lighting and grounding design to be as per the National Electric Code (NEC) 
requirements and in accordance with NEMA and ANSI standards.  

 
The power supply option for on-site power generation includes installing a gas 

pipeline for transporting high pressure natural gas to a gas turbine engine, installed at 
the mine site, which will generate electricity and be transmitted via the on-site power 
distribution system.  
 
18.3  Water Supply and Distribution 
 
 The investigation of a source for mine water is in progress. The well field target 
has been selected in the alluvial pediment of Galiuro Mountains to the west of the 
mining area on state owned land. Ground-water withdrawal is prohibited inside a three 
mile buffer zone that parallels the San Pedro River. Well targets have been identified 
outside the buffer along Redhawk's state land right of way, and a permit to drill 
exploration wells has been submitted to the Arizona Department of Water Resources.

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  
 

The proposed well field is located in the vicinity of an existing state-owned well where 
preliminary pumping tests yielded encouraging results.   
 

The milling and process system requires raw water from water wells. The well 
field is located about 10.6 miles west of the site. The wells are connected via distribution 
pipelines to a holding tank at the first transfer pump station. Three pump stations are 
required to transport the water to the final holding tank above the plant site.  

 
The raw water distribution system provides raw water only for process 

requirements such as reagent mixing, and gland water. The firewater system and 
potable water system do not draw water from the process raw water tank. Process raw 
water storage is sufficient for a short (nominally two to three hours) disruption of the raw 
water supply pumps. All other reagent preparation systems use water from the process 
raw water tank. Gland water pumps also draw directly from the raw water tank. 

 
The copper-moly process water tank receives tailings thickener overflow and 

tailings reclaim water and raw water if sufficient reclaim water is not available. The 
water is pumped to the grinding circuit and may contain a small amount of solids so it is 
not suitable for general distribution throughout the process plant. 

 
Water reclaimed from the copper thickener, moly thickener, copper filter and 

moly filter will contain residual hydrosulfide and will be recycled internal to the moly 
plant as operations allow.  
 
18.4 Project Water Balance 
 
 A water balance for the Tailings impoundment is included in Table 18.1. The 
primary water loss is associated with water that is permanently bound or entrained 
within the pore space of the tailings solids. Additional losses include evaporation from 
the TSF pond free water surface and water lost to evaporation on the tailings beach.   
 
 Post deposition dry densities of 60 and 68 pounds per cubic foot (pcf) are used to 
estimate the entrained water losses for the backfill plant rejects and whole tailings 
(backfill plant by-pass), respectively. Impoundment volume assumes an average post 
deposition dry density of 75 pcf. The higher post deposition density reflects ongoing 
consolidation of the tailings through both natural processes and managed deposition.

 Water inflows include the process water contained in the tailings slurry, direct 
precipitation on the tailings surface, and surface water runon from external areas that 
cannot be diverted.     
 
 The solids content of thickened backfill plant rejects is assumed to be 50 percent. 
The solids content of the backfill plant by-pass whole tailings is assumed to be 60 
percent. An average of 2,261 gpm of water will be delivered to the tailings impoundment 
with the tailings slurry. The water balance analysis for the TSF indicates an average of 
approximately 462 gpm will be recovered from the TSF. Reclaim rates will vary subject 
to seasonal and climatic factors. An average of approximately 1,800 gpm of makeup 
water will be required to offset TSF losses.    
 
 Additional water will be entrained with the mine backfill. The cyclone overflow 
used for mine backfill will have a solids content of approximately 70 percent by weight, 
and will include 223 tons per hour (tph) of water. Approximately 50 percent of the water 
delivered with the backfill to the underground will be entrained with the backfill. Backfill 
drainage will be collected and returned to the surface. 18.2 summarizes estimate water 
usage rates for the proposed 25,000 ton per day mining operation.

18.5.1 Location 
 
 The PEA level layout of the proposed tailings storage facility (TSF) is shown on 
Figure 18.1. The facility is located on state land in Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 in T8S, R18E, 
approximately 4.2 miles west of the Saloon Gulch shaft site, and is just north of the 
existing Copper Creek Road alignment. The elevation at the TSF site ranges from 3590 
to 3950 feet above mean sea level (amsl). This location allows the utilization of four 
contributing "fingers" within Well Canyon. A relatively small saddle dam will also be 
required for later phases (3 through 5) on the northernmost finger.

18.5.2 Tailings Characteristics 
 
 The TSF will be used to contain tailings whose characteristics change subject to 
backfill plant operation. While mine backfill is in progress, the flotation tailings stream 
will be passed through cyclones. The coarse sand fraction (cyclone underflow) will be 
amended with Portland cement and used for underground mine hydraulic backfill. The 
cyclone overflow (backfill plant rejects) will be thickened to an anticipated solids content 
of 50 percent and deposited in the TSF. In order to fill the underground voids with 
hydraulic fill, backfill plant utilization will need to be on the order of 74 percent. The 
backfill plant rejects will be delivered to the TSF at an average rate of 9,250 tpd. 
 
 While the backfill plant is not in operation, the flotation tailings stream will by-
pass the cyclones and be routed directly to the thickener and TSF. Based on backfill 
plant utilization requirements, this will occur approximately 26 percent of the time. It is 
assumed that the backfill plant by pass will be delivered to the TSF at a solids content of 
approximately 60 percent by weight at an average rate of 6,500 tpd. The TSF will 
receive approximately 15,750 tons of tailings solids per day. 
 
18.5.3 TSF Description 
 
 The proposed TSF will consist of a Phase 1 starter dam constructed to the 
elevation of 3,760 feet amsl and four downstream dam raises (phases 2 through 5) 
constructed with locally borrowed fill material. Table 18.3 illustrates elevation versus 
capacity and rate of rise relationships for the proposed TSF. The site is located on 
alluvial valley fill and is not anticipated to require drilling and blasting to generate local 
borrow material. It is assumed that local borrow materials will be used to construct the 
dam; however, development waste from the underground mine and overburden 
generated from the Old Reliable satellite pit  could potentially be used as fill. Use of 
mine waste for dam fill could potentially reduce capital construction costs.

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

 Common TSF embankment construction practice at copper mining operations in 
the southwest involves earthen starter dam construction with subsequent raises 
constructed by the upstream method using tailings sand. Adoption of the upstream raise 
method is contingent on the development of a well-drained embankment and upper 
tailings beach to support raise foundation loads. The downstream raise method is 
considered for the Copper Creek mining operation because much of the material 
discharged into the TSF will consist of rejects (cyclone overflow slimes) from the backfill 
plant which are anticipated to exhibit higher moisture content, lower permeability and 
slower rates of consolidation relative to the whole tailings disposed of at most base 
metal mining projects where hydraulic backfill is not employed. As such, foundation 
conditions suitable for the construction of upstream embankment raises cannot be 
assumed with confidence. Alternative embankment raise options, which could 
potentially reduce earthworks costs if conditions warrant their use, are discussed in 
Section 26. Note that the rate of tailings rise will be under 10 ft per year for the 
proposed TSF after Year 4. Low rates of rise may facilitate alternative raise construction 
methods. 
 
 Tailings will be discharged into the TSF via multiple spigot points located on the 
crest of the tailings embankment and around the TSF periphery. The TSF will include a 
system of underdrains (finger drains) constructed in natural drainage channels on the 
TSF floor. Underdrains are assumed to consist of perforated, corrugated polyethylene 
pipe (PCPE) placed in a drain-fill envelope. Underdrainage will be routed to a seepage 
collection pond located downstream of the TSF embankment. 
 
18.5.4 Surface Water Management 
 
 Due to the nature of the topography within Well Canyon, it is generally 
impractical to divert external area runoff away from the TSF. The site does have a 
limited upstream contributing area; however, it is anticipated that sufficient freeboard will 
be maintained in the TSF to accommodate storm water associated with the design 
storm event. The TSF site is remote from infrastructure and human habitations. Due to 
the potential for environmental damage, a design storm based on probable maximum 
precipitation is assumed. At closure, a spillway will be required that is capable of 
passing the peak discharge associated with the design storm event.  
 
18.5.5 Water Reclaim 
 
 The water reclaim system will consist of barge mounted pumps inside the TSF 
and barge mounted or submersible turbine pumps located in the seepage reclaim pond. 
It is assumed that both systems will be capable of transporting water back to the 
processing facilities at a rate that is greater than or equal to the average TSF process 
water inflow rate. For this PEA, the process water inflow rate is estimated to be an 
average of approximately 2,300 gpm.

18.6 Diversion Tunnel 
 
 Underground mining is predicted to result in subsidence of the ground surface 
over the underground stopes. Cracks could propagate to the ground surface and could 
impact the flow of surface water in Copper Creek. The PEA considers the construction 
of a diversion tunnel to intercept surface flow in Copper Creek upstream of the 
subsidence area. Surface flows will be released in Dark Canyon below the mine 
disturbance area and the subsidence crack limit, and above the confluence of Dark 
Canyon and Copper Creek. 
 
 The diversion tunnel preliminary design storm is the 100-year, 24-hour event. 
Components of the Copper Creek diversion include an earthen check dam in Copper 
Creek upstream of the projected crack limit. The purpose of the check dam is to 
attenuate flood flows associated with major storm events, and generate head at the 
tunnel inlet. The inlet to the diversion is assumed to be a concrete headwall/wingwall 
structure with a trash rack/security grate. Based on a PEA level tunnel layout, the tunnel 
length is estimated to be 7,540 feet. Tunnel diameter will be twelve feet. 
 
 Tunneling is assumed to be completed with a tunnel boring machine. It is 
anticipated that the majority of the tunnel route will be in competent granodiorite; 
however,  diversion tunnel costs include structural lining.  
 
 A concrete outlet structure and security grate will be constructed at the tunnel 
outlet in Dark Canyon. 
 
18.7 Hydraulic Backfill Plant Description 
 
 The Hydraulic Backfill Plant considered in this study is designed based on a 
mining rate of 25,000 tons/d. The proposed Hydraulic Backfill Plant will produce 
sufficient hydraulic backfill to fill 85 percent of the void in the underground mine. It is 
assumed the remainder of the void will be filled by waste rock or it is not required for

 The Hydraulic Backfill Plant will process all mill tailings sent from the mill tailings 
pump-box. Hydraulic backfill is prepared by processing mill tailings through 
hydrocyclones to remove the fine tailings solids (referred to as slimes). Approximately 
50 wt% of solids in the tailings are removed as slimes. The slimes from the 
hydrocyclones overflow will be thickened and transported to the Tailings Storage Facility 
(TSF). The hydrocyclones also act as a dewatering process to produce dewatered 
coarse tailings in the underflow. The coarse particles from the cyclone underflow 
(referred to as sands) are mixed with binder in an agitated mix tank to a hydraulic 
backfill consistency. The resulting hydraulic backfill is discharged to the underground 
stopes via a underground piping distribution system.  
 
 The Hydraulic Backfill Plant will be capable to produce hydraulic backfill with 
different UCS by adjusting the amount of cement addition to the backfill, to 
accommodate the strength requirements in the stopes. For this study, it is assumed an 
average of 5 percent binder content is required for backfill.  
 
 The Hydraulic Backfill Plant contains various equipment and associated 
instrumentation that will operate in sequence to produce the hydraulic backfill for use in 
the underground. The major components include the hydrocyclones, binder system, 
mixing tank and the discharge pumps to the underground distribution system. It is 
assumed the Hydraulic Backfill Plant will be located in close proximity to the mill. It is 
anticipated that compressed air required for the backfill plant will be supplied by the 
mill's compressed air system. 
 
Hydrocyclones 
 
 A cyclopack consisting of multiple hydrocyclones will be utilized to remove the 
fine particles and water in the tailings through the overflow. The slurry will enter the 
hydrocyclones at approximately 25 wt% solids. Finer particles and the majority of the 
water will leave as overflow. The thickened coarse tailings will exit from the underflow at 
approximately 70 wt% solids. 
 
Binder System 
 
 The binder system will add binder at a rate proportional to the weight of solids in 
the slurry. The rate can also be varied in order to meet the strength requirement of the 
backfill. 
 
 Binder will be delivered to site by trucks and transfer to the silos pneumatically. 
The binder system will consist of two large binder storage silos, with a total capacity to 
hold 2 days of cement usage. Normal Portland Cement (NPC) has been considered as 
the binder in this study. Alternatively, a blend of NPC, slag cement or fly ash can be 
used to reduce binder operating costs.

Mixing Tank 
 
 Thickened coarse tailings from the hydrocyclones underflow, binder, and water 
will be continuously added into the mixing tank during operation. The mixing tank will 
blend the materials to a consistency suitable for hydraulic backfill. The hydraulic fill 
pumps will discharge the hydraulic backfill to the underground stopes. It is expected the 
mixing tank will have a retention time of one minute.

20.0   ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND 
SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 
20.1 Hydrogeological 
 
Water Resources Review and Water Supply 
 
 Past investigation data compiled by Water Management Consultants (WMC) of 
Tucson, Arizona were reviewed for the purposes of evaluating the potential for a 
continuous supply of groundwater at a rate of from 400 to 500 gpm from a location near 
the project area. The Water Management report describes the groundwater yield 
potentials for the various rock types located throughout the region and concluded that 
the basin fill sediments assigned to the Gila Conglomerate would provide the greatest 
groundwater production potential. As a result of this interpretation four test wells were 
installed by WMC at various locations in the Gila Conglomerate. These test well 
locations are west of the project area by less than 1/2 mile.   
 
 A 48 hour aquifer test was conducted at Test Well WW-4R and Test Well WW-
1R was used as an observation well. Data from these tests suggest that the aquifer is 
capable of producing sufficient short-term discharge rates for the planned operation. 
The specific capacity, discharge (gpm) divided by drawdown (ft), value of 5.1 calculated 
from the test data suggests that the aquifer is capable of providing approximately 5 gpm 
for every ft of drawdown during short term pumping. The significant caveats to this 
interpretation are that the aquifer test was performed for only 48 hours, at a discharge 
rate of only 50 gpm, and that the test and observation wells are located fairly close to 
the range-front fault system. Range-front fault systems generally behave as aquitards 
and can significantly impede groundwater flow to nearby wells.    
 
 In light of this preliminary and limited testing Golder Associates was authorized to 
conduct a regional hydrogeological investigation and well siting study. The complete 
technical memorandum is provided in Appendix 7-A. The hydrogeological study was 
expanded from the area studied by WMC to include other major hydrogeological regions 
of the San Pedro river basin including areas with historic high yield and deep production 
wells. 
 
 As is typical for deep basins throughout Arizona, groundwater movement is from 
higher elevations in the mountains towards the valley floor. In the San Pedro Valley the 
groundwater flows towards the center of the basin and then northwest parallel to the 
San Pedro River, as indicated by the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) 
well and water depth information. The primary basin-fill aquifer system is separated 
from the fractured bedrock aquifer by a west-dipping, mountain bounding fault system. 
The mountain bounding fault is thought to act as a limited recharge feature in select 
areas but generally acts as an aquitard impeding the movement of groundwater. 
Groundwater moves readily between the younger and older basin-fill units, and between 
the streambed alluvium and the basin fill units.

 Gradients calculated from groundwater elevation data indicate that gradients 
within the central unconsolidated river gravels are approximately 0.004 ft per ft (ft/ft). 
Steeper gradients of 0.06 and 0.03 ft/ft are present within the basin-fill and alluvial fan 
sediments, respectively. Areas with lower groundwater gradients have relatively wider 
spaced contour lines than areas with steeper gradients. Areas with relatively flatter 
gradients are indicative of regions with higher hydraulic conductivity values, leading to 
potentially higher groundwater production values from correctly designed and 
constructed production wells.   
 
 Mountain front recharge is thought to be the main source of recharge for the 
basin fill aquifer systems. Recharge to the basin-fill aquifer systems is also thought to 
occur as infiltration from streambed alluvium. Direct infiltration on mountain front 
pediments is considered negligible due to high evaporation rates and low rainfall totals. 
 
 The lower San Pedro river basin contains two major water-bearing units:  the 
streambed Holocene alluvium that forms the San Pedro River channel and floodplain, 
and the alluvial basin fill deposits that are composed of a younger basin-fill, older basin-
fill, and a basal conglomerate. The basin-fill deposits form the basin's primary aquifer 
because of their high permeability and large groundwater storage. However due to 
recent surface water adjudication, water rights, and permitting issues, groundwater from 
the upper San Pedro River aquifer including its base flow (Holocene alluvium) should 
not be considered as potential supply water for the Copper Creek project. The Golder 
study concentrated on the lower basin fill groundwater that is believed to be 
hydrologically isolated from the San Pedro River Holocene alluvial system. 
 
 Regionally, the hydrologic characteristics of the lower basin fill aquifer can vary 
widely due to compaction and the presence of fine-grained units within the basin-fill 
sediments. Due to this variability of basin-fill sediments, the groundwater yields from 
wells drilled in the basin fill along the east side of the valley range from yields of 70 gpm 
to as much as 1,900 gpm. Well records indicate that the wells with high yields are 
pumping from both the lower and upper aquifers. Towards the center of the valley, 
groundwater from wells within the lower aquifer system are found to exhibit artesian 
conditions. Most wells drilled deeper than 500 ft encounter artesian conditions 
especially in sand and gravel layers 600 to 800 and 1,200 to 1,300 ft below ground 
surface (bgs). Away from the river valley towards the Galiuro Mountains information on 
groundwater is poor. 
 
 As a result of the hydrogeological well sitting study four locations had been 
identified with hydrogeological and logistical characteristics thought to be suitable for 
the siting of production wells. However, due to adjudication of groundwater within the 
basin, ADWR is reluctant to provide groundwater exploration permits within a three-mile 
radius of the active channel of the San Pedro River.

 The existence of two previously installed wells along Copper Creek Road 
provided an opportunity to obtain hydrologic test data without drilling new groundwater 
exploration holes. The two wells (55-615551 and 55-615552) were drilled and 
constructed approximately 450 ft apart in Sections 14 and 15 of Township 8 South, 
Range 17 East. The boreholes were drilled to depths of 360 and 2,074 ft below ground 
surface respectively (See Appendix 7-A Figure 3). The land is currently leased to the 
Mercer Ranch and a stock water pump is installed in well 55-615552. Discussions with 
local residents indicate that this well provided water to past operations in Copper Creek 
and was pumped at 600 gallons per minute (gpm). Golder conducted a constant-rate 
aquifer test at well 55-615552 on December 8, 2011. The well was pumped for 24 hours 
at an average rate of 294 gpm and recorded a total drawdown of 162 ft bgs. Analysis of 
the test data were used to estimate aquifer parameters of the basin fill sediments within 
the immediate area of the well 55-651552. The aquifer test technical memorandum is 
provided as Appendix 7-B.  
  

Using the estimated aquifer parameters of the basin fill sediments from the well 
test, Golder conducted a well spacing study in the area of the existing Right-Of-Way 
(ROW) for the Copper Creek project. Analytical modeling was performed to simulate the 
drawdown from multiple pumping wells to evaluate the overall spacing needed between 
future wells, assuming a planned aquifer withdrawal rate of 800 gpm per well, or 5,600 
gpm total. The drawdown analysis was performed using AQTESOLV Pro © (v.4.5) 
(Duffield, 2007), which has the capability of simulating drawdown from multiple pumping 
wells using the Theis equation and assumes a flat, infinite aquifer. The aquifer test 
technical memorandum is provided as Appendix 7-C. From the studies discussed above 
and field exploration, a total of five sites have been selected for further investigation of 
groundwater production. A sixth site, for a piezometer only, has been proposed for 
stratigraphic investigation. The purpose is to evaluate the proposed hydraulic 
disconnection between the deep aquifer and the Holocene alluvial aquifer of the San 
Pedro River system. This site is between the three-mile buffer zone and the active 
channel of the San Pedro River.   
 

The five sites selected for further investigation of groundwater production were 
sited based on several factors. First, the sites had to be outside of the three-mile buffer 
zone of the active channel of the San Pedro River. Second, the sites had to be as near 
the existing ROW as possible for access to future water pipeline routes. Lastly, the sites 
should be as near to the break in pediment elevation (indicating a possible buried fault) 
as possible. 

 
All six well sites have been submitted to the Arizona State Land Department 

(ASLD) for inclusion into a Supplemental Land Use Permit (SLUP). The SLUP is an 
extension to the ROW which allows Redhawk to conduct groundwater exploration 
drilling at the proposed sites.

groundwater test/production wells and piezometer well installation programs. 
 

 
 
20.2 Geochemical Considerations 
 
20.2.1   Properties of Development Rock 
 
 An analysis of the geochemical properties of the mine development rock from the 
Mammoth and Childs-Aldwinkle breccia areas has been performed. Test results indicate 
that the country rock in the vicinity of the initial breccia mining operation has a low 
potential for acid generation, and drainage from the development rock is expected to be 
of good quality. Similar testing has not been performed for development rock in the 
vicinity of the deeper porphyry mineralization of the Keel and American Eagle deposits. 
   
 Future development rock is likely to be consumed in mining backfill operations to 
increase backfill strength and to develop a surface layer capable of supporting mining 
equipment traffic for room and pillar mining. At present, a permanent surface storage 
facility for development rock is not being considered; however, geochemical

characterization of development rock in accordance with Arizona Mining Guidance 
standards is likely to be required as a condition of permitting.   
 
20.2.2   Geochemical Properties of Tailings      
 
 To date, an analysis of the geochemical properties of the future tailings has not 
been performed. The material is expected to contain residual pyrite and could exhibit 
acid generating potential. While the arsenic mineral tennantite is also known to occur at 
Copper Creek, its distribution in the initial breccia mining targets is estimated to be 
limited. While tennantite is reported to be insoluble under neutral to alkaline pH 
conditions, oxidation of tennantite following tailings disposal could result in the 
mobilization of arsenic. The potential for acid generation and/or leachable arsenic could 
lead to a requirement for lined tailings disposal facilities to mitigate impacts to water 
resources.   
 
20.2.3 Geochemical Characterization Costs 
 
 Initial, pre-start-up characterization of process tailings, development rock and 
process water will be required in accordance with Arizona Mining Guidance Tier 1 and 2 
testing standards. The need to conduct extended kinetic testing to evaluate acid 
generating potential is assumed. A geochemical characterization study can be expected 
to require 30 to 40 weeks to complete if conventional kinetic testing is undertaken. The 
time required to complete geochemical characterization studies could be considerably 
longer if the bench and pilot scale studies must be conducted to produce representative 
samples.   
 
20.3 Environmental Permitting 
 
 The discussion below provides a comprehensive discussion of potential 
environmental permitting considerations for the project. Some key considerations with 
regard to cost and schedule include: 
 

▪ Proximity (less than 2 miles) of the Galiuro Wilderness Area, a Class I air 
shed 

 
▪ Significant historic mining features throughout the project area 

 
▪ Significant NEPA review requirements and associated public involvement 

 
 In addition, the project has several favorable attributes from a permitting 
perspective, including proximity to existing mining districts and associated infrastructure, 
and remoteness from residential and urban centers.

BLM Approvals 
 
 Because significant portions of the project are located on lands managed by the 
Bureau of Land Management (BLM), it is assumed for this evaluation that a Mine Plan 
of Operations (MPO) will be required for development of the project. Once the MPO has 
been submitted, the BLM will begin its review process under NEPA. 
 
 NEPA analysis includes a number of resource areas (endangered species, 
historic properties, air, water, etc.) and requires public involvement. In general, a given 
project will fall into one of three categories, described below in ascending order of 
difficulty level. 
 

▪ Categorical exclusion - Projects in this category are small or insignificant 
enough that an extensive public review process is not required. For 
categorical exclusions, the BLM is required to document that the impacts of 
the proposed project will not result in significant effects to the environment, 
and that the activity conforms with a prescribed set ("category") of low-impact 
actions. 

 
▪ Environmental Assessment (EA) - An EA requires a full analysis of impacts 

to a host of environmental resource areas, as well as public scoping to 
determine additional potential environmental resources to be evaluated. In 
order for a project to be approved, the EA must result in a Finding of No 
Significant Impact (FONSI) to the evaluated environmental resources. Note 
that a FONSI can be achieved through mitigation efforts proposed by the 
project proponent. 

 
▪ Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) - An EIS is an expanded EA, for 

projects in which a FONSI is not anticipated to be acquired. The EIS results in 
a Record of Decision (ROD) outlining the evaluated impacts of the project, 
along with the mitigation responsibilities of the project proponent. 

 
 Given the size of the project, it is assumed for the purposes of this analysis that 
an EIS will be required. Following submittal of the MPO, public scoping is initiated by 
the lead federal agency (in this case, BLM) in order to identify potential environmental 
concerns. The impacts of the project are then evaluated for a suite of environmental 
resources, both from a standard BLM list and those resources identified during scoping. 
These resource areas include, but are not limited to: 
 

▪ Access and recreation 
▪ Agriculture and grazing 
▪ Visual resources 
▪ Air quality 
▪ Geology 
▪ Soils

▪ Groundwater 
▪ Surface water 
▪ Vegetation 
▪ Wildlife 
▪ Special interest species 
▪ Cultural resources 
▪ Socioeconomic resources 
▪ Infrastructure 
▪ Traffic/transportation 

 
 Alternatives to the proposed project are developed as part of the EIS process, 
and are often derived as a result of comments received during scoping. These 
alternatives are all evaluated for the same environmental parameters. In addition, 
because the approval of a Mine Plan of Operations is a federal action, compliance with 
the Endangered Species Act (ESA, Section 7) and National Historic Preservation Act 
(NHPA, Section 106) is required (see below).   
 
 Given the potentially significant processing times for the NEPA effort, it is 
advisable to approach the BLM as early in the permitting process as possible. 
 
Clean Air Act 
 
 Air quality is regulated at the federal level by the EPA under the Clean Air Act 
(CAA). The CAA requires maintenance of ambient air quality, as indicated by 
concentrations of six "criteria pollutants" (ozone, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, 
sulfur dioxide, particulate matter less than 2.5 microns and less than 10 microns 
aerodynamic diameter [PM2.5 and PM10], and lead). National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS) have been established for each of the criteria pollutants. The CAA 
requires that each state develop a State Implementation Plan (SIP) describing how 
these standards will be met. Air quality control regions (AQCRs) within each state are 
designated to assist in evaluating ambient air quality. Each AQCR is evaluated to 
determine if the NAAQS are met, and areas not meeting the standards are designated 
as "non-attainment" for the particular criteria pollutant that exceeds the relevant 
standard. The SIP must explain how the non-attainment areas will be managed in order 
to meet any standards not attained.   
 
 ADEQ has also developed a SIP to address regional haze, in concert with other 
states in the southwestern U.S. The regional haze SIP was finalized and submitted to 
the EPA on March 2, 2011, and includes the Galiuro Wilderness Area (a Class I 
airshed).  
 
 Air emissions are regulated under the CAA in the context of the NAAQS. The law 
and regulations differentiate between mobile and stationary sources, as well as between 
new and existing facilities. Mobile sources are typically vehicles, and regulated 
emissions from vehicles include both engine (exhaust) emissions and dust generation

(from, for example, haul truck operation on dirt roads). Exhaust emission standards 
have been established by the EPA based on the NAAQS (with more stringent standards 
adopted by some states, but not Arizona). New or modified existing stationary sources 
must meet performance standards, referred to as New Source Performance Standards 
(NSPS), established by the EPA for certain categories of sources. The standard of 
performance for a particular facility is based on the application of the best available 
system of emission reduction, taking into consideration cost. New major sources are 
subject to preconstruction review, with different standards and levels of review applied 
to facilities proposed within attainment areas ("Prevention of Significant Deterioration" 
requirements) and non-attainment or non-classifiable areas ("New Source Review" 
requirements). 
 
 The permitting components of the CAA for stationary sources are described in 
Title V of the Act; thus, air emission operating permits are commonly referred to as Title 
V permits. These permits comprehensively address all relevant air emissions limitations, 
and monitoring and reporting requirements. Mining operations qualify as Class I major 
sources, and must be permitted accordingly. 
 
 The project area is located within or very near proximity to the San Manuel Sulfur 
Dioxide Non-Attainment Area, designated as a result of emissions from BHP's copper 
smelter stack and fugitive emissions. Operations at the San Manuel smelter ceased in 
2002. In June 2002, ADEQ submitted to EPA the San Manuel Sulfur Dioxide 
Nonattainment Area State Implementation and Maintenance Plan showing attainment of 
the federal standard was reached and requesting redesignation to attainment. Included 
in the plan are emission limits for the smelters as codified in Arizona Administrative 
Code R18-2-715 and 715.01. In 2007, this area was redesignated to attainment. 
 
 The project area is less than two miles from the Galiuro Wilderness Area, a 
Class I airshed. The Title V permit application for this facility would be subject to 
preconstruction review under the New Source Review provisions, and the permit would 
have to comply with the Arizona regional haze SIP. 
 
 For the Copper Creek project, it is anticipated that CAA permitting would consist 
of application for a new Title V permit for a new mill; no other aspects of the project are 
anticipated to require permitting of air emissions. Modeling emissions will require site 
meteorological data (including wind rose data), along with mill throughput and emission 
control data. The modeling exercise can only be accomplished through utilization of 
technical data from a specified project plan; modeling based on surrogates can be 
useful for identifying key issues but does not substitute for site-specific data and 
equipment specifications. Thus, a highly developed project plan is required to complete 
this analysis.

CWA Section 404 Permit 
  
 A CWA Section 404 permit is required if a project will result in the discharge of 
dredged or fill material into jurisdictional waters of the U.S. (waters). The U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers (Corps) administers the Section 404 program. The definition of 
waters is broad; the Corps has commonly asserted jurisdiction over the typically dry 
arroyos or washes found throughout Arizona. Guidance related to the identification of 
waters was promulgated in 2007 (and revised in 2008) which has had the effect of 
limiting the scope of Corps jurisdiction over some ephemeral washes. A jurisdictional 
waters determination will be completed for the Copper Creek Project area to determine 
the extent of Corps jurisdiction, though it is anticipated that at the very least Copper 
Creek itself is likely jurisdictional. 
 
 Two primary Section 404 permitting avenues are available to project proponents:  
the Individual Permit (IP) and the Nationwide Permit (NWP). NWPs are available for 
certain specified categories and sizes of disturbance that result in only "minimal impact 
to the aquatic environment". Individual Permits are required for larger projects or 
projects whose activities are not covered by the NWP program. The effort to obtain a 
Section 404 permit varies considerably both in time and cost, depending on the type 
and extent of the impacts. An Individual Permit can take up to two years and cost 
between US$ 100,000 and US$ 300,000. A NWP, on the other hand, can be 
accomplished in six to nine months, generally for less than US$ 20,000. The need for 
either permit type constitutes a federal nexus that requires compliance with the ESA 
and NHPA (see below). 
 
 For the purposes of this evaluation, given the proposed impacts to Copper 
Creek, it is reasonable to assume that an Individual Permit will be required for the 
project. As described above, the Individual Permit process is, in general, more time- and 
labor-intensive than the process for NWPs. The following steps are required to obtain 
the Individual Permit. 
 

▪ CWA Section 404 Application - The Corps requires completion and 
submittal of Form ENG 4345, the CWA 404 permit application form. 
Supplementary information, including a complete project description and 
graphical representation of proposed activities and their relation to waters, is 
usually required as part of the application package. 

 
▪ 404(b)(1) Alternatives Analysis - A 404(b)(1) Alternatives Analysis is an 

evaluation of the proposed project's purpose and need, and demonstration 
that it is the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative (LEDPA). 
Development of alternatives for the 404(b)(1) analysis would inform the 
development of the BLM's EIS (see above). 

 
▪ Habitat Mitigation and Monitoring Plan (HMMP) - The Corps requires the 

applicant to provide a plan describing compensatory mitigation for the loss of 



Redhawk Copper, Inc. - Copper Creek PEA 25,000 TPD Mill Page 195  

 
 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July  2013

waters. Generally, the project proponent may mitigate for loss of waters by 
replacing them with constructed wetland projects or planned enhancements 
of riparian areas, or by negotiating a fee in-lieu of mitigation arrangement. 
Current rule requires the Corps and the applicant to first consider a mitigation 
bank (though none currently exists in Arizona) or an in-lieu fee payment (in-
lieu fee projects in Arizona are currently being developed and approved). 

 
▪ Public Notice - For Individual Permits, the Corps is required to publish a 

Public Notice (PN) describing the project and its anticipated impacts to 
environmental resources. Public comments are solicited during a 15- to 30-
day public comment period which follows the publication of the PN. The 
applicant is then required to draft a response to any comments received by 
the Corps as part of the PN process. 

 
▪ NEPA Compliance - Preparation of an Environmental Assessment (EA) (or, 

less commonly, an EIS) is required by the Corps to satisfy their obligation for 
environmental review under NEPA. Review and incorporation of responses to 
comments received during the required public review process is required. 
This analysis assumes that the Corps' obligations will be achieved through a 
cooperating agency arrangement with the BLM's NEPA process. 

 
▪ CWA Section 401 State Water Quality Certification - Under Section 401 of 

the CWA, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) reviews 
proposed projects for water quality compliance. ADEQ may grant or deny 
certification for any Section 404 permit based on the anticipated water quality 
impact of the project, and typically provides conditions for protecting water 
quality that the Corps then incorporates into the 404 permit. 

 
 Once the jurisdictional waters determination has been completed and approved 
by the Corps, the scope of the Section 404 permitting effort will be determined. Again, it 
is anticipated that an individual permit will be required. 
 
Endangered Species Act Compliance 
 
 Section 7 of the ESA requires that, for any federally permitted action, the 
permitting authority must evaluate the potential impact of a project to federally listed 
species. If the lead federal agency determines that the project may affect a listed 
species, consultation with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) will be 
required. For the development of the Copper Creek Project, consultation with USFWS 
would be required for either the CWA Section 404 permit or the Mine Plan of Operations 
for the BLM. It is anticipated that the BLM would act as the lead federal agency for the 
purpose of the Section 7 consultation. 
 
 Even in the absence of a federal nexus, listed species are protected under the 
Section 9 'take' provision, which prohibits the harming, harassing, injuring, or killing of a

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

federally listed threatened or endangered species. However, take applies only to wildlife 
(property of the state), not plants (which are owned by the property owner). In the 
absence of a federal nexus, federally listed plants on private property are protected by 
state and local plant protection laws and ordinances. 
 
 Given the location of the project area and the nature of the onsite habitat, three 
federally listed species are anticipated to have a reasonable potential to occur on the 
project area:  southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus; SWWF), lesser 
long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae; LLNB), and Chiricahua leopard frog (Rana 
chiricahuensis). A more detailed discussion of these species is provided below. 
 
 In addition, the May 10, 2011, WildEarth Guardians v. Salazar court settlement 
requires the USFWS to submit a Proposed Rule or a not-warranted finding to the 
Federal Register for over 250 species currently considered as "candidates" for listing 
under the endangered species act. On that list is one species, the Sonoran desert 
tortoise (Gopherus morafkai), which may occur in the project area or vicinity. The 
USFWS is required to make a determination regarding the Sonoran desert tortoise no 
later than the end of FY 2015 (September 30, 2015). For that reason, a more detailed 
discussion regarding that species is provided here. 
 
Southwestern Willow Flycatcher 
 
 The southwestern willow flycatcher was listed as "endangered" by the USFWS in 
1995, following candidacy in 1989 and proposed listing in 1994. Critical habitat was 
originally established in 1997 but set aside in 2001. The USFWS proposed critical 
habitat again in October 2004, and final critical habitat was designated in October 2005. 
The bird is also listed as Wildlife of Special Concern by the AGFD. 
 
 The SWWF is a migratory bird that summers in southern California, southern 
Nevada, southern Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, southwestern Colorado, 
and northwestern Mexico. Suitable breeding habitat is typically comprised of stands of 
dense cottonwood, willow, and tamarisk in riparian areas, with open water usually 
present. 
 
 Habitat for SWWF in the project vicinity is expected to be limited to dense 
riparian stands along the San Pedro River. The nearest SWWF critical habitat to the 
project area is along the San Pedro River, at the southwestern end of both Copper 
Creek and Bunker Hill Roads. Although impacts to critical habitat from the project are 
not anticipated, improvements to the access roads have the potential to affect this 
species. As such, survey for SWWF, based on protocols adopted by the USFWS in May 
1997 (revised May 2000), may be recommended. The survey protocols fulfill the primary 
objectives of documenting the presence or absence of SWWF and determining their 
status (territorial vs. migrant). The USFWS recommends five surveys per year for 
project-related surveys, with the first survey to be conducted between May 15 and May 
31, the second between June 1 and June 21, and the third, fourth, and fifth between 



Redhawk Copper, Inc. - Copper Creek PEA 25,000 TPD Mill Page 197  

 
 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July  2013 

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

June 22 and July 17. Surveys conducted in different survey periods, and multiple 
surveys within the third survey period, must be at least five days apart. 
 
 Survey should be completed prior to any impacts in the vicinity of the San Pedro 
River. From previous permitting efforts in the surrounding area, WestLand understands 
that SWWF nesting has occurred along this general reach of the river. As such, USFWS 
may not require survey, and will initiate Section 7 consultation absent project-specific 
surveys. 
 
Lesser Long-Nosed Bat 
 
 The LLNB was proposed for listing as "endangered" by the USFWS in 1987 (52 
FR 25171), with the final ruling coming in 1988 (53 FR 38456), both without critical 
habitat. It is also an AGFD Wildlife Species of Special Concern. 
 
 The project area is within the late summer range of this species, and some 
forage species (i.e. agave) were observed during the site visit. In addition, potential 
roost sites are available in the variety of shafts and adits within the area.   
 
 No survey protocol for LLNB exists. In general, potential roost sites can be 
inspected for individuals and to identify guano (bat droppings), which is indicative of 
nectar-feeding versus insect bats. A cursory evaluation of onsite mining features 
(representing potential LLNB roosting habitat) identified no guano from nectivorous 
bats, though a more thorough evaluation will be completed well in advance of activities 
which could affect the features. 
 
Chiricahua Leopard Frog 
 
 The Chiricahua leopard frog is designated as a threatened species throughout its 
range by the USFWS, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended 
(67 FR40790, June 13, 2002). Critical habitat was designated in March 2012 and 
includes portions of the Galiuro Mountains (Recovery Unit 4) outside of the project area. 
According to the listing summary, this species is absent from more than 75 percent of its 
known historical sites and former range. Major threats to the population status of this 
species include predation by introduced bullfrogs, crayfish, and predatory fish, chytrid 
fungus infection, habitat fragmentation, water pollution, major water manipulations, and 
intensive grazing. 
 
 The Chiricahua leopard frog is considered an aquatic habitat generalist. The 
primary vegetation types where this species is found include oak, mixed oak, and pine 
woodlands, but they may also be found in chaparral, grassland, and even desert. This 
species breeds in a variety of conditions that include natural and manmade aquatic 
systems. Rock-bound pools, river-overflow pools, oxbows, permanent springs, 
permanent pools in intermittent streams, and beaver ponds are the natural aquatic 
habitats where the Chiricahua leopard frog occurs. Potentially suitable man-made

structures include earthen stock tanks, livestock drinkers, irrigation sloughs, wells, mine 
adits, abandoned swimming pools, and ornamental backyard ponds. This species is 
present in central and eastern Arizona at an elevation range of 3,500 to 8,000 ft and at 
the Arizona-Mexico border at 1,200 to 4,000 ft. 
 
 The draft Recovery Plan indicates that populations of this species were identified 
in a number of stock tanks within the Galiuro Mountains in the 1990's. The most recent 
studies indicate that most of these populations have disappeared, potentially due to 
drought conditions. The remaining population known in the Galiuros is within a perennial 
stream which may have some higher resistance to drought than the stock tanks. 
 
 Aquatic habitats within the project area will be evaluated for the potential to 
support this species. 
 
Sonoran Desert Tortoise 
 
 The desert tortoise in the United States is split into two populations: the Mojave 
desert tortoise (north and west of the Colorado River) and the Sonoran desert tortoise 
(limited in the United States to Arizona south and east of the Colorado River). Murphy et 
al. (2011) have proposed the species name Gopherus morafkai for the Sonoran 
population. The USFWS list of Special-status Species for Pinal County identifies the 
Sonoran desert tortoise as G. agassizii, but both its General Species Information 
(USFWS 2012a) and its profile page (USFWS 2012b) refer to the Sonoran desert 
tortoise as G. morafkai. 
 
 The Mojave desert tortoise was listed as threatened in 1990 (USFWS 1990a). 
The Sonoran desert tortoise is currently a candidate for listing. It was petitioned for 
listing as a Distinct Population Segment with critical habitat on October 9, 2008 
(WildEarth Guardians and Western Watersheds Project 2008). On August 28, 2009, the 
USFWS published its 90-day finding announcing that they were initiating a status review 
for the Sonoran desert tortoise (USFWS 2009). On December 14, 2010, the USFWS 
announced that the listing of the Sonoran desert tortoise was warranted but precluded 
by higher priority listing actions (USFWS 2010). The May 10, 2011, WildEarth 
Guardians v. Salazar court settlement requires the USFWS to submit a Proposed Rule 
or a not-warranted finding to the Federal Register for the Sonoran desert tortoise no 
later than the end of FY 2015 (September 30, 2015). The Sonoran desert tortoise is 
also designated Arizona State Wildlife of Special Concern (AGFD 1996), Forest Service 
Sensitive (USDA, FS Region 3 2007), and BLM sensitive (USDI, BLM 2010). It is not 
afforded protection under the ESA, but is considered in this evaluation due to the 
potential for up listing. 
 
 The USFWS identified a wide variety of threats to the Sonoran desert tortoise in 
its finding that listing is warranted, including habitat modification and destruction, illegal 
collection, domestic dog and human depredation, vehicle strikes, and inadequate 
regulatory mechanisms (USFWS 2010).

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

 
 The Copper Creek project area is within the Sonoran desert tortoise's known 
habitat and elevation range. BLM mapping depicts Sonoran desert tortoise habitat 
covering essentially the entire area of the access road from the San Pedro River, but 
only within the extreme western fringe of the mine site itself. Desert tortoises are known 
to occur along the lower elevations of the Galiuro Mountains approximately 6 miles 
southeast of the project area (Hart et al. 1992, Woodman et al. 1999). Arizona upland 
vegetation with rocky slopes, where desert tortoises are typically found, is present within 
the project area, mainly along the proposed haul road at the lower elevations of the 
western end. Areas near the proposed mine site are dominated by semidesert 
grassland, grading into interior chaparral, and are less likely to be occupied by desert 
tortoises. 
 
 An analysis for the potential occurrence of Sonoran desert tortoise will be 
conducted prior to initiation of mine development activities. 
 
National Historic Preservation Act Compliance 
 
 As with the ESA, federal permitting authorities are required to evaluate the 
potential for any proposed project to adversely impact properties listed, or eligible for 
listing, on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Typically, a Class III 
(pedestrian) cultural resources survey is completed within the proposed project area to 
identify any register-eligible properties. If a proposed project may adversely affect such 
a property, under Section 106 of the NHPA, the lead federal agency must consult with 
the State Historic Preservation Officer and selected Native American tribes. Mitigation 
for most impacts is typically accomplished through the development and implementation 
of a Historic Properties Treatment Plan, which must be reviewed and approved by all 
consulting entities. 
 
 A large portion of the project area has been surveyed for cultural resources. A 
number of the historic mining features within the project area have been identified by 
archaeological consultants as eligible for listing, either separately or as a single site. 
Any adverse effects to these features would likely require consultation and, likely, 
mitigation. 
 
Aquifer Protection Permit 
 
 In general, an Aquifer Protect Permit (APP) will be required for any activities or 
facilities that may result in a discharge of a contaminant to an aquifer, including tailings 
and waste rock facilities, and non-stormwater impoundments. A review of the APP 
permitting materials for AMT's project indicates that AMT was expecting to encounter 
some acid-generating waste rock that would need to be temporarily stockpiled on the 
surface. They had agreed to routinely sample, segregate and special-handle this 
material, to stockpile it on a constructed foundation, and then return it to the excavation

site prior to 5 elapsed years. In addition, runoff diversion ditches associated with waste 
rock stockpiles were required to be lined. 
 
 The APP process can be time and labor intensive, and for mining projects 
generally requires extensive hydrologic characterization, engineering (i.e. BADCT 
demonstration), geochemical characterization, and reclamation design. Completion of 
the APP process can take up to two years, or more. 
 
ASLD Right-of-Way Access 
 
 In 2011, Redhawk acquired right-of-way access across lands managed by the 
Arizona State Land Department (ASLD) in support of the development of the exploration 
decline near a minor tributary of Saloon Gulch. The right-of-way includes the majority of 
Copper Creek Road as well as the construction of a new all-weather access road that 
avoids Copper Creek itself. 
 
 For the larger mine, it is assumed that the access roads will need to be upgraded 
beyond what is considered in the current ASLD right-of-way in order to accommodate 
the anticipated increase in the volume and type of traffic required for the mining effort. In 
that case, a revision to the right-of-way will be required through coordination with ASLD. 
As part of the right-of-way application process, the following will need to be conducted: 
 

▪ Native plant inventory - In essence, ASLD requires a "stumpage fee" for 
impacts to native vegetation through ASLD lands. This task includes a 
complete inventory of all native woody and succulent species that will be 
impacted by the proposed project. The state uses this inventory to calculate 
the amount of the stumpage fee.  

 
▪ Cultural resources survey - A full pedestrian (Class III) cultural resources 

survey is required in those areas that will be impacted on state lands (see 
below). 

 
 The results of the native plant inventory and the cultural resources survey are 
submitted to ASLD for processing along with the applicable Use or Right-of-Way permit 
application. Although the inventory and survey are relatively straightforward efforts, the 
processing time can be significant, as long as a year. If cultural resources will be 
adversely affected by the proposed project the process will likely take longer. 
 
State Reclamation Plan 
 
 The State of Arizona requires that mining projects greater than five (5) 
contiguous acres on private lands submit a reclamation plan to the State Mine 
Inspectors Office. This plan must outline planned reclamation activities and costs. The 
reclamation requirements under this program are different than those for the APP 
program, described above.

Dam Safety Permit 
 
 The Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) has jurisdiction over non-
federal dams in Arizona over 25 ft in height or capable of storing more than 50 acre-ft of 
water, including appurtenances. Smaller dams, or those within certain defined 
classifications, are exempt. For new dams, or those requiring alteration or repair, 
application to and approval from the Dam Safety Section of ADWR is required. 
Applicants are encouraged to meet with ADWR staff prior to application submittal. 
 
 Tailings dams are specifically exempt from permitting under this program. It is 
assumed for the purpose of this analysis that there will be no other jurisdictional dams 
as part of this project.  
 
Storm Water Permit (MSGP) 
 
 Under the Arizona Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (AZPDES) Multi-
Sector General Permit (MSGP-2010) Storm water program administered by the Arizona 
Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ), mine facilities (including associated pre-
mining exploration) are required to obtain coverage for discharges of storm water from 
their operations. This program requires a project proponent to prepare a storm water 
pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), submit a notice of intent (NOI) to discharge storm 
water, install appropriate best management practices (BMPs), and conduct regular 
inspections and of the site and analytical monitoring during construction and operations, 
in accordance with the SWPPP. 
 
 The Copper Creek operations are currently covered under the MSGP for the 
historic mining operations within the project area. 
 
Individual AZPDES Permit 
 
 Discharges of certain industrial process waters are covered by individual permits 
under the AZPDES program. Anticipated process water discharges from a mine site 
include water treatment plant discharges, wastewater from mill operations, and seepage 
from tailings impoundments.   
 
 An issued AZPDES permit includes effluent limitations, usually consisting of both 
numeric and narrative standards. The numeric limitations typically restrict quantities, 
rates, and concentrations of pollutants that may be present in the discharge, and can be 
either technology- or water quality-based. Technology-based standards require usage 
of available pollution control technology, while water quality-based standards protect 
ambient water quality by requiring the discharger to achieve the applicable numeric 
standard (as mentioned above). If both technology- and water quality-based standards 
exist for a particular constituent, the more restrictive standard applies.

 It is not anticipated that the proposed project will not require coverage under an 
individual AZPDES permit. 
 
Permitting Considerations 
 
 Critical path items related to environmental permitting for the project are: 
 

▪ BLM Approvals (including NEPA, ESA, and NHPA compliance), 
▪ Clean Air Act permitting 
▪ CWA Section 404 permit (including NEPA, ESA, and NHPA compliance), and 
▪ Aquifer Protection Permit 

 
 In general, other approvals are readily acquired within the critical path. A 
summary of environmental permitting requirements is provided in the table below.

21.1.1 Underground Mine Capital Estimates 
 
 The mine capital required to develop and sustain a 25,000 t/d Post-Pillar Cut & 
Fill mining operation for extracting  Copper Creek materials from the Childs, Mammoth, 
Keel, and American Eagle deposits has been estimated to a plus or minus (+/-) 35 
percent accuracy. These costs are presented in first quarter 2013 U.S. dollars. 
 
 The costs are based on unit prices applied to estimated development quantities, 
recent equipment quotes from mining equipment manufactures, and labor cost build-ups 
for the mine site location, similar installations, and in-house information on labor 
productivities for large-tonnage underground room and pillar operations. 
 
 The following Table 21.1 provides a summary breakdown of the mining capital 
required to develop and sustain a 25,000 ton per day, fully integrated mining and

 The estimated annual mine capital expenditures, without contingency, are shown 
in the following Table 21.2. 
 
 

 
21.1.2 Hydraulic Backfill Cost Estimate 
 

Hydraulic backfill is the preferred method for backfill at the Copper Creek Mine in 
this Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA). Hydraulic backfill is slurry typically 
consisting of coarse tailings particles and a binder (such as cement). The solid content 
of typical hydraulic backfill ranges from 65 to 72 weight percent solids. Binder is added 
to the slurry in proportion to the weight of solids in the slurry. Hydraulic backfill will 
generally require more binder content to achieve the same backfill strength as a typical 
paste backfill. It is often observed that the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) 
requirement for stopes may vary depending on the mining method and the location of 
the stopes. 
 

Scoping level capital and operating cost estimates, with an intended overall level of 
accuracy of ±40 percent, have been established for sourcing, loading, hauling and 
sizing the required backfill make-up, and operating an aggregate/sand plant and

Hydraulic Backfill Plant. The following assumptions and basis were used to generate the 
cost estimate: 
 

▪ All costs are in first quarter 2013 US dollars; 
 

▪ A base date of January 2013; 
 

▪ Current costs associated with items such as contractor and installation labor 
and consumable items e.g. power and cement, etc., are based on Golder's 
database for similar projects; 

 
▪ Costs for the majority of the process equipment were established using actual 

historical pricing for similar equipment, as close in capacity as possible to the 
ones considered for the Project.   

 
▪ All equipment costs are based on new purchased equipment; 

 
▪ The TSF thickener is not included in the scope of the backfill plant; 

 
▪ Since the in situ backfill strength requirement is unknown at the time of the 

study, backfill cement consumption rate for the cemented hydraulic backfill 
was estimated based on Golder's experience in other mine backfill 
applications. 

 
▪ Binder (NPC) is available for delivery to the Copper Creek mine site at 

$100/ton delivered. 
 

▪ The labor costs for all capital activities is predicated around the work being 
performed by qualified contactors; all labor rates are presented in 2013 
dollars and estimated to be $80 per hour; 

 
▪ The breakdown of plant direct costs is factored estimates based on Golder's 

database of previous projects; and 
 

▪ Indirect costs were not included in the capital cost estimates. 
 

Based on the above criteria and assumptions, the estimated capital and 
operating cost estimates for providing make-up backfill sand, and operating the 
Aggregate and the Hydraulic Backfill Plants are summarized in Tables 21.3 and 21.4 
below. The capital of the aggregate/sand plant is assumed to be leased and expensed 
as an operating cost. The spare capacity of the aggregate plant may be used to 
produce crushed stone for on-site general purpose material such as concrete, ballast, 
and road building

21.1.3 Discussion 
 

Binder represents the largest portion of the backfill plant operating cost, and will 
be subjected to extensive testing of various binder combinations, ratios, and admixtures 
to optimize the cost per unit strength benefit. Typically binder percentages range from 4 
to 12 percent of the slurry solids by weight and can represent 80 to 90 percent of the 
cost of backfill 
 
21.2 Underground Mine and G&A Operating Estimates 
 
 Mine operating costs have been estimated, based on producing 25,000 t/d, using 
a post-pillar cut and fill mining method, from four separate deposits, simultaneously. The 
estimate was based on prevailing wage rates in the U.S copper mining industry, and 
underground equipment operating costs in average ground conditions. An electric 
power cost of US$ 0.077/kWh was used for estimating power costs. All costs are in first 
quarter 2013 US dollars. A summary of this estimate for full production years 4 through 
18 is provided in the following Table 21.5.

 Table 21.6 provides a summary of the estimated annual mine operating costs. 
Tables 21.7 and 21.8 provide a breakdown of the operating labor cost build-up and a 
summary of the full production mine average unit operating cost estimate. Table 21.9 
lists the estimated full production G&A operating costs. 
 
 A reduction of 20 percent in tonnage, and a corresponding increase in operating 
costs, was included for the learning curve in the first year of production. In addition, the 
first three production years reflect the higher operating cost of mining the upper breccia 
material. The production ramp-up is expected to be very steep, since the preproduction 
development work allows immediate access to the mineralized material. From this initial 
access, mining can begin with multiple headings.

process plant. The process piping cost was estimated using a fifteen percent (15%) 
factor of purchased equipment costs. The factor was selected based on the size of the 
plant, as well as the distribution of piping within the plant area.  
 

▪ Electrical Distribution and Instrumentation  
 

Electrical and Instrumentation costs include transformation and service, wiring, 
cable tray, lighting and grounding within the process plant. The electrical and 
instrumentation cost was estimated using twenty-five percent (25%) and fifteen percent 
(15%) factors, respectively, of purchased equipment costs. The factors were selected 
based on preliminary equipment power requirements and latest National Electric Code 
(NEC) standards.  

 
▪ Site Development 

 
 Site development costs include excavations, backfills, grading, roads, and 
fencing. The construction site development cost was estimated using a twenty percent 
(20%) factor of the purchased plant equipment cost. The factor was selected based on 
a rough civil computer model to calculate approximate bulk excavations and backfills 
based on the current plant layout of the proposed project site. The Project will require 
development at the following major locations: 
 

- New access roads  
- Process plant area 
- Crushing and conveying areas 

 
▪ Buildings 

 
 Building costs include materials, labor, and other miscellaneous costs associated 
with erecting covered structures within the project site. The building costs were 
estimated using a twenty-five percent (25%) factor of the purchased plant equipment 
cost. The factor was selected to reflect the projected costs of the buildings based on 
building type and square footage. The Project will require the following buildings: 
 

- Mill Building 
- Flotation Building 
- Cu Concentrate Load Out Building

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

▪ Roads 
 
 Road costs include materials, labor and other miscellaneous costs associated 
with constructing new roads and upgrading existing ones. Historically, costs for roads 
have typically been approximately $2.4M USD per mile. These observed costs have 
been utilized in this estimate for the 10.6 miles of paved roads to the project site. 
 

▪ Overhead Transmission Line 
 
 The costs for supplying power to the Project includes a utility transmission line 
including cables, poles, conductors and insulators, labor and other miscellaneous costs 
associated with erecting the utility transmission line to site and costs for on-site power 
distribution that includes transformers, switchgear, labor and other miscellaneous costs. 
The cost was estimated using a thirty percent (30%) factor of purchased plant 
equipment cost. The factor was selected to reflect a cost allowance for a conceptual 
plan to have power supplied to the Copper Creek Mine main substation via a 115 kV 
transmission line from Arizona Public Service (APS) substation, at San Manuel, and 
distribute power on site via transformers and switchgear to all project facilities with 
overhead and/or underground power lines. The Project will require the following main 
electrical power supply and distribution items: 
 

- Utility Transmission Line 
 

- Main Transformer(s) stepping down utility transmission line voltage to on-site 
distribution line voltage. 

 
- Main switchgear for distributing power on site 

 
- On-site power lines, overhead and/or underground 

 
- Transformation and switchgear as needed for service at each respective 

facility of the project 
 

- Backup power generators 
 

▪ Utilities and Outside Lines 
 
 Utilities and outside lines costs include the supply of fresh water, reclaim water, 
fire protection, air, fuel, sanitary systems, and other miscellaneous service items within 
the project site. The site development cost was estimated using a fifteen percent (15%) 
factor of the purchased plant equipment cost. The factor was selected to reflect the 
projected costs of the pipelines for fresh and reclaim water transmission, with 
consideration of additional costs for services listed above.

Indirect Costs 
 
 Certain indirect costs exhibited in this estimate include, but are not limited to, 
labor, equipment and materials for the detailed activities set forth below: 
 

▪ EPCM was estimated using a twenty percent (20%) factor of the purchased 
equipment costs. The factor and includes:  

 
- Prefeasibility Engineering 
- Bankable Feasibility Engineering 
- Detailed Engineering 
- Procurement 
- Construction Management 
- Training 

 
▪ Construction Indirect Costs were estimated using a ten percent (10%) 

factor of the total direct costs and includes:  
 

- Construction Supervision 
- Equipment Rental 
- Field Office Expenses 
- Mobilization/Demobilization 
- Consumables 

 
▪ Owner's Costs were estimated using a ten percent (10%) factor of the total 

direct costs. These costs account for all expenditures made by the Owner 
during the project, including, but not limited to, management, office expenses, 
travel, etc. This number may need to be increased if the owner wants to 
include working capital in this estimate.  

 
▪ Spare Parts costs were estimated using a five percent (5%) factor of the 

installed plant equipment cost.  
 

▪ Initial Fill & Reagents costs were estimated using a one and half percent 
(1.5%) factor of the installed plant equipment costs.  

 
▪ Equipment Insurance and Freight costs were estimated using an eight 

percent (8%) factor of the installed plant equipment costs. 
 
Contingency and Accuracy 
  

The SGS crushing and process plant portion of the cost estimate includes a 
thirty-five percent (35%) contingency for project unknowns and identified 
risks. Contingency is a necessary part of the cost estimate and is based on the fact less 
than five percent (< 5%) of the engineering is completed to date. SGS believes the

 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July  2013 

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13  

estimated contingency amount will be spent during the life of the project for identified 
risks and unknown items.   
 
            While SGS has not performed a statistical analysis of the crushing plant and 
process plant accuracy of the capital cost estimate, SGS has a high confidence, based 
on previous experience with similar projects, that the accuracy of the process portion of 
the PEA capital cost estimate will end up between minus ten percent and plus thirty-five 
percent (-10 / +35%) of the SGS capital cost estimate.  
 
Exclusions 
  
 SGS has excluded the following cost items from the process plant estimate and 
they are included elsewhere: 
 

▪ Geotechnical 
▪ Mining  
▪ Reclamation and Closure 
▪ Metallurgical Testing  
▪ Property Acquisition 
▪ Permitting 
▪ Environmental  
▪ Permits, Royalties and Licenses 
▪ Taxes, Duty and Import Fees; IVA 
▪ Local Sales & Import Taxes 
▪ Hazardous Waste Removal  
▪ Other Consultants 
 

Risk Sensitivity 
  
 Due to minimal engineering and the utilization of a factored cost estimate, a basic 
risk sensitivity analysis was performed to determine a potential range of total capital 
cost. Although the majority of equipment costs were provided based on previous quotes 
and historical data for similar equipment, there remains a risk that a more detailed 
evaluation would result in a considerable variation in costs. SGS is confident that the 
equipment costs provided for this estimate are within the range of plus or minus twenty 
percent (+/- 20%). Performing the risk sensitivity with this range for the equipment costs 
results in a total capital cost range of 255M USD to 351M USD. This result is based on 
the assumption that all other assumptions remain valid and all factors currently selected 
remain unchanged.

21.4 Tailings Storage Facility Capital Costs 
 
 Table 21.20 includes an estimate of capital costs for the proposed TSF. 
Components considered in the cost estimate include: 
 

▪ Site preparation and topsoil salvage; 
▪ TSF earthwork; 
▪ Seepage collection pond construction; 
▪ Underdrain system construction; 
▪ Water Reclaim Works 

 
 Earthworks costs assume that the embankment will be constructed by the 
downstream raise method using locally borrowed fill. Unit rates are based on similar 
activities at mining projects in the southwest US. A cost of $4.00/cubic yard (cy) is 
assumed for borrowing and placing local alluvial materials. A cost of $14.00/cy is 
assumed for materials that must be crushed and/or screened (liner bedding fill, drainage 
fill, and transitional fill materials).

 To date, base metal tailings impoundments in Arizona have been permitted 
without geomembrane liners. The Copper Creek TSF is assumed to be un-lined. 
Construction costs include an allowance for a geomembrane liner to be placed on the 
upstream face of the embankment for control of the phreatic surface within the tailings 
dam. The seepage collection pond is assumed to meet Arizona Department of 
Environmental Quality (ADEQ) prescriptive design criteria for a process solution pond. 
Liner material and installation costs are assumed to be $0.80 and $0.60 per square foot 
for 80 and 60 mil geomembranes, respectively, based on typical installations. 
 
 Construction is assumed to occur in 5 campaigns occurring in Years minus 1, 1, 
2, 4, and 8. Cost accuracy is on the order of plus or minus 40 percent.

 Water reclaim system costs are based on recent vendor quotes for barge and 
pump systems of similar size. 
 
 Capital TSF costs do not include engineering, procurement and construction 
management (EPCM) costs. It is assumed that EPCM costs will be applied globally to 
the overall project cost estimate. 
 
21.5 Diversion Tunnel Costs 
 
 Diversion tunnel costs are based on the assumption that a tunnel boring machine 
(TBM) will be used. Budgetary quotes for TBM equipment mobilization and set-up, 
tunneling and tunnel lining were provided by Frontier Kemper. Costs for inlet and outlet 
works are based on the requirements for typical, reinforced concrete headwall and wing 
wall structures and were developed with construction industry cost data (RS Means, 
Heavy Construction Cost Data, 26th Edition).   
 
 Table 21.21 contains the diversion tunnel cost estimate. EPCM costs are not 
included. 
   
 Tunnel construction will not be required at project startup. It is estimated that 
subsidence crack propagation will not reach Copper Creek for approximately 6 years.

21.6 Reclamation and Closure 
 
 A closure and reclamation cost estimate for the TSF is included in Table 21.22. 
Costs assume a 5-year pre-closure monitoring period while the tailings in the interior of 
the TSF consolidate and surface traffic ability conditions improve. During this period, it 
is assumed that seepage will be circulated from the seepage collection pond to the TSF 
surface to enhance evaporation. The pre-closure costs include allowances for local 
monitoring well sampling and testing, and periodic maintenance of erosion controls by 
an earthworks contractor.     
 
 Reclamation is assumed to involve the placement of 24 inches of soil cover 
recovered from topsoil stockpiles. Due to potentially difficult conditions on the TSF 
surface, a cost of $5.00/cy is assumed for cover placement. The TSF reclamation cover 
and the downstream embankment slope will be reseeded. A permanent spillway will be 
required. Disposal operations can be modified during the final years of operation to 
push the free water pond to the vicinity of the designated spillway area.

 At a copper price of US$ 2.37 per pound a NPV of zero is produced at a zero 
percent discount rate (break even copper price). With a discount rate of 7.5 percent, a 
NPV of zero is produced at a copper price of US$ 2.73 per pound. 
 
 Sensitivity analysis indicating the effects of varying the capital and operating 
costs, recoveries, and metal prices are shown in Figures 22.1 and 22.2. Conventional 
financial criteria including the internal rate of return (IRR) and the net present value 
(NPV) at various discount rates are also indicated. As shown in Figures 22.1 and 22.2, 
the project is most sensitive to copper price and operating costs.

23.0   ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
 The Copper Creek Property lies within the porphyry copper metallogenic 
province of the southwestern United States. There are several large adjacent properties 
that have been or still are major producers of copper. The San Manuel/Kalamazoo 
deposit lies within 15 miles of the Copper Creek Property and the Ray Mine lies 
approximately 50 miles north of the property. San Manuel was a major underground 
copper mine until its closure, with production in excess of 50,000 short tons per day. 
ASARCO Ray is a large open pit copper mine that is still in operation. 
 
 Within the Copper Creek Property, there has been historic copper production as 
discussed in Section 6. Mining in the Childs-Aldwinkle breccia was as recently as 1965 
with the majority of mining done between 1933 and 1938. This mining occurred in the 
central and southern fingers of the breccia pipe. The resource estimate for the Childs-
Aldwinkle presented in this report is in the north finger and the breccia body below the 
three fingers. There is no evidence of historic mining in the area of the resource 
estimate. Mining in the Old Reliable occurred in 1972 when the upper portion of it was 
rubblized with one major blast and the broken rock was leached for copper. The 
leaching operation continued through 1981 with about 12 million pounds of copper 
recovered. Some of the post leaching drilling shows remaining copper within the 
rubblized zone.   
 
 Redhawk is currently exploring an area north of Copper Creek which is referred 
to as Copper Creek North. This area shows the potential for copper mineralization.

25.0   INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

Conceptual process flowsheets and design have been developed for this study. 
The processing plant is capable of achieving the design criteria of 25,000 tons per day 
with an overall availability factor of 92.5 percent and the process will yield metal 
recoveries as stated in the report.  

 
The exploration to date has identified both breccia hosted and porphyry style 

hosted copper, molybdenum and precious metals mineralization in significant enough 
quantities to support an underground mining scenario. The mineralization is open in 
many directions and there are indications though the mapping of the trace elements, 
those other significant and undiscovered mineralized bodies exist within the Copper 
Creek property. As well, most of the mapped breccia deposits that are exposed at 
surface have not been tested with drill holes for the grade of the mineralization. The 
discovery of additional, high grade mineralization will help the overall project economics 
and thus Redhawk should continue its exploration program to investigate the 
opportunities for additional mineralized bodies.

26.0   RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

The following recommendations are provided by discipline and have not been 
assigned levels of importance. 

  26.1 Geotechnical Investigation 
 
 A geotechnical investigation will be required in the plant site, the diversion tunnel 
inlet and outlet areas, and at the proposed TSF site. The focus of the geotechnical 
investigation will be to develop an understanding of foundation conditions, identify and 
characterize construction materials, support stability analyses, and meet ADEQ 
requirements for general site characterization. A program involving test pit excavation 
and drilling will be required. Costs for a geotechnical site investigation to support 
detailed engineering and ADEQ permitting will be on the order of $250,000 to $300,000 
with testing and subcontractor costs included. Preliminary sites investigation costs for 
prefeasibility level assessment will be under $100,000. 
 
26.2 Tailings Characterization Studies   
 
 A bulk sample of process tailings will be required to support tailings 
characterization studies. The sample should be passed through a cyclone to produce 
underflow and overflow samples. Underflow testing should include compressive 
strength testing of cement amended samples to determine binder addition requirements 
and costs for hydraulic mine backfill. Tailings overflow and whole tailings should be 
subjected to geotechnical testing to evaluate consolidation characteristics and post 
deposition density. Dewatering tests will be required. Subsamples of all tailings products 
should also be subject to geochemical characterization testing as prescribed by ADEQ. 
This program will require on the order of 300 kg of tailings solids in order to produce 
multiple underflow samples for strength testing. Testing program costs, exclusive of the 
metallurgical testing component (milling, flotation etc), will be on the order of $150,000. 
 
26.2.1 Hydraulic Backfill 
 
 In order to further advance the Project, Paste Engineering and Design Group 
(PED) presents the following key recommendations: 
 

▪ Investigate the unconfined compressive strength  (UCS) strength requirement 
for backfill; 

 
▪ Perform cyclone testwork with a vendor to determine the ideal cyclone size 

for the process, and obtain cyclone underflow samples in order to perform 
UCS testwork;

 Document No. Q400-05-028 25 July  2013 

SGS FORM No. A263a-2/14/13   

▪ Complete a full laboratory testing program to assess the dewatering potential, 
rheological and strength properties of the Copper Creek mill tailings for use 
as cemented underground hydraulic backfill; 

 
▪ Investigate commercial sources of binder (fly ash, lime kiln dust or other 

pozzolans) in the area and evaluate the total cost implications of using partial 
binder alternatives in place of normal Portland cement; and 

 
Commence pre-feasibility engineering following completion of the above items to 

determine a greater accuracy cost estimates and process design. 
 
26.3 Alternative Dam Construction Methods 
 
 The PEA level cost estimate assumes TSF embankment construction by the 
downstream raise method. The approach requires the largest amount of fill material 
relative to other construction methods. Downstream construction will be feasible 
regardless of the properties of the tailings placed inside the TSF. Rejects from the 
backfill plant will consist of tailings slimes that could have poor permeability and 
consolidation characteristics. Poorly consolidated, soft and saturated tailings will not 
adversely impact TSF stability if the downstream construction method is used, however, 
utilization of upstream and centerline raise construction techniques, which could reduce 
embankment fill requirements, is contingent upon the development of well drained and 
consolidated foundation conditions to support raises.     
     
 A portion of the testing described in Section 26.2 will include consolidation, 
settling, permeability, and shear strength testing of backfill plant rejects and whole 
tailings. The results of these tests should be used in 1-dimensional consolidation 
modeling to evaluate future conditions on the TSF beach area, and the potential for the 
use of alternative dam construction practices to reduce fill quantities and construction 
costs. Consolidation modeling costs will be on the order of $30,000. 
 
26.4 Recommendations for Water Supply Development 
 
 For ongoing investigation of the project water supply, drilling and testing of at 
least one test well is recommended. The well should be located at least three miles east 
of the active channel of the San Pedro River near the main access road.  
 
 A 10-inch well would be physically capable of producing 600 gpm at the 
estimated depth to groundwater. Upon completion of the well, a limited 10 hour aquifer 
test would be performed and the results evaluated. Estimated costs for installation and 
short term testing of the 10- inch test well are contained in Table 20.1. 
 
 If data from the 10 hour test are satisfactory then an extended aquifer test should 
be performed. The purpose of the long term, 15 day test would be to evaluate

drawdown associated with long term pumping, which is currently unknown. Costs for 
long term testing, oversight and evaluation of test data are estimated to be US$ 63,000. 
 
 Given a satisfactory long term test, installation of additional 10-inch production 
wells could be warranted at locations no closer than one quarter mile from the initial 10-
inch test well. The combination of the five wells would meet the requirements of the 
project. The approximate costs for a 10 -inch production well are included in Table 26.1.

 Development of a water supply sufficient for project uses will be required. This 
process may be complicated by proximity of identified production well sites to the San 
Pedro River, which is a protected watershed. Based on local geologic and 
hydrogeological conditions, a lower, basin-fill confined aquifer is expected to occur at 
the proposed production well site which represents the targeted water 
source. Groundwater withdrawal from the confined aquifer is expected to enable

Redhawk to withdraw water without surface water impacts to the San Pedro River or 
watershed. Test well installation and pump testing will be required to demonstrate that 
surface water resources in the watershed will not be impacted by groundwater 
withdrawals from the lower basin-fill confined aquifer system. 
 
26.5 Additional Metallurgical Testwork  
 
 SGS reviewed the metallurgical testing on the Redhawk project and 
recommended additional testing for the pre-feasibility study to demonstrate recovery of 
byproducts and optimize the design of the processing plant. A review of the 
metallurgical testing should be conducted when all of the results are available. Any 
additional testing necessary can be identified at that time. Additional reviews of the 
testing requirements should be conducted as the project advances. Prefeasibility level 
testing would include sample preparation, comminution, flotation, and support 
investigations at an approximate total cost of $380,000. 
 
26.6 Resource Expansion 
 
 IMC recommends that in addition to the work to advance the project to a Pre-
Feasibility level, Redhawk continues to expand the resource base at Copper Creek. The 
distributions of many of the trace elements have been studied by Redhawk as part of its 
work to define the mineralizing events at Copper Creek. The Redhawk geologists have 
developed a model of the trace element distribution in relationship to the Keel- 
American Eagle copper-moly porphyry. Applying this model to other areas on the 
Copper Creek claim block, the Redhawk geologists see other potential areas where 
large porphyry bodies could exist. This work needs to continue and be drill tested. 
Redhawk should further define the program required and develop a budget for it. 
 
26.7 Tailings Storage Facility 
 
26.7.1 Waste Rock TSF Embankment Fill 
 

There is potential to mine the upper portion of the Old Reliable by open pit 
methods. A trade off study evaluating and optimizing this potential is recommended. 
The use of mine waste rock for TSF embankment fill could potentially reduce fill costs 
and decrease disturbance area associated with fill borrowing and waste rock disposal.   

 
26.7.2 TSF Construction Methods 
 

As noted above, the evaluation of future tailings properties could demonstrate the 
feasibility of alternative construction methods for TSF embankment raises. Upstream or

1.0 INTRODUCTION 

Mr. Joe Sandberg and Mr. Joe Fernandez of Red Hawk Resources, Incorporated (RRI), 

requested Call & Nicholas, Inc. (CNI) to provide geomechanical parameters for open-pit, block 

caving, and post-pillar cut and fill mining of the American Eagle, Keel, Mammoth, and Childs 

deposits.  This report provides the results of the post-pillar cut and fill (PPCF) mining method.  

Post-pillar cut and fill mining method is similar to a room and pillar method except after 

the first lift is completed the room is filled with a dense engineered backfill such as run of mine 

waste or paste tailings.  Successive lifts are opened on top of the original footprint utilizing the 

same pillar locations and geometries.  The pillars are designed so that as the fifth lift is opened 

the pillar confined by the backfill will yield yet the working level will remain stable.  The mining 

method is from the bottom up and mining heights in excess of 500 feet are possible.  The mining 

height is limited initially to minimize pillar widths required.   

Data used for these analyses included a drill hole database, geology and grade 

MineSight® 3-D block model, oriented core data collected by RRI staff, cell mapping data 

collected by CNI staff, and laboratory strength testing data collected at CNI's laboratory.

2.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Call & Nicholas, Inc. (CNI) has evaluated the American Eagle, Keel, Mammoth and 

Childs deposits as potential post-pillar cut and fill operations (PPCF).  The American Eagle and 

Keel deposits have similar RQD distributions and intact strength properties which are greater 

than those of the Mammoth and Childs. 

Based on surface geologic structures, a room width of 20 feet is recommended using 4-

foot long split set bolts on 3 to 4 foot centers. As additional joint set data from within the 

deposits are gathered,  there is the potential for the American Eagle and Keel to be widened to a 

25 ft room width, while in the Mammoth and Childs room widths may need to be reduced. 

The recommended pillar widths for the American Eagle and Keel are 20 by 20 feet, and 

in the Mammoth and Childs 25 by 25 feet.  These pillar widths are based on mining 15-foot high 

lifts for five (5) lifts after which mining heights can be increased to 20 feet. 

Because the Mammoth and Childs deposits are at or near surface and because the actual 

mining area is yet to be finalized, CNI used a 70 degree crack angle to identify where Copper 

Creek is likely to be impacted and where to locate potential shaft locations.   

CNI recommends diverting Copper Creek when either of the following happens: 

a) The fill height of the American Eagle or Keel is 600 feet, or 

b) When post pillar cut and fill mining starts at either the Mammoth or Childs.  

The mine schedule includes open stope mining part of the Childs and Mammoth deposits 

as the access is developed down to the American Eagle and Keel.  This mining will be of a 

limited area and the backfill will be a cemented fill.  Therefore the surface subsidence is 

unlikely. 

The location of potential shaft sites based on the property boundary and estimated crack 

limit can be seen in Figure 2-1.  The predicted distance over which Copper Creek should be 

diverted is shown in Figure 2-1. 

Shaft location Option 1 is preferred because it is at a lower elevation and further away 

from the proposed Old Reliable pit crest.

3.0 DEPOSIT CHARACTERISTICS 

The deposits being considered for PPCF include the American Eagle, Keel, Mammoth 

and Childs.  Brief descriptions of the deposits' geomechanical characteristics are provided in the 

following sections. 

3.1 Deposit Geometries and RQD 

Steve Milne of Milne & Associates provided a cut-off grade for the PPCF mining 

method.  Using that cut-off grade, potential mining geometries were defined using the 100 x 100 

x 25 foot block model provided by Independent Mining Consultants (IMC).  The general 

geometric parameters defining the deposits are as follows:

Mammoth 500 1000 2550 0 67% GDI/Breccia 

Childs 400 500 2900 0 64% Breccia 

 

The American Eagle and Keel have a median RQD greater than 90 percent and the 

Mammoth and Childs have a median RQD of around 65 percent.  Figure 3-1 presents a 

cumulative percent distribution of drill hole RQD data by deposits for intervals with greater than 

0.4 percent copper equivalent.   

3.2 Geologic Structure 

Based on the surface cell mapping and oriented core hole data, the distributions of 

structure set in the area appears to be similar and the property was interpreted to be one geologic

domain.   Figure 3-2 shows the locations of the surface cells mapped and the traces of the 

oriented core holes projected to the surface. 

Figure 3-3 shows the Schmidt plot of the surface data.  The surface data show that there 

are two near orthogonal joint sets that are steeply dipping (70 to 90 degrees) with a strike of 

north-south and east-west, and a flat set that dips 0 to 30 degrees with a east-west general strike 

(Figure 3-4).  The mean orientation, length and spacing for these geologic sets are as follows:

99 178 86 2.4 12.5 
82 267 86 2.3 6.7 
69 11 19 3.0 7.3 

 

Figure 3-5 shows the Schmidt plot of the oriented core data.  The oriented holes were 

drilled at steep angles, > 70 degrees, which resulted in all structures dipping greater than 60 

degrees falling within the blind zone, leaving the data difficult to interpret.  The Schmidt plot 

does show the flat joint set as seen in the surface cell data but there is little to no indication of the 

steep joint sets.  The oriented core data show an intermediate (30 to 55 degrees) dipping joint set 

in all dip directions which is not present in the cell mapping data.  

For this study we have assumed that all of the deposits are in the same structural domain 

and the surface data reflect the orientations at depth. 

3.3 Rock Strengths

Figure 3-6 and Figure 3-7 show the intact shear strengths and fracture shear strengths for 

the different materials.  The samples collected from the 2007 testing campaign were all collected 

from within the Mammoth deposit, and because the distribution of the different alteration types 

was unknown the resulting linear strengths were calculated from all of the 2007 tested materials.  

These strengths were applied to both the Mammoth and the Childs deposits because of the 

proximity of the deposits and their shared alteration types.  

The rock mass strength values were calculated using RQD values of 65 percent for the 

Mammoth and Childs and 80 percent for the American Eagle and Keel.  Based on the above 

intact and shear strength values and the RQD values the rock mass strengths are as follows:

3.4 Hydrology and Stress Conditions 

The phreatic surface was assumed to be at the same level as the San Pedro River which 

runs north to south on the eastern side of the deposit.  The interpreted phreatic surface elevation 

was at 2400 feet which means the American Eagle and Keel will need to be able to handle water 

inflows. Cost for depressurization should be included in the operational budget. 

CNI has assumed that the pre-mine ground stresses are hydrostatic; that is the horizontal 

stress equals the vertical stress.

4.0 ROOM WIDTH 

The room width is the first component to determine for a PPCF mining method.  Because 

we are mining overhand the room width dimensions should require limited ground support.  The 

recommended room width for the four deposits is 20 feet. 

A fracture analysis, Scratch, was used to define the ground support requirements for the 

four deposits.  The Scratch computer program produces a 2-D cross section of randomized 

fracture orientation, length, and spacing distributions as seen in Figure 4-1.  Potential failure 

paths were defined at room widths of 15, 20 and 25 feet.  Failure paths could include up to two 

feet of intact rock.  Cumulative distribution plot of failure heights can be seen in Figure 4-2.  The 

failure area was normalized for the different room widths by dividing the failure area by the 

room width; the cumulative distribution plot for the three room widths is shown in Figure 4-3.  

The failure area per foot of room width increases from 1.0 to 1.8 feet2 when increasing room 

width from 15 ft to 20 ft; failure area increases from 1.8 to 3.7 feet2 when increasing from 20 ft 

to 25 ft.  Also the average failure height increases from 3.8 feet for a 20-ft wide room to 6.9 feet 

in a 25-ft wide room.  For this evaluation CNI has recommended a room width of 20 ft which 

will require the use of 4-foot long split set bolts.

5.0 PILLAR ANALYSIS 

For a PPCF mining method the pillar width must meet two criteria: 

1) The factor of safety at the 5th lift with backfill up to the 4th lift is equal to or greater 
than 1.0, and 

2) The factor of safety for a pillar exposed for a single lift and no fill is greater than 1.3.

Rock mass strengths were calculated from the testing data, and median rock quality 

designation (RQD) values are outlined in Section 3-4.   

Four different square pillar dimensions were analyzed for the deposits: 15 ft, 20 ft, 25 ft 

and 30 ft.  In order to accommodate the mining equipment, lifts of 15 ft are required for the first 

five lifts after which 20 ft mining increments can be achieved.  The room width is 20 ft as 

discussed in Section 4 of this report.  There has been no testing of the backfill and so for the 

post-pillar analysis CNI assumed the following properties: 

Density = 130 pcf  

Cohesion of 1 psi  

Friction Angle of 36o   



5-2 

CALL & NICHOLAS, INC. 

Sources of fill material that meet these requirements could include ROM waste rock or 

cyclone tailings blended with cement to absorb water.  The backfill should be as dense as 

possible and trafficable; the compressive strength of the fill is not critical for pillar stability. 

5.2 Pillar Analysis Results  

Using Wilson's pillar calculations, factors of safety were calculated for square pillar 

dimensions of 15, 20, and 25 ft for pillar heights of 15 to 75 ft at 15 ft increments.  Individual 

results of those calculations are presented on Figures 5-1 through 5-3.  For the American Eagle 

and Keel deposits 20 by 20 foot square pillars will be sufficient and the Mammoth and Childs 

deposits require 25 by 25 foot pillar dimensions.  Ore recovery for the American Eagle/Keel and 

Mammoth/Childs deposits will be 75 percent and 64 percent, respectively, for the given 

geometries.

6.0 SUBSIDENCE AND IMPACT ON COPPER CREEK 

The potential for surface subsidence has been evaluated for shaft location and Copper 

Creek diversion.  Figure 6-1 shows a plan map of the potential PPCF mining area relative to 

Copper Creek as well as the location of sections.  Given today's monitoring capabilities with 

accuracy between 1/10 and 1/50 of feet, ground subsidence due to mining will be noticed. 

At this early stage of the study, CNI recommends diverting Copper Creek when either of 

the following occurs: 

a) The fill height of the American Eagle or Keel is 600 feet. 

b) When post-pillar cut and fill mining starts at either the Mammoth or Child.   

The mine schedule includes open stope mining part of the Childs and Mammoth deposits 

as the access is developed down to the American Eagle and Keel.  This mining will be of a 

limited area and the backfill will be a cemented fill.  Therefore the surface subsidence is 

unlikely. 

Copper Creek should be diverted before mining starts at the Mammoth or Childs deposit 

because of their shallow depths.  The concern is whether or not Copper Creek needs to be 

diverted before the American Eagle or Keel deposits are completed.  Assuming the ground caves 

above the PPCF, the ground bulks up by swelling (25 to 35%), and the cave shape is more like a 

flat back than a triangle or cone, the cave would impact the surface when mining is at the 1600 

foot elevation if mining started on the 1000 foot elevation.  

Surface cracking should be within the limits of 75 degrees and 54 degrees from the 

bottom of mining (Figures 6-2 through 6-5).  The 75 degree crack angle is based on a step path 

angle defined by the steep joint set and the flat joint set.  The 54 degree crack angle is based on 

coal subsidence calculations.  The crack angle could be flatter if there are regional type flat (20 

to 50 degrees) structures. For this evaluation we will consider the crack angle to be 70 degrees 

because the 54 degrees is based on coal type ground which is not in this area.

7.0 SHAFT LOCATION 

Shaft locations were selected based on proximity to the deposits, crack limits, and 

processing facilities (Figure 7-1).  The coordinates of the two proposed shaft locations are as 

follows: 

 

Option Easting Northing  Elevation Concerns 

1 401629 638766 3970 560 feet from Old Reliable Pit 

2 401700 638238 4050 
380 feet from Old Reliable Pit, steep 
topography 

 

Option 1 is at a lower elevation than Option 2, and Option 1 is further away from the 

proposed Old Reliable pit crest.

8.0 FUTURE WORK 

To bring the Copper Creek deposits' geotechnical investigation up to prefeasibility level 

additional information and analyses will be required.  Outlined below is a summary of those 

additional items: 

• Selective strength testing from each separate deposit as well as continued sampling 
and testing of exploration and geotechnical holes 

• At least two Reflex or Televiewer oriented drill holes per deposit with sample 
collection and piezometer installation 

• Hydrology study to define regional phreatic surface and hydraulic conductivity tests 
from within the ore zone   

• Earthquake study to define design seismic criterion 

• Updated RQD block model with drill hole and model statistics 

• Shaft location test drill hole (vertical) with geomechanical logging and sample 
collection and testing 

• Old Reliable slope design evaluation including oriented core holes and strength 
testing 

• Update room width and pillar analysis based on RQD and additional strengths 

• Perform a numerical analysis to better predict the relationship between mining and 
impact on Copper Creek.

Size reduction of the ROM ore by using primary Jaw crusher to reduce the ore from run of mine (ROM) to minus 11 
inches.

     Process Design Criteria provide the basis for the selection of the type, number, duty and size of process equipment. 
Process Design Criteria are not a guarantee of plant performance.  The criteria for the plant are outlined below.  The 
plant has been designed to process 1,295 tph per line at a 92.5% operating time at the design feed grade and recovery. 
The grind area pumps, tailing pumps and water supply systems are designed to process 1,619 tph per line, allowing a 
1.25 design factor for these systems.  No additional design factor is provided.  

Tailing from the flotation process is thickened and disposed in the tailing storage facility.  Water reclaimed from the 
thickener and tailing dam is recycled to the milling and flotation process.  

     The copper - moly concentrate produced is thickened and further processed in the moly flotation plant to separate 
the copper minerals from the molybdenum.  Flotation equipment in the moly plant includes conventional mechanically 
agitated equipment and flotation columns.  Products from the moly plant are either a salable copper or moly 
concentrate.  Thickeners and filters required to produce salable products are also installed.   

     Cyclone overflow, the grinding circuit product, is fed to the copper moly flotation circuit.  This circuit consists of 
roughers and two cleaning stages. All cells are conventional mechanically agitated cells.  

Size reduction of the ore in a semi-autogenous (SAG) mill - ball mill grinding circuit prior to processing in a flotation 
circuit.  The SAG mill will operate in closed circuit with a trommel screen and a pebble crushing circuit.  The ball mills 
will operate in closed circuit with hydrocyclones.

Cyclone overflow, the grinding circuit product, is fed to the copper flotation circuit.  This circuit consists of roughers and

The crushing circuit will consist of a single-stage Primary Jaw Crushing that will be located underground in the mine. An 
apron feeder transfers run-of-mine ore at a controlled rate to a grizzly screen.  The screen oversize feeds the jaw 
crusher. The crusher reduces the size of run-of-mine ore from maximum 18 inches to nominally 80% passing 5 inches. 
Crushed ore drops onto a belt conveyor that transports the crushed ore to a crushed ore stockpile.  Dust is controlled in 
the dump pocket with water sprays and bin vents service the contained transfer points. 

Crushed ore will be conveyed from the underground crusher to the mill area.  A fixed stacker will be provided.  Dry bin 
vents will be used at crusher transfer points.  A coarse water spray is planned for the stacker discharge.

Primary crushed ore will be stockpiled on the ground.  One reclaim tunnel will be installed beneath the stockpile.  The 
stockpile will contain approximately 25,000 tons of "live" ore storage.  When required, ore will be moved from the "dead" 
storage area to the "live" storage area by front-end loader or bulldozer.
Ore will be withdrawn from the coarse ore reclaim stockpile by variable speed apron feeders (one operating and one 
standby).  The feeders will discharge to conveyor belts . Conveyor will discharge to the SAG mill in the grinding circuit.  
The ore reclaim rate will be monitored by belt scale mounted on conveyor.
Dust control in the Coarse Ore Stockpile Area will be by the dry type dust collector system.  It will be installed to control 
dust in the ore reclaim tunnel.

     The SAG mill discharge is screened and the oversize is fed via conveyors to the SAG mill feed conveyor.  Weigh 
scales are installed so that the weight of material recycled can be monitored.  A recycle crushing system may be 
provided in the future.

The following froth factors are to be applied for flotation concentrates in the copper-moly flotation operations.  

Secondary grinding will be performed in two ball mills operated in parallel.  Each ball mill will operate in closed circuit 
with hydrocyclones.  Ball mill discharge will be combined with trommel screen undersize in cyclone feed pump box and 
will be pumped to hydrocyclone clusters.  Combined slurry will be pumped using variable speed horizontal centrifugal 
slurry pumps (two operating and one uninstalled spare) to the primary cyclone clusters.  Hydrocyclone underflow will 
flow by gravity to the ball mills.  Hydrocyclone overflow (final grinding circuit product) will flow by gravity to the flotation 
circuit.

Cyclone overflow from each cyclone cluster will be sampled by primary samplers and analyzed by the copper on-stream 
analyzer for metallurgical control prior to flotation. Cyclone overflow from each cyclone cluster will also be monitored for 
particle size distribution by particle size monitor.

     Mechanically-agitated flotation cells have been selected for all flotation stages.  The roughers are large tank cells, 
and the cleaner and recleaners are smaller conventional cells.  Flotation stage residence times have not been 
optimized. The design residence times selected are approximately two times the laboratory test program retention 
times.  Key flotation stage design parameters are summarized below

     Flotation test work is in progress at Metcon Research.  A conventional copper - moly flotation circuit is the basis for 
this plant design.

optimized and the degree of regrind will be determined while in operation. The regrind size can be controlled by monitoring the 
power draught and ball charge.  Regrind mill discharge will be sized in a cyclone and fine material produced will be processed 
through the cleaning and recleaning circuit.  Cyclone underflow will be returned to the regrind mill.  A tower mill has been selected 
for the regrind duty. for this study, the regrind product size of 65 microns will be used.

Copper Moly concentrate produced will be thickened.  Thickener overflow will be routed to the mill process water tank.  Thickener 
underflow is pumped to the moly plant and concentrate handling facility.  

Tailings from the rougher flotation and tailings from the copper first cleaner scavenger flotation will flow by gravity to high rate 
tailings thickener.  Thickener overflow will flow by gravity from the tailings thickener overflow tank to the process water pond.  
Thickener underflow will be pumped by variable speed horizontal centrifugal slurry pumps (One operating and one stand-by) to 
tailing dam or backfill facility. 

A backfill plant will be built utilizing the flotation tailings.  The tailings will be de-slimed, using a cyclone cluster, and the coarse 
fraction pumped into the underground facilities for used in backfilling.  The slimes fraction, carried in the cyclone overflow, will 
report to the slime thickening and dewatering.  A seperate thickening system will be used to accomplish this task.

Tailings produced will be pumped from the tailing thickener in the mill area to a surge tank located at the backfill plant.

The copper concentrate produced will be thickened prior to filtration.

Moly ReCleaner tailing and Moly Cleaner tailing will be thickened.  Thickener underflow will be pumped to the 1st Mo Cleaner 
Conditioning tank.  Thickener overflow will join the Moly water circuit.  The use of the thickener in this position in the circuit will 
allow good density control in the moly flotation circuit.

The process water tank receives tailings thickener overflow, tailings reclaim water, and water from the process water pond. Fresh 
water can be added to the process water tank only if necessary.  The process water is pumped to the grinding circuit and may 
contain a small amount of solids so it is not suitable for general distribution throughout the process plant. 

Water reclaimed from the copper thickener, filters and moly concentrate filter will contain residual hydrosulfide and will be 
recycled internal to the moly plant.  

A process water surge pond is planned for this study.  Decant pond overflow, tailing reclaim water, and fresh water can be stored 
in this pond.  Approximately 24 hours of storage is planned.

     The fresh water distribution system provides fresh water for process requirements such as process water makeup, the moly 
plant, reagent mixing, and gland water. The bulk of the process makeup water will be added to the thickener and will be fed to the 
circuit from the pipeline from the booster station to the transfer tank.  There is no raw water surge provided on this supply.  
Controls will be installed to ensure flow to the process water system when the raw water system is operating.  The balance of the 
raw water required will be pumped from the existing transfer tank to the head tank.  From the head tank, low pressure process 
water will flow to the systems that do not require high pressure including lime slaking and fresh water to the moly plant.  Booster 
pumps will be installed to provide high pressure water to the systems that require it including the crusher dust control system and 
pump gland water.  Pumps and a control system will be installed at the raw water head tank to provide pressure to the fire water 
system.  Fresh water distribution requirements and storage volume are summarized below:

Reagent addition points, slurry pH levels and quantities are generally as used for tests conducted at Metcon. Reagent addition 
rates and design criteria for reagent preparation facilities are provided below.

RE: SITING STUDY FOR PRODUCTION WELL LOCATIONS, REDHAWK 
COPPER INC., SAN MANUEL, ARIZONA  

 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 

This technical memorandum presents the results of a comprehensive site and hydrogeologic 
study ultimately intended to locate groundwater production well target sites for the Copper 
Creek Project Area in Copper Creek, Arizona (Figure 1).  The target sites identified from this 
study are initially intended to target locations for exploration boreholes or small diameter 
aquifer test wells, necessary to validate aquifer properties and water production zones, before 
recommending large diameter production wells.  This memorandum was prepared by Golder 
Associates Inc. (Golder) for Redhawk Copper Inc. (Redhawk).   

2.0 BACKGROUND 

Due to the expansion of the planned mining operations, the operations' demands for 
groundwater have increased accordingly.  Total groundwater resources necessary for the 
increased production have been estimated by Redhawk to be approximately 2,500 gallons per 
minute (gpm) of continuous flow.  In 2007, Golder conducted hydrogeologic studies of the 
bedrock aquifer systems in the Copper Creek Project Area, which demonstrated that the 
groundwater production potential is minimal.  It is therefore anticipated that the lower basin 
fill of the San Pedro Valley is the only aquifer system close enough to the project area with 
the necessary capacity.  It is also anticipated that regulatory agencies will require a 
demonstration that the proposed groundwater withdrawals will not impact surface flow of the 
San Pedro River, an adjudicated riparian corridor.

3.0 GEOLOGY 

The San Pedro River Valley is a basin bounded on the east by the Galiuro Mountains and on 
the west by the Santa Catalina Mountains.  Near Copper Creek it is bounded on the west by 
the Black Hills.  Overall, the region consists mainly of pre-Late Cretaceous igneous 
intrusions and volcanics and Cenozoic sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive units.  The area is 
cut by several systems of faults, most of which trend generally in a northwest direction.  The 
western and eastern edges of the basin are marked by two major normal faults:  the Cholla 
Fault and the Copper Creek Fault, respectively.  Regional surface geology and geologic 
features are shown in Figure 2, which was produced by a synthesis of investigations by 
Heindl, 1963 and Dickinson, 1992 (Heindl, 1963; Dickinson, 1992). 

The specific area of interest for this study is situated within the basin-fill deposits, bounded 
roughly by the San Pedro River to the west, the Copper Creek fault to the east, Clark Wash to 
the south and Copper Creek Road to the north (Figure 3).  The alluvial sediments within this 
area have been eroded and three significant surface features are evident on maps and when 
viewed from a distance (Figure 3).  The lowest surface feature is composed of the active river 
channel and flood-plain deposits.  The next highest surface is the Whetstone pediment which 
is present downslope from the Tombstone pediment.  These erosional surfaces increase in 
age and elevation away from the river.  The lower unit of the Quiburis and the Sacaton 
formations underlie the Whetstone pediment while the upper unit of the Quiburis underlies 
the Tombstone pediment. 

3.1 Geologic History 

Throughout the late Cretaceous and Tertiary, the Cloudburst formation was deposited over an 
expansive region which includes the area occupied by the present-day Galiuro Mountains.  
The Cloudburst formation is characterized by a lower volcanic unit and an upper 
fanglomerate unit, and was deposited on Precambrian quartz monzonite.  The deposits were 
laid down during a period of tectonic unrest in the region, and thus were deformed, intruded, 
and uplifted throughout and after their deposition.  After deposition ceased, the Cloudburst 
deposits were beveled into a terrain of low relief at the site of the present-day Galiuro 
Mountains, whereas in the Black Hills, the topography remained rugged. 

During the middle Tertiary, the Galiuro Volcanics were deposited, originating from east of 
the present-day San Pedro Basin.  The deposits formed an angular unconformity between 
older volcanic rocks and the Cloudburst formation.  Contemporaneously with or shortly after 
deposition of the middle Tertiary volcanic rocks, deformation including folding and faulting 
occurred between the Santa Catalina Mountains and the Black Hills.  A deep 
southward-draining valley was incised west of the axis of the present-day San Pedro Valley,

as erosion acted along lines of structural weakness.  The valley then filled with alluvial 
deposits, forming the middle Tertiary San Manuel formation.  These deposits later became 
the footwall of the San Manuel Fault.  Final movement along the San Manuel Fault preceded 
classic basin-and-range type block faulting, which began around the beginning of the 
Pliocene.  Episodic displacement along the Cholla fault to the west and the Copper Creek 
fault to the east elevated the Santa Catalina and Galiuro Mountains, respectively, to their 
present positions.  The block between the ranges dropped to form the trough of the present-
day San Pedro Valley. 

Through drainage during initial stages of erosion in the basin removed middle Tertiary 
volcanic rocks in the western and central parts of the San Pedro Valley.  The Quiburis 
formation was then deposited disconformably on the remaining middle Tertiary volcanic 
rocks and the Cloudburst formation.  Through or well-integrated drainage was not 
established at this point in time, and lakes and playas formed.  The Quiburis formation 
consists of fine-grained deposits near the center of the basin and coarser-grained sediments 
toward the margins of the valley.  The central axis of the deposits is located approximately 
two miles east of the present-day San Pedro River, and the deposits on both sides of the 
valley are asymmetrical.  Therefore, uplift on the two sides of the valley was not likely 
simultaneous nor necessarily of the same magnitude.  The Quiburis formation also contains 
an upper unit which disconformably overlies the lower unit, composed of alluvial 
conglomerates.  This suggests that throughout the creation of the Quiburis formation, 
intermittent periods of erosion and deposition occurred. 

During the middle Pleistocene, a drainage system established itself in the valley, west of the 
central axis of the Quiburis deposits.  The main channel with numerous tributaries developed 
subparallel to the present-day San Pedro River system.  At a later point in time, the valley 
was in part refilled with the fluvial and alluvial deposits of the Sacaton formation.  During 
the late Quaternary, the latest sequence of erosional incising began, which created the 
present-day San Pedro River system.  The river system cut through the Sacaton and older 
deposits, and then partly refilled with flood-plain deposits.  At present, the river is again 
incising the late flood-plain deposits. 

3.2 Geologic Units and Cross Sections 

The basin fill of the study area, based on the limited available information 
(Heindl, 1963; Dickinson, 1992) is believed to consist of the units described below: 

Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary Cloudburst Formation 
The Cloudburst Formation, estimated at over 8,000-feet (ft) thick, is moderately well 
indurated, and is characterized by a lower volcanic unit and an upper fanglomerate unit.  The

volcanic unit, estimated to be approximately 3,000-ft thick, is composed predominantly of 
andesitic flows with intercalated volcaniclastic beds.  The fanglomerate member, estimated at 
8,000- ft thick, was deposited on the lower volcanic unit, and is composed predominantly of 
cobble to boulder conglomerate beds of impure arkose, greywacke, and sandy mudstone.  
The fanglomerate member may be further subdivided into a lower subunit, containing 
predominantly volcanic rock fragments, and an upper subunit, composed predominantly of 
granitic rock fragments.  The lower subunit is typically gray to maroon in color and contains 
basal beds of thin-bedded sandy mudstone and muddy sandstone.  Above the basal beds, the 
lower subunit contains pebbles, cobbles, and small boulders.  The upper subunit is mostly 
composed of quartz monzonite fragments, and is less sorted/bedded than the lower subunit. 

Mid-Tertiary Galiuro Volcanic Formation 
The Galiuro Volcanics consist of andesitic to latitic lavas, rhyodacite to rhyolite ignimbrites, 
and rhyolitic domes, with intercalated volcaniclastic strata.  They originate from the east of 
the basin and are believed to thin and pinch out somewhere within the confines of the basin. 

Quiburis Formation 
The valley-wide alluvial deposits that now underlie most of the San Pedro Valley form the 
Quiburis formation.  The formation is estimated to be at least 2,400-ft thick and consists of 
two units, the lower unit (1,700 ft) and the upper unit (700 ft).  The lower unit includes the 
fine-grained deposits (lacustrine lake beds) exposed in the center of the valley and coarser 
deposits, consisting of pebbly sandstone and sandy-pebble conglomerate into which they 
grade laterally.  Evaporite beds such as gypsum occur in the fine-grained facies as irregular 
thin beds and along young faults and fractures.   

The upper unit is recognized only on the east side of the valley, and is composed of a pebbly 
to bouldery conglomerate that disconformably overlies the lower unit.  The upper unit 
extends eastward to the Copper Creek fault where it has an exposed thickness of 
approximately 700 ft.  The upper unit contains channel type crossbedding and is poorly 
sorted, bedded and consolidated.  The fragment composition of the lower and upper units of 
the Quiburis includes basalt, andesite, and a variety of rhyolite flow rocks, tuffs and 
intrusions. 

Sacaton Formation 
The Sacaton Formation is comprised of late Tertiary alluvial deposits consisting 
predominantly of poorly consolidated sands and gravels of volcanics from the nearby 
mountains.  The Sacaton Formation lies on a scoured surface cut into the underlying fined-
grained sediments of the Quiburis, and attains a maximum thickness of 250 ft near the valley 
axis and thins outward towards the mountains.  The base of the Sacaton Formation in the 
central part of the valley is marked by a bouldery channel fill that is as much as 20-ft thick

where exposed in the cliffs along the San Pedro River.  The Sacaton Formation overlies the 
lower unit of the Quiburis and is not considered to have potential as an aquifer. 

Recent Alluvium 
Alluvial deposits consisting of flood-plain, channel-fill, and terrace deposits, occur along the 
inner valley of the San Pedro River.  The surface of the floodplain is from less than 5 to 
approximately 10 ft above the floor of the river channel.  These flood plain deposits consist 
of sand and gravel, sandy silt and sandy mudstones.  The upper few feet are commonly 
composed of finer materials, sandy silt and mudstone, in beds 1-to 3-ft thick, which are 
underlain by sand and gravel to depths of 60 to 80 ft.  The gypsiferous deposits of the 
Quiburis formation lie directly below.  The active channel is composed of unconsolidated 
sand and gravel. 

The alluvial basin-fill sediments in the Lower San Pedro basin are composed of a younger 
basin fill, an older basin fill, and a basal conglomerate.  In some parts of the basin study area 
the Tertiary Galiuro Volcanic unit is present between the basal conglomerate and the lower 
basin fill.  Three cross sections have been developed from a compilation of well logs and 
cross sections completed by earlier investigators.  The cross section locations are shown on 
Figure 3.  Cross section (A-A') was constructed parallel to the valley axis, and two cross 
sections (B-B', C-C') were constructed roughly transverse to the valley axis, to illustrate the 
differences and complexities of the stratigraphy in the study area. 

Cross section A-A' (Figure 4) depicts the relationship between the basal conglomerate, 
Quiburis Formation, and the overlying recent river sediments.  Fine-grained deposits similar 
to those exposed in the cliffs along the river are indicated in well logs at depths greater than 
1,200 feet below ground surface (ft bgs) along the axis of the river.  The recent San Pedro 
river sediments, including the active channel and floodplain deposits containing the 
unconfined aquifer, are reported from well logs to be from 60 to 80-ft deep.  

Cross section B-B' (Figure 5) is constructed transverse to the axis of the San Pedro River  
along a line that runs approximately 1 mile south of Mammoth up the Copper Creek drainage 
to the Copper Creek Mine area (Figure 3).  Cross section C-C' (Figure 6, attached) is 
constructed on a line that runs from the San Manuel tailings  diagonally across the San Pedro 
River to the Copper Creek drainage and then along the Copper Creek drainage to the Copper 
Creek mine area.  Drill records used to construct cross sections B-B' and C-C' illustrate the 
relationships between the various units of the upper and lower members of the Quiburis 
Formation and the underlying Galiuro Volcanic and Cloudburst units.  The cross sections 
demonstrate the classic concept of basin deposit formation with coarse deposits laid along the 
valley margins and finer deposits towards the middle of the basin.  The central axis of the 
valley, at the time when the lake beds were laid down, is estimated to be approximately 2

miles east of the present course of the San Pedro River.  The center of the present valley 
contains the lower unit of the Quiburis which consists of lake beds with finely laminated clay 
and sandy mudstone units with interbedded tuffaceous deposits.  Gypsum and other 
evaporites occur in these lacustrine sediments as irregular beds, disseminated particles and 
vein filling along faults and fractures.  On the east side of the river, the lake beds transition 
into a pebbly conglomerate on a northwest trending line approximately 3 miles east of the 
river.  Half of a mile east of this line, the fine-grained beds pass beneath the surface.   

The upper unit of the Quiburis begins to overlie the lower unit on a line that roughly parallels 
the San Pedro River approximately 3 miles to the east, and extends to the Copper Creek fault 
(Figures 5 and 6).  On topographic maps and aerial photographs, two distinct surfaces 
(pediments) can be seen on the alluvial sediments east of the San Pedro River (Figure 3).  
The Tombstone Pediment, which is higher in elevation, is formed on the upper unit of the 
Quiburis, while the lower elevation Whetstone Pediment is formed along on the Sacaton 
Formation and lower unit of the Quiburis.  The linear break between these two surfaces is 
possibly related to an unmapped fault or series of faults (Figure 2).  The apparent 
displacement of mid-Tertiary volcanic rocks below the Quiburis and changes in the 
sedimentary characteristics of the lower and upper units of the Quiburis implies that faulting 
was contemporaneous, but not continuous throughout deposition. 

4.0 HYDROGEOLOGY 

The Copper Creek watershed drains an area of approximately 21 square miles.  The 
watershed ranges in elevation from 2,500 ft at the confluence of Copper Creek with the San 
Pedro River to 6,000 ft at the basin divide.  The Lower San Pedro Basin contains 
approximately 1,600 square miles.  Elevations along the valley floor range from 3,400-feet 
above mean sea level (ft amsl) at the basin's southern end to 1,920-ft amsl at the northern 
end.  The Rincon, Santa Catalina, Black, Tortilla, Dripping Springs and Galiuro mountain 
ranges form its' boundaries.  Surface data have shown that upper Copper Creek discharge is 
ephemeral and decreases rapidly during the spring and early summer months.  Normally, 
flow in Copper Creek does not reach the San Pedro River. 

4.1 Hydrostratigraphy and Hydraulic Properties 

The lower San Pedro river basin contains two major water-bearing units:  the streambed 
Holocene alluvium that forms the San Pedro River channel and floodplain, and the alluvial 
basin fill deposits that are composed of a younger basin-fill, older basin-fill, and a basal 
conglomerate.  The basin-fill deposits form the basin's primary aquifer because of their high 
permeability and large volume.  Due to recent surface water adjudication, water rights, and 
permitting issues, this study did not consider groundwater from the upper aquifer associated

with the San Pedro River or its baseflow as potential supply water for the Copper Creek 
project.  The study concentrated on the lower basin fill groundwater that is hydrologically 
isolated from the San Pedro River system. 

Regionally, the hydrologic characteristics of the aquifer can vary widely due to compaction 
and the presence of fine-grained units within the basin-fill sediments.  Due to this variability 
of basin-fill sediments, the groundwater yields from wells drilled in the basin fill along the 
east side of the valley range from yields of 70 gpm to as much as 1,900 gpm.  Well records 
indicate that the wells with high yields are pumping from both the lower and upper aquifers.  
Towards the center of the valley, groundwater from wells within the lower aquifer system are 
found to exhibit artesian conditions.  Most wells drilled deeper than 500 ft encounter artesian 
conditions especially in sand and gravel layers 600- to 800- and 1,200- to 1,300-ft bgs.  
Away from the river valley towards the Galiuro Mountains information on groundwater is 
poor.  A well, D(9-17)2DCB, drilled to 1,025-ft bgs south of Mulberry Wash, approximately 
1 mile east of the river (Figure 3), encountered water at 250-ft bgs; however, yield was 
minimal and it was considered a dry well by its owner.  Wells 55-615551 and 55-615552 
along Copper Creek Road near the eastern edge of the Whetstone Pediment were drilled for 
stock water and production water respectively.  Groundwater production rates from these 
wells are not known. 

The basal conglomerate unit is generally tightly cemented, but where weakly cemented or 
fractured, well yields of several hundred gpm have been reported. 

4.2 Groundwater Flow and Gradients 

Groundwater movement is from higher elevations in the mountains towards the valley and 
then northwest parallel to the San Pedro River, as indicated by the Arizona Department of 
Water Resources (ADWR) well and water depth information provided in Table 1 and shown 
in Figure 7.  The basin-fill aquifer is separated from the fractured bedrock aquifer by a west-
dipping, mountain bounding fault system.  The mountain bounding fault is thought to act as 
both a recharge system and an aquitard. 

Groundwater moves readily between the younger and older basin-fill units, and between the 
streambed alluvium and the basin fill units.  A previous study (Page, 1963) has concluded 
that groundwater from the confined aquifer near Mammoth may exhibit an upward gradient 
and leak into the upper aquifer.   

Groundwater gradients calculated from groundwater elevation contours show gradients in the 
river gravels at 0.004-feet per foot (ft/ft) and steeper gradients of 0.06- and 0.03-ft/ft in basin-
fill and alluvial fan sediments, respectively.  Areas with lower groundwater gradients, as seen

Mr. Joe Sandberg - 8 - 073-92593.02

on a groundwater elevation map (Figure 7), have relatively wider spaced contour lines than 
areas with steeper gradients.  Areas with relatively flatter gradients are indicative of regions 
with higher hydraulic conductivity values, leading to higher water production values in a 
correctly constructed water production well.  Mountain front recharge is thought to be the 
main source of recharge for the basin fill aquifer systems.  Recharge to the basin-fill aquifer 
systems is also thought to occur as infiltration from streambed alluvium.  Direct infiltration 
on mountain front pediments is considered negligible due to high evaporation rates and low 
rainfall totals. 

4.3 Water Quality 

In general, groundwater in the Lower San Pedro River Basin is slightly alkaline (pH >7) and 
has Total Dissolved Solids values < 1,000 milligrams per liter (mg/L).  Groundwater from 
the basin-fill aquifers generally has higher water quality than the floodplain and artesian 
aquifers. 

5.0 PROPOSED WELL LOCATIONS 

A total of four locations have been identified with hydrogeologic and logistical 
characteristics thought to be suitable for the siting of production wells.  Based on extensive 
reviews of geologic and hydrogeologic data in the form of geologic reports, well logs, data 
from state agencies, and the construction of a hydrogeologic conceptual model, the following 
four sites have been targeted as locations suitable for further investigation.  The four sites are 
listed in order of priority and shown on Figure 8. 

5.1 Site 1 

Near Site No. 1, geologic interpretations indicate that the line delineating the higher elevation 
Tombstone Pediment from the lower elevation Whetstone Pediment (Figure 3) comprises a 
change in depositional environments from fine-grained lacustrine sediments to coarser-
grained alluvial sediments.  The depth to water in this area is approximately 300-ft bgs and 
any existing fine-grained sediments encountered in the borehole are expected to be relatively 
thin.  The proximity of Copper Creek Road to the site is advantageous, if the production 
water is to be conveyed along the road. 

The existence of two previously installed wells at this site provides an opportunity to obtain 
hydrologic information without drilling exploration holes.  The two wells (55-615551 and 
55-615552) have been drilled and constructed approximately 500 ft apart in Sections 14 and 
15 of Township 8 South, Range 17 East.  The boreholes were drilled to depths of 360- and 
2,074-ft bgs respectively (Figure 3).  The land is currently leased to the Mercer Ranch and a

stock water pump is installed well 55-615552.  Golder recommends conducting an aquifer 
test on these wells.  This location would be recommended for installation of a production 
well if results of the aquifer tests are sufficient.   

5.2 Site 2 

Site number 2 (Figure 8) was selected based on the same geologic observations as location 
number 1, along the eastern edge of the Whetstone Pediment where the fine-grained 
sediments are observed to grade into coarser sediments.  This site is located along Bunker 
Hill Road, which is advantageous if the production water is to be conveyed along the road. 

5.3 Site 3 

Site number 3 (Figure 8) is sited on the same geologic principles as Sites 1 and 2, however 
this site is located just to the north of the Copper Creek Drainage.  Copper Creek is an 
intermittent stream in the lower reaches and upstream of the narrows area, Copper Creek 
flows most of the year.  Most other drainages in the area flow only in response to large 
precipitation events or extended periods of moisture.  Because water is usually found year 
round in the "narrows" area, it is believed that Copper Creek drainage provides a larger 
amount of groundwater infiltration than other drainages and that the basin-fill aquifer may be 
more productive in the immediate vicinity of Copper Creek drainage than elsewhere. 

5.4 Site 4 

In 1996, Water Management Consultants (WMC) drilled five groundwater exploration 
boreholes as part of a limited water supply investigation.  The boreholes were drilled in the 
vicinity of the "narrows" along Copper Creek, approximately 1,800-feet downstream of the 
Copper Creek Fault.  WMC reports that borehole WW-4R (558923) was drilled to a total 
depth of 600 feet in conglomerate with a static water level reported at 250-ft bgs (Figure 3).  
A temporary 5.5-inch well was installed in the borehole with screen from 276- to 316-ft bgs 
and pumped for 48 hours at a rate of 50-gpm.  At the end of the test total drawdown was 
reported to be 10 feet.  Observation wells located 287 and 1,234 ft away from the pumping 
well had reported drawdowns of 1.5 and 0.3 ft, respectively.  WMC reports in their analysis 
that a 10-inch well constructed to 600-ft bgs would be able to provide production water at a 
continuous rate of 500-gpm.  The impact on the two observation wells suggests that the 
regional aquifer may not have the capacity to host high yield wells.  Golder recommends that 
this site (Figure 8) be investigated further, by drilling and installing a larger scale aquifer test 
well to confirm the findings of WMC and to evaluate the long-term production capacity of 
the local aquifer.  This location is the closest to the planned mining operation and therefore 
offers the potential for the lowest cost groundwater production.

6.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Due to the expansion of the planned mining operations, the total groundwater resources 
necessary for the increased production have been estimated to be approximately 2,500-gpm 
of continuous flow.  It is anticipated that the only aquifer system that has this capacity and is 
close enough to the project area to be viable is the lower basin fill of the San Pedro Valley.  
A total of four sites have been identified in the basin-fill in this study as initially favorable 
for the placement of production wells.  However, before any final recommendations for 
production well sites can be made, further investigations are recommended, as described 
below: 

Site 1: 

This location includes the two State Land Wells (55-615551 and 55-615552) which are 
currently leased to the Mercer Ranch (Figure 8).  If access can be made available, it is 
recommended these wells be surveyed with a downhole video camera to assess well 
construction and conditions in preparation for a full-scale aquifer test.  The aquifer test would 
include a step-rate test followed by a 24-48 hour constant rate test. 

Site 2: 

This site is near the intersection of Bunker Hill Road and the Tombstone-Whetstone 
Pediment boundary.  An aquifer test well consisting of a 1,500-ft deep borehole with 
minimum 8-inch steel casing is recommended for this location (Figure 8). 

Site 3: 

This site is near the intersection of Copper Creek and the Tombstone-Whetstone Pediment 
boundary.  An aquifer test well consisting of a 1,500-ft deep borehole with minimum 8-inch 
steel casing is recommended for this location (Figure 8). 

Site 4: 

This site is near the Ryland Ranch area, where WMC drilled five boreholes as part of a water 
supply investigation.  WMC estimates a 10-inch well could produce 500-gpm in this 
location.  In order to verify the WMC estimate, an aquifer test well consisting of an 800-ft 
deep borehole with minimum 10-inch steel casing is recommended for this location 
(Figure 8).

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The following Technical Memorandum provides a summary of the step-rate and constant-rate aquifer 

testing conducted at a leased well located on State of Arizona land in Pinal County approximately  

3.5 miles East of the town of Mammoth, Arizona (Figure 1).  The State Land Well is registered with the 

Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) with the ADWR No. 55-615552.  The legal location for 

the State Land Well is D(08-17)15 DAA.  ADWR records indicate that the well was drilled as an industrial 

production well in 1972 to approximately 2,074 feet below ground surface (ft-bgs), and cased to  

1,410 ft-bgs with 12-inch perforated/slotted steel casing.  The records indicate that until approximately 

1978 the well was equipped with a diesel powered turbine pump.  Per conversations with local 

inhabitants, the well reportedly produced 600 gallon per minute (gpm) for a mining operation located 

approximately 6 miles to the east.  Currently the well is listed as a leased well for the purpose of stock 

watering and is equipped with a submersible pump capable of 10-15 gpm and set at approximately  

300 ft-bgs. 

Aquifer testing was conducted at the State Land Well from December 7 to December 12, 2011.  The 

purpose of the testing was to determine: 1) the performance characteristics of the well, and 2) the 

hydraulic parameters of the aquifer. 

Aquifer characteristics that can be estimated from a pumping test include transmissivity and hydraulic 

conductivity.  The hydraulic conductivity (K) of an aquifer is a measure of the aquifer's ability to transmit 

water when submitted to a hydraulic gradient.  The transmissivity (T) of an aquifer can be defined as the 

volume of water flowing through a cross-sectional area of an aquifer that is 1 ft. x the aquifer thickness 

under a hydraulic gradient of 1 foot/1 foot.  Hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity are related by the 

equation T = Kb, where b = the saturated thickness of the aquifer. 

2.0 PRE-TESTING ACTIVITIES 
On November 1, 2011, immediately after the pump was pulled from the well, a down-hole video of the 

well was conducted by Well Scan Incorporated.  The results of the well video are shown graphically in 

Figure 2, and described briefly in the following.

 Static water level was observed at 295 ft-bgs, 

 Slotted perforations began at 350 ft-bgs, 

 Large nodular growths appear to be emanating from perforations starting 442 ft-bgs, 

 Perforations are mostly clogged with white precipitate and nodules from 442 to  
1,400 ft-bgs, 

 Perforations end at 1,431 ft-bgs, 

 Bottom of casing at 1,456 ft-bgs, open borehole appears to be conglomerate, 

 Borehole collapsed at 1,583 ft-bgs. 

 
On November 28 and 29, 2011, Empire Pump Corporation dba Duncan Pump, conducted well 

rehabilitation activities consisting of brushing of the well bore.  A 6-inch steel brush was used initially 

during several passes through the well bore to knock off the large nodules observed during the well video.  

A 12-inch nylon brush was then used for general cleaning of the well bore and slots.  Total time of well 

rehabilitation was approximately nine hours. 

3.0 STEP-DRAWDOWN AQUIFER TESTING 
A step rate aquifer test was conducted on December 7, 2011, to evaluate production capability, specific 

capacity, and predicted well efficiency.  In a step-drawdown test, the discharge rate of the well is 

increased from an initially low constant rate through a sequence of pumping intervals of progressively 

higher constant rates.  Each step is typically 2 hours which should be of sufficient duration to allow 

dissipation of wellbore storage effects. 

Empire Pump installed an 8-inch submersible pump to a depth of 630 ft-bgs.  The discharge line was 

equipped with a totalizer/flowmeter for recording instantaneous discharge readings.  Discharge water was 

directed to a nearby stock tank at the lease request.  Static water level before the test began was 

recorded at 295.05 feet below top of casing (ft-btoc). 

The results (drawdown and specific capacity) of the step drawdown test are summarized below and 

displayed graphically in Figure 2.  The specific capacity is determined by dividing the discharge by the 

drawdown.  The resulting number is expressed in gallons per minute per foot.  The specific capacity can 

be used to provide the design pumping rate or maximum yield for the well.  The step-rate aquifer test data 

are presented in Attachment 1. 

 Step 1 

 Time-weighted discharge rate: 139 gpm. 

 Maximum drawdown: 56.37 ft-btoc. 

 Specific Capacity: 2.5 gpm/ft. 

 Step 2 

 Time-weighted discharge rate: 260 gpm.

 Maximum drawdown: 154.77 ft-btoc. 

 Specific Capacity: 1.7 gpm/ft. 

 Step 3 

 Time-weighted discharge rate: 480 gpm. 

 Maximum drawdown: 263.60 ft-btoc. 

 Specific Capacity: 1.8 gpm/ft. 

A total of three increasing pumping steps were conducted at the well during the test.  During the first two 

steps of 140 gpm and 260 gpm the specific capacity of the well decreased from 2.5 gpm/ft to 1.7 gpm/ft.  

At the final step the discharge rate was increased to 480 gpm.  During the final step the specific capacity 

increased from 1.7 gpm/ft to 1.8 gpm/ft.  The increase in specific capacity may be attributable to the well 

developing slightly due to the rehabilitation activities.  Step rate testing activities ended at 4:45 PM and 

the well was allowed to recover for the beginning of the constant rate test.  Based on the analysis of the 

step-rate test data, a discharge rate of from 300 gpm was decided for the constant rate aquifer test. 

4.0 CONSTANT RATE AQUIFER TEST 
Golder conducted a 24-hour constant-rate aquifer test at the State Land Well on December 8, 2011 and 

December 9, 2011.  The purpose of the constant-rate test was to evaluate the local aquifer characteristics 

at sustained pumping rates and to evaluate hydrogeologic conditions such as localized aquifer 

boundaries potentially affecting the well's discharge capacity after extended periods of pumping. 

Prior to the constant-rate aquifer test, the static water level was measured in the State Land Well at 

297.72 ft-btoc.  Flow rates during the constant-rate test ranged from 290 to 310 gpm when checked for 

instantaneous flow.  An average flow rate of approximately 294 gpm was calculated for the entire test 

based on totalizer readings.  Water levels in the State Land Well were measured by a hand-held water 

level sounder.  Water levels were initially measured every minute for the first 10 minutes, then every 

30 minutes by the end of the third hour, and every hour by the end of the seventh hour of the  

constant-rate test.  The constant-rate discharge test data are presented in Attachment 3. 

During the aquifer test sand production was monitored using a Rossum Sand Tester.  Sand production 

during testing ranged from .03 mili-liters per min (mL/min) to .23 mL/min.  Sand production during well 

pumping may be a combination of factors including aquifer properties and well design.  Excessive sand 

production during pumping may have deleterious effects on pumping equipment causing shorten pump 

life and extra water production costs. 

The maximum recorded drawdown during the constant-rate test in the State Land Well was approximately 

162.83 ft-btoc.  The specific capacity of 1.8 gpm/ft was calculated from the time-weighted average 

discharge and the maximum drawdown. After cessation of pumping, the groundwater level recovery was 

monitored for approximately 3 days.

A water level recovery test was conducted immediately following the cessation of pumping at the State 

Land Well.  Water levels in the well were measured periodically for approximately 3 days following the 

pump shutdown.  At the end of the recovery period water levels in the State Land Well had recovered to 

within 1.63 feet of the pre-test static water level, indicating 99 percent recovery.  The recovery test was 

completed on December 12, 2011.  The recovery test data are presented in Appendix H. 

Aquifer parameters were estimated based on the results of the constant-rate discharge test and the water 

level recovery test for the State Land Well.  Figure 4 is a Cooper-Jacob semi-logarithmic plot of drawdown 

versus time.  Figure 5 is a Theis recovery plot showing the residual drawdown versus the ratio of time 

since pumping began (t) and the time since pumping stopped (t'). 

Estimates of transmissivity (T) for the State Land Well from the constant-rate drawdown data of 

approximately 7,392 gallons per day per foot (gpd/ft) were obtained from the Cooper-Jacob analysis for 

the mid-time data, and 8,085 gpd/ft for the late-time data.  Water level recovery data yielded an estimated 

value for transmissivity of 4,851 gpd/ft.  Generally data from water level recovery part of the test is 

considered more reliable due to lack of influence of pumping effects. 

Based on the estimated transmissivity values from both the drawdown and recovery tests and assuming 

that the entire screened interval (1233 feet) of the State Land Well yields water at an equal rate, then the 

hydraulic conductivity (K) of the aquifer in the area of the well ranges from approximately 6.1 to 

3.9 gallons per day per square foot (gpd/ft2) or 0.82 to 0.52 feet per day (ft/d). 

5.0 WATER QUALITY 
On December 9, 2011, approximately 1/2 –hour before the end of the constant-rate aquifer test, a water 

quality sample was collected for analysis.  The sample was analyzed for common metals, cation-anions, 

inorganics, total dissolved solids (TDS), and nitrates.  The laboratory results are provided in  

Attachment 3.  There were no exceedances of water quality standards for any of the constituents of 

concern, and water quality was generally good with low TDS. 

6.0 WELL SUMMARY 
This section presents a summary of the video logging, rehabilitation, and testing of the State Land Well: 

 Well discharge water permits were obtained from ADWR prior to commencement of 
testing activities (Attachment 4). 

 The well video log was conducted on November 1, 2011.  Slotted perforations were 
observed from 350 to 1,431 ft-bgs.  Large nodule and calcite precipitates clogged most of 
the slots.  Uncased borehole ended at 1,583 ft-bgs. 

 Well rehabilitation consisting of brushing the well was conducted on November 28, 2011 
and November 29, 2011. 

 Well/aquifer testing from December 7 through December 12, 2011, which consisted of:

 A 6-hour step-rate test consisting of five intervals at rates averaging about  
1,622 gpm, 139 gpm, 260 gpm, and 480 gpm. 

 A 24-hour constant-rate discharge test at an average flow rate of approximately 
294 gpm. 

 A 3-day water level recovery test following the cessation of the 24-hour constant-rate 
discharge test. 

 At a pumping rate of 294 gpm, the specific capacity of the well is calculated to be 
1.6 gallons per minute per foot (gpm/ft). 

 Transmissivity values of the aquifer at the State Land Well are estimated to range from 
7,392 to 4,851 gpd/ft.  Using an aquifer thickness of 1,233 feet, this yields a hydraulic 
conductivity ranging from 6.1 to 3.9 gpd/ft2 or 0.82 to 0.52 ft/d. 

7.0 7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
After analysis of the constant-rate test data, a range of aquifer transmissivity can be estimated to be 

approximately from 7,500 to 4,800 gpd/ft.  Test data indicates that the well can be pumped for an 

extended period at rates close to 300 gpm.  Water production rates may possibly be improved by further 

well rehabilitation to remove precipitates from the screen slots.  However due to the age of this well, the 

inherent risk of well failure during certain rehabilitation activities may be too great. This well does produce 

quantities of sand when pumping at higher rates, which may cause damage to water production 

equipment over the long term.

Redhawk Copper State Land Well Aquifer Test

Discharge will occur from testing activities. This water is not expected to make it to San Pedro
River which is the closest perennial waterbody. Discharge water is expected to enter a cattle
watering tank, and will then be switched to discharge overland into an un-named wash. Erosion
controls at the discharge point will includes Please see the map attached for the location of the
well and area at which water is expected to enter the un-named wash.

Discharge numbers on the previous page are estimates based on average rates expected during
the test. There will be a 8 hour step rate aquifer test and a 24-48 hour constant rate aquifer test.
This is where the extra gallons will be produced to reach the total of 1,000,000 gallons discharged.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
The following Technical Memorandum provides a summary of the results of a preliminary well spacing 

study located on State of Arizona land in Pinal County, approximately 3.5 miles east of the town of 

Mammoth, Arizona (Figure 1).  The purpose of this study was to locate up to seven possible sites for the 

drilling and installation of mine production wells for the Redhawk Copper project.  It is understood that all 

proposed well sites are currently located on State of Arizona public lands and that a significant permitting 

process is required before any drilling activities can take place.  Potential drill sites were located as close 

as possible to the current access road and Right-of-Way (ROW), and within basin fill sediments thought to 

be the most capable of water production as needed by the project. 

2.0 BACKGROUND DATA 

2.1 Redhawk Water Requirements 
Current mine plans indicate that water production rates of 3,500 to 5,000 gallons per minute for mine 

production processes.  Redhawk Copper has expressed interest in the siting and installation of a water 

production well field located as close as practical to the existing ROW access road.  The current ROW is 

considered to be the primary route for the process water conveyance.  Along this ROW, a well currently 

exists, commonly referred to as the State Land Well (ADWR No. 55-61552), that was drilled and installed 

in 1972 as a production well for mine operation approximately 6 miles to the east.  Records indicate that 

the well was drilled to approximately 2,074 feet below ground surface (ft bgs), and cased to 1,410 ft bgs 

with and reportedly produced 600 gallon per minute (gpm). 

Based on limited data in the area (State Land Well records and test data) and Redhawk's anticipated 

water needs, Golder has assumed a well field of approximately seven wells.  It is anticipated that each 

well would produce approximately 800 gpm for a period of not less than 20 years. 

2.2 Geology 
The lower San Pedro river basin contains two major water-bearing units: the streambed Holocene 

alluvium that forms the San Pedro River channel and floodplain, and the deep alluvial basin fill deposits

that are composed of younger basin-fill, older basin-fill, and a basal conglomerate.  The basin-fill deposits 

form the basin's primary aquifer because of their high permeability and large volume. Due to adjudication 

and surface water ownership issues, this study concentrated on the lower basin fill groundwater that is 

hydrologically isolated from the San Pedro River system. 

Regionally, the hydrologic characteristics of the aquifer can vary widely due to compaction and the 

presence of fine-grained units within the basin-fill sediments.  Due to this variability of basin-fill sediments, 

the groundwater yields from wells drilled in the basin fill along the east side of the valley range from yields 

of 70 gpm to as much as 1,900 gpm.  Away from the river valley, towards the Galiuro Mountains 

information on groundwater is lacking.  The basal conglomerate unit is generally tightly cemented, but 

where weakly cemented or fractured, well yields of several hundred gallons per minute have been 

reported. 

2.3 Aquifer Test Data 
Golder conducted a 24-hour constant-rate aquifer test at the State Land Well.  Estimates of transmissivity 

(T) from the constant-rate drawdown data using the Cooper-Jacob (Cooper, H.H and C.E. Jacob, 1946) 

analysis, were approximately 7,392 (55,300 square feet per day (ft2/day)) gallons per day per foot (gpd/ft) 

for the mid-time data, and 8,085 gpd/ft (60483 ft2/day) for the late-time data.  Water level recovery data, 

using the Theis (Theis, C.V., 1935) analysis, yielded an estimated value for transmissivity of 4,851 gpd/ft 

(36,290 ft2/day). 

Based on the estimated transmissivity values from both the drawdown and recovery tests and assuming 

that the entire screened interval (1,233 feet) of the State Land Well yields water at an equal rate, then the 

hydraulic conductivity (K) of the aquifer in the area of the well ranges from approximately 6.1 to 

3.9 gallons per day per square foot (gpd/ft2) or 0.82 to 0.52 feet per day (ft/d). 

3.0 AQTESOLV ANALYSIS 
AQTESOLV© software was used for predictive analysis of groundwater production potential over a 

20 year period. Although the aquifer testing conducted at the State Land Well has allowed estimation of 

aquifer parameters at this site, the data is not sufficient to support a detailed 3-dimesional numerical 

model. For this reason, analytic solutions that assume homogeneous aquifer properties were applied 

within AQTESOLV to estimate groundwater production potential. The aquifer parameters obtained from 

the testing of the State Land Well were input, with future pumping rates projected forward in time. The 

analytic solutions were applied to predict drawdown over time, from seven pumping wells. No recharge 

boundaries on the aquifer were specified. AQTESOLV is limited to a single set of aquifer parameters.  

AQTESOLV does not have the capability to dynamically integrate spatially distributed recharge to the 

aquifer.

Input parameters for the forward solution model consisted of: 

 Seven pumping wells arranged within the ROW and areas within reasonable access to 
the ROW (Figure 2), 

 Pumping wells were constructed to 1,500 feet in depth and have a radius of 10 inches, 

 Pumping rates for all wells was 800 gpm for a period of 20 years, 

 Aquifer input parameters input were: 

 Transmissivity: 18,000 ft2 per day, 

 Storativity: .001, 

 Aquifer thickness: 1,200 feet, 

 AQTESOLV Analysis: 

 Solution: Theis Equation, 

  Aquifer Type: Confined. 

4.0 RESULTS 
Forward solution analysis of a seven-well production field was conducted in the area of the State Land 

Well.  The purpose of the analysis was to approximate the distance between production wells to supply 

the proposed Redhawk Copper project.  Analysis consisted of importing seven pumping wells at an 

assumed minimum distance along areas accessible to mine access routes.  Aquifer parameters such as 

transmissivity, estimated from the aquifer test, and storage, estimated from general knowledge of basin fill 

aquifers, were imported to the model.  In order to not over-estimate aquifer capability the transmissivity 

estimated from the State Land Well aquifer test was reduced by one-half.  The model was set to run for a 

period of 20 years.  Output data from AQTESOLV is provided as Attachment 1. 

The center of the well field was stationed near the existing State Land Well.  Two wells were sited along 

the existing ROW, one east and one west of the existing State Land Well.  Two wells were sited, ½ mile 

and 1 mile respectively, north of the existing ROW.  Two wells were sited, ½ mile and 1 mile respectively, 

south of the existing ROW (Figure 2). 

The maximum drawdown at the center well, near the current State Land Well, is approximately 59.6 feet 

at the end of the 20 year scenario.  The maximum drawdown at the outlying wells ranged from 54.4 to 

57.8 ft bgs (Figure 3).  These drawdown results are thought to be conservative due to the reduction of the 

aquifer transmissivity estimated from the test, and the lack of recharge or constant head boundaries. 

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
A pumping simulation was conducted for a well field consisting of seven wells near and along the ROW 

for the Redhawk Copper project in Copper Creek.  The simulation was run for 20 years at the continuous 

pumping rate of 800 gpm per well.  The total volume withdrawn in the analysis is 5,600 gpm or 9,000 acre

feet per year.  Maximum drawdown for the center of the well field after 20 years was 59.6 ft bgs.  The 

remaining wells showed maximum drawdowns ranging from approximately 54 to 59 ft bgs.   

Due to the lack of aquifer information in this area, the results of this simulation should be regarded with 

caution, actual groundwater production results may be different.  Golder believes that the highest priority 

for test/production well placement should be the center well nearest the State Land Well.  This well should 

be located approximately 100 feet from the State Land Well.  Information acquired from the testing of this 

well coupled with the State Land Well as an observation well, will provide data essential to further 

quantifying the aquifer characteristics in the general ROW area.  We propose to update the model as new 

data are collected.
