1.0 SUMMARY 
 

1.1 SCOPE OF WORK 
 

At the request of Edgewater Exploration Ltd. (Edgewater), Micon International Limited 

(Micon) has prepared a Resource Estimate of the Corcoesto gold project, located in 

northwest Spain. This Technical Report, prepared in accordance with the reporting standards 

and definitions required under Canadian National Instrument (NI) 43-101, summarizes the 

results of that study.    

 

The Corcoesto deposit is located within the boundaries of the "Ciudad de Masma", "Ciudad 

de Landr√≥" and "Emilita" exploitation concessions. These concessions are 100% owned by 

Mineira de Corcoesto, S.L. (MDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Edgewater. The three 

mining leases have a term of 90 years with a start date of August 10th, 1974, as detailed in 

the Corcoesto Mining Rights Certificate issued by the Energy and Mines Service (Conselleria 

of Economy and Industry) of the Territorial Department of A Coruna, Galicia on February 8, 

2011.   

 

Neither Micon nor any of the authors of this report have or has previously had any material 

interest in Edgewater or related entities or interests. The relationship with Edgewater is solely 

a professional association between the client and the independent consultant. This report is 

prepared in return for fees based upon agreed commercial rates and the payment of these fees 

is in no way contingent on the results of this report.   

 

This report includes technical information which requires subsequent calculations or 

estimates to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages. Such calculations or estimations 

inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a margin of error.  

Where these occur, Micon does not consider them to be material. 

 

This report is intended to be used by Edgewater subject to the terms and conditions of its 

agreement with Micon. That agreement permits Edgewater to file this report as an NI 43-101

1.2 LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION 
 

Corcoesto is an advanced-stage gold exploration project located in the Galicia Region of 

northwest Spain, approximately 1.5 km east of the small village of Corcoesto, approximately 

12 km west of the town of Carballo, and approximately 36 km west-south west of the port 

city of La Coru√±a (Figure 1.1). The deposit is centred at 43¬∞13'30'' N and 8¬∞49'30'' W in the 

municipal district of Cabana de Berganti√±os.

The project area has excellent infrastructure including a network of paved road access and a 

66 kV power line that crosses the property. The commercial infrastructure is mainly 

comprised of local farming and agricultural activities. Although there are several small farms 

within a radius of 10 km of the project area, the primary targets for exploration and 

development are not in cultivated areas. The village of Corcoesto consists of small scattered 

centres of population located west, but outside the area to be affected by the planned mining 

operations.

1.3 GEOLOGY AND MINERALISATION 
 

The Corcoesto gold deposit occurs in a 2 km wide N30E-trending dextral shear zone hosted 

within a regional antiform structure in the northwest part of the Schistose Domain of Galicia-

Tras Os Montes (SDGTM). The SDGTM represents the basement within the Galicia-Tras Os 

Montes Zone (GTMZ), which is part of the Iberian Hercynian Massif. The SDGTM is a 

strongly deformed metamorphic unit, which has been subjected to regional scale recumbent 

folding and thrust faulting. It consists of metasediments (phyllites, graywackes, quartzites 

and cherts) of Precambrian to Devonian age, and orthogneisses derived from Hercynian 

granites and migmatites.   

 

Igneous rocks in the Corcoesto area are related to synkinematic granites that were deformed 

during late stages of formation; this metamorphism deformed the rocks generating a strongly 

foliated texture.   

 

Gold mineralisation at the Corcoesto deposit consists of sheeted quartz veins, quartz breccias 

and silicification that is related to extensional zones within the north-east trending Malpica-

Noia dextral shear zone.  The quartz veins and breccias are hosted in potassically altered 

orthogeniss, biotitic gneiss and schists.   

 

The Corcoesto gold deposit is composed of several major vein systems all of which trend in a 

north-easterly direction.  The southernmost vein system is the Cova Crea vein system. The 

NE part of the structure, hosted in the fine-grained orthogneiss band, consists of sheeted 

veins. To the southwest, the Cova Crea system is hosted in migmatites, biotitic gneiss and 

paragneiss. Narrow quartz veins with arsenopyrite in wider zones of silicification, are 

predominant. Typical Cova Crea mineralisation comprises sheeted quartz veins with a thick 

low-grade zone (between 1.5 g/t Au and 2.0 g/t Au) that includes a higher grade core (above 

3.0 g/t Au).   

 

The most significant mineralised structure in the Corcoesto gold deposit is a N70E trending 

structure in the central area of the deposit that crosscuts all of the N30E trending lithologic 

units. The central and west part of this structure has been named the Pozo del Ingl√©s vein 

system following the local terminology for old underground workings in the area. The 

easternmost part of the structure is referred to as the Pet√≥n de Lobo vein system, also 

following the local terminology.   

 

Principal host lithologies are migmatites with textures varying from homogeneous 

holocrystalline to gneissose, with banding parallel to the main shear (N30E) and dark biotitic 

zones fringing granitoid layers. High grade mineralisation consists of grey to bluish quartz 

veins striking N70E to N80E dipping from subvertical to 45¬∞N. These veins contain 

disseminated and stringer arsenopyrite (3% to 10%) enclosed in larger zones of silicification. 

The breccia style of mineralisation also occurs in this area and has the highest grades in the 

entire deposit.

Several silicified zones with quartz veins make up the main vein systems of Cova Crea, 

Pet√≥n de Lobo and at Pozo del Ingl√©s.  The Pet√≥n de Lobo vein system is the eastward 

continuation of the Pozo del Ingl√©s vein system.  The main host rock for mineralisation at 

Pet√≥n de Lobo is the coarse-grained leucocratic gneiss band outcropping in the eastern part of 

the property with mineralisation similar to that at Pozo del Ingl√©s (i.e. a system of 

anostomosed veins included in a wider silicified zone).  Continuity of these zones seems to 

be significant, both vertically and in extension.   

 

To the north of these main systems are the Montefurado, Fontermula and Picotos mineralised 

zones.  These are less well drilled but follow the same structural control and orientation as 

the main zones to the south.   

 

1.4 HISTORY 
 

Gold at Corcoesto was first exploited by the Romans and most recently in the late 1990's and 

early 1990's by mining companies including Sagasta Gold and Aurifera Gallega.  During 

their exploration campaigns, they discovered 28 narrow high-grade gold-bearing structures, 

12 of which became the focus of limited underground mining.  Exploration efforts since that 

time were carried out by Rio Tinto Minera, Rio Narcea Gold Mines and Kinbauri Gold.  

Their efforts focused on defining a bulk tonnage, low grade gold resource, in view of 

potentially developing an open-pit mining operation.  However, no large scale mining has 

occurred at Corcoesto.   

 

In April 2001 an Exploitation Plan was presented by Rio Narcea Gold Mines (RNGM) to the 

Galician mining authorities for a heap leach operation in Corcoesto, and between November 

2002 and May 2003 an aggressive infill program was completed with over 14,000 m of 

drilling completed in 153 holes.  However, the exploitation plan was terminated when 

metallurgical tests showed that the fine‚Äêgrained gold mineralisation encapsulated in quartz 
might not lend itself to profitable heap leaching in combination with low gold prices.   

 

From 2005 to 2008 previous operator Kinbauri Gold Corp (KNB) obtained an option on the 

Property from Rio Narcea and completed a NI 43-101 technical report entitled, "Technical 

Report for the Corcoesto Gold Deposit, Galicia, Spain" dated August 22nd, 2006 by Alan 

Noble, P.E. of Ore Reserves Engineering (ORE).  This report provided an independent 

assessment with regard to the exploration potential, gold resources, and further development 

of the Corcoesto property.   

 

1.5 EXPLORATION 
 

Exploration at Corcoesto by RNGM and KNB consisted of geochemical soils sampling, 

followed by sampling and geologic mapping of surface trenches, followed by diamond 

drilling.  This approach has proven reliable and effective for definition of the mineralised 

zones.  KNB followed this same general procedure, but with improvements such as using a 

smaller grid for soil sampling, which improves the resolution of the soil anomalies, and 

orienting as much of the core as possible, which provides additional data for interpretation of 



 
 

 5 

drill results on cross‚Äêsections.  In addition, KNB commissioned a magnetic geophysical 
survey, but the results of that study were poorly correlated with the gold zones.   

 

Subsequently the best tools for exploration have been soils sampling, trenching, and diamond 

drilling.  As most of the major zones have been identified at the surface, most of the 

remaining exploration will require drilling to deepen the zones and to extend open 

mineralisation to the west and east, as well as down dip.   

 

The majority of the drill holes have been drilled towards the south, except for the Pet√≥n de 

Lobo area where holes were drilled parallel to the Rio Tinto drill holes at an azimuth of 154¬∞ 

(S26E).  Although a NS orientation may have been preferable at Pet√≥n de Lobo, because 

there is a NW trending set of mineralised quartz veins that can be missed with the 154¬∞ 

drilling azimuth, the Rio Tinto drill hole orientation was retained to maintain consistency 

with the old data in the Pet√≥n de Lobo area.   

 

More than 89,552.63 m has been drilled in Corcoesto by four companies, as summarized in 

Table 1.1.  Most of this drilling has been diamond core holes with a small amount of reverse 

circulation (RC) drill holes.  RC drilling was undertaken during the infill program in 2003 

only in those parts of the project where RC twinning of existing core holes had been 

successfully tested in 2002.   

 

A total of 35,435 m in 318 drill holes were completed by the project's previous owners and 

operators.  Since 2010 Edgewater has completed further 53,942.45 m in 286 diamond drill 

holes.  There is currently no field work being conducted on the Corcoesto project.

RNGM made a selection from the Rio Tinto drill hole database, finally determining that 38 of the available 50 

holes had reliable collar surveys and were suitable for resource estimation.   
 

1.6 MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATE 
 

The result of the above work has enabled a revised mineral resource estimate to be generated 

by Micon and used in subsequent ore reserve estimation and mine design and scheduling.   

 

All the zones were assessed in the same manner and models created whereby mineralised 

zones were interpreted by Edgewater geologists, audited by Micon, and 3D wireframes were 

created using CAE Mining Datamine Studio Version 3 (Datamine) software.  Sample data 

was selected and statistical analysis performed to assess the validity of this data for use in the 



 
 

 6 

mineral resource estimation.  Following the generation of mineralised domains, raw sample 

data was composited in order to standardise sample support and further statistical and 

geostatistical analysis was performed with GEOVIA Surpac‚Ñ¢ (Surpac) software on 

composite data to assess grade characteristics and continuity.   

 

Once the orientation and ranges of grade continuity were selected, a wireframe constrained 

block model was generated and grade interpolation into each block was undertaken using OK 

or IDW algorithms as appropriate.  Upon completion of block estimation, the resulting block 

model was validated and density values were assigned based on lithological characteristics 

and oxidisation state prior to reporting the grade and tonnage results.   

 

The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines of The 

Australasian Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 

reserves, The JORC Code, 2012 Edition, a recognized reporting code under the CIM 

Standards.   

 

The block model which formed the basis for the mineral resource model was validated by 

comparison of composite grade data verses block grade data, both visually and on sections 

(decluster analysis, visual assessment of grade, and Swath plot analysis).   

 

To the best knowledge of the authors, the stated mineral resources are not materially affected 

by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, 

political or other relevant issues.  There are no known mining, metallurgical, infrastructure or 

other factors that materially affect this mineral resource estimate.   

 

The final mineral resource estimate, constrained within the conceptual open pit 

(US$1,400/oz) at a 0.5g/t Au cut-off grade, is presented in Table 1.2.  The effective date of 

the Mineral Resource statement contained in this report is 1

 March 2013.

1.7 METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 
 

Metallurgical testwork summarized in the May 2011 NI43-101 Technical Report included 

cyanide leach bottle roll and column tests spanning the years 1998 through 2004 as well as 

optical sorting and magnetic sorting testwork.  This scoping level testwork established the 

amenability of the Corcoesto material to gold recovery by cyanidation, with recovery levels 

exceeding 90%, and identified a correlation between gold recovery and particle size.   

 

The McClelland study (November 2012 NI43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment 

(PEA)) evaluated the amenability of the Corcoesto deposit to gold recovery by gravity 

concentration, flotation, and cyanidation.  Diagnostic leach tests, whole ore cyanidation tests, 

gravity concentration with cyanidation of the tailings, flotation and process simulation testing 

were all conducted.  The process simulation testing consisted of whole ore gravity 

concentration, regrind/flotation of the gravity tails, and cyanidation of the gravity 

concentrate, flotation concentrate and flotation tails.  Gold extraction from the various studies 

approached 90%.   

 

The test work was used to design a plant for the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) 

with processing of the Corcoesto material by the following methodology with an estimated 

overall gold recovery of 89.1%.   

 

ALS Metallurgy (ALS) is currently completing a series of testwork on two master composite 

samples primarily to optimize process variables for plant design and to be used in a 

subsequent variability study.  Work includes primary grind size assessment plus flotation 

reagents, consumption, and residence time for plant design.  Further work includes 

concentrate regrind, variability studies, and CIP gold and silver adsorption.   

 

1.8 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

Gold mineralisation at Corcoesto is located in quartz-arsenopyrite veins and is highly 

structurally controlled by N70E-trending extensional zones.  Exploration has been very 

successful at locating and defining gold resources using a combination of geochemical soils 

sampling, trenching, geologic mapping, and diamond drilling.   

 

Extensive drilling (almost 90,000 m) over a prolonged period of exploration, along with 

surface trenching and historical underground workings, has enabled a comprehensive amount 

of data to be collected and used to establish a mineral resource estimate.   

 

The work undertaken at the Corcoesto Project to date has enabled Micon to report a Mineral 

Resource in accordance with the guidelines of the JORC Code (2012).  Mineralisation and 

the Corcoesto deposit is considered to be amenable to open pit mining.   

 

The primary aim of this report was to present an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the 

Corcoesto Project.  Micon has reported a Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource of 

14.9 Mt at an average grade of 1.34 g/t Au and 9.3 Mt at an average grade of 1.28 g/t 



 
 

 9 

respectively, plus an Inferred Mineral Resource of approximately 5.3 Mt at an average grade 

1.21 g/t Au.   

 

Micon considers the above estimate to convey the tonnage and grade determined to be 

present to date in an appropriate manner and to have been derived using appropriate 

methodologies and protocols.   

 

1.9 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

The mineral resource database is supported by some work completed prior to Edgewater 

acquiring the Corcoesto project.  Review of samples in areas where overlap of previous 

exploration sampling and Edgewater exploration should be undertaken, especially in areas 

where drillholes and trenches intersect and one set of the exploration date has not been 

analyzed.  For completeness in the database the intervals within hydrogeological and 

geotechnical holes which have been identified within mineralised envelopes should be 

assayed, or removed from the database used for future resource estimations.    

 

The mineralised zones included in the current mineral resource estimate are reasonably well 

understood and the strike extents typically known from the current exploration.  However, 

some (areas) remain open, particularly at depth, and subject to continued positive exploration 

may increase the current mineral resource.   

 

Edgewater should consider an infill drilling program in the northern zones of Montefurado, 

where there are currently no Measured and Indicated resources, Fonterremula, where only 

minimal Indicated resource are present, and Picotos (no Measured resources), to improve 

data density and seek conversion into higher category resources.  Additional drilling in the 

main zones (Cova Crea, Pet√≥n de Lobo, and Pozo del Ingl√©s) should also be considered to 

infill low data density areas, and provide increased confidence in some of the peripheral 

areas.  The open ended portions of the currently defined mineralised zones, both along strike 

and down dip, have the potential to expand the current resource subject to positive results.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
 

Micon has reviewed and analyzed data provided by Edgewater, and its consultants, and has 

drawn its own conclusions therefrom, augmented by its direct field examination. Micon has 

not carried out any independent exploration work, excavated trenches, drilled any holes or 

carried out any sampling.  Micon has however, completed a validation exercise and re-

packaged a number of samples for assaying (see Section 12.2.3).   

 

While exercising all reasonable diligence in checking, confirming and testing it, Micon has 

relied upon Edgewater's presentation of the project data and its predecessors and the 

exploration experience at the Corcoesto project in formulating its opinion. 

 

The descriptions of geology, mineralisation and exploration are taken from reports prepared 

by various companies or their contracted consultants. The conclusions of this report rely on 

data available in published and unpublished reports, information supplied by the various 

companies which have conducted exploration on the property, and information supplied by 

Edgewater. Where applicable, the source is noted in the text of this report and a list of 

references is provided in Section 27.0. The information provided to Edgewater was gathered 

by reputable companies and, having reviewed the information, Micon has no reason to doubt

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 

4.1 LOCATION 
 

The Corcoesto deposit is located within the boundaries of the "Ciudad de Masma", "Ciudad 

de Landr√≥" and "Emilita" exploitation concessions (EC), as shown in Figure 4.1. The 

concession descriptions and coordinates for the corners of the overall concession boundary 

are presented in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2, and in Figure 4.2. The concessions are 100% owned 

by Rio Narcea Gold Mines, SL (RNGM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Edgewater, which 

was renamed to Mineira de Corcoesto, S.L. (MDC), on July 20, 2012. These exploitation 

concessions were acquired February 26, 2003, by MDC subsequent to the leasing contract 

initiated May 29, 1996.

The Spanish exploitation concession, which is granted by the Spanish government, provides 

the holder of the concession the right to extract minerals from a specified area.  The 

concession does not grant the surface rights, which must be purchased or leased from the 

surface rights owner.  The exploitation concession is considered senior to the surface rights, 

however, and an unwilling surface rights holder may be forced to relinquish surface rights 

through a condemnation process.  The normal duration of a concession is 30 years, but the 

concessions are renewable for another 30 years.  The original exploitation concessions were 

awarded in 1912 and 1926, and have been renewed several times since then.   

 

The Corcoesto property was surveyed in 2003 by the company INTOPCAR.  They flew the 

area and created a photogrammetric base map with contour lines every 1.0 m.  They also 

conducted on-site surveying work, measuring selected strategic points in UTM coordinates, 

European datum 1950 (HUSO 29).  The property boundaries were not marked in this survey, 



 
 

 17 

but the recognized mineralised zones and exploration efforts are well inside the property 

limits and are not likely to be affected by property boundary issues.  

 

The Corcoesto property is 100% owned by Mineira de Corcoesto, S.L. (MDC), a wholly 

owned subsidiary of Edgewater.  Edgewater and Lundin executed the final and definitive 

Purchase and Sale Agreement on the purchase of Rio Narcea Gold Mines SL (RNGM) from 

Lundin on July 27, 2010.  At that time, the prior owner, Lundin Mining Corporation 

(Lundin), retained a 1.5% Net Smelter Return (NSR) Royalty upon the commencement of 

commercial production from the Corcoesto Gold Project subject to Edgewater having the 

right to re-purchase 1.0% of the royalty at any time after Closing for US$1,000,000.  On 

September 24, 2012 Edgewater sold the right to re-purchase 1.0% of the existing 1.5% NSR 

and created and sold a new 1.0% NSR royalty upon commercial production.  The Corcoesto 

Gold will be subject to a total NSR royalty on commercial production of 2.5%.  There are no 

further royalties on the property, although there is a minimal "surface canon" payment in 

effect that is not a royalty.   

 

Micon understands that Mr. Daniel Roca, of Prat, Roca & Asociados, Abogados, Madrid, 

Spain, in a letter dated September 1, 2010 provided by Edgewater, expresses his opinion with 

regard to property ownership and title of the mining rights.  Based on a title certificate issued 

by the Economy and Industry Department of the Galician Government on 18 August, 2010, 

Mr. Roca concludes that Rio Narcea Gold Mines, S.L. is the titleholder of the Corcoesto 

mining permits.   

 

Title to the property is further confirmed by a certificate, dated February 8th, 2011, from the 

Energy and Mines Service (under the direction of the Conselleria of Economy and Industry) 

of the Territorial Department of A Coruna, Galicia.  This document states that the three 

central mining leases at Corcoesto (Emilita, Ciudad de Landro, and Ciudad de Masma) were 

confirmed and consolidated and their terms defined as 90 years with a start date of August 

10th, 1974 (until August 10th, 2064).   

 

There are no known environmental liabilities on the property; a small amount of water 

emanating from some of the adits should be tested in the future to monitor water quality.   

 

Cultural heritage sites in the area include the Church of San Pedro in Corcoesto, the Torre de 

Corcoesto, the Chapel of Santa Marina, and a prehistoric site known as a "castro" in the area 

of O Castro that are approximately 0.5 km from the known deposits.  Roman pits are 

apparent throughout most of the mineralised zones, but these were not identified as 

significant in previous studies.  With the exception of roman workings associated with the 

mineralised zones, the known cultural sites may be avoided for anticipated exploration and 

development.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

The Corcoesto gold deposit is located in the extreme northwest corner of Spain, within the La 

Coru√±a Province (Galician Community).  It is located approximately 1.5 km east of the small 

village of Corcoesto, approximately 12 km west of the town of Carballo, and approximately 

36 km west-south west of the port city of La Coru√±a as shown in Figure 5 1.  The deposit is 

centred at 43¬∞13'30'' N and 8¬∞49'30'' W (UTM: 514,000 m E, 4,785,000 m N) in the 

municipal district of Cabana de Berganti√±os.

The climate of Galicia are ascribed to two different areas in the K√∂ppen climate 

classification: a south-east area with tendencies to have some summer drought, classified as a 

warm-summer Mediterranean climate, with mild temperatures and rainfall usual throughout 

the year; and the western and northern coastal regions, the provinces of Lugo, A Coru√±a, and 

Pontevedra, which are characterized by their Oceanic climate, with a more uniform 

precipitation distribution along the year, and milder summers.   

 

In the Corcoesto area (Oceanic climate) the winters are cool, with rare frost, while the 

summer months are typically warm but still receiving some rainfall in the order of 30 mm 

during July over a 5 to 6 day period.  Rainfall over the year is around 1,000 mm.  Humidity 

throughout the year is fairly constant at around 77%.  Figure 5.2 is a summary of the climate 

data for Galicia.

The Corcoesto Project lies 10 km east of the Atlantic Coast at elevations ranging from 50 m 

in the north to 250 m in the southwest.  The Anll√≥ns River crosscuts the area from east to 

west and currently represents the northern limit of the Corcoesto property.  The surface of the 

proposed mine site has been used predominantly for commercial harvesting of pine and 

eucalyptus.   

 

The interior of Galicia is a hilly landscape, composed of relatively low mountain ranges, 

usually below 1,000 mASL, rising to 2,000 mASL in the eastern mountains.  Photographs 



 
 

 21 

showing the typical land form and vegetation at Corcoesto are shown by the photographs in 

Figure 5 3 to Figure 5.6.   

 

The Corcoesto region has limited commercial infrastructure, mainly consisting of local 

farming and agricultural activities.  Although there are several small farms within a radius of 

10 km of the project area, the primary targets for exploration and development are not in 

cultivated areas and are largely uninhabited.   

 

The main commercial centres of the region are the town of Carballo, approximately 19 km by 

road from Corcoesto and the city of A Coru√±a which is approximately 58 km by road from 

Corcoesto.  Roads in the area are well developed and the main A55 connects La Coruna to 

Carballo.  Thereafter secondary bitumen roads connect Carballo to Corcoesto.   

 

Two main airports (La Coru√±a and Santiago de Compostela) are located at about 1¬º hour 

driving time from the project via state roads and highways to within 5 km of the project 

itself, where access is then via secondary paved roads having a minimum width of 4 m.  The 

village of Corcoesto consists of small scattered centres of population located west, but 

outside the area to be affected by the planned mining operations.   

 

A 66 kV overhead power line that runs along an east-west route through the Corcoesto 

project area will require relocation during development of the project.

6.0 HISTORY 
 

The pre-2003 historical resource estimates, described in Section 6.0 of this report, were 

prepared according to NI 43‚Äê101 standards; and no qualified person has done sufficient work 
to classify these estimates as current mineral resources. Consequently, these historical 

estimates are not to be regarded as current mineral resources or mineral reserves estimates as 

defined in sections 1.2 and 1.3 of NI 43‚Äê101 (Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects); 
and these estimates are not to be relied upon.  The mineral resource estimates quoted for 

2003, 2010, and 2011, were produced according to NI 43‚Äê101 standards but have been 
superseded by the updated mineral resource estimate presented in Section 14.0.   

 

Interest in the gold of northwest Spain dates back more than 4,000 years although the greatest 

intensity of mining took place between 73 and 217 A.D. during the Roman occupation of the 

region.  After the Roman period, there was no further mining of gold at Corcoesto until 1895 

when an English company 'Sagasta Gold Mines Ltd' began exploitation of the shallower and 

higher grade quartz veins.  It is reported that this company developed about 3,000 m of 

underground workings (adits and shafts) exploiting 12 quartz veins while producing an 

estimated 67.5 kg of gold between 1895 and 1910.   

 

Between 1918 and 1926, the company 'La Aur√≠fera Gallega' investigated quartz veins via 

minor underground workings, although no production was reported during that period.   

 

Several other companies conducted exploration in the area prior to, and during the early 

period of, the involvement of Mineira de Corcoesto (MDC), and made historical estimates of 

resources.  

 

ÔÇ∑ In 1942, the parastatal Instituto Geol√≥gico y Minero (IGM) reported the presence of 
quartz veins with arsenopyrite having thicknesses from <0.25 m up to 1.4 m, and 

lengths between 10 m and 200 m averaging 13.4 g/t Au.  IGM estimated resources of 

255,000 t at 20 g/t Au (164,000 oz of gold) in Corcoesto above the Anll√≥ns River 

level (50 m elevation). 

ÔÇ∑ R√≠o Tinto Pati√±o held the property from 1972 to1973. 

ÔÇ∑ Instituto Geol√≥gico y Minero de Espa√±a (IGME) conducted extensive field work from 
1974 to 1976. 

ÔÇ∑ Goldfields, in 1975, carried out trenching and sampling, and estimated a resource of 
65 Mt at 0.3 g/t Au (600,000 oz of gold) within 100 m of the surface.  

ÔÇ∑ Exploraciones Mineras del Cant√°brico drilled several targets between 1983 and 1987. 

ÔÇ∑ Rio Tinto Minera held the property from 1987 until 1990 and, after acquiring the drill 
hole database from the former owner, continued the drilling program.  In total, IGME 

and Rio Tinto drilled about 10,000 m.  Their resource estimate for the entire deposit 

was 19 Mt at 0.91 g/t Au (550,000 oz).   

 

  



 
 

 24 

The involvement of MDC in the Corcoesto project began in 1996 when all data available 

from Rio Tinto, including reports, maps and drill‚Äêhole data was obtained and entered into a 
Rio Narcea database, and resources were re‚Äêcalculated for the entire Corcoesto project.  The 
MDC estimate at that time was 4.77 Mt at 2.35 g/t Au (360 koz with a 1.00 g/t Au cut-off).     

 

Subsequent to data acquisition, MDC began field reconnaissance and sampling in all 

underground workings and several outcrops. This work was followed by a systematic soil 

geochemistry survey totaling 422 samples taken every 50 m from 11 NW‚ÄêSE lines spaced 
250 m apart.   

 

A detailed trenching program was begun in 1998.  When completed in 2000, this program 

included 142 trenches, 10,538 channel samples, and 17,079 m of trenches.  In addition to 

assay data, the trenching work provided an exceptional opportunity for geologists to study 

the mineralisation.   

 

Concurrent with the trenching program MDC began drilling on three of the major structures, 

called Cova Crea, Pet√≥n de Lobo and Pozo del Ingl√©s.  MDC drilled a total of 1,197.35 m in 

11 drill holes in 1998, a further 927.45 m in 11 drill holes during 1999, and a total of 

1,609.30 m in 37 shallow drill holes in 2000.  The updated resource estimate at the end of 

2000, using this additional trench, adit and drill hole data, was 3.5 Mt of potentially 

open‚Äêpitable material at 1.55 g/t Au (173 koz Au) within those structures.   
 

An Exploitation Plan was presented to the Galician mining authorities in April 2001 for a 

heap leach operation in Corcoesto, and between November 2002 and May 2003 an 

aggressive infill program (25 m x 25 m) was completed with 11,953.40 m of core drilling and 

2,399.30 m of reverse circulation drilling in 153 holes.  Following completion of the infill 

program, a sterilization program was conducted for leach pad placement and 12 holes were 

drilled with 1,108.20 m of core.  The exploitation plan was terminated when metallurgical 

tests showed that the fine‚Äêgrained gold mineralisation encapsulated in quartz might not lend 
itself to profitable heap leaching in combination with low gold prices.   

 

During 2005, Kinbauri Gold Corp (KNB) signed an agreement with MDC to further explore 

the property.  KNB actively explored the project using geochemical sampling, trenching, and 

drilling through 2009 at which time they returned the property to MDC.   

 

From 2005 to 2008 the previous operator, KNB, obtained an option on the Property from Rio 

Narcea and completed a NI 43-101 technical report entitled, "Technical Report for the 

Corcoesto Gold Deposit, Galicia, Spain" dated August 22
nd

 2006 by Alan Noble, P.E. of Ore 

Reserves Engineering (ORE).  The purpose of the 2006 Technical Report was to provide an 

independent assessment with regard to the exploration potential, gold resources, and further 

development of the Corcoesto property.  This report provides a technical summary of the 

exploration and development activities and results, and the currently defined mineral 

resource for the Corcoesto Project.

Initially Edgewater engaged ORE to produce a preliminary mineral resource estimate based 

on data acquired prior to 2010.  Edgewater then completed an additional 12,000 m drilling 

program and published a NI 43-101 compliant resource estimate on the Corcoesto project in 

2011.  The 2011 mineral resource estimate was based on 42,111.18 m of diamond and RC 

drilling in 342 holes as well as surface trenching and adit sampling data.   

 

The mineral resource estimate for Corcoesto has been refined over time and has been subject 

to several iterations.  A summary of the historical mineral resource estimates are summarised 

in Table 6.1.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALISATION 
 

7.1 GEOLOGY 
 

The Corcoesto gold deposit lies in a N30E‚Äêtrending dextral shear band, about 2 km wide, 
within an antiformal structure in the northwest part of the Schistose Domain of Galicia‚ÄêTras 
Os Montes (SDGTM), as shown in Figure 7.1.  The SDGTM represents the basement within 

the Galicia‚ÄêTras Os Montes Zone (GTMZ) in the Iberian Hercynian Massif.  The SDGTM is 
a medium grade metamorphic unit, strongly deformed with recumbent folds and thrust faults.  

It consists of metasediments (phyllites, graywackes, quartzites and cherts) of Precambrian to 

Devonian age, and orthogneisses derived from Hercynian granites and migmatites.   

 

Although Hercynian metamorphism has produced abundant migmatitic rocks in the area, 

there are end members that can be classified as metasedimentary rocks, mostly biotitic 

schists.  Paragneiss is also found, which is similar to the biotitic schist, but which contains 

both strong schistosity and gneissose texture.   

 

Igneous rocks in the Corcoesto area are related to synkinematic granites that were deformed 

during late stages of formation and are attributed to mesocrustal anatexis.  Metamorphism 

deformed these rocks generating a strongly foliated or banded gneissose texture.  These rocks 

are classified as biotitic gneiss and leucocratic gneiss.   

 

ÔÇ∑ Biotitic Gneiss: Rock unit made up of quartz, feldspar and mica (biotite predominant) 
with texture varying from homogeneous holocrystalline to gneissose banded.  These 

units appear mostly in the central-western part of the project, in Pozo del Ingl√©s and 

West Cova Crea fingering into paragneiss units.  

 

ÔÇ∑ Leucocratic Gneiss: Rock unit made up of quartz, feldspar and mica (muscovite 
predominant) with a strongly foliated and deformed texture. 

 

Biotitic gneisses and paragneisses are grouped and classified as migmatitic rocks in the 

geologic map of Corcoesto and appear west of the leucocratic gneisses and in the eastern 

parts of the project area, as shown in Figure 7.2.  Two main leucocratic gneisses, separated 

with a schistose zone, are disposed in bands trending N30E in the eastern part of the project 

and are the host rock for mineralisation in the Cova Crea East and Pet√≥n de Lobo areas.   

 

Late stage felsitic dykes of a few metres thick by hundreds of metres long intrude the 

gneisses in several places.  These dykes have intruded previous structures such as foliation 

(N30E) and fractures (N70E or N70W).  The texture is porphyritic with pale cream to green 

cryptocrystalline matrix.  Mineralogy is mainly plagioclase with millimetric quartz crystals 

and locally disseminated crystals of pyrite.  These dykes cut mineralised quartz veins 

indicating they are late stage rocks, and may locally remobilize some gold from mineralised 

zones.

 29 

7.2 MINERALISATION 
 

Gold mineralisation at Corcoesto is related to the extensional zones trending N70E which 

represent second order dextral shears within the main (first order) N30E Malpica-Noia 

dextral shear band.  Higher-grade gold mineralisation is related to arsenopyrite-bearing 

quartz veins, which are frequently included in larger zones of silicification that commonly 

contain disseminated arsenopyrite in association with sericitic and potassic alteration.  These 

veins are present in several styles which are for the most part dependent upon the host rock 

type:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Sheeted vein style: Sheeted veins develop primarily in fine-grained leucocratic 
orthogneiss that is present in the Cova Crea East and Pet√≥n de Lobo areas.  They 

typically consist of a system of very tightly spaced millimetre quartz veins oriented 

around N70W with disseminated arsenopyrite.   

 

ÔÇ∑ Quartz vein style: This style of mineralisation consists of grey to bluish arsenopyrite-
bearing quartz veins parallel to extensional zones (N70E).  They are common in 

Corcoesto lithologies, including coarse-grained leucocratic gneisses, biotitic gneisses, 

paragneisses and schists.  Mineralised veins hosted in the schists are less continuous 

compared to the veins hosted in the rest of the lithologies.  The quartz veins are 

included in larger zones of silicification, which commonly contain disseminated 

arsenopyrite, with sericite and potassic alteration.  Where silica replacement is very 

intense, however, it may be difficult to establish a boundary between the vein and 

wall-rock silicification.  

 

ÔÇ∑ Breccia style: This style of mineralisation consists of clasts of brecciated host rock 
that have been cemented and partially replaced by grey to bluish arsenopyrite bearing 

quartz.  The original host rock is normally biotitic gneiss.  This type of mineralisation 

is not very common in the deposit, but appears in the westernmost part of Pozo del 

Ingl√©s and may carry high-gold grade. 

 

Gold mineralisation is located in the paragneiss and schists units in east-northeast trending 

mineralised zones consisting of quartz veins and breccia zones associated with arsenopyrite.  

The mineralised zones consist of numerous, subparallel veins and veinlets that are arranged 

in an anastomosing pattern.  The Corcoesto gold deposit is made up of several vein systems, 

all of which trend in a northeasterly direction, as shown in Figure 7.2.   

 

The southernmost vein system is the Cova Crea vein system.  The northeast part of the 

structure, hosted in the fine-grained orthogneiss band consists of sheeted veins.  To the 

southwest, the Cova Crea system is hosted in migmatites, biotitic gneiss and paragneiss.  

Narrow quartz veins with disseminated arsenopyrite in wider zones of silicification, are 

predominant.  Typical Cova Crea mineralisation is shown in Figure 7.3 (Section 3885), 

where it is mostly sheeted veins with a thick low-grade zone (between 1.5 g/t Au and 2.0 g/t 

Au) that includes a higher grade core (>3.0 g/t Au).  The structure has been drilled along 



 
 

 30 

strike for at least 500 m and to a vertical depth of 200 m and the mineralisation remains open 

to the west and at depth.    

 
Figure 7.3  

Cross-section 3885, showing typical Cova Crea mineralisation 

 

 
 

The most significant mineralised structure in the Corcoesto gold deposit, is a N70E trending 

structure in the central area of the deposit, that cross-cuts all of the N30E trending lithologic 

units.  The central and west part of this structure has been named the Pozo del Ingl√©s vein 

system following the local terminology for old underground workings in the area.  The 

easternmost part of the structure is called the Pet√≥n de Lobo vein system, again following 

local terminology.   

 

Pozo del Ingl√©s shows the highest and most continuous gold grades in the Corcoesto deposit, 

particularly between sections 3460E and 3860E.  Predominant host lithologies are migmatites 

that have textures varying from homogeneous holocrystalline to gneissose, with banding 

parallel to the main shear (N30E) and dark biotitic zones fringing granitoid layers.  High-

grade mineralisation consists of grey to bluish quartz veins striking N70-80E dipping from 

sub-vertical to 45N.  These veins contain disseminated and stringer arsenopyrite (3% to 10%) 

enclosed in larger zones of silicification.  The breccia style of mineralisation also occurs in 

this area and has the highest grades in the entire deposit.   

 



 
 

 31 

The Pozo del Ingl√©s vein system is displaced over 50 m along strike by a WNW-trending, 

vertical dextral fault (the "Longitudinal Fault") into which a late-stage microcrystalline pale 

green dike has intruded, as shown in Figure 7.4.  Although gold mineralisation does not 

appear to be associated this dyke, it does contain up to 10% disseminated pyrite.   

 

Several silicified zones with quartz veins make up the main vein system at Pozo del Ingl√©s.  

The footwall zone (PI20) has the highest grades and best continuity of the Pozo del Ingl√©s 

Zones comprising a tight system of anastomosing veins rather than a single vein.  The 

faulted-off portion of this zone on the south-west of the "Longitudinal Fault" is called Zone 

PI-20W and the portion in the north-east side is called Zone PI-20F.  Although the zone 

seems to be the same on both sides, the sides are named independently for purposes of 

resource estimation.   

 

The Pet√≥n de Lobo vein system is the eastward continuation of the Pozo del Ingl√©s vein 

system.  The main host rock for mineralisation at Pet√≥n de Lobo is a coarse-grained 

leucocratic gneiss band outcropping in the eastern part of the property with mineralisation 

similar to that at Pozo del Ingl√©s (i.e. a system of anastomosed veins included in a wider 

silicified zone).  Continuity of these zones seems to be significant both, vertically and in 

extension, as shown in Figure 7.5 and Figure 7.6.   

 

The northern part of the property was investigated by RNGM with a soil geochemistry 

survey and subsequent trenching over the main soil anomalies and limited shallow diamond 

drilling.  Encouraging results from the RNGM drilling and from trenches that had not been 

tested by drilling, led KNB to conduct a much more detailed soil geochemistry survey 

covering the areas north of Pozo del Ingl√©s and Pet√≥n de Lobo up to the property boundary.  

Subsequent to that, 19 trenches (681 m) were dug and channel sampled, defining new drilling 

targets, four of which were drilled early in 2006.  Two of the drill holes, 06K15 and 06K21, 

intersected shallow zones that returned up to 5.0 g/t Au over 5.25 m and 2.72 g/t Au over 

5.35 m respectively.   

 

Whilst the Montefurado, Fonterenula and Picotos zones are less well drilled than the main 

zones summarised above they retain similar characteristics. Recent drilling completed by 

Edgewater in these Northern Zones has confirmed that the geology, mineralisation, and 

structure are largely similar to the main zones to the south.   

 

These northern zones are hosted in a sequence of medium grade metamorphic rocks 

contained within a N30E trending dextral shear band dipping 70¬∞ to the NW.  Lithologies 

include; biotite gneiss, leucocratic gneiss, with lesser amounts of biotitic schists and 

paragneiss, as well as minor sediments.  Mineralisation is not limited by lithology and the 

lithologies are extensions of the same units which host the Main Zones to the south.  As with 

the Main Zones the Northern Zones are in places cut by late stage felsic dykes.  

Mineralisation is identical to the Main Zones consisting of quartz veins with arsenopyrite and 

native gold.  As with the main zones the quartz veins can vary from discrete veins, to 

stockworks, as well as brecciated veins.  In some cases the Northern Zones may show coarser 

arsenopyrite as well as more common, but still rare, visible gold.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 

8.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Gold mineralisation in Corcoesto is related to the extensional zones trending N70E which 

represent second order dextral shears within the main (first order) N30E Malpica‚ÄêNoia 
dextral shear band.  Higher‚Äêgrade gold mineralisation is related to arsenopyrite‚Äêbearing 
quartz veins, which are frequently included in larger zones of silicification that commonly 

contain disseminated arsenopyrite hosted within sericitic and potassic alteration.  These veins 

are present in several styles which are for the most part dependent upon the host rock type.   

 

8.2 SHEETED VEIN STYLE 
 

Sheeted veins develop primarily in fine‚Äêgrained leucocratic orthogneiss that is present in the 
Cova Crea and Pet√≥n de Lobo areas.  They typically consist of a system of very tightly 

spaced millimetre quartz veins oriented N80W to N70W with disseminated arsenopyrite.  

The sheeted vein style may develop mineralised zones over a thickness up to 40 m, with 

grades between 1.0 g/t Au and 2.0 g/t Au including a higher grade core between 3.0 g/t Au 

and 4.0 g/t Au.  Arsenic content of the sheeted vein mineralised zones is relatively low, 

between 0.5% and 1.0%.  The zone shows silicification, potassic alteration and strong 

muscovitization replacing biotite.   

 

8.3 QUARTZ VEIN STYLE 
 

This style of mineralisation consists of grey to bluish arsenopyrite‚Äêbearing quartz veins 
parallel to extensional zones (N70E).  They are common in Corcoesto lithologies, including 

coarse‚Äêgrained leucocratic gneiss, biotitic gneiss, paragneiss and schists.  Mineralised veins 
hosted in the schists are less continuous compared to the veins hosted in the rest of the 

lithologies.  The quartz veins are included in larger zones of silicification that commonly 

contain disseminated arsenopyrite, with sericite and potassic alteration.  Where silica 

replacement is very intense, however, it may be difficult to establish a boundary between the 

vein and wall‚Äêrock silicification.   
 

Gold grade in a weakly silicified alteration is normally between 0.2 g/t Au and 1.0 g/t Au, 

even in cases of relatively high arsenopyrite content (above 5%), but increases slightly with 

increased silicification.  The thickness of the individual high‚Äêgrade quartz veins inside the 
silicified zones does not exceed 1.0 m, and is normally <0.5 m.  Initial observations 

suggested that gold grade was associated to the thickness and number of the quartz veins, 

plus the intensity of silicification.  However further statistical studies, based on available 

data, have shown that there is in fact relatively poor correlation between quartz and Au 

mineralisation (see Section 14.3.2).  Notwithstanding, sub‚Äêparallel veins contained in a 
silicified zone may yield intercepts up to 12.21 g/t Au over 9.0 m (8.2 g/t Au over 14.1 m), as 

in diamond drill hole (DDH) COR169 in section 3660 at Pozo del Ingl√©s.  Arsenic content in 

these zones is generally higher than that in the sheeted veins, and is normally >1% As.  Some 

of the highest gold grades in the deposit are found in this type of mineralisation in the central 



 
 

 36 

and westernmost part of Pozo del Ingl√©s.  A selective sample of arsenopyrite bearing quartz 

vein from DDH COR169 (Pozo del Ingl√©s), interval 66.0 m to 67.0 m, returned 63.5 g/t Au 

(>3.9% As) whilst another from DDH 10W10 (from 171.2 m to 172.3 m) returned 148.5 g/t 

Au and 3.9%.    

 

However, visible gold is not common, even when the gold grade is very high.   

 

8.4 BRECCIA STYLE 
 

This style of mineralisation consists of clasts of brecciated host rock that have been cemented 

and partially replaced by grey to bluish arsenopyrite bearing quartz.  The original host rock is 

normally biotitic gneiss.  This type of mineralisation is not very common in the deposit and 

only appears in the westernmost part of Pozo del Ingl√©s.  However, where encountered, may 

carry high‚Äêgold grade, such as the 46 g/t Au over 1.0 m interval in DDH 05K2 (8% As) and 
the 38 g/t Au (5% As) over 1.0 m interval in DDH COR98.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 

Modern exploration commenced in the 1970's when R√≠o Tinto Pati√±o initially held the 

property for a short period before Instituto Geol√≥gico y Minero de Espa√±a (IGME) 

completed a mapping exercise with sampling and a soil geochemistry program (1974 to 

1976).  This more extensive work discovered new anomalies beyond those previously 

identified by old workings.  In 1975 Goldfields completed a trenching and sampling exercise 

in order to determine an independent shallow mineral resource estimate of 65 Mt at 0.3 g/t 

Au, to a depth of 100 m.   

 

There was then a hiatus until 1987 when Rio Tinto Minera held the property until 1990.  

After acquiring the drill hole database from the former owner they continued the drilling 

program, and with IGME completed almost 10,000 m in 50 holes (average depth 200 m), 

including deep holes (to a maximum depth of 746.5 m).  This work culminated in a mineral 

resource estimate of 19 Mt at 0.91 g/t Au.   

 

The involvement of Rio Narcea Gold Mines SL (RNGM) began in 1996 when all data 

available from Rio Tinto was obtained and introduced into a Rio Narcea database, and 

resources were re-calculated.  The RNGM estimate at the time was 4.77 Mt at 2.35g Au/t 

(1.0 g Au/t cut off).   

 

In 1998 RNGM conducted a soil geochemistry survey at a line spacing of 250 m, oriented 

NW-SE, and sample spacing of 50 m.  That survey indicated stronger soil anomalies in the 

southern areas of the property (Cova Crea, Pet√≥n de Lobo and Pozo del Ingl√©s), which is 

where RNGM focused most of its efforts for trenching and drilling.  RNGM drilled 12 

condemnation holes in 2003 under soil anomalies of the northern areas, however these 

intersected some good mineralisation up to 5.62 g/t Au over 4.5 m (DDH COR217) in the 

Montefurado vein system.   

 

Based on this indication of potential for new discoveries of mineralisation in the northern 

part of the property, Kinbauri Gold Corp (KNB) drilled 4 exploration holes over RNGM soil 

anomalies in mid-2005.  The best hole intersected 2.09 g/t Au over 5.75 m in the 

Montefurado vein system.   

 

Later in 2005, KNB conducted a detailed soil geochemistry survey covering the northern 

areas, with N-S orientation lines spaced at 75 m and samples spaced at 25 m.  KNB surveyed 

one E-W base line, in 6100 northing coordinate.  The soil samples weighed between 0.5 kg 

and 1.0 kg and were taken at a depth of 20 cm, normally in the organic soil horizon.  KNB 

collected one duplicate sample every 20 samples.  The samples were assayed for gold plus 34 

additional elements using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) at Activation 

Laboratories Ltd. at Ancaster, Ontario.  In 2006 KNB extended the geochemistry survey to 

cover the entire property.  The contoured results for gold and arsenic are shown in Figure 9.1 

and Figure 9.2.   

 



 
 

 38 

Early in 2006, KNB dug 18 trenches (681 m) over the most significant soil anomalies and 

drilled 4 holes in the most promising structures.  Two of these holes intersected the 

mineralised zones at depth with good gold values.  DDH 06K15, located in the west part of 

the Picotos vein system, intersected 1.53 g/t Au over 8.9 m, starting at 26 m, and 5.0 g/t Au 

over 5.25 m, starting at 54.9 m.  The contoured soil geochemistry anomaly over these 

mineralised structures is more than 700 m long.  DDH 06K21, located between Picotos and 

Fonterremula vein systems, intersected 2.72 g/t Au over 5.35 m, starting at 37.40 m.  DDH 

COR219, located 160 m to the west of 06K21, intersected 6.37 g/t Au over 1.5 m, starting at 

18 m.  The soil geochemistry anomaly over this structure is more than 600 m long and the 

anomaly over Montefurado vein system is more than 500 m.   

 

In 2006 KNB carried out a magnetometer survey over the property, with lines every 75 m, 

matching the lines of the soil geochemistry survey, and readings every 12.5 m.  Except for a 

false anomaly attributed to a power line, there are no significant anomalies, of which there 

are two that run approximately E-W across the project area.  Variations of the magnetic 

field's total intensity range between 45456 and 45519 nT (disregarding the values associated 

with the power line).  The anomalies are scattered, lacking any substantial lateral continuity.  

Most of these anomalies are concentrated in a strip that crosses through the survey area 

approximately in a N30¬∫E direction.  They are located west of a fine grained phase of the 

gneiss in all area underlain by intercalations of metasediments, mostly biotitic schists and 

biotitic gneisses.  The results of the magnetometer survey are shown in Figure 9.3.

10.0 DRILLING 
 

10.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

In total over 90,000 m has been drilled on the Corcoesto property by four operators, as 

summarized in Table 10.1, with Edgewater completing around 60% of the drilled metres to 

date.  Most of this drilling has been diamond core holes with a small amount of reverse 

circulation (RC) drill holes.  RC drilling was undertaken during the infill program in 2003 

only in those parts of the project where RC twinning of existing core holes had been 

successfully tested in 2002.

RNGM made a selection from the Rio Tinto drill hole database, finally determining that 38 of the available 50 

holes had reliable collar surveys and were suitable for resource estimation.   
 

Most holes were drilled towards the south for most of the project, as shown in Figure 10.1, 

except for the Pet√≥n de Lobo area where holes were drilled parallel to the Rio Tinto drill 

holes at an azimuth of 154¬∞ (S26E).  Although a NS orientation may have been preferable at 

Pet√≥n de Lobo, because there is a NW trending set of mineralised quartz veins that can be 

missed with the 154¬∞ drilling azimuth, the Rio Tinto drill hole orientation was retained to 

maintain consistency with the old data in the Pet√≥n de Lobo area.   

 

Surface drill holes generally dip between 45¬∞ and 60¬∞ to the south.  A small number of 

underground drill holes were also completed and included in the database.   

 

RNGM brought all Rio Tinto core from storage in southern Spain to Corcoesto for relogging 

and checking.  Some old drill holes could still be located in the field, and collar locations for 

those holes were confirmed through re-surveying by RNGM staff.  While some of those not 

surveyed by the RNGM staff were considered reliable and were included in the RNGM 

database, all drill holes with doubtful locations were eliminated.  A total of 38 holes (from 

the drilled 50) were added to the drill hole database from the Rio Tinto data.

Most of the RNGM drilling was conducted early in 2003, as part of the infill program for a 

proposed open pit, heap-leach operation.  Almost 13,000 m of drilling was conducted in less 

than 4 months.  After that, over 2,000 m were drilled for condemnation in the northern areas 

of the property.  General results of the infill program confirmed the expected tonnage and 

grade for the deposit, although the gold grades were unexpectedly higher in some areas and 

lower in others.  However, the RC drilling completed by RNGM proved unreliable and this 

method was not repeated at Corcoesto (see Section 11.3.4).   

 

For the Cova Crea vein system, results were quite homogeneous and predictable for the 

sheeted vein mineralisation hosted in the fine grained orthogneiss which is located in the 

eastern part of Cova Crea system.  To the west, the mineralisation turned into a more 

discontinuous system of quartz veins, as shown in Figure 10.2.   

 

Drilling at Pozo del Ingl√©s has defined a complex system of gold mineralisation in quartz 

veins, as shown in mineralisation with good grades and continuity, as shown in Figure 10.3. 

 

An oblique (northwest-southeast) section through Pet√≥n de Lobo is presented in Figure 10.4 

(view looking northeast) that again shows the high density of drilling and elevated Au grades 

through this southern zone.   

 

The less well drilled northern zones are summarised in Figure 10.5 with a north-south section 

(513,770E) through Picotos.   

 

In 2005, KNB focused most of the drilling in the Pozo del Ingl√©s area (8 holes) to test high 

gold grades at depth.  In 2006, KNB drilled 3 deep holes at Pozo del Ingl√©s, 2 deep holes at 

Pet√≥n de Lobo and 4 shallow holes over soil anomalies in the northern areas.  KNB drilled 8 

holes in 2007, of which 3 were at Pozo del Ingl√©s, 3 at Cova Crea, and 2 at Monte Furado.  

The KNB deep holes at Pozo del Ingl√©s confirmed some high-grade shoots for more than 

300 m down dip in the footwall mineralised zone.   

 

KNB's procedures for drilling, logging and sampling have been the same as for RNGM.  A 

significant difference is that the core has been orientated when possible, thus, defining the 

real strike and dip of joints, veins, foliation, and other features.  This information has proven 

very helpful in the interpretation geology and mineralisation on cross sections.   

 

In 2010 through February 2013, Edgewater continued drilling at Corcoesto.  This drilling 

focused on extending mineralisation at depth and laterally on the Pozo del Ingl√©s, Cova Crea, 

and Pet√≥n de Lobo deposit with the aim of improving the Measured and Indicated mineral 

resources at Corcoesto.  The Edgewater drilling generally follows the same methods and 

procedures as were used by RNGM and KNB.

10.2 DIAMOND DRILLING PROCEDURES 
 

Drill hole collar locations are determined with a total station.  Collar verification is 

completed by plotting hole locations on plan and in cross-section and comparing with 

topographic surface.  Down hole surveys are verified against the original survey data and on 

cross-section plots.  The majority of the diamond drill holes have been completed with HQ 

diameter drilling equipment (producing 63.5 mm diameter core), though typically start with 

116 mm diameter (PQ) equipment through the superficial material and initial weathered 

zone.  During the Edgewater exploration period (2010 to 2013), diamond core drilling was 

conducted under contract with Sondeos y Perforaciones Industriales del Bierzo (SPIB) and 

Terratec, see Figure 10.6.  Once drilling is complete a concrete plinth, with a metal plaque, is 

installed at the collar.   

 
Figure 10.6  

Diamond Core Drilling at Corcoesto and Drill Core Handling (17th January 2013) 

 

  
 

10.2.1 Drill Hole Surveying 
 

All drill hole collar coordinates were surveyed by a total station with the surveyor checking 

most collar locations with high precision GPS in the areas with good coverage.  Down-hole 

deviation was measured using FLEXIT equipment which takes a survey at a programmed 

depth, giving the azimuth, inclination and global magnetic field, or the current down hole 



 
 

 50 

system which is MAXIBOR which systematically takes readings every 3.0 m giving azimuth 

and inclination.   

 

It should be noted that all collar and surface surveying is conducted in the Universal 

Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system but that these are simplified for use in the 

database with the subtraction of 510,000 m from the eastings and 4,780,000 m from the 

northings; an example is summarised in Table 10.2.

10.2.2 Core Handling and Storage 
 

Drilling crews extract the drill core, place in wooden core boxes, then seal the boxes with 

tape or straps prior to transport.  The core was then collected by Edgewater technicians and 

transported by truck to one of Edgewater's core processing facilities where geological and 

geotechnical logging is carried out (Figure 10.7).  The wooden core boxes are marked with 

wood blocks and labelled appropriately (Figure 10.8).

Example of DDH Core Labelling (EDW10W10) 

 

 
 

On arrival at the core processing facility, the core is laid out, washed and photographed.  The 

core is then logged, and sample intervals marked by Edgewater geologists.  Sample intervals 

are generally between 1.0 m and 2.0 m; however, variations were allowed for special samples 

or special interval breaks, Table 10.3 summarises the sample length distribution. The 

maximum sample interval in the database is 16.13 m (400 ppb Au) and the minimum is 

0.15 m (70 ppb Au), though only 241 out of the 50,207 (with Au grade) are <1.0 m and 850 

are >2.0 m (of these 139 are ‚â•300 ppb).  Gold grades show no correlation with sample 

length, Figure 10.9 shows the correlation between sample length and Au grade and the 

overwhelming quantity of samples between 1.0 m and 2.0m in length.

Core logging includes recovery, lithology, alteration, mineral zone (with number of and 

thickness of quartz veins), structural and geotechnical logging.  Structural and geotechnical 

detailed were noted, included foliation, fractures, vein orientation, and faults.  Wherever 

possible, oriented core samples were taken to give more accurate structural readings.  Core 

recovery (%) and RQD measurements were measured and calculated for all drill intervals.   

 

Core reception, handling and logging follows Edgewater operational procedures, guidelines 

and standards.   

 

After logging, the mineralised core is cut in half using a diamond impregnated cutting saw, 

where one half of the core is retained for further studies and audit purposes, and the other 

half is submitted for sample preparation and analysis.  To the extent possible, core was cut 

perpendicular to major vein orientations.   

 

Facilities for drill core storage consist of several warehouses in and around the project site.  

These also serve as storage for coarse rejects and pulp samples.  Pulp samples are contained 

in paper envelopes and stored in plastic bags, while the coarse rejects are stored in plastic 

bags.  All are well organized, clean, and the entire system catalogued for easy location and 

identification.  Edgewater also has a certain number of historical core and samples from 

previous operators stored at these facilities.   

 



 
 

 53 

10.2.3 Core Recovery 
 

Drill core recovery measurements have been collected by Edgewater staff on each diamond 

drill hole drilled since 2010, though no recovery data are available for the historical Rio 

Tinto drill holes.  Fresh rocks in the area typically provide 100% recovery in core drill holes, 

and although recovery drops in the weathered portions, it easily remains above 85%, 

averaging above 96.5% for the entire diamond core holes where data are available.  Such 

intervals are generally marked during drilling and checked later by the geology personnel for 

depth accuracy and missing sections.   

 

Despite the amount of old underground workings in the area, only 2 holes have encountered 

the workings.   

 

Micon has completed a study on the core recovery data from the drilling campaigns 

completed at Corcoesto (no Rio Tinto data).  It is noted that core recovery has not been 

recorded for all samples.  The analysis shows that for the majority of samples (92.5%) the 

core recovery is >90% (Figure 10.10).  Almost 99% of the samples have a core recovery of 

‚â•50%, and 89.9% of the samples record a recovery of ‚â•95%.   

 
Figure 10.10  

Histogram of Core Recovery 

 

 
 



 
 

 54 

To test for any possible bias in the resultant gold grades Micon has plotted a scatter plot 

showing recovery (%) versus gold grade (ppb Au).  Micon has copied out of the database all 

samples with gold grades greater than 300 ppb Au (0.3 g/t Au), and core recoveries of <60% 

(Figure 10.11).   

 
Figure 10.11  

Core Recovery (<60%) verses Au Grade (>300ppb) 

 

 
 

The lowest core recovery, with significant gold grade, is from drill hole 11W52 (13.55 m to 

15.75 m) with 6.82% recovery and assay vales of 6,490 ppb Au and 1,010 ppm As.  

However, the majority of sample intervals with <60% core recovery and <300 ppb Au come 

from historical drill holes, completed prior to Edgewater, and from the shallower depths 

(Figure 10.12), i.e. within the more friable weathered zone.   

 
  



 
 

 55 

Figure 10.12  

Core Recovery (<60%) verses Depth (m) 

 

 
 

Micon has concluded that while a number of high-grade intersections have been recorded for 

samples with low recovery, there is potential for low recoveries to report lower grades.  It is 

possible this could be related to the loss of fines during the drilling process as a result of 

friable mineralised material.  However, it is not believed that these factors will have a 

detrimental effect to the final mineral resource estimate.   

 

10.2.4 Core Logging 
 

All core logging has been carried out by Edgewater geologists using customized log sheets 

for drill core logging.  The information is then entered into the electronic database.  The 

geologists record the major code for lithology, alteration, mineralisation, and textural 

characteristic.   

 

After measuring the recovery, all selected samples are labelled with a unique code, e.g.; 

12W20518500.  Each sample (interval) is described, detailing geological features, lithology 



 
 

 56 

is assigned a defined code, also notes are taken of foliation, schistosity, orientation and 

thickness of veins, and an estimate is made of the gold grade.   

 

The data are entered manually into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, and a sheet is generated 

for each drill hole.  Basic information is included such as: from, to and recovery of samples, 

sample code, the geological description and the code of this description plus data such as 

section, zone, start date, end date, and the drilling company that drilled the hole etc.   

 

When the assay result of the drill hole is received the results (Au and As) are entered and 

cross-checked with anticipated results for any discrepancies.  Should any discrepancy arise 

the geologist refers back to the log and drill core for clarification and amendments made as 

deemed appropriate.   

 

As part of the core logging process the core is prepared for cutting with a diamond saw and 

subsequent sample preparation.  The samples are marked on the core box using a red arrow 

in the direction of sampling, with the start marked with INCIO (BEGINNING), and the word 

FIN (END) at the end of the sample.  In mineralised zones, where quartz veins are identified, 

the geologist draws a line with a marker along the core, perpendicular to the quartz veins, 

that is used as a guide along which the core must be sawn.   

 

Edgewater then places the cut core samples into sample trays for transfer to sample 

preparation (Section 11.3.7).   

 

10.3 MICON OPINION 
 

In the opinion of Micon, the quantity and quality of the lithological, geotechnical, collar and 

downhole survey data collected in the exploration and infill drill programs are sufficient to 

support Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation as follows:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Drill hole spacing varies with depth.  Average drill hole spacing in the main zones is 
about 40 m.  Drill hole spacing increases with depth as the number of holes decrease 

and holes deviate;  

ÔÇ∑ Core logging performed by RNGM/Edgewater staff meets industry standards for gold 
exploration;  

ÔÇ∑ Collar surveys since 2003 have been performed using industry-standard 
instrumentation and by the same surveyor;  

ÔÇ∑ Down hole surveys performed after 2003 were performed using industry-standard 
instrumentation;  

ÔÇ∑ Recovery data from core drilling programs is acceptable;  

ÔÇ∑ Geotechnical logging of drill core meets industry standards for a planned open pit 
operation;  

ÔÇ∑ Drilling is normally perpendicular to the strike of the mineralisation.  Depending on 
the dip of the drill hole, and the dip of the mineralisation, drill intercept widths are 

typically greater than true widths;  



 
 

 57 

ÔÇ∑ Drill orientations are generally appropriate for the mineralisation style, and have been 
drilled at orientations that are optimal for the orientation of mineralisation for the 

bulk of the deposit areas;   

ÔÇ∑ Drill orientations, shown in Figure 10.2 to Figure 10.5 inclusive, are considered to 
appropriately test the mineralisation.  The sections display typical drill hole 

orientations for the deposits, show summary assay values using colour ranges for 

assay intervals that include areas of no mineralisation and very low grade 

mineralisation, and outline areas where higher-grade intercepts can be identified 

within lower-grade sections;  

ÔÇ∑ No factors were identified with the data collection from the drill programs that could 
affect mineral resource or ore reserve estimation.   

 

 



 
 

 58 

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 

11.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

All sampling for the RNGM and KNB drilling programs was done by employees of RNGM.  

None of those persons were senior employees or directors of either RNGM or Kinbauri.  

Sample preparation was done using industry-standard practices and procedures that were 

developed in consultation with Ore Reserves Engineering (ORE).   

 

The Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Materiales de Asturias (ITMA) laboratory in Oviedo, Spain, 

which has assayed the RNGM in-fill drilling and all of the Kinbauri drilling, is certified for 

gold under UNEEN ISO/IEC 17025, since 1999.  During the Kinbauri drilling, one sample in 

every 20 samples was sent to ALS Chemex (ALS) as a duplicate.  In addition, ITMA 

routinely assays 2 duplicate samples, 1 standard, and a certified standard in each batch of 30 

fire assays.  Assays were a 30 g fire assay with atomic absorption (AA) finish.   

 

The Inspectorate laboratory in Reno, Nevada, USA, which assayed the RNGM exploration 

drilling samples, was not certified at the time of the drilling.  During the RNGM 

investigation, check assays were not routinely taken during drilling, but the assays were 

verified as part of several check assay programs that were done later.   

 

All of Edgewater's drill core samples from the drilling campaigns, which started in October 

2010, have been sent to the ALS preparation laboratory located in Seville, Spain.  From 

there, 110 g of the pulp is sent to ALS Romania (laboratory in Rosia Montana) to be 

analyzed for gold, whilst 10 g of each sample is sent to ALS Canada (Vancouver) for As 

analysis.  Both laboratories have the certificate of ISO/IEC 17025:2005.  Assay sample size 

comprise 50 g fire assay for Au and 10 g acid digestion for As.   

 

Although the Corcoesto deposit has a small, but significant coarse-gold component that 

makes assaying difficult at grades below 1.0 g/t Au, it was the opinion of ORE that the 

Corcoesto assays are reliable for purposes of mineral resource and ore reserve estimation.  

This is mitigated by the preparation of a 1 kg coarse sample split sent to ALS for further 

preparation and analysis.  Producing a representative sub-sample for geochemical analysis is 

critical.  A 2 kg to 10 kg drill core sample may be completely crushed to a particle size 

greater >1 mm, and a split taken for fine grinding.  The traditional split size of 250 g falls on 

Gy's Sampling Safety Curve and is suitable for many base metal, and rare earth, deposits 

where the ore minerals and commodity elements occur homogenously at this sample size.  

However, for gold (and other precious metals), a minimum split size of 1 kg (as prepared by 

Edgewater) is advised as it falls well within the "safe zone" for sample representivity.  This 

initial pulp split is the most crucial when sampling, and the laboratory split (fire assay charge 

weight) has less effect on the quality of the sub-sample.   

 

Micon has completed a check analysis to independently corroborate a selection of assay 

results (see Section 12.1).   

 



 
 

 59 

11.2 DENSITY DETERMINATION 
 

The densities of geological materials encountered in drill core are required to determine mass 

in the mineral resource estimation.  Density data must be representative of the lithologies 

found in the deposit and determined on replicate samples.   

 

Edgewater has routinely measured the specific gravity (SG) of diamond core samples 

through application of the classical Archimedean method based on weighing the sample in 

air (natural moisture content), submerged in water, and subsequently the core sample 

weighed after drying.  Based on the sample weight (natural and dry) and sample weight in 

water, the density of the material is calculated through a mathematical equation (see below).  

Measurements are taken in both mineralised and barren units according to standard 

procedures summarised below:  

 

1. Samples are selected based on geological criteria.  Density measurements are 
collected for all lithologies on the Project, including mineralised material, barren rock 

and overburden.   

2. In the sections previously selected by the geologist, the half sawn drill core is marked 
in the core box with a black arrow noting the depth of the sample in the drill hole 

upon which the density determination will be completed.  The core box is labeled 

with the word DENSIDAD and the sample is marked with the from and to and the 

drill hole number.   

3. This data (drill hole, sample #, from, and to) together with the date of the density 
determination, lithology with a short description, lithological code, and oxidation 

state are recorded on a paper log form.   

4. The sample is weighed (Natural weight), after which the sample is completely 
submerged in water, for this a bucket with a channel has been prepared (Submerged 

weight).   

5. The sample is then placed in an oven to dry at 90¬∞C for 12 hours.   
6. After drying the sample is weighed again (Dry Weight).  The sample is returned to 

the appropriate place in the original core box.   

7. The data collected is entered into the appropriate column of the density sheet in an 
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for the drill hole and the density is calculated using the 

following formula: Density = Dry Weight / (Wet Weight ‚Äì Submerged Weight)   

8. All of the density data are entered into the master density Excel spreadsheet, used to 
calculated average densities for each lithology.  The master spreadsheet is updated for 

each drilling campaign.   

 

SG was determined by cleaning the sample, weighing it when the surface of the sample is dry 

and then weighing it submerged in water.  The fresh rock samples are not dried prior to the 

procedure, because of the very low porosity and permeability in the bedrock.   

 

  



 
 

 60 

SG is then estimated as follows:  

 

SG = 
xD 

 
(xA ‚Äì xW) 

where: 

xD = weight of core after drying 

xA = weight of core in air (natural) 

xW = weight of core completely submerged in water 

 

At Corcoesto density has been measured on approximately 1,000 samples collected across 

the deposit, from 231 drill holes.  Edgewater distinguish between rock types as well as 

between fresh and oxidized rock in core samples and thus results for both, where available, 

are recorded for each rock type.   

 

Density determinations for the different rock types according to the geological model are 

summarised in Table 11.1.

A total of 990 specific gravity samples have been measured by Edgewater and this data has 

been used to generate a scatter plot in order to understand the relationship between gold 

grade and specific gravity.  The plots for both oxidised (115 samples) and fresh (875 

samples) material is shown in Figures 11.1 and 11.2 respectively.  The plots indicate that 

there is no significant relationship between the gold grade and specific gravity.

11.3 SAMPLE PREPARATION PROCEDURES 
 

11.3.1 RNGM Trenches 
 

RNGM trenches, and those excavated by KNB, were sampled using channel samples 10 cm 

wide by 3 cm deep and 1.0 m to 2.0 m long, depending on the mineralisation.  The weight of 

the samples was approximately 6.0 kg per metre sampled.  The trench samples are believed 

to be reliable, although there is a possibility the grade of the trench samples may be biased 

because of surface weathering effects.  The amount of any such bias, if it exists, is believed 

to be small and should not have a material effect on the resource estimate.   

 

The evaluation of gold content was conducted on samples obtained from channel samples of 

approximately 6.0 kg.  The samples were taken to the company's El Valle laboratory where 

the preparation procedure was as follows:  

 

1. Drying and weigh 
2. Jaw crush to nominal 6.0 mm 
3. Roll mill (95% <2.0 mm) 
4. Split with riffle (550 g to 650 g sub-sample).  Keep the reject 
5. Pulverize with LM1 or LM2 (95% <200 mesh or 0.074 mm) 
6. Split manually (100 g).  Keep the reject 
7. Send 100 g to the assay laboratory 

 

11.3.2 Exploration Core Holes 
 

Prior to the infill program RNGM drilled 59 exploration core drill holes (3,734.10 m), mostly 

HQ (63.5 mm) diameter or larger.  After logging, the core was then taken entirely to the El 

Valle preparation laboratory for the following procedure:   

 

1. Diamond saw into halves 
2. Dry and weigh 
3. Jaw crush to nominal 6.0 mm 
4. Pulverize with LM5 (95% <0.425 mm) 
5. Split automatically with ESSA (700 g to 750 g).  Keep the reject 
6. Pulverize with LM2 (95% <0.074 mm) 
7. Manually split 100 g for fire assay.  Keep the reject 

 

11.3.3 Infill Program Core Holes 
 

During the first half of 2003, 121 diamond drill holes (11,953.40 m of core) were drilled by 

RNGM for the infill program with diamond drill holes cored with HQ or larger (63.5 mm).  

The initial preparation before pulverizing was conducted in the Corcoesto laboratory before 

the samples were taken to the El Valle facility for pulverizing and assay.   

 

  



 
 

 63 

The procedure was as follows:  

 

1. Diamond saw core into halves 
2. Dry and weigh 
3. Jaw crush to nominal 6.0 mm 
4. Roll mill or Boyd Crusher (95% <2.0 mm).  Roll mill was used for larger samples 

(about 2.0 m long) taken from barren zones and Boyd Crusher which is more accurate 

method was used for smaller samples (about 1 m long), usually from ore zones 

5. Split 3.2 kg with riffle if roll mill was used in previous step, or with a rotary sample 
divider connected to the Boyd Crusher 

6. Pulverize in LM5 (95% <0.425 mm). 
7. Split automatically with ESSA (700 g to 750 g). Keep the reject. 
8. Pulverize with LM2 (95% <0.074 mm) 
9. Manually split out two bags. One of 100g for fire assay and one of 250g for 

Leachwell assay.  Keep the reject 

 

11.3.4 Infill Program RC Drill Holes 
 

RNGM also completed a program of RC drilling (infill program).  The sample interval was 

2.0 m long by 4

/4 inch diameter.  Drillers split the sample into halves at the rig site so 

that the sample size (weight) taken to the preparation laboratory was between 25 kg and 

30 kg per sample (original samples circa 60 kg).   

 

Again, the first steps of preparation prior to pulverizing were conducted at the Corcoesto 

facility.  The full procedure was as follows:  

 

1. Dry and weigh. 
2. Roll mill (95% <2.0 mm) 
3. Split with riffle (3.2 kg) 
4. LM5 (95% <0.425 mm) 
5. Split automatically with ESSA (700 g ‚Äì 750 g).  Keep the reject. 
6. Pulverize with LM2 (95% <0.074 mm) 
7. Manually split out two bags: One of 100 g for fire assay and one of 250 g for 

Leachwell assay.  Keep the reject 

 

However, investigation of RC drill results indicated that the method was not reliable at 

Corcoesto, particularly if there was any significant water flow, and RC drilling was only used 

for limited drilling in the Pozo del Ingl√©s area.  Those RC holes included in the drill hole 

database for mineral resource estimation are from areas will little water ingress and are 

believed to be reliable.

11.3.5 Kinbauri Trench Samples 
 

Kinbauri completed 681 m of trenching in 2006 from 32 trenches and processed 276 samples 

for analysis.  Trench samples were collect using the same procedures as was used for RNGM 

trenches.  The sample preparation procedure for Kinbauri trench samples was as follows:  

 

1. Dry and weigh. 
2. Jaw crusher to nominal 6.0 mm 
3. Roll mill (95% <2.0 mm) 
4. Split with riffle (550 g to 650 g). Keep the reject 
5. Pulverize with LM1 or LM2 (95% <200 mesh or 0.074 mm) 
6. Split manually (106 g). Keep the reject 
7. Send 106 g to the ITMA assay laboratory 

 

11.3.6 Kinbauri Core Holes 
 

Sampling of the Kinbauri core drill holes was similar to the procedure for RNGM exploration 

holes, as follows:   

 

1. Diamond saw into halves 
2. Dry and weigh 
3. Jaw crush to nominal 6.0 mm 
4. Pulverize with LM5 (95% <0.425 mm) 
5. Split automatically with ESSA (450 g to 550 g).  Keep the reject 
6. Pulverize with LM2 (95% <0.074 mm) 
7. Manually split 106 g and send to ITMA for fire assay.  Keep the reject 

 

11.3.7 Edgewater Core Holes 
 

Following on from the core logging, where the samples are marked, the geologist enters the 

codes of these samples into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet from which sample labels are 

printed as required.  These labels include a unique sample bar code that is often referred to a 

Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), alternatively a Laboratory Information 

System (LIS) or Laboratory Management System (LMS).  This system also provides an 

electronic sample submittal form.   

 

Sampling of the Edgewater core holes followed a similar process to the procedures used in 

previous programs, summarised as follows:  

 

1. Diamond saw into hales and place into metal tray 
2. Dry (placed into oven for 8 to 12 hours at 90¬∞C) and weight 
3. Jaw crush to nominal 10 mm (crusher cleaned between samples with sterile material, 

originally with silica but more recently with amphibolite from a nearby quarry) 

4. Boyd Crusher (80 % <2.0 mm): granulometric test after every 20 samples 
5. Split 1.0 Kg with an automated rotary sample divider.  Keep the reject 



 
 

 65 

6. Send 1.0 Kg to ALS preparation laboratory in Seville, Spain (see below) 
7. Pulverize in LM2 (85% <75¬µm) 
8. Manually Split (120 g) and send (110 g) to ALS Romania for fire assay and (10 g) 

sent to ALS Vancouver for acid digestion.  Store rejects 

 

ALS receive the 1 kg samples which are logged in with the electronic bar codes before 

undergoing sample preparation according to ALS procedure PREP-31 (crush to 70% 

<2.0 mm, riffle split off 250 g, pulverize to better than 85% passing 75 ¬µm). 

 

Edgewater has used ALS for all of its primary gold determination, analysis code Au-AA26 

(50 g nominal sample weight, Au determination by Fire Assay and AAS finish, detection 

range 0.01 ppm to 100 ppm).   

 

11.4 RNGM SAMPLE PREPARATION STUDY 
 

While the average values from the different laboratories were quite similar, a large variability 

was noticed between the duplicate assays, the relative standard deviation of the difference 

between duplicate assays ranged from 37% to nearly 100%.  Because this variability may 

indicate coarse gold and/or other sampling issues, ORE was contracted to conduct a study to 

evaluate the sampling characteristics of the gold mineralisation using the Gy theory of 

sampling (Noble, 1999).  The most important results of this study were as follows: 

 

1. Abundant gold particles were recovered from the test samples by gravity 
concentration.  The largest particle measured 2 mm by 1 mm.  It was very difficult to 

recover the gold in a hand-panned gravity concentrate, however, because of abundant 

arsenopyrite in the concentrate.  

2. The size of gold particles appeared to be independent of gold grade.  This implied that 
splitting errors increase rapidly as gold grade decreases.  Thus, to maintain a 25% 

splitting error at 0.5 ppm gold, a 250 g assay aliquot is required, but only 125 g is 

required at 1.0 ppm gold, and 65 g is sufficient at 2.0 ppm gold. 

 

The Corcoesto sampling behavior is consistent with mineralisation in which gold grade is 

primarily dependent on the size and number of quartz veins in a sample and the gold grade 

and the size of gold particles in the veins is independent of size the veins.   

 

Based on further experience with duplicate assays and metallurgical tests of Corcoesto 

samples, ORE believed that only a small fraction (5% to 15%) of the gold is larger than 

100 ¬µm, which is the size that is coarse enough to affect the reliability of a 1-assay ton (30 g) 

fire assay.  When a coarse gold particle is present in the assayed sample, however, it tends to 

be so large that the assay of that sample may be 2 to 10 times higher grade than a duplicate of 

the same sample.  This problem is particularly significant when the assayed sample has either 

low grade or small weight.  Thus, a small number of pulp duplicates may have a very good 

correlation because there are not enough samples to have encountered a nugget.   

 



 
 

 66 

Based on the sample preparation study, the sample preparation protocol was modified to 

provide a higher degree of accuracy at the low grades expected for an open pit operation.  In 

addition, before the 2003 diamond drilling program was started, a Boyd crusher was 

purchased to implement the first stage of crushing.   

 

11.4.1 RNGM Check Assays 
 

RNGM assayed samples at the Inspectorate laboratory in Reno, Nevada, USA, for all trench 

sampling and for drilling through April 1999.  The ITMA laboratory in Oviedo, Asturias, 

Spain, was used for RNGM drilling from 2000 through 2003.  Check assays for the 

Inspectorate and ITMA assays were done at the RNGM laboratory at the El Valle mine.  In 

addition, a significant number of internal duplicate assays were completed by Inspectorate.  

The results of these check assays, as shown in Figures 11.3 through 11.5, show that the 

various laboratories are generally comparable, although the RNGM assays tend to be slightly 

higher than those of the two other laboratories.  Although all data show a high degree of 

scatter, there is more scatter in the Inspectorate assays than in assays from the other 

laboratories.  The reasons for this are not well understood, but may be related to the larger 

assay aliquot (50 g) at Inspectorate, compared to the 30 g assay aliquot at the ITMA and 

RNGM laboratories.

11.4.2 Leachwell Assaying Studies 
 

Based on the sampling study, it was determined that a 250 g assay aliquot would be required 

for the most accurate grade control in the 0.5 g/t Au to 1.0 g/t Au range.  Since a fire assay 

would not be practical for grade control, a program was started to evaluate a cyanide leach 

with larger samples.  The Leachwell reagent was used to increase the gold dissolution rate so 

that complete dissolution of gold was accomplished in two hours.  The cyanide-soluble gold 

assay would be followed by a fire assay of the residue until a reliable relationship between 

cyanide-soluble and total gold was developed.   Assaying was to be done at the ITMA 

facility using procedures developed by Mineral Process Control (the manufacturer of the 

Leachwell reagent) of Sydney, Australia, and the RNGM El Valle laboratory.   

 

After the initial Leachwell assays were completed, it was apparent that the total of the 

cyanide-soluble gold plus the residual gold by fire assay was running about 10% lower than 

the direct fire assay.  Accordingly, an intensive study was done to compare the ITMA 

Leachwell and direct fire assays.  The Inspectorate laboratory was used for the fire assay 

comparisons.  The Genalysis laboratory in Sydney, Australia, was used for both fire assay 

and Leachwell assay comparisons.  The results of this study, as summarized in Table 11.2 

and Table 11.3, show that the problem is in the ITMA Leachwell procedure, and that the 

ITMA fire assay is reliable.  In addition, the Leachwell procedure is demonstrated as an 

effective, reliable assay if done by a qualified laboratory using proper procedures.  Further 

testing is recommended to develop reliable Leachwell procedures at the ITMA laboratory 

and for grade control at the mine.

11.5 KINBAURI CHECK ASSAYS 
 

During the Kinbauri drilling program one check assay for every 20 samples was sent to the 

ALS Chemex laboratory in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.  Internal laboratory control was done 

at ITMA by assaying 2 duplicates, 1 blank, and 1 standard within each batch of 30 samples.   

 

Check assays were available from the period 2005 through 2007 as internal duplicate assays 

at ITMA, blind duplicate assays at ITMA, and external duplicate assays at the ALS Chemex 

laboratory.  The results of these tests, as shown in Figure 11.6 through Figure 11.9, indicate 

that the ITMA laboratory is unbiased with respect to Chemex.  Variability among the paired 

assays is as expected, except for the ITMA blind duplicates which show less variability than 

would be expected.  The low variability is most likely due to the small number of samples.   

 

Also available are a small number of screen-metallic assays that were done on samples with 

suspected visible gold.  These assays, as shown in Figure 11.9, indicate a small, but 

statistically insignificant bias in the ITMA assays relative to the screen-metallic assays.  

Although only 6% of the total gold reported to the +100 ¬µm mesh screen, the original sample 

undoubtedly contained more coarse gold, since the coarser gold particles found in Corcoesto 

samples have been shown to break into smaller particles during fine grinding in a pulverizing 

mill.  In addition, some of the larger particles roll into cylinders that are approximately 

50 ¬µm in diameter and 200 ¬µm long, and those particles may pass through a +100 ¬µm screen.

11.6 EDGEWATER CHECK ASSAYS 
 

11.6.1 Edgewater Internal QC 
 

The Edgewater internal quality control program involved the submission of a selection of 

blind duplicates and blanks to the laboratory for analysis.  During the Edgewater drilling 

campaign work included internal check assays that consist of one duplicate and one blank 

every 20 samples sent to ALS.  Edgewater has not included any CRM samples into the 

sample stream.  Blanks have been prepared using waste material from the project (gneiss), 

which in some cases may contain low levels of As, but is considered to be barren in Au.   

 

A summary of the number of samples generated by Edgewater and sent to ALS for analysis 

is presented in Table 11.4.   

 
Table 11.4  

Summary of Edgewater Samples Assayed by ALS (Internal QC)

Total 4,620 100 6,825 100 15,420 100 260 100 

 

Whilst standard practice is to insert a duplicate and blank every 20
th

 sample if a sample is 

believed (by the geologist) to be high grade an additional duplicate may also be taken.  

Results of duplicate analysis are analysed by way of a scatter plot (Figure 11.10 through 

Figure 11.17).  Where discrepancies are identified the geological log is reviewed along with 

drill core and if required the laboratory is requested to check the results.  If the inconsistency 

continues a split sample is sent to a second, and if required third, laboratory (external control) 

until resolved.  If considerable variation exists with regards to duplicate sample results within 

a batch it is reported to the laboratory and repeat analysis is conducted for the entire batch.   

 

With duplicate data, and where the values for Au are ‚â•500 ppb, the average value for both 

Au and As is inserted into the database.   

 

Blank sample results are also plotted on a control chart (Figures 11.12, 11.15, and 11.18) 

with each sample identified over time, or within batches.  If it is found that a blank sample 

has an elevated Au value, the geologist reviews the drill core to check for visible 

mineralisation.  Should the review detect mineralisation, the value of the blank is validated, 

after having checked that the rest of the blanks in that shipment give the expected results for 

a blank.  If no mineralisation is observed the laboratory is requested to repeat analysis on two 

samples either side of the blank, along with the blank itself, in order to validate.  If the blank 

sample continues to give an anomalously high value, results for the batch are annulled and 

new samples are prepared from the coarse rejects for reanalysis.   

 



 
 

 73 

While an effort was made to collect barren material it was not uncommon for these samples 

to have a small amount of disseminated arsenopyrite, and this is reflected in the assays.  For 

all assays which returned more elevated levels of arsenic and/or gold a closer visual 

inspection was made of the drill core to ensure the values looked reasonable.

11.6.2 Edgewater External QC 
 

During the recent period of Edgewater exploration (2010 and 2012) there has also been a 

limited amount of external QC sampling whereby a selection of samples in three batches 

were sent to OMAC for cross checking.   

 

Edgewater selected random samples for external check analysis at OMAC Laboratories Ltd. 

(OMAC), Ireland, as well as one batch to AGQ Mining & Bioenergy S.L., Burguillos, Seville 

(AGQ), as summarised in Table 11.5.   

 
Table 11.5

Duplicates 0 0 4 0 1 6 

Blanks 0 0 0 0 0 6 

Total 88 31 285 277 266 120 

 

A total of 947 samples, in three batches (Batch 1 = 119 samples; Batch 2 = 562 samples; and 

Batch 3 = 266 samples), were dispatched from the end of October 2010 until July 2012 to 

OMAC.  A further 120 samples were sent to AGQ in 2012.   

 

Both Au and As analysis was conducted and the resultant direct plots of original (ALS) 

verses OMAC results are presented in Figures 11.19 through Figure 11.24, and for AGQ in 

Figures 11.25 and 11.26.   

 

It should be noted that the final sample preparation at AGQ differs from that applied at ALS 

and OMAC.  At ALS/OMAC the 1 kg crushed sample is pulverized to 85% passing 75 ¬µm 

and a 150 g (manual) spilt sample produced, 140 g is sent for Au analysis whilst the 

remaining 10 g is used for As analysis.  At AGQ the 1 kg sample is pulverized to 90% 

passing 80 ¬µm and riffle split to produce a 125 g sub-sample with 50 g for Au analysis and 

10 g for As analysis.   

 

Notwithstanding the above comment, the results of this external check analysis show that 

overall there is good repeatability in both Au and As analysis.

11.7 MICON QUALITY CONTROL CHECK ANALYSIS 
 

11.7.1 Edgewater Internal Duplicate QC Analysis 
 

Micon has reviewed the Edgewater internal QC duplicate data (2010, 2011, and 1012) and 

paired assays were sorted into grade classes with the average mean and average absolute 

error from the mean calculated for each grade class.  The results as presented in Table 11.6 

and the relationship between class average grade and average absolute error is presented in 

Figure 11.27.   

 

The data shows that analytical errors are greatest at the lower end of the range.  For original 

assays 0.2 g/t Au to 0.39 g/t Au the average error is 10%, whilst <0.19 g/t Au the error rises 

to almost 20%.  On average an assay near the projected cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t Au could 

indicate grades between 0.27 g/t Au and 0.33 g/t Au.  Although some paired results 

demonstrate significant errors, particularly in the limited QC data (83 sample pairs) for 2010, 

overall the data compares well.  However, the number of samples assayed within the average 

grade of the deposit is low, and the data are heavily skewed with 70% of the samples being 

<0.39 g/t Au.  Only 16.3% of the samples occur within 0.4 g/t Au and 2.49 g/t Au, and only 

3.4% (44 sample pairs) within 1.0 g/t Au and 1.49 g/t Au/.

It is apparent from Figure 11.28 that, on average, the repeat assays produced higher results 

for values below 1.0 g/t Au.  In Figure 11.29 repeat assays are plotted against original gold 

assays.  Higher errors are evident for the lowest grade samples (<0.2 g/t Au).  However, the 

overwhelming bulk of the quality control samples (‚âà70%) assayed <0.4 g/t Au.

Figure 11.30 illustrates the Thompson‚ÄìHowarth (TH) precision plot of the laboratory in 

repeating the analysis of the same pulp sample.  To produce the plot the mean paired samples 

was calculated and the absolute error of the mean calculated.  The plot shows that 97.5% of 

the sample pairs have an error of less than 50% (66.5% of the sample pairs have an error of 

<10%) and that 50% of the data produced an error of 5.3% or less, and thus has reasonable 

repeatability that improves in the higher grades, albeit with fewer sample pairs.  As expected 

the greatest errors are attributed to the lower grade sample bins.  The disproportionate 

number of sample pairs (>70%) in the lower grade range (<0.39 g/t Au), highlighted in Table 

11.6 and Figure 11.27, produce this slightly skewed result and elevated error.

11.7.2 Edgewater External Duplicate QC Analysis 
 

Micon has reviewed the Edgewater external QC data (2010, 2011, and 2012) in more detail 

and paired assays were sorted into grade classes with the average mean and average absolute 

error from the mean calculated for each grade class.  It should be noted that the AGQ data 

was omitted from this analysis as the final sample preparation is not identical to that followed 

by ALS and OMAC.  The results as presented in Table 11.7 and the relationship between 

class average grade and average absolute error is presented in Figure 11.31.   

 



 
 

 89 

The data shows that analytical errors are typically greatest at the lower end of the range 

though the results show the greatest error of 57% for the 0.8 g/t Au to 0.99 g/t Au sample bin.  

However, the number of samples in the lower end of the sample set is low, the 0.8 g/t Au to 

0.99 g/t Au bin only contains 12 samples, or 1.3 % of the data set.  It is not uncommon for 

greater errors to correspond with the lower grade range, and for a low data set, both of these 

factors combined can amplify the error.  Conversely, the grade range of 1.0 g/t Au to 4.99 g/t 

Au contains 508 samples, almost 54% of the data set, and compares very well with a 

relatively low (<15%) mean error.  Overall the result of this check analysis is considered 

acceptable.

Analytical Error by Class for Edgewater External Duplicate Sample Analysis 

(Classes as per Table 11.7) 

 

 
 

It is apparent from Table 11.7 and Figure 11.32 that, on average, the repeat assays produced 

higher results for values below 4.99 g/t Au.  In Figure 11.33 repeat assays are plotted against 

original gold assays.  Higher errors (outliers) are evident through the data set.  However, the 

overwhelming bulk of the quality control samples (>65%) assayed >1.5 g/t Au, as can be 

seen from the increased density of samples plotted above this grade, and generally show 

fewer outliers.

Figure 11.34 illustrates the Thompson‚ÄìHowarth (TH) precision plot of the laboratories in 

repeating the analysis of the same sample.  To produce the plot the mean paired samples was 

calculated and the absolute error of the mean calculated.  The plot shows that 94.4% of the 

sample pairs have an error of less than 50% (54.2% of the sample pairs have an error of 

<10%) and that 50% of the data produced an error of 8.9% or less, and although slightly 

elevated has reasonable repeatability that improves in the higher grades.  As expected the 

greatest errors are attributed to the lower grade sample bins.  The disproportionate number of 

sample pairs (>65%) in the higher grade range (>1.5 g/t Au), highlighted in Table 11.7 and 

Figure 11.31, are clearly evident and produce this slightly skewed result.   

 
Figure 11.34  

Correlation Plot for Paired External Quality Control Assays 

 

 
 

11.8 MISCLASSIFICATION PLOTS 
 

These plots use a cut-off grade (COG) of 0.3 g/t Au, as used to determine mineralised 

wireframes for both polygonal and 3D resource modelling.  In order to create the plots and 

undertake this assessment the dataset is sorted into three groups:  

 

1. Sample pairs with both pairs above the COG grade, samples with "ore grades"; 
2. Sample pairs with both pairs below the COG grade, samples with "waste grades"; and 



 
 

 93 

3. Sample pairs with one value above/below COG, one sample of either "ore or waste 
grade". 

 

The third sample set represents the 'misclassified' values and the number of misclassified 

samples can then be established.  The most likely cause of misclassification is due to 

unrepresentative sample selection or contamination within the sample preparation stages.   

 

Misclassified samples can have an adverse effect on mineral resource estimation with sample 

data included, or excluded, from the data set.  Any sample falling into this category should be 

re-assayed to verify the result, or at the very least checked, before being included into the 

final database.   

 

Analysis of the 1,288 duplicate samples has revealed that there are only 29 misclassified 

samples at the wireframe COG of 0.3 g/t Au.  However, most of these show the duplicate 

sample result to be higher than the original value recorded.  This is graphically shown in 

Figure 11.35.   

 
Figure 11.35  

Misclassification Plot at 0.3 g/t Au 

 

 
 



 
 

 94 

Although the number of misclassified samples is very low, and not considered to have any 

significant impact to the mineral resource modelling, any sample categorized as being 

misclassified should be checked and re-assayed as a standard procedure to minimize any 

potential errors in initial wireframe generation and subsequent mineral resource estimation.   

 

11.9 SAMPLE SECURITY 
 

Edgewater exploration drilling since 2010 was completed by two drilling contractors, with 

Edgewater in-house staff providing the technical input and supervision.  During this period a 

number of mineral resource estimates were generated by Alan Noble of ORE, most recently 

in November 2011.   

 

Drill core was kept at the drill rig until transferred to the core processing facility at the end of 

each shift.  The core was logged, photographed and sawn at this facility as well as samples 

being prepared by Edgewater before being shipped to ALS laboratory in Seville.  During this 

time access to the samples was restricted to only drill crews, supervisors and project staff.   

 

Since completing the drill program in early 2013 Edgewater has now moved some of the 

core, and sample duplicates, to a new larger storage facility at the Poligono Industrial units, 

Ponteceso.  All storage facilities remain under lock and key and are accessible to Edgewater 

staff only.   

 

Micon considers the analytical protocol and sample security used during the major drilling 

campaigns since 2010 sufficient to allow the estimation of mineral resource estimates from 

the data collected, meeting acceptable mining industry standards.   

 

11.10 QUALITY OF SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 
 

Whilst Edgewater has not included Certified Reference Material (CRM), or standard 

samples, within its own sample batches this has been mitigated by the internal QAQC 

undertaken by ALS Chemex who have inserted their own QAQC samples and provided 

Edgewater with the results.   

 

The quality of duplicate sample analysis is very good with excellent repeatability 

demonstrated since 2010 from the Edgewater analysis and the level of QC regarding 

duplicate samples is considered acceptable.  However, duplicates only provide support to the 

level of precision of the laboratory and not the accuracy.  In order to test the accuracy of the 

laboratory good quality standards, or CRM, from a reputable supplier, or well established in-

house standards, should be inserted into each sample batch.  Standards used should also 

reflect the higher and lower grade populations identified within the deposit and should be the 

responsibility of the geology department.   

 

The blank material used by Edgewater has been prepared from waste material sourced from 

the project (gneiss), which in some cases may contain low levels of arsenic, but is considered 



 
 

 95 

by Edgewater to be barren in gold.  Blank samples are included to ensure that no background 

drift occurs at the laboratory and that no gross contamination is taking place.   

 

Blank samples are typically analysed by plotting 'failure charts' showing blank sample 

values plotted against a failure line at three times the detection limit (or established 

background level).  A second method is available by generating 'smear charts' by plotting 

the blank samples paired with the samples directly preceding them.  Furthermore, if assays 

on field blanks exceed three times the detection limit, then automatic re-assaying of samples 

surrounding the blank sample in the batch should be conducted.   

 

A total of 1,115 blank sample analyses were determined by Edgewater during their 

campaigns on the Corcoesto project.  The lower detection limit for gold by the fire assay (AA 

finish) method is 0.01 g/t Au.  However, results do demonstrate a number of returned values 

equal to or in excess of the 0.03 g/t Au failure limit (three times detection limit) as 

summarised in Table 11.8.

2011 321 48 14.9 0.26 

2010 80 14 17.5 0.10 

 

The results for 2010, 2011, and 2012, show figures of 83.5%, 85.1%, and 91.5% passing for 

the respective years.  These results are substandard; though show some improvement in 

succeeding years as the number of samples submitted also increases.   

 

A total of 130 blank samples were recognizably contaminated (out of 1,115); as indicated by 

elevated levels of Au in excess of 3 times the detection limit.  The blank samples show that 

there were some sporadic instances of minor Au mineralisation in samples considered barren 

which are most likely due to weakly mineralised quartz veinlets and not due to contamination 

during sample preparation, i.e. there is no evidence of systematic problems.  Furthermore 

these contamination levels and frequency pose only a minor risk to the mineral resource 

estimate.  This is further supported by the blank sample analysis conducted by ALS.   

 

Edgewater review all results and should any anomaly be observed this is examined in detail 

and resolved accordingly.  Out of all assay results only one has been amended following 

subsequent reanalysis.  A similar process is followed for 'blank' material whereby the As 

level is also reviewed as part of the verification process.  Whilst there is no direct correlation 

with Au content elevated levels of As do generally indicate a presence of Au and it is now 

accepted, upon examination, that the gneiss does contain rare quartz stringers that can 

contain low levels of Au mineralisation.   

 



 
 

 96 

Erratic values could be due to contamination during the core cutting and sample preparation 

procedures.  Equally the gneiss material itself warrants further investigation as the number of 

failures is too high to be considered a reliable 'blank' material.  The latter is now considered 

the most likely case as As levels are also often elevated in the Au 'failures' suggesting the 

presence of mineralised quartz stringers.  Nevertheless the level of failures is considered 

unacceptable and future blank samples should be sourced from an alternative and more 

reliable source.  

 

As part of its internal QC protocol, ALS also includes its own internal QC samples and 

analysed blank samples.  The result of this blank sample analysis is presented in Figure 

11.36.  Note that returned values of <0.01 g/t Au (minimum detection limit) are represented 

on the plot as 0.00 g/t Au.  Only two values out of 699 samples analysed returned results 

>0.01 g/t Au and so demonstrate an excellent performance with respect to their internal 

procedures and analytical techniques with no failures and 100% passing.   

 

Blank sample analysis provides a good indication of the quality of sample management and 

contamination in the sample preparation process.  However, and on the basis of this review, it 

is suspected that the gneiss material used by Edgewater does sometimes contain background 

gold mineralisation and that further use of this material should be stopped until a full 

assessment can be conducted with regards to its suitability for use as a blank material.   

 

Notwithstanding the above comments, it is the opinion of Micon that the quality of sample 

preparation, assaying, and security at Corcoesto is satisfactory and that the results obtained 

are suitable for the estimation of mineral resource in accordance with the guidelines of the 

JORC Code (2012).

11.11 CONCLUSION, RECOMMENDATIONS AND RISK ANALYSIS 
 

11.11.1 Conclusion 
 

Micon is of the opinion that the sampling methods are acceptable, meet industry standard 

practice, and are acceptable for mineral resource and ore reserve estimation and mine 

planning purposes, based on the following:   

 

ÔÇ∑ Geochemical sampling covered sufficient area and was adequately spaced to generate 
first-order geochemical anomalies, and thus was representative of first pass 

exploration sampling;  

ÔÇ∑ Drill sampling has been adequately spaced to first define gold anomalies to initially 
produce prospect-scale and subsequent deposit-scale drill data;  

ÔÇ∑ Data are collected following industry standard sampling protocols;  

ÔÇ∑ Sample collection and handling of RC drill cuttings and core was undertaken in 
accordance with industry standard practices, with procedures to limit potential sample 

losses and sampling biases;   

ÔÇ∑ Sample interval in core drilling is typically between 1.0 m and 2.0 m, and considered 
to be adequately representative of the true thicknesses of mineralisation.  Not all drill 

material is sampled depending on location and mineralisation;   

ÔÇ∑ Sample preparation for samples that support Mineral Resource estimation has largely 
followed a similar procedure since 2003.  The preparation procedure is in line with 

industry-standard methods for gold deposits;   

ÔÇ∑ All samples have been analyzed by independent laboratories using industry-standard 
methods for gold, and arsenic analysis;   

ÔÇ∑ Specific gravity determination procedures are consistent with industry-standard 
procedures.  There are sufficient acceptable specific gravity determinations to support 

the specific gravity values utilized in the mineral resource and ore reserve estimation;  

ÔÇ∑ There is limited information available on the QAQC employed for the earliest drill 
program (Rio Tinto 1987 ‚Äì 1990), however, sufficient programs of reanalysis have 

been performed that the data selected from this program can be accepted for use in 

estimation;  

ÔÇ∑ Typically, drill programs included insertion of blank and duplicate samples.  The 
QAQC program results do not indicate any major problems with the analytical 

programs, therefore the Au, and As analyses are suitable for inclusion in mineral 

resource and ore reserve estimation.  Internal CRM analysis by ALS has also gone 

some way to support the validation of analysis;   

ÔÇ∑ Verification is performed on all digitally-collected data on upload to the main 
database, and includes checks on surveys, collar coordinates, lithology data, and 

assay data.  The checks are appropriate, and consistent with industry standards;  

ÔÇ∑ Sample security has relied upon the fact that the samples were always attended or 
locked in the on-site sample preparation facility.  Chain-of-custody procedures 

consist of filling out sample submittal forms that are sent to the laboratory with 

sample shipments to make certain that all samples are received by the laboratory; and 



 
 

 
99 

ÔÇ∑ Current sample storage procedures and storage areas are consistent with industry 
standards.   

 

11.11.2 Recommendations 
 

QAQC procedures should be reviewed, with particular attention being paid to the inclusion 

of CRM and a thorough review of 'blank' material, with potentially sourcing a new more 

reliable, material.  A clear set of rules should be set to define failures and a 'Table of Logic' 

prepared.  An example of a Table of Logic is presented in Table 11.9.   

 
Table 11.9  

Example Table of Logic 

 

‚Ññ Rule 

1 
If a standard is more than three standard deviations above or below the mean for Au, or As, 

the standard is a failure in accuracy. 

2 
If two standards in a row in a single batch are more than two standard deviations from the 

mean, on the same side of the mean, both standards are failures in bias. 

3 If a geological blank is above the Warning Limit for Au, or As, the blank is a failure. 

 

Duplicate samples should also be reviewed on a more measured basis, i.e. if the difference is 

>10% then it is deemed a warning that requires investigation prior to acceptance.  

 

11.11.3 Risk analysis 
 

The Micon audit of the QAQC protocol has identified a number of risks within the sample 

data which are summarised in Table 11.9.  It should be noted that Table 11.9 does not 

constitute a quantitative risk assessment but gives an indication as to where Micon considers 

the risk lie within the sampling data.   

 

A six-score classification is employed where: 

 

ÔÇ∑ 1 ‚Äì 2 ('low' risk): Little or no perceived risk, or low uncertainty; 

ÔÇ∑ 3 ‚Äì 4 ('moderate' risk): Risk present which could lead to small material error in the 
resource model; and 

ÔÇ∑ 5 ‚Äì 6 ('high' risk): This feature could lead to material error in the resource model 
(high uncertainty).

Historical Data 

(including drilling, adit, 

and Trench sampling) 

2 

Historical data are impossible to audit with any degree of confidence, 

however the current mineral resource estimate is largely based on 

recent data and so the overall risk perceived is considered low.   

Diamond Core Drilling 1 
Drilling practices observed (Edgewater) are considered to be in line 

with best industry standards.   

Sampling 1 
Core handling, dressing and logging is to a high standard that lends 

further support to subsequent sample preparation.   

Sample Preparation 1 
Sample preparation was well established during the drilling 

campaigns and in line with best industry standards.  

Duplicate Samples 2 

Edgewater has continuously inserted coarse duplicate splits into the 

sample stream throughout their exploration period that have 

demonstrated good repeatability, albeit from a skewed data set with 

70% of the samples <0.4 g/t Au.   

Blank Samples 3-4 

The 'blank' material used by Edgewater is not a certified material and 

a few failures have revealed the presence of low levels of Au 

mineralisation.  Fortunately ALS inserts certified blank material into 

the sample stream as part of the in-house QC measures and has 

presented this data to Edgewater.   

Standard Samples 5 

No standard (CRM) samples have been inserted by Edgewater.  

However, this has been partially mitigated by ALS submitting CRM's 

into the stream as part of the in-house QC measures and presenting 

the results to Edgewater.   

Sample ID 1 Sample ID is well constructed and established.  

Check Assay and 

Verification Analysis 
2 

Several in-house and independent analyses have been conducted by 

the different operators of the Corcoesto Project and the results have 

generally been positive, corroborating the original assay results and 

the methods of obtaining them.  

Overall Rating 2 (3) Low Risk 

 

The overall rating of risk falls in the low category based on the QAQC audit, this low risk, 

albeit minimal, is due to the absence of CRM samples and unreliable blank material utilized 

by Edgewater.   

 

Notwithstanding the lack of standards (CRM) and truly blank material employed by 

Edgewater, it is the opinion of Micon that the sample preparation, analysis and security 

procedures are to a standard which is acceptable for mineral resource estimation in 

accordance with the guidelines of the JORC Code (2012).

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

12.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The following section describes the processes used by Micon to verify the data in the 

Corcoesto project study.   

 

Procedures for drill hole data entry and database maintenance were reviewed by Micon.  

Based on this review, it was demonstrated that appropriate procedures for data entry and data 

verification have been implemented and it is the opinion of Micon that the drill hole database 

is reliable for the mineral resource estimate in this technical report.   

 

Drill hole collar locations continue to be surveyed by the same surveyor who previously 

completed the work for RNGM and KNB.  The surveyor is currently working as an 

independent contractor and uses a total station with checks completed on all survey data with 

GPS in areas with good coverage.  The data are delivered by email and pasted into the 

individual drill hole files.  Down-hole survey data are collected by an RNGM technician 

using a FLEXIT surveying tool.  These data are entered manually by project staff.   

 

Assay data are received from the assay laboratory by email as Excel spreadsheets containing 

sample number, gold assay, and arsenic assay.  Additional data include the laboratory 

internal repeat samples, and assay results from standard assays and blanks.  These data are 

copied directly to the individual drill hole data spreadsheets, each of which contains all the 

data (collar coordinates, down-hole survey, lithology, etc.) for a single drill hole.  Check 

assay data and data from other laboratories are processed using the same general procedure.   

 

The data for individual drill holes are exported to comma-delimited (csv) files and appended 

to the Microsoft Access file, which contains data for all drill holes and is used for the RNGM 

software known as RecMin (Mining Resources software package).  Data entry is done by a 

single individual, who is a senior geologist on the project staff and is responsible for 

maintaining the database and ensuring that all data are entered correctly and cross checked 

prior to use in the database.   

 

The assay data are checked against the logs and drill core to ensure that the assay is expected 

from the observed geologic characteristics.  This procedure may be repeated by several 

geologists so that the assays are checked against the visual estimate several times.  Samples 

which have unusual assays are sent to both the original laboratory and the check laboratory to 

verify the original assay.   

 

Collar coordinates and down-hole surveys are compared against expected values, surveys are 

checked if needed.  During the site visit Micon also cross-checked several collar coordinates 

using a hand held GPS as well as cross-referencing with site maps and drill hole plans.  No 

discrepancies were observed and no resurveys have been needed since the early RNGM 

period of exploration.

12.2 MICON VERIFICATION ANALYSIS 
 

12.2.1 Site Visit 
 

In order to prepare this Technical Report, Micon has completed several visits to Edgewater's 

Corcoesto project site and office located in the Galicia Region of northwest Spain.   

 

The main site visit was performed by Micon's technical team from 4 to 5 April, 2013.  

Micon's technical team comprised Christopher Jacobs (Mineral Economist and Project 

Manager), Stanley Bartlett (Senior Geologist), Ch√© Osmond (Senior Geologist), Hannah 

Davies (Resource Geologist), Dermot Claffey (Consultant Geotechnical Engineer), and 

Jenifer Hill (Senior Environmental Scientist).  Additional visits have been completed by Ch√© 

Osmond from 8 to 10 May, 2013 (Micon verification sampling), as well as a previous visit 

from 17 and 18 January, 2013, prior to the engagement of Micon to complete this Technical 

Report.   

 

During the main site visit, the technical team discussed, gathered information and evaluated 

the appropriateness of the data, methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the mineral 

resource and ore reserve, mine design, infrastructure, social and environmental, and cost 

estimates with senior technical staff from Edgewater.   

 

12.2.2 Database Validation 
 

Entry of information into the database utilizes a variety of techniques and procedures to 

check the integrity of the data entered. Initial hard copy documents, produced by surveyors, 

technicians, and geologists, are entered into an electronic format, typically a spreadsheet, 

before being imported into RecMin. Laboratory results are received by Edgewater via 

electronic mail in several formats (PDF, Excel and csv) and are transposed directly into the 

appropriate spreadsheet enabling several checks to be conducted prior to its approval.  Once 

transferred into RecMin, via a csv file, the software runs its own internal verification process.  

No significant issues were identified in the review.   

 

Other data verification work performed by Micon included:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Review of ‚âà5% of the geological logs provided by Edgewater;   

ÔÇ∑ Examination of assay certificates and cross-check against the database supplied by 
Edgewater;   

ÔÇ∑ Verification of extreme values;   

ÔÇ∑ Three visits to site to review aspects of the drilling, sampling, QAQC, and reviews 
with the geological department;   

ÔÇ∑ Review of the quality control procedures; and 

ÔÇ∑ Routine validation of the database to check for discrepancies such as inconsistent hole 
lengths, missing intervals, zero length intervals and out of sequence records.  

 



 
 

 
103 

12.2.3 Independent Verification Sampling 
 

As part of its verification process Micon selected 22 separate intervals from the database and 

a total of 286 samples for blind re-analysis (see Appendix 1).  This batch also included 

independently sourced blank and CRM samples (32 number) together with Edgewater blank 

samples (24).  Coarse samples were selected and a 1 kg sub-sample split (using a rotary 

splitter) was generated which were re-bagged and re-labelled, under the supervision of 

Micon, before being submitted to ALS Chemex (Seville) as one batch.  As the samples were 

being re-packaged and re-numbered it was not considered necessary to use an alternative 

laboratory, this also meant that it was possible to retain the same sample preparation and 

analysis procedure as used most recently by Edgewater.   

 

Note that the same sample preparation and analysis procedures have been followed, with a 

minimum detection limit of 0.01 ppm Au.   

 

The result of the 230 original samples re-analysed as part of this verification process are 

presented in Figure 12.1.  The resultant plot (Figure 12.1) demonstrates very good 

repeatability.

Micon has reviewed this data and paired assays were sorted into grade classes with the 

average mean and average absolute error from the mean calculated for each grade class.  The 

results as presented in Table 12.1 and the relationship between class average grade and 

average absolute error is presented in Figure 12.2.   

 

The data shows that analytical errors are greatest at the lower end of the range.  For original 

assays <0.19 g/t Au and from 0.2 g/t Au to 0.39 g/t Au the average error is 12.33% and 

13.35% respectively.  However, the number of samples assayed within the average grade of 

the deposit is low, and the data are skewed with almost 60% of the samples being <0.39 g/t 

Au, although almost 25% of the samples occur within 0.4 g/t Au and 2.49 g/t Au.  

Notwithstanding the above comments, albeit from a limited data set, overall the data 

compares very well with a low (<10%) mean error and is considered acceptable for this 

check analysis.

Analysis of the blank sample results has produced results as expected, as shown in Figure 

12.6.  The Rocklabs 'AuBlank 58' samples, certified as 0.002 g/t Au, produced results at, or 

less than detection limits, whereas the results of the Edgewater blank samples have produced 

mixed results with some failures, with a maximum value of 0.05 g/t Au being achieved for 

one sample that originally graded 0.02 g/t Au.  This was to be expected as it is now largely 

accepted that the material being used by Edgewater does, very occasionally, contain elevated 

levels of Au and As.  Note that the minimum detection limit is 0.01 ppm Au.

12.3 MICON OPINION 
 

This verification process has re-analysed 230 original samples from 22 intersections 

(diamond drill holes) selected from the database provided by Edgewater, plus a further 32 

CRM (standards) and CRM blank material.   

 

The CRM samples analyzed, albeit from a limited number, have performed as expected with 

no failures.  The Rocklabs blank samples have also performed as expected with no failures; 

however the blank samples provided by Edgewater have produced mixed results, with some 

failures.  Notwithstanding the last comment Micon is satisfied that this verification sample 

analysis has performed as required and is satisfied that the results presented in the database 

are of adequate quality and quantity to support the estimation of mineral resources in 

accordance with the guidelines of the JORC Code (2012).   

 

The process of data verification for the Project has been performed by external consultant 

firms (ORE and Micon) and Edgewater personnel.  Edgewater considers that a reasonable 

level of verification has been completed, and that no material issues been left unidentified 

from the programs undertaken.   

 

The QP, who relies upon this work, has reviewed the appropriate reports, and is of the 

opinion that the data verification programs undertaken on the data collected from the Project 

adequately support the geological interpretations, the analytical and database quality, and 



 
 

 
110 

therefore support the use of the data in mineral resource and ore reserve estimation, and in 

subsequent mine planning:  

 

ÔÇ∑ No sample bias was identified from the QAQC programs undertaken; 

ÔÇ∑ Sample data collected adequately reflect deposit dimensions, true widths of 
mineralisation, and the style of the deposit; and 

ÔÇ∑ External reviews of the database have been undertaken in support of feasibility-level 
studies, in support of technical reports, and in support of mineral resource estimates, 

resulting in independent assessments of the database quality.  No significant problems 

with the database, sampling protocols, flow sheets, check analysis program, or data 

storage were noted.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

13.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

There are metallurgical testing reports on samples from the Corcoesto gold project dating 

back to 1998.  Five test programs were referenced in a May 27, 2011 report prepared by Ore 

Reserves Engineering titled "Technical Report for the Corcoesto Gold Deposit, Galicia, 

Spain".  McClelland Laboratories, Inc., Nevada, (McClelland) completed a metallurgical 

report on January 28, 2012 and preliminary results from the testwork were referenced in a 

November 15, 2011 Ore Reserves Engineering report titled "Preliminary Economic 

Assessment for the Corcoesto Gold Deposit, Galicia, Spain".  This report also summarized 

comminution testwork conducted by Phillips Enterprises LLC.  Two additional test programs 

have subsequently been conducted by ALS Metallurgy (ALS) with testing conducted at both 

G&T Metallurgical Services in British Columbia and Ammtec Metallurgy in Western 

Australia.  Starkey & Associates and Pocock Industrial, Inc. conducted testwork 

complementing the ALS test programs.  Results from this latest testwork were not available 

for presentation in this technical report; however a summary of the work conducted is 

presented in Section 13.4.   

 

13.2 TECHNICAL REPORT FOR THE CORCOESTO GOLD DEPOSIT 
 

The metallurgical testwork summarized in the May 2011 NI43-101 Technical Report 

included cyanide leach bottle roll and column tests spanning the years 1998 through 2004.  

The report also included summaries of optical sorting testwork and magnetic sorting 

testwork.  This scoping level testwork established the amenability of the Corcoesto material 

to gold recovery by cyanidation, with recovery levels typically exceeding 90%, and identified 

a correlation between gold recovery and particle size.  

 

13.3 PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT FOR THE CORCOESTO GOLD DEPOSIT 
 

The testwork studies summarized in the November 2012 NI43-101 Preliminary Economic 

Assessment (PEA) were preliminary results from the McClelland metallurgical test program 

titled "Scoping Metallurgical Evaluation ‚Äì Corcoesto Drill Core Composites". 

 

The McClelland study evaluated the amenability of three samples from the Corcoesto 

deposits to gold recovery by gravity concentration, flotation, and cyanidation.  This study 

may best be characterized as a flowsheet development study.  Diagnostic leach tests, whole 

ore cyanidation tests, gravity concentration with cyanidation of the tailings, flotation and 

process simulation testing were all conducted.  The process simulation testing consisted of 

whole ore gravity concentration, regrind/flotation of the gravity tails, and cyanidation of the 

gravity concentrate, flotation concentrate and flotation tails.  Gold extraction from the 

various studies approached 90%. 

 

Arsenic in the head samples ranged from 0.3% to 1.3%.  McClelland had mineralogy 

conducted on Corcoesto samples by Economic Geology Consulting which made no mention 



 
 

 
112 

of arsenic or arsenic minerals.  A later mineralogy study found the presence of arsenopyrite 

and later metallurgical testwork validated that arsenic will concentrate in both the flotation 

and gravity circuits.  While arsenopyrite is largely insoluble in cyanide solutions, leach 

solution analyses would confirm the absence of soluble arsenic and the necessity to treat in 

the cyanide destruction/water treatment processes. 

 

A 13 kg sample of one of the composite samples was submitted to Phillips Enterprises LLC 

for Bond ball mill work index testing.  The Bond mill work index for Composite 1 was 

measured at 15.70 kWh/tonne. 

 

The testwork was used to design a plant for the PEA with processing of the Corcoesto 

material by the following methodology with an estimated overall gold recovery of 89.1%: 

 

ÔÇ∑ Whole ore crushing and grinding incorporating a gravity recovery circuit 

ÔÇ∑ Rougher flotation of the gravity tails 

ÔÇ∑ Regrinding of the flotation and gravity concentrates 

ÔÇ∑ Agitated cyanide leaching of the concentrates 

ÔÇ∑ Carbon-in-pulp adsorption, loaded carbon desorption and electrowinning for gold 
recovery 

 

This flowsheet is assumed for this report.  ALS is currently completing additional testwork to 

further define the processing parameters for this flowsheet. 

 

13.4 ALS METALLURGY 
 

The testwork conducted by ALS will be reported under two project numbers, KM3346 and 

KM3421.  The former project is best characterized as a process optimization study and the 

latter an ore variability study.  Both test programs provided feed and metallurgical products 

for additional testwork to support the process plant design. 

 

ALS conducted testwork on two master composite samples primarily to optimize process 

variables for plant design and to be used in a subsequent variability study.  Master Composite 

1 was comprised to 73 quarter core samples and Master Composite 2 was comprised for 145 

crushed reject samples.  

 

13.4.1 Primary Grind Size 
 

Both Master Composite 1 and Master Composite 2 were subjected to gravity concentration 

followed by flotation of the gravity tails at varying grind sizes to assess the impact of 

grinding on gold recovery.  Primary grind sizes varied from 80% passing 40 ¬µm to 230 ¬µm.  

This testwork will also provide flotation reagents, consumption, and residence time for plant 

design. 

 

  



 
 

 
113 

13.4.2 Concentrate Regrind Size 
 

Several of the combined gravity plus flotation concentrate products were subjected to fine 

grinding followed by cyanide leaching to generate gold extraction versus particle size 

relationships.  Regrind particle size distribution for an 80% passing size varied from 11 ¬µm 

to 33 ¬µm.  

 

13.4.3 Variability Study 
 

The optimal processing conditions derived from testwork on the two master composite 

samples were applied to 25 samples to investigate the variability in metallurgical response to 

sample type.  The 25 samples were generated by compositing drill core.  The results of these 

tests will be used to estimate gravity plus flotation mass pull and the ultimate levels of gold 

and silver recovery.  

 

13.4.4 CIP Gold and Silver Adsorption 
 

ALS conducted agitated leach tests on samples of combined concentrate to generate leached 

slurry for carbon adsorption kinetic and equilibrium testwork.  The adsorption kinetic 

testwork allows derivation of Fleming constants applicable to an empirical rate equation.  

The equilibrium testwork facilitates calculation of constants to fit a Freundlich isotherm.  

 

13.5 COMMINUTION TESTWORK, MILL SIZING AND GRINDING MEDIA/LINER WEAR 
 

Edgewater contracted Starkey & Associates (Starkey) of Oakville, Ontario to complete 

comminution testwork and circuit analysis to size a SAG mil circuit followed by two ball 

mills operating in either parallel or series configuration.  The comminution testwork was 

subcontracted to Inspectorate Exploration and Mining Services Ltd. (IEMS) and consisted of 

two SAGDesign comminution test programs on a total of 10 half drill core samples.  Bond 

abrasion index testwork on six samples was subcontracted to Hazen Research Inc. (HRI) and 

will be used to estimate the rate of liner and media wear for both the SAG and ball mills. 

 

13.6 SOLID/LIQUID SEPARATION 
 

Solid liquid separation testwork will be completed by both ALS and Pocock Industrials, Inc. 

of Salt Lake City (Pocock) to facilitate selection and sizing of thickeners for the 

gravity/flotation tailings prior to discharge to the tailings storage facility and for the 

concentrate prior to regrind.  The Pocock testwork also includes rheological testwork. 

 

13.7 CYANIDE DESTRUCTION 
 

ALS is conducting cyanide destruction testwork on samples of leached concentrate slurries 

using sulfur dioxide, copper sulfate, lime and air.  This testwork will establish criteria for the 

design of an INCO cyanide destruction circuit.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

14.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The mineral resource estimate contained in this technical report was completed by Hannah 

Davies (BSc, FGS), under the supervision of Ch√© Osmond (BSc., MSc., EurGeol., CGeol., FGS), 

both full time employees of Micon.  

 

The effective date of the Mineral Resource estimate contained in this report is 1
st
 March, 2013.   

 

The mineral resource estimate for the Corcoesto Project was completely redone and was updated 

to include 286 diamond holes totalling 53,942.45 m that were drilled by Edgewater from April 

2010 through December 2012.  This mineral resource estimate supersedes that presented in the 

November 2011 NI 43-101 Technical Report entitled "Preliminary Economic Assessment for the 

Corcoesto Gold Deposit", authored by Noble, Pickarts and Claffey.   

 

The Mineral Resource estimate has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines of The 

Australasian Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 

Reserves, The JORC Code, 2012 Edition, a recognized reporting code under the CIM Standards.  

 

The process of mineral resource estimation includes technical information which requires 

subsequent calculations or estimates to derive sub-totals, totals and weighted averages.  Such 

calculations or estimations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently introduce a 

margin of error.  Where these occur, Micon does not consider them to be material.   

 

The mineral resource figures have been rounded to reflect that they are estimates. 

 

There has been insufficient exploration to define the Inferred resources as an Indicated or 

Measured mineral resource.  It is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading them to 

an indicated or measured mineral resource category.   

 

Micon believes that at present there are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, 

taxation, socio-economic, marketing or political issues which could adversely affect the mineral 

resources estimated. 

 

The Mineral Resource Statement presented herein represents a mineral resource evaluation 

prepared for the Corcoesto Project by Micon in conjunction with Edgewater.  Previous mineral 

resource statements have been produced by Ore Reserve Engineering in 2011.   

 

This section describes the resource estimation methodology and summarizes the key parameters 

applied and assumptions made by Micon during this process.  In the opinion of Micon, the 

mineral resource estimate reported herein is a reasonable representation of the tonnage and grade 

of gold bearing rock present at the Corcoesto Project given the current level of sampling.   

 

Micon considers there to be sufficient data and information for the estimation of a Mineral 

Resource for the Corcoesto Project prepared under the guidelines of The Australasian Code for 



   

 
115 

the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore reserves, The JORC Code, 

2012 Edition ("JORC Code").  Total mineral resource estimates for the Corcoesto Project are 

based on resource models of six mineral deposits including Cova Crea, Pozo del Ingl√©s, Pet√≥n de 

Lobo, Montefurado, Fonterremula, and Picotos.   

 

The exploration history of the project is protracted with initial (modern) exploration being 

conducted from the 1970's, and the first drilling by Rio Tinto in 1987.  Since 2010 Edgewater 

has completed almost 300 drill holes for over 50,000 m, adding to the previous 332 drill holes 

(>35,000 m) undertaken between 1987 and 2008 by three different operators.  The most up-to-

date version of the database for Corcoesto has been supplied to Micon for use in the current 

Mineral Resource Estimate.   

 

The database used by Micon in the current estimate contains 50,207 samples and 112,877.27 m 

including drill holes (diamond drill holes, RC holes, geotechnical, and hydrogeological drill 

holes), 176 trenches for 18,469.293 m, and 10 adits (channels) for 1,322.90 m, within the 

Corcoesto Project Concession area.  The result is assay values ranging up to 148,500 ppb Au 

(148.5 g/t Au).   

 

Micon is of the opinion that the current information is sufficiently reliable to interpret the 

boundaries for the gold mineralisation and that the assay data are sufficiently reliable to support 

mineral resource estimation.   

 

Edgewater geologists used RecMin software to generate 3D wireframes of the mineralised 

envelopes which were imported into CAE Mining Datamine Studio Version 3 (Datamine) for 

review and approval by Micon.  The construction of the geological solids was based on 

wireframe modelling using a 300 ppb Au (0.3 g/t Au) resource shell.  These were exported along 

with the sample data in order for Micon to prepare and composite assay data for geostatistical 

analysis, construct the block model, and estimate metal grades.  Micon tabulated and reported 

mineral resources from the resulting models following validation of the procedures and methods 

used.   

 

14.1.1 Previous Mineral Resource Estimate 
 

An independent estimate of the gold resources contained within the Corcoesto deposit was 

carried out by Ore Reserves Engineering (ORE); the results were disclosed in a NI 43-101 

technical report dated December 30, 2011 (Noble, 2011).   

 

Resources were estimated for each mineralised zone using three‚Äêdimensional wireframe 
envelopes to define the mineralised volumes and trend surfaces to provide directional control for 

grade estimation.  Trench, adit, and drill‚Äêhole samples were composited to 2.0 m intervals 
measured perpendicular to the trend surfaces.  Block model gold grades were estimated using 

inverse distance‚Äêpower estimation.  Resource classes were estimated based on the drill‚Äêhole 
spacing, which was measured using the kriging variance from a point‚Äêkriging run with a linear 
variogram.   

 



   

 
116 

The resource was split into open pit and underground potential based on the floating cone pit at 

US$1,100/oz gold price.  The base case cut-off grades applied were 0.60 g/t Au for open pit 

resources and 2.00 g/t Au for underground, based on optimized cut-off grades computed using 

US$1,300/oz gold and the project costs from the PEA.  Dilution is included in the tabulated 

resources for a minimum mining width of 2.0 m with a bench height of 4.0 m.   

 

The Corcoesto (2011) estimate outlined in Table 14.1 and 14.2 is superseded by the current 

estimate in this report.  Note that there are no Measured and Indicated mineral resources for the 

North Area (Fonterremula, Montefurado, and Picotos).

14.1.2 Approach 
 

The drillhole, underground sampling and surface trench data were initially imported and 

validated in Datamine software, which was then used for the mineral resource modelling.   

 

Micon has imported all of the available sample data into Gemcom Surpac‚Ñ¢ (Surpac), and 

transformed and projected the 2D database into 3D space.  The resultant transformation has been 

validated against historical sections, and by Edgewater, to check the interpretation for accuracy.  

Micon is satisfied that the methods involved are valid and any errors will not have a material 

impact on the resultant mineral resource estimate.   

 

The resource models for the six mineralised zones were originally defined by Edgewater 

geologists and constructed in similar fashion using RecMin software.  A gold zone 

(mineralisation) model was built with the assay data from drill holes, trenches and adit samples.  



   

 
118 

Micon reviewed the lithological data, as well as quartz vein logging, in order to identify any Au 

associations to assist in mineralised interpretation.  It was not possible to infer any direct, and 

reliable, correlation of Au mineralisation with lithology and/or quartz mineralisation based on 

the available data, and therefore the mineralised zones have been constructed from Au assay 

values to generate a series of grade shell wireframe envelopes.   

 

Datamine software was used to interpolate the mineralised envelopes with blocks, and in 

common with other mining software systems, relies on a block modelling approach to represent 

deposits as a series of 3D blocks to which grade and other attributes, can be assigned.  The 

software provides numerous means by which attributes can be assigned, and optimisation 

routines are provided that allow block sub-celling, allowing the filling of complex deposit 

volumes ensuring volume is not lost or smoothed out by using regular size blocks.   

 

14.1.3 Topography 
 

A topographic surface was supplied to Micon by Edgewater in digital format.  The local relief of 

the project area is dominated by a strongly developed ridge-and-valley landscape.  Maximum 

elevation within the licence area is around 250m ASL in the south of the licence area and the 

drainage flows to the north into the Anll√≥ns River that discharges into the Atlantic via the Ria of 

Corme and Laxe.   

 

This data was checked against the drill hole collar and surface trench surveys and generally 

showed good adherence to the topographical surface.  Any discrepancies were investigated and 

edited as deemed necessary and appropriate.  Micon generated a digital terrain model (DTM), 

using the provided topographic data.  This DTM surface was used as the upper limit of the 

mineralisation in the modelling process.   

 

14.2 DATABASE 
 

The database for the Corcoesto project was developed by the Client in Microsoft Access and is 

understood to contain all available data up to 1
st
 March 2013.  The database was imported into 

Surpac software for analysis and review.  The import process identified no errors within the 

database, no overlapping samples were evident.  Within the database the collar file has 

information pertaining to the exploration sample type.  The database contains information from 

adits, trenches, diamond drill core and reverse circulation drilling.  The geotechnical (hole ID 

prefix DDGT) and hydrological holes have not been assayed and information on the adit samples 

and surveys is noted as "pending".  Table 14.3 summarises the database.

database has been described in Section 12.2.2.   

14.3 MINERALISED ENVELOPE WIREFRAMES 
 

14.3.1 Introduction 
 

Interpretation of the mineralised zones has been undertaken by the Client.  Six zones have been 

defined: Picotos, Fonterremula, Montefurado, Pozo del Ingl√©s, Pet√≥n de Lobo and Cova Crea, the 

location of these zones in relation to each other is displayed in Figure 14.1.  Wireframes 

representing the dykes identified by Edgewater within the exploration area are also displayed in 

Figure 14.1 coloured red for identification purposes.   

 
 



   

 
120 

Figure 14.1  

Plan View of Mineralised Envelope Zones and Dykes 

 

 
 

The general strike of the mineralised bodies is North East ‚Äì South West, they dip to the north 

between 54¬∞ and 73¬∞, and are thus concordant with the main lithological trend and extensional 

shear zones.   

 

0                                                            1 km 

 



   

 
121 

The lack of continuity and clearly defined, sufficiently broad, quartz veins, and/or clearly defined 

association of Au grade with lithology, has resulted in the definition of mineralised envelopes 

generated by Edgewater at a cut-off grade of 300 ppb Au (0.3 g/t Au).   

 

Generally, assays used are higher than cut-off grades and contacts between economic and 

noneconomic grades are relatively sharp. The wireframes include internal dilution (material with 

assay values<300 ppb Au). No minimum width of internal dilution has been applied by the client 

in the generation of the wireframes; the only control on the inclusion of the material is that the 

overall interval grade is equal to or greater than 300 ppb Au. The wireframes have been reviewed 

by Micon and adjusted in areas to minimize the inclusion of below cut off material, this has led 

to the generation of additional wireframe structures in many of the zones from the original 

wireframes provided by the Client. The modification of the wireframes by Micon is believed to 

provide more robust wireframe interpretation in certain zones.  

 

14.3.2 Quartz Vein Analysis 
 

An analysis of the association between Au grade and quartz was investigated and the results are 

summarized in the plots presented as Figures 14.2, 14.3, and 14.4, whereby Au grade is plotted 

against thickness of quartz vein (mm) per sample interval, the number of quartz veins per sample 

interval, and % quartz within the sample interval, respectively.

123 

This study proved rather inconclusive, there is insufficient evidence of correlation between 

quartz occurrences and Au grades and as such this could not be used to assist in the development 

of the grade shell wireframe envelopes.   

 

Exceptions were made in areas within the Edgewater wireframe envelopes in order to provide 

continuity.  In these areas information on geology (quartz veining), alteration (silicification and 

sericitization), and anomalous arsenic (a good guide to gold mineralisation) were used to provide 

better support to the interpretation.  Many of these areas had Au grades below the predefined cut-

off grade and therefore were removed from the wireframe interpretation by Micon in order to 

reduce the inclusion of waste material within the wireframe envelopes.  Wireframes envelopes 

were extended beyond sample inclusion at a variety of distances by the Client; some of these 

extensions were limited by Micon in their review by the generation of new lenses, or between 50 

m and 100 m depending on the density of supporting sample information.  

 

Micon believes that the mineralised envelopes defined in this process represent the limits of gold 

mineralisation based on the development of a grade shell, and therefore provide a reasonable 

control of the gold estimation.  High grade intervals occur within some of the mineralised 

envelopes however continuity between these zones could not be delineated as a separate high 

grade zone or zones within the mineralised envelopes.   

 

14.3.3 Contiguous Length Analysis 
 

The mineralised wireframes provided by the Client were generated at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t 

Au (300 ppb).  A contiguous sample length analysis was completed to investigate the effect of 

the cut-off grade on intercepts above a selective cut-off grade.  The analysis accumulates and 

then averages the length of the intercepts between defined cut-off grade ranges.  Where changes 

in the distribution of the average length above cut-off were identified these grade values are used 

to define the mineralisation.  As is evident from the plot of the results of this analysis in Figure 

14.5, a cut-off grade of 300 ppb Au (0.3 g/t Au) is acceptable for the dataset.   

 
  



   

 
124

Contiguous Length Analysis 

 

 
 

14.3.4 Mineralised Envelope Wireframe Development 
 

The mineralised envelope wireframes were developed through the digitising of 2D strings on 

cross sections; these strings were then linked to form (3D) solid objects enclosing the 

mineralised zones above a 300 ppb Au cut-off grade.   

 

Digitised solids were generated by Edgewater in RecMin software and provided to Micon for 

review, unfortunately due to limitations with the software used to develop these solids they could 

not be directly used for modelling in Datamine software.  Consequently wireframe solids were 

developed for each zone by Micon, this process included the re-digitising of the sections using 

the Clients initial interpretations and amending them as per the points highlighted previously.  

Once the sections for a zone were completed the strings developed by Micon were sent to the 

Client for review and approval prior to the generation of solids.  

 

Strings were digitised to a composite cut-off of 300 ppb Au (0.3 g/t Au) as per the original 

interpretation by the Client; absent sample intervals were not included unless intervals existed in 

areas where adjacent samples in very close proximity existed.  Composite samples could include 

minimal waste intervals, as long as the composite sample across the width of the interval was 

equal to or greater than the cut-off grade of 300 ppb Au.  This was deemed acceptable by Micon 

as the proposed open pit mining method was not considered to be selective and rather based on 

blast hole sample assessment to the SMU.  However, Micon endeavoured to keep these waste 

inclusions to a minimum, whilst retaining the original interpretation by Edgewater.  This limiting 



   

 
125 

of the waste inclusions was undertaken in order to prevent the smearing of grade into low grade 

zones during the modelling process.  

 

The wireframe solids generated by Micon were verified to ensure that no overlapping or open 

edges were present, as this can lead to complications when used to confine block models at a 

later stage.  Verified solids generated by Micon were reviewed and approved by the Client before 

being used for the generation of block models.   

 

Wireframes for five dykes present within the zones of mineralisation have also been developed 

based on the original interpretation undertaken by the client.  These verified solids are used to 

limit the mineralised envelope wireframes in the areas they are present.  These too have been 

reviewed and approved by the Client before further use in the resource modelling process. 

 

A review of the lithological information within geotechnical hole 13WGT23 suggests continuity 

between the lithology in the drill hole intersections carrying grade either side of the geotechnical 

hole.   

 

Some areas have new drillholes progressed by Edgewater which have not been sampled in the 

upper horizons, most likely due to the poor core recovery within these weathered zones, in some 

cases such as with drill hole 12W260 and trench Cal-1 in Cova Crea the trench assay values are 

above the cut-off grade adjacent to the unsampled intersection within the drill hole.  In cases 

where this has occurred the trench samples have taken precedence and therefore due to 

wireframing constraints the absent drill hole sample has also been included.   

 

Absent samples included within the zones have been set to a value of 0.1 ppb Au so that 

statistical analysis, and later estimations, can be carried out on the dataset.  It is often considered 

good practice that absent samples be set for these purposes at half the detection limit.  However 

for the datasets available for Corcoesto the detection limit varies dependent upon the 

drilling/exploration campaign and as stated within the QAQC section of this report there are 

some erroneous values below the stated detection limits reported within the database and hence 

the value of 0.01 ppb Au applied.   

 

14.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
 

Statistical analysis of the mineralised samples (database) was undertaken in Surpac software to 

identify any potential bias that may be present within the grade data.   

 

Samples were selected within each mineralised zone for analysis.  Each vein structure within the 

zones was assigned a vein code based on the Client's interpretation of the veins.  Samples 

situated within the dyke wireframes have been removed from the datasets prior to statistical 

analysis.   

 

The frequency distribution of Au within the sample populations was examined to identify the 

possible presence of high-grade outlier populations.  Outlier values may result from sample 

errors and can exert an undue influence during block grade interpolation.  Each zone that 

represented part of the present estimate was treated differently and used a different high grade 



   

 
126 

capping value.  Log-probability plots of the distributions of Au within each area were generated; 

the plots of the higher grade sample populations are presented in Figures 14.6 to 14.11.

129 

The log probability plots clearly show that the sample populations from the different areas have 

different distributions.  A number of areas have distinctive multiple populations where low grade 

material is clearly distinguishable from the average grade and higher grade populations, such as 

Fonterremula.  These low grade populations are present due to no minimum width of below cut-

off material being applied within the generation of the wireframes defining the mineralised 

zones.  High grade sample populations are present within the sub datasets due to the morphology 

and nugget style mineralogy of the deposit, and potentially heightened due to the sampling 

methodology employed.   

 

The areas with larger sample populations, such as Cova Crea and Pet√≥n de Lobo, have smoother 

grade distributions which are expected due to the high density of sample data, and as such these 

areas have a greater impact on the overall Au distribution.  

 

Capping factors were applied to raw assays prior to compositing.  This approach is used to 

prevent the high-grade assays from being smeared over two composites.  The top cut values 

outlined in Table 14.4 have been rounded to the nearest 100 ppb.  Conservative top cuts have 

been applied to the zones in order in minimize the effect of the sporadic and erroneous high 

grade samples within the zones and reduce the potential for the generation of metal volume 

during later estimations.  Overall the effect of the top cuts on the Corcoesto dataset has not 

resulted in any significant reduction in the mean grade.   

 

A comparison of the basic statistics for each zone and the statistics of the sub datasets post top 

cutting is summarised in Table 14.4 and Table 14.5.

14.6 BLOCK MODELLING 
 

A block model prototype was developed which enveloped all the mineralised zones.  Block 

models were generated for each mineralised zone and dyke structure within this prototype.  The 

block model has a parent block size of 8 m x 8 m x 4 m with variable sub-blockings to a 

minimum of 2 m x 2 m x 1 m in order to best fit the volume of the wireframe models, reflect the 

proposed bench height of 8 m, and also honour the 2 m composite sample length.  The blocks 

were generated primary along the X axis and then along the Z axis.   

 

A separate prototype was generated for the waste model based on a scale factor of the 

mineralised model parent cell.  This scaling factor was applied so that the mineralised model 

could be translated onto the new prototype and appended with the waste model.  Further 

information on the development of the waste model is outlined in Section xxx.   

 

No rotation was applied to the block models as this allows ease of transfer between the Clients 

software and pit optimisation software.  Rotation of the models may of lead to areas of the 



   

 135 

wireframes having a better fit of blocks within the volume however on the whole a good fit has 

been achieved.   

 

The prototype block model parameters are provided in Table 14.9.

Z -500 4 1 

 

Block models using the same parameters as outlined in Table 14.9 were also generated for the 

dykes associated with mineralised zones.  It is the Client's belief that the dykes postdate the 

mineralisation and to represent this blocks situated within the dyke wireframes replace the blocks 

within the mineralised block models.  This has been undertaken so that the blocks on either side 

of the dyke have the influence of samples both sides of the dykes reflecting the absence of the 

dykes at the time of the mineralisation activity.   

 

It is clearly evident from the wireframe volumes developed for the mineralised zones, and the 

dykes, that the orientation of mineralisation both along strike and down dip fluctuates from the 

general strike and dip.  In order to account for the changes in orientation, dynamic anisotropy 

analysis has been undertaken for each mineralised zone and dyke, which allows for the 

orientation of the search ellipsoid to be defined individually for each block within the models, 

through the estimation of true dip and dip direction angles.  The changes in orientation in the 

wireframes volumes are established through the development of digitised strings in both plan and 

section through the wireframe volumes.  Strings were digitised on 25 m sections and on 20 m 

plan sections though the wireframe volumes, an example of these digitised strings for the 

mineralised zone of Picotos is displayed in Figure 14.13.

Figure 14.13  

Digitised Anisotropic Strings for Picotos (Isometric View - NTS) 

 

 
Strings along strike (20 m plan sections) in green. Strings down dip (25 m sections) in blue. 

 

The digitised strings are used to generate the dip direction and dip for each block within the 

model.  These values are then estimated into the block model using Inverse Distance Weighting 

(IDW) for angular data.  The estimation parameters used are summarised in Table 14.10.

Search Distance Y (m) 25 50 75 

Search Distance Z (m) 25 50 75 

 

Dip and dip directions can be generated from the wireframe triangles, however the wireframe 

volumes change orientation rapidly over small areas and therefore the orientation of the 

neighbouring blocks based on triangle interpolation changes significantly.  The orientation of 

blocks based on the generation of digitised strings is much smoother and in general provides a 

better description of the orientation changes.

14.7 VARIOGRAPHY 
 

Variography was undertaken: 

 

ÔÇ∑ To estimate the presence of anisotropy in the deposit; 

ÔÇ∑ To derive the spatial continuity of mineralisation along the principal main anisotropic 
orientations; 

ÔÇ∑ To produce suitable variogram model parameters for use in geostatistical grade 
interpolation; and 

ÔÇ∑ To assist in selection of suitable search parameters upon which to base the resource 
estimation.  

 

Composite samples for each zone were used for the development of variograms.  Anisotropic 

variograms were developed in three directions, along the strike of the wireframes represented by 

the X axis, down the general dip direction of the wireframes as represented by the Y axis, and 

across the width of the wireframes represented by the Z axis.  All angles of rotation are measured 

in a clockwise direction from the origin of the axis.   

 

Variographic analysis was studied for all of the mineralised zones but continuity could not be 

established within the smaller zones in the north of the project area; Picotos, Fonterremula and 

Montefurado, due to the smaller sample populations.  Continuity in the variography for Cova 

Crea was also poor, especially in the across strike direction and therefore the estimation for this 

zone was undertaken using IDW
3
.   

 

Pairwise relative variograms were generated along the three principle axes for each of the two 

larger zones; Pet√≥n de Lobo and Pozo Del Ingl√©s.  A summary of the variograms parameters for 

each zone are included in Table 14.11.  The characteristics of the normal variograms along the 

principal and intermediate axes, and in the down-hole directions are presented in Figure 14.14 to 

Figure 14.17.

14.8 ESTIMATION PARAMETERS 
 

14.8.1 Mineralised Zones 
 

The basic statistical analysis, combined with the variography and assay composites analysis 

indicated the appropriate method and parameters for block grade estimation. Three 

concentric search radii were selected for the estimation of each zone. The search ellipses 

were aligned so that the X axis aligned along the strike of the wireframes, the Y axis aligned 

with the dip of the wireframes and the Z axis was aligned across the width of the wireframes.  

All angles of rotation are measured in a clockwise direction from the origin of the axis.   

 

For the zones where variographic continuity could not be established estimations were 

undertaken using IDW.  All estimations were undertaken into the sub cells of the block 

model in order to minimize the smearing effect of material below the cut-off included within 

the wireframes.  

 

Search ellipses representing the general strike and dip of the lenses within each zone were 

established and used where blocks were absent of dynamic anisotropy angles.  All zones, 

except for Pozo del Ingl√©s, had an absence of un-estimated dynamic anisotropy angles.  A 

minimal number of blocks within the Pozo del Ingl√©s model could not be estimated due to the 

orientation of the wireframes, the digitised strings were altered to keep this number of blocks 

to a minimum.   

 

For the two areas where Ordinary Kriging (OK) was implemented the first search volume 

distances were set near to the ranges of the third variograms structure, the maximum point of 

grade continuity.  The search parameters implemented for the estimations within each zone 

are summarised in Table 14.12 to Table 14.17.  A maximum of two samples from the same 

drill hole, trench or adit could be used within the search ellipse.

14.9 BLOCK MODEL VALIDATION 
 

Following grade estimation a statistical and visual assessment of the block model was 

undertaken to:  

 

1. assess successful application of the estimation passes;  
2. ensure that as far as the data allowed, all blocks within mineralisation domains were 

estimated; and  

3. ensure that the model estimates performed as expected.   
 

The model validation methods carried out included:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Decluster analysis (statistical grade validation); 

ÔÇ∑ A visual assessment of grade; and  

ÔÇ∑ SWATH plot (model grade profile) analysis. 
 



   

147 

 

14.9.1 Declustering ‚Äì Mineralised Zones 
 

In order to validate the block model estimates and check for conditional bias, plots were 

created which compare block model grade estimates and composite sample average grades.  

Composite samples were declustering into blocks of the parent cell dimensions of 8 m x 8 m 

x 4 m.  The plots for the mineralised zones are displayed in Figure 14.18 to Figure 14.23.   

 

It is apparent from the plots that there is no significant bias between block grades and 

composite grades.

14.9.2 Visual Validation 
 

A visual comparison (validation) of composite sample grade and block grade was conducted 

in cross section and in plan for both the mineralised block models and the dyke models.  

These validations supported the findings of the declustering in that the block grades and 

composite grades compared well and spatially reflect the composite grades.   

 

Example sections of visual validations are presented in Figure 14.24 to Figure 14.34.   Colour 

coding for these figures is as follows:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Magenta =  20,000 ppb Au - Ceiling

14.9.3 Swath Analysis 
 

A swath plot is a graphical display of the grade distribution derived from a series of bands, or 

swaths, generated in several directions through the deposit.  The swath plot compares grade 

within these bands of the composite samples and the block estimated grades.   

 

Where the composite grades and the estimated grades show a good correlation, greater 

confidence is placed on the estimate.  Deviations between the composite and estimated block 

grade typically occur at the edges of the deposit where reduced tonnages accentuate the 

differences in grade and differences in grade also become more apparent in lower grade 

areas.  These lower grade areas, typically where the density of drilling decreases, and a few 

composites can have a disproportionate effect on the estimated grades.  However, due to the 

density of drilling, these areas tend to be classified as Inferred resources.   

 

Global validation of the block models was undertaken though the generation of swath plots in 

a northing (Y) and easting (X) direction through the block models.  Figure 14.35 to Figure 

14.40 present the generated plots for each zone.  It is clear that the block model grades follow 

the trend of the composite grades and in some areas smoothing of the grades across sections 

is observed causing slight underestimation of block grades in comparison to the composite 

grades.

14.9.4 Validation summary 
 

Globally no indications of significant over or under estimation are apparent in the model nor 

were any obvious interpolation issues identified.  From the perspective of conformance of the 

average model grade to the input data, Micon considers the model to be a satisfactory 

representation of the drill hole, trench and adit data used, and an indication that the grade 

interpolation has performed as expected.  As a general comment, the validations only 

determine whether the grade interpolation has performed as expected.  Acceptable validation 

results do not necessarily mean the model is correct or derived from the right estimation 

approach.  It only means the model is a reasonable representation of the data used and the 

estimation method applied.   

 

14.10 SPECIFIC GRAVITY 
 

Densities were coded into the block model based on the blocks location with regards to an 

oxide surface.  The oxide surface was generated from a series of points generated by the 

Client indicating the base of the oxidized zone in the drill hole database.  Where information 

was limited an average depth of 25 m below the surface topography was defined by the 

Client as the oxide limit.   

 

The extent of the oxidization requires further investigation.   

 

The density values outlined in Table 14.23 were assigned to the corresponding blocks above 

and below the generated oxide surface.

14.11 RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
 

The mineral resource classification for the Corcoesto deposit is prepared in accordance with 

the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 

Reserves [JORC Code (2012)], which is a recognized reporting code under the CIM 

Standards.  The following definitions were adopted for the classifications of the mineral 

resources:   

 

ÔÇ∑ Measured mineral resources were defined by those portions of the mineralised zone 
outlined by a sample spacing of 25 m x 25 m and having three or more composite 

samples within the first search ellipse with two or more of these samples from 

different drillholes/trenches/adits;   



   

164 

 

ÔÇ∑ Indicated mineral resources were defined by those portions of the mineralised zone 
outlined by having two or more samples from different drillholes/trenches/adits, and 

falling within the second search ellipse for each zone; and,  

ÔÇ∑ Inferred mineral resources were defined as those portions of the mineralised zone 
which were outlined by widely spaced composite samples, or lenses containing 

samples multiple composite samples but only from one drill hole, trench or adit. 

 

Classification also took into account the sample population density within each of the 

wireframe surfaces, and also the confidence of geological/mineralised continuity within each 

area. 

 

In areas where the dyke structures cross cut the mineralised block models and if no samples 

are present within the zone cut off by the dyke to support the grade estimations within these 

block(s), the area has been deemed as unclassified.  Areas were this is the case are present in 

both Picotos and Pozo del Ingl√©s.   

 

The dyke material has not been classified; this material and the unclassified blocks described 

above have been coded as waste material.   

 

Figure 14.41 to Figure 14.46 show isometric views of the block model illustrating the 

distribution of the unconstrained mineral resource categories.  Colour coding in these figures 

is as follows:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Red    =   Measured 

ÔÇ∑ Green    =   Indicated 

ÔÇ∑ Blue    =   Inferred 

ÔÇ∑ Yellow   =   Unclassified 

ÔÇ∑ Grey    =   Absent

The grade tonnage distribution for Measured and Indicated material in each of the areas is 

presented in Figure 14.47 to Figure 14.51.  From the figures below it is apparent that the 

larger areas contain a significant profile of Measured and Indicated resources above a cut-off 

grade of 0.6g/t Au.  The smaller zones such as Fonterremula, which has only Indicated 

material, has a significant profile of resources above a lower cut off of 0.3g/t Au.  No 

Measured or Indicated material was present within Montefurado and therefore no grade 

tonnage analysis has been performed.

14.12 WASTE MODEL 
 

A waste model was generated using the same block model origin as the mineralised model, 

though the prototype block model used for the waste had a larger parent cell size, the 

parameters are provided in Table 14.24.

Waste Block Model Parameters 

 

Direction Origin Parent Block Size (m)

The model covered an area large enough to be used for pit optimisation.   

 

14.13 GEOTECHNICAL CODING 
 

Parameters outlined within the geotechnical report with regards to slope angles within the 

different lithological units were coded into the combined block model.  The lithologies 

within the database were numerically coded based on information provided by the Client, the 

coding applied is outlined in Table 14.25.

The numerical coding was estimated into the block models using a Nearest Neighbour (NN) 

estimation and the following parameters (Table 14.26).

The search ellipse was not rotated and the first search ellipse designed to equal one parent 

block waste cell unit.  Any material within the second search ellipse should be used with 

caution.  Estimations within the third search ellipse were set for the optimisation purposes to 

an "unspecified" category as is highly unlikely that accurate lithological estimations can be 

made over the search distances.  The majority of material in the location of the pit fell into 

the first and second search ellipses.   

 

Visual validation of the lithological estimations was undertaken to validate the estimation, 

examples of these are shown in Figure 14.52 and Figure 14.53.  Colour coding in these 

figures is as follows:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Blue    =   Dykes 

ÔÇ∑ Red    =   Sil Mineralised 

ÔÇ∑ Orange   =   Schist 

ÔÇ∑ Green   =   Gneiss 

ÔÇ∑ Cyan   =   Everything else 

ÔÇ∑ Grey    =   Absent

14.13.1 Specific Gravity Combined Model 
 

The estimated lithological codes were assigned a specific gravity which was also coded into 

the waste model.  The specific gravity of the modelled dykes and mineralised units were 

assigned the specific gravities outline within Section 14.10.   

 

The density values outlined in Table 14.27 below were assigned to the corresponding blocks 

above and below the generated oxide surface within the waste model.

The specific gravities for lithologies within the "other" category are the averages of the 

specific gravities outlined by the client for all the lithological units falling within this 

category.  

 

14.14 CONCEPTUAL OPEN PIT 
 

14.14.1 Introduction 
 

The preliminary classified model was reviewed to determine the potential economic viability 

in an open pit mining scenario.  An optimized (conceptual) pit shell derived using base 

economics was used to identify potential open pit material.  This pit shell, displayed in 

relation to the resource model in the isometric views in Figure 14.54, has been used to 

constrain the reported mineral resources.  Colour coding in Figure 14.54 (and Figure 14.55 to 

14.58) is as follows:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Red    =   Measured 

ÔÇ∑ Green    =   Indicated 

ÔÇ∑ Blue    =   Inferred 

ÔÇ∑ Yellow   =   Unclassified 

ÔÇ∑ Grey    =   Absent

14.14.2 Open Pit Optimization 
 

In-pit mineral resource optimization was completed using Gemcom Software's Whittle 4X 

(Whittle) open pit optimization program.  This program uses the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm 

to determine the optimal economic open pit footprint for a given mineral resource.  Once this 

footprint has been established, the software allows the development of a simple production 

schedule.  For the Corcoesto deposit, a single block model was provided with gold values 

which are the basis for the block model exported to Whittle.     

 

The Corcoesto block model gold values are the basis for the in-pit (constrained) resource.  

The block model was provided in a Datamine format (which was imported into the Vulcan 

Mine Planning Software System) and a Whittle rock code, mining cost adjustment factor 

(MCAF), and a slope code, was added to this model and then exported into a Whittle ready 

format.  The Whittle rock codes are shown below in Table 14.28.  For this analysis, all 

material classes (Measured, Indicated, and Inferred) were considered as potential feed in the 

optimization.  This block model was then exported into Whittle for optimization.

For this analysis, all material classes were considered in the optimization and the resulting pit 

shell would be used to report an in-pit mineral resource for the Corcoesto deposit.  The 

economic criteria used in the pit optimization are shown in Table 14.29.

The topographic base of the block model/Whittle model was provided by Edgewater and is 

based on current topography.  No mining dilution or mining recovery factors were applied 

during the optimization since this was an analysis of the economic in-pit mineral resource.  

Pit slopes used are described below in Table 14.30 to Table 14.33.  Slopes were further 

reduced by 4 degrees to account for ramp access.

14.16 MICON OPINION 
 

14.16.1 Conclusions 
 

Based on the work undertaken as part of this mineral resource estimate, Micon concludes the 

following: wherever  

  

ÔÇ∑ The work undertaken at the Corcoesto Project to date has enabled Micon to report a 
Mineral Resource in accordance with the guidelines of the JORC Code (2012).  

ÔÇ∑ Drilling, logging, sampling and analytical work are carried out in line with industry 
best practice along with a reasonably robust QAQC program.  

ÔÇ∑ Diamond drill holes provide the bulk (79.3%) of the sample data with the remainder 
comprising trench (17.8%), RC (2.2%), adit (0.6%), and geotechnical core (0.1%).  

ÔÇ∑ Edgewater has completed 62% of the diamond core drilling at the Corcoesto Project 
since 2010.  

ÔÇ∑ Gold mineralisation at Corcoesto is associated with quartz-arsenopyrite veins and is 
highly structurally controlled by N70E extensional zones.  

ÔÇ∑ Mineralised interpretation (and generation of wireframes) was based on gold value 
(>300 ppb Au) only.   

ÔÇ∑ The Corcoesto mineralisation and deposit is considered to be amenable to open pit 
mining.   

ÔÇ∑ Micon has been able to classify the mineral resources in the Measured (52%), 
Indicated (31%), and Inferred (17%) categories, mainly on the basis of grade 

continuity and the relative density of the data.   

ÔÇ∑ The (Measured and Indicated) mineral resource is fairly robust at higher reported cut 
off grades (see Table 14.35).   

ÔÇ∑ The increased drilling completed since the previous resource estimate (November 
2011) has resulted in a significant increase in the contained Measured and Indicated 

resources (Table 14.37), albeit at a lower grade (1.55 g/t Au verses 1.32 g/t Au).  

Much of this is a result of conversion of Inferred resources into a higher category, 

though the overall tonnage and contained gold has reduced.   

ÔÇ∑ The 2013 mineral resource estimate database contains an additional 253 infill and 
exploration DDH's (46,412.75 m) compared to the previous (2011) estimate.  

ÔÇ∑ Notwithstanding the above comments it is not possible to conduct a direct comparison 
as both resource estimates (2011 v. 2013) are constrained within pit shells generated 

with different parameters.  Should the Micon (2013) mineral resource be constrained 

within a US$1,100/oz pit shell (as applied in the 2011 resource estimate) the 

contained tonnage will decrease while the grade will increase ‚Äì with an overall 

decrease in contained gold compared with the US$1,400/oz pit shell.

Note: 

1. 2011 Measured and Indicated pit constrained resources were estimated using a US$1,100/oz gold price 
compared to the 2013 Measured and Indicated pit constrained resources estimated using a 

US$1,400/oz gold price.   

2. An additional 12.9 Mt at 1.86 g/t Au (772 koz) was estimated separately at a cut-off grade of 1.0 g/t 
Au for underground mining and not included within the constrained pit shell.   

 

ÔÇ∑ The mineralised zones included in the current mineral resource estimate are 
reasonably well understood and the strike extents typically known from the current 

exploration.  However, some (areas) remain open, particularly at depth, and subject to 

continued positive exploration may increase the current mineral resource.  

 

14.16.2 Recommendations 
 

Based on the above conclusions further recommendations for the Corcoesto Project are 

described below.    

 

Edgewater should incorporate additional drill hole data, where absent, into the database 

including core recovery, alteration, and quartz vein details.  A review of drill core recovery 

should be undertaken, particularly from higher grade intervals with core recovery <60%.   

 

Geotechnical holes have been systemically unsampled and therefore these holes are absent of 

assay data.  There are areas, such as in Cova Crea, where a geotechnical hole intersects the 

mineralised wireframe interpretation.  It would be prudent for these sections to be sampled 

for completeness and where identified within the zones of mineralisation.   

 

The current resource model can be utilized to identify areas of low confidence (Inferred 

resources) that may, subject to positive exploration results, improve the robustness of the 

estimate in these areas and permit inclusion into Indicated (or Measured) mineral resources.   

 

Edgewater should consider an infill drilling program in the northern zones of Montefurado, 

where there are currently no Measured and Indicated resources, Fonterremula, where only 

minimal Indicated resource are present, and Picotos (no Measured resources), to improve 

data density and seek conversion into higher category resources.   

 



   

189 

 

For this mineral resource estimate only those resources with potential for open pit extraction 

have been considered.  The previous (2011) mineral resource estimate considered deeper 

mineralisation for potential underground development.  Therefore, Edgewater may wish to 

revisit this option and a drilling program on the deep extensions of Cova Crea, Pozo del 

Ingl√©s, and Pet√≥n de Lobo, should be considered to further define the underground potential.   

 

The extent of the oxidization requires further investigation and clarification.  For the mineral 

resource estimate this zones has not been separated as the material is not believed to be 

mineralogically different from a metallurgical and processing standpoint.   

 

The complexity and frequency of mineralised quartz veins makes it difficult to interpret and 

model the quartz veins individually with sufficient confidence.  In addition to this, the large 

numbers of very thin veins (that can contain appreciable gold grades) mean that model blocks 

have to be generated so that they include these veins.  In previous studies, multiple-indicator 

modelling approaches (MIK) have been applied and are considered to be a logical approach 

given the complications owing to the complexity and frequency of the quartz veins.  The 

MIK method produces ore proportions and associated grades within an individual block.  A 

dynamic anisotropy method of directly modelling the veins from the grade data, and using 

variable strike orientations, should be considered as a comparison.

15.0 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 
 

As of the Effective Date of this report, no Mineral Reserve has been reported for the 

Corcoesto property.

16.0 MINING METHODS 
 

Mining engineering studies for open pit mining at Corcoesto are being carried out as part of 

an ongoing feasibility study.  No underground mining is presently being considered. 

However, as of the date of this technical report, feasibility work is still in progress and, until 

that ongoing work is completed, the following description of mining methods, summarized 

from the November, 2011 PEA study by ORE, and based on ORE's resource estimate, 

remains current.  

 

16.1 OPEN PIT MINING 
 

The majority of the ore will be mined using conventional open‚Äêpit mining with blasting, 
hydraulic shovel loading, and CAT 777‚Äêclass haulage trucks for transport of ore and waste. A 
4‚Äêmeter bench height is assumed for mining of ore to provide maximum selectivity for grade 
control. Mining of waste may be on 4, 8, or 12 m benches, as needed, to provide the 
maximum efficiency and minimize the cost of mining waste.  

 

Ore production is assumed to average 6,000 tonnes per day over a seven day week, but will 

likely be mined during the day shift over a five‚Äêday schedule. Since all pits have 
approximately the same average grade and grade is generally constant over a wide elevation 

range, ore mining could be approximated as a constant tonnage and grade over the life of the 

mine. Waste mining is assumed to be level at a 9:1 stripping ratio for the first 6 years of the 

project and declines to 2.7:1 in the final year of production as pre-stripping requirements are 

reduced at the bottom of the ultimate pit.  

 

Pit optimization was done using floating‚Äêcone pit design, as discussed below. The pit was 
further optimized by testing the discounted net‚Äêpresent‚Äêvalue of pre-tax cash flow for each pit 
shell with the base case gold price of $1300 per ounce of gold. Cut-off grade was optimized 

at the same time using range of cut-off grades for each of the pit shells. The $1100 per ounce 

pit shell with the cut-off grade increased from the calculated cut-off grade of 0.51 g Au/t to 

0.60 g/t was selected as the base‚Äêcase cut-off for the PEA economic analysis. In theory, all 
material between the internal cut-off grade of 0.42 g Au/t and the selected 0.60 g Au/tonne 

cut-off could be stockpiled and processed after pit ore has been exhausted. Stockpiling of 

low‚Äêgrade has not been included in this study to simplify the calculations and provide a more 
conservative result. Potential stockpile tonnage is 3.2 million tonnes with a grade of 0.55 g 

Au/t, containing 56,000 ounces of gold. Dilution equal to 5% of the open‚Äêpit ore tonnage was 
added with an average of 0.45 g Au/t. 

 

16.1.1 Floating‚ÄêCone Pit Design  
 

Open pits were evaluated using floating‚Äêcone pit design studies at a range of gold prices from 
$800/oz gold to $2000/oz gold to define a series of pit shells for further evaluation, as 

summarized in Table 16.1. It is noted that all of the floating‚Äêcone cases contain from 50% to 
70% inferred material and all of the $1100 Base Case cone must be brought to measured and 

indicated to support prefeasibility and feasibility level design.  



   

192 

 

Table 16.1  

Summary of Floating Cone Results 

 

 
 

Economic parameters for floating‚Äêcone design are summarized in Table 16.2. Contractor 
mining is customary in Spain and contractor mining is assumed for the PEA study, mining 

costs are based on the midpoint cost of three preliminary quotes provided by Spanish mining 

contractors. Other costs are based on estimates prepared for the PEA study.

Haul roads were not designed into the cone shapes, although pit slopes were flattened to 

provide sufficient room for a 20‚Äêmeter haul road at 10% gradient. Inter‚Äêramp slopes were 
based on a recent review of the slope stability by Terratec Geotecnia y Sondeos, S.L.L, of 

Grado, Asturias, Spain. 

 

16.2 UNDERGROUND MINING 
 

Underground mining was evaluated for the PEA study to provide an indication of the 

potential benefit to the project of mining that portion of mineralized material below the open 

pit. However, it is no longer being considered as part of the ongoing feasibility study. 

 

16.3 GEOTECHNICAL AND HYDROLOGICAL PARAMETERS 
 

Geotechnical parameters are based on a preliminary report prepared by Terratec Geotecnia y 

Sondeos, S.L.L, of Grado, Asturias, Spain. A hydrological study was in progress at the time 

of the PEA and no results were available. The results will be utilized in the ongoing 

feasibility study. 

 

16.4 OTHER MINING CONSIDERATIONS 
 

The primary issue for open pit ore production is to maintain adequate production to the plant 

and at the same time minimize dilution and maximize recovery of ore. Particular 

considerations include: 1) maintaining multiple ore faces to allow sufficient time for assaying 

and evaluation of grade control samples; 2) minimize the throw of blasted material during 

blasting; 3) determine whether additional sampling is required beyond the sampling of 

blastholes; 4) optimization of sampling procedures to provide accurate, unbiased samples; 

and 5) introduction of visual recognition of ore by the grade control geologist.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 
 

A 6,000 t/d processing plant was designed for the November 15, 2011 report by Ore 

Reserves Engineering ("ORE") titled "Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the 

Corcoesto Gold Deposit, Galicia, Spain".  Precious metal was recovered in this plant by 

grinding with gravity concentration, flotation, regrinding the gravity and flotation 

concentrates, cyanidation, carbon adsorption, desorption and electrowinning.  The testwork 

described in Section 13 supports this general flowsheet and, as of the date of this technical 

report, is being used in the design of a processing plant of equivalent capacity to the 

contingency level of a feasibility study.  For this technical report, the process plant described 

in the PEA along with associated capital and operating costs are assumed. 

 

17.1 PEA PROCESS PLANT DESCRIPTION 
 

The following description of the process plant has been extracted from the PEA. 

 

Based on the results from these test programs, the optimum gold recovery was achieved by 

combining gravity, flotation and cyanidation of flotation concentrates. The gold recovery 

flowsheet consists of conventional crushing and screening to produce a nominal 6 inch (1500 

mm) product that will be fed to an 11,500 tonne stockpile. 

 

The ore is reclaimed from the stockpile at a feed rate of approximately 250 tonnes per hour 

and ground in a conventional SAG mill and ball mill circuit. The primary cyclone underflow 

is fed to two centrifugal gravity separators to produce a gravity concentrate that is 80 

percent passing 212 microns. The gravity tail is ground in the ball mill circuit and fed to 

rougher flotation at a nominal 80 percent passing 75 microns. 

 

Gold mineralisation is then floated in four rougher and four scavenger cells. The scavenger 

tailing is thickened to 60 percent solids and pumped to the flotation tailings storage facility. 

The rougher and scavenger concentrate is reground to 80 percent passing 53 microns in a 

vertimill. The reground rougher and scavenger concentrate is then floated in two cleaner 

flotation columns to produce a cleaner concentrate and is thickened prior to cyanidation. 

 

The flotation concentrate slurry is combined with the gravity concentrate and cyanide 

leached in a six stage leaching and carbon absorption circuit where 99.5 percent of the 

leachable gold is extracted. The loaded carbon is acid washed to removed deleterious 

contaminates and the gold eluted by hot caustic and cyanide solution. The precious metals 

are then recovery by electrowinning and the metallic precipitate smelted into a final dor√© 

product. 

 

The stripped carbon is reactivated in a kiln, screened to remove fines and added to the 

adsorption columns. The leach tails will be detoxified using sulfur dioxide or sodium meta 

bisulfate, air and copper sulfate to reduce the free cyanide concentration to less than 0.06 

ppm.

17.2 PROCESS FLOWSHEET 
 

The flowsheet presented in Figure 17.1 is a preliminary product of ongoing feasibility level 

plant design.  This flowsheet is as described in Section 17.1 with modification to some of the 

process equipment items.

18.0 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

Engineering designs for project infrastructure are being revised to bring them to feasibility 

study level.  However, as of the date of this technical report, that work is still in progress and, 

until that ongoing work is completed, the following description of project infrastructure, 

summarized from the November, 2011 PEA study by ORE, remains current. 

 

18.1 PLANT SITE AND ACCESS 
 

The Corcoesto project is located in the extreme northwest corner of Spain, within the La 

Coru√±a Province (Galician Community).  It is located approximately 1.5 km east of the small 

village of Corcoesto, approximately 12 km west of the town of Carballo, and approximately 

36 km west‚Äêsouthwest of the port city of La Coru√±a. 
 

Consumables and other supplies will be transported by truck via Route AC‚Äê418 
Carballo‚ÄêBu√±o, AC‚Äê419 Bu√±o‚ÄêPonteceso and along the northern access route CP 1405 from 
Pazos to the plant and facilities location.  Access within the property starts on the west near 

the town of Corcoesto, passes north of the Pozo del Ingl√©s/Pet√≥n de Lobo pit, and then 

follows the mine road south to the plant site.  Chemical storage, warehousing and laydown 

area will be located adjacent to the plant along the east rim of the Rio Lourido drainage.  

Alternative access route from the east could start from the village of Laverde, east of the 

property, then follow north of the waste dump area to the mine road. 

 

The plant site is located east of the pits across the Lourido valley on a flat portion of the 

ridge.  Initially, ore will be hauled to the plant across a causeway, which will be constructed 

with pre-stripping waste rock.  An alternate plant site is on the west side of the Lourido 

valley just south of the Cova Crea pit.  

 

Bulk equipment and supplies will likely be delivered to the port facility and trucked to the 

project site.  While the majority of the national roads and highways are adequately sized to 

accommodate multi‚Äêaxle trucks, many of the local and regional roads must be upgraded to 
allow two‚Äêway travel.  Turn outs and other safety measures must be constructed according to 
national highway safety standards. 

 

18.2 WATER 
 

Raw water will be pumped from regional water sources, such as the Rio Anll√≥ns. 

Alternatively, water may be available from pit dewatering and/or underground workings, rain 

water, and surface flow from the Lourido.  A water intake system, pump and piping system 

will be constructed and be routed along the mine access road to a raw water storage tank 

located near the process plant.  This water supply will serve to provide raw water for raw 

water process needs, the potable water treatment system, and fire suppression water.   

 

In addition, a process water tank will supply make up water to the grinding, flotation, and 

leaching operations within the plant.  Discharge water from the thickeners, tailings storage 



 
 

199 

 

facility decant, and cyanide destruction system will provide make‚Äêup to this tank.  Raw water 
will also be used to make up any shortfall in supply. 

 

18.3 POWER 
 

The regional power distribution grid will provide high voltage power to a sub‚Äêstation located 
near the process plant.  Approximately 10.9 MW of power is estimated to be required to 

support the mining operations.  The power line access route to the sub‚Äêstation will be south 
and west of the Cova Crea pit. 

 

Power will be distributed from the sub‚Äêstation throughout the mine site and processing 
facilities.  An existing power line crosses directly over the Pozo de Ingles/Pet√≥n de Lobo pit 

and the north end of the mine waste rock dump.  This power line must be relocated north of 

the pits and dumps.  

 

18.4 WASTE DUMPS 
 

The mine waste dumps will be constructed in the Rio Lourido valley and will also be 

emplaced on the outside, north‚Äêfacing edge of the tailings dump.  The northern part of the 
waste dump is located not only within a short haul distance to the pits, but will also to 

buttress the tailings dam providing an additional safety factor against dam failure. 

 

Initial mine waste will be used to construct a causeway across the Rio Lourido to the plant 

site and for construction of the tailings starter dam.  As mining progresses, waste rock will be 

dumped southwards, up the Lourido valley, the north and eastward across the face of the 

tailings dam.  Annually, mine waste rock will used to raise the tailings dam.  

 

Surface water in the Lourido drainage may be collected in a small dam at the southern edge 

of the waste rock dump and pumped to the plant for plant makeup water or diverted through 

a small saddle to the adjoining valley to the east.  Waste dumps are constructed with 2.5:1 

slopes to facilitate maintenance and reclamation of the dump slopes.  The mined‚Äêout pits will 
be used for additional dump capacity and it is anticipated that the Cova Crea Pit, the North 

Pits, and a portion of the Pozo del Ingl√©s pit will be available for backfill and mine waste 

storage.  

 

Local contractors have expressed interest in purchasing mine waste rock for use as 

construction aggregate.  While sale of aggregate is possible, this study assumes that there will 

be not aggregate sales and it does not appear that waste rock sales are required for positive 

project economic performance. 

 

18.5 TAILINGS MANAGEMENT FACILITY 
 

Tailings will be stored in a cross‚Äêvalley type tailings management facility (TMF) located in 
the Rego de Batan valley in close proximity to the mining area.  The site was selected 

following an assessment of a number of potential sites in the area.

18.5.1 TMF Design Standards 
 

The design of the TMF will be based on international standards for the design of such 

facilities and generally accepted good practice.  In particular, the design of the TMF will be 

carried out with reference to the following documents: 

ÔÇ∑ European Commission Reference Document on Best Available Techniques for 
Management of Tailings and Waste‚ÄêRock in Mining Activities (EU 2009) 

ÔÇ∑ International Cyanide Management Institute, International Cyanide Management 
Code (ICMI 2011) 

ÔÇ∑ Canadian Dam Association (CDA) Dam Safety Guidelines (CDA 2007) 

ÔÇ∑ International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) ‚Äê Tailings Dams and Seismicity ‚Äê 
Review and Recommendations, Bulletin 98 (ICOLD 1995) 

ÔÇ∑ The Mining Association of Canada (MAC) Guide to the Management of Tailings 
Facilities (MAC 1998) 

 

18.5.2 TMF Design Basis 
 

The general design criteria for the TMF are as follows: 

ÔÇ∑ Annual total tailings production ‚Äê 2,100,000 t including: 

o Annual Flotation tailings production ‚Äì 2,000,000 t 

o Annual CN Leach tailings production ‚Äì 100,000 t 

ÔÇ∑ Separate storage of flotation and leach tailings within the impoundment 

ÔÇ∑ Total tailings production ‚Äê 16,600,000 t 

ÔÇ∑ Mine operating life ‚Äê 8 to 10 years 

ÔÇ∑ Tailings slurry solids concentration ‚Äê 60% (by mass) 

ÔÇ∑ Tailings solids specific gravity ‚Äê 2.7 

ÔÇ∑ Average in situ tailings dry density ‚Äì 1.35 t/m
3
 

ÔÇ∑ Average beach slope ‚Äê 0.5% 

ÔÇ∑ Sufficient storage capacity will be provided within the TMF at all times, to store any 
tailings supernatant water, runoff and the design storm event, in addition to an 

allowance for freeboard. 

ÔÇ∑ The starter facility will be constructed to provide storage capacity for the first 12 
months of tailings production and thereafter the facility will be raised annually. 

ÔÇ∑ The TMF basin area and the upstream slope of the embankment will be fully lined 
with a low permeability liner. 

 



 
 

201 

 

18.5.3 TMF Description 
 

The TMF design includes: 

ÔÇ∑ A cross‚Äêvalley impoundment created by the construction of a single embankment 
dam.  The dam will be extended and raised throughout the life of the facility to ensure 

that there is 

ÔÇ∑ adequate storage capacity at all times.  The dam will be raised using downstream 
construction 

ÔÇ∑ methods and the main waste dump will be located immediately downstream of the 
dam providing an effective buttress to the structure. 

ÔÇ∑ Within the impoundment a separate storage area will be developed for the storage of 
CN leach tailings. 

ÔÇ∑ A basin lining system (extending up the upstream face of the embankment) 
comprising an HDPE geomembrane overlying compacted soil.  A drainage system 

consisting of an interconnected network of perforated pipes will be constructed on top 

of the liner.  Water collected by the under-drainage system will report to vertical, 

reinforced concrete drainage towers, located upstream of the embankment. 

ÔÇ∑ An emergency spillway at each stage of facility development. 

ÔÇ∑ Gravity fed tailings delivery and distribution system (one each for the flotation and 
leach tailings). 

ÔÇ∑ Reclaim water systems comprising barge mounted pumps and HDPE pipelines 
through which supernatant water is returned to the plant. 

ÔÇ∑ A surface water management system comprising a series of channels and diversion 
structures to control runoff from the catchment upstream of the facility. 

ÔÇ∑ Instrumentation for the effective monitoring of the facility during construction, 
operation and post‚Äêclosure. 

 

18.5.4 TMF Layout and Operating Strategy 
 

Initially tailings will be deposited from the main embankment creating a tailings beach that 

slopes downwards towards the south where two supernatant ponds will form, one in each of 

the two valleys.  Water will be reclaimed and returned to the process plant by the barge pump 

located in the southwestern part of the facility.  A second pump will be located in the 

southeastern part of the facility to transfer water to the main pond area in the southwest.  

Once tailings beaches have been established against the embankment, selective deposition of 

tailings will occur from the open‚Äêend discharge points in the south east of the facility. 
Deposition in this area will create a tailings surface that slopes downwards to a single 

low‚Äêlying area in the southwest corner of the facility.  CN leach tailings will be deposited 
separately in an area partitioned off from the main flotation facility area.  

 



 
 

202 

 

18.5.5 TMF Filling Schedule and Capacity 
 

The starter embankment will be constructed to an approximate crest elevation of 150 m, with 

a maximum embankment height of approximately 60 m.  The ultimate embankment crest 

elevation is estimated to be 185 m.  

 

18.5.6 Water Management 
 

 The primary water management objectives are to maximize the recycle of water from the 

facility, maintain the supernatant pond volume and extent within acceptable limits and to 

minimize downstream impacts due to the proposed development.  Best Management 

Practices will be adopted to ensure that all practicable options for control of seepage and 

surface run‚Äêoff are utilized.  In line with commonly accepted good practice in the region, the 
TMF will be lined.  

 

Groundwater wells will be installed downstream of the facility for the purposes of 

monitoring groundwater quality.  Should monitoring indicate that the TMF is adversely 

affecting groundwater quality, these wells will be converted to seepage collection wells, with 

the seepage being pumped back to the facility.  

 

Design provisions to minimize seepage losses from the facility include the following: 

ÔÇ∑ Ultra‚Äêthickening of the tailings prior to discharge to the TMF, thus reducing the 
volume of water discharged to the facility.  

ÔÇ∑ Installation of a low permeability liner system and under‚Äêdrainage system throughout 
the basin area. 

ÔÇ∑ Installation of surface water diversion systems upstream of the facility, to reduce the 
volume of rainfall runoff entering the facility. 

ÔÇ∑ Maximising the reclaim of water from the supernatant water to the plant. 

ÔÇ∑ Maintaining the supernatant pond volume within design limits. 
 

Under normal operating and climatic conditions the facility water balance is expected to be 

neutral and the facility will operate as a 'zero‚Äêdischarge' facility. 
 

A conceptual water balance analysis was completed for the TMF, to estimate the water flows 

into and out of the facility on a monthly basis under average conditions.  The results of the 

analysis suggest that with cut off drainage structures positioned immediately upstream of the 

facility, the facility water balance is negative with make‚Äêup water being required from an 
external source in each month of the year.  Without cut off drainage structures the facility 

water balance is slightly positive with an excess of water in most months other than the 

summer months.  The location and extent of cut off drainage structures will be designed to 

ensure that the facility water balance is neutral or slightly negative so that no release of water 

from the facility is required under normal operating conditions.   

 



 
 

203 

 

18.5.7 Instrumentation, Monitoring and Inspection 
 

Instrumentation will be installed in the TMF embankment and foundations and will be 

monitored during the construction and operation of the TMF.  Monitoring instrumentation 

will include vibrating wire piezometers and settlement cells, groundwater monitoring wells, 

movement monuments, and staff gauges.  

 

As part of the routine operation of the facility, extensive monitoring of all aspects of the 

operation will be undertaken.  Complete details of the monitoring program will be included 

in the Operations Manual that will be produced for the TMF at the detailed design stage.  

Monitoring will be conducted throughout all stages of the life of the facility including 

construction, operation, closure, decommissioning, and post‚Äêclosure. Summary details are 
provided in the following sections. 

 

18.5.8 Reclamation and Closure 
 

Reclamation and closure of the TMF will be based on the following general objectives: 

ÔÇ∑ Reclamation objectives will be incorporated into all aspects and stages of facility 
development including, the design, planning, construction and operation of the 

facility, throughout its operating life. 

ÔÇ∑ Progressive reclamation will be implemented where possible. 

ÔÇ∑ Upon cessation of operations, the TMF will be decommissioned and rehabilitated to: 

o allow for future land use consistent with regional land‚Äêuse objectives or other 
uses as approved by the relevant authorities, 

o ensure that long‚Äêterm physical and chemical stability is provided, 

o manage surface water and drainage paths, 

o protect public health and safety, 

o minimize adverse environmental impacts, 

o meet all legal requirements and comply with all relevant operating licences, 
legislation, policies, codes of practice and commitments to stakeholders. 

 

The primary objective of the reclamation and closure activities will be to transform the TMF 

area to its pre‚Äêmining usage and capability, as much as is reasonably practicable.  The 
envisaged primary closure activities are as follows: 

ÔÇ∑ Removal of all infrastructure that is no longer required.  This would include the 
dismantling and removal of the tailings delivery and reclaim systems and all other 

equipment, the removal and re‚Äêgrading of all access roads, ponds, ditches, borrow 
areas, spoil heaps etc that are not required beyond mine closure. 

ÔÇ∑ Removal of the supernatant ponds (ponds to be pumped dry, water treated to comply 
with  regulations and discharged to the Rio Anll√≥ns). 



 
 

204 

 

ÔÇ∑ Continual pumping out of the under‚Äêdrainage systems, and release of the water 
following treatment if required.  The quantity of water recovered from the 

under‚Äêdrainage systems will reduce with time although it may take several years for 
flows to cease.  At this stage the pump systems and associated pipework will be 

removed and the drainage towers backfilled and sealed. 

ÔÇ∑ Construction of an engineered cover, over the exposed tailings surface using mine 
waste rock. 

ÔÇ∑ Installation of an appropriately designed and constructed surface water drainage 
system. 

ÔÇ∑ Construction of a permanent spillway in the south‚Äêwest corner of the facility and an 
associated outlet channel and energy dissipation structure to convey rainfall water to 

the Rio De Lourido. 

 

The groundwater monitoring wells will be retained for use as long-term monitoring devices. 

Post‚Äêclosure requirements will include an annual inspection of the TMF and ongoing 
monitoring of air and groundwater quality.

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
 

Gold dor√© is easily sold to gold refiners throughout the world and no studies have been 

conducted on gold marketing.  Edgewater does not have any forward contracts or hedging 

programs currently in place and none are anticipated.  

 

Edgewater has opened negotiations with potential contractors for the open pit mining work 

envisaged at Corcoesto.  At the time of writing, however, those negotiations have not yet 

been concluded.  No other material contracts have been entered into regarding development 

or operation of the project.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 

The following sections provide information about the environmental studies and issues, 

waste and water management, permitting, social and community related aspects, and mine 

closure requirements and costs. 

 

20.1 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES AND ISSUES 
 

20.1.1 Baseline Studies and Impact Assessments 
 

Three environmental impact assessments (EIAs) have been completed to date.  The first was 

completed for Rio Narcea Gold Mines S.A. in 2001 with an updated EIA and mine plan 

submitted to the Mining Section of the Provincial Office of Industry and Trade of A Coru√±a 

in 2006.  Kinbauri Gold Corp. held the project from 2007 to 2009 and then it was returned to 

Rio Narcea Gold Mines.  The latest EIA was submitted in 2011 and is in compliance with the 

requirements of Spanish Royal Legislative Decree 1/2008, of 11 January regarding project 

environmental impact assessments. 

 

Baseline environmental and socio-economic studies have been completed to support these 

environmental impact assessments and are continuing as part of compliance with the current 

environmental approval, the Declaration of Environmental Impact (DIA), issued by the 

Galician government.  Additional environmental studies are in progress to support the 

Integrated Environmental Authorization (AAI) and permits for hazardous waste, water 

management and air emissions. 

 

Baseline studies have covered the following components:  

 

ÔÇ∑ Hydrology 

ÔÇ∑ Hydrogeology 

ÔÇ∑ Aquatic resources 

ÔÇ∑ Terrestrial resources 

ÔÇ∑ Air quality 

ÔÇ∑ Cultural and archeological heritage 

ÔÇ∑ Landscape 

ÔÇ∑ Mining wastes characterization 

ÔÇ∑ Socio‚Äêeconomics 
 

20.1.2 Protected Natural Areas 
 

Natura 2000 is the network of natural areas protected across the European Union created 

under Directive 92/43/EEC of the Council, of 21 May 1992, on the conservation of natural 

habitats and of wild fauna and flora (Habitats Directive) in order to safeguard the most 

important natural areas in Europe.  It is comprised of special areas of conservation (SAC) 

declared by the Member States in accordance with the Habitats Directive as well as special 



 
 

207 

 

protection areas for birds (SPA) designated in accordance with the Birds Directive (Directive 

79/09/EC of the Council, of 2 April 1979, on the conservation of wild birds).  The 

development of the Natura 2000 network has been essential to establishing the Galician 

Network of Protected Areas, developed under the scope of Law 9/2001. 

 

The Corcoesto Gold Mining Project includes a mining area near to a zone forming part of the 

Galician Network of Protected Areas (110065 R√≠o Anll√≥ns ZEPVN-SCI) coinciding with the 

R√≠o Anll√≥ns SCI (ES1110015); although the project does not occupy the protected area of the 

SCI. 

 

A total of 12 species included in Annex II of DC 92/43/EEC are present in the River Anll√≥ns 

SCI and 15 from Annex IV. Among the fishes living there, Petromyzon marinus and 

Chondrostoma nuriense are of Community interest. The aquatic mammals, Galemys 

pyrenaicus and Lutra lutra, are also found there.  In addition, seven taxons of birds from 

Annex I of DC 2009/147/EC are observed, such as Alcedo athis and Sylvia undata. 

 

The River Anll√≥ns SCI in the zone near the mining area is classified as a Moderate Usage 

Zone (ZPDG-4), corresponding to territories with average conservation value.  It is a mosaic 

area, in which anthropic and semi-natural environments predominate.  In the immediate 

surroundings of the project area, the conservation value of the River Anll√≥ns SCI shows a 

predominance of the high-very high classification, with isolated areas valued as low. 

 

In summary, the project is located adjacent to the Natura 2000 site along the Anll√≥ns River.  

Project works should not extend within the riparian areas of the river and discharges from the 

mine need to be of good quality to protect the river and riparian habitat. 

 

20.1.3 Mine Waste Management 
 

Waste and tailings disposal is regulated by Directive 2006/21/EC of the European Parliament 

and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the management of waste from extractive industries, 

amending Directive 2004/35/EC.  Spain has incorporated this Directive as Royal Decree 

975/2009 on the management of waste from extractive industries and the rehabilitation of the 

areas altered by mining activities.  This regulation sets what studies are required for the 

construction and permitting of the facilities for disposal of mining waste and processing 

tailings.  There is also the European Commission Reference Document on Best Available 

Techniques for Management of Tailings and Waste‚ÄêRock in Mining Activities (EU 2009). 
 

Waste rock will be disposed of in the waste rock dump in the Lourido valley downslope of 

the tailings impoundments and in the open pits as they are progressively mined.  Potentially 

acid generating and metal leaching rock will be segregated and preferentially disposed of in 

the open pits and then in designated areas within the waste rock dump.  Measures such as 

progressive capping, limestone addition, and wetland creation will be used to protect the 

receiving environment.   

 



 
 

208 

 

In the process plant, the absence of metal sulphides competing with gold in the cyanidation 

will allow low cyanide consumption and favour the option of preconcentration through 

gravity separation or flotation.  This preconcentration will make it possible to reduce the 

tonnage of ore to which cyanidation will be applied, appreciably reducing cyanide 

consumption.  Leach process tailings will be treated to destroy the cyanide before transfer to 

the leach tailings pond. 

 

Two lined tailings impoundments are proposed in the upper Lourido valley with full water 

recycle to the plant and will operate as no discharge facilities.  At closure, the impoundments 

will be drained and capped for long-term storage.  Tailings water from dewatering at closure 

will be treated prior to release. 

 

20.1.4 Water Management 
 

The overall water balance for the project shows that even in the wettest year, no discharge 

will be necessary from the tailings dam. 

 

The process plant will include two water treatment components.  One will include cyanide 

destruction of the leach tailings prior to discharge to the leach tailings impoundment.  

Reclaim water from the leach tailings will also be treated using a biological reactor to reduce 

ammonia and nitrates prior to reuse in the process plant. 

 

There are five water discharge points not related to the tailings pond that are proposed as part 

of the overall water management plan outlined in the environmental impact assessment.  Two 

of these collect water from superficial drainage and site runoff and only require collection 

and retention to settle out suspended solids before being discharged.  A third collection pond 

will receive water from the plant site.  An oil trap will be employed in the runoff collection 

system to remove hydrocarbons and suspended sediments will be removed in the settling 

pond prior to discharge to the small tributary flowing west from the plant site. 

 

The fourth discharge point is immediately downstream of the waste rock dump.  Seepage and 

surficial runoff from the waste rock dump will be collected in a pond where suspended 

sediments will settle out.  Water will then be discharged to Lourido Creek via a passive water 

treatment system (wetland) given the potential for metal leaching from the waste rock.   

 

The fifth discharge is for treated sewage water.  Sewage will be treated with a digestor and 

biological filtration.  The sewage treatment system will be sized based on the final number of 

workers on site. 

 

20.2 PERMITTING 
 

The project is subject to legislation in Galicia, Spain and the European Union (EU).  EU 

regulations are directly enforceable by law and EU directives are integrated into regulations 

in each member state.  Project management also needs to be mindful of international 



 
 

209 

 

conventions that are customary international law or to which Spain and the European Union 

are signatory. 

 

Mineira de Corcoesto, S.L. received environmental approval to develop the Corcoesto 

Project, as authorized in their Declaration of Impact Assessment (DIA) in November 2012.  

The approval was based on the project design submitted in June 2011.  In addition, the 

Corcoesto Project is being advanced as a strategic industrial project by the Galician 

government.   

 

The DIA includes a listing of the required environmental and social mitigation, management 

and compensation provisions and conditions for development of the mine.  As one of the 

conditions, the company is required to adhere to the International Cyanide Management 

Code (ICMC) and comply with the principles and established procedural standards.  The 

company will also need to be registered as a Small Producer of Hazardous Waste. 

 

There are a number of permits to be obtained specific to areas of mining, municipal works, 

construction, waste management, air emissions, and water use, management and discharges.  

The next significant permit to be obtained is the Integrated Environmental Authorization for 

the tailings impoundments and plant. 

 

20.3 SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY ASPECTS 
 

The project is located in parts of the municipalities of Cabana de Berganti√±os and Coristanco 

and 6 km ESE of the municipality of Ponteceso. The mineralised structures are distributed 

along a strip 2.5 km long by 1.5 km wide running NE and located to the east of the parish of 

Corcoesto. 

 

The company has and will continue to consult with the provincial authorities, local 

community, collectives and stakeholders.  Discussions to date have mainly focused on land 

acquisition and continued free access to water supply for locals who will be affected by mine 

development.  A new water supply will be provided free of charge for affected residents 

(approximately 228 people).  Corcoesto has presented offers to acquire, fairly compensate for 

land and provide opportunities for repurchase of unaffected lands at minimal cost following 

closure.  Discussions and negotiations are ongoing as the project progresses.  Consultation 

and discussions have also included issues regarding employment, contracting opportunities 

and environmental concerns about water and air quality.    

 

Socio-economic benefits will accrue through job creation, economic investment, effect on the 

wealth of the municipalities in the area and the generation of public income through social 

security contributions, charges and taxes. 

 

20.4 MINE CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
 

A conceptual mine closure and reclamation plan was included in the environmental impact 

assessment.  The objectives of the plan are to rehabilitate the project to ensure physical and 



 
 

210 

 

chemical stability and to create productive and sustainable use of the land post-closure, likely 

mixed coniferous forest and agricultural land depending on consultation with locals and 

government. 

 

Mine closure costs will be finalized and agreed with government agencies to determine the 

financial security requirements.  A financial security will need to be posted at the beginning 

of construction to cover estimated closure costs.  A portion of the closure cost is based on 

area of disturbance and is updated annually.  The base amount required is approximately 

‚Ç¨20,000/ha.  The security also needs to include closure costs for the plant and closure costs 

for tailings storage facility which includes all cover costs.   

 

Details of the structure of the financial security are still being determined.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
 

As part of the ongoing feasibility study, revised estimates of capital and operating costs will 

be prepared, however, that work is not yet complete, so the content of this section is 

summarised from the November, 2011 PEA by ORE.  

 

Process design criteria were developed using the metallurgical test data described previously 

supplemented by a few assumptions based on similar types of gold recovery processes.  

These data were also used to create the process flowsheet, conceptual operating costs, and a 

mechanical equipment list.  In‚Äêcountry unit rates were provided by RNGM staff for utilities 
labour and other consumables where possible.  Capital costs were developed for major 

process equipment items using mining industry cost estimation services and recent data from 

similar projects.  Minor equipment items, construction and installation costs were factored 

based on mining industry practices.  Both the capital and operating cost estimates should be 

considered preliminary, and to have a ¬± 35% accuracy.  Labour and staffing levels were 

provided by Rio Narcea based on similar operations in Spain. 

 

21.1 OPERATING COSTS 
 

21.1.1 Labour and Staffing 
 

Labour and staffing were provided by RNGM based on similar operations in Spain.  A 

summary of staffing levels and costs by department is shown in Table 21.1. 

 
Table 21.1  

Summary of Staffing and Annual Salaries  

 

 
 



 
 

212 

 

21.1.2 Mining 
 

The cost of open pit mining is based on the middle of three mining costs provided by Spanish 

mining contractors, as summarized in Table 21.2.  An additional US$0.58/t was added to the 

ore mining cost for engineering, geology, and grade control.  The costs for assaying of grade 

control samples are included in the plant laboratory costs. 

 
Table 21.2  

Summary of Staffing and Annual Salaries  

 

 
 

Operating costs for underground production are estimated as US$40/t ore based on similar 

sized and type operations in Spain. 

 

21.1.3 Processing 
 

Operating costs were developed for the major cost centers associated with the operation of a 

gold processing facility.  Power requirements were developed from the motor information 

provided with the mechanical equipment list with a 15% increase to account for ancillary 

equipment.  

 

An estimated labour force of 88 people was provided by RNGM staff based on labour 

requirements for similar gold processing facilities within Spain.  Salary and benefit rates 

were also provided by RNGM staff using the same basis.  

 

Reagent consumption was calculated from the metallurgical test program, with assumptions 

made for the gold elution chemical consumption.  Unit rates for these chemicals were 

provided by RNGM staff.  

 

Consumable supplies, primarily crushing and grinding wear liners, and grinding media were 

calculated from the bond work index testing.  Miscellaneous operating and maintenance 

supplies were factored as well as the unit costs.  

 

The overall gold processing costs are estimated to be ‚Ç¨10.6/t ore, excluding the costs for 

tailings disposal and dor√© refining and sales.  Details of the process operation costs are 

summarized in Table 21.3 and Table 21.4.

Table 21.4  

Plant Operating Costs Part 2‚Äì Reagents, Consumables, and Equipment 

 

 
 

21.1.4 Tailings Management 
 

Tailings management operating costs were estimated as US$1.00/t ore based on experience 

with similar operations. 

 

21.1.5 General and Administrative 
 

G&A costs were estimated as US$1.15/t ore, which includes US$0.60/t ore for labor costs, 

plus an allowance of US$0.55/t for other G&A costs. 

 

21.1.6 Reclamation 
 

All reclamation costs were assigned to capital. 

 

21.2 CAPITAL COSTS 
 

21.2.1 Mining 
 

Since mining is based on contract mining, there are no capital expenditures for mining 

equipment.  US$5,040,000 for preproduction stripping is capitalized in the final year of 

construction to provide waste rock for tailings dam construction.  US$9,000,000 is allocated 



 
 

215 

 

for pit and underground drilling to define sufficient measured and indicated resources for 

feasibility level ore reserves.  US$15,500,000 is allocated at US$4,140 per metre for 

underground drifting and development.  This capital amount will establish the 1,500 m main 

ramp from the east portal plus exploration and development workings.   

 

21.2.2 Processing 
 

A mechanical equipment list was developed using a 6,000 t/d design basis for the process 

flowsheet.  The largest capital costs is associated with the grinding circuit which the SAG 

and Ball Mills comprising most of the cost.  Construction and installation costs were factored 

by 3.2 which is consistent with industry standards.  A summary of these cost are shown in 

Table 21.5. 

 
Table 21.5  

Plant Capital Expenditure Summary 

 

 
 

Several of the specific equipment costs may change as the metallurgical data are further 

refined to provide updated design criteria. 

 

21.2.3 Electrical Power 
 

US$500,000 is allocated to reroute 5 km of the existing power line that passes over the Pozo 

del Ingl√©s and Pet√≥n de Lobo pits.  US$3,500,000 is allocate for the plant substation.  These 

costs are based on quotations from the local power company. 

 

21.2.4 Tailings Management 
 

US$32,851,000 is estimated for the capital costs of the tailings facility over the life the 

operation. Of this, US$10,626,000 is expended in the last year of preproduction for the starter 

dam facility and US$3,665,000 is expended in all but the last year of production to pay for 

continued expansion of the tailings facility. 

 

  



 
 

216 

 

21.2.5 Reclamation 
 

A total of 341 ha of disturbed area is projected over the life of the project including pits, 

waste dumps, and the tailings facility.  The cost of reclamation is estimated at US$28/ha for a 

total of US$10,569,000. 25% of reclamation costs are allocated during production and 

US$7,297,000 is allocated to the year after production.   

  



 
 

217 

 

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 

As part of the ongoing feasibility study, a revised economic analysis of the project will be 

prepared; however, that work is not yet complete, so the content of this section is 

summarised from the November, 2011 PEA by ORE.  Note that this economic analysis is 

based on the previous mineral resource estimate, as presented in the November, 2011 PEA.   

 

22.1 ASSUMPTIONS 
 

This economic analysis is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources that are 

insufficiently defined by drilling and sampling to be classified as measured and indicated 

resources.  These inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to 

have economic considerations applied to them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and 

there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized.  In addition, 

the economic is based on forward‚Äêlooking price, costs, and engineering estimates that may 
differ significantly from the actual values.  A gold price of US$1,300 per ounce gold was 

used for this study, which was the equal to the 30‚Äêmonth trailing‚Äêaverage gold price at the 
end of November 2011.  The spot gold price at the time of the study was over US$1,700 per 

ounce gold, but it is industry to use the lower trailing average price for reserve and resource 

studies.  Discounted cash flow was computed using a discount rate of 5%.  The economic 

study and cash flow analysis was done on a pretax basis.  The Spanish corporate tax rate is 

30%, but the impact of taxes on the project would be much less after allowances for 

depreciation, possible government subsidies for development investments, and the corporate 

structure of the local and international corporations.  It is assumed that Edgewater will 

exercise their right to purchase part of the Lundin royalty and the royalty rate will be 0.5% of 

sales.  The operating and capital costs discussed previously were used for the economic 

analysis.  The production schedule and recovery assumptions are also discussed previously in 

the mining and processing sections.  A three year schedule was assumed for preproduction, 

which would include drilling to define a sufficient measured and indicated reserve base, 

engineering studies, environmental studies and permitting, and construction of the plant and 

other facilities.  This schedule is possible, but will require careful management to prevent 

time delays and/or budget creep.  

 

22.2 CASH FLOW STUDY AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 
 

Annual pre‚Äêtax net cash flow is presented in Table 22.1 and Table 22.2.  The summary of 
economic performance indicators and sensitivity to key variables is shown in Table 22.3.  

The base case cash‚Äêflow analysis shows a net present value at 5% interest rate of US$206 
million, a payback of 3.4 years, and an internal rate of return of 24%.  Sensitivity cases for 

gold price, capital cost, operating cost, and ore grade all show positive NPV and rate of 

return.  Economic performance is least sensitive to capital and operating costs and is most 

sensitive to gold price and gold grade.  An additional sensitivity case was done for 

underground ore tonnage, which was based on relatively gross assumptions.  Economic 

performance is relatively insensitive to underground tonnage, although the opportunity for 

underground mining definitely improves project outlook.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

25.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The Corcoesto Gold Project is a late‚Äêstage exploration deposit located in Galicia in the 
northeast corner of Spain.  Ownership is held under 3 exploitation concessions owned by 

Mineira de Corcoesto, S.L. (MDC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Edgewater Exploration Ltd 

(Edgewater).  Edgewater and Lundin executed the final and definitive Purchase and Sale 

Agreement on the purchase of Rio Narcea Gold Mines SL (RNGM) from Lundin on July 27, 

2010.  At that time, the prior owner, Lundin Mining Corporation (Lundin), retained a 1.5% 

Net Smelter Return (NSR) Royalty upon the commencement of commercial production from 

the Corcoesto Gold Project subject to Edgewater having the right to re-purchase 1.0% of the 

royalty at any time after Closing for US$1,000,000.  On September 24, 2012 Edgewater sold 

the right to re-purchase 1.0% of the existing 1.5% NSR and created and sold a new 1.0% 

NSR royalty upon commercial production.  The Corcoesto Gold will be subject to a total 

NSR royalty on commercial production of 2.5%.  There are no further royalties on the 

property, although there is a minimal "surface canon" payment in effect that is not a royalty.   

 

The primary aim of this report was to present an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the 

Corcoesto Project.  Micon has reported a Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource of 

14.9 Mt at an average grade of 1.34 g/t Au and 9.3 Mt at an average grade of 1.28 g/t 

respectively, plus an Inferred Mineral Resource of approximately 5.3 Mt at an average grade 

1.21 g/t Au.  Micon considers the above estimate to convey the tonnage and grade 

determined to be present to date in an appropriate manner and to have been derived using 

appropriate methodologies and protocols.   

 

25.2 GEOLOGY AND MINERALISATION 
 

Gold mineralisation at Corcoesto is located in quartz‚Äêarsenopyrite veins and is highly 
structurally controlled by N70E‚Äêtrending extensional zones.  Exploration has been successful 
at locating and defining gold resources using a combination of geochemical soils sampling, 

trenching, geologic mapping, and diamond drilling.   

 

Based on the exploration work, including a total of 1,101.9 m of surface trenching in 55 

trenches, 443.1 m of adit sampling in 4 adits, and 89,552.63 m of (accepted) diamond and 

RC drilling in 606 drill holes, sufficient information has been assembled to identify the five 

main mineralised zones of Pozo del Ingl√©s, Cova Crea, Pet√≥n de Lobo, Picotos, 

Fonterremula, and Montefurado. The trench and drill hole samples have been logged in detail 

for the geological characteristics and have been assayed for gold and arsenic using 

conventional fire assaying for gold and AA for arsenic.   

 

The trench and drill samples have been used to create a 3D model of the mineralised zones, 

based on Au grade >300 ppb, for use in resource estimation. The mineral resource for the 

Corcoesto deposit was estimated using a combination of inverse distance weighting (IDW) 

and Ordinary Kriging (OK) estimation within the mineral zone block model. There is 



 
 

224 

 

sufficient sampling to define Measured mineral resources in the more densely drilled portions 

of the Cova Crea, Pozo del Ingl√©s, and Pet√≥n de Lobo only within an optimized pit defined 

with US$1,400/oz gold. Micon has been able to classify the mineral resources in the 

Measured (52%), Indicated (31%), and Inferred (17%) categories, mainly on the basis of 

grade continuity and the relative density of the data.   

 

Based on its review of various reports, QAQC procedures, and audits, Micon considers that 

the procedures used for drilling, sampling, and analysis, conducted on the project are 

acceptable for estimating a mineral resource. The Edgewater drilling data, that represents the 

majority of the data, is complete and conducted using standard exploration techniques.   

 

Micon has highlighted that the QC protocol at Corcoesto, during Edgewater's period, had 

some deficiencies (lack of CRM/standard analysis) but that, overall, the laboratory analytical 

results meet industry standards. Notwithstanding, Edgewater dispatched several 

consignments of coarse duplicate samples for external analysis at an umpire laboratory and 

has had access to the internal QC analysis (including CRM) completed by ALS as part of 

their standard internal procedures.   

 

All drill core is stored in purpose built wooden boxes with appropriate nomenclature to 

indicate the drill hole details including hole ID, box number, metreage, etc. The data 

submitted to Micon appear reliable in light of the checks performed with no major flaws 

identified during the audit procedures.  Micon completed an independent check analysis of 

selected coarse duplicates, which included CRM samples, which performed as expected.   

 

Micon's review found that the degree of geological evaluation by Edgewater personnel is 

reasonable and that the geology, mineral controls and geometry of the mineralised zones are 

adequately delineated from exploration work.  Mineralised interpretation is rational, with 

consistent correlation of mineral zones between cross sections.  However, the mineralisation 

at Corcoesto can sometimes be unpredictable, or where there is limited data, and in these 

instances difficult to interpret.  Notwithstanding, Micon concludes that the Corcoesto mineral 

resource modelling has been conducted using industry standard procedures and is believed to 

reasonably represent the deposit tonnage and gold grade.  Micon believes that the mineral 

resource model is an acceptable basis for the subsequent estimation of ore/mineral reserves.   

 

25.3 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 

The Corcoesto mineral resource has been prepared in accordance with the guidelines of the 

JORC Code (2012), an accepted reporting code in terms of Canadian National Instrument 43-

101.   

 

The reported mineral resources lie within (i.e. are constrained by) an open pit optimization 

shell generated using a gold metal price of US$1,400/oz along with other basic economic and 

technical parameters as summarised in Section 14.15. In Micon's opinion, the reported 

mineral resources thus satisfy the requirement for having reasonable prospects for economic 

extraction.   



 
 

225 

 

In summary, and constrained within the conceptual open pit (US$1,400/oz) at a COG of 

0.5g/t Au, the mineral resource equates to a Measured resource of 14.9 Mt at 1.34 g/t Au 

(644 koz), Indicated resource of 9.3 Mt at 1.28 g/t Au (383 koz), and an Inferred resource of 

5.3 Mt at 1.21 g/t Au (207 koz), as summarised in Table 25.1.

Notes: 

1. Mineral resources were classified following the guidelines of the JORC Code (2012) an accepted 
reporting code in terms of Canadian National Instrument 43-101.   

2. A cut-off grade of 0.5g/t Au was applied.   
3. Mineral resources are constrained within a Whittle pit shell based on a gold price of US$1,400/oz.   
4. Numbers may not compute due to rounding.   
5. All grades have been quoted in grams per tonne (g/t) for the resource inventory.   
6. Density values were assigned with relevance to an oxide surface, no distinction of fresh and oxide 

material has been made within this resource estimate.   

7. There are no known legal, political, environmental or other risks that could materially affect the 
potential development of these mineral resources.

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

The Corcoesto deposit has been explored over a protracted period of time with over 600 drill 

holes being completed.  The geological setting and structural characteristics are well 

understood and mineralisation relatively predictable.   

 

The mineralised zones included in the current mineral resource estimate are reasonably well 

understood and the strike extents typically known from the current exploration.  However, 

some (areas) remain open, particularly at depth, and subject to continued positive exploration 

may increase the current mineral resource.   

 

Edgewater should consider an infill drilling program in the northern zones of Montefurado, 

where there are currently no Measured and Indicated resources, Fonterremula, where only 

minimal Indicated resource are present, and Picotos (no Measured resources), to improve 

data density and seek conversion into higher category resources.  Additional drilling in the 

main zones (Cova Crea, Pet√≥n de Lobo, and Pozo del Ingl√©s) should also be considered to 

infill low data density areas and provide increased confidence in some of the peripheral 

areas.  The open ended portions of the currently defined mineralised zones, both along strike 

and down dip, have the potential to expand the current resource subject to positive results. 

 

A budget for additional drilling is presented in Table 26.1.   

 
Table 26.1  

Tasks and Budget Recommended for Additional Drilling 

 

Task Unit Price Units Budget (US$) 

Target Preparation (includes permits)   50,000 

Surveying US$1,000/day 20 days 20,000 

Diamond Drilling US$200/m 8,500 m 1,700,000 

Assays US$40/sample 1,000 samples 40,000 

Salaries US$8,000/month 6 months 48,000 

Logistics (lodging, fuel, food, consumables) US$5,000/month 6 months 30,000 

Land Access   62,000 

Additional Technical Studies   50,000 

Contingency (10%)   200,000 

Total   2,200,000 

 

The complexity and frequency of mineralised quartz veins makes it difficult to interpret and 

model the quartz veins individually with sufficient confidence.  In addition to this, the large 

numbers of very thin veins (that can contain appreciable gold grades) mean that model blocks 

have to be generated so that they include these veins.  In previous studies, multiple-indicator 

modelling approaches (MIK) have been applied and are considered to be a logical approach 

given the complications owing to the complexity and frequency of the quartz veins.  The 

MIK method produces ore proportions and associated grades within an individual block.  A 

dynamic anisotropy method of directly modelling the veins from the grade data, and using 

variable strike orientations, should be considered as a comparison.

Certificate of Analysis 
Low Gold Material ‚Äì AuBlank58 
Product contains less than 0.002 ppm gold. 

Date of certification: 20 March 2013 

The above value applies to product in sachets that have the identification number 279 270.

A mixture of finely pulverized feldspars and basalt that had previously been analysed and found 
to have a low gold content was placed into sachets in a gold-free environment.  To the best of 
our knowledge the component materials have been obtained from areas where no gold has 
previously been mined and have been crushed and pulverized through machinery that has not 
been used for the treatment of gold ore.  A total of 3821 sachets were filled with 52g of 
material.  24 sachets were selected at regular intervals from the packaging run and were 
submitted to a laboratory that specializes in low-level analysis for gold.  The samples were 
analysed by aqua regia digestion followed by enhanced graphite furnace atomic absorption 
spectroscopy.  The average of the 24 analyses was 0.37 parts per billion gold, with the highest 
value being 1.1 parts per billion gold. 
We certify the material at a level that is double the highest gold value obtained in the samples 
analysed.  It is thus certified as less than 0.002 ppm gold. 

A copy of the analytical report from the independent laboratory is available on request.

Certificate of Analysis, ROCKLABS Reference Material SJ63.  9 March 2012.   Page 2 of 6. 

Description: The reference material is a light grey powder that has been 
well mixed and a homogeneity test carried out after the entire 
batch was packaged into wide-mouthed jars.  There is no soil 
component.  The product contains crystalline quartz and 
therefore dust from it should not be inhaled. 

 

 
The approximate chemical composition is: 

(Uncertified Values) 
  % 
 SiO2 55.25 
 Al2O3 16.43 
 Na2O 4.85 
 K2O 4.48 
 CaO 3.60 
 MgO 3.07 
 TiO2 0.91 
 MnO 0.06 
 P2O5 0.23 
 Fe2O3 4.71 
 Fe 2.7 
 S 3.0 

 

Intended Use: 

 

 

This reference material is designed to be included with every 
batch of samples analysed and the results plotted for quality 
monitoring and assessment purposes. 

Stability: The container (jar or sachet) should not be heated to 
temperatures higher than 50 ¬∞C.  Iron pyrites are likely to 
oxidize in the air but tests have shown that the increase in 
weight of an exposed reference material of similar matrix, in 
the Auckland climate, is less than 0.1% per year. 

  

Method of Preparation:  Pulverized feldspar minerals, basalt rock and barren iron 
pyrites were blended with finely pulverized and screened 
gold-containing minerals.  Once the powders were uniformly 
mixed the composite was placed into 2589 wide-mouthed 
jars, each bearing a unique number.  54 jars were randomly 
selected from the packaging run and material from these jars 
was used for both homogeneity and consensus testing. 

  
 
 
 



 

Certificate of Analysis, ROCKLABS Reference Material SJ63.  9 March 2012.   Page 3 of 6. 

 
Homogeneity Assessment: 

An independent laboratory carried out gold analysis by fire assay of 30 g portions, 
using a gravimetric finish.  Steps were taken to minimize laboratory method variation 
in order to better detect any variation in the candidate reference material. 
The contents of six randomly selected jars were compacted by vibration (to simulate 
the effect of freighting) and five samples removed successively from top to bottom 
from each jar.  In addition, five samples were removed from the last jar in the series.  
A sample was also removed from the top of each of the 54 jars randomly selected 
from the 2589 jars in the batch.  The results of analysis of the 89 samples (randomly 
ordered and then consecutively numbered before being sent to the laboratory) 
produced a relative standard deviation of 0.8 %.     
 

Analytical Methodology: 
Once homogeneity had been established, two sub-samples were submitted to a 
number of well-recognized laboratories in order to assign a gold value by consensus 
testing.  The sub-samples were drawn from the 54 randomly selected jars and each 
laboratory received samples from two different jars.  Indicative concentration ranges 
were given.  All laboratories used fire assay for the gold analysis, with most using an 
instrument finish and 3 using a gravimetric finish. 

 
Calculation of Certified Value: 

Results for gold were returned from 49 laboratories.  Statistical analysis to identify 
outliers was carried out using the principles detailed in sections 7.3.2 ‚Äì 7.3.4, ISO 
5725-2: 1994.  Assessment of each laboratory's performance was carried out on the 
basis of z-scores, partly based on the concept described in ISO/IEC Guide 43-1.    
Details of the criteria used in these examinations are available on request.  As a result 
of these statistical analyses, seven sets of results were excluded for the purpose of 
assigning a gold concentration value to this reference material.  A recommended 
value was thus calculated from the average of the remaining n = 42 sets of replicate 
results.  The 95 % confidence interval was estimated using the formula:- 

X ¬± ts/ÔøΩn 
(where X is the estimated average, s is the estimated standard deviation of the 
laboratory averages, and t is the 0.025 tail-value from Student's t-distribution with n-
1 degrees of freedom).  The recommended value is provided at the beginning of the 
certificate in Œºg/g (ppm) units.  A summary of the results used to calculate the 
recommended value is listed on page 4 and the names of the laboratories that 
submitted results are listed on page 5.  The results are listed in increasing order of the 
individual laboratory averages.   
 
Statistical analysis of the consensus test results has been carried out by independent 
statistician, Tim Ball.

Instructions and Recommendations for Use:  

Weigh out quantity usually used for analysis and analyze for total gold by normal 
procedure.  Homogeneity testing has shown that consistent results are obtainable for gold 
when 30g portions are taken for analysis.   

 

We quote a 95% confidence interval for our estimate of the declared value. This 
confidence interval reflects our uncertainty in estimating the true value for the gold 
content of the reference material. The interval is chosen such that, if the same procedure as 
used here to estimate the declared value were used again and again, then 95% of the trials 
would give intervals that contained the true value. It is a reflection of how precise the trial 
has been in estimating the declared value. It does not reflect the variability any particular 
laboratory will experience in its own repetitive testing. 
 
Some users in the past have misinterpreted this confidence interval as a guide as to how 
different an individual test result should be from the declared value. Some mistakenly use 
this interval, or the standard deviation from the consensus test, to set limits for control 
charts on their own routine test results using the reference material. Such use inevitably 
leads to many apparent out-of-control points, leading to doubts about the laboratory's 
testing, or of the reference material itself.  
A much better way of determining the laboratory performance when analysing the 
reference material is to accumulate a history of the test results obtained, and plot them on a 
control chart. The appropriate centre line and control limits for this chart should be based 
on the average level and variability exhibited in the laboratory's own data. This chart will 
provide a clear picture of the long-term stability or otherwise of the laboratory testing 
process, providing good clues as to the causes of any problems. To help our customers do 
this, we can provide a free Excel template that will produce sensible graphs, with 
intelligently chosen limits, from the customer's own data.

outliers was carried out using the principles detailed in sections 7.3.2 ‚Äì 7.3.4, ISO 
5725-2: 1994.  Assessment of each laboratory's performance was carried out on the 
basis of z-scores, partly based on the concept described in ISO/IEC Guide 43-1.    
Details of the criteria used in these examinations are available on request.  As a result 
of these statistical analyses, nine sets of results were excluded for the purpose of 
assigning a gold concentration value to this reference material.  A recommended 
value was thus calculated from the average of the remaining n = 41 sets of replicate 
results.  The 95 % confidence interval was estimated using the formula:- 

X ¬± ts/ÔøΩn 
(where X is the estimated average, s is the estimated standard deviation of the 
laboratory averages, and t is the 0.025 tail-value from Student's t-distribution with n-
1 degrees of freedom).  The recommended value is provided at the beginning of the 
certificate in Œºg/g (ppm) units.  A summary of the results used to calculate the 
recommended value is listed on page 4 and the names of the laboratories that 
submitted results are listed on page 5.  The results are listed in increasing order of the 
individual laboratory averages.   
 
Statistical analysis of the consensus test results has been carried out by independent 
statistician, Tim Ball.

Instructions and Recommendations for Use:  
Weigh out quantity usually used for analysis and analyze for total gold by normal 
procedure.  Homogeneity testing has shown that consistent results are obtainable for gold 
when 30g portions are taken for analysis.   

 

We quote a 95% confidence interval for our estimate of the declared value. This 
confidence interval reflects our uncertainty in estimating the true value for the gold 
content of the reference material. The interval is chosen such that, if the same procedure as 
used here to estimate the declared value were used again and again, then 95% of the trials 
would give intervals that contained the true value. It is a reflection of how precise the trial 
has been in estimating the declared value. It does not reflect the variability any particular 
laboratory will experience in its own repetitive testing. 
 
Some users in the past have misinterpreted this confidence interval as a guide as to how 
different an individual test result should be from the declared value. Some mistakenly use 
this interval, or the standard deviation from the consensus test, to set limits for control 
charts on their own routine test results using the reference material. Such use inevitably 
leads to many apparent out-of-control points, leading to doubts about the laboratory's 
testing, or of the reference material itself.  
A much better way of determining the laboratory performance when analysing the 
reference material is to accumulate a history of the test results obtained, and plot them on a 
control chart. The appropriate centre line and control limits for this chart should be based 
on the average level and variability exhibited in the laboratory's own data. This chart will 
provide a clear picture of the long-term stability or otherwise of the laboratory testing 
process, providing good clues as to the causes of any problems. To help our customers do 
this, we can provide a free Excel template that will produce sensible graphs, with 
intelligently chosen limits, from the customer's own data.

Description: The reference material is a light grey powder that has been 
well mixed and a homogeneity test carried out after the entire 
batch was packaged into wide-mouthed jars.  There is no soil 
component.  The product contains crystalline quartz and 
therefore dust from it should not be inhaled. 

 

 
The approximate chemical composition is: 

(Uncertified Values) 
  % 
 SiO2 54.76 
 Al2O3 15.92 
 Na2O 4.10 
 K2O 5.11 
 CaO 3.96 
 MgO 3.97 
 TiO2 1.06 
 MnO 0.07 
 P2O5 0.25 
 Fe2O3 5.58 
 Fe 2.1 
 S 2.3 

 

Intended Use: 

 

 

This reference material is designed to be included with every 
batch of samples analysed and the results plotted for quality 
monitoring and assessment purposes. 

Stability: The container (jar or sachet) should not be heated to 
temperatures higher than 50 ¬∞C.  Iron pyrites are likely to 
oxidize in the air but tests have shown that the increase in 
weight of an exposed reference material of similar matrix, in 
the Auckland climate, is less than 0.1% per year. 

  

Method of Preparation:  Pulverized feldspar minerals, basalt rock and barren iron 
pyrites were blended with finely pulverized and screened 
gold-containing minerals.  Once the powders were uniformly 
mixed the composite was placed into 3460 wide-mouthed 
jars, each bearing a unique number.  60 jars were randomly 
selected from the packaging run and material from these jars 
was used for both homogeneity and consensus testing.

Homogeneity Assessment: 

An independent laboratory carried out gold analysis by fire assay of 30 g portions, 
using an ICP finish.  Steps were taken to minimize laboratory method variation in 
order to better detect any variation in the candidate reference material. 
The contents of six randomly selected jars were compacted by vibration (to simulate 
the effect of freighting) and five samples removed successively from top to bottom 
from each jar.  In addition, five samples were removed from the last jar in the series.  
A sample was also removed from the top of each of the 60 jars randomly selected 
from the 3460 jars in the batch.  Analysis of the 95 samples (randomly ordered and 
then consecutively numbered before being sent to the laboratory) contained two 
results that were anomalous.  Multiple analyses on samples from the same two jars 
that originally provided the anomalous results were carried out. No further anomalous 
results were obtained, so the first two results were disregarded.  The remaining 93 
original results produced a relative standard deviation of 1.0 %.     
 

Analytical Methodology: 
Once homogeneity had been established, two sub-samples were submitted to a 
number of well-recognized laboratories in order to assign a gold value by consensus 
testing.  The sub-samples were drawn from the 60 randomly selected jars and each 
laboratory received samples from two different jars.  Indicative concentration ranges 
were given.  All laboratories used fire assay for the gold analysis, with most using an 
instrument finish and three using a gravimetric finish. 

 
Calculation of Certified Value: 

Results for gold were returned from 53 laboratories, with one laboratory returning 
one set of results with an AAS finish and another with a gravimetric finish. Both sets 
were included thus making a total of 54 sets of results received.  Statistical analysis to 
identify outliers was carried out using the principles detailed in sections 7.3.2 ‚Äì 7.3.4, 
ISO 5725-2: 1994.  Assessment of each laboratory's performance was carried out on 
the basis of z-scores, partly based on the concept described in ISO/IEC Guide 43-1.    
Details of the criteria used in these examinations are available on request.  As a result 
of these statistical analyses, five sets of results were excluded for the purpose of 
assigning a gold concentration value to this reference material.  A recommended 
value was thus calculated from the average of the remaining n = 49 sets of replicate 
results.  The 95% confidence interval was estimated using the formula:- 

X ¬± ts/ÔøΩn 
(where X is the estimated average, s is the estimated standard deviation of the 
laboratory averages, and t is the 0.025 tail-value from Student's t-distribution with n-
1 degrees of freedom).  The recommended value is provided at the beginning of the 
certificate in Œºg/g (ppm) units.  A summary of the results used to calculate the 
recommended value is listed on page 4 and the names of the laboratories that 
submitted results are listed on page 5.  The results are listed in increasing order of the 
individual laboratory averages.  
 
Statistical analysis of the consensus test results has been carried out by independent 
statistician, Tim Ball.

APPENDIX 3 

 

JORC CODE ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING CRITERIA FOR THE REPORTING OF THE 

CORCOESTO MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE.  

 

 



 
 

261 

 

The table below is a description of the assessment and reporting criteria used in the 

Corcoesto Project mineral resource estimation that reflects those presented in Table 1 of The 

Australasian Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 

Reserves (the JORC Code).   

 

JORC CODE, 2012 EDITION - TABLE 1 

 

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data 

(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections.) 

 

Criteria Explanation/Commentary 

Sampling 

techniques 

ÔÇ∑ Trench samples were removed from a channel (10 cm wide and 3 cm deep) over 
intervals of between 1.0 m and 2.0 m for n approximate 6.0 kg sample.  

ÔÇ∑ RC drilling was sampled at 2.0 m intervals (RNGM, 1998 - 2003) and was halved at 
the drill site to produce circa 30 kg samples for subsequent preparation.  

ÔÇ∑ All diamond core holes have been split using a diamond saw and half core samples 
used for assay analysis.  Samples are crushed and pulverized to produce the aliquots 

required for analysis.   

ÔÇ∑ The majority of samples are between 1.0 m and 2.0 m in length.  

ÔÇ∑ Edgewater ensure that core is split perpendicular to any structural or mineralogical 
feature.  

Drilling 

techniques 

ÔÇ∑ The majority of drilling (86,997.37 m) is by diamond core methods, accounting for 
almost 80% of the samples in the database.   

ÔÇ∑ Only 32 reverse circulation holes (2,399.30 m) have been completed (and included in 
the database).   

ÔÇ∑ Most of the DDH have been completed with HQ diameter drilling equipment 
(producing 63.5 mm diameter core), though typically start with 116 mm diameter (PQ) 

equipment through the superficial material and initial weathered zone.  

ÔÇ∑ Geotechnical and hydrological (DDH) were not systematically sampled.  

Drill sample 

recovery 

ÔÇ∑ Core recovery has been recorded in the majority of the drill hole logs, and all of the 
holes completed by Edgewater since 2010.   

ÔÇ∑ Average core recovery (where recorded) is 96.7%.   

ÔÇ∑ Micon considers the overall core recovery to be acceptable though some intervals of 
elevated grade and lower core recovery should be investigated.  

Logging 

ÔÇ∑ Core logging has been carried out by Edgewater geologists using customized log 
sheets and is completed to a good standard and level of detail.   

ÔÇ∑ The geologists record the major code for lithology, alteration, mineralisation, and 
textural characteristic, as well as other basic data, onto paper forms.  

ÔÇ∑ The information is ultimately entered into an electronic database.  

Sub-sampling 

techniques and 

sample 

preparation 

ÔÇ∑ Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation for operators prior to Edgewater and 
detailed in the text (Section 11.3).  

ÔÇ∑ A generalised preparation flowsheet for all phases of exploration included an initial 
drying and weighing, crushing and pulverizing, circa 100 g sample produced for 

subsequent analysis.  

ÔÇ∑ Since 2010, DDH core is sawn longitudinally by Edgewater and half core submitted 
for sample preparation.  

ÔÇ∑ In-house facilities permitted crushing to nominal 10 mm followed by secondary 
crushing to 80% passing 2.0 mm.  

ÔÇ∑ Sample is then split to produce 1.0 kg sub-sample submitted to ALS Chemex in 
Seville for subsequent pulverization and analysis.   

Quality of ÔÇ∑ Information regarding the laboratories and analytical methods used are documented 



 
 

262 

 

assay data and 

laboratory tests 

for all periods of exploration at Corcoesto.  

ÔÇ∑ Ore Reserve Engineering (ORE) conducted a study to evaluate the sampling 
characteristics of the gold mineralisation using the Gy theory of sampling.  

ÔÇ∑ For the RNGM period (1998 ‚Äì 2003) ORE concluded that sampling behaviour is 
consistent with mineralisation in which gold grade is primarily dependent on the size 

and number of quartz veins in a sample and the gold grade and the size of gold 

particles in the veins is independent of size the veins.  Consequently changes were 

introduced for subsequent sample preparation.   

ÔÇ∑ During the Kinbauri drilling program (2005 - 2008) 1:20 check assay was sent to the 
ALS Chemex laboratory in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.  Internal laboratory control was 

done at ITMA by assaying 2 duplicates, 1 blank, and 1 standard within each batch of 

30 samples.   

ÔÇ∑ Check assays were available from the period 2005 through 2007 as internal duplicate 
assays and blind duplicate assays at ITMA, and external duplicate assays at the ALS 

Chemex laboratory.   

ÔÇ∑ Edgewater internal quality control programme involved the submission of a selection 
of blind duplicates and (Edgewater) blanks to the laboratory for analysis at the rate of 

one of each for every 20 samples.  No standard (CRM) sample was included.  

ÔÇ∑ Whilst there has been some variation in final preparation and subsequent analysis, 
generally all check analysis conducted by the different operators have produced 

satisfactory results.  

Verification of 

sampling and 

assaying 

ÔÇ∑ No independent verification analysis had previously been conducted.  

ÔÇ∑ During the more recent period (2010 to 2012) Edgewater sent three batches of samples 
(total 1,067) for verification at OMAC Laboratories Ltd. and AGQ Mining & 

Bioenergy S.L., Burguillos, Seville.  The results of this external check analysis 

showed that overall there was good repeatability for both Au and As.  

ÔÇ∑ In 2013 Micon conducted a verification exercise and submitted 286 samples (from 33 
separate intervals) for analysis to ALS Chemex (Seville).  

ÔÇ∑ Results from this exercise performed as required and Micon is satisfied that the results 
presented in the database are of adequate quality and quantity to support the estimation 

of mineral resources in accordance with the guidelines of the JORC Code.   

Location of 

data points 

ÔÇ∑ Accurate surveys of surface exploration holes were performed by independent licensed 
surveyors using a total station.  Collar locations were subsequently checked with high 

precision GPS in the areas with good coverage.  

ÔÇ∑ Down-hole deviation was measured initially with FLEXIT equipment and more 
recently (Edgewater) with MAXIBOR equipment.  

ÔÇ∑ RNGM determined that 38, out of the 50 holes drilled by Rio Tinto, had reliable collar 
surveys and were suitable for inclusion in the database and for resource estimation.  

ÔÇ∑ Collar and surface surveying is conducted in the Universal Transverse Mercator 
(UTM) WGS84, formerly European datum 1950 (ED50), Zone 29N.  

Data spacing 

and 

distribution 

ÔÇ∑ Drill hole profiles are generally orientated North - South and located at approximately 
40.0 m spacing (East ‚Äì West).  Pet√≥n de Lobo area drilled parallel to the Rio Tinto 

drill holes at an azimuth of 154¬∞ (S26E) for continuity.  

ÔÇ∑ The data distribution is sufficient to establish grade continuity, and certain geological 
continuity, appropriate for classifications determined for the Mineral Resources.  

ÔÇ∑ Samples are composited to 2.0 m prior to estimation.  

Orientation of 

data in relation 

to geological 

structure 

ÔÇ∑ Surface drill holes are oriented to intersect the mineralisation at right angles to the 
main strike.  

ÔÇ∑ The majority of the drill holes dip between 45¬∞ and 60¬∞ to the south.  

ÔÇ∑ A small number of underground drill holes have varying orientation.  

Sample 

security 

ÔÇ∑ Edgewater has maintained a rigorous chain of custody from rig site through to sample 
dispatch.   

ÔÇ∑ All samples are stored in locked facilities maintained by Edgewater.  



 
 

263 

 

ÔÇ∑ Samples were collected by ALS/commercial courier.  

ÔÇ∑ No specific sample security measures were used during sample storage.  

Audits or 

reviews 

ÔÇ∑ RNGM obtained all Rio Tinto core for review and relogging as well as relocating the 
collars (these were resurveyed) ‚Äì 12 drill hole collars could not be located and were 

omitted from the database.  

ÔÇ∑ Reviews on sampling and assaying results were conducted for all data internally.

Criteria Explanation/Commentary 

Database 

integrity 

ÔÇ∑ The initial resource data are generated and stored in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets prior 
to export into RecMin software.  This is exported as a Micorsoft Access document.   

ÔÇ∑ Original data sheets, logs and files, are retained and used to validate the contents of the 
database against original logging and results.  

ÔÇ∑ Laboratory assay results are received via electronic mail in several formats (PDF, 
Excel and csv) and are transposed directly into the appropriate spreadsheet enabling 

several checks to be conducted prior to its approval. 

ÔÇ∑ Data was manually validated on entry (to Excel) as well as on import to subsequent 
software including RecMin and Gemcom Surpac.   

ÔÇ∑ No major inconsistencies were identified.  

Site visits ÔÇ∑ The main site visit was performed by Micon's technical team from 3 ‚Äì 5 April, 2013.   

ÔÇ∑ Micon's technical team comprised Christopher Jacobs (Mineral Economist and Project 
Manager), Stanley Bartlett (Senior Geologist), Ch√© Osmond (Senior Geologist), 

Hannah Davies (Resource Geologist), Dermot Claffey (Consultant Geotechnical 

Engineer), and Jenifer Hill (Senior Environmental Scientist).   

ÔÇ∑ Additional visits have been completed by Ch√© Osmond from 8 ‚Äì 10 May, 2013 (Micon 
verification sampling), as well as a previous visit from 16 -18 January, 2013, prior to 

the engagement of Micon to complete this Technical Report.   

ÔÇ∑ During the main site visit, the technical team discussed, gathered information and 
evaluated the appropriateness of the data, methodologies and assumptions used to 

estimate the mineral resource and ore reserve, mine design, infrastructure, social and 

environmental, and cost estimates.  

ÔÇ∑ No site visit has been conducted to any of the laboratories used for the analysis of 
samples from Corcoesto as part of this resource estimate.  However, the laboratories 

used are independent of Edgewater  

Geological 

interpretation 

ÔÇ∑ Mineralisation was interpreted on section by Edgewater based on Au grade.  

ÔÇ∑ The mineralised interval was required to be >300 ppb Au (0.3 g/t Au).  

ÔÇ∑ Generally, assays used are higher than cut-off grades and contacts between economic 
and noneconomic grades are relatively sharp.   

ÔÇ∑ The wireframes include internal dilution (material with assay values <300 ppb Au) 
though no minimum width of internal dilution has been applied by Edgewater in the 

generation of the wireframes.  The only control on the inclusion of the material is that 

the overall interval grade is equal to or greater than 300 ppb Au.   

ÔÇ∑ The wireframes have been reviewed by Micon and adjusted in areas to minimize the 
inclusion of below cut off material, this has led to the generation of additional 

wireframe structures in many of the zones from the original wireframes provided by 

Edgewater.  

ÔÇ∑ The modification of the wireframes by Micon is believed to provide more robust 
wireframe interpretation in certain zones.   

Dimensions ÔÇ∑ The mineralised wireframes (zones) cover a strike length of between 300 m and 990 m 
and extend to a (max) depth of approximately 600 m.

Estimation and 

modeling 

techniques 

ÔÇ∑ Statistical analysis of the mineralised samples (database) was undertaken in Surpac 
software to identify any potential bias that may be present within the grade data.  

ÔÇ∑ Capping factors were applied to raw assays prior to compositing.  A summary of the 
results are presented in the table below.

ÔÇ∑ Compositing of the data was undertaken in Surpac, and the composite sample files 
imported into Datamine for use in estimations.  The compositing length (2.0 m) was 

chosen according to the length distribution of the sample populations.   

ÔÇ∑ A block model prototype was developed which enveloped all the mineralised zones.  
Block models were generated for each mineralised zone and dyke structure within this 

prototype.  The block model has a parent block size of 8 m x 8 m x 4 m, with variable 

sub-blockings to a minimum of 2 m x 2 m x 1 m.   

ÔÇ∑ In order to account for the changes in orientation, dynamic anisotropy has been 
undertaken for each mineralised zone and dyke, allowing for the orientation of the 

search ellipsoid to be defined individually for each block within the models.   

ÔÇ∑ Variography was undertaken to determine extents of the search ellipsoids.  

ÔÇ∑ For the zones where variographic continuity could not be established block grade 
estimations were undertaken using Inverse Distance Weighting (3), these include 

Fonterremula, Montefurado, Picotos, and Cova Crea.  Pet√≥n de Lobo and Pozo Del 

Ingl√©s were estimated with Ordinary Kriging.   

ÔÇ∑ In order to validate the block model estimates, and check for conditional bias, decluster 
plots were created which compare block model grade estimates and composite sample 

average grades.  No significant bias between block grades and composite grades is 

observed. 

Moisture ÔÇ∑ Tonnes are estimated on a dry basis.   

Cut-off 

parameters 
ÔÇ∑ Mineralised envelops are generated at a 300 ppb Au (0.3 g/t Au) cut-off.   

ÔÇ∑ The mineral resource has been estimated and presented at a range of cut-off grades 
including 0.5 g/t Au, 0.6 g/t Au, 0.7 g/t Au, and 0.8 g/t Au.   

Mining factors 

or assumptions 
ÔÇ∑ The (open pit) mineral resources have been constrained within a pit shell derived using 

base economics (gold price of US$ 1,400/oz) to identify potential open pit material.   

Metallurgical 

factors or 

assumptions 

ÔÇ∑ Recovery has been derived from metallurgical testwork conducted by ALS and has 
been applied as 88% for the purpose of resource estimation and the generation of an 

optimized pit shell to constrain the mineral resource.  

Environmental 

factors or 

assumptions 
ÔÇ∑ No issues noted.   

Bulk density ÔÇ∑ Bulk density (specific gravity) has been estimated into the model from a database of 
measurements obtained by Edgewater using the Archimedean principle.   

ÔÇ∑ A total of 990 specific gravity samples have been measured by Edgewater collected 
across the deposit, from 231 drill holes, from different lithologies.  

ÔÇ∑ Results are considered acceptable.   

Classification ÔÇ∑ The estimates have been classified into Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources 
according to the JORC Code (2012), taking into account data quality, data density, 



 
 

265 

 

geological continuity, grade continuity and estimation confidence.   

ÔÇ∑ Measured mineral resources were defined by those portions of the mineralised zone 
outlined by a sample spacing of 25 m x 25 m and having three or more composite 

samples within the first search ellipse with two or more of these samples from different 

drillholes/trenches/adits;   

ÔÇ∑ Indicated mineral resources were defined by those portions of the mineralised zone 
outlined by having two or more samples from different drillholes/trenches/adits, and 

falling within the second search ellipse for each zone; and,  

ÔÇ∑ Inferred mineral resources were defined as those portions of the mineralised zone 
which were outlined by widely spaced composite samples, or lenses containing 

samples multiple composite samples but only from one drill hole, trench or adit. 

ÔÇ∑ Classification also took into account the sample population density within each of the 
wireframe surfaces, and also the confidence of geological continuity within each area.  

Audits or 

reviews. 
ÔÇ∑ Micon has completed an internal peer review of the mineral resource estimate.  

ÔÇ∑ The resource model validation methods carried out included: Decluster analysis 
(statistical grade validation); visual assessment of grade; and swath plot (model grade 

profile) analysis.  

Discussion of 

relative 

accuracy 

confidence 

ÔÇ∑ No studies have been performed to quantify the relative confidence in the estimate.
