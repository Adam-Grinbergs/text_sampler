Attention:  Mr. Bruce Ford, President 
 
Dear Sirs: 
 
Re: Evaluation of the Interests of Alder Resources Ltd. in Five 

Exploration Blocks and One Producing Well in Colombia 
 
At your request, we have prepared an engineering evaluation of the interests of Alder 
Resources Ltd. (the "Company"), who is acquiring five exploration and production 
blocks and one producing well from Delavaco Energy Colombia Inc. Surcusal Colombia 
("Delavaco").  The evaluation is prepared using an effective date of August 31, 2008 and 
is for a major transaction filing with the TSX Venture Exchange. 

 
On February 28, 2008, Delavaco entered into a Farmout Agreement (the "FA") with 
Omega Energy Colombia (the "Farmor") to earn a fifty-one percent (51%) working 
interest in the Rio Magdalena Block, which has an Exploration and Production Contract 
("E&P Contract") with Ecopetrol.  The original contract ("Rio Contract") was signed 
between Argosy Energy International and Ecopetrol on January 28, 2002.  Subsequently, 
the Farmor owns 60% of the rights to the "Rio Contract". 

 
On February 28, 2008, the Delavaco entered into a FA with the Farmor to earn a thirty-
nine percent (39%) participating interest in the Carbonera Contract, of which the Farmor 
holds 44% rights and obligations with the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos ("ANH") 
on an E&P Contract. 
 
On July 23, 2008, Delavaco signed two farmout agreements with the Farmor to acquire a 
35% Participating Interest in the Talora Block and a 45% Participating Interest in the 
Chicuaco Block.  Both blocks have been under E&P Contracts with the ANH since 
September 16, 2001 for the Talora Block and March 21, 2006 for the Chicuaco Block. 
 
Delavaco has signed two purchase agreements relating to the Buena Vista Block.  One 
agreement is with Infinity Oil Limited for 30% working interest on August 28, 2008 and 
the other agreement with Petrosouth Energy Corporation Sucursal Colombia for 16%

working interest on September 16, 2008.   
 
On September 15, 2008, Delavaco executed an assignment of interest with Union 
Temporal for a 3.6% working interest of the La Punta #2 well only in the La Punta Block. 
 
To earn these five blocks and one producing well, Delavaco has agreed as follows: 
 
Rio Magdalena Block – 4% overriding royalty on its share of the net income and pay all 
costs (100%) associated with the completion of the Popa 2 and Andes wells, with a cost 
estimate of $7.6 million US and $6.3 million US respectively.  All future costs will then 
be at 51%. 
 
Carbonera Block – 3% overriding royalty on its share of the net income and pay 79% of 
the 3-D seismic acquisition costs of the Cerro Gordo 1, which is estimated at $6.32 
million US.  All future costs will then be at 39%. 
 
Talora Block – sliding scale overriding royalty between 2 and 4% depending on oil price, 
initial payment of $500,000 on effective date, $2,500,000 US in four installations over a 
period of 90 days, 600,000 shares of Delavaco, a workover cost of its share at $455,000 
US, and drill a well of its share at $1,100,000 US. 
 
Chicuaco Block - sliding scale overriding royalty between 2 and 4% depending on oil 
price, initial payment of $500,000 on effective date, $3,500,000 US in four installations 
over a period of 90 days, 600,000 shares of Delavaco, seismic costs of its share at 
$360,000, and drill one well of its share at $1,800,000. 
 
Buena Vista Block - 1. for the 16% working interest - an amount of $200,000 to 
Petrosouth Energy as initial payment on or before the effective date of the purchase 
agreement and the balance amount of $3,800,000 on or before December 31, 2008. 
 
2.  for the 30% working interest - one hundred percent (100%) of the costs of a 3D 
seismic program on the Buena Vista block to Infinity Oil, the estimated cost being $3.8 
million, gross. The first two installments of $810,000 and $1,226,000 were paid on July 
1st, 2008 and July 20, 2008; and the remainder shall be paid pursuant to the 3D Seismic 
Acquisition and Processing Agreement.  Delavaco also agrees to fund one hundred 
percent (100%) of the costs to drill, test, and complete a development well on the Buena 
Vista block, and one hundred percent (100%) of the costs to drill, test, and complete an 
exploratory well to eight thousand (8,000) feet on the block. 
 
In addition, Delavaco agrees that Radial Drilling Services Inc. can earn up to 10% 
undivided participating interest in the Buena Vista Contract by assuming the costs related 
to radial drilling services on the Bochica-1 and Bolivar-1 wells, with the potential of up 
to 5% participating interest per well based on successful results.  The outcome is a 1.5% 
participating interest reduction per well for a total of 3.0%, and a final participating 
interest of 27% in the Buena Vista Contract.  In order to assign the participating interest 
to Radial Drilling Services Inc., the following results must be achieved: 
 



 5 

(1) The thirty day average production rate after the application of the technology 
in the Bolivar 1 well will be greater than 150% of the thirty day averaged 
production prior to the application of the technology. 

(2) The thirty day average production after the application of the technology in 
the Bochica-1 (Bethel-1) well will be greater than 100 bop for thirty days of 
production of the application. 

 
La Punta #2 Well – a purchase fee of $3.5 million. 
 
The summary of the five blocks and one well are as follows: 
 
Block   Area (hectares/acres) Contract with      Effective Date of Contract 
 
Rio Magdalena 58,546/144,670 Ecopetrol  February 8, 2002 
Carbonera  25,790/63,727  ANH   December 28, 2005 
Talora   43,842/108,336 ANH   September 16, 2006 
Chicuaco  7,485/18,496  ANH   March 24, 2006 
Buena Vista  10,000/27,711  ANH   November 8, 2004 
La Punta #2 well one well spacing Ecopetrol   
 
Under the ANH E&P Contract, the Blocks are subject to a sliding scale royalty rate with 
a minimum of eight percent (8%) for light and medium crude oil (see Royalty rates).  The 
production period is 24 years under the ANH Contract after the exploration period.  
Under the Association Contract with Ecopetrol, the light and medium crude oil royalty 
rate varies from 8 to 20% depending on the contract. 
 
This evaluation uses the definition of reserves category from the Canadian Oil and Gas 
Evaluation (COGE) Handbook.  The net cash flow is calculated at forecast prices and 
escalated costs on the reserves, to all future time and after deduction of the capital costs, 
royalties and but before income tax.  All cash flow data is in U. S. dollars.  After tax 
analyses are shown in the cash flow forecasts.  A summary of the Company's gross and 
net share of reserves and net share of the future present worth net cash flow from all 
Blocks, discounted at 0 and 10% before deduction of income tax, is presented as follows:

Details of the reserves together with the net present values discounted at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 
20%, are shown in Table 1.  The gross reserve is the Company's share of production 
before royalties and the net reserve is the Company's share of production after deduction 
of royalties.  The royalties on the oil are paid in kind.  The taxable cash flow is based on 
before tax cash flow after deduction for G&A, DD&A and other costs, plus a 40% fiscal 
benefit on capital expenditures for 2008 and 2009.  The Colombia income tax rate is 33% 
per year for 2008 and each year thereafter (see Appendices H for the after tax analyses). 
 
Prospective resource is assigned to the Chicuaco Block and the details of the best 
estimate case in the three prospects are in Section V of the report.  
 
The estimated cash flow values do not represent a fair market value.  The abandonment 
costs of the wells, the salvage values of the equipment, and the environmental clean-up 
costs have been incorporated at the end of the economic life.  In reviewing the resources 
estimates provided, it should be understood that there are inherent uncertainties and 
limitations with both the database available for analysis and the interpretation of such 
engineering and geological data.  The judgments used in assessing the resources are 
considered reasonable given the knowledge of the property reviewed.  Pertinent 
information, such as extent and character of ownership of the lease, and all factual data 
submitted by the Company and the Company's representatives, are believed to be true.  A 
field inspection of the properties was not conducted due to the available data. 
 
If additional information is required, please advise. 
 
Respectfully Submitted, 
 
Petrotech Engineering Ltd.

DEFINITIONS OF RESERVES AND RESOURCES 
 

Taken from Section 5 of Volume 1 of the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook, 
by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers (Calgary Chapter) and the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (Petroleum Society), September 1, 2007. 
 
Crude Oil: A mixture, consisting mainly of pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons that exists 
in the liquid phase in reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure and 
temperature.  Crude oil may contain sulphur and other nonhydrocarbon compounds, but 
does not include liquids obtained from the processing of natural gas.  Classes of crude oil 
are often reported on the basis of density, sometimes with different meanings.  
Acceptable ranges are as follows: 
 
Light:  less than 870 kg/m3 (greater than 31.1o API) 
Medium: 870 to 920 kg/m3 (31.1o API to 22.3o API) 
Heavy:  920 to 1000 kg/m3 (22.3o API to 10o API) 
Extra-heavy: greater than 1000 kg/m3 (less than 10o API) 
 
Heavy or extra-heavy crude oils, as defined by the density ranges given, but with 
viscosities greater than 10 000 mPa.s measured at original temperature in the reservoir 
and atmospheric pressure, on a gas-free basis, would generally be classified as bitumen. 
 
Natural Gas: A mixture of lighter hydrocarbons that exist either in the gaseous phase or 
in solution in crude oil in reservoirs but are gaseous at atmospheric conditions.  Natural 
gas may contain sulphur or other non-hydrocarbon compounds. 
 
Natural Gas Liquids: Those hydrocarbon components that can be recovered from natural 
gas as liquids including but not limited to, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes plus, 
condensate and small quantities of nonhydrocarbons. 
 
Reserves Categories 
 
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances 
anticipated to be recoverable from know accumulations, from a given date forward, based 
on 
• Analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data; 
• The use of established technology; and 
• Specified economic conditions, which are generally accepted as being reasonable, 

and shall be disclosed. 
Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates.  
 
Proved Reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with high degree of certainty to 
be recoverable.  It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the 
estimated proved reserves.  Probable Reserves are those additional reserves that are less 
certain to be recovered than proved reserves.  It is equally likely that the actual remaining 
quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved + 



 10 

probable reserves.  Possible Reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to 
be recovered than probable reserves.  It is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will exceed the sum of the estimated proved + probable + possible reserves.  
Other criteria that must be also met for the classification of reserves are provided in 
Section 5.5.4.  These conditions are ownership, drilling requirements, testing 
requirements, regulatory considerations, infrastructure and market considerations, timing 
of production and development, and economic requirements. 
 
Development and Production Status 
 
Each of the reserves categories (proved, probable, and possible) may be divided into 
developed and undeveloped categories. 
 
a. Developed reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from 
existing wells and installed facilities or, if facilities have not been installed, that would 
involve a low expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a well) to put the 
reserves on production.  The developed category may be subdivided into producing and 
non-producing. 
 
Developed producing reserves are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from 
completed intervals open at the time of the estimate.  These reserves may be currently 
producing or if shut in, they must have previously been on production, and the date of 
resumption of production must be known with reasonably certainty. 
 
Developed non-producing reserves are those reserves that either have not been on 
production, or have previously been on production, but are shut in, and the date of 
resumption of production is unknown. 
 
b. Undeveloped Reserves are those reserves expected to be recovered from known 
accumulations where a significant expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of 
drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production.  They must fully meet 
the requirements of the reserves classification (proved, probable, possible) to which they 
are assigned. 
 
In multi-well pools, it may be appropriate to allocate total pool reserves between the 
developed and undeveloped categories or to subdivide the developed reserves for the pool 
between developed producing and developed non-producing.  This allocation should be 
based on the estimator's assessment as to the reserves that will be recovered from specific 
wells, facilities, and completion intervals in the pool and their respective development 
and production status. 
 
Levels of Certainty for Reported Reserves 
 
The qualitative certainty levels contained in these definitions are applicable to "individual 
reserves entities," which refers to the lowest level at which reserves calculations are 
performed, and to Reported Reserves, which refers to the highest level sum of individual 



 11 

entity estimates for which reserves estimates are presented.  Reported Reserves should 
target the following levels of certainty under a specific set of economic conditions: 
 
At least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or 
exceed the estimated proved reserves; at least a 50 percent probability that the quantities 
actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the estimated proved + probable 
reserves; at least a 10 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal 
or exceed the sum of the estimated proved + probable + possible reserves. 
 
A quantitative measure of the certainty levels pertaining to estimates prepared for the 
various reserves categories is desirable to provide a clearer understanding of the 
associated risks and uncertainties.  However, the majority of reserves estimates will be 
prepared using deterministic methods that do not provide a mathematically derived 
quantitative measure of probability.  In principle, there should be no difference between 
estimates prepared using probabilistic or deterministic methods. 
 
Resources 
 
The following definitions relate to the subdivisions in the resources classification 
framework of Figure 1 and use the primary nomenclature and concepts contained in the 
2007 SPE-PRMS, with direct excerpts shown in italics. 
 
Total Petroleum Initially-In-Place (PIIP) is that quantity of petroleum that is estimated to 
exist originally in naturally occurring accumulations.  It includes that quantity of 
petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known accumulations, 
prior to production, plus those estimated quantities in accumulations yet to be discovered 
(equivalent to "total resources"). 
 
Discovered Petroleum Initially-In-Place (equivalent to discovered resources) is that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, as of a given date, to be contained in known 
accumulations prior to production.  The recoverable portion of discovered petroleum 
initially in place includes production, reserves and contingent resources; the remainder is 
unrecoverable. 
 
Production is the cumulative quantity of petroleum that has been recovered at a given 
date. 
 
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances 
anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations, as of a given date, based on the 
analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data, the use of established 
technology and specified economic conditions, which are generally accepted as being 
reasonable.  Reserves are further classified according to the level of certainty associated 
with the estimates and may be subclassified based on development and production status.  
Refer to the full definition of reserves in Section 5.4. 
 
Contingent Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to 



 12 

be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or 
technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be 
commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies may include 
factors such as economic, legal, environmental, political and regulatory matters, or lack 
of markets.  It is also appropriate to  classify as contingent resources the estimated 
discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage.  
Contingent Resources are further classified in accordance with the level of certainty 
associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on project maturity and/or 
characterized  by their economic status. 
 
Unrecoverable is that portion of Discovered or Undiscovered PIIP quantities which is 
estimated, as of a given date, not to be recoverable by future development projects.  A 
portion of these quantities may become recoverable in the future as commercial 
circumstances change or technological developments occur; the remaining portion may 
never be recovered due to the physical/chemical constraints represented by subsurface 
interaction of fluids and reservoir rocks. 
 
Undiscovered Petroleum Initially-In-Place (equivalent to undiscovered resources) is that 
quantity of petroleum that is estimated, on a given date, to be contained in accumulations 
yet to be discovered.  The recoverable portion of undiscovered petroleum initially in 
place is referred to as "prospective resources" and the remainder as "unrecoverable." 

 
Prospective Resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to 
be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by application of future 
development projects.  Prospective resources have both an associated chance of 
discovery and a chance of development.  Prospective Resources are further subdivided in 
accordance with the level of certainty associated with recoverable estimates, assuming 
their discovery and development, and may be subclassified based on project maturity. 

 
Unrecoverable: see above. 

 
Reserves, contingent resources and prospective resources should not be combined 
without recognition of the significant differences in the criteria associated with their 
classification.  However, in some instances (e.g., basin potential studies) it may be 
desirable to refer to certain subsets of the total PIIP.  For such purposes, the term 
"resources" should include the clarifying adjectives "remaining" and "recoverable," as 
appropriate.  For example, the sum of reserves, contingent resources and prospective 
resources may be referred to as "remaining recoverable resources."  However, contingent 
and prospective resources estimates involve additional risks, specifically the risks of not 
achieving commerciality and exploration, which are not applicable to reserves estimates.  
Therefore, when resources categories are combined, it is important that each component 
of the summation also be provided, and it should be made clear whether and how the 
components in the summation were adjusted for risk. 
 
Classification of Resources 
 



 13 

For petroleum quantities associated with simple conventional reservoirs, the divisions 
between the resources categories defined in Section 5.2 may be quite clear, and in such 
instances, the basic definition alone may suffice for differentiation between categories.  
For example, the drilling and testing of a well in a simple structural accumulation may be 
sufficient to allow classification of the entire estimated recoverable quantity as contingent 
resources or reserves.  However, as the industry trends toward the exploitation of more 
complex and costly petroleum sources, the divisions between resources categories are 
less distinct, and accumulations may have several categories of resources simultaneously.  
For example, in extensive "basin-centre" low-permeability gas plays, the division 
between all categories of remaining recoverable quantities, i.e., reserves, contingent 
resources and prospective resources, may be highly interpretive.  Consequently, 
additional guidance is necessary to promote consistency in classifying resources.  The 
following provides some clarification of the key criteria that delineate resources 
categories.  Subsequent volumes of COGEH provide additional guidance. 
 
Discovery Status 
 
As shown in Figure 1, the total petroleum initially in place is first subdivided based on 
the discovery status of a petroleum accumulation.  Discovered PIIP, production, reserves 
and contingent resources are associated with known accumulations.  Recognition as a 
known accumulation requires that the accumulation be penetrated by a well and have 
evidence of the existence of petroleum.  COGEH Volume 2, Sections 5.3 and 5.4, 
provides additional clarification regarding drilling and testing requirements relating to 
recognition of known accumulations. 
 
Commercial Status 
 
Commercial status differentiates reserves from contingent resources.  The following 
outlines the criteria that should be considered in determining commerciality: 
 
-  economic viability of the related development project; 
-  a reasonable expectation that there will be a market for the expected sales quantities of 
production required to justify development; 
-  evidence that the necessary production and transportation facilities are available or can 
be made available; 
-  evidence that legal, contractual, environmental, governmental and other social and 
economic concerns will allow for the actual implementation of the recovery project being 
evaluated; 
-  a reasonable expectation that all required internal and external approvals will be 
forthcoming.  Evidence of this may include items such as signed contracts, budget 
approvals and approvals for expenditures, etc.; 
-  evidence to support a reasonable timetable for development.  A reasonable time frame 
for the initiation of development depends on the specific circumstances and varies 
according to the scope of the project.  While five years is recommended as a maximum 
time frame for classification of a project as commercial, a longer time frame could be 
applied where, for example, development of economic projects are deferred at the choice 



 14 

of the producer for, among other things, market-related reasons or to meet contractual or 
strategic objectives. 
 
COGEH Volume 2, Sections 5.5 to 5.8, provides additional details relating to the 
foregoing aspect of commerciality regarding classification as reserves versus contingent 
resources. 

 
Commercial Risk 
 
In order to assign recoverable resources of any category, a development plan consisting 
of one or more projects needs to be defined.  In-place quantities for which a feasible 
project cannot be defined using established technology or technology under development 
are classified as unrecoverable.  In this context, "technology under development" refers 
to technology that has been developed and verified by testing as feasible for future 
commercial applications to the subject reservoir.  In the early stage of exploration or 
development, project definition will not be of the detail expected in the later stages of 
maturity.  In most cases, recover efficiency will be largely based on analogous projects. 
 
Estimates of recoverable quantities are stated in terms of the sales products derived from 
a development program, assuming commercial development.  It must be recognized that 
reserves, contingent resources and prospective resources involve different risks 
associated with achieving commerciality.  The likelihood that a project will achieve 
commerciality is referred to as the "chance of commerciality."  The chance of 
commerciality varies in different categories of recoverable resources as follows: 
 
Reserves: To be classified as reserves, estimated recoverable quantities must be 
associated with a project(s) that has demonstrated commercial viability.  Under the fiscal 
conditions applied in the estimation of reserves, the chance of commerciality is 
effectively 100 percent. 
 
Contingent Resources: Not all technically feasible development plans will be 
commercial.  The commercial viability of a development project is dependent on the 
forecast of fiscal conditions over the life of the project.  For contingent resources, the risk 
component relating to the likelihood that an accumulation will be commercially 
developed is referred to as the "chance of development."  For contingent resources, the 
chance of commerciality is equal to the chance of development. 
 
Prospective Resources: Not all exploration projects will result in discoveries.  The 
chance that an exploration project will result in the discovery of petroleum is referred to 
as the "chance of discovery."  Thus, for an undiscovered accumulation, the chance of 
commerciality is the product of two risk components-the chance of discovery and the 
chance of development. 
 
Economic Status, Development and Production Subcategories 
 
a.  Economic Status 



 15 

  
By definition, reserves are commercially (and hence economically) recoverable.  A 
portion of contingent resources may also be associated with projects that are 
economically viable but have not yet satisfied all requirements of commerciality.  
Accordingly, it may be a desirable option to sub-classify contingent resources by 
economic status: 
 
Economic Contingent Resources are those contingent resources that are currently 
economically recoverable. 
 
Sub-Economic Contingent Resources are those contingent resources that are not currently 
economically recoverable. 
 
Where evaluations are incomplete such that it is premature to identify the economic 
viability of a project, it is acceptable to note that project economic status is 
"undetermined" (i.e., "contingent resources-economic status undetermined.") 
 
In examining economic viability, the same fiscal conditions should be applied as  in the 
estimation of reserves, i.e., specified economic conditions, which are generally accepted 
as being reasonable (refer to COGEH Volume 2, Section 5.8). 
 
b.  Development and Production Status 
 
Resources may be further subclassified based on development and production status.  For 
reserves, the terms "developed" and "undeveloped" are used to express the status of 
development of associated recovery projects, and "producing" and "non-producing" 
indicate whether or not reserves are actually on production (see Section 5.4.2). 
 
Similarly, project maturity subcategories can be identified for contingent and prospective 
resources; the SPE-PRMS (Section 2.1.3.1) provides examples of subcategories that 
could be identified.  For example, the SPE-PRMS identifies the highest project maturity 
subcategory as "development pending," defined as "a discovered accumulation where 
project activities are ongoing to justify commercial development in the foreseeable 
future." 
 
Uncertainty Categories 

 
Estimates of resources always involve uncertainty, and the degree of uncertainty can vary 
widely between accumulations/projects and over the life of a project.  Consequently, 
estimates of resources should generally be quoted as a range according to the level of 
confidence associated with the estimates.  An understanding of statistical concepts and 
terminology is essential to understanding the confidence associated with resources 
definitions and categories.  These concepts, which apply to all categories of resources, are 
outlined in Sections 5.5.1 to 5.5.3. 
 
The range of uncertainty of estimated recoverable volumes may be represented by either 



 16 

deterministic scenarios or by a probability distribution.  Resource should be provided as 
low, best and high estimates as follows: 
 
• Low Estimate: This is considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity 
that will actually be recovered.  It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered 
will exceed the low estimate.  If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 
90 percent probability (P90) that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed 
the low estimate. 
 
• Best Estimate: This is considered to be the best estimate of the quantity that will 
actually be recovered.  It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered 
will be greater or less than the best estimate.  If probabilistic methods are used, there 
should be at least a 50 percent probability (P50) that the quantities actually recovered will 
equal or exceed the best estimate. 
 
• High Estimate: This is considered to be an optimistic estimate of the quantity 
that will actually be recovered.  It is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities 
recovered will exceed the high estimate.  If probabilistic methods are used, there should 
be at least a 10 percent probability (P10) that the quantities actually recovered will equal 
or exceed the high estimate. 
 
This approach to describing uncertainty may be applied to reserves, contingent resources 
and prospective resources.  There may be significant risk that sub-commercial and 
undiscovered accumulations will not achieve commercial production.  However, it is 
useful to consider and identify the range of potentially recoverable quantities 
independently of such risk.

Forecast Crude Oil and Natural Gas Prices 
 

The forecast natural gas and oil prices are based on NYMEX futures 
(www.NYMEX.com) for the week beginning September 1, 2008.  The NYMEX futures 
are used to determine the commodity price escalation up to the NYMEX forecast year.  
The NYMEX West Texas Intermediate prices are adjusted according to the Platts Latin 
American Wire and Platts Natural Gas Liquids Wire from mid-week September 4, 2008.  
The major Colombian oil reference prices and their adjustment from West Texas 
Intermediate are for Cusiana (-$0.97/bbl), Vasconia (-$9.60/bbl) and 18.5° API Pipeline 
Specification (-$13.75/bbl).  The historical oil prices from 2003 through 2007 were taken 
from Sproule and Associates Inc. (www.sproule.com).  The forecast Natural gas prices 
for the Company's Colombian properties are based on a sales gas contract base price and 
then escalate in accordance with the NYMEX heating oil futures.  The heating oil futures 
are used in Colombia to forecast natural gas prices because they better represent the 
current natural gas usage in the country.  The historical heating oil prices were not 
provided by NYMEX or Sproule and as a result not included in the forecast prices 
summary table.  All commodity prices are in US dollars and the escalation beyond the 
NYMEX forecast year are 2% per year.  The prices are summarized as follows:

ANH Royalty Rates 
 
The contractor holds the rights to all production, which can be disposed of after paying a 
royalty at the point where the hydrocarbons are on specifications for transport or use. 
 
ANH collects the royalty from the contractor.  The royalty is a proportion of the daily 
gross production based on monthly averages, and it is calculated for each field as follows: 
   
      Royalty Rate (%) 
Production Rate (boe/d) Light Crude  Gas Onshore Heavy Crude Gas Offshore 
0 to 5,000   8  6.4  6  4.8 
5001 to 125,000  s/s 8 – 20 s/s 6.4 –16 s/s 6 – 15 s/s 4.8 -12

> 600,000   25  20  18.75  15 
 
(1) 1 boe = 6 Mcf 
 
When accumulated production rises above 5 MMbbl, and when an international reference 
price of crude is above a trigger level, there is a payment due to ANH for light crude.  
The payment is 30% of the real surplus income on the contractor.  The surplus income is 
a proportion the gross income in the same proportion as the international reference price 
exceeds the trigger level to the full international reference price.-confused, didn't change  
The real income of the contractor is the value of the production at the delivery point in 
the field.  The formula to compute the payment is the following: 
 
Payment to ANH = (Actual Value at Delivery Point) x (Actual Volume of Contractor) x 
(P-Po/P) x 30% 
 
P   = Actual price of marker crude, West Texas Intermediate 
Po = Trigger price of marker crude, West Texas Intermediate 
 
The trigger level depends on the actual quality of the hydrocarbon produced, measured as 
the gravity API, as follows:

I Geology of the Rio Magdalena, Carbonera, Buena Vista, Chicuaco, Talora, and La 
Punta Blocks in Colombia 

 
The six blocks are located as follows: 

 
1. Rio Magdalena Block in the Middle Magdalena Valley 
2. Carbonera Block in the Catatumbo Basin 
3. Buena Vista Block in the Eastern Cordillera Basin 
4. Chicuaco Block in the Llanos Basin 
5. Talora Block in the Middle Magdalena Valley 
6. La Punta Block in the Llanos Basin 
 

The northwestern corner of South America where Colombia is located has experienced 
different geological events that controlled the distribution, genesis, basin fill, and 
bounding structures of the sedimentary basins.  Colombia can be divided into three main 
tectonic domains as follows: 

 
1. The Eastern region, limited to the west by the foothills of the Eastern 

Cordillera.  It consists of a Paleozoic and Precambrian basements with a 
Paleozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary cover that has undergone mild deformation. 

2. The Central region, comprised of the Eastern Cordillera, Sierra Nevada de 
Santa Marta, the Magdalena River valley, and the Central Cordillera, 
extending as far as the Romeral fault system to the west.  A sedimentary-
metamorphic cover rests on a Grenvillian basement believed to be accreted to 
the South American border during Paleozoic times. 

3. The Western region, located at the west of the Romeral fault system, 
composed of Mesozoic-Cenozoic oceanic terranes accreted to the Continental 
margin during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene. 

 
Lower Paleozoic marine and coastal siliciclastic and carbonate sediments are distributed 
throughout the Eastern region (Llanos Basin), and extend into the Central region (Upper 
Magdalena Valley).  These deposits are very fossiliferous and range from Middle 
Cambrian to Llanvirnian in age.  Trilobites, brachiopods, and graptolites in gray to black 
shale is reported from outcrops in the Upper Magdalena Valley and in many wells drilled 
in the Llanos Basin.  In some places, the thermal maturity of these Lower Paleozoic 
sequences indicates appropriate conditions for hydrocarbon generation. 

 
Dated Lower Paleozoic intrusives outcrop along the Eastern Cordillera and Upper 
Magdalena basins of the Central region.  These intrusives crosscut a low-grade 
metamorphic sequence, and are overlain by the Upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks.  
Folding, metamorphic, and granitic intrusions are probably the result of eastward-directed 
subduction.  This region's tectonic event is known as the Caparonensis Orogeny.  The 
sedimentary sequences in this area consist of marine black shale and continental red-beds 
of Devonian age.  In some places, this continental Devonian is followed by an Upper 
Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian), consisting of limestone, conglomerates, sandstone, and 
graphitic shale with abundant marine fauna.  Permian rocks are absent in the southern 



 24 

portion of the Central Region.  However, farther to the north in the Santander Massif, 
Serrania de Perija, and Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, fossiliferous limestone of Lower 
Permian age has been reported.  Folding and granitic intrusions related to shear zones 
might represent oblique collision and accretion of Upper Paleozoic rocks during 
formation of the Pangaea sub-continent. 

 
Development of most of the Colombian sedimentary basins began in the Late Triassic 
during the break-up of Pangaea.  Early Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sediments were 
deposited in a northwest-southeast-northeast trending highly irregular rift system now 
underlying the Upper Cretaceous to Neogene sedimentary cover.  The post–rift phase of 
the system is characterized by the formation of a widespread sag due to the thermal 
subsidence that, together with global eustatic sea level changes during Middle Albian and 
Turonian times, created organic-matter-rich sediments of the Simiti-Tablazo Tétuan and 
La Luna source rocks.  These formations are responsible for generating most of the 
hydrocarbon found in Colombia. 

 
The Late Cretaceous-Paleogene exhumation of the Central and Eastern Cordilleras was 
linked to the oblique accretion of oceanic rocks; as a result, a transition from marine, 
nearshore to continental sedimentary deposits took place.  Growth unconformities and 
fluvial siliciclasitic sequences above them, characterized by intense volcanic activity in 
the western edge of the Central Region (Central Cordillera), are linked to a collision 
event.  Consequently, the fluvial deposits of the intermontane basins east and west of the 
Romeral fault system are rich in volcano-clasitics (e.g. La Paila, Combia, Honda, and 
Mesa formations).  These thick molassic deposits represent the overburden sequences to 
most of the petroleum systems of the Colombian basins. 

 
Initial basin geometry in Colombia was drastically modified by the Campian and 
Miocene collision events.  The Campian-Masstrichtian collision of the oceanic rocks to 
the west gave rise to development of the Colombian foreland-basin system.  By Early 
Miocene, a second major transpression event, produced by the collision of the Central 
America Island Arc, broke apart the widespread foreland basin system given, creating a 
number of broken-foreland basins.  This final configuration is portrayed in the 
sedimentary basins of Colombia. 

 
The Western Region, located west of the Romeral fault system, is composed of mafic and 
ultra-mafic rocks, deep-water siliceous shale, turbidites, and minor carbonates.  Their 
stratigraphic relationship is poorly known so far.  The tectonics of this region is complex, 
and some of these complexities are a collage of sedimentary/tectonic units that were 
highly deformed during oblique collision events. 

 
By Campanian-Maastrichtian times, the sequence of the turbiditic sandstone, siliceous 
mudstone, calcareous sandstone and black and green shale rich in organic matter 
developed.  What is now known as the Niogales Formation is presumably the source rock 
of the oil seep present in the Patia sub-basin.  Most of the geoscientists who have worked 
in the Western Region believe it to be composed of a still unknown number of 
allocthonous terranes.  The general agreement is that the Western Region is part of the 



 25 

Caribbean plate that moved during the Late Cretaceous from a Pacific Ocean location to 
its present location.  The precise dynamics and kinematics of this paradigm are still 
poorly understood. 

 
An important conclusion of the assumed displacement and diachronous oblique collision 
of the Western Region against the Continental margin of Western Colombia is the need 
for new kinematic models to explain the deformation of the Central and Eastern Regions.

Middle Magdalena Valley – Rio Magdalena and Talora Blocks 

 
The Middle Magdalena Basin is located along the central reaches of the Magdalena River 
Valley between the Central and Eastern Cordilleras of the Colombian Andes.  The 
exploratory process has been mainly oriented towards the identification of structural traps 
in the Paleogene sequences; this process has not adequately studied subtle stratigraphic 
traps yet.  The sedimentary record shows a succession of Jurassic continental deposits 
overlaid by Cretaceous sediments.  These sediments are both calcareous and siliciclastic, 
and of transitional to marine origin.  The Paleogene sequence is made up of siliciclastic 
rocks deposited mainly under continental conditions, with some marine influence.  The 
three major deformational phases present in the basin, rifting, thrusting, and wrenching, 
are responsible for all types of trap geometries. 
 
Hydrocarbon evidence 

 
A century of exploration history in the basin has led to the discovery of about 1,900 
MMBO, 2.5 TCF, and 41 fields, including the first giant in Colombia, La Cira-Infantas 
field.

main source rocks in the basin.  TOC values are high (1-6%), and organic matter is 
essential type II, Ro reach values of approximately 0.6-1.2%.   The primary source rocks 
were deposited during two worldwide anoxic events of the Mid-Albian and Turonian, 
which were responsible for the deposition of shale and limestone with high organic 
content in the Tetúan, Bambucá and La Luna formations.   
 
Migration 

 
The Eocene unconformity separates the primary reservoir from the underlying active 
source rocks, forming an ideal plumbing system for the petroleum migration.  Major 
migration pathways consist of 1) direct vertical migration where La Luna sub-crops the 
Eocene unconformity, 2) lateral migration along the Eocene sandstone carrier and 3) 
vertical migration via faults in areas where the La Luna does not sub-crop the Eocene 
unconformity.  The critical migration period occurred during the Upper Neogene, about 5 
Ma, and continues locally today. 
 
Reservoir 

 
Ninety seven percent of the proven oil in the basin comes from the continental Paleogene 
sandstone (Paleocene-Miocene), Lisama, Esmeraldas-La Paz, and Colorado-Mugrosa 
formations.  They have average porosities of 15 to 20% and average permeabilities of 20 
to 600 md.  Lightly explored reservoirs include the fractured systems of the Cretaceous 
Limestone Basal Limestone Group and La Luna Formation. 



 27 

 
Seal 

 
The seals for the Paleogene sandstone reservoirs consist of interbedded non-marine 
ductile claystone, mainly from the Esmeraldas and Colorado formations.  The seals for 
the potential Cretaceous limestone reservoirs are marine shale of the Simiti and Umir 
formations.  
 
Trap 

 
Exploration has been directed towards prospecting accumulations in structural closures 
formed by major asymmetric anticlines.  These include 1) contractional, fault-related 
folds hidden beneath surface thrust, 2) duplex structures with fault-independent closures, 
3) fault-dependent closures in which reservoir strata dip away from the fault and, most 
importantly, 4) traps in the low side of sealing faults. 
 
Prospectivity 

 
The Middle Magdalena Basin is one of the most explored basins of Colombia, where 41 
fields have been discovered on Paleogene deposits.  It still contains one of the most 
prolific areas yet to be explored: the Cretaceous carbonate plays.  Potential exploration 
areas are mainly related to inverted normal faults and sub-thrust anticlines.  Other major 
objectives for future exploration include subtle stratigraphic traps associated with 
Miocene-Upper Eocene onlaps, incised channels, and truncations. 
 
Catatumbo Basin – Carbonera Block 
 
The Catatumbo Basin is a southwest extension of the Maracaibo Basin in Venezuela.  To 
date, eleven oil and gas fields have been discovered in this basin.  Oil in Cenozoic and 
Cretaceous sandstone and limestone is trapped in faulted anticlines.  The Cretaceous and 
Cenozoic in this basin represent two distinct tectonic and sedimentary settings.  
Cretaceous rocks include marine sandstone, shale, and limestone that represent deposition 
in a broad, shallow sea.  This sea extended across northern Venezuela and continued 
south through Colombia.  Cenozoic rocks include fluvial-deltaic shale and sandstone that 
were deposited in a foreland basin.  Overall, reservoir porosity is best developed in 
Paleogene sandstone.  Traps are wrench-controlled, faulted anticlines that resulted from 
strike-slip convergence.  Oil was sourced from the upper Cretaceous La Luna Formation 
and the lower Cretaceous Uribante Group.  Oil generation began in the Late Eocene and 
continues through today. Seventy percent of the reserves were discovered between 1920 
and 1950 and were based on surface exploration (mapping of surface anticlines).  Most of 
the remaining hydrocarbon potential in this basin occurs in en-echelon folds associated 
with the regional left-lateral Chinácota fault system.  This fault system, referred to as the 
"Catatumbo Flexure" in the northern portion of the basin, is on the western flank.

 28 

Cretaceous-pelitic rocks (La Luna, Capacho, Tibú, and Mercedes formations) are widely 
distributed throughout the Catatumbo Basin; they are regionally distributed in the 
Maracaibo Basin and are considered one of the richest hydrocarbon sources in the world.  
The La Luna Formation is the principal source and is 200 feet thick.  The TOC ranges 
from 1.5% to 9.6%, with an average of 3.8%.  The La Luna Formation is currently in the 
oil window. 
 
Migration 
 
Three distinct migration systems have likely operated to fill the Catatumbo sub-basin 
traps that were developed in the late Miocene-Pliocene.  The lithological character of the 
Cretaceous sequence, very fine-grained sands and homogenous limestone and shale, 
favoured the development of in-situ oil reservoirs with very little or no hydrocarbon 
migration.  Lateral migration along sandstone bodies and vertical migration along 
fractures are the two most effective migration pathways.  
 
Reservoir 
 
Cretaceous shallow water limestone and Cretaceous sandstone (Uribante Group, 
Capacho, and La Luna formations) are the main reservoir rocks.  Deltaic sandstone of 
Paleogene age (Catatumbo, Barco, Mirador, and Carbonera formations) is also a good 
reservoir.  Additionally, fractured basement rocks are thought to be potential reservoirs.  
 
Seal 
 
Thick marine and non-marine shale in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic sequences form 
potential seals. 
 
Trap 
 
The Catatumbo Basin shows a wide variety of traps; normal faults with partial inversion, 
sub-thrust structures, triangular zones, and structures associated with inversion systems 
are important structural traps.  Some oil entrapments within the Paleocene, Barco, and 
Catatumbo formations are considered indigenous or in-situ.  The entrapment and 
production of Cretaceous oil is controlled by and associated with the secondary porosity, 
which was developed by fracturing of the same Cretaceous rock.  
 
Prospectivity 
 
The Catatumbo Basin has been one of the most prolific basins in the country. 
Commercial hydrocarbon production comes from the structures related to asymmetric 
folds affected by inversion.  The western zone of the basin is a fold belt, and recent 
studies in the area indicate potential exploration plays along thrust zones.  The main 
oilfields in the basin are the Rio de Oro, Tibú-Socuavo, Carbonera, Sardinata, Rio Zulia, 
Petrolea, and Puerto Barco.  The Catatumbo Basin is a moderately explored basin that has 
produced more than 450 MMbbl of oil and 500 Bcf of gas since 1920. 



 29 

Eastern Cordillera Basin – Buena Vista Block 
 

The Eastern Cordillera Fold Belt covers an area of about 60,000 km².  It is located 
between the Magdalena River Valley and the Llanos Cenozoic Foreland Basin.  In the 
present work, the previous boundaries have been slightly modified to include, in both 
sides, the frontal thrust of the fold belt.  Therefore, the so-called eastern and western 
foothills, which contain the giant Cusiana and the major Provincia oil fields in the 
hanging wall of the frontal thrusts, are considered here as part of the Eastern Cordillera 
basin. 
 
The beginning of the exploratory process in the basin was oriented towards confirming 
accumulation in the anticline structures.  These structures are in the surrounding areas of 
Tunja, where multiple oil seeps were found.  During the last three decades, drilling has 
been mainly concerned with the exploration of structural traps on the foothills.  During 
the Triassic-Jurassic and late Cretaceous, tensional/transtensional stresses produced a 
system of asymmetric half-graben basins filled continuously with alternate marine and 
near shore/continental deposits.  The deformation of these deposits occurred as a 
succession of events.  The first event, in the late Eocene-Early Oligocene, generated an 
imbricated system.  The imbricated system was eroded and covered by upper Oligocene 
deposits.  A subsequent transpressional event during the Miocene and Pleistocene 
reactivated pre-existing thrust faults and re-folded the structures concomitant with the 
uplift of the Cordillera. 
 
Hydrocarbon evidence 
 
Five decades of exploration history in the basin has led to the discovery of about 1,700 
MBO, 2.0 TCFG, and a total of 10 fields, including the giant Cusiana and Cupiagua 
fields, and the large gas-condensate Gibraltar discovery. 
 
Source 
 
The main sources are two condensed sections deposited during the worldwide anoxic 
event of the Mid-Albian and Turonian.  In addition, less important source rocks are 
believed to be present in the lower and upper Cretaceous.  Primary hydrocarbon-
generating sources contain TOC values between 1.0 and 3.0% and kerogen types I and II. 
 
Migration 
 
The first generation pulse occurred during the Late Cretaceous, but most of the petroleum 
generated seems to be lost due to the lack of traps at that time.  A second pulse occurred 
from the Miocene to recent times and is responsible for filling the giant traps in both 
foothills. 
 
Reservoir 
 



 30 

The most important petroleum reservoir rocks were deposited during the Albian and 
Cenomanian stages and Paleogene period.  The Paleogene siliciclastic units have a wide 
range of petrophysical properties; the average porosities are between 5 and 10%, and 
permeabilities are in the order of 4-100 md. 
 
Seal 
 
The seals for the Paleogene sandstone reservoirs consist of interbedded shale.  The 
regional seal for the Cretaceous reservoirs are thick shale of marine origin. 
 
Trap 
 
The main structural features are basement-involved reverse faults resulting from the 
inversion of pre-existing normal faults, contractional fault-related folds, and duplex 
structures. 
 
Prospectivity 
 
The Neogene deformation of sediments in the basin was probably related to strike-slip 
motions.  It is highly likely that future discoveries will be associated with traps formed by 
transpression.  Fault-bend folds, fault propagation folds, and triangle zones are the main 
objectives in the Eastern Cordillera.  A potential play in the axial zone is related to 
accumulation against salt domes, and there is non-conventional gas plays associated with 
coal beds. 
 
Llanos Basin – Chicuaco and La Punta Blocks 
 
Basin Boundaries 
 
The Eastern Llanos Basin is located in the Eastern region of Colombia.  The northern 
limit of this basin is the Colombian-Venezuelan border.  The south of the basin extends 
as far as the Macarena high, the Vaupés Arch, and the Precambrian metamorphic rocks 
that outcrop to the south of the Guaviare River.  The eastern limit is marked by the 
outcrops of the Precambrian plutonic rocks of the Guyana Shield, and the west of the 
basin is limited by the frontal thrust system (Guaicaramo fault system) of the Eastern 
Cordillera. 
 
Evolution 
 
The evolution of the basin began in the Paleozoic with a rifting phase.  Siliciclastic 
sediments were deposited over the crystalline Precambrian basement.  From Triassic to 
Late Cretaceous, the basin was the eastern shoulder of a major rift system. 
 
Between the Maastrichtian and Paleocene, this basin became a foreland.  From Miocene 
to recent times, the basin has been a repository of thick molasse deposits.  Cretaceous 
source rocks range from immature to marginally mature within the region to the east of 



 31 

the frontal thrust.  The main reservoirs are siliciclastic units of Late Cretaceous and 
Paleogene age.  The thinning of the stratigraphic section and the development of more 
sand-prone facies towards the Guyana Shield complicate analysis of the individual 
components of the migration systems within the basin. 
 
Hydrocarbon Evidence 
 
More than 1,500 MMBO of recoverable oil is officially documented.  Two giants (Caño-
Limón and Castilla), three major fields (Rubiales, Apiay and Tame Complex), and more 
than fifty minor fields have been discovered. 
 
Source 
 
Source rocks for the Llanos Foreland Basin are in fact located beneath the east flank of 
the Eastern Cordillera.  The main source is mixed marine-continental shale of the 
Gachetá Formation with kerogen types II and III, TOC ranging from 1-3% and 150-300 ft 
of effective thickness. 
 
Migration 
 
There have been two migration pulses. The first one occurred during the Upper Eocene-
Oligocene.  The second began in Miocene times and continues at present. 
 
Reservoir 
 
The Paleogene Carbonera (C-3, C-5, and C-7) and Mirador sandstone is an excellent 
reservoir unit.  Within the Cretaceous sequence, several sandstone intervals are also 
excellent reservoirs.  Without exceptions, sedimentary thickness increases in an east to 
west direction.  Porosity decreases in the same direction from 30% to about 10%.  Pay 
thickness varies from a few feet up to 180 feet depending on the location of the well 
within the basin.  API gravity ranges form 12o-42°. 
 
Seal 
 
The C-8 Unit of the Carbonera Formation has traditionally been considered the regional 
seal of the basin; yet because of its extension, the best seal is the Carbonera C-2 Unit.   
The even-numbered Carbonera units are recognized as local seals, as are the Cretaceous 
Gachetá and Guadalupe formations that may be self-sealant. 
 
Trap 
 
Exploration drilling has been concentrated on normal, up-to-the-basin (antithetic) faults. 
Poorly tested reverse fault anticlines, low-relief anticlines, and stratigraphic traps (pinch-
outs, paleohighs, channel, etc.) are all high potential exploration targets. 
 
Prospectivity 



 32 

 
This basin has been moderately drilled and subtle stratigraphic traps have not been deeply 
studied.  The southern and eastern portions of the basin are potential areas for 
hydrocarbon accumulation, where meteoric water forming hydrodynamic traps affects 
pinch-outs of reservoirs.  The southwestern part, south of the Castilla Field, is also a 
highly prospective area.

Acquisition 
 
On February 28, 2008, Delavaco Energy Colombia Inc. Sucursal Colombia entered into a 
Farmout Agreement (the "FA") with Omega Energy Colombia (the "Farmor") to earn a 
fifty-one percent (51%) working interest in the Rio Magdalena Block, which has an 
Exploration and Production Contract ("E&P Contract") with Ecopetrol.  The original 
contract ("Rio Contract") was signed between Argosy Energy International and EcoPetrol 
on January 28, 2002.  Subsequently, the Farmor owns 60% of the rights to the "Rio 
Contract". 
 
In order to earn the interest, Delavaco has agreed to pay a 4% overriding royalty on its 
share of the net income, in addition to the existing royalty to Ecopetrol, and pay all costs 
(100%) associated with the completion of the Popa 2 and Andes wells, with a cost 
estimate of $7.6 million US and $6.3 million US respectively.  All future costs will then 
be at 51%. 
 
The Association Contract was signed on February 8, 2002 between Ecopetrol and Argosy 
Energy International.  The total area of the Rio Magdalena Block is 58,546.0046 hectares 
( acres).  The work program of this Contract was as follows: 
 
Phase Duration Work Program Description 
 
1 18 months Acquire 40 km of 2-D seismic and drill one exploratory well 
2          12 months Acquire 30 km of 3-D seismic or 2-D seismic at the equivalent cost 



 38 

of 3-D seismic and drill one exploratory well. 
3. 18 months Drill one exploratory well. 
 
The fulfillment of the work program has not been verified, as there may be changes to the 
work program that were subject to the approval of Ecopetrol. 
 
Evaluation 
 
Eight wells have been drilled in the Rio Magdalena Block (See Figure II-1) and 440 km 
of 2D seismic were used in the preparation of the geological and geophysical assessment 
of the block.  The focus is the Popa-1 and Popa-2 fault blocks of which two wells have 
been drilled with the work program, both of which have tested hydrocarbons in the 
Cretaceous Monserrate formation, which is the primary target.  The Popa-1 structure is 
controlled by seven seismic lines, and the Popa-2 structure is well controlled by nine 
seismic lines, including four lines from the 2007 seismic acquisition program, which 
included pre-stack and time-migration (PSTM) processing.  In the Popa-1 fault block, the 
aerial extent ranges from a minimum of 5,559.8-acres (22.5 km2) to a maximum of 
5,806.9-acres (23.5 km2).  In the Popa-2 fault block, the aerial extent ranges from a 
minimum of 6,795.4-acres (27.5 km2) to a maximum of 7,289.6-acres (29.5 km2) (see 
Figures II-8 and II-9).  It is observed that early rifting resulted in a series of buried hills 
on which Tertiary-Cretaceous clastic deposits were later thrusted, resulting in 
hydrocarbon-bearing Cretaceous fault blocks (see Figure II-9).  These fault blocks mainly 
thrusted into huge Seca-Guaduas shale; as long as the shale is thick enough, the 
Monserrate fault blocks are potentially hydrocarbon-bearing.  An east-west cross section 
of the wells shows the drastic difference of the top of Monserrate depth as a result of the 
faulting (see Figure II-11). 
 
The Popa-1 and Popa-2 fault block drilling locations are shown on Figure II-9 as follows: 

 
Well Name   Colour 
Popa-2 Offset   Red 
Popa-1 Offset   Pink 
Popa-2 Development #1  Blue 
Popa-2 Development #2     Green 

 
If 3-D seismic is used to define these two fault blocks, it will enhance the potential 
recoverable reserve. 
 
Popa 1 Well 
 
The Popa-1 well was drilled to a total depth of 9,285 feet in August 2006.  The primary 
target was the Cretaceous Monserrate, which produces from the neighbouring Puli Block 
(see Figure II-1).  The Popa-1 well penetrated the Monserrate formation at 8,700' TVD (-
7,834 TVDSS).  The well began the first of two drill stem tests on July 27, 2006, and the 
tests are summarized as follows:

DST 1 corresponds to hydrocarbon shows on the Popa-1 mud log (see Figure II-6) and 
was assigned reserves based on volumetric calculation (see detailed calculation later in 
this section).  The cement bond log shows inadequate bonding from 8,728' to 8,758' and 
8,806' to 8,824' (within the DST 1 intervals).  A remedial cement job should be 
considered in order to obtain the assigned reserve.  Additional reserve is assigned to the 
same formation in an offset well.  The DST 2 shows no economic rates. 
 
Popa 2 Well 
 
The Popa-2 well was drilled to a total depth of 9,000 feet in June 2008.  The primary 
target was the Cretaceous Monserrate, which was tested in the nearby Popa-1 well and 
produces from the neighbouring Puli Block.  The Popa-2 well penetrated the Monserrate 
formation at 7,705' TVD (-6,815 TVDSS) and a secondary target, the Guaduas 
formation, at 6,539 TVD (-5,650 TVDSS).  The well began the first of seven drill stem 
tests on June 28, 2008, and the tests are summarized as follows:

Drill stem tests 3 to 5 correspond to the hydrocarbon shows on the Popa-2 mud log (see 
Figure 2) and therefore were assigned reserves based on volumetric calculation.  In 
addition, the mud log has good hydrocarbon shows throughout the DST 2, which tested 



 40 

98.7% BS&W (see Figure II-3).  The cement bond log shows inadequate bonding 
throughout this interval from 8,070' to 8,152' and washout near the bottom of the interval 
(see Figure II-4).  As a result, a remedial cement job is required in order to obtain the 
reserve. An offset location and two development locations are assigned from seismic 
interpretation of the aerial extent of the Lower Monserrate. 
 
Because of the washout in the Popa 2 well through the Monserrate formation, the electric 
log responses were inaccurate.  The reservoir data for this well was based the data of 
Popa 1.   
 
Based on the gas readings from the mud log, an estimation of the gas analyses was made 
to the DSTs as follows:

The heating values can then be estimated as follows:

Gas to Oil Ratio (bbl/Mcf) 25.6  7.7  100.8  100.8 
 
From the oil analysis of the Popa 1 well, the produced oil (condensate) is estimated at 
between 30 and 35° API gravity (see Figure 8). 
 
The initial bottomhole pressure of the Popa-2 well, as calculated in the DST-1, interval 
was 3,646 psia (or 0.4217psi/foot).  The temperature gradient is estimated at 18.2°F per 
1,000 feet based on electric logging tool temperature recorders.

Operating Costs  
 
The variable operating costs are estimated as follows: 
 
Oil/Condensate lifting and handling cost   $10.00 per barrel  
Oil/Condensate transportation cost     $7.06 per barrel 
Non-associated and associated gas processing cost  $1.50 per Mcf 
Sales gas pipeline cost     $0.50 per Mcf  
 
The fixed operating cost is estimated at $25,000 per month per well.   All operating costs 
are estimates for 2008 and then escalate at 5% per year.  The transportation cost of the 
oil/condensate is estimated as follows: 
 
Rio Magdalena Block to Velasquez     $2.50 per barrel 
Velasquez Offloading       $0.30 per barrel 
Velasquez to Vasconia      $0.46 per barrel 
Vasconia to Coveñas       $2.46 per barrel 
Covenas Terminal Fee      $0.90 per barrel 
Covenas Offloading Fee      $0.43 per barrel 
Total Transportation Cost      $7.06 per barrel 
 
Economic Assumptions and Parameters  
 
Working Interest   51% with the exception of Popa-2 Offset well 
     100% of drilling cost of Popa-2 Offset 
Royalty Rate 8% for oil/condensate and 6.4% for non-associated 

and associated gas 
Overriding Royalty    4% 
Forecast Natural Gas Price $2.50/MMBtu base price and then escalate at 

NYMEX future for heating oil  
Forecast Oil/Condensate Prices Based on NYMEX futures for WTI minus Platts 

adjustment 
Non-associated gas heating value see detailed volumetric calculations 
Associated gas heating value  1,300 Btu/scf 
Oil Gravity    34° API 
Condensate Gravity   ~30° API 
Escalation Factor   2% on prices and 5% on costs  
Operating Days   350 per year  
Effective Date    August 31, 2008 
 
Reserves  
 
Proved plus probable undeveloped and probable undeveloped natural gas reserves are 
assigned to 1,280-acres of the Popa-2 fault block based on electric log interpretation, mud 
logs, drill stem tests, 2D seismic interpretations, and nearby analogs.  The reserve has 
been assigned to four wells as follows: 



 43 

         Area       Marketable Gas 
Well Name Reserve Category     (acres)  (MMcf) 
Popa-2      Proved undeveloped     320     5,299.0 
      Proved plus probable undeveloped    320              13,149.5 
Popa-2 Offset     Proved undeveloped      320     5,311.6 
      Proved plus probable undeveloped    320   13,062.1 
Popa-2 Dev. #1   Probable undeveloped     320   13,062.3 
Popa-2 Dev. #2   Probable undeveloped     320   13,062.3 
 
Note: See Figure 13 for Popa-2 proposed drilling locations 
 
Detailed volumetric calculations are found later in this section.  The large increase in 
incremental reserves from the proved to the proved plus probable reserves for the Popa-2 
and Popa-2 Offset are the result of a success scenario in the Lower Monserrate.  This is 
the interval from 8,070' – 8,152' discussed in the Popa-2 evaluation (see earlier section), 
which had a good mud log show but a poor test, which could be the result of inadequate 
cement bond through this interval.  In addition to inadequate cement, the entire interval 
was perforated using 5 shots per foot; this could also have lead to the poor DST results.  
 
Proved plus probable undeveloped and probable undeveloped oil reserves are assigned to 
320-acres of the Popa-1 fault block based on electric log interpretation, mud logs, DST, 
2D seismic interpretations, and nearby analogs.  The reserve has been assigned to two 
wells as follows: 
         Area       Recoverable Oil 
Well Name           Reserve Category    (acres)   (Mbbl) 
Popa-1      Proved undeveloped     160     259.4 
      Proved plus probable undeveloped    160     363.3 
Popa-1 Offset     Probable undeveloped     160     442.3 
 
Note: See Figure 13 for Popa-1 proposed drilling location 
 
Detailed volumetric calculations are found later in this section.  The incremental reserve 
assigned to the Popa-1 well is a result of a remedial cement job in the intervals tested in 
DST-1 (see earlier section for details).  The additional reserve assigned to the Popa-1 
Offset is a result of its crestal location, which is expected to have a greater net to gross 
ratio for pay thickness. 
 
Production Forecast and Methods  
 
The production forecast is based on historical production performance trends of the 
nearby Puli-7 well, Abanico Field, Rio Opia Field, and Ambrosia Field (see production 
plots below) in conjunction with the DST data from the Popa-1 and Popa-2 wells.  The 
following summarizes the production forecast by well: 
     
Well Name           Reserve Category       Initial Rate   Decline Rate  
Popa-2   Proved undeveloped     5.2 MMcf/d   36%/year 



 44 

   Proved plus probable undeveloped  12.8 MMcf/d   36%/year 
Popa-2 Offset  Proved undeveloped      5.2 MMcf/d   36%/year 
   Proved plus probable undeveloped  12.8 MMcf/d     36%/year 
Popa-1   Proved undeveloped    175.4 bopd   24%/year 
   Proved plus probable undeveloped     245.6 bopd   24%/year 
Popa-1 Offset  Probable undeveloped   298.9 bopd   24%/year 
Popa-2 E&D #1 Probable undeveloped   10.5 MMcf/d   30%/year 
Popa-2 E&D #2 Probable undeveloped   10.5 MMcf/d   30%/year 
 
Notes: All declines are hyperbolic at exponent b=0.1 
 Initial production rates based on 144 month productive lifespan 
 Economic limit of ~15 bopd or ~300 Mcf/d 
 
The following summarizes the estimated first production month for the above wells: 
 
Well Name   First Production  
Popa-2    April 2009 
Popa-1    April 2009 
Popa-2 Offset   July 2009 
Popa-1 Offset    July 2009 
Popa-2 Development #1 October 2009 
Popa-2 Development #2 January 2010

III Evaluation of the Carbonera Block in the Catatumbo Basin, Colombia 
  

On February 28, 2008, the Delavaco entered into a FA with the Farmor to earn a thirty-
nine percent (39%) participating interest in the Carbonera Contract, of which the Farmor 
holds 44% rights and obligations with the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos ("ANH") 
on an E&P Contract. 
 
In order to earn the interest, Delavaco has agreed to pay a 3% overriding royalty on its 
share of the net income, in addition to the existing royalty to ANH (see ANH Royalty 
rates), and pay 79% of the 3-D seismic acquisition costs of the Cerro Gordo 1, which is 
estimated at $6.32 million US (Company's share is $4,993,800 US).  All future costs will 
then be at 39%. 
 
The E&P Contract was signed on December 28, 2005 between ANH and Well Logging 
Ltda.  The total area of the Carbonera Block is 25,789.54 hectares (63,727.3 acres).  The 
minimum work program as per Annex B of the E&P Contract is as follows: 
 
Phase Duration Work Program Description 
 
1 16 months Re-entry and evaluate 1 well in the Cerro Gordo Field. 
   If re-entry is not possible, drill 1 well to the base of the La Luna. 
   Acquire and interpret 38 km of 2-D seismic. 
2 12 months Drill an exploratory well to the basement at ~ 6,500 feet. 
3 12 months Drill an exploratory well. 
4 12 months Drill an exploratory well. 
5 10 months Drill an exploratory well. 
6 10 months Drill an exploratory well. 
 
In this evaluation, the fulfillment of the minimum work program has not been verified, as 
there may be changes to the work program that are subject to the approval of ANH.  The 
operator did re-enter the Cerro Gordo 1 well and put it on production in January 2008.  
The well has been producing gas, free condensate, and processed NGL, but it has not 
been economical to operate due to a limited gas market. 
 
Under the previous operator, four wells, the Cerro Gordo 1, 2, 3, and 4, were drilled in 
the Carbonera Block in the late 1980s.  The La Luna formation was the primary target, 
and has been successfully tested in the Cerro Gordo 1 and 2 wells.  The Cerro Gordo 1 is 
currently producing.  A secondary target is the Aguadiente formation, where the Cerro 
Gordo 1 tested 185 Mcf per day.  

 
The Cerro Gordo 1 and 2 wells were tested in the La Luna and Aguadiente (Cerro Gordo 
1 only) formations (see Appendices C-1 and C-2).  The wells were suspended as non-
commercial discoveries.  The Cerro Gordo 1 was re-entered and tested in June 2007 (see 
Appendix C-7) and began production January 2008.  As of July 31, 2008, the well has 
produced 63.0 MMcf of natural gas and 558 barrels of free condensate with no water (see 
Appendix C-3).  Because there is no sales gas pipeline, the produced gas is sold in 
pressurized tanks at a limited volume.  The La Luna gas is rich, with a relative density of 



 84 

0.7760 (see Appendix C-4), and its free condensate ratio (GOR) increases.  The La Luna 
formation is expected to produce an average of 14 barrels of free condensate per MMcf 
of produced gas.  The rich gas can be stripped of the heavy ends through a gas 
refrigeration plant at a rate of 46.4 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGL) per MMcf.   

 
Based on current local commodity prices, the Cerro Gordo Field does not support the 
capital required to construct a sales gas pipeline.  In recent development of selling gas, 
the operator signed a letter of intent with Promotora de Energia Electrica de Cartagena y 
Compañia Sociedad en Comandita por Acciones, Empresa de Servicios Publicos, 
Proelectrica y Cia (the Buyer) on September 11, 2008 to sell up to 50 MMcf of gas from 
the Catguas and Carbonera Blocks in Colombia.  The Buyer will purchase the gas for ten 
years from the date on which the Seller is able to deliver to the Buyer at the Delivery 
Point of the gas field.  The gas price is to be determined by a formula which should 
include at least one international fuel index (NYMEX, Platts, or Bloomberg, etc.).  In 
addition, the Cerro Gordo gas is rich in condensate, and it is anticipated that the gas 
refrigeration plant be installed to strip the NGL from the rich gas.  The free condensate 
and NGL can be sold to the surrounding heavy oil producers for dilution to lighter crude. 
 
Capital Cost and Work Program 
 
Since there is no gas-stripping and re-injection in the area, it is proposed that this project 
be introduced in two phases so that the Cerro Gordo field can be properly delineated to 
incorporate the interpretation of the seismic data.  The capital costs and work program 
also incorporate the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement.  They are as 
follows:

Phase I consists of probable plus possible undeveloped reserves assigned to the Cerro 
Gordo 1 and 2 and probable undeveloped reserves assigned to 5 additional undrilled 
locations.  Details of the capital cost for the gas plant, compression, and storage for Phase 
I are as follows:

       11,000,000         4,290,000 
 
Stabilizer and refrigeration is based on $500,000 per MMcf of daily gas being processed.  
Compression is based on $2,500 per HP assuming 100 HP per MMcf of daily gas being 
injected.  The knock out pressure in the stabilizer is estimated at 200 psig, and              
sales gas pipeline pressure is 550 psig. 
 
The total abandonment cost (net of salvage) per well is estimated at $100,000, and the 
facilities are estimated at $1,500,000.  The Company's share of the total estimated 
abandonment cost is $858,000.

Phase II consists of possible (developed and undeveloped) reserve assigned to the Cerro 
Gordo 1 and 2 (developed non-producing) and 5 additional locations (undeveloped).  The 
capital costs of the gas refrigeration and compression plant are as follows: 
 
Description    Total Cost ($)  Company Cost (M$)

assigned to the Cerro Gordo Field based on historical production, electric log 
interpretations, drill stem tests, gas analyses, 2D seismic interpretations (Figure III-2), 
and implementation of a natural gas refrigeration plant to strip and stabilize NGL.  A 
summary of the recoverable natural gas and liquids are as follows:

Production Forecast and Methods 
 
Because the Cerro Gordo 1 historical data does not present a declining trend, the 
production forecast is based on historical data of the nearby Cerrito Gas Field, which 
produces natural gas from the La Luna formation in both the Cerrito 1 and Cerrito 2 wells 
(see Appendices C-5 and C-6).  The probable (developed non-producing and 
undeveloped) well cases assume a hyperbolic decline of 24% per year at exponent b=0.1, 
and the probable plus possible (developed non-producing and undeveloped) well cases 
assume a hyperbolic decline of 18% per year at an exponent b=0.1.  The initial gas 
production rates are based on the drill stem test results of the Cerro Gordo 1 and Cerro 
Gordo 2 wells with a maximum of 2 MMcf per day.  The following summarizes the 
reserve category, initial rate, and decline rate by well (all hyperbolic at exponent b=0.1): 
 
              Initial         Decline 
               Rate   Rate 
Well Name     Reserve Category                              (MMcf/d)   (%/year) 
Cerro Gordo 1          Probable developed non-producing          1.3 24.0  
           Probable plus possible developed non-producing     1.3 18.0 
Cerro Gordo 2          Probable developed non-producing            2.0 24.0 
           Probable plus possible developed non-producing     2.0 18.0  
Cerro Gordo Ph I     Probable undeveloped             2.0 24.0  
           Probable plus possible undeveloped           2.0 18.0 
Cerro Gordo Ph II    Possible undeveloped             2.0 14.0 
 
P-1 is the production model for Phase I or the first 5 undeveloped locations, and P-2 is 
Phase II or the second set of 5 undeveloped locations. Cerro Gordo 1, 2, and five wells in 
Phase I are expected to start production in the third quarter of 2009, and the five wells in 
Phase II are expected to start production in the first quarter of 2010.

IV Evaluation of the Buena Vista Block in the Eastern Cordillera Basin 
 
Delavaco has signed two purchase agreements relating to the Buena Vista Block.  One 
agreement is with Infinity Oil Limited for 30% working interest on August 28, 2008 and 
the other agreement with Petrosouth Energy Corporation Sucursal Colombia for 16% 
working interest on September 16, 2008.  
 
To earn the working interests, Delavaco agrees to pay the following: 
 
1. an amount of $200,000 to Petrosouth Energy as initial payment on or before the 
effective date of the purchase agreement.  Petrosouth Energy must acknowledge that the 
initial payment has been made.  Also, an amount of $3,800,000 (the balance) on or before 
the date that is thirty (30) days from the date of occurrence of a Liquidity Event.  If such 
a Liquidity Event has not occurred on or before December 31, 2008, the balance amount 
would be payable on or before December 31, 2008. 
 
2.  one hundred percent (100%) of the costs of a 3D seismic program on the Buenavista 
block to Infinity Oil, the estimated cost being $3,800,000 gross. The first installment of 
$810,000 was paid on July 1st, 2008; the second installment of $1,226,000 was paid on 
July 20, 2008; the remainder shall be paid pursuant to the 3D Seismic Acquisition and 
Processing Agreement entered into by UTOE and Kinetex Inc. Sucursal Colombia on 
June 27, 2008, and to the 3D Seismic Budget.  Delavaco also agrees to fund one hundred 
percent (100%) of the costs to drill, test, and complete a development well on the 
Buenavista block, and one hundred percent (100%) of the costs to drill, test, and 
complete an exploratory well to eight thousand (8,000) feet on the block. 
 
In addition, the Company agrees that Radial Drilling Services Inc. can earn up to 10% 
undivided participating interest in the Buena Vista Contract by assuming the costs related 
to radial drilling services on the Bochica-1 and Bolivar-1 wells, with the potential of up 
to 5% participating interest per well based on successful results.  The outcome is a 1.5% 
participating interest reduction per well for a total of 3.0%, and a final participating 
interest of 27% in the Buena Vista Contract.  In order to assign the participating interest 
to Radial Drilling Services Inc., the following results must be achieved: 
 

(1) The thirty day average production rate after the application of the technology 
in the Bolivar 1 well will be greater than 150% of the thirty day averaged 
production prior to the application of the technology. 

(2) The thirty day average production after the application of the technology in 
the Bochica-1 (Bethel-1) well will be greater than 100 bop for thirty days of 
production of the application. 

 
The E&P Contract was signed on November 8, 2004 between ANH and Well Logging 
Leda.  The total area of the Buena Vista Block is 10,000.0 hectares (24,710.5 acres).  The 
minimum work program as per Annex B of the E&P Contract is as follows: 
 
Phase Duration Work Program Description 
 



 99 

1          12 months Re-entry of the Bolivar-1 well for fracturing and testing, well log 
interpretation within the area, carrying out geological and 
geophysics assessment, reprocessing all of the seismic available, 
and assessing the Corrales-1 well. 

2 12 months Drill an exploratory well  
3 12 months Acquire 50 km² of 3D seismic 
4 12 months Drill an exploratory well. 
5 12 months Drill an exploratory well. 
6 12 months Drill an exploratory well. 
 
The first two phases have been completed.  The Bethel 1 (Bronchia) well was drilled as 
an exploratory well in Phase 2.   In Phase 3, ANH has approved the change to acquire 50 
km² of 3D seismic instead of re-entry of one well, and drill an exploratory well. 

 

Under the ANH royalty schedule, 15° API is the cutoff for heavy oil. The production is 
expected to produce 15° API oil from the Los Pines formation (6% minimum sliding 
scale royalty) and 19° API oil from the La Luna formation (8% minimum sliding scale 
royalty).  The royalty is estimated at the weighted average rate. 
 
Bolivar-1 Well  

 
The Bolivar-1 well is located 2,788 feet (850 meters) south of the Bochica-1 well.  The 
well was drilled by Gesso in 1989 and tested 58 barrels of oil per day from the La Luna 
fracture chart zone from 2,870' to 2,950'.  The well was suspended due to economic 
restraints at that time, but was put back into production July 2005.  The La Luna 
formation underwent four workovers in order to reduce water production, and the fourth 
workover resulted in stabilized oil rates with minimal water production in June 2006 (see 
Appendix D for Wellbore Diagram).  As of May 31, 2008, the Bolivar-1 La Luna 
formation has produced 94,000 barrels of oil, 15,500 barrels of water, and 4,054 Mcf of 
gas.  In March 2007, the BS&W began to increase, but it has now stabilized at a normal 
incline that is inversely related to oil production (see Figure IV-9).   
 
Electric log interpretation of the Los Pinos formation from 2,770' to 2,780' appears to be 
oil-bearing with higher porosity than the La Luna formation.  The Los Pinos formation is 
expected to be behind pipe potential after the La Luna formation reaches an economic 
limit (see Figure IV-2 for Log Analysis). 
 
Bochica-1 Well  

 
The Bochica-1 well was spudded on August 7, 2007, and drilled to a total depth of 5,368 
feet on September 3, 2007.  The well was then completed and swab tested for 39 days 
until October 12, 2007 (see Appendix C for swab test results).  The primary target was 
the La Luna formation, which is productive in the nearby Bolivar-1 well (see below); 
however, the Bochica-1 well encountered the La Luna formation 900 feet deeper than 
expected.  The 2D Seismic, which had predicted a crestal location, was refined to be 
interpreted as two separate sheets (see 2D Seismic Mapping in the Buena Vista Block). 
 



 100 

The Los Pinos interval was swab tested from 3,404' to 3,416,' and produced 1,350 during 
the test period before being shut-in after BS&W increased to 95%.  Based on cement 
bond log interpretation, it is observed that cement integrity could be compromised 
through the Los Pinos interval and water-bearing high permeability sands above and/or 
below the Los Pinos formation.  As a result, this well is suspended pending a cement 
squeeze and workover of the Los Pinos formation (see Figure IV-3 for Log Analysis).  
 
2D-Seismic Mapping in the Buena Vista Block 

 
Under the work program, 50 km2 of 3D seismic is being acquired.  Prior to the drilling of 
the Bochica-1 well, the Bolivar structure was believed to be a simple anticline.  The La 
Luna formation in the Bochica-1 well came in 900 feet lower (see Figure II-3) than 
expected, and resulted in a re-interpretation of the seismic model.  The new model notes 
that as far back as 1993, several authors (Dengo and Covey) proposed that the structure 
was a thrust ramp similar to those seen at Cusiana to the East (see Figure II-4 and II-5).  
Using this theory, a new model has been created where the Bolivar-Bochica area has two 
independent faulted thrust ramp sheets (see Figure II-6 and II-7).  The two thrust ramp 
sheets are described as Sheet #1 and Sheet #2.  Sheet #1 was created by a sub-horizontal 
fault that moved sediments from west to east.  This fault is flat-lying and turns up on the 
eastern edge, but does not reach the surface.  It contains the Bolivar-1 well but not the 
Bochica-1 well.  The fault between the Bolivar-1 and Bochica-1 wells is essentially 
North-South and appears to lie below the Chicamocha River.  Its eastern termination 
caused overlying weakness in the strata and influenced the location of the river.  This 
additional geological complexity is the reason for postponing the drilling of another 
exploration well for a 3D seismic survey.  Based on the new 2D model, the following 
outlines the areas with attributed reserves:     
       Total Area Attributed Area 
Sheet  Well Name  Formation (acres)  (acres) 
Sheet #1 Bolivar-1   La Luna 100  100 
Sheet #1 Bolivar-1  Los Pinos 100  100 
Sheet #1 Bolivar Extension La Luna 280  80  
Sheet #1 Bolivar Extension  Los Pinos 280  80 
Sheet #2 Bochica-1  Los Pinos 210  105 X 2 wells 
 
In addition to the areas with attributed reserves, the Company has identified numerous 
leads.  These leads are expected to be refined upon completing the acquisition, 
processing, and interpretation of the 3D seismic survey. 
 
Capital Costs and Work Program 
 
The capital cost relating to the work program as per Company's agreements is as follows:

The abandonment cost (net of salvage) is estimated at $200,000 per well, and the 
Company's share of this abandonment cost is $460,000. 
 
Operating Costs  
 
The operating costs are based on historical data, with the fixed operating cost estimated at 
$18,000 per month per well, and the variable operating cost for lifting estimated at $6.50 
per barrel.  These costs may be adjusted to reflect increased production rates.  
 
The variable transportation cost from the field to the international sales terminal at 
Coveñas is as follows: 
 
Trucking from field to Cuisiana   $2.50 per barrel by truck 
Cusiana Station Offloading Fee   $0.25 per barrel 
Cusiana Station to El Porvenir Station  $0.47 per barrel by pipeline 
El Porvenir Station to Vasconia Station  $2.01 per barrel by pipeline 
Vasconia Station to Coveñas Station   $2.46 per barrel by pipeline 
Offloading fee at Coveñas Station   $0.90 per barrel 
Terminal fee at Coveñas Station   $0.43 per barrel 
Total transportation costs    $9.02 per barrel 
 
 
In order to enter into the Ocensa pipeline system, oil must meet a minimum 18.5° API oil 
specification.  The La Luna formation is expected to produce 19° API oil and would 
require no blending.  The Los Pinos formation is expected to produce 15° API oil.  
Blending of the oil would be required to meet pipeline specification.  The evaluation 
assumes a blend ratio of 79% Los Pinos 15° API heavy oil to 21% Cusiana 35° API light 
oil.  Under Canadian Securities disclosure requirement, both 19° API and 15° API oil are 
classified as heavy oil.  Royalties are paid in kind on produced oil and not blended oil.  
Forecast Cusiana 35° API light oil prices are found in Forecast Oil Prices section.

Reserves  
 
Proved plus probable developed producing reserves are assigned to the Bolivar-1 well La 
Luna formation based on historical production performance trends, electric log 
interpretations, 2D-Seismic mapping, and Radial Drilling Technology.  The remaining 
proved developed producing reserve is estimated at 136.3 Mbbl of 19° API oil at an 
economic limit of 15 barrels of oil per day and 95% BS&W.  The remaining proved plus 
probable developed producing reserve is estimated at 245.2 Mbbl of 19° API oil at an 
economic limit of 19 barrels of oil per day and 95% BS&W.  The addition of probable 
developed producing reserve is a result of a successful Radial Drilling Workover.  The 
Radial Drilling Workover is expected to increase well deliverability through jet-drilled 
laterals in conjunction with matrix acidizing.  The laterals are expected to penetrate up to 
120 feet deep into the reservoir and are between 1 and 2 inches in diameter.  The post 
Radial Drilling Workover rates are expected to be up to 167% of the current 90 barrels of 
oil per day. 
 
Proved plus probable developed non-producing reserves are assigned to 105-acres of the 
Bochica-1 well Los Pinos formation based on flow test results, electric log 
interpretations, sidewall samples, 2D-Seismic mapping, and Radial Drilling Technology.  
The remaining proved developed producing reserve is estimated at 165.8 Mbbl of 15° oil 
based on volumetric calculations and 164.9 Mbbl to an economic limit of 15 barrels of oil 
per day.  The remaining proved plus probable developed producing reserves is estimated 
at 222.7 Mbbl 15° API oil based on volumetric calculations and 221.4 Mbbl to an 
economic limit of 15 barrels of oil per day.  The proved developed producing and proved 
plus probable developed producing reserves are a result of a successful cement squeeze 
and Radial Drilling workover.  The Bochica-1 well tested oil at rates in excess of 400 
barrels of oil per day before experiencing high water cut after producing ~1,200 barrels of 
cumulative oil.  The cement bond log shows compromised cement integrity throughout 
the productive interval and there are suspicions that the packer may not be seated. 
 
Proved plus probable developed non-producing reserves are assigned to 100-acres of the 
Bolivar-1 well Los Pinos formation based on Bochica-1 flow test results, electric log 
interpretations, 2D-Seismic mapping, and Radial Drilling Technology.  The proved 
developed non-producing reserve is estimated at 106.0 Mbbl of 15° API oil based on 
volumetric calculations and 105.2 Mbbl to an economic limit of 15 barrels of oil per day.  



 103 

The proved plus probable developed non-producing reserve is estimated at 141.4 Mbbl of 
15° API oil based on volumetric calculations and 142.1 Mbbl to an economic limit of 15 
barrels of oil per day.  The proved developed non-producing and proved plus probable 
developed non-producing reserves are a result of a re-completion of the Los Pinos behind 
pipe potential.  The re-completion will include abandonment of the deeper La Luna 
formation followed by perforation and stimulation the Los Pinos formation using Radial 
Drilling Technology. 
 
Proved plus probable undeveloped reserves are assigned to 105-acres of the Bochica-1 
Offset well Los Pinos formation based on Bochica-1 flow test results, electric log 
interpretation of the Bochica-1, and 2D-Seismic mapping.  Radial Drilling Technology 
has not been considered for this development well because it is assumed that the initial 
completion will include a stimulation treatment.  The proved undeveloped reserve is 
estimated at 222.7 Mbbl of 15° API oil based on volumetric calculations and 220.8 Mbbl 
to an economic limit of 15 barrels of oil per day.  The proved plus probable undeveloped 
reserve is estimated at 296.9 Mbbl of 15° API oil based on volumetric calculations and 
295.3 Mbbl to an economic limit of 15 barrels of oil per day.  The offset location targets 
the Los Pinos formation at the crest of a 2D-Seismic structure that has been tested by the 
Bochica-1 well.  The total closure is 210-acres, and it is expected that two wells will be 
required to drain the closure (see 2D Seismic Mapping Summary). 
 
Possible undeveloped reserve is assigned to 80-acres of the Bolivar Extension-1 well La 
Luna formation based on Bolivar-1 production performance trends, electric log 
interpretation of the Bolivar-1, and 2D-Seismic mapping.  Radial Drilling Technology 
has not been considered for this exploration well because it is assumed that the initial 
completion will include a stimulation treatment.  The possible undeveloped reserve is 
estimated at 316.7 Mbbl of 19° API oil based on volumetric calculations and 316.9 Mbbl 
to an economic limit of 15 barrels of oil per day.  The Bolivar Extension consists of a 
280-acre closure identified by 2D-Seismic.  Of these 280-acres, roughly 80-acres of the 
closure appear to be at the crest and therefore a good exploratory location (see 2D 
Seismic Mapping Summary). 
 
Possible undeveloped reserve is assigned to 80-acres of the Bolivar Extension-2 well Los 
Pinos formation based on Bochica-1 flow test results, electric log interpretation of the 
Bochica-1, and 2D Seismic Mapping.  Radial Drilling Technology has not been 
considered for this exploration well because it is assumed that the initial completion will 
include a stimulation treatment.  The possible undeveloped reserve is estimated at 226.2 
Mbbl of 15° API oil based on volumetric calculations and 225.2 Mbbl to an economic 
limit of 15 barrels of oil per day.  The Bolivar Extension-2 well is expected to be drilled 
in the same 80-acres of the Bolivar Extension-1 well.  An economic evaluation for 
consideration of the Bolivar Extension Los Pinos formation as behind pipe potential in 
the Bolivar Extension-1 exploration well proved uneconomical.  As a result, a separate 
well, the Bolivar Extension-2, was considered in the evaluation.  
 
Production Forecast and Methods  
 



 104 

A rate versus time log plot of the Bolivar-1 La Luna formation oil production resulted in 
two hyperbolic decline rates (see Figure II-8 below).  The first is 24% per year at 
exponent b=0.1, and this is used in the forecasts for (b) through (f) below.  The second is 
21% per year at exponent b=0.1, and this is used in the forecast for (a) below.  When 
water production began to increase in March 2007, the initial incline was drastic but 
followed by a lower incline that is inversely related to the oil production decline.  This is 
the assumption used in forecasting future water production for both the La Luna and Los 
Pinos formations.  The economic limits used in the evaluation are based on 20 barrels of 
oil per day cut off or 95% BS&W cut off.  The water forecast used in the evaluation 
assumes a moderate ESP pump rate to control initiation of water influx.  In our previous 
experience in similar reservoirs, we have observed that high pump rates reduce 
recoverable reserves and increase workover costs.  
 
The following table summarizes the estimated initial oil production rates for each 
formation by well:

The La Luna interval is 2,875' to 2,940'.  The average values are 10.5% in porosity, 35% in water 
saturation is 35% and 40 feet of the net pay thickness.  The Los Pinos interval is 2,770' to 2,780' 
and exhibits the same reservoir properties as the Bochica-1 well but only 10 feet of net pay.

The Los Pinos perforations are from 3,404' to 3,416'.  Based on electric log analysis and sidewall 
cores, the average porosity is 16.5%, the average water saturation is 35% and net pay thickness is 
15 feet.

V Evaluation of the Chicuaco Block in the Llanos Basin 
 
On July 23, 2008, Delavaco signed a farmout agreement with the Farmor to acquire a 
45% participating interest in the Chicuaco Block.  The block has been under an E&P 
Contract with ANH since March 21, 2006. 
 
In order to earn the interest, Delavaco has agreed to pay a sliding scale overriding royalty 
between 2 and 4%, depending on oil price, on its share of the net income, in addition to 
the existing royalty to the ANH, the initial payment of $500,000 on the effective date, 
$3,500,000 US in four installments over a period of 90 days, 600,000 shares of Delavaco, 
seismic costs of its share at $360,000, and the drilling of one well at its share of 
$1,800,000. 
 
The sliding scale overriding royalty is 2% for oil prices below $75 per barrel, 3% for 
prices between $75 and $100 per barrel, and 4% for prices above $100 per barrel. 
 
The participants in the Chicuaco Contract are as follows: 
 
Baraka Colombia Operations Limited Sucursal Colombia     20.0% 
South River Partners LLC Colombian Branch    25.0% 
Trayectoria Oil and Gas Sucursal Colombia     10.0% 
Delavaco Energy Colombia Inc. Sucursal Colombia    45.0% 
    Total               100.0% 
 
The E&P Contract was signed on March 24, 2006 between ANH and Competrol Ltda.  
The total area of the Chicuaco Block is 7,484.9274 hectares (18,495.7acres).  The 
minimum work program as per Annex B of the E&P Contract is as follows: 
 
Phase Duration Work Program Description 
 
1 6 months Acquire and interpret 15 km of 2-D seismic data. 
   Reprocess and interpret 100 km of 2-D seismic data. 
2 12 months Drill one exploratory well to the Guadalupe formation. 
3 12 months Acquire and interpret 40 square km of 3-D seismic data. 
4 12 months Drill one exploratory well. 
 
In this evaluation, the fulfillment of the minimum work program has not been verified, as 
there may be changes to the work program that are subject to the approval of the ANH.   
 
Evaluation 
 
Mugello-1 Well  
 
The Mugello-1 well was drilled to 4,700' in April 2008, and penetrated the Carbonera 5 
(C5) formation at 4,320' (-3,798 TVDSS).  Three tests were conducted from 4,502 to 
4,506 feet, 4,323 to 4,343 feet, and 4,034 to 4,037 feet.  The test results were all either 



 131 

100% water or 100% BS&W.  The operator mentioned that after the test between 4,034 
and 4,037 feet, oil started to come and reported at four barrels of 23 oAPI oil.  Overnight 
the well recovered an additional 9 barrels of oil in six hours.  There was no 
documentation of this oil recovery and cannot be verified.  If the oil recovery was true, a 
proposed Mugello-1 sidetrack to target the C5 formation at the crest of the structure, 
roughly 750' northeast of the current location (see Figure V-3) may encounter 27' of 
gross thickness and 16' of net pay thickness (N/G ratio 60% based on Mugello-1 well).  
The Mugello-1 well was cored in the C5 formation with an average porosity of 21.8% 
and water saturation of 57.3% (see Figure V-4).  The Cabiona 8 well, located in the 
Cabiona Block just northeast of the Chicuaco Block (see Figure V-5), produces 16.3° 
API oil from the Carbonera 5-A and Carbonera C5-B formations (see Figures V-6 to V-
8).  Based on water analysis of the Cabiona 8 well, the Rw in the C5-A and C5-B well is 
between 0.25 and 0.55 ohms @ 82°F (27.7° C).  Using the upper limit, the adjusted Rw 
for the Mugello-1 well is 0.33 ohms @ 141°F (60.5° C), resulting in a water saturation of 
52%.  As of June 2008, the reported production data was 201.1 Mbbl of oil from the two 
wells in both Cabiona 8 and Cabiona 4 (see Figure V-9).  The Cabiona 8 well initial 
production was over 300 bopd from commingled C5-A and C5-B formations, with low 
BS&W after static flow was achieved. 
 
As can be seen in both the electric log sections for the Mugello-1 and Cabiona-8 wells, 
the C5 formation is very susceptible to washout, and the water saturation from sidewall 
core could be compromised.  For the purpose of this evaluation, the water saturation 
calculated based on an actual water analysis of the Cabiona 8 has been adjusted for the 
Mugello-1 as described above. 
 
Chicuaco Block Exploration Development Locations 
 
Based on 3D seismic structure mapping of the C5 formation, there are two potential 
locations.  Both structures are structurally higher than the Mugello-1 expected offset 
(see Figure V-3).  The larger structure is located in the southwest corner of the block and 
has an aerial extent of 117-acres (see Figure V-10).  The smaller structure is located in 
the northeast corner of the block and has an aerial extent of 108-acres (see Figure V-11).  
Detailed volumetric calculations for these two structures are found later in this section. 
 
Capital Cost and Work Program  
 
The capital cost and work program for the Chicuaco Block is summarized as follows:

Total            16,800         9,760 
 
The abandonment cost (net of salvage) is estimated at $100,000 per well, and the 
Company's share of these abandonment costs is $135,000.  
 
Operating Costs  
 
The fixed operating cost is estimated at $12,500 per month per well based on the 
historical operating costs.  Based on a success scenario, this cost could be revised in 
future evaluations to reflect increased production rates.  
 
The variable operating cost for lifting is estimated at $7.50 per barrel based on the 
historical operating costs.  This cost could also be revised in future evaluations based on a 
success scenario.   
 
The variable operating cost for transportation from the Chicuaco Block to the 
international sales terminal at Coveñas is as follows: 
 
The variable transportation cost from the field to the international sales terminal at 
Coveñas is as follows: 
 
Trucking from field to Carcara Sur   $1.20 per barrel by truck 
Carcara Sur Station Offloading Fee   $0.30 per barrel 
Carcara Sur to El Porvenir Station   $0.46 per barrel by pipeline 
El Porvenir Station to Vasconia Station  $2.01 per barrel by pipeline 
Vasconia Station to Coveñas Station   $2.46 per barrel by pipeline 
Offloading fee at Coveñas Station   $0.90 per barrel 
Terminal fee at Coveñas Station   $0.43 per barrel 
Total transportation costs    $7.77 per barrel 
 
In order to enter into the Ocensa pipeline system, oil must meet a minimum 18.5° API oil 
specification.  The C5 formation in the area is expected to produce 16 °API heavy oil and 
consequently will require blending at Caracara Sur Field before entering the Petrobras oil 
sales line to El Porvenir.  The evaluation assumes a blend ratio of 70% Carbonera C5 16° 
API heavy oil to 30% Caracara Sur 25 °API light oil.  According to the ANH, the 16° 
API oil is considered light and medium with a minimum royalty rate of 8% sliding scale.  
Royalties are paid in kind on produced oil and not blended oil.  Forecast Caracara Sur 25 
°API light oil prices are found in the Forecast Oil Prices section.

Reserves/Prospective Resource  
 
No reserve can be assigned as there is no proof of oil recovery in the Mugello 1 well.  For 
this evaluation, prospective resource in the best estimate case is evaluated in the 
Carbonera C5 formation for Mugello-1 Sidetrack (80-acres), the south prospect (117-
acres), and the north prospect (108-acres) based on electric log interpretations, sidewall 
core analysis, 3D seismic interpretations, and test data.  Detailed volumetric calculations 
are found later in this section.   For the low estimate case, all three prospects are 
uneconomical.  There is insufficient technical data for the high estimate case.

VI Evaluation of the Talora Block in the Middle Magdalena Valley 
 
On July 23, 2008, Delavaco signed a farmout agreement with the Farmor to acquire a 
35% participating interest in the Talora Block (see Figure VI-1).  The block has been 
under an E&P Contract with ANH since September 16, 2001. 
 
In order to earn the interest, Delavaco has agreed to pay a sliding scale overriding royalty 
between 2 and 4%, depending on oil price, on its share of the net income, in addition to 
the existing royalty to the ANH, the initial payment of $500,000 on the effective date, 
$2,500,000 US in four installations over a period of 90 days, 600,000 shares of Delavaco, 
a workover cost of its share at $455,000 US and the drilling of a well of its share at 
$1,100,000 US. 
 
The sliding scale overriding royalty is as follows: 

(i) 2% if the oil price per barrel is between $0 and $75 US;  
(ii) 3% if the oil price per barrel is between $75 and $100 US; or  
(iii) 4% if the oil price per barrel is over $100 US.  

 
The E&P Contract was signed on September 16, 2006 between the ANH and Argosy 
Energy International.  The total area of the Talora Block is 43,841.867 hectares 
(108,335.6 acres).  The minimum work program as per Annex B of the E&P Contract is 
as follows: 
 
Phase Duration Work Program Description 
 
1          15 months Reprocess and interpret all available seismic and evaluate existing 

wells within the contract area. 
 Conserve 100% of the contract area for the acquisition, processing, 

and interpretation of 40 km of 2-D seismic program 
 Re-store 15,000 hectares for the acquisition, processing, and 

interpretation of 25 km of 2-D seismic program 
2 12 months Re-enter one well or drill an exploratory well. 
3 9 months Drill an exploratory well. 
4 9 months Drill an exploratory well. 
5 9 months Drill an exploratory well. 
6 9 months Drill an exploratory well. 
 
In this evaluation, the fulfillment of the minimum work program has not been verified, as 
there may be changes to the work program that are subject to the approval of the ANH.   
 
The partners in the Joint Operating Agreement in the Talora Block are as follows: 
 
Gran Tierra Energy Colombia Ltda.     20.0% 
Omega Energy Colombia, Inc.    15.0% 
Petrosouth Energy Corporation Sucursal Colombia  20.0% 
Trayectoria Oil and Gas Sucursal Colombia    10.0%

Delavaco Energy Colombia Inc. Sucursal Colombia  35.0% 
    Total             100.0% 

Talora Block 
 
The Manatial 1 RST Well was drilled in January 2008 and penetrated the Guaduala 
formation at 5,200 feet (TVD); it remains to be tested (see Figures VI-2 to VI-4).  The 
Guaduala formation was also penetrated in the Puli-7 well located just north in the Puli C 
Block (see Figure VI-1).  Based on electric and mud log interpretations of both Manatial 
and Puli-7 wells, the water saturation is estimated at 39.7% using Puli-7 data.  The 
Guaduala formation is the workover candidate as per obligation under the work program.  

 
Exploration Targets 

 
In addition to the workover of the Manatial 1 RST Well, the Company is currently 
evaluating one prospect with targeted formations in the Doima, Chicoral and Monserrate.  
All these formations are productive in the neighbouring Puli B and Puli C blocks, and the 
Mana, Toqui Toqui, Rio Opia, and Ambrosia Fields. 
 
Capital Cost and Work Program  

 
The cost of the Manatial 1RST workover is estimated at $ 1,211,892 (see Figure 10), and 
the work is expected to be completed for Q1 of 2009 with oil production from the 
Guaduala formation.  If the workover is successful, an additional cost of $500,000 is 
required for tank batteries and access maintenance.  The Company's share of the 
workover and additional costs are $599,162.  The abandonment cost (net of salvage) is 
estimated at $150,000, and the Company's share is $52,500. 
 
Operating Costs  

 
The variable cost for lifting is estimated at $7.50 per barrel, and the fixed monthly cost is 
estimated at $12,500 for this well.  It is estimated that the Manatial 1RST well would 
produce 33° API oil from the Guaduala based on extrapolation of the Monserrate 
formation of the Puli 7 well (32.1° API @ 4,400').  The oil is to be transported by truck 
to Abanico Field (located ~20km south of the Talora Block) where it will enter into the 
oil sales pipeline system, with a final destination at the International sales terminal in 
Coveñas.  The expected transportation costs are as follows: 
 
Talora Field to Abanico Field    $3.00 per barrel by truck 
Abanico Field to Chicoral Station (Petrobras) $0.50 per barrel by pipeline 
Chicoral Station to Vasconia Station   $2.01 per barrel by pipeline 
Vasconia Station to Coveñas Station   $2.46 per barrel by pipeline 
Offloading fee at Coveñas Station   $0.90 per barrel 
Terminal fee at Coveñas Station   $0.43 per barrel 
Total transportation costs    $9.30 per barrel

The after tax analysis is based on $4 per net barrel for G&A cost and $1 per net barrel for 
DD&A cost plus a 40% fiscal benefit on capital expenditures related to exploration and 
development for 2008 and 2009.  The Colombia corporate income tax rate is 33% per 
year for 2008 and per year thereafter. 

 
Reserves 
 
Probable plus possible developed non-producing reserves have been assigned to 80 acres 
of well spacing in the Guaduala formation of the Manatial 1RST well.  The reserve is 
assigned based on 2-D seismic mapping, electric, and mud log interpretations.  The 
probable developed non-producing recoverable oil is estimated at 527.7 Mbbl, and the 
probable plus possible developed non-producing recoverable oil is estimated at 791.5 
Mbbl.  Detailed volumetric calculation is found later in this section.  
 
Production Forecast and Methods  
 
The probable and probable plus possible developed non-producing reserves are assigned 
initial production rates and decline rates as follows: 
 
           Initial rate       Decline rate       Exponent  
Reserve Category            (bopd)  (%/yr)   (b)

Probable + possible developed non-producing  541     24   0.1 
 
The production forecast takes into account analog fields in the surrounding area (see 
production plots below).

VII La Punta #2 Well, La Punta Block, Llanos Basin, Colombia 
 
On September 15, 2008, Delavaco has executed an assignment of interest with the 
partners of Union Temporal for 3.6% working interest of the La Punta #2 well only in the 
La Punta Block for an acquisition fee of $3.5 million.  The well is subject to 8% royalty.  
The operator is Ecopetrol. 
 
Based on the seismic interpretation, the La Punta 2 well was drilled to a total depth of 
9,356 feet MD (9,308.8 feet TVD) in June 2008 offsetting the La Punta 1 well.  The La 
Punta 1 has been producing from the Mirador formation since June 2004 and has a 
cumulative production of 2,346,640 barrels of oil and 4,288,966 barrels of water to 
August 24, 2008 with a current choke size of 51/64 inch.  The La Punta 2 well 
encountered the Mirador formation between 8,274 and 8,308 feet (see Figure VII-2) and 
is completed as a flowing well.  Production started on June 23, 2008 and has a cumulative 
production of 87,163 barrels of oil and 121 barrels of water to August 24, 2008 over a 60-
day with 3 days down for maintenance using a choke size of 18/64 inch (average 1,453 
bopd). 
 
Capital Costs and Work Program 
 
There is no capital cost related to this well.  The abandonment cost is estimated at 
$100,000 net of salvage value and the Company's share is anticipated at $3,600. 
 
Operating Costs  
 
The operating costs are based on historical data of La Punta 1 well.  The fixed operating 
cost is estimated at $5,000 per month per well and the variable operating cost for lifting is 
estimated at $5.00 per barrel.  These costs may be adjusted to reflect increased production 
rates.  
 
The variable transportation cost from the field to the international sales terminal at 
Coveñas is as follows: 
 
Trucking from field to Guarimena   $2.00 per barrel by truck 
Guarimena Station Offloading Fee   $0.30 per barrel 
Guarimena Station to El Porvenir Station  $0.46 per barrel by pipeline 
El Porvenir Station to Vasconia Station  $2.01 per barrel by pipeline 
Vasconia Station to Coveñas Station   $2.46 per barrel by pipeline 
Offloading fee at Coveñas Station   $0.90 per barrel 
Terminal fee at Coveñas Station   $0.43 per barrel 
Total transportation costs    $8.57 per barrel 
 
All operating costs are for 2008 and then expected to escalate at 5% per year.

Effective Date    August 31, 2008 
 
Reserves  
 
Proved plus probable developed producing reserves have been assigned to the La Punta 2 
well based on the production performance trends of the La Punta 1, electric log 
interpretation and 3D seismic interpretation.  The La Punta 1 and La Punta 2 wells are in 
competitive drainage within the 237-acre La Punta structure (see Figure VII-3).  Based on 
a volumetric calculation (see detailed calculation later in this section) the entire structure 
has recoverable oil reserves of 5,378.0 Mbbl at recovery factor of 60% and 5,826.2 Mbbl 
at recovery factor of 65%.  Based on a production decline analysis of the La Punta 1 well 
it is expected to produce 3,315.0 Mbbl of proved reserves and 3,457.8 Mbbl of proved 
plus probable reserves (see Figure VII-3).  The remaining recoverable oil in the La Punta 
structure is expected to be drained by the structurally higher La Punta 2 well.  La Punta 2 
well is therefore assigned 2,063.0 Mbbl of proved reserves and proved plus probable 
reserves of 2,368.0 Mbbl at recovery factors of 60% and 65%, respectively.        
 
Production Forecast and Methods  
 
The initial production rate is based on the production data from the La Punta 2 well and 
the decline rate is based on the La Punta 1 well (see Figure VII-4 and VII-7) because 
there is no observed decline on La Punta 2.  The proved developed producing initial rate 
for September 2008 is 2,000 bopd declining exponentially at 36% per year.  The proved 
plus probable developed producing initial rate for September 2008 is 2,000 bopd, then 
2,250 bopd in October 2008 and then decline exponentially at 36% per year.

Note: The La Punta structure (see Figure VII-5) area is based on an O/W contact at 
8,724' (MD) or 7,760' subsea.  Neither La Punta 1 nor La Punta 2 was drilled at the crest 
of the structure and therefore the net pay thickness in the wells is not reflective of the 
entire structure.  The net pay thickness used in the above calculation assumes an 
additional 7 feet of pay based on structure mapping.  This oil would be drained by using 
ESP pumps and the La Punta 1 well is currently equipped with an ESP pump.

Note: High water saturation in core analysis is likely a result of lost oil in sample due to 
naturally fractured and fracture enhanced samples which are a result of the 
sidewall tool.  For accurate sidewall core analysis of water saturation a diamond 
core should be taken.

Appendix H1 – After Tax Analysis for the Rio Magdalena Block 
 

The after tax analysis is based on the following calculations: 
 
(1) Income Before Tax = Before Tax Cash Flow + Capital Expenditures – G&A – 
DD&A – Other Costs 
Where: Before Tax Cash Flow is Revenue after deduction of royalties, capital costs and 
operating costs 
 G&A is net barrels * a dollar amount per barrel 
 DD&A is net barrels * a dollar amount per barrel 
 Other Costs is net barrels * a dollar amount per barrel 
(2) Fiscal Benefit = 40% * Capital Expenditure for 2008 and 2009 
(3) Subtotal Before Tax = (1) – (2) 
(4) Income Tax = (1) * 33% per year for Colombian Corporate Tax Rate 
(5) After Tax Cash Flow = Before Tax Cash Flow – (4)

Appendix H2 – After Tax Analysis for the Carbonera Block 
 

The after tax analysis is based on the following calculations: 
 
(6) Income Before Tax = Before Tax Cash Flow + Capital Expenditures – G&A – 

DD&A – Other Costs 
Where: Before Tax Cash Flow is Revenue after deduction of royalties, 

capital costs and operating costs 
 G&A is net barrels * a dollar amount per barrel 
 DD&A is net barrels * a dollar amount per barrel 

 Other Costs is net barrels * a dollar amount per barrel 
(7) Fiscal Benefit = 40% * Capital Expenditure for 2008 and 2009  
(8) Subtotal Before Tax = (1) – (2) 
(9) Income Tax = (1) * 33% per year for Colombian Corporate Tax Rate 
(10) After Tax Cash Flow = Before Tax Cash Flow – (4)
