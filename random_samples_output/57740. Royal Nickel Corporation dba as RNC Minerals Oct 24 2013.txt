NOTICE TO READER 

The attached report entitled "Technical Report on the Dumont Ni Project, Launay and Trécesson 
Townships, Quebec, Canada" (the "Technical Report") prepared for Royal Nickel Corporation and dated 
July 25, 2013 has been re-filed to correct the following typographical/proofing errors: 

1. In Table 22-4, certain typographical/proofing errors in the numbers have been corrected, making 
these numbers consistent with the numbers used elsewhere in the Technical Report. 

2. In Table 6-3, the mineral resource categories were inadvertently referred to as "Upper" and 
"Middle" and have been corrected to refer to "Indicated" and "Inferred". 

3. In Section 6.1.5.4, the "preliminary assessment" was inadvertently referred to in the first line of 
the second paragraph and has been corrected to refer to the "pre-feasibility study". 

4. In the note to Figure 7.20, "Iron Serpentine" was in advertently left out after "4%" and has been 
added. 

5. In the note to Figure 7.21, there was an error in footnote numbering and has been corrected so 
that "(5)" has been replaced with "(4)". 

6. In the last paragraph of Section 7.7, "Figure 7.22" was inadvertently referred to and has been 
corrected to refer to "Figure 7.23". 

7. In Section 13.5.6, the number of samples completed was corrected from "75" to "102". 

8. The title of Table 13-33 has been corrected to reflect the data in the table. 

Other than as noted above, the Technical Report remains the same in all respects.

1 SUMMARY 

1.1 Introduction 
Royal Nickel Corporation (RNC) is a mineral resource company headquartered in Toronto, 
Canada, primarily focused on the exploration, evaluation, development and acquisition of base 
metal and platinum group metal properties. RNC's principal asset is the Dumont Nickel project 
(Dumont project) located in the established Abitibi mining camp, 25 km northwest of Amos, 
Quebec. RNC acquired a 100% interest in the Dumont property in 2007. The mineral claims 
covering the Dumont deposit are currently held 98% by RNC and 2% by Ressources Québec.  

Ausenco Solutions Canada Inc. (Ausenco) was commissioned by RNC in May 2012 to complete 
the feasibility study (FS) and the NI 43-101 compliant technical report on the project. This 
technical report was prepared to provide RNC with sufficient information to determine the 
economic feasibility of developing the Dumont deposit, and to decide whether and on what 
basis to proceed with construction.  

In addition, SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc. (SRK) was engaged to prepare the geology, resource 
estimate, tailings management, hydrogeology, hydrology, geotechnical and closure planning 
inputs. Snowden Mining Industry Consultants Inc. (Snowden) was retained for mine design, 
mine operating costs, mine capital costing, and reserve estimation. GENIVAR Inc. (GENIVAR) 
was engaged to provide inputs to the environmental and permitting aspects of the project. 
Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) contributed to the environmental geochemistry investigations. 
Norascon contributed to civil engineering design and costing. 

The Dumont project is located in the province of Quebec in the municipalities of Launay and 
Trécesson approximately 25 km by road northwest of the city of Amos, 60 km northeast of the 
industrial and mining city of Rouyn-Noranda and 70 km northwest of the city of Val d'Or. Amos 
has a population of 12,584 (2006 Census) and is the seat of the Abitibi County Regional 
Municipality (Figure 1.1).  

No historical mining or production has been conducted on the Dumont property. However, for 
the past 100 years, the Val d'Or - Rouyn-Noranda region surrounding the Dumont property has 
been and continues to be a prolific mining area.  

All amounts expressed in this report are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. 

1.2 Geology & Mineralization 
The Dumont sill lies within the Abitibi subprovince of the Superior geologic province of the 
Archean age Canadian Shield. The sill is one of several mafic to ultramafic intrusive bodies that 
form an irregular, roughly east-west alignment, between Val d'Or, Quebec and Timmins, 
Ontario. It comprises a lower ultramafic zone which averages 450 m in true thickness and an 
upper mafic zone about 250 m thick. The ultramafic zone is subdivided into the lower peridotite, 
dunite and upper peridotite subzones. Cumulus nickel (Ni) sulphide and alloy minerals occur in 
parts of the dunite subzone and locally in the lower peridotite to form the Dumont deposit.

Disseminated nickel mineralization is characterized by disseminated blebs of pentlandite 
((Ni,Fe)9S8), heazlewoodite (Ni3S2), and the ferronickel alloy, awaruite (Ni2.5Fe), occurring in 
various proportions throughout the sill. These minerals can occur together as coarse 
agglomerates, predominantly associated with magnetite, up to 10,000 µm (10 mm), or as 
individual disseminated grains ranging from 2 to 1,000 µm (0.002 to 1 mm). Nickel can also 
occur in the crystal structure of several silicate minerals including olivine and serpentine. 

The observed mineralogy of the Dumont deposit is a result of the serpentinization of a dunite 
protolith, which locally hosted a primary, disseminated (intercumulus) magmatic sulphide 
assemblage. The serpentinization process whereby olivine reacts with water to produce 
serpentine, magnetite and brucite creates a strongly reducing environment where the nickel 
released from the decomposition of olivine is partitioned into low-sulphur sulphides and newly 
formed awaruite. The final mineral assemblage and texture of the disseminated nickel 
mineralization in the Dumont deposit and the variability has been controlled primarily by the 
variable degree of serpentinization that the host dunite has undergone.  

Upon acquiring the Dumont property, RNC conducted an initial exploration drilling program in 
2007 to confirm the historic drilling results. Results from this drilling campaign confirmed the 
historical drilling results and encouraged RNC to embark on an extensive drilling campaign to 
fully evaluate the Dumont deposit. RNC has since conducted core diamond drilling on the 
Dumont property for the purposes of exploration, resource definition, metallurgical sampling and 
bedrock geotechnical investigation. Exploration for nickel mineralization on the Dumont property 
has focussed primarily on diamond drilling due to the lack of outcrop over the ultramafic portions 
of the Dumont intrusive which host the nickel mineralization. This drilling was initially targeted 
using data from historical drilling and airborne electromagnetic and magnetic surveys. RNC has 
also conducted core drilling and cone penetration testing for the purpose of overburden 
geotechnical characterization. RNC has undertaken an extensive mineralogical sampling 
program to map mineralogical variability within the Dumont deposit.  

1.3 Resources & Reserves 
The mineral resource estimate for the Dumont project is presented in Table 1-1; Dumont 
mineral reserves are summarized in Table 1-2.  

The mineral resource estimate was prepared by Mr. Sébastien Bernier, P.Geo, Principal 
Consultant (Resource Geology) at SRK. The effective date of the current resource estimate is 
30 April 2013. The mineral resource estimate considers drilling information available to 
31 December 2012 and was evaluated using a geostatistical block modelling approach 
constrained by seven sulphide mineralization wireframes. The mineral resources have been 
estimated in conformity with the CIM "Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Estimation Best 
Practices" guidelines and were classified according to the CIM Standard Definition for Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves (November 2010) guidelines. The mineral resources are 
reported in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101. 
SRK is unaware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, 
marketing, and political or other relevant issues that may materially affect the mineral resources. 

In addition to nickel, SRK modelled the abundance distribution of seven other main elements:  
calcium, cobalt, chromium, iron, palladium, platinum, and sulphur as well as specific gravity.

To facilitate RNC's evaluation of nickel recovery, SRK also constructed estimation models of 
mineral abundances. Specifically, SRK modelled the abundance distribution of awaruite, brucite, 
coalingite, high iron serpentine, heazlewoodite, serpentine, low-iron serpentine, magnetite, 
olivine and pentlandite. The mineral model was constructed to support ongoing metallurgical 
studies. 

Reserves were prepared under the direction of David A. Warren, Eng., Principal Consultant - 
Mining with Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, based on the mineral resource block model 
described above. Reserves are estimated within an engineered pit design which is based upon 
a Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) optimized pit shell generated using only nickel values and a nickel 
price of US$5.58/lb, which is 62% of the long-term forecast of US$9.00/lb and include mining 
losses of 0.28% and dilution of 0.49%.  

1.4 Mining 
The open pit mine has been designed to provide ore to the plant in a manner that optimises net 
present value. The initial plant throughput is 52.5 kt/d, with expansion in Year 5 to 105 kt/d. The 
sequence of mining phases is given in Figure 1.2, with a high level summary of the overall 
mining sequence being as follows: 

• Mining initiates in the southeast pit at the extreme southeast of the deposit. The southeast pit 
is mined out prior to mill start-up to provide a water reservoir for process operations, a source 
of waste rock for construction and a stockpile of ore to use in commissioning the mill.  

• Upon completion of the southeast pit, the focus of operations will move to the main pit (Phase 
1). By Year 2 of mill operations, ex-pit mine production will average 200 kt/d. 

• The pit will be pushed back progressively along strike (NW – SE), as well as into the hanging 
wall to access deeper mineralization. Following expansion of the mill to 105 kt/d in Year 5, the 
mining rate will progressively increase to 375 kt/d.  

• Upon completion of the Main Zone Southeast Extension (SEE) in Year 18, the void will be 
backfilled with waste rock from the final phases of mining to the northwest.  

A key component of the mine plan is the accelerated release of ore from the pit, with higher 
value ore being fed directly to the mill and lower value material being temporarily stockpiled. 
During the life of pit, a total of 606 Mt will be loaded to the low-grade stockpiles. Of this, 103 Mt 
of the highest value stockpile material will be reclaimed during the initial 20 years that the pit is 
still active. The remaining 503 Mt will be reclaimed after pit closure, extending the life of project 
for a total of 33 years.  

Stockpiling lower-value material maximises the value of material treated during the initial years. 
Annual output averages 68 Mlbs payable Ni during the first 4.5 years of production (2016 to 
2020), when the concentrator throughput is 52.5 kt/d. Annual output increases to 104 Mlbs for 
2021 to 2036 when the pit is active. After the pit is depleted and processing of stockpile material 
only commences, annual output drops to an average of 65 Mlbs.

The strategy of accelerated mining has the additional advantage of creating a void, which would 
accommodate approximately 43% of the tailings produced, thus reducing the surface footprint of 
operations. 

Approximately 85% of the total 2,514 Mt that will be excavated from the Dumont pit will be 
mined using large rotary electric blast hole drills (311 mm holes and 15 m benches), rope 
shovels (43 m3 dipper) and 230 t payload trucks. A further 10% of the ex-pit total will be mined 
using rotary diesel blast hole drills (250 mm holes and 10 m benches), large hydraulic 
excavators (34 m3 dipper) and 230 t payload trucks. The remaining 5% of material, comprising 
clay and rock at the sub-outcrop, will be mined with percussion drills (102 mm holes and 5 m 
benches), small hydraulic excavators (7 m3 dipper) and 55 t payload trucks. Production 
equipment will be supported by various units of support equipment, including tracked dozers, 
wheel dozers, front end loaders, graders, water tankers and utility excavators.  

The bulk of the mining fleet will be purchased and operated by the Owner. A local mining 
contractor with experience operating in similar environments has been pre-selected to assist in 
the mining operation, particularly during the initial years of operation. 

The 2,514 Mt excavated from the pit is comprised of 1,179 Mt ore, 1,159 Mt waste rock, 126 Mt 
overburden that is mainly sand and gravel, and 50 Mt clay. Approximately 20% of waste rock 
excavated from the pit will be used to construct the tailings storage facility (TSF) and haul roads. 
The remainder will be impounded in dumps located on the hanging wall side of the pit. 
Approximately 56% of waste rock is either gabbro or basalt, and has excellent properties for 
construction. These rock types will be used to produce roadstone for surfacing roads, in order to 
reduce dust emissions and improve hauling performance.

In addition to the 50 Mt of clay excavated from the pit, a further 13 Mt will be excavated from the 
key trench beneath the TSF dam wall for a total of 63 Mt. This clay occurs as either brown clay, 
which will be used for construction of the TSF or reclamation activities, or grey clay, which has 
no productive use. Brown clay is estimated to comprise 9 Mt of the total, including 5 Mt from the 
pit and 4 Mt from the key trench. The 54 Mt of grey clay, including 45 Mt from the pit and 9 Mt 
from the key trench, will be impounded within cells constructed using sand and gravel or waste 
rock and located on the hanging wall side of the pit. Sand and gravel will be used for some 
construction activities, as well as reclamation of waste dumps (as various sub-lithologies within 
the sand and gravel horizon support organics). The remaining sand and gravel will be 
impounded in waste dumps located on the hanging wall side of the pit.  

Low-grade ore will be located in three distinct dumps depending on NSR value. The highest 
value stockpile will be located closest to the primary crusher and will be reclaimed first, while the 
lowest value stockpile will be adjacent to the main waste rock dump.  

Infrastructure to support the mining operation will include: 

• a roadstone crusher; 

• a workshop and associated warehouse (equipment will be maintained under a maintenance 
contract initially, with a phased handover to in-house personnel as experience is gained); 

• a fuel farm and associated fuelling bays; and 

• an explosives manufacture facility and magazine. As is the norm in Canada, this will be 
operated by the explosives supplier. 

The Owner's labour complement averages 331 persons over the life of project, including 463 
while the pit is active and 116 during reclaim of the low grade stockpile. These totals do not 
include personnel allocated to TSF construction, who would average a further 34 during the 20 
years that construction of the TSF is active. The Contractor's complement will average 95 
persons during the 8 years that the Contractor is active. 

1.5 Metallurgy 
The objective of the metallurgical studies was to quantify the metallurgical response of the 
Dumont ultramafic nickel mineralization. The program was designed to develop the parameters 
for process design criteria for crushing, grinding, nickel flotation, magnetic recovery and 
dewatering in the processing plant.  

One hundred and two grindability samples were submitted to SGS Mineral Services (Lakefield) 
to complete a suite of grinding characterization tests including Bond ball work index (BWi), Bond 
rod work index (RWi), SMC test, and abrasion index (AI). Included in the 102 samples, 10 
samples were from the PQ sized core metallurgical variability samples to complete crusher work 
index (CWi) and JK drop weight tests (JK DWT). 

Overall, the ore demonstrated an increase in hardness with finer size, which is typical for many 
ores. The majority of the test results (percentile 10th to 90th), for the tests performed at coarse 
size (JK drop-weight test and the SMC test) ranged from moderately soft to medium with an 
average Axb of 54. In the Bond rod mill grindability test (medium size range) the majority of the 
samples fell in the medium to moderately hard range with an average RWi of 15 kWh/t. At fine 
size (Bond ball mill work index and modified Bond tests), the bulk of the test results fall within 
the hard to very hard range with an average BWi of 21 kWh/t. The Bond low-energy impact test 
is the exception; the test uses the coarsest rocks, but the sample tested were categorized as 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

1-8 

  

moderately hard to hard with an average CWi of 14 kWh/t. Overall the hardness seen in the 102 
samples shows a very small range of variability compared with other deposits. 

A standard test procedure (STP) to quantify nickel recovery was developed and applied to 105 
metallurgical variability samples. The metallurgical variability samples were selected to 
represent the compositional range of mineralization and to be spatially representative within the 
pit shell. 

The 105 STP tests formed the basis for the rougher nickel recovery equations. The 105 STP 
samples were divided into four metallurgical domains based on their mineralogy. Metallurgical 
test results show a clear correlation between mineralogical variations related to degree of 
serpentinization and metallurgical recovery of nickel. Four metallurgical domains have therefore 
been established that correspond to these serpentinization domains. They are defined 
mineralogically on the basis of heazlewoodite to pentlandite ratio (Hz/Pn) and iron-rich 
serpentine abundance.  These are Heazlewoodite Dominant, Mixed Sulphide, Pentlandite 
Dominant, and High Iron Serpentine.  

In all cases the recovery was largely driven by the amount of sulphur in the feed, even for the 
very low sulphur samples where the main recoverable mineral is awaruite. This may correlate 
with the amount of nickel present as unrecoverable nickel in silicate minerals, which is variable 
within known limits throughout the deposit, and is generally higher in the lower sulphide 
samples. 

Seventeen locked cycle tests were completed on different samples to assess the cleaner 
performance across a variety of feed characteristics. The locked cycle tests showed a wide 
variation in cleaner recovery. The cleaner recovery was found to be strongly correlated to the 
sulphur in the ore.  

Overall, once the rougher and cleaner recovery equations were applied, the average nickel 
recovery over the life of the project is 43%. 

An additional five locked cycle tests were performed to provide confirmation of the feasibility 
design and the recovery equations. Although there is some variability around the model, the 
overall recovery from the locked cycle tests is shown in Figure 1.3 compared to the recovery 
model used in the feasibility study.  Overall the FS recovery model is predicting the Ni recovery 
demonstrated in the locked cycle tests. The red squares are the 2013 confirmation tests, the 
blue diamonds are from previous locked cycle tests performed under similar conditions. 

Byproduct credits for cobalt (Co), platinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) were included in the financial 
analysis. The cobalt recovery is 42% over the life of the project.   The calculated Pt + Pd grade 
in concentrate over the life of the project is 4.3 g/t, based on an average PGE recovery of 61%.  

Based on the concentrate assays from the locked cycle test results and the nickel tenor of the 
recoverable minerals within each metallurgical domain, the concentrate grade has been 
estimated to be 29% Ni over the life of the project, with a range of 22 to 33%. Other impurities, 
such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb), chlorine (Cl) and phosphorus (P), were all near or below 
detection limits in the measured samples. The main impurities in the concentrate are MgO and 
SiO2. The measured MgO levels range from 3 to 13% and the average concentrate is expected 
to be between 7% and 10%, which is in line with the MgO content in concentrates produced by 
other ultramafic operations.

1.6 Mineral Processing 
The process plant and associated service facilities will process ore delivered to primary 
crushers to produce nickel concentrate and tailings. The proposed process encompasses 
crushing and grinding of the run-of-mine (ROM) ore, desliming via hydrocyclone circuit, slimes 
rougher flotation, slimes cleaner flotation, nickel sulphide rougher flotation, nickel sulphide 
cleaning flotation, magnetic recovery of sulphide rougher and cleaner tailings, regrinding of 
magnetic concentrate and an awaruite recovery circuit (consisting of rougher and cleaner 
flotation stages). 

Concentrate will be thickened, filtered and stockpiled on site prior to being loaded onto railcars 
or trucks for transport to third-party smelters. The slimes flotation tailings, magnetic separation 
tailings and awaruite rougher tailings will be combined and thickened before TSF placement. 

The process plant will be built in two phases. Initially, the plant will be designed to process 
52.5 kt/d with allowances for a duplicate process expansion to increase plant capacity to 
105 kt/d. Common facilities will include concentrate thickening and handling and sulphuric acid 
off-loading and containment.  

The key criteria selected for the base and expansion plant designs are: 

• nominal base plant treatment rate of 52.5 kt/d and a nominal expansion plant treatment rate 
52.5 kt/d for a combined 105 kt/d treatment rate; 

• design availability of 92% (after ramp-up), which equates to 8,059 operating hours per year, 
with standby equipment in critical areas; and 

• sufficient plant design flexibility for treatment of all ore types at design throughput. 

A schematic of the process plant is provided in Figure 1.4.

1.7 Infrastructure 
The project site is well serviced with respect to other infrastructure, including: 

• Road – Provincial Highway 111 runs along the southern boundary of the property. 

• Rail – The Canadian National Railway (CNR) runs through the property, slightly to the north 
of Highway 111 but south of the engineered pit. 

• Power – The provincial utility, Hydro-Quebec, has indicated that it would be feasible to 
provide electrical power to the mine site via a 10.5 km long 120 kV overhead powerline to be 
constructed, which would be connected as a tee-off to an existing line. The line will enter the 
property from the south near the security entrance gate, and runs up to the process plant 
main 120 kV substation. 

• Water – Water for start-up will be provided by surface water storage at the Southeast 
Reservoir and, possibly, local groundwater wells. During operations, water demand will 
largely be met by recycling water from the TSF. Make-up water and freshwater requirements 
will be provided by the Southeast Reservoir. A water treatment plant will be constructed in 
approximately the year 2022 to treat excess water from the TSF prior to its discharge to the 
Villemontel River. 

• Natural Gas – Although the use of natural gas is not considered in this study, an existing 
pipeline extends to within approximately 25 km to the south of the property.  

Both the initial and expansion phases of the Dumont project will require three 120:13.8 kV 
60/80 MVA main transformers. The new 120 kV substation and six main transformers will be 
installed near the SAG Mill Feed Conveyor. The 13.8 kV medium voltage network will be used 
for the primary electrical distribution and for feeding large loads such as the SAG mill and ball 
mills. 

A rail spur that services the process plant is proposed for the project. The total length of the rail 
spur is approximately 5 km. The rail spur initially consists of a fuel delivery track near the mining 
truckshop and a freight delivery track north of the process plant. The process plant area 
consists of the crushing facility, covered stockpile and process plant building. The overall 
process plant enclosed structure is approximately 350 m long, and consists of four connected 
buildings:  grinding, flotation, cleaning, and filtration.  

The TSF will be situated approximately 400 m west of the process plant and consists of two 
cells. Cell 1 will be constructed initially, followed by Cell 2 during Year 6 of operations. 

The TSF is designed to store approximately 680 Mt of tailings produced over a period of 
approximately 20 years. Once mining has ceased at the open pit, stockpiled ore will be 
processed for approximately 13 years and those tailings, approximately 498 Mt, will report to the 
open pit.  

1.8 Environmental 
The assessment of environmental risks and potential impacts conducted to date originates 
principally from the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) performed as part of 
the Dumont project permitting process and integrates a number of studies performed by RNC 
and its consultants over the past five years. Biophysical data come mainly from three distinct 
fieldwork programs performed from 2007 to 2009, with some complementary information 
extracted from the ongoing baseline studies designed to support the ESIA in 2011 and 2012.

These environmental baseline studies have not identified any specific inordinate environmental 
risk to project development. Environmental sensitivities are primarily related to potential impacts 
associated with the scale and footprint of the proposed operation, and the composition of 
materials being handled and impounded on the site. Principal impacts anticipated at this stage 
relate to air quality, wetlands, fish habitat, water resources (surface and groundwater), and the 
social environment. 

To limit environmental impact to one drainage basin, RNC has elected to limit project 
infrastructure to within the St. Lawrence drainage basin. RNC has also observed a one-
kilometre buffer zone between surrounding esker aquifers and project infrastructure.  

Although three "at risk" plant species were found within the study area defined for the Dumont 
ESIA, the current project development plans would not affect the locations where these species 
were observed. The environmental characterization underlined the presence of rock vole, a 
small mammal species likely to be listed on Quebec's threatened or vulnerable species list. 
Mitigation measures aiming at promoting rock vole habitat were introduced in the ESIA. The 
presence of three "at risk" bird species was noted during the ESIA:  olive-sided flycatcher, rusty 
blackbird, and common nighthawk. A mitigation measure intended to protect nests during the 
nesting period was implemented in the ESIA to reduce direct impact on these species. 

Results of the ESIA demonstrates that most of the impacts anticipated from the Dumont project 
are qualified as low or very low once general and specific mitigation measures are applied. Only 
one impact is qualified as very important or important, namely the risk of nitrogen dioxide 
formation due to blasting at concentrations likely to affect health as this phenomenon has not 
yet been modelled and precise impacts could not be evaluated. Atmospheric dispersion 
modelling studies of airborne nitrogen dioxide concentrations during blasting will allow a more

precise assessment of the health risks and whether specific preventive measures are required 
within the framework of the emergency response plan. These types of emissions are not unique 
to the Dumont project but are common to all open pit operations.   

Environmental geochemistry characterization of tailings, waste and ore indicate that these 
materials will be non-acid-generating due to their low sulphur content and high neutralization 
potential. Static tests indicate that waste rock and ore are leachable under the conditions of the 
tests, but kinetic tests that are more representative of anticipated site conditions showed that 
leachability is very low, meets Quebec effluent criteria and meets Quebec groundwater quality 
criteria in the long-term. The waste rock and tailings also demonstrate significant potential for 
permanent carbon sequestration through spontaneous mineral carbonation. 

1.9 Community 
Mindful of the interest shown by host communities following the announcement of the Dumont 
project, RNC voluntarily initiated a public information and consultation process during the 
exploration phase. The process aims to ensure effective communication and dissemination of 
information about the project, and to document the concerns, comments and suggestions of the 
host communities to refine the technical and economical studies where possible, and has 
helped define the content of the environmental impact study.  

To ensure a rigorous approach and to facilitate dialogue with the company, RNC retained the 
services of a social harmonization firm, Transfert Environnement. Acting as a third party during 
the consultation activities, its role was to support RNC in the coordination of the consultation 
activities and to produce the minutes and reports documenting the discussions and how RNC 
integrated them into the design of the Dumont project.  

All information and consultation activities were documented and concerns expressed by the 
stakeholders were compiled. Results of consultations were submitted to the relevant authorities, 
and filed as a public document on RNC's website. 

The following types of communication were used during the consultation process: 

• information sessions; 

• open house events and site visits; 

• feedback activities; 

• establishment of advisory committees: 

− expanded advisory committee; 

− municipalities/company round-table; and 

• information and consultation processes for the Abitibiwinni First Nation in Pikogan.

The estimates are considered to have an overall accuracy ±15% and assume the project will be 
developed on an EPCM basis. 

Major cost categories (permanent equipment, material purchase, installation, subcontracts, 
indirect costs and Owner's costs) were identified and analyzed. To each of these categories, a 
percentage of contingency was allocated based on the accuracy of the data, and an overall 
contingency amount was derived in this fashion.

1.12 Economic Analysis 
The Dumont Nickel project is expected to produce 2.8 billion pounds payable Ni over 33 years 
of operation. Table 1-7 summarizes key metrics for the current FS design. The costs and 
returns for the FS assume a long-term nickel price of US$9.00/lb Ni and a Canadian dollar 
exchange rate of US$0.90. A full list of price assumptions and further details can be found in 
Section 22.

The NPV reported in Table 1-7 is in real, Q2 2013, terms with the start date for discounting 
being the commencement of project construction in September 2014. No material expenditures 
are expected prior to this date. 

The post-tax NPV includes planned changes to the fiscal tax regimes that include:  

• the phasing out of categories that allow for accelerated depreciation of pre-production 
expenditures; 

• the phasing out of the investment tax credit; and 

• a fundamental change to the Quebec mining tax regime, with the new regime including both a 
minimum tax that would be payable from the outset of commercial operations and a variable 
tax that would increase as a function of profitability. 

The NPV is most sensitive to factors impacting on revenue, with the impact of a ±10% variation 
in Ni price or Ni recovery having a 37% impact on NPV. The project is also sensitive to 
exchange rate, with a 10% change in exchange rate impacting NPV by over 30%. The project is 
less sensitive to costs, with a 10% change in total site operating costs having a 17% impact on 
NPV, while a 10% change in total capital has an 11% impact.  

The peak funding requirement is $1,320 M, which is reached during the first quarter of mill 
operations. While the project economics are based on equity only, based on a potential debt 
financing of approximately 60% of the total invested capital, payback of debt finance would be 
achieved in the third year of operation, allowing for re-investment in the expansion of 
concentrator capacity to 105 kt/d. The expansion would be commissioned during Year 5 of 
operation. Following the expansion, annual free cash flow increases to over $310 M for the 
period that the pit is operational and payback of all invested capital (including the expansion) is 
achieved approximately 6.1 years after the initial start-up. After the pit is depleted and low- 
grade stockpiles are treated, free cash flow averages $210 M annually, due to the low cost 
structure of the operation. 

1.13 Project Implementation 
Overall schedule duration from commencement of basic engineering (to order long-lead 
equipment) to the end of ore commissioning is 36 months. Key milestone dates are described in

1.14 Conclusions & Recommendations 
The investigation and analysis carried out are considered appropriate to feasibility level mine 
design. Further investigations are recommended as the project advances to detailed design. 

Recommendations for future work are listed below: 

• Continue environmental permitting process; 

• Continue environmental baseline studies; 

• Complete detailed design that considers the following points: 

− Evaluate opportunities for pit optimization, including: 

o Alternative mining sequences that may allow access to higher value ore to be 
accelerated and/or deferral of waste stripping; and 

o Evaluate alternative ramp locations in the pit stages taking advantage of changes 
in wall slopes. 

− Continue to monitor the opportunity of implementing trolley-assisted truck haulage. 
Factors that should be considered before a decision is ultimately made include the 
relative prices of diesel and electricity, the regional availability of electricity, changing 
legislation regarding emissions from fossil fuels and the development of trolley-assist 
technology; 

− Begin detailed engineering in Q3 2013 and procure long lead equipment in order to 
maintain the Q3 2016 plant operational date; 

− Undertake detailed geotechnical evaluations of the early rock exposures, throughout the 
open pit areas, to assess the reliability of structural and geotechnical models. Optimize 
design based on field performance of pit slopes in the various geotechnical domains; 

− Continue to collect and evaluate pore pressure data from existing piezometer installations 
within the pit slope areas to verify the assumption that these will have a limited impact on 
slope stability; 

− Conduct further geotechnical investigations to define the extent, thickness and, in some 
cases, the location-specific strength of the weak, soft soils beneath all surface 
infrastructure, including the plant site area and related facilities, rail lines, TSF Cell 1, the 
low-grade ore stockpile within the pit limits, and water management features that have a 
significant earthworks component to them and are required within the first few years of 
operation; 

− Implement a metallurgy testwork program that will include:   

o Trade-off study to evaluate removal of slimes circuit; 
o Reagent optimization testwork; 
o Concentrate thickening and filtration testwork; 
o Slimes cyclone pilot scale testing for detailed engineering design; 
o Awaruite recovery circuit optimization; 
o Recovery opportunities from scavenger non-magnetic stream; and 
o Complete testwork to quantify grindability characteristics of regrind mill feed. 

• Specific high voltage power studies as recommended for confirmation of high voltage supply 
by Hydro Quebec; 

• Continue mining lease process;

• Initiate surface lease process; 

• Continue to investigate the natural cementation of tailings and waste fines and its impact on 
reducing the potential for these project components to act as dust sources; 

• Continue stakeholder consultation during detailed engineering as well as during mine 
operations to minimize and/or mitigate the impact of the project and foster acceptance. Define 
the structure of stakeholder committees that will be created during mine construction and 
operations; and 

• Continue to assess the carbon sequestration potential of spontaneous mineral carbonation of 
tailings and waste rock on an operational basis and its impact on the carbon footprint of the 
project.

2 INTRODUCTION 

2.1 Background 
RNC is a Toronto, Canada headquartered mineral resource company focused primarily on the 
exploration, evaluation, development, and acquisition of base metal and platinum group metal 
properties. RNC's principal asset is the Dumont Nickel project (Dumont project) located in the 
established Abitibi mining camp, 25 km northwest of Amos, Quebec. RNC acquired a 100% 
interest in the Dumont property in 2007. The mineral claims covering the Dumont deposit are 
currently held 98% by RNC and 2% by Ressources Québec. 

This technical report, prepared for RNC and dated July 25, 2013, as well as the resource 
estimate, has been prepared in compliance with the disclosure and reporting requirements set 
forth in the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101), 
Companion Policy 43-101CP, and Form 43-101F1. 

2.2 Project Scope & Terms of Reference 
This technical report was prepared for RNC by Ausenco to provide RNC with sufficient 
information to determine the economic feasibility of developing the Dumont deposit. 

Ausenco was commissioned by RNC in May 2012 to prepare the feasibility study and NI 43-101 
compliant technical report on the project. SRK was engaged to prepare the resource estimate, 
hydrogeology, hydrology and geotechnical inputs and to supervise geology inputs. David 
Penswick, a private mining consultant, was engaged for mine design, mine operating costs, 
mine capital costing and economic modelling. Snowden reviewed and qualified the mine design, 
and Ausenco reviewed and qualified the economic modelling. GENIVAR has been engaged 
since 2007 to conduct environmental studies on behalf of RNC for the Dumont project and 
prepare the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). Golder Associates Ltd. 
(Golder) prepared the environmental geochemistry investigations. In September 2012 Norascon 
was selected for the overburden pre-stripping phase allowing further early operational de-risking 
and optimization to be included in the feasibility study through integration of Norascon's local 
experience in overburden stripping and tailings storage facility construction into project design. 

The feasibility study has, at its focus, the Dumont low-grade ultramafic nickel deposit. However, 
RNC has explored extensively throughout the Dumont property and this report presents some 
new information in relation to exploration, data, and detailed geology outside of this deposit in 
Section 10.6. 

The Dumont project consists of an open pit mine and an associated processing facility along 
with on-site and off-site infrastructure to support the operation. The mine, process plant and 
associated infrastructure are designed to initially process 52.5 kt/d of ore, with expansion to 
105 kt/d in Year 5.

3 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
In preparing this report, Ausenco has relied on input from RNC and a number of well-qualified, 
independent consulting groups. 

Ausenco is not an expert in legal, land tenure, or environmental matters. Ausenco has relied on 
data and information provided by RNC and on previously completed technical reports (refer to 
Section 27 for details). Although Ausenco has reviewed the available data and visited the site, 
these activities serve to validate only a portion of the entire data set. Therefore, Ausenco has 
made judgments about the general reliability of the underlying data; where deemed either 
inadequate or unreliable, the data were either not used or procedures were modified to account 
for the lack of confidence in that specific information. 

While exercising all reasonable diligence in checking, confirming and testing it, Ausenco has 
relied upon RNC's presentation of its project data and that of previous operators of the Dumont 
property, in formulating its opinion.  

The various agreements under which RNC holds title to the mineral claims for this project have 
not been reviewed by Ausenco, and Ausenco offers no legal opinion as to the validity of the 
mineral title claimed. A description of the property, and ownership thereof, is provided for 
general information purposes only. Comments on the state of environmental conditions, liability, 
and estimated costs of closure and remediation have been made where required by NI 43-101. 
In this regard Ausenco has relied on the work of GENIVAR and other experts it understands to 
be appropriately qualified, and Ausenco offers no opinion on the state of the environment on the 
property. The statements are provided for information purposes only.  

The descriptions of geology, mineralization and exploration used in this report are taken from 
reports prepared by various companies or their contracted consultants. The conclusions of this 
report rely on data available in published and unpublished reports supplied by the various 
companies which have conducted exploration on the property, and information supplied by 
RNC. The information provided to RNC was supplied by reputable companies or government 
agencies and Ausenco has no reason to doubt its validity. 

Ausenco has relied upon RNC's legal counsel for legal input for Sections 4.3 and 4.4.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION & LOCATION 

4.1 Location 
The Dumont property is located in the province of Quebec, approximately 25 km by road, 
northwest of the city of Amos. Amos has a population of 12,584 (2006 Census) and is the seat 
of the Abitibi County Regional Municipality (Figure 4.1 overleaf).  

RNC advises that the Dumont property consists of 233 contiguous mineral claims totalling 9,306 
hectares (ha). The longitude and latitude for the Dumont property are 48°38'53" N, 78°26'30"W 
(UTM coordinates are 5,391,500N, 688,400E within UTM zone 17 using the NAD83 Datum). As 
shown in Figure 4.1, the property is located approximately 25 km west of the city of Amos, 
60 km northeast of the industrial and mining city of Rouyn-Noranda, 70 km northwest of the city 
of Val d'Or. The mineral resource is located mainly in Ranges V, VI and VII on Lots 46 to 62 of 
Launay Township, and in Range V on Lots 1 to 3 of Trécesson Township. 

4.2 Mineral Tenure 

4.2.1 Mineral Claims 

RNC advises the mineral properties comprising the Dumont property are all mineral claims. 
RNC holds 100% beneficial interest in five claims; the beneficial interest in the remaining 228 
claims is held 98% by RNC and 2% by Ressources Québec to secure the Ressources Québec 
royalty. Identifying numbers, as well as ownership details for each claim, are given in Table 4-1 
and claim locations with respect to the Dumont deposit are shown in Figure 4.2. 

4.2.2 Mineral Claims Conversion 

On February 18, 2013, as part of the ongoing program of claim standardization being carried out 
by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources, the ground-staked (CL) claims that were part of 
the Dumont property were converted to map-staked (CDC) claims that conform to the 30-
second by 30-second map-staking fabric.  

The area corresponding to these CL has been converted to new claims as shown in Figure 4.2 
above. Consequently, the royalty boundaries shown in Figure 4.2 no longer necessarily 
correspond to current claim boundaries.

4.2.3 Underlying Agreements 

The Dumont mineral claims are subject to various royalty agreements arising from terms of the 
property acquisitions by RNC or through the sale of royalties. The details of the underlying 
mineral claim agreements are described below and the extent and location of the property 
subject to the agreements are shown in Figure 4.2. 

4.2.3.1 Marbaw Royalty  

The Marbaw International Nickel Corporation (Marbaw) property comprises an area totalling 
2,639.0 ha as shown in Figure 4.2. This area originally consisted of 65 claims. Thirty-four of 
these claims were ground-staked claims that were converted to map-staked claims by the MRN 
in 2013.  

This property was originally held by Marbaw, but a 100% interest in the claims was sold and 
transferred to RNC for future consideration under an agreement dated 8 March 2007. 

Future consideration consisted of the following:  (1) issuance of 7 million shares in RNC to 
Marbaw upon the property being placed into commercial production or upon transfer of the 
property to a third party; (2) payment of $1.25 M to Marbaw on 8 March 2008. This amount has 
been paid by RNC. 

RNC also committed to incurring a minimum expenditure of $8,000,000 on the property prior to 
ceasing operations. This commitment was met in 2008. The Marbaw property is subject to a 3% 
NSR royalty payable to Marbaw. RNC has the right to buy back half of the 3% NSR for $10 M at 
any time. 

This property is subject to the Ressources Québec royalty and Red Kite royalty. 

4.2.3.2 Coyle-Roby Royalty  

The Sheridan-Ferderber property comprises an area of 256.47 ha corresponding to six historical 
contiguous ground-staked claims (Figure 4.2). The claims corresponding to the Sheridan-
Ferderber property were converted to map staked claims in 2013.  

The property was originally held 50% by Terrence Coyle and 50% by Michel Roby, but they 
were optioned to Patrick Sheridan and Peter Ferderber under an agreement dated 26 October 
2006. The option agreement was subsequently assigned to RNC through an agreement dated 4 
May 2007.  

RNC's option to acquire 100% interest in this property was exercised by the completion of 
$75,000 in work on the property before 26 October 2008 and by paying $10,000 to Coyle-Roby 
by 26 October 2007 and $30,000 to Coyle-Roby by 26 October 2008. The claims were 
transferred 100% to RNC on 25 August 2008. 

The property is subject to a 2% NSR royalty payable to Terrence Coyle (1%) and Michel Roby 
(1%). RNC has the right to buy back half of this 2% NSR for $1 M at any time. An advance 
royalty of $5,000 per year is also payable to Coyle-Roby beginning in 2011. Scheduled royalty 
payments were made in October 2011 and October 2012.These claims are subject to the 
Ressources Québec royalty and Red Kite royalty.

4.2.3.3 Frigon-Robert Royalty  

The Frigon-Robert property comprises two contiguous claims totalling 83.84 ha. The claims 
were originally held 50% by Jacques Frigon and 50% by Gérard Robert. They were transferred 
to RNC through a purchase agreement dated 1 November 2010. 

The property is subject to a 2% NSR royalty payable to Jacques Frigon (1%) and Gérard Robert 
(1%). RNC has the right to buy back half of this 2% NSR for $1 M at any time.  

These claims are subject to the Ressources Québec royalty and Red Kite royalty. 

4.2.3.4 Pershimco Claims (Pershimco Royalty) 

The Pershimco mineral claim block comprises five claims totalling 195.64 ha. The claims were 
originally held 100% by Pershimco Resources. They were transferred to RNC through a 
purchase agreement dated 18 March 2013 for $30,000. These claims are subject to a 3% NSR 
royalty payable to Pershimco Resources. RNC has the option to buy back the NSR in stages at 
any time by paying $1,000,000 for the first percent, $3,000,000 for the second percent and 
$6,000,000 for the third percent. As these claims were acquired after the Ressources Québec 
agreement, they are not subject to the Ressources Québec royalty. 

These claims are subject to the Red Kite royalty. 

4.2.3.5 Ressources Québec Royalty 

On 1 August 2012, RNC entered into an investment agreement with Ressources Québec. 
Pursuant to the agreement, RNC received $12 million and Ressources Québec became entitled 
to receive 0.8% of the net smelter return from the sale of minerals produced from Dumont and 
acquired a 2% undivided co-ownership interest in the property. RNC has the right to 
repurchase, at any time after the fifth anniversary, all or any portion of Ressources Québec's 
interest for $10 million for each 0.2% of the net smelter return, to a maximum consideration of 
$40 million for the entire interest (including the 2% interest in the property). The Ressources 
Québec royalty applies to all Dumont claims except the five Pershimco claims that were 
acquired after the Ressources Québec agreement. 

4.2.3.6 Red Kite Royalty 

On 9 May 2013, RNC entered into an investment agreement with RK Mine Finance (Master) 
Fund II LP ("Red Kite"). Under the terms of the agreement, Red Kite acquired a 1% net smelter 
return royalty in the Dumont project for a purchase price of US$15 million. The Red Kite royalty 
applies to all Dumont claims listed in Table 4-1.  

4.3 Exploration Permits & Authorizations 
Exploration work on public land (Crown land) is conducted under a forestry operational permit 
granted by the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife (MNRF) and renewed 
periodically. Exploration work on agricultural zoned lands is conducted under a permit granted 
by the Quebec Agricultural Land Commission (CPTAQ). Exploration work on private surface 
rights not owned by RNC is conducted under the terms of access agreements between RNC 
and individual landowners. Stream crossings have been constructed under permits issued 
variously or jointly by the MNRF, CPTAQ, and the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable 
Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP). RNC advises there are no known formal 
native land claims on the territory of the Dumont property within the St. Lawrence drainage 
basin. Algonquin First Nations; however, assert aboriginal rights over parts of western Quebec 
and eastern Ontario. Consultation with First Nations is a responsibility of the federal and

provincial governments. Nonetheless, RNC has initiated discussions with the local Algonquin 
Conseil de la Première nation Abitibiwinni and on 5 April 2013 entered into a memorandum of 
understanding for cooperation regarding the development of the Dumont Nickel project. 

4.4 Mineral Rights in Quebec 
RNC advises that under Quebec Mining Law, the holder of a claim has the exclusive right to 
explore for mineral substances (other than petroleum, natural gas and brine, sand, gravel and 
other surfaces substances) on the parcel of land subject to the claim. A claim has a term of two 
years. It may be renewed for additional periods of two years by completing minimum exploration 
work requirements and paying renewal fees. The holder of one or more claims may obtain a 
mining lease for the parcels of land subject to such claims, provided the holder can prove the 
existence of a workable deposit on the property.  

The mineral claims confer subsurface mineral rights only. Surface rights tenure is shown in 
Figure 4.3 on the following page. Approximately 40% of the surface rights for the property are 
held privately by a number of owners, resident both in the area and outside the region. RNC has 
purchased or acquired options to purchase approximately 680 ha of private surface rights 
overlying the Dumont resource as shown in Figure 4.3. The remainder of the surface rights are 
public land (Crown land).  

Figure 4.3 (overleaf) also shows the extent of the lands that are classified as an agricultural 
zone, where agricultural land and agricultural activities are to be respected and preserved. 
Mining activity on these lands would require authorization for non-agricultural use or exclusion 
of these lands from the agricultural zone by the Quebec Agricultural Land Commission 
(CPTAQ). This must be requested by the local municipality. The application for exclusion must 
demonstrate that there are no suitable non-agricultural lands available for the stated purpose in 
the municipality. RNC does not expect that exclusion of these lands to develop the Dumont 
project would be unreasonably withheld. The application exclusion for has been filed and was 
received by the CPTAQ on 20 February 2013. 

Use of surface rights for mining and associated activities under the terms of a mining lease is 
subject to environmental permitting. Access to surface rights for private lands would be obtained 
by negotiating purchase from private surface rights holders. Access to surface rights for public 
lands would be obtained through the mining lease and surface lease processes. Prior to 
commencing any mining, the operator of a mine or mill on the land subject to a lease must 
submit a rehabilitation and restoration plan for the site and deposit a financial guarantee. No 
compensation may be claimed by the holder of a mining claim from the holder of a mining lease 
for the depositing of tailings on the parcel of land that is subject to the claim. 

4.5 Environmental Liabilities 
Neither Ausenco nor RNC is aware of any outstanding environmental liabilities attached to the 
Dumont property and is unable to comment on any remediation that may have been undertaken 
by previous companies.  

Additional detail on environmental matters is provided in Section 20.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE & 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 
The Dumont property is located in the province of Quebec; approximately 25 km northwest of 
the city of Amos (see Figure 5.1). 

Figure 5.1:  Location & Infrastructure 

 
Source:  RNC. 

5.2 Local Resources & Infrastructure 
The principal economic activities in the region are agriculture and forestry. The sustainable 
nature of these industries has contributed to a stable population. As a result, Amos is well 
serviced by a large number of businesses and industrial suppliers. The Dumont Nickel project 
would require construction of additional accommodation in town, but the municipal economy is 
sufficiently evolved and diversified that responsibility for the investment in, and construction of, 
additional accommodation would likely be provided by third parties. The existing infrastructure in 
town is likely adequate to support the expanded population.

Amos has a municipal airport but is not serviced by regularly scheduled commercial flights. The 
nearest cities with airports serviced by regularly scheduled flights are Rouyn-Noranda (2011 
Census population 41,012), which is 120 km by road to the southwest, and Val d'Or (2011 
Census population 31,862), which is 90 km by road to the southeast. Both Rouyn-Noranda and 
Val d'Or have traditionally been centres for the mining industry, and there is a large base of 
skilled mining personnel resident within the region. 

The project site is well serviced with respect to other infrastructure, including: 

• Road – Provincial Highway 111 runs along the southern boundary of the property.  

• Rail – The Canadian National Railway (CNR) runs through the property, slightly to the north 
of Highway 111 but south of the engineered pit.  

• Power – The provincial utility, Hydro-Quebec, has indicated that it would be feasible to extend 
the powerline to site from the high voltage line that runs 5 km south of Highway 111 and that 
power from the grid would be made available to the project. 

• Water – The project concept includes a closed system for water, with water that would be 
reclaimed from tailings being reused in the process plant. Make-up water would be taken 
from the southeast reservoir and, if required under exceptional circumstances, from the 
Villemontel River, at a point located approximately 5 km from the planned site for the mill. 

• Natural Gas – Although the use of natural gas is not considered in this study, an existing 
pipeline extends to within approximately 25 km to the south of the property.  

5.3 Climate 
The climate at the Dumont property is continental with mean temperatures ranging from -17.3°C 
in January to +17.2°C in July, with an annual mean temperature of 1.2°C. Total average annual 
precipitation is 918 mm. While field exploration work can be conducted year-round, drill access 
in low-lying boggy areas is best during the frozen winter months. Also, periodic heavy rainfall or 
snowfall can hamper exploration at times during the summer or winter months. The climate at 
Dumont would be suitable to year-round open-pit mining operations. The climate setting is 
analogous to that of the former Dome Mine open-pit near Timmins, Ontario or Osisko's 
Canadian Malartic open-pit mine 60 km to the south of Dumont. 

5.4 Physiography 
The property exhibits low to moderate relief up to a maximum of 40 m and lies between 310 and 
350 m above sea level (Figure 5.2). The Arctic-Atlantic continental drainage divide runs along 
the northern boundary of the property as shown in Figure 5.3. Water for the diamond drilling 
programs is obtained from several creeks which run through the property and is generally 
pumped to the drill sites. However, fresh water can also be supplied by the nearby Villemontel 
River. Wildlife on the property consists of moose, black bear, beaver, rabbit and deer. Some 
logging has been conducted on the property with the wood being used primarily for pulp.

5.5 Surface Rights 
Surface rights tenure is shown in Section 4 in Figure 4.3. Approximately 40% of the surface 
rights for the property are held privately by a number of owners, resident both in the area and 
outside the region. Of these privately held surface rights approximately 1,409 hectares are 
required for the development of the Dumont project. To date, RNC has purchased or acquired 
options to purchase approximately 1,200 ha or 85% of the private surface rights required for the 
development of the Dumont project as shown in Figure 4.3, and negotiations are in progress to 
purchase the remaining private surface rights. The remainder of the surface rights are public 
land (Crown land). ` 

Figure 4.3 shows the extent of the lands that are classified as an agricultural zone within the 
meaning of the Act respecting the preservation of agricultural land and agricultural activities. 
Mining activity on these lands would require authorization for non-agricultural use or exclusion 
of these lands from the agricultural zone by the Quebec Agricultural Land Commission 
(CPTAQ). This exclusion must be requested by the local municipality. The application for 
exclusion must demonstrate that there are no suitable non-agricultural lands available for the 
stated purpose in the municipality. RNC does not expect that exclusion for the purpose of 
developing the Dumont project would be unreasonably withheld. The application for exclusion 
has been filed and was received by the CPTAQ on 20 February 2013. 

Use of surface rights for mining and associated activities under the terms of a mining lease is 
subject to environmental permitting. Access to surface rights for private lands not yet secured by 
RNC would be obtained by negotiating purchase thereof from private surface rights holders. 
Access to surface rights for public lands would be obtained through the mining lease and 
surface lease processes. No compensation may be claimed by the holder of a mining claim from 
the holder of a mining lease for the depositing of tailings on the parcel of land that is subject to 
the claim.

6 HISTORY 

6.1 Exploration & Development Work 
While the presence of ultramafic and mafic rocks has been known on the Dumont property since 
1935, the presence of nickel within the rock sequence was only discovered in 1956. It was not 
until the 1970s that the existence and potential of the large low-grade nickel mineralization was 
first recognized.  

The major exploration phases for the Dumont property are discussed below with the exploration 
and associated work listed in point form by year. 

6.1.1 Phase 1:  1935 to 1969 

The exploration programs and geological surveys during this period led to the discovery of the 
Dumont ultramafic sill and associated nickel mineralization. 

In 1935, the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) conducted a mapping survey over Launay and 
Trécesson Townships that identified the presence of ultramafic and mafic rocks. 

In 1950, Quebec Asbestos Corporation (Quebec Asbestos) conducted a magnetometer survey 
over the upper contact of the sill and drilled five diamond drill holes totalling 475 m. 

In 1951, an aeromagnetic survey conducted by the GSC outlined the ultramafic sill. 

In 1956, Barry Exploration Ltd. (Barry Exploration) conducted a magnetometer survey over the 
group of claims previously explored by Quebec Asbestos and drilled a further six diamond drill 
holes. These drill holes resulted in the first reporting of the presence of nickel mineralization. 

6.1.2 Phase 2:  1969 to 1982 

The exploration programs and related geological and engineering studies during this period 
resulted in the identification of three zones of nickel mineralization. 

In 1969, drill holes DT-1 and DT-2, totalling 182 m, were drilled over a group of mineral claims 
acquired in 1962 by Georges H. Dumont, P. Eng. 

In 1970, drill holes DT-3 and DT-4, totalling 364 m, were drilled on an enlarged group of claims 
with nickel mineralization intersected in each drill hole (DT-3:  0.47% Ni over 2.7 m). Additional 
mineral claims were acquired to form what was then known as the Dumont property covering 
the whole of the Dumont ultramafic sill. 

In 1970-1971, an enlarged exploration campaign was carried out on the Dumont property that 
consisted of prospecting, trenching, magnetometer survey and the drilling of an additional 57 
diamond drill holes, totalling 21,052 m. The drilling program discovered three zones of nickel 
mineralization that were nearly adjacent and parallel within the dunite subzone. The central part 
of the middle zone, having higher nickel content, was identified as the Main Zone or Main 
deposit. A portion of the Main Zone is also referred to as the No. 1 deposit where it is defined as 
the middle mineralized band located between sections 35+00W and 49+00W and located 
between surface and the 1,500 ft (457.18 m) level (Dumont, 1970/1971a,b; Dumont, 
1971/1972).

In 1971, Newmont Exploration Ltd. (Newmont) conducted metallurgical testwork (heavy media 
and magnetic separation only) and a mineralogical study on the mineralization (Hausen, 1971). 
Also in that year, Canada Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, Ottawa, conducted a 
"Mineralogical Investigation of the Low-Grade Nickel-Bearing Serpentinite of Dumont Nickel 
Corporation, Val d'Or, Quebec," a study that involved XRD and electron microprobe analysis of 
the nickel-bearing phases (Harris, 1972). 

In 1971-1972, the Centre de Recherches Minérales (CRM) carried out a laboratory testwork 
program on drill core composite samples from the Main Zone, including locked-cycle tests to 
develop the flowsheet for the concentration process. Pilot plant tests were also conducted on a 
bulk sample, blasted out of an outcrop located to the east of the Main Zone. 

In 1971-1972, the engineering firm Caron, Dufour, Séguin & Associates (CDS) completed an 
ore reserve estimation and feasibility study on the project with the objective of bringing the Main 
deposit into production, to a depth of 455 m below surface using underground mining methods. 
The mineral resources of the Main deposit were estimated at 15,517,662 tonnes grading 
0.646% nickel after dilution. Based on the results of the feasibility study, CDS recommended 
that the Main deposit be brought into production (Caron, 1972; Honsberger, 1971a,b). 

In 1974-1975, in association with Dumont Nickel Corporation (Dumont Nickel), Timiskaming 
Nickel Ltd. (Timiskaming) paid for bench and pilot plant tests to be conducted at the University 
of Minnesota to evaluate the amenability of the low-grade resources to a patented process. 
Timiskaming and Boliden AB, which evaluated the testwork results, concluded positively that the 
project had economic potential for a 13,600 t/d open pit mining operation on the estimated 
320 Mt of resources at 0.34% nickel, from which the patented segregation process would 
recover 75% of the nickel. 

In 1974, Canex Placer (Canex) had bench tests conducted at Britton Research Centre Ltd. 
(Britton Research), where a combined flotation-hydrometallurgical process was developed to 
recover 80% of the nickel contained in the Main Zone. The testwork indicated that this process 
would also result in the production of magnesia (MgO). 

After 1974, with lower nickel prices in the world market, there was reduced interest in 
developing the property due to the low-grade nature of the deposit. 

6.1.3 Phase 3:  1982 to 1992 

In 1982, exploration resumed on the property and four percussion 15.2 cm (6") diameter holes 
were drilled and cuttings recovered to prepare a bulk sample. 

In 1986, CRM conducted, for the account of Magnitec, a H2S03 leaching test on samples of 
"rejects from the Dumont mine" to evaluate the possibility of scrubbing the Noranda smelter 
SO2-bearing gas with the tailings from an eventual mining operation on the property (Delisle, 
1992). The test solubilized 66% of the MgO and 72.4% of the nickel contained in the samples. 
Magnitec also tested two core samples for their platinum group element (PGE) content but none 
was detected. 

In 1986, La Société Nationale de l'Amiante (SNA) reviewed the results of the CRM H2S03 leach 
test and indicated that the tailings from an operation on the Dumont property would give a low 
extraction rate of the SO2 contained in the Noranda smelter emission gas. 

In 1986, J. M. Duke, a geologist from the GSC, studied the mineralization and petrogenesis of 
the Dumont sill. Figure 6.1 is the geology map for the Dumont sill as outlined by Duke.

From his understanding of the sill petrogenesis, Duke concluded that it was possible to discover 
sulphide enrichment zones at the basal contact of the intrusion and recommended that drilling 
should be conducted to explore this contact. In his 1986 report, Duke estimated the potential 
resources for the Dumont property at 175 Mt grading 0.47% nickel over the three nickel 
enriched layers. 

In 1986 and 1987, Dumont Nickel carried out a geological mapping survey along the basal 
contact of the sill and drilled 11 holes in mineral claims located in Trécesson Township. 
Sulphide mineralization was recognized at the basal contact and a relatively high-grade nickel 
sulphide accumulation was intersected by four holes that also returned significant PGE values. 
Three holes drilled in the central part of the Dumont property were stopped short due to poor 
ground conditions in a faulted area (Daxl, 1988). 

In 1988 and 1990, Beep Mat (electromagnetic) and induced polarization surveys were carried 
out for Dumont Nickel and various anomalies were reported.

In 1992, CRM conducted dry grinding and air aspiration tests to separate the fibrous texture 
minerals, for the account of Timmins Nickel Inc. (Timmins Nickel). 

After 1992 exploration interest in the Dumont property waned and no work was conducted on 
the property for a number of years. 

6.1.4 Phase 4:  1999 to 2006 

Since 1999, the following exploration work has been conducted on the Dumont property on 
behalf of Frank Marzoli. 

In 1999, diamond drill hole FM-99-01 was drilled on the southwest of the Main deposit. This 
318 m drill hole intersected the basal sill contact but no significant mineralization was 
encountered. 

In 2001, geological and prospecting work was carried out together with the establishment of a 
network of cut grid lines totalling 96 km. 

In 2002, a 150 m long diamond drill hole (DNN-2002-01) was drilled in the northwest portion of 
the property; however, no core samples were assayed from this hole (Derosier, 2002). 

In 2003, a 125 m long diamond drill hole (DNS-03-01) was positioned on section line 36+00 W. 
This drill hole was successful in intersecting the upper part of the Main deposit and returned a 
19.2 m drill core intersection grading 0.56% nickel. 

In 2004, diamond drill hole DNN-01-04 was drilled to a length of 125 m in the northwestern 
portion of the property with no significant results obtained from the eight 2.5 m long core 
intersections that were assayed (Berthelot and Cloutier, 2004). 

In 2004, J.C. Caron, P.Eng, former principal of CDS and then with Les Consultants PROTEC, 
prepared a valuation report on the property in accordance with CIM valuation standards and 
guidelines. 

There was no exploration activity from 2005 to 2006. 

6.1.5 Phase 5:  2007 to present (RNC) 

RNC acquired the property in 2007 and initiated field exploration work in March 2007. 
Exploration work completed by RNC since 2007 is described in Section 9. Metallurgical and 
process development work completed by RNC since 2007 is described in Section 13. Resource 
estimations are described in Section 14. 

Recent development studies completed by RNC are summarized below. These studies are 
superseded by the current study presented in Sections 15 to 22 of this report. 

6.1.5.1 RNC Conceptual Study 

After Dumont was acquired by RNC, a conceptual study was completed by Aker Solutions in 
October 2007 and updated in August 2008. The initial report was based on historical resource 
estimates, which pre-dated the requirements of NI 43-101. These estimates were supported by 
five new twinned holes, which demonstrated that the historical assays (on which the earlier 
resource estimates were based) were comparable to results obtained from the twin holes. The 
independent resource consultants (Micon) considered the historical estimates to be relevant for 
the purposes of the study (Lewis, 2007).

An updated conceptual study was completed based on a revised NI 43-101 compliant resource 
estimate prepared by Micon in April 2008 (Lewis, 2008), which incorporated 38 holes of new 
drilling as well as historical drilling (see Table 6-1). The resource model used a block size of 
10 m (X) x 25 m (Y) x 10 m (Z) and an inverse distance interpolation. The bulk of material 
included in the conceptual study mine plan was classified as inferred resources.

The conceptual study considered two scopes of open pit design: 

• a smaller pit (50 kt/d concentrator) that would extract 452 Mt grading 0.32% Ni. The ultimate 
pit would be 350 m deep with a stripping ratio of 1.6:1 

• a larger pit (75 kt/d concentrator). With the economies of scale from the higher milling rate, 
the economic pit shell would contain 571 Mt grading 0.32% Ni. The pit would extend to a 
depth of 470 m and have a stripping ratio of 1.8:1. 

Both concepts used a cut-off grade of approximately 0.25% Ni.  

In the absence of comprehensive results from metallurgical testwork, the study assumed that 
the concentrator would achieve a constant recovery of 65%, while sensitivity analysis tested the 
impact of recovery ranging from 55% to 70%.  

The conceptual study concluded that the 75 kt/d option generated more attractive economics 
and that the project was potentially robust.  

6.1.5.2 RNC Preliminary Assessment 

Following the positive results of the conceptual study, a Preliminary Assessment was completed 
in September 2010 entitled, "A Preliminary Assessment of the Dumont property, Launay and 
Trécesson Townships, Quebec, Canada" (September 2010) (Lewis et al, 2010). The study was 
managed by RNC, with key external contributors including Golder (resource model), GENIVAR 
(geotechnical design), BBA (process design) and PasteTec (tailings management). The mine 
design and process flowsheet were developed in house by RNC, assisted by external 
consultants. Key changes in the scope of design compared to the scoping study included: 

• The quantity of new drilling used to support the resource model was increased by a factor of 
more than six to 254 holes (totaling 96,701 m). This allowed material to be updated to 
measured and indicated resources. No inferred resources were included in the scoping study 
mine plan; this was considered to be waste in the production schedule.  

• Whereas the conceptual study resource model included only Ni grade, the scoping study 
resource model included an interpolation of the three main economic minerals (pentlandite, 
heazlewoodite and awaruite) along with non-recoverable Ni silicate minerals. This allowed a 
more granular estimate of recovery, as discussed in a subsequent bullet. The resource model 
block size was also increased to 20 m (X) x 20 m (Y) x 15 m (Z) to reflect the smallest mining

unit (SMU) for the scale of load and haul equipment that would be used. Use of a larger SMU 
resulted in a smoother grade estimate and eliminated some of the high-grade zones that the 
conceptual study assumed could be mined selectively. 

• Recovery of Ni to concentrate was estimated uniquely for each block in the resource model, 
based on the interpolated mineralogy. These estimates were supported by variability testing 
of 32 bench scale samples representing the different types of mineralization that would be 
encountered. Metallurgical tests focused on the rougher flotation circuit and estimates of 
losses during cleaning were based on benchmarks. 

• The mining rate for ore was accelerated relative to the requirements of the process plant, 
leading to the creation of a low-grade stockpile. This stockpile would be treated at the end of 
mine life after depletion of the open pit. The depleted pit would be used as an impoundment 
for tailings, reducing the size of the tailings dam by approximately 30%. 

• Unlike the conventional SAG mill – ball mill – pebble crusher (SABC) comminution circuit 
used in the conceptual study, the scoping study assumed a four-stage crushing comminution 
circuit, based on the process employed in the chrysotile industry. While this flowsheet would 
be more energy efficient than the SABC circuit, the individual components are considerably 
smaller and therefore more numerous, which would possibly lead to operational inefficiencies. 
Additionally, the crushing circuit would require approximately 30% of feed to be dried – at 
considerable expense and with a potential negative impact on recovery (drying would 
promote oxidation of sulphide mineralization). Due to these negative impacts, the pre-
feasibility study reverted to a conventional SAG mill – ball mill circuit. 

This study found that the project is robust (after-tax IRR >> 10%) and that returns will increase 
non-linearly as the scale of project increases (the 25% increase in mill throughput from 80 to 
100 kt/d would result in a 42% increase in after-tax NPV10%). However, the forecast capital 
(US$2.0 billion for 80 kt/d, increasing to US$2.3 billion for 100 kt/d) was significant, and 
reflected the complexity of the scoping study flowsheet, as well as the decision to start the 
project at the full nameplate production rate. The study noted that the key area of risk was 
forecast deportment of Ni to recoverable minerals and associated estimates of recovery. These 
items (capital estimate, concentrator flowsheet and recovery estimates) were a key focus of 
work during the pre-feasibility study.  

6.1.5.3 RNC Pre-feasibility Study 

Following the positive results of the Preliminary Assessment, Ausenco Solutions Canada Inc. 
(Ausenco) was commissioned by RNC to complete the pre-feasibility study and the NI 43-101 
compliant Technical Report on the project entitled, "Technical Report on the Dumont project, 
Launay and Trécesson Townships, Quebec, Canada" (16 December 2011) (Ausenco, 2011). 
SRK Consulting Inc. (SRK) was engaged to prepare the geology, resource estimate, 
hydrogeology, hydrology and geotechnical inputs and David Penswick, a private mining 
consultant, was retained for mine design, mine operating costs, mine capital costing and 
economic modelling. GENIVAR was engaged to provide inputs to the environmental and 
permitting aspects of the project. Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) contributed to the 
environmental geochemistry investigations.  

Key changes in the scope of design compared to the Preliminary Assessment included: 

• The quantity of new drilling used to support the resource model was increased by an 
additional 65 holes (totaling 43,261 m). This allowed material to be updated to measured and 
indicated resources. In addition to nickel, cobalt was reported in the resource estimate. 

• The mineralogical database for the deposit was expanded by adding 505 new EXPLOMINTM 
QEMSCAN mineralogical samples that were taken throughout the deposit to bring the 



 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

6-7 

  

number of mineralogical samples from 189 to 694. This expanded database allowed 
refinement of the mineralogical model and geometallurgical domaining. 

• In contrast to the PEA production plan that processed 100,000 kt/d from the beginning of 
production, the PFS mine, process plant and associated infrastructure were designed to 
initially process 50 kt/d of ore, with expansion to 100 kt/d in Year 5.  

• Site operating costs were reduced by 24% and initial capital outlay was reduced by more than 
50% to US$1.1 billion from the 100 kt/d scenario in the PEA. Expansion to 100 kt/d in Year 5 
would require US$0.7 billion of additional capital. 

• The processing plant would produce a single high-grade concentrate containing an average 
of 33% nickel over life of project instead of the separate sulphide and alloy concentrate in the 
PEA. 

• Recovery of Ni to concentrate was estimated uniquely for each block in the resource model, 
based on geometallurgical domaining. In the 2010 Preliminary Assessment, the rougher 
recovery equations were defined from 32 samples from five drill holes that were available at 
the time of the evaluation. The samples were grouped by mineralization type (sulphide, alloy 
and mixed) and structural domain. For the PFS, an additional 38 samples, for a total of 70, 
were added to the STP suite to update the recovery equations. A review of the expanded 
mineralogical database for the deposit showed that there were distinct populations of 
samples, either Pn-rich or Hz-rich with a very small amount that fell in a mixed category 
between the two extremes. Accordingly, the 70 samples were split into three subgroups:  Hz-
rich (Hz/Pn > 5), Pn-rich (Hz/Pn < 1) and the mixed sulphide (1<Hz/Pn>5), and recovery 
equations were developed based on regressions between STP recovery and concentration of 
select elements as determined by assays. It was decided that mineral abundances not be 
used as factors in the recovery equations for the PFS, as they had been in the Preliminary 
Assessment, due to the higher confidence in the deposit assay model compared with the 
deposit mineralogical model.  

• All metal price assumptions are the same as the figures used for the PEA with the exception 
of nickel price which was increased to $9.00 per pound. 

This study found that the project is robust yielding US$1.1 billion after-tax NPV8%, after-tax IRR 
of 17% and C1 cash costs of US$4.13 per pound of nickel. Average annual contained nickel 
production of 96 million pounds (44 kt) during the 19-year mine life and 59 million pounds (27 kt) 
for the subsequent 12 years from processing of the lower grade stockpile. Additional potential 
upsides including production of a final ferronickel product, production of iron ore (magnetite) 
concentrate byproduct, additional recovery optimization and use of in-pit crushing or trolley 
system were identified for further study in the PFS. 

6.1.5.4 RNC Revised Pre-feasibility Study 

Following the positive results of the pre-feasibility study, Ausenco was commissioned by RNC to 
produce a revised pre-feasibility study and NI 43-101 compliant technical report for the Dumont 
project. SRK was engaged to prepare the geology, resource estimate, hydrogeology, hydrology 
and geotechnical inputs, and David Penswick, a private mining consultant, was retained for 
mine design, mine operating costs, mine capital costing and economic modelling. GENIVAR 
was engaged to provide inputs to the environmental and permitting aspects of the project. 
Golder contributed to the environmental geochemistry investigations.  

Key changes in the scope of design compared to the pre-feasibility study included: 

• The quantity of new drilling used to support the resource model was increased by an 
additional 50,000 m. This allowed material to be updated to measured and indicated 



 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0

6-8 

  

resources. In addition to nickel, cobalt, platinum and palladium were reported in the resource 
estimate. 

• The mineralogical database for the deposit was expanded by adding 403 new EXPLOMINTM 
QEMSCAN mineralogical samples that were taken throughout the deposit to bring the 
number of mineralogical samples from 694 to 1,097. This expanded database allowed 
refinement of the mineralogical model and geometallurgical domaining. This allowed 
estimation of the magnetite content for a portion of the deposit. 

• Project recoveries were improved to 45% in the revised PFS from 41% in the PFS due to the 
combination of significant additional metallurgical testwork, a 50% increase in mineralogy 
samples and the revised resource model. Recoveries are 57% in Years 1 to 5 of the mine life; 
51% in Years 6 to 19; and 33% in Years 20 to 31. This improvement contributed an additional 
US$296 M to the project NPV8%. The revised metallurgical ore classification was further 
refined into five separate domains rather than the four used in the initial PFS. Cobalt recovery 
is estimated to be an average of 45% over the life of the project, a decrease from 70% in the 
PFS, as the deportment of cobalt between the recoverable minerals and silicates is similar to 
nickel. Platinum and palladium payable metals were not included in the revised PFS, as their 
ability to upgrade above a minimum payable level in concentrate is uncertain due to limited 
technical resource and recovery work on PGEs. 

• The average concentrate grade was reduced to 29% as additional mineralogy work revealed 
that the nickel content of the pentlandite in certain areas of the orebody contained 27% nickel 
rather than the 33% nickel found throughout the majority of the orebody. 

• A mining scenario including the use of trolley assist to improve overall mining costs for the 
project by using electricity to replace a portion of the diesel fuel consumed by trucks was 
evaluated. The implementation of trolley assist during expansion in Year 5 and other 
improvements reduced mining costs by US$0.14 per tonne mined (US$0.32 per tonne ore) 
and reduced estimated diesel consumption by 28% to 872 ML over the life of the project. 

• All metal price assumptions are the same as the figures used for the pre-feasibility study. 

The revised PFS (base case plus trolley assist option) yielded an increase of project after-tax 
NPV8% of 31% from US$1.1 billion to US$1.4 billion with an after-tax IRR of 19.5% and net C1 
cash costs of US$4.07 per pound of nickel. Average annual contained nickel production of 
108 Mlbs (49 kt) during the 19-year mine life and 63 Mlbs (29 kt) for the subsequent 12 years 
from processing of the lower grade stockpile. Additional potential upsides including production 
of a final ferronickel product, production of iron ore (magnetite) concentrate byproduct, 
additional recovery optimization and optimization of the trolley system configuration were 
identified for further study in the feasibility study. 

6.2 Historical & Mining Production  
No historical mining or production has been conducted on the Dumont property. However, the 
Val d'Or-Rouyn-Noranda region surrounding the Dumont property has been a prolific mining 
area for the past 100 years. 

6.3 Dumont Property Resource & Reserve Estimates 
The discussions related to the resource and reserve estimates contained in this section refer to 
historical estimates and subsequent RNC resource estimates. The historical estimates may 
have been prepared according to the accepted standards for the mining industry for the period 
to which they refer; however, they do not comply with the current CIM standards and definitions 
for estimating resources and reserves as required by NI 43-101 guidelines. A qualified person 
has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimates as a current resource estimate 
and the issuer is not treating the historical estimates as a current resource estimate. As a result, 



 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

6-9 

  

historical estimates should not be relied upon unless they have been validated and restated to 
comply with the latest CIM standards and definitions. 

6.3.1 1971 to 1986 Resource Estimation 

A summation report (Honsberger, 1971) stated the potential resources for the deposit and the 
reserves for the No. 1 deposit using a 0.50% nickel cut-off grade. This estimate was part of the 
earlier CDS feasibility study for an underground mine that was planned to produce 4,500 tons 
per day. The potential of the Dumont property was determined from drilling results obtained 
between sections 36+00W and 84+00W where higher grade bands were intersected on drill 
sections 800 ft apart and mineralized intersections grading 0.5% nickel or higher were obtained. 

Using these intersections and those for the No. 1 orebody, both Honsberger and Caron reported 
that the estimated potential of the higher grade bands was 70 Mt of material grading 0.5% nickel 
and higher, down to a depth of 2,000 ft. 

The estimation of the reserves for the 1971/1972 feasibility study was completed using the 
sectional estimation method where the drill holes were plotted on sectional views; the area of 
influence of each drill hole intersection was measured on the section; and the necessary 
corrections were made for the dip and strike of the deposit to measure the area in the plane 
perpendicular to the strike of the zone. The volume of influence of the drill core intersection was 
obtained by multiplying its area of influence by half the distance measured along strike between 
two adjacent sections. A volume factor of 12 ft2/ton was used to convert the volumes of 
influence into tonnages. The tonnage of the reserves was estimated by adding the tonnages 
from all the holes while the grade was determined by using the weighted average of the grades 
for each tonnage block. In depth, the tonnage was estimated from elevation 250 to 1,500 ft. 

To account for dilution, an underground mining scenario was selected for the August 1971 
report. It was determined that 6% was appropriate due to the competence of the rock and the 
continuity of the mineralization. The average nickel content of the mineralization located within 
the hanging wall and within 5 ft of the zone was estimated at 0.45% nickel. Since most of the 
dilution was expected to come from the hanging wall, this grade was determined to be the grade 
of the diluting material.  

The tonnage and grade of the reserves above the 900 level were estimated separately using the 
same method. After dilution, the tonnage was 6,906,609 at an average grade of 0.660% nickel. 

There is mention of a second historical resource or reserve estimate that was conducted by 
Timiskaming in 1974-1975. Timiskaming and Boliden AB concluded positively that the project 
had economic potential for a 13,600 t/d open pit mining operation on the estimated 320 Mt of 
resources at 0.34% nickel, from which the patented segregation process would recover 75% of 
the nickel. The authors of this report were unable to obtain any data regarding this estimate and 
it has therefore been excluded from the current discussion. 

A third historical estimate (Duke, 1986) of the resource potential of the mineral deposit was 
conducted. Table 6-2 summarizes the resource potential in the 1986 estimate.

6.3.2 2008 Mineral Resource Estimation (RNC) 

The historical 1971 reserve estimate was superseded by RNC's 2008 preliminary mineral 
resource estimate, the details of which are contained in a Technical Report entitled "NI 43-101 
Technical Report, Preliminary Mineral Resource Estimate for the Dumont Property, Launay and 
Trécesson Townships, Quebec, Canada" (April 2008) (Lewis, 2008). 

The April 2008 preliminary resource estimate was based on the results of both the 2007 
exploration drilling and the historical drilling. The tonnages and grades for the April 2008 
indicated and inferred mineral resource estimates are summarized Table 6-3.

The April 2008 preliminary mineral resource estimate was compliant with the current CIM 
standards and definitions required by NI 43-101 regulations and was reportable as a mineral 
resource by RNC. 

The April 2008 preliminary Mineral Resource estimate was superseded by an updated mineral 
resource estimate effectively dated 31 October 2008. The details on this mineral resource 
estimate are contained in a Technical Report entitled, "NI 43-101 Technical Report, Updated 
Mineral Resource Estimate for the Dumont Property, Launay and Trécesson Townships, 
Quebec, Canada" (January 2009). 

The October 2008 resource estimate was based on the drilling conducted in 2007 and 2008 by 
RNC; use of the historical information was limited to the peripheral areas of the deposit or at 
depth where RNC had not conducted any drilling. The tonnages and grades for the October 
2008 indicated and inferred mineral resource estimates are summarized Table 6-4.

The mineral resource estimate as of 31 October 2008 was compliant with the current CIM 
standards and definitions required by NI 43-101 and was reportable as a mineral resource by 
RNC. 

6.3.3 2010 Mineral Resource Estimation (RNC) 

The 31 October 2008 Mineral Resource estimate contained in the January 2009 Technical 
Report was then superseded by an updated mineral resource contained in the 2010 Technical 
Report entitled "NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the Dumont 
Property, Launay and Trécesson Townships, Quebec, Canada" (April 2010)(Lewis, 2010). 

The resource estimate contained in the April 2010 Technical Report was based on the drilling 
conducted from 2007 to 2009 by RNC and on the geological structural information developed by 
Itasca Consulting. The introduction of the structural model resulted in the separation of the 
Dumont deposit into seven separate domains, rather than two. The seven solid models did not 
overlap each other in space. However, all solid models were contiguous and were constrained 
using a 0.2% nickel cut-off grade. Constructing the seven solids was a result of the available 
structural model and the confidence level in the data set. 

The overburden surface was constructed using the drill hole data. No lithological solid model 
was generated and used for the resource estimate since the mineralization is hosted primarily 
within the dunite unit. No historical drill holes were used for the mineral resource estimate 
contained in the April 2010 Technical Report. 

Along the strike direction, the resource model extends between sections 3600E and 10400E. 
Due to the differing strike directions of the seven domains, the total length is 7,035 m. The 
vertical boundaries are defined using the overburden and rock interface as the upper boundary, 
while the lower boundary is defined by using a variable projected distance of approximately

boundaries are projected in the down dip direction (average of -58°) as defined by the actual 
assays above the cut-off criterion. 

The effective date of the mineral resource estimate in the April 2010 Technical Report was 4 
December 2009. Table 6-5 summarizes this resource estimate.

The mineral resource estimate as of the effective date of 4 December 2009 was compliant with 
the current CIM standards and definitions required by NI 43-101 and was reportable as a 
mineral resource by RNC.  

The December 2009 Mineral Resource estimate contained in the April 2010 Technical Report 
was then superseded by an updated mineral resource contained in the Technical Report entitled 
"NI 43-101 Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate for the Dumont Property, Launay and 
Trécesson Townships, Quebec, Canada" (August 2010). 

The resource estimate contained in the August 2010 Technical Report was based on the drilling 
conducted from 2007 to 2010 by RNC and on the geological structural information developed by 
Itasca Consulting. Micon estimated the updated mineral resource based on the geological 
information and assaying data for the Dumont property available as of 22 April 2010. The 
effective date of the resource estimate was 16 August 2010. 

For the August 2010 Technical Report, it was possible to refine the estimated cut-off grade to 
0.20% nickel based on work from the concurrent September 2010 preliminary assessment.  

Recognizing that the amount of nickel in recoverable minerals is of paramount importance to 
mine planning and plant design, RNC retained Golder to prepare a resource block model that 
would incorporate nickel grade and major mineralogical abundances. The resource block model 
work was completed by Olivier Tavchandjian, P.Geo, and was reviewed by Greg Greenough, 
P.Geo, both of Golder (Warren, 2010; Golder Associates, 2010).  

The August 2010 resource block model interpolated nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium, platinum, 
palladium and gold grades, specific gravity, and ten factor scores used to calculate the mineral 
abundances of pentlandite, heazlewoodite, awaruite, olivine, magnetite, serpentine, brucite and 
coalingite. 

Golder and RNC conducted all of the 3D modelling work. Micon verified and audited the 
mineralization envelopes.  

RNC provided to Micon the 3D modelling work of the mineralization envelopes based on the 
geometallurgical model provided by Golder and a 0.2% nickel cut-off grade. Micon reviewed the 
block model extensively and in some cases the model was refined in discussions with RNC.  

The overburden surface was constructed using the drill hole data. No lithological solid model 
was generated, since the mineralization considered in the resource is hosted entirely within the 
dunite unit.

Based on all of the data currently available, seven separate solid models were generated. The 
seven solid models do not overlap each other in space, but all are contiguous and have been 
constrained using a 0.2% nickel cut-off grade. The seven solids were constructed on the basis 
of the available structural model and the confidence level in the data set. 

Along the strike direction, the current resource model extends between sections 3600E and 
10000E. Due to the differing strike directions of the seven domains, the total length is 7,035 m. 
The vertical boundaries are defined using the overburden and rock interface as the upper 
boundary, while the lower boundary is defined by using a variable projected distance of 
approximately 50 m below the deepest drilling assays above the cut-off grade. The hanging wall 
and footwall boundaries are projected in the down dip direction (average of -58°) as defined by 
the actual assays above the cut-off criterion. 

Micon reviewed and audited the updated mineral resource estimate for RNC which is CIM 
compliant. The tonnages and grades for the August 2010 mineral resource estimate are 
summarized Table 6-6. 

The mineral resource estimate as of the effective date of 16 August 2010 was compliant with 
the current CIM standards and definitions required by NI 43-101 and is reportable as a mineral 
resource by RNC.

6.3.4 2011 Mineral Resource Estimation & Mineral Reserve (RNC) 

The 2010 Mineral Resource Estimate contained in the August 2010 Technical Report was 
superseded by an updated mineral resource effective 13 December 2011 (Ausenco, 2011). 

The 13 December 2011 Mineral Resource Estimate for the Dumont project presented in 
Table 6-7 was prepared by Mr. Sébastien Bernier, P.Geo, at SRK. The mineral resource 
estimate considers drilling information available to 3 October 2011 and was evaluated using a 
geostatistical block modelling approach constrained by seven sulphide mineralization 
wireframes. The mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with the CIM "Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserves Estimation Best Practices" guidelines and were classified 
according to the CIM Standard Definition for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
(December 2005) guidelines.  

In addition to nickel and cobalt, SRK modelled the abundance distribution of seven other main 
elements:  arsenic, gold, calcium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, palladium, platinum and 
sulphur.

figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not 
have demonstrated economic viability. 

To facilitate RNC's ongoing evaluation of metallurgical recovery, SRK also constructed 
estimation models of mineral abundances. Specifically, SRK modelled the abundance 
distribution of pentlandite, heazlewoodite, awaruite, olivine, magnetite, serpentine, brucite, 
coalingite, and iron-rich serpentine. Although these mineral abundances do not directly impact 
the mineral resource at the Dumont project, they do affect the metallurgical recovery, which has 
a direct impact on the feasibility of this project. 

Reserves were estimated by David Penswick, P. Eng, an independent consultant, based on the 
mineral resource block model described above and the results of the pre-feasibility study. 
Reserves are based on a Lerchs-Grossmann optimized pit shell generated using only nickel 
values and a nickel price of US$6.70/lb, which is 74% of the long-term forecast of US$9.00/lb 
and include planned and unplanned dilution of 4.2% and 0.65%, respectively. The 13 December 
2011 Dumont mineral reserves are summarized in Table 6-8.

Since the December 13, 2011 mineral resource estimate and reserve was published, RNC has 
performed additional drilling and mineralogical sampling. Because of this work, RNC was able 
update its resource estimate. RNC's updated resource model as estimated by SRK is discussed 
in Section 14 of this Technical Report.

6.3.5 2012 Mineral Resource Estimation & Mineral Reserve (RNC) 

The 13 December 2011 Mineral Resource estimate contained in the December 2011 Technical 
Report was superseded by an updated mineral resource effective 13 April 2012 (Ausenco, 
2012). 

The 13 April 2012 Mineral Resource Estimate for the Dumont project presented in Table 6-9 
was prepared by Mr. Sébastien Bernier, P.Geo, at SRK. The mineral resource estimate 
considers drilling information available to 1 February 2012 and was evaluated using a 
geostatistical block modelling approach constrained by seven sulphide mineralization 
wireframes. The mineral resources have been estimated in conformity with the CIM "Mineral 
Resource and Mineral Reserves Estimation Best Practices" guidelines and were classified 
according to the CIM Standard Definition for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
(December 2005) guidelines.  

The Mineral Resource Statement included the first disclosure of palladium and platinum grade 
and magnetite concentration. 

In addition to nickel, palladium, platinum and cobalt, SRK modelled the abundance distribution 
of four other main elements:  calcium, chromium, iron and sulphur.  

To facilitate RNC's ongoing evaluation of metallurgical recovery, SRK constructed estimation 
models of mineral abundances. Specifically, SRK modelled the abundance distribution of 
awaruite, coalingite, heazlewoodite, serpentine, low-iron serpentine, iron-rich serpentine, 
magnetite, olivine, and pentlandite.  

Reserves were estimated by David Penswick, P. Eng, an independent consultant, based on the 
mineral resource block model described above. Reserves are based on a Lerchs-Grossmann 
optimized pit shell generated using only nickel values and a nickel price of US$6.70/lb, which is 
74% of the long-term forecast of US$9.00/lb and include planned and unplanned dilution of 
4.2% and 0.65%, respectively. 

The 14 May 2012 Dumont mineral reserves are summarized in Table 6-10. Since the 13 April 
2012 mineral resource estimate and 14 May 2012 reserve were published, RNC has performed 
additional drilling and mineralogical sampling. Because of this work, RNC was able to update its 
resource estimate. RNC's updated resource model, as estimated by SRK, is discussed in 
Section 14 of this technical report.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

7.1 Regional Geology 
A thick supracrustal succession of Archean volcanic and sedimentary rocks underlies about 
65% of the Abitibi belt, and there is evidence to suggest that these supracrustal rocks lie 
unconformably upon a basement complex of sialic composition. The volcanic rocks are mainly 
of mafic composition although ultramafic, intermediate and felsic types are also present. The 
abundance of pillowed and nonvesicular lavas, together with the flyschoid character of much of 
the sedimentary component, demonstrates the prevalence of deep submarine conditions. 
However, the occurrence of some fluvial sedimentary rocks and airfall tuffs attest to occasional 
local non-marine conditions. Numerous small to medium sized synvolcanic intrusions reflect the 
range of compositions of the lavas themselves. See Figure 7.1 for a map reflecting the location 
of the Dumont ultramafic sill within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. 

Figure 7.1:  Location of the Dumont Ultramafic Sill within the Abitibi Greenstone Belt 

 
Source:  Supplied by RNC after Duke (1986). 

The supracrustal rocks were deformed and intruded by granitic stocks and batholiths during the 
Kenoran event about 2,680 to 2,700 million years (Ma) ago. Folding along generally east-
trending axes has commonly produced isoclinal structures. Regional metamorphism is 
predominantly greenschist and prehnite-pumpellyite facies except in the contact aureoles of the 
Kenoran granites where amphibolite grade is usually attained. The amphibolite facies 
metamorphism also occurs in the sedimentary rocks of the Pontiac Group. Two main sets of 
diabase dykes occur in the Abitibi belt; the north-trending Matachewan swarm and northeast-
trending Abitibi swarm which have Rb-Sr ages of 2,690 and 2,147 Ma, respectively. The latter 
are prominent near the Dumont intrusion, although none is known to have cut the body. 

The Dumont sill is hosted by lavas and volcaniclastic rocks assigned to the Amos Group. The 
lavas may be traced eastwards through the town of Amos and are part of the Barraute volcanic

complex. Three cycles of mafic to felsic volcanism are recognized and the Dumont sill is one of 
at least five ultramafic-mafic complexes in the Amos area, which occur at approximately the 
same stratigraphic level within the mafic lavas of the middle cycle. The host rocks of the sill are 
for the most part iron-rich tholeiitic basaltic lavas although some intermediate rocks are known 
to occur at the body at its eastern end of the sill. 

Although the volcanic rocks have been folded and now dip steeply, a penetrative deformational 
fabric is only locally developed. In the vicinity of the Dumont sill, pillows in the lavas are not 
strongly deformed and primary textures such as "swallow-tail" plagioclase microlites are 
preserved. However, the chemical compositions of many of the rocks are highly altered with 
many rocks containing significant levels of CO2. Three main directions of faulting are recognized 
in the Amos area with the earliest being the east-trending set of "bedding plane" faults which are 
believed to have developed during the major period of folding. The second set of faults occurred 
during the intrusion of the granitic rocks, which was accompanied by the development of steeply 
dipping faults that strike north to northwest. However, the most prominent faults strike northeast 
and probably postdate the granitic plutonism with the Dumont sill cut by a number of these 
northeast, northwest and east-trending faults. 

7.2 Project Area Geology 
The property is covered by a layer of glacial overburden and muskeg. Mineralization subcrops 
approximately 30 m below the surface. Contacts between the Dumont sill and its host rocks 
have not been observed in outcrop but, in overall attitude, the body appears to be conformable 
to the layering of the volcanic rocks. This is consistent with the interpretation of the Dumont 
ultramafic body as a sill by Duke (1986), but is also consistent with alternate interpretations for 
conformable ultramafic bodies that occur in ophiolitic associations. Pillowed basalts exposed at 
the eastern end of the sill clearly indicate a northeast facing direction.  

Offsets in the magnetic contours and internal stratigraphy of the ultramafic zone along with 
oriented drill hole data have provided evidence for a number of faults at a high angle to the long 
axis of the sill consistent with the northeast, northwest and east-trending regional faults. 
Structural logging has also identified several faults parallel to the strike of the intrusion. Based 
on other offsets in mineralization and alteration, there are undoubtedly other faults which have 
not yet been recognized (Figure 7.2). 

The sill, considered to be a layered mafic-ultramafic intrusion (Duke, 1986) is comprised of a 
lower ultramafic zone and an upper mafic zone. Although less than 2% of the bedrock surface of 
the intrusion is exposed in outcrop, the boundaries of the ultramafic zone can be drawn with 
some confidence based on a magnetometer survey (Figure 7.2) and diamond drilling 
(Figure 7.3). 

Based on the identified prominent northwest (NW) and northeast (NE) trending faults, the sill 
can be divided into structural blocks/domains. The true thickness of the upper mafic and lower 
ultramafic zone varies by location or fault block though the sill. The north-western end of the 
body has not been outlined precisely; however, the ultramafic zone is a lenticular mass at least 
6,600 m in length with an average true thickness of 450 m, with a maximum of 600 m in the 
central region to a minimum of 150 m in the extreme southeast. The true dip of the ultramafic 
zone also varies with location in the sill from 60° to 70°. The extent of the mafic zone is much 
less well defined due to the low density of drill hole data intersecting this zone and its contact 
with the host rock. An estimated thickness of 200 m is given to this unit based on limited drill 
hole data and outcrop locations. No feeder to the Dumont sill has been observed to date.

The ultramafic zone is subdivided into the lower peridotite, dunite and upper peridotite 
subzones. The lower and upper peridotite subzones are olivine-chromite cumulates with 
variable amounts of intercumulus clinopyroxene. The dunite subzone is an extreme olivine 
adcumulate containing very small amounts of intercumulus chromite and clinopyroxene. 
Cumulus sulphide occurs in certain parts of the dunite subzone and also locally in the lower 
peridotite. The mafic zone is comprised of three subzones which are from the base upwards, 
the clinopyroxenite, the gabbro and the quartz gabbro. The clinopyroxenite subzone is an 
extreme clinopyroxene adcumulate at its base grading into clinopyroxene + plagioclase 
cumulate rocks in the overlying gabbro subzone. The quartz gabbro subzone includes both 
plagioclase + clinopyroxene cumulates and noncumulate gabbros that contain modal and 
normative quartz. Olivine and chromite are restricted to the ultramafic zone, and plagioclase 
occurs only in the mafic zone. 

7.2.1 Primary Sill Features 

The magnesium to magnesium plus iron ratios (Mg/Mg+Fe) of the ferromagnesian cumulus 
phases corresponds to the overall whole rock assay (Duke 1986). Whole rock assays show an 
increase gradually from the base of the sill upwards across the lower peridotite, and undergo an 
abrupt increase at or just above the base of the dunite. The magnesium to iron ratio through the 
dunite, remains essentially constant, however the stratigraphically lower dunite contains more 
iron than the stratigraphically upper dunite. At the upper dunite limit where it approaches the 
upper peridotite, there is a decrease in the Mg/Fe ratio, followed by iron enrichment upwards 
through the overlying part of the intrusion. 

Chromium content is lowest in the centre of the dunite sub layer and increases toward both the 
upper and lower margins of the dunite and into both the upper and lower peridotite. The 
increase in chromium corresponds to an increase in chromite. The increase in chromite towards 
the base of the lower dunite corresponds with the increase in iron of the lower dunite subzone.  

Magmatic sulphides are restricted to the lower peridotite and dunite subzones, in the latter they 
are strongly affiliated with the magnesium-rich upper dunite. Sulphides present in the lower 
peridotite represent a post-cumulus phase. Four olivine-sulphide cumulate layers occur locally 
within the dunite subzone but do not extend over the entire strike length of the sill.  

Two types of mineralization have been identified historically within the Dumont sill, the primary, 
large low-grade to medium-grade disseminated nickel deposit (Duke, 1986) and the contact 
type nickel-copper-platinum group elements (PGE) occurrence discovered in 1987 (Oswald, 
1987). Drilling by RNC has also identified discontinuous PGE mineralization associated with 
disseminated sulphides at lithological contacts in the layered intrusion and within the dunite. 

7.2.2 Secondary Sill Features 

The ultramafic rocks have been serpentinized to varying degrees from partial to complete 
serpentinization. Along the basal contact of the sill (outside the resource envelope) 
serpentinization is frequently overprinted by varying degrees of talc-carbonate alteration. The 
predominant secondary assemblage is lizardite + magnetite + brucite + chlorite + diopside ± 
chrysotile ± pentlandite ± awaruite ± heazlewoodite. Antigorite is developed locally, particularly 
in the uppermost ultramafic zone. Native copper occurs in and along major fault systems and 
alongside intercumulus nickel sulphide and awaruite mineralization, more frequently this has 
been observed in zones that are partially serpentinized. Trace millerite can occur in the 
steatitized rocks of the basal contact zone and more rarely in large fault zones. The mafic zone 
is ubiquitously altered to the assemblage actinolite + epidote + chlorite ± quartz. Primary 
textures are pseudomorphously preserved throughout most of the intrusion.

Serpentinization proceeded isovolumetrically on the microscopic scale. On the microscopic 
scale, serpentinization was isochemical. However, on the whole, as the major elements are re-
partitioned into new phases during the process, with the addition of hydrogen, oxygen (water) 
and chlorine to the system, some phases can be dissolved and transported. The extent of this 
process is not well described in literature; however, within the Dumont sill, RNC has observed 
some evidence (areas of lower than expected whole rock assays) indicating losses to the 
system, namely calcium, and sulphur.  

The textures and assemblages of the secondary minerals are indicative of, retrograde, low 
temperature (<350°C) alteration that may well have occurred as a result of an influx of water 
during the initial cooling of the intrusion. The sill was faulted and tilted into a steeply inclined 
attitude during the Kenoran event but no penetrative deformational fabric is evident, and the 
effects of regional metamorphism are minimal.

The age of the Dumont sill is not explicitly known. In early 2010, the Geological Survey of 
Canada (GSC) attempted to date the upper mafic zone, but was unsuccessful due to the lack of 
dateable minerals. The conformable nature of the body, together with the character of its 
differentiation, suggests that it was emplaced as a virtually horizontal sill that was folded and 
faulted during the Kenoran event. It is reasonable to conclude that the Dumont sill is of late 
Archean age, but is only slightly younger than the enclosing lavas; that are approximately 
2,700 Ma (Duke, 1986). 

7.3 Disseminated Nickel Mineralization 
Nickel-bearing sulphides and a nickel-iron alloy are enriched (grades > 0.35% nickel) in 
stratiform bands within the dunite subzone and are also broadly disseminated at lower 
concentrations throughout the dunite and lower peridotite subzones. The number and thickness 
of these bands varies from place to place in the deposit. Nickel sulphide and alloy 
concentrations decrease gradationally away from the centre of these bands toward the 
interband zones where mineralization continues at lower concentrations. The total nickel 
contained in these rocks occurs in variable proportions in sulphides, alloy and silicates 
depending on primary magmatic nickel mineralogy and the degree of serpentinization of the 
rock.  

7.3.1 Nickel Mineralogy 

Disseminated nickel mineralization is characterized by disseminated blebs of pentlandite 
((Ni,Fe)9S8), heazlewoodite (Ni3S2), and the ferronickel alloy, awaruite (Ni2.5Fe), occurring in 
various proportions throughout the sill. These minerals can occur together as coarse 
agglomerates, predominantly associated with magnetite, up to 10,000 µm (10 mm), or as 
individual disseminated grains ranging from 2 to 1,000 µm (0.002 to 1 mm). Figure 7.5 shows 
nickel mineralization in core from the Dumont property. Nickel can also occur in the crystal 
structure of several silicate minerals including olivine and serpentine.

The observed mineralogy of the Dumont deposit is a result of the serpentinization of a dunite 
protolith, which locally hosted a primary, disseminated (intercumulus) magmatic sulphide 
assemblage. The serpentinization process whereby olivine reacts with water to produce 
serpentine, magnetite and brucite creates a strongly reducing environment where the nickel 
released from the decomposition of olivine is partitioned into low-sulphur sulphides and newly 
formed awaruite. Nickel also occurs in remnant olivine and newly formed serpentine with the 
concentration of nickel in these minerals being dependent on the degree of serpentinization of 
the rock. The serpentinization process as it relates to nickel mineralogy is described in 
Section 7.3.3.1. 

Millerite (NiS) is rare, but can be present in lesser amounts near host rock contact zones and in 
major fault zones. It typically occurs as fine secondary overgrowths, characteristically 
overprinting pentlandite and heazlewoodite in intercumulus blebs (Figure 7.19 H). 

7.3.1.1 Nickel Mineralization Assemblages  

Mineralized zones containing pentlandite, awaruite, and heazlewoodite, are classified into the 
following mineralization assemblages; sulphide dominant, alloy dominant and mixed. RNC's 
mineralogical sampling program (described in Section 9.3.1.) provides a quantitative analytical 
measure of the whole-rock mineralogy on a crushed and homogenized 1.5 m core sample, 
which is the basis for understanding the combination of nickel mineral phases that constitutes 
these three assemblages: 

• Alloy mineralization is dominantly awaruite ± lesser heazlewoodite ± lesser pentlandite.  
• Mixed mineralization consists of sulphides and alloy in similar proportions. Specific sub-types 

are heazlewoodite and awaruite in similar proportions; pentlandite and awaruite in similar 
proportions; or heazlewoodite + pentlandite and awaruite in similar proportions.  

• Sulphide mineralization is dominantly heazlewoodite and/or pentlandite, with or without lesser 
awaruite. 

As noted above, these assemblages contain variable proportions of nickel in silicates. These 
mineralization assemblages are described in detail below with the aid of EXPLOMINTM 
QEMSCAN images and backscattered electrons (BSE) images. 

7.3.1.2 Sulphide Mineralization Assemblage 

The sulphide mineralization assemblage occurs in higher-grade bands (grades > 0.35% nickel) 
that are subparallel to the dip of, and principally in the centre of, the sill (Figure 7.4). Sulphide 
mineralization is dominated by pentlandite (Pn) and/or heazlewoodite (Hz) with lesser awaruite 
(Aw). Pentlandite and heazlewoodite occur as medium to coarse-grained blebs occupying 
intercumulus spaces in a primary magmatic texture, sometime exhibiting secondary overgrows 
within magnetic blebs. These blebs are often intimately associated with magnetite ± brucite ± 
chromite ± awaruite, in intercumulus spaces (Figures 7.6 and 7.7). Where awaruite is present 
with sulphides, it often observed to be a secondary overgrowth on pentlandite within the 
primarily textures intercumulus magnetite blebs. Up to three sulphide bands are found within the 
dunite where it is the thickest in the central southeast region of the sill. 

7.3.1.3 Alloy Mineralization Assemblage 

The alloy mineralization assemblage is characterized by the presence of awaruite with little to 
no sulphides. Awaruite occurs as fine grains (generally <1 mm) associated with small 
intercumulus magnetite or chromite blebs. Awaruite can also be observed as a secondary 
overgrowth on serpentine within the pseudomorphed grain. Alloy mineralization zones occur 
where primary sulphides are not present and serpentinization is near complete. Figure 7.8 
shows an example of the mineralogical textures in the alloy mineralization assemblage.

7.3.1.4 Mixed Mineralization Assemblage 
The mixed mineralization assemblage typically represents a transition from sulphide to alloy or 
sulphide (pentlandite) to sulphide (heazlewoodite) mineralization. The mixed mineralization 
assemblage contains varying amounts of sulphide (pentlandite and heazlewoodite) along with 
similar quantities of awaruite. Mineralization can occur as coarse sulphide-magnetite blebs 
associated with awaruite or as finely disseminated discrete grains. Figure 7.9 (above) shows an 
example of the mineralogical textures in the mixed mineralization assemblage. 

7.3.1.5 Non-Mineralized Ultramafic Zones:  Nickel in Silicates  

As noted above, nickel in silicates occurs in varying proportions throughout the deposit. In 
certain portions of the deposit, a very low proportion of the nickel in the rock is contained in 
sulphide or alloy minerals. In these areas, the nickel in the rock occurs primarily in silicate 
minerals such as serpentine or olivine. These non-mineralized areas are generally low-grade 
(<0.25% Ni), and contain no sulphides. Usually these are areas where serpentinization is 
incomplete and nickel remains held within the crystal structure of olivine ((Mg,Fe, Ni)2SiO4) 
and/or serpentine (Mg,Fe,Ni)3Si2O5(OH)4. Nickel occurring in this mode would not be 
recoverable through the flotation and magnetic separation methods considered by RNC for 
Dumont. 

In some of these zones, the nickel is not actually contained in the crystal structure of the 
serpentine, but occurs as very fine (<1 µm) sulphide or awaruite inclusions within the serpentine 
matrix (Figure 7.10).

The term "nickel in silicates" as used herein refers to nickel contained within minerals other than 
pentlandite (Pn), awaruite (Aw) and heazlewoodite (Hz), either as very fine inclusions of the 
three minerals too small to be classified as Pn, Hz or Aw by EXPLOMINTM, or within the mineral 
structure of the silicate minerals. The proportion of nickel in silicates varies throughout the sill 
(Table 7-1) and is dependent on the strength or state of serpentinization. Zones of the intrusion 
that are partially or weakly serpentinized generally have a larger proportion of nickel contained 
in silicates (High Iron Serpentine Domain, Table 7-1), compared to those that have been 
strongly serpentinized (Heazlewoodite Dominant and Mixed Sulphide, Table 7-1). Zones 
bearing sulphides generally have a lower proportion of nickel in silicates than those containing 
no sulphide (Table 7-1). These zones correlate with metallurgical recovery as discussed in 
Section 7.7.

(Hz) and awaruite (Aw) in the sample. % Ni in silicates = [(Nickel Assay - Metallic Nickel)/Nickel Assay], where the 
metallic nickel = % Modal abundance of Pn * %Ni in Pn + % Modal abundance of Hz * %Ni in Hz + % Modal abundance 
of Aw * %Ni in Aw. Where heazlewoodite modal abundance <0.1%, the average value of 27.3% Ni in Pn from electron 
microprobe data was used, for heazlewoodite modal abundance >=0.1, 32% Nickel was used for pentlandite. 73.1% 
and 71.4% Ni was used for Aw and Hz respectively across all domains. "Non-sulphide" is considered to be samples with 
sulphur <0.07% Source:  RNC. 

7.3.1.6 Nickel Tenor & Compositional Variability of Recoverable Minerals  

Electron microprobe analyses were performed to quantify the variability of nickel content (tenor) 
in key minerals of interest for samples from locations throughout the Dumont deposit 
(Figure 7.11). All minerals analysed showed low variability in nickel tenor throughout the sill with 
the exception for pentlandite and serpentine (Table 7-2).

Sulphide and Awaruite 

Pentlandite shows the most variability of the metallic minerals and exhibits a bimodal population 
(Figure 7.12). For samples where nickel tenor in pentlandite is lower, the lower nickel values are 
mostly associated with an increase in iron, and less so, sulphur. Within each subgroup, nickel 
tenor variability is low (Table 7-3).  

Figure 7.12:  Frequency Distribution for Percent Nickel in Pentlandite 

 
Source:  RNC. 

The bimodal distribution suggests that two populations are present. These populations 
correspond to spatially continuous zones within the deposit. Pentlandite, which is hosted by 
weakly serpentinized rock (Zones 3a, 4 in Figure 7.21), exhibits lower Ni tenors, compared to 
the higher Ni tenors of pentlandite in strongly serpentinized dunite (Zones 1, 2 &3b, Figure 
7.21).

Serpentine 

As expected, serpentines show a wide range of nickel tenors (Figure 7.13). At some analysis 
points nickel is reported at values higher than commonly expected within the serpentine 
structure ((Mg, Fe, Ni)3Si2O5(OH)4). As shown in Figure 7.10, serpentine can host inclusions of 
very fine-grained awaruite in its matrix. Those points where the nickel content in serpentine is 
reported as uncommonly high by the microprobe are likely measurements of sulphide or alloy 
inclusions finer than the width of the electron beam (Stephanie Downing, Senior Mineralogist, 
SGS Lakefield, pers. com.). The presence of fine nickel inclusions tends to be more common in 
samples that are higher in iron-serpentine content.

The iron content in magnetite shows low variability with an average of 71.2% Fe and standard 
deviation of 1.3. Ni, Cr, Mn are variable at the expense of changes in Fe content. The sum of 
the weight percent of Ni, Cr, Mn accounts for approximately 67% of the variability of Fe seen in 
magnetite EMP data (Figure 7.17). The remaining variability in Fe is due to spikes in Mg and Si 
which are attributed to edge effects. As a result of the secondary nature of magnetite, it is often 
intimately associated with serpentine in intercumulus bleb spaces; therefore the decreases in 
iron content which are associated with spikes in Mg and Si and are thought to be magnetite and 
serpentine associated on a scale of that of the electron beam.

7.3.2 Controls on Nickel Distribution & Mineralization – Serpentinization 

The variability in the final mineral assemblage and texture of the disseminated nickel 
mineralization in the Dumont deposit has been controlled primarily by the variable degree of 
serpentinization that the host dunite has undergone.  

Serpentinization is a metamorphic process involving heat and water in which low-silica mafic 
and ultramafic rocks are oxidized and hydrolysed with water into serpentinite. Peridotites and 
dunites are converted to serpentine, brucite and magnetite. In the process, large amounts of 
water are absorbed into the rock increasing the volume and destroying the structure. The 
density changes from 3.3 to 2.7 g/cm3 with a concurrent volume increase of approximately 
40%. The reaction is exothermic and large amounts of heat energy are produced in the process. 
Rock temperatures can be raised by nearly 260°C. The chemical reactions producing the 
magnetite produce hydrogen gas. Sulphates and carbonates are reduced and form methane 
and hydrogen sulphide. 

Generalized reactions for the serpentinization of olivine: 

Olivine + Water = Serpentine + Brucite 

2Mg2SiO4 + 3H2O = Mg3Si2O5(OH)4 + Mg(OH)2 

Olivine + Water + Oxygen = Serpentine + Magnetite 

6Mg1.5Fe0.5SiO4 + 6H2O + 0.5O2 = 3Mg3Si2O5 (OH)4 + Fe3O4 

In the early stages of the serpentinization process, water reacts with the primary phases hosting 
ferrous iron, a strong reducing environment is created where the ferrous iron is oxidized 
resulting in the production of dihydrogen and magnetite (Klein & Bach, 2009). In these early 
stages of serpentinization, olivine is decomposed to form iron and magnesium serpentine, iron 
brucite, magnetite and enough hydrogen so that the nickel-iron alloy awaruite is stable (Frost 
and Beard, 2007). Under such conditions, awaruite is produced by the desulphurization of

In zones of the Dumont dunite where the dominant assemblage is iron (Fe) and magnesium 
(Mg) serpentine + MgFe brucite ± magnetite ± olivine, serpentinization is incipient (Figure 7.21, 
Zones 3a, 4 and 5). Here the dominant nickel-bearing phases are pentlandite and awaruite 
(Figure 7.19, A to D). In the stratigraphically higher dunite in the central southeast (Figure 7.21, 
Zone 3a and 4 ), where olivine has almost been exhausted but the iron-rich phases of 
serpentine and brucite remain, awaruite grains are the coarsest observed in the Dumont sill and 
are clearly secondary overgrowths on pentlandite. (Figure 7.19, B to D). Since most of the iron 
is tied up in serpentine and brucite, the modal abundance of magnetite is low (<2%), thus the 
intercumulus blebs of pentlandite and awaruite are low in magnetite and can be devoid of 
magnetite altogether. In zones of the stratigraphically lower dunite (Figure 7.21, High Iron 
Serpentine Domain), where the olivine content can increase to as much as 40%, awaruite is 
almost never present and pentlandite is the dominant metallic nickel-bearing phase (Figure 
7.19, A). Intercumulus blebs are often without magnetite as significant amounts of olivine and 
iron serpentine are the major reservoirs of iron in this early stage.

Serpentinization is considered to take place on a grain-by-grain scale, whereby nickel is 
removed from the olivine and serpentine structure and mobilized from silicates to the metallic 
phases of the intercumulus blebs, resulting in an increase in the tenor of the nickel bearing 
phases in the intercumulus blebs (Duke, 1986). As a result, in zones where serpentinization is 
incomplete (Figure 7.21, High Iron Serpentine Domain), the percentage of nickel in silicates 
existing within the silicates structure or as microscopic inclusions of alloy and sulphide (Figure 
7.10) is generally higher (see Table 7-1). This incomplete remobilization of nickel to the 
intercumulus blebs has resulted in the population of lower tenor pentlandite (Table 7-5) 
associated with incomplete serpentinization (Figure 7.18).

Note:   

A) Incipient serpentinization. A significant amount of olivine 
remains. The process has not continued enough as to produce 
reducing conditions where the alloy awaruite is stable.  

B) Olivine is decomposed to form Fe and Mg serpentine, Fe 
brucite, and weak magnetite. Enough hydrogen is produced so 
that the nickel-iron alloy awaruite is stable. Pentlandite is 
desulphurized to produce awaruite (equation 1).  

C) Olivine is exhausted. Fe and Mg serpentine and Fe brucite 
remain. The breakdown of the Fe-rich phases has begun to 
produce more magnetite in intercumulus blebs. Brucite exists as 
pseudomorphed olivine centres.  

D) the near complete of the breakdown of iron-rich silicate 
phases, mainly Fe-brucite and serpentine, continue to produce 
mg-rich brucite rims, mg serpentine and more intercumulus 
magnetite. Awaruite begins to decompose to produce magnetite 
(equation 3).  

E to G) the remaining serpentines and brucites are Mg-rich. At 
this point the stability fields for serpentine and brucite expand 
such that they begin to consume previously produced alloys such 
as awaruite The accompanying increase in oxygen fugacity 
causes pentlandite and awaruite to continue to break down to 
produce heazlewoodite (equation 2 and 3).  

H) Serpentinization has continued well beyond the total 
consumption of olivine. The increase in oxygen fugacity has an 
associated increase in sulphur fugacity as a result magnetite is 
replaced by sulphur-rich nickel sulphides such as millerite 
(equation 4). Images  

I to J) are the non-sulphide analogues of A to H serpentinization. 
I is the least serpentinized with little to no awaruite.

sulphide process, awaruite appears to be stable/occurs well 
beyond complete serpentinization.

As serpentinization continues and olivine is consumed, iron serpentine and iron brucite break 
down to produce more magnetite, while the remaining serpentine and brucite become 
increasingly magnesium rich (Figure 7.19 D to G). At this point, the stability fields for serpentine 
and brucite expand such that they begin to consume previously produced alloys such as 
awaruite (Figure 7.19 transition from D to E). This results in an accompanying increase in 
oxygen fugacity (Beard and Frost, 2007). Under such conditions, pentlandite and awaruite 
continue to break down to produce heazlewoodite by equations (2) and (3) (Klein and Bach, 
2009) (Figure 7.19 F and G). 

Pentlandite + Water = Heazlewoodite + Magnetite + Hydrogen + Hydrogen Sulphide 

Ni4.5Fe4.5S8 + 6H2O = 1.5Ni3S2 + 1.5Fe3O4 + H2(aq) + 5H2S(aq) (2) 

Awaruite + Hydrogen Sulphide + Water = Magnetite + Heazlewoodite + Hydrogen 

3Ni3Fe + 6H2S(aq) + H2O = Fe3O4 + 3Ni3S2 +10H2(aq))  (3) 

In zones where serpentinization is complete (Figure 7.21, Zones 1, 2, and 3b), intercumulus 
blebs contain abundant magnetite ± pentlandite ± heazlewoodite with little to no awaruite 
(Figure 7.19, E to H). Generally, heazlewoodite and awaruite exhibit negative correlation on a 
zone scale. Where heazlewoodite content is high, awaruite is low. Where sulphides are not 
present, awaruite exists as finely disseminated grains associated with magnetite or brucite 
mesh rims. However, on the scale of a thin section, heazlewoodite and awaruite can occur 
together in the same bleb. Nickel remobilization to intercumulus spaces has been completed by 
late-stage serpentinization, thus the percentage of nickel hosted in silicates is generally lower in 
Zones 1, 2 and 3b (Figure 7.21) and the nickel tenor of pentlandite is higher. This is represented 
by the population of higher Ni tenor of 30% to 35% in Figure 7.18.  

Locally both early- and late-stage serpentinization features can be present in the same thin 
section. This effect is thought to be related to regional deformation and faulting. Localized strain 
may have caused fluid to travel through newly formed stress fractures focusing serpentinization 
along their route while leaving the relict olivine centres intact. Many of these thin sections exhibit 
a directional fabric that supports this hypothesis. (Figure 7.20 overleaf) 

Serpentinization can continue well beyond the total consumption of olivine. In very late-stage 
serpentinization where the common assemblage is Mg-serpentine + Mg brucite + magnetite ± 
heazlewoodite, as serpentinization continues, steatitization can occur where magnetite is 
replaced by sulphur-rich nickel sulphides such as millerite as per equation 4 (Figure 7.14G). 
These transitions indicate increasing oxygen and sulphur fugacities (Eckstrand, 1975; Frost 
1985). Mg serpentine and brucite can break down to produce talc (Klein and Bach, 2009). This 
is rare within the Dumont dunite, although observed locally around major structures and with 
more regularity at the basal contact of the intrusion (outside of resource envelope) where fluid 
flux was probably high. 

Heazlewoodite + Hydrogen Sulphide = Hydrogen + Millerite  

Ni3S2 + H2S(aq) = H2(aq)) + 3NiS  (4) 

In areas of the deposit where low concentrations of sulphur occur, the above serpentinization 
scheme is modified by the absence of sulphide phases. Where intercumulus sulphide blebs are 
not present, sulphur assay values are on average less than 0.05%, and awaruite is the 
dominant metallic nickel-bearing phase (Figure 7.19 K to L). This suggests that awaruite 
formation is not controlled by the desulphurization of primary sulphides.

For non-sulphide zones, where serpentinization is weak, the nickel in silicates is higher 
(Table 7-1), which in turn is associated with low values of awaruite modal abundances 
(Table 7-6). In non-sulphide zones where serpentinization is complete, the nickel in silicates 
values are lower (Table 7-1) and the modal abundances of awaruite is highest (Table 7-6). This 
evidence suggests that where serpentinization is incomplete or weak, and the remobilization of 
nickel is not complete, more nickel is hosted in silicates as opposed to creating awaruite. Where 
serpentinization and the associated nickel re-mobilization are complete, larger amounts of nickel 
have gone into forming awaruite, leaving less nickel in silicates. At later stages of 
serpentinization, well beyond the exhaustion of olivine, awaruite does break down, as modal 
abundances are low in domain 1 which corresponds to late stage serpentinization in Figure 
7.19, G and H. This suggests awaruite has a range of stability which is associated with partial to 
complete serpentinization. Samples with more awaruite have less nickel in silicates.

7.4 Contact-type Nickel-Copper-PGE Mineralization 
Magmatic nickel-copper-platinum group element (PGE) analyses were not performed during the 
initial drilling program that defined the Dumont deposit in the early seventies. In 1987, a drilling 
program (Oswald, 1988) was conducted to test the sill contacts for platinum and palladium at 
two locations. The best intersection from this program was drill hole 87-7, located in the east 
near drill hole E-7, inside and adjacent to the sill contact. This drill hole graded 0.61% nickel, 
0.10% copper, 190 ppb palladium and 900 ppb palladium over 6.4 m. Drill holes 87-12 to 14 in 
the main zone did not reach the contact.  

Drilling by RNC has confirmed the occurrence and grade of the historically identified 
mineralization at the basal contact at the eastern end of the Dumont sill. Drill hole 08-RN-71 
intersected 0.8 m of semi-massive pyrrhotite grading 0.99% nickel, 0.19% copper, 0.3 g/t 
platinum, 1.0 g/t palladium and 0.07 g/t gold at the contact between the Dumont intrusive and 
footwall volcanics.  

7.5 2011 Discovery of Massive Sulphides at Basal Contact 
A hole drilled on section 5500E, passing through the Dumont intrusion and penetrating the 
footwall contact between the peridotite and the footwall mafic volcanic rock just to the northwest 
of the FS pit intersected a 1.25 m core-length of massive sulphide mineralization (Figure 7.22). 
The massive sulphide was composed of >60% sulphides containing primarily pyrrhotite with up 
to 10% centimetre-scale pentlandite crystals and trace chalcopyrite. Assuming that this massive 
sulphide body is coplanar with the footwall contact (dipping 65˚ toward 025˚ azimuth), the true 
thickness of the mineralization would be 1.07 m. Borehole geophysical surveying 
(electromagnetic) and follow-up drilling have not defined any significant extent to this 
mineralization to date.

This is the first time that such elevated concentrations of sulphides with high metal grades have 
been encountered anywhere in the Dumont intrusion. This discovery demonstrates that 
mineralizing processes capable of producing high-grade massive sulphide mineralization have 
operated, at least locally, within the Dumont setting, particularly at the basal contact of the 
intrusion. Further work will focus on following up this intersection and on developing exploration 
vectors to explore the rest of the 7.5 km long basal contact for similar occurrences.  

7.6 Other Types of PGE Mineralization 
RNC's drilling has further delineated three anomalous PGE horizons other than the basal 
contact type described above. In 2008, a PGE horizon associated with the pyroxenite layer 
overlying the upper peridotite was identified. This zone varies in thickness from 0.4 to 51 m with 
grades ranging 0.08 to 1.46 g/t platinum, and 0.04 to 2.39 g/t palladium. The second PGE 
horizon, lies under the main sulphide body, was previously identified during research on the 
historical drilling (Brügmann, 1990). This zone ranges from 0.4 to 34.5 m thick with grades

ranging from 0.1 to 1.4% nickel, trace to 0.75 g/t platinum, and trace to 0.2 g/t palladium. The 
third PGE horizon was discovered by RNC in 2008 and is located approximately 100 m below 
the lowest sulphide body near the dunite contact with the lower peridotite. This horizon ranges 
from 1.0 to 140 m thick with grades ranging from 0.1 to 0.5% nickel, trace to 0.9 g/t platinum, 
and trace to 2 g/t palladium. These horizons generally are observed to be continuous along 
strike and dip where drilling is present. Samples from each PGE horizon were sent to Memorial 
University for analysis using scanning electron microscope. This work identified that the PGE 
phases are similar in all horizons and consist of three alloys:  palladium/tin (Pd/Sn), 
platinum/copper (Pt/Cu), and platinum/nickel (Pt/Nickel) which are intimately associated with 
nickel sulphides. 

7.7 Metallurgical Domaining of Nickel Mineralization  
Sections 7.1 and 7.2 describe the geological controls on nickel mineralization assemblages and 
their distribution as well as the controls on the nickel content of the pay and gangue minerals. 
Metallurgical test results (Section 13) show a clear correlation between mineralogical variations 
related to degree of serpentinization (described in Section 7.2.2 and illustrated in Figure 7.19) 
and metallurgical recovery of nickel. Four metallurgical domains have therefore been 
established that correspond to these serpentinization domains. They are defined mineralogically 
on the basis of heazlewoodite to pentlandite ratio (Hz/Pn) and iron-rich serpentine abundance 
as follows: 

• Heazlewoodite Dominant Domain:  Samples with heazlewoodite to pentlandite ratios (Hz/Pn) 
greater than 5, and contain an iron rich serpentine abundance less than 14% are considered 
to be heazlewoodite dominant (Figure 7.6). 

• Mixed Sulphide Domain:  Samples having a heazlewoodite to pentlandite ratio between 1 and 
5, and contain an iron rich serpentine abundance less than 14% are considered to be a 
combination of heazlewoodite and pentlandite (Figure 7.9).  

• Pentlandite Dominant Domain:  Samples with heazlewoodite to pentlandite ratios less than 1, 
and contain an iron rich serpentine abundance less than 14% are considered to be 
pentlandite dominant (Figure 7.7).  

• High Iron Serpentine Domain:  Samples that contain more than 14% iron rich serpentine. 
(FESP) as shown in Table 7-8.  

Pentlandite dominant samples (Hz/Pn<1, FESP<14) are most common making up a significant 
proportion of the reserve.  

Table 7-8 gives the abundance of each metallurgical domain as calculated from estimated 
mineral abundances in the resource block model for the measured and indicated resource 
within the pre-feasibility pit. Figure 7.23 shows the distribution of these domains within the 
Dumont deposit.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
Magmatic nickel-copper-platinum group element (PGE) deposits occur as sulphide 
concentrations associated with a variety of mafic and ultramafic magmatic rocks. The magmas 
originate in the upper mantle, and an immiscible sulphide phase occasionally separates from 
the magma as a result of the processes occurring during emplacement into the crust. The 
sulphide phase generally partitions and concentrates nickel, copper and PGE elements from the 
surrounding magma. The heavy sulphide droplets once concentrated and separated from the 
magma tend to sink towards the base of the magma, and form concentrated pockets or layers of 
sulphides that crystallize upon cooling to form mineral deposits.  

The Dumont mineral deposit comprises olivine + sulphide cumulates that comprise differentiated 
layers of the Dumont sill, an Archean komatiitic intrusion contained within the Archean Abitibi 
Greenstone Belt of northwestern Quebec. As such, it is usually classified (Naldrett, 1989) with 
its most analogous counterpart, the Mt. Keith mineral deposit located in the Agnew-Wiluna 
Greenstone Belt within the Archean Yilgarn craton of West Australia. 

Greenstone belts are typical terranes found in many Archean cratons, and may represent 
intracratonic rift zones. The greenstone belts are generally composed of strongly folded, 
basaltic/andesitic volcanics and related sills, siliciclastic sediments, and granitoid intrusions that 
have been metamorphosed to greenschist and amphibolite facies, and typically adjoin tonalitic 
gneiss terranes. Komatiitic rocks form an integral part of some of these greenstone belts. 

Both the Dumont and Mt. Keith deposits have undergone pervasive serpentinization and local 
talc-carbonate alteration due to metamorphism to mid-upper greenschist facies. This alteration 
history has resulted in liberation of much of the nickel from nickel silicates (olivine) and 
consequent upgrading of the primary magmatic nickel-sulphide and nickel-alloy minerals 
through partitioning of nickel. However, the Dumont deposit is differentiated from the Mt. Keith 
deposit by the abundance of the nickel-iron alloy awaruite and by the restricted extent of talc-
carbonate alteration, which is limited to the basal contact of the intrusion and occurs outside the 
resource envelope. Also, the Dumont deposit has not been subjected to the extensive 
supergene weathering alteration present at Mt. Keith.

9 EXPLORATION 
Exploration for nickel mineralization on the Dumont property has been completed primarily by 
diamond drilling due to the lack of outcrop over the ultramafic portions of the Dumont intrusive 
which host the nickel mineralization. This drilling was initially targeted using data from historical 
drilling and airborne electromagnetic and magnetic surveys. Drilling programs and results are 
described in Section 10. 

No continuous trench samples were taken from the Dumont deposit. Non-drilling exploration 
work carried out on the Dumont property is described below. 

9.1 Geophysics 

9.1.1 Airborne Geophysics 

A helicopter-borne versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) and magnetometer survey 
was completed by Geotech Ltd. over the Dumont intrusive and adjacent areas at 100 metre line 
spacing in 2007 as follow up to an earlier helicopter-borne magnetometer-only survey 
conducted by Geophysics GPR International Inc. in February 2007. Figure 9.1 shows a gridded 
plot of the first vertical derivative of total magnetic intensity. 

The magnetic survey has outlined the limits of the Dumont sill which exhibits a strong contrast 
between its magnetic susceptibility and that of the surrounding country rocks. The survey has 
also defined stratiform bands of varying magnetic intensity which reflect varying magnetite 
content within these rocks which is related to the igneous layering within the sill and to varying 
degrees of serpentinization within a given layer. The magnetic pattern also allows the 
interpretation of major structures that cross-cut the intrusion. 

The VTEM survey detected several weak electromagnetic anomalies along the footwall contact 
of the Dumont intrusive. Several of these anomalies were drill-tested. Anomalies tested to date 
were primarily due to barren pyritic interflow sediments within the footwall volcanic.

9.1.2 Ground & Drill hole Geophysics 

In February 2013, a ground time-domain electromagnetic survey was completed over a portion 
of the footwall of the Dumont intrusion. The purpose of this survey was to evaluate the potential 
for massive sulphide similar to the occurrence intersected in drill hole 11-RN-355 (see Section 
7.5) in an orientation subparallel to the basal contact of the intrusion. A 100-metre spaced grid 
was established between lines 5300E and 7000E and an InfinTEM time-domain electromagnetic 
survey was completed over the grid. Interpretation of the results indicated weak to moderate 
large-scale conductive horizons coincident with the footwall contact, but did not indicate discrete 
conductors consistent with significant accumulations of massive nickel sulphides. These results 
are consistent with results from drill hole geophysical surveys (UTEM time domain 
electromagnetics) conducted on several drill holes in the vicinity of hole 11-RN–355 from 
September to November 2011. Follow-up work will consist of conducting another survey using a 
loop configuration that will evaluate potential massive sulphide accumulations controlled by 
cross-cutting structures. 

9.2 Geological Mapping 
Surface mapping programs have been carried out over the Dumont property, primarily to 
provide a structural geology framework for the modelling of the Dumont deposit.

Several geological mapping programs have been completed over the Dumont property 
beginning in the summer of 2008. Given the poor exposure over the Dumont sill, the mapping 
programs have focused on outcrops in the country rocks outside the sill, in order to gain an 
understanding on the local structural geology. A secondary purpose for these programs has 
been to identify outcrop in areas of potential mining infrastructure development. Information 
collected during these programs was interpreted in association with airborne magnetics and 
LIDAR topography data and was used to update historic geological maps and to provide 
constraints for subsurface fault modelling. Outcrop locations were also used to assist in 
modelling of the bedrock surface and overburden thickness. 

In 2012, detailed structural mapping of several outcrops, including the 57 m x 27 m exposure of 
dunite cleared for the purpose of bulk sampling described in Section 9.4 was completed in 
support of the structural modelling of the deposit (Fedorowich, 2012). A structural mapping 
example from the outcrop bulk sample location is shown in Figure 9.2 and the location is 
labelled in Figure 9.3 as "Outcrop Bulk Sample Location."

9.3 Mineralogical Sampling 
Mineralogical sampling of Dumont core began in 2009. The mineralogical sampling program 
uses the SGS Minerals Services' EXPLOMINTM analysis to provide detailed mineralogical 
information on mineral assemblages, nickel deportment, liberation, alteration and the variability 
of these factors. Mineralogical samples were taken for the purpose of metallurgical domain 
composite characterization and for the purpose of mineralogical mapping of the Dumont 
deposit. 

Mineralogical mapping sample locations were planned so as to provide spatially and 
compositionally representative data down drill hole traces for holes on even numbered sections 
along the length of the deposit as shown in Figure 9.3, with the goal of providing comprehensive 
representation of the mineralogical variability of the deposit. A total of 1561 mineralogical 
mapping samples were collected as of 25 November 2012, 1420 of which occur within the 
mineralized envelope and were used for mineralogical modelling of the deposit as described in 
Section 14.

Metallurgical domain composite characterization samples were selected on an ongoing basis to 
represent the mineralogy of each metallurgical domain composite as defined for testwork. This 
includes all domain composites described in Section 13, as well as all metallurgical composites 
defined in the mini pilot plant test (PQ) drill holes.  

The sampling and analytical procedures for both types of samples are identical and described in 
Section 11.1.2.  

9.4 Outcrop Bulk Sampling 
In the spring of 2011 a mineralized serpentinized dunite outcrop located in the eastern portion of 
the deposit on line 9850E was prepared for bulk sampling (Figure 9.4). Nickel mineralization in 
the sampled portion of the outcrop is dominated by heazlewoodite.

A section of the outcrop measuring approximately 40 m x 55 m was cleared of glacial 
overburden with an excavator and power washed. A smaller area within this was identified for 
sampling and subsequently drilled and blasted to a depth of approximately 1.5 m.  

Approximately 100 tonnes of this material was used in the in-situ environmental geochemistry 
characterization cells described in Section 20. Approximately 3 tonnes of this material were 
used for metallurgical testing as described in Section 13.

9.5 Chrysotile Quantification 
A logging program to quantify the bulk chrysotile content of dunite and peridotite from the 
Dumont deposit was completed from January to March 2013. This program involved relogging a 
representative sample of 13 holes (Figure 9.5). RNC has developed a standard logging 
procedure for the quantitative visual estimation of chrysotile in drill core. This method has been 
validated by independent external experts (Verschelden and Jourdain, 2013) and provides 
reproducible and quantifiable results and is described in Section 11.1.7. Results of the 
determinations are presented in Tables 9-1 and 9-2 (overleaf). Table 9-2 reveals that the 95% 
confidence interval for the average bulk chrysotile content for dunite and peridotite is between 
1.6% and 1.9%.

10 DRILLING 
Upon acquiring the Dumont property, RNC conducted an initial exploration drilling program 
which consisted of 5 twin holes to confirm the historic drilling results in 2007. Results from this 
drilling campaign confirmed the historical drilling results and encouraged RNC to embark on an 
extensive drilling campaign to fully evaluate the Dumont deposit. RNC has since conducted core 
diamond drilling on the Dumont property for the purposes of exploration, resource definition, 
metallurgical sampling and bedrock geotechnical investigation. RNC has also conducted core 
drilling and cone penetration testing for the purpose of overburden geotechnical 
characterization. A summary of the drilling conducted on the property since 2007 is given in 
Table 10-1. Figure 10.1 illustrates the location of all diamond drill and sonic holes completed by 
RNC on the Dumont property classified by type, and Figure 10.2 illustrates the location of all 
diamond drill and sonic holes completed by RNC on the Dumont property classified by year of 
drilling. Figure 10.3 illustrates the locations of all overburden testing sites.  

No continuous trench samples were taken from the Dumont deposit. 

RNC contracted Forages M. Rouillier (Rouillier) of Amos, Quebec to conduct core diamond 
drilling. Rouillier used custom built diamond drill rigs mounted on skids or self-propelled tracked 
vehicles with NQ diameter diamond drill coring tools. On occasion, HQ and PQ diameter core 
was drilled. Rouillier is an independent diamond drilling contractor that holds no interest in RNC.  

For the purpose of establishing sections and for easy location reference in the context of the 
strike of the deposit, a local grid coordinate system has been established with a baseline 
approximately parallel to the strike of the Dumont sill and the general trend of the mineralized 
zones. Grid lines are oriented at an azimuth of 045° and the origin of the grid (grid coordinates 
0E, 0N) is located at UTM NAD83 Zone 17 coordinates 678,160E, 5,392,714N. This grid was 
established for ease of reference and section plotting only and is shown in Figure 10.1. This is a 
virtual grid and no physical grid lines have been cut in the field. Drill collar coordinates continue 
to be recorded and reported in UTM NAD83 Zone 17 coordinates and drill hole directional data 
are recorded and reported relative to astronomic (true) north. 

Drill hole directional surveys were conducted using a Maxibor down-hole survey tool which 
calculates the spatial coordinates along the drill hole path based on optical measurements of 
direction changes and gravimetric measurements of dip changes. Drill holes are subsequently 
subject to a differential global positioning system (DGPS) location and deviation surveys using a 
north-seeking gyro by a certified surveyor before integration of the drilling data into the resource 
estimation database. Core recovery is very good and is generally greater than 95% with no 
statistical difference along strike or by geological or metallurgical domain. 

All geological, engineering and supervision portions of the drilling program were overseen by 
geological staff of RNC, principally Mr. John Korczak, P.Geo., Mr. Lorne Burden, P.Geo., and 
Mr Robert Cloutier, Geo., OGQ supervised by Mr. Alger St-Jean, P.Geo., Vice-President 
Exploration for RNC.

10.1 Resource Definition & Exploration Drilling 
The sectional resource definition drilling program, initiated in 2007, was designed to maintain a 
nominal 100 m spacing between holes within the plane of the section and along strike between 
sections from section 5600E to Section 10000E. Drill spacing was decreased to 50 m by 50 m in 
two selected variability testing blocks centred on section 8250E and on section 6850E. Outside 
of the 10000E to 5600E range, exploration drilling was conducted along the trend of the Dumont 
intrusion, usually at wider spacing. Several exploration holes were drilled where conductive 
anomalies detected by the VTEM airborne geophysical survey conducted in 2007 coincided with 
the basal contact of the intrusion. 

The program was designed to define mineralization down to a nominal depth of 500 m from 
surface (-200 m elevation). In places, drilling has investigated mineralization down to a depth of 
700 m (-400 m elevation). Figure 10.1 illustrates the location of all holes completed during the 
sectional resource definition and exploration drilling program. Representative examples of drill 
sections through the Dumont deposit are given in Figure 10.4 (section 6000E), Figure 10.5 
(section 6600E), Figure 10.6 (section 7600E), and Figure 10.7 (section 8350E). See Figure 10.1 
for location of section lines. In general, the core recovery for the diamond drill holes on the 
Dumont property has been better than 95% and very little core loss due to poor drilling methods 
or procedures has been experienced. Core recovery does not vary along strike or by geological 
or metallurgical domain.

10.2 Structural Drilling 
For the purpose of defining major geological structures (faults) in the central portion of the 
deposit, 1,359 m were drilled in 4 oriented core holes in 2009. These holes were drilled parallel 
to the strike of the deposit and at high angles to the major structures that cross-cut the deposit. 
Data from these structural holes were combined with the global drill hole database and surface 
mapping by John Fedorowich, Ph.D., P.Geo., of Itasca Consulting, to produce a first order 
structural model (Fedorowich, 2010) for the deposit that was used to delimit structural domains 
and help constrain the resource block model (see Section 9.2). Since 2009, several resource 
definition and exploration holes in zones of structural complexity have also been oriented to 
augment the structural model.  

The structural model was revised and updated by SRK in 2011 (SRK Consulting Canada Inc., 
2011) using oriented core data collected during the 2011 geotechnical drilling campaign (see 
Section 10.3). Itasca Consulting further updated the structural model using data collected during 
the 2012 geotechnical drilling campaign, data from detailed surface mapping, and regional 
geophysical surveys (Fedorowich, 2012). 

10.3 Bedrock Geotechnical Drilling 
In order to define rock mass characteristics and evaluate open-pit wall slope angles on an 
indicative basis, data collection for a preliminary geotechnical study was carried out in 2009. 
Work associated with this study included the measurement and analysis of 1,503 m of NQ size 
core from drilling 3 oriented core holes near section 6800E (GENIVAR, 2010b), and a limited 
hydrogeological study between sections 6500E and 7500E (GENIVAR, 2009b). This data

helped define the open pit wall slope angles used in the Preliminary Assessment (Lewis et al, 
2010). 

Upon initiation of the pre-feasibility study, a geotechnical investigation program was designed by 
SRK and implemented by RNC staff under the supervision of SRK in 2011. The program 
consisted of 5,050 m of oriented HQ size core in 10 drill holes. Data from this drilling program 
was utilized by SRK in order to complete a pre-feasibility level geotechnical assessment for 
slope design as described in Section 16.2.1. The assessed parameters include rock quality 
designation (RQD), fracture frequency per metre (FF/m), empirical field estimates of intact rock 
strength (IRS), field (point load) and laboratory (uniaxial compressive and triaxial) strength, and 
RMR89 (Bieniawski, 1989). Hydraulic test data (49 packer tests) were also collected during this 
drilling program and used to map the distribution of bedrock hydraulic conductivity across the 
site and define bedrock hydrogeological domains.  

An additional geotechnical investigation program designed by SRK was implemented by RNC 
staff under the supervision of SRK starting in December 2011 and was completed in May 2012. 
The program consisted of 6,163 m of oriented NQ size core in 11 drill holes. Data from this 
drilling program has been used by SRK to complete further FS level geotechnical assessment 
for slope design. 

10.4 Overburden Geotechnical Drilling  
Overburden geotechnical drilling was carried out in three phases. A limited overburden 
characterization program was carried as part of the preliminary evaluation in 2010. This was 
followed by a more extensive program of overburden coring by sonic drilling and cone 
penetration testing in support of the pre-feasibility study in 2011. Another more detailed program 
incorporating sonic drilling, cone penetration testing and metasonic probing to support feasibility 
level design work was completed in 2012. Locations of overburden geotechnical holes are 
shown in Figure 10.3. 

10.4.1 Preliminary Overburden Characterization 

The preliminary geotechnical (overburden) drilling program conducted in 2010 consisted of five 
holes totalling 104 m (GENIVAR, 2010c). This initial program was designed to characterize the 
overburden material located above the indicated resources in order to aid engineering work for 
the preliminary assessment. The program also allowed for the installation of three piezometers 
for groundwater measurements. 

10.4.2 Sonic Drilling Program 

During the winter of 2011, drill holes were completed at 66 locations using a sonic drill rig which 
employs high frequency, resonate energy to advance the core barrel and casing into the 
ground. The drill hole plan and locations were strongly influenced by site accessibility, 
particularly in relation to areas outside the proposed open pit. Core recovery was high and was 
complemented by various field performance tests to evaluate the geotechnical properties. The 
groundwater level was measured immediately after completion of each drill hole and a number 
of monitoring and pumping wells were installed for future field permeability testing. An array of 
other laboratory tests were subsequently completed on select samples obtained during the 
drilling program. A drill hole log was prepared for each borehole and the laboratory test results 
are also included on the respective borehole log. 

In the winter of 2012, additional drill holes were completed at 63 locations using a sonic drill rig. 
Data from this drilling program was incorporated into the geotechnical database and was used 
by SRK to complete FS level geotechnical assessments and infrastructure designs.

10.4.3 Cone Penetration Testing 

During the winter of 2011, cone penetration testing (CPT) was undertaken at 62 probe hole 
locations using a track-mounted vehicle specifically built for CPT programs. The electronic 
piezocone measured parameters such as tip pressure, sleeve friction and porewater pressure 
every five centimetres as the cone was advanced into the ground. Pore pressure dissipation 
and seismic tests were carried out in select locations to provide additional information on soil 
characteristics. The CPT was terminated in each hole when the probe met refusal, which 
occurred in very dense soil or when bedrock was encountered. The CPT results from each 
probe hole are presented as a series of plots showing the tip pressure, sleeve friction and 
porewater pressure along with the interpreted soil profile of the hole as shown in Figure 10.8. 

Figure 10.8:  Example of CPT Results for Hole 11RNCPT08 

 
Source:  RNC. 

Further to the initial program, in the winter of 2012, 80 additional CPT probe holes were 
completed. Data from this program was incorporated into the geotechnical database and was 
used by SRK to complete FS level geotechnical assessments and infrastructure designs. 

10.4.4 Metasonic Probing 

From June to November 2012, a metasonic probing program was carried out to evaluate the 
thickness of superficial glacial clay and silt deposits underlying the locations of proposed 
mine/mill infrastructure development (tailings storage facility, ore stockpiles, waste and 
overburden dumps, water reservoirs). The metasonic probe is a tool that vibrates NQ or BQ 
sized rods through soft unconsolidated sediments. The instrument was able to penetrate clay 
and silt layers through to refusal in a sand and/or gravel horizon at the base of the clay-silt 
sequence. At most probe locations a 1.5 m sample was taken when the instrument first 
penetrated into glacial clay and another at the end of the hole (refusal). Metasonic probing was 
completed at 153 sites as shown in Figure 10.3.

10.5 Metallurgical Drilling 

10.5.1 General 

Drilling was carried out in 2010 to collect samples for bench-scale metallurgical variability 
testing and crushing testwork. A total of 2,774 m of drilling in 13 holes was completed for 
metallurgical domain composite sampling, and 3 holes totalling 406 m were completed for 
crushing testwork. Additional metallurgical samples were taken from holes drilled as part of the 
sectional resource drilling program. 

10.5.2 Drilling for Mini Pilot Plant Sampling  

The objective of the mini pilot plant sampling drilling was to provide representative mineralogical 
variability in a larger sample size for testwork at RNC's mini pilot plant located in Thetford 
Mines, Quebec. A series of 7 pilot drill holes totalling 1,757 m were completed to characterize 
the near-surface mineralization in order to select representative mineralization domains for 
sampling by large diameter drilling for mini pilot plant testing in 2010. On the basis of the results 
from these pilot holes, four locations were selected for large diameter (PQ-size) diamond drill 
coring and thirteen holes totalling 2,785 m were completed. Multiple holes were planned on 
each site in order to acquire a sufficient sample of each metallurgical domain. Location of the 
pilot holes and the selected PQ drilling sites is shown in Figure 10.1. 

The mini pilot plant sample drill holes (PQ) are sampled according to the variability domain 
composites defined in the pilot holes. Sampling procedures are described in Section 11.1.3. 
Samples were stored on site in Amos until required for testwork in the RNC mini pilot plant. 
Figure 10.9 on the following page shows the site of the 10-RN-218 mini pilot plant drill hole 
collars.  

10.6 Regional Exploration Drilling 
A diamond drilling program was designed to evaluate exploration targets that occur on the 
Dumont property outside the Dumont resource. A total of 3,392 m in 13 holes was drilled from 
March to April 2013 to evaluate a series of geophysical targets. The location of these holes is 
shown in Figure 10.1.  No significant results were returned from this regional drilling program.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS, SECURITY 
Descriptions of the historical sampling methods and approaches for the Dumont property have 
been previously provided in Section 6 of this report. Prior to the initial drilling program conducted 
in 2007, RNC did not conduct any sample preparation or analysis, as no samples were collected 
from the property during the period leading up to the drilling program. Since initiating field 
exploration work in March 2007 RNC has maintained strict sample preparation and security 
procedures and a Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program following industry best 
practices.  

SRK reviewed sample preparation, analyses, and security procedures and discussed the 
QA/QC program with RNC staff during the site visit in 2011. SRK also performed independent 
data analyses verification checks as described in Section 12 and has also reviewed the results 
of the QA/QC program for the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 Technical Reports.  

In the opinion of SRK the sampling preparation, security and analytical procedures used by 
RNC are consistent with generally accepted industry best practices and are therefore adequate. 

11.1 Sample Preparation & Analyses  
There has been no change to core drilling assay/geochemical, mineralogical mapping, mini pilot 
plant sampling methods, electron microprobe determinations, comminution testwork, and 
geochemical characterization of Dumont rocks and tailings described below since the last 
Technical Report entitled "Technical Report on the Dumont project, Launay and Trécesson 
Townships, Quebec, Canada" (June 2012). A new sampling campaign for chrysotile 
quantification has since been initiated and is described below. 

11.1.1 Drill Core Assay/Geochemical Sampling 

11.1.1.1 Sample Collection & Transportation 

Diamond drilling sampling controls start after a run has been completed and the rods are pulled 
out of the drill hole. The core is removed from the core barrel and placed in core boxes. The 
capacity of each box depends on the diameter of core stored in it (1.5 m for PQ diameter, 3.0 m 
for HQ diameter or 4.5 m for NQ diameter). This follows standard industry procedures. 

Small wooden tags mark the distance drilled in metres at the end of each run. On each filled 
core box, the drill hole number and sequential box numbers are marked by the drill helper and 
checked by the geologist. Once the core box is filled at the drill site, the box is covered with a lid 
to protect the core and the box is sent to the core logging facility in Amos at the end of each 
shift for further processing. In general, the core recovery for the diamond drill holes on the 
Dumont property has been better than 95% and little core loss due to poor drilling methods or 
procedures has been experienced. There is no statistical difference on core recovery along

11.1.1.2 Core Logging & Sampling 

Once the core boxes arrive at the logging facility in Amos, the boxes are laid out in order, the 
lids are removed and the head of the first box is marked in red to denote the starting point of the 
drill hole. The core is then laid out on the logging table and cleaned to remove any grease and 
dirt which may have entered the boxes. The core is stored sequentially hole by hole in racks for 
logging. Core logging consists of two major parts:  geotechnical logging and geological logging.

The diamond drill core sampling is conducted by a team of several staff geologists, all 
geologists in training (GIT) and geological technicians under the close supervision of the RNC 
geologist in charge of the program on site. The RNC staff geologists are responsible for the 
integrity of the samples from the time they are taken until they are shipped to the preparation 
facilities in Rouyn-Noranda or Timmins. 

The geotechnical logging is completed first to check the core pieces for best fit and to determine 
core recovery, Rock Quality Designation (RQD), Index of Rock Strength (IRS) and magnetic 
susceptibility. The number of open (natural) fractures in the core is counted and the fracture 
surfaces are evaluated for their joint surface condition. 

Geological logging follows and is comprised of recording the lithology, alteration, texture, colour, 
mineralization, structure and sample intervals. All geotechnical and geological logging and 
sample data are recorded directly into a computerized database using CAE Mining's (formerly 
Century Systems) DHLogger data logging software. 

During the core logging process the geologists define the sample contacts and designate the 
axis along which to split the core with special attention paid to the mineralized zones to ensure 
representative splits. All core which is classified as dunite by the geological logging is marked in 
1.5 m intervals for sampling. Any mineralized sections outside the dunite are also marked for 
sampling. Outside the dunite unit a minimum of one, 1.5 m control sample in every 10 m of core 
is taken. See Figure 11.1 for a photograph of the core logging facilities in Amos. 

Samples are identified by inserting three identical pre-fabricated, sequentially-numbered, 
weather-resistant sample tags at the end of each sample interval. 

Once the core is logged, photographed and the samples are marked, the core boxes are 
transferred to the cutting room for sampling. Sections marked for sampling are split using a 
diamond saw. Once the core is split in half, one half is placed into a plastic sample bag and the 
other half is returned to the core box. The core cutting technicians verify that the interval on the 
sample tag matches the markings on the core and that the sample tag matches the sample 
number on the bag. The half of the cut core returned to the core box is then re-marked by the 
core technician with a grease pencil to indicate the end of the sample interval. The boxes 
containing the remaining half core are stacked and stored on site in the secure core storage 
facility.  

Duplicate, blank and standard samples are inserted into the sample stream at regular intervals 
using a sequential numbering scheme set up by RNC.

Once the sample is placed in its plastic sample bag, the bag is secured with electrical tie wraps 
and the sample bags are placed into large fabrene sacks. Generally, seven sample bags are 
placed into each fabrene bag and then the bag is secured with an electrical tie wrap. The 
fabrene sample bags remain secured in the core shack in Amos until they are shipped to the 
laboratory by courier. The general shipping rate for the samples is once for every 100 to 150 
samples. 

After-hours access to the core logging, core cutting and core storage facilities, as well as the 
project office, is controlled by a zoned alarm system with access restrictions based on employee 
function. 

11.1.1.3 Sample Preparation & Analysis 

Since 1 June 2008, RNC's samples have been prepared at ALS Minerals' (formerly ALS-
Chemex) preparation facility in Timmins, Ontario and analyzed at ALS Minerals' laboratory in 
Vancouver, British Columbia. Both the preparatory facility and assay laboratory have ISO 
9001:2000 certification. Expert Laboratories, located in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec is not ISO 
certified; however, it does participate in the CANMET round-robin proficiency testing twice 
yearly. Prior to 1 June 2008, all samples were assayed at Expert Laboratories and then all the 
pulps were re-assayed at ALS Minerals. 5% of each assay batch returned from ALS Minerals is 
randomly selected for check assay. Until June 2011 the check assays occurred at Expert 
Laboratories, subsequently RNC changed the umpire laboratory to AGAT Laboratories in 
Mississauga. AGAT is ISO 9001:2000 certified and accredited by the Standards Council of 
Canada (SCC).

Once the samples reach ALS Minerals' Timmins preparation laboratory, each sample is dried as 
needed, crushed, and split into "reject" and a 250 g aliquot for pulverization. After pulverization 
the 250 g pulverized sample aliquot is again split into a 150 g master sample and a 100 g 
analytical sample. The 150 g master sample is stored in the Timmins facility for reference and 
the 100 g analytical sample is forwarded to the ALS Minerals analytical laboratory for assaying 
in Vancouver. On receipt in Vancouver, the specific gravity of the analytical sample material is 
measured by gas pycnometer, and this is followed by a 35-element analysis using an aqua 
regia digestion and ICP-AES finish. Where reported nickel values exceed 4,000 ppm, a second 
analysis is completed from the 100 g analytical sample using a four acid total digestion with an 
ICP-AES finish. This 4,000 ppm threshold reanalysis was raised to 10,000 ppm on 1 June 2008. 
In addition, all samples are assayed for precious metals (gold, platinum, palladium) using a 
standard fire assay with an ICP-AES finish.  

After a holding period at the laboratories, all pulps and rejects are returned to RNC in Amos for 
long-term storage. 

All analytical data are reconciled with the drill log sample records and recorded in the project 
database. For the purpose of geological and resource modelling, the ALS Minerals aqua regia 
determinations are used for samples under 10,000 ppm nickel and the ALS Minerals total 
digestion determinations are used for samples over 10,000 ppm nickel. 

11.1.1.4 Control Samples 

As part of RNC's QA/QC procedures, a set of control samples comprised of a blank, a field 
duplicate and a standard reference material sample, are inserted sequentially into the sample 
stream. The cut core samples, along with the inserted control samples, are then shipped to the 
ALS Minerals assay preparation facility in Timmins. 

11.1.1.5 Blank Samples 

The blank samples used for the Dumont project consist of local esker sand. The esker sand is 
collected in 205-L drums by a local Amos construction contractor. Randomly selected samples 
were collected from the drum and assayed at ALS Minerals to evaluate the composition of the 
sand and determine its suitability for use as a blank control sample. The assayed nickel grades 
from these samples range from 30 to 80 ppm. The qualified blank sample drum is sealed and 
placed at a clean place for further use. RNC sets 100 ppm nickel as the recommended upper 
limit of the blank sample value. 

The blank samples are submitted into the sample stream at the rate of approximately one for 
every 25 samples. 

11.1.1.6 Duplicate Samples 

A duplicate sample is submitted into the sample stream at a rate of approximately one for every 
25 samples. The sample and its duplicate consist of quartered core from the given sample 
interval. The remaining half-core is placed back into the core box for future reference. 

11.1.1.7 Standard Reference Material Samples 

The Standard Reference Material Samples (SRMS) are inserted into the sample stream at the 
rate of approximately one for every 25 samples. Initially one high-grade SRMS (OREAS 14P) 
was inserted into the sample stream for every three low-grade SRMS (OREAS 13P) submitted. 
On the phasing out of OREAS 13P and 14P, OREAS 70P was inserted into the sample stream 
at the same sample rate of one for every 25 samples. An exception to this occurs where logging 
personnel visually recognize zones of higher grade mineralization; through these high-grade

zones OREAS 72a is inserted. If the situation arises where the twenty-fifth sample is 
consistently located in between higher grade mineralization zones, a higher grade sample will 
be inserted outside the one-in-25 sequence to ensure that the higher grade zones are 
represented by standard reference materials. 

Four SRMS have been used in the project. The SRMS were prepared by Ore Research & 
Exploration Pty. Ltd. of Australia. Table 11-1 summarizes the specifications for the SRMS.

11.1.2 Mineralogical Mapping Sampling 

The mineralogical mapping sampling program uses SGS Minerals Services' (formerly SGS 
Lakefield) EXPLOMINTM application of Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning electron 
microscopy (QEMSCAN) methods to provide detailed mineralogical information on mineral 
assemblages, nickel deportment, liberation, alteration and the variability of these factors. 
Mineralogical samples were taken for the purpose of metallurgical domain composite 
characterization and for the purpose of mineralogical mapping of the Dumont deposit.  

11.1.2.1 Sample Definition & Sampling 

The mineralogical mapping sampling program samples a quarter of the NQ core drilled and 
previously sampled for the resource definition program. In areas of interest, sample length and 
location are defined to coincide with previous assay sample intervals to ensure that a direct 
comparison can be made between results obtained from assay/geochemical analyses and 
mineralogical sampling results. 

The selected mineralogical mapping samples are given a unique sample identification number 
(ID), photographed, and sent to the core cutting area. Mineralogical mapping sampling is usually 
completed in batches, where multiple samples are selected from each hole, then cut 
sequentially. 

The half-core remaining from the previous assay sampling is quarter-split to produce the 
mineralogical sample. A portion of the quartered core is cut further to produce a pre-selected 
portion of rock for thin section field stitch analysis. The selected portion for field stitch analysis 
and the quartered core are each placed in separate bags, and identified by the same 
mineralogical mapping sample ID.  

For QA/QC purposes, a piece of the quartered core selected for mineralogical particle scan 
analysis is selected from the sample bag and placed in the RNC mineralogical mapping 
sampling library. 

Once a sample is placed in its plastic bag, the bag is secured with staples. Typically, seven 
sample bags are placed into a cardboard box and secured with tape. The sealed boxes remain 
secured in the Amos core logging facilities until they are shipped to the laboratory using a 
courier service. Samples are shipped at the rate of 50 to 100 samples per shipment. Blanks and 
standard samples are inserted into the sample stream at regular intervals using a sequential 
numbering scheme set up by RNC. 

The sample bag with the thin section slice is sent directly to SGS Minerals Services for thin 
section preparation and mineralogical analysis. The sample bag containing the quarter core is 
sent first to ALS Minerals' Timmins preparation laboratory for stage crushing and assaying, with 
a split shipped to SGS Minerals Services for mineralogical particle scan analysis. 

After-hours access to the core logging, core cutting and core storage facilities, as well as the 
project office, is controlled by a zoned alarm system with access restrictions based on employee 
function. 

11.1.2.2 Sample Preparation & Analysis 

Upon receipt at ALS Minerals' Timmins preparation laboratory the mineralogical samples are 
prepared according to the procedure summarized in Table 11-2.

The first 100 g split of pulverized material is sent to SGS Minerals Services where the sample is 
prepared for EXPLOMINTM particle scan mineralogy and XRF Borate Fusion assay. The results 
are forwarded to RNC and imported directly into the database. 

The other 100 g split of the pulverized material is retained by ALS Minerals for chemical 
analyses. The reject material is sent back to the RNC's Amos office for storage. The results are 
forwarded to RNC and imported directly into the database. 

11.1.2.3 Geochemical Preparation & Analysis 

Samples are analyzed at the ALS Minerals Laboratory in Vancouver, for specific gravity by gas 
pycnometer, followed by a 35-element analysis using an aqua regia digestion and ICP-AES 
finish. Where reported nickel values exceeded 10,000 ppm a second analysis is completed 
using a four acid total digestion with an ICP-AES finish. In addition, all samples are assayed for 
precious metals (gold, platinum, palladium) using a standard fire assay with an ICP-AES finish.  

Analysis results are forwarded to RNC and imported directly into the project database. 

11.1.2.4 Mineralogical Preparation & Analysis 

Procedures for EXPLOMINTM mineralogical analysis and sample preparation internal to SGS 
were provided to RNC by SGS (A. Karaca, July 26, 2010 email as personal communication). 
Relevant sections of these procedures are quoted below.  

"Upon sample receipt, the Sample Log-on technician verifies the received samples according to 
the sample list provided by RNC geologists. Any extra sample(s), discrepancies in identification, 
damage, contamination, unsuitable samples, concerns, or hazards are recorded, and RNC is 
notified. Once sample receipt is verified, samples are forwarded to the mineralogist for sample 
login and LIMS [laboratory information management system] reporting. The samples are kept in 
the same order that they appear on the documentation provided by RNC." 

"For sample tracking purposes within SGS Minerals Services, LIMS numbers are assigned to 
incoming samples. The LIMS number reflects the type of work being performed on the samples, 
the source of the samples, and secondary information such a Reference, Project, Batch, Quote, 
Link, Note, Category, Supervisor, Priority, Warning, Charge ID, Date Received, Date 
Requested." 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

11-8 

  

"When the LIMS log-in has been completed, a project file is created to hold all the paperwork 
pertaining to the project. The project file is labelled with the project number, LIMS number, and 
the Client or Company name. A log-in checklist is attached to the project file and completed. A 
chain of custody is created. Record LIMS information is recorded in Diamond 
Services/Mineralogy project list." 

"The project file is placed in a red folder and given to the Mineralogy Project Supervisor. Once 
the folder is checked by the Mineralogy Project Supervisor it is returned to Sample Login. Any 
additional information is updated in LIMS and the project list. The signed Chain of Custody is 
photocopied and the original is mailed to the client." 

"Active Mineralogy Samples are stored with labels containing the project number, LIMS number, 
and test required. All of the samples are placed in one of the LIMS numbered, large plastic 
bags, placed in the 'To Do' box. A copy of the work order accompanies the samples." 

"When all requested analyses have been completed, samples are brought to Sample Tracking 
for storage. Boxes are stored in the Sample Tracking Room in Mineralogical Services for six 
months. After six months, the box is inventoried and the mineralogist is contacted for further 
instructions." 

11.1.2.5 Sample Preparation 

"Using a binocular microscope, the Mineralogist or Project Mineralogist identifies the areas of 
interests previously marked by RNC staff for thin section analysis. One polished section for 
each sample is prepared for field stitch analysis. Sections are ground and polished then coated 
with carbon for analysis." 

"Crushed samples that are received later on from ALS Minerals are first riffle-split into two parts 
(of ~125 g), one for mineralogy and one for assay. Each sample is potted in moulds and the 
necessary amount of resin and hardener is added. The moulds are placed into the pressure 
vessel and left under pressure for five hours. The moulds are then labelled and backfilled with 
resin. Then they are placed in the oven. The sections are ground and polished followed by 
carbon coating." 

11.1.2.6 QEMSCAN Operation 

"The block holder is loaded with the samples. Measurement parameters (for core samples, field 
scan mode with 10 µm resolution and for crushed samples, PMA mode with 3 µm resolution) 
are set up. Stage Set-Up, Focus Calibration, Beam optimization and BSE Calibration are 
performed at the start of each run. After the runs are completed, the daily quality checks are 
performed as summarized in Table 11-3. Weekly calibration and checks are also performed to 
verify the following:  Stage Initialization, Tilt Check, Rotation Check, X-Ray Detector Check, Gun 
Set-up, Brightness and Contrast, Filaments and Vacuum. The detectors are checked every 
three months." 

"The QEMSCAN Data Validation report includes a measurement validation table and an assay 
reconciliation chart. QEMSCAN data are compared to externally measured chemical assay data 
to ensure measurement accuracy. Minerals are double-checked optically. A technical check is 
performed on all data by a senior mineralogist."

11.1.2.7 Control Samples 

As a part of SGS Minerals Services standard QA/QC procedures for QEMSCAN analysis, a 
standard sample is run every week. There are currently three standard samples from different 
projects that are cycled each time. One of the standards used is a RNC data validation sample. 

As part of RNC's QA/QC procedures for geochemical assays, a set of control samples 
comprised of a blank and standard reference material sample, are inserted sequentially into the 
sample stream. The cut mineralogical samples along with the inserted control samples are then 
shipped to the ALS Minerals for stage crushing and chemical analysis. The standard reference 
materials and blanks used are analogous to those described previously with the exception that 
the frequency of insertion is increased to approximately one in every 15 samples. 

11.1.3 Mini Pilot Plant Sampling 

PQ core metallurgical domain composite samples are selected based on nickel deportment, 
grade and alteration of the rocks as determined through assays and mineralogical sampling of 
an NQ pilot hole drilled at the sampling location. A 1.5 m PQ drilling grid was established around 
each NQ pilot hole to plan multiple PQ holes on the same site in order to accommodate the 
sample volume required (approximately 1,800 kg per domain sample) while maintaining domain 
sample uniformity. As a result of the hole proximity and the inherent difficulty and cost of PQ 
drilling in overburden, a percussion water well-drilling rig was employed to drive casing into 
bedrock for the multiple holes required on each of the sites. Once casing was seated in 
bedrock, the diamond drill returned to drill the PQ core domain samples. 

Four locations were chosen, 10-RNC-216 to -218 and 10-RNC-222. Figure 11.2 shows the 
location of each of the holes along the length of the deposit.

The sampling method for PQ core is identical to that described previously up to and including 
the geotechnical logging, after which the procedure is different. After geotechnical logging, the 
core is thoroughly cleaned to remove any drilling additives that may interfere with the 
metallurgical testwork. The PQ core is then checked for comparability to the pilot hole, by 
comparing lithological contacts, mineralization, alteration, and structural features. The core is 
then logged for lithology, and metallurgical domain composite samples are delineated which 
reflect those established in the pilot NQ hole. The core is then photographed and placed in 
short-term indoor storage to await sampling. After-hours access to the core logging, core cutting 
and core storage facilities, as well as the project office, is controlled by a zoned alarm system 
with access restrictions based on employee function. 

The PQ sampling program is supervised by an independent qualified engineer provided by 
Stavibel Inc. (Stavibel) to ensure quality control of the sampling method and to certify chain of 
custody. The rock is weighed and transferred by domain sample from the core boxes directly 
into 200 L plastic barrels fitted with Schrader valves. The domain samples are kept separate 
and barrels are filled in sequential order. A barrel typically holds from 250 to 270 kg of rock. The 
engineer seals the full barrel and places a numbered tag on the closure to prevent or identify 
any possible tampering. The barrels are purged with nitrogen to prevent oxidation and 
degradation of the rock while the sample awaits metallurgical testwork.

When the sample is required by RNC's metallurgical group, the barrels are shipped directly via 
road freight to the mini pilot plant in Thetford Mines, Quebec. 

11.1.4 Electron Microprobe Sampling 

Polished sections from the mineralogical mapping program from locations throughout the 
Dumont deposit (as described in Section 11.1.2) were selected to quantify the variability of 
nickel content in key minerals of interest by electron microprobe analysis. 

RNC contracted SGS Minerals Services to conduct a detailed electron microprobe analyses on 
these samples which were already in storage at SGS Minerals Services facilities. SGS 
subcontracted the analyses to facilities at McGill and Laval University. The McGill University 
Electron Microprobe Microanalytical Facility is equipped with a JEOL 8900 instrument while the 
Laval Microanalysis Laboratory is equipped with a CAMECA SX-100. Machine calibrations, 
replicates and all results passed internal QA/QC procedures used at the facilities and checks as 
prescribed by SGS Minerals Services.  

To further supplement this work in 2012, RNC contracted the Xstrata Process Support (XPS) 
Mineral Science Laboratory. XPS completed additional quantitative compositional mineral 
analysis using a Cameca SX-100 electron microprobe. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) 
produces higher electron beam currents and increased beam stability, coupled with higher 
resolution wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS) to produce mineral composition data 
down to ppm levels. All standard calibrations and QA/QC checks were completed in accordance 
to XPS Standards and Procedures. 

11.1.5 Metallurgical Variability Sample Selection 

The metallurgical variability samples were collected from various locations in the deposit as 
shown in Figure 11.3.  

These metallurgical variability samples were chosen to cover the variability in mineralogy and 
composition across the deposit. Samples were collected in drill holes distributed to be spatially 
representative both along strike, and across dip (stratigraphy) of the deposit. The major 
variables examined were nickel grade, nickel deportment, liberation, grain size, association and 
fibre content. Testwork was completed on 105 individual metallurgical domain composite 
samples. Testwork includes both metallurgical lab scale recovery tests as well as mineralogical 
analysis by QEMSCAN and assay.  

Continuous domain samples were assembled along the continuous length of the drill holes as 
shown in Figure 11.4. Each of the samples defined a homogeneous domain as characterized by 
nickel grade, nickel deportment, mineralization grain size and alteration. Any change in these 
characteristics led to the start of a new sample.

11.1.6 Comminution Sampling 

An extensive grindability study was performed on 102 samples from the Dumont deposit. Two 
types of samples were provided for the testwork, 92 half-NQ and 10 full PQ core samples, 
corresponding to variability and drop-weight samples, respectively.  

11.1.6.1 Sampling Selection 

The 92 half-NQ and 10 full PQ core samples have been selected from previously drilled and 
stored core by RNC. Samples were selected throughout the feasibility pit shell and considered: 

• preliminary hardness domains (as indicated from point load testing corresponding to olivine, 
serpentine, coalingite and faulted domains); 

• nickel deportment; and 

• distribution throughout feasibility payback shell. 

All selected samples are contained within the mineralization envelope to target mineralized 
dunite of various grades and mineralization types. Half of the selected 92 half-NQ samples (45) 
were chosen inside the feasibility payback shell. The remaining 47 samples were evenly 
distributed through the remaining volume of the mineralized envelope within the feasibility pit 
shell. Selected drill hole intersections were chosen to represent the range of mineralogical and 
chemical variations with focus on those factors which seem to affect point load strength index 
(PLSI). 

11.1.6.2 Sample Preparation 

Several shipments of drill core were shipped to the SGS Minerals Lakefield, Ontario site from 
January to March 2011. The 10 full PQ drill core samples were prepared as shown in 
Figure 11.5. 

These samples underwent the following tests: 

• Bond Low-energy Impact Test (CWi); 

• Drop-weight Test (DWT); 

• SMC Test (SMC); 

• Bond Rod Mill Grindability Test (RWi); 

• Bond Ball Mill Grindability Test (BWI); 

• Bond Abrasion Test (Ai); 

• Rheological Characterization; and 

• Mineralogical Characterization. 

The 92 half-NQ drill core samples were submitted for the same suite of tests with the exception 
of the Bond low-energy impact test and the drop-weight test. The preparation of the 92 half-NQ 
drill core samples is shown in Figure 11.6. Three samples selected by RNC were submitted for 
full rheology benchmark testing in order to establish testing criteria that would be applied to the 
89 remaining samples.

11.1.6.4 Head Assays 

The samples were analysed for nickel, sulphur, iron and major elements (Whole Rock Analysis). 
The iron determinations were performed using two methods, Borate Fusion-XRF (Whole Rock 
Analysis) and Pyrosulphate Fusion -XRF.  

Comminution, rheology and mineralogy results are summarized fully in Section 13 of this report. 

11.1.7 Environmental Geochemistry Sampling 

11.1.7.1 Sampling for Laboratory Testwork 

The objectives of the geochemical characterization program are to:  (1) classify mine waste 
according to Québec Directive 019 sur l'Industrie Minière (Directive 019) for waste management 
planning, (2) identify chemicals of potential environmental interest in the framework of future 
mine site water quality and possible water treatment requirements during mine operation, and 
(3) access the pit lake water quality in an in-pit tailings deposition scenario after mining 
operations cease. Sampling methodology and analytical procedures are described below. 
Program design and results are described in Section 20 of this Technical Report. 

The phase 1 environmental geochemistry program (GENIVAR, 2010) was completed by 
GENIVAR in 2009. Samples were selected by one engineer and one geologist of GENIVAR with 
the help of one geologist of RNC. A total of 21 waste rock samples (three gabbro, ten peridotite, 
five dunite, two feldspar porphyry and one basalt) were selected for ABA and leaching tests. Six 
samples from the mineral deposit representing the low (three samples) and the high (three 
samples) nickel grades were also sent for acid-base accounting (ABA) and leaching tests. In

addition, three tailings samples were selected for environmental testing. Five samples of 
different lithologies and grades (waste:  peridotite and dunite, ore:  low- and high-grade, tailings) 
were selected for humidity cell tests. Finally, a composite sample of mineralized rock (low- and 
high-grade) was created from five different samples for the Meteoric Water Mobility Procedure 
(MWMP) test.  

For the phase 2 environmental geochemistry program (Golder, 2013) in 2011, rock samples 
were collected by RNC staff supervised by an RNC geologist according to a sampling scheme 
devised by Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder). A total of 93 samples of core from waste rock areas 
were collected from existing core of previously drilled exploration boreholes. Samples were 
collected throughout the deposit and mostly outside the ore shell but within or near the 
anticipated open pit. Each rock sample consisting of 3 to 5 kg of core was collected over an 
interval of approximately 5 to 10 m, and some sub-samples were collected at regular intervals of 
approximately 1 m. Each sample was checked against its log description in terms of rock type, 
alteration, and staining associated with sulphide mineral oxidation. A consistent sample 
collection procedure was applied for all rock samples. Each sample was bagged individually to 
avoid cross-contamination and was labelled with the unique sample identification number. 
Metallurgical processing wastes (equivalent to tailings) generated at an off-site processing 
facility were retained for geo-environmental analysis. The tailings were generated from 
composite samples of ore collected by RNC from each of the main mineralization types 
including alloy ore, sulphide ore and mixed ore. Three samples of tailings and three samples of 
associated process water were collected, packaged and shipped to the laboratory by RNC for 
analysis.  

For the phase 3 environmental geochemistry program (Golder, 2013) in 2012, five more 
metallurgical processing wastes (equivalent to tailings) were generated from composite samples 
collected by RNC. The five composite tailings samples are representative of the five 
metallurgical ore types as described in the previous technical report (Ausenco 2012). The 
composite tailings samples and three samples of associated process water were collected, 
packaged and shipped to Maxxam Analytics Inc. (Maxxam) in Montréal by RNC for the similar 
static analysis complimenting the phase 2 program., In addition to the Maxxam work, three 
metallurgical processing wastes (equivalent to tailings) were generated from a composite of low-
grade, non-sulphide ore, by the RNC team, and, packed and shipped by RNC to SGS Mineral 
Services for analysis. The purpose of these analyses was to assess the potential pit lake water 
quality in an in-pit tailings deposition scenario after mining is complete. 

11.1.7.2 Analytical Methods for Laboratory Testwork (Maxxam) 

The static tests completed on mine waste solids are consistent with those recommended by 
Directive 019 and include acid-base accounting (ABA), chemical composition (whole rock and 
trace element), and leaching tests (TCLP, SPLP, CTEU9). 

ARD Potential 

The potential of geologic materials to generate acid rock drainage (ARD) was evaluated through 
acid-base accounting (ABA) following Québec Method MA.110-ACISOL 1.0. This test includes 
the determination of the following parameters: 

• total sulphur by LECO furnace and Acid Potential (AP) calculated based on total sulphur 
content  

• Neutralization Potential (NP) (following Québec Method MA.110-ACISOL 1.0). 

The values of AP and NP are reported as kg equivalent calcium carbonate (CaCO3) per tonne 
of rock.

Neutralization Potential (NP) 

NP is a bulk measurement of the acid-buffering capacity of a sample provided by various 
minerals of different reactivities and effective neutralization capacity. It is measured by digestion 
of a pulverized portion of the sample using a strong acid. This process consumes all minerals 
affected by the acid, including minerals that may not normally be reactive under ambient 
conditions and minerals that would not neutralize to pH-neutral conditions (such as silicate 
minerals. This method can overestimate effective NP. 

Acid Potential (AP) 

The potential of a material to generate acid (acid potential or AP) is calculated from the total 
sulphur content of the sample in equivalent calcium carbonate (CaCO3). AP is a theoretical 
value that represents the maximum potential acidity that can be generated by sulphur-bearing 
minerals in a rock sample assuming that all sulphur is present as pyrite and is available to 
oxidize completely. This method is generally found to overestimate the AP because total sulphur 
includes non-reactive sulphur minerals such as sulphates and certain sulphides. 

Chemical Composition 

The chemical composition of the samples was determined through whole rock and trace 
element analyses. Major element composition was determined through whole rock analysis by 
borate fusion and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Trace element composition was determined 
through the CEAEQ Method MA200 Mét 1.2 (Québec, 2010). 

Metal Leaching Potential 

Various short-term leach tests are used to determine the potential of the waste to release 
readily-soluble metals to the receiving environment. The leach tests performed follow Québec 
Method MA.100-Lix.com.1.0. They are summarized in Table 11-4 and described below. 

11.1.7.3 Analytical Methods for Laboratory Testwork (SGS) 

The following analysis/assays were completed to understand the chemical diffusion and transfer 
interaction between low-grade tailings and process water in the overlying water column:  
dissolved metals, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, acidity, PO4, Br, Cl, F, NO3, SO4, and Cr(VI).

11.1.7.4 Sampling for In-Situ Experimental Cells 

In-situ Low-Grade Ore Cell 

A bulk sample of mineralized serpentinized dunite weighing 110 tonnes was collected from 
outcrop for inclusion in an in-situ experimental environmental characterization cell constructed 
on the Dumont property. The outcrop was cleared of glacial overburden with an excavator and 
power washed. The area identified for sampling was then drilled and blasted to a depth of 
approximately 1.5 m. 

The sample was loaded into a dump truck and transported immediately to the in-situ cell site 
and deposited directly into the in-situ cell.  

In-Situ Tailings Cell 

 A composite sample of tailings produced from the miniplant, weighing 3 tonnes, was prepared 
for deposition in an in-situ experimental environmental characterization cell constructed on the 
Dumont property. 

The tailings were produced from the miniplant operation from August 2010 to June 2011. The 
source of the material was from the PQ Domain Composites 218BDF, 218G, 218H, 218I, 
222AC, 217B and 216ABC. Both the slimes, fluff and rougher (non-mag) tails produced from the 
miniplant were used. The slimes had been stored as a low density slurry, the fluff was dry and 
the rougher tails were a wet filter cake.  

The tailings samples was loaded into a cement truck, mixed thoroughly, transported 
immediately to the in-situ cell site and deposited directly at approximately 50% solids into the in-
situ cell. 

11.1.8 Chrysotile Quantification Sampling 

A logging program to quantify the bulk chrysotile content of dunite and peridotite from the 
Dumont deposit was completed from January to March 2013 (Cloutier et al., 2013). The 
program consisted of detailed drill hole logging using half NQ core drilled and previously 
sampled for the resource definition program. Thirteen drill holes were selected to represent the 
dunite and peridotite lithologies based on representative lithological, spatial, structural, and 
metallurgical characteristics. RNC geologists created a standard logging procedure specifically 
for chrysotile to ensure consistency and reproducibility of results. This method has been 
validated by independent external experts (Verschelden and Jourdain, 2013; Gauthier, 2013) 
and provides reproducible and quantifiable results. Sample locations and results are described 
in Section 9.5. 

11.2 Quality Assurance & Quality Control Programs 
Quality assurance and quality control programs are typically set in place to ensure the reliability 
and trustworthiness of exploration data. They include written field procedures and independent 
verifications of aspects such as drilling, surveying, sampling and assaying, data management 
and database integrity. Appropriate documentation of quality control measures and regular 
analysis of quality control data are important as a safeguard for project data and form the basis 
for the quality assurance program implemented during exploration. 

Analytical control measures typically involve internal and external laboratory control measures 
used to monitor the precision and accuracy of sampling, sample preparation and assaying. They 
are also important to prevent sample mix-up and to monitor the voluntary or inadvertent 
contamination of samples. Assaying protocols typically involve regular duplicate and replicate 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

11-21 

  

assays and the insertion of quality control samples to monitor the reliability of assaying results 
throughout the sampling and assaying procedures. Check assaying is typically performed as an 
additional reliability test of assaying results. Check assaying involves re-assaying a set number 
of rejects and pulps at a secondary umpire laboratory. 

RNC has implemented external analytical control measures since commencing their drilling 
programs at the Dumont Nickel project in 2007 (Lewis and San Martin, 2010). Analytical control 
measures consist of the insertion of quality control samples (field blanks, field duplicates and 
certified reference material samples) in all sample batches submitted for assaying. In addition 
check assaying to an umpire laboratory was conducted. RNC began regularly inserting quality 
control samples beginning with drill hole 07-RN-04 (Lewis and San Martin, 2010), the fourth 
hole drilled by RNC on the Dumont Nickel project. 

Field blanks consist of local esker sand and generally range in grade between 0.003 and 0.008 
percent nickel (Lewis and San Martin, 2010), with an acceptable upper limit of 0.01% of nickel. 
Field duplicates consist of quarter core. 

RNC used four certified control samples sourced from Ore Research & Exploration Pty Ltd. 
(ORE) of Victoria, Australia:  OREAS 13P, OREAS 14P, OREAS 70P and OREAS 72A. OREAS 
13P and OREAS 14P were replaced by OREAS 70P and OREAS 72A in 2008, as they were 
considered to be unrepresentative of the expected rock type and nickel grades (Lewis and San 
Martin, 2010). 

OREAS 13P and OREAS 14P are both certified for copper, gold, nickel, palladium and platinum 
values. OREAS 70P is certified for a range of precious and base metals, and major and 
lithophile trace elements. OREAS 72A is certified for aluminium oxide, arsenic, chromium, 
cobalt, copper, gold, iron, magnesium oxide, nickel, palladium, platinum, silicon dioxide and 
sulphur. The certified nickel content of the reference material used on the project and the 
number of times they were assayed by the primary laboratory is presented in Table 11-5. 

A certified reference material sample, a blank or a field duplicate sample were inserted into the 
sample stream at a rate of one every twenty-five samples (Lewis and San Martin, 2010). 

Table 11-5:  Specifications of Certified Reference Material Used by RNC between 2007 & 2012 

Reference Material  Source Ni (%) Std. Dev. (%) No. of Samples 
OREAS 13P ORE 0.204 0.0115 1,090 
OREAS 14P ORE 2.090 0.0700 159 
OREAS 70P ORE 0.244 0.0193 2,162 
OREAS 72A ORE 0.693 0.0250 243 

 
Prior to June 1, 2008 all pulps prepared by Laboratoire Expert Inc. (Laboratoire Expert) were re-
assayed at ALS Chemex Laboratory in Val-d'Or, Quebec (ALS). Since 1 June 2008, 5% of the 
pulps from ALS are randomly selected and re-assayed at Laboratoire Expert (Lewis and San 
Martin, 2010). Since June 2011, AGAT Laboratories Ltd. (AGAT Laboratories) in Mississauga is 
used as umpire laboratory.  

Analytical control measures for magnetite as part of the EXPLOMINTM study involved replicate 
and duplicate analyzes by SGS Canada Inc. (SGS). Replicate analyzes consisted of re-plotting 
another sub-sample and re-running the analysis by QEMSCAN (Quantitative Evaluation of 
Materials by Scanning Electron Microscopy) for each replicate. The results show the 
reproducibility between sub-samples (including machine reproducibility). Duplicate analyzes

consisted of analyzing the same block or polished section again, a second time. The results 
show the reproducibility of the system or equipment used. However, each time a block or 
polished section is re-analyzed, a different area on the block or polished section is scanned (i.e. 
not the exact same particles are scanned). Therefore, the original analyse can never be 
completely duplicated because the particles within the scanned areas may change due to slight 
movements in the stage and when setting up the analysis. Analytical control measures were 
performed on 5% of the EXPLOMINTM study.  

In 2012, upon recommendation from SRK Consulting, RNC had SGS Mineral Services complete 
153 Satmagan tests to independently validate the magnetite mineral abundances reported as 
part of the EXPLOMINTM mineral mapping program. Satmagan results of the EXPLOMINTM 
samples were used to validate the mineral mass percent of magnetite reported by QEMSCAN. 
Satmagan infers magnetite content by measuring magnetic susceptibility (Fe3O4 percent). 
Satmagan values (or recoverable Fe) can be compared and calibrated with Davis Tube Results. 
Figure 11.8 on the following page summarizes the Satmagan tests and compares the results to 
the magnetite mineral abundances reported by EXPLOMINTM results. Satmagan was performed 
on 10% of the EXPLOMINTM study. 

11.3 SRK Comments 
In the opinion of SRK, the sampling preparation, security and analytical procedures used by 
RNC are consistent with and often exceed generally accepted industry best practices.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Site Visit 
In accordance with NI 43-101 guidelines, Sébastien Bernier from SRK visited the Dumont 
project between April 27 and May 2, 2011 accompanied by John Korczak, P.Geo; on May 17, 
2013 he was accompanied by Robert Cloutier, Geo., OGQ both from RNC. The purpose of the 
site visit was to ascertain the geological setting of the project, witness the extent of exploration 
work carried out on the property, and assess logistical aspects and other constraints relating to 
conducting exploration work in this area. 

All aspects that could materially impact the mineral resource evaluation reported herein were 
reviewed with RNC staff. SRK was given full access to all relevant project data. SRK was able 
to interview exploration staff to ascertain exploration procedures and protocols. 

Borehole collars are clearly marked with metal stakes inscribed with the borehole number on a 
metal plate. No discrepancies were found between the location, numbering, or orientation of the 
boreholes verified in the field plans and the database examined by SRK. 

The site visit was undertaken during active drilling and SRK examined core from numerous 
boreholes being processed in the core facility. SRK examined and relogged the nickel 
mineralized zone from Borehole 11-RN-242. SRK also collected verification samples from this 
borehole for independent assaying (see below). 

On June 21, 2012, Sébastien Bernier and Oy Leuangthong from SRK accompanied by John 
Korczak and Michelle Sciortino from RNC visited the SGS facilities in Lakefield (Ontario) where 
EXPLOMINTM samples are processed and analysed.  

Full details of data verification completed by SRK and summarized herein are included in 
Bernier and Leuangthong (2013), which is available on RNC's website. 

12.2 Database Verifications 
Exploration data collected by RNC are incorporated directly into a CAE Mining Fusion database 
using electronic files only. Data collected by the logging geologists are recorded electronically 
into DHLogger, within the Fusion database management system. Samples tags are 
automatically and electronically generated by DHLogger. Both DHLogger and Fusion software 
are equipped with a series of rigorous internal checks that prevent entry errors, including 
duplications and missing intervals that may occur during logging and/or importing of assay data 
received electronically from the laboratory. 

During the site visit, SRK reviewed and verified the logging procedures with several logging 
geologists. SRK also performed a series of statistical tests on the database as part of the 
mineral resource estimation process. No errors were found. SRK is of the opinion that the 
database is acceptable and sufficiently reliable for mineral resource estimation. 

12.3 Verifications of Analytical Quality Control Data 
RNC made available to SRK analytical control data as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets containing 
the assay results for the quality control samples (field blanks, field duplicates, certified reference 
material, check assays and replicate and duplicate analyses for the EXPLOMINTM study).

SRK aggregated the assay results for the external quality control samples for further analysis. 
Eight variables were examined:  calcium, cobalt, chromium, iron, nickel, palladium, platinum and 
sulphur, and specific gravity. Sample blanks and certified reference materials data were 
summarized on time series plots to highlight the performance of the control samples. Field 
duplicate, check assay, and replicate and duplicate analyses (as part of the EXPLOMINTM 
study) (paired) data were analyzed using bias charts, quantile-quantile and relative precision 
plots. The analytical quality control data produced by RNC from 2007 to 2011 for the Dumont 
Nickel project are summarized in Table 12-1 and presented in graphical form (per element and 
per year) in Bernier and Leuangthong (2013), which is available on RNC's website. 

SRK reports only cobalt, magnetite, nickel, palladium and platinum in the mineral resource 
statement; however, calcium, chromium, iron and sulphur were also modelled because of their 
correlation with nickel recovery. Although only cobalt, magnetite, nickel, palladium and platinum 
are discussed here, the comparative charts for all elements and minerals are included in Bernier 
and Leuangthong (2013), which is available on RNC's website for completion.  

The external analytical quality control data produced for this project represents approximately 
12% of the total number of samples submitted for assaying (Table 12-1).

There are a number of field blanks above the acceptable upper limit of 0.01% nickel. However, 
SRK notes that this comprises approximately 2% of the total field blanks. Overall, the average 
value is approximately 0.0038%, indicating that the esker sand used as a blank is not barren in 
nickel, but sufficiently low for the purpose they are intended.  

The field blank is not characterized for cobalt, palladium, or platinum. The cobalt mean of the 
blank samples is approximately 5 ppm (which is above the detection limit of 2 ppm for 
Laboratoire Expert and 1 ppm for ALS), indicating that the blank is also not barren in cobalt. 
Considering the average cobalt grade (at 0% cobalt cut-off) of the deposit is 105 ppm, the blank 
used is acceptable for cobalt.

The mean for palladium and platinum for the blank samples is less than the detection limit 
(2 ppm for Laboratoire Expert and 0.001 ppm palladium and 0.005 ppm platinum for ALS). 

SRK notes that the blanks analyzed by Expert between 2007 and 2008 have higher means for 
cobalt, nickel, palladium, and platinum than the blanks analysed by ALS.  

The time series plots for field blanks also show a high percentage of spikes above the mean 
(Bernier and Leuangthong, 2013).  

OREAS 13P, OREAS 72A, and OREAS 14P control samples generally display mean grades 
lower than the expected nickel values. In particular, mean nickel grades for OREAS 13P deviate 
the most from the expected nickel value with approximately 91% of nickel assays below two 
standard deviations of the expected value. The exact cause for the poor performance of OREAS 
13P is difficult to ascertain by SRK retrospectively. This should be investigated by RNC. 

OREAS 13P and OREAS 14P control samples generally performed as expected for palladium 
and platinum, although between approximately 7% and 29% of samples plot outside of two 
standard deviations. OREAS 13P and OREAS 14P are not certified for cobalt. 

OREAS 72A samples generally display mean grades close to two standard deviations from the 
expected value for cobalt. The exact cause for poor performance of OREAS 72A is difficult to 
ascertain by SRK retrospectively, but should be investigated by RNC. 

Palladium and platinum performed within the expected ranges, although the mean grades were 
slightly below the expected value for OREAS 72A. Less than 7% and 2% of platinum and 
palladium samples plot outside of two standard deviations, respectively. 

OREAS 70P generally performed within the expected range for nickel and cobalt. The nickel 
mean is slightly above the expected value, whereas for cobalt the mean is slightly less than the 
expected value. Cobalt had less than 1% and nickel had less than 2% outside of two standard 
deviations. 

The mean palladium value for OREAS 70P is below the expected value and less than 1% 
spiked above the expected value. Platinum values are consistently above the expected range, 
which is below detection limit, for OREAS 70P, but with less than 2% above the detection limit. 

Duplicate assay (paired) data analyzed by SRK show that assay results for cobalt and nickel 
can be reasonably reproduced by ALS from the same pulp. Rank half absolute difference 
(HARD) plots for cobalt and nickel show more than 95% of the field duplicate samples have 
HARD below 10% (Bernier and Leuangthong, 2013). This is expected from re-assaying the 
same pulp. HARD plots for palladium show between 51% and approximately 61% of the 
duplicate samples have HARD below 10%. HARD plots for platinum show between 55% to 
approximately 58% have HARD below 10%.  

Check assay (paired) data for nickel analyzed by Laboratoire Expert between 2007 and 2009 
generally agree with ALS results (see Bernier and Leuangthong, 2013). For samples assayed in 
2010, and in particular 2011, SRK notes that there are significant departures between the two 
laboratories with Laboratoire Expert yielding consistently lower nickel in the 0.1% and 0.3% 
nickel grade range (see Bernier and Leuangthong, 2013). Further, there appears to be a gap 
between 0.2% and 0.3% nickel returned by Laboratoire Expert. Laboratoire Expert assay results 
are only used as checks and were not considered for resource estimation. It is difficult to 
analyze retrospectively the variance with the Laboratoire Expert check assay results, which is

not accredited. SRK has recommended that RNC further investigates this discrepancy between 
ALS and Laboratoire Expert and change the umpire laboratory to an accredited facility. 

In June 2011, RNC changed the umpire laboratory to AGAT Laboratories in Mississauga. 
Paired data for check assays show that assay results analysed by AGAT Laboratories generally 
agree with ALS results for cobalt and nickel with HARD plots showing more than 95% of the 
check assays have HARD below 10% (Bernier and Leuangthong, 2013). Check assay results 
since 2011 confirm that ALS results are not biased and are reliable. HARD plots for palladium 
and platinum show that 47% and 56% of the check assays have HARD below 10%, 
respectively. No check assays were sent to AGAT during February to December, 2012 because 
no resource boreholes were completed during this period.  

A total of 78 replicate and 13 duplicate samples analyzed for magnetite as part of the 
EXPLOMINTM study were analyzed by SRK. The replicate analysis show reasonable 
reproducibility between subsamples and the duplicate analysis show reasonable reproducibility 
of the machine. HARD plots for magnetite show that 56% of the replicate analyses and 100% of 
the duplicate analyses have HARD below 10% (Bernier and Leuangthong, 2013). The lower 
percentage value of the replicate analyses may indicate a nugget effect of the magnetite 
particles. The Satmagan data show reasonable reproducibility with the QEMSCAN data with 
70% of the samples having HARD below 10%. 

Overall, SRK considers that analytical quality control data reviewed by SRK suggest that the 
assay results delivered by the primary laboratory used by RNC are sufficiently reliable for the 
purpose of mineral resource estimation. Other than indicated above, the data sets examined by 
SRK do not present obvious evidence of analytical bias. 

12.4 Independent Verification Sampling 
As part of the verification process, SRK collected eighteen verification samples during the site 
visit completed between April 27 and May 2, 2011. The verification samples replicate RNC 
sample intervals from Borehole 11-RN-242 drilled in 2011. The verification samples comprise of 
NQ quarter core and were sent to AGAT Laboratories in Mississauga in May 2011 for 
preparation and assaying. AGAT Laboratories is accredited to Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 
standards for specific testing procedures by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) and the 
Canadian Association for Laboratory Accreditation Inc. (CALA), including those used to assay 
the samples submitted by SRK (four acid digestion using inductively coupled plasma-optical 
emission spectroscopy). 

Table 12-2 on the following page shows the comparative assay results for the verification 
samples. The assay certificate for the SRK samples is included in Bernier and Leuangthong 
(2013), which is available on RNC's website. The verification samples (paired data) were also 
analyzed using bias charts, quantile-quantile and relative precision plots. The verification 
samples show that for nickel, sulphur and specific gravity, ALS results can be reasonably 
reproduced by AGAT. HARD plots show 89% for nickel, 72% for sulphur and 100% for specific 
gravity, have HARD below 10%.  

Such a small sample collection cannot be considered representative to verify the nickel grades 
obtained by RNC. The purpose of the verification sampling was solely to confirm that there is 
nickel mineralization and verify that SRK can reproduce nickel grades for the sample intervals 
independently chosen by SRK.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING & METALLURGICAL TESTING 

13.1 Introduction 
The objective of the feasibility metallurgical study was to quantify the metallurgical response of 
the Dumont ultramafic nickel mineralization. The program was designed to develop the 
parameters for process design criteria for ore flow characteristics, comminution, desliming, 
flotation, and dewatering in the processing plant.  

The metallurgical program was conducted by Centre de Technologie Minérale et de Plasturgie 
Inc (CTMP), Mineral Solutions, SGS Mineral Services (SGS) and RNC metallurgical staff. 

The metallurgical program was performed on the following composites and samples: 

• metallurgical variability samples; 

• mineralization composites (sulphide, alloy and mixed); 

• metallurgical domain composite samples; 

• outcrop sample; and 

• grindability samples. 

The samples were selected to represent the spatial distribution, ore grade and mineralization 
types of the Dumont deposit.  

Ninety-two grindability samples were submitted to SGS to complete a suite of grinding 
characterization tests including Bond ball work index (BWi), Bond rod work index (RWi), SMC 
test, and abrasion index (Ai). In addition to these 92 samples, 10 additional samples were 
added from the PQ variability samples to complete crusher work index (CWi) and JK Drop 
Weight Tests (JK DWT). 

Flotation and magnetic separation studies were performed from 2008-2009. This work 
generated the standard test procedure (STP) which was used to establish metallurgical domains 
and recovery variability throughout the deposit. 

Further optimization work was conducted on the mineralization composites and the PQ 
variability samples to optimize reagent consumption, flowsheet design and complete locked 
cycle tests to assess cleaning recovery.  

13.2 Previous Testwork 
Several rounds of testing have been undertaken at various laboratories prior to the current 
phase of study. A summary of the programs and results are described below.  

13.2.1 Historical Testwork 1971-1972 

In 1971 and 1972, Centre de Recherches Minérales, Ste-Foy, Quebec (CRM) conducted a 
laboratory testwork program on drill core samples from the main zone at the request of Dumont 
Nickel. The following details have been extracted from a report (Caron, 2004) that used the 
information contained in the metallurgical section of the historical Caron, DuFour and Seguin 
(CDS) feasibility study (Caron, 1972).

13-2 

  

The CRM metallurgical testwork resulted in the development of a concentration process 
consisting of grinding, flotation and magnetic separation. Locked-cycle tests were conducted on 
drill core composite samples. 

In the report, Caron considered that the process described in the CDS study would yield a 48% 
nickel recovery in a concentrate grading approximately 20% nickel.  

13.2.2 Preliminary Metallurgical Testwork 2007-2008 

Preliminary metallurgical testwork was undertaken in 2007 and early 2008 by RNC. The focus 
was a conventional wet grind to very fine P80 of 53 µm, followed by flotation and magnetic 
separation. The brucite and chrysotile in the feed caused significant viscosity issues and pasting 
during grinding. A relatively complex and expensive reagent scheme was developed to attempt 
to reduce the viscosity and achieve acceptable metallurgy.  

In late 2008, the metallurgical program shifted direction, concentrating on pre-treatment of the 
mineralization by first removing chrysotile in a dry defibring step followed by removal of brucite 
in a wet desliming stage in an effort to reduce the pulp viscosity and simplify the reagent 
scheme. The pulp viscosities decreased significantly to improve nickel recoveries and 
concentrate grades in the magnetic separation and flotation processing that followed. Testwork 
was completed on ten complete hole composites that were taken from across the deposit and 
represented the variability observed from the mineralogy. A rigorous standard test procedure 
was developed. Thirty-two different samples were then evaluated with the STP and used to 
define both the recovery equations for the three ore types in the orebody.  

13.2.2.1 Dry Crushing & Defibring 

RNC contracted the Centre de Technologie Minérale et Plasturgie (CTMP), a crown corporation 
of the Government of Quebec with laboratories in Thetford Mines, QC, to undertake dry 
crushing, screening, and air classification testwork. 

CTMP tested these samples through the standard regime for separating and recovering 
chrysotile used in the asbestos industry in Quebec. At 841 µm (20 mesh), the separation of 
chrysotile from the granular serpentine was mostly complete and simple air classification 
removed a chrysotile product depleted of nickel. The intensity of the air classification determined 
the weight loss to the chrysotile product and the nickel loss.  

13.2.2.2 Wet Grinding & Desliming 

Testing of a dry crushed and air classified sample (chrysotile removed) still yielded pulps of high 
viscosity, which continued to interfere with grinding and flotation. CTMP was successful in stage 
grinding these products with concurrent desliming in hydrocyclones. The desliming was thought 
to remove the interstitial brucite which was liberated in grinding and was the principal cause of 
the high pulp viscosities. CTMP first ground the coarse air classification underflow (U/F) to 80% 
minus 150 µm (100 mesh) and deslimed in a hydrocyclone. The hydrocyclone overflow (O/F) 
was discarded. The coarse, free flowing U/F was sent to a low intensity wet magnetic separator 
for awaruite and magnetite recovery. The non-magnetics ground to 80% minus 74 µm (200 
mesh) and the ground pulp again deslimed in hydrocyclones to remove the brucite slime 
liberated in the second grind. The second stage desliming U/F was again treated on the 
magnetic separator to scavenge any remaining awaruite and magnetite liberated in the second 
stage grinding. The non-magnetics were sent to conditioning for flotation. This procedure gave 
consistently low viscosity pulp for flotation.

Recovery of awaruite and magnetite was excellent in the two rougher magnetic separation 
stages at grades averaging 1% nickel but as high as 3% nickel and 40% to 50% iron. awaruite 
recoveries averaged about 80%. Further work on cleaning these awaruite rougher concentrates 
was deferred until development of the standard test procedure was complete. 

It was determined to control the wet desliming to a target mass loss of approximately 5% for 
each stage resulting in nickel losses of less than 4% per stage. No improvements in pulp 
viscosity were observed for higher mass losses but nickel losses increased significantly.  

13.2.2.3 Flotation Testwork  

Flotation testwork was completed on defibred and deslimed composite by Lang and Liu at SGS, 
Marois at CTMP and Marois, Liang and Lang at CTMP in 2008. The purpose of the testwork 
was to test if defibring and desliming prior to flotation would allow simplifying of the reagent 
scheme and reductions in reagent consumption and costs yielding equivalent or better 
recoveries and concentrate nickel grades. 

The standard test procedure was finalized in May 2009. It consisted of the staged grind 
described in Section 13.2.2.2, with each grind and deslime followed by incremental timed 
flotation tests. 

13.2.2.4 Comminution Testwork 

Point load tests on hundreds of samples in the RNC core shack in Amos had reduced the 
number of primary ore types in term of their breakage and hardness characteristics to four: 

• Domain 1 – Samples from the relict olivine zone;  

• Domain 2 – Samples from the coalingite zone;  

• Domain 3 – Samples from the black competent serpentinite; and 

• Domain 4 – Samples from fault zones with strong alteration. 

The four domain samples were sent to Hazen Research in Denver, Colorado to have full JK 
DWT, SMC test, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests performed.  

The data in Tables 13-1 to 13-3 are summarized from the Hazen report (Gillespie, 2010).

13.2.3 Pre-feasibility Study (PFS) 

During the pre-feasibility data collection phase, both laboratory and mini-plant work were 
completed. The mini-plant was a 20 to 30 kg/h continuous plant that emulated the lab rougher 
circuit (crushing, defibring, wet grinding, desliming, flotation and magnetic separation). The 
crushing and defibring were batch processes, while the wet grinding through magnetic 
separation was continuous and operated at 20 to 30 kg/h depending on the campaign. 

The mini-plant was initially commissioned to add additional confidence to the rougher recovery 
seen in the laboratory STP results. The feed to the mini-plant was from the four PQ holes that 
were drilled along the length of the deposit to provide greater quantities of material per domain 
sample than the laboratory scale tests.  

The mini-plant also generated higher quantities of rougher concentrate (both flotation and 
magnetic concentrates) to allow initial cleaning circuit design work. 

The laboratory work focused on grindability testing, variability analysis (STP), cleaning 
recoveries and flowsheet optimization. Much of this work is discussed fully in the feasibility test 
results section as the feasibility work built on this base. The testwork performed during the PFS 
modified the flowsheet significantly from a dry crushing- defibring circuit assumed in the 2010 
Preliminary Economic Analysis (PEA). The following section provides a summary of the 
testwork that led to the decision to eliminate the dry circuit and move forward in the PFS with a 
SAG, Ball Mill and desliming circuit. 

13.2.3.1 Elimination of Defibring 

In the 2010 PEA, the base case assumption for the flowsheet was a dry crushing circuit with 
defibring followed by a wet ball mill and desliming. Initially the defibring was introduced to 
remove the chrysotile fibres which were causing matting and viscosity issues in flotation. 
However, even with the introduction of defibring, viscosity problems were still evident in the ball 
mill discharge/flotation feed so a desliming step was introduced. At this point it was still 
assumed that a very fine grind of 53 µm was required to achieve maximum nickel recovery.  

The results of the STP tests show that the majority of the nickel floated after the 150 µm 
(100 mesh) grind. Further grinding, while increasing mass recovery to the concentrate, did not 
significantly increase the recoverable nickel in the concentrate. With this coarser grind, it was 
decided that desliming and no defibring needed to be re-evaluated as part of the PFS 
metallurgical program. This approach is common practice in Australian ultramafic nickel ore 
treatment. The dry crushing circuit was extremely complex with a high operating cost, as well as 
having potential health and safety concerns from dusting in the plant during the dry quaternary

crushing stages. There would be numerous advantages to proceeding with a wet grind and 
deslime circuit only and eliminating the initial dry crushing stage.  

Tests were performed on three mineralization composites (sulphide, mixed and alloy) created 
from the PQ core that was drilled for the mini-plant.  

Each composite was tested under the STP flowsheet (defibring, grinding, desliming, flotation 
and magnetic separation). The results were then compared to a grinding, desliming, flotation 
and magnetic separation flowsheet (see Table 13-4 for the results). The performance of the 
desliming without defibring was equal to or better than the STP performance for each case. In 
addition a test was performed on each with no desliming or defibring, overall the recoveries 
were similar but the rougher concentrate grade improvement was significant.  

The results from both the laboratory and mini-plant confirm that at the coarser grind, with a P80 
at or above 150 µm, defibring is not required for successful grinding and nickel flotation for any 
of the mineralization types. The most effective unit operation for improving flotation performance 
is an aggressive desliming stage to remove the fine particles that cause viscosity problems in 
the rougher stage. 

13.2.3.2 Recovery from the Fibre Portion of STP samples 

The initial 70 STP samples had defibring performed on them. The flotation of this product 
showed similar nickel recovery to the STP rougher recovery. The P80 of the fibre product is 
180 µm which is very similar to the P80 of the rougher grind.  

The size distribution of the fluff product is around 180 µm, or similar to P80 of the cyclone 
underflow after desliming. This material is not expected to report to the slimes fraction, as the 
size distribution is similar to the overall mill discharge. Tests have been performed on this 
material which showed similar recovery to the STP rougher recovery. A graph with a range of 
samples is shown below. For example the STP recovery for 222AC was 72.2%, 217B was 
52.9%, 218I was 42.3% and 216ABC was 36.4% which are similar to the recoveries shown in 
the fluff testwork shown in Figure 13.1.

13.3 Feasibility Sample Selection 

13.3.1 Comminution Samples 

Two different types of samples were selected for the comminution data collection:  92 half NQ 
core samples and 10 whole PQ core samples, for a total of 102 samples. The larger diameter 
PQ samples were chosen to complete crusher work index test as well as drop weight tests, both 
of which require core larger than 63 mm in diameter.  

75 of these samples formed the basis for the pre-feasibility study and were previously reported 
in the June 22, 2012 Dumont Technical Report. 27 samples were added to complete the dataset 
for the feasibility study. The results from all 102 samples formed the basis for the feasibility 
study. 

13.3.2 Metallurgical Feasibility Samples  

The metallurgical testwork program at CTMP and Mineral Solutions was performed on the 
following composites and samples: 

• metallurgical variability samples (STP samples); 

• PQ variability samples; 

• mineralization and metallurgical domain composites; and 

• outcrop sample. 

Information on how these samples were selected is available in Section 11. 

13.3.2.1 Mineralization Type Composites 

Three mineralization composites were generated from the PQ metallurgical variability samples. 
The following factors were considered when forming the composites: 

• spatial relationship (structural domain and depth); 

• mineralization type; and 

• Ni grade. 

In Tables 13-4 to 13-6, each individual component is listed along with the combined weight and 
grade of the composite. Once the composite was blended and crushed a sample of each was 
sent for mineralogy and assay.

material for flowsheet optimization work, specifically around the desliming circuit. The composition of each 
sample is listed below in Tables 13-7 to 13-13.

13.3.2.2 Outcrop Sample 

A bulk sample (2 to 3 tonnes) was gathered from a large outcrop in the southeast portion of the 
Dumont deposit. The area is contained within the southern extent of the pit shell. The sample is 
primarily a sulphide sample, dominated by heazlewoodite. The grade of the sample is 0.41% Ni 
and 0.15% S. The 3 tonne sample was collected from previously blasted material, crushed and 
blended to create individual charges for both mini-plant and laboratory testwork. Representative 
portions of the sample were split out and sent for QEMSCAN, STP recovery test and assay to 
characterize the sample. 

13.4 Ore Flow Characteristics 
A composite sample was sent to Jenike and Johanson (J&J) for flow testing. Eight tests were 
performed on a composite of -2,380 µm (-8 mesh) material. The composite was composed of 
samples from the grindability work that represented the various metallurgical domains from the 
Dumont deposit: 2 kg of GRO-67, 3 kg of GRO-69, 5 kg of GRO-70, 2 kg of GRO-72, 3 kg of 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

13-12 

  

GRO-74, 2 kg of GRO-76, 3 kg of GRO-78, 3 kg of GRO-88, 2 kg of GRO-90, 2 kg of Comp 2, 
3 kg of Comp 3, and 3 kg of Comp 4 were combined and blended for the work.  

The eight tests are listed below. 

• particle density; 

• compressibility; 

• loose and compacted bulk density; 

• flow function; 

• wall friction; 

• critical chute angle; and 

• frozen unconfined strength. 

The following discussion is a summary of the J&J report (Hui and Holmes, 2012).  

Samples were tested at two different moisture contents, which represented 60 and 80% 
saturation. Saturation for the Dumont material was determined to be at 17.1% moisture. Testing 
was completed at 10.2% and 13.5% moisture. This is done so that the testing reflects the 
conditions under which the ore is expected to be most difficult to handle.  

The particle density was calculated as 2.63 g/cm3 for this sample. The loose bulk density and 
compacted bulk density were 1,440 and 1,726 kg/m3, respectively.  

The material is somewhat cohesive and had the ability to form a rathole if stored in a funnel-flow 
bin. It was recommended that the material be stored in a mass flow bin with a minimum 
recommended outlet diameter of 400mm to prevent cohesive arching. The strength of the fines 
was not significantly affected by storage time at rest or the change in moisture content. 

Wall flow and chute flow tests were conducted to determine maximum wall and chute angles to 
achieve mass flow. The results varied depending on the liner material tested and time at rest 
and also demonstrated that the material is slightly sensitive to impact pressure and a low drop 
height is recommended to minimize the impact of material falling into the chute. 

The unconfined yield strength of the frozen ore increases with increasing moisture contents and 
there is a high risk of arches forming at moistures greater than 3%.  

13.5 Comminution Circuit Characterization Testwork 
The testing consisted of both grindability testwork to characterize the competency, hardness 
and abrasion of the Dumont material as well as slurry rheology.  

Several shipments of drill cores were sent to SGS, Lakefield site, from January 2011 to March 
2012. Ten full PQ and 92 half NQ drill core samples were sent for testing. The ten full PQ 
samples were submitted for: 

• Bond low-energy impact Test (CWi); 

• JK Drop Weight Test (JK DWT); 

• SMC test (SMC); 

• Bond rod mill work index test (RWi); 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

13-13 

  

• Bond ball mill work index test (BWi); and 

• Bond abrasion test (Ai). 

The 92 half NQ drill core samples were submitted for the same suite of tests with the exception 
of the Bond low-energy impact test and the JK DWT. The preparation of these drill core samples 
is shown in Section 11.  

The samples submitted for Bond ball mill work index testing were also submitted for the 
ModBond test to establish the ModBond – BWi correlation parameters. 

13.5.1 Grindability Testwork Results 

The summary of the results of the grindability tests for the comminution variability samples are 
shown in Table 13-15. The feasibility design basis was based on the 102 samples, which 
includes the 75 samples previously reported in the June 22, 2012 43-101 Technical Report and 
the 27 samples that were added for the feasibility study to fill in spatial gaps in the deposit. The 
following discussion is a summary of the results from two SGS grindability reports (Verret and 
Imeson 2011 and Patsius and Imeson, 2013).

Overall, the ore depicted an increase in hardness with finer size, which is typical for many ores. 
The majority of the test results (percentile 10th to 90th), for the tests performed at coarse size (JK 
DWT and the SMC test) ranged from moderately soft to medium. At medium size (Bond rod mill 
test) the majority of the samples fell in the medium to moderately hard range. At fine size (Bond 
ball mill work index and modified Bond tests), the bulk of the test results fall within the hard to 
very hard range. The Bond low-energy impact test is the exception; the test uses the coarsest 
rocks, but the sample tested were categorized as moderately hard to hard. The relative 
standard deviation of test results within each series ranged from 5% to 19%, which is 
considered narrow in comparison to other deposits.  

The presence of fibrous material was challenging for the dry grindability tests, especially for the 
completion of the Bond ball mill test. The Bond rod mill test, with a closing screen size of 14 
mesh, was not affected by the fibres. This issue is common to a number of other ultramafic Ni 
deposit. Adjustments are typically made by the engineer in the interpretation of the data for mill 
selection.  

The accumulation of fibres in the plant ball mill circulating loads is not expected to pose the 
same problems that were observed with the Bond ball mill grindability tests. The plant ball mill 
circuit will be closed with hydrocyclones, and the fibres will preferably report to the cyclone 
overflow due to their low density and shape factor. 

13.5.2 SMC & JK Drop Weight Tests 

The SMC test is an abbreviated version of the standard JK DWT performed on rocks from a 
single size fraction (-22.4/+19 mm in this case). The SMC test was performed on a total of 102 
samples.  

The majority of the Axb parameters, corresponding to resistance to impact breakage, ranged 
from 63.1 (10th percentile) to 43.6 (90th percentile), and covered the moderately soft to medium 
range with the average (53.8) and median (54.6) values falling in the medium category. The 
relative density of all the samples averaged 2.57. 

The JK DWT was performed on ten samples. The data was interpreted by Contract Support 
Services (CSS), the North American agent for JKTech. The ten samples submitted for the DWT 
were also subjected to the SMC test for calibration purposes.  

The DWT samples generally fell in the soft to medium range in terms of resistance to impact 
breakage (Axb) and resistance to abrasion breakage (ta). Most of the DWT and SMC pairs were 
similar in terms of resistance to impact breakage (Axb) and relative density, while the ta 
presented more variation  

13.5.3 Bond Low-energy Impact Test & Bond Rod Mill Grindability Test 

The Bond low-energy impact test determines the Bond crusher work index (CWi), which can be 
used with Bond's Third Theory of comminution to calculate power requirements for crusher 
sizing. For each of the ten samples tested, twenty rocks in the range of 2 to 3 inches were 
shipped to Phillips Enterprises LLC for the completion of the Bond low-energy impact test. The 
average CWi was13.5 kWh/t with a range of 10 to 18 kWh/t.  

The Bond rod mill grindability tests were performed at 14 mesh of grind (1,180 µm) on the 
102 samples.

Eighty percent of the Bond Rod mill work indices (RWi) ranged from 13.7 kWh/t (10th percentile) 
to 16.3 kWh/t (90th percentile), covering the medium to moderately hard range of hardness. The 
median RWi was 14.7 kWh/t, which falls in the medium range of hardness.  

13.5.4 Bond Ball Mill Grindability Test 

The Bond ball mill grindability test (BWi) was performed with a closing screen of 177 µm (80 
mesh) on 11 samples to achieve a P80 of approximately 150 µm. 

Eighty percent of the BWi ranged from 18.3 kWh/t (10th percentile) to 22.3 kWh/t (90th 
percentile), covering the hard to very hard range of hardness. The median BWI was 20.3 kWh/t, 
falling in the hard range of hardness.  

13.5.5 ModBond Test 

The ModBond test consists of a single batch test, which is calibrated against the standard Bond 
ball mill grindability test results. The ModBond tests were calibrated at 177 µm (80 mesh). The 
ModBond tests were performed on all 102 samples.  

Eighty percent of the ModBond work index ranged from 19.5 kWh/t (10th percentile) to 
22.0 kWh/t (90th percentile), covering the hard to very hard range of hardness. The median 
ModBond work index was 20.6 kWh/t, which falls in the hard range of hardness.  

13.5.6 Bond Abrasion Test 

All the 102 samples were submitted for Bond abrasion testing. All the AI values were below 
0.090 g, except for sample 08-RN-138-GR061, which yielded an AI of 0.215 g. The median AI 
was 0.002 g. These values indicate very low abrasion for Dumont ores, typical of other 
ultramafic orebodies. 

13.6 Metallurgical Variability Test Results 
Variability samples were selected from the Dumont mineralization and underwent both rheology 
and recovery characterization testwork (STP). The rheology work was performed by SGS 
Minerals at their Lakefield site. The recovery variability testing was performed by CTMP in 
Thetford Mines. 

13.6.1 Rheology 

All of the 102 grindability samples underwent rheology testing. The samples were pulverized to -
125 µm (120 mesh) for testing. All testing was done without reagents or desliming. The 
summary information reported in this section is from the two SGS reports (Ashbury and Mezei, 
2011 and 2013). 

13.6.1.1 Rheology Benchmark Samples 

Three samples were chosen for benchmark testing (Table 13-16). The samples were picked 
based primarily on brucite and olivine content. Brucite is known to cause viscosity issues in 
slurries and olivine is a marker for degree of serpentinization, which is known to impact other 
metallurgical characteristics of the ore.  

• GR018 – 10-RN-218AC Med Brucite – Low Olivine 

• GR023 – 10-RN-216E Low Brucite – High Olivine 

• GTR027 – 10-RN-222F – High Brucite – Low Olivine.

Each of these samples underwent shear stress testing at various slurry densities. The 
pulverized sample was slurried with water to their critical solids density (CSD). CSD was defined 
as the solids density value above which a small increase of the solids density causes a 
significant decrease of the flowability. Once the CSD had been determined for each sample, the 
solids density was stepped down and the rheological behavior was re-measured. This allowed 
the rheological behavior to be characterized as a function of their solids density. 

The benchmark samples showed a variety of rheological behavior, including some extreme 
rheopexy at high percent solids on the undeslimed material. Overall, the transition towards less 
extreme rheopexy occurred with the decrease of the CSD, implying that solids content was a 
key factor influencing flowability.  

13.6.1.2 Rheology Variability Samples 

The following summarizes the results from the rheology tests (also includes the three chosen to 
be the benchmark samples), performed on the 102 grindability samples  

Twenty-seven samples displayed flow behavior comparable to Benchmark A, featuring extreme 
rheopexy, rendering their shear yield stress behavior non-measurable due to torque overload at 
the CSD. These samples displayed unsheared yield stress values ranging from 7Pa to 83 Pa, 
average 61 Pa.  

Seven samples displayed flow behavior comparable to Benchmark B, which is a transitionary 
response from moderately rheopectic to slightly thixotropic. These samples displayed 
unsheared yield stress values ranging from 46 Pa through 139 Pa, averaging 83 Pa. These 
samples displayed sheared yield stress values were 11 Pa through 390 Pa, average 249 Pa. 

Sixty-eight samples displayed flow behavior comparable to Benchmark C, featuring a high but 
measurable rheopexy response; these samples displayed unsheared yield stress values 
ranging from 30 Pa to 81 Pa, averaging 61 Pa. The corresponding sheared yield stress values 
ranged from 133 Pa to 507 Pa.  

In general, the overall rheological study substantiated that the main common characteristics of 
most of the Dumont samples, tested in 2011 and 2012, was their predominantly rheopectic 
tendency, rendering them rheologically-limited to mineral processing unit operations at typical 
mineral processing densities (greater than 35% solids in flotation) without desliming. 

To manage this issue, desliming is used to remove the slimes and fibres that tend to generate 
the high viscosity slurries and a low percent solids is used to float in both the slimes and 
rougher circuits. In addition, dispersant (Calgon) is used in both the slimes and rougher flotation. 
No sample tested to date at the laboratory scale has shown continued extreme viscosity issues 
after desliming, dispersant addition and dilution as per the design criteria used for the feasibility 
study. 

13.6.2 Variability Testing (STP Metallurgical Domain Samples) 

The initial standard test procedure (STP) was finalized in May 2009. The composites were 
prepared from drill core selected from across the deposit. The original STP procedure was 
applied to the first 83 metallurgical domain samples, and the updated procedure was applied to 
the additional 22 samples. As per the procedure, a sample of each was sent for quantitative 
mineralogy and assay. The results are summarized by mineralogy and metallurgical response 
below.

A representative sample from each of the 102 metallurgical domain samples was sent to SGS 
Mineral Services (Lakefield) for QEMSCAN quantitative mineralogical analysis.  

13.6.3 Variability Testing Results – Rougher Nickel Grade & Recovery  

Each sample was processed through either the initial STP or updated STP as described above 
to assess the variability of the metallurgical response throughout the mineralization. A summary 
of the results for each sample (listed by drill hole number) is shown below. The results from 
these samples formed the basis of the rougher recovery equations for the feasibility study. The 
rougher recovery listed in the following tables is based on the rougher recovery achieved in the 
STP including the predicted recovery from the fluff portion that was not tested as part of the 
STP. Testwork has shown that recovery from the fluff portion is similar to the STP rougher 
recovery (Section 13.2.3.2). This fluff recovery portion has been added to the base rougher 
recovery.  

The average results for each metallurgical domain are shown below in Table 13-19. Additional 
details of the STP results completed by CTMP/Mineral Solutions and summarized herein are 
available on RNC's website.

Some of the samples from the STP produced results with low concentrate grades with little 
nickel upgrading to concentrate. In ultramafic nickel deposits such as Dumont there can be 
significant levels of nickel contained within the silicates. This nickel is unrecoverable with 
flotation based techniques.  

This is especially true for the alloy (low sulphur) mineralization assemblages as defined in 
Section 7.3.1.1. Most of these low sulphur samples generated very low concentrate grades, 
high weight recoveries to concentrate and high tails assays. Table 13-20 compares the average 
result from the three mineralization assemblages from the 102 STP samples. As the sample 
moved from sulphide to alloy mineralization the rougher concentrate grade decreases, the tails 
grade increases and the recovery decreases. It is expected that lower cleaner recoveries will be 
seen with lower sulphur grades in feed, and that sulphur content is directly related to cleaning 
recovery.

The STP test uses staged grinding, long flotation times, low density flotation conditions and very 
high reagent consumption. These conditions would be extremely expensive to replicate in a full 
scale plant and optimization work was performed to demonstrate that similar grades and 
recoveries could be achieved with lower flotation times, higher densities and reduced reagent 
consumption. The results from this optimization work are presented in Section 13.7 and formed 
the basis for the FS plant design and operating cost. 

13.7 Metallurgical Optimization Results 

13.7.1 Grinding Circuit 

13.7.1.1 Single-Stage Grind 

In the initial STP tests a two-stage grind followed by a deslime, float and magnetic separation 
was performed. This was done for the first 83 samples. The second grinding stage was 
eliminated after a review of various samples under a single-stage grind to 150 µm. In 
Table 13-21, the results of comparative tests are shown. The STP test is shown for each 
samples compared with various other tests under modified flotation conditions (reagent dosage, 
desliming operation and % solids of the rougher float).

= 150 µm grind, deslime, float, magnetic separation. 

Since the results showed for each sample tested that the recovery was equal to or better than 
the STP recovery, the decision was made to continue to include the STP recovery with the two-
stage grind in the rougher recovery equations, but discontinue the two-stage grind for the plant 
flowsheet. Subsequently the STP was also modified to reflect this decision. 

13.7.1.2 Grind Size Selection 

The STP grind size was chosen as 150 µm (100 mesh). Testwork was completed to confirm this 
is the optimum size to maximize rougher nickel recovery. Tests were performed on two 
samples, the sulphide composite and 222BDE, a low recovery Hz sample. 

The results are shown below in Figure 13.4. This figure plots the flotation rougher recovery vs. 
the P80 of the sample. Both samples show a peak in flotation recovery between 130-160 µm.  

Total rougher recovery is comprised of both the flotation and magnetic recovery. Figure 13.5 
shows the total rougher recovery vs. the P80 of the sample. In general, the total nickel recovery 
is higher as the grind size gets coarser (within the size range tested). This may result from 
increased kinetics due to reduction of slimes generated during grinding. However, as the grind 
size increases, the rougher concentrate grade generally shows a decreasing trend, which may 
indicate a reduction of liberation at the coarser grind sizes (Figure 13.6). 

From this work, the grind size of 150 µm was chosen for the feasibility design basis.

13.7.2 Desliming & Rougher Flotation Optimization (including residence time) 

Desliming is a critical process step to maximize the rougher flotation performance of the Dumont 
mineralization. Without desliming the rougher is very viscous, nickel flotation kinetics are slow 
and the rougher concentrate grades are very low. 

The STP had an average of 7% mass report to the slimes fraction. This material was not floated 
as part of the STP. 

Benchmarks from other ultramafic desliming operations indicate a greater percentage of 
material will report to the slimes fraction from the closed grinding circuit. Benchmarking has 
indicated that approximately 10-20% of the nickel will report to the slimes fraction in a full-scale 
plant. Twenty percent weight recovery to the overflow (O/F) has formed the basis for the 
feasibility design. 

To understand the differences in reagent consumption and flotation performance, tests on 
several samples were conducted at various weight recovery to the slimes product. 

13.7.2.1 Outcrop Sample 

To understand the reagent consumption and performance difference between the 10% and 20% 
mass recovery to the O/F were performed on the Outcrop sample. As part of this test program 
the underflow (U/.F) was also tested. Both the overflow and underflow were floated in each test 
with different reagent dosages. Each flotation test was a kinetic test floated for 30 min, with 
incremental concentrates being removed at 1, 4, 10, 20, and 30 minutes for both the U/F and 
the O/F. This was to determine whether the reagents could be modified to increase the kinetics 
of the float as well as to determine the optimum flotation time to match the STP flotation 
recovery. Table 13-22 and 13-23 is a summary of the conditions and results for the O/F and U/F 
testing respectively at 10% Wt Recovery to O/F.

Table 13-24 and 13-25 is a summary of the conditions and results for the O/F and U/F testing 
respectively at 20% Wt Recovery to O/F. All reagents are shown as g/t O/F or U/F feed to the 
stage. 

In general the O/F tests produced relatively low-grade concentrates with little upgrading and 
high mass pull to concentrate, irrespective of either PAX or Calgon addition. The recovery and 
grade performance in the slimes flotation were better in the 20% weight pull to the O/F due to 
the presence of more recoverable nickel compared with the 10% stream. The overflow tests 
were floated at 10% solids. 

Reviewing the results, although there was variation between tests, there was little to no trends 
with regard to either xanthate or calgon addition. Increased xanthate did appear to lower the 
concentrate grade slightly, resulting from a less selective float. However increased calgon did 
not appear to increase the recovery from the slimes for this sample. Based on the results from 
this testwork, a reagent dosage of 50 g/t PAX and 100 g/t Calgon were used for the slimes 
flotation. Those reagent dosages are references in grams per tonne of feed to the slimes circuit.

Reviewing the U/F results in both sets of tests, increased xanthate did lower the concentrate 
grade, resulting from a less selective float. Increased calgon did appear to increase the recovery 
from the underflow for this sample at lower xanthate additions, but the results are not clear with 
some lower calgon additions giving the same recovery as the higher calgon additions. Based on 
the results from this testwork, a reagent dosage of 50 g/t PAX and 200 g/t Calgon were used for 
the rougher (U/F) flotation design basis. Dosages are given in g/t of U/F. 

To establish the optimum residence time split between the O/F and U/F, the kinetics of each 
were reviewed. Additional flotation time in the slimes float had much less of an impact to the 
overall grade recovery curve, compared with additional flotation time in the U/F float. Less than 
1.5% Ni recovery was added by extending the flotation time in the O/F from 10 to 20 minutes. 
This is compared to the U/F, where extending the flotation time from 20 to 30 min increased the 
recovery by over 3%. All numbers quoted above are from the 20% mass split to the O/F tests. 

The decision was made for the FS design to use a 10 min lab residence time for the O/F and 30 
minutes' lab residence for the U/F. 

Comparing this suite of testwork to the STP (shown in Table 13-26) that was performed for 60 
minutes under very different flotation conditions (1000 g/t calgon and 1200g/t CMC) gave very 
similar results to the average conditions seen in the kinetic tests, illustrating that the large 
reagent dosage used in the STP and lengthy residence times could be reduced.

13.7.2.2 Domain Composite Samples – Residence Time 

Over flow and underflow samples of the seven domain composites were tested as part of 
feasibility study data collection phase. Three different levels of weight recovery to O/F were 
tested for each composite approximately 10%, 15% and 20%. 

This work was performed to confirm the ability to reduce the laboratory residence time in the 
rougher from the 60 min STP to 30 min, with reduced reagents. 

Table 13-27 shows the kinetic results with the shorter flotation time and reduced reagent suite 
compared with the STP for each sample.

Other than Composite 5, all the rougher tails had equivalent or lower assays than the STP test, 
at a 20-minute flotation time. The kinetic tests also in general had a higher concentrate grade. 
Based on these tests and the Outcrop sample discussed in the previous section a laboratory 
flotation time of 30 minutes for the rougher flotation circuit was used for the feasibility study. 

13.7.3 Reagents 

The reagents used in the STP tests are shown below (Table 13-28). This reagent scheme was 
very expensive; specifically Calgon (sodium hexametaphosphate) and carboxy-methyl cellulose 
(CMC) dosages are very high. Large dosages of these dispersants are known to slow flotation 
kinetics, which may be potentially combated by increased PAX dosage. This would explain the 
extremely slow kinetics seen in the STP tests. Further optimization testing was performed to 
identify an alternate reagent scheme could result in the same performance.

Tests performed for flowsheet optimization and the locked cycle tests have used much lower 
amounts of reagents with higher flotation densities compared to the STP.  

13.7.3.1 Rougher & O/F Reagents 

Optimization of the rougher reagents was evaluated using the Outcrop sample and the results 
were presented in Section 13.7.2.1. The results from this testwork indicated increased PAX 
caused a less selective flotation without a final increase in nickel recovery. Increased calgon did 
show some increase in recovery at lower PAX dosages. From this testwork the following 
reagents were selected as the basis for the feasibility study.

Cytec 65 is more expensive than MIBC and during the locked cycle testing led to a persistent 
froth in the cleaner circuit that was hard to control. Therefore a decision was made to reduce the 
use of Cytec 65 significantly and replace it with MIBC. The tests performed to optimize the 
rougher and O/F reagent scheme only used MIBC. 

13.7.3.2 Cleaner / Scavenger & Aw Circuit Reagents 

The cleaner reagent consumption is taken from the average of 21 locked cycle tests. This

13.7.3.3 Xanthate 

The xanthate used in the majority of the tests was KAX51, potassium is-amyl xanthate, 
considered one of the strongest and least selective collectors. Tests were conducted to 
determine whether a lower strength collector could provide higher-grade rougher concentrates 
without a recovery loss. Tests were performed on the Outcrop sample.  

A test using KAX20, potassium ethyl xanthate, which is a weaker collector, was done. The 
results are shown below on both the U/F (rougher) and O/F (slimes). These tests were 
performed with 20% of the material reporting to the O/F.

No improvement on selectivity or recovery was seen on the rougher (U/F) flotation and results 
indicate a potentially recovery loss with the weaker collector.

The slimes flotation did show an improvement in selectivity with the weaker collector. However, 
the improvement was not considered worth the addition and complication of adding a second 
collector for just this stream.  

KAX51 was chosen for the design basis of the feasibility study.

13.7.4 Regrind Size Selection 

The rougher magnetic concentrate and first sulphide cleaner tails report to a regrind mill to 
liberate any locked particles prior to sulphide scavenging and Aw flotation. 

The average grind size in the locked cycle tests was 56 µm with a range of 38 to 73 µm. 

The design basis for the feasibility study was 46 µm to account for the requirement for a finer 
size with some samples.  

13.7.5 Tailings Dewatering 

A sample of each of the seven metallurgical domain composites was sent to Outotec for 
thickener testing. This represents the range of variability throughout the Dumont deposit. The 
tests were conducted in a bench scale 100 mm diameter thickener. Flocculent screening was 
performed and Magnafloc 333 was chosen for the tests.

The ultramafic Dumont mineralization does not settle quickly and the serpentine and brucite 
content prevent traditional underflow densities of 60-65% from being achieved. 

From this testwork, 40% w/w solids was used in the feasibility study as the density achieved in 
the underflow from a high rate tailings thickener. 

13.8 Recovery Equations 
In the 2010 PEA, the rougher recovery equations were defined from 32 samples from five drill 
holes that were available at the time of the evaluation. The samples were grouped by 
mineralization type (sulphide, alloy and mixed) and by structural domain. For the 2011 PFS, an 
additional 38 samples, for a total of 70, were added to the STP suite to update the recovery 
equations. The 2012 revised PFS had an additional 13 samples processed, for a total of 83 
samples. To support the feasibility study an additional 22 samples were added for a total 105 
STP tests. 

13.8.1 Rougher Recovery Equations 

The 105 STP tests formed the basis for the rougher recovery equations. The complete assay 
and mineralogical data (QEMSCAN) were available for each of the 105 samples.  

This information was entered into Minitab statistical software program to perform multiple linear 
regression analysis on the results. Rougher recovery was used as the response. The predictor 
variables were limited to the assay data set. It was decided that the mineralogy would not be 
used in the recovery equations for the FS due to the higher confidence in the deposit assay 
model compared with the deposit mineralogical model.  

At first the regression was applied to the entire STP dataset without domaining, however the R2 
was low (shown in Figure 13.7). The resulting regression equation is shown below, as is the plot 
of actual vs. modelled recovery using this equation: 

Rougher Ni Recovery = 37.68+25*S/Ni + 0.0018*Ni ppm

To improve the regression, domaining the deposit was performed based on mineralogy.  

A review of the larger EXPLOMINTM data set (1,420 QEMSCAN mineralogy samples) showed 
that there were distinct populations of samples, either Pn-dominant or Hz-dominant with a small 
amount that fell in a mixed category between the two extremes (Figure 13.8).

seen in yellow and is generally a transition zone between the Hz dominant areas and Pn 
dominant areas.

A review of the locations of the Pn dominant samples showed two district populations:  one in 
the southern end of the mineralization (structural domain 2, 3 and 4) and the other in the 
northern end (structural domain 5 and 6).  

There were other differences within these two pentlandite populations including the degree of 
serpentinization (as evidenced by increased amounts of iron serpentine) and the nickel tenor of 
the pentlandite. In Figure 13.10, the higher iron serpentine samples from the EXPLOMINTM 
database are shown in orange and red. The majority of the high iron serpentine occurrences are 
located in structural domain 3, with an additional smaller population in structural domain 5 and 6 
to the northwest. 

The lower tenor pentlandite (shown in dark blue and black in Figure 13.11) is highly correlated 
with the areas of Fe Serpentine in both structural Domain 3 and 5. The pentlandite outside 
these areas has an average Ni tenor of 34%.

The mineralogical model abundances and electron microprobe results show that they have 
different mineralogical characteristics and this may lead to different metallurgical performance. 
This was confirmed by a review of the STP test results as shown below in Figure 13.12. 
Figure 13.12 shows a trend of lower recovery for the same head grade in the higher iron 
serpentine samples.

The samples containing over 14% iron serpentine by weight were split out and the regression 
was run separately.  

The differences in mineralogy discussed above support the generation four metallurgical 
domains for the feasibility recovery equations:  (1) Hz Dominant, (2) Mixed Sulphide, (3) Pn 
Dominant, and (4) High Iron Serpentine.

13.8.1.5 Rougher Ni Recovery Equations Summary 

Based on this analysis the final recovery equations used in the FS were as follows: 

• Hz Dominant Domain:  (FESP < 14%, Hz/Pn ≥ 5):   

Rougher NI Recovery = 18.11 + 0.0211*S + 0.00039 * Fe 

• Mixed Sulphide Domain (FESP < 14%, 1 < Hz/Pn < 5): 

Rougher Ni Recovery = 9.73 + 0.222*S + 0.0111*Ca 

• Pn Dominant Domain (FESP < 14%, Hz/Pn <=1) 

Rougher Ni Recovery = 43.6 + 0.0055* S + 0.0111* Ca 

• High Iron Serpentine Domain (FESP >=14%) 

Rougher Ni Recovery = 14.83 + 38.9*S/Ni + 0.0143* Cr 

Each equation was applied to the entire modelled resource for Structural Domains 1 to 7 on a 
block-by-block basis. 

Overall the distribution of the metallurgical domains within the FS pit shell is shown in Figure

13.8.2 Cleaning Recovery 

Several locked cycle tests were completed on different samples to assess the cleaner 
performance across a variety of feed characteristics. A summary is provided in Table 13-35. 

The cleaner recoveries in Table 13-35 for LCT Test # 4-8 do not include the contribution from 
the slimes stream. The results from LCT Test 9-17 include the contribution from the slimes 
stream. 

Cleaner recovery is highly correlated to sulphur in the feed sample, because of this the Hz 
Dominant samples, which have lower sulphur in feed for the same amount of recoverable 
minerals were separated from the other three metallurgical domains.  

The locked cycle tests of the Hz domain samples showed high cleaner recovery irrespective of 
sulphur grade in feed. The average from the four locked cycle tests for the Hz Dominant domain 
was 92%. A cleaner recovery for 90% was assumed for all Hz Dominant blocks. 

The Mixed Sulphide, Pn Dominant and Iron Serpentine Domain showed more variability in 
cleaning recovery, with lower cleaning recovery seen at low sulphur in feed. This is illustrated in 
Figure 13.22 (overleaf). 

Cleaner Ni Recovery = 0.1215 ln(%S) + 1.0959 

This equation was applied on a block-by-block basis to the Mixed Sulphide, Pn Dominant and 
Iron Serpentine domains within the resource.

13.8.3 Slimes Recovery  

Approximately 20% of the nickel in the feed reports to the slimes flotation circuit. Recovery from 
the slimes stream was not assessed in the STP. Work was conducted on several samples to 
assess recovery from the slimes and ability to upgrade to a saleable concentrate. 

The results were very variable depending on the feed material. Samples that were high in 
sulphide had better slimes recovery; samples that were higher in Awaruite had lower slimes 
recovery. Addition of a magnetic recovery stage on the slimes was evaluated, but not found to 
increase recovery. 

Cleaning of the slimes was tested as part of the locked cycle tests. The results are shown in 
Table 13-36. Additionally more samples were tested as part of the locked cycle cleaning tests.

For the purposes of the feasibility study 1.7% was added to the rougher recovery * cleaner 
recovery for each block.  

13.8.4 Overall Recovery Formula 

The overall recovery formula is as follows: 

(Rougher Recovery * Cleaner Recovery) + Slimes Recovery = Total Recovery 

To prevent over or underestimation from the linear rougher regression equations, capping was 
applied to rougher recovery on the block by block assay inputs. Any block which had higher 
assay values than maximum and minimum of the STP dataset for that domain were capped at 
the STP dataset limits.  

This reduced the average rougher recovery from 51.6% to 49.5%, a reduction of 2.1% rougher 
recovery. After these input limits were applied, rougher recovery was limited to 80%, to reflect 
the maximum recovery seen in the STP tests.  

The input sulphur assay for the cleaner recovery equation for the Pn Dominant, Mixed Sulphide 
and Iron Serpentine domain was capped to the limits of the STP data and cleaner recovery was 
limited to 95%. Neither of these caps significantly reduced the cleaner recovery. 

Finally, if the calculated overall recovery per block was greater than the theoretical recovery per 
block, the recovery was limited to the theoretical recovery to attempt to minimize extrapolation 
errors. The theoretical recovery was calculated using the modal percentages of pentlandite, 
awaruite and heazlewoodite multiplied by the respective nickel tenors of each mineral (sourced 
from the electron microprobe data), divided by the block's nickel assay. This reduced the final 
recovery from 43.3 to 42.9%. This cap was applied to 64M tonnes or 5% of the Dumont reserve. 

In aggregate the various rougher and cleaner capping reduced the deposit recovery from 45% 
to 43%.  

13.8.5 Confirmation of Flowsheet 

Locked cycle tests of samples from different domains were completed to confirm the feasibility 
plant design basis and the recovery equations. The locked cycle tests were performed at CTMP. 

Tests were performed on several samples, representing the four metallurgical domains as well 
as a range of recovery. Two datasets are presented. The first data set is from 2013 testing of 
the feasibility flowsheet, which includes 20% weight distribution to the slimes, separate slimes 
cleaning and combined rougher and combined scavenger cleaning with reagents and residence 
times as per the feasibility design basis. The second dataset is comprised of selected tests from 
2011 and 2012 locked cycle tests that had separate slimes cleaning circuits, similar floatation 
times, and 20% weight recovery to the slimes portion. 

The flowsheet for the 2013 locked cycle testing is shown in Figure 13.23.

The starting points for the study compared with the actual average used in the 2013 LCT testing 
(Table 13-37). The average reagent consumption for the 2013 locked cycle tests were less than 
the feasibility design basis, potentially indicating upside potential to the mill operating cost.

Six samples were tested in the 2013 flowsheet confirmation locked cycle testing. Testing 
focused on higher recovery samples that would be more representative of ore processed in the 
first five to six years. Three out of the four metallurgical domains (Hz Dominant, Pn Dominant 
and High Iron Serpentine) were tested, representing 90% of the material feeding the mill in the 
first five years.  

Samples from selected 2011 and 2012 locked cycle tests were selected to compare to the 
newer 2013 tests and add confidence in the robustness of the testwork. These older tests used 
a similar flowsheet but slightly longer residence times and higher reagent dosages. However, 
with the previous work performed to optimize the reagents and residence time, it is expected 
that the results would be similar. 

The overall recovery from the locked cycle tests is shown in Figure 13.24 compared to the 
recovery model used in the feasibility study. Variation around the model is shown; however, 
overall the model is adequately predicting the recovery seen in the locked cycle tests.

13.8.6 Effect of Stockpile Aging 

Over the life of the mine, 606 Mt of ore will be stockpiled and subsequently processed by the 
mill at a later time, with an average duration on the stockpile of 12 years. It is not expected that 
significant aging will take place due to the low-nickel grade, low sulphur, highly disseminated 
nature of the mineralization.  

An initial evaluation of material that was blasted in 1970 and left in a test pit on surface was 
tested under the STP (called the Outcrop Initial sample). The material behaved in a manner 
similar to freshly drilled core material (see Figure 13.25 for results). The predicted recovery from 
the rougher recovery equations (generated from fresh material) matches the laboratory test 
recovery on the aged material. 

The recovery of the sample in the STP test exceeded model predictions.

13.8.7 Byproduct Recovery 

13.8.7.1 Cobalt 

Within the Dumont deposit, cobalt is associated with the recoverable nickel minerals in the 
deposit; and similarly to nickel, it is also found in significant amounts in both serpentine and 
olivine. Consequently, the cobalt recovery is estimated to be tied to Ni recovery. 

Electron microprobe analyses were performed to quantify the variability of cobalt content (tenor) 
in key minerals of interest for samples from locations throughout the Dumont deposit. Table 13-
38 is a summary of the electron microprobe work that shows the low amount of cobalt in the 
serpentine, which makes up 92% of the mineralization. The cobalt in Serpentine is 
approximately 40 ppm on average. The overall cobalt assay in the resource is approximately 
107 ppm. Therefore the cobalt contained in the serpentine represents 30-40% of the total cobalt 
in the deposit, which is similar to the nickel deportment. It also shows that the Cobalt is tied to 
the Pn and Aw minerals.  Based on the deportment of cobalt in the recoverable minerals, Co

13.8.7.2 Platinum Group Elements 

Concentrate produced from the initial locked cycle tests was combined into two composite 
samples to generate enough material for PGE measurement (labelled CA02195 and CA02469 
in the table below). The remainder of the concentrates from the various locked cycle tests were 
sent individually to understand the variability of PGM recovery from different metallurgical 
domains as well as different S, Pt, and Pd assays in the feed. The concentrate samples were 
sent to SGS Mineral Services (Lakefield) for assay. The concentrate assay and recovery are 
shown in Table 13-39. 

The calculated recoveries shown in Table 13-40 have some degree of error associated with 
them due to the low feed assays and inability to assay the tail samples (under the detection 
limit). The Pn Dominant, Mixed Sulphide, and Fe Serp domains generally show higher Pt and 
Pd recoveries and higher concentrations in concentrate than the Hz Dominant domain.

In the block model for Hz Dominant blocks, an estimate of 50% Pt recovery and 36% Pd 
recovery were used. In the block model for Pn Dominant, Mixed Sulphide and High Iron 
Serpentine blocks, an estimate of 67% Pt recovery and 69% Pd recovery were used. These 
values reflect 70% of the lab recovery. The calculated Pt + Pd g/t in concentrate from these 
recoveries over the life of the project is 4.3 g/t, which is less than seen in the average of the 
locked cycle test concentrates.   

13.8.8 Concentrate Quality 

The concentrate from both the open circuit cleaning optimization tests and the locked cycle tests 
was composited and sent for assay to SGS Mineral Services (Lakefield) in several batches to 
analyse for impurity and PGE concentrations. Table 13-41 summarizes the results.

Note:  *N/A = no analysis was performed 

The concentrate grades from the additional locked cycle tests were also reviewed. Additional 
electron microprobe data showed that the Pn in the High Fe SP area had an average Ni tenor of 
26%.  

For the FS the following concentrate grades were assumed for each metallurgical domain, 
based on the microprobe analysis summarized in Section 7 and the locked cycle tests. 

• Hz Dominant Domain:  (FESP < 14%, Hz/Pn ≥ 5):  35% Ni 

• Mixed Sulphide Domain (FESP < 14%, 1 < Hz/Pn < 5):  35% Ni 

• Pn Dominant Domain (FESP < 14%, Hz/Pn <=1):  30% Ni 

• High Fe Serpentine Domain (FESP >=14%):  20% Ni 

Based on these results the average life of project concentrate grade is 29% Ni, with a range of 
22% to 33%. 

Other impurities—such as As, Pb, Cl, and P—were all near or below detection limits in the 
measured samples. Zn was less than 0.05%, with the exception of CA02499-OCT11, which 
assayed 0.23% zinc.

13.8.9 Concentrate Transportation Criteria 

Two samples of Dumont nickel concentrate were submitted for self-heating tests. To generate 
enough sample for testing the concentrate used for testing was a composite formed from the 
various locked cycle tests. One concentrate was Hz dominant and the other was Pn dominant. 
The following is a summary of the results from the Nesset report (Nesset, J.E., and Rosenblum, 
F., 2012). 

The Dumont Ni concentrate samples do not exhibit any self-heating behaviour having Stage A 
and Stage B SCH values of 0.0 J/g. These results are not typical for a nickel concentrate. 
However they are expected due to the lack of pyrrhotite or pyrite contained in the Dumont 
concentrates. 

13.8.10 Concentrate Chrysotile Content 

No mineralogical analysis has quantified the amount of chrysotile in the concentrate. Although 
the goal of the Dumont nickel recovery process is to reject waste gangue (primarily serpentine) 
to the tailings stream, there is a still a portion of the concentrate that is made up of serpentine. 

The range of serpentine in concentrate is expected to be approximately 20-25% by weight. 
Based on quantitative testing of the core, on average less than 2% of the serpentine in the ore 
is chrysotile.  

Therefore is can be expected that the chrysotile content of the concentrate will be less than 1% 
and likely in the range of 0.4-0.5%. 

Testing of concentrates from the locked cycle tests is recommended to confirm this value. 
Concentrate will be shipped from the site as a wet filter cake in closed containers; there is no 
risk of concentrate or chrysotile dispersion to the atmosphere during normal road or rail 
transport.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 

14.1 Introduction 
SRK was retained by RNC to update the mineral resource estimate for the Dumont nickel 
project located near Amos, Québec. The Dumont nickel project is an undeveloped, large low-
grade nickel deposit amenable to open pit mining. The nickel mineralization occurs in a complex 
assemblage of magmatic sulphides hosted in the dunite subzone of the Archean Dumont 
layered mafic intrusion. 

In February 2011, RNC commissioned SRK to prepare a Mineral Resource Statement to 
support a preliminary feasibility study prepared by Ausenco Solutions Canada Inc. (Ausenco, 
2011). An updated preliminary feasibility study was subsequently prepared considering drilling 
information available to February 1, 2012 and the recoverable magnetite data as of 8 May 2012 
(Ausenco, 2012). The updated preliminary feasibility study was published by Ausenco on 22 
June 2012. 

This section summarizes an updated mineral resource model prepared by SRK to include new 
drilling information available to December 31, 2012. This revised model was used to support the 
feasibility study. The mineral resource evaluation work discussed herein represents the fourth 
Mineral Resource Statement prepared for this project, the third by SRK. The Mineral Resource 
Statement includes the second disclosure of palladium and platinum grade and magnetite 
concentrations.  

The mineral resources reported herein consider drilling information available to 31 December 
2012, and were evaluated using a geostatistical block modelling approach constrained by seven 
sulphide mineralization wireframes. The mineral resources have been estimated in conformity 
with CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Estimation Best Practices Guidelines and are 
classified according to CIM Standard Definition for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves 
(November 2010) guidelines. The Mineral Resource Statement is reported in accordance with 
Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101. 

The construction of the mineral resource model was a collaborative effort between RNC and 
SRK personnel. The construction of the three-dimensional resource domains was completed by 
RNC personnel and reviewed by SRK. Most of the resource evaluation work was completed by 
Mr. Sébastien Bernier, P.Geo (OGQ#1034, APGO#1847). Dr. Oy Leuangthong, P.Eng 
(APEGA#82746, PEO#90563867), assisted Mr. Bernier with the geostatistical analysis, 
variography, and the selection of resource estimation parameters. The open pit optimization 
work to test the "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement for a mineral 
resource was completed by RNC personnel and by Mr. Anton Von Wiellingh, P.Eng, a mining 
engineer independent of RNC and SRK. The mineral resources are reported relative to an 
updated conceptual pit shell. Finally, this assignment benefited from the senior review of Mr. 
Glen Cole, P.Geo (APGO#1416), and Dr. Jean-Francois Couture, P.Geo (OGQ#1106, 
APGO#0197). 

By virtue of their education, relevant project experiences, and affiliation to a recognized 
professional association, Mr. Bernier and Dr. Leuangthong are Qualified Persons independent 
of RNC for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101. 

The block model was classified using criteria similar to that used for the preparation of the May 
2012 Mineral Resource Statement (based on nickel cut-off grade, consideration of borehole

spacing, the CAE Mining Studio 3 Mineable Reserve Optimizer application, and a final manual 
smoothing to ensure the continuity of similar class blocks). The final classification for nickel was 
applied to cobalt, palladium, and platinum. The mineral resource classification applied to 
magnetite follows the same sampling spacing approach as for nickel, in which three nearby 
boreholes are required within a radius of 120 m and 240 m for Indicated and Inferred categories, 
respectively. In the case of nickel, a radius of 60 m was required for Measured classification.  

To ensure that only relevant platinum and palladium values are reported any values below or 
equal twice the assay detection limit for palladium and platinum were set to zero for the mineral 
resource estimation.  

The Mineral Resource Statement for the Dumont project presented in Table 14-1 is reported at 
a cut-off grade of 0.15% nickel assuming a nickel price of US$9.00 per pound and an average 
recovery of 40%. The statement includes all classified blocks above the cut-off grade inside the 
conceptual open pit shells.

palladium, platinum and magnetite are not considered in the cut-off grade calculation as they are byproducts of recovered nickel. All 
figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. The Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified 
to produce Mineral Reserves. 

Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have a demonstrated economic viability. 
There is no certainty that all or any part of the mineral resources will be converted into mineral 
reserves. SRK is unaware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-
economic, marketing, political, or other relevant issues that may materially affect the mineral 
resources.  

The following sections summarize the data, methodology, parameters, and validation 
considered by SRK in estimating the mineral resources for the Dumont nickel project. Two 
models were constructed an elements model for 8 elements (calcium, cobalt, chromium, iron,

nickel, palladium, platinum, and sulphur) and specific gravity and a minerals model for the 
distribution of ten minerals (awaruite, brucite, coalingite, high iron serpentine, heazlewoodite, 
serpentine, low-iron serpentine, magnetite, olivine and pentlandite). The mineral model was 
constructed to support ongoing metallurgical studies. 

Full details of the data, methodology, parameters, assumptions, and validation considered and 
performed by SRK and summarized herein are included in Bernier and Leuangthong (2013), 
which is available on RNC's website. 

14.2 Estimation Methodology 

14.2.1 Resource Database, Preparation & Compositing 

Exploration data available to evaluate the mineral resources include surface NQ core drilling 
information collected by RNC since 2007. The database includes 440 core boreholes (161,703 
metres), and 90,967 assay samples. A total of 35 main elements are available for consideration. 
After discussions with RNC, SRK focussed on modelling the spatial distribution of eight main 
elements:  calcium, cobalt, chromium, iron, nickel, palladium, platinum, and sulphur; and 
specific gravity. 

For the minerals model, RNC provided a total of 1,561 EXPLOMINTM data for the ten minerals 
(awaruite, brucite, coalingite, heazlewoodite, serpentine, low-iron serpentine, iron-rich 
serpentine, magnetite, olivine, and pentlandite), with approximately 74% of these data located 
within Domains 3, 4, and 5. 1,420 EXPLOMINTM data points occurred within the mineralized 
domains and were used to inform the mineral model. 

This section describes the resource domains used to constrain the estimation model, the 
available assays for analysis, compositing methodology, and the treatment of outliers for 
subsequent modelling. In addition, specific gravity data and its consideration in this resource 
estimate are also discussed. 

14.2.1.1 Mineralized Domains & Geological Modelling 

The geological interpretation and modelling of the deposit was performed by RNC staff, and 
delivered to SRK in the form of mineralization wireframes for use in constraining the resource 
estimation. SRK understands that RNC used a structural (fault) model, developed by Itasca 
Consulting in 2010 (Fedorowich, 2010) and updated in 2012 (Fedorowich, 2012), in conjunction 
with the definition of geological contacts and grade distribution defined by drilling, to construct 
several mineralized envelopes corresponding to structural domains. The fault model was 
reviewed and updated by SRK in 2011 (SRK, 2011), and the mineralized wireframes were 
updated accordingly. The structural model was revised at the end of 2012 by Itasca to reflect 
the drilling information acquired in 2012. Relative to those used in the previous resource model 
constructed by SRK in 2012, these mineralized envelopes are almost identical with minor 
differences at the boundary between domains and the dunite contact. Table 14-2 shows a 
comparison of wireframe volumes by domain. Most of the differences are due to modelling 
refinement at depth. 

These envelopes were used to constrain the resource block model. Seven separate solids were 
generated (see Figure 14.1). The seven contiguous solids do not overlap spatially and are 
broadly constrained by a 0.20% nickel cut-off grade. SRK reviewed and confirmed that the 
majority of assays within the dunite subzone contain a minimum of 0.20% nickel.

14.2.1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis & Compositing 

The original assay data within the seven domains were extracted for statistical analysis, 
providing a total of 90,967 assay intervals for consideration, 69,478 of which intersect the 
resource domains. More than 99% of all samples were collected at intervals of 1.5 metres or 
less (Figure 14.2).  

Given the large extent of this deposit and the anticipated block model vertical dimension of 15 
metres (see Section 14.2.3), assay intervals were composited to a modal 7.5 metres downhole. 
Although unsampled assay intervals are rare in the data set, SRK assigned a detection limit 
value (Table 14-3) prior to compositing. Lost core intervals through fault zones were assigned 
an absent value.

considering all domains together and each domain separately. Summary plots were generated 
to facilitate this analysis; see Figure 14.3 for an example plot for nickel in Domain 3.  

SRK performed capping analysis by examining histograms, probability plots and assessing the 
sensitivity of the mean grade to prospective cap values. This was performed on a by domain 
basis.  

Figure 14.3 shows an example of the plots used to assess capping values for percent nickel in 
Domain 3. Bernier and Leuangthong (2013), which is available on RNC's website, shows similar 
capping sensitivity plots for all other elements within each domain. The chosen capping values 
are given in Table 14-4.

14.2.1.3 Specific Gravity 

Specific gravity measurements were made at the ALS Chemex Laboratory (ALS) in Vancouver 
(Canada) using a pycnometer on the pulp material as part of the routine assaying procedures. 
The specific gravity database contains 51,934 measurements. Missing intervals were assigned 
the average specific gravity value of that particular domain; as summarized in Table 14-6.

Given the dense sampling of specific gravity available for the Dumont deposit, SRK decided to 
populate the block model with specific gravity values using geostatistical estimation. As a result, 
SRK estimated nine variables (eight main elements and specific gravity) for each of the seven 
domains. 

The next sections describe the spatial analysis and estimation parameters used to construct the 
three-dimensional block model for these nine variables. 

14.2.2 Variography 

SRK evaluated the spatial distribution of nine elements using a variogram and a correlogram for 
each element and its normal score transform. A total of four spatial metrics were considered to 
infer the correlation structure of each element for use in the grade estimation. Continuity

directions were assessed based on the orientation of the wireframes, composites and the 
spatial distribution of the element. Further, variogram calculation considered sensitivities on 
orientation angles prior to finalizing the correlation orientation. All variogram analysis and 
modelling was performed using the Geostatistical Software Library (GSLib; Deutsch and 
Journal, 1998).  

Variogram modelling was based on the combination of the four metrics, and in almost all cases, 
the correlogram of the main element yielded reasonably clear continuity structures that are 
amenable to variogram fitting. 

For Domains 3, 4 and 5, variograms were calculated and modelled on a domain basis, using all 
capped composites within that particular domain. Relative to these three domains, the 
remaining four domains have considerably fewer composites leading to unreliability in the 
spatial correlation model. For these four domains (1, 2, 6 and 7), the variograms for each 
domain were considered separately and generally resulted in poor variogram inference.  

SRK also assessed variograms for the combined Domains 1 and 2 since they are adjacent to 
each other; this yielded reasonable variograms to reliably infer a spatial model. A similar 
strategy was applied for Domains 6 and 7. 

The modelled variograms used for the estimation of all elements (including specific gravity) for 
each domain are presented and illustrated in Bernier and Leuangthong (2013), which is 
available on RNC's website. Figure 14.4 shows an example of the correlogram calculated and 
modelled for nickel in Domain 3.

model while the dashed lines correspond to the experimental variogram in those same directions. Source:  SRK. 

 

14.2.3 Block Model & Grade Estimation 

A block model was generated using CAE Mining Studio 3 software. In collaboration with RNC, 
SRK chose a block size of 20 by 20 by 15 metres after considering the borehole spacing, the 
extents of the modelled mineralization envelopes, and the anticipated open pit mining methods. 
The model was not rotated. SRK does not expect that adding a local grid would improve the 
accuracy or the precision of the mineral resource model. Subcells were used to honour the 
geometry of the modelled mineralization, but were subsequently recombined into the parent cell 
dimensions for open pit optimization. Subcells were assigned the same grade as the parent cell.

The block model coordinates are based on the local UTM coordinate grid (NAD83 datum, Zone 
17). The definition of the Dumont block model is presented in Table 14-7.

14.2.3.1 Estimation Strategy for Main Elements 

Table 14-8 summarizes the general parameters used for the grade estimation. In all cases, 
grade estimation was based on ordinary kriging using three passes, with the first pass as the 
most restrictive in terms of search radii and number of boreholes required. Successive passes 
usually populated areas with less dense drilling, thus the corresponding parameters were 
relaxed with generally larger search radii and more relaxed data requirements.

SRK assessed the sensitivity of the nickel block estimates to estimation parameters such as 
minimum and maximum number of data. Results from these studies showed that the model is 
relatively insensitive to increases in the maximum number of composites informing a block. For 
the first estimation pass, composites from at least three boreholes were necessary to estimate a 
block. This pass also used the octant search option. For subsequent passes the criteria were 
relaxed. In all cases, the search radii were chosen to reflect variogram continuity structure, 
ranges, and orientation. Bernier and Leuangthong (2013), which is available on RNC's website 
provides a complete listing of the specific search ranges per variable by domain and by 
estimation pass.  

Table 14-9 provides statistics on the percentage of the block model filled by estimation pass on 
the basis of the nickel block model.

14.2.3.2 Estimation of Mineral Abundances 

To facilitate RNC's ongoing evaluation of metallurgical recovery, SRK also constructed 
estimation models of mineral abundances. Specifically, SRK modelled the abundance 
distribution of awaruite, brucite, coalingite, heazlewoodite, serpentine, low-iron serpentine, iron-
rich serpentine, magnetite, olivine, and pentlandite. Mineral abundances may affect the 
metallurgical recovery, and thus may have a direct impact on project economics. 

For this mineral model, a total of 1,420 EXPLOMINTM samples occur within the mineralized 
envelope for the nine minerals, with approximately 74% of these data located within Domains 3, 
4, and 5. In light of the estimation algorithms sensitivity study completed for the last resource 
model in 2012, SRK applied ordinary kriging to model all mineral abundances. SRK checked the 
distributions of the block models with the declustered, change-of-support corrected distributions 
of the EXPLOMINTM data to verify the reasonableness of the statistics of the final block model. 

Bernier and Leuangthong (2013), which is available on RNC's website, provides details related 
to the variography of the mineral abundance model, the estimation parameters, preparation of 
the final model delivered to RNC, and the quantitative comparisons performed by SRK. 

14.2.4 Resource Model Validation  

To validate the block estimates, SRK constructed parallel estimation models for nickel using an 
inverse distance (power of two) estimator as an alternate estimation method. SRK visually 
compared the results against the ordinary kriging model and found similar trends in both

models. SRK also checked that the global quantities and average percent nickel grade from 
each method are reasonably comparable. The global estimated values were also checked 
against the declustered mean grade (Bernier and Leuangthong, 2013), which is available on 
RNC's website. 

For the 2011 resource model (Ausenco, 2011), SRK also constructed geostatistical simulation 
models for nickel, iron, sulphur, calcium, cobalt, chromium, and specific gravity. At that time, 
these simulation models were used to check against the estimation model results. Specifically, 
the global grade-tonnage curves from each of the 100 simulation models were calculated 
(unconstrained by pit shells) and within domains, and compared against those obtained from the 
estimation model. The comparison showed that the 2011 estimation model did a reasonable job 
of honouring the scale differences between the informing composites and the resultant block 
model. 

Geostatistical simulation models were not reconstructed using this latest database; however, 
SRK deems that the model parameters and general input information for the 2012 resource 
model did not change appreciably. As such, SRK expects that this latest estimation model 
should compare just as well against a simulation model. 

The mineral abundance models were also validated by constructing a series of parallel 
estimation models using an inverse distance (power of two) estimator as an alternate estimation 
method. SRK visually compared the results against the ordinary kriging model and found similar 
trends in both models. SRK also checked that the global quantities and average estimated value 
from each method are reasonably comparable. The global estimated values were also checked 
against the declustered mean (Bernier and Leuangthong, 2013), which is available on RNC's 
website. 

14.2.5 Mineral Resource Classification 

In early 2011, SRK completed a study on the optimum borehole spacing to be considered for 
the resource classification. The study considered the classification of resources in the presence 
of grade uncertainty, which was assessed via geostatistical simulation. The scope of the study 
was limited to Domains 3, 4, and 5 and was performed for nickel only, with a borehole database 
and wireframes that were current up to December 6, 2010. The study was based solely on 
grade uncertainty and did not consider uncertainties related to the quantity and quality of the 
exploration database, sample collection procedures, or the confidence in the geological 
interpretation. The results of the study showed that, depending on the domain, a borehole 
spacing of 40 to 60 metres may be reasonable to classify Measured mineral resources, and a 
borehole spacing of 110 to 140 metres may be reasonable for Indicated mineral resources. 
Most of the drilling completed since this 2011 study consists of infill drilling on 50 metres or 100 
metres sections. SRK considers the results of this study still valid and appropriate for resource 
classification. 

Using the results of borehole spacing study, SRK developed a four-step approach to 
classification:   

1. Identify blocks that satisfy specified borehole spacing criteria, requiring a minimum of two 
boreholes to be within: 

− 60 x 60 m borehole spacing for Measured 

− 120 x 120 m borehole spacing for Indicated 

− 240 x 240 m borehole spacing for Inferred. 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

14-13 

  

2. Use CAE Mining Studio 3's Mineable Reserve Optimizer (MRO) module to ensure practical 
continuity of blocks assigned a given category, particularly for those classified in Step 1 as 
Measured. The following MRO parameters were specified: 

− Five percent maximum amount of material of a different class allowed for an envelope to 
be created 

− Search is constrained to only existing blocks 

− Minimum envelop size of 100 x 100 x 90 m, which approximates a nominal mass of 
2.5 Mt 

− Minimum increment of the envelope by one block of 20 x 20 x 15 m. 

3. Visualize MRO envelopes to ensure continuity of Measured blocks and tagging of blocks 
based on MRO results. 

4. Manual smoothing of block classification to avoid isolation of individual cells in areas of 
predominantly different class. Isolated blocks are reclassified to the classification of 
surrounding blocks. 

The methodology described above was used to classify nickel and was applied to cobalt, 
palladium, and platinum. The same approach was used for magnetite but the borehole spacing 
requirements were adjusted to map blocks coded with a minimum of three boreholes as 
described in Step 1 above. SRK ran some sensitivities related to increasing the number of 
boreholes found within the distance criterion, and found that specifying three boreholes yielded 
reasonable regions for classification purposes. This more restrictive criterion accounts for the 
uncertainty associated with the sparser database used to estimate magnetite, compared to that 
available for the estimation of nickel, cobalt, palladium, and platinum. Magnetite was only 
reported where nickel, cobalt, palladium, and platinum were reported. 

14.3 Preparation of Mineral Resource Statement 
CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (November 2010) 
defines a mineral resource as: 

"[A] concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid 
fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or 
on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and 
continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge".  
 

The "reasonable prospects for economic extraction" requirement generally implies that the 
quantity and grade estimates meet certain economic thresholds and that the mineral resources 
are reported at an appropriate cut-off grade that takes into account extraction scenarios and 
processing recoveries. SRK considers that the nickel mineralization at the Dumont project is 
amenable to open pit extraction. In order to satisfy the "reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction," SRK is comfortable with reporting as mineral resource those classified blocks that 
are above the cut-off grade and fall within the extents of conceptual pit envelopes. 

RNC conceptual pit shells (von Wielligh, 2013) were provided by Mr. Anton Von Wielligh, a 
mining engineer independent of RNC and SRK. The Mineral Resource Statement reported 
herein was prepared using a pit envelope developed with the 2012 mineral resource model. The 
optimization parameters used by Mr. Anton Von Wielligh are provided in Table 14-10. The 
reader is cautioned that the results from the pit optimization are used solely for testing the

"reasonable prospects for economic extraction" by an open pit and do not represent an 
economic study as is required to evaluate mineral reserves.

SRK considers blocks located within a conceptual pit shell to be amenable for open pit 
extraction (Figure 14.5) and can be reported as an open pit mineral resource.

14.4 Mineral Resource Statement 
Mineral resources were classified according to CIM Standard Definition for Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves (November 2010) guidelines by Mr. Sébastien Bernier, P.Geo 
(OGQ#1034, APGO#1847), an appropriate independent Qualified Person for the purpose of 
National Instrument 43-101. The mineral resources for the Dumont nickel project are reported at 
a cut-off grade of 0.15% nickel. The Mineral Resource Statement for the Dumont nickel project 
is summarized in Table 14-11. 

The mineral resources are sensitive to the selection of reporting cut-off grade. To illustrate this 
sensitivity, the block model quantities and grade estimates are shown at various cut-off grades 
in Table 14-12 for Measured, Indicated and Inferred mineral resources. The reader is cautioned 
that these figures should not be misconstrued as a Mineral Resource Statement. The reported 
quantities and grades are only presented to illustrate the sensitivity of the resource model to the 
selection of a cut-off grade. The grade-tonnage curve is shown in Figure 14.6.

Proven Reserves are based on Measured Resources included within run-of-mine (ROM) mill feed. Probable Reserves 
are based on Measured Resources included within stockpile mill feed plus Indicated Resources included in both ROM 
and stockpile mill feed. All figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. 

Reserves were prepared under the direction of David A. Warren, Eng., Principle Consultant - 
Mining with Snowden Mining Industry Consultants, based on the mineral resource block model 
described in the previous Section. Reserves are estimated within an engineered pit design 
which is based upon a Lerchs-Grossmann (LG) optimized pit shell generated using a nickel 
price of US$5.58/lb, which is 62% of the long-term forecast of US$9.00/lb and include mining 
losses of 0.28% and dilution of 0.49%. 

The proven reserves are based on measured resources included within run of mine (ROM) mill 
feed. Probable Reserves are based on Measured Resources included within stockpile mill feed 
plus Indicated Resources included in both ROM and stockpile mill feed. All figures are rounded 
to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. 

In addition to Ni, Co, Pt and Pd, Dumont reserves contain 39.9 Mt of potentially economic 
magnetite.

15.2 Reserve Estimation Process 

15.2.1 Summary 

The reserve estimate uses the mineral resource block model that has been described in Section 
14. The process of estimating reserves can be summarized as follows: 

• The feasibility study (FS) mine design was initiated in Q2 2012, using the resource block 
model produced for the revised PFS that was published in Q2 2012. This model included the 
estimated content of the economic metals nickel, cobalt, platinum and palladium. The 
resource block model also included the estimated recovery of each economic metal to 
concentrate, and associated grade of Ni concentrate that would be produced, on a block-by-
block basis.  

• The net smelter return (NSR) for each block was calculated from the estimated content and 
recovery of economic metals and RNC's forecast of commercial terms (including long-term 
metal prices, exchange rate, percentage payables, and treatment and refining charges). 

• The LG algorithm was used to define the theoretical ultimate pit shell for a nickel price of 
US$9.00/lb, as well as nested shells produced using lower nickel prices. The various nested 
shells were evaluated using a techno-economic model. The selection of a shell to use as the 
basis for the FS mine plan (and thus, reserve statement) was based on several factors, which 
included the incremental profit generated. The selection also took account of the tonnage of 
total reserves and associated operating footprint, as there are currently some limitations to 
the space available for infrastructural items such as waste dumps and the TSF. Finally, the 
selection took into account that the underlying resource model was from the PFS and subject 
to revision during the FS. The selected shell was thus conservatively based on a nickel price 
of US$4.86/lb or only 54% of the long-term forecast of US$9.00/lb. The resulting shell was 
smaller (and higher margin) than the shell that generated the maximum post-tax NPV8%, with 
the selected shell containing approximately 13% less ore and Ni.  

• An engineered pit design was produced for the selected ultimate LG shell. This design used 
inter-ramp angles as recommended by the geotechnical consultants and ramps of sufficient 
width for the 230 t class trucks planned for use. The detailed engineering process resulted in 
a design that was superior to that produced by the LG algorithm, with the engineered design 
containing approximately 99% of the LG design nickel units in 100% of the LG ore, but with a 
reduction in stripping ratio of 0.15 tonnes of waste per tonne ore (for a total reduction in waste 
mined of 165 Mt or 11.5%). 

• In parallel with the mine design process, the resource block model and recovery equations 
were updated based on additional data collected during the FS. The LG algorithm was re-run 
using the final FS resource model and recovery equations. The pit shell corresponding to the 
engineered design was generated with a Ni price of US$5.58/lb or 62% of the long-term 
forecast. 

• Unplanned dilution and mining losses were added to the reserve estimate to reflect additional 
losses and dilution that would occur when mining at the upper contact between mineralization 
and overlying overburden. The gradational nature of mineralization near the hanging and 
footwall contacts, coupled with the methodology for interpolating grades into 20 m x 20 m x 
15 m blocks was considered to have accounted for any possible dilution at these contacts 
and no extra unplanned dilution was added. 

• A theoretical calculation of the cut-off grade was supported by an iterative investigation, which 
confirmed the highest project NPV8% was achieved with the selected NSR cut-off of $7/t.  

• Measured resources that would be treated as ROM ore were classified as proven reserves. 
Measured resources that would be initially stockpiled and all indicated resources were 
classified as probable reserves.

15.2.2 Revised PFS Resource Block Model 

Generating an optimal mine design, including the selection of ultimate pit limits and schedule for 
mining the contained material, is an iterative process. Accordingly, to provide engineers 
sufficient time to evaluate the many potential scopes of design, the process was initiated in Q2 
2012 using the resource block model that was produced for the revised PFS. In addition to 
geologic information (tonnage and grade of mineralization), the model also contained 
metallurgical information, including the expected recovery of metals to concentrate and the 
associated concentrate grade. The assumptions used to generate these estimates have been 
described previously, in the technical study for the revised PFS dated 22 June 2012.  

As there has been limited resource drilling since completion of the PFS study, the mineral 
content of the revised PFS is materially similar to that of the current FS resource model and 
salient differences between the two models are limited to: 

• Recovery equations developed for the revised PFS model were based on 83 Standard Test 
Procedure (STP) metallurgical tests, while those used in the current FS model are based on 
an additional 22 tests for 105 in total. (A discussion of the recovery equations is given in 
Section 13.7.) The earlier equations forecast an overall recovery of Ni for the selected 
ultimate pit shell of approximately 46% compared to 43% for the same shell using the current 
equations. Consequently, the revised PFS resource block model overstates the average 
value per tonne of mineralization contained within the selected pit shell by approximately 
7.0% compared to the current FS model.  

• Partially offsetting the overstatement of Ni recovery, the revised PFS model also classified 
the bulk of platinum and palladium (PGE) mineralization as inferred resources and therefore 
excluded from the design and analysis. PGE mineralization is now classified as measured or 
indicated resources due to locked cycle testwork conducted during the FS confirming that 
PGE mineralization can be recovered in economic concentrations to concentrate (see 
Section 13.7.5.2 for a discussion). PGE mineralization is now included in the design and 
analysis. The exclusion of PGE mineralization from the earlier model resulted in an 
understatement for average values contained within the selected pit shell of 2.0% compared 
to the current model.  

The net impact is that the revised PFS resource model overstates the average value of resource 
blocks by approximately 5.0% compared to the current FS resource block model.  

15.2.3 NSR Model 

Each block of mineralization within the resource block model has a unique estimate of grade, 
metallurgical recovery and concentrate grade. These were then used to calculate a value of 
NSR per tonne using the parameters given in Tables 15-2 and 15-3. 

Key assumptions used in the NSR calculations include the following: 

• Table 15-2 reports the average concentrate grade over the entire life-of-project. The 
scheduled concentrate grade ranges from a low of 22.1% to a high of 33.2%, with associated 
TC/RCs ranging from US$1.23/lb to US$1.40/lb.  

• Transport charges in Table 15-2 assume that 50% of total production will be treated in 
Sudbury, with the remainder evenly divided between Finland and China.

15.2.4 LG Pit Shells – Initial Pass 

The LG algorithm is the industry standard tool used to define the limits of an open pit. The 
design process was initiated by calculating the net value of each block in the model by 
subtracting estimated costs for mining, processing and administration from the NSR of each 
block (waste blocks with no NSR value have a negative net value).  

Costs assumptions used in the LG evaluation were based on the full mill production rate of 
105 kt /d and are as follows: 

• Fixed costs of $2.90/t for mining clay and $2.35/t for mining granular overburden (which is 
mainly composed of sand and gravel, and thus referred to as sand and gravel). The depth of 
material was not considered as these lithologies overlie the mineralization and are thus 
shallow. The key cost driver is rather the horizontal distance to the ultimate impoundment. 
The costs used were based on the average distance traveled.  

• Rock mining costs comprised of: 

− a base cost of $1.20/t (for blocks lying at or above the elevation of pit exits); and 

− a cost increment of $0.045/t for every 15 m bench below the exit. 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

15-5 

  

• Marginal processing + G&A costs of $7.00/t ore, comprised of: 

− processing costs of $4.80/t; 

− G&A of $0.55/t; 

− TSF construction of $0.30/t; 

− plant sustaining capital cost of $0.35/t; and 

− rehandle (for low-grade material only) of $1.00/t. 

Note the distinction of 'marginal' costs; these are costs that would be incurred by low-grade 
material initially stockpiled then re-handled. Higher grade material would not be subjected to the 
re-handle cost.  

Overall slope angles were assigned to the various sectors based on the recommendations 
provided in the following section. These slopes ranged from 42° to 50°. 

The LG algorithm then selected a 'cone' of ore and associated waste stripping that maximises 
NPV. By varying the metal price, it was possible to generate higher value nested cones that can 
be used to identify the optimal development sequence. With the revised PFS resource model 
that was used to generate shells initially, the lowest Ni price able to generate a cone was 
US$1.98/lb or 22% of the long-term price of US$9.00/lb. Shells were generated for each 
subsequent 1% increment in the Ni price then aggregated into 10 potential stages of mine 
development as summarized in Table 15-4.

The ten stages were evaluated using a spreadsheet techno-economic model. The evaluation 
revealed that NPV increased fairly rapidly until Stage 6 (1,175 Mt ore total), then moderated but 
continued to increase through Stage 8 (1,331 Mt ore total) then declined moderately through 
Stage 10 (1,493 Mt). It should be noted that the NPV for Stage 10 remained higher than that for

Stage 6 (see Figure 15.1). The impact of discount rate should also be noted – the incremental 
material in Stages 7 to 10 would require an extra 8.3 years of project life at a mill rate of 
105 kt/d, and the trajectory in NPV in part reflects the impact of an 8% discount rate being 
applied to the longer life.  

Figure 15.1:  First Pass LG – Post-Tax NPV8% as a Function of Final Stage  

 
Source:  RNC. 

Nonetheless, Stage 6 was chosen as the basis for the FS mine design and associated reserve 
statement as: 

• The rate of NPV accretion for subsequent stages slows. 

• The resulting mine plan of approximately 1,175 Mt ore and 1,500 Mt waste could be 
accommodated using the footprint and concepts established during the PFS. Notwithstanding 
changes to the location of impoundments (the location of TSF and waste dumps effectively 
reversed), the FS design is materially similar to the PFS design. A significant increase to this 
tonnage (such as would occur with selection of Stage 8 as the ultimate limit) would be 
feasible, but could require new concepts for the impoundment of incremental material.  

• Given the resource model on which the design was based was of PFS level accuracy, it was 
felt prudent to select a shell smaller than that which generated the maximum value. 

Plan and sectional views of the LG Stage 6 design are given in Figure 15.2. It can be seen that 
the surface footprint and ultimate depth of pit are very similar to the earlier PFS design, though 
this shell contains approximately 10% more ore and total tonnes. 

Figure 15.3 provides a similar view of the LG Stage 10 design. While the total ore and waste is 
43% higher than Stage 6 (27% more ore, 58% more waste), the surface footprint for this design 
is not materially larger.

15.2.5 Engineered Pit Design 

The LG shell pictured in Figure 15.2 represents the theoretical design, and while the final walls 
honour the imposed overall slope constraints, it cannot be considered a practical design as no 
provision is made for ramps. The engineered design includes 35 m wide ramps (approximately 
4.5x width of a 230 t truck) and inter-ramp angles rather than the overall angles used as the 
basis for LG wall designs.  

As can be seen in Figure 15.4, the engineered design provides dual-redundant ramp systems 
for both the hanging and footwalls. This not only reduces geotechnical risk (instability in one 
sector has a lesser impact when vehicles can choose from multiple exits), but also allows for 
split shell pushbacks that reduce the instantaneous mining rate. However, the dual redundant 
ramps result in marginally flatter final walls than used in the LG design. The engineered wall 
design has also been flattened by the inclusion of geotechnical berms of 20 m width, every 
120 m vertically. 

It can also be seen that a 'saddle' has been left between the southeast pit (which will be the site 
of the starter pit) and main pit. This is to allow use of the southeast pit as a water reservoir 
during mill operation.

The impact of slightly flatter slopes and leaving the saddle was largely offset by a rigorous and 
iterative design process that resulted in the optimization of material selected for inclusion within 
the final pit shell. As a result, the engineered shell is considered to be an improvement on the 
LG design, as shown in Table 15-5. It contains only 0.8% less Ni (60 Mlbs) in 0.1% more ore 
than the LG, reflecting a decrease in average grade of 1.0%. More significantly, the stripping 
ratio has been reduced by 11%, for a reduction of 165 Mt total waste rock and overburden.

15.2.6 FS Resource Block Model & Second Pass LG Pit Shells 

In parallel with the mine design process, the PFS resource block model and recovery equations 
were updated based on additional data collected during the FS. As noted previously, the 
inclusion of additional metallurgical testwork resulted in a reduction in average recovery for the 
selected pit shell from approximately 46% to 43% (see Section 13 for a discussion of recovery 
equations). This was partially offset by the reclassification of PGE mineralization as Measured 
or Indicated Resources due to locked cycle testwork conducted during the FS confirming that 
PGE mineralization can be recovered in economic concentrations to concentrate, allowing this 
material to be included in the evaluation. The net impact was a 5% reduction in the average 
value per tonne of mineralization.  

The LG algorithm was re-run to confirm that the pit shell selected as the basis for the 
engineered pit design was in fact economic given changes to the resource block model. 
Additionally, as the decision had been taken to leave a pillar between the southeast pit and 
main pit to create a water reservoir (see Figure 15.4 previously), this material was sterilized for 
purposes of the evaluation. All other evaluation parameters were unchanged from those listed in 
Sections 15.2.3 and 15.2.4 of this report.  

The various nested pit shells generated with the second pass LG run were similar to those from 
the first pass (after accounting for the saddle that was sterilized). The shell best corresponding 
to the engineered design was generated using a Revenue Factor of 62% (US$5.58/lb Ni price).  

Table 15-6 on the following page compares key parameters for the Engineered Design to output 
of the Second Pass LG. For simplicity, LG output has been grouped in stages of 10 nested 1-
percent increment shells. Additional granularity is provided for the range between a 60% and 
70% Revenue Factor.  

It can be seen that the nested shell generated with a 62% Revenue Factor has been selected 
as being closest to the Engineered Design. Using the LG parameters, the incremental profit for 
this Revenue Factor is $7.32/t ore (compared to the preceding 61% Revenue Factor shell, the 
62% Revenue Factor shell contains 41.3 Mt ore that generate $790 million in NSR with 
associated costs of $209 million for mining and $280 million for processing and G&A). The 
selected shell is thus considered to be a conservative estimate of the economic limits for 
Dumont reserve inventory.

15.2.7 Dilution & Mining Losses 

The drill hole sample compositing and block grade interpolation process used to construct the 
deposit block model is believed to incorporate sufficient dilution and hence, no additional 
planned dilution factors were applied. As shown in Figure 15.8, the original 1.5 m samples in the 
area of the arrow all grade between 0.39 to 0.52% Ni. Compositing these on 7.5 m intervals 
yields adjacent composites of 0.46 and 0.33% Ni, but the resulting block value generated 
through interpolation is only 0.33% Ni. 

Unplanned dilution and mining losses (defined as dilution and mining recovery factors not 
already inherent within the block model) will potentially occur at the contacts between ore and 
waste.  

Dumont mineralization is disseminated with large continuous ore zones between hanging wall 
and footwall waste rock contacts. There is no sharp contact between ore and waste at the 
hanging wall and footwall contacts. Rather, higher value mineralization hosted in dunite is 
bracketed by lower value mineralization hosted in peridotite (the engineered design includes 
21.2 Mt of peridotite-hosted ore). This gradational nature of mineralization, coupled with the 
methodology for interpolating grades into 20m x 20m x 15m blocks (equal to the smallest mining 
unit for the shovels and excavators that will be used) was considered to have accounted for any 
possible dilution at the hanging wall and footwall contacts. No extra unplanned dilution or mining 
losses was added for these contacts. Similarly, internal blocks of waste within the ore zones do 
not display sharp contacts and the block model selectivity is considered achievable in mining. 
This selectivity basis is not only pertinent to waste mining, it also pertains to selectivity of grade 
bins for dispatching ore to stockpiles versus the ROM feed as represented in the LOM schedule.

However, there is a sharp delineation of ore at the overlying sand and gravel contact. Moreover, 
the ore – sand and gravel interface can be an undulating uneven surface, leading to some 
unavoidable mixing of the two products during mining. Accordingly, within the contact horizon of 
10m (5m ore and 5m sand and gravel) it was assumed that 2m of sand and gravel would be 
unavoidably mixed with ore and 1m of ore would be unavoidably lost with waste. Losses and 
dilution were calculated on a block-by-block basis taking account of the differences in SG (2.57 
average for ore, 1.94 average for sand and gravel) and were scheduled as the affected blocks 
would be mined. The resulting impact is: 

• Dilution is expected to average 0.49% of total ore tonnage over the life of mine, with a peak of 
8.2% during the initial year of mill operation (when a significant tonnage of ore is located at 
the sand and gravel interface). Diluting material would carry no grade. 

• Mining losses are expected to average 0.28% of total ore tonnage over the life of mine, with a 
peak of 5.2% that also occurs in the initial year of mil operation. 

15.2.8 Cut-Off Grade 

Cut-off values used for mine planning will be based on the NSR value of material, as 
determined using the grade, recovery and price of all economic metals (including Ni, Co, Pt and 
Pd). As is normal for open pit designs, the calculation of cut-off values ignores mining costs and 
includes only the following marginal costs: 

• any incremental haulage costs from the pit rim that would be incurred for re-handling low-
grade ore (as material at the marginal cut-off grade would initially be stockpiled);  

• milling costs, including sustaining capital that would be effectively expended on a per-tonne 
basis (e.g., lifts of the TSF or annual maintenance of the mill); and  

• G&A. 

It has been reported previously in Section 15.2.4 that these marginal costs total $7.00/tonne. 
This value is an average and will vary as a function of the cut-off grade, as a lower cut-off will 
lead to a larger stockpile and associated higher hauling costs. Additionally, this value includes 
some sustaining capital costs, which are treated as unit costs (equally applied to all tonnage) 
when in reality sustaining costs for fleet and the TSF are incurred as step functions (no 
expenditure until a given threshold, then a large payment for a replacement truck or additional 
lift of the TSF) The theoretical calculation was tested iteratively, by adjusting the cut-off value 
upwards and rescheduling the mine plan. NPV was maximized with the $7/t cut-off, thus proving 
the validity of this value as a cut-off. 

As a separate exercise, the associated cut-off grade in % Ni was estimated for purposes of 
defining potentially economic resources to be included in reserves. As 96% of the NSR is 
generated from Ni, this cut-off grade calculation was based solely on Ni. Table 15-7 summarizes 
this calculation, showing that the theoretical cut-off is 0.09% Ni. 

A key variable in the calculation shown in Table 15-7 is metallurgical recovery. To account for 
the possibility that lower grade mineralization may exhibit lower recovery, the theoretical cut-off 
of 0.09% Ni has been increased by approximately 60% to the 0.15% Ni that is used in the 
resource estimate. It should be noted that the resource and reserve statement is based on this 
minimum 0.15% Ni grade – so blocks with an NSR value > $7/t but grading less 0.15% Ni have 
been excluded from the estimate and schedule. The tonnage of material within this category is 
small (approximately 7 kt) and therefore not material.

15.2.9 Reserve Classification 

Measured resources that would be treated as ROM ore have been classified as Proven 
Reserves, while Measured Resources that would be initially stockpiled and all Indicated 
Resources have been classified as Probable Reserves. 

The cut-off value used to define the material that would be treated as ROM ore will vary by year, 
as a function of the total tonnage and associated value of ore mined in a given year. The lowest 
value used as the ROM cut-off will be $15/t in Year 19, when a total of 41.8 Mt ex-pit ore is 
planned to be mined, or approximately 9% more than the mill capacity of 38.3 Mt/a. The highest 
value used as the ROM cut-off of $27/t will be used the following year, when waste stripping is 
complete and a total of 106.5 Mt ex-pit ore is planned to be mined, or 178% more than the mill 
capacity. The $27/t cut-off is also planned for Year 4 when the stockpile is being expanded in 
preparation for the transition from a single mill line at 52.5 kt/d to two lines totalling 105 kt/d. Ore 
mining of 58.6 Mt that year represents 206% more than the single line capacity. Over the 20 
year life of the pit, a $17/t cut-off is applied the most years (eight in total), followed by $19/t (six 
years).  

This variable cut-off is accounted in Table 15-8, which illustrates the conversion of resources to 
reserves. The open pit mine reserves declared in Table 15-8 have been carried forward into the 
LOM plan and production schedule as described in Section 16. As well, the project costs and 
economic analysis have been determined from this reserve and resulting LOM schedule. The 
results of LOM plan and financial analysis confirm that the appropriate parameters have been 
used in the LG runs (see Sections 21 and 22).

16 MINING METHODS 

16.1 Hydrology & Hydrogeology 

16.1.1 Hydrology 

The proposed mine development will be largely confined to an unnamed stream tributary that 
drains out along the left-bank of the Villemontel River. For the purpose of the FS, this tributary 
has been designated Unnamed Creek. At its confluence with the Villemontel River, Unnamed 
Creek has a total drainage area of 52.3 km2. The drainage catchment of this stream shares its 
northern and eastern boundaries with the divide between the Hudson Bay and St. Lawrence 
River watersheds. One of the key constraints on mine development will be preventing the 
transfer of surface water flow from the Unnamed Creek catchment to the Hudson Bay 
watershed. 

Unnamed Creek has two main tributaries that flow in a southerly direction, each draining areas 
of similar size. These tributaries have been unofficially named West Creek and East Creek, 
consistent with the side of the Unnamed Creek catchment that each drains. The confluence of 
these two streams occurs over the ore deposit, some 2.5 km upstream of the mouth of 
Unnamed Creek. 

A surface water management system will be constructed to direct the flows in West Creek, and 
East Creek around the open pit. Further information regarding the surface water management 
system is provided in Section 18. 

16.1.2 Hydrogeology 

Characterization of the Dumont hydrogeology was built on the work that was undertaken for the 
pre-feasibility study, and took into account the revised mine layout. 

Groundwater level monitoring data was taken from a total of 55 wells across the concession (42 
in overburden and 13 in shallow bedrock). Additional bedrock hydraulic testing was completed, 
bringing the total to 57 packer tests in 20 drill holes, as well as two long-term (>36-hour) 
injection tests. Overburden testing included a slug-testing program of 13 tests as well as a 41-
hour pump test in the sand and gravel horizon at the west side of the proposed open pit. 

A geographical information system (GIS) database was developed to compile and present the 
data collected. Surfaces were created for the dominant (overburden and bedrock) 
hydrogeological domains on a concession wide scale.

The surfaces generated in the GIS database were used to construct a 3D groundwater model 
for the project. Hydraulic parameters, taken from the field testing results, were assigned to the 
model domains. The output from model produced the following: 

• groundwater inflow to the pit (site water balance input) was estimated to range between 3,500 
and 5,400 m3/d during mine operations; and 

• boundary conditions and calibration data were used in pit slope pore pressure modelling for 
the geotechnical program. 

Pore pressure modelling of the pit slopes indicated that active depressurization is not expected 
to be necessary, although further pore pressure monitoring is recommended along the periphery 
of the pit to ensure pressures do not exceed levels generated by the model. 

16.2 Geotechnical Design Criteria 
The geotechnical characteristics of rock types that will be encountered in the Dumont pit have 
been determined by the following drilling/data collection campaigns: 

• dedicated geotechnical holes drilled during the Preliminary Assessment Study (three 500 m 
holes); 

• dedicated geotechnical holes drilled during the Pre-Feasibility Study (ten 500 m holes); 
• dedicated geotechnical holes drilled during the Feasibility Study (eleven 500 m holes); and 
• geotechnical logging of resource holes drilled during the pre-feasibility and feasibility 

studies. 

16.2.1 Geotechnical Model 

Partial geotechnical data exist for approximately 342 drill holes. Of these, 51 drill holes have 
been logged using oriented core for more detailed geotechnical parameters such as joint 
condition and orientation. The geotechnical model has been built using the geology (and 
alteration) wireframes, interpreted fault-network, and rock mass specific parameters. 

Three detailed structural geology studies have been undertaken on the Dumont deposit area:  
one in 2010, another in 2011, and a feasibility level interpretation and consolidation of 
knowledge in 2012. The deposit-scale structural geometries were modelled using regional 
geophysical data interpretation tied to drill hole data from RNC's geological database.  

Through this drilling, logging, and mapping, a consistent package of rock types has been 
identified. From hanging wall to footwall (as illustrated in Figure 16.1), they comprise the 
following: 

• basalt (BasHW); 
• gabbro (gab); 
• peridotite (perHW); 
• dunite (the host to mineralization, which includes dun and dun-CG); 
• peridotite (perFW); and 
• basalt (basFW).

Dumont Pit (Hanging wall is the Northeast Side of the Pit Shell)

Using the geological model as a framework, an analysis of geotechnical data was undertaken 
for the rock mass at the Dumont deposit. The assessed parameters include rock quality 
designation (RQD), fracture frequency per meter (FF/m), empirical field estimates of intact rock 
strength (IRS), field (point load) and laboratory (uniaxial compressive, triaxial, joint shear) 
strength, and RMR89 (Bieniawski, 1989). Representative geotechnical parameters for each of 
the four main rock types are given in Table 16-1, while a typical cross-section is given in Figure 
16.2.  

The structural investigation found three distinct structural domains for the Dumont open pit area. 
These domains are bounded by major structures and exhibit minor to moderate differences in 
joint and foliation data. The northeast-to-southwest-trending faults are steeply dipping towards 
the southeast. Damage-zones associated with faults oriented parallel and sub-parallel with the 
sill do occur. These sill-parallel faults are restricted to the basal-contact, footwall peridotites and 
the dunites – occurring throughout the strike-length of the pit, dipping towards the hanging wall. 

The combined litho-structural and alteration model was used to construct the geotechnical 
domains, for which a typical cross-section is given in Figure 16.2.

16.2.2 Rock Slope Design 

Reviews of the site geology, structural geology findings, geotechnical evaluation and resource 
targets indicates in this relatively strong rock mass, that the dominant controls on pit stability are 
likely to be kinematic. The failure modes will most probably be planar sliding on the footwall at a 
bench and inter-ramp scale, minor bench-scale wedges throughout the pit, with a low probability 
of toppling on the hanging wall. For fault damage-zones and exposed (and activated) dun-CG 
domain rocks, unravelling on a bench-scale may occur.  

Considering the geotechnical domains and the likely slope directions, slope design sectors 
where generated and design parameters developed for each design sector. The design 
parameters were based on a maximum stack height of 120 m, separated by a geotechnical 
safety berm. 

These design parameters included the following: 

• single or double benching; 
• bench width; 
• bench face angle; and 
• inter-ramp angle. 

For each slope design sector, an overall slope angle was determined based on the combination 
of the above listed parameters, the geotechnical berm/ramp width and the stack height. 
This inter-ramp angle was used in the design (Table 16-2). The pit phases and annual shells

were checked for interactions with major structures and geology, and no significant 
unfavourable conditions were found that cannot be operationally managed.

The footwall design has the bench-faces pre-split on finals to match the sill-parallel foliation, 
which will result in inter-ramp slopes which are parallel to the basal contact of the sill. Where 
slopes are built within, or in close proximity to the basal-fault damage zones, the benches and 
inter-ramp slopes may break back towards the fault-zone. In instances where this occurs, 
remediation and-or operational design adjustments of the affected slopes may need to be 
implemented.  

For some of the hanging wall slopes, rock block toppling may be experienced. Allowance has 
been made for the possibility of this toppling in the design and it may be an area for improved 
slope angles once trial slopes are established and the rock mass performance in excavation is 
determined. 

16.2.3 Recommendations 

There is some potential for more faults to occur within the volume than have already been 
interpreted, and further work (drilling and geological/geotechnical mapping) is required to 
satisfactorily understand the structural geology of some portions of the deposit area. 

During construction, the slopes established in the southeast pit should be used as an 
opportunity to investigate the behavior of the rock mass (in terms of failure mechanisms and 
mode) for each of the domains represented in the slopes. In particular, it will enable the footwall 
fault damage-zones' performance (with possible remediation measures) to be analysed prior to 
the northwestward pit advance. 

Determine which slopes are likely to experience some level of instability due to elevated pore 
pressures during freshet, and assess the schedule impact if access needs to be restricted at 
these times of year. 

16.2.4 Soil Geotechnical 

The geotechnical characteristics of soils that will be encountered within the pit area have been 
determined primarily on the basis of field programs completed during Q1 2011 and Q1 2012. 
Based on these field programs, the following soil types, listed in descending stratigraphic order, 
were identified: 

• Organic soil, which consists of a very weak organic mat and/or peat. This layer blankets 
much of the project area and extends to depths ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 m. 

• Clay, which is generally found below the organic soil and typically ranges in thickness from 2 
to 15 m. Two types of clay were encountered:  a firm to stiff brown clay and a soft to very soft 
grey clay. The brown clay overlies the grey clay in areas where both are present.  

• Silt, which is accompanied by a variable distribution of gravel, sand and clay, ranges in 
thickness between 1 and 16 m but is usually around 5 m thick. The silt ranges from soft to 
stiff.  

• Sand and gravel, which are generally dense to very dense and range in thickness from 1 to

Not all soil types are present in all areas of the pit. 

16.2.4.1 Database 

The geotechnical database for the soils in the vicinity of the open pit is comprised mainly of 43 
sonic drill holes, most of which extended to bedrock and were complemented by laboratory tests

on selected samples from the sonic drill program. An additional 53 CPT probes, performed to 
refusal (typically on dense granular soils), complete the data base in the open pit.  

16.2.4.2 General Stratigraphy & Geotechnical Conditions 

The overburden (soil) thickness in the vicinity of the open pit is illustrated as a series of coloured 
isopachs on Figure 16.4. Glacier movements have scoured a depression in the bedrock that 
coincides generally with the northwest-southeast orientation of the ore body. The thickness of 
the overburden approaches its maximum, close to 50 m, in the central portion of the pit. 
Conversely, the overburden is generally the thinnest along the sides of the proposed open pit.  

Figure 16.4:  Isopachs of Overburden Thickness

In general, where the overburden is less than 6 to 8 m in thickness, the soil profile consists of a 
thin layer of organic soil overlying a layered sequence of relatively stiff clay and silt, overlying 
dense gravelly sand or bedrock. However, where the overburden is greater than 6 to 8 m in 
thickness, the soil profile typically consists of a thin layer of organic soil overlying a 1 to 2 m 
thick layer of light brown, moist, firm to stiff clay overlying a layer of grey, wet to saturated, very 
soft to firm clay of variable thickness. A relatively thin layer of soft silt usually underlies the grey 
clay and a dense gravelly sand underlies the silt, or the clay where the silt is absent. 

The combined thickness of the organic soils, clay and soft silt deposits in the vicinity of the open 
pit is illustrated as a series of coloured isopachs on Figure 16.5. The thickness of these deposits 
is typically 2 to 10 m over most of the pit area, but is greater than 15 m in a few locations.

The grey clay, due to its low undrained shear strength, is the weakest unit within the overburden 
materials. Table 16-3 summarizes the average geotechnical properties of the grey clay based 
on laboratory testing. The CPT data compares well with the laboratory test results, but also 
confirms the undrained shear strength of the grey clay varies over the footprint of the proposed 
open pit. This variation is summarized in Figure 16.6, which shows three zones of grey clay 
based on the undrained strength results from the CPT probes.

16.2.4.3 Trafficability 

The expected trafficability of the various overburden soils is summarized below: 

• The organic soils, clays and soft silts will not support normal mining equipment unless a 
waste rock-bearing layer at least 1 to 2 m thick is placed over them.  

• The relatively stiff silt will typically require a layer of waste rock to provide trafficability, 
particularly if this material becomes wet due to precipitation or runoff. The thickness of the 
waste rock layer will depend on factors such as the moisture content and undrained strength 
of the soil, as well as the equipment size. 

• The sand and gravel materials are generally dense to very dense and will afford reasonable 
trafficability for mining equipment, except where localized layers or lenses of silt or clay may 
be present within the sand and gravel materials.  

16.2.4.4 Slope Design 

As noted previously, the low undrained shear strength (cu) of the grey clay is the key to the 
design of the overburden slopes. Three generalized overburden domains for slope stability 
analysis were established within the open pit area based on the undrained strength 
characteristics of the clay (Figure 16.6 above).  

Stability analyses under static and seismic loads were undertaken on simplified cross-sections 
through the overburden domains that were intended to address the typical range in soil 
stratigraphy. This produced a range of results that varied depending on the stratigraphy, the 
undrained strength of the fine-grained soil (i.e., the clay and/or silt) and the effective stress 
parameters for the coarse-grained soil (i.e., the sand and gravel materials). Based on these 
results, Table 16-4 presents the design of the open pit slopes for the overburden.

16.3 Open Pit Mine Plan  

16.3.1 Introduction 

The Dumont pit measures approximately 4.9 km along strike, 1.4 km at the widest point and 
reaches a maximum depth of 560 m. A total of 2,514 Mt of material will be excavated, using 
large surface mining equipment that will operate at high production rates. Many of the mining 
concepts resemble practices currently used at large open pit copper, iron ore and coal mines.

The low-grade of the ore implies that the mining operation must achieve high productivity and 
efficiency.  

As described in section 16.2.4 above, the ore body is covered with overburden of varying depth. 
Overburden, which represents 7% of the total material that will be excavated, is comprised of 
differing soil types. Overburden will be stripped in advance of the ore mining operation and 
impounded in different areas depending on the geotechnical parameters of the specific soil type. 
Waste rock, which represents 46% of the total material excavated, will mainly be stored in a 
single large dump, with a portion of the waste rock used for construction of various infrastructure 
including roads and the tailings storage facility (TSF). Ore, representing 47% of the total 
tonnage excavated, will be fed to the mill, either directly as run-of-mine (ROM) feed or after 
being temporarily impounded in a low-grade stockpile. Tailings from the treatment of ore will be 
impounded in the TSF while the pit is operational then in the depleted pit shell in later years 
when mill feed is sourced entirely from the stockpiles. 

The mine will have de-watering systems and an electrical supply system for the electrified 
mining equipment. Unit operations will consist of drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. Key 
criteria used in the design of the open pit reflect the size of equipment that will be used and 
include: 

• bench height of 15 m;  
• ramp gradient of 10%; 
• pushbacks have been designed using a target minimum mining width of 100 m, with the 

absolute minimum in isolated areas being 60 m; and  
• All final walls will be pre-split. 

The Dumont pit and mine plan was developed with standard mine planning practices following 
the steps of: 

• LG optimization; 
• shell selection and initial schedule; 
• pit phase design; and 
• final mine scheduling.  

These steps are described in the following sections.  

16.3.2 LG Optimization 

The LG Optimization has been described in some detail in Section 15.2.4 previously. This work 
is summarized in the following paragraphs. 

The LG optimization was initiated by calculating the net value of each block in the model by 
subtracting estimated costs for mining, processing and administration from the NSR of each 
block. These estimated costs were based on the forecast cost structure at the full mill 
production rate of 105 kt/d.  

Overall slope angles were assigned to the various sectors based on the recommendations 
provided in the Section 16.2, along with the ramp geometry from the earlier Revised PFS and 
35m ramps that will be used for 230 t class haul trucks. These slopes ranged from 42° to 50°. 

The LG algorithm then selected a 'cone' of ore and associated waste stripping that maximises 
NPV. By varying the metal price, it was possible to generate higher value nested cones that can 
be used to identify the optimal development sequence. Nested shells were generated for each

subsequent 1% increment in the Ni price then aggregated into 10 potential stages of mine 
development.  

The stages were evaluated using a spreadsheet techno-economic model. This model showed 
that NPV increased fairly rapidly until Stage 6, which contained 1,175 Mt ore or 10% more than 
the Revised Prefeasibility Study (Revised PFS) design. Beyond Stage 6, the increase in NPV 
moderated but continued to increase through Stage 8 (13% more ore than Stage 6), then 
declined moderately through Stage 10 (27% more ore than Stage 6). It should be noted that the 
NPV for Stage 10 remained higher than that for Stage 6. The impact of discount rate should 
also be noted – the trajectory in NPV in part reflects the impact of an 8% discount rate being 
applied to the longer life that would result with the later stages. 

The engineered mine design was based on Stage 6 (see Figure 15.2 for details). 

16.3.3 Shell Selection & Initial Schedule 

The mining sequence was developed based on the first pass nested LG shells that were 
discussed in Section 15.2.4. Five intermediate nested shells spaced by the target 100 m 
minimum mining width and the final pit shell were selected for the phase designs. All shells were 
then bisected by an approximate mid-point along the long axis of the pit so that the tonnage of 
individual pushbacks and associated instantaneous stripping rates could be minimized. Splitting 
the shell increased the number of LG stages to 11 (including 10 in the main pit and the 
southeast pit as a separate stage). The optimal sequence for mining these was determined by 
iteration, based on post-tax net present value. Of the 15 different permutations tested, the 
sequence pictured in Figure 16.7 (Sequence 'O') was determined to be optimal.

This optimal sequence not only considered ore revenues, stockpiles and waste stripping 
economics, it also considered the haulage costs. As such, a conceptual ramp system was 
developed for all the phases. 

16.3.4  Pit Phase Design 

Engineered design pits were produced for each LG phase shell. All internal phases (1 to 8) used 
single bench designs while the final pit employs double benching when allowed. Wall slope 
designs were based on the geotechnical criteria for each sector. The guidelines given in Table 
16-2 were simplified with use of a constant 70° bench face angle throughout and a variable 
safety berm width that was employed to arrive at the specified inter-ramp slope angle. All 
designs have 3D toe, crest and ramp lines to make a clean accurate design shape for every pit 
phase. These 3D shapes were intersected at sub-crop and surface topography to make concise 
pit designs and thus volumes for final scheduling and production calculations. 

The phase designs also included ramps of 35 m width, which is sufficient for the 230 t class haul 
trucks that are planned for use. The overall ramp concept followed the previous PFS ramp 
design with some adjustments required to ensure that pit exits aligned with access roads to the 
crusher and dumps, and that four-way intersections ('butterflies') are located to allow access to 
subsequent phases.  

Inclusion of practical considerations such as ramps and crest / toes for walls resulted in some 
differences between the LG design and engineered pit phases.  

These differences were minimized with the engineered design for the ultimate pit representing 
an improvement on overall stripping ratio with minimal losses of ore as follows: 

• the undiluted engineered design contains 99% of the LG design nickel (6,964 Mlb vs. 7,024 
Mlb) in 100% of the ore (1,178 Mt vs. 1,175 Mt); 

• the engineered design contains 11% less waste (1,337 Mt vs. 1,502 Mt); and  

• the engineered design stripping ratio is also 12% lower (1.13 vs. 1.28). 

The phase sequencing also follows the optimal LG sequence (Sequence 'O' pictured in Figure 
16.7 previously). The only material difference is that LG stage 5 is deferred until Phase 8 of the 
main pit, as shown in Figure 16.8. However, as will be shown in Figures 16.9 through to Figure 
16.29, a large portion of Phase 8 is accelerated, with the final annual plans very closely 
matching the optimal LG sequence. Figure 16.8 shows the phase design pits and final pit. All 
pits are same scale.

16.3.5 Annual Plans & Mine Schedule 

The phase designs were then used as the basis for annual plans that are illustrated in Figures 
16.9 through 16.29 on the following pages. The annual 'cuts' were developed around the LG 
initial sequence described above. Each design pit was depleted in sequence obeying the 
following guidelines: 

• mill feed closely following the LG schedule; 

• mine production closely following the LG schedule but was smoothed in some instances 
to optimize utilization of mine fleet; and 

• bench sinking rates kept at a maximum of 10 benches per year (preferably less). 

As identified in the preceding section, the annual plans are able to accelerate a portion of the 
southeast extension (SEE) in order to more closely match the sequence of LG stages. The 
upper benches of the SEE are excavated early in pre-production in order to obtain construction 
rock and early ore with a low associated stripping ratio as the depth of overburden in this area is 
limited. This zone sees additional excavation in the early - mid years to maintain the schedule 
along the lines of the LG optimization, as well as providing operational flexibility with additional 
loading faces to facilitate achievement of planned production tonnages. 

A typical year has two phases in production, while three is maximum and occurs regularly 
throughout the mine life.

A high level summary of the mining sequence is as follows: 

• Mining initiates at the southeast pit, which is at the extreme south-east of the deposit and 
separated from the main pit by a pillar. The primary focus of the pre-strip plan is to excavate 
the entire 37 Mt (of which 95% is ore or waste rock, with overburden only 5%) contained 
within the southeast pit  prior to mill start-up, in order to provide a water reservoir of 10 Mm3 
capacity and supply rock for construction. This will be achieved by employing both production 
excavators from the outset.  

• As mining in the southeast pit nears completion, one excavator will be re-allocated to the SEE 
and primarily target waste rock that will be used for construction. This unit will be active in the 
SEE until the end of the Year 1 of mill production.  

• Upon completion of the southeast pit, the second excavator will be re-allocated to Phase 1 of 
the main pit, which will have been stripped of clay by the contractor while the southeast pit 
was being mined.  

• At the end of Year 1 (of mill production), both excavators will be active in Phase 1, where they 
will be joined by the first rope shovel. A second rope shovel will be added one year later. The 
average daily production rate for this fleet will be approximately 200 kt/d. This production rate 
will be maintained until the end of Year 6.  

• In Year 7, a third rope shovel is added, followed by a fourth in Year 10. With the increased 
fleet, daily production increases to average approximately 375 kt/d. The excavators will be 
reserved mainly for loading sand and gravel, as well as sinking new benches and more cost 
effective rope shovels will be used for the bulk of rock mining. Clay will be mined using much 
smaller equipment.  

• Mining is intermittently active in the SEE from Years 6 to 17. With the completion of mining 
during Year 18, the void will be backfilled with waste rock from the final phases of mining to 
the north (Figure 16.30). The tonnage of waste rock planned to be tipped in the SEE is 
114 Mt, compared to 189 Mt of waste rock that will be mined after this dump becomes 
available for tipping.  

Figure 16.31 provides a summary of the annual mined tonnages.  

In addition to the re-handle of low-grade ore at surface stockpiles, some overburden (including 
both clay and sand and gravel) will be re-handled during the construction of the tailings storage 
facility (TSF). Details of the production schedule, including both ex-pit mining and rehandling of 
low-grade ore and overburden for construction, are given in Table 16-5. For simplicity of 
presentation, Table 16-5 also includes a summary of metallurgical production.

16.3.6 Low-grade Ore Stockpiles 

A key component of the mine plan is the accelerated mining of ore from the pit, with higher 
value ore being fed directly to the mill and lower value material being temporarily stockpiled. 
During the life of pit, a total of 606 Mt will be loaded to the low-grade stockpiles. The philosophy 
of ensuring that the mill is fed with the highest value ore available results in 103 Mt of low-grade 
material being reclaimed while the pit is still active using either a front end loader (during the 
first year of operation) or production excavator (Years 2 to 20). The remaining 503 Mt will be 
reclaimed after pit closure, using rope shovels. Reclaiming the low-grade material extends the 
life of project until 2049, for a total of 33 years mill production (see Figure 16.32). 

The strategy of accelerated mining has the additional advantage of creating a void (i.e., the 
mined-out open pit), which would accommodate approximately 498 Mt or 43% of the total 
tailings produced, thus reducing the surface footprint of operations. 

Figure 16.32:  Mill Production & Low-grade Stockpile

The strategy of stockpiling lower-value material allows the value of material treated during the 
initial years to be maximized. As a result, annual output averages 68 Mlbs payable Ni during the 
first 4.5 years of production (2016 to 2020) when the concentrator throughput is 52.5 kt/d. 
Maximum output during this time is 81 Mlbs in 2019.  

After throughput is increased to 105 kt/d, output increases to an average of 104 Mlbs payable Ni 
(maximum is 127 Mlbs) for the period 2021 to 2036 when the pit is active. After the pit is 
depleted and processing of lower grade stockpiles commences in July 2036, output drops to an 
average of 65 Mlbs payable Ni, as shown in Figure 16.33.

As a result of the low strip-ratio material mined during the initial 4.5 years when the milling rate 
will be 52.5 kt/d, the mine plan releases 2.3 tonnes of ore for every tonne milled and the value of 
ore treated reaches $35/t by the time the expansion is commissioned. Following expansion and 
the move into higher stripping ratio areas of the pit, the ratio of ore mined to ore milled drops to 
1.70, with a commensurate drop in value of ore mined to $26/t. Excluding the higher value 
material during the initial 4.5 years, the ratio of ore mined to ore milled during the expansion 
years is 1.6 and the value of ore treated is $25/t. 

Material impounded in the low-grade stockpiles will range in value from $27/t down to the cut-off 
of $7/t, with the overall average being $15/t. As a result of this range in value, low-grade ore will 
be located in three distinct dumps described below: 

• LGO3, which is a small dump with maximum capacity of 12 Mt, will be located closest to the 
crusher and within the final pit shell. This will be used to impound higher grade material in the 
initial years of mining and will be depleted by the end of Year 6. A total of 20 Mt of average 
value $21/t passes through this dump.  

• LGO2, which is a larger dump (maximum capacity of 93 Mt), will also be located close to the 
crusher and used for impounding higher value material. Approximately 50% of the 176 Mt ore 
tipped on this dump will be reclaimed while the pit is still active. The remainder will be 
reclaimed before any material is reclaimed from LGO1. The total transiting through this dump 
will be 176 Mt of average value $20/t. 

• LGO1 is the largest low-grade stockpile, with a capacity of 410 Mt. This dump will be sub-
divided into three or more areas based on value of ore. Higher value ore (198 Mt of average 
value $14/t) will be reclaimed first, followed by intermediate value (145 Mt averaging $12/t). 
The lowest value material (67 Mt averaging $9/t) will be treated last.  

Note that Figure 16.36 illustrates the relative location of the various stockpiles and a typical 
cross-section.  

The design and capacity of stockpiles has been based on geotechnical parameters and 
requirements of the mine plan. The manner in which the stockpiles will be operated, including 
the division of ore stockpile 1 (LGO1) in three sub-areas and the exact sequence for 
reclamation, will also be governed by operating parameters that will be established once 
production commences.   

16.3.7 Waste Dumps 

The 2,514 Mt excavated from the pit includes 1,179 Mt ore, along with waste materials 
comprising 50 Mt clay, 126 Mt overburden that is mainly sand and gravel, and 1,159 Mt waste 
rock. In addition to the 50 Mt of clay excavated from the pit, a further 13 Mt will be excavated 
from the key trench beneath the TSF dam wall for a total of 63 Mt. As discussed in Section 
16.2.4 previously, there are two forms of clay at Dumont. Brown clay, which typically extends to 
a depth of 2 m, can be used for construction of the clay core in the TSF and for reclamation of 
dumps at the end of pit life and will thus not be impounded in waste dumps. Brown clay is 
estimated to total 9 Mt, including 5 Mt from the pit and 4 Mt from the key trench. The remaining 
54 Mt grey clay (45 Mt from the pit and 9 Mt from the key trench) has no productive use and will 
be impounded in cells constructed out of sand and gravel overburden and/or waste rock. Cells 
will measure 200 m by 200 m in plan view and will be raised in four (4) lifts of 5 m. 
Approximately 75% of these cells will be contained within the larger overburden dump 1 (OB1) 
that is located centrally on the hanging wall side of the pit. A single clay cell will be contained 
within the smaller overburden dump 2 (OB2) at the southeast extremity of the property. The 
remainder will located within the southeast extremity of the main waste rock dump (WR1).

Approximately 17% of the remaining non-clay overburden (including organics, till and sand and 
gravel) will be used for TSF construction or reclamation of dumps. Of the remaining 105 Mt, 
approximately 74% will be impounded in OB1 (including that used for construction of the clay 
cells). The remainder (approximately 26 Mt) will be impounded in overburden dump 2 (OB2), 
which is a much smaller dump located at the far south-east end of the property and will serve to 
mitigate the impact of noise from the operation on communities to the east of the property. OB2 
will have an approximate height of 40 m and will be constructed in 6 lifts, with the initial 4 lifts 
having a height of 5 m followed by two lifts of 10 m.  

Approximately 20% of total waste rock will be used for construction of the TSF and roads, 
including roadstone that will be used to continually re-surface roads. Of the remaining 940 Mt 
waste rock, approximately 103 Mt will be impounded along with sand and gravel and clay in 
OB1. The combined tonnage of clay, sand and gravel, and rock for this impoundment will be 
225 Mt and it will extend approximately 3.4 km along strike and to an approximate height of 
40 m (as with OB2, it will be constructed in 6 lifts of either 5 m or 10 m). To minimize haulage 
distances, OB1 will be accessed by 4 separate ramps. The northern and southernmost will be 
aligned with the hanging wall north (HW-N) and hanging wall south (HW-S) pit exits, with the 
remaining two spaced evenly between.  

A further 10% of waste rock (114 Mt) will be impounded within the pit, after mining in the SEE is 
completed. This dump will be constructed in two phases. The initial phase of approximately 
12 Mt, contained within eight lifts of 15 m each, will be established in a bottom-up sequence (the 
blue levels in Figure 16.35). With this initial phase in place to act as a catchment, the remaining 
102 Mt will be tipped from the top (grey in Figure 16.35) to achieve an overall face slope of 
1.5H:1V.

Note:  Looking North. Initially eight 15 m lifts shown in blue are placed from the bottom of the pit at an overall slope of 
2.25:1. Subsequently, lifts are dumped from the top down at an overall slope of 1.5:1. Source:  RNC. 

The majority of waste rock (723 Mt) will be stored in WR1, which is located between OB1 and 
LGO1 (Figure 16.36). With the compacted bulk density of 2.15 t/m3, this dump will occupy 
336 Mm3 (the design allows for 5% extra capacity, or 353 Mm3 total). It will be constructed in 11 
lifts and have an approximate height of 85 m. Given the dump will be constructed on top of 
overburden, to ensure stability the initial lift will be only 2 m and will be followed by 4 lifts of 5m 
each. Additionally, the pit-facing slopes will be a relatively flat 6H:1V, compared to 3H:1V used

on slopes not facing the pit. It may prove possible to improve the design (i.e., reduce associated 
operating costs) by steepening dump slopes and/or depositing material in greater lift heights 
initially – especially given that initial rate of deposition will be moderate, with delivery of the 
228 Mt contained in the lower 5 lifts only completed after Year 10, for an average deposition 
rate of 22 Mt/a. The remaining 6 lifts will each be 10 m in height and will be deposited an 
average rate of 52 Mt/a. 

The boundary between WR1 (which will be a permanent impoundment) and LGO1 (which will 
be reclaimed) will not be vertical but follow the 3H:1V final slope of the dumps. This face will be 
reclaimed following the end of stockpile reclaim operations. All other dump faces will be 
reclaimed during normal operations, as soon as the lift is complete. In addition to mitigating any 
environmental issues, early reclamation will allow maximum delivery of reclaim material (either 
brown clay or organic overburden) from ROM operations rather than more costly stockpiling and 
subsequent rehandle. 

The calculation of haulage distances and associated cycle times assumes that each lift of the 
dump will be tipped to completion before the next lift is initiated. In practice, the dump would 
likely operate on multiple lifts simultaneously, which would serve to defer longer hauls and have 
a positive impact on the NPV of the operation. 

Figure 16.36 provides a plan view of the various dump and stockpiles (including temporary 
stockpiles of material that will be used for reclaiming dumps and the TSF).

16.3.8  TSF  

The TSF will be constructed using waste rock, sand and gravel, and clay excavated from the pit. 
Both TSF1 and TSF2 will be built in two stages as summarized in Figure 16.37: 

• The starter dams will be constructed prior to delivery of any tailings to the impoundment. Both 
TSF1 and TSF2 starter dams will be built to a nominal height of 15 m (varies along the 
perimeter due to topography), which will be sufficient to store approximately one year of 
tailings production. The starter dams will be comprised of a 30 m wide core, an upstream 
component with a slope of 6H:1V and a downstream component with slope of 2H:1V. The 
core will include a 6 m wide clay zone (with very low permeability) and adjacent 6 m wide 
filter (constructed using sand and gravel). The remainder of core and both upstream and 
downstream components will be constructed using waste rock.  

• After deposition of tailings commences, the dams will be raised using the centre-line 
methodology, where the upstream component toes into the tailings surface, while the 
downstream component continues to be tipped at a slope of 2H:1V. The rate of rise will be 
approximately 6 m/a for TSF1 and 4 m/a for the larger TSF2. 

The dam would be constructed by first excavating any clay that underlies the dam wall and 
backfilling this excavation (the key trench) with sand and gravel stripped from the pit. Rock used 
in the construction of the TSF will be delivered on a 12-month basis, and will be sourced entirely 
from ROM operations (no stockpiling required). To allow rock to be delivered with cost-effective 
230 t class trucks, the central core will be tipped solidly with rock. The TSF will be preferentially 
constructed using gabbro and basalt, but peridotite and dunite are also acceptable. 

The clay core and filter layer would be constructed on a six-month basis (during warm months, 
when clay was soft enough to be handled) and peak requirements will exceed instantaneous 
ROM output, resulting in some stockpiling and rehandle being required.

16.3.9 Surface Haul Roads 

Pit operations will require the construction of 46.6 km of haul roads on surface, with 12.4 km 
being temporary and removed as either the pit expands or TSF2 is constructed. The remaining 
34.2 km will be permanent. To minimize dust and maximize tire life, roads will be constructed 
using only gabbro and basalt rock types. Additionally, allowance has been made to cover all 
roads (including ramps in the pit and roads on dumps) with 50 mm of roadstone annually, 
resulting in production of approximately 40 Mt of roadstone over the life of mine.  

All main haul roads will be 35 m wide, which is suitable for the 230 t class trucks planned for 
use. Roads will be filled with a minimum of 2 m at the centreline and sloped at -2% to the edges. 
Roads will be located a minimum of 40 m from the crest of the pit. To minimize dust generated 
on nearby communities, no haulage roads will be located on the south side of the pit. 

16.4 Mining Process Description 

16.4.1 Overview 

Ex-pit mining operations at Dumont will be conducted by the following fleets of production 
mining equipment (in order of lithology that will be mined): 

• Clay will be mined using small hydraulic excavators with 7 m3 dippers (nominal 12 t payload) 
and 55 t payload rigid body haul trucks. No drilling and blasting will be required. 

• The bulk of sand and gravel below the clay layer will be mined using large diesel-powered 
hydraulic excavators with 34 m3 dippers (nominal 60 t payload) and 230 t payload rigid body 
haul trucks. No drilling and blasting will be required. The bench height will be 10 m. 

• At the interface between rock and sand and gavel, rock will be loaded and hauled using the 
same size equipment as will be used for clay. Rock will be drilled using percussion drills with 
a nominal hole diameter of 102 mm on a bench height of up to 5 m. 

• Below the sand and gravel interface, rock will be drilled using rotary blast hole units with 
holes measuring 270 to 311 mm in diameter. The bulk of rock will be loaded using large 
electric rope shovels with 43 m3 dippers (nominal 75 t payload) though some rock will be 
mined using the 34 m3 hydraulic excavators. All rock will be hauled using 230 t payload rigid 
body haul trucks. A bench height of 10 m will be used on any bench within some occurrence 
of sand and gavel. Below this horizon, benches will have a height of 15 m as per the pit 
design. 

Production equipment will be supported by various units of support equipment, including tracked 
dozers, wheel dozers, front end loaders, graders, water tankers and utility excavators.  

The bulk of the mining fleet will be purchased and operated by the Owner. The duty cycle for 
production units was estimated by first principles, based on the production plan.  

Norascon, a local mining contractor with experience operating in similar environments has been 
pre-selected to assist in the mining operation. The contractor will operate mainly a fleet of small 
hydraulic excavators and 55 t trucks and will be tasked with performing the following: 

• establish the initial working faces for the Owner's large hydraulic excavators; 
• mine all clay and rock – sand and gravel contact material for the initial five years of operation 

(including 22 months of pre-strip and subsequent 38 months); and  
• following the initial five-year period, the contractor will supplement the Owner's clay mining 

fleet as required according to the mine plan.

The following infrastructure would be provided to support mining activities: 

• workshop and associated warehouse; equipment will be maintained under a maintenance 
contract initially, with a phased hand-over to in-house personnel as experience is gained; 

• fuel farm and associated fuelling bays; 
• explosives manufacture facility and magazine; as is the norm in Canada, this will be operated 

by the explosives supplier; 
• in-pit sump and associated dewatering system; and 
• electrical reticulation system. 

The Owner's mining labour complement will average 331 persons during the life of the project, 
reaching a peak of 650 persons while the pit is active then dropping to an average of 116, while 
the low-grade stockpile is being reclaimed. The mining contractor workforce will average 95 
persons over the eight years that the contractor will be active, with a peak of 178 persons in the 
early years. 

16.4.2 Mining Fleet 

Fleet sizes were based on the following assumptions: 

• The mine will operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.  

• The mechanical availability and operator utilization of equipment would vary according to the 
particular unit of equipment. Average annual engine hours (product of availability and 
utilization) for the main production equipment would range from a high of 7,000 (cable 
shovels) to 6,300 (230 t haul trucks) to 4,900 (diesel-powered percussion drill).  

• An efficiency factor of 90% was applied to utilized time, meaning that 10% of total engine 
hours (incurring costs) would not be directed towards completing useful work. 

Table 16-6 and Table 16-7 summarize the main units of the mining fleet that will be used by the 
Contractor and Owner, while Tables 16-8 and Table 16-9 summarize the size of mining fleet by 
year over the life of the project during ex-pit operations and stockpile reclaim periods, 
respectively. Examples of the specific fleet units have been provided for reference, but these do 
not in any way indicate that a decision has been made on the actual Original Equipment 
Manufacturers (OEMs) that will be selected to supply equipment to the project. The OEMs will 
be selected following a competitive tendering process. 

There is some overlap between Contractor and Owner fleets (e.g., the Contractor fleet of small 
rigid body trucks would peak at 21 units and would average 19,000 engine hours or ~20% of 
their economic life at the end of the contract when they would thus be available for sale to the 
Owner). However, the capital cost estimates given in Section 21 do not include any synergies 
between the two fleets; all Contractor equipment is assumed to be leased at a rate reflecting the 
current purchase cost of a new machine while all Owner equipment is assumed to be purchased 
new.

16.4.2.1 Production Drilling & Blasting 

Geotechnical parameters for the various Dumont rock types were input into simulations by two 
different explosives suppliers (Dyno-Nobel and Orica) to predict the required powder factor. 
These simulations indicated that an acceptable particle size distribution for all rock types could 
be achieved with a powder factor of 0.25 kg/t. Typical blast patterns are approximately 8 m x 
8 m on 10 m benches and approximately 10 m x 10 m on 15 m benches, yielding a weighted 
average of approximately 3,400 t per hole drilled. In a typical year following the expansion to a 
milling rate of 105 Mt/a, mining of 140 Mt rock results in drilling of approximately 40,000 holes 
with approximately 590,000 m of drilling. 

The same data regarding rock properties was provided to the suppliers of rotary blast hole drills. 
Based on feedback from these OEMs, the following instantaneous penetration rates were 
estimated: 

• 102 mm percussion: 

− basalt and gabbro = 50 m/h 

− dunite and peridotite = 60 m/h 

• 270 mm and 311 mm rotary: 

− basalt and gabbro = 35 m/h 

− dunite and peridotite = 42 m/h 

As dunite and peridotite combined represent 72% of rock that will be mined and 98% of all rock 
will be drilled with rotary drills, the life of mine average penetration rate is 41.8 m/h. The 
calculation of total drill hours also includes the following: 

• an allowance for re-drilling 3% of holes; 

• delays for moving between holes of 5 min for percussion drills and 7.5 min for rotary drills; 
and 

• an allowance for moving between patterns equal to 15% total operating time. 

After including the operator efficiency factor of 90%, rotary drill productivity is estimated at 
23.3 m/h. With this productivity, the production plan can be achieved with a fleet that reaches a 
maximum strength of four electric rotary units, supplemented by two diesel rotary units and two 
percussion drills. At the end of mine life, the average age of the four units' electric rotary 
machines is 48,000 hours, while the diesel rotary units will have each reached approximately 
35,000 hours. This is less than the economic life of these units (120,000 and 60,000 hours for 
the electric and diesel units, respectively), and no replacement machines would be required.  

Similarly, the Owner's two percussion units will have achieved approximately 12,000 engine 
hours or 20% of their economic life. There is an opportunity to reduce the capital cost of these 
machines by purchasing one or more of the Contractor's units, which will have reached ~8,000 
hours each at the end of the contract. 

16.4.2.2 Pre-Splitting 

The mine design assumes that all final walls will be pre-split. The design of pre-split blasts was 
based on simulations performed by Dyno-Nobel, which indicated that with 20 kg of explosive 
placed in a 15 m x 165 mm diameter hole, the following hole spacing by rock type would be 
required:  basalt = 1.75 m, gabbro = 1.85 m, peridotite = 2.22 m, dunite = 2.67 m. A weighted 
average of 2.39 m was then estimated, based on the volumes of the four different rock types.

Rev:  0

16-41 

  

The total pre-splitting requirement was based on an estimated 407 km of total final wall 
perimeter over the 39 benches that would be mined. The resulting 171,000 presplit holes would 
require 2,729 km drilling. Pre-splitting was assumed to start in Year 8, when the initial final walls 
are established in the southeast extension. The total metres of pre-splitting was then evenly 
divided by the remaining duration of ex-pit mining (with pre-splitting assumed to be finished 6 
months before the final production blast), resulting in monthly rates of 1,145 holes or 18.3 km.  

Pre-split drilling would be accomplished by a fleet of percussion rigs equipped with down-the-
hole hammers. Similar penetration rates as estimated for the 102 mm percussion drill have 
been assumed above and a fleet of two units would be required. 

16.4.2.3 Loading & Hauling 

A trade of study conducted during the PFS determined that the optimal match of load and haul 
equipment at Dumont would be the largest class of rope shovel (≥ 40m3 dipper and payload of 
up to 110 tonnes) loading 230 t payload trucks in three passes. During the FS, this analysis was 
updated using the most up to date cost and productivity data from all the OEMs potentially able 
to supply equipment to the project. The earlier PFS findings were confirmed as: 

• The ratio of tare weight-to-payload for trucks larger than 230 t payload is generally inferior, 
resulting in slower uphill travel speeds and increased diesel consumption per tonne 
transported. Additionally, larger trucks require wider ramps and thus flatter slope angles with 
more waste stripping. Wages in the Abitibi are such that the savings in labour resulting from 
use of larger trucks does not offset these two factors and trucks larger than the 230 t class 
cost more to operate on a unit basis.  

• There is very little savings in capital costs or the hourly operating cost for a smaller class of 
rope shovels that are equipped with 34 m3 dippers that can load a payload of up to 60 t. This 
class of shovel would require four passes to load the 230 t truck, which would necessitate the 
purchase of additional units to achieve the Dumont mine plan.  

Note that while the large rope shovel that has been selected could theoretically load a 230 t 
truck in two passes, there is a large body of anecdotal evidence suggesting this has detrimental 
effects on both truck life and truck driver health. Consequently, a more conservative three-pass 
arrangement has been assumed. Furthermore, loading design criteria (Table 16-10) assume 
that 25% of trucks would be loaded in four passes to reflect likely variability in loading 
conditions. In the event that two-pass loading were feasible, the impact to the overall project 
would be to improve post-tax NPV by approximately 3%. 

The excavators are not fully utilized, with the FS mine plan resulting in average production of 
3.3 and 10.8 Mt/a for the clay and rock units, respectively (77% and 42% of theoretical 
productivity). The rope shovels will be utilized closer to their maximum, with average production 
of 35.4 Mt/a.  

Criteria used to calculate the productivity of various hauling units are given in Table 16-11. 
These have been provided by OEMs based on the rimpull curves of the different units under 
consideration, and assume 10% ramp gradients and 2% rolling resistance. Calculated values 
such as cycle time, tramming speed and productivity are primarily a function of the haulage 
profile.

With the parameters given in Tables 16.10 and 16.11, the Owner's clay fleet (including rock 
mined at the sand and gravel interface) peaks at 3 excavators and 18 trucks (supplemented by 
Contractor fleet of up to 5 excavators and 20 trucks to handle peaks in the schedule). Use of 
this fleet over the entire mine life averages 39,000 hours for excavators (compared to an 
economic life of 60,000 hours) and 41,000 hours for the trucks (100,000 hr life). No 
replacements are required and there is likely an opportunity to smooth the schedule and 
rationalize fleet purchases. 

The Owner's fleet of large production excavators totals two units that average 44,000 hours at 
the end of mine life. No replacements of these units are required. 

The fleet of rope shovels reaches a maximum of four units, which can log a total of 511,000 
hours, resulting in one unit slightly exceeding the economic life of 120,000 hours that has been 
assumed. The evaluation thus includes purchase of a replacement unit. It should be noted there 
are instances of rope shovels exceeding 130,000 hours and being planned for 175,000 hours so 
it may be possible to avoid this purchase. 

The fleet of large haul trucks reaches a maximum of 72 units and in aggregate logs 7.1 million 
hours. While the average of 98,600 hours per machine is less than the economic life of 
100,000 hours, the timing of purchases for the existing mine plan is sub-optimal and a total of 
16 units are planned for replacement. There may be an opportunity to smooth the production 
schedule and reduce or eliminate some of these replacement purchases. 

A computerised truck dispatching system will be employed to maximize the utilization and 
efficiency of the haul truck fleet. 

16.4.2.4 Support Equipment 

Open-pit haul roads and working faces would be maintained with a fleet of support equipment 
that includes: 

• Track dozers, for ripping footwalls and for heavy construction work. The fleet requirements 
were estimated based on the empirical relationship of 0.5 operating dozers for every 
operating production loading unit (for both the Contractor and Owner fleets). The contractor 
fleet would be supported by smaller 8 m3 blade for example, while the Owner fleet would be 
supported by an 18 m3 blade (i.e., class) unit.  

• Rubber-tired dozers, for lighter construction and general cleanup. The fleet requirements 
were estimated based on the empirical relationship of 0.5 operating dozers for every 
operating loading unit (Owner only). Equipment with an 8 m3 blade would be utilized. 

• Graders. The fleet requirements were estimated to be two graders for the contractor fleet and 
three graders for the Owner fleet. The contractor fleet would use units with a 14 ft blade, while 
Owner fleet would utilize larger units with a 16 ft blade. 

• Water tankers, for suppressing dust. An allowance was made for two units to support the 
Contractor fleet and two units to support the Owner fleet. The Owner units would be 
converted 130 t class haul trucks (130 m3 capacity) while the Contractor units would be 
converted 35 t class articulated trucks (35 m3 capacity). 

• Front end loaders, for construction and clean-up activities including the loading of roadstone 
into trucks. Front end loaders would also be available to supplement to main production fleet, 
if required. One unit has been assumed for each of the Contractor (11 t payload) and Owner 
fleets (35 t payload). 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

16-44 

  

• Utility excavators, for construction activities such as would take place at the TSF. The Owner 
utility excavators would also be equipped with attachments for scaling highwalls and breaking 
oversize, as required. The Contractor fleet would require a single unit while the Owner fleet 
would vary in size according to the required duty, with a maximum of 5 machines required. 

16.4.3 Infrastructure 

16.4.3.1 Workshop 

A workshop and associated warehouse would be provided to maintain the fleet of equipment. 
The size of this workshop was based on the following empirical factors:   

• one maintenance bay for every five production trucks; and  

• one auxiliary bay for every 12 production trucks.  

The workshop is initially six bays at start-up, expanding to 10 bays when the concentrator 
increases to 105 kt/d. As the fleet continues to increase due to longer hauls, the workshop 
would ultimately reach 20 bays. 

Equipment would be maintained under a maintenance contract initially, with a phased handover 
to in-house personnel as experience was gained. A more complete description of the workshop 
is given in Section 18. 

16.4.3.2 Fuel Farm / Diesel Bay 

Diesel consumption has been estimated from first principles, based on the burn rate for the 
various pieces of equipment that would be operated and specific duty cycle (in the case of haul 
trucks, burn rates were estimated for each of the different profiles listed in Table 16-11). Figure 
16.38 illustrates that the large (230 tonne) haul trucks operated by the Owner on ex-pit hauls 
are expected to consume 69% of the 1,500 ML diesel required over the life of mine and a further 
11% when rehandle of low-grade stockpiles and construction of the TSF are included. Diesel 
used as fuel for other Owner mining equipment represents another 13% of the total requirement 
while diesel used by the Contractor and in explosives is each 2% of the total. The remaining 3% 
of consumption is by light equipment operated at the Concentrator and by General and 
Administration (G&A) personnel.  

As will be discussed in Section 24, there is an opportunity to use trolley-assist to reduce diesel 
consumption. A study completed as part of the FS identified the potential to reduce diesel 
consumption by large trucks on ex-pit uphill hauls by more than 350 ML (or 23% of base case 
consumption). 

For the conventional haulage base case, average daily consumption over the initial period of 
operation (mill rate at 52.5 kt/d) starts at 50 m3/d and increases steadily to 100 m3/d at the time 
of expansion, with a maximum daily consumption of 122 m3/d during this time. The fuel farm has 
been sized to allow for surge, with the initial capacity of 900 m3 providing over 1 week storage 
during periods of maximum consumption. With the expansion of mill capacity to 105 kt/d, the 
fuel farm will be expanded to 1,650 m3, providing over five days of storage for the year of peak 
consumption. After the end of ex-pit operations, consumption drops to 20 m3/d. 

Equipment would be fuelled at a diesel fueling station located adjacent to the workshop 
complex. A modified 140t haul truck would be equipped with a fuel tank to refill equipment in the 
pit, if necessary.  

A more complete description of the fuel farm is given in Section 18.

16.4.3.3 Explosives Manufacture Plant 

Rock will be blasted using emulsion explosives. For the initial 34 months of operation (including 
the 22-month pre-strip and initial 12 months of mill production), the consumption rate would be 
low enough (<20 t explosives per day) that explosives could be supplied from one of the 
following existing plants located within the Abitibi: 

• Orica – Plant located at the Canadian Malartic mine, approximately 90 km from the Dumont 
mine site; or 

• Dyno-Nobel – Plant near in Val d'Or, approximately 100 km from the Dumont mine site.  

Explosives would be trucked using 14 t bulk delivery trucks that would deliver explosives directly 
to the blast hole. The daily traffic would thus be 1 to 2 trucks. 

By the second year of mill production, the daily consumption of explosives would be sufficient to 
justify the construction of a plant at the Dumont mine site. Raw materials (including ammonium 
nitrate prills, ammonium nitrate solution, emulsifier, and diesel) would be non-explosive until 
combined at the facility and delivered by trucks with payload 37 to 40 t. In line with Canadian 
regulations, the facility will be located at least 1 km from all infrastructure (buildings, public 
roads) and 670 m from an active dump. 

The explosives manufacture facility will use intellectual property owned by the explosives 
supplier. In line with North American practices, the facility would thus be owned and operated by 
the explosives supplier. Based on budgetary quotations provided by Orica and Dyno-Nobel, the 
financial model assumes that this facility would be rented for the entire life of mine. The

decommissioning of this facility at the end of mine life would be the responsibility of the 
explosives supplier. 

16.4.3.4 Roadstone Crusher 

To ensure the truck fleet achieves high productivity (including an average life of 8,000 hours for 
tires on the large haul trucks), roads would be continually re-surfaced with crushed waste rock. 
Rock would be crushed to a nominal size of 20 mm through a two-stage plant (primary jaw and 
secondary cone crusher). This is approximately the same size product as would be required for 
the concrete batch plant during construction, and a single crushing plant would be used for both 
construction and roadstone.  

The duty cycle of the roadstone plant has been based on the following: 

• All haul roads will receive 50 mm of crushed material annually (equivalent to two treatments 
of 25 mm). 

• All blast holes will be stemmed using crushed roadstone. 

• The total requirement for roadstone has been estimated at 39.3 Mt over the life of project, 
comprising: 

− 8.6 Mt of roadstone on in-pit roads that will be reloaded as the roads are mined out 

− 30.3 Mt of roadstone on surface roads that will be permanent in nature (not reloaded) 

− 0.4 Mt of roadstone used for blast hole stemming. 

Feed to the roadstone plant will be delivered using large haul trucks while crushed roadstone 
will be loaded into large haul trucks using a front end loader. 

16.4.4 Manpower  

The mine will operate continuously, with 2 x 12 hour shifts daily and 365 days per year. This will 
be achieved by 4 crews each working an average of 42 hours per week and labour costs allow 
for two hours of planned overtime weekly (in addition to unplanned overtime). Staff personnel 
will work on a conventional 5-day week schedule.  

The life of mine labour complement illustrated in Figure 16.39 was calculated from first 
principles based on the number of units of equipment required to achieve the planned 
production schedule. During the initial 4.5 years of commercial production, while the 
concentrator is operating at 52.5 kt/d, the complement would average 407 persons, including 87 
mining contractors. 

After the concentrator is expanded to 105 kt/d and the mining rates increase, the complement 
increases to a maximum of 650 and average 587.  The Owner's labour complement averages 
331 persons over the life of project, including 463 while the pit is active and 116 during reclaim 
of the low grade stockpile. These totals do not include personnel allocated to TSF construction, 
who would average a further 34 during the 20 years that construction of the TSF is active. The 
Contractor's complement will average 95 persons during the 8 years that the Contractor is 
active.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 General 
The process plant and associated service facilities will process ore delivered to primary 
crushers to produce nickel concentrate and tailings. The proposed process encompasses 
crushing and grinding of the ore, desliming via hydrocyclone circuit, slimes rougher and cleaning 
flotation, nickel sulphide rougher and cleaning flotation, magnetic recovery of sulphide rougher 
tails and sulphide cleaner tailings, regrinding of magnetic concentrate and an awaruiter recovery 
circuit (consisting of rougher and cleaner flotation stages). 

Concentrate will be thickened, filtered and stockpiled on site prior to being loaded onto to 
railcars for transport to third-party smelters. The slimes flotation tailings, magnetic separation 
tailings and awaruite rougher tailings will be combined and thickened before placement in the 
TSF. 

The process plant will be built in two phases. Initially, the plant will be designed to process 
52.5 kt/d. The expansion will be designed as a duplicate processing plant to increase plant 
capacity to 105 kt/d. The initial phase will include an allowance for common concentrate 
thickening facilities.  

17.2 Design Criteria Summary 
The overall engineering approach was to design robust process plants that could handle a wide 
range of ore variability and operating conditions. The key project and ore-specific criteria for the 
plant design and operating costs are provided in Table 17-1. 

17.3 Plant Design Basis 
The key criteria selected for the base plant (52.5 kt/d) and expansion plant (105 kt/d) designs 
are: 

• nominal base plant treatment rate of 52.5 kt/d and a nominal expansion plant treatment rate 
52.5 kt/d for a combined 105 kt/d treatment rate; 

• design availability of 92% (after ramp-up), which equates to 8,059 operating hours per year, 
with standby equipment in critical areas; and 

• sufficient plant design flexibility for treatment of all ore types at design throughput. 

The selection of these parameters is discussed in detail below.

17.4 Throughput & Availability 
Ausenco selected one 11.6 m (38 ft) diameter SAG mill and two 7.9 m (26 ft) diameter ball mills 
for each 52.5 kt/d plant. Ausenco believes that this circuit is suitable to achieve the design 
throughput for design competency ore, with potential for increased throughputs for softer ores. 
Ausenco has nominated an overall plant availability of 92% or 8,059 h/a. This is an industry 
standard for a large, multi-train flotation plant with moderately abrasive ore. Benchmarking 
indicates that operating plants have consistently achieved this level. Given the low abrasion 
index of the Dumont ore, this availability is likely conservative. 

17.5 Processing Strategy 
Selection and sizing of the crushing and grinding circuits was determined through variability 
comminution testwork performed at SGS-Lakefield. Testwork provided a crusher work index, 
Bond ball and rod mill indices, Bond abrasion index, SMC and JK Axb values for the selected 
samples. Ausenco elected to use the 75th percentile of each of these values in the design.  

17.6 Head Grade 
Each plant is designed to treat ore with a head grade of 0.37% Ni. The annual feed grades for 
the LOM range between 0.22-0.37%. The average plant feed grade for phase 1 (first 5 years of 
operations) is 0.34% nickel, with a maximum peak of 0.37%. The average feed grade for phase 
2 is 0.26% nickel, with a peak of 0.31% nickel. The phase 2 plant design will need to be 
revisited once the phase one in operational to determine the optimum design point. 

17.7 Flowsheet Development & Equipment Sizing 
The process plant flowsheet design for the Dumont circuit was conceptually based on those of 
comparable large flotation plants and then confirmed or altered based on trade-off studies and 
metallurgical testwork. Figure 17.1 shows a process schematic for the Dumont plant (only 
52.5 kt/d plant shown). Details of the flowsheet design and the selection of major equipment for 
the process plants are discussed in the sections below.  

17.8 Unit Process Selection 
The process plant design is based on a flowsheet with unit process operations that are well 
proven in the minerals processing industry. The Dumont flowsheet incorporates the following 
unit process operations (52.5 kt/d plant discussed below): 

• Ore from the open pit is crushed using a primary gyratory crusher (assisted with a rock 
breaker) to a crushed product size of nominally 80% passing (P80) 90 mm. Crushed ore is fed 
onto the covered stockpile feed conveyor. 

• A covered conical stockpile of crushed ore with a live capacity of 12 h, with three apron 
feeders, each capable of feeding 60% of the full mill throughput.

17.9 Comminution Circuit 

17.9.1 Primary Crushing 

Based on the design throughput and moderate competency ore characteristics, a 60" x 89" 
gyratory crusher is considered the most suitable primary crusher for the duty. 

The primary crusher will be located at the edge of the ROM pad. A partially buried crusher 
design has been selected to reduce ROM pad elevation (reduce mine haulage costs) without 
major excavation being needed.  

Trucks will dump from both sides of a 243 m3 capacity live hopper above the crusher; 
alternatively, ore can be rehandled and fed with a front-end loader (FEL).  

The primary crusher will be located in an enclosed building. This will help minimize dust 
emissions and reduce noise. Additionally, an overhead crane will be installed in the building for 
maintenance of the crusher.  

The gyratory crusher will crush ore to a product size of 80% passing 90 mm. The maximum feed 
size to the crusher will be 1.2 m; oversize material will be broken with a rock breaker. 

17.9.2 Crushed Ore Stockpile 

Crusher product will be conveyed from the crusher discharge vault by the variable-speed 
primary crusher discharge belt feeder, and discharged onto the sacrificial conveyor. Ore is 
transferred via the stockpile feed conveyor to the crushed ore stockpile. A weightometer will be 
installed on the sacrificial conveyor to provide production rate data for the crushing circuit. 
Space for a self-cleaning electromagnet has been made over the sacrificial conveyor head 
pulley to remove steel tramp prior to discharge onto the stockpile feed conveyor should it be 
needed. 

The stockpile will provide a minimum of 12 h live capacity at the design SAG mill new feed rate 
of 2,378 t/h; higher throughputs will reduce this capacity. The total capacity of the stockpile is 
approximately 60 hours of SAG mill new feed capacity or approximately 143 kt. In event of the 
crushing circuit being out of operation for extended periods, a bulldozer can be used to reclaim 
the dead material in the stockpile to provide emergency feed to the milling circuit. Three apron 
feeders have been selected to reclaim ore from the stockpile, each able to deliver 60% of the 
design mill feed rate. 

The stockpile will be enclosed to minimize fugitive dust emissions. The cover will be a dome of 
structural steel construction and cladding. The stockpile will be approximately 98 m diameter x 
37 m high. 

17.9.3 Comminution Design Criteria 

The major comminution design parameters used for this study are: 

• crusher work index (CWi) of 15.3 kWh/t based on the 75th percentile of the samples tested at 
SGS; 

• bond rod mill work index (RWi) of 15.6 kWh/t based on the 75th percentile of the samples 
tested at SGS; 

• bond ball mill work index (BWi) of 21.0 kWh/t based on the 75th percentile of the samples 
tested at SGS; 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

17-9 

  

• bond abrasion index (AI) of 0.007 g based on the 75th percentile of the samples tested at 
SGS; 

• drop weight index (DWI) of 4.8 kWh/t as measured from the SMC test (equivalent to an Axb 
of 54.2 at a specific gravity of 2.6); and 

• target grind size P80 of 180 µm, based on various flotation testwork programs (directed by 
RNC).  

The grinding circuit was designed to be capable of processing the required tonnage of 52.5 kt/d. 
To account for variations in ore competency, Ausenco uses the 75th percentile for all design 
data. This would indicate that the current circuit could achieve higher throughputs when 
processing less competent ore.  

Flotation testwork and mineralogy have indicated that Dumont ores are relatively insensitive to 
grind sizes (P80) up to about 150 μm in the laboratory. In order to achieve the specified design 
recovery, RNC has nominated a primary grind size target of P80 of 180 µm. A P80 of 180 µm has 
been selected because it is typical for sulphides to be found in finer size fractions under plant 
conditions when compared to laboratory testwork (as screens are used for sizing in the 
laboratory compared to hydrocyclones in the process plant).  

Ausenco uses a power-based approach to determine grinding circuit power requirements. The 
approach is based on empirically derived models developed from a database of actual plant 
operations data and associated bench-scale testwork. Critical input parameters to the model are 
ore competency (measured by either JK drop weight Axb or SMC DWi values) and Bond work 
indices (CWi, RWi and BWi). Ausenco's power-based model predicts the milling efficiency of the 
various circuits based on the JK drop weight/SMC data, which is a measure of ore competency. 
The approach also considers the impact of ultramafic ores on the Bond BWi test results. 

The specific energy and mill sizing determined using Ausenco's in-house method for the major 
ore types is shown in Table 17-2. 

The installed ball mill power of 16,000 kW incorporates allowances for drive train losses as well 
as a design contingency to account for the accuracy of the models, calculations and testwork 
used to determine the expected average pinion power.  

The installed motor power for the SAG mill incorporates similar allowances, as well as an 
additional contingency to allow adjustment in the mill operating conditions to handle ore 
variability. These allowances and contingencies require the installation of 21,000 kW.

17.9.4 Reclaim, SAG & Ball Mill Circuit 

The crushed ore will be reclaimed from the ore stockpile by three apron feeders onto the SAG 
mill feed conveyor. The feeders will be equipped with variable speed drives.  

A SAG mill feed weightometer will be installed on each SAG mill feed conveyor to provide feed 
rate data for control of the reclaim feeders. The reclaimed crushed ore will be fed at a controlled 
rate to the SAG mill.  

Discharge from the SAG mill will gravitate through a trommel screen. Oversize pebbles from the 
trommel screen (scats) will be recycled back onto the mill feed conveyor after magnetic 
separation of scats. Pebbles will be reintroduced onto the mill feed conveyor via the recycle 
pebble conveyors. Undersize from the SAG trommel screen will gravity flow into the cyclone 
feed hopper. 

The SAG mills discharge slurry will be pumped via dedicated cyclone feed pumps to the two ball 
mill cyclone clusters, each operating in a closed-circuit configuration with a single ball mill. 
Water is added to the cyclone feed hopper as needed to achieve the required cyclone feed pulp 
density. 

Hydrocyclone underflow from each cluster will gravity flow to a dedicated 16 MW twin pinion ball 
mill (two 8 MW motors operating in parallel). Discharge from each ball mill will gravity flow 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

17-11 

  

through a trommel screen, into the cyclone feed hopper for reclassification. Cyclone overflow 
will gravity flow to the first stage deslime cyclone feed hopper. 

The milling circuit will require the installation of two clusters of seven 800 mm hydrocyclones per 
cluster, of which six will be in operation with one on standby. A pneumatically actuated valve will 
be provided with each hydrocyclone for isolation requirements. Rubber-lined steel pipes, 
hoppers, and chutes will be installed throughout the grinding circuit to handle coarse slurry. 

Two vertical sump pumps will be provided in the grinding area, and one in the stockpile area, to 
facilitate clean-up. 

17.9.5 Mill Circuit Classification 

The classification circuit has been designed for a nominal circulating load of 250%; this is a 
typical design value for material of similar characteristics and target grind size and is widely 
used in the industry for SAB circuits. To avoid damage to the cyclone clusters, the SAG mill 
discharge slurry first passes through a trommel screen with 12 mm x 55 mm slotted apertures to 
remove pebbles; the undersize flows into the hydrocyclone feed hopper. The pebbles will be fed 
back to the SAG mill feed via pebble recycle conveyors for further grinding. An electromagnet 
on the pebble recycle conveyors will remove any tamp metal. 

A pebble circulating load of 15% of the new feed rate has been assumed in the design, based 
on typical industry experience with ores of similar competency. The conveyors are designed to 
handle peak loads of up to 25% of new feed.  

SAG and ball mill discharge will be combined in the ball mill hydrocyclone feed hopper and then 
pumped to two clusters of 800 mm diameter hydrocyclones to a target overflow P80 of 180 μm. 
Each hydrocyclone cluster will be fed with a dedicated hydrocyclone feed pump. 

Hydrocyclone overflow will report as feed to a desliming circuit prior to slimes flotation, while the 
coarse hydrocyclone underflow from each of the two clusters will combine and report to a 
dedicated ball mill (No. 1 or No. 2) for further grinding. 

17.9.6 Deslime Circuit 

A two-stage desliming circuit deslimes ball mill No. 1 and No. 2 hydrocyclone overflow to 
remove slimes. This is critical to achieve optimal flotation kinetics. The two-stage circuit 
accomplishes this with hydrocyclone clusters. The first stage will split mass with a cut size 
(D50c) of 50 µm utilizing 400 mm hydrocyclones. Overflow from the first stage of desliming 
passes through a horizontal trash screen to remove large particles that could potentially block 
the smaller cyclone in the second stage. Trash screen underflow is feed for the second stage.  

The second stage will split mass with a cut size (D50c) of 10-15 µm utilizing 100 mm 
hydrocyclones. The underflows from both the first and second stage are combined and fed to 
the nickel sulphide rougher flotation circuit. The stage 2 hydrocyclone overflow flows by gravity 
to the slimes flotation circuit.  

17.10 Flotation Circuit Design 
Mineralogical examination and lab scale testwork has revealed that a majority of the nickel 
sulphide in the ore is recoverable with adequate concentrate grades through flotation at a P80 of 
150 μm. However, the use of magnetic recovery stages and regrind has been shown that 
additional nickel sulphide recovery is achievable.

The aforementioned magnetic recovery stage has the main purpose of recovering nickel that is 
in various alloy forms, predominately awaruite. A subsequent regrind stage and magnetic 
recovery is required to liberate additional nickel sulphides and allow for higher rates of gangue 
rejection.  

17.10.1 Circuit Type & Size 

The flotation circuit selected to concentrate Dumont ore consists of slimes rougher and three-
stage cleaner flotation, sulphide rougher and three-stage cleaner flotation, magnetic separation, 
regrind, secondary magnetic separation and awaruite rougher and cleaner flotation. Slime 
rougher and cleaner flotation tailings, combined magnetic tailings and awaruite rougher tailings 
report to a common tailings thickener. Slimes, sulphide and awaruite concentrates are 
combined after flotation. The residence times for the nickel flotation circuit have been based on 
the testwork performed on various Dumont ore types and composite ore type samples.  

The testwork flotation and design residence times are summarized in Table 17-3.

17.10.2 Flotation Circuit Configuration  

Stage 2 deslime hydrocyclone overflow will be fed by gravity to the slimes distribution box, 
where flotation reagents will be added. The slimes flotation circuit consists of eleven 300 m3 
tank flotation cells. The cells will be in a paired configuration arrangement with an elevation 
change between pairs of cells. Additional dosing points for the flotation reagents will be located 
along the slimes flotation banks. 

Concentrate from the slimes flotation cells will flow by gravity to a slimes concentrate hopper 
and is pumped to the slimes cleaning circuit. Slimes rougher tailings will be pumped to the 
tailings thickener. 

The slimes 1st cleaner stage consists of four 50 m3 tank flotation cells, operating in an open 
circuit configuration. Slimes 1st cleaner flotation tailings are combined with the second cleaner 
tailings and pumped to tailings thickener and the concentrate is pumped to the nickel sulphide 
2nd cleaner flotation stage. 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0

17-13 

  

The slimes 2nd cleaner stage consists of three 5 m3 tank flotation cells, operating in open circuit 
(with the option to send 2nd cleaner tails to 1st cleaner feed). The slimes 3rd cleaner stage 
consists of three 1.5 m3 tank flotation cells. The 2nd and 3rd stages are configured such that 3rd 
cleaner flotation tailings flow by gravity back to the head of the 2nd cleaner stage. The slimes 2nd 
cleaner concentrate is pumped to the slimes 3rd cleaner and the 3rd cleaner concentrate is 
pumped to the concentrate thickener. 

The reagents added will consist of a combination of KAX51 (PAX, collector), MIBC and/or Cytec 
65 (frother) and Calgon (depressant). The distribution box will gravity flow to the slimes flotation 
cells, which are connected in series.  

Stage 1 and 2 deslime hydrocyclone underflow is combined, and fed via gravity to three parallel 
rougher conditioning tanks, where flotation reagents will be added. The conditioning tanks will 
gravity flow to the nickel rougher flotation cells, which are connected in series. Three trains of 
nine 300 m3 forced-air tank flotation cells have been selected to provide the required residence 
time for the rougher flotation. The cells will be in a paired configuration with the exception of one 
cell, with an elevation change between pairs. Additional dosing points for flotation reagents will 
be located along the rougher banks. 

Concentrate from each train of the rougher cells will flow by gravity to a common nickel rougher 
concentrate hopper and then be pumped to the nickel sulphide cleaning circuit. Rougher tailings 
from each train will flow by gravity to the magnetic plant feed hopper.  

The reagents added will consist of a combination of KAX51 (PAX, collector), MIBC and/or Cytec 
65 (frother) and Calgon (depressant). 

Nickel rougher tails will gravity flow to the stage 1 magnetic separation feed hopper were it is 
combined with sulphide cleaner tailings (see Section 17.11). Magnetic concentrate will be 
pumped to a regrind stage. Regrind cyclone overflow flows by gravity to a magnetic sulphide 
scavenger flotation stage. 

The magnetic sulphide scavenger flotation stage consists of seven 200 m3 tank flotation cells 
(single train). The cells will be in a paired configuration arrangement with an elevation change 
between pairs of cells. Magnetic sulphide scavenger tailings will be pumped to stage 2 magnetic 
separation (see Section 17.11), while recovered nickel sulphide concentrate will be pumped to 
the nickel sulphide cleaner flotation circuit. 

Three streams feed the sulphide 1st cleaner flotation circuit; sulphide rougher flotation 
concentrate, magnetic sulphide scavenger flotation concentrate and nickel sulphide 2nd cleaner 
flotation tailings. The sulphide 1st cleaner stage consists of seven 200 m3 tank flotation cells. 
Nickel sulphide 1st cleaner flotation tailings are pumped to the aforementioned regrind circuit 
and concentrate is pumped to the nickel sulphide 2nd cleaner flotation stage. 

The nickel sulphide 2nd cleaner stage consists of six 20 m3 tank flotation cells. The sulphide 3rd 
cleaner stage and the awaruite cleaner consist of five and six 5 m3 tank flotation cells, 
respectively. The 2nd and 3rd stages are configured such that 3rd cleaner flotation tailings flow by 
gravity back to the head of the 2nd cleaner stage. 

Stage 2 magnetic separation concentrate will be pumped to the awaruite flotation circuit.  

The awaruite flotation circuit consists of a rougher flotation stage (tailings report to the tailings 
thickener) and a single cleaner flotation stage (tailings recirculated to head of the rougher 
stage). A conditioning tank is used before the rougher flotation stage, where reagent addition

takes place. The rougher flotation stage consists of six 70 m3 tank flotation cells. The awaruite 
cleaner flotation stage consists of five 1.5 m3 flotation cells.  

17.11 Magnetic Separation 
A low-intensity magnetic separation circuit is used to treat the tailings of the nickel sulphide 
rougher and cleaner flotation stages. The function of this circuit is to recover nickel containing 
magnetic awaruite (primarily awaruite) that can be found in the sulphide rougher and cleaner 
tails.  

Testwork performed using magnetic separation established mass recovery and approximate 
concentrate nickel grade design criterion. Other parameters are based on benchmarking and 
vendor recommendation.  

The selected design criteria are summarized in Table 17-4.

Nickel sulphide rougher and cleaner flotation tailings will be pumped to two trains of 7 single 
drum magnetic separators (3.6 m long and 1.2 m diameter) per train via a feed distributor. The 
number of separators selected will allow for variations in throughput and magnetic recoveries. 

Magnetic concentrate will be pumped to the regrind circuit, specifically a regrind mill cyclone 
feed hopper. 

A second low-intensity magnetic separation circuit is used to treat the tailings of the magnetic 
sulphide scavenger flotation stage. This material is the 1st stage magnetic concentrate which is 
first passed through the regrind mill and a sulphide flotation stage. The function of this circuit is 
to recover nickel containing magnetic awaruite (primarily awaruite) and further reject gangue 
material. 

The only design criterion that has been established at this stage is approximate mass recovery 
and an approximate concentrate nickel grade. Other parameters are based on benchmarking 
and vendor recommendation. 

Magnetic sulphide scavenger flotation tailings will be pumped to one train of five single-drum 
magnetic separators (3.6 m long and 1.2 m diameter) per train via a feed distributor. The 
number of separators selected will allow for variations in throughput and magnetic recoveries. 

Magnetic concentrate will be pumped to the awaruite flotation circuit, specifically an awaruite 
rougher conditioning tank.

Magnetic separation tailings (non-mags) from both stages will be combined and pumped to the 
tailings thickener.  

17.12 Magnetic Concentrate Regrind 
A closed regrind circuit is used to grind the magnetic concentrate stream. The stream is fed to 
the regrind mill cyclone feed hopper and then pumped to a cluster of 508 mm hydrocyclones to 
achieve a product size of nominally 80% passing (P80) of 46 µm. Hydrocyclone overflow will 
report as flotation feed to magnetic sulphide flotation, while the underflow will report to the 
regrind ball mill for further grinding. 

The design stream to the regrind mill is 650 t/h; with an estimated maximum BWI of 18 kWh/t 
based on data from similar applications. This indicates a specific power requirement of below 
11.8 kWh/t to achieve the nominated regrind size of P80 of 45 μm. On this basis, a single 
8,000 kW regrind ball mill has been selected for this study. 

17.13 Nickel Concentrate Thickening, Storage & Filtration 
The thickening of the nickel concentrate will be common to both the 52.5 kt/d and 105 kt/d 
plants. A larger thickener has been selected to accommodate the additional concentrate for a 
plant throughput of 105 kt/d.  

Nickel flotation concentrate will be thickened to approximately 60% w/w solids in a 14 m 
diameter above-ground high-rate thickener. Concentrate thickener design is based on a typical 
(estimated) settling rate of 0.25 t/m2/h for nickel concentrate. 

The concentrate storage tank prior to filtration will have a live volume of 450 m3, which has been 
sized based on 24-hours of residence time for the 52.5 kt/d plant. The concentrate storage 
allows for routine maintenance of the concentrate filter.  

The concentrate filter will be a vertical plate and frame "Larox style" filter press. No concentrate 
handling testwork has been undertaken as there has been insufficient concentrate production to 
do filtration testwork. Ausenco has based the design on experience with similar ultra mafic 
nickel concentrators to derive a conceptual design. These assumptions will require testwork and 
confirmation during subsequent study. 

This filter was selected as a benchmark against other similar operations as there is an absence 
of testwork to determine appropriate filter selection at this point in time. 

Filter cake is stockpiled and loaded onto either rail cars or trucks via a front-end loader. 

Expansion to a plant throughput of 105 kt/d will require an additional concentrate storage tank 
and vertical Larox style filter press. 

17.14 Tailings Disposal 
The design basis chosen for this level of study includes a tailings thickener, with disposal of 
thickened tailings in a nearby TSF and recovery of water from the TSF surface.  

The tailings thickener design has been based on a settling rate of 0.45 t/m2/h and results in the 
selection of an 88 m high rate thickener.  

Plant tailings slurry, consisting of slimes rougher and cleaner flotation tailings, combined 
magnetic separation tailings and awaruite rougher tailings, will be pumped to the high-rate

thickener. The slurry will be thickened to a target density of 40% w/w solids. The thickened 
tailings slurry will be pumped to the TSF via a 4 km HDPE pipeline. Process water from the 
thickener overflow will flow by gravity to the plant process water storage pond. Additional 
process water recovery from the TSF will be pumped back to the process water pond via barge 
pumps, and a 4 km HDPE water pipeline. 

17.15 On-Stream Analysis  
The on-stream analysis (OSA) system will provide online nickel and other supporting assay 
analysis on the following 11 streams: 

• ball mill hydrocyclone overflow;  

• slimes flotation tailings (one stream); 

• nickel sulphide rougher flotation tailings (three streams); 

• combined magnetic separation tailings (non-mags); 

• awaruite rougher flotation tailings; 

• awaruite cleaner flotation concentrate; 

• nickel sulphide 3rd cleaner flotation concentrate; 

• final combined concentrate; and 

• final combined tailings. 

Analyzed samples, exiting the OSA system, will be discharged into sample return hoppers and 
will either be pumped back to the 1st stage deslime cyclone feed hopper, concentrate filter feed 
tank, or the combined magnetic tailings hopper. 

The OSA system will be located at an optimal position to permit the maximum use of gravity 
flow of sample feed and sample reject slurries and minimize requirements for sample pumps 
and hoppers. 

17.16 Reagents 
Reagents for the project are listed below.

circuit dosing points by multiple dosing pumps.  

pH Modifier – Sulphuric Acid (H2SO4) – Sulphuric acid will be supplied by bulk tankers and 
off-loaded into a storage tank; expansion will require an additional storage tank. One unloading 
pump is required for pre and post expansion conditions. The storage tank will have capacity for 
84 hours of consumption at design flow rates. The sulphuric acid will be distributed to the 
flotation circuit dosing points by multiple dosing pumps.  

Flocculant – Magnafloc 333 – Two flocculant mixing, storage and dosing systems will be 
provided, located in the reagent preparation area. The tailings thickener and the concentrate 
thickener will have dedicated flocculant dilution systems. Magnafloc 333 will be supplied in 1000 
kg bulk bags for the tailings flocculant mixing system and as 25 kg bulk bags for the concentrate

the grinding media hoppers located near the mill feed end. From the hoppers, balls will be 
added to a bottom discharging kibble, which will be hoisted by overhead crane to a position 
above the mill feed chute, and emptied into the mill. 

17.17 Air Services 

17.17.1 Process Air 

The flotation blowers will supply low pressure process air to the flotation cells at the required 
supply pressure (two different pressures). There will be four blowers (all four duty) installed to 
meet flotation air requirements for the initial 52.5 kt/d process plant. In order to meet the 
process air requirements for the plant expansion to 105 kt/d, four additional air blowers will be 
added. Pressure control valves will be installed in the air distribution lines to meet the different 
air pressure requirements of different flotation cells. Multiple-stage, centrifugal type blowers will 
be used with a "blow-off" arrangement to adapt to fluctuations in flotation air demand. 

The blowers will be housed inside their own room to reduce plant noise to an acceptable level. 
The room will have ventilation for cooling. 

17.17.2 Plant & Instrument Air 

Three rotary screw air compressors will provide intermediate pressure compressed air for plant 
and instrument air requirements. There will be two duty and one standby compressor operating 
in lead-lag mode. Plant air will be stored in the plant air receivers to account for variations in 
demand prior to being distributed throughout the plant.  

During the expansion, two plant air compressors and one instrument air compressor will be 
added. 

17.18 Process Control Philosophy 
The control philosophy to be implemented for the Dumont Nickel project is typical of those used 
in modern mineral processing operations. 

Field instruments provide inputs to a set of programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Process 
control cubicles are located in the motor control centres (MCCs), and contain the PLC 
hardware, power supplies, and input/output (I/O) cards for instrument monitoring and loop 
control. 

The PLCs perform the control functions by: 

• collecting status information of drives, instruments, and packaged equipment; 

• providing drive control and process interlocking; and 

• providing proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control for process control loops. 

Standard personal computers (PCs) will be located in the main control room (MCR) and the 
crusher control room (CCR). The PCs are networked to the PLCs and operate a supervisory 
control and data acquisition (SCADA) system that provides an interface to the PLCs for control 
and monitoring of the plant. 

The SCADA system is configured to provide outputs to alarms, control the function of process 
equipment, and provide logging and trending facilities to assist in analysis of plant operations.

17-19 

  

The control rooms are purpose-built structures. The majority of the plant is controlled from the 
MCR, which is located between the comminution and flotation circuits. The MCR houses two 
control room operator stations, one engineering station and a printer. 

Operator control stations are fully redundant, such that the failure of one station would not affect 
the operability of the other station or control of the plant. Control stations are supplied from an 
uninterruptible power supply unit (UPS) with 20 minutes of standby capability. 

Drives that form part of a vendor package are controlled from the vendor's control panel. At a 
minimum, "Run" and "Fault" signals from each vendor control panel are made available to the 
SCADA system via the PLC. 

The general control strategy adopted for the Dumont Nickel project is as follows: 

• integrated control via the process control system (PCS) for areas where equipment requires 
sequencing and process interlocking; 

• hardwired interlocks for safety of personnel; 

• motor controls for starting and stopping of drives at local control stations, via the PCS or 
hardwired depending on the drive classification (all drives can be stopped from the local 
control station at all times; local and remote starting is dependent on the drive class and 
control mode); 

• control loops via the PCS except where exceptional circumstances apply; 

• monitoring of all relevant operating conditions on the PCS and recording selected information 
for data logging or trending. 

Trip and alarm inputs to the PCS will be failsafe in operation (i.e., the signal reverts to the de-
energized state when a fault occurs).

18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 

18.1 Introduction 
The project consists of an open pit mine, crushing, stockpile conveyor, coarse ore stockpile and 
enclosure, SAG and ball mill grinding circuit, nickel flotation circuit including regrind, nickel 
concentrate thickening, filtration and storage, rail car/truck loadout, tailings thickening facility, 
reagents, and ancillary services (refer to Figure 18.1 for an illustration of the overall site layout). 

The layout of the plant and all associated facilities was designed to restrict impact to only the St. 
Lawrence watershed. The boundary between the St. Lawrence and Arctic watershed is shown 
on Figure 18.1. Any waste dumps are located at least 1 km from the Launay Esker. 

The site layout takes into account site topography and limits imposed by the locations of the pit, 
stockpiles and waste dumps subject to the above constraints. The grinding area is founded on 
bedrock to reduce civil costs and take advantage of gravity flow where possible. 

18.2 Site Power Supply 
Hydro Quebec (HQ) will provide electrical power to the mine site via a 10.5 km long, 120 kV 
overhead powerline to be constructed, that would be connected as a tee-off to an existing line. 
The line enters the property from the south near the security entrance gate, and runs up to the 
process plant main 120 kV substation.  

Both the initial and expansion phases of the Dumont project will require three 120:13.8 kV 
60/80 MVA ONAN/ONAF main transformers. The new 120 kV substation and six main 
transformers will be installed near the SAG mill feed conveyor. The 13.8 kV medium voltage 
network will be used for the primary electrical distribution and for feeding large loads such as 
the SAG mill and ball mills.  

The 13.8 kV distribution circuits run from the main electrical room E1 (located adjacent to 
120 kV outdoor substation) to secondary electrical rooms located close to the areas served. In 
these secondary electrical rooms, the 13.8 kV distribution voltage will be converted to 4.16 kV 
and 600 V using 13.8-4.16 kV and 13.8-0.6 kV indoor dry-type transformers. For the mine 
circuit, an isolation transformer 13.8-13.8 kV will be used to separate the neutral grounding 
circuit of the portable substations from the main plant ground system.

In case of power failure, two 13.8 kV emergency diesel generators will automatically start and 
supply power for all essential plant loads. The generators will be located at the main electrical 
room No. E1 conveniently located for distribution of power throughout the plant using the 
13.8 kV network. Uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) and DC battery systems will be 
provided in the various electrical rooms for essential protection and control equipment. 

Power factor correction equipment and harmonic filters will be located near the main electrical 
room and connected to the main 13.8 kV switchgear to ensure that the electrical load, as seen 
by HQ, meet their requirements. 

HQ will provide power during construction at 25 kV and will enter the site from the south near 
the security gate house. A temporary 25:13.8 kV substation will be located at the point where 
the line enters the site and power will be distributed to the rest of the site via 13.8 kV overhead 
lines which will be re-used for the permanent installation. 

18.3 Rail Spur  
A rail spur that services the process plant is proposed for the project. The total length of the rail 
spur is approximately 5 km. Fuel unloading is located near the mining truckshop, and the track 
extends north of the process plant to load concentrate.  

18.4 Roadways  
The Dumont on-site roads will be constructed of crushed waste rock available from site and 
naturally available materials. A dedicated mobile aggregate crushing plant will be utilized for the 
entire life of project (including the period post ex-pit operation, when stockpiles are being 
reclaimed) to provide aggregate for continually resurfacing haul roads.  

18.5 Process Plant  
The process plant area consists of the crushing facility, covered stockpile and process plant 
building. The overall process plant enclosed structure is approximately 350 m long, and consists 
of four connected buildings: grinding, flotation and magnetic separation, cleaning and 
scavenging, and concentrate thickening. These are described below. 

The primary crushing facility is closely located to the open pit, to the east. The crushed ore is 
conveyed to a covered stockpile, which is approximately 40 m high x 96 m diameter. The 
crushed ore conveyor from the crushed ore tunnel to the crushed ore transfer station is 
approximately 200 m long. The stockpile feed conveyor feed conveyor extends a further 800 m 
from the transfer station to the stockpile.  

From the covered stockpile, the ore is conveyed via apron feeders, through a reclaim tunnel, 
and a 280 m long SAG mill feed conveyor into the grinding area. The feed to the SAG mill is at 
90°, which helps reduce the size of the grinding building. The grinding building consists of a 
SAG mill, two ball mills, a regrind mill, desliming cyclones and an overhead crane. It is 121 m 
long x 81 m wide x 47 m high. The grinding area electrical room E3 is connected at the east 
side. The plant control room will be located at an elevated position adjacent to the hydrocyclone 
cluster, and will be have aluminum-framed windows for viewing into the process plant. In 
particular, the grinding and flotation areas will be easily viewable from the control room. The 
lunch room is located below the control room. 

The slimes and nickel flotation building is north of the grinding circuit. It contains the slimes 
flotation, nickel roughers cells, magnetic separators, two overhead cranes, and is 138 m long x 
74 m wide x 29 m high. The reagents mixing area is connected to the west of the nickel flotation

building. The process air blowers, plant air compressors, and electrical room E4 are connected 
to the east side of the building. 

To the north of the flotation building is the cleaning and roughers building. It contains the nickel 
sulphide cleaner cells, awaruite roughers and cleaners cells, and one overhead crane that 
services the entire area. This building is 46 m long x 77 m wide x 22 m high. The electrical room 
E5 is located on the east side of the building. 

To the north of the cleaning and roughers building is the concentrate thickening building, which 
is 42 m long x 35 m wide x 19 m high. This building also contains the steam boiler. The water 
pumphouse and process water pond are west of the concentrate thickening building. The 88 m 
diameter tailings thickener is adjacent to the process water pond, on the south side.  

During the plant expansion in Year 5 of operations, a second train of the crushing facility, 
stockpile, grinding building, slimes and nickel flotation building, cleaning and roughers building, 
process water pond, and tailings thickener will be duplicated and built to the east of the original 
process plant. The concentrate thickener area is in between the two process buildings and will 
not need to be expanded.  

18.6 Waste Rock & Overburden Dumps, Low-Grade Ore & Reclaim Stockpiles 
The open pit mining operation will generate 1,338 Mt of overburden and waste rock and 606 Mt 
of low-grade ore that will be temporarily impounded in stockpiles. Waste rock will be utilized in 
the construction of various site facilities including, for example, the tailings dams, mine roads 
and rail lines. The balance will be stored in three waste rock dumps. Overburden from the open 
pit stripping will be used for reclamation, where applicable, with the balance stored in two 
overburden dumps (OB-1 and OB-2). Low-grade ore will be intermittently processed or stored in 
four low-grade ore stockpiles (LGO1, LGO2, LGO3a and LGO3b). Low-grade ore that is still 
stockpiled when mining ceases will be processed over the remaining project life.  

In addition, three reclaim stockpiles will store select overburden for subsequent use as cover 
material at the tailings storage facility. It is expected that the reclaim stockpiles will be depleted, 
reloaded and depleted multiple times during the project life.  

Figure 18.1 shows the location of the various dumps and stockpiles.  

18.6.1 Waste Rock Dumps 

Of the total waste rock volume, expected to be 540 Mm3, approximately 83 Mm3 of waste rock 
will be used in dam construction at the TSF cells, approximately 8 Mm3 will be used in the TSF 
key trenches, and approximately 18 Mm3 will be used elsewhere on site. The total waste rock 
storage requirement is, therefore, about 431 Mm3. The combined waste rock storage capacity 
can be met by the three dumps shown on Figure 18.1.  

WR-1, located in the northeastern part of the site, will have a capacity of 353 Mm3 (including ten 
clay cells) and is expected to have a final height of approximately 85 m. Approximately 46 Mm3 
of waste rock will be co-disposed with sand and gravel and clay within the main overburden 
dump (OB-1), which reaches an approximate height of 40 m.  The in-pit waste dump is located 
within the southeast extension of the open pit and will store approximately 53 Mm3. 

18.6.2 Overburden Dumps 

Two overburden dumps, separated by one of the main drainages, will be developed immediately 
east of the proposed open pit (Figure 18.1). The northernmost overburden pile (OB-1) will be 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

18-5 

  

38 m high and will store up to 123 Mm3 of material which includes 46 Mm3 of waste rock. The 
southeastern pile (OB-2) will be 40 m high and will store up to 17 Mm3 of material. 

Some of the overburden from these two stockpiles will be used as cover material during site 
reclamation, but most of the overburden will remain in place post-closure.  

18.6.3 Low-Grade Ore Stockpile 

Four stockpiles, LGO1, LGO2, LGO3a and LGO3b will be developed to store and periodically 
extract low-grade ore on a regular basis during the period of active mining. The maximum 
volume of low-grade ore that will require storage is estimated to be 263 Mm3. 

LGO1 is located north of the open pit and west adjacent to WR1 (Figure 18.1) and is expected 
to have an ultimate height of approximately 85 m at its peak storage volume of 209 Mm3. LGO2 
is located north west of the open pit and adjacent east to the mill plant (Figure 18.1), and is 
expected to have an ultimate height of approximately 60 m at peak storage volume of 50 Mm3. 
LGO3a and LGO3b is located within the northwest region of the open pit. LGO3a and b will be 
used for short-term ore storage during early mine development. 

18.6.4 Reclaim Stockpiles 

Three reclaim stockpiles (Reclaim 1, 2 and 3) are located between the TSF and open pit (Figure 
18.1). They are designed to temporarily store overburden, topsoil and organics for reclamation 
purposes. A portion of reclaim 3 will be used for clay and sand and gravel storage for TSF 
construction. All three stockpiles have an ultimate height of around 25 m. 

18.7 Tailings Storage Facility 
The TSF is located approximately 400 m west of the process plant and consists of two cells 
(see Figure 18.1). Cell 1 will be constructed first and will provide storage through approximately 
Year 6 of operations. Cell 2, situated immediately north of Cell 1, will provide storage from 
approximately the end of Year 6 through Year 22 of operations. 

The TSF is designed to store approximately 680 Mt of tailings; 142 Mt in Cell 1 and 538 Mt in 
Cell 2. Each of the two TSF cells will be developed in stages while the open pit is being mined. 
Once mining at the open pit has ceased, stockpiled ore will be processed for approximately 13 
years and those tailings, approximately 498 Mt, will be deposited in the open pit. 

18.7.1 General Description  

The two TSF cells will be constructed as ring dikes due to the subdued regional relief.  

The starter dam at TSF Cell 1 will provide storage for tailings produced during the first year of 
mineral processing, approximately 12 Mm3. Dam raises will be completed annually based on the 
centreline construction method and will provide storage for tailings produced over the next 
five years. In total, TSF Cell 1 will store approximately 108 Mm3 of tailings.  

TSF Cell 2 will be constructed using the same general methods as Cell 1. The Cell 2 starter 
dam will store approximately 29 Mm3 of tailings and the final dam will store a total of 408 Mm3 of 
tailings.  

18.7.2 Design Criteria  

The design criteria for the TSF are listed in Table 18-1.

Note:  1. Dam classification follows Canadian Dam Safety Guidelines 2007 Edition (CDA 2007). 2. The freeboard is 
assumed to be the "dry" freeboard between the dam crest and the maximum water level in the pond (the exposed 
tailings beach is assumed to have a slope of 2% and to extend from a point below the dam crest to a line a minimum of 
at least 2.5 m below the dam crest). 3. Dams at the TSF were designated with two classifications based on their 
corresponding failure consequences. 

18.7.3 Site Selection  

The selection of the FS TSF site was influenced by: 

• Potential impacts to the township of Launay as a result of dust and noise associated with 
mining, and particularly the deposition of waste rock and low-grade ore at their respective 
dump locations. Modelling indicated that these dumps should be sited as far as practical from 
Launay (i.e., north and northeast of the open pit, which led to siting the TSF to the west and 
northwest of the open pit). 

• Arctic watershed boundaries, wetlands, public infrastructure, foundation conditions and 
topographic relief constrain the location and footprint of the TSF. In order to keep the mine 
facilities in a single watershed, the TSF was sited on the St. Lawrence side of the boundary 
that separates the St. Lawrence and Arctic watersheds. To the west of the TSF, there are 
wetlands, which have been avoided to the maximum practical extent, due to their high 
environmental value.

• The CN rail line that bounds the southern limit of the TSF.  
• The TSF competes for space with other mine features, including the plant site, waste rock 

and overburden dumps, low-grade ore stockpiles, reclaimed soil stockpiles, project 
transportation corridors and water management facilities.  

• To the extent possible, the TSF utilizes bedrock outcrop and topographic highs for siting the 
TSF dams.  

18.7.4 Foundation Preparation beneath the Perimeter Dams 

The geotechnical database for the TSF area indicates that grey clay with a very soft to firm 
consistency is present along some sections of the proposed perimeter dams. In the event this 
material was to be left in place, stability analyses indicate the typical downstream slope of the 
perimeter dam would likely have to be in the order of 8H:1V to satisfy stability criteria. At this 
slope, and assuming that about 40% of the TSF perimeter is underlain by clay, the storage 
capacity of the TSF would be significantly impacted.  

It was concluded that a key trench developed by excavating the grey clay and replacing it with 
waste rock from mining operations would facilitate steepening of the downstream slope of the 
perimeter dams. Therefore, where clay is present beneath the dams, the clay within a specified 
portion of the dam footprint will be removed to expose firm bearing material, either the 
competent, dense sand and gravel stratum or, close to outcrops, bedrock. The area of the key 
trench is shown in Figure 18.2. 

The typical cross-section through the key trench will be between 3 m and 10 m deep, and 60 m 
to 120 m wide across the base, with cut slopes at 2H:1V. Since the key trench will be 
constructed in stages as the dam is raised, the dimensions of the key trench at any given stage 
will depend on the dam height and the clay thickness.  

The total excavation and replacement quantity is estimated to be 1.7 Mm3 for TSF Cell 1 and 
6 Mm3 for TSF Cell 2. The brown clay material excavated from the key trench will be used in 
construction of the TSF core or for reclamation, grey clay will be deposited with the overburden 
from the open pit stripping. The replacement material will be waste rock from the open pit, 
although it is possible that some sand and gravel from the overburden stripping at the open pit 
could be used.  

Foundation preparation outside the key trench, but beneath the dam footprint, will consist of 
logging, where necessary, grubbing of roots and stripping of the organic soils. The organic soils 
will be stockpiled for later use in TSF reclamation activities.  

18.7.5 Starter Dam Design 

18.7.5.1 TSF Cell 1 

A plan view of the TSF Cell 1 starter dam is shown in Figure 18.3. A typical Cell 1 cross-section 
is shown in Figure 18.4. Key trenches will be constructed in identified areas shown in Figure 
18.2. The Cell 1 starter dam will be constructed to a crest elevation of 331.5 m and a length of 
approximately 7.1 km. Where clay is present, the starter dam upstream slope will be 8H:1V with 
no key trench, while the downstream slope will be 2H:1V with a key trench. Where clay is 
absent, both slopes will be 2H:1V. A 6 m wide, vertical clay core will tie into the clay stratum or 
bedrock at the upstream limit of the key trench and will be extended to the top of the starter 
dam. A filter zone, also 6 m wide, will be constructed downstream of the clay core.

The total volume of the starter dam at TSF Cell 1 will include 5.2 Mm3 of waste rock and a 
combined clay core and gravelly silty sand filter volume of 1 Mm3. In addition, a 0.6 Mm3 of 
waste rock is required for key trench construction.  

18.7.5.2 TSF Cell 2 

Cell 2 starter dam will be constructed to a crest elevation of 338 m approximately 9.7 km in 
length, which will provide storage for Year 7 of the operation. The configuration of the starter 
dam will be similar to the Cell 1 starter, with a clay core, filter, and areas of key trench. 

The total volume of the starter dam at TSF Cell 2 will include 6.6 Mm3 of waste rock and a 
combined clay core and gravelly silty sand filter volume of 1.2 Mm3. The Cell 2 starter dam will 
include 6.6 Mm3 of waste rock, a combined core and filter volume of 1.2 Mm3, and 1.5 Mm3 of 
waste rock for key trench construction. 

18.7.6 Dam Raises & Final Dam 

The dams will be raised using the centreline construction method. Tailings will be spigotted from 
the perimeter dams in order to create a tailings beach between the dam and the interior pond. 
For each dam raise, waste rock will be placed over the existing dam and onto the upstream 
edge of the tailings beach, and a trench will then be excavated to install the clay core and filter 
zone (Figure 18.4 overleaf). Both of these zones will be carried up the dam as the dam is raised 
in 3 to 5 m lifts.  

The downstream slope of the TSF cells will be constructed at 2H:1V.  

It is expected that waste rock will be hauled to the TSF on a nearly continuous basis throughout 
the year. The clay core and filter zone will only be constructed when temperatures are above 
freezing.  

Construction scheduling details related to the dam raise will depend on the final mine plan.  

A number of access ramps will be built into the strategic locations in the downstream face of the 
dams for construction access. These ramps will be approximately 30 m wide, with a grade of 
12H:1V. Four ramps will be developed around Cell 1 and five at Cell 2.  

The final crest elevations will be 362 m and 390 m for TSF Cells 1 and 2, respectively. The total 
volume of material to construct Cell 1, including perimeter dams, core, filter, key trench, access 
ramps will be 31 Mm3. Cell 2 construction will require 79 Mm3 of material. 

18.7.7 In-Pit Tailings Disposal 

18.7.7.1 General 

When the mining operation is completed, the mill will continue to process the stockpiled ore for 
another 13 years. Approximately 498 Mt of tailings will be deposited into the open pit for 
permanent storage.

18.7.7.2 Operations  
Tailings will be discharged from one or more spigots at the northwest portion of the open pit. 
Perimeter discharge is considered unnecessary due to the fact that the available storage 
volume within the pit greatly exceeds the required tailings storage volume.  

At the end of mine life, the tailings water in the pit will be pumped out and treated prior to 
discharge to the Villemontel River. The open pit will then be allowed to fill with direct 
precipitation and runoff. Figure 18.5 shows a typical section at end of milling (approximately 
Year 33). 

18.7.8 Water Management 

18.7.8.1 General 

The water management plan at the TSF is largely controlled by the following factors: 

• The supernatant pool within the TSF will be separated from the perimeter dam by a tailings 
beach, and will be used to provide recycle water for the plant site. 

• Seepage through the TSF dam will be limited by the clay core, and seepage through the TSF 
foundation will be limited by the existing (or constructed) basal layer of clay. 

18.7.8.2 Water Pool & Water Return 

Under non-winter conditions, tailings will be deposited around the perimeter of the dam using a 
conventional spigot method to develop a tailings beach which separates the supernatant pool 
from the perimeter dams.  

Winter tailings deposition will utilize single point discharge into the supernatant pool 
(subaqueous) to fill the depression that is expected to form in the middle of each TSF cell. This 
will also mitigate the potential formation of ice within the tailings beach.  

Water for recycle will be obtained using a floating barge and pump and pipeline system. 

18.7.8.3 Seepage Collection 

Within the footprint of TSF cell 2, there are a number of relatively small areas where sand and 
gravel are exposed with no natural clay cover. A 0.5 m layer of clay will be placed over these 
areas to prevent tailings pore water from seeping into the natural groundwater system 
(Figure 18.2). 

A series of ditches leading to seven seepage collection sumps will be established around the 
external perimeter of the TSF. Pumps will be setup at each pond to convey this water back into 
the TSF for recycling, and thereby prevent contaminated water from potentially leaving the 
project area. Typically the sumps are rectangular, with length to width ratios of approximately 
3:1, dimensions ranging from 50 m to 500 m, and depths of 2 to 4 m. The seepage collection 
ditches will be 1.5 to 2.5 m deep, with a ditch bottom width between 0.5 m to 1.5 m and side 
slopes of 6H:1V (in soil) and 0.75H:1V (in bedrock). The layout of the seepage collection 
facilities is shown on Figure 18.1.

18.7.9 Tailings Delivery System 

The tailings delivery system will transport slurried tailings from processing plant to the TSF. 
The delivery system will be sized initially on the basis of a 52.5 kt/d operation and increase to 
105 kt/d. This will consist of 40 inch diameter HDPE (high density polyethylene) pipeline, 
approximately 4 km long. This pipeline will initially transport 4,407 m3/h of tailings to the TSF. A 
second line of the same size and length will be installed adjacent to this pipeline in order to 
meet the expansion to 105 kt/d during the sixth year of operation. The two pipelines will 
transport a combined total of 8,826 m3/h of tailings to the TSF. The tailings thickener underflow 
pumps will be on emergency power to prevent the lines from freezing in case of a power loss.  

18.7.10 Return Water Delivery System 

The return water delivery system for recycle water from the TSF has been sized on the basis of 
2,353 m3/h of water being pumped from the TSF to the Process Water Pond, for the initial 
52.5 kt/d operation. This system will consist of barge pumps and a 24 inch diameter HDPE 
pipeline, approximately 4 km long, adjacent to the tailings pipeline. A second line of the same 
size and length will be installed adjacent to this pipeline to meet the expansion to 105 kt/d 
during the sixth year of operation. The two water return lines will transport a combined total of 
4,628 m3/h. The pipelines will be heat traced at low points to prevent freezing.  

18.7.11 Closure  

TSF Cells 1 and 2 are to be reclaimed progressively and at the end of their respective 
operational lives.  

Soil covers at least 0.5 m thick will be established on the sides of the TSF perimeter dams. In 
the case of Cell 1, most of this cover will be placed at or near the end of its operational life, at 
the end of Year 6. At Cell 2, this will correspond to the end of Year 22, though it is anticipated 
the final downstream face of the perimeter dams will be in place well before then, making it 
possible to progressively cover most of the downstream face before Year 22.  

Soil covers approximately 0.5 m thick will also be established over the tailings surface of both 
TSF cells. The ponded water over the central part of the cell will be pumped to the open pit to 
facilitate consolidation and improve bearing capacity for equipment.  

The soil required for Cell 1 reclamation will be stored in two nearby stockpiles from active open 
pit stripping. When Cell 1 reclamation is completed, these stockpiles will be reloaded with 
material from stripping operations in preparation for Cell 2 reclamation.  

Engineered water management structures will be built in the cells to manage surface water 
runoff passively, and in a way that prevents erosion of the soil covers. 

Post closure, the quality of the water collected in the sumps will be monitored, and until quality 
requirements are met, water in the sumps will continue to be pumped to the water treatment 
plant. Once the water quality is deemed acceptable, the channels will be re-graded towards the 
open pit where possible. An outlet from the open pit reservoir will be constructed to direct 
excess water to the Villemontel River. The in-pit tailings storage will permanently maintain 
passive water cover. An engineered outflow channel will be constructed to control the water 
level within the pit. 

18.8 Truckshop & Warehouse Facilities  
A truck maintenance facility that will service the mining fleet is located west of the open pit and 
southwest of the process plant. For the initial 52.5 kt/d operation, only six truck bays will be 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

18-15 

  

required. During expansion, four additional truck bays will be added to meet the increase to the 
mining fleet. The fleet continues to expand as the length of hauls increases due to deepening of 
the pit and the facility will be progressively expanded to a total of 20 bays. The building type will 
be structural steel and covered in architectural cladding. The tire yard is located beside the 
truckshop. 

The warehouse will house mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, and general items. The 
warehouse structure will be contiguous to the plant maintenance workshop. Internal offices will 
be supplied adjacent to the warehouse for warehouse and maintenance staff. 

18.9 Assay Laboratory  
An assay laboratory and metallurgical lab, as well as offices are located approximately 30 m 
west of the process plant building. The labs will process samples from the mining and 
exploration operations, as well as the process plant.  

18.9.1 Administration Office Complex  

A single-storey administration building is located near the main site entrance gate. The building 
will have a reception area, offices, meeting rooms, a main conference room, medical clinic, 
kitchenette and washrooms. The offices will be for managers, engineers, geologists, and clerks. 
A parking lot and transport and pick-up turnaround area are located adjacent to the 
administration building. 

18.9.2 Sewage Treatment  

The sewage treatment plant is located approximately 150 m northeast of the main 
administration building. The sewage sludge builds up at the bottom of the clarifier tank and is 
removed by a vacuum truck every six to nine months when full. The sludge is then transported 
and deposited into the municipal garbage dump landfill.  

Treated sewer effluent is pumped to the process water storage pond.  

18.10 Water Supply & Distribution  
The process water storage pond (Figure 18.1) lies north of the tailings thickener and supplies 
the process plant with the majority of its water requirement. The process water pond is fed from 
overflow from the tailings thickener and concentrate thickener, as well as from return water from 
the TSF1 (TSF2 for the expansion phase). The water return HDPE pipeline feeding the process 
water pond is 24 inches in diameter and approximately 4 km long. 

The process water pond is designed for a volume of approximately 20,000 m3 and a two-hour 
retention time for the 52.5 kt/d case. For expansion to 105 kt/d, a second process water pond of 
the same size is added.  

18.10.1 Raw Water  

Raw water is retrieved from the SER and pumped to the raw water storage tank located 
adjacent to the tailings thickener. From the raw water storage tank, the raw water is pumped to 
various users throughout the process plant, including the reagent area and all pump gland 
seals.  

18.10.2 Potable Water  

Fresh water will be supplied by local wells and will be treated with a reverse osmosis unit to 
produce potable water for drinking, cooking and showers. It will also be used for emergency 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

18-16 

  

shower and eyewash stations throughout the plant. The reverse osmosis concentrate (brine 
retentate) is pumped to a local area sump and periodically pumped back into the process circuit. 

18.10.3 Fire Water  

Fire water is contained in the raw water storage tank. The total volume of the tank is 2,500 m3, 
of which 1,000 m3 is designated for fire water and 1,500 m3 for raw water distribution. Level 
controls will assure that the level of the tank does not fall below the 1,000 m3 volume mark. 

During expansion to 105 kt/d, a second, smaller raw water storage tank will be added, providing 
an additional 1,500 m3 in volume. 

18.11 Fuel Supply, Storage & Distribution  
The initial 52.5 kt/d maximum diesel fuel consumption will be 50,000 L/d and increases steadily 
to 122,000 L/d at the time of expansion. The fuel farm has been sized to allow for surge. It is 
recommended that approximately one week storage be provided for a total of 854,000 L. The 
diesel fuel is required primarily for the mining fleet. A single diesel fuel tank volume is 
150,000 L; therefore, six tanks will be required every week for periods of maximum 
consumption.  

The diesel fuel tanks will be above-ground, horizontal, cylindrical tanks inside a rectangular 
secondary containment casing. The tankers can be unloaded and loaded three times each 
week, as per the rail schedule at the fuel delivery track. The fuel tanks and fuel dispensing 
pumps are located adjacent to the truck maintenance facility for easy access to the mining fleet.  

In addition, there is one 35,000 L regular gasoline double-walled storage tank for cars, pickup 
trucks, and other site vehicles. 

After the plant expansion to 105 kt/d, the fuel farm will be expanded to eleven tanks 
(1,650,000 L), providing over five days of storage for the year of peak consumption. 

18.12 Transportation & Shipping  
The concentrate loadout area is located at the north end of the process plant. Concentrate is 
stockpiled adjacent to the concentrate loadout rail spur. The nickel concentrate is loaded onto 
rail cars using a front-end loader (FEL). Fibreglass rail car covers are easily removed with a 
mobile crane and placed south of the rail spur during loading procedures, and quickly bolted 
back into place on completion. These will be loaded at the plant site or a transfer facility from a 
stockpile with FELs. They will be unloaded either in Sudbury with overhead mechanical scoops, 
or at the Port of Quebec.  

Nickel concentrate initial peak throughput will be 142 kt/a (based on 16 t/h nominal plant 
capacity and 92% availability). Based on a minimum of three services per week, outgoing traffic 
will consist of ten 99 tonne wagons to be loaded over two days. A normal FEL (e.g., CAT 980) 
will have a productivity of 300 t/h. Therefore, only three to four hours of operation every two 
days will be required to load ten wagons. 

A trade-off study was conducted to compare the costs of transporting nickel concentrate by 
truck and by rail. It was decided to include a rail spur, although the cheapest option was a truck-
rail combination, where concentrate is trucked to an existing transfer facility in Rouyn-Noranda 
for furtherance by rail to Sudbury. The desire to have an option of sending concentrate to 
Quebec City necessitated the rail spur, since trucking that far is much more expensive. Other 
deciding factors were the fact that the rail spur can also utilized to deliver fuel, reagents and

consumables, and explosives supplies. The emulsion plant is not installed until Year 2, and until 
then is trucked to site, likely from existing facilities in Malartic or Val d'Or, both of which are 
within 100 km. 

Concentrate that is sent to the Port of Quebec by rail would be transferred via ship to a port in 
China or Finland.  

18.13 Construction Camps  
A permanent mining camp will not be required. All labour can be sourced or housed in Amos 
and within the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. 

18.14 Site Security 
All entrants to the plant site must pass through the security guardhouse located at the front 
gate. The entrance to the site, separating the plant site from Highway 111, is fenced with 
approximately 5.5 km of chain-link security fencing. The explosives area and emulsion plant 
(built during the expansion phase) is also fenced for security. A locked gate blocks the road 
from Launay from the explosives area, as shown on Figure 18.1. The plant site is not fenced on 
the western, eastern and northern sides to allow access for snowmobiling.  

18.15 Communications  

18.15.1 Enterprise Ethernet Networking  

The Enterprise Ethernet Network system will include all the necessary cabling, router, firewall 
and accessories required to transmit data within the plant, as well as provide communication 
with the external links. 

IT rooms in the administrative building will contain equipment for off-site communication. Other 
equipment, such as a patch panel and repeater, will be located in remote electrical rooms or in 
local communication cabinets. 

Restricted access to the IT room will be enforced by means of access control cards and video 
monitoring. 

Firewalls and routers will allow communication within the different systems and users within the 
premises, while preventing intrusion to sensible data from outside. System servers will be used 
to collect and save data from the different systems. 

The administrative network, by means of dedicated fibre optic and Cat6 cables, will service all 
major buildings to support telephone, intercom, process CCTV, and access systems, as well as 
providing a link from the process network to the external internet. 

The process network, by means of redundant dedicated fibre optic cables and copper cabling, 
will service all the buildings where process control equipment is located. 

18.15.2 Process Control System  

The process control system will consist of a redundant operation station located in the main 
control room. Other non-redundant control stations will be located in each electrical room. 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

18-18 

  

Process controllers, input/output (I/O) cabinets and human-machine interface (HMI) will be 
located in electrical rooms or control cabinets as part of the equipment package (e.g., crusher, 
blower and air compressor systems).  

Communication between the processor and remote I/O cabinet will be redundant; 
communication with other equipment—such as the package controller, MCC and switchgear—
will be non-redundant. 

18.15.3 Telephone & Intercom System  

The telephone and intercom system will allow direct communication between different areas and 
buildings throughout the plant. 

The intercom or public announcement equipment will be installed in noisy areas or outside of 
buildings, where a telephone set is not practical.  

The telephone and intercom systems will use IP addressing. The telephone management 
system will provide functions such as call directory, forwarding, messaging, usage statistics, call 
transferring, etc. 

18.16 Surface Water Management System 

18.16.1 Water Management Plan 

The water management plan must facilitate the operation of the mine development through a 
wide range of climatic conditions, while at the same time protecting the environment. The prime 
objectives of the water management plan will be to: 

• provide a reliable water supply to the concentrator; 

• facilitate mining of the ore deposit by limiting inflows to the open pit and by timely removal of 
groundwater discharges and precipitation falling on the incremental catchment of the open 
pit; 

• provide sediment control; 

• collect and treat contact water that would otherwise impair water quality of receiving streams; 
and 

• protect mine infrastructure during extreme flood events. 

The water management plan revolves around changes throughout the mine life, which is broken 
into five main phases: 

• Phase 1—Construction 

• Phase 2—Low Ore Production 

• Phase 3—High Ore Production 

• Phase 4—Milling Low-grade Ore Stockpiles 

• Phase 5—Closure. 

Each phase incorporates diversion structures, sump and pump systems, sedimentation ponds, 
and reservoirs that manage contact and impacted contact water separately as the overall 
surface area or footprint of the mine expands.

18.16.2 Contact Water Diversions 

All surface water runoff which comes in contact with disturbed areas, other than tailings, is 
considered to be contact water. The contact water will require removal of high suspended 
sediment as a treatment procedure. This water includes any runoff from the waste rock, 
overburden or low-grade ore stockpiles, and water pumped from the open pit. 

Development of the ore deposit will require the diversions of both West Creek and East Creek 
around the ultimate footprint of the open pit. Because the drainage areas of these two streams 
are not extremely large, the diversions could be implemented using either a pump and pipeline 
system or an open channel.  

The East and West Creek will be replaced by three major open channels, which will route 
surface water away from the open pit and towards the southeast reservoir. Two channels will be 
located east of the waste rock and overburden stockpiles, identified as the north and south 
waste rock channels, which will collect runoff from the stockpiles and prevent sediment-laden 
water from entering the Arctic watershed. The third channel will be located between the eastern 
edge of the open pit and the western edge of the waste rock and overburden piles, identified as 
the east pit channel.  

A total of 14 sumps will be situated in low elevation areas throughout the East Creek and West 
Creek catchment area, where water flow by gravity conveyance is not feasible. Each sump 
collects a combination of surface water runoff from various site facilities, seepage from the 
tailings dams, and from direct precipitation, and will be implemented at various times throughout 
the development of the mine site. Seven of the sumps will collect non-impacted contact water, 
and will be pumped to one of the three major channels and ultimately end up in the southeast 
reservoir. 

The contact water will be collected in the southeast reservoir, where it can be accessed by the 
concentrator for reclaim or as a raw water source. The open pit will also pump water to the 
southeast reservoir through an oil separator. 

18.16.3 Impacted Contact Water Diversions 

Surface water runoff that comes into contact with tailings is considered "impacted contact 
water." Any impacted contact water excess will be treated in the water treatment plant, separate 
from the contact water. This water, which includes runoff and seepage from the tailings dams, 
will be collected by a network of channels and seven sumps situated around the TSF cells, and 
will be pumped back into the active TSF. The concentrator will reclaim as much of the TSF 
water as possible to minimize the requirement for treatment of the impacted contact water. 

18.16.4 Sedimentation Pond 

Sedimentation ponds 1 and 2 are located south of the TSF and are assumed for modelling 
purposes to have capacities of approximately 1 Mm³ each. Excess water from these ponds 
reports either to the water treatment plant or Villemontel River. The sedimentation ponds will be 
in place early in the construction phase and will capture and treat disturbed area runoff for high 
suspended solids throughout the construction phase.  

Sedimentation pond 1 is located east of the lower reach of the Unnamed Creek, and receives 
excess water from the TSF via sump 6, along with local runoff and direct precipitation. The local 
runoff may contain high sediment water during the construction phase from the disturbed areas. 
Water from sedimentation pond 1 is assumed to be impacted contact water upon the activation

18-20 

  

of TSF cell 1, and is the feed pond for the water treatment plant. Excess water in sedimentation 
pond 1 is pumped back to the active tailings facility for storage and potential reclaim. 

Sedimentation pond 2 receives excess water from the open pit area during construction, excess 
water from the southeast reservoir prior to the start of LGO stockpile milling, water from sump 9 
during construction, local runoff and direct precipitation. The pond will treat for high TSS (total 
suspended solids) concentrations.  In addition, a CO2 sparging system will be installed within 
the sedimentation pond to treat the water for high pH, before discharging to the Villemontel 
River. 

The sedimentation ponds were sized for the 1:10-year return period flows and for a sediment 
threshold value of 0.01 mm. In order to minimize their footprint within the lower mine area, the 
depth of the sedimentation ponds has been set at 6 m, and the length to width ratio is 3 to 1, 
respectively. Both ponds are situated south of the railway and open pit, and north of the 
administration building. 

18.16.5 Tailings Storage Facility 

The TSF will serve two key roles in the management of water at the mine. Firstly, runoff 
generated within the catchment of the TSF, available water within the tailings slurry, and the 
associated TSF seepage collection system will provide an important source of water for the 
concentrator. Secondly, the pond within the TSF will serve as the single largest live storage for 
water at the mine during operations. A large live storage will be required to meet the demand of 
the concentrator (i.e., temporarily store water during wet periods for subsequent use in the 
concentrator during dry periods). If excess water exists in the system, then the pond can be 
relieved by discharging the excess for treatment. 

Excess water from cells 1 and 2 will be pumped to the concentrator or to sump 6, depending 
upon concentrator's water demand. From Sump 6, water will be conveyed to sedimentation 
pond 1 and subsequently to the water treatment plant prior to discharge to the Villemontel River. 

The largest inflow to the TSF will be the tailings slurry. The largest withdrawal will be outputs of 
reclaimed water for the concentrator. Water inflows to the TSF will also include local runoff, 
pumped flows from the surrounding sumps and direct precipitation. Other outflows include 
evaporation, seepage to groundwater and loss of water to tailings voids. 

Freeboard for TSF cell 1 is 1.0 m and the freeboard for TSF cell 2 is 2.0 m. When the water 
level in the TSF exceeds the freeboard level, the excess water pumps are activated, and the 
water is drawn down until the water level has dropped below the allowable water limit, which is 
set to 1.0 m below the freeboard limit. 

Most of the water which will seep through the base of the TSF will flow to the open pit. TSF 
seepage that may flow west towards the Launay esker, north towards the Chicobi River or south 
towards the Villemontel River has been modelled by Golder and results were presented in the 
report entitled Solute Transport Modelling of Tailings Storage Facility, RNC Dumont Project, 
Quebec (Golder, 2013b).  

Three two-dimensional cross-sectional models were constructed to represent the groundwater 
flow paths between the TSF and the potential receptors: the Launay Esker to the west; the 
Villemontel River to the south; and, the Chicobi River to the north. Arsenic, chloride, and nitrite 
were identified as species of interest for the transport models, based on their anticipated 
concentrations in tailings pond water relative to the applicable groundwater criteria. 
Contaminant transport simulations were completed for both operations and post operations

conditions. Various simulations were completed for each cross-section to evaluate the 
sensitivity of model results to various factors.  The numerical modelling results demonstrate that 
the proposed design of the TSF will not affect compliance with the groundwater protection 
objectives at the potential receptors, as outlined in Directive 019 (Golder, 2013b). 

Further details are provided in Section 18.7.8.  

18.16.6 Collection System for Waste Rock Dump Runoff 

Preliminary geochemical analyses indicate that the waste rock and the low-grade ore stockpiles 
will not be acid generating and will not require treatment in a water treatment plant before being 
discharged offsite. Channels will be constructed along the outer limits of the stockpiles to 
capture sediment-laden runoff water and route surface water flows to a network of sumps and 
reservoirs (Figure 18.1). 

East of the waste rock and overburden piles, two channels will route runoff to the southeast 
reservoir, the north waste dump channel and the south waste dump channel. West of the waste 
rock and overburden piles, the east pit channel will also route runoff to the southeast reservoir.  

The LGO stockpiles will evolve in size and shape over time across the ground surfaces that are 
north of the pit. Three sumps will collect runoff from around these areas and will discharge water 
to the east pit channel, and eventually to the southeast reservoir. 

It is assumed that all of the infiltration into the stockpiles from rainfall will eventually report to the 
southeast reservoir. 

18.16.7 Water Treatment  

Impacted contact water is directed to the sedimentation pond 1. This includes excess water 
from the TSF, which is collected in Sump 6 prior to the sedimentation pond 1, TSF dam 
seepage collected in ditches along the southeast corner of the TSF, and local runoff.  

A CO2 sparging system is adjacent to sedimentation pond 2 to treat high pH values. The 
sparging system consists of a CO2 pressurized tank, a pipe manifold and piping which extends 
to the sedimentation pond. If pH levels are high, CO2 sparging system is activated (bubbling) to 
reduce it to meet environmental standards. Discharge of treated water is released to the 
Villemontel River.  

After the expansion phase, in 2022, a water treatment plant will be installed due to possible high 
levels of arsenic and other elements. The water will only need to be treated when the water 
level in the TSF's cells exceeds the specified freeboard level. The withdrawal rate from the 
sedimentation pond 1 will be equivalent to the WTP capacity, which was optimized with the 
water balance model to prevent uncontrolled discharges of impacted contact water to the 
Villemontel River. The plant will operate at a capacity of 0.7 m³/s and will discharge via pipeline 
to the Villemontel River as required.

19 MARKET STUDIES & CONTRACTS 

19.1 Nickel & Stainless Steel Market Outlook 
According to the long-term outlook (March 2013) by the Metals Market Service, Wood 
Mackenzie forecasts that global nickel consumption will increase by 6.4% in 2013 to 1.83 Mt; 
and by 4.7% per year to 2.1 Mt in 2016; and 2.7% per year thereafter to 2.74 Mt in 2030. Both of 
the two main consumption sectors, stainless and non-stainless, are expected to grow strongly in 
the future. 

Primary nickel demand in stainless steel is projected to increase to just under 2 Mt by 2030 
driven by growth in global stainless melt output of 5% per annum to 44.6 Mt until 2017 with 
further growth of 3% per annum to 65.4 Mt until 2030. The bulk of this growth will be supported 
by the continued expansion of the Chinese stainless steel industry. 

RNC management believes that potential for growth in nickel is even higher than forecasted by 
Wood Mackenzie driven by the Chinese economy as it continues to evolve towards value-added 
products. As shown in the chart below, if nickel demand in China is able to reach similar per 
capita consumption levels as industrial economies like Germany and Japan as China has been 
able to achieve in carbon steel, it would add more than 1 Mt of nickel demand per year to a total 
of 1.6 Mt per year by 2020. Given that carbon steel demand in China continues to grow and now 
exceeds Germany and Japan per capita consumption levels, the potential for growth in Chinese 
nickel demand could be even higher than the 1Mt currently forecast.

19.2 Price Assumptions 
Pricing assumptions were developed for nickel and the cobalt, platinum, and palladium 
byproducts contained in the Dumont concentrate based on forecasts as of May 31, 2013 from 
the four analysts, of the five analysts who cover RNC, who publish commodity price forecasts. 
As the expected timing for the project, now falls within the short-term forecast of those analysts, 
annual price forecasts for nickel are used for 2015, 2016, and 2017 with a single long-term 
forecast for the remaining years. For the byproduct metals – cobalt, palladium, and platinum, a 
single price was used for each year. Table 19-1 summarizes the pricing assumptions.  

Table 19-1:  Pricing Assumptions in USD 

  2015 2016 2017 Long-Term 

Nickel US$/lb $10.00 $10.00 $10.50 $9.00 

Cobalt US$/lb $14.00 $14.00 $14.00 $14.00 

Platinum  US$/oz $1,800 $1,800 $1,800 $1,800 

Palladium US$/oz $700 $700 $700 $700 

 

A long-term nickel price assumption of $9.00 per pound was utilized in the study which is 
consistent with the average long-term nickel price of $9.30 per pound forecast by the four 
analysts and the three-year trailing average nickel price to 31 May 2013 which averaged $9.08 
per pound. 

Figure 19.2:  LME Quarterly Cash Nickel Price 

 

The metal price assumption for platinum of $1,800 per ounce was consistent with the average 
RNC analyst forecasts for the long-term of $1,793 per ounce and a 2015-2017 range of $1,853 
to $1.877 per ounce. The metal price assumption for palladium of $700 per ounce for 
palladium was consistent with the average RNC analyst forecast for the long-term of $667 per 
ounce and a 2015-2017 range of $712 to $775 per ounce. The metal price assumption for

cobalt of $14 per pound was consistent with the average RNC analyst forecasts for the long-
term of $13.88 per pound and a 2015-2017 range of $14.17 to $14.29 per pound. All 
sensitivities for these pricing assumptions are provided in Section 22. 

19.3 Concentrate Marketing 
The Dumont concentrate, which will have an average nickel content of 29% nickel over the life 
of project and recoverable quantities of cobalt, platinum, and palladium, is expected to be 
among the highest grade nickel concentrates in the world which should make it a desirable 
product to nickel smelters globally. The MgO content of this concentrate is expected to be 
between 7% and 10%, which is in line with the MgO content in concentrates produced by other 
ultramafic operations. 

Assumptions regarding commercial terms for this concentrate have been based on benchmark 
rates and include: 

• percentage payable of 93% nickel; 

• base treatment charge of $150/t, with an additional penalty of $25/t of concentrate for the 
MgO content; 

• base refining charge of $0.70/lb of nickel; 

• price participation of 10% with a base price of $8.00/lb; 

• payable percentage on contained cobalt of 50% and a refining charge of $3/lb; and 

• payable percentage on contained platinum and palladium based on a 1 g/t deduction, and 
average 77% for the concentrate grade of 4.3 g/t PGE over the over the life of project with a 
refining charge of $50/oz. 

The concentrate will be transported by existing road, rail and port facilities to the smelters. In the 
feasibility study, 50% of the concentrate is assumed to be processed by the Sudbury smelters at 
a transportation cost of $41/t. The remaining 50% of the concentrate will be transported to 
Quebec City at a cost of $36/t with half of the concentrate (25% of total) shipped to a smelter in 
Finland at a transportation cost of US$40/t, and the remaining half of the concentrate (25% of 
the total) shipped to smelters in China at a transportation cost of US$79/t. All sensitivities for 
these pricing assumptions are provided in Section 22. 

Forward sales metal prices in terms of potential contracts are based on experience from actual 
similar operations and general knowledge. Unlike copper and other metals, there are no 
benchmark pricing for treatment and refining charges. No direct marketing has been done for 
the potential Dumont concentrates and therefore no off-take agreements exist. The final 
distribution and pricing terms on the Dumont concentrate will be determined only once the off- 
take agreements have been signed. 

Based on current industry demands, it is envisioned that the nickel concentrates would be best 
suited for several smelters—two smelters in Canada owned by Vale and Xstrata, the Harjavlta 
smelter in Finland owned by Boliden, and the Jinchuan smelter in China. The company has also 
completed a separate study that demonstrates the viability of processing the concentrate 
through a combination of a fluid bed roaster and electric arc furnace and recently announced a 
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Tsingshan Holding Group Co., Ltd. The MOU sets 
out the objectives of the two companies to work together in relation to downstream concentrate 
processing and the potential to enter into an offtake and/or partnership arrangement with 
respect to the Dumont project. After working in cooperation with RNC for more than a year, 
Tsingshan completed its own analysis and testwork on a sulphide nickel concentrate (utilizing a

process similar to the one previously announced by RNC in the news release dated October 3, 
2011) in its integrated NPI/stainless steel production facilities and plans to make the necessary 
investment in plant and equipment once concentrate feed is secured. This innovation represents 
the first time that nickel sulphide concentrate would be used directly to create stainless steel. 
This contemplated plant is also expected to be capable of handling nickel sulphide concentrate 
like that anticipated from Dumont. 

Overviews of the various smelters that are believed to have the highest potential to process the 
Dumont concentrate are provided in the subsequent section. 

19.4 Smelter Options 
There are currently 11 nickel smelters globally, while a twelfth unit that will also treat sulphide 
concentrates is under construction (the Vale facility in Newfoundland). Brief profiles of the most 
likely smelters are provided in the subsections below. 

19.4.1 Xstrata 

The Xstrata smelter located in Falconbridge (a suburb of Sudbury) currently treats concentrates 
produced by Xstrata's operations located in the Sudbury basin (the bulk coming from the Nickel 
Rim South mine) and in Quebec (Raglan), as well as from third parties. 

The smelter uses electric furnace technology, which is more suitable for treating concentrates 
containing elevated levels of MgO. The average MgO content of feed is understood to be higher 
than the MgO level of feed treated at Vale's Copper Cliff facility, but is primarily due to Raglan, 
and should thus decrease as production from Nickel Rim South ramps up. Due to the depletion 
of other Sudbury basin mines and limited additional third party concentrates, the smelter is 
believed to be currently operating less than full capacity of 76 kt/a. It is believed that Xstrata has 
no significant sulphide mine development projects underway to provide additional concentrate 
feed in the next 5 to 7 years. 

Matte produced by the Falconbridge smelter is shipped to the Nikkelverk refinery in Norway. 
Overall cobalt recovery through the smelter and refinery is approximately 70%. 

19.4.2 Vale 

Vale's main smelter is located at Copper Cliff, which is another suburb of Sudbury. The smelter 
uses flash smelting technology, which is less suitable for treating concentrates containing 
elevated levels of MgO. However, the large capacity of the facility coupled with the high Ni 
grade of Dumont concentrate would result in concentrates from Dumont representing a small 
portion of the total feed tonnage. Furthermore, Vale's own Sudbury basin mines typically 
produce concentrates with low MgO. As a result, it should be possible to treat Dumont 
concentrate at Copper Cliff without exceeding MgO limits. 

19.4.3 Boliden/Norilsk 

Boliden currently operates the Harjavalta flash smelter in Finland. Harjavalta is part of a 
polymetallic complex that treats separate copper and nickel concentrates. Output from the 
smelter is refined at the adjacent Harjavalta Refinery, which is owned by Norilsk. The Harjavalta 
smelter has a capacity of ~40 kt/a of contained nickel and is understood to be operating at 
significantly less than design levels. It would thus have capacity for a significant percentage of 
Dumont concentrate. It is understood that the smelter can be expanded by converting the 
copper processing to nickel processing for a relatively minimal capital investment. The smelter 
can accommodate some quantity of MgO bearing concentrates. The Harjavalta refinery owned

Date:  25 July 2013 

19-5 

  

by Norilsk has a capacity of ~ 65 kt/a and is beginning to receive direct intermediate feeds from 
Talvivaara. The complex achieves high recoveries for cobalt. 

19.4.4 Jinchuan 

Jinchuan operates an integrated smelting and refining facility in Gansu Province, China. 

The smelter currently has a capacity of ~120 kt/a contained nickel, while the refinery has a 
capacity of ~150 kt/a contained nickel. Over 40% of the concentrate feed to the Jinchuan 
smelter currently comes from third party sources. Given our understanding of their mine 
production profile, Jinchuan will have the capability to take MgO bearing feeds and will continue 
to need third-party concentrates to fill its smelting and refining capacity.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING & COMMUNITY IMPACT 
The information presented in this section originates principally from the Environmental and 
Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) performed as part as the Dumont project permitting process 
and integrates a number of studies performed by RNC and its consultants over the past five 
years. Biophysical data came mainly from three distinct fieldwork programs performed from 
2007 to 2009, with some complementary information extracted from the ongoing baseline 
studies designed to support the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment in 2011 and 
2012. Table 20-1 summarizes the sources of information for the various biophysical and social 
components described in this report.

20.1 Description of Biophysical Components 

20.1.1 Climate 

The climate at the Dumont property is continental; mean temperatures ranging from -17.3°C in 
January to +17.2°C in July, with an annual mean temperature of 1.2°C. Annual precipitation 
totals about 918 mm:  670 mm of rain and 248 cm of snow. Mean calculated evaporation from 
lakes ranges from 2.0 to 4.2 mm for the months of June to September inclusively. A weather 
station installed onsite since June 2011 recorded wind speed ranging from 0 to 10 km/h, with 
gust speed peaking at 28 km/h. The average wind direction corresponds to a northwestern 
wind. 

20.1.2 Drainage System & Hydrology 

The local study zone is located in the St. Lawrence River watershed, which includes the 
Villemontel and Kinojévis Rivers. It is at the boundary with the James Bay watershed.  

The vast majority of the study zone drains into the Villemontel River. This river connects with the 
Kinojévis River, which flows into the Ottawa River in the St. Lawrence watershed. The slope of 
the Villemontel River, between its confluence with unnamed stream 1 and the zone of influence 
of the Kinojévis River (27.9 km downstream), is 0.03%, representing an elevation drop of only 
8.8 m between these two points. It flows in steps—a succession of waterbodies of constant 
elevation controlled by sills or beaver dams. During the month of August 2012, the streamflow 
measured in the Villemontel River ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 m3/s (severe low water level). 

Unnamed stream 1, a tributary of the Villemontel River, is the principal watercourse that will be 
affected by the project. At its mouth, where it empties into the Villemontel River, unnamed 
stream 1 drains a total area of 50 km2. The average slope of this watercourse is 0.3%. 

Two other watercourses, Ruisseau Paré and unnamed stream 2, are found in the study zone. 
These streams empty directly into the Villemontel River, just upstream from unnamed stream 1. 

20.1.3 Hydrogeology 

Four hydrostratigraphic units were identified in the study zone: 

• glaciolacustrine deposits; 

• fluvioglacial deposits; 

• tills; and 

• bedrock. 

The fluvioglacial deposits are concentrated in the eskers, which form elongated sand deposits, 
all oriented in a northwest/southeast direction. With respect to the Dumont project, they are 
found to the west (Launay esker), at its centre (unnamed esker) and to the east (Saint-Mathieu-
Berry esker). 

Two major aquifer eskers, the Launay and Saint-Mathieu-Berry eskers, are exposed at surface 
in the study zone and in neighbouring areas. A third significantly smaller fluvioglacial deposit, 
the unnamed esker, borders the southern part of the study zone and is adjacent to the projected 
pit. 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

20-4 

  

The water in the bedrock and the overburden of the study zone, other than the water in the 
eskers, is considered to come from Class II hydrogeological formations according to the 
MDDEFP's classification scheme (MDDEFP,1999), as they are used only locally to supply water 
to private properties along Highway 111. The Launay and unnamed eskers are Class I 
hydrogeological formations. These formations can supply a sufficient quantity of water of 
satisfactory quality and, in case of need, could constitute a source of supply for a community. 

The groundwater in the overburden and the bedrock generally flows in the same directions:  
from northwest to southeast in the western part of the study zone and from north to south in the 
eastern part. Flow directions are consistent with local topography and surface waterflow. 

The groundwater level is generally near the surface of the soil, at a depth of less than one 
metre, except in the areas of the unnamed and Launay eskers, where the piezometric level is 
deeper.  

Groundwater velocities are around 0.6 m/a to 1.1 m/a in the overburden and 7.8 m/a to 15.3 m/a 
in the near-surface bedrock. The flow velocities do not exceed 0.06 m/a in the deep bedrock 

20.1.4 Groundwater Quality 

The groundwater quality in the study zone is generally good. Only a few of the analyzed 
parameters show exceedances, sometimes point-source exceedances, of the seepage in 
surface water and stormwater system criteria (RESIE) or of the criteria for drinking water 
(CESAFC), and then only in certain observation wells. These parameters are arsenic, copper, 
manganese, nickel, zinc and pH. 

20.1.5 Surface Water Quality  

In general, the surface water of the local study zone is slightly alkaline (pH most often slightly 
higher than 7.0) and moderately hard (total hardness most often between 17 and 57 mg/L). It is 
rich in organic carbon, which is mainly found in dissolved form, at concentrations ranging 
between 4 and 28 mg/L. The turbidity is highly variable from one station to another, and high 
values, reaching nearly 30 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), were measured in some 
samples. 

The sampled stations are separated into three distinct groups based on surface water 
characteristics. The Villemontel River differs from the other watercourses in several regards. Its 
water is harder and its major ion concentration is higher, which translates into a specific 
conductance about twice as high as other stations.  

Among the measured nutrients, the total phosphorus concentrations are sometimes very high 
(up to 0.10 mg/L), frequently exceeding the criterion proposed by the Canadian Council of 
Ministers of the Environment and the MDDEFP, which is intended to prevent eutrophization of 
water bodies. Exceedances were observed at all stations, which is evidence of eutrophic 
aquatic environments.  

Among the measured metals, the aluminium concentrations are especially high. They generally 
exceed the MDDEFP's chronic aquatic life toxicity criterion of 0.087 mg/L. In November 2009, 
they also exceeded the acute aquatic life toxicity criterion (0.75 mg/L) in five out of seven 
samples. The exceedance of the chronic aquatic life toxicity criterion is not rare in northern 
Québec, but the exceedance of the acute aquatic life toxicity criterion is less frequent.  

The iron concentrations regularly exceed chronic aquatic life toxicity criterion.

20.1.6 Sediment Quality 

The total chromium concentration in the sediments generally exceeds the rare effect level (REL) 
of the Québec criteria, for all sampling years. In addition, the threshold effect level (TEL) and the 
Canadian guideline were exceeded in nearly 50% of the samples. High chromium 
concentrations capable of producing harmful effects on organisms are frequently measured in 
the soils and sediments derived from serpentine, a family of minerals frequently found in the 
local study zone. 

Other criteria exceedances were observed, albeit more rarely, for cadmium, copper and lead. 
These exceedances mainly come from Lac à la Savane. 

20.1.7 Soils 

As part of the ESIA, an environmental site assessment of past uses of the land covered by the 
Dumont property was performed in order to identify all the elements that could have posed a 
real or potential risk of contamination to soil and water. This study concluded that although the 
site was bordered by a sawmill and a railway there a no evidence that the site has been 
contaminated by past activities. A soil characterization program is planned for the latter part of 
2013 to evaluate baseline conditions prior to project implementation. Geochemical 
characterization of the overburden that will be manipulated and stockpiled was performed in 
2012 and results are presented in Section 1.7 of this report. 

20.1.8 Vegetation & Wetlands 

Throughout the local study zone, terrestrial environments cover 39% of the surface area 
(3,786 ha), while wetlands occupy 57% (5,540 ha). The remainder is composed of 
anthropogenic environments, such as agricultural fields and housing (399 ha; 4%). The 
terrestrial environments comprise 17 main types of vegetation, including deciduous (9%), mixed 
(15%), and coniferous (46%) stands, as well as other types of terrestrial environments (30%), 
such as uncultivated grassland. Recent cutting has fragmented several environments.  

The majority of the terrestrial environments have medium ecological value. However, intolerant 
deciduous trees, uncultivated grassland, scrubland and recent cuttings have low ecological 
value. The anthropogenic environments have an ecological value ranging from low to very low.  

Small areas of black spruce and jack pine stands have high ecological value. The black spruce 
stands are located in the bog east of Launay. They form thin forest strips, surrounded by open 
bog of high ecological value. Together with the bog, they form a diversity of interesting plant 
habitats. The jack pine stands contain Woolly Beachheather and Sand Jointweed, two special-
status plants with high ecological value. This area is highly valued by the population and will not 
be disturbed by the Dumont project. 

Open bogs and tree swamps represent 65% of all wetlands in the local study zone. Wooded 
bogs and shrub swamps account for 34%. Finally, associated ponds and marshes represent 
about 1% of the wetlands. The majority of the wetlands have medium ecological value. Two 
open bogs have high ecological value and one bog-pool system has very high ecological value.  

All of the habitats within the studied area have been thoroughly characterized resulting in more 
than 150 descriptive listings. 

20.1.9 Mammals 

There is considerable wildlife diversity in the surroundings of the Dumont project, which is due 
to the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region's sub-northern climate. This is a transition zone where

Date:  25 July 2013 

20-6 

  

species from the north and south can be found. Trapping and hunting data (2007-2008) from the 
MNRF indicated the presence of a broad range of animals in the greater Abitibi-Témiscamingue 
region that are likely to inhabit the study area. The list includes beaver, muskrat, red squirrel, 
white-tailed deer, moose, raccoon, striped skunk, Canada lynx, red fox, coyote, grey wolf, black 
bear, river otter, marten, weasel, fisher and mink. Surveys conducted onsite confirmed the 
presence of moose, wolf, black bears, beaver, groundhog, red squirrel and snowshoe hare.  

According to the Quebec Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife (MRNF), Lac à la Savane 
Lake, slightly outside of the Dumont property, is considered a protected muskrat habitat. 

20.1.10 Small Mammals 

A field survey designed under the MNRF micro mammals protocol was performed in September 
2011 in various habitats within the studied area. Preliminary data analysis indicated the 
presence of rock vole (Microtus chrotorrhinus), a species likely to be listed on Quebec's 
threatened or vulnerable species list. Only one specimen was captured in its preferred habitat, a 
mature mixed forest located on rock outcrops. This habitat, located west of Lac à la Savanne, 
will not be affected by the mine infrastructure. Habitat developments to promote the rock vole 
will be performed in the Lac à la Savane sector and/or west of the projected tailings storage 
facility, where individuals of this species have been captured. This measure was included in the 
ESIA as part of the compensation program. 

20.1.11 Fish 

The inventories conducted between 2007 and 2012 counted 24 fish species in the watercourses 
of the study zone (Lac à la Savane, Lac Doyon, Lac Gauthier, and Ruisseau Pandini). Among 
these species, White Sucker, Brook Stickleback and Trout-perch are the most widespread. 

In the Villemontel River, a few cyprinid species and larger-sized species, such as Rock Bass, 
Northern Pike, Walleye and Yellow Perch, were captured.  

In the watercourses of the study zone, the inventories conducted in the habitats most 
prospective for Brook Trout did not capture any specimen of this species. The Villemontel River 
and its tributaries offer low habitat potential for this salmonid because the water is generally very 
turbid, the bed is composed of clay and silt, and the flow is mainly lentic. 

20.1.12 Benthic Invertebrates 

Benthic invertebrate surveys were conducted in 2007, 2008 and 2009.A total of 66 taxa were 
identified in the inventory, with an overall density of 1,300 organisms per square metre. Of this 
total, 33% of the taxa and 23% of the organisms belonged to the Chironomidae family, which 
includes midges or small flies related to mosquitoes whose larval stages are aquatic. These 
larvae are an important food source for fish and other insects, and the adult forms are an 
important food source for birds and bats. These insects are quite resistant to organic pollution. 

20.1.13 Birds 

According to provincial birdwatchers database (ÉPOQ), 112 bird species were indexed in the 
Launay and Trécesson area. Surveys conducted in 2008 within the Dumont property allowed 
census of 44 species. Complete inventories, pursued in 2011, comprising listening stations, 
active research and 12 automatic songbirds recording devices allowed census of more than 90 
species, including more than 20 species not surveyed in the EPOQ database. The most 
common species are the Nashville Warbler and the White-throated Sparrow.

The absence of waterbodies and watercourses of significant size in the perimeter covered by 
the Dumont project suggest low potential for their use by aquatic birds such as waterfowl. In 
fact, only four common species were identified during the field surveys (black ducks, mallards, 
teal and loons).  

20.1.14 Reptiles & Amphibians 

The local study zone shelters a good diversity of anurans, with six species detected. These are 
common and widespread species in Québec:  the Northern Spring Peeper, the Wood Frog, the 
American Toad, the Mink Frog, the Green Frog and the Leopard Frog. A few Common Garter 
Snakes were observed during the fieldwork. Inventories of Wood Turtle were performed in 2011, 
but none were observed. An additional inventory of Blanding's Turtle was conducted in spring 
2013 and none were observed. 

20.2 Species at Risk 

20.2.1 Plants 

Consultation of Quebec government species at risk database (CDPNQ) revealed no occurrence 
of "at risk" species within the study area. Colonies of sand heather (Hudsonia tomentosa), 
however, were mentioned by CDPNQ east and northeast of the future mine site. Field surveys 
conducted in 2008 confirmed the presence of these colonies but at that time no plants were 
observed inside the Dumont property limits. This plant is likely to be designated threatened or 
vulnerable in Quebec. 

In June, July and August 2011, three field campaigns focusing primarily on approximately forty 
"at risk" plant species were conducted within the Dumont project study area. These inventories 
allowed census of three precarious species:  slenderleaf sundew (Drosera linearis) located in a 
wetland (bog) on the northeast corner of the study area, sand heather (Hudsonia tomentosa) 
and sand jointweed (Polygonella articulata) on the southwest corner of the Dumont property. 
Current project development plans would not impact the areas where these species were 
observed.  

20.2.2 Reptiles & Amphibians 

In May 2011, a field survey aiming specifically at locating wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta) along 
the watercourses potentially impacted by mining infrastructure was conducted. No wood turtles 
were observed. This species is likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable in Quebec. 

Furthermore, real time recordings performed on site between May and July 2011 did not detect 
any audio evidence of the presence of the striped chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata) also likely 
to be designated threatened or vulnerable in Quebec. 

As part of the provincial environmental assessment process, RNC was requested to perform a 
spring survey of the Blanding's Turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) to confirm the absence of this 
species on the Dumont property. This species is considered threatened by both provincial and 
federal governments. Although intensive efforts were put during the 2013 spring survey (16 
stations during 10 consecutive days), no specimen were captured. 

20.2.3 Birds 

During 2008 field surveys, a great grey owl (Strix nebulosa) was observed within the study area, 
but nesting was not confirmed. No observation of this species was made during subsequent 
surveys.

Field inventories in 2011 recorded the presence of three "at risk" species:  olive-sided flycatcher 
(Contopus cooperi), rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus), and common nighthawk (Chordeiles 
minor). These three species are considered likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable in 
Quebec and are considered threatened by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife 
in Canada (COSEWIC). 

Among the species identified in the Launay and Trécesson area in the birdwatchers database 
(EPOQ), the presence of the short-eared owl (Asio flammeus) was noted. This species is of 
special concern in Canada and is likely to be designated threatened or vulnerable in Quebec. 
Also noted in this list is the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) designated vulnerable in 
Quebec, although its presence within the study area is unlikely due to the absence of large 
water bodies demonstrating fish abundance. 

20.3 Description of the Social Environment  
The Dumont project is located in the regional municipality of Abitibi. This territory is composed 
of 17 municipalities and two unorganized territories. The First Nation reserve of Pikogan is also 
located within this geographical area. The population of the MRC is approximately 24,300. 
Socio-economic indicators for the surrounding municipalities are given in Table 20-2. 

The proposed extent of the Dumont project is located principally in the municipalities of Launay, 
and Trécesson with a minor extension into the municipality of Berry to the northeast. The 
villages of Launay and Villemontel are located along the road and railway line linking Amos and 
the next regional municipality, Abitibi-Ouest, whose nearest town is Taschereau. These villages 
were established when the transcontinental railroad was built during the early stages of 
colonization of the Abitibi area at the beginning of the 20th century.

20.3.1 Description of Surrounding Communities 

20.3.1.1 Amos 

The town of Amos, located 25 km east of the Dumont project, is the largest town in the regional 
municipality with a population of over 12,500. Amos is the commercial and administrative centre 
of the region. It provides public services such as health care, school board administration, and 
sport infrastructures to the surrounding municipalities. 

20.3.1.2 Launay 

Launay's economy relies mainly on agriculture and forestry. There are 229 inhabitants and 112 
private dwellings in the municipality. The majority of its territory is located on public (Crown) 
lands. The Dumont project development limits are about 2 km from the urbanized area of the 
municipality, which is located on the Launay esker. The municipality is faced with population 
decrease and devitalization1 that was exacerbated by the closure of a saw mill, its only industry, 
in 2006.  

On September 26 2012, RNC and the municipality of Launay entered a provisional collaboration 
and partnership agreement. The main objective of this agreement is to formalize the 
collaboration between RNC and the municipality of Launay to the benefit of the community and 
the advancement of the Dumont project. 

20.3.1.3 Trécesson (Villemontel) 

Trécesson township, with 1,138 citizens and 562 private dwellings, contains two villages:  
Villemontel, located about 3 km from the project's limits; and an area called La Ferme, which is 
more distant. There are many agricultural, forestry, recreational and cultural activities within this 
municipality. This municipality, as a whole, enjoys a demographic increase.  

20.3.1.4 Unorganized Territory of Lac Chicobi (Guyenne) 

The town of Guyenne, with 203 inhabitants, is located 10 km north of the project site in one of 
the two unorganized territories managed by the regional municipality. Most economic activity is 
related to agriculture and forestry. A lake of significance, Lac Chicobi, is located in this area and 
hosts many cottages and a summer camps. Lac Chicobi is in the Arctic drainage basin.  

20.3.1.5 Berry  
The project touches the southwest corner of the municipality of Berry. This municipality of 625 
citizens and 230 dwellings is composed of two villages, Saint-Gérard-de-Berry and Saint-
Nazaire, and cottage sectors around lakes, including Lac Berry and Lac Du Centre. The main 
activities are agriculture and forestry. A slight residential growth was noticed last decade in rural 
parts of the municipality and around lakes. 

20.3.1.6 Taschereau 

The municipality of Taschereau, 981 inhabitants, adjoins Launay to the west. The town, located 
about 12 km away from the project site, was built around a sawmill 50 years ago, which closed

permanently in 2011. The economy is based on agricultural and forest activities and on a new 
tourist and recreational project. Taschereau hosts many lodgings and restaurants, benefits from 
its location along the lake, and is at the northern limit of Aiguebelle Provincial Park. 

20.3.1.7 Pikogan (Abitibiwinni First Nation) 

The First Nation reserve of Pikogan is located along the Harricana River and is enclosed within 
the Amos municipal boundaries. There are more than 150 dwellings on the reserve. The reserve 
exists since 1956 and was expanded in 2008 to meet residential, economic and community 
needs. There are 934 persons registered as Abitibiwinni band members, of which 538 live in 
Pikogan (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, Indian registry – 2010). Part of 
the population is Algonquin and part is Cree. The Abitibiwinni band council, principal employer 
in the community, offers many services including education, social activities and economic 
development.  

On April 5 2013, RNC and the Abitibiwinni First Nation (AFN) signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU). The MOU will serve as a framework to govern the relationship between 
RNC and AFN in accordance with their intention to further build on a relationship characterized 
by cooperation and mutual respect, in connection with the development of the Dumont project. 

20.3.2 Land Uses & Tenure 

A map showing land tenure information for the Dumont project area is given in Figure 20.2. 

20.3.2.1 Crown Lands 

The Dumont Nickel project is largely located on public land. The principal activities performed 
on this land relate to forestry (lumbering and forest management) and are managed by the 
Ministry of Natural Resources since 2013 through supply contracts. Part of this territory is 
subject to a forest management convention with the regional county municipality of Abitibi.  

According to the MNRF there are five leases for hunting camps and two registered traplines 
within the Dumont property boundaries. RNC is under discussions with registered hunting camp 
owners for purchase option agreements. 

20.3.2.2 Private Lands 

Part of the land proposed for project surface infrastructure development is privately held (Figure 
20.2). These lands are assigned to agroforestry uses in the regional municipality land 
development plan. RNC has either purchased or concluded purchase options for the most 
strategic properties (see Section 5.5).  

20.3.2.3 Agricultural Area 

A portion of the private and public lands on the southern portion of the project is registered in 
the provincial agricultural zone (See Figure 20.2). Uses other than for agricultural purposes are 
subject to an authorization from the Quebec Agricultural Land Protection Commission (CPTAQ) 
under the Act respecting the preservation of agricultural land and agricultural activities (see 
Section 5.5).

20.3.3 Archaeology 

A study of archaeological potential within the study area was conducted as part of the 2008 
baseline study. No area of high archaeological potential was identified near the study area. Only 
a few areas of moderate to low potential have been noted on the banks of the Villemontel River 
and its tributaries. Since projected impacts are significant and permanent, a brief archaeological 
survey in the areas of moderate and low potential was recommended in case they are disturbed 
by the mining project. This survey will be performed in the summer of 2013.  

20.4 Stakeholders Information & Consultation Process 
Mindful of the interest shown by host communities following the announcement of the Dumont 
Nickel project, RNC voluntarily initiated a public information and consultation process during the 
exploration phase. The process aims to ensure effective communication and dissemination of 
information about the project, and to document the concerns, comments and suggestions of the 
host communities to refine the pre-feasibility study where possible and help define the content 
of the environmental impact study. 

This approach comprises two main stages:  (1) an information and consultation process 
associated with the pre-feasibility study; and (2) a consultation process associated with the 
ESIA. 

To ensure a rigorous approach and to facilitate dialogue with the company, RNC retained the 
services of a social harmonization firm, Transfert Environnement. Acting as a third party during 
the consultation activities, its role was to support RNC in the coordination of the consultation 
activities and to produce the minutes and reports documenting the discussions and how RNC 
integrated them into the design of the Dumont project.  

All information and consultation activities were documented and concerns expressed by the 
stakeholders were compiled. A report on the information and consultation process conducted 
during the pre-feasibility study was produced by Transfert Environnement in 2011. A second 
report on the consultation process associated with the ESIA will also be produced by Transfert 
Environnement and will be submitted to the relevant authorities, as well as being filed as a 
public document on the company's website. 

The following types of communication were used during the consultation process: 

• information sessions; 

• open house events and site visits; 

• feedback activities; 

• establishment of advisory committees: 

− expanded advisory committee; 

− municipalities/company round-table; and 

• information and consultation processes for the Abitibiwinni First Nation in Pikogan. 

Tables 20-3 and 20-4 respectively present the main concerns and the location selection criteria 
discussed during the information and consultation activities.

20.4.1 Future Consultation Activities 

The next steps in the consultation process for the Dumont project are part of the provincial and 
federal environmental impact assessment process. RNC intends to continue stakeholder 
consultation during the development and operating stages of the project to minimize and/or 
mitigate the impact of the project and foster acceptance. In the short term, consultation activities 
will consist of site visits and open house events.

20.5 Preliminary Environmental & Social Impact Assessment 

20.5.1 Preliminary Environmental & Social Impacts Identification 

This section summarizes the main social and environmental impacts anticipated to be 
associated with the development of the Dumont project as identified in the ESIA. Although this 
list is not exhaustive, it underlines topics that will require specific consideration. The general 
approach retained complies with federal and provincial requirements for carrying out 
environmental assessments. The process used to identify and assess the importance of the 
impacts on the environment mainly relies on detailed descriptions of the project and the 
environment, consultations with stakeholders, and lessons learned from the performance of 
similar projects.  

The importance of each impact was determined by experts focussing mainly on the effect of 
each impact on a component of the environment and integrates the criteria of intensity, extent, 
duration and probability of occurrence. The importance of an impact also integrates the effect of 
the proposed mitigation measures. The assessment is performed only once and describes the 
residual impact once mitigation measures are applied.  

On the whole, the majority of the impacts are qualified as being of little or very little importance. 
It is worth noting the existence of several positive impacts, particularly for the components of the 
human environment. Medium residual importance levels are considered for the following 
impacts: 

Physical Environment 

• Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the operating phase; 

• Loss of arable land for other purposes during the operating phase; 

• Changes to the water and sediment regimes during the construction/preproduction and 
operating phases; and 

• Changes to the groundwater flow regime (lowering of the water table) during the operating 
phase. 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

20-15 

  

Biological Environment 

• Loss of forest habitats during the operating phase; 

• Loss of bird habitats during the operating phase; and 

• Loss of mammal habitats during the operating phase. 

Human Environment 

• Loss of jobs and reduced purchasing in the region during the closure phase; 

• Possible deterioration of the economic security of households and reduction of community 
services during the closure phase; 

• Encroachment on a portion of the land used by members of the Pikogan community for all 
phases of the project; 

• Possible deterioration of the quality of life for part of the neighbouring population due to 
concerns about the potential effect of the project on the environment and health during the 
operating phase; 

• Potential economic difficulties for low-income or fixed-income individuals and pressure on the 
existing services during the construction/preproduction phase; and 

• Changes to the scenery as viewed by moving and stationary observers at some locations 
during the operating phase. 

Only one impact is qualified as very important or important according to the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act, namely the risk of nitrogen dioxide formation at concentrations 
likely to affect health as this phenomenon has not yet been modelled and precise impacts could 
not be evaluated. This impact is considered to be a cause for concern due to the proximity of 
some residents of Launay and Villemontel and the scope of the blasting activities for ore 
extraction from the pit. Atmospheric dispersion modelling studies of airborne nitrogen dioxide 
concentrations during blasting will allow a more precise assessment of the health risks and 
whether specific preventive measures are required within the framework of the emergency 
response plan in order to ensure adequate protection of workers and the nearby population. 

20.5.2 Mitigation Measures 

Besides the commitment to implement standard mitigation measures normally formulated for 
similar industrial projects, RNC is considering the implementation of specific mitigation 
measures such as: 

• remedial measure for private wells potentially affected by the water table drawdown 
associated to the pit dewatering;  

• protection of the forested areas along Highway 111 to attenuate landscape modification 
issues; 

• implementation of a 1 km buffer zone between the Launay esker and the closest mine 
infrastructure to avoid impacts on the aquifer; 

• mitigation of the impact of the project development on the three identified "at risk" bird species 
by avoiding nest destruction related to wood harvesting during the nesting periods, from mid-
May to August; 

• construction of a berm between the tailings storage facility and the town of Launay to 
minimize the impact of a potential dyke failure; 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

20-16 

  

• implementation of intensive dust control measures to reduce the project impact on air quality 
for surrounding populations; and 

• implementation of a shuttle service to principal nearby towns to reduce employee traffic.  

20.5.3 Compensation Program 

20.5.3.1 Wetlands 

According to the pre-feasibility study site layout, mining infrastructure encroaches on 
approximately 2,525 ha of wetlands. This will require that a compensation program be 
developed to protect, enhance or restore wetlands in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. This 
project will first be submitted to the Quebec Ministry of Environment, Sustainable Development, 
Wildlife, and Parks (MDDEFP) for acceptance and would be implemented during the 
construction phase. 

20.5.3.2 Fish Habitat 

According to the pre-feasibility study site layout, the development of the Dumont project is likely 
to negatively impact about 31 ha of fish habitat. However, concerned habitats are considered of 
low quality, do not include sensitive habitats (e.g., spawning grounds) and do not host any 
species of interest. 

Under Section 27.1 of the Fisheries Act RNC will most probably be required to develop and 
implement a plan to compensate for damage, destruction and loss of fish habitat that will occur 
as a result of mine development. This compensation plan will have to satisfy both provincial and 
federal level of government. At this stage, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) does 
not consider the sections of stream located in the footprint of the tailings storage facility to be 
fish habitat. RNC is presently in discussion with DFO and Environment Canada to determine if 
the watercourses located in the footprint of the waste rock dump, low-grade ore stockpiles, and 
overburden impoundments should be registered in Schedule 2 of the Metal Mining Effluent 
Regulations (MMER) under Article 36 (3) of the Fisheries Act. 

20.6 Environmental Permitting & Applicable Regulations  

20.6.1 Legal Context 

Two levels of legislation control the environmental assessment and granting of operating 
licences for mining operations in Quebec. The following is a preliminary analysis of the 
environmental regulations in force that would be applicable to the Dumont nickel project. This 
analysis also includes other applicable law and regulations that could affect the permitting 
timeline, as well as proposed modifications of Quebec's mining law through Bill 43. 

20.6.2 Provincial Permitting Process 

In order to obtain the Certificate of Authorization allowing the construction and operation of the 
Dumont project, RNC is subject, under the Provincial Environmental Quality Act (Loi sur la 
qualité de l'environnement, L.R.Q., c. Q-2), to the assessment and review of environmental 
impacts procedure involving an environmental impact study eventually leading to public 
hearings. The provincial trigger to this process is the installation of a mill that processes 7 kt/d or 
more of ore. The actual mill design plans a 52.5 kt/d start-up, ramping up to 105 kt/d after 
expansion.

20.6.3 Federal Permitting Process 

Given the processing capacity of 52.5 to 105 kt/d, the likely impact on fish habitat, and the 
storage and manufacture of explosive, the Dumont nickel project is subject to a comprehensive 
environmental study under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA, LRC, 1992, 
Ch. 37). In contrast with usual class screening environmental assessment, the comprehensive 
study process involves a greater implication of the federal government's experts from various 
departments such as Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) and Natural Resources (NRCan), as well as 
a formal public consultation process, including specific consultations of First Nations. 

In addition to the comprehensive study, every mining project planning on using a fish habitat for 
storage of mining residue must be registered in Schedule 2 of the Metal Mining Effluent 
Regulations (MMER) under Article 36 (3) of the Fisheries Act. Consequently, RNC will have to 
evaluate various alternatives for mining residues storage and clearly demonstrate that the 
proposed scenario is the most appropriate under environmental, technical, economic and social 
considerations. In addition, under Section 27.1, RNC will have to develop and implement a plan 
to compensate for damage, destruction and loss of fish habitat that will occur as a result. 

In 2010, the Governments of Canada and Quebec renewed the Canada-Quebec Agreement on 
Environmental Assessment Cooperation seeking to optimize the use of federal-provincial 
cooperation mechanisms within the framework of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. 
Although each government maintains authority in the areas under its jurisdiction and remains 
responsible for environmental assessment decisions required by its legislation, the agreement 
ensures a one-project-one-assessment delivery approach to projects requiring the application of 
federal and provincial environmental assessment requirements. The parties agree to work within 
the established timelines for environmental assessments set out in federal and provincial 
legislation. A one-window contact in each jurisdiction is accountable for ensuring that the legal 
requirements of the parties participating in the cooperative environmental assessment are met. 

In addition to the collaboration agreement, the federal government established in 2007 the 
Major Project Management Office (MPMO) to support the Government of Canada's approach to 
ensure a more effective, accountable, transparent and timely review process. The MPMO's 
mandate is to provide overarching project coordination, management and accountability for 
major resource projects within the context of the existing federal regulatory review process; and 
to undertake research and identify options that drive further performance improvements to the 
federal regulatory system. 

20.6.4 Other Applicable Law & Regulations 

20.6.4.1 Quebec Mining Act 

On May 29, 2013, the Quebec Minister of Natural Resources tabled the proposed new Mining 
Act, Bill 43. Bill 43 retains most of the current rules in the Mining Act pertaining to rights and 
ownership, but provides for several significant changes, including in regard to the rights of 
municipalities, environmental oversight, public interest considerations, economic benefit 
measures and First Nations consultations. The Bill is expected to be debated by the National 
Assembly during the fall 2013 session.  

Previous to this, on February 13, 2013, the Minister of Natural Resources published several 
proposed amendments to the Regulation respecting mineral substances other than petroleum, 
natural gas and brine. All of these amendments pertain to the rules applicable to financial 
guarantee requirements for rehabilitation and restoration plans submitted and approved as a 
requirement for the granting of a Mining Lease. Under the modified regulation, the developer 
must provide a financial guarantee covering 100% of all anticipated costs related to site

rehabilitation and restoration, including long-term water treatment and infrastructure 
dismantlement costs. The guarantee is payable in three instalments, 50% within 90 days of 
receipt of approval of the rehabilitation and restoration plan, 25% on the first anniversary of 
receipt of approval of the plan, and the final 25% on the second anniversary of approval of the 
plan. The economic model presented in this report accounts for this proposed regulatory 
change. 

20.6.4.2 Act to Preserve Agricultural Land & Agricultural Activities 

The purpose of the Act is to ensure the sustainability, on a territorial basis, of agricultural 
practices and to promote sustainable development of agricultural enterprises in established 
agricultural areas. In order to enforce this law, Quebec's government created the Quebec 
Agricultural Land Protection Commission (CPTAQ). Figure 20.2 shows the extent of the lands 
that are classified as an agricultural zone within the meaning of the Act respecting the 
preservation of agricultural land and agricultural activities. Mining activity on these lands would 
require rezoning or exclusion of these lands from the agricultural zone by the CPTAQ. This 
exclusion must be requested by the local municipality or by the regional county municipality 
(RCM). The application for exclusion must demonstrate that there are no suitable non-
agricultural lands available for the stated purpose in the municipality. The majority of the 
agricultural lands located within the Dumont property are either non-arable or used for 
silvicultural purposes. The application for exclusion was submitted to the CPTAQ in February 
2013 by the RCM supported by resolutions from the two municipalities directly concerned, 
Launay and Trécesson. Extensive consultation was performed by RNC with local farmers, the 
local and regional farmers union (UPA), as well as with the municipalities involved and the RCM 
in order to generate a strong consensus regarding the area targeted by the exclusion. Thus, 
RNC does not expect that exclusion for the purpose of developing the Dumont project would be 
unreasonably withheld. 

20.6.4.3 Act Respecting the Acquisition of Farm Land by Non-Residents 

Under the present Act, RNC is not considered a Quebec resident and must therefore request for 
a specific authorization to acquire parts of the private lots that are not included in the area 
targeted by the exclusion process described above. Both processes (exclusion and acquisition 
by non-residents) are being conducted simultaneously and will be analyzed together by the 
CPTAQ. 

20.6.5 Permitting Timeline 

20.6.5.1 Major Milestones 

The proposed timeline for environmental permitting was developed under the assumptions that 
the two levels of governments, federal and provincial, will establish a good collaborative process 
under the Canada-Quebec Agreement on Environmental Assessment Cooperation.  

The permitting process is initiated with the submission of a Project Notice to the Quebec 
Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MDDEP). The project notice describes 
the scope of the project and provides a summary of potential environmental impact based on 
the PFS design. The Project Notice is assessed jointly at the federal and provincial levels and 
instructions on the scope and requirement for the environmental and social impact assessment 
(EISA) are forwarded to the developer.  

Once the ESIA is completed and considered receivable by the authorities, the Quebec public 
hearing process is triggered by the Quebec public hearings bureau (BAPE). The BAPE then 
submits its recommendations to the MDDEP and eventually to other governmental authorities

20.6.5.2 Schedule II of the Metal Mining Effluent Regulations 

Authorization of the placement of deleterious mining waste in a natural water body that is 
frequented by fish requires a regulatory amendment to list the water body on Schedule 2 of the 
Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER). This process may take from 8 to 12 months. This 
process starts once the developer and the DFO come to an agreement with regards to a funded 
compensation plan for fish habitat loss. It is worth mentioning that the developer can start 
construction work upon receipt of the Certificate of Authorization prior to the MMER 
amendment, as long as the work carried on does not involve the use of fish habitat for storage 
of deleterious mining waste. 

At this stage, RNC has been informed by DFO that the sections of creek potentially impacted by 
the two cells of the tailings storage facility are not considered to be fish habitat, and would 
therefore not trigger the MMER schedule 2 amendment process. RNC is presently seeking 
direction from DFO to better define the fish habitat status of sections of the unnamed creek 
potentially impacted by the waste rock, low-grade ore and overburden impoundments. RNC is 
also working to demonstrate to Environment Canada that these materials are not deleterious on 
the basis of extensive environmental geochemistry characterization and would therefore not 
trigger the amendment process. 

20.7 Environmental Geochemistry Program 
This section intends to give a broad overview of the environmental geochemistry work 
performed by RNC for the development of the Dumont Nickel project. It covers environmental 
geochemistry studies as well as studies designed to clearly define the potential of the mining 
waste to passively sequestrate carbon. The objectives of the environmental geochemical 
characterization program is to classify mine waste according to Québec Directive 019 sur 
l'Industrie Minière (Directive 019) for waste management planning and to identify elements of 
potential environmental interest in the framework of future mine site water quality, in order to 
assess possible water treatment requirements during mine operation. 

20.7.1 Phase 1:  Baseline Environmental Testing on Mineralized Rocks, Waste Rocks &  
Tailings  

A preliminary environmental geochemistry study was completed in 2009 by GENIVAR LP 
(GENIVAR, 2010a). This study characterized mineralized rock, waste rock and metallurgical 
processing wastes expected to be equivalent to tailings at the time of testing. A total of 30 
samples were subjected to acid base accounting and metal leaching tests (TCLP-1311, SPLP-

1312 and CTEU9, for each sample), one MWMP leaching test, and five samples subjected to 
kinetic humidity cell tests. The waste rock samples tested showed no potential for acid 
generation and were classified as non hazardous, but showed leachate concentrations of pH, 
aluminum, arsenic, fluoride, iron, mercury and zinc that exceed Quebec Effluent Criteria 
(Directive 019) and/or the criteria for groundwater quality. The MWMP test on the composite 
mineralized rocks showed no concentration in leachates above the criteria. The humidity cell 
test showed slight sulphide oxidation and neutralization by carbonates. Based on the kinetic test 
results, no acid generation was observed and the samples did not leach metals to a 
concentration elevated above the criteria used in the baseline study. The alkaline pH of the 
leach solutions did, however, exceed the upper range of the groundwater criteria. It was 
recommended that further testing be completed to meet permitting requirements. 

20.7.2 Phase 2:  Static Testing for Waste Rock, Low-grade Ore, Tailings & Overburden 

A second, broader environmental geochemistry study was initiated in 2010. Static testing was 
completed in 2011 and kinetic weathering tests were completed in 2013 (Golder, 2013). The 
Golder 2013 report presents the results of the Phase 2 work completed on waste rock, low-
grade ore, tailings, tailings process water samples and overburden. The report presents the 
chemical composition of the mine waste, its potential to generate acid rock drainage (ARD) and 
to leach metals to the surrounding environment upon exposure to ambient conditions. The static 
and kinetic test methods utilized on mine waste solids are consistent with those recommended 
under Quebec Directive 019. They include acid-base accounting (ABA), chemical composition 
(major and trace element) and static leaching tests (TCLP, SPLP, CTEU9) on all solid materials 
as well as standard humidity cell kinetic leaching tests on tailings and waste rock.  

20.7.2.1 Waste Rock Geochemical Characteristics 

All waste rock samples tested were classified as non-acid generating (Non PAG), but leachable 
per Directive 019. All but one sample of waste rock reported less than 0.3% sulphur content and 
high buffering capacity demonstrated by neutralization potential ratios (NPR) greater than 10 
(compared to a minimum of 3 recommended in Directive 019). One sample of volcanic rock had 
a sulphur content (S(T)) of 0.32% but ample buffering capacity and thus, classified as Non PAG. 
Table 20-6 summarizes the results of the various static tests performed on waste rock and low-
grade ore.

Samples were classified as leachable based on the double criteria of TCLP static leaching test 
results and chemical composition. For many samples, chromium, copper, manganese and 
nickel occur in both in the solid phase at concentrations that exceed Quebec Soil Criteria A and 
in TCLP leachate at concentrations that exceed Quebec groundwater quality criteria. Chromium, 
copper and nickel also exceed groundwater criteria in the more representative acid-rain 
simulated SPLP test and in the CTEU9 water-leach test although less frequently and at lower 
levels (occur on fewer samples and generally at lower concentrations) than those measured in 
the more aggressive TCLP test. Nonetheless, the short-term leach test methods recommended 
under Directive 019 are limited in their ability to simulate site conditions and therefore to 
represent anticipated mine waste contact water quality.  

Kinetic test methods provide a more representative assessment of probable future mine waste 
contact water quality over the long term. Standard humidity cell kinetic weathering tests were 
completed on 13 samples of waste rock from the different lithologies. Results are presented in 
Golder (2013). Apart from some exceedances to water quality criteria in the initial cycles of 
testing, the effluent and groundwater water quality criteria were met in the long-term, except for 
the alkaline pH that remained above the provincial effluent criteria range in all samples of 
peridotite and some samples of dunite. These results suggest that although waste rock carries a 
'leachable' classification according to Quebec Directive 019 criteria, water quality contacting 
waste rock is likely to have low concentrations of the chemicals of environmental interest 
highlighted by static leaching tests. 

20.7.2.2 Tailings & Process Water Geochemical Characteristics 

The Golder 2013 study presents the static test results of the 15 tailing samples representing 
various types of processed ore (from different areas within the deposit) which will be deposited 
in the same tailings storage facility during mine operation. All tailings samples are classified as 
Non-PAG but leachable according to Directive 019. Ten of 15 samples released nickel at 
concentrations that exceeded Quebec groundwater quality criteria (Table 20-7). Water leaching 
tests (SPLP and CTEU9) on the tailings solids showed few additional parameter exceedances 
to groundwater criteria (mostly silver and copper).

Standard humidity cell kinetic weathering tests were completed on 7 samples of tailings. Results 
are presented in Golder (2013). Most chemical concentrations met the effluent and groundwater 
water quality criteria during the testing except for the alkaline leachate pH that remained above 
the provincial effluent criteria range in all tailings samples. Some constituents including arsenic, 
chloride, copper and nitrate showed exceedances in the initial cycles of testing but decreased to 
below groundwater or effluent criteria subsequently. Nickel remained below the effluent and 
groundwater criteria in all samples for the duration of the kinetic tests.  

Fifteen (15) samples of process water were analysed. Some samples showed exceedances to 
groundwater quality criteria for chloride, total chromium and total copper and fewer samples for 
dissolved chromium but no exceedances for dissolved copper. Total suspended solids

concentrations were above Quebec effluent quality criteria in 5 samples but all other parameters 
including pH were below the effluent criteria. Six (6) of the 15 samples of process water that 
were subjected to toxicity testing on rainbow trout and daphnia magna showed no toxicity to 
both organisms.  

20.7.2.3 Overburden 

Samples of the different overburden types were subjected to the full suite of static tests 
including acid generation potential, chemical composition and the three leaching tests (TCLP, 
SLPL and CTEU9) per the Quebec recommended analytical methods. Results are summarized 
in Table 20-8.

All overburden materials are Non-PAG and some samples mostly of till leach metals at 
concentrations that exceed Quebec groundwater quality criteria and soil criteria. The sand-silt-
gravel and the clay are considered low risk given the small number of exceedances, the low 
level of exceedances in the one sample and that the average TCLP concentrations for all 
parameters meet the comparative criteria. 

20.7.2.4 Waste Rock Classification for Construction Use 

Re-use of waste rock based on static leaching tests classifies Dumont waste rock as Category 
III, re-usable outside the mine footprint only if encapsulated without direct contact with natural 
soils.  

Notwithstanding this, kinetic tests suggest that contact water is likely to contain low 
concentrations of metals. Thus, the use of waste rock as fill or for infrastructure construction 
within the mine property may require measures to protect soil or groundwater during mine 
operation or at closure. As such, their use on the mine site should be discussed with Quebec 
authorities. 

20.7.3 Large Scale Kinetic Weathering Tests 

20.7.3.1 Leaching Columns 

Large scale kinetic weathering tests (leaching columns) were initiated in March 2012 and are 
largely complete on each of the major lithologies and low-grade ore (6 cells) and on tailings (1 
cell) to evaluate test scale-up effects on leachate water quality. These tests were conducted at 
the Unité de Recherche et Services en Technologie Minérale (URSTM) of the Université du

Québec en Abitibi Temiscaming. The results of this study are included in appendix to the Golder 
(2013) report. 

Results corroborate those obtained from the standard size humidity test cells where 
exceedances to the effluent criteria are noted for pH from the waste peridotite, dunite and the 
low-grade ore dunite. Few isolated exceedances to Quebec groundwater quality criteria are 
noted mostly in the early leaching cycles. Late cycles show no exceedances to these criteria. 

20.7.3.2 Field Scale Experimental Cells 

Two larger field scale leaching tests (in-situ experimental cells) were built at the project site in 
2011 and continue to be run by RNC (Figure 20.3). One of the cells contains a mixture of waste 
and low-grade dunite and the other contains tailings. These tests were meant to evaluate the 
carbonation potential and the geochemical behaviour of the waste rock and tailings under 
conditions that are similar to those expected in the actual waste rock piles and in the tailings 
management facility, particularly for the lithologies containing sulphides and/or alloy.  

Figure 20.3:  In-Situ Cells – Tailings cell in foreground, waste rock (serpentinized dunite) in 
background diameter of tailings cells is 5 m 

 
Source:  RNC. 

The tailings cell is instrumented with sensors measuring volumetric water content, temperature 
and water potential. This provides information on the geotechnical behaviour of the tailings 
exposed to natural conditions. A meteorological station was installed onsite to monitor 
atmospheric conditions (precipitation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction, solar 
radiation). 

Leachate water quality from both experimental cells meets Quebec effluent criteria. Leachates 
also generally meet the groundwater criteria with few isolated exceptions for silver, arsenic and 
manganese (few cycles and marginal exceedances).  

Results obtained to date corroborate those obtained from the smaller scale standard humidity 
test cells and larger leaching columns; they suggest that leachate water quality contacting 
tailings and waste rock is likely to be substantially better than those on which are based the 
leachable classification for these wastes.

20.7.4 Carbon Sequestration 

Sequestration of CO2 by reaction with magnesium-rich natural minerals, such as the serpentine 
contained in the Dumont deposit, and its long-term storage in the form of magnesium 
carbonates has been identified as one of the only permanent carbon sequestration processes. 
This is considered to offer a significant potential for the reduction of the environmental footprint 
of the project through reduction of net greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). This spontaneous 
reaction is known as spontaneous mineral carbonation. Spontaneous mineral carbonation is a 
process that occurs naturally at ambient conditions whereby magnesium silicate serpentine 
minerals (including chrysotile) are transformed into magnesium carbonate minerals, such as 
magnesite, in the presence of water and carbon dioxide. 

In 2010, a team from Laval University conducted a study aiming to determine the potential for 
carbon sequestration on various Dumont project mine wastes including:  air-classified fibres, 
desliming tails (slimes) and final flotation tailings (Pronost et al., 2010). The study clearly 
demonstrated that the materials are able to sequestrate carbon by binding atmospheric carbon 
dioxide (CO2) in the form of various secondary carbonate minerals. Samples carbonated under 
ambient air sequestered approximately 0.8% to 1.0% of their mass of CO2. Their CO2 
concentrations increased from an initial value of 0.3% to 0.9% CO2 to 1.5% to1.9% CO2 after 
carbonation. Samples carbonated in eudiometers which reached their total carbonation potential 
have a final CO2 concentration varying from 5.2% to 9.5%.  

The experimental tailings and waste rock cells constructed at the Dumont site were 
instrumented to determine CO2 sequestration under natural conditions. This ongoing study, 
involving researchers from Laval University and Université du Québec en Abitibi-
Témiscamingue (UQAT), aims to better understand carbonation mechanisms to allow RNC to 
quantify and optimize the carbon sequestration reactions in the Dumont waste rock and tailings 
and thus potentially offset the GHG emissions from the project.  

The large leaching columns completed at UQAT were dismantled after 1 year of operation. The 
particles in the ultramafic rock columns were found to have agglomerated together into clumps. 
The cemented clumps were mounted as whole grains/clumps and imaged via SEM (scanning 
electron microscopy). The images showed extensive growths of various carbonate minerals 
(identified by EDS, Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy) across ultramafic (peridotite) grains 
which were cemented together by carbonate matrix (Figure 20.4). Fibrous serpentine was also 
found to show evidence of carbonate growth and cementation (Figure 20.5). SEM 
characterization for the remaining lab weathered samples is ongoing and will include further 
SEM imaging and XRD,  

In May 2013, an onsite experiments was set up to characterize short-term weathering of 
ultramafic waste peridotite, dunite and tailings. Previous studies have shown the production of 
secondary carbonate through prolonged weathering (~1 year). The purpose of the onsite 
experiment is to assess the rate at which the secondary carbonation reaction takes place. 
Samples will be taken after each week of weathering and analysed with SEM equipped with 
EDS. The weekly samples will also be assessed for chrysotile content though point counting to 
characterize chrysotile breakdown during secondary carbonation. This program is ongoing.

20.7.5 Subsequent Studies 

Following on the results of the two phases of study and larger scale weathering studies, 
additional tests are being undertaken on tailings and leaching column waste rock materials as 
follows:   

• UQAT Laboratory mineralogical analysis (SEM and EDS) on weathered rock extracted from 
the leaching columns. SEM and EDS will focus on characterizing secondary carbonate 
minerals from weathered ultramafic rock (as described in Section 20.7.4).  

• Weekly SEM, EDS and point counting analysis for onsite experiment to assess the rate of 
carbonation (as described in Section 20.7.4). 

• Static chemical tests on material from the waste rock columns (waste rock, low-grade ore and 
tailings). This aims to document chemical and mineralogical changes that might have 
occurred during testing, to assist in the interpretation of the long-term weathering behaviour of 
waste rock and tailings.  

A submerged tailings column leach test is also underway at SGS Laboratories to examine the 
effect of the presence of tailings on the chemistry of the overlying water column. This test aims 
to replicate the geochemical processes that would occur between tailings that will be placed in 
the bottom of the open pit during the last years of mine operation and the open pit flood waters 
post closure.  Results on water quality from the leaching column will be used to validate results 
of a predictive water quality model for the Site.  

20.8 Health & Safety 

20.8.1 General 

Health and safety issues concerning communities and workers that are specific to the 
development and operation of the Dumont project are noted below.  

• restricting access to the large industrial site through the use of efficient measures such as 
fencing; 

• minimizing road traffic hazards related to trucking through optimal use of the railway; 

• reducing psychosocial effect of the project on surrounding communities by implementing 
efficient communication channels such as a stakeholders monitoring committee and a 
complaint management system;  

• limiting emissions of potential air contaminants, including chrysotile, through the 
implementation of efficient dust control measures; 

• avoiding water contamination by minimizing the release of a mining effluent into the 
environment through an efficient site water management and maximizing recycling of process 
water, and by establishing an effective water treatment plant for water leaving the project site; 
and 

• managing risks associated with the presence of chrysotile in the ore and waste rocks. 

20.8.2 Chrysotile Management 

The most specific health and safety hazard associated with the development of the Dumont 
project is the hazard associated with airborne chrysotile fibres. Chrysotile, a fibrous form of 
serpentine, is one of six minerals commonly referred to under the commercial identification of 
asbestos. Chrysotile is found in the Dumont ore body in the serpentinized dunites and 
peridotites in proportions ranging from 0% to 10%. The 95% confidence interval for the average

Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

20-27 

  

bulk chrysotile content for these rock types lies between 1.6% and 1.9% (see Sections 9.5 and 
11.1.7). Exposure to airborne chrysotile fibres must be minimized due to the carcinogenic 
potential associated with inhalation of airborne chrysotile fibres. Quebec occupational and 
health regulations set the exposure standard to chrysotile in air for workers at one fibre per 
cubic centimetre (1f/cm3). There is no chrysotile in the gabbro and basalt rock types or in the 
clay and granular overburden. 

Regulated standards for airborne chrysotile have been maintained at recently producing 
chrysotile mine and mill operations such as those in Thetford Mines, Quebec through effective 
engineered controls focussing on dust control and capture at source in dry process areas, air 
filtration in mobile equipment cabs, and humidification in open pit operations. Regulated 
standards are maintained by RNC in its exploration facilities through dust control and capture at 
source and wet core sawing. RNC has conducted an air quality testing program at its facilities 
since 2007. In 2013, sampling results measured chrysotile concentrations ranging from 0.0005 
f/cm3 to 0.11 f/cm3 for 18 tests performed on workers and in fixed locations inside the facilities. 
The maximal value recorded since the beginning of this program was 0.48 f/cm3 in 2007 and 
has been steadily reduced since then. Even though the measurements are significantly below 
Quebec standards, RNC requires employees working in sensitive occupations to wear 
chrysotile-rated respirators.  

RNC has also implemented a chrysotile monitoring program at the in situ tailings and waste rock 
characterization cells (see Section 20.7.3) in collaboration with the local branch of Quebec's 
Health and safety commission. The objective of this program is to quantify the potential for 
airborne wind dispersal of chrysotile fibres into the surrounding environment and communities. 
The spontaneous mineral carbonation process described in Section 20.7.4 whereby chrysotile in 
tailings and waste rock is rapidly transformed spontaneously to magnesium carbonates is likely 
to play an important role in chrysotile dust control. 

It is important to note that there is no regulation in Quebec or Canada regarding airborne 
chrysotile concentrations in the natural environment.

The estimate is based on an EPCM execution approach as outlined in Section 21.4.2.2. 

The following parameters and qualifications are made: 

• The estimate is based on Q2 2013 prices and costs. 

• Financing related charges (e.g., fees, consultants, etc.) are excluded. 

• There is no escalation added to the estimate, other than the contingency. 

 

Data for these estimates have been obtained from numerous sources, including: 

• feasibility level engineering design; 

• mine schedules; 

• topographical information obtained from site survey; 

• geotechnical investigation; 

• budgetary equipment quotes from multiple potential OEMs; 

• budgetary unit costs from local contractors for civil, concrete, steel, electrical and mechanical 
works; 

• data from recently completed similar studies and projects; and 

• information provided by RNC, SRK, Snowden, and Norascon. 

 

Major cost categories (permanent equipment, material purchase, installation, subcontracts, 
indirect costs and Owner's costs) were identified and analyzed. To each of these categories, a 
percentage of contingency was allocated based on the accuracy of the data, and an overall 
contingency amount was derived in this fashion. 

21.3 Capital Estimate Scope 

21.3.1 Mining 

Mining costs have been estimated by RNC. Table 21-5 summarizes elements of the mining 
capital estimates for the initial, expansion and sustaining phases of expenditure. Note that costs 
presented in Table 21-5 are based on the forecast exchange rate at time of expenditure. Also 
note the time periods for the three stages of development: 

• Initial Capital:  to the end of Month 1 of mill production (22 months pre-strip + 1 month mill 
production = 23 months total), or September 2014 to July 2016; 

• Expansion Capital:  from Month 2 to the end of Month 54, at which time the expansion is 
commissioned (August 2016 to December 2020); and 

• Sustaining Capital:  from Month 55 (January 2021) to the end of project life (Month 398 or 33 
years and two months after the start of production (August 2049).

Total 320 216 419 955 

 

Sources of the estimates presented in Table 21-5 are as follows:   

Site Preparation – The estimate is based on the total area that would be cleared during each of 
the three stages of development and an estimated unit rate of $2,000/ha cleared that was 
provided by the pre-selected mining Contractor. 

Contractor Stripping – The estimate is based on the quantity of mining that would be allocated 
to the Contractor and unit rates provided by the Contractor. 

Owner Stripping – The estimate is based on the quantity of mining that would be performed by 
the Owner and a zero-based model of mining costs. This model has been reviewed and agreed 
to by Snowden. 

Mining Equipment & Ancillary Fleet – The zero-based model includes a derivation of the 
mobile equipment that would be required to achieve the planned mining schedule. Unit costs for 
specific units of mining or ancillary equipment were based on budgetary estimates provided by 
dealers representing the major Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). This includes 
Caterpillar, Komatsu, Hitachi, Joy and Sandvik. Estimates included not only the cost of 
machines, but also the associated cost of transport to site and assembly. 

Truck Shop – The truck shop will be expanded over time in line with the fleet of production haul 
trucks. The number of bays required has been estimated using the empirical formulae of 1 
workshop bay per five trucks and 1 auxiliary bay per 12 trucks. Six bays will be constructed for 
the initial phase, while the truck shop will ultimately reach 20 bays. The cost of bays is based on 
the requirement for 230t class haul trucks. 

Magazine – Explosives facilities (including the magazines for storing explosives as well as the 
plant for manufacture of explosives that will be installed during Year 2 of mill production or Q2 
2017) will be rented from the explosives supplier. The only costs included in the capital estimate 
are thus costs associated with site preparation. 

Fuel Storage – The size of the diesel 'fuel farm' has been based on diesel consumption as 
estimated by the zero-based model.  



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0

21-6 

  

First Fills – First fills for the mine have been calculated based on a stores holding of 1 month 
for all consumable items with the exception of tires (4 months), diesel (5 days) and electricity 
(no holding). No advance purchase of mine maintenance items would be required as these 
would be held on a consignment basis..  

21.3.2  Process Plant 

The nickel recovery plant and associated facility estimates have been prepared on a commodity 
basis (i.e., divided into earthworks, concrete, structural, etc.) and reported by area (i.e., 
crushing, milling, etc.). The estimate is based on the purchase of new mechanical equipment, 
and quantities have been assessed from first principles. 

The estimate is based on the majority of the work being carried out under fixed price or unit 
price contracts under a normal development schedule. No allowance is included for contracts on 
a cost plus or fast-track accelerated schedule basis. The erection of tankage, structural, 
mechanical, piping, electrical, instrumentation, and civil works will be performed by experienced 
contractors, using local labour. 

21.3.3 Tailings Storage Facility 

The estimate makes provision for constructing the starter dam at the initial cell of the TSF (Cell 
1) to a height of 10 m (compared to the ultimate height of approximately 45 m). This height is 
sufficient to store approximately the first year of tailings production. The dam would be 
constructed by first excavating any clay that underlies the downstream portion of the dam wall 
and backfilling this excavation (the key trench) with waste rock, though sand and gravel 
overburden stripped from the pit may be used depending on the availability of waste rock. The 
dam wall would then be constructed using waste rock from the pit. The wall would include a 
central clay core (constructed using brown clay excavated from either the open pit or the key 
trench) and an adjacent filter layer (constructed using sand and gravel stripped from the pit).  

The dam wall will be constructed on a 12-month basis and sequenced so that all rock used 
would be provided by ROM ex-pit mining activities with no stockpiling or re-handling required. 
The cost of loading, dumping and hauling of this material to a pit exit is excluded from the 
capital estimate as it is provided for in the mining cost. Only the cost associated with the 
incremental hauling distance to the TSF is included (over the life of mine, the 1-way haulage 
distance for material used in TSF construction is approximately 5.8 km, in addition to the 
average 4.7 km one-way haul for all ex-pit material). 

The clay core and filter layer would be constructed on a six-month basis during warm months, 
when the clay and filter material can be loaded, dumped and spread without material freezing, 
and peak requirements will exceed instantaneous ROM output. This results in the requirement 
of some stockpiling and re-handling of these materials. Material that does not require stockpiling 
is priced in the same manner as ROM rock used for construction, with only the incremental 
haulage distance included. For material that is stockpiled, the additional cost of re-handling, 
loading and dumping is also included in the capital cost. 

The capacity of the TSF would be increased progressively through continual lifting of the dam 
walls. Cell 1 would be raised at a rate of approximately 6 m annually, to an ultimate height of 
approximately 45 m. The storage capacity of Cell 1 at this height will be approximately 142 Mt of 
tailings, sufficient for the initial six years of mill production. Cell 2 will be built to a starter height 
of approximately 15 m, then raised at a rate of approximately 4 m annually to its ultimate height 
of approximately 65 m. The additional 538 Mt capacity provided by Cell 2 will be sufficient for all 
ore processed while the pit is active. When feed to the mill switches from the pit to ore

21-7 

  

stockpiles, tailings will be deposited in the pit. All costs associated with the raising of dam walls 
will be classified as capital costs.   

21.3.4  On-Site Infrastructure 

The following administration buildings will be built: 

• main administration building with medical centre and training room; 

• mine dry; 

• security office; 

• security gatehouse; and 

• assay lab. 

In addition, the process plant buildings listed below will be built. The capital cost for these 
buildings is included in the process plant cost estimate. 

• primary crushing facility;  

• process building (includes grinding, flotation, magnetic separation, cleaning and scavenging); 

• crushed ore stockpile cover; 

• plant workshop (part of process plant building) and warehouse reagent storage (part of 
process plant building); 

• explosives manufacturing facility; and 

• mine truck maintenance facility. 

The cost also includes the supply of the electrics, fittings, and furnishing for the buildings, but 
excludes earthworks. The cost to supply power and water services to the buildings form part of 
the process plant cost. 

21.3.4.1 Rail Spur 

A rail spur, approximately 5 km long, services the process plant. The rail spur consists of a fuel 
delivery track near the mining truckshop and a freight delivery track north of the process plant. 
During the expansion phase, the track may be extended to the explosives manufacturing plant, 
approximately 3 km northwest of the process plant. 

21.4 Basis of Estimate 

21.4.1 Direct Costs 

Direct costs are quantity based and include all permanent equipment, bulk materials, freight 
(inland and ocean), subcontracts, labour, contractor indirects and growth associated with the 
physical construction of the facilities. 

The same estimate build-up and philosophy was used for both the 52.5 kt/d and the 105 kt/d 
expansion case, taking into account that the scope of work was different in certain areas. 

21.4.1.1 Commodity Take-offs 

Bulk material take-offs to a feasibility level were developed from arrangement drawings. Rates 
were obtained from quotes obtained from local contractors. These rates include the appropriate 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

21-8 

  

gang rate for the commodity and the actual cost of the permanent materials. Local freight 
associated with contractor-supplied material is included in the unit rates. 

No imported fill is required. Aggregate material is available via an on-site crushing plant, 
purchased by the Owner. The crushing plant will be operated by the mine, and aggregate will be 
provided "free–issued" at the site of the crusher (i.e., the cost associated with production of 
aggregate has been provided for in the mining cost). Excess cut material can be stockpiled on 
site or consumed for future construction. 

21.4.1.2 Labour rates 

Labour rates have been built-up from first principles for different trades (welders, boilermakers, 
roofers, pipefitters, millwrights, storeman, crane operator, etc.). These rates have been based 
on the Quebec labour collective agreement (industrial sector) which can be found on the 
website, http://www.ccq.org, and the Guide for Employers 2013 - source deductions and 
contributions on the website, http://www.revenuquebec.ca.  

These labour rates include the following: 

• Base hourly rate; 

• Contribution rate from collective agreement – industrial sector: 

− vacation, holiday and sick leave pay; 

− premiums; 

− safety, health and welfare; 

− compensation for safety clothing and equipment; and 

− social benefits and funds. 

• Contribution rate from Revenue Quebec: 

− Quebec Pension Plan; 

− Quebec Parental Insurance Plan; 

− Health Services Fund; 

− Labour Standards Commission; 

− Workforce Skills Development and Recognition Fund; and 

− Compensation Tax. 

The work week is 50 hours, which consists of 40 regular hours and 10 overtime hours. The 10 
overtime hours are calculated as 4 hours x 1.5 (the regular rate) and 6 hours x 2.0. This is 
based on working Monday to Friday at 8 h/d regular; Monday to Thursday at 4 hours at time-
and-a-half and 6 hours on Saturday at double time. 

A crew make-up for a typical structural, mechanical and piping (SMP) contractor was developed 
to achieve an average hourly crew rate of $72.85/h. 

Contractor indirect costs for structural, mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation have 
been developed with the assistance of well-established local construction contractors within 
Quebec; earthworks and concrete has been based on unit rates from contractors within 
Quebec. Distributable costs have been allocated by percentage in the estimate on a manhour 
basis and are inclusive of the following: 

http://www.ccq.org/


 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

21-9 

  

• salaries, salary burden, allowances and benefits for the contractor's indirect labour, 
supervisory and management staff; 

• staff recruitment and travel expenses; 

• living out allowances; 

• mobilization and demobilization; 

• temporary buildings and facilities at site specifically for and used by the contractor; 

• workshop equipment and supplies; 

• vehicles and equipment used by staff during construction; 

• construction equipment including cranes up to 100 tonnes; 

• temporary construction power (diesel gensets); 

• small tools and consumables; 

• site office overheads, such as stationery, communications, light and power, first aid, security, 
etc; 

• head office costs/contribution; 

• financing charges; 

• insurances; 

• advertising; and 

• profit. 

The total SMP all-in labour rate is $155.62/h which includes the SMP base crew rate of $72.85/h 
and the addition of costs associated with the items listed above. This rate was confirmed by 
local SMP contractors. The electrical and instrumentation (E&I) rate is slightly less, at $140/h, 
due to less costs associated with construction equipment. 

21.4.1.3 Equipment costs 

Multiple quotes were sourced for all the mechanical equipment, with the exception of small 
pumps, agitators, load out scale, and mobile equipment, which were sourced from Ausenco's 
database. The budget quotes cover 95% of the mechanical equipment cost. The lowest 
technical accepted quotes were chosen for each equipment type. 

21.4.1.4 Freight 

All bulk materials, plant and equipment items within the direct costs are based on delivered to 
store on Site. Where possible, plant and equipment has been obtained from budget quotes 
inclusive of the freight component, if not percentage allowances have been included, where 
applicable. For mechanical equipment, 4% of the equipment supply cost has been included for 
inland freight and 12% for ocean freight for items not sourced in North America. These 
percentages are average for projects executed in Canada.  

21.4.1.5 Duties & Taxes 

Where duties are applicable on imported items of supply, the appropriate allocation of funds 
have been included in the estimate. 

All taxes are excluded unless otherwise stated.

21.4.2 Indirect Costs & Owner's Costs 

Indirect costs include items that are necessary for project completion, but not related to the 
direct construction cost. These items are summarized in the subsections below. 

21.4.2.1 Temporary Facilities & Services 

Temporary facilities and services are items which are not directly attributable to the construction 
of specific physical facilities of the plant or associated infrastructure, but which are required to 
be provided during the construction period to support the construction and have been estimated 
in detail. 

These costs include: 

• EPCM office complex, HS&E services, security services, site vehicles, refuelling, bus 
transportation, recurring project costs, maintenance services, provision of temporary roads, 
temporary power, water, effluent disposal and other facilities as required. For the expansion 
phase, power required by the construction work is to be provided by the Owner. 

• Heavy lift construction cranes. These represent cranes over and above what the construction 
contractor provides. These are cranes greater than 100 tonne capacity. 

21.4.2.2 EPCM 

The engineering, procurement, project and construction management budget has been 
compiled by the identification of resources over a defined schedule. A detailed assessment of 
consultants and project general expenses are also included in the EPCM costs. The EPCM 
estimate includes the following: 

• Corporate Services; 

• Project Services; 

• Engineering; 

• Drafting; 

• Construction; 

• Travel Expenses; 

• Home Office Expenses; 

• Site Office Expenses; and 

• Consultants (geotechnician, shipping logistics specialist, surveys, soils and compaction 
testing, concrete testing, fire and safety). 

21.4.2.3 Vendor Reps 

Allowances for vendor representatives, for both installation supervision and for the 
commissioning component, are included and are based on vendors recommended support that 
were provided in the quotations. These have been incorporated where applicable. Where these 
were not provided in the quotation but still required, a 3% of equipment supply cost was 
included. 

21.4.2.4 Construction Camp 

There is no requirement for a construction camp. All labour can be sourced from Amos and 
within the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region.

21.4.2.5 Spares 

Spares include capital spares, one year operational spares, and commissioning/start-up spares. 

A spares list was developed from the budget quotations provided. Where spares were not 
priced in the quotation, a percentage of the equipment cost was applied to each spares 
category. 

No spare SAG motor has been included. 

An increase in spares inventory is allowed for in the expansion phase. 

21.4.2.6 Commissioning Support 

The direct installation hours do not include construction labour to assist the EPCM 
commissioning team. Costs for these are based on two crews consisting each of one electrical 
technician, two fitters and one trade's assistant for the duration of four months. For the 
expansion phase, only two months are included. 

21.4.2.7 First Fills 

An estimate for first fills for the following reagents has been included:  KAX, MIBC, Aerofroth 65, 
Calgon, CMC, H2SO4, CuSO4, flocculent and sodium hypochlorite. A 100% charge for 38 mm, 
65 mm and 100 mm grinding balls is also included. 

An allowance has also been made for oils, lubricants, hydraulics, and greases. 

21.4.2.8 Modification Squad (Mod Squad) 

The direct installation hours do not include post construction modifications to facilitate handover 
and acceptance by the Owner. Costs for these are included in the form of a "mod squad" and 
are based on a crew of two fitters, three boilermakers, two trade assistants and one electrical 
technician, for four months duration, and a $500 k materials allowance. For the expansion 
phase, only 50% of the cost of the 52,500 t/d mod squad is included, as lessons learned from 
construction will be incorporated in the expansion. 

21.4.2.9 Owner's Costs 

Owner's costs have been provided by the Owner. They include the following: 

• Capitalized general and administration costs (to the end of Month 1 of mill production, or July 
2016); 

• Capitalized process operating costs (also to the end of July 2016); 

• Recruitment costs; 

• Orientation costs; 

• Training costs; and 

• Construction insurance costs.

21.4.3 Estimate Growth, Estimate Contingency & Accuracy 

21.4.3.1 Growth Allowance 

From the time the estimate is prepared to the time the facility is completely constructed, a 
number of detail variations that are not scope changes are expected to occur. Allowances have 
been included in the direct cost section of the estimate and are specified against line items. 

The growth categories assigned to each line item are dependent upon what level of definition 
was obtained. The categories are: 

• A  Engineered ................................................................................................ 2% 

• B  Preliminary Engineering............................................................................ 4% 

• C  Sketch ....................................................................................................... 7% 

• D  Estimated ................................................................................................ 10% 

• N  Nil Growth ................................................................................................. 0% 

In this case, the growth allowance for both the initial and expansion capital cost was calculated 
to be 4.1% for the process plant. Nil growth has been applied to the mining, winter works, and 
indirect costs. 

21.4.3.2 Estimate Contingency 

An estimate contingency allowance has been included and is money that is expected to be 
spent. It is meant to cover additional costs that will be incurred as a result of final detailed 
design and investigation to provide a holistic estimate of the defined scope. It is not intended to 
be a provision for changes in scope and standards. 

The value of the construction cost and estimate contingency represent an estimated project 
scope value of 100%. In this case the estimate total contingency is assessed at 9.0% for the 
initial capital cost, and 8.8% for the expansion, based on an analytical method addressing the 
elements of the estimate and assessing the estimate for scope, cost and confidence.  

The contingency categories assigned to each line item are dependent on the level of definition 
obtained scope wise and the level of costing pricing wise. Both categories are combined to 
determine the specific line items overall contingency.  

The scope categories are: 

• A Engineered ................................................................................................. 5% 
• B Preliminary Engineering ........................................................................... 12% 
• C Sketch ...................................................................................................... 17% 
• N Nil Growth .................................................................................................. 0% 

The pricing categories are: 

• A Tendered .................................................................................................... 5% 
• B Budget Quote ............................................................................................. 7% 
• C Current Project - Escalated ..................................................................... 10% 
• D Estimated ................................................................................................. 15% 
• N Nil Growth .................................................................................................. 0%

Direct contingency percentages were applied to the following items: 

• Mining fleet ..................................................................................................... 5% 
• Ancillary Equipment ..................................................................................... 10% 
• Site Preparation ............................................................................................. 8% 
• Owners Pre-Strip ........................................................................................... 5% 
• Contractors Pre-Strip ..................................................................................... 8% 
• TSF .............................................................................................................. 10% 
• G&A Capitalized Operating Costs .............................................................. 10% 
• Owners Contingency ................................................................................... 10% 

No contingency has been applied on growth. 

The estimate contingency does not allow for the following: 

• the effect of abnormal weather conditions, over and above normal weather conditions; 

• any changes to market conditions arising during the course of the project that could affect the 
cost of labour or materials; 

• changes of scope within the general production and operating parameters outside the 
detailed scope of work defined by this feasibility study; 

• special industry award allowances in addition to those included in the labour rates; and 

• effects of industrial disputes. 

The above items will be part of the Owner's contingency. 

21.4.4 Exclusions  
• project finance and interest charges; 

• foreign exchange hedging; 

• residual value of temporary equipment and facilities; 

• residual value of any redundant equipment; 

• cost to Owner of any downtime; 

• currency fluctuations; 

• escalation; 

• impact caused by modifications directed by government authorities, including schedule; 

• increased costs due to early works (e.g., concrete requirements before there is a batch plant 
on site); 

• removal, remediation, or disposal of hazardous/contaminated materials encountered during 
construction; 

• costs of any special requirement due to the participation of outside financing sources; and 

• costs to identify, locate, remove or relocate existing underground obstructions or utilities.

21.4.5 Project Deferred & Sustaining Capital 

Ongoing capital requirement for the mine production period totals $823 M over the mine life, 
which includes a credit of $22 M for the release of first fills at the end of project life. Items 
covered under sustaining capital include: 

• Ongoing clearing of land prior to pushbacks of the pit or extension of waste dumps. 

• Purchase of new production and auxiliary fleet for the mine (in response to longer hauls as 
the pit deepens) and replacement fleet (as the initial generation of equipment reaches the 
end of its economic life). In the case of haul trucks, which represent 60% of total expenditures 
on fleet over the life of mine, a life of 100,000 hours has been assumed – this equates to a life 
of approximately 16 years. 

• Expansion of the workshop that will be required as the fleet expands. The initial workshop of 
6 bays will be expanded to 10 bays during the expansion. Subsequent to the expansion, a 
further 10 bays will be added under sustaining capital. 

• Ongoing expansion of the TSF. 

• Construction of a water treatment plant in 2022. Note that costs associated with this plant are 
included under 'Area 3 Process' in Table 21-4. 

• General plant and infrastructure replacements, that are expected to total $250 M over the life 
of project. These have also been included under 'Area 3 Process' in Table 21-4. 

21.5 Operating Cost Estimate  

21.5.1 Summary 

This section details the estimated operating costs for mining, process plant and general and 
administration (G&A) for the Dumont project. Costs are presented in Q2 2013 Canadian dollars, 
unless stated otherwise. The estimate is considered feasibility study level with an accuracy of 
±15%. 

Operating costs were estimated in the following manner: 

• Operating costs for the open pit were based on the production schedule, performance 
parameters for mining equipment as recommended by OEMs, the current cost of 
commodities and labour rates for the Abitibi region, as determined from two different salary 
surveys.  

• Operating costs for the concentrator were based on rates of consumption for reagents and 
other consumables determined from metallurgical testwork and a labour structure that is 
appropriate for the current flowsheet.  

• The operating cost estimate for the concentrator includes those costs associated with 
operating the TSF. 

• G&A costs were based on the level of support required for the operation. 

• Costs for treatment and refining of concentrate were based on the commercial terms 
discussed in Section 18, and the scheduled production of concentrate. 

• Processing operating costs were calculated exclusive of variability from design throughputs 
(e.g., neglects ramp-up period, etc.). 

A summary of life-of-mine (LOM) operating costs is provided in Table 21-6.

21.5.2 Key Assumptions  

Key assumptions used in generating the operating cost estimates are given below. 

• C$ prices for goods and services obtained prior to the cost basis date of Q2 2013 have been 
escalated to this date using average Canadian producer price index (PPI) for the period 
January 2010 to December 2012 of 2.57% per annum. 

• US$ denominated prices for goods and services obtained prior to the cost basis date of Q2 
2013 have been escalated to this date using average Canadian producer price index (PPI) for 
the period January 2010 to December 2012 of 2.85% per annum. 

• Labour costs were estimated based on the organizational structure developed for each area 
and the rates of pay are based on wages and benefits at existing mining operations in the 
Abitibi region of Quebec and salary survey data collected by Coopers Consulting and PWC. 

• Based on discussions with Hydro-Quebec, it has been assumed that the project would qualify 
for the "L Tariff." The forecast price of $44.45/MWh based on Hydro-Quebec pricing effective 
April 2013. 

• The forecast long-term diesel price of $0.94/litre is based on forecast long-term oil prices of 
US$90/bbl and a C$ F/X rate of US$0.90.

Contractor mining represents 2.5%. The majority of the contractor scope of work includes 
removing all clay overlying the deposit during the initial 5 years of mining (including the pre-
strip). Contractor mining costs were based on a competitive tendering process that has led to 
the pre-selection of Norascon as the mining contractor. Norascon has worked closely with the 
feasibility study team on many aspects of the study. 

Hauling is the largest single cost activity, representing almost 50% of total mining costs. For the 
site-specific parameters at Dumont, the 230t class trucks that have been selected represent the

21-17 

  

most economic option, as larger trucks have less favourable ratio of tare-weight-to-payload, and 
thus forecast to consume more diesel on a unit basis and travel slower on uphill hauls. Diesel 
represents approximately 45% of total hauling costs. As will be discussed in Section 24, the use 
of trolley-assisted truck haulage could reduce diesel consumed by the production haul truck 
fleet by approximately 35 ML, or 35%.   

Table 21-8 indicates that diesel, equipment maintenance and labour each represent 
approximately 25% of the total mining cost. In addition to the 1,066 ML of diesel that would be 
consumed by the ex-pit production haul truck fleet, a further 250 ML would be consumed by 
drills, excavators, support equipment during the rehandling of low-grade ore. Additionally, 35 ML 
of diesel would be added to ammonium nitrate and emulsifiers in the manufacture of explosives.  

Key assumptions regarding the cost of equipment maintenance are based on budgetary 
quotations provided by OEMs. 

Labour averages 331 persons over the life of project, including 463 persons while the pit is 
active, and 116 during reclaim of the low-grade stockpile. These totals do not include personnel 
allocated to TSF construction, who would average a further 34 persons during the 20 years that 
construction of the TSF is active. 

Consumables represent the majority of the remaining owner mining operating costs. This 
category includes but is not limited to drilling bits, ground engaging tools (GET), truck tires and 
explosives. Power costs represent approximately 1.0% of owner mining costs. This reflects the 
relatively low price of power in Quebec. 

21.5.4  Process Plant Operating Costs 

The processing plant operating costs are based on the flowsheets described in Section 17. The 
battery limits for the determination of process operating costs begins with the crushing facilities 
and end with the TSF, and include plant services. 

21.5.4.1 Basis of Estimate 

The process plant operating costs were determined from first principles using input from a 
variety of sources, including:   

• process design criteria;  

• reagent and equipment supplier quotations; 

• staffing levels for processing plant estimated by Ausenco; 

• personnel salaries and overheads based on information from similar projects in the region 
and survey data presented by Coopers Consulting and PWC; 

• client recommendations; and 

• previous study assessments. 

21.5.4.2 Inclusions 

The process plant operating cost estimate includes all direct costs associated with the 
production of nickel concentrate.

Included in the Ausenco operating cost estimate are the following: 

• labour for supervision, management, and reporting of on-site organizational and technical 
activities directly associated with the processing plant; 

• labour for operating and maintaining plant mobile equipment and light vehicles, process plant, 
and supporting infrastructure; 

• labour and operational costs for the laboratory; 

• costs associated with direct operation of the processing plant, including all reagents, 
consumables, and maintenance materials; 

• maintenance materials used in operating and maintaining the mobile equipment and light 
vehicles; 

• cost of power supplied to the process plant from the power grid; 

• operational costs of the waste water treatment facilities; and 

• general operations associated costs including consultants, training and general supplies. 

21.5.4.3 Exclusions 

The plant operating costs exclude the following: 

• corporate overheads; 

• escalation or exchange rate fluctuations; 

• mine operating costs other than grade control assays; 

• exploration labour and operating costs; 

• environmental permits; 

• contingency; 

• import duty and taxes; 

• sustaining capital; 

• interest and financing charges; and 

• mine or plant closure/rehabilitation activities. 

21.5.4.4 Process Plant Operating Costs Summary 

The plant is designed for an initial ore throughput of 52.5 kt/d followed by an expansion to 
105 kt/d, both at an availability of 92.0%. Processing costs include labour, power, maintenance 
materials, reagents and consumables, mobile equipment, and ongoing metallurgical testing. 
Summarized costs provided in Tables 21-9 and 21-10 include the capitalization of the first 
month of process operating costs (included in Owner's costs in the capital estimate) and also 
account for the six-month ramp up to full production for both mill lines. The estimated overall 
operating cost for the initial processing plant is $5.04/t of ore milled, reducing to $4.76/t of ore 
milled after expansion.

21.5.5 General & Administration (G&A) 

The estimated cost for G&A expenses is based upon the level of service required for the size of 
Dumont's operation and takes into account existing local services. The costs summarized in 
Table 21-11 are almost entirely fixed in nature, with the result that unit costs at 105 kt/d fall to 
little more than half the rate for the initial 52.5 kt/d scope of project.

employee annually for personnel working a five-day week. 

• Computer hardware and software. Employees using computers would incur costs of $5,100 
pa, which accounts for 80% of personnel using common productivity software with a three-
year replacement schedule while the remaining 20% would require more expensive software 
with annual licenses. 

• Safety equipment. All employees would receive $945 pa worth of personal protective 
equipment.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

22.1 Summary 
This economic analysis of the Dumont Feasibility Study focuses on the base case, which 
includes use of conventional (diesel powered) truck haulage and does not include the use of 
trolley-assisted trucks. The base case also assumes production of a nickel concentrate that 
would be sold to third parties, and does not include the potential benefits from magnetite as a 
byproduct.  

Salient metrics for this base case are presented in Table 22-1. Note that costs and returns have 
been presented using the assumed macro-economic parameters provided in the next section, 
as the exchange rate is expected to vary in the short to medium term, the IRR for the C$ and 
US$ cases differs. As per the summaries in Section 21, capital costs include first fills of 
consumable items and their associated release at the end of project life.  

All amounts expressed are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated.

22.2 Assumptions 
Table 22-2 provides price and exchange rate assumptions that have been used in the base 
case evaluation. With the exception of the forecast price for acid (a key reagent in the mill 
process), forecasts are based on consensus forecasts by Canadian base-metals equity 
analysts.

Other key assumptions included in the base case analysis are as follows: 

• Each of the two process plant lines would ramp up to nameplate production of 52.5 kt/d over 
six months. 

• The metallurgical recovery for Ni as forecast by the model is based on the Standard Test 
Program (STP) of 105 samples. LOM recovery is forecast to average 43.0%. The average 
metallurgical recovery for Co is assumed to be 42.0%, almost equal that for Ni, which is 
based on the understanding of Co deportment to recoverable minerals and associated 
approximate recoveries for these minerals. The average recovery of Pt and Pd is based on 
the results of lock-cycle testwork, with recovery expected to average 62.5% and 60.7% for Pt 
and Pd, respectively. 

• Off-site costs are US$64/t concentrate for transport (average based on shipment to a variety 
of destinations).  

• Long-term electricity prices of $44.45/MWh, which is based on the current L-rate tariff for 
Quebec and Dumont's expected demand profile. 

• Long-term prices for acid of US$72/t in 2018, US$71/t from 2019-2024 and US$70 from 2025 
onward that were based on a market study performed by the consulting group CRU 
Strategies. 

• The following assumptions are based on the prior experience of RNC management: 

- US$175/t concentrate for smelter treatment and US$0.80/lb for nickel refining inclusive 
of price participation. This equate to US$1.20/lb over the project life.  

- The cost of refining byproduct cobalt and PGE was assumed to equate to a further 
US$0.07/lb Ni over the project life (US$3.00/lb for Co and US$50/oz for PGE). 

- Smelter deductions for nickel and cobalt are assumed to be 7% and 50% (for payables 
of 93% and 50%, respectively). Deductions for PGE are assumed to be 1 g/t, with the 
average concentrate grade of 4.3 g/t resulting in life-of-project payables of 77%.  

• Working capital has been calculated based on the following (based on the prior experience of 
RNC management unless otherwise noted): 

- Contractual terms for the sale of concentrate would make provision for payment for 90% 
of concentrate value within 30 days and the remaining 10% in 60 days. 

- Accounts payable would be settled within 30 days. 

- First fills for the mine and G&A areas have been calculated based on a stores holding of 
one month for all consumable items with the exception of tires (four months), diesel (five 
days) and electricity (no holding). No advance purchase of mine maintenance items 
would be required as these would be held on a consignment basis. First fills for the 
process plant have been calculated by Ausenco from first principles.

NPV is reported using a discount rate of 8%. NPV is expressed in real, Q2 2013 terms with the 
start date for discounting being the commencement of project construction in September 2014. 
No material expenditures are included in the economic analysis prior to this date.  

Results were calculated on a pre-tax and post-tax basis. The post-tax results included the 
following assumptions regarding the fiscal regime: 

• Planned changes to income taxes announced in the 2013 federal budget have been included, 
specifically: 

- The 41A category, which allows for accelerated depreciation of a portion of initial capital 
plant purchases, will be phased out by 2020. 

- The CEE category, which provides for accelerated depreciation of all initial development 
expenditures, will be phased out by 2018. 

- The investment tax credit will be phased out by 2016.  

• Planned changes to the Quebec Mining Tax Code announced in March 2013 will be in place 
by the time the project commences production. These include: 

- Application of a minimum tax ranging from 1-4% depending on profitability. The 
methodology used to calculate pre-tax income for this minimum tax is new, and does not 
allow for accelerated depreciation of pre-production capital expenditures, so the 
minimum tax is incurred soon after the start of commercial production. 

- A variable tax that is applied to pre-tax income calculated in a manner similar to the 
previous legislation. The rate varies from 16% for a pre-tax profit margin of ≤ 35% to 
28% for a pre-tax margin of 50% or more. 

The calculated royalty payments include the assumption that the historic 2% and 3% NSR 
royalties will be bought down to 1% and 1.5%, respectively, as is provided for in the contracts. 
The buy-down would occur when the mine achieves commercial production. The calculated 
royalty payments include the Red Kite 1% NSR and assume that the 0.8% NSR royalty owned 
by Ressources Québec will be bought out in August 2017, as provided for in the contract. 

22.3 Base Case Results 
The total life of project can be subdivided into the following periods: 

• Construction for a period of 22 months, starting in September 2014; 

• Initial production at a concentrator throughput rate of 52.5 kt/d for 54 months to the end of 
December 2020; 

• Expanded production from the open pit, at a concentrator throughput of 105 kt/d, for 186 
months (14.5 years) to the end of June 2036; and 

• Production from stockpiles following the completion of open pit mining. The concentrator 
continues to operate at a rate of 105 kt/d for an additional 158 months (12 years, 2 months) to 
the end of August 2049.  

Summary metrics for each of these periods are presented in Table 22-3. It can be seen that the 
cumulative NPV to the end of pit life is $930 M or 70% of the project total. The remaining 30% of 
project NPV ($399 M) is realized during the period that the low-grade stockpile is reclaimed, 
with the benefits of lower costs offsetting lower grade and recovery.

Figure 22.1 provides a life of project graph of cash flow. The following information is highlighted: 

• The peak funding requirement of $1,320 M (in 2013 real dollar terms) is reached three 
months after the start-up of commercial operations (the operation is forecast to be operating 
cash flow positive during the first quarter of operation and free cash flow positive from the 
second quarter of operation). 

• The financial returns are unlevered and assume 100% of the initial capital will be provided 
from equity. However, it is likely that a portion of the capital will be provided from debt. The 
assumed timing of the expansion has been based on the estimated time to repay the initial 
debt financing.  A potential project debt financing of approximately 60% would result in initial 
borrowings of approximately $800 M, sufficient free cash flow to repay this amount of debt 
finance could be achieved within 34 months of operation, which would allow for re-investment 
in the expansion of concentrator capacity to 105 kt/d. Approximately 80% of the investment 
required for the expansion would be generated from internal free cash flows during the 
construction period, with additional capital of approximately $210 M required. The expansion 
is commissioned after month 54. Following expansion to 105 kt/d, annual post-tax free cash 
flow averages approximately $312 M/a for the period that the pit is operational (or $457 M/a 
on a pre-tax basis). 

• Payback of all invested capital (including the expansion) is achieved approximately six years 
after initial start-up. 

• The project generates in excess of $218 M post-tax free cash flow annually, while the low-
grade stockpiles are being treated ($318 M/a on a pre-tax basis). 

Table 22-4 provides detailed metrics for the life of mine cash flow, with time periods presented 
as years after start-up (start-up planned for Q3 2016).

Key items leading to the change in NPV are as follows: 

• Increasing the throughput of each mill line by 5% to 52.5 kt/d will accelerate Ni output and 
reduce the impact of fixed overhead costs (mainly G&A expenses). The benefit to the project 
of the increased throughput is $159 M (US$144 M). 

• For the revised PFS, approximately 75% of PGE mineralization was classified as Inferred 
Resources, primarily due to uncertainty regarding the ability to recover low-grade material, 
and was thus excluded from reserves. The remainder (approximately 250 koz) would produce 
average concentrate grades of 0.9 g/t, which is less than the smelter deduction of 1.0 g/t, 
resulting in materially no payable metal. Further testwork performed during the FS confirmed 
the ability to achieve PGE concentrate grades in excess of 4 g/t, resulting in payable 
production of 490 koz. The benefit to the project of payable PGE output is $97 M (US$88 M). 

• The pit shell has been expanded, to yield an additional 112 Mt ore, representing 
approximately three years' additional production at the full production rate of 105 kt/d. The 
additional ore provides a benefit of approximately 3% to the project NPV, or $38 M 
(US$34 M).  

• The mining costs forecast for the FS ($1.64/t ex-pit material excluding rehandle of low-grade 
stockpiles, or $1.82/t ex-pit material when the cost of rehandling low-grade stockpiles is 
included) is approximately 19% higher than the cost forecast for the revised PFS. 
Approximately 11% of the cost increase results from use of conventionally powered trucks, 
compared to trolley-assist that was assumed for the revised PFS. The NPV impact of trolley 
assist was $46 M in the revised PFS (US$41 M); it is expected a similar benefit would be 
realized for the FS design.  

• Mining costs are also higher due to increased use of smaller hydraulic excavators, particularly 
in the initial years of mine production when they will provide increased flexibility at a lower 
capital cost than the rope shovels that were planned in the revised PFS. As well, the layout 
has been revised with TSF and dump locations effectively reversed (to minimize the impacts 
of dust and noise to nearby communities), resulting in longer haulage profiles. As the total 
impact of higher mining costs is $205 M (US$186 M), the impact of higher cost mining 
equipment and longer hauls (excluding the impact of trolley-assist) is estimated at $159 M 
(US$145 M). 

• The initial capital cost for the FS is only 3% higher in Canadian dollar terms, with increased 
costs for the process plant being partially offset by reduced pre-stripping and associated 
mining costs along with a stronger Canadian dollar and the impact this will have on US dollar 
denominated purchases. The capital cost for the expansion is 22% higher, due to higher 
costs for the plant and tailings storage facility (TSF), while sustaining capital costs are 11% 
lower. The net impact of higher capital costs is $64 M (US$59 M). 

• The overall recovery of Ni is approximately two percent  lower than forecast in the revised 
PFS, due to changes in the recovery equations from additional testwork, specifically in the Hz 
Dominant Domain, and a more conservative capping of the block model to reflect the input 
limits of the STP data set. The impact of lower recovery is $228 M (US$205 M). 

• In US dollar terms, the initial capital cost for the FS is 8% higher. 

• The FS incorporates a profile for prices for metals, oil (and hence diesel fuel), acid and the 
exchange rate over the short to medium term. This profile is based on the consensus of 
analyst forecasts. From 2018 onwards, flat long-term prices are used (with the exception of 
acid – only reaches long-term price in 2025). The net impact of the FS macro-economic 
forecast is an improvement in the C$ NPV of $90m, reducing to only $22 M in US dollar 
terms, due to variation in the exchange rate. Note that the profile in the exchange rates

assumed is the reason the Canadian dollar IRR of 15.9% is higher than the US dollar IRR of 
15.2%.  

• Approximately 47% of the drop in NPV in Canadian dollar terms can be attributed to the sale 
of royalties to Resources Québec and Red Kite, with proceeds from these sales being used 
to fund project development. The impact in US dollar terms is lower, at 37% of the total drop.  

• Revisions to both the corporate income tax and provincial mining tax regimes, along with a 
number of other factors, in aggregate account for a reduction in NPV of $19 M (US$17 M). 

22.5 Sensitivity Analysis 
The project is most sensitive to factors impacting on revenue as well as the Canadian vs. US 
dollar exchange rate. Figure 22.4 illustrates that a ±10% variation in any of the factors impacting 
revenue (Ni Price, Ni Recovery) is 37% and symmetric, with the percentage increase in NPV for 
higher revenue equal to the percentage decrease for lower revenue. Note that variation in 
recovery is on a relative and not an absolute basis. A change in exchange rate produces 
asymmetric outcomes, with the upside from a 10% decrease in the exchange rate (a 36% 
improvement in NPV) is greater than the reduction in NPV resulting from a 10% strengthening in 
exchange rate (30% decrease in NPV). Payables represents a ±10% change to the smelter 
deduction (base case assumption is 7%), with a 10% change resulting in a symmetric variation 
in NPV of 3%.

The project returns are less sensitive to the variation of other parameters – with a 10% variation 
in site operating costs having a 17% impact on project NPV. With the staged development plan, 
returns are less sensitive to capital costs and a 10% change in total capital cost has a lower 
impact, at only 11% of NPV. The impact of a 10% variation in TC/RCs is approximately half that 
of capital cost, at 6% of base case NPV. The project is less sensitive to variation in the cost of 
energy, with a 10% change in the price of either power or oil (diesel fuel) having only a 3% 
impact on project NPV. Project returns are insensitive to changes in byproduct prices (2% 
impact) or the cost of acid (<1% impact).

Tables 22-5 to 22-10 tabulate the sensitivity of the project NPV, IRR, cash flow, EBITDA and 
cash costs to the same parameters. Note that in all tables, Ni payables are expressed as the 
variance in smelter deductions (±10% = 0.7 percentage points from 92.3% to 93.7%). The 
following can be seen: 

• At higher discount rates, the importance of capital cost and exchange rate increases relative 
to all other parameters.  

• The post-tax breakeven Ni prices (NPV = $0) are as follows: 

- 8% = US$7.00/lb (22% lower than base case forecast); 

- 9% = US$7.25/lb (19% lower than base case forecast); and 

- 10% = US$7.50/lb (17% less than base case forecast) 

• Cash costs are relatively insensitive to variation in the price of key consumables, with a 10% 
change in the prices of power and diesel (oil) having an impact of ~1% on gross cash costs.

24 OTHER RELEVANT DATA & INFORMATION 

24.1 Base Case Design 

24.1.1 Site Wide Geotechnical Overview 

24.1.1.1 Introduction  

Geotechnical data (for both soil and rock) was collected at the Dumont project area using a 
variety of field and laboratory procedures between late 2010 and late 2012. The work was 
performed in phases and addressed all major mine facilities as well as the proposed open pit. 
The site investigation commenced with the development of a terrain map based on aerial 
photographs. Overburden field investigation programs, including test pits, trenches, sonic 
drilling, metasonic drilling and cone penetration tests, were completed in the overburden soils 
around the property. Core drilling of the bedrock was largely confined to the proposed open pit 
and the plant site area. Laboratory testing was carried out on select samples to evaluate the 
engineering properties of each soil and rock unit. The results of these programs are 
summarized in a series of reports by SRK (SRK, 2011 and 2013).  

A summary of the morphology of the local soils, the geotechnical data collection methods, and 
the corresponding findings, with a specific focus on the soils (overburden) at the property, are 
presented in the sections below.  

24.1.1.2 General Morphology of the Soils 

The region in and around the Dumont property has been glaciated numerous times. The 
bedrock surface has been shaped, in part, by glacial scour. Multiple glacial and post-glacial 
deposits are therefore responsible for most of the regional soils. These include till, glaciofluvial 
sand and gravel, glaciolacustrine silt and clay, fluvial sand and gravel. More recently, organic 
deposits have formed over much of the site.  

Numerous subdued bedrock outcrops are evident over the site with a generally greater 
concentration of outcrops in the northern half of the site. Between the outcrops, discontinuous 
dense to very dense till pockets often overlie the bedrock. The till is typically overlain by dense 
to very dense glaciofluvial sand and gravel from outwash channels. Glaciolacustrine silt and 
clay of varying consistency are generally present in flat, low laying areas. Fluvial sand and 
gravel from post glacial process are found along the existing streams and rivers. Exclusive of 
the outcrops and active stream channels, most of the site is covered by topsoil and, in some 
depressions, by peat. 

24.1.1.3 Site Investigation 

Terrain Analysis 

The terrain analysis was based on 1:15,000-scale black and white air photographs covering a 
10 km x 9 km rectangle between longitudes 78°23.75' and 78°34' and between latitudes 48°36' 
and 48°42'. The air photo interpretation was digitized and, with the benefit of surveyed bedrock 
outcrops, was superimposed on a 1:20,000 map. Available drill hole data were used to calibrate 
the interpretations, the results of which are summarized in a report and terrain map (SRK, 
2011).

Cone Penetration Testing 

Two phases of cone penetration testing (CPT) were undertaken using a track-mounted vehicle 
specifically built for CPT programs. In total, CPT probes were completed at 143 locations. The 
electronic piezocone measured parameters such as tip pressure, sleeve friction and porewater 
pressure every 5 cm as the cone was advanced into the ground. Pore pressure dissipation and 
seismic tests were carried out in select locations to provide additional information on soil 
characteristics. The CPT was terminated in each hole when the probe met refusal, which 
occurred in very dense soil or when bedrock was encountered. The CPT results from each 
probe hole are summarized as a series of plots showing tip pressure, sleeve friction and 
porewater pressure, along with the interpreted soil profile of the probe hole (SRK, 2011 and 
2013).  

Sonic Drilling Program 

Drill holes were completed over the course of two drilling programs at 129 locations using a 
track-mounted sonic drill rig. The sonic drill employs high frequency, resonate energy to 
advance the core barrel and casing into the ground. The drill hole plan and locations were 
strongly influenced by site accessibility, particularly in relation to areas outside the proposed 
open pit. Core recovery was high and was complemented by various field performance tests to 
evaluate the geotechnical properties. The groundwater level was measured immediately after 
completion of each drill hole and a number of monitoring and pumping wells were installed for 
field permeability testing. An array of other laboratory tests were subsequently completed on 
select samples obtained during the drilling program. A log of each drill hole was prepared and 
the laboratory test results were added to the respective drill hole log (SRK, 2011 and 2013). 

Other Field Programs 

Overburden test pitting, trenching, metasonic drilling and overburden diamond drilling programs 
completed the site investigation. The test pits were completed using an excavator at 67 
locations around the project area, while seven trenches were excavated at the plant site, also 
with an excavator. Metasonic drill holes were completed at 84 locations using a lightweight, 
tripod-mounted drill that penetrated soft overburden soils (clay and silt) but met refusal on 
compact/dense soils or bedrock. Lastly, a total of 27 NQ-sized holes were completed in the 
vicinity of the plant site using a diamond drill equipped with a split tube core recovery system. 

24.1.1.4 Site Soils  

The soils present at the project area typically fall into the following major classifications (in a 
generally descending stratigraphic order):  (1) organic soil, (2) clay, (3) silt and silty soil, and 
(4) sand and gravel. The general geotechnical characteristics of each of these major soil 
classifications, as determined from the site investigation, are provided below. 

Organic Soil 

Where present, the organic soils are encountered at ground surface and typically consist of 
topsoil or peat with thicknesses ranging between 0.5 and 1.5 m. The topsoil is typically a dark 
brown, poorly graded, high plasticity material comprised of clay, silt, sand, some gravel and 
organics. The peat is brown, amorphous and likely soft to very soft. It tends to be present in flat 
or low lying areas and is, therefore, typically saturated.  

Clay 

The clay varies in thickness from approximately 2 to 15 m and is generally encountered in flat, 
low lying areas immediately below a layer of organic soil. The clay typically has medium to high 
plasticity and, as such ranges from CL to CH according to the Unified Soil Classification System

(USCS). The upper 1 to 1.5 metres of clay is generally light brown and moist with a firm to stiff 
consistency. This consistency can persist with depth if the total thickness of soil overlying 
bedrock is less than about 6 to 8 m. However, in locations where the clay is thicker than about 6 
to 8m, the properties of the clay change significantly with depth. Over an interval of 1 to 2 m, the 
clay typically becomes grey and wet with a consistency that can range from very soft to firm. 
CPT data indicates the undrained shear strength of the grey clay in these locations can be as 
low as 10 to 30 kPa. Furthermore, the clay can be quite sensitive, meaning there can be a large 
difference between the peak (undisturbed) strength and the residual (highly disturbed) strength. 
Table 24-1 shows the summarized field and laboratory test results. Figure 24.1 shows the 
gradation results for the clay and Figure 24.2 summarizes the Atterberg Limits results in a 
plasticity chart.

Silt & Silty Soil 

The silt and silty soil occur throughout the project area at various depths, with thicknesses that 
range from 1 to 16 m. They have been grouped as a single soil type that is generally associated 
with till or glaciofluvial deposits and can contain gravel, sand and clay. This unit ranges between 
having no plasticity and medium plasticity and, as such, ranges from CL-ML to MH. This soil is 
typically greyish-brown silt with more than 76% of material passing the No. 200 sieve. The silty 
material often contains lenses of coarse sand within a fine grained matrix. Overall, the silty soils 
found on site are soft to stiff, with estimated unconfined compressive strength values that range 
from 0 kPa to greater than 400 kPa. Furthermore, some of the field tests show the silt material 
will exhibit sensitivity potentially at a level similar to the clay unit. Table 24-2 shows the 
summarized field and laboratory test results for the silt and silty soil. Figure 24.3 shows the 
gradation results for this soil.

Sand & Gravel 

The sand and gravel in the area have been grouped as a single soil type which is generally 
associated with post-glacial fluvial activity or as eskers from glacial outwash. The sand and 
gravel material is located in eskers and in lenses with the dense silty material with thicknesses 
that range between 1 and 40 m. It is typically a medium dense to very dense brown sandy

24.1.1.5 Borrow Materials 

Borrow materials will be required, as a minimum, for the construction of the following: 

• access roads; 
• pads for laydown areas and working surfaces in the plant site area; 
• dams (engineering components of the TSF and water management structures); 
• containment structures for grey, wet clay at the overburden stockpiles; and 
• containment structures for grey, wet clay excavated from the water management structures 

(ponds and ditches). 

The specific materials required for use as borrow will largely consist of gabbro and basalt waste 
rock that would be mined as waste. These rock types will both be available in outcropping areas 
that will be mined during the pre-strip as well as throughout the entire life of mine and it is 
expected there will be an adequate supply for all construction requirements. In the event there 
was insufficient supply available in the short term, granular material, such as the sand and 
gravel that is present at depth over large portions of the open pit could also be used.  
Compactable clay is needed for dams at the TSF and for select parts of some water 
management structures. The firm to stiff brown clay that will be excavated from the open pit will 
be the principal source of compactable clay. All of the required borrow materials will be obtained 
from stripping (or quarrying) operations at the open pit. 

24.1.1.6 Aggregate 

The principal use of aggregate will be for concrete associated with the construction of the plant 
site infrastructure.  

Testwork has confirmed the gabbro and basalt waste rocks are excellent materials for 
aggregate, containing very low levels of impurities that are deleterious to concrete. As with 
borrow material, gabbro and basalt would be produced by stripping operations, and then 
crushed at a plant located close to the primary crusher. This plant would subsequently be used 
for the roadstone crusher. 

24.1.2 Plant Site  

24.1.2.1 Location 

The plant site will be located northwest of the open pit and east of TSF Cell 2, and will be 
aligned in a northwest-southeast direction to take advantage of the presence of a series of large 
bedrock outcrops. The suitability of these bedrock outcrops as a foundation for the large, 
settlement-sensitive structures required as part of plant site design was a key factor in the siting 
and layout of the plant site infrastructure.  

24.1.2.2 Geotechnical Database 

The geotechnical database in the proposed plant site is comprised mainly of bedrock outcrop 
mapping, test pits, trenches, metasonic drilling and overburden diamond drilling. A few CPT 
probes and sonic drill holes in the vicinity of the plant site complete the data base. 

24.1.2.3 General Stratigraphy & Geotechnical Conditions 

The overburden stratigraphy at the plant site mainly comprises granular material (sands and 
silts) overlying bedrock, with prominent outcrops in the south part of the mill and near the 
crusher. Fine grained materials (silt and clay) were encountered in some locations, but in 
general their presence is not common at the plant site. The usual thickness of the granular 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

24-10 

  

overburden is about 8 m and can change significantly over short distances. Deep overburden 
pockets up to 52 m of thickness can be found at the location of the ore feed stockpile. 

24.1.2.4 Design Recommendations 

Foundation design recommendations for the plant site infrastructure can be summarized as 
follows: 

• Heavy, settlement-sensitive structures should be founded on bedrock. Foundations can be 
placed directly on rock in the outcrop sites and in shallow rock, or on piles when the rock 
surface is buried deeply. 

• Lighter structures may be founded on shallow foundations placed on sand and silt provided 
they meet the bearing capacity and settlement requirements. Otherwise, they should be 
founded on shallow bedrock to the extent possible, but where this is not possible, 
consideration should be given to raft-style foundations or end-bearing piles. 

• Shallow foundations should be placed 2.5 m below the ground surface in order to take into 
account the frost depth. 

To the extent practicable, the infrastructure should avoid the grey, wet, very soft to firm clay. 
However, where it cannot be avoided, the selected foundation will have to satisfy the allowable 
settlement and bearing capacity criteria. 

24.1.3 Project Implementation  

24.1.3.1 Implementation Strategy 

RNC recognizes that project implementation affects all aspects of project development, 
particularly capital cost, schedule, and risk management. As such, a preliminary project 
implementation strategy has been prepared. 

RNC has prepared a strategy for the Project's implementation and contracting strategy and 
overall approach to construction. The resulting strategy has, and will continue to, guide the work 
being conducted in connection with the feasibility study. The strategy contemplates the 
development of the Project on an EPCM basis with the contractor being responsible for project 
design, purchase of supplies, equipment and services. Additionally, all or portions of the 
process plant may be constructed on a fixed price, turnkey EPC basis. The EPCM contractor, in 
these circumstances, would assist RNC in the management of the individual EPC contractors.  

During the engineering phase of the project, the EPCM Contractor will develop a contracting 
plan setting out the scope prior to the EPCM Contractor award, certain construction packages 
for early site activities may be developed for tender and award. These contract packages may 
cover bulk earthworks packages, infrastructure work, construction power distribution, temporary 
facilities, site preparation and concrete supply, material, and equipment requirements for the 
field construction effort.  

The Contract Packages are anticipated to include Major, Minor, Service and Technical Support 
Contracts similar to the following distribution. This distribution may be modified to fit Qualified 
Contractors ability to perform and support multiple discipline activities and have the corporation 
depth to man and provide the major construction equipment for such an effort.  

Conversely, some areas of common construction may have multiple contractors working 
adjacent to each other in order to support the schedule or weather imposed time restraints, i.e. 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

24-11 

  

Pre-engineered Process Building being divided between the Grinding Area, Floatation Areas 
and the balance of the building including Scavenging/Cleaning and Concentrate load out. 

The EPCM Contractor is to understand, that even though the Contract "Philosophy" is for large 
horizontal contracts, flexibility to meet the schedule is important.  

RNC will optimize opportunities to expedite a timely construction start and maximize the site 
construction progress prior to winter impacts. 

Prior to mobilization, an EPCM Contractor kick off meeting will have been held with RNC and 
schedule, deliverable items and potential qualified contractors will already be selected and on 
board.  

Work will begin on: 

• the overall site development for access, stripping, bulk excavations, drainage control and 
work area development; 

• preparation of the temporary facilities:  trailers, laydown and warehouse areas; 
• prepare the access construction road into the project site; and 
• extension of the 13.8 kV power to the contractor area. 

As soon as the EPCM Contractor trailer facility is complete, the EPCM Contractor will mobilize a 
limited field force to oversee and install the temporary power, fresh water relocation and 
coordinate the initial construction issues. 

Initial major earthwork will be by the RNC. Mining group and will set the stage for mobilization of 
the early construction and supply contracts. Development of the site grading will open the site 
for the balance of the identified contracts and material/equipment receiving. At this point, the 
work will become discipline driven with multiple parallel operations. 

As the detailed excavations continue and the areas open up for concrete, the project will be able 
to support construction activities on all fronts from the Primary Crusher through the concentrate 
load out.  

Engineering and procurement activities will become construction driven to support the field and 
measures taken to establish winter weather protection with temporary structures and heaters. 

Key to this is the erection of the grinding building over the SAG and ball mill areas. Structural 
steel can be erected during cold weather but consideration is to be given to roofing and siding 
installations concerning wind and snow. The building erection will need to be erected concurrent 
with the foundation work and precautions taken for overhead and ground personnel safety. 

Procurement of the mill process buildings will be an early activity. To include all of the buildings 
with priority of: 

• grinding bays; 
• desliming; 
• floatation; 
• cleaning/scavenging; 
• concentrate load out; 
• stockpile storage enclosure; and 
• primary crusher structure. 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

24-12 

  

It is anticipated that the erection of these structures can be concurrent activities due to the size 
and distinct profile of each section.  

Enclosure of the process buildings is critical in maintaining construction activities during the 
winter months and maintaining scheduled milestones. 

Summer 2015 will be key for construction of the coarse ore stockpile enclosure and adjacent 
conveyors from the primary crusher and the sag mill feed conveyor. 

Concurrent with the completion of the process equipment, conveyors and piping the final road 
grading, site grading, and cleanup will be done. The temporary construction facilities will be 
demobilized on a progressive basis, contractor contracts closed out and a systematic turnover 
of the project to the Operations Group will be completed. 

The EPCM Contractor will supplement the team with commissioning engineers and technicians 
assigned to each defined commissioning area, and assist in the planning of work and 
completion of testing in each area. 

The EPCM Contractor will be responsible to develop comprehensive commissioning safety and 
tagging procedures specific to the Dumont project. The procedures are to address the transition 
from construction to commissioning and from commissioning to RNC operations. 

The definition of the project implementation strategy will continue to evolve where it will guide 
and inform commercial and logistical evaluations undertaken with the ultimate aim of optimizing 
and de-risking the project's development and construction. 

24.1.3.2 Project Schedule 

The summarized project schedule is shown in Figure 24.5. The current schedule shows: 

• The overall schedule duration from the start of basic engineering in order to procure long-lead 
equipment to the end of ore commissioning is 36 months. Key milestone dates are described 
in Table 24-4. 

• The duration of the schedule is driven primarily by the construction permit approval, early 
purchase of long lead equipment, detailed engineering, and SAG mill installation. 

• The approval of the C of A in Q3 2014. 

• Approval of a Site Construction Permit is scheduled for Q3 2014.  

• The project as described in this feasibility study will form the basis for the Environmental and 
Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). 

• Geotechnical drilling for detailed engineering will commence in Q3 2013 and be completed by 
Q4 2013. 

• Basic engineering will commence in Q3 2013, with a commitment to purchase major 
mechanical capital items like the mills, mill motors, primary crusher, and flotation cells in Q4 
2013. 

• Award of the EPCM contract will be in Q4 2013, with full engineering effort commencing in Q1 
2014.

− one contractor for the supply and operation of explosives facility 

− one contractor to supply the mining fleet 

− one contractor to execute the pre-strip earthworks 

− one contract for the supply and installation of all field piping. 

Ideally, the number of site contractors should be minimized, although this may be dictated by 
market and commercial considerations at the time. 

24.1.4 Closure & Rehabilitation Plan  

24.1.4.1 Background & Project Sequencing  

The closure and rehabilitation plan was takes into consideration the specific requirements 
outlined in the Guidelines for Preparing a Mining Site Rehabilitation Plan and general Mining 
Site Rehabilitation Requirements (MRN and DEF 1997) published by the Quebec jurisdictional 
authorities.  

The Dumont project will be comprised of five stages of significance to the implementation of the 
closure and rehabilitation activities described in the plan. The five stages and their principal 
operational activities are as follows: 

• Stage 1 (Year 2 to start-up):  Pre-stripping and early development of the pit; construction of 
the mine infrastructure including the starter dam of the TSF beginning with the first tailings cell 
(TSF Cell 1). 

• Stage 2 (Start-up to approximately Year 6):  Continued development of the open pit; mineral 
processing and operation of TSF Cell 1. While analysis conducted to date suggests that a 
water treatment plant would not be required at this stage of the project, it may prove 
necessary. 

• Stage 3 (approximately Year 7 to Year 22):  Development of the open pit to its maximum limit; 
mineral processing; construction/operation of the second tailings cell (TSF Cell 2) and 
construction of the water treatment plant (if not constructed in Stage 2) and operation as 
needed; closure and rehabilitation of TSF Cell 1 occurs early in this stage.  

• Stage 4 (approximately Year 23 to Year 35):  Processing of the ore from the low-grade ore 
stockpile, deposition of the tailings in the open pit and operation of the water treatment plant, 
as needed; closure and rehabilitation of TSF Cell 2 occurs early in this stage, along with 
closure and rehabilitation of the overburden stockpiles, portions of the waste rock dumps and 
the footprint of the low-grade ore stockpile; ongoing monitoring and potential rehabilitation of 
those elements closed during this or previous stages. 

• Stage 5 (from Year 33):  Operation of the water treatment plant, as needed; flooding of the 
open pits; closure of any remaining elements; and monitoring and potential rehabilitation of 
those elements closed during this or previous stages.

24.1.4.2 Objectives  

The overall closure objective is to establish stable chemical and physical conditions that protect 
the environment and human health. To the extent practicable, rehabilitation efforts will endeavor 
to return the site to a condition which generally conforms to the surrounding terrain. The site will 
be monitored and maintained post closure in order to demonstrably meet these conditions. 

In determining the most suitable closure strategy for each infrastructure component, the closure 
criteria were aligned with the requirements for closure and rehabilitation as detailed in MRN and 
DEF 1997. The following closure criteria were considered during this process: 

• demolish and remove all construction and camp and industrial facilities and rehabilitation of 
affected footprints 

• achieve long-term slope stability of all dumps/piles 

• establish adequate vegetation density to ensure erosion protection of the soil slopes 

• re-establish vegetation on areas returned to normal land use. 

24.1.4.3 Closure & Rehabilitation Activities 

The project facilities or areas, and the timing of the corresponding closure and rehabilitation 
activities, are summarized in Table 24-5. The general closure and rehabilitation activities for 
each of the project facilities or areas are summarized in Table 24-6.

24.1.4.4 Post-Closure Monitoring & Maintenance 

Post-closure monitoring to confirm that the closure objectives are being met will be based on the 
following typical activities: 

• regular inspections of the various project facilities by professional engineers and revegetation 
specialists; and 

• annual seepage and surface water sampling programs designed to monitor the changes in 
local water quality. 

Maintenance will be performed on areas that monitoring identifies as needing repairs. 

24.1.5 Cost Benchmarks 

As will be discussed below, the capital and operating costs forecast for Dumont are considered 
achievable due to its unique site specific features and have been validated by appropriate 
benchmarks. 

24.1.5.1 Capital Costs 

The capital cost to construct Dumont is expected to be favourably impacted by its location and 
proximity to infrastructure already in place, along with features of the deposit that will be mined 
and processed.  



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

24-18 

  

Specifically: 

• Proximity to the towns of Amos, Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda obviates the need for a 
construction camp. 

• As the property is bordered by a highway and crossed by a rail line, no significant 
expenditures are required for transportation links.  

• The property can be fed electricity from an existing high voltage line that is approximately 
10km distant. The cost of installing a connection to this line will ultimately be borne by Hydro 
Quebec.  

• The deposit has a low strip ratio and the starter pit outcrops at surface, resulting in a low 
tonnage of pre-stripping and modest initial fleet requirements. 

• The process flowsheet is conventional  

• The proximity to infrastructure, low tonnage of pre-stripping and straightforward mill flowsheet 
are expected to allow construction to be completed in a short time frame.   

Key benchmarks that were referenced during the generation of the Dumont initial capital cost 
estimate of $1,268 M include the following:  

• Based on public disclosure, Osisko's Canadian Malarctic gold mine was understood to be 
constructed for $1,029 M. This mine is located approximately 65 km from Dumont, and its 
scale and processing operations are similar to what is planned at Dumont. Note that capital 
costs for Canadian Malartic included approximately $170 M for community resettlement, 
which will not be required at Dumont. Construction of Canadian Malartic was completed 
within 18 months. 

• Copper Mountain's open pit copper mine of the same name, located near Princeton, British 
Columbia. The mining rate for this operation is comparable to Dumont, while the nameplate 
concentrator throughput of 35 kt/d is approximately 65% of that planned at Dumont. Based on 
public disclosure, Copper Mountain was understood to be constructed for $429 M.  

24.1.5.2  Operating Costs 

Operating costs are also favourably impacted by location and features of the deposit that will be 
mined and processed. Specifically: 

• Proximity to the towns of Amos, Val d'Or and Rouyn-Noranda obviates the need for camp-
based accommodation at the mine site. The distance to these towns is such that workers will 
have a relatively short commute. 

• The mining cost per tonne mined is expected to be low given factors that include the massive 
nature of mineralization (allows for use of large rope shovels), high production rates and very 
low abrasion index for 75% of rock that will be mined. Coupled with the low strip ratio of 
approximately 1.1:1, this will result in a low cost per tonne of ore.  

• The processing cost is expected to be low due to the low cost of power in Quebec (currently 
less than 5₵/kWh), large scale of operation and low abrasion of all ore that will be treated.  

The key benchmark that was referenced during the generation of the Dumont site operating cost 
estimate of $9.18/t ore (life of project average) was Taskeo's Gibraltar open pit mine located in 
BC. Despite a much higher stripping ratio of approximately 4:1, Gibraltar reported site costs of 
$9.10/t in 2011 and $10.72/t in 2012. Note that 2012 costs were adversely impacted by a 
scaling up of output in advance of the completion of a mill expansion. Attention is particularly 
directed to the mining costs at Gibraltar, which are reported to be $1.03/t mined in 2011 and 



 
 

Report No: 2280 
Rev:  0 
Date:  25 July 2013 

24-19 

  

$1.33/t in 2012; the 2012 cost being approximately 20% lower than the $1.68/t life of mine 
average forecast for Dumont. 

24.2 Opportunities 

24.2.1 Trolley-Assisted Truck Haulage 

24.2.1.1 Background 

A typical diesel-electric haul truck utilizes a diesel engine to drive a traction alternator, which 
produces the electricity used to drive the wheel motors. The truck's control cabinet conditions 
the power, in terms of volts and amps, so the motors will provide the desired speed and torque - 
much as a transmission would do in a mechanical drive truck. The speed of the vehicle on 
grade is limited by the horsepower output of the diesel engine. With trolley assist, two 
pantographs are mounted to the front of the truck so that electric power can be collected from 
overhead lines. The lines are supported by rigid poles, and electricity is fed to the line by a sub 
station. Additional control devices are added to the truck, so that power from the overhead lines 
can be properly applied to the wheel motors (Figure 24.6). 

When on trolley, a truck's diesel engine and alternator are not used for propulsion. The engine's 
speed automatically drops to an idle, with all the power for propulsion coming from the overhead 
lines. The speed of a diesel-powered truck is limited by its engine horsepower, but the speed of 
a trolley truck is limited by the capabilities of its traction motors (and inverters, on AC drives).

Savings realized from trolley assist can be categorized as follows: 

• Energy cost savings – which occur as power is supplied to wheelmotors from an overhead 
line (and thus from the electrical grid) rather than being generated using the on-board 
diesel engine. The value of savings is a function of the kilometers traveled on trolley and 
the relative prices for fuel and electricity.  

• Productivity Savings – which result from the increased speed of haul trucks traveling uphill 
on trolley, with improvements of almost 100% being possible. This allows the mine plan to 
be achieved with fewer trucks and an associated reduction in labour.  

• Reduced maintenance costs – the maintenance interval for diesel engines can best be 
modelled as a function of fuel consumption. With the lower consumption rate for a truck 
traveling on trolley, the interval between overhauls / replacements can be extended. 

In addition to the cost benefits listed above, trolley assist also has significantly environmental 
benefits, resulting from the reduction in particulate matter and greenhouse gases associated 
with generating energy from hydro-carbons. 

The savings associated with trolley-assist are partially offset by costs associated with operating 
the system that include: 

• Fixed infrastructure – including the trolley line, pole and substation. 
• Truck infrastructure – including the pantograph and associated on-board control devices. 
• Ongoing maintenance of fixed and truck-based infrastructure. 
• Wider ramps –to accommodate trolley-assist infrastructure (primarily the sub stations), the 

width of equipped ramps would be increased by 5 m. This could result in flatter overall 
slopes and increased waste stripping. 

24.2.1.2 Application of Trolley-Assist at Dumont 

The base case mine design for Dumont was determined by iteration and the selected design 
maximized overall project NPV for the base case design criteria. As design criteria for the trolley 
assist option are materially different than the base case (e.g., the mining cost ≥ 10% lower, 
wider ramps necessitate increased stripping), the optimal design for trolley assist will likely be 
different than the current base case. A trolley operation would aim to maximize the tonnage 
travelled on trolley-equipped ramps, which could impact the overall ramp geometry and 
sequencing of LG stages (see Section 16, Figure 16.6 previously). There is sufficient flexibility 
inherent in the current Dumont design to accept changes that would optimize a trolley operation.  

As the current base case is not optimized for a trolley operation, a detailed feasibility level 
discounted cash flow analysis of the trolley option has not been performed. Rather, a high level 
assessment was conducted to determine the potential benefits of the system. 

This assessment showed the base case design included sufficient traffic on the hanging wall – 
north (HW – N) and footwall – north (FW – N) ramp systems to justify installation of trolley. The 
hanging wall – south (HW – S), footwall – south (FW – S) and southeast pit (Q) systems did not 
have sufficient traffic to justify trolley. See Figure 24.7 for an illustration of the ramp systems at 
the end of mine life.

Figure 24.7:  Dumont Ramp Configuration

For reasons that include the overall depth of hauls and density of traffic, trolley would not be 
implemented before yr4 of mill operation (2020). From this date onwards, approximately 80% of 
material mined exits from the HW-N and FW-N ramp systems. There is also sufficient traffic on 
the ramp accessing the various lifts of waste rock dump 1 (WR1) and low-grade ore 1 stockpile 
(LGO1) to justify an installation. After taking account of the expected trolley line utilization, 
approximately 60% of total uphill hauls over the life of mine could be transported using the 
system.  

This level of trolley utilization would result in diesel savings for the production haul truck fleet of 
approximately 350 million litres, or approximately 35% of base case consumption. The diesel 
consumption would be replaced by approximately 1.8 GWh of power, or approximately 
0.7 kWh/t mined. For the assumed prices of diesel and electricity that were used in the base 
case evaluation, energy savings would total approximately $250 million over the 16 years of 
expit operation that trolley-assist would be operated. Energy savings would represent 
approximately 80% of the gross operating cost savings from trolley, or 90% of the net savings 
after the application of system maintenance costs.  

Offsetting these operating cost savings are the capital costs associated with a trolley system. 
The trolley system envisaged would reach a maximum installed length of approximately 12 km.

The system would be relocated when ramps were pushed back, with each of the two ramp 
systems considered for installation (HW-N and FW-N) being pushed back once. A total of 21 km 
of line would be installed during the life of mine, with 12 km being equipped with new 
infrastructure and the remaining 9 km with infrastructure that was being re-used (i.e., relocated 
when a ramp is pushed back). The cost of installing new infrastructure would total approximately 
$4 M/km, while the cost of re-installing infrastructure would be approximately 75% less. It is also 
possible that widening of the HW-N and FW-N ramps by 5m each would flatten overall slopes, 
though the incremental waste that would be associated with such flattening has not been 
quantified. Finally, implementation of trolley assist would require modifications to haul trucks, 
including installation of the pantograph and associated wiring and controls that would total 
approximately $0.5 M per truck.  

The single most important issue that must be addressed in order for trolley to be successfully 
implemented at Dumont is the impact of weather – particularly the spring freshet – on road 
conditions. Uneven road surfaces will cause the pantograph to lose contact with the line, with 
the truck being rejected from line (and thus reducing system utilization) and possibly inflicting 
damage on the system through arcing. This will be addressed through the planned use of 
roadstone to continuously resurface all haul roads. It should be noted that trolley-assist has 
successfully been used in similar climates, including the Labrador Trough (at Lac Jeaninne – 
the world's first trolley assist site) and Nevada (at Barrick's Goldstrike, where annual snowfall is 
approximately 50% that at Dumont). One benefit of trolley-assist is that the enforced discipline 
of maintaining roads results in improved haulage cost performance, such as in speeds achieved 
and tire life. 

Trolley-assist remains a significant potential opportunity for Dumont. Developments will continue 
to be monitored prior to a final decision on implementation – which under the current schedule 
would likely be in 2019. 

24.2.2 Magnetite Byproduct 

24.2.2.1 Introduction 

Prefeasibility testwork assays indicated that there are significant quantities of magnetite in the 
tailings of the awaruite circuit. As a result, RNC requested that Ausenco complete a conceptual 
study to investigate the flowsheet amendments required and potential economic benefits of 
implementing a magnetite separation circuit. Some of the testwork undertaken also investigated 
the process requirements to produce a saleable magnetite product.  

24.2.2.2 Laboratory Testwork 

Dumont ore grades approximately 4% magnetite. Preliminary testing was performed to evaluate 
whether this could be upgraded to a saleable product. Most of the magnetite in the feed reports 
to the magnetic concentrate and is then sent to tails stream after sulphide and awaruite 
recovery. 

A sample of the magnetic concentrate from the 2011 mini-plant campaigns was reground to 40 
µm and underwent a series of sequentially decreasing magnetic separation stages to determine 
the optimum gauss to produce a high-grade magnetite concentrate. 

Table 24-7 shows the results from 5 discrete samples from different areas of the deposit.

24.2.2.3 Design Criteria 

The major design criteria outlined in the concept study are primarily composed of recent 
magnetite testwork data and testwork data and design criteria from the PFS.  

Table 24-8 shows the assumed feed grades to the plant and feed grades of the streams feeding 
the proposed magnetite circuit. The magnetite circuit as referred to in this report is inclusive of 
the regrind mill and the awaruite circuit because recirculating streams around the magnetic 
separators have an affect on those areas.

24.2.2.4 Flowsheet 

The proposed magnetite separation circuit includes a four-stage cleaner separation; 1st stage 
non-magnetics report to the tailings thickener and the non-magnetics of the following stages are 
recirculated to the regrind mill. Additionally, the awaruite 1st cleaner scavenger concentrate 
reports to the regrind mill as opposed to the head of the awaruite 1st cleaner as it did in the 
original PFS flowsheet. These flowsheet changes (as well as a finer regrind target grind size) 
will increase the power requirement of the regrind mill. 

Figure 24.8 below is the overall flowsheet from the PFS. The streams and equipment affected 
by the addition of a magnetite separation circuit are boxed with a dotted line. The flowsheet 
shown in Figure 24.9 represents the replacement to the contents of the dotted box in Figure

24.2.2.5 Capital Costs (2012) 

The conceptual capital cost estimate (C$M, ±40%, 2012) has been prepared using pricing 
obtained during the PFS and was derived by factoring equipment costs and benchmarking 
against other Ausenco in-house data. Indirect costs were factored based on total mechanical 
equipment costs using in-house data and previous Ausenco experience with similar projects. A 
summary of the capital cost estimate is displayed in Table 24-10.

24.2.3 Ferronickel Process Option 

24.2.3.1 Testwork Summary 

A 1 kg sample of concentrate, generated from the 2010-2011 locked cycle tests, underwent 
laboratory scale testing smelting tests. The concentrate grade was approximately 31% Ni. The 
laboratory testwork was completed by Kingston Process Metallurgy. 

The concentrate was first roasted to remove the sulphur and then underwent a reduction 
process to make ferronickel. 

The tests produced a high-grade ferronickel between 55-61% Ni. The main impurities are 
copper and cobalt.

24.2.3.2 Marketing Impact 

The concentrate that RNC anticipates will be produced from Dumont is ideally suited for utilizing 
this type of roasting and reduction process as the nickel and iron content of the Dumont 
concentrate is expected to be relatively high, grades of other metals such as copper and cobalt 
are expected to be relatively low, and impurity levels for elements such as phosphorus, arsenic, 
and other impurities are expected to be very low. 

The target RNC ferronickel specification is shown in Table 24-12. 

Table 24-12:  Target RNC Ferronickel Specification 

Element Target (%) 
Nickel 55-60 
Iron Balance 
Cobalt <0.4 
Copper <0.7 
Carbon <0.2 
Phosphorus <0.01 
Sulphur <0.15 
Silicon <0.2 

 

This alternate downstream processing option has the potential to yield significant economic 
benefits for the Dumont project versus conventional smelting and refining by increasing the 
potential value realized to 98-99% from 92-93% of nickel contained in concentrate due to higher 
recoveries, lowering costs due to a simpler, cheaper processing path, and earning a product 
premium due to production of a final ferronickel product. 

RNC also believes that this alternate downstream processing option also significantly increases 
third party processing options for the concentrate anticipated to be produced from Dumont as 
there are a large number of electric furnaces already operating in China, Korea, and, Taiwan. 

24.2.3.3 Memorandum of Understanding  

In March 2013, RNC announced it had entered into a memorandum of understanding ("MOU") 
with Tsingshan Holding Group Co., Ltd. The MOU sets out the objectives of the two companies 
to work together in relation to downstream concentrate processing and the potential to enter into 
an offtake and/or partnership arrangement with respect to the Dumont project. Tsingshan is the 
second largest Chinese stainless steel company and one of the leading innovators in the 
development of vertically integrated NPI and stainless steel production operations. After working 
in cooperation with RNC for more than a year, Tsingshan completed its own analysis and 
testwork on a sulphide nickel concentrate (utilizing a process similar to the one tested by RNC) 
in its integrated NPI/stainless steel production facilities and plans to make the necessary 
investment in plant and equipment once concentrate feed is secured. This innovation represents 
the first time that nickel sulphide concentrate would have been used directly to create stainless 
steel. This contemplated plant is also expected to be capable of handling nickel sulphide 
concentrate like that anticipated to be produced from Dumont.

25 INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS 
The following conclusions arise from the information provided in the previous sections: 

• The Dumont deposit represents a significant ore reserve that remains open at depth and 
along strike to the northwest. 

• Reserves are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.15% nickel inside an engineered pit design 
based on a LG optimized pit shell that was generated using a nickel price of US$5.58/lb, 
which is 62% of the long-term forecast of US$9.00/lb, average metallurgical recovery of 43%, 
marginal processing and G&A costs of US$6.30/t milled, long-term exchange rate of C$1.00 
equal US$0.90, overall pit slopes of 42° to 50° depending on the sector and a production rate 
of 105 kt/d. Mineral reserves include mining losses of 0.28% and dilution of 0.49% that will be 
incurred at the bedrock overburden interface, which corresponds to mining losses of 1 m and 
2 m of dilution along this contact. 

• It has been demonstrated that the deposit can be economically developed using large-scale 
open pit methods.  

• This scope of design is estimated to require an initial capital investment of $1,268 M, an 
expansion capital investment of $997 M and sustaining capital of $823 M. 

• Over the 33-year project life, Dumont is expected to produce 2,774 Mlbs of payable nickel 
and the equivalent of a further 150 Mlbs payable nickel in by-product cobalt and PGE. The 
average cost to produce nickel over the entire life is $4.79/lb, and includes lower costs of 
$4.44/lb in the initial five years of production. 

• Based on a long-term Ni price of US$9.00/lb and C$ exchange rate of US$0.90, the after-tax 
NPV8% for the project is $1.3 billion while the after tax IRR is 16%. There is consequently 
justification for approving construction of the project. 

• A key element of the mine plan is the accelerated release of ore relative to the requirements 
of the mill. The open pit mine is thus completed after 20 years, compared to the 33-year life of 
project. The costs associated with stockpiling 606 Mt lower value ore are more than offset by 
the elimination of risk that the mill will be undersupplied with ore from the mine, the favourable 
Ni production profile and ability to impound 43% of tailings in the mined-out pit. 

• The design is optimal for the alternatives that were considered during this phase of work. 
Nonetheless, there are likely further opportunities to enhance the design, including a 
steepening of slope angles, acceleration of access to higher value ore and increased 
electrification of the pit. 

• The mine plan is achievable but should not be considered conservative. Good systems and 
practices will need to be implemented at an early stage to meet the plan. Mine plan 
optimisation is heavily dependent on sinking rate in order to follow down dip the highest 
revenue ore. Multiple pushbacks are planned with up to three stages being mined at one 
time. Top notch mine planning will be required along with high productivities to achieve the 
planned sinking rates and tonnages. The rock conditions are favourable and water pumping 
is not expected to be onerous. The mine benefits from multiple ramp access design and long 
strike lengths of mining faces. It is expected and planned that reduced productivities and 
higher costs will be experienced on the top levels while mining through the overburden and 
establishing the upper benches in rock. Opportunities to improve results over the FS plan lie 
in achieving higher productivities, lower costs and adjusting the sequence to follow the better 
ore as geological and metallurgical knowledge is gained. There is essentially no risk of the 
plant not having sufficient feed as the mine capacity far exceeds the mill. The high mine

25-2 

  

capacity allows the mine to send high value ore to the plant while stockpiling the lower grade 
material. Therefore in essence, mine plan optimisation revolves around the time value of 
money and moving metal production (through treating ores with higher grade and recovery) 
forward in time.  

• A staged development approach has been adopted to mitigate technical and financial risk 
during the initial years of operation. The processing plant will initially be comprised of a single 
line with a nameplate throughput of 52.5 kt/d. The plant will be expanded to two lines with a 
nameplate throughput of 105 kt/d after 54 months.  

• The groundwater regime is not expected to negatively impact the open pit design based on 
the hydrogeology work carried out to date. Groundwater inflows to the open pit are expected 
to average 5,000 m3/d. 

• Groundwater drawdown at the Launay Esker is expected to be minimal. Preliminary 
modelling using the PEA pit estimates drawdown at approximately 0.1 m at the end of pit 
operations. The draw down effect of the pit will then reduce as it is partially refilled with 
tailings.  

• The Dumont sill and immediate hanging and footwall are characterized as a relatively strong 
anisotropic (sill parallel) rock mass, punctuated by oblique and parallel to sub-parallel fault 
damage-zones. 

• The bearing capacity of surficial deposits and subsurface conditions at key development 
sites, such as the plant site, tailings deposition area, and waste dump area have been 
considered from a geotechnical perspective for the envisioned project development. 

• Environmental geochemistry characterization of tailings, waste and ore indicate that these 
materials will be non-acid-generating due to their low sulphur content and high neutralization 
potential. Static tests indicate that waste rock, tailings and ore are leachable under the 
conditions of the tests, but more site-condition representative laboratory and field tests 
suggest that mine wastes will leach low levels of rock-derived constituents. 

• The testwork proved that the Dumont material could be processed in a conventional wet 
grinding circuit followed by hydrocyclone desliming, nickel flotation and magnetic recovery. 
The cleaning circuit is a multiple stage circuit with a regrind on the magnetic concentrate and 
cleaner tails. 

• The Dumont mineralization increases in hardness as the particle size decreases which is 
typical for many deposits. The average hardness results for 102 samples are as follows:  Axb 
54, BWi 21, RWi 15, CWi 14, and Ai 0.009. 

• The rougher recovery equations were divided into four categories based on Hz/Pn ratio and 
degree of serpentinization. LOM Ni recovery averages 43% at a head grade of 0.27% Ni. 

• Flotation testwork indicates that nickel recovery is relatively insensitive to grind sizes (P80) up 
to about 150 μm. 

• The locked cycle tests showed a large range of cleaner recoveries based on the grade and 
weight recovery of the rougher concentrate and the level of nickel in silicates in the sample. 

• Both rougher and cleaner nickel recovery is driven by the sulphur assay in the feed or the 
ratio of S/Ni in the feed. 

• The most effective unit operation for improving flotation performance is an aggressive 
desliming stage to remove the fine particles that cause viscosity problems in the rougher 
stage. 

• The life of mine average concentrate grade is 29%. 

• Cobalt recovery was estimated at 42%.

• The main impurity in the concentrate is MgO, which ranges between 3% and 13%. Other 
impurities, such as As, Pb, Cl, and P, were all near or below detection limits in the measured 
concentrate samples. 

• A trade-off study was conducted to compare the costs of transporting nickel concentrate by 
truck and by rail. It was decided to include a rail spur as the assumptions in the economic 
analysis transport 50% of the Dumont nickel concentrate overseas from a port in Quebec. 
The most economic option was a truck-rail combination, where concentrate is trucked to an 
existing transfer facility in Rouyn-Noranda for furtherance by rail to Sudbury for the remainder 
of the concentrate. 

• In order to limit environmental impact to one drainage basin, RNC has elected to contain 
project infrastructure within the Villemontel-St. Lawrence drainage basin. Consequently, the 
Chicobi River watershed will not be impacted by the project. Both watersheds, however, were 
covered in the environmental baseline studies. 

• Current project definition is sufficient to provide a basis upon which most anticipated social 
and environmental impacts can be identified and assessed through the environmental and 
social impact study. Principal impacts anticipated at this stage relate to air quality, wetlands, 
fish habitat, water resources, and the social environment.  

• The major project risks, as demonstrated by the financial analysis, are those parameters 
related to revenue, specifically nickel recovery, percentage payables and selling price for 
nickel. Project returns are also sensitive to the USD/CAD exchange rate. 

• The project is less sensitive to other risks, including capital and operating costs. Returns are 
relatively insensitive to the cost of individual consumable items, such as power, oil and acid. 

• Political, labour, location, environmental, social, and permitting risks are generally 
commensurate to those experienced by other mining projects in the Abitibi region of the 
province of Quebec and are considered low by global standards.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS  
Recommendations for future work are listed below. 

• Complete detailed design that considers the following points: 

− Evaluate opportunities for pit optimization, including: 

o Alternative mining sequences that may allow access to higher value ore to be 
accelerated and/or deferral of waste stripping. 

o Evaluate alternative ramp locations in the pit stages taking advantage of changes 
in wall slopes. 

− Re-evaluate use of trolley assisted truck haulage as an option based on fuel and 
electricity market rates. 

− Begin detailed engineering in Q3 2013 to procure long lead equipment in order to 
maintain the Q3 2016 plant operational date. 

− Undertake detailed geotechnical evaluations of the early rock exposures, throughout the 
open pit areas, to assess the reliability of structural and geotechnical models. Optimize 
design based on field performance of pit slopes in the various geotechnical domains. 

− Continue to evaluate pore pressures within the pit slope areas to verify the assumption 
that these will have a limited impact on slope stability. 

− Conduct further geotechnical investigations in order to complete detailed engineering 
design of all surface infrastructure, including the plant site and related facilities, rail lines, 
TSF Cell 1, the low-grade ore stockpile within the pit limits, and water management 
features that have a significant earthworks component to them and are required within 
the first two years of operation. 

− Implement a metallurgy testwork program that will include:   

o Trade-off study to evaluate removal of slimes circuit 
o Reagent optimization testwork
