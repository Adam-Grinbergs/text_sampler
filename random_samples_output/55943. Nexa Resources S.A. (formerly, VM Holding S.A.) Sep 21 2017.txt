1 Summary 
This report was prepared as a National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical Report, Preliminary 
Economic Assessment (Technical Report or PEA) by SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK), for 
Votorantim Metais Holding S.A. (Votorantim) with Solitario Zinc Corp. (Solitario), (collectively, owners) 
on the Florida Canyon Zinc Project located in Amazonas Department, Peru (Florida Canyon or 
Project). The Project name was changed in 2017 from Bongará, as it was called previously, to Florida 
Canyon. 

This study represents the advancement of the Project from a 2014 Technical Report on Resources, to 
this 2017 PEA. Highlights of this PEA include a thirteen-year life-of-mine underground mine plan, 
comminution and flotation of zinc and lead concentrates at a nominal production rate of 2,500 mill 
throughput tonnes per day followed by dry-stack tailings storage. Site infrastructure includes line power 
to the site, water distribution systems, a townsite and access roads for construction and re-supply as 
well as for concentrate transport to the point of sale. 

A key development in the preparation of this PEA was the addition of new metallurgical data that 
provided an accurate ratio of zinc oxide to zinc sulfide. The ratio allowed block-by-block recovery to 
be estimated. For each block in this polymetallic (zinc-lead-silver) deposit a Net Smelter Return value 
was calculated, making the definition of mineable mineralization independent of material type. The 
deposit naturally contains a high percentage of zinc sulfide mineralization; but using the new approach, 
most of the transition and some of the oxide materials are also suitable for flotation processing when 
they carry sufficient recoverable metal. 

This Technical Report was prepared in support of a press release issued by the owners on August 2, 
2017, in which economic results were reported. Those economic results are summarized herein.

Alternative Economic Case Study 

The owners also requested SRK to evaluate the Project economics under a specific alternative metal 
price structure. This alternative used a pricing of US$1.06/lb, US$0.88/lb, and US$18.19/oz for zinc, 
lead, and silver respectively. The alternative case also used a higher discount rate of 9%. All other 
economic inputs were kept the same as the base case.

Results of the alternative case study: 

• All-in Cost per Zinc Pound Recovered: US$0.72; 
• After tax NPV at 9%: US$106 million; 
• After tax Internal Rate of Return (IRR): 19.1%; and 
• After tax payback Period: 3.2 years.  

Both the base case and alternative case economics are detailed in Section 22 of this report. 

1.2 Property Description and Ownership 
The Florida Canyon Zinc Project (the Project) is owned and operated by Minera Bongará S.A., a joint 
venture between Solitario and Votorantim in existence since 2006. Florida Canyon is an advanced 
mineral exploration project comprised of sixteen contiguous mining concessions, covering 
approximately 12,600 hectares (ha). The concession titles are in the name of Minera Bongará. All of 
these concessions are currently titled. 

The Minera Bongará concessions are completely enveloped by a second group of thirty-seven 
contiguous mining concessions, covering approximately 30,700 ha. The concession titles are in the 
name of Minera Chambara, also owned by the Owners. Of the thirty-seven concessions, twelve titles 
are pending. 

Votorantim, as operator of the joint venture company Minera Bongará, has entered into a surface rights 
agreement with the local community of Shipasbamba which controls the surface rights of the Project. 
This agreement provides for annual payments and funding for mutually agreed upon social 
development programs in return for the right to perform exploration work including road building and 
drilling. From time to time, Votorantim also enters into surface rights agreements with individual private 
landowners within the community to provide access for exploration work.  

The Project is located in the Eastern Cordillera of Peru at the sub-Andean front in the upper Amazon 
River Basin. It is within the boundary of the Shipasbamba community, 680 kilometer (km) north-
northeast of Lima and and 245 km northeast of Chiclayo, Peru, in the District of Shipasbamba, Bongará 
Province, Amazonas Department. The Project area can be reached from the coastal city of Chiclayo 
by the paved Carretera Marginal road. The central point coordinates of the Project are approximately 
825,248 East and, 9,352,626 North (UTM Zone 17S, Datum WGS 84). Elevation ranges from 1,800 
meters above sea level (masl) to approximately 3,200 masl. The climate is classified as high altitude 
tropical jungle in the upper regions of the Amazon basin. The annual rainfall average exceeds 1 meter 
(m) with up to 2 m in the cloud forest at higher elevations.  

1.3 Geology and Mineralization 
The Project is located within an extensive belt of Mesozoic carbonate rocks belonging to the Upper 
Triassic to Lower Jurassic Pucará Group and equivalents. This belt extends through the central and 
eastern extent of the Peruvian Andes for nearly 1000 km and which is the host for many polymetallic 
and base metal vein and replacement deposits in the Peruvian Mineral Belt. Among these is the San 
Vicente Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) zinc-lead deposit that has many similarities to the Florida 
Canyon deposit and other MVT occurrences in the Project area.  

Known zinc, lead and silver mineralization in the Project area is hosted in dolomitized limestone of the 
Chambara Formation subunit 2 in the Pucará Group. The structure at Florida Canyon is dominated by

a N50º-60ºW trending domal anticline cut on the west by the Sam Fault and to the east by the Tesoro-
Florida Fault. In the Project area, the three prospective corridors for economic mineralization studied 
in detail are San Jorge, Karen-Milagros, and Sam. In these areas, dolomitization and karsting is best 
developed in proximity to faulting and fracturing associated with each structural zone. In turn, these 
structures provided access for the altering fluids to flow laterally into stratigraphic horizons with more 
permeable sedimentary characteristics.  

The primary zinc-lead-silver mineralization of the Florida Canyon deposit occurs as sphalerite and 
galena. Sphalerite is low iron and together, zinc and lead sulfide is 70% of the mineable material. At 
shallow depths, these sulfide minerals are altered to smithsonite, hemimorphite, and cerussite and 
collectively referred to as oxides. The mineral suite is low in pyrite. 

1.4 Status of Exploration, Development and Operations 

 History 
Prior to the discovery of mineral occurrences by Solitario in 1994, no mineral prospecting had been 
done on the Property and no concessions had been historically recorded. In 1995 and later, Solitario 
and its joint venture partners staked the current mineral concessions in the Project area.  

In 1996, Cominco Ltd. formed a joint venture partnership (JV) with Solitario. This agreement was 
terminated in 2000 and Solitario retained ownership of the property. Between 1997 and 1999, Cominco 
completed geologic mapping, geophysical surveys, surface sampling, and 82 diamond drillholes. 

In 2006, Votorantim and Solitario formed a JV for the exploration and possible development of the 
property. As the operator of the JV company, Votorantim has carried out surface diamond core drilling, 
geologic mapping, surface outcrop sampling, underground exploration and drifting and underground 
drilling programs. As of August 15, 2013, Votorantim had completed 404 diamond drillholes which, 
when combined with the previous drilling of Cominco, totals 117,260 m.  

There has not been any commercial mining in the Project area. The only underground excavation has 
been 700 m of underground drifting by Votorantim to provide drill platforms at the San Jorge area. A 
subsidiary of Hochschild Mining PLC tested open pit mining for a short time at the Mina Grande deposit 
off of Project properties near the village of Yambrasbamba, 18 km northeast of Florida Canyon, where 
Solitario had previously defined an oxidized zinc resource by pitting. 

 Exploration Status 
The focus of Votorantim's most recent exploration work at the Project has been resource definition 
drilling with HQ-diameter core in the San Jorge and Karen-Milagros areas. Drilling in the San Jorge 
area was completed underground from an adit, while drilling in the Karen-Milagros area was completed 
from surface.  

Future exploration work will focus on infill drilling between the Karen-Milagros, San Jorge and Sam 
areas. Mineralization is open to the north and south and remains largely untested to the east of the 
Tesoro Fault and west of the Sam fault where greater target depths have lowered the near-term drilling 
priority.

 Development and Operations 
Road access to the Bongará region is provided primarily by the Carretera Marginal paved highway 
connecting the port city of Chiclayo to Pedro Ruiz (inland). Travel time to Pedro Ruiz takes on average 
6 hours by car. It is a regional commerce center with hotels, restaurants, communication and a 
population estimated to be 10,000. The immediate Project area is not populated but there are several 
small villages nearby, which are supported by subsistence farming.  

Current access to the Project is by foot, mule or helicopter. A road is under construction from the 
community of Shipasbamba. The Project area has little existing infrastructure with only an access road 
under construction and a number of primitive camps and drill pads. Drilling has been accomplished 
using helicopter support from the village of Shipasbamba which lies 10 km to the southeast. A Project 
core shed, office and sample storage facility is located in Shipasbamba.  

1.5 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Votorantim retained a metallurgical consultant, Smallvill S.A.C. of Lima, Peru (Smallvill) to perform 
metallurgical studies on Florida Canyon mineralization types in 2010, 2011 and 2014. All the 
metallurgical testing programs aimed to produce commercial quality concentrates from a polymetalic 
lead-zinc mineralization. The tested samples show heads grades significantly higher when compared 
to other known mineral deposits in the region. SRK has relied heavily on these studies for recovery 
and cost forecasting to develop cut-off grades for resource reporting.  

The majority of the resource is sulfide. The Florida Canyon sulfide resource consists of zinc and lead 
sulfides in a limestone matrix where zinc is in higher proportions than lead. There are no deleterious 
elements present in concentrates in high enough levels to trigger smelter penalties. 

The 2014 metallurgical testing focused on quantifying recovery in the transitional and oxide material 
as it relates to a measurable zinc oxide:zinc total ratio (ZnO/ZnT). The ratio was determined from 2,813 
samples from 423 drillholes with good spatial representation. Depending on their availability and 
applicability, samples were taken from either coarse rejects or pulp samples. The ratio was estimated 
into the block model for each metal of interest. SRK developed a sliding-scale recovery curve for each 
metal using the ratio.  

The recovery estimates for Florida Canyon relative to ZnO/ZnT are illustrated in Figure 1-1. Table 1-5 
provides the recovery estimates by material type. 

Table 1-5: Florida Canyon Metal Recoveries by Material Type 

Parameter Material Type Sulfide Mixed Oxide 
ZnOx/ZnT Ratio <= 0.2 0.2 to 0.8 >= 0.8 
Zn Recovery 93% (-0.8833 (ZnOx/ZnT) + 1.1067) * 100 40% 
Pb Recovery 84% (-0.7333 (ZnOx/ZnT) + 0.9867) * 100 40% 
Ag Recovery 56% (-0.4 (ZnOx/ZnT) + 0.64) * 100 32%

Anticipated concentrate grades used in cut-off grade calculations are 50% for both zinc and lead 
concentrates, the latter containing associated silver.  

SRK sees opportunities for more advanced test work to optimize the metallurgical flow sheet. Previous 
test work used conventional procedures that were not specific to Florida Canyon material types. 
Similarly, fines encountered in previous work were not handled appropriately, resulting in sub-optimal 
flotation. Sample selection is a key element and more site-specific test work is expected to enhance 
overall recovery projections at the next level of study. 

1.6 Mineral Resource Estimate 
Since the 2013 resource estimate (SRK, 2013), Votorantim conducted a considerable amount of 
resampling and metallurgical test work to determine recoverable sulfide and oxide grades for both zinc 
and lead to better understand recoverable metal in the deposit. This work led to a change in the 
definition of oxide, transition, and sulfide domains. In the 2013 model, oxide, transition, and sulfide 
domains were developed based on core logging and then individual metallurgical recoveries were 
assigned as to each domain. Following the 2014 metallurgical test work, it was determined that a 
quantitative approach utilizing the ratio of estimated oxide zinc grade to estimated total zinc grade 
would provide the best representation of the recoverable resource. 

The 2017 resource model was built by Votorantim and validated by SRK. Development of the 2017 
resource estimate involved two separate grade estimations. First, primary reporting grades were 
estimated using the same samples as the 2013 resource estimate. This estimate assigned the grades 
from which metal quantities were calculated in the resource. A second resource estimate was 
conducted using the Votorantim 2014 sample program to assign sulfide and oxide grades for both zinc 
and lead. These grades were used to calculate a zinc oxide to total zinc ratio (ZnOx/ZnT), which was 
then used to determine if material was oxide, sulfide, or mixed and to assign a recovery to each 
modeled block based on that ratio.  

The Mineral Resource estimate was based on a 3-D geological model of major structural features and 
stratigraphically controlled alteration and mineralization. A total of 23 mineral domains were interpreted

from mineralized drill intercepts, comprised mostly of 1 m core samples. The project is in metric units. 
Zinc, lead and silver were estimated into model blocks using Ordinary Kriging (OK). Oxide, Sulfide and 
Mixed material types were determined based on the ZnOx/ZnT ratio. Density was determined from a 
large percentage (55%) of measured values, which were used to develop equations for density 
assignment based on rock type and kriged metal content of the samples.  

Resources were reported to Measured, Indicated and Inferred classification compliant with CIM 
definitions according to NI 43-101 guidance. Blocks classified as Measured were estimated by 
Ordinary Kriging using at least three composites within 25 m in the major and semi-major search 
directions and 10 m in the minor search direction. Blocks classified as Indicated were estimated by 
Ordinary Kriging using at least three composites within 50 m in the major and semi-major search 
directions and 20 m in the minor search direction. Blocks classified as inferred were estimated by 
Ordinary Kriging using at least two composites within 100 m in the major and semi-major search 
directions and 40 m in the minor search direction. A fourth category was flagged in the model including 
blocks estimated beyond the limits above. 

SRK validated the Votorantim model using the following criteria: 

• SRK independent grade estimate compared to the Votorantim grade estimate; 
• Visual comparative analysis between composite and block grades; and 
• Statistical comparison of global averages of the original composite values and the model 

estimates. 

SRK concludes that the model is adequate if not slightly conservative for the deposit and is suitable 
for use in preliminary mine planning. 

The Mineral Resource estimate for the Florida Canyon zinc-lead-silver deposit is presented in Table 
1-6.

• Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that 

all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into Mineral Reserves. 
• Grades reported in this table are "contained" and do not include recovery. 
• Mineral resources are reported to a 2.8% recovered zinc-equivalent (RecZnEq%) cut-off grade. 

o Assuming the average recoveries for the resource, this corresponds to non-recovered cut-off grade of 3.6% 
contained ZnEq%. 

• RecZnEq% was calculated by multiplying each block grade by its estimated recovery, then applying mining costs, 
processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, smelting costs, and transportation costs to determine an 
equivalent contribution of each grade item to the Net Smelter Return. 

o Mining costs, processing, G&A, smelting, and transportation costs total US$74.70/t. 
o Metal price assumptions were: Zinc (US$/lb 1.20), Lead (US$/lb 1.0) and Silver (US$/oz 17.50), 
o As the recovery for each element was accounted for in the RecZnEq%, recoveries were not factored into the 

calculation of the 2.8% cut-off grade. 
o Average metallurgical recoveries for the resource are: Zinc (79%), Lead (72%) and Silver (50%) 
o The equivalent grade contribution factors used for calculating RecZnEq% were: (1.0 x recovered Zn%) + (0.807 

x recovered Pb%) + (0.026 x recovered Ag ppm). 
• The contained ZnEq% grade reported above was calculated by dividing the RecZnEq% grade by the calculated zinc 

recovery. 
• Density was calculated based on material types and metal grades. The average density in the mineralized zone was 

3.01 g/cm3. 
• Mineral Resources, as reported, are undiluted. 
• Mineral Resource tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the precision of the estimate and numbers 

may not add due to rounding. 

 

1.7 Mineral Reserve Estimate 
No Mineral Reserves were estimated as part of this PEA. 

1.8 Mining 
Both longhole open stoping with backfill and cut and fill mining methods have been selected for the 
mine planning work. The mining method selection was based on the mineralization shape, orientation, 
and the desire to put tailing material underground. Geotechnical assessment of the orebody shape 
and ground conditions confirmed the mining method selection. The design parameters have been laid 
out using empirical design methods based on similar case histories. Cut and fill opening sizes are 3 m 
x 3 m and stopes are 3 m wide x 16 m in height. 

An NSR approach was used to calculate the value of a block. Two products will be produced, lead and 
zinc concentrates. The lead concentrate will contain a payable amount silver. Stope optimization within 
VulcanTM software was used to determine potentially economically minable material, based on the 
NSR value and a cut-off of US$42.93 for cut and fill areas, and a cut-off of US$41.40 for longhole 
areas. The stope optimizer output shapes were visually inspected and isolated blocks (i.e., small 
blocks far from larger groups of blocks or where additional development is not practical or economically 
feasible) were removed from the mining block inventory. The resource model was queried against the

final stope optimization shapes to determine tonnes and grade of material inside the shapes and 
mining dilution and recovery factors were applied. 

A development layout was created to provide access to the mining levels and to tie levels into ramps. 
Access to the underground workings will be via three main portals (San Jorge, P01 and P03). An 
additional portal (P02) will be used primarily for ventilation, and three additional drifts will daylight to 
facilitate ventilation. 

The tonnes and grade of the resource material contained within the mining blocks, adjusted by 
recovery and dilution, and categorized by the resource classification is provided in Table 1-7. The mine 
plan resource consists of a total of 11.2 Mt with an average grade of 8.34% Zn, 0.90% Pb, and 
11.3 g/t Ag and is made up of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred material. Estimated average dilution, 
processing recoveries and the ZnOx/ZnT ratio is also provided in Table 1-8.

* NSR is calucalted using variable recoveries based on sulfide/oxide ratios (recovery ranging from 32%-93%), a Zn price of 
US$1.20/lb, a Pb price of US$1.00/lb, an Ag price of US$17.50/oz. The transportation charge is US$70.00/t conc, Zn treatment 
charge of US$115/t conc, Pb treatment charge of US$100/t conc, Zn refining charge of US$0.115/lb Zn, and Pb refining charge 
of US$0.1/lb Pb. These factors were used for mine planning and vary somewhat from the final economic model. 
** ZnEq estimate is based on a NSR value of US$19.62 per 1% Zn. The US$19.62 is calculated using a Zn price of US$1.20/lb, 
a Pb price of US$1.00/lb, an Ag price of US$17.50/oz. The ZnEq also includes TC/RC and transportation costs and assumes 
an average Zn recovery of 78.15% which differs somewhat from that presented in the economic model. An example of the NSR 
to ZnEq calculation is (148.16/19.62)/0.7815.

The PEA is preliminary in nature, that it includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them 
to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. Mineral 
Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

A production schedule was generated using iGantt software. The schedule targeted a production rate 
of 2,500 t/d (912,500 mineralized tonnes per year).

1.9 Recovery Methods 
Given the location of the deposit, it is anticipated three underground portals will be producing 
mineralized material at any given time. Because of the challenging topography and road conditions, 
trucking Run-of-Mine (ROM) mineralized material would demand a lengthy route from the underground 
portals to the plant's location. Instead, SRK has designed a set of conventional overland conveyors 
with a maximum slope of 20° to simplify the operation and significantly reduce the cost of transferring 
mineralized material from the mine portals to the process plant. A portable, primary jaw crusher is to 
be installed at each underground mine portal to ensure the ROM is adequately sized for the conveying 
system. 

Florida Canyon mineralized material will be processed using a conventional concentration plant 
consisting of three stage crushing, grinding using a single-stage ball mill to 80% minus 44 microns, 
and differential flotation to produce two final products: a zinc concentrate and a lead concentrate 
containing payable silver. The concentrate will be truck transported to the point of sale. Tailings will be 
used as backfill or filtered and conveyed to a dry stack tailings storage facility. 

The mill will process 2,500 t/d of fresh mineralized material, and produce approximately 287 t of zinc 
concentrate grading 50% Zn, 1% Pb, and 0.6 g/t Ag and approximately 46 t of lead concentrate grading 
50% Pb, 8.4 g/t Ag, and 6% Zn.  

The power requirements for the projected milling operation is estimated at maximum 3.5 MW. Power 
for milling operations will be supplied by a third-party as line power at an estimated cost of 
US$0.084/kWh. The water requirement for the mill at a capacity of 2,500 t/d is estimated at maximum 
20 liters per second. Water for processing will be acquired from surface water sources and as recycled 
water from tailings dewatering operations. Reagents and grinding balls, will be supplied by road from 
Pedro Ruiz and stored locally.  

There are potential synergies for processing oxide mineralization at Florida Canyon using expertise 
that Votorantim has gained at the Vazante and Morro Agudo mines in Brazil. These other existing 
operations have demonstrated success recovering hemimorphite, smithsonite, and hydrozincite, which 
may improve future recovery projections for Florida Canyon. 

1.10 Project Infrastructure 
Florida Canyon is a greenfield project with no substantive existing infrastructure. The communities in 
the region are small and cannot support the operation from an infrastructure standpoint so a camp will 
be required. The infrastructure requirements for the Project will include an upgrade to the existing 
26 km access road and the construction of an additional 24 km of support roads for access to mine 
portals, plant, and other infrastructure.  

Site facilities will include the processing plant, mine, crushers and conveyors for ore/waste 
transportation, mine backfill systems including a paste backfill plant and cemented rock fill plant, water 
supply piping and tank, a dry stack TSF, 400 person camp, septic system, potable water treatment 
system, site power distribution, health/safety environmental office, mine office, mine dry, rescue and 
first aid building, security gate house, truck scale, truck wash, laboratory, incinerator system, fuel 
storage and pumping system. 

Makeup water for the processing plant will be supplied from a local creek through a piping system to 
a storage tank that will also provide fire system water. The majority of the water requirements will be

provided by rainfall and recycle water from the dry stack tailings storage facility (TSF) returned to the 
processing plant facility. A third-party will supply line power through a hydroelectric power generator, 
transmission line, and substation owned by the third party with costs recovered through an electricity 
surcharge over the life of the Project. Zinc concentrate will be transported by 30 t over the road trucks 
to the Votorantim Cajamarquilla smelter near Lima. Lead concentrate will be trucked to the Port of 
Callao near Lima, and shipped to an overseas lead smelter. 

1.11 Environmental Studies and Permitting 
Environmental permits for mineral exploration programs are divided into two classes. Class I permits 
allow construction and drilling for up to 20 platforms with a maximum disturbance of 10 ha. A Class II 
permit provides for more than 20 drill locations or for a disturbance area of greater than 10 ha. 
Votorantim has filed applications for and received Class II permits for various phases of the Project 
and has filed and received the required associated permits.  

Permitting requirements for mining include an Estudio de Impacto Ambiental (EIA) that describes in 
detail the mining plan and evaluates the impacts of the plan on environmental and social attributes of 
the property. Baseline studies include air quality, surface and groundwater quality, flora and fauna 
surveys, archeological surveys and a study of the social conditions of the immediate property and an 
area of interest that includes local communities. Public meetings are required in order that local 
community members can learn about and comment on the proposed operation. Many of the baseline 
studies required for mining have been completed by Votorantim. 

1.12 Conclusions and Recommendations 

 General 
The Florida Canyon Zinc Project is a significant greenfields potentially underground mineable high-
grade zinc deposit containing associated lead and silver. The Project has a large land position and 
strong technical and financial backing through Solitario's earn-in JV partner Votorantim. While this 
document represents the first formal economic evaluation of the Project, Votorantim and Cominco 
report having previously spent over US$60 million on drilling, test work and strategic planning for 
development (Solitario, 2014). Current projections in the zinc metal market suggest a near-term 
reduction in zinc supply as current major producers exhaust reserves. 

SRK's site visit to the project on the ground in northern Peru found it to be a well-organized facility, 
with current QA/QC protocols in place for drilling data verification and validation. Material handling, 
core storage and security were all at or above industry standards.  

SRK used a number of methods to validate the Votorantim resource block model starting with a face-
to-face meeting with the modeler and following on with a thorough audit of the model source data, 
geologic modeling techniques, grade and tonnage estimation methods and classification protocols. 
SRK found these to be in line with industry standards, having been produced with recognized mining 
software, defensible data and reasonable assumptions. SRK was able to independently validate the 
model results.  

A significant component of the SRK input to this PEA was the development of the underground mine 
plan. Because Florida Canyon is a polymetallic zinc-lead-silver deposit, each model block in the mine 
model was evaluated on an NSR basis, which included an estimate of recovery. Recovery was

developed from a robust 2014 metallurgical campaign that characterized all expected material types. 
A recovered grade by block was used to build the underground stoping plan, complete with access, 
ventilation and an assessment of mine recovery and dilution. 

SRK is unaware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation or marketing factors that could 
limit or affect the resource stated in this document. The project will benefit from additional infill and 
exploration drilling, additional process-metallurgical test work, detailed engineering studies for 
infrastructure and tailings management and forward planning to clearly define concentrate transport 
and smelter costs.  

 Mineral Resource Estimate 
The current exploration model for the Project has been applied successfully in drillhole planning and 
resource definition. There is low risk to the Project if no additional exploration is completed. However, 
additional drilling for resource definition has a strong potential to expand the known resource extent 
and upgrade Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated. The most prospective targets include: 

•  Extension drilling south of the San Jorge zone and northeast of the Karen-Milagros zones are 
considered the highest priority to increase high-grade zinc sulfide mineralization. Both zones 
are open in the recommended areas of drill testing; 

• Infill drilling several large un-drill tested areas surrounded by mineralized zones within the 
mineralized footprint has the potential to significantly increase resources; 

• Extension drilling peripheral to the currently defined mineralized footprint; and 
• Further develop drill targets over the 20 km long northern Florida Canyon mineralized corridor 

where large areas of strong zinc in soil and rock chip geochemistry indicate the potential for 
additional mineralized zones.  

At present, the deposit is open laterally to the north and south as well as to the west and east on the 
downthrown sides of the horst that defines the limits of exploration to date. Gaps in the drill pattern 
within the footprint of the existing drilling provide another opportunity to increase resources where drill 
spacing limits the continuity of stratigraphically controlled mineralization. A constraint on effective 
exploration and delineation drilling in these areas is the access to drilling stations due to the rugged 
terrain. The completion of a road into the area will help to expedite future drilling and development 
programs by providing increased access and lowering costs.  

The discovery of the high-angle, high-grade San Jorge zone has prompted more emphasis on angled 
drilling, where most of the historic drilling is vertical to near-vertical and is therefore ineffective at 
locating and defining near-vertical structures. These "break-through" structures have been mapped on 
surface in several locations, but due to logistical constraints, have not been adequately drill tested for 
their down-dip continuity. Similarly, there appear to be additional drill targets at the intersection of the 
high-angle structures and the flat manto zones, where grades are locally enhanced. These 
concentrations may be present within the existing drilling footprint, but require additional drilling to 
delineate. The high grade and potential tonnage of such targets provide an incentive to locate and 
further define resources of this geometry. 

 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Processing of sulfide mineralization (zinc-lead-silver) from the Florida Canyon deposit is straight 
forward using conventional flotation to a concentrate followed by offsite smelting. Producing a

commercial quality zinc concentrate from mixed material needed to incorporate Dense Media 
Separation methods (DMS) in order to maintain high recoveries (80+%). A conventional flotation 
approach reached commercial quality (about 50% Zn) at the expense of lower metal recovery, with a 
similar outcome for the lead concentrate. It is SRK's opinion that conventional flotation should be able 
to achieve enhanced commercial level results (grade and recovery) under improved crushing, grinding, 
and flotation conditions.  

Available information about silver is very limited. The laboratory developed a relationship between 
lead's head grade and silver grade in the final lead concentrate. This relationship follows what is 
typically observed in this type of deposit, therefore as this stage of development it is assumed to be 
valid, but SRK recommends confirming it in the next testing phase of the project. 

To optimize recovery and grade when attempting to reach separation of the zinc and lead minerals 
into their respective commercial quality concentrates, SRK recommends approaching the selection of 
samples for the next phase of metallurgical sampling and testing: 

• The core logging needs to incorporate attributes like clay percent, clay type, RQD, oxide 
content, sulfide content; 

• Assaying of the core should include whole rock analysis; and 
• Collect samples for metallurgical testing representing distinctive zones in the deposit. Grade 

variability should be secondary criteria when selecting samples, but they must be reasonably 
close to what a potential mining operation would be able to deliver to the mill. 

 Mineral Reserve Estimate 
There were no Mineral Reserves estimated for this PEA. 

 Mining Methods 
Depending upon the geometry of the mineralized zones, SRK selected longhole stoping to be used in 
steeply dipping zones and mechanized drift-and-fill extraction methods in shallowly dipping mantos. 
Conventional room and pillar mining on a checkerboard pattern could be applied to specific zones of 
the Florida Canyon project, particularly in lower grade areas, and should be considered in future trade-
off studies at the prefeasibility level. Cemented paste backfill will be placed underground to increase 
mining recovery and to stabilize mined-out areas. Adits will provide access from the surface to the 
mineralized zones currently defined in the mine plan.  

Sub-level open stoping parameters for this study were based on empirical relations from case histories. 
As the project advances, additional geotechnical stability modeling using numerical methods is 
recommended. Karst topography is prevalent in the district and karst caverns were encountered during 
the excavation of the San Jorge Adit. Additional geotechnical and hydrogeological evaluation of this 
condition is required to ensure safe operating conditions in the underground mining. A crown pillar of 
30 m has been used for planning. This assumption should be reevaluated in future work. Overall, a 
cost-benefit analysis of ground support, dilution, mine recovery, and ventilation should be undertaken 
at the next level of study. 

Operating costs, which ultimately define NSR value and drive stope designs, were developed from 
benchmarks, analogous projects in the region, and commercial cost sources. SRK recommends a 
revision of these costs from first principles as the project advances.

SRK notes that there are likely opportunities to improve the production schedule. Opportunities include 
improved sequencing of high grade material and, potentially, a decrease in the pre-production 
timeframe. A more detailed design and schedule with corresponding trade-off studies, as well as more 
detailed construction timeframe estimates, would be required for the next phase of study. 

 Recovery Methods 
The Florida Canyon polymetallic zinc-lead-silver deposit can be processed using a conventional 
concentration plant consisting of three-stage crushing, grinding using ball mill, and differential flotation 
to produce two final products: a zinc concentrate and a lead concentrate. Detailed sizing and costing 
of the processing plant components will follow additional metallurgical testing proposed in this study. 
Power supply and water supply appear to be fairly well defined for the project, though additional studies 
may be needed to refine these services and the costs of these services to the project. 

 Project Infrastructure 
The Florida Canyon deposit is located in steep terrain in a remote part of northern Peru with moderate 
to high rainfall. These geographic and climatic conditions pose challenges to both access and 
infrastructure development.  

As presently understood, the key support services of power supply and water supply are available and 
part of a district-wide infrastructure improvement campaign being implemented by the Peruvian 
government and related third-party providers. The most significant advancement in the infrastructure 
investigation for the PEA was identifying the probability of hydroelectric power distribution to the site, 
as a lower cost alternative to on-site power generation. Water supply for operations appears to be 
straight forward, with abundant surface water available for mineral processing and camp support. 

The infrastructure component with the largest footprint and projected cost is the tailings storage facility. 
As part of this study, SRK has evaluated this as a dry stack facility in order to achieve geotechnical 
stability and reduce the area requiring reclamation. Trade-off studies are warranted to optimize 
moisture content, binding characteristics, and placement and compaction methods during tailings 
placement. 

 Environmental Studies and Permitting 
Additional environmental baseline studies are required for further project development.  

Impact to groundwater is expected to be minimal as underground surface exposures are minor and 
future exposed sulfides are not acid generating. There are no groundwater wells required for 
processing or potable water supply. There will be little or no surface area disturbance related to waste 
rock placement. 

Tailings are predicted to have low amounts of iron sulfide and to be geochemically stable with respect 
to acid rock drainage. There is also substantial neutralization capacity in the carbonate host rocks to 
mitigate acid generation. Residual lead and zinc sulfides have low acid-generating capacity; however, 
they are subject to metal leaching and therefore require compaction during placement.  

SRK recommends in future studies to design the tailings surface and spillway stormwater structure 
and evaluate options to reduce or eliminate the long-term obligation for monitoring and maintenance.

 Recommendations – Work Programs and Costs 
SRK acknowledges, after examination of the Project data set, that there have been a significant 
number of technical studies completed by Votorantim, many of which are beyond PEA. Therefore, the 
work elements listed in Table 1-9 represent mostly prefeasibility and feasibility level engineering and 
drilling to support those studies.  

At the juncture where prefeasibility level engineering has been completed, the Project will likely warrant 
further public reporting to an international standard (JORC, or NI 43-101). Technical information 
required to achieve this level of project development are listed in Table 1-9. A cost estimate for these 
work elements is included in the table.

2 Introduction 
2.1 Terms of Reference and Purpose of the Report 

This report was prepared as a National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical Report, Preliminary 
Economic Assessment (Technical Report or PEA) by SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK), with 
Votorantim Metais Holding S.A. (Votorantim) with Solitario Zinc Corp. (Solitario), (collectively, owners) 
on the Florida Canyon Zinc Project located in Amazonas Department, Peru (Florida Canyon or 
Project). The Project name was changed in 2017 from Bongará, as it was called previously, to Florida 
Canyon. Some of the figures in this report still reference Bongará. The reader is advised to use 
Bongará interchangeably with Florida Canyon when reviewing those figures. 

This study represents the advancement of the Project from a 2014 Technical Report on Resources, to 
this 2017 PEA. Highlights of this PEA include a thirteen-year life-of-mine underground mine plan, 
comminution and flotation of zinc and lead concentrates with at a production rate of 2,500 t/d followed 
by dry-stack tailings storage. Site infrastructure includes line power to the site, water distribution 
systems, a townsite and access roads for construction and re-supply as well as for zinc concentrate 
transport to a point of sale at the Cajamarquilla smelter.  

The quality of information, conclusions, and estimates contained herein is consistent with the level of 
effort involved in SRK's services, based on: i) information available at the time of preparation, ii) data 
supplied by outside sources, and iii) the assumptions, conditions, and qualifications set forth in this 
report. This report is intended for use by the owners subject to the terms and conditions of its contract 
with SRK and relevant securities legislation. The contract permits the owners to file this report as a 
Technical Report with Canadian securities regulatory authorities pursuant to NI 43-101, Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Except for the purposes legislated under provincial securities law, any 
other uses of this report by any third party is at that party's sole risk. The responsibility for this 
disclosure remains with the issuing companies. The user of this document should ensure that this is 
the most recent Technical Report for the property as it is not valid if a new Technical Report has been 
issued.  

The PEA is preliminary in nature, that it includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them 
to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. Mineral 
Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. 

This report provides Mineral Resources, and a classification of resources prepared in accordance with 
the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards on Mineral Resources and 
Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines, May 10, 2014 (CIM, 2014).

3 Reliance on Other Experts 
The Consultants used their experience to determine if the information from previous reports was 
suitable for inclusion in this technical report and adjusted information that required amending. This 
report includes technical information, which required subsequent calculations to derive subtotals, totals 
and weighted averages. Such calculations inherently involve a degree of rounding and consequently 
introduce a margin of error. Where these occur, the Consultants do not consider them to be material. 

Items such as mineral titles and agreements have not been independently reviewed by SRK and SRK 
did not seek an independent legal opinion of these items.

4 Property Description and Location 
4.1 Property Location 

The Florida Canyon Zinc Project (the Project, formerly called Bongará) is located in the Eastern 
Cordillera of Peru at the sub-Andean front in the upper Amazon River Basin. It is within the boundary 
of the Shipasbamba community, 680 km north-northeast of Lima and and 245 km northeast of 
Chiclayo, Peru, in the District of Shipasbamba, Bongará Province, Amazonas Department (Figure 4-1). 
The Project area can be reached from the coastal city of Chiclayo by the paved Carretera Marginal 
road. The central point coordinates of the Project are approximately 825,248 East and, 9,352,626 
North (UTM Zone 17S, Datum WGS 84). Elevation ranges from 1,800 masl to approximately 3,200 
masl. The climate is classified as high altitude tropical jungle in the upper regions of the Amazon basin. 
The annual rainfall average exceeds 1 m with up to 2 m in the cloud forest at higher elevations.

4.2 Mineral Titles 
Florida Canyonis a mineral exploration project comprised of sixteen contiguous mining concessions 
covering approximately 12,600 ha (Table 4-1). The concession titles are in the name of Minera 
Bongará and are subject to the Minera Bongará joint venture agreement between Solitario and 
Votorantim. All of these concessions are currently titled. 

The Minera Bongará concessions are completely enveloped by a second group of thirty-seven 
contiguous mining concessions, covering approximately 30,700 ha (Table 4-2). The concession titles 
are in the name of Minera Chambara. Of the thirty-seven concessions, twelve titles are pending. Claim 
areas are shown in Figure 4-2. 

According to Peruvian law, concessions may be held indefinitely, subject only to payment of annual 
fees to the government. At the time of this study, concession payments were current for Minera 
Bongará claims, with 2017 fees of US$122,600 (Table 4-1). The fees for Minera Chambara total 
US$140,530 and these fees do not include the additional nine Charlita claims filed in January, 2017, 
which are still pending (Table 4-2). Minera Chambara, a Peruvian company also subject of a separate 
joint venture agreement between Votorantim and Solitario, holds mineral concessions surrounding the 
Minera Bongará claims but which do not contain any of the resources subject of this economic analysis. 

Votorantim, who has served as operator of the joint venture company Minera Bongará, entered into a 
surface rights agreement with the local community of Shipasbamba which controls the surface rights 
of the Project. This agreement provides for annual payments and funding for mutually agreed upon 
social development programs in return for the right to perform exploration work including road building 
and drilling.

 Nature and Extent of Issuer's Interest 
Bongará 
The Project is controlled by Minera Bongará S.A., and is subject to a joint venture agreement between 
Votorantim and Solitario since 2006. Votorantim is the operator of the Project and is responsible for 
keeping the property in good standing. Current ownership is 39% Solitario, 61% Votorantim. 
Votorantim will earn a 70% interest in Minera Bongará by continuing to fund all project expenditures 
through a feasibility study with no payback by Solitario. Votorantim is required to offer a loan facility at 
market rates for repayment of Solitario's portion of construction capital. Solitario repays the loan 
through 50% of its project cash flow. 

On August 15, 2006, an Agreement Letter was signed between Solitario, Minera Bongará and 
Votorantim Metais. The Letter defined the commitment of Votorantim to fund US$1.0 million in an 
annual mineral exploration program, which began in late October 2006.  

On March 24, 2007, a definitive agreement superseding the Letter Agreement was signed between 
the Companies. This definitive agreement (Agreement) provides that the project interest owned by 
Votorantim and Solitario will be held through the ownership of shares in the joint operating company 
Minera Bongará , which controls 100% of the mineral rights and assets of the project. 

Chambara 
Current Chambara Ownership is 85%/15% Solitario/Votorantim. Votorantim may increase their interest 
to 49% of Minera Chambara by completing cumulative expenditures of US$6.25 million. Votorantim 
may further increase their interest to 70% by funding a feasibility study and providing a loan for 
Solitario's 30% of construction capital. Solitario will repay the loan through 80% of its cash flow from 
production. 

 Property and Title in Peru 
Mining in Peru is governed by the General Mining Law, which specifies that all mineral assets belong 
to the federal government. Mining concessions granted to individuals or other entities authorize the 
title holder to perform all minerals related activates from exploration to exploitation and, once titled, 
are irrevocable for so long as the fees are paid to the federal government on time. A provisional claim 
is applied for and title is granted if no other claim exists over the same area. A claim can only be 
granted in multiples of a quadricula, which is a 100 ha plot, up to a maximum size of 1,000 ha. No 
monumentation of the claim boundary in the field is necessary. 

Annually a payment of US$3.00/ha (US$1.00 for a "small miner") must be made by the 30th of June or 
the first business day thereafter to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) or the claim is automatically 
forfeited. Any claim not in commercial production exceeding a pro-rated average of US$100/ha for any 
year after the sixth anniversary incurs a penalty payment of US$6.00 added to the annual payment. If, 
by the 12th anniversary, commercial production has not been achieved then the penalty increases to 
US$20.00. The penalties are waived if the title holder shows that investments for each claim exceed 
ten times the value of the penalty for any given year. 

Concessions are real assets and are subject to laws of private property. Foreign entities have the 
same rights as Peruvians to hold claims except for a zone within 50 km of international borders. Title 
holders have a right of access and development of minerals but an agreement is required with private 
property surface rights owners and formalized "Communities". To ratify an agreement with a

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

Community a majority of all members must vote in favor of the agreement as written. A recently issued 
law (as modified) also requires formal consultation with indigenous tribes in certain areas.  

4.3 Royalties, Agreements and Encumbrances 
Peru imposes a sliding scale net smelter return royalty (NSR) on all precious and base metal 
production of 1% on all gross proceeds from production up to US$60,000,000, a 2% NSR on proceeds 
between US$60,000,000 and US$120,000,000 and a 3% NSR on proceeds in excess of 
US$120,000,000. No other royalty encumbrances exist for the Project. 

Corporate income tax in Peru is charged at a flat rate of 30%. However, mining companies must also 
pay an additional tax varying from 2 to 8.4% of net operating profit.  

4.4 Environmental Liabilities and Permitting 

 Required Exploration Permits and Status 
Environmental permits for mineral exploration programs are divided into two classes. Class I permits 
allow construction and drilling for up to 20 platforms with a maximum disturbance of 10 ha. A Class II 
permit provides for more than 20 drill locations or for a disturbance area of greater than 10 ha.  

Class I permits require little more than a notification process for approval. Class II drilling permits 
require an environmental impact declaration (DIA), a permit for harvesting trees (if applicable), an 
archeological survey report (CIRA), a water use permit (ALA) and a Closure Plan.  

Votorantim has previously filed applications for and received Class II permits for various phases of the 
Project and has filed and received the required associated permits. The 2017 review of existing 
exploration permit status indicates that only the archeological permits and the latest tree harvesting 
permit are still valid. 

During exploration, Votorantim has developed a Social Management Plan with several programs 
ongoing in the community including: 

• Communication, Information and Coordination Program with Residents 
• Attention to Concern, Claims and Conflict Resolution Program 
• Support Program for Participatory Environmental Monitoring and Information Workshops 
• Recruitment and Training Program for Local Labor 
• Support Program for Sustainable Socioeconomic Development 
• Community Support Program in Education and Training. 

 Required Mining Permits  
Permitting requirements for mining include an Estudio de Impacto Ambiental (EIA) that describes in 
detail the mining plan and evaluates the impacts of the plan on environmental and social attributes of 
the property. Baseline studies include air quality, surface and groundwater quality, flora and fauna 
surveys, archeological surveys and a study of the social conditions of the immediate property and an 
area of interest that includes local communities. Many of the baseline studies required for mining have 
been completed by Votorantim. Public meetings are required in order that local community members 
can learn about and comment on the proposed operation. Social outreach has been clearly 
demonstrated during Votorantim's exploration efforts as described above.

• Closure bonding; and 
• Environmental Management Plan approval. 

Information on environmental monitoring was limited in the SRK document review. Nevertheless, the 
need for additional monitoring in at least one dry and one wet period will be required for the EIA 
including terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora and groundwater level and quality. 

4.5 Other Significant Factors and Risks 
There are no known significant factors or risks affecting access, title or right or ability to perform work 
on the property that are not discussed herein.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

5.1 Topography, Elevation and Vegetation 
The Project area elevation ranges between 1,800 and 3,200 masl, with areas of steep topography 
consisting of prominent escarpments and deep valleys. Dense jungle or forest vegetation covers the 
Project area, as shown in Figure 5-1.

5.2 Accessibility and Transportation to the Property 
Road access to the Bongará region is provided primarily by the Carretera Marginal paved highway 
connecting the port city of Chiclayo to Pedro Ruiz Gallo (inland). Travel time to Pedro Ruiz takes on 
average 6 hours by car. Pedro Ruiz is a regional commerce center with hotels, restaurants, 
communication and a population estimated to be 10,000. The immediate Project area is not populated 
but there are several small villages nearby.

5.3 Climate and Length of Operating Season 
The climate at the Project is high altitude tropical jungle. The annual temperature at elevations between 
1,000 masl and 2,000 masl averages around 25°C. Most precipitation occurs during the rainy season, 
between November and April. The annual rainfall average exceeds 1 m with up to 2 m in the cloud 
forest at higher elevations. Although exploration can continue year-round, surface exploration is more 
difficult during the rainy season when visibility hampers helicopter supported programs and muddy 
conditions hinder ground travel. 

5.4 Sufficiency of Surface Rights 
The Project concession package provides legal basis for entry, exploration and mining. However, 
agreements are required with local surface rights owners prior to surface disturbing activities. Through 
the exploration period conducted to date, Votorantim has signed bi-annual agreements for the use of 
Surface Lands. These agreements establish the commitments and counter-commitments to which 
both parties are bound (Company and community or private owner).  

5.5 Infrastructure Availability and Sources 
The Project area has little existing infrastructure with only an access road under construction and a 
number of primitive camps and drill pads (Figure 5-2 and Figure 5-3). Drilling has been accomplished 
using helicopter support from the village of Shipasbamba which lies 10 km to the southeast. The 
Project core shed and sample storage facility is located in Shipasbamba.  

Proposed infrastructure presented as part of this PEA includes the following: 

• Portal facilities (3) for underground mine access; 
• Mobile crushing plant at portals; 
• Water storage and supply piping; 
• Process plant; 
• Conveyor systems for ore and tailings; 
• Dry stack TSF; 
• Surface access roads; 
• Powerlines from offsite power supply; and 
• Mine camp, accommodations, water treatment facility.

 Proximity to Population Center 
The Project has an office in Pedro Ruiz and a core shed and heliport located in the town of 
Shipasbamba nearer the deposit. No services are available in Shipasbamba. Drill sites, field camps 
and underground workings are located 10 km northwest of Shipasbamba. The small community of 
Florida is 1 to 2 km south of the drill camps on the foot trail from Tingo to the Project. Florida is a one 
to two hour walk from the largest field camp at El Roso. Road construction is planned to connect the 
drill camps and Florida.  

Pedro Ruiz is the nearest town with commercial service including retail, hotels, restaurants and 
maintenance services. The nearest largest city with regular air service is Chiclayo, a coastal port city 
or Jaen, a small city approximately three hours by road. A paved air strip is available for private aircraft 
at Bagua Grande two hours from Pedro Ruiz on the Carretera Marginal road. 

The small population near the Project is supported by subsistence farming. Saleable crops include 
coffee, rocoto pepper, yucca, fruit and vegetables. Cedar trees are also harvested and used in local 
construction.  

 Power 
There is currently no substantive line power near the site. SRK considered a diesel-powered generator 
option for power supply. However, a third-party supplier, Energoret S.A.C, has a hydropower 
generation and transmission development project that will be located in close proximity to the mine. 
The Energoret system will generate 20 MW of power from a plant on a tributary to the Utcubamba 
River. Energoret indicates that half of the project, approximately 10 MW, has already been committed. 
The plant is designed to provide power to the city of Bagua Grande, west of their project, and to Pedro 
Ruiz to the east of Florida Canyon. Energoret indicates that it will invest in a transmission line to the 
Florida Canyon mine site and a substation on site. 

 Water 
The operation will require water for use for processing, mining, dust suppression and potable 
consumption. The processing facility will utilize recycled water from the tailings facility and rainfall shed 
from the tailings for the majority of the processing needs. It is anticipated that there will be some ground 
water that will be encountered in the mine and captured in sumps and decantation basins for mine 
water needs. 

Tesoro Creek, a small local drainage, has been used for domestic water supply by nearby residents. 
Clean water from this creek may be used for make-up process water, for fire suppression and for 
domestic requirements. It will be piped by gravity from the creek to a water storage tank. A small 
treatment plant will be utilized for potable water needs for town site and other support areas.  

 Mining Personnel 
No trained mining personnel reside near the Project. Untrained labor is readily available from local 
communities where few employment opportunities exist. Peru is a mature mining country with a mobile 
workforce. Abundant trained labor is present in all categories of mining throughout Peru.

 Potential Mine Infrastructure Areas 
Potential sites for mine infrastructure, including a processing plant, tailings impoundment and waste 
rock storage are located east of the San Jorge deposit. A schematic diagram of planned infrastructure 
is shown in Figure 5-4. A detailed discussion of planned infrastructure for the Project is found in Section 
18 of this report.

6 History 
6.1 Prior Ownership and Ownership Changes 

Prior to the discovery of mineral occurrences by Solitario in 1994, no mineral prospecting had been 
done on the Property and no concessions had been historically recorded. In 1995 and later, Solitario 
staked the current mineral concessions in the Project area.  

In 1996, Cominco Ltd. formed a joint venture partnership (JV) with Solitario. This agreement was 
terminated in 2000 and Solitario retained ownership of the property.  

In 2006, and Solitario formed a JV with Votorantim, for the exploration and possible development of 
the property.  

6.2 Previous Exploration and Development Results 
In 1993 through 1995, Solitario executed a program of pitting and drilling at the previously known Mina 
Grande and Mina Chica oxide zinc prospects located 18 km northeast of the Project area. Solitario 
subsequently identified the Crystal prospect nearby and other zinc occurrences in the general area. 
The Florida Canyon zinc deposit was located through follow-up of an anomaly generated during a 
regional program of stream sediments in 1994. 

In 1997 to 1999, Cominco Ltd. completed various types of field work including geologic mapping, 
geophysical surveys, surface sampling, and diamond drilling. The scope of these programs is 
summarized below. 

• Geologic mapping at 1:1,000 scale covering 352 ha in the Project area. Mapping was 
conducted within Florida Canyon and its tributaries aided by cut trails. Mapping has been 
validated by Votorantim. 

• Known mineralized outcrops in the Project area were cleared and sampled and a total of 347 
rock chip channel samples were collected. This sampling consisted of channels with individual 
samples of thicknesses up to 2.0 m at non-regular spacing. 

• Sediment sampling of major drainages and streams was completed with consistent 500 m 
spacing along the drainages. 

• Soil samples were collected along topographic contour lines spaced vertically 50 m apart but 
with irregular lateral spacing. Part of this soil sampling followed the crests of hills, especially 
in the western part of Florida Canyon, mainly to identify mineralized linear structures. A total 
of 600 samples were collected. 

• Diamond drilling between 1997 and 2000 totaled 82 holes and 24,781 m. 
• An Induced Polarization (IP) geophysical survey in 3 lines covered 5.2 linear km. Two lines 

were located along the drainages A and B of the northern part of Florida Canyon with dipole-
dipole spacing at 150 m, and a third line with dipole-dipole spacing a = 100 m along the 
southern sector of the Sam Fault target. Cominco also surveyed 6.5 km of radial lines from 
holes FC-41 and FC-47, drilled in 1999.  

6.3 Historical Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimates 
The current Mineral Resource Statement for the Florida Canyon zinc-lead-silver deposit was prepared 
in June of 2014 pursuant to the requirements of NI 43-101. The statement is presented in Table 6-1.

• Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that 

all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into Mineral Reserves; 
• Mineral resources are reported to an NSR zinc-equivalent (ZnEq%) cut-off grade based on metal price assumptions*, 

metallurgical recovery assumptions**, mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, and NSR 
factors***. Mining costs, processing, G&A, and transportation costs total US$51.30/t. 

• *Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Zinc (US$/lb 0.95), Lead (US$/lb 
0.95) and Silver (US$/oz 20.00), 

• **Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution. 
Average metallurgical recoveries for sulfide and oxide respectively are: Zinc (93.1%, 73%), Lead (84.8, 0%) and Silver 
(55.6%, 0%) 

• *** NSR factors for calculating cut-off grades were: ZnEq% = Zn% * 1 + Pb% * 0.74 + Ag g/t * 0.02 
• Resulting cut-off grades used in this resource statement were 4.1% ZnEq for sulfide, 5.0% ZnEq for oxide, and 

4.5% ZnEq for mixed material types. 
• Zinc equivalency for reporting in situ resources was calculated using:  
• ZnEq (%) = Zn (%) + 1.0 * PB (%) + 0.03 * Ag (g/t) 
• Density was calculated based on material types and metal grades. The average density in the mineralized zone was 2.91 

g/cm3 as a function of the zinc and lead sulfide mineral content. 
• Mineral Resources as reported are undiluted. 
• Mineral resource tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the precision of the estimate, and numbers 

may not add due to rounding. 
o There are no Mineral Reserves previously developed for the deposit. 

 

6.4 Historical Production 
There has not been any commercial mining in the Project area. The only underground excavation has 
been 700 m of underground drifting by Votorantim to provide drill platforms at the San Jorge area.  

A subsidiary of Hochschild Mining PLC tested open pit mining for a short time at the Mina Grande 
deposit off of the claims held by Votorantim and Solitario near the village of Yambrasbamba, 18 km 
northeast of Florida Canyon, where Solitario had previously defined an oxidized zinc resource by 
pitting.

7 Geological Setting and Mineralization 
Information presented herein is derived from material provided by Votorantim and Solitario, including 
Cominco reports, and was verified and augmented by SRK during a site visit in May 2014.  

7.1 Regional Geology 
The Project is located within an extensive belt of Mesozoic carbonate rocks belonging to the Upper 
Triassic to Lower Jurassic Pucará Group and equivalents. This belt extends through the central and 
eastern extent of the Peruvian Andes for nearly 1000 km and is the host for many polymetallic and 
base metal vein and replacement deposits in the Peruvian Mineral Belt. Among these is the San 
Vicente Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) zinc-lead deposit that has many similarities to the Florida 
Canyon deposit and other MVT occurrences in the Project area. A regional geologic map is shown in 
Figure 7-1.

7.2 Local Geology 

 Lithology and Stratigraphy 
A schematic stratigraphic column developed by Cominco and refined by Votorantim shows the major 
geologic rock units in the Project area (Figure 7-2). The basement rocks are the Pre-Cambrian 
Marañón Complex consisting of gneisses, mica-schists, phyllites and quartzites. These are overlain 
by an angular unconformity with the overlying Permo -Triassic Mitu Group composed of a sequence 
of redbeds consisting of polymictic conglomerates interspersed with beds of fine-grained sandstones.

Figure 7-2: Project Area Stratigraphic Column 

 

Overlying the Mitu Group is the Pucará Group of Triassic - lower Jurassic age, which hosts the zinc-
lead-silver mineralization of the Florida Canyon Project. The Pucará Group is divided into the 
Chambara Formation at the base, the Aramachay Formation in the middle and the Condorsinga 
Formation on top. 

The Chambara formation has an approximate thickness between 650 m and 750 m in the project area, 
and consists of crinoidal packstone, wackstones and rudstones. It is divided into three members in the 
Florida Canyon vicinity; from bottom to top, they are Chambara 1, Chambara 2 and Chambara 3. The

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

bulk of known zinc mineralization is hosted in Chambara 2. The stratigraphy between the distinctive 
Coquina (CM) and Intact Bivalve (IBM) paleontological marker horizons in Chambara 2 define a 
sequence of permeable higher energy facies within the Chambara 2 that control much of the especially 
strong dolomitization within the sequence.  

The Aramachay formation lies concordantly on the Chambara with a variable thickness between 150 m 
and 250 m, consisting of a monotonous sequence of black and limonitic lutites and bitumen with thin 
interbedded nodular limestones. The Condorsinga Formation concordantly lies above, with restricted 
outcrop distribution due to erosion. It consists of calcareous gray mudstones with thicknesses varying 
between 150 m and 300 m. 

The Corontochaca Formation of Upper Jurassic age lies unconformably on the Pucará Group. It 
outcrops in erosional remnants and is locally more than 300 m thick consisting of a package of 
monotonous oligomictic and polymictic fluvial calcareous sediments and colluvial limestone breccias 
with local fragments of Paleozoic or Precambrian fragments. 

The Goyllarisquizga Formation occurs in angular unconformity over the Corontochaca and Pucará 
Group and is present mainly in the eastern and western sections of the Project area. It consists of 
poorly sorted yellowish to white sandstone deposited in coastal marine to fluvial-deltaic environments. 
It also contains some thin, lenticular intercalations of siltstones and mudstones whitish to reddish. The 
thickness ranges from 300 to 400 m.  

 Structure 
The following discussion of structural geology in the Project area is adapted in part from an internal 
report by Cominco (2000).  

The structure at Florida Canyon is dominated by a N50º-60ºW trending domal anticline (or doubly-
plunging anticline) as defined from the base of Chambará 2 structural contour map in Figure 7-2. This 
domal anticline is cut on the west by the Sam Fault and to the east by the Tesoro-Florida Fault. The 
Sam Fault, which has been defined by drilling, has a north-south to northeast trend and a steep 80 to 
85º westerly dip. The Sam Fault has an apparent scissor dip-slip displacement of >120 m in the north 
and <50 m in the south. To the south its trace is uncertain and complicated by northwest and possibly 
east-west structures. This appears to have been a long-lived structure, with its last strike-slip 
displacement being dextral. A facies change in the Chambará 2 from high energy to the east of the 
fault to low energy to the west many be due to original depositional features during growth fault 
formation that has important exploration implications.  

At Florida Canyon there are also well defined northwest and northeast fracture systems, which appear 
to have important controls on the location of mineralization. Mineralized structures occur in conjugate 
fractures, with N10º-50ºE trends present at a number of mineralized surface outcrops while trends of 
N50º-80ºW are identified at other showings. Mineralization of mantos within the Karen-Milagros area 
appears to be preferentially controlled by northeast feeder structures. 

The Tesoro-Florida Fault defining the eastern limits of most drilling to date is a N15º-30ºW trending 
structure, part of a regional lineament, and defined by an escarpment. It is interpreted to have a steep 
dip, with its sense of motion not having been defined, but with the east block being structurally lower 
than the west block, which results in significantly deeper drilling on the east fault block to reach the 
Chambará 2 stratigraphy. Because most of the work has concentrated further west on the San Jorge, 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment – Florida Canyon Zinc Project  Page 54 
 
 

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

Karen Milagros and Sam Fault areas there is little information on the Tesoro-Florida Fault, but it likely 
has similarly complex splays as the Sam Fault and may be, like the Sam fault, a controlling feeder for 
untested mineral potential in the eastern area. 

At both the Karen-Milagros and San Jorge areas, feeder structures have an important control on the 
mineralized mantos but also represent a significant portion of the resource as steeply dipping structural 
fillings and replacement. The displacement along these structures is not large although the exact throw 
is often difficult to ascertain due to the strong alteration and later mineralization. The interpretation of 
displacement is further obscured by likely subtle variation in thickness and lithology of local 
stratigraphic units on either side of structures due to growth faulting. 

Pre-mineral karsting also played a role in controlling mineralization along with simple structural filling 
and passive replacement adjacent to conduits. Replacement of karst fragments and cave sediments 
are commonly observed in larger structurally controlled mineralized bodies. The configuration of 
mineralized structures as they control and merge with manto replacements often take the form of 
Christmas–tree breakthrough structures and will likely be shown to represent a larger proportion of the 
resource as more horizontally oriented drilling from underground workings supplants the dominantly 
high angle surface drilling performed to date.  

Post mineral structure and karsting overprints earlier structural trends and controls in part oxidized 
remobilized mineralization. 

 Alteration  
The alteration and solution overprints in the Florida Canyon deposit include dolomitization, 
pseudobrecciation and karstification, mainly affecting the limestones of Chambara 2 and locally 
Chambara 1 and 3. Dolomitization and karstification occurred in multiple events spatially overlapping 
the structural corridors Sam, San Jorge and Karen-Milagros. Dolomitization was an important control 
on the movement of mineralizing fluids and has been studied and logged in detail throughout all of the 
drilling campaigns. It is also modeled in this study as a limiting constraint on mineralization. 

The alteration halo is open in all directions and is especially pervasive in the stratigraphic interval lying 
between the paleontological marker horizons CM (Coquina Marker) and IBM (Intact Bivalve Marker) 
of the Chambara 2 formation. The alteration halo is composed mostly of medium and coarse-grained 
crystalline dolomite replacing calcareous packstone, rudstones, floatstones and wackestones. Mostly 
the dolomitic rudstones, and locally the packstones, transform laterally when in proximity of faults and 
major fractures (Sam, San Jorge and Karen-Milagros) to mineralized pseudobreccias and karst 
structures.  

 Mineralization 
The zinc-lead-silver mineralization of the Florida Canyon deposit occurs as sulfides hosted in 
dolomitized zones of the Chambara 2 Formation. Dolomite paragenesis and later sulfide mineralization 
are controlled by a combination of porosity, permeability and structural preparation. Metals occur in 
sphalerite and lesser galena, which contains silver. Minor mineralization is hosted in limestones, but 
the bulk of sphalerite and galena is hosted in dolomite.  

In a number of core samples, the mineralization has very sharp contacts along the dolomitization 
boundary. Characteristic mineralization textures include massive and disseminated mantos, 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment – Florida Canyon Zinc Project  Page 55 
 
 

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

mineralization in dissolution breccias, collapse breccias and pseudobreccias. The different breccias 
and vein types are structurally controlled by faults of north-south and northeast-southwest direction.  

The mineralization is characterized by the presence of sphalerite, galena and locally pyrite. Sulfide 
replacements occur in dolomitized limestone of variable grain sized and in solution breccias with white 
dolospar and lesser amounts of late generation calcite. Pyrite content is generally low, with 
percentages averaging less than 2% by volume. Sphalerite in mineralized sections has variable grain 
size from 0.1 to greater than 5 mm, with colors ranging from dark brown through reddish brown to light 
brown. It occurs as individual crystals or in massive form, sometimes displaying colloform textures with 
bands of slightly differing color zoning, indicators of polyphase hydrothermal deposition. 

Early fine-grained sphalerite has evidence of later deformation and reactions to secondary mineralizing 
fluids. A second phase of more massive sphalerite mineralization is observed within the core of the 
deposit. These crystals are coarse-grained, regular, euhedral and show very little evidence of any 
post-depositional deformation. The sphalerite is contemporaneous with fine to coarse grained galena 
and is often overprinted with a later stage coarse-grained, euhedral galena.  

The presence of zinc oxides, locally to considerable depths, is due to syngenetic oxidation, with later 
contributions of basin-derived connate water and movement of rainwater through fractures that 
leached the limestones and formed significant karst cavities.  

7.3 Property Geology 
The areas of current exploration interest are the Karen/Milagros, San Jorge and Sam Fault deposits. 
These mineralized zones are hosted in the dolomitized Chambará 2 sub-unit of the Pucará Group 
carbonates, bracketed by the Coquina and Intact Bivalve Marker beds. Geologic mapping and 
modeling includes refining the extents of Chambará 2, and further defining the steeply dipping feeder 
structures to predict additional zinc-lead-silver mineralization. The outcrop geology of the deposit area 
is shown in Figure 7-3, with emphasis on the Chambará Formation.

7.4 Significant Mineralized Zones 
Local and regional geologic mapping, geologic drillhole logs, and the dome-shaped geometry of the 
deposit suggest the mineralization is hosted in a broad anticline structure. Florida Canyon is the 
collective name of the deposits in the Project area in Florida Canyon, and includes the Karen-Milagros, 
San Jorge, Sam Fault zones and similar mineralized strata between these areas. 

Modeled manto zones are between 1 m and 9 m thick and occur over an area of about 1 km x 3 km 
and are open in all directions. Unmineralized gaps exist within the mineralized manto zones, as is 
typical for hydrothermal replacement deposits. Irregular steeply dipping replacement bodies also 
occur, frequently at the intersection of vein-like feeder structures and in karst-controlled mineralization. 

Mineralization outcrops locally in a number of areas, and have been drilled at depths of up to about 
450 m below ground surface. Figure 7-4 is a west-facing cross section of the geologic model in the 
mineralized zone. Zinc mineralization occurs as massive sphalerite (ZnS), and is locally oxidized to 
smithsonite (ZnCO3) and hemimorphite (Zn4Si2O7 (OH)2). Lead occurs in galena (PbS), cerussite 
(PbCO3) and anglesite (PbSO4).

8 Deposit Type  
MVT deposits are hosted in carbonate rocks, and show cavity-filling or replacement-style 
mineralization. The characteristic minerals are sphalerite, galena, fluorite, and barite. The host rock 
may be silicified, and common alteration minerals include dolomite, calcite, jasperoid and silica. MVT 
deposits are typically spatially extensive, but limited by the permeability of the host rock units. This 
control makes them appear stratabound. Chemical and structural preparation are the main controls on 
permeability, and therefore, the extent of fluid migration and metal precipitation (Guilbert and Park, 
1986). 

8.1 Mineral Deposit 
An area of 20 km x 100 km extending from Mina Grande to north to 80 km south of the Florida Canyon 
deposit has become the focus of what is an emerging Mississippi-Valley Type (MVT) zinc and lead 
province, with many surface occurrences and stream sediment anomalies distributed throughout the 
Pucará Group. The main host rock of zinc and lead occurrences in the mineral district and Project area 
is dolomitized limestone, which may show karst or collapse breccia textures.  

8.2 Geological Model 
The current genetic model for Florida Canyon consists of mineralization being classified as syn-to post 
tectonic. Specifically, upwelling mineralizing fluids entered the Chambara Formation and precipitated 
in porous and reactive dolomites with interaction of sulfide and organic ions (H2S and CH4) resulting 
from reaction with overlying evaporitic and bituminous sequences, all channeled by axial planar faults. 
The schematic mineralization model is presented in Figure 8-1.

9 Exploration 
9.1 Relevant Exploration Work 

The Florida Canyon Project has identified and delineated mineral resources in the San Jorge, Sam 
and Karen-Milagros areas. The results and methodology are described below. 

In earlier years Cominco and then Votorantim executed detailed surface mapping programs, 
mineralized outcrop clearing and mapping and sampling of the areas near the reported resource. 
Stream sediment and soil samples were collected and analyzed as described in Section 6.2. An 
extensive regional reconnaissance exploration program was also conducted over a large area 
throughout the Mesozoic carbonate belt to the north and south of the Property. Geochemical samples 
were collected of stream sediments, soils and rocks. 

During development of the San Jorge adit, Votorantim completed geologic mapping and chip sampling 
of the underground workings. Results were applied to the Project geologic model in support of resource 
estimation and continued exploration drillhole planning.  

Future exploration work will focus on infill drilling between the Karen-Milagros, San Jorge and Sam 
areas. Mineralization is open to the north and south and remains largely untested to the east of the 
Tesoro Fault and west of the Sam Fault where greater target depths have lowered the near-term 
drilling priority. As discussed in Section 9.4 prospective targets for grass roots exploration exist further 
north on the Project Property 

9.2 Surveys and Investigations 
Solitario, Votorantim and Cominco have not completed any additional surveys or other investigations 
outside of drilling, mapping and sampling surface and underground workings as described.  

9.3 Sampling Methods and Sample Quality 
Sampling of drill core is described in detail in Section 11. The regional stream sediment program 
collected sediments that were screened to -80 mesh, ashed and analyzed for a multielment suite by 
ICP. Soil samples collected were composites of B horizon soils and C horizon when accessible.  

Rock sample methodology varied according to location. Grab samples were taken where outcrops 
were found that showed evidence of dolomitization of carbonate beds. Mineralized outcrops were 
cleared manually with machetes and shovels and systematically chip channeled. Channels were 
oriented perpendicular to bedding to most accurately represent stratigraphic thickness. Channel 
samples were limited to 2 m in length by Cominco and 1 m by Votorantim. Most of the chip channel 
sampling of higher grade mineralization has been conducted in the Karen Milagros zone and other 
areas in the central part of the Property where outcrops of mineralization are most common, as 
illustrated in Figure 9-1.  

9.4 Significant Results and Interpretation 
Exploration strategy for MVT deposits at the Florida Canyon project has been strongly influenced by 
the interpreted favorability of specific units of the stratigraphy of the region. Numerous occurrences 
of alteration and mineralization occur throughout the Pucara Group but economic deposits have only 
been thus far located within the Triassic Chambara formation (Stratigraphic Section, Figure 7.1).

More specifically the middle member of the Chambara Formation (Chambara 2) has been found to 
host the most persistent and highest grade manto deposits due to its higher permeability and 
susceptibility to altering and mineralizing fluids. Synsedimentary structures, formed during or slightly 
after sedimentation, controlled the flow of basinal brines that dolomitized and subsequently 
mineralized the carbonates. The mineral rich fluids migrated from these "feeders" laterally into the 
stratigraphic column to form mantos. 

Economic resources have been delineated in both the stratigraphically controlled mantos as well as 
the feeders, such as the San Jorge and Sam mineralized bodies. The higher angle structures have 
also been subject to karst formation that further enhanced fluid flow and are themselves often well 
mineralized with higher grade wider mineralization e.g. San Jorge.  

Particularly prospective locations to explore for these high grade, high tonnage deposits exist along 
the northeast trending lineaments (drainages) immediately north and south of Karen Milagros where 
outcropping massive mineralization may be expressions of breakthrough structures. These locations 
have not been adequately tested to date due to the difficult access for helicopter supported drilling. 
The completion of road access will facilitate testing of these targets.

These steeply dipping bodies occur over stratigraphic intervals that extend upwards into the Chambara 
3, Aramachay and Condorsinga formations. The depth extent of mineralization in the feeders is 
currently unknown. These conduits enabled metal rich fluids to enrich the overlying stratigraphy and 
provide potentially important evidence for exploration.  

Geochemical prospecting is very effective in locating the leakage halos in overlying stratigraphy 
around these structures. Initially stream sediments were used to identify geochemically enriched 
drainages and were followed up with prospecting and soil surveys to pinpoint mineralized centers. 
Although no detailed mapping has been done over much of the property, geologists made observations 
of the stratigraphic location within areas of high geochemical response. 

Figure 9-2 shows the results of the regional geochemistry program. The area in the immediate vicinity 
of the Florida Canyon resource exhibits very high base metal content in stream sediment, soils and 
rocks. Only a small area of Chambara 2 crops out in this area as shown in orange color on the geologic 
map of the Florida/Tesoro vicinity (Figure 9-3). Outcropping high grade mineralization in this window 
of Chambara led to the initial discovery of the known Florida Canyon deposits. 

Nearby, there are significant soil anomalies in higher stratigraphy that warrant future exploration 
drilling. These anomalies occur in undrilled areas within the horst that hosts the current resources as 
well as to the west of the Sam Fault and East of the Tesoro Fault. 

Further to the north two very large and strong soil anomalies have been defined by the regional 
geochemical sampling program (Figure 9-2). The San Jose soil anomaly is of similar size and grade 
to that at Florida Cayon. It is, as yet, untested with drilling. Based on the clear relationship between 
surface geochemistry and subsurface mineralization at Florida Canyon, drilling is warranted in the San 
Jose and Naranjitos areas.

10 Drilling 
The database used for modeling and estimation of mineral resources has not been augmented since 
August 15, 2013 and includes 486 diamond drillholes, with a total of 117,280.25 m drilled length. There 
has been no new drilling on the project since the 2014 Technical Report (SRK, 2014b).  

10.1 Type and Extent 
All drillholes completed in the Project area are HQ-diameter core (63.5 mm). If poor ground conditions 
necessitated, the core diameter was reduced to NQ (47.6 mm). Cominco completed a total of 82 
drillholes from the current ground surface in the Karen-Milagros and Sam deposit areas, and the San 
Jorge structural corridor. Votorantim completed 404 drillholes between 2006 and 2013, from surface 
or from the San Jorge Adit. The Votorantim drilling is distributed throughout the Project area. All holes 
mentioned above are included in the geologic modeling and resource estimation database, and shown 
in Figure 10-1.  

The combined Cominco and Votorantim drilling for the project totals 117,260 m. Figure 10-2 shows 
drilled length by program, including 4,047 m of oriented core geotechnical drilling in 13 drillholes.

10.2 Procedures 
All drilling contracted by Votorantim was completed with triple-tube HQ tooling and followed industry 
standard procedures to ensure sample quality. Surface drilling was executed with a helicopter-
supported LD-250 diamond core rig operated by Bradley Bros. Limited. Sermin completed the 
underground development and also completed drilling from the San Jorge adit with a LM-70 electric 
diamond core rig.  

Drilling was performed on two 12-hour shifts with full 24-hour geological supervision by a Votorantim 
geologist. The rig geologist role included:  

• Coordination and communication between the drilling contractor and Votorantim; 
• Monitoring drilling procedures and inspecting the core extraction for sample quality;  
• Boxing the core;  
• Measuring and recording core recovery and Rock Quality Designation (RQD); and  
• Completing a preliminary geological log.  

Downhole surveys were completed with a Reflex EZ-Shot survey tool by the drillers at varying spacing, 
as summarized in Table 10-1. The survey records are stored digitally at the core facility and SRK 
reviewed them during the 2014 site visit. Drillhole collar locations were surveyed by Votorantim with a 
GPS-based instrument.

Votorantim completed 13 oriented geotechnical drillholes, totaling 4,046.70 m. In these holes, the 
recovery was excellent (90% to 100%) with RQD results greater than 75%.  

From the drill site, filled core boxes were transported in batches of 14 via helicopter to the drill core 
logging facility in Shipasbamba. These were photographed and fully logged by Votorantim geologists 
in natural light. During the 2012 to 2013 program, many of the core photographs were taken after the 
core had been cut for sampling, due to the large quantity of core produced.  

10.3 Interpretation and Relevant Results 
The geologic logging and analytical data were added to the Project database after validation and 
applied to modeling and resource estimation. Due to the large number of drillholes in the database, 
and because the modeling and resource estimation are discussed in detail, in Section 14 (Mineral 
Resources), the drilling results by interval are not presented here. The true thickness of the mineralized 
intercepts is about 80% of the drilled length, and varies with the orientation of the drillhole.  

Votorantim's documentation of drilling procedures and SRK's observation of the program indicate that 
there is little or negligible sampling bias introduced during drilling.

SRK considers the drilling procedures to be appropriate for the geology, conducted according to 
industry best practice and standards, and the relevant results are sufficient for use in resource 
estimation.

11 Sample Preparation, Analysis and Security 
11.1 Sampling Methods 

Sampling procedures for core drilled on behalf of Cominco are not well-documented. Cominco included 
assay quality control samples in the analytical programs, but the results were not available to review. 
The resource classification from these samples is limited because the location and analytical data was 
not obtained according to current industry standard protocol.  

Most of the information in this section pertains to the sampling completed by Votorantim. Available 
information about sampling completed by Cominco is included if available, and is specified as such. 
About 20% of the holes in the current drillhole database were drilled by Cominco.  

 Sampling for Geochemical Analysis 
After photographing the core and completing geotechnical and geologic logging, a geologist marked 
the core for sample intervals that averaged 100 cm long. Samples had a minimum length of 30 cm and 
a maximum of 150 cm, but were defined so that 100 cm samples were maintained as much as possible. 
Cut lines parallel to the core axis were drawn by the logging geologist, to ensure nearly symmetrical 
halves and minimal sampling bias relative to any visible mineralization. The core was cut on a rock 
saw with a 40 cm blade, under supervision of a Project geologist. After the core was cut, both halves 
were replaced in the core box.  

Samples were always taken from the left side of the saw-cut core, double bagged and marked with 
sample numbers in two places. These were transported in larger bags containing seven samples each 
by Mobiltours freight company to the ALS Minerals laboratory in Trujillo or Lima, operated by ALS 
Minerals. Prior to 2012, analysis was completed in Trujillo. Since then, it has been done in Lima. 

Cominco also split the core samples and sampled half for geochemical analysis. Sample breaks were 
determined by geologic criteria. Cominco core samples were analyzed by Acme Labs, in Lima, Peru.  

 Sampling for Density Measurement 
Specific gravity (SG) measurements were completed on site by Votorantim on every sample from the 
2013 drilling program. For previous drilling programs, SG measurements were completed on all 
mineralized intervals. Three SG measurement methods were used:  

• Volume displacement;  
• Hydrostatic; and 
• A mesh method for broken material. 

These techniques were designed and implemented by Inspectorate Services Peru SAC. Votorantim 
has also performed some density measurements on older Cominco core. 

11.2 Security Measures 
During the SRK site visit, the observed sample storage was secure, and provided adequate protection 
from rainfall. Sample security and chain of custody was maintained while the samples were transported 
from the core shed in Shipasbamba to Lima. Assay certificates are retained in the Votorantim office in

Lima. Analytical data is loaded directly from the laboratory results files to the drillhole database, to 
minimize the risk of accidental or intentional edits.  

11.3 Sample Preparation for Analysis 
ALS Minerals (ALS) in Trujillo or Lima, Peru, completed sample preparation and analysis for all 
Votorantim core samples. ALS is an independent, global analytical company recognized for quality, 
and is used by many exploration and mining companies for geochemical analysis. Current 
certifications and credentials include ISO 17025:2005 Accredited Methods & ISO 9001:2008 
Registration in Peru, Brazil, Chile and Argentina (ALS Minerals, 2014a).  

Upon delivery at the lab, bar coded sample identification labels were scanned and the samples were 
registered to the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). Samples were weighed, and 
then air-dried in ambient conditions. Excessively wet samples were dried in an oven at a maximum 
120°C. The sample preparation and analysis procedures used are summarized in Table 11-1. Specific 
analytical procedures and method detection limits for elements in the suite are reported in Table 11-2.  

After analysis is complete, the remaining coarse reject and pulp samples are returned to the Florida 
Canyon core shed for storage.  

Cominco analyzed samples with visible zinc or lead mineralization by atomic absorption 
spectrophotometry. All samples containing greater than 10,000 ppm zinc + lead were then analyzed 
by wet chemistry and the latter results were recorded in the data base.

11.4 QA/QC Procedures 
Votorantim's Technical Report (Votorantim, 2014b) includes assay quality assurance/ quality control 
(QA/QC) results available through June 15, 2013. Sample dates in the QA/QC data files are between 
2011 and 2013, and no information for prior samples was available. For the 2011 to 2013 drilling 
programs, assay QC samples were 10.9% of the total samples analyzed. Some programs included 
duplicate core or coarse reject samples, and/or duplicate analysis of fine pulp samples. Votorantim 
compiled and analyzed the results from 2011 to 2013 drilling programs, which SRK has reviewed and 
summarized below. Assay QC results from drilling programs prior to 2011 were not available to include 
in this report.

Low-grade standards STD_RK1, -2 and -3 are less than economic grade for both zinc and lead. 
However, the results provide important information on the quality of analytical data across a range of 
values. The lowest-grade standard, RK1, shows consistent low bias for both lead and zinc (about 4.5% 
lower than the mean), while RK2 has consistent, but minor, high bias for both elements (about 2.8% 
higher). Although lead values for RK3 have slightly low bias (-2.9%), zinc values average very close 
to the mean.  

All results for ST800044B were within three standard deviations of the certified value for lead and zinc; 
all results but two for lead and four for zinc were within two standard deviations of the respective 
certified values. On average, results were greater than the certified value by 1.8% for zinc and 0.3% 
for lead, indicating unbiased analytical data.

 Blanks 
Two types of blank samples were included in the sample suite:  

• Fine-grained BLK_RK1 (n = 223); and  
• Coarse-grained BLK_RK1_GR (n = 229).  

The fine-grained blank material served as a control on analytical quality, and was not subjected to any 
stage of the sample preparation process. The coarse blank material was included to identify possibly 
cross-contamination during sample preparation. Between August 2011 and June 2013, 452 blank 
samples were analyzed with drill samples. All blank samples but one were less than 7 times the lower 
method detection limit for zinc, and all were less than 4 times the method detection limit for lead. One 
sample was greater than 10 times the method detection limit for zinc. The accepted tolerance range 
for blank samples is up to 10 times the lower method detection limit. Blank sample results from the 
2011 and 2012 drilling programs indicate that there was no cross-contamination during sample 
preparation.  

Statistical and graphic analysis of blank sample and previous sample pairs showed that some blank 
sample results were outside of acceptable limits, caused by "drag" in the ICP instrument. However, 
the percentage of samples outside of tolerance is less than 5%, and indicates acceptable analytical 
data quality.  

 Duplicates 
Several types of duplicate samples were included in the 2013 drilling program: 

• Quartered core samples, to assess the quality of the sampling procedure and identify sample 
mix-ups;  

• Coarse rejects (sample preparation); 
• Pulps (analysis); and 
• Pulps from previous drilling as blind duplicates (analysis). 

A summary of all duplicate sample pairs is shown in Table 11-5. In the 2011 to 2012 drilling programs, 
only quartered-core sample duplicates were included.

Votorantim collected a duplicate core sample approximately every 50th sample interval, on average. 
These intervals were halved, and then the halves were halved again. Two opposing quadrants of core 
were sampled separately as the original and duplicate sample. The remaining two quarters of core 
were retained in the core box.  

Starting in 2013, Votorantim included additional types of duplicate samples to assess the quality of 
each step of sample preparation and analysis. Coarse reject duplicates were collected by the 
laboratory, by taking a second 1,000 g split from the crushed sample, and pulverizing it separately to

create a second pulp sample. Pulp duplicates are re-analysis of the prepared original pulp. Votorantim 
specified the pulp duplicate sample intervals and the lab prepared them. Votorantim also included blind 
duplicate samples of prepared pulps of recent drilling programs, to test the repeatability of analytical 
results without the lab's knowledge.  

Votorantim analyzed zinc, lead and silver results for all duplicate pair types. The results from each 
type of duplicate sample showed repeatable results at all stages of sample preparation and analysis.  

 Actions 
Standard and blank sample results indicate accurate lab data free of analytical bias. Duplicate sample 
results show that sample quality is adequate and the reported results were free of sample mix-ups.  

Some improvements, fixes and deployments in the assay QC program were identified in 2013 and are 
already underway. Votorantim has recently changed assay QC protocols so that: 

• Each hole starts with a coarse blank and has a blank for every 50 drill samples; 
• A SRM is inserted for every 20 drill intervals;  
• A type of duplicate is included for every 20 drill samples, as ¼ core, coarse rejects, pulps, or 

blind pulps; and  
• Check analysis at a second independent laboratory was completed for 2010 to 2012 samples 

at SGS Labs and for 2013 samples at BVI (Inspectorate) labs.  

Additional planned quality control measures include: 

• Generate new standards from Florida Canyon core, and continue using the high grade 
standard ST800044B; and 

• Separate about 200 kg of unmineralized material from the Project to create a certified blank. 

One or two additional SRM with zinc, lead and silver grades in the range of economic interest should 
be included in future drilling programs. If possible, these should be matrix-matched to the Project. 
Coarse blank samples should be adopted in favor of prepared blank samples, to test all phases of 
sample preparation and analysis. 

11.5 Opinion on Adequacy 
The assay QC database is organized well and free of errors in the cells that SRK checked. Votorantim 
maintains the assay QC data well, and analyzes it in real time to address any issues promptly. There 
were no systematic issues apparent in the results available to review.  

SRK considers the sample preparation and analysis procedures, and the QA/QC methods and results 
to adequately verify the analytical database as sufficient for use in resource estimation.

12 Data Verification 
12.1 Procedures 

All analytical data is checked by the on-site and Lima-based geologists before it is added to the 
database. This includes review of standard, blank and duplicate sample results for outliers, and 
requesting re-analysis if necessary. Final analytical data is appended to the database by the Sao Paulo 
office staff after additional verification.  

During the site visit by SRK, the geologic database was checked for its consistency to a) logged core, 
b) logging sheets and sample records and c) database provided to SRK. All aspects of the data capture 
and storage were seen to be in good order. The core sample library in the core shed (Figure 12-1) 
helps to make the logged geology consistent.

Drillhole collar locations are verified against topography, and compared with the survey reports. 
Downhole survey data are reviewed by an on-site geologist to verify the results.  

12.2 Limitations 
SRK did not verify the analytical values in the database with reported values on assay certificates. An 
additional means to verify analytical zinc and lead grades in the drillhole database could be comparison 
to visual estimations of sphalerite and galena abundance or to measured specific gravity.

12.3 Opinion on Data Adequacy 
The Project geologists and support staff were diligent about data verification and the quality of the 
drillhole database. Database validation in preparation for resource estimation has been done by 
Votorantim. Although SRK did not verify the analytical values in the database with reported values 
from assay certificates, there were no indicators of erroneous data. SRK believes the degree of 
organization of the data base and the measures in place to minimize errors in data ensure a high-
quality database.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Votorantim retained a metallurgical consultant, Smallvill S.A.C. of Lima, Peru (Smallvill) to perform 
metallurgical studies on Florida Canyon mineralization types in 2010, 2011 and 2014. All the 
metallurgical testing programs aimed to produce commercial quality concentrates from a polymetallic 
lead-zinc mineralization. The tested samples show heads grades significantly higher when compared 
to other known mineral deposits in the region. SRK has relied heavily on these studies for recovery 
and cost forecasting to develop cut-off grades for resource reporting.  

The Florida Canyon sulfide resource consists of zinc and lead sulfides in a limestone matrix where 
zinc is in higher proportions than lead. There are no deleterious elements present in concentrates in 
high enough levels to trigger smelter penalties.  

13.1 Testing and Procedures  
A total of eight metallurgical testing documents addressing the metallurgical development for Florida 
Canyon Project were made available to SRK. All of the metallurgical testwork to date have been 
executed between 2011 and 2014 (Table 13-1) by Smalvill S.A.C., an independent commercial 
laboratory based in Lima, Peru.

13.2 Relevant Results 

 Mineralogy 
Mineralogical analysis of a sulfide composite was conducted on the head sample by X-ray 
diffraction. The results are provided in Table 13-2. The majority of the sample (80%) consists of 
calcium and magnesium carbonates from the dolomite matrix, with low iron sulfide content as 
pyrite, arsenopyrite, and pyrrhotite.

Approximately 60% (by volume) of the material is gangue comprised of dolomite, calcite and quartz. 
These minerals have specific gravities between 2.70 and 2.85 g/cm3. XRD analysis also confirmed 
the presence of zinc oxides, predominantly as smithsonite, and to a lesser extent, hemimorphite. 

 Recovery and Concentrate Grades  
All the metallurgical testing programs aimed to produce commercial quality concentrates from a 
polymetallic lead-zinc mineralization. The tested samples show head grades significantly higher when 
compared to other known mineral deposits in the region. Grades for the eight metallurgical tests for 
Florida Canyon are shown in Table 13-4 and Figure 13-1. 

Head grade in the tested samples ranged from 5.7% Zn total up to 31.7% Zn total. Meanwhile, the 
oxide zinc ranged from 0% up to 18.4%. Lead grades for the same samples was significantly lower 
than those of zinc, but still higher than typical mill feed grades in the other MVT deposits in the region 
ranging 0.5% up to 3.9%.

Based on the characteristics of the samples tested, SRK is of the opinion that Florida Canyon is best 
classified as a polymetallic deposit of mixed rock types. It is defined as a polymetallic deposit because 
all tested samples have varying levels of Zn, Pb, and Ag with good potential of producing a commercial 
quality zinc concentrate, and lead concentrate. It is defined as mixed rock, because all tested samples 
present varying levels of oxidization, with zinc oxide and lead oxide appearing to be in similar relative 
proportion to each other, i.e., ratio ZnOx/ZnT is comparable to PbOx/PbT in the tested samples. 

Producing a commercial quality zinc concentrate was easily achieved from the three samples showing 
a fresh feed ratio of ZnOx/ZnT<0.05, 0.06, and 0.19; all three samples would typically qualify as sulfide 
ore. 

In previous test work, producing a commercial quality zinc concentrate from mixed mineralized material 
needed to incorporate Dense Media Separation methods (DMS) to maintain high recoveries (80+%). 
A conventional flotation approach reached commercial quality (about 50%Zn) at the expense of 
significantly lower metal recovery, with a similar outcome for the lead concentrate. It is SRK's opinion 
that conventional flotation should be able to achieve commercial level results (grade and recovery) 
under improved crushing, grinding, and flotation conditions. 

The generation of slimes and ultrafine particles during grinding was constant for all tested samples. In 
addition to minimizing slimes generation during grinding, there was an opportunity to have adjusted 
flotation conditions to deal with the loss of recovery to the slimes in a single stage. Removing slimes 
from the circuit for additional processing is one approach, but another approach could be be more 
cost-effective, and should be addressed in future testing. 

No penalty elements were present in final concentrates in high enough levels to trigger penalties under 
typical market conditions. 

 Hardness  
Lithology seems to play an important role in the metallurgical performance of the tested samples. 
Ultrafine particle generation during conventional grinding is high, and it seems to be driven by natural 
weathering of the rock. The type of mineralization at Florida Canyon can also be observed in existing 
operating mines in the region. 

Results from the rock's hardness tests were consistent with above observations for all tested samples, 
see Table 13-5. The Bond Work Index results ranged from 8.54 kWh/tonne to a maximum of 
12.6 kWh/tonne which typically qualifies as a soft plant feed.

 Reagents 
Common lead and zinc collectors and depressants at varying dosage rates were tested. Details of the 
test procedures and results are available in Smallvill (2011). 

• Zinc sulfate as a depressant in lead flotation was determined to not be required; 
• The optimum lead flotation pH was determined to be neutral at 7.6; 
• Sodium Isopropyl Xanthate, as a lead collector non selective for zinc and iron, at a dosage of 

12 g/t was optimal for lead recovery. Higher dosages were required to depress zinc and pyrite; 
and 

• Copper sulfate, coupled with Z-11 to depress pyrite, was tested to activate the zinc in zinc 
flotation. The optimum dosages were 100 and 20 g/t, respectively. 

13.3 Recovery Projections 
The 2014 recovery testing focused on quantifying recovery as it relates to a measurable zinc oxide:zinc 
total ratio (ZnO/ZnT). The ratio was determined from 2,813 samples from 423 drillholes with good 
spatial representation. Depending on their availability and applicability, samples were taken from either 
coarse rejects or pulp samples. The ratio was estimated into the block model for each metal of interest. 
SRK developed a sliding-scale recovery curve for each metal using such ratio.  

The recovery estimates for Florida Canyon relative to ZnO/ZnT are illustrated in Figure 13-2. Table 
13-6 provides the recovery estimates by material type.

The average metallurgical recoveries calculated from the mine plan resource for the diluted mineable 
deposit were 80%, 74% and 52% for zinc, lead, and silver, respectively.  

Anticipated concentrate grades used in cut-off grade calculations are 50% for both zinc and lead 
concentrates, the latter containing associated silver.  

13.4 Significant Factors and Recommendations  
SRK sees opportunities for more advanced test work to optimize the metallurgical recovery flow sheet. 
Previous test work used conventional procedures that were not specific to Florida Canyon material 
types. Similarly, fines encountered in previous work were not handled appropriately, resulting in sub-
optimal flotation conditions and consequently metallurgical results. Sample selection is a key element 
and more site-specific test work is expected to enhance overall recovery projections at the next level 
of study. 

Considering that the laboratory encountered difficulties in terms of recovery and grade when 
attempting to reach separation of the zinc and lead minerals into their respective commercial quality 
concentrates, SRK recommends approaching the selection of samples for the next phase of 
metallurgical testing considering the following: 

• The core logging needs to incorporate attributes like clay%, clay type, RQD, oxide content, 
sulfide content; 

• Develop the block model to a level of confidence that identify lithologies, mineralization and 
alteration throughout the deposit, as well as incorporating all the parameters recorded in 
during the core logging; 

• Assaying of the core should include whole rock analysis. If lithology varies significantly along 
the core, then the core interval's length should be adjusted (lengthened or shortened) with the 
purpose of capturing variability; and 

• Collect samples for metallurgical testing representing distinctive zones in the deposit. 
Representation must be understood as distinctive lithology, mineralization, oxide-to-sulfide 
ratio. Grade variability should be a secondary criterion when selecting samples, but they must 
be reasonably close to what a potential mining operation would be able to deliver to the mill. 

Additionally, SRK recommends developing a suitable metallurgical testing program with the assistance 
of an experienced professional, select a reputable commercial testing facility with proven QA/QC 
protocols for testing and chemical assaying, and have the testing program directly supervised by a 
professional that is independent from the testing facility.

14 Mineral Resource Estimate  
Mineral Resource estimation for the Florida Canyon deposit was conducted by Votorantim Metais 
(Votorantim) in August, 2013 and reported by Mineral Resources Management (MRM), an internal 
resource modeling group of Votorantim, in December of 2013 (Votorantim, 2013b). In April of 2014, 
SRK Consulting was contracted by Solitario to audit the MRM resource estimate and prepare a 
Technical Report on Resources compliant with the guidance of National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-
101). This detailed independent analysis showed that the modeling methods used by Votorantim in 
2013 were valid and produced an appropriate resource estimate. These same methods were used by 
Votorantim for updating the estimated total zinc and total lead in the preparation of this 2017 resource 
estimate.  

Since the 2013 resource estimate, Votorantim has conducted a considerable amount of resampling 
and metallurgical test work to determine recoverable sulfide and oxide grades for both zinc and lead 
to better understand recoverable metal in the deposit. This work led to a change in the definition of 
oxide, transition, and sulfide domains. In the 2013 model, oxide, transition, and sulfide domains were 
developed based on logged values and then individual metallurgical recoveries were assigned as to 
each domain. Following the 2014 metallurgical test work, it was determined that a quantitative 
approach utilizing the ratio of estimated oxide zinc grade to estimated total zinc grade would provide 
the best representation of the recoverable resource. 

Development of the 2017 resource estimate involved two separate grade estimations. First, primary 
reporting grades were estimated using the same samples as the Votorantim 2013 resource estimate. 
This estimate assigned the grades from which metal quantities were calculated in the resource. A 
second resource estimate was conducted using the Votorantim 2014 sample program to assign sulfide 
and oxide grades for both zinc and lead. These grades were used to calculate a zinc oxide to total zinc 
ratio (ZnOx/ZnT), which was then used to determine if material was oxide, sulfide, or mixed and to 
assign a recovery to each modeled block based on that ratio.  

The 2014 Votorantim test work included 2,813 intervals from 423 drillholes resampled out of the 2006-
2013 drilling campaigns. Depending on their availability and applicability, samples were taken from 
either coarse rejects or pulp samples. Following a detailed sample validation program, which included 
539 control samples (blanks and standards), 238 samples were rejected leaving 2,575 samples to 
complete this exercise. After the new assays were tabulated they were used to estimate sulfide and 
oxide grades in the block model.  

In preparing the current resource statement, SRK has used engineering experience and informed 
assumptions to define the appropriate cut-off grade to reflect the mining and processing methods and 
anticipated costs. This report provides a mineral resource estimate and a classification of resources 
and reserves reported in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum 
Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves: Definitions and Guidelines, November 27, 2010 
(CIM). The resource estimate and related geologic model auditing were conducted by, or under the 
supervision of, J. B. Pennington, M.Sc., C.P.G., of SRK Consulting in Reno, Nevada, who is a Certified 
Professional Geologist as recognized by the American Institute of Professional Geologists and a 
Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. 

The Mineral Resource estimate was based on a 3-D geological model of major structural features and 
stratigraphically controlled alteration and mineralization. A total of 23 mineral domains were interpreted

from mineralized drill intercepts, comprised mostly of 1 m core samples. The project is in metric units. 
Zinc, lead and silver were estimated into model blocks using Ordinary Kriging (OK). Oxide, Sulfide and 
Mixed material types were determined based on the ZnOx/ZnT ratio. Density was determined from a 
large percentage (55%) of measured values, which were used to develop equations for density 
assignment based on rock type and kriged metal content of the samples.  

14.1 Geology and Mineral Domain Modeling 
Florida Canyon is interpreted as a Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) base metal deposit dominated by 
the zinc and lead sulfides sphalerite and galena. These minerals occur as disseminated and massive 
replacements hosted in stratigraphically controlled dolomitized limestones of the Upper Triassic to 
Lower Jurassic Chambara Formation. The deposit is located in karst terrain and, due to locally high 
degrees of water percolation, shallow sulfide mineralization is locally altered to oxidized carbonate and 
silicate minerals (smithsonite, hemimorphite and cerussite), collectively referred to in this report as 
"oxides". Mineralization occurs both as a set of nearly flat-lying stratiform "mantos" intersected locally 
by high-angle mineralized zones (e.g.: Sam and San Jorge).  

The geological model underpinning the resource estimate was generated in Leapfrog Geo™ 1.3 
software using the drillhole database from the drilling campaigns of Cominco and Votorantim.  

The underlying carbonate stratigraphy of the Florida Canyon deposit is dome-shaped on a regional 
scale (Figure 14-1). This geometry was fundamental to the construction of the geological contacts and 
boundaries of mineralized bodies.  

Surfaces that represent stratigraphic units Chambara 1, 2 and 3 were constructed through the contact 
points of the lithologies in 3-D. The fossil marker beds of Coquina and IBM were identified and used 
as guide horizons. Then the five main faults that cut the deposit were modeled. The faults were located 
using a 3-D projection of the geological surface map onto topography in conjunction with fault 
intercepts as logged in drillholes. The projected geologic surface map is shown in Figure 14-2.  

Mineralization is hosted exclusively in dolomitized limestone. The interpreted dolomitized zones 
between the lower Coquina and the upper IBM marker horizons are shown in tan in Figure 14-3. The 
extent of dolomite alteration was logged in drillholes and modeled within the five major structural 
domains.  

Mineralized wireframes were built in close relationship to the dolomitization envelope and modified 
(offset) by internal structures when these offsets were clearly defined. Mineral domains were 
constructed using a 0.5% zinc cut-off grade. The mineral domain wireframes were built in Leapfrog 
Geo™ and then imported to MineSight 3D® format for block coding and resource estimation.  

In total, 23 individual wireframes were built, which vary from 1 to 12 m in thickness, but most were a 
minimum of 2 to 3 m thick to address dilution. SRK observed several mineralized intercepts outside of 
all mineral domains. These were intentionally left out due to insufficient understanding of continuity. 
Figure 14-4 illustrates the stratiform manto-style mineralization (red, n = 21) and the N-S oriented 
steeply dipping (70°) Sam and San Jorge zones (blue, n = 2).

14.2 Drillhole Database 

 Database 
SRK acquired the project drilling data in MineSight format from Votorantim. The database includes 
drilling campaigns of two different companies, as well as the resampled data from Votorantim. A total 
of 82 drillholes were completed by Cominco totaling 24,781 m drilled from 1997 to 2000, and 404 
drillholes were completed by Votorantim including 92,499 m drilled from 2006 to 2013. The MineSight 
drillhole database contains a subset of the relevant portion of this data.

 Topography and Sample Locations 
Surface topography was generated using a digital aerial survey modified by the points of the drill collars 
surveyed with a total station instrument. 

SRK imported the digital topography into MineSight software and validated drill collar elevations 
relative to topography.  

Downhole surveys were completed by Reflex EZ-Shot by the drillers at 100 m (2010), 50 m (2011) 
and 20 m (2012/13) down-hole spacings. The records of these are kept digitally at the core facility and 
were verified during the SRK site visit.  

 Oxidation Classification in Drillhole Logging 
Oxidation classification of core sample intervals has previously been determined visually according to 
the abundance of sphalerite and galena, as well as according to hemimorphite and smithsonite 
phases. With the dedicated 2014 metallurgical sampling program, the ratio of estimated zinc oxide to 
zinc total ratio is based on the Votorantim grade estimation which has superseded the visual logging 
of sulfides. In this resource estimate, any blocks with a ZnOx/ZnT ratio less than 0.2 are considered 
sulfide, a ZnOx/ZnT ratio between 0.2 and 0.8 is considered mixed, and a ZnOx/ZnT ratio greater than 
0.8 is considered oxide. 

14.3 Drilling Data Analysis 
The source database contains 486 diamond core drillholes totaling 117,280.25 m. There are 47,970 
intervals with geological description, from which 23,863 were sampled and have chemical analyses 
for zinc. Fewer have analyses for lead and silver, 13,780 and 23,699 intervals, respectively. 
Approximately 91% of the sample intervals had measured core recovery and the core recovery 
averaged 98.3%. The Votorantim MineSight drillhole database used to build this resource model 
contains a subset of 441 holes totaling 109762.2 m of drilling, from which, 24,244 intervals have 
chemical analyses for zinc. The raw assay statistics for the samples in the database used to develop 
the resource are presented in Table 14-1.  

For grade estimation for the manto bodies, only the intervals that fell within the Manto solids were 
used. Intervals that were drilled within a given manto wireframe were flagged with its corresponding 
code and then composited at fixed lengths honoring those flags. Table 14-2 includes the summary 
statistics for the 2,875 assay intervals flagged with a Manto code.

 Capping 
SRK's approach for capping was to analyze raw assay data and identify statistical outliers in each 
element of economic interest. For this analysis, those assays contained within the interpreted mineral 
domains were analyzed. Histograms and cumulative frequency graphs were prepared for zinc, lead 
and silver variability. In the variability charts, a predominantly log-normal distribution was observed, 
which does not show clear inflections, signifying a single population distribution and not separate high 
and low-grade populations. For these reasons, SRK concludes zinc, lead and silver do not require 
capping. The single anomalously high zinc value (57.3%) in the database in hole V_465 (116.1 to 
117.1 m) was inspected in 3-D and found to be consistent with and part of a 10 m high grade interval 
in an area of the San Jorge mineral domain supported by high-grade intercepts in neighboring 
drillholes. 

During grade estimation, Votorantim elected to use a sliding-scale percentile method for capping 
relative to search pass, in a multi-pass estimation process. SRK has reviewed the Votorantim 
approach and considers it appropriate if not slightly conservative relative to our analysis of the grade 
populations.  

 Compositing 
In the software, the raw assay database was back-coded using the mineral domain (Manto) wireframes 
described in Section 14.1, resulting in 2,875 intercepts inside the mineralized shapes. The coded 
samples were then composited to the length of 1.5 m generating 1,931 composited samples out of 
2,875 original samples. Intervals at the end of a Manto domain less than 0.75 m in length were merged 
into the previous interval. As numerous analyses were run using this data set in addition to generating 
the resource estimate, several items were added to the data files with different IDs. For clarity, Table 
14-3 includes the item ID's used in the drillholes and their corresponding composite ID and description

14.4 Density 
Density is calculated in the model using the following equation: 

DENSITY = 2.786 + ( 0.016 * ZN ) + ( 0.037 * PB) 

SRK checked the assigned density values in the model and found the density to be defined by this 
equation. Spot checks for block values show a very slight discrepancy for some blocks, however, a 
global validation check showed these discrepancies amount to a resource density change of less than 
0.01%. SRK is of the opinion that, due to the minimal impact this difference has on the reported 
resource tonnage, this discrepancy is not material to the resource and considers the density 
assignment to be valid.

14.5 Variogram Analysis and Modeling 
In preparing the previous 2014 Resource Estimate, an extensive review of the deposit variography 
was conducted. Separate semi-variograms, normalized to a sill of 1.0 were generated using samples 
from both the high-angle structurally controlled domains (Sam, San Jorge) and the flat stratiform 
mineralized mantos (Karen-Milagros). In preparing this 2017 resource estimate, a similar exercise was 
conducted by Votorantim, with the addition of Block 1, Block 2 and Block3 domains that were designed 
to capture the different structural trends of the deposit (Figure 14-6).  

As the underlying total lead and zinc grade data being estimated has not changed between the current 
and the 2014 resource estimates, SRK did not repeat this exercise. Rather, the search ranges and 
directions used for this estimation run were compared to those used in the 2014 Resource Estimate 
and compared to the underlying geology. Based on that review, SRK finds that the search criteria used 
for this modeling effort are appropriate, and well supported by the underlying geology. 

Details of the variography are presented in Table 14-8. 

14.6 Block Model 

 Model Specifications 
The block model was constructed in UTM metric coordinates using MineSightTM modeling software. A 
block size of 6 m wide x 6 m long x 3 m high was used. Horizontal block dimensions were determined 
based on drill sample spacing and the block height was selected to maintain the resolution needed for 
mine planning. The parameters used in the generation of the block model are summarized in Table 
14-5. Field descriptions of model items are provided in Table 14-6. SRK added items to facilitate 
engineering as outlined in Table 14-7.

 Model Construction 
The two sets of mineralized wireframes were imported and coded into the MANTO item in the 
MineSight model. Both the code of each solid and the percentage of each solid were stored in the 
blocks. 

Given the uneven distribution of holes and the domal shape of the deposit, the model was divided into 
three areas based on the orientation of the mineralized shapes. The areas, flagged in the BLOCK item, 
were then used to control the anisotropic search direction used during grade estimation. The two 
vertical structures, Sam and Sam Jorge, we estimated independently. The block codes stored in the 
model are shown in Figure 14-5.

14.7 Grade Estimation 
The strategy for block grade estimation was the same for all variables considered in each of the mineral 
domains. Grades in each domain were estimated only with composites coded to that domain. The 
estimate for zinc, lead, and silver was performed by four pass Ordinary Kriging for both the Votorantim 
2014 and Votorantim 2017 grade items. The first pass used a long search distance intended to fill the 
mineral domains with grade. This pass was capped at the 95th percentile to prevent proliferation of 
high grades during the estimate. For the second and third passes, distances were shortened with each 
pass and the grade cap adjusted to the 97th and 99th percentiles, respectively. The fourth pass ran with 
the shortest search distance and high grades were not capped. Each pass was reviewed for each 
estimation domain and adjusted as necessary to validate compared to input composites. 

Details of the grade estimation by Block and Manto are presented in Table 14-8.

14.8 Zinc, Lead, and Silver Recovery Calculation 
As outlined in Metallurgical Section 13 of this report, SRK's metallurgical QP determined that the zinc 
oxide to total ratio (ZnOx/ZnT) provided the best analog to define the material types (oxide, mixed, or 
sulfide) and therefore provided the best analog for recovery for zinc, lead, and silver. With this 
information, only the zinc ratio was used for calculation of recovery. Recovery was calculated on a 
block by block basis and stored to the model using the following criteria: 

If: ZnOx/ZnT < 0.2  
Then:  
Zn Recovery (ZNREC) = 93%, Pb Recovery (PBREC) = 84%, Ag Recovery (AGREC) = 56% 
Or: 
If: 0.2 ≤ ZnOx/ZnT ≤ 0.8  
Then:  
ZNREC = (-0.8833 * ZnOx/ZnT + 1.1067) * 100 
PBREC= (-0.7333 * ZnOx/ZnT + 0.9867) * 100 
AGREC = (-0.4 * ZnOx/ZnT + 0.64) * 100 
Or: 
If: ZnOx/ZnT > 0.8 
Then: 
ZNREC = 40%, PBREC = 40%, and AGREC = 32% 

The recoveries for each were then multiplied by the total estimated grades from the Votorantim 
samples to calculate a recovered grade for each element, which was then stored back the model.  

14.9  Zinc Equivalent Grade Calculation 
For multi-element deposits, mine planning work and reporting of mineable resources is simplified by 
converting the grade contribution of each element into an equivalent grade of the primary commodity 
to be sold. For Florida Canyon, the primary economic commodity is zinc, therefore a zinc equivalent 
grade was calculated. With this equivalent grade, a cut-off could be calculated utilizing only the zinc 
prices, costs, and recoveries, since the prices, costs, and recoveries of the other elements have been 
factored into the equivalent grade. 

Due to the variable recovery in the model, the cut-off grade for each estimated block is different. To 
compensate for this, SRK developed a "recovered" zinc equivalent grade (RecZnEq% or ZNREQ) that 
accounted for the recovery of each element block by block. With this item defined, a constant cut-off 
grade could then be applied to the RecZnEq% item in the model. 

A contained (non-recovered) equivalent grade was also generated for reporting purposes.  

The inputs for determining the factors used to calculate the contained zinc equivalent are provided 
below: 

Contained Zinc Equivalent Grade: 

ZNEQ = ZNREQ / ZNREC * 100 

The inputs for determining the factors used to calculate recovered zinc equivalent grade, along with 
further discussion on equivalent grades and cut-off calculations are provided in sections 14.13 and 
16.3.

Recovered Zinc Equivalent Grade: 

ZNREQ = ZNTRC + 0.807 x PBTRC + 0.029 x AGVRC 

14.10 Model Validation 
Validation of the block model involved an SRK review of the Votorantim model coupled with an 
independent estimation of the model grades by SRK. To carry out the independent evaluation, SRK 
utilized the drilling database (assays and composites) and block model files provided by Votorantim in 
MineSight format. 

SRK validated the model by several methods: 

• SRK independent grade estimate compared to the Votorantim grade estimate; 
• Visual comparative analysis between composite and block grades; and 
• Statistical comparison of global averages of the original composite values and the model 

estimates. 

 SRK Grade Estimate vs Votorantim Grade Estimate 
SRK's first step in validating the block model was to replicate the estimated grades in the Votorantim 
model, using a simplified resource estimate for each mineral domain. SRK ran a single pass spherical 
search, inverse distance squared interpolation. This estimate only allowed block grades to be 
calculated from composites with a matching MANTO code. A spherical search was deemed sufficient 
for this exercise as the wireframes were narrow and "vein-like" and only composites from the same 
mineral domain as a block were used in the estimate of grade in that block. 

SRK found that a 150 m search distance filled roughly the same volume of blocks with grade as the 
Votorantim estimate and therefore, that search distance was used for all mantos and grade items. 
SRK then compared the total grades of the SRK estimate and to the Votorantim estimate at both a 
0.00% zinc (ZNTKV) cut-off as well as a 3.00% ZNTKV cut-off.  

At a 0.0% ZNTKV cut-off grade, the SRK zinc, lead, and silver grade estimates were 20% higher, 23% 
higher, and 14% lower than the Votorantim grade estimate, respectively. As the SRK estimate used a 
relatively long search and did not limit high grades, this indicates that the more conservative multi-
pass approach used by Votorantim in conjunction with grade capping during longer search distance 
was successful in limiting the propagation of the high zinc and lead grades. Silver grades were similar 
between the two estimates. Upon visual inspection, the Votorantim grade estimation appeared to hold 
grade close to the composite data and appeared to be geologically accurate.  

At a 3.0% ZNTKV cut-off grade, the SRK zinc, lead, and silver grade estimates were 14% higher, 21% 
higher, and 19% lower than the Votorantim grade estimate, respectively.  

This exercise was performed for SRK to verify that the Votorantim model was not overestimating or 
overstating mineral resources. Once confirmed, the Votorantim model was used as the basis for SRK 
resource reporting and further, downstream mine planning. 

 Visual Comparison 
SRK conducted a visual comparison of block grades to drillhole composites in 2-D (plan, section) and 
in 3-D. Stepping through the plans and sections, SRK notes close correlation between composite

grades in drillholes and adjacent model block grades. In general, grade trends on section appear 
geologically correct in relation to the composite grades. 

 Comparative Statistics 
The global mean of zinc, lead, and silver of composite samples for each of the mineral domain groups 
was compared to the mean of estimated values of the blocks at zero cut-off grade. The comparison is 
presented in Table 14-9 for all classifications of resource (Measured, Indicated and Inferred) 
combined. Block grades are lower than composite grades for all elements as desired, confirming that 
the estimation process did not "manufacture" metal.

14.11 Resource Classification 
The Mineral Resources of the Florida Canyon deposit were classified based on the guidelines 
promulgated by CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources, November 27, 2010 (CIM) where 
resources are ranked in order of decreasing geological confidence into classes of Measured, Indicated 
and Inferred. Mineral domaining was the first level of classification. Mineral domains were bounded by 
drill intercepts, where the wireframe boundaries were defined halfway between mineralized and non-
mineralized samples on an interpreted grade horizon or structure. The structure and stratigraphic 
controls on the Florida Canyon deposit are well understood; hence, all of the material in the block 
model inside the mineral domains achieved at least Inferred classification. Higher classification 
categories (Measured and Indicated) required close-spaced sampling. 

Classification of the resources reflects the relative confidence of the grade estimates. This is based 
on several factors, including: sample spacing relative to the geological and geostatistical observations 
regarding the continuity of mineralization; mining history; specific gravity determinations; accuracy of 
drill collar locations; and quality and reliability of the assay data. 

Resource classification at Florida Canyon was based on numerical criteria. Blocks classified as 
Measured were estimated by Ordinary Kriging using at least three composites within 25 m in the major 
and semi-major search directions and 10 m in the minor search direction.  

Blocks classified as Indicated were estimated by Ordinary Kriging using at least three composites 
within 50 m in the major and semi-major search directions and 20 m in the minor search direction.  

Blocks classified as inferred were estimated by Ordinary Kriging using at least two composites within 
100 m in the major and semi-major search directions and 40 m in the minor search direction.  

A fourth category was flagged in the model including blocks estimated beyond the limits above. 
Because this material is well controlled by the mineralized wireframes and is spatially controlled by the

geologic model, this material has been included as Inferred Resources in the resource statement. For

• Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that 

all or any part of the Mineral Resources estimated will be converted into Mineral Reserves. 
• Grades reported in this table are "contained" and do not include recovery. 
• Mineral resources are reported to a 2.8% recovered zinc-equivalent (RecZnEq%) cut-off grade. 
• Assuming the average recoveries for the resource, this corresponds to non-recovered cut-off grade of 3.6% contained 

ZnEq%.  
• RecZnEq% was calculated by multiplying each block grade by its estimated recovery, then applying mining costs, 

processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, smelting terms, and transportation costs to determine an 
equivalent contribution of each grade item to the Net Smelter Return. 

• Mining costs, processing, G&A, smelting, and transportation costs total US$74.70/t. 
• Metal price assumptions were: Zinc (US$/lb 1.20), Lead (US$/lb 1.0) and Silver (US$/oz 17.50). 
• As the recovery for each element was accounted for in the RecZnEq%, recoveries were not factored into the calculation 

of the 2.8% cut-off grade.  
• Average metallurgical recoveries for the resource are: Zinc (80%), Lead (74%) and Silver (52%). 
• The equivalent grade contribution factors used for calculating RecZnEq% were: (1.0 x recovered Zn %) + (0.807 x 

recovered Pb %) + (0.026 x recovered Ag ppm). 
• The contained ZnEq% grade reported above was calculated by dividing the RecZnEq% grade by the calculated zinc 

recovery. 
• Density was calculated based on material types and metal grades. The average density in the mineralized zone was 3.01 

g/cm3. 
• Mineral Resources, as reported, are undiluted. 
• Mineral Resource tonnage and contained metal have been rounded to reflect the precision of the estimate and numbers 

may not add due to rounding. 

 

14.13 Mineral Resource Cut-off Grade Determination 
A cut-off grade (CoG) of 2.8% recovered ZnEq% was calculated for reporting report resources. The 
CoG for the resource was determined using a zinc sales price of US$1.20/lb, total mineralized material 
processing, transportation, smelting, and general and administrative costs totaling US$74.70/t. No 
dilution was applied to the cut-off calculation and, as recovery was included in the grade item, recovery 
was applied as 100% in the equation below. 

CoG = (Total Mineralized Material Mining and Processing Costs) 
Zn Price x (Zn Process Recovery) x 22.046 

The recovered ZnEq% is SRK's preferred parameter for reporting resources as it is equivalent to a 
positive Net Smelter Return (NSR).

By comparison, if cut-off grade is evaluated against contained zinc equivalent, then SRK would apply 
the average zinc recovery for the resource and the resulting cut-off grade is 3.6% contained ZnEq.

16 Mining Methods 
The Florida Canyon project is located approximately 680 km north-northeast of Lima, Peru in the 
Shipasbamba community, Bongará Province, Amazonas Department, Peru. The approximate central 
point coordinates of the Project are 825,248 East and, 9,352,626 North (UTM Zone 17S, Datum WGS 
84). The zone of interest is a dolomitized limestone-hosted polymetallic deposit containing known zinc, 
lead and silver mineralization. The topography consists of mountainous terrain with deep canyons and 
elevations in the immediate area of the deposit ranging from 1950 to 3310 masl. 

A number of factors are considered in the selection of an appropriate mining method to exploit a 
mineralized zone. The factors include, but are not limited to, the geometry, depth, mineralogy, 
continuity of mineralization, geotechnical conditions, hydrological conditions, value of the mineral, and 
environmental factors. In the context of the Florida Canyon project, the following key parameters were 
considered in the selection of appropriate mining methods described in this study: 

• Geometry: The structure at Florida Canyon is dominated by a N50º-60ºW trending domal 
anticline (or doubly plunging anticline) (SRK, 2014b). This anticlinal structure results in 
potential mining blocks of the manto deposits oriented along shallow dipping footwall/floors 
with dips ranging from 0° at the hinge to 25° near the middle to outer edges of the dome. The 
dip is as steep as 50° in the south of the deposit near the San Jorge exploration adit. 
Additionally, two steeply dipping mineralized bodies have been interpreted to exist. The first, 
known as San Jorge (zone F1), is located at the southern end of the deposit, and the other, 
known as SAM (zones 2 and 3), is located on the southwest edge of the deposit. The dip of 
these bodies ranges from 60° to 85° in San Jorge and 55° to 80° in the SAM body. 

• Higher grade manto mineralization in the anticlinal dome consists of zones between 1 m and 
9 m thick mantos with barren gaps between the mantos as small as 1.5 m. Twenty mantos 
and two steeply dipping vein structures have been modeled and are of sufficient grade to be 
considered for potential mining. 

• Depth: the mineralized bodies outcrop in several areas and the potential mining depth reaches 
550 m in the steeply dipping areas and 470 m in the shallow dipping mantos in the northern 
extremities of the deposit.  

• Mineralization: the lead-zinc mineralization is generally classified into three material types – 
sulfide, oxide and mixed. Oxidized mineralization tends to occur in the upper zones of the 
deposit near the surface with sulfide material generally occurring in deeper zones. Mixed 
material, ranging from Zn Oxide to Total Zn ratios of 0.2 to 0.8 occurs throughout the 
mineralized zone but generally overly the sulfide zones.  

• Continuity: the modeled mantos are fairly continuous and extend 2.1 km from the southwest 
to the northeast. The northern area extends laterally 1.1 km perpendicular to a SW-NE trend. 
The steeply dipping SAM area 600 m north to south with a thickness of 2 m to more than 30 m. 
The modeled San Jorge body measures 500 m north to south with thicknesses ranging from 
1 m to more than 25 m. 

• Geotechnical: Rock quality in the Chambará 2, the primary mineralized unit, is quite good 
(Good to Very Good Quality – Q' 20-40). Q' values ranged from 4 to 40 for the geotechnical 
domains. Open stoping with pastefill is the preferred mining method where the mineralized 
zone is steeper than 45° to 50°. Flatter dipping sections of the deposit may be mined by room 
and pillar or drift and fill methods.

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

• Hydrological: The mine is located in a high rainfall environment. Infiltration of surface water 
persists to approximately 50 m depth and recharges groundwater via structural pathways and 
interconnected karst features in dolomitized and de-dolomitized carbonate stratigraphy. The 
potentiometric surface has been determined by a series of piezometers. This groundwater 
surface follows the south-southwest flow direction of Florida Canyon and daylights at the river 
level in the canyon. Most of the planned mining of the flat mantos will occur above the water 
table. Steeper zones of mineralization, such as San Jorge and Sam will occur below the water 
table as will parts of the Karen Milagros mantos to the north. Local inflows may be encountered 
when crossing faults or intercepting karst features. 

• Mineral Value: the average NSR value of mineralized material contained within minable 
shapes, including dilution, is over US$140/t. Two concentrate products, lead and zinc, are 
expected to be produced with the lead concentrate containing payable amount of lead and 
silver. 

• Environmental Factors: the Project is located in the upper Amazon River Basin in a high 
altitude tropical jungle. The rugged topography and high annual rainfall has impacted 
exploration and is expected to impact any future site development and construction. The 
location, climate, topography and sensitivity of the surrounding environment are, and will 
continue to be, important considerations in the design and future operation of any producing 
mine at the site.

16.1 Proposed Mining Methods 
The high-relief topography, depth and lateral extent of the mineralized zones, and environmental 
factors makes open pit mining of the deposit impractical. The selection of a suitable underground 
method or methods is required. Below is a brief generic summary of potential underground mining 
methods and key attributes that were considered for the application of each method. 

• Caving techniques including block caving and sublevel caving: Typically applied to large, thick 
deposits with a fairly steep dip. Blocks or levels are undercut to induce caving of the block. 
Surface subsidence is likely. High production rates are possible. Amount of initial development 
is generally high. 

• Sublevel Stoping: Typically applied to steeply dipping veins with varying thickness. Vertical 
continuity is important. Top and bottom cuts (sills) are excavated above and below the stope. 
Parallel or fan pattern blastholes are drilled. The mineralized material is blasted in vertical 
slices and then mucked from the bottom sill. Stopes can be backfilled to prevent subsidence 
and allow mining of adjacent stopes. 

• Vertical Crater Retreat: Typically applied to steeply dipping, massive deposits. Similar to 
sublevel stoping except that blasting occurs in horizontal slices and uses large diameter blast 
holes. 

• Room and Pillar: Typically applied to flat or shallow dipping deposits. Openings are driven at 
regular intervals and pillars of intact rock are left behind to provide support for the openings. 
Recovery the mineralized material is typically lower than other mining methods due to pillars 
being left behind. Pillar recovery techniques can be applied to improve recovery. 

• Cut and Fill: Typically applied to moderate to steeply dipping deposits. Cuts are made in the 
mineralized material and then backfilled to provide support and allow mining of the cut above 
(overhand cut and fill). Mining recovery is typically high. Operating cost typically higher than 
unsupported or self-supported (caving, room and pillar) methods due to the cost of backfill. 

• Drift and Fill: Similar to cut and fill except that drift and fill is applied where the width of the 
mineralized material requires more than one cut on a given level. 

Other methods such as stull stoping and square set stoping have not been considered due to the high 
cost and generally low productivity of the methods. 

Taking into account the key parameter of the Florida Canyon project, the following underground 
methods are suitable for application. 

• Sublevel Stoping (Longhole Stoping) for the steeply dipping bodies identified as F1 and SAM 
(Figure 16-1). 

• Mechanized Cut and Fill for the moderate dipping bodies. 
• Drift and Fill for the flat to moderate dipping bodies where more than one cut is required due 

to the width of the zone. To increase mining recovery initial (primary) cuts are backfilled with 
cemented paste or rock fill and intervening secondaries are removed and backfilled with 
unconsolidated waste rock or paste as required. 

SRK notes that room and pillar mining has been specified in previous studies with varying mining 
recoveries and cut heights applied. The application of room and pillar techniques is appropriate. 
However, due to the relatively high grade of the mineralized material, cut and fill and drift and fill are 
used in the moderately dipping to flat lying zones with the goal of higher recovery of the mineralized

material. Additionally, due to the topography, climate, and environmental sensitivity of the area SRK 
has attempted to place as much waste rock and tailings underground as possible. Conventional room 
and pillar mining on a checkerboard pattern could be applied to specific zones of the Florida Canyon 
project, particularly in lower grade areas, and should be considered in future trade-off studies at the 
prefeasibility level. 

16.2 Geotechnical Input for Mine Design 
The maximum thickness of the Sam and F1 mineralized zones is 12 m dipping ranging from 65° to 
85°. The mineralized zones are typically 2 to 6 m wide. Open stoping with pastefill is the preferred 
mining method when the mineralized zone is steeper than 45° to 50°. Flatter dipping sections of the 
deposit may be mined by drift and fill methods as summarized in this section. 

Several large (largest 25 m high x 8 m wide x 35 long) karst caverns were intersected by the exploration 
tunnel in a faulted area. Additional karst is observed in drilling, associated with the same normal fault 
plane. Karst and voids may result in difficult mining conditions and potentially delays to mining, 
requiring backfilling and/or additional ground support. An allowance should be made for a certain 
amount of non-mineable areas in karstic areas due to unfavorable ground conditions. 

It is assumed for the geotechnical analysis that the ground will be depressurized by natural drainage 
through the mine. This is typical in karstic conditions where groundwater gradients are significant. The 
hydrogeology data available indicates that groundwater is structurally controlled, so local inflows may 
be encountered when crossing faults or intercepting karst features. It is also possible that the inflows 
will disappear into other karstic features downstream. 

 Geotechnical Characterization 
The geotechnical characterization work for the project was performed by Klohn Crippen Berger and 
documented in a geotechnical report dated October 2013 (KCB, 2013a). Following is a summary of 
parameters developed from that study. 

Within the projected underground workings, the units present are dominated by limestones and 
dolomites of the Chambará formation. The Chambará formation is composed of medium to dark grey 
limestones, dolomitic limestones and dolomites. Nodules and silicic inclusions can be found in some 
of these limestones. These rocks are typically massive, however karstic cavities are a common 
characteristic in the area. There are three main units in the Chambará formation that are characterized 
and influence the geomechanics of the mine design, named Chambará 1, 2 and 3, in order from earlier 
to later time of sediment deposition.  

• Chambará 1 Below the mineralized zone and Chambará 2. This unit is the Footwall (FW) 
and will influence development of stoping areas of the mine. It is composed of sequences of 
fine-grain dolomites and marlstones. The units that host the mineralized body overlie the 
Chambará 1 units and no extraction work is expected in these zones. 

• Chambará 2 This is the main geotechnical domain and comprise the mineralized zone and 
the immediate Hangingwall (HW) and development access. It consists of dolomites and 
limestones. These units host the mineralized body and have an average thickness of about 
200 m. The stratigraphy of Chambará 2 is geologically subdivided into 7 units, which are 
distinguished by the rock textural fabric and composition (packstone, wackstone, mudstone, 
and floatstone).

• Chambará 3 This is above the hangingwall of the mineralized zone, and there will be 
development through the domain. It consists mainly of limestones of the wackestone and 
mudstone types. These are moderately to high bituminous limestones, and cherts can be 
found in some areas. Chambará 3 has an average thickness of 250 m. Fault or joint infill is 
typically composed of bitumen or clays. 

These geologic units are the primary Geotechnical Domains for the project. 

Rock mass classifications including Rock Quality Designation, (RQD) Rock Mass Rating (RMR) 
(Bieniawaski, 1989) and Barton's Q System (Q) (Barton, Lien, & Lunde 1974) for the units of interest 
are listed in Table 16-1. Q' values ranged from 4 to 40 for the geotechnical domains listed. Values 
listed in bold are median values, and the range of values is listed in parentheses. These tests were 
conducted according to ISRM standards which are the industry standard. Rock quality in the 
Chambará 2, the primary mineralized unit, is considered quite good (Good to Very Good Quality – Q' 
20-40).

Intact Rock strengths, as measured by Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) testing, are more than 
75 to 100 MPa, based on the laboratory testing completed on Chambará 2 and 3. Figure 16-5 illustrates 
a histogram of the intact UCS test results. Statistical analysis of the data indicates the mean UCS is 
125 MPa, with a lower bound of 100 MPa and an upper bound of 150 MPa in Chambará 2. These 
tests were conducted according to ASTM standards which are the industry standard. Rock strength in 
the Chambará 2 (mz zone) is considered quite strong.

 Stress Field and topography 
No stress measurements have been made on-site. The orientation of the principal stress field is in an 
east to east-northeast horizontal direction estimated from the world stress map based on back-analysis 
of earthquake focal mechanisms at great depths. This is oriented sub-parallel to the direction of 
subduction that is occurring along the Andean mountain range. 

Steep terrain and local faulting will result in local variations in the stress field. Maximum horizontal 
stresses will tend to be sub-parallel to the strike of major faults. Minimum stresses near the existing 
natural slope faces will tend to be aligned normal to this face. Within the mineralized body, the 
presence of large karstic caverns will also cause stress relief and rotation of stresses near caverns. 

The vertical in situ stress (σv) magnitude is generally taken as the unit weight of the overlying rock 
times the depth. The average vertical stress gradient is assumed at 0.027 MPa/m. 

The horizontal stress ratio (σH:σv) is not known, but in seismically active subduction regions of Peru, it 
is thought to be elevated above the vertical stress. The average horizontal stress ratio can be 
conservatively assumed as 1.2 for underground design purposes. 

 Cut and Fill parameters 
In cut and fill areas KCB recommended 35 m stope lengths in 2.50 to 3.0 m wide and high mineralized 
zones. They also recommend 16 m high sill pillars every 35 m vertically. Based on SRK's review of 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment – Florida Canyon Zinc Project  Page 112

the available data, with good paste filling it may be possible to get three times that distance (about 100 
m) based on the good rock mass quality of the hangingwall rocks and tight backfilling for the PEA level 
design. For cut and fill paste backfill will require a minimum of 1% to 2% cement to dewater the fill and 
minimize the potential for liquefaction. 

 Sub-level Open Stoping Parameters 
When the mineralized zone is steeper than 45° to 50° open stoping with paste backfill is the preferred 
mining method. The recommendations and dimensions listed are also applicable to the near vertical 
sections of the deposit. Rock quality in the Chambará 2 is quite good (Good to Very Good Quality – Q 
20-40) which means larger stopes. Areas with flatter dips need stope stability to be managed. 
Chambara 2 contains the mineralized zone of the deposit. There is sufficient thickness of Chambara 
2 on the order of tens of meters and is sufficient to support the hanging wall of the stoping section of 
the mine. Stacked manto stope areas should be mined from the top hangingwall to the footwall 
sequence. 

Assessment of stable stope dimensions has been made using the empirical Stability Graph Method 
(Potvin 1988). The main objective has been to first confirm the stability of 16 m high stopes, then 
examine the potential for alternative dimensions.  

Stability Graph Method 

The Stability Graph method makes use of a stability number, N', to derive hydraulic radius values (area 
÷ perimeter) for limiting stable stope wall dimensions from a stability graph. The method is based on 
empirical relations from case histories and is well proven as an industry accepted method, especially 
at the PEA level design. As the project moves to a feasibility or design level additional stability modeling 
using numerical methods is recommended. 

The stability number is calculated from a Q' rating multiplied by factors A, B, and C, which take account 
of the stress to strength ratio in the stope wall (A), the orientation of critical joint sets relative to the 
stope wall (B), and the orientation of the stope wall itself (C). 

N' = Q' x A x B x C     (Equation 16.1) 

An empirical chart (the Stability Graph), has been derived (Potvin, 2001) from many real stope stability 
cases studies from various countries worldwide, and relates N' to hydraulic radius for cases where 
stope dimensions are stable, partially unstable (or would prove unstable over long time periods), or 
would collapse or cave. Stability limits are defined both for unsupported and supported cases, where 
support would comprise cable bolting. 

Hydraulic radius (HR) is the ratio of the surface area to perimeter of the stope wall, from which wall 
dimensions can be derived. 

HR = Area of open stope hanging wall surface = width x length 
Perimeter of hanging wall surface  2 (length + width) 

It is possible to define critical hydraulic radii for stability under both unsupported and supported 
conditions using this method, given local geotechnical conditions and stope wall orientations. The HR 
is then adjusted to optimize possible stope dimensions without making dimensions so large that the 
stope is likely to become unstable.

Figure 16-6 illustrates the median and lower bound stability numbers for the wall and back. These are 
based on a lower bound Q value of 10 in the Chambará 2 Both the median and lower bound values 
plot within the unsupported transition zone, indicating that the wall and back will be stable without 
support. Input parameters for the stability graph are listed in Table 16-2. Chambara 3 ground 
conditions are poorer compared to Chambara 2, but there will is sufficient thickness of Chambara 2 
above the back of the stopes, and it is the controlling geotechnical domain for the stope dimensions.

Stability of the transverse hangingwall in 50° to 60° dipping mineralization will be the limitation on the 
size of the opening. KCB has recommended 300 m long transverse stopes in mantos that are 7 m 
high. This size stopes might be most efficiently mined with overcut and undercut with retreat mining 
the sill in between. The 2.5 to 3 m height is considered quite narrow such that stability of the back is 
not the critical factor in the design in the steeper dipping vertical sections of the mine.  

The rock mass inputs to the design and resulting stope dimensions are based on median values of 
rock mass parameters and a resulting stability number N'. The lower bound case for the Chambara 2 
rock mass has been analyzed, and the stope dimensions presented are still valid for this case. The 
results still plot within the limits of the unsupported transition zone. If ground conditions are worse than

indicated by the drill core the transverse stope length may be shortened without affecting the overall 
design. 

Table 16-3 lists the recommended stope dimensions for varying drift sizes. These are appropriate at 
a PEA level. Detailed stope sequencing and stress analysis is recommended for a feasibility level 
study and final mine design.

 Crown Pillar 
The scaled span method was used to assess the stability of the crown pillar for the stopes (Carter, 
2014). This analysis was conducted to prevent a collapse of mine workings to the surface. Based on 
this analysis, if the stope size is restricted just below the crown and near the surface, then the crown 
pillar could be reduced to an equivalent of two to three times the span width.  

However, a minimum crown pillar of 30 m is assumed and used for this study. This is based on the 
steep topography at the site, and wanting to ensure that no stopes or openings approached the 
surface. Tight paste backfill of all stope openings is required. 

Detailed analysis, including local surface topography, and calculation of crown pillar thickness should 
be reevaluated at a FS level study and for final stope design. An opportunity for the project is to 
evaluate the mineralized zone near the surface and to determine if additional material could be brought 
into the mine plan.  

 Sill Pillar Dimensioning 
According to the analysis sill pillars will be required at 35 m intervals, laterally along dip in the shallow 
dipping areas (less than 45°). In the steeply dipping vertical areas sill pillars with a height of 16 m may 
be used for every 96 m (six levels) of vertical excavation. It is assumed that 50% of these pillar levels 
will be able to be recovered on retreat. This may be able to be optimized depending on the geotechnical 
parameters of the paste fill material used. The sill pillars left should be the width of the stope being 
opened, which is expected to be the height of the orebody between 2.5 to 3 m. 

Partial recovery of the sill pillars may be possible. Detailed numerical modeling of the stope sequencing 
and a cost benefit analysis of ground support, dilution and recovery should be made. During feasibility 
and final design sill pillars should optimally be placed in either lower grade zones or waste if possible.

 Ground Support 
The ground support estimate is based on the rock mass classification and on-site experience in the 
exploration drift. Based on the median Q values of 20 to 40 in Chambará 1 and 2, 75% to 90% of the 
ground is not estimated to require ground support. Local spot bolting around faults or shear zones may 
still be required. The local support classification is support class 1 (lowest level) unsupported ground. 
It is estimated that 10% to 25% of development openings will require mesh, bolts and 50 mm of 
shotcrete. Some drifts and openings in Chambará 3 will require pattern bolting and mesh / shotcrete 
(Class 4 support).  

Short-term access to stopes and cut and fill areas (less than 2 years) may use friction bolts. Long term 
(greater than 2 years) bolt elements should consist of fully grouted (cement or resin) bar.  

The estimated ground support parameters were developed based on Barton's tunneling quality index 
Q values as illustrated on Figure 16-7. Dimensions of the access drifts and input parameters for the 
Barton analysis are listed on Table 16-4. A ground support schedule estimate is listed on Table 16-5. 
This table lists the estimated percentage of ground for each ground support class and each 
geotechnical unit. Ground support elements for each class are detailed.

 Tailings Backfill 
Paste-fill assume sufficient cement content to de-water the paste, so that the material will not liquefy. 
For stope backfill 1% to 2% cement backfill is recommended for costing.  

16.3 Mine Design 
The analysis provided in this report is preliminary in nature. The reader is cautioned that Mineral 
Resources are not Ore Reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty 
that this preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

Twenty manto shapes and two steeply dipping vein structures have been modeled as three 
dimensional (3D) wireframes based on drilling and represent shapes above a 0.5% Zn cut-off. A 
resource block model was also used. The block model contained estimated silver, lead, and zinc 
values as well as estimates for the ratio of oxide to total content for each commodity (silver, lead and 
zinc). Each block model block has been classified so that Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral 
Resources can be identified. Blocks in the resource model measures 6 m x 6 m x 3 m in the x, y and 
z directions, respectively. 

Potential mining blocks shapes were constructed using Maptek Vulcan's implementation of Alford 
Mining System's Stope Shape Optimizer (Stope Optimizer). Considering the size and shape of the 
individual mineralized bodies as well as the concepts inherent in Stope Optimizer, the resource model 
blocks needed to be resized to produce a more realistic representation of the potential mining block 
shapes. Blocks in the model were re-blocked to a minimum size of 1 m x 1 m x 0.5 m based on the 
wireframe shapes. The grade values of the original blocks were applied to the blocks inside the 
wireframe shapes. Grade values of 0 were assigned to the blocks outside the wireframes. Figure 16-8 
shows an example section at 9,353,600N (looking north) comparing the original resource model blocks 
and the re-blocked model blocks with the M6 manto wireframe.

 Net Smelter Return 
The mineralized zones at Florida Canyon are polymetallic with zinc, lead and silver contributing to the 
total value of mineralized material. Because the value of the mineralization is not based on one 
commodity, the minable inventory estimate utilizes a Net Smelter Return (NSR) cut-off approach. NSR 
is defined as the proceeds from the sale of mineral products after deducting off-site processing and 
distribution costs and is typically expressed on a dollar per tonne basis. An NSR approach is commonly 
used in the mining industry for polymetallic deposits and is considered best practice. Inputs into the 
NSR calculation include the grade of material, processing recovery, commodity prices, concentrate 
shipping charges, and treatment and refining charges. 

Resource grades are estimated for each block in the resource block model. As described above, the 
resource block model has been reblocked to provide better definition around the wireframe models. 
Processing recoveries are modeled to be variable depending on the ratio of zinc metal associated with 
oxide mineralization to total zinc (ZnOx/ZnT). The expected processing recovery for each element is 
shown in Table 16-6. 

Table 16-6: Expected Processing Recoveries 

Parameter Alteration State Sulfide Mixed Oxide 
ZnOx/ZnT Ratio <= 0.2 0.2 to 0.8 >= 0.8

Pb Recovery 84% (-0.7333 (ZnOx/ZnT) + 0.9867)*100 40% 
Ag Recovery 56% (-0.4 (ZnOx/ZnT) + 0.64)*100 32%

Recent work completed by Votorantim has demonstrated that oxide and mixed material with higher 
oxide content can be processed, though at a lower recovery, and should be included as potential 
mining material in the inventory. Material processed at Florida Canyon will be made up of primarily 
sulfide and transition material. In SRK's opinion there is no need to exclude oxide material from 
consideration unless economics or further metallurgical and processing test results indicate that a 
specific ZnOx/ZnT cut-off should be used to restrict material input to processing. 

Two concentrate products will be produced, a lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate. The lead 
concentrate will contain payable amount of lead and silver. No payable silver content is expected in 
the zinc concentrate. 

As of the effective date of this report, metals pricing in US dollars is exhibiting relatively significant 
volatility. The spot zinc price has ranged between US$1.10/lb and US$1.33/lb over the past six months, 
spot lead price has ranged from US$0.89/lb to US$1.00/lb, and spot silver price has ranged from 
US$15.74/oz to US$18.56/oz. Long term analyst forecasts range from US$0.80/lb to US$1.38/lb, 
US$0.55/lb to US$0.96/lb, and US$10.94/oz to US$20.00/oz for zinc, lead and silver, respectively. For 
the purposes of stope optimization and defining potential mining blocks for further analysis in this 
study, pricing of US$1.20/lb Zn, US$1.00/lb Pb, and US$17.50/oz Ag has been used.  

The parameters used in the NSR calculation for stope optimization are summarized in Table 16-7. 
Note that these values may vary somewhat from those used in the final economic model. An NSR 
value was assigned to each block model block in Vulcan software. Blocks outside the modeled

wireframes, or with a zero grade, or with a classification of undefined have been assigned an NSR 
value of 0. 

The mineralized bodies outcrop in several areas. Underground mining in these near-surface zones is 
higher risk and may not be possible given the topography and environmental conditions. A 30 m buffer 
below topography was created, and the blocks within this buffer zone have been assigned an NSR 
value of 0 so that underground stopes shapes are not produced in these areas. The quantity of 
Measured, Indicated or Inferred material in the resource model above the NSR cut-off and above the 
30 m buffer is 151,000 t. Further study is required to determine if this material is minable using 
underground or surface methods.

 Operating Costs 
A number of technical studies have been completed on the project by both internal teams and external 
consultants. The production rate in these studies has ranged from 2,000 to 4,000 t/d. Considering the 
previous work and the geometry and size of the mineralized zones as they are currently known, a 
2,500 t/d production rate has been selected. Operating costs used in the determination of potential 
mining shapes are based on previous studies of the Florida Canyon project, estimating manuals, first 
principals, and comparing the Florida Canyon project with similar operations in Central and South 
America. Table 16-9 lists the operating costs used to determine potential mining shapes for Florida 
Canyon.

 Stope Optimization 
Potential mining blocks shapes were constructed using Maptek Vulcan's implementation of Alford 
Mining System's Stope Shape Optimizer (Stope Optimizer). NSR values were calculated using the 
parameters described in Section 16.3.1 for material classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred. All 
other blocks are assumed to be waste with NSR and grade values of zero. 

The mining method applicable to the San Jorge and SAM mineralized bodies is longhole stoping. 
Nominal level spacing in the longhole areas is 16 m from sill to sill. Potential mining shapes were 
allowed to have a minimum width of 3 m. Mining in these narrow areas would likely utilizing a resue 
mining technique to control dilution, and upon inspection of the resulting shapes there were few stopes 
at the minimum width in F1 and SAM. Both longitudinal stopes (stopes oriented along strike) and 
transverse stopes (oriented perpendicular to strike) exist in the mining zones. 

The mining methods applicable to the flat to moderate dipping areas is drift and fill and cut and fill. A 
minimum cut height of 3 m has been used with the potential mining blocks are oriented horizontally. 
SRK notes that in practice the mining cuts in the flat to shallow dipping areas will likely follow the 
footwall. That level of detailed design, however, is beyond the scope of this study and should be 
undertaken in subsequent PFS level study. 

Key parameters used for stope optimization are provided in Table 16-10.

The stope blocks output from Stope Shape Optimizer were visually inspected. Isolated blocks; i.e., 
small blocks far from larger groups of blocks or where additional development is not practical or 
economically feasible, were identified for removal from the mining block inventory. A small number of 
blocks were also removed in manto areas near the F1 longhole blocks. The blocks were removed due 
to the likelihood that mining induced stresses from exploitation of the nearby manto blocks would 
introduce stability issues in F1 zone. Figure 16-9 shows an example level section at 2044.5 elevation 
in the F1 area. Blocks flagged for removal are outlined in red. Approximately 273,000 t of material was

tonnes within the inventory.

The resource model was queried against the final stope optimization shapes to determine tonnes and 
grade of material inside the shapes, and mining dilution and recovery factors were applied in a 
spreadsheet. 

 Mining Recovery and Dilution 
The undiluted tonnes and grade of each potential mining block is based on the resource block model. 
Minable inventory tonnes and grade are calculated using the following factors: 

• Mining Recovery: a factor resulting in material loss (tonnage reduction) due to the mining 
method applied and the deposit geometry; and 

• Dilution: a factor resulting in a reduction of the overall average grade due to the mining of 
waste with the mineralized material. 

The generalized formula for calculating the reserve tonnage in each mining block is: 

Tinventory = Tmining block * Mining Recovery% * (1+Dilution%unplanned) 

The generalized formula for calculating the reserve grade is: 

Ginventory = Resource Grademining block / (1+Dilution%unplanned)

Recovery of 100% of the mineralized material within a mine design is rarely, if ever, achieved. Loss of 
mineralized material can be the result of: 

• Underbreak – the mineralized material is not blasted loose and remains in the stope walls; 
• Mineralized material loss within stope – the blasted mineralized material is left in the stope 

due to poor access for the loader, buried by falls of waste rock from walls, left on the floor, or 
material blasted but does not fall from flatter lying walls; and 

• Mineralized material left in pillars – loss due to leaving material behind to provide ground 
support. 

The mining recovery applied to the areas using the longhole method is 90%. Pillars with a height of 
16 m have been planned for every 96 m (six levels) of vertical excavation. It is assumed that 50% of 
these pillar levels will be able to be recovered on retreat. The mining recovery applied in the drift and 
fill and cut and fill areas is 95%. 

Dilution is defined as the ratio of waste to mineralized material above cut-off. There are two types of 
dilution that would be expected in the mine: internal, also called planned dilution; and external, also 
called unplanned dilution. 

• Internal or planned dilution occurs when material less than a cut-off grade falls within a 
designed stope boundary (i.e., it would be drilled and blasted within the stope during mining).  

Internal dilution is incorporated into the design when constructing shapes encompassing the 
material above cut-off. If the average grade of the stope falls too low when this material is 
incorporated into the stope, the stope should be redesigned to exclude more of this low-grade 
material. Judgment must be exercised during the stope optimization and/or design process to 
minimize dilution from this source, but practical mining considerations usually make the 
inclusion of internal dilution unavoidable. Internal dilution is straightforward to quantify in a 
mine plan using software to calculate tonnes and grade above and below the Net Smelter 
Return (NSR) cut-off within the designed stope blocks. 

• External or unplanned dilution is derived from low- or zero-grade material outside the stope 
design boundaries. This dilution is the result of over-break arising from poor drilling and 
blasting techniques, adverse geological structures, and failure within zones of weak rock. 

No additional external dilution has been applied to the Florida Canyon mining shapes. Internal dilution 
for the base case Florida Canyon scenario ranges from 13% to 73% and averages 34%. It is expected 
that a detailed design would likely reduce the overall average dilution. A detailed design, however, is 
beyond the scope of this study. 

 Cut-off Evaluation 
The NSR value of each potential mining block was calculated and evaluated against the NSR cut-off 
value for the particular mining method to be applied to the block. The NSR cut-off includes mining 
costs, processing costs, and general and administrative costs as described in Section 16.3.2. Mining 
blocks with an average NSR value above the NSR cut-off are included in the minable inventory. In 
some cases, marginal blocks, defined as blocks below the economic cut-off but above the sum of the 
cost of mining and processing, are included in the inventory if they are adjacent to economic blocks 
and it is reasonable to expect that no significant additional development would be required to extract

the marginal block. Mining blocks not meeting the criteria described above are classified as waste and 
excluded from the inventory. 

 Mining Methods 
Approximately 26% of the mining resource will be mined using longhole stoping in the SAM and F1 
areas with the remaining mined using mechanized drift and fill and cut and fill. Cemented paste fill and 
cemented rock fill will be used to backfill primary stopes. Mine development waste will be used in 
secondary stopes with some secondaries backfilled with low-content cemented paste fill where 
required. 

Longhole Stoping 

Sublevels in the longhole areas will be developed at 16 m intervals. Stopes less than 8 m wide will be 
mined longitudinally (along strike) with stopes greater than 8 m wide mined transversely (perpendicular 
to strike). Ramp, main haulage, and cross-cut development will be in the footwall. Haulage drifts have 
been offset from the stopes by 20 m. Sill development in the mineralized zones will provide access for 
drilling, blasting, ground support, and mucking. Blasthole drilling will be from the top sill using top 
hammer drills. Broken material will be mucked from the bottom of the stopes using remote controlled 
Load Haul Dump units (LHD). Typical blast patterns will be drilled using 2.5 m (burden) x 2.0 m 
(spacing) ring patterns. It is expected that water will be present requiring blastholes to be charged with 
ANFO/emulsion blends as required for water resistance. Cut and fill mining blocks exist in the 
hangingwall and footwall in the F1 area. Consideration for good ground control and the influence of 
mining induced stresses has an impact on the sequence of mining in these areas. The production 
schedule described in this study has mining occurring from the hangingwall to footwall with cut and fill 
blocks in the footwall mined on retreat. Figure 16-10 shows the F1 area and the proximity of cut and 
fill blocks to longhole blocks. Figure 16-11 shows a typical longhole level layout.

Drift and Fill, Cut and Fill 

Mining of shallow dipping (less than 27°) accounts for 70% of mine production. Mining cuts measuring 
4 m wide x a minimum 3 m high will be used to minimize dilution in thin areas. Stopes within a given 
manto or group of mantos will be developed from the bottom-up with each subsequent 3 m level 
developed above the mined-out and backfilled cut below. It will be possible to develop ramps and 
haulage drifts in the mineralized material where the dip of the mineralized zone allows a maximum 
12% gradient. Stopes will also be able to follow the grade of the footwall up to a maximum allowable 
gradient of 15%. An example drift and fill layout in the M10 manto is shown in Figure 16-12 with

Areas that require footwall waste development for stope block access will utilize access ramps with a 
maximum grade of 15%. Blocks of 12 to 16 m high will be mined using cuts of 3 to 4 m depending on 
the geometry of the mineralized material. Mining of cuts within a stope block will progress from the 
bottom to the top with lower cuts filled with cemented paste fill, cemented rock fill or development 
waste.  

Large karst caverns have been encountered during the excavation of the San Jorge adit, and karstic 
features have been observed in drilling. Additional geotechnical and hydrogeological information and 
study is required to better understand the potential impact on mining and risk mitigation measures that 
may be required to ensure a safe working environment. 

Mineralized material will be mucked using LHDs (4.5 to 6.5 m3), loaded onto 30 tonne trucks and 
hauled to the appropriate portal. The material will be crushed at the portal and transported to the 
processing facility via conveyor.

* NSR is calucalted using variable recoveries based on sulfide/oxide ratios (recovery ranging from 32%-93%), a Zn price of

The PEA is preliminary in nature, that it includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too 
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them 
to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. Mineral 
Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.

 Development Layout 
A development layout was created to provide access to the mining levels and to tie levels into ramps. 
Access to the underground workings will be via three main portals (San Jorge, P01 and P03). An 
additional portal (P02) will be used primarily for ventilation, and three additional drifts will daylight to 
facilitate ventilation. The only underground excavation that currently exists at the site is the San Jorge 
exploration adit. This adit will be utilized for access to the F1 area and surrounding cuts in the mantos. 
Dimensions of the San Jorge adit are currently 2.5 m x 3.5 m. This adit will need to be enlarged and 
ground support installed in the preproduction phase of the project. Production blocks in the central part 
of the project allow for the connection of the southern and northern areas via underground drifts and 
ramps. This underground connection will improve ventilation, will make the movement of personnel 
and equipment more efficient, and will allow for more flexibility in the production plan.

It is expected that development in the flat and shallow dipping mineralized zones will follow the footwall 
where the gradient of the drift can be less than 12%. Waste development in those areas will be limited 
to the primary access to the mining blocks and small connector drifts between larger blocks; for this 
study, only the primary access has been designed in these flat and shallow dipping areas. A more 
detailed level and ramp design was created for the more steeply dipping mantos, F1 and SAM areas. 
Cross-cuts are spaced 8 m apart on a level in transverse longhole stope areas, and 20 m cross-cut 
spacing is used in the transverse areas. Attack ramps in the mantos where development of ramps 
within the mineralization are typically 55 m or less and have a maximum gradient of 15%. 

The mine design assumptions are listed in Table 16-12.

An additional development allowance of 10% has been applied to the primary ramp, main haulage and 
level access drifts to account for turnouts, laydowns, and miscellaneous ventilation and ore pass 
development that will be required but was not designed in detail on each level. It is expected that raise 
boring will be contracted. Development quantities are presented in Table 16-13. 

Development has been classified as capital and operating. Capital waste development makes up the 
mine's long term and permanent infrastructure and includes primary ramps, level accesses, main 
haulage levels, ore passes, and ventilation raises. Operating waste development includes stope 
accesses and crosscuts. Three ventilation raises to surface are designed to ensure proper ventilation 
of four primary zones and the relatively large lateral extent of the project.

 Waste Rock Management and Backfilling 
Development waste excavated during the two-year pre-production period will be hauled to surface and 
used as construction materials; e.g., construction of the TSF embankment. This will allow stope mining 
to progress to a point where development waste can be placed underground. Additional development 
waste can be hauled to surface for construction materials where it is necessary and more cost effective 
than sourcing material on surface. Waste material has not been categorized in terms of its acid 
generating potential. It will be important in future studies to determine whether the waste material is 
potentially acid generating (PAG) and design storage or specify appropriate mitigation techniques 
should PAG material be encountered. 

Backfilling is an important part of the mine plan. Backfilling stopes provides for ground support, a 
working platform during mining, storage for tailings, and storage of waste rock with an associated 
shorter haul compared to storage on surface. A mix of material will be used to backfill stopes including 
cemented paste tailings, cemented rockfill, and RoM development waste. The cement content will vary 
based on the type of waste and where it will be placed. 

• Primary paste fill cement content: 6% by weight; 
• Primary rock fill cement content: 4% by weight; and  
• Secondary paste fill cement content (to prevent liquefaction): 2% by weight. 

It is assumed that 50% of the stopes are primaries and 50% are secondaries. The life-of-mine (LoM) 
backfill and cement quantities by type is shown in Table 16-15.

The total tailings sent to the TSF (i.e., Process tailing less tailing required for backfill) is 4,092,844 m3, 
based on an average dry density of 1.6 t/m3. 

16.4 Mine Production Schedule 
A production rate of 2,500 t/d has been selected to mine 912,500 mineralized tonnes per year. The 
mine will utilize two 12-hour shifts and operate 365 days per year. A two-year pre-production period is 
planned where mine development efforts will include enlarging of the San Jorge adit, development in 
the F1 area, and development in the north of the project area. Production will ramp up in schedule 
year 3 (production year 1) with an average daily mineralized material production rate of 2,005 t/d. 
Longhole, cut and fill, and drift and fill mining occur simultaneously. Longhole mining has been planned 
at a rate of 1,000 t/d and drift and fill/cut and fill mining will range from 1,500 to 2,500 t/d. Full production 
occurs in schedule years four through 14 (11 years of full production) with mining finished late in 
schedule year 15. Table 16-15 shows the Florida Canyon production schedule. It is illustrated in Figure 
16-19. SRK notes that there are likely opportunities to optimize the production schedule. Opportunities

include improved sequencing of high grade material and, potentially, a decrease in the pre-production 
timeframe. A more detailed design and schedule with corresponding trade-off studies, as well as more 
detailed construction timeframe estimates, would be required for the next phase of study.

16.5 Mine Services 

 Underground Mine Equipment 
Mine equipment selection is based on the mining methods employed, production requirements, 
expected number of open faces required to meet production, and development and stope dimensions. 
Double boom jumbos will be used for lateral development and single boom, low profile jumbos have 
been specified for drift and fill areas with cut heights of 3 m. LHDs with remote operating capabilities 
will be used for stope and development mucking and will load 30 t trucks. Table 16-16 provides a 
summary of the mining equipment.

 Electrical 
The underground mine will be supplied by power from the main Project substation. The main 
underground power will be used for the crushers located at the portals, jumbos, drills, ventilation, and 
electric pumps. Additionally, power will support auxiliary use in the shops and for smaller loads such 
as secondary fans, temporary pumps, and auxiliary lighting. 

 Ventilation 
A conceptual ventilation layout has been developed for this PEA study in order to estimate the number 
and location of ventilation openings to surface and to develop a cost estimate for ventilation. Additional 
detailed ventilation design is required in the next phase of study. 

Ventilation of the Florida Canyon project will be subdivided into four zones. The San Jorge adit and a 
raise to surface will be used to ventilate the southern sections, the F1 area, of the mine. Workings in 
the central and northern parts of the mine, the flat to moderate dipping mantos, will utilize the newly 
excavated decline, a ventilation portal, and two raises to surface. The SAM area is largely isolated 
from the rest of the network and will be ventilated via its portals and ventilation drifts that daylight on 
surface. The northwestern part of the mine will be ventilated via a raise and ventilation drift daylighting 
on the surface. 

Based on the equipment list SRK estimated airflow requirements using some general assumptions of 
average power and utilization. The airflow requirement is based on 125 cfm per brake horsepower 
(bhp) which is a commonly used rule-of-thumb value for this type of preliminary estimate. The number

of personnel underground were estimated and airflow calculates used 55 cfm/person. A utilization 
percentage for equipment has not been used for airflow calculations and would reduce the required 
airflow. The estimated airflow requirement by zone are shown in Table 16-17 through Table 16-19 at 
typical production in the given zone.

 Mine Personnel 
Required mine personnel has been estimated based on production requirements, equipment selection, 
guidance from estimating manuals, and data from similar operations in production in Central and South 
America. The mine will utilize two 12-hour shifts and operate 365 days per year. Production personnel 
will be housed at the camp while on shift and will work a two week on/two week off rotation. Four crews 
will be required with two crews on site at any given time. Management and technical staff will work 4 
day on/3 day off schedule. Table 16-20 lists the hourly and salaried personnel on site at any given 
time.

 Health and Safety 
The mine will have a communications system that has both mine phones and wireless communication 
through a leaky feeder system. A stench gas emergency warning system will be installed in the mine's 
intake ventilation system. This system can be activated to warn underground employees of a fire 
situation or other emergency whereupon emergency procedures will be followed. Typically, two means 
of egress from a working area are designed or use of a portable refuge station is assumed.

17.2 Processing Methods and Flow Sheet 
Because the challenging topography and road conditions, trucking Run-of-Mine (ROM) material would 
demand a lengthy route from the underground portals to the plant's location. Instead, SRK has 
designed a set of conventional overland conveyors with a maximum slope of 20° to simplify the 
operation and significantly reduce the cost of transferring mill feed from the mine portals to the process 
plant. A portable, 75 hp primary jaw crusher is to be installed at each underground mine portal to 
ensure the ROM is adequately sized for the conveying system. Planned overland conveying from the 
underground mine portals to the process plant is shown in Table 17-2. 

Given the location of the deposit, it is anticipated three underground portals will be producing mill feed 
at any given time, and at different rates as presented in Table 17-2. 

• The existing Portal San Jose is expected to produce in average 30% of the mill feed, 
equivalent to 750 t per day that is transferred to the overland conveyor at Portal 03 using a 
297 m long conveyor. 

• Approximately 60% of the mill feed will be produced through the new Portal 01 equivalent to 
1,500 t per day and distant 840 m along the overland conveyor. 

• The new Portal 03 will produce approximately 10% of the mill feed at an average of 250 t/d 
and will be transferred to the process plant area using a 1,855 m long conveyor. 

Specifications for overland conveying are provided in Table 17-2.

Crushed material produced by the primary jaw crushers is transferred to a 2,500 t silo located at the 
process plant area. A secondary-tertiary crushing plant using 150 hp cone crushers in closed-circuit 
with vibrating screens will reduce the mill feed to approximately 80% passing 12 mm. The product from 
the crushing plant will be transferred to a mill feed silo (fine ore silo) capable of holding 2,500 t. 

The single stage 1,800 kW conventional ball mill operating in closed-circuit with a classification screen 
will produce a product sizing approximately 80% minus 44 microns that will feed the differential flotation 
stage. 

The flotation will have two multi-stage flotation circuits, the first will produce a lead concentrate. The 
second multi-stage flotation circuit, the zinc circuit, receives tails from the lead circuit to produce a zinc 
concentrate. Both final concentrates will be transferred to its respective thickeners and then filtered 
(10 m2 filtration area for lead concentrate, and 60 m2 filtration area for zinc concentrate) to 
approximately 9% moisture before being trucked offsite to smelters.  

Tailings from the flotation plant will be thickened to approximately 50% solids by weight. A fraction of 
the tails representing approximately 60% of the solids will be piped to a filtration plant (600 m2 tails 
filtration area) located by the tailings storage area and then dry stacked at a moisture of approximately 
17% by weight. Water recovered in the tails filter will be recycled to the process plant. The remaining 
40% of the solid's stream will be transferred to a backfill plant to be used in the underground operation. 

The PEA flow sheet for Florida Canyon mineral processing is shown in Figure 17-1. 

17.3 Consumables Requirement 
The power requirements for the projected milling operation is estimated at maximum 3.5 MW. Power 
for milling operations will be supplied by a third-party as line power at an estimated cost of 
US$0.084/kWh.  

The water requirement for the mill at a capacity of 2,500 t/d is estimated at maximum 20 liters per 
second. Water for processing will be acquired from surface water sources and as recycled water from 
tailings dewatering operations.  

All the consumables will be supplied by road from Lima port and stored in the mill complex. It is 
estimated that storing 5 days of consumption will ensure continuous supply to the operation. Typical 
flotation reagents include: Lime, NaCN, Zn Sulfate, Sodium Isopropyl Xanthate, Aerophine 3418, 
MIBC, Cu Sulfate, Sodium Isopropyl Xanthate (Z11), MIBC, and flocculants. Grinding media (steel 
balls) could arrive via Lima port, or alternatively on trucks from northern Chile.

18 Project Infrastructure 
18.1 Infrastructure and Logistics Requirements 

 Access and Local Communities 
Florida Canyon is a greenfield site with minimal infrastructure currently available. The operation is 
located in north central Peru (Figure 18-1) approximately 700 km north of the (capital, Lima. The 
Project is in a sparsely populated area approximately 39 km northwest of Pedro Luis Gallo (population 
approximately 3,000), the largest town with any infrastructure near the Project. There are several 
smaller communities located nearer to the proposed operation, but they have no developed 
infrastructure to support the project. A camp for employees and contractors will be required.

Access to the site is by paved road from Chiclayo (population approximately 740,000) located on the 
Pacific coast approximately 380 km to the west of Pedro Ruiz Gallo. A dirt road connects Pedro Ruiz 
with the district capitol of Shipasbamba where the project office and core storage facility is located. A 
26 km newly constructed road connects Shipasbamba to the project area. This existing section of road 
will require upgrade to support construction and Project logistics including concentrate transport. 
Approximately 24 km of new road at the site will be required to allow access to the facilities and 
infrastructure. Figure 18-2 shows the new roads in the highlighted area near the Project. New road 
construction is in fairly rugged topography in an area of high rainfall that will require construction during 
the drier months to be efficient.

 Site Water Management 
The operation will require water for use for processing, mining, dust suppression and potable 
consumption. The processing facility will utilize recycled water from the tailings facility and rainfall shed 
from the tailings for the majority of the processing needs. It is anticipated that there will be some ground 
water that will be encountered in the mine and captured in sumps and decantation basins for mine 
water needs. 

Tesoro Creek, a small local drainage, has been used for domestic water supply by nearby residents. 
Clean water from this creek will be used for make-up process water, for fire suppression and for

domestic requirements. It will be piped by gravity from the creek to a water storage tank. A small 
treatment plant will be utilized for potable water needs for the Project camp and other support areas.  

Surface water control is discussed in the tailings Section 18.3. 

 Project Facilities 
The project support infrastructure is shown in Figure 18-3. The facilities include the processing plant 
and associated infrastructure, mining infrastructure with portals, vent holes, road access to portals, 
tailings storage area, and support infrastructure including fuel storage, security, camp, power supply 
and distribution, and water supply and storage. Waste rock will be consumed in the construction of the 
tailings embankment so no separate waste rock storage is required.

Mine Operations and Support Facilities 

The production-related project elements include a mine office, mine dry, and mine maintenance shops 
near the plant location to support the underground operations. Additional detail is included in Section 
16. The mining method selected for the underground operation will require backfill consisting of 
cemented paste and waste rock, both cemented and unconsolidated. The capital cost of a paste 
backfill plant and operating cost of distribution is included in the economics for the Project. An 
allowance for a small cemented rock fill plant is also provided for two production periods when 
cemented rock fill is required for secondary stopes. 

Process Support Facilities 

The infrastructure at the process facilities include the plant, mill feed stockpile, secondary crusher, 
supply conveyors, primary crushers at the portals and an office/maintenance building. The plant 
facilities are discussed in Section 17. 

Additional Support Facilities 

The Project requires a camp to support the operation as it is remote. A 400-person camp with a 
cafeteria and recreation center will be required. Additional support facilities include a rescue and first 
aid building, warehouse, health/safety/environmental office, security gate house, truck scale, truck 
wash, laboratory, septic, and incinerator system. Two 50,000 liter fuel tanks and associated pump 
facilities will store fuel for use by the Project. 

 Power Supply and Distribution 
There is currently no substantive line power near the site. SRK considered a diesel-powered generator 
option for power supply. However, a third-party supplier, Energoret S.A.C, has a hydropower 
generation and transmission development project that will be located in close proximity to the mine. 
The Energoret system will generate 20 MW of power from a plant on a tributary to the Utcubamba 
River. Energoret indicates that half of the project, approximately 10 MW, has already been committed. 
The plant is designed to provide power to the city of Bagua Grande, west of their project, and to Pedro 
Ruiz to the east of the Project. Energoret indicates that it will invest in a transmission line to the Florida 
Canyon mine site and a substation on site. Their capital estimate is US$25 million. Figure 18-4 shows 
the location of Energoret's proposed hydroelectric plant, distribution lines to Bagua Grande and Pedro 
Ruiz as well as an extension to the Florida Canyon Project. The layout of the proposed system is 
shown in Figure 18-4 with the high voltage transmission lines delineated by the blue and white dotted 
line. 

Neither Votorantim nor Solitario have entered into definitive negotiations with Energoret at this stage 
of study. Based on discussions with Energoret SRK estimated a power cost charge that would recover 
the capital expense for 6 MW of capacity of the plant plus the cost of transmission lines and a 
substation over the current 13 year life of the project including a risk premium and profit on both the 
capital and the operating costs. The estimated operating cost of power is US$0.084/kWhr. 

SRK also included in the estimated capital cost for the project including a medium voltage power 
switchgear and 2.3 km of distribution lines to the processing plant and portals.

SRK has considered shipping to the ports at Paita, Chiclayo (Pimental), and Lima (Callao) as well as 
direct shipping to Votorantim's Cajamarquilla Smelter near Lima. A high level trade-off study of 
concentrate transportation was prepared by SRK considering truck haulage, capital cost for additional 
port and/or handling facilities, and ocean freight/handling charges. This study indicated that the direct 
shipping option to Cajamarquilla was most cost effective. Figure 18-6 shows the locations of ports and 
the Cajamarquilla smelter.

18.3 Tailings Management  
The tailings storage facility (TSF) will be located in the valley to the south of the process plant as 
shown in Figure 18-3. The tailings will be filtered at the plant site to a "dry stack" condition (i.e. typical 
moisture content less than 20%). From the plant site, tailings will be transported to the TSF via overland 
conveyors.  



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

Approximately 6.56 Mt of dry stack tailings will be will be produced over life of the mine and will have 
a final surface area of 266,400 m2. The TSF basin will be lined with 2 mm geomembrane. 
Approximately 1 m of topsoil will be excavated from the embankment and basin footprint and stockpiled 
for use during closure. All tailings not placed in the TSF will be utilized as backfill in the mine. 

The TSF starter dam will be keyed into native ground approximately 4.5 m. The dam will have with a 
slope of 2:1 Horizontal:Vertical (H:V) and will be constructed of waste rock from underground and 
residual soils from the tailings basin. Additional raises will be constructed via an upstream method 
using waste rock or blasted rock from the tailings basin to construct the upstream containment berms. 
The upstream containment berms will have an overall slope of 3:1 H:V. Tailings will be placed using 
mobile mining equipment at a slope of 4:1 H:V. Upstream construction is suitable for this seismic 
environment because the tailings have been dewatered and will be compacted as they are placed. 

An upstream diversion will be constructed to manage stormwater during operations and convey it 
downstream to be released beyond the toe of the dam. This diversion will consist of a 2 m deep and 
5 m wide channel cut into native ground and lined with 300 mm rip rap.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or 
Community Impact  

20.1 Required Permits and Status 

 Required Exploration Permits and Status 
Environmental permits for mineral exploration programs are divided into two classes. Class I permits 
allow construction and drilling for up to 20 platforms with a maximum disturbance of 10 ha. A Class II 
permit provides for more than 20 drill locations or for a disturbance area of greater than 10 ha.  

Class I permits require little more than a notification process for approval. Class II drilling permits 
require an environmental impact declaration (DIA), a permit for harvesting trees (if applicable), an 
archeological survey report (CIRA), a water use permit (ALA) and a Closure Plan.  

Votorantim has previously filed applications for and received Class II permits for various phases of the 
Project and has filed and received the required associated permits. The 2017 review of existing 
exploration permit status indicates that only the archeological permits and the latest tree harvesting 
permit are still valid. 

During exploration, Votorantim has developed a Social Management Plan with several programs 
ongoing in the community including: 

• Communication, Information and Coordination Program with Residents; 
• Attention to Concern, Claims and Conflict Resolution Program; 
• Support Program for Participatory Environmental Monitoring and Information Workshops; 
• Recruitment and Training Program for Local Labor; 
• Support Program for Sustainable Socioeconomic Development; and 
• Community Support Program in Education and Training. 

 Required Mining Permits  
Permitting requirements for mining include an Estudio de Impacto Ambiental (EIA) that describes in 
detail the mining plan and evaluates the impacts of the plan on environmental and social attributes of 
the property. Baseline studies include air quality, surface and groundwater quality, flora and fauna 
surveys, archeological surveys and a study of the social conditions of the immediate property and an 
area of interest that includes local communities. Many of the baseline studies required for mining have 
been completed by Votorantim. Public meetings are required in order that local community members 
can learn about and comment on the proposed operation. Social outreach has been clearly 
demonstrated during Votorantim's exploration efforts as described above. 

Specific authorizations, permits and licenses required for future mining include: 
• EIA (as modified during the mine life); 
• Mine Closure Plan and Final Mine Closure Plan within two years of end of operation; 
• Certificate of Nonexistence of Archaeological Remains; 
• Water Use License (groundwater and/or surface water); 
• Water construction authorization; 
• Sewage authorization; 
• Drinking water treatment facility license;

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

• Explosives use license and explosives storage licenses; 
• Controlled chemicals certificate; 
• Beneficiation concession; 
• Mining authorization; 
• Closure bonding; and 
• Environmental Management Plan approval. 

Information on environmental monitoring was limited in the SRK document review. Nevertheless, the 
need for additional monitoring in at least one dry and one wet period will be required for the EIA 
including terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora and groundwater level and quality. 

20.2 Environmental Monitoring Results 
Environmental monitoring has been performed per the requirements to obtain the exploration permits, 
including the variables listed in the Table 20-1.

Information that SRK was able to review in the database was limited. Nevertheless, the need for 
additional monitoring in at least one dry and one wet period will be required for the EIA-d including 
terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora and groundwater level and quality.  

20.3 Groundwater 

Groundwater has been studied by Hydro-Geo Consultores (2010) and Klohn Crippen Berger (2013). 
SRK reviewed these studies in context of underground mining. The mine is located in a high rainfall 
environment. Infiltration of surface water persists to approximately 50 m depth and recharges 
groundwater via structural pathways and interconnected karst features in dolomitized and de-
dolomitized carbonate stratigraphy. The potentiometric surface has been determined by a series of 
piezometers. This groundwater surface follows the south-southwest flow direction of Florida Canyon 
and daylights at the river level in the canyon. Most of the planned mining of the flat mantos will occur 
above the water table. Steeper zones of mineralization, such as San Jorge and Sam will occur below 
the water table as will parts of the Karen Milagros mantos to the north. Local inflows may be 
encountered when crossing faults or intercepting karst features. 

Impact to groundwater is expected to be minimal as underground surface exposures are minor and 
exposed sulfides are not acid generating. There are no groundwater wells required for processing or 
potable water supply. These needs will be met by surface water available from nearby Tesoro Creek. 

20.4 Environmental Issues 
The proposed underground mining operation is expected to have a small disturbance footprint 
compared to other mining methods. Waste rock from underground mining will be crushed and 
conveyed to the tailing storage facility (TSF) for use in construction of the tailings embankment. A 
small percentage of the waste rock will be used as underground backfill. As a result, there will be little 
or no surface area disturbance related to waste rock placement. 

Waste rock generated from the mine and used in the tailings facility construction is composed of 
limestone and dolomite with a high neutralizing capacity. Most waste rock very low sulfide content so 
the potential for acid generation and metals leach is judged to be low. Nevertheless waste rock 
characterization study is recommended for future work. 

The primary area of surface disturbance is related to tailings placement. As shown in Figure 18-3, the 
final tailings placement will have an area of 23.5 ha. Tailings also require geotechnical and 
geochemical stabilization during placement and closure. Tailings are predicted to have low amounts 
of iron sulfide and to be geochemically stable with respect to acid rock drainage. There is also 
substantial neutralization capacity in the carbonate host rocks to mitigate acid generation. Residual 
lead and zinc sulfides have low acid-generating capacity; however, they are subject to metal leaching 
and therefore require compaction during placement to minimize water infiltration. The closure plan to 
stabilize tailings is described later in this section of the report. 

Water for processing is expected to be collected from surface streams and reclaimed from filtered 
tailings. There will be no need for groundwater consumption in the current processing plan. 
Groundwater will be intersected in deeper reaches of the underground mine. Most of this water will be 
used for dust suppression or piped to the mill to support comminution and flotation.

20.5 Mine Closure 
A conceptual closure plan was developed to facilitate the calculation of the reclamation and closure 
costs to include in the PEA economic analysis. Closure designs and costs are based primarily on 
closure actions typically performed at similar sites. 

 

20.3.1 Post Mining Land Use 
Closure Design Objectives 

• Promote positive and controlled drainage off the tailings surface and away from the dam face; 
• Maintain an erosional and geotechnically stable landform; 
• Promote native vegetation growth on the tailings surface, and 
• Create a closed facility that minimizes long-term monitoring and maintenance. 

20.3.2 Portals and Vents 
Closure Design Objectives 

• Prevent public access to underground workings. 
• Maintain an erosional and geotechnically stable landform. 
• Create a landform that visually approximates the surrounding landscape. 
• Promote native vegetation growth on the disturbed surface. 
• Create a closed facility that minimizes long-term monitoring and maintenance. 

Closure Tasks 

• Portals and vents will be decommissioned by filling with waste rock or capping with a concrete 
bulkhead. Disturbed areas will be revegetated with native species. 

20.3.3 Buildings and Infrastructure 
Closure Design Objectives 

• Remove any facilities not needed for future use. 
• Maintain an erosional and geotechnically stable landform. 
• Create a landform that visually approximates the surrounding landscape. 
• Promote native vegetation growth on disturbed surfaces. 
• Create a closed facility that minimizes long-term monitoring and maintenance. 

Closure Tasks 

• Buildings with no identified post-mining land use will be demolished and the debris will be 
hauled to the permitted landfill onsite. 

• Mill and conveyor parts with useful remaining life will be removed from the site and sold. The 
rest of the structure will be demolished and recyclable materials hauled offsite and the rest 
hauled to the permitted landfill onsite.

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

20.3.4 Roads and Miscellaneous Disturbance 
Closure Design Objectives 

• Maintain an erosional and geotechnically stable landform. 
• Create a landform that visually approximates the surrounding landscape. 
• Promote native vegetation growth on the disturbed surface. 
• Create a closed facility that minimizes long-term monitoring and maintenance. 

Closure Tasks 

• Roads not needed for an identified post-mining land use will be regraded to approximately 
original contours and revegetated with native plant species. 

• The main access roads and some internal mine roads may remain. Roads might be 
reconstructed to be smaller in width and include water control features to prevent erosion of 
the road bed. 

• Miscellaneous disturbance around other facilities will be regraded to approximately original 
contours and revegetated with native plant species. 

20.3.5 Tailings Facility 
Closure Design Objectives 

• Promote positive and controlled drainage off the tailings surface and away from the dam face. 
• Maintain an erosional and geotechnically stable landform. 
• Promote native vegetation growth on the tailings surface. 
• Create a closed facility that minimizes long-term monitoring and maintenance. 

Closure Tasks 

The tailings dam face will be constructed of waste rock at either 2:1H:V or 3:1 H:V. As long as 
stormwater is directed away from the dam face and the slopes are not changed from design the facility 
will be erosionally and geotechnically stable. No further reclamation will be performed. Tailings 
operations and closure involve: 

• During operations, at the end of mine-life, deposit tails such that the surface slopes up to 1% 
toward the center of the tailings; 

• Place 0.5 m of growth media on the tailings surface; 
• Construct a stormwater channel in the center of the tailings to convey water to the southwest 

corner upstream from the dam into native ground; 
• Construct a stormwater channel in native ground from the southwest corner of the tailings 

surface to spill into the natural drainage to the south; 
• Decommission the stormwater drain on the north side of the tailings facility and direct flow 

onto the tailings surface to be captured by the center stormwater ditch; and 
• Revegetate the tailings surface. 

20.6 Post Closure Plans 
Post mining land use will approximate a natural park setting which could be used for livestock grazing 
and visually appears like the surrounding landscape. Generally, disturbed areas will be physically 
reclaimed and revegetated to approximate surrounding landforms. Disturbed areas will also be

revegetated with native species. Some facilities may remain in place to support future access for 
exploration and/or further mineral development. 

SRK recommends in future studies to design the tailings surface and spillway stormwater structure 
and evaluate options to reduce or eliminate the long-term obligation for monitoring and maintenance. 

20.7 Reclamation and Closure Cost Estimate 
Closure costs were calculated using the Standardized Reclamation Cost Estimator (SRCE) 2.0. The 
SRCE is a spreadsheet model that uses a first principles approach to calculate lengths, areas and 
volumes of common mine facilities and apply productivities for common mine equipment to estimate 
the time required. Unit costs for labor, materials and equipment are then applied to estimate a total 
cost. 

Unit costs were as follows: 

• Labor costs were factored from Nevada labor used by the Nevada Division of Environmental 
Protection (NDEP) for financial surety by multiplying by 40%; 

• Equipment and material costs were used without factoring from the NDEP costs used for 
financial surety; and 

• A fuel cost of US$1.24 per liter was used from the PEA documentation. 

Closure cost includes provision for General and Administrative, closure planning and engineering and 
staff oversite during the active closure. Provision is also included for monitoring and maintenance. 

The estimated cost to close the mine is US$4,919,935 which will be spent over the two years following 
the end of mining. An additional long term monitoring and maintenance expense of US$829,835 will 
be required spread over 50 years starting in 2034. The total estimated closure cost is US$5,749,770. 

20.8 Post-Performance or Reclamations Bonds 
Reclamation bonds have not yet been defined or posted for the project. 

20.9 Social and Community 
From the social point of view, the Florida Canyon Project is developed on lands of the Community of 
Shipasbamba, located in the district of the same name, in the province of Bongará in the department 
of Amazonas. This community was registered in the Directory of Peasant Communities by R.S. 49 on 
December 17, 1959 (220 families). 

In order to develop its exploration work, Votorantim Metais (VM) – Cajamarquilla S.A., has signed with 
the CC of Shipasbamba, biannual agreements from 2009 to 2017 for the use of 12,500 ha. In summary, 
VM - Cajamarquilla has performed the following actions with the: 

Government 

• Comply with the requirements demanded by the sector to obtain the necessary environmental 
permits to carry out its exploration activities. 

• In this context, it has developed several Citizen Participation Mechanisms in which the 
population has been informed about the objectives and scope of the Project and the type of 
relationship with the community that will be developed through its Community relations office.

21 Capital and Operating Costs  
As part of the Florida Canyon valuation exercise, SRK prepared an estimate of both capital and 
operating costs associated with the designed mineable resources production schedule. This section 
of the report presents and details these estimates of Capital Expenditure and Operating Expenditure. 
All estimates are based on yearly inputs of physicals and all financial data is second quarter 2017 and 
currency is in U.S. dollars (US$), unless otherwise stated. 

The use of "ore" in the summary of tables of this PEA is a relative mineable material estimated. Ore, 
by definition, can only be ascribed to economic mineralization supported by Mineral Reserves. 

21.1 Capital Cost Estimates 
The Florida Canyon Project is a green field lead-zinc deposit and the estimate of capital includes both 
an estimate of initial capital investment to install and commission the mine and a sustaining capital to 
maintain the equipment and expanding any supporting infrastructure necessary to continue running 
the project until the end of the projected production schedule. The estimate of capital was broken down 
into the following main areas:  

• Mining areas access development and vent raises; 
• Underground Mining Equipment; 
• Surface crushing and conveying systems; 
• Offsite Infrastructure; 
• Site Facilities; 
• Process Plant; 
• Power Supply; 
• Water Supply; 
• Backfill Infrastructure; 
• Cement Rockfill Infrastructure; 
• Tailings Storage Facility; 
• Owner's Cost; and 
• Closure and Post-Closure Monitoring. 

The capital cost estimates developed for this study comprise the costs associated with the engineering, 
procurement, construction and commissioning required for all items. The cost estimate was based 
SRK's experience with similar projects installed in the region or estimates of cost specifically prepared 
for the project under a first principles basis. The work indicates that the project will require an initial 
capital of US$213.7 million and a sustaining capital of US$81.9 million Table 21-1 summarizes the 
estimate of capital.

 Basis for Capital Cost Estimates 
The cost associated with mining area access development and the construction of vent raises was 
based on the preparation of a mineable resources production schedule that included a design of 
meters of development and meters of vent raises, these were combined with the following unit costs 
to result in the cost estimate: 

• Development: US$1,500/m; and 
• Vent Raises: US$2,200/m. 

These unit costs are based on data from comparable underground mines also located in Peru or other 
South American areas with similar mining conditions. 

A schedule of acquisition of underground mining equipment specific to the production schedule was 
prepared, Table 21-2 presents the unit costs and acquisitions of these equipment.

The process plant cost estimate is based on data from similar flotation plants with the same capacity 
and same region. This investigation resulted in an estimate of about US$60 million. 

The cost associated with the required surface crushing and conveying was based on required 
distances and elevation gain to cover. These include the movement of mineralized material from three 
mine portals to the plant feed area and some waste material that will be used to build the embankment 
for the tailings storage facility. This investigation resulted in an estimate of around US$1.4 million. 

Offsite-infrastructure, site infrastructure, power supply, water supply and backfill infrastructure cost 
estimates were prepared based the required structures costs from comparable operations. It should 
be noted that this study assumes that a third-party is planning to build a hydro power plant that will 
provide power to the project. A company has approached Solitario to offer this option, including the 
construction of the transmission line and project substation. Table 21-3 summarizes the basis of these 
cost estimates.

Cement will be added to underground waste rock and used to fill designated primary fill areas, this will 
be done by underground installed facilities that are estimated to cost roughly US$200,000.  

SRK prepared a design for a dry stack tailings storage facility to contain all the filtered tailings 
generated by the lead and zinc concentrates production. The cost estimate included the preparation 
of a stage construction using borrow material from the underground mine and construction area. This 
resulted in a total cost of US$24.7 million, which is split US$12.9 million initial capital and 
US$11.8 million sustaining capital. The relevant section of this report contains more details about this 
tailings storage facility design. 

Closure costs were estimated by SRK as US$4.9 million for the actual closure and about US$830,000 
for post closure site monitoring. Details of this estimate can be found in the relevant section of this 
report. 

Other capital cost estimates include the following: 

• Owner's cost: Estimate of about 10% of initial capital, excluding development and vent raises; 
• Sustaining Capital: 2% of initial capital, excluding development, vent raises and owner's costs; 

and 
• Contingencies: 25% contingencies were applied to initial capital, excluding development and 

vent raises and owner's costs.  

21.2 Operating Cost Estimates 
SRK prepared the estimate of operating costs for the associated mineable resources production 
schedule. These costs were subdivided into the following categories:  

• Mining Operating Expenditure; 
• Processing Operating Expenditure; and 
• G&A Operating Expenditure. 

The resulting LoM cost estimate is presented in Table 21-4.

 Basis for Operating Cost Estimates 
The prepared estimates that compose the operating costs consist of domestic and international 
services, equipment, labor, etc. Where required, the following were included: 

• Value added tax; 
• Freight; and 
• Duty.

No specific work schedule has been defined for the mine, plant and site operations. 

All of the operating cost estimates are based on the quantities associated with the production schedule, 
including the following: 

• Run of Mine; 
• Primary and Secondary Backfill; and 
• Plant Feed. 

Unit costs from similar projects in the same region or in the Americas, adjusted for labor and 
consumables differences, were used to estimate the LoM operating costs. All operating costs include 
supervision staff, operations labor, maintenance labor, consumables, electricity, fuels, lubricants, 
maintenance parts and any other operating expenditure identified by contributing engineers. The 
following unit costs were used to calculate the operating costs: 

• Underground Mining: US$ 15.30/t-RoM; 
• Primary Cement Rockfill: US$22.18/m3; 
• Primary Cement Pastefill: US$26.23/m3; 
• Secondary Cement Pastefill: US$18.13/m3; and 
• Processing: US$12.00/t-Feed. 

General and Administration costs were considered as 10% of the other operating costs, which resulted 
in a unit rate of US$3.50/t-RoM.

22 Economic Analysis  
The financial results presented here are based on annual inputs from the production schedule 
prepared by SRK. All financial data is second quarter 2017 and currency is in U.S. dollars (US$), 
unless otherwise stated. 

22.1 External Factors 
Florida Canyon does not hold contracts for the provision of its products. The costs and discounts 
associated with the sales of the products are based on recent information from similar operations. This 
study was prepared under the assumption that the project will sell the following products. 

• Lead concentrate; and 
• Zinc concentrate; 

It was also considered that the lead concentrate also contains payable amounts of silver. 

Assumed prices are based on current market spot prices. Table 22-1 presents the prices used in the 
cashflow model, which were also used for mineable resource calculations.

It was assumed that zinc concentrates will be trucked to the Cajamarquilla smelter owned by 
Votorantim near Lima, Peru. Lead concentrates will be trucked to the Port of Callao near Lima and 
shipped overseas to a lead smelter. It was assumed that the concentrates will have an average 
moisture content of 8%. Table 22-3 presents the calculated transportation costs considered for each 
product.

22.2 Main Assumptions 
Common prices for consumables, labor, fuel, lubricants and explosives were used by all engineering 
disciplines to derive capital and operating costs. Included in the labor costs are shift differentials, 
vacation rotations, all taxes and the payroll burdens. All currency is in U.S. dollars (US$) unless 
otherwise stated.  

The pre-production period was estimated to be two years. This should be enough to develop access 
to mining areas, install and commission the plant and site infrastructure. Mine production is based on 
an average assumed LoM mine material movement of 2,358 t-ore/d (365 days/yr basis). The mine 
schedule does not include stockpiling as all blending of run of mine (RoM) is done in the mine. Table 
22-4 presents the LoM mine assumptions.

The average mill feed is also 2,358 t/d (365 days/yr basis) over the LoM. The mill feed has an average 
head grade of 11.3 g/t Ag, 0.90% Pb and 8.34% Zn. The processing circuit is designed to recover a 
lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate, the lead concentrate also contains payable amounts of silver. 
Table 22-5 presents the projected LoM plant production.

22.3 Taxes, Royalties and Other Interests 
The analysis of the Florida Canyon Project includes a total of 30% of income taxes over taxable 
income. Losses carried forward are used when possible, limited to 50% of profits. A depreciation 
schedule was calculated by SRK assuming a ten-year straight line depreciation.  

The Project includes payment of two types of governmental royalties, the first called a mining royalty 
and the second called a special mining tax. Both royalties are calculated as a rate depending on the 
ratio between the Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) and the Net Revenue. This rate is applied 
on top of the EBIT, with the difference that the mining royalty can be replaced by a minimum rate of 
1% over the net revenue, in case this 1% is higher than the mining royalty rate over the EBIT. The 
rates for each royalty are presented in Table 22-6.

22.4 Results 
The valuation results of the Florida Canyon Project indicate that the Project has a potential present 
value of approximately US$198 million, with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 25%, based on an 8% 
discount rate. The operation will have two years of negative free cash flow, as it has to be constructed 
in this period. Even with some of the capital spent in the first year of operation, it is projected that this 
year will have a positive free cash flow. This economic analysis indicates that the investment payback 
should occur 2. 6 years from the start of the commercial production. The estimate free cash flow of the 
project is presented in Figure 22-1.

Indicative economic results are presented in Table 22-7, the table evidences that zinc is responsible 
for the clear majority of the revenue generation and the underground mining cost is the heaviest burden 
on the operation, followed by the mineral processing cost as a far second.

The Florida Canyon project is mainly a zinc project, as this metal represents roughly 90% of the total 
projected revenue. The remainder of the revenue is related to lead and silver, where both these metals 
are by-products, as none represent a minimum of 20% of the revenue projection. Figure 22-2 presents 
the revenue broken down by each metal.

Project cash costs are reported under an equivalent zinc production. All-in costs for zinc, including 
initial and sustaining capital costs, are estimated at US$0.73/Zn-lb. Considering byproduct credits for 
lead and silver, all-in zinc cost is US$0.47/Zn-lb. Table 22-9 presents the composition of the Florida 
Canyon cash costs.

Figure 22-4: Florida Canyon NPV Sensitivity to Hurdle Rate 

 

A sensitivity analysis on variation of Project costs, both capital and operating, and metal prices 
indicated that the cash generating is mostly sensitive to the reduction of metal prices, or possibly loss 
on metal recovery, and secondly to the increase of capital costs. A chart of typical sensitivities is 
provided in Figure 22-5.

22.6 Conservative Metal Price Alternative Analysis 
The owners requested SRK to evaluate the Florida Canyon Project under a specific alternate metal 
price structure. This forecast includes a new set of long term metal prices, which are considerably 
lower than current spot metal prices for zinc and lead. The alternative pricing is presented in Table 
22-10.

Silver 18.91 US$/oz 
Lead 0.88 US$/lb 
Zinc 1.06 US$/lb

The owners also asked that for these market conditions the project be evaluated with a higher discount 
rate of 9%. 

Only these metal prices and the discount rate were changed in this alternative valuation. Other inputs 
and estimates were maintained the same as the base case, including: 

• Mineable Resources; 
• Process Recoveries;

• On-Site and Off-Site Operating Costs; 
• Capital Costs; and 
• Net Smelter Terms. 

 Impact to Mine Planning 
SRK investigated the impact of using the more conservative economic inputs on mine planning, 
specifically, the NSR calculation. Using the new NSR calculation and applying it to the mine plan 
resource presented in this document, has the effect of lowering the overall average NSR by 23%. 
Overall, the revenue generated from the mine plan resource is 77% of the original assumptions. 

Figure 22-6 shows the mine plan resource, colored by the sensitivity NSR (US$/t). The economic cut-
off is approximately US$40/t-NSR. Dark blue mining areas in the figure are now below cut-off and light 
blue areas are marginal. Using the sensitivity NSR, when all areas are combined, the mine plan is still 
economic. Given these new sensitivity inputs, the mine plan could be optimized to eliminate the un-
economic material and minimize the amount of marginal material in the mine plan.

 Impact to Economics 
The valuation of these alternate market assumptions is estimated to yield a net present value of 
US$106.1 million. The free cash flow project in this case presents three years of negative results, with 
cash flow becoming positive on the second year of commercial production. This also resulted in a 
longer payback period of around 3.15 years, compared to the base case payback period of 2.6 years. 
The lower zinc price is especially impactful in this case, as zinc is by far the highest revenue generator 
of the deposit, and this change reduced profits from every period modeled. The estimate of free cash 
flow of this alternate case is presented in Figure 22-6.

The indicative economic results of this alternate case are presented in Table 22-11, the table further 
evidences that zinc is responsible for the majority of the revenue generation, and the underground 
mining cost continues to be the heaviest cost center of the operation, followed by the mineral 
processing cost as a distant second.

This change of metal prices in the alternate case economics, including the reduction of both zinc and 
lead and the raise of silver, does not significantly change the distribution of the revenue generation by 
metal. Figure 22-8 presents a very similar profile for each metal contribution compared to the base 
case.

The estimated all-in LoM cost decreased by US$0.01 to US$0.72/EqZn-lb as a result of reducing the 
royalty payments due to lower metal prices. Direct cash costs were raised by about US$0.01/EqZn-lb 
to a total of US$0.48/EqZn-lb due to the lower byproduct credit from the lower lead and silver price.

This conservative metal price alternative has a significant effect on the economic results of the project 
in comparison with the base case, probably in a scale that it would warrant additional optimization of 
the mineable resources and project plan.

There are no developed or advanced stage properties near the Project. The only historic commercial 
minerals undertaking was a short period of trial mining at Mina Grande 18 km northeast of the Property.  

Minera Chambara controls the largest claim position within 30 km of the Property. Minera Chambara 
is a joint venture company between Votorantim and Solitario. These two companies and affiliates are 
title holders for the claims subject to this JV.  

The only other publicly reported documentation related to mineral properties in the area is a NI 43-101 
report filed by the company Rio Cristal (Brophy, 2012) pertaining to the Cristal property approximately 
20 km to the north of the Property. This report does not include a Mineral Resource Statement. Rio 
Cristal no longer controls the claims considered in this report but the claims themselves remain in good 
standing held by individual claim owners.

25 Interpretation and Conclusions  
25.1 General 

The Florida Canyon Zinc Project is a significant greenfields potentially underground mineable high-
grade zinc deposit containing associated lead and silver. The Project has a large land position and 
strong technical and financial backing through Solitario's earn-in JV partner Votorantim. While this 
document represents the first formal economic evaluation of the Project, Votorantim and Cominco 
report having previously spent over US$60 million on drilling, test work and strategic planning for 
development (Solitario, 2014). Current projections in the zinc metal market suggest a near-term 
reduction in zinc supply as current major producers exhaust reserves. 

SRK's site visit to the project on the ground in northern Peru found it to be a well-organized facility, 
with current QA/QC protocols in place for drilling data verification and validation. Material handling, 
core storage and security were all at or above industry standards.  

SRK used a number of methods to validate the Votorantim resource block model starting with a face-
to-face meeting with the modeler and following on with a thorough audit of the model source data, 
geologic modeling techniques, grade and tonnage estimation methods and classification protocols. 
SRK found these to be in line with industry standards, having been produced with recognized mining 
software, defensible data and reasonable assumptions. SRK was able to independently validate the 
model results.  

A significant component of the SRK input to this PEA was the development of the underground mine 
plan. Because Florida Canyon is a polymetallic zinc-lead-silver deposit, each model block in the mine 
model was evaluated on an NSR basis, which included an estimate of recovery. Recovery was 
developed from a robust 2014 metallurgical campaign that characterized all expected material types. 
A recovered grade by block was used to build the underground stoping plan, complete with access, 
ventilation and an assessment of mine recovery and dilution. 

SRK is unaware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation or marketing factors that could 
limit or affect the resource stated in this document. The project will benefit from additional infill and 
exploration drilling, additional process-metallurgical test work, detailed engineering studies for 
infrastructure and tailings management and forward planning to clearly define concentrate transport 
and smelter costs.  

25.2 Mineral Resource Estimate 
The current exploration model for the Project has been applied successfully in drillhole planning and 
resource definition. There is low risk to the Project if no additional exploration is completed. However, 
additional drilling for resource definition has a strong potential to expand the known resource extent 
and upgrade Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated. The most prospective targets include: 

•  Extension drilling south of the San Jorge zone and northeast of the Karen-Milagros zones are 
considered the highest priority to increase high-grade zinc sulfide mineralization. Both zones 
are open in the recommended areas of drill testing.  

• Infill drilling several large un-drill tested areas surrounded by mineralized zones within the 
mineralized footprint has the potential to significantly increase resources. 

• Extension drilling peripheral to the currently defined mineralized footprint. 



SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. 
NI 43-101 Technical Report, Preliminary Economic Assessment – Florida Canyon Zinc Project  Page 193 
 
 

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

• Further develop drill targets over the 20 km long northern Florida Canyon mineralized corridor 
where large areas of strong zinc in soil and rock chip geochemistry indicate the potential for 
additional mineralized zones.  

At present, the deposit is open laterally to the north and south as well as to the west and east on the 
downthrown sides of the horst that defines the limits of exploration to date. Gaps in the drill pattern 
within the footprint of the existing drilling provide another opportunity to increase resources where drill 
spacing limits the continuity of stratigraphically controlled mineralization. A constraint on effective 
exploration and delineation drilling in these areas is the access to drilling stations due to the rugged 
terrain. The completion of a road into the area will help to expedite future drilling and development 
programs by providing increased access and lowering costs. Additional drilling from underground is 
also under consideration. 

The discovery of the high-angle, high-grade San Jorge zone has prompted more emphasis on angled 
drilling, where most of the historic drilling is vertical to near-vertical and is therefore ineffective at 
locating and defining near-vertical structures. These "break-through" structures have been mapped on 
surface in several locations, but due to logistical constraints, have not been adequately drill tested for 
their down-dip continuity. Similarly, there appear to be additional drill targets at the intersection of the 
high-angle structures and the flat manto zones, where grades are locally enhanced. These 
concentrations may be present within the existing drilling footprint, but require additional drilling to 
delineate. The high grade and potential tonnage of such targets provide an incentive to locate and 
further define resources of this geometry. 

25.3 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 
Processing of sulfide mineralization (zinc-lead-silver) from the Florida Canyon deposit is straight 
forward using conventional flotation to a concentrate followed by offsite smelting. Testwork indicates 
that producing a commercial quality zinc concentrate from mixed material needed to incorporate Dense 
Media Separation methods (DMS) in order to maintain high recoveries (80+%). However, a 
conventional flotation approach reached commercial quality (about 50%Zn) at the expense of lower 
metal recovery, with a similar outcome for the lead concentrate. It is SRK's opinion that conventional 
flotation should be able to achieve enhanced commercial level results (grade and recovery) under 
improved crushing, grinding, and flotation conditions. 

Available information about silver is very limited. The laboratory developed a relationship between 
lead's head grade and silver grade in the final lead concentrate. This relationship follows what is 
typically observed in this type of deposit, therefore as this stage of development it is assumed to be 
valid, but SRK recommends confirming it in the next testing phase of the project. 

To optimize recovery and grade when attempting to reach separation of the zinc and lead minerals 
into their respective commercial quality concentrates, SRK recommends approaching the selection of 
samples for the next phase of metallurgical sampling and testing. 

• The core logging needs to incorporate attributes like clay%, clay type, RQD, oxide content, 
sulfide content. 

• Assaying of the core should include whole rock analysis.  
• Collect samples for metallurgical testing representing distinctive zones in the deposit. Grade 

variability should be secondary criteria when selecting samples, but they must be reasonably 
close to what a potential mining operation would be able to deliver to the mill.

• There are potential synergies for processing oxide mineralization at Florida Canyon using 
expertise that Votorantim has gained at the Vazante and Morro Agudo mines in Brazil. These 
other existing operations have experience recovering hemimorphite, smithsonite, and 
hydrozincite, which may improve future recovery projections for Florida Canyon. 

25.4 Mineral Reserve Estimate 
There were no Mineral Reserves estimated for this PEA. 

25.5 Mining 
Using longhole stoping in steeply dipping areas, and cut and fill mining in flat lying areas of 
mineralization are seen as the appropriate mining methods for the deposit geometry, and both 
methods incorporate the use of tailings backfill. An NSR approach was used to calculate the value of 
a block and revenue for Pb, Zn, and Ag is considered. Stope optimization was completed to identify 
economic mining areas. The 3-D stope optimizer shapes and development design, along with dilution 
and mining recovery assumptions, are used to calculate tonnages and grades in the mine plan 
resource. A production schedule was generated using iGantt software targeting a production rate of 
2,500 t/d (912,500 mineralized tonnes per year). 

25.6 Recovery Methods 
The Florida Canyon polymetallic zinc-lead-silver deposit can be processed using a conventional 
concentration plant consisting of three-stage crushing, grinding using ball mill, and differential flotation 
to produce two final products: a zinc concentrate and a lead concentrate. Detailed sizing and costing 
of the processing plant components will follow additional metallurgical testing proposed in this study. 
Power supply and water supply appear to be fairly well defined for the project, though additional studies 
may be needed to refine these services and the costs of these services to the project. 

25.7 Project Infrastructure 
The Florida Canyon deposit is located in steep terrain in a remote part of northern Peru with moderate 
to high rainfall. These geographic and climatic conditions pose challenges to both access and 
infrastructure development.  

As presently understood, the key support services of power supply and water supply are available and 
part of a district-wide infrastructure improvement campaign being implemented by the Peruvian 
government and related third-party providers. The most significant advancement in the infrastructure 
investigation for the PEA was identifying the probability of hydroelectric power distribution to the site, 
as a lower cost alternative to on-site power generation. Water supply for operations appears to be 
straight forward, with abundant surface water available for mineral processing and camp support. 

The infrastructure component with the largest footprint and projected cost is the tailings storage facility. 
As part of this study, SRK has evaluated this as a dry stack facility in order to achieve geotechnical 
stability and reduce the area requiring reclamation. Trade-off studies are warranted to optimize 
moisture content, binding characteristics, and compaction methods during tailings placement to 
minimize water infiltration.

25.8 Environmental Studies and Permitting 
Additional environmental baseline studies are required for further project development.  

Impact to groundwater is expected to be minimal as underground surface exposures are minor and 
future exposed sulfides are not acid generating. There are no groundwater wells required for 
processing or potable water supply. There will be little or no surface area disturbance related to waste 
rock placement. 

Tailings are predicted to have low amounts of iron sulfide and to be geochemically stable with respect 
to acid rock drainage. There is also substantial neutralization capacity in the carbonate host rocks to 
mitigate acid generation. Residual lead and zinc sulfides have low acid-generating capacity; however, 
they are subject to metal leaching and therefore require compaction during placement.  

SRK recommends in future studies to design the tailings surface and spillway stormwater structure 
and evaluate options to reduce or eliminate the long-term obligation for monitoring and maintenance. 

25.9 Capital and Operating Costs 
As part of the Florida Canyon valuation exercise, SRK prepared an estimate of both capital and 
operating costs associated with the designed mineable resources production schedule. All estimates 
were based on yearly inputs of physicals and all financial data is second quarter 2017 and currency is 
in U.S. dollars (US$), unless otherwise stated.  

The total capital cost estimated for the Project was US$296 million, including US$213 million of initial 
capital and US$83 million of sustaining capital. 

Capital costs for mining were based on a preliminary stoping plan for the Florida Canyon deposit 
complete with development, access and ventilation. The assessment resulted in an estimate of 
approximately US$76 million. The process plant cost estimate was based on data from similar flotation 
plants with the same capacity and same region. This investigation resulted in an estimate of about 
US$60 million. The cost associated with the required surface crushing and conveying was based on 
required distances and elevation gain to cover. These include the movement of material from three 
mine portals to the plant feed area and some waste material that will be used to build the embankment 
for the tailings storage facility. This investigation resulted in an estimate of around US$1.4 million. 
Offsite-infrastructure, site infrastructure, power supply, water supply and backfill infrastructure cost 
estimates were prepared based the required structures costs from comparable operations. It should 
be noted that this study assumes that a third party is planning to build a hydro power plant that will 
provide power to the project,  

Operating costs for the life of mine are presented in Table 25-1.

Unit costs from similar projects in the same region or in the Americas, adjusted for labor and 
consumables differences, were used to estimate the LoM operating costs. All operating costs include 
supervision staff, operations labor, maintenance labor, consumables, electricity, fuels, lubricants, 
maintenance parts and any other operating expenditure identified by contributing engineers. 

25.10 Economics 
Florida Canyon is a zinc project, in which zinc contributes 90% to the overall revenue. Lead and silver 
are considered by-products of the operation. These metals contribute approximately 8% and 2% 
respectively. 

Using the assumptions discussed in the previous sections, the Project is valuated at US$198 million. 
The Project's all-in costs are estimated to be US$0.73/Zn-lb, on an equivalent production basis. 

Underground mining costs are the most relevant direct costs of the operation, corresponding to 
approximately 56% to the on-site operating costs. Approximately 76% of the off-site costs are the 
treatment, smelting and refining charges. 

The assumption of line power, compared to on-site power generation, makes significant positive 
impact to project economics. While there is sufficient confidence in the application of line power for it 
to be used as the base-case, there are some uncertainties regarding the timing of implementation of 
this component. 

The high in situ grades of the zinc mineralization and low impurities in sulfides at Florida Canyon 
should generate a premium concentrate and a highly saleable product in a market where strong future 
demand is forecasted. The challenge to Project development lies in its remote location, which raises 
capital costs for construction and operating costs for concentrate delivery, among other things. Road 
access to the site is still under construction and is seen as a key component to Project advancement. 
High-relief terrain and high annual rainfall are conditions affecting development, especially in the area 
of infrastructure construction and process/tailings containment and stability. 

Politically and socially, the development of a mining operation at this location is considered low risk as 
many of the local residents are already employed or seeking employment with Votorantim.  

The Project seems to be most sensitive to fluctuations of the metal prices. The impact of exchange 
rate fluctuations was not evaluated, as all costs were estimated directly in US$. It is recommended 
that this information is updated in future evaluations to better estimate the impact of exchange rate 
fluctuations. 

Even under distressed (-20%) metal prices the project will payback. Project break-even occurs when 
metal prices are reduced by about 32%. 

The impact of actual net smelter terms and of impurities in the concentrates was not evaluated in this

26 Recommendations  
26.1 Recommended Work Programs 

SRK acknowledges, after examination of the Project data set, that there have been a significant 
number of technical studies completed by Votorantim, many of which are beyond PEA level. Therefore, 
the work elements listed in Table 26-1 represent mostly prefeasibility and feasibility level engineering 
and drilling to support those studies.  

At the juncture where prefeasibility level engineering has been completed, the Project will likely warrant 
further public reporting to an international standard (JORC, or NI 43-101). Technical information 
required to achieve this level of project development is described below. Costs for the recommended 
work are listed in Table 26-1.  

 Engineering Studies (Prefeasibility Level) 
A Prefeasibility Study (PFS) for Florida Canyon requires additional metallurgical and geochemical test 
work as well as various detailed design improvements to refine costs. The key elements of the PFS 
are listed below. 

• Mining methods, equipment selection and costs; 
• Mining dilution optimization and cost refinement; 
• Geotechnical testing and modeling: 

o Numerical modeling for underground mine stability and pillar definition; and 
o Modeling for facilities foundation stability. 

• Metallurgical testing: 
o Variability testing; 
o Flotation optimization; and 
o DMS characterization. 

• Processing trade-off studies; 
• Processing optimization and cost refinement; 
• Infrastructure design and costs: 

o Map and further quantify the condition of the existing roads and identify deficits and further 
design features (drainage/poor soil conditions) on the road system to optimize the location 
and number of roads for the project; 

o Develop a site-wide water balance to determine whether there is need to further develop 
surface water and ground water sources for makeup water; 

o Determine actual flow rates available from Tesoro Creek and confirm it as a water source; 
o Prepare a more detailed site-wide load estimate to determine a more detailed required 

power load and further develop the cost and timing of the third-party power supply option; 
and 

o Revisit the transportation study to optimize freight costs and to determine optimal market 
location and freight operating costs and capital costs. 

• Market studies for concentrate sales and treatment; 
• Hydrogeological characterization and modeling for water supply, permitting and water 

pollution control; 
• Geochemical characterization and modeling (waste rock and tailings);

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

• Environmental baseline characterization; and 
• Technical Economic Modeling. 

 Drilling 
Drilling programs recommended by SRK will facilitate the modeling and trade-off studies planned at 
prefeasibility level. SRK also recommends drilling for resource expansion. 

• Exploration targeting both known outcropping and new high-angle structures and structural 
intersections inside the current drilling footprint; 

• North and south step-out exploration on San Jorge structure (south) and K-M mantos (north); 
• Resource conversion core drilling (HQ): Inferred upgrade to Measured/Indicated in the 

resource (includes matrix-matched reference materials for QC); 
• Metallurgical drilling for flotation and comminution testing (PQ); 
• Geotechnical drilling and compressive strength testing to characterize ground conditions for 

underground mine planning; 
• Geotechnical characterization drilling for mill and tailings foundation stability; 
• Geotechnical drilling to provide stability analysis for tailings storage; and 
• Water supply definition and hydrogeological characterization for dewatering. 

 Mining 
Mining recommendations are as follows: 

• Refine the underground mine plan with additional drilling; 
• Optimize the location of ramps/accesses and the order in which areas are mined; 
• Complete test work to determine the backfill material characteristics and placement options;  
• Geotechnical drilling and testing; and 
• Confirm productivities and operating cost assumptions based on detailed first principle's 

buildup.

28 Glossary 
The Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves have been classified according to CIM (CIM, 2014). 
Accordingly, the Resources have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred, the Reserves 
have been classified as Proven, and Probable based on the Measured and Indicated Resources as 
defined below.  

28.1 Mineral Resources 
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on 
the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for 
eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological 
characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological 
evidence and knowledge, including sampling. 

An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 
quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Geological evidence 
is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An Inferred Mineral 
Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and 
must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of Inferred 
Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with continued exploration. 

An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with sufficient confidence to allow the 
application of Modifying Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately detailed and reliable 
exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to assume geological and grade or quality continuity 
between points of observation. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than 
that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted to a Probable Mineral 
Reserve. 

A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the 
application of Modifying Factors to support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed and reliable exploration, sampling 
and testing and is sufficient to confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between points of 
observation. A Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that applying to 
either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It may be converted to a Proven 
Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve. 

28.2 Mineral Reserves 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral 
Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material 
is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at prefeasibility or feasibility level as appropriate that 
include application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, 
extraction could reasonably be justified.

JP/MLM Solitario_FloridaCanyon_NI43-101_PEA_181700-110_Rev20_AK August 2017 

The reference point at which Mineral Reserves are defined, usually the point where the ore is delivered 
to the processing plant, must be stated. It is important that, in all situations where the reference point 
is different, such as for a saleable product, a clarifying statement is included to ensure that the reader 
is fully informed as to what is being reported. The public disclosure of a Mineral Reserve must be 
demonstrated by a prefeasibility study or feasibility study. 

A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a 
Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve. 

A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A 
Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors.
