1 Summary 

1.1 Introduction 
This Technical Report describes the Costerfield district and mines, a mineral 
exploration, development, and production area located in the Central Highlands region, 
in the State of Victoria, Australia.  The Costerfield mine and district is owned by 
Mandalay Resources Corporation. (Mandalay)  The Augusta deposit refers to several 
lodes accessed from the Augusta decline, including E and W lodes which contain the 
bulk of the reserves and resources. 

Mandalay commissioned of this technical report in order for  Snowden Mining Industry 
Consultants Limited (Snowden) to provide an independent review of the 2011 Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves at their Augusta gold-antimony mine. They are 
reported to the standard required by the National Instrument (NI) 43-101 of the 
Canadian Securities Administrators.  

The Augusta mine site is located at Costerfield, approximately 10 km northeast of 
Heathcote, 50 km east of Bendigo and 100 km north of Melbourne, the capital city of 
Victoria, Australia.  The mine is located at a latitude of 36° 52" 27" S and a longitude 
of144° 47" 38" E. 

The Costerfield area has had a large number of different mining operators since 1860, 
mining for both gold and antimony.  The most extensive operations existed in the 
periods 1860 to 1883 and 1904 to 1925.  Between 1934 and 1980, there was ongoing 
exploration and intermittent small-scale production by several companies, including a 
period managed by the Victorian Mines Department. With more extensive exploration 
of the Costerfield deposits, a processing plant was constructed in 1995 to re-treat 
tailings and oxide material from the Brunswick open pit. Following continued 
exploration and drilling, the Augusta deposit was discovered and, following a successful 
feasibility study, the development of an underground mine was commenced in 2006. 

Primary approval for mine operation is held with the Mining License MIN 4644 issued 
by the Victorian State Government which was renewed on the 1st July 2010 for a 
further two years and so is due for renewal by 30 June 2012. Approval to explore is held 
with the Exploration Licenses EL3310 and EL4848 issued by the Victorian State 
Government. 

AGD Operations Pty Ltd (AGD), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mandalay, holds the 
mining and exploration licences.   

1.2 Geology and Mineralisation 
1.2.1 Geology 
The main Victorian goldfields are hosted by the Palaeozoic rocks of the Lachlan 
Orogen, which form part of the Tasman Orogenic System. The Tasman Orogenic 
system lies along the eastern margin of Australia and is part of a major orogenic zone of 
Palaeozoic age at the margin of former Gondwana continent. In Victoria the Lachlan 
Orogen is divided into two terranes, the Whitelaw terrane, hosting the bulk of the 
goldfield, and the Benambra Terrane to the east. Three tectonic zones are recognised: 
Stawell Zone, Bendigo Zone and Melbourne Zone.

The sedimentary rocks of the three zones are deformed into N-S to NNW-SSE 
periclinal folds with local reverse faults. Chevron style folds with axial surfaces that are 
vertical, or dipping steeply west, are common. These become tighter as the faults 
marking the eastern margins of the zones are approached. Spaced and slaty cleavage is 
developed. Metamorphism is all low-grade in the exposed rocks, predominantly low 
greenschist facies, although some rocks in the Melbourne Zone only show diagenesis. 

The main-stage Victorian gold mineralisation is located in quartz-sulphide veins 
developed during the later stages of fold development, but before emplacement of the 
local granitic plutons. Minor mineralisation is associated with pluton emplacement. The 
Costerfield Domain, which includes the Costerfield district, is considered to post-date 
late igneous activity of the Central Victoria Province. 

1.2.2 Mineralisation 
The Costerfield mineralisation typically occurs as narrow veins along faults.    Veins are 
reported to average ~0.3 m wide, ranging to as much as 1.75 m wide;  individual veins 
are traceable for up to 400 m along strike. There are two main vein types. The older 
consists of massive to laminated, locally brecciated quartz, locally with coarse gold.   
Gold content locally ranges up to several hundred g/t in these quartz veins. The 
younger vein type consists of massive stibnite, typically containing several tens percent 
antimony and up to 90-100 g/t gold. 

Mineralisation is related to NNW-SSE trending shear zones. Narrow veins may be 
steeply dipping or inclined. Steep veins occur on steeply dipping faults and are 
associated with local pugfilled zones. Inclined faults and veins dipping at 30-60° in a 
westerly direction are a major feature of the Augusta Mine. The vein system branches 
and changes in dip in cross section.  Individual veins are reported to be offset en-
echelon. Dips may be steeper than host bedding or sub-parallel to bedding. 
Unmineralised faults show a similar pattern. The veins are less extensive than the faults 
and form a discrete zone approx 80 m wide, dipping more steeply than the bedding 
through 150 m in elevation. 

1.3 Exploration and Production 
The Costerfield Antimony-Gold deposits were discovered in the 1860's.  At this time 
Coster, Field and Youlle named and mined the Main Costerfield Reef.  Further 
exploration led to the Minerva and Bombay deposits between 1860 and 1883.  From 
1936, the south Costerfield deposit was defined and mined.  This deposit is the 
northern extent of the Augusta deposits.  Mid East Minerals discovered the Brunswick 
line of antimony and gold mineralisation in 1966.  This deposit was further explored 
and mined by the Forsayth Mineral Exploration & Costerfield Mining Pty Ltd from 
1973 to 1975.  The Augusta mineralisation was discovered by the Victoria Mines 
Department between 1975 and 1981.  Continued exploration and resource definition 
drilling resulted in the completion of a successful feasibility study and development of 
the Augusta underground mine in 2006.    

Drilling from 2007 to the present by AGD has further defined the extents of the 
resource at depth and along strike. In 2010, fourteen new holes were drilled, for a total 
of 4,032.25 m, of which eleven holes were for modeling of the resource, the other three 
holes being service holes (refer to Table 1.1). Further drilling is planned for 2011, to 
increase confidence in identified resource and to confirm potential extensions.

1.4 2011 Mineral Resources 
Following review of the Fredericksen (2011) report, Snowden confirms that it endorses 
the contained Mineral Resource estimate.  

Snowden is unaware of any issues that materially affect the mineral resources and 
mineral reserves in a detrimental sense.   

Mandalay, through its subsidiary AGD Exploration and Mining Licenses have an 
approved environmental operating license, and Mandalay rehabilitate mine working, 
drill sites, and drill access roads on an ongoing basis.  

The basis for the 2011 Mineral Resource estimate (Frederickson, 2011) was the same as 
for the 2010 estimate presented in SRK (2010), which in turn was based on 
Fredericksen, 2009). 

The gold antimony lodes at Augusta are narrow, being generally in the 0.1 m to 0.5 m 
true width range and exhibit good continuity along strike and up and down dip. Given 
the narrow true thickness of these structures, they are suited to 2D estimation 
methodologies as have been utilised in previous estimates (Table 6.2).  

Vein thickness is a key variable in estimating the tonnage of the deposit and therefore 
using an unbiased estimation methodology such as kriging for the thickness variable in 
2D is considered to be good practice. 

Mining has progressed with the establishment of progressively deeper  underground 
levels , the vast majority of the faces have been mapped in detail, with an accurate 
measurement of lode thickness;  samples are carefully selected and assayed for gold and 
antimony. This data set was used to estimate a block model of the developed lode areas 
for both E Lode and W Lode using the 2D estimation methodology.

The remaining areas were estimated using the 2D estimation methodology using only 
the diamond drill data set. 

The estimation of the variables, Lode Thickness, Au Accumulation and Sb 
Accumulation are then made in the 2D plane block model using ordinary kriging. The 
Au and Sb grades are calculated for each block by dividing the estimated accumulation 
by the estimate thickness.  

Two block models were created with different block sizes. The face sample data was 
estimated into 2.5 m by 5 m blocks, and the diamond drill data into 20 m by 10 m 
blocks Upon completion the block models were combined into a single block model 
with the smaller block dimensions. 

The estimation method for grade is ordinary kriging. The primary validation tools used 
were domain statistics.  In addition "on screen" checks were completed to compare 
estimated block grades with the 2 m composite Au grades. There were no issues 
identified during this review. The model appears to be a valid resource estimate based 
on geological and mineralogical understanding of the deposit and is in line with the data 
supplied and the methods used. 

The endorsed figures are shown in Table 1.2.

1.5 2011 Mineral Reserves 
Following review of the data provided by Mandalay, Snowden confirms that it endorses 
the Mineral Reserve estimate.  

Planned dilution in each stope has been calculated by diluting the lode tonnes and grade 
to a nominal mining width of 1.2 m. This has been using a spreadsheet. Planned 
dilution in each development heading has been calculated by diluting the lode tonnes 
and grade to a nominal mining width of 1.8 m.

NI 43-101 Augusta Deposit, Costerfield, Victoria, Australia  

 

Final  June 2, 2011 13 of 97 

 

A combined unplanned dilution figure of 30% was used for stopes. Due to the short 
strike of the uphole airleg stopes (8 m) hangingwall dilution has been predicted as 20%. 
Bogging dilution has been assumed due to the practice of placing a bund at the back of 
each uphole stope to negate the need for remote bogging. Overall dilution for uphole 
airleg stopes is assumed to be 30%. Combined unplanned dilution figure of 20% was 
used for development.  

Two different development methods are used at Augusta, full face development and flat 
back development.  A recovery factor of 100% was used for both methods. 

Estimation of the Mineral Reserve is determined by applying Modifying Factors within 
the limits of the material classified as Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource 
categories only. Modifying factors considered include planned dilution, unplanned 
dilution and mining recovery (ore loss) within the mine design.  

The Mineral Resource within the designed mine openings, extracted using a Mine 2-4D 
design and IGantt scheduling software, allowing for modifying factors is used to create 
the Mineral Reserve for the current life of mine. 

The endorsed figures are shown in Table 1.3.

1.6 Conclusions 
1.6.1 Geological 

• Underground face sampling and diamond core drilling are appropriate to this style 
of mineralisation 

• Underground grade control face samples are supported by face and backs mapping 
• All samples are prepared off-site and fire assayed for gold along with Atomic 

absorption spectrometry (AAS) for antimony. The methods are deemed 

appropriate

Final  June 2, 2011 14 of 97 

 

• QAQC procedures at Augusta are appropriate, with results indicating that assay 
quality is good and appropriate to support resource estimation 

1.6.2 Mineral Resources 
• Mineral Resource estimation uses a two dimensional approach due to the thin 

nature of the lodes.  The estimation uses both diamond drill data and face sample 

data.  The face sample data appears to be slightly higher in grade when compared 

to the mill head data for the same operating period and this represents a risk in the 

mineral resource. 

• It is noted by Snowden that the categorization of Measured and Indicated Mineral 
Resource is based upon the extent of mine development, a conservative approach 

which ensures the estimation of Mineral Reserve is limited to known areas and 

extents of mineralisation. Snowden would suggest that some comparative 

optimization for stope plans both within these regions and in areas of previously 

Inferred Mineral Resource that have been converted to Measured and Indicated be 

trialed to confirm the accuracy of resource categorizations. 

1.6.3 Geotechnical 
• The site is progressing with a geotechnical database and geotechnical domain 

model to assist with geotechnical mine design parameters with depth. This has 

proved slow due to the unavailability of qualified personnel.  

• It was anticipated that the presence of large quantities of groundwater may result in 
a risk of mud rushes, especially in close proximity to the Mud Fault. While there is 

a risk, the completely recharged groundwater system has not yet resulted in any 

major ground control issue. This is most likely due to the vigilance of both 

technical and operating personnel in ensuring ground control procedures are 

adhered to.   

1.6.4 Environmental 
Environmental permitting and restrictions were established during a long drought 
period, and while care was taken to allow for the return of normal weather patterns, the 
mine has struggled to maintain integrity of water movements in the last six months due 
to exceptionally heavy summer and winter rainfall. Despite this, Snowden understands 
from AGD that the mine has managed to comply with the no discharge restriction. 

Since the SRK 2010 report, a number of items have been resolved: 

• AGD are currently in compliance with all authorized activities. 
• AGD are not providing any untreated mine water to third parties.  Historically 

during periods of drought some local dams were topped up for stock; this is no 

longer happening. Excess water is being trucked to the Heathcote pit under license 

from the Victorian EPA. 

• The mine has engaged Ensolve (Laura Conroy) to prepare site EMP based on main 
components as identified in site environmental risk assessment. This will 

encompass the whole mine site as well as historical workings and should replace 

the numerous smaller EMPs associated with the numerous Work Plans.

• SRK recommended the location and construction of ground water monitoring 
bores around the tails dam should be reviewed for their effectiveness. AGD has 

listed this as completed in the Groundwater Management Plan (GMP) to be 

included in TSF Lift WPV (Submission Dec 2010).  URS Corporation Australia has 

been engaged to undertake work. 

Items in progress or still outstanding are listed in Table 1.4 which includes the status 
of these, as provided by AGD.

Table 1.4 Outstanding Environmental issues  

Recommendation Status 

The water below the old Brunswick Tailings Dam should be sampled to determine 
the receiving environment water quality before the facility is deemed closed. 

Ongoing Monitoring - The Brunswick TSF is no longer being used.  This can be 
assessed if and when the facility is deemed closed.  Seepage detection trenches are 

monitored around the facility. 

The groundwater abstraction licence (#8005313) should be renewed to reflect 
current and future abstraction volumes. 

To be undertaken - Groundwater extraction licence has been amended from 69ML 
to 179ML. This will now need to be increased due to additional dewatering. 

Any mine water or process water with contaminant levels which exceeds the 
surrounding environment background concentrations (not background 

concentrations as found on the mine) should be contained in an impermeable 
storage facility or be treated to remove all elements to below toxic concentrations. 
A closed water containment system should be established as soon as possible. 

Currently being reviewed - AGD is a non discharge site, all water is contained on 
site with the exception of water being transferred to the Brunswick Pit (when 

required) for storage which is within acceptable background water quality limits. 

The risk of using mine water for dust suppression and thereby releasing inorganic 
contaminants into the environment should be assessed. 

Assessment has been undertaken and currently the mine water is only used for 
dust suppression within mine property. Currently we are investigating the possible 

use for dust suppression in the greater Costerfield area. WPV approval to use mine 
water for dust suppression will be undertaken. 

AGD should consider the development of a hydro-geological model to enable 
improved management of groundwater issues. 

This is in progress. Additional bores were implemented and a Hydrogeologist has 
been retained to assist with this. 

A material balance audit should be conducted to confirm volumes of topsoil and 
subsoil available for rehabilitation. 

To be undertaken - included in budget for Q2 2011 as will be required by DPI (bond 
self assessment) 

AGD should install groundwater monitoring bores to replace the current seepage 
detection bores as part of the construction of the next lift of the tailings dam. 

To be undertaken - New groundwater quality monitoring bores will be required to be 
installed under the GMP associated with the TSF Lift WPV. This work will be 

completed by August 2011. 

Monitoring locations, systems and bores that are not relevant to the current 
operation should be dispensed with, saving on unnecessary bore maintenance, 

sampling and analysis costs. 

Under review - This will be addressed as part of the EPM development.  It is 
unlikely that groundwater monitoring bores will be reduced. In fact additional bores 
will be required to be installed.  Annual costs are minimal.  Surface water sampling 

locations may be reduced. 

A minimum of six months of background data on dust monitoring should be 
acquired to enable the appropriate positioning of monitoring stations. 

Under review - A weather station will be acquired before background data can be 
collected. 

An application to the EPA should be made under the State Environment 
Protection Policy (Control of Noise from Commerce, Industry and Trade)No. N-1, 

to have the noise restrictions reviewed. 

Under review - This SEPP is currently under review by EPA.  AGD will be making 
no application to have noise restrictions reviewed at this stage.

More focus should be placed on the interpretation of the very large quantity of 
monitoring data available rather than just the reporting of the results. 

Under review - Ongoing improvements in analysis and reporting. 

A risk assessment should be done to quantify the risk associated with the 
management of mine-, process- and groundwater. 

Under review - Water in-rush risk assessment has been completed (Mining).  Site 
water balance will need to be reviewed and additional information gathered in order 

to prepare a site water management plan. This is in progress. 

The mine should collate all environmental management information from the 
numerous Work Plan variations into a separate internal document. 

Under review - EMP development will address this and supersede any WPV's that 
are no longer relevant.  A single new WPV for the whole site will be produced and 

submitted in 2011. 

AGD should develop an internal closure document using the conditions stipulated 
in the rehabilitation sections of the Work Plan variations. 

Under review - Bond calculation is a reflection of the site closure with sufficient 
funds held by DPI to ensure closure and rehabilitation can be completed.  Bond self 

assessment scheduled for Q 2011.

1.6.5 Mining 
• The introduction of Aramine microloaders to reduce drive size and subsequent 

dilution proved unsuccessful. Also issues with installing ground support in narrow 

drives arose.  The primary mining method has been changed from Cut and Fill to 

Bench Stoping. Bench stoping was selected as it is expected to produce the increase 

in mine grade at a reduced operating cost, despite an increase in dilution and 

reduced recovery. The mill feed has been primarily sourced from level 

development while stoping areas are being established. 

• "Mine Design Summary"(MDS) documents are carried out to review each new or 
different mining activity. These mining risk assessments that are a critical feature to 

ensure a safe and efficient working environment. Despite occupying significant 

resources in the technical services area of the operation the MDS documents must 

be continued. 

• The Technical Services team (Geology, Geotechnical, Planning, Production and 
Survey) has been operating with no spare capacity. The introduction of 2 Graduate 

Mining Engineers and a Production Geologist to the team will assist in easing this 

strain. 

• Following the application of dilution and mining recovery factors, the Mineral 
Reserve, for this operation is (Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, including 

stockpiles as of the 31st of December 2010) 88,242 t of ore at 9.9 g/t gold and 

6.1% antimony.  Mine life is through September, 2012. 

1.6.6 Process 
• Ore characterization is essential to improving milling processes for scheduling 

purposes, and understanding the trends and potential extents of both the current 

deposit and surrounding areas. This work has only recently begun, and needs to be 

completed to assure continued improvement in the mining operations through 

efficient milling and accurate mine design. 

1.7 Recommendations 
1.7.1 Geological 

• The down-dip section of the lode system (Augusta Deeps) appears open and forms 
a good drilling target. 

• Further drilling is required in this zone to support a resource update. 

1.7.2 Mineral Resource 
• It is noted by Snowden that the categorization of Measured and Indicated Mineral 

Resource is based upon the extent of mine development, a conservative approach. 

Snowden suggests that some comparative three dimensional optimization for stope 

plans, both within these regions and in areas of previously Inferred Mineral 

Resource that have been converted to Measured and Indicated, be trialed to 

confirm the accuracy of resource categorizations.

1.8 Geotechnical 
• Snowden notes that due to the shortage of geotechnical personnel in the mining 

industry, having a single full time geotechnical engineer has not been possible. 

AGD has resolved this by employing part time personnel to cover all essential 

activities. Snowden recommends that AGD consider using specialist contractors to 

assist in completing the outstanding geotechnical domain model. 

1.9 Environmental 
• Snowden note that while many of the environmental issues listed in the SRK report 

are being addressed (Table 1.4), a relatively small number have been closed out. 

While these items may not appear to effect production adversely, they are 

nonetheless critical to the continued smooth operation of the mine. Snowden 

recommend that these be pursued and resolved with the aim of closing as many as 

possible in the coming year. 

1.10 Mining 
• The mine management has moved proactively to alleviate difficulties with respect 

to the tightening employment market.  To date, closure of the other local operation 

at nearby Bendigo, preparedness of management to use part time employees in 

roles traditionally seen as full time, and the re-scheduling of the mine roster to a 2-

shift/day, has assisted this. Labour availability remains a risk to operations, both 

from a safety and productivity aspect, should the mining industry continue to 

experience growth and the accompanying shortage of skilled workers.   

• There is still no capacity within technical staff to complete a number of items such 
as ore characterization, and Snowden recommend that mine management be 

encouraged to continue with the innovations it has made to compensate for the 

shortfall in availability of personnel. 

1.11 Data Management 
• It was noted that a large proportion of geological and mining data is stored in 

electronic spreadsheet form or hardcopy format. Current site personnel have 

created an exceptional organization system and are diligent in maintaining file 

management; however there is no guarantee that this can be continued with 

inevitable staff changes.  Snowden recommend that a program be initiated to 

ensure that all hardcopy drawing data is stored electronically via scanning, and 

drilling and mining data transferred to a relational database to minimize errors and 

reduce both memory storage used and risks of data loss. Short term contracting of 

specialists in document control and mine site database management could assist 

with this. 

1.12 Process 
• Ore characterization is essential in order to optimise gold and antimony recovery.

5 Accessibility, climate, local resources, infrastructure and physiography 

5.1 Topography, elevation and vegetation 
The topography of the Costerfield area includes rugged hill country, undulating rises, 
gentle slopes and drainage depressions. 

The area has an average elevation of approximately 245 m ASL, with the range being 
from about 216 m ASL to about 268 m ASL. 

The vegetation landscape varies from mixed species of open forest in the valleys and 
gentle slopes, with shrubby box gum on the stony gravelly hills and heath and grasses 
on the dry slopes and ridges.  Much of the undulating land and alluvial flats have been 
cleared of vegetation for farming purposes. 

5.2 Access 
The Costerfield Project is accessed off the Heathcote-Nagambie Road at a distance of 
11 km from the junction with the main Northern Highway, at a distance of 
approximately 100 km north of Melbourne. 

The access road to the project, off the Heathcote-Nagamie Road is a narrow width 
bitumen strip with gravel shoulders, which are maintained in good condition. 

5.3 Proximity to population centre and transport 
The Augusta mine site is located at Costerfield, approximately 10 km northeast of 
Heathcote, 50 km east of Bendigo and 100 km north of Melbourne, the capital city of 
Victoria, Australia. Transportation is by road vehicles only. 

5.4 Climate and length of operating season 
The local climate of the Costerfield district is semi-arid or Mediterranean in character so 
that, generally speaking, the winters are cool and wet whilst the summers are hot and 
dry. There is a high probability of violent electrical storms occurring in summer and 
these can often yield high intensity downpours.  

Annual rainfall in the area is approximately 575 mm with most occurring between April 
and October.  The temperature ranges from -2°C in winter (May to August) to +40°C 
in summer (November to February). 

With occasional heavy rainfall occurring between April and October, the operating 
season for the operation is not unduly affected by climatic conditions. This results in 
the ability for the year round operation of the facilities with only short duration 
interruptions caused by the weather. 

The project area is in the western catchment of the Lower Goulburn River. It is flat to 
undulating terrain ranging in elevation from 160 m ASL in the east, along the 
Wappentake Creek, to 288 m ASL in the northwest.  

The area is a mixture of cleared grazing/cropping land and blocks of lightly timbered 
Box-Ironbark forest. The forested land is largely rocky, hill country administered by the 
Department of Sustainability and Environment as State Forest, while most of the 
undulating land and alluvial flats is privately held freehold land, which has been cleared 
for farming.

5.5 Infrastructure 
5.5.1 Power 
The Costerfield Project purchases electricity directly from the national electricity grid 
and has connections at both the Brunswick plant and Augusta underground mine sites. 

5.5.2 Water 
Mine water is pumped from the underground mine to a 40 ML evaporation pond 
adjacent to the Augusta Mine facilities.  

The process plant sources water from an adjacent bore (currently on hold), as well as 
from the Augusta Mine dewatering system, and from the old Brunswick pit. Water is 
also recycled from the tailings dam. Current water storage capacity is approxmately 
210 ML, which has been taxed by excessive rainfall (the area had been in drought for 
the past 10 years). 

The project does not have a permit to discharge water from the site. However 
emergency haulage of water to Heathcote and reinjection of water to the underground 
via the Bombay shaft, have been permitted for to control of water levels. 

Costerfield Project currently has a 179 ML water right for extraction from underground 
and from two surface bores. AGD are currently undertaking application to amend the 
groundwater extraction licence to increase from 179 ML due to additional dewatering 
requirements. 

The underground and surface water requirements of the operation are 45 kL/d. 

5.5.3 Mining personnel 
The workforce for the mine operation is sourced from the surrounding areas, and from 
the main population centres of Bendigo and Ballarat. 

The manpower available in the area has been altered by the recent closure of the 
Bendigo and the current re-opening of Ballarat Gold Mine. This has caused the mine 
working roster to move from a three 8-hour shift rotation to a two 10-hour shift basis 
to ensure adequate staff for safe operation.  The standard five day working week 
remains in effect. 

The total manpower on site as of December 30, 2010, is summarized in Table 5.1.

5.5.4 Tailings storage areas 
Tailings are now being deposited in Cell 2 of the Bombay Tailings Dam. The Bombay 
Cell #1, in which tailings from the current operation were deposited until Cell #2 was 
completed, is full. The treatment of old tailings from the Brunswick Tailings Dam has 
been halted due to poor results. 

The plan of the Tailings Dam area is shown in Figure 5.1 

5.5.5 Waste disposal areas 
Waste rock is used for back fill as much as possible.  The remainder is brought to a 
stockpile outside the portal before either being re-deposited underground as required or 
transferred to the surface waste dump.

6 History 

6.1 Prior ownership and ownership changes 
The Costerfield mine area has had a large number of different operators since 1860 
when antimony was discovered by two prospectors – Messrs Coster and Field.  Mining 
was halted during World War 1, when miners left to fight in the conflict.  

The company Gold Exploration and Finance Company of Australia recommenced 
operation in 1934. 

This was followed by South Costerfield Antimony and Gold Company in 1936, then the 
Victoria Antimony Mines, Mid East Minerals, Metals Investment Holdings, Forsayth 
Mineral Exploration, Costerfield Mining, the Victoria Mines Department between 1975 
and 1981, and Federation Resources NL who bought into the project in 1983.  

The current operator is Australian Gold Development NL (AGD), which is a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Mandalay Resources Corporation. 

6.2 Previous exploration and development work 
The Augusta Deposit was discovered during the ownership of the Victorian Mines 
Department between 1975 and 1981.  

6.3 Historical mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates 
6.3.1 Reliability of historical estimates 
A Mineral Resource Estimate was established for the Costerfield Project, for the W, E, 
C & N lodes, as at 31 March 2009 (refer  Table 6.1).   The author was Dean 
Fredericksen, a qualified person under NI 43-101.  However, because the mine was not 
a material property of a Canadian listed company at the time, an NI- 43-101 Technical 
Report was not filed.

Fredericksen's 2009 resource estimate was validated by SRK Consulting in 2010.  Also 
at that time, SRK updated Fredericksen's 2009 Mineral Resource Estimate of E and W 
lodes, by estimating depletion of the Resources between 1 April 2009 and 28 February 
2010 (refer Table 6.2).

SRK Consulting also estimated the mineral reserves remaining as of 1-Mar-2010.  This 
amounted to the first reserves estimate in the history of the mine, and totalled 65,576 t 
of ore at 13.1 g/t gold and 7.0% antimony. 

6.4 Production history 
In September of 2009 Mandalay entered into an agreement with Cambrian Mining 
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Coal Corp. (a company with two 
common directors), to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of AGD.  The 
transaction closed on November 30, 2009. Since then, the mine has been ramping up to 
a production level of about 6000 tpm. A summary of metal production reported since 
July of 2009 is shown in Table 6.3

The Table 16.1 is reproduced from Mandalay's fourth quarter, 2010, MD&A.  It 
contains operating statistics for the mine and mill through December, 2010, including 
typical mine development rates, ore output rates, mill throughput rates, gold and 
antimony recoveries, and concentrate produced.   It also includes the fourth quarter of 
2009 which was the quarter in which the company acquired the Costerfield Mine. 

During the three months ended December 31, 2010, the Costerfield mine produced a 
quarterly 15,062 t of ore; mining 19,980 t of waste, completing 1,124 m of operating 
development and placing 3,641 t of backfill.    

For the full year 2010, the Costerfield mine produced 53,021 tonnes of ore, while also 
mining 69,169 t of waste and placing 15,427 t of backfill.  The corresponding 
performance in 2009 (1,676 t ore, 3,435 t waste, and 1250 t backfill) represent only one 
month's performance (December).  The 3,526 m of operating development and 931 m 
of capital development during the entire 2010 year compare to the 91 m of operating 
development and 74 m of capital development during the one month of December, 
2009. 

During the fourth quarter, the concentrator processed 13,481 t of ore at 5.31% Sb and 
9.04 g /t  Au grade. This combination of high throughput and high grade resulted in 
quarterly concentrate production of 1,110 dry metric tonnes ("dmt"), saleable antimony 
production of 356 t and saleable gold production of 2,330 oz. Sales volumes for the 
fourth quarter, 2010, were 1,323 dmt of concentrate, 420 t of antimony, and 2,194 oz of 
gold.   

Over the full year of 2010 the concentrator processed 50,713 t of ore, producing 
3,495 dmt of concentrate, 7,661 oz of saleable gold and 1,106 t of saleable antimony.  
This compares with the single month of December, 2009, in which 1,813 t ore was 
processed, producing 75 dmt of concentrate, 226 oz saleable gold, and 23 t saleable 
antimony.  Full year recoveries were 87% for antimony and 79% for gold 

Sales for the full year 2010 were 7,317 oz gold and 1,141 t antimony.  For the single 
2009 month of December, 222 oz of gold and 21 t of antimony were sold.

7 Geological setting 

7.1 Regional geology 
The main Victorian goldfields are hosted by the Palaeozoic rocks of the Lachlan 
Orogen, which form part of the Tasman Orogenic System. This section is summarised 
from the recently published synthesis of the geology of Victoria edited by Birch (2003). 

The Tasman Orogenic system lies along the eastern margin of Australia and is part of a 
major orogenic zone of Palaeozoic age at the margin of former Gondwana continent. 
The western margin of this system against the Australian craton is marked by the 
Tasman Line. The eastern margin is not preserved. 

The segment in Victoria is composed of the western Delamerian Orogen and the 
eastern Lachlan Orogen. Boundaries run broadly N-S, parallel to the gross trend of the 
Tasman Orogenic System. In Victoria the Lachlan Orogen is divided into two terranes, 
the Whitelaw terrane, hosting the bulk of the goldfield, and the Benambra Terrane to 
the east. The Governor Fault, a complex dextral strike slip and reverse fault system, 
separates these terranes. The Moyston Fault bounds the Whitelaw terrane on the west. 

The regional geological setting is shown in Figure 7.1.

The Whitelaw Terrane is characterised by a Cambrian oceanic basement of basaltic 
volcanics buried by thick, deepwater, Cambrian to Devonian turbidite sequences. 
Sediments were deposited as deepwater fans that prograde east. The exposed 
sedimentary rocks decrease in age to the east, Cambrian St Arnaud Group in the Stawell 
zone, Ordovician Castlemaine Group in the Bendigo Zone and Silurian to Middle 
Devonian Murrindindi Supergroup in the Melbourne Zone. Three tectonic zones are 
recognised: Stawell Zone, Bendigo Zone and Melbourne Zone. The tectonic zones are 
separated by the Avoca and Heathcote Fault zones, steep reversed faults that dip to the 
west and flatten to near horizontal at depth. 

The sediments of the three zones are deformed into N-S to NNW-SSE periclinal folds 
with local developments of reverse faults. Chevron-style folds planes are common. 
These become tighter as the faults marking the eastern margins of the zones are 
approached. Spaced and slaty cleavage is developed. Metamorphism is entirely low- 
grade in the exposed rocks, predominantly low greenschist facies although some rocks 
in the Melbourne Zone only show diagenesis. Metamorphic recrystallisation is dated 
between 460 and 430 Ma in the Stawell and Bendigo Zones but is younger, between 410 
and 380 Ma in the Melbourne Zone. 

Granite plutons intrude the Zone and Terrane Boundary faults, fold systems and 
regional metamorphism in the Lachlan Belt. The Bendigo Zone, Melbourne Zone and 
west side of the Benambra Terrane are invaded by Late Devonian (~370-365 Ma) 
plutons of the Central Victorian Magmatic Province. Some are associated with evidence 
of major caldera collapse, where gently dipping, contemporaneous flows and 
pyroclastics are present. The volcanic rocks rest unconformably on folded Palaeozoic 
rocks, locally with a basal conglomerate. These volcanic rock show that the Melbourne 
zone had been uplifted and eroded to close to the present level prior to the onset of 
volcanic activity. Older plutons occur to the east and west of the Central Victoria 
Province.  

Mesozoic and Tertiary basins developed with thick fills of undeformed sediment on the 
north, south and west sides of the Victorian Palaeozoic outcrop. Tertiary lava flows 
cover parts of the erosion surface across the Palaeozoic outcrop. 

The main Victorian gold mineralisation is located in quartz veins developed during the 
later stages of fold development but before emplacement of the local granitic plutons. 
Minor mineralisation is associated with pluton emplacement. The Costerfield Domain, 
which includes the Costerfield site, is considered to post-date late igneous activity of the 
Central Victoria Province. 

7.2 Local geology 
The Au-Sb deposits in the Costerfield area are hosted within the Silurian Costerfield 
Siltstone unit (Figure 7.2 and Figure 7.3).  Within the area, four NNW-trending zones 
of mineralisation have been identified – the R-B Zone, the Costerfield Zone (the host 
to the Augusta deposit), the West Costerfield Zone and the Antimony Creek Zone.

The Augusta mine is located in the southern end of the Costerfield Zone and 
Costerfield Siltstone.   The siltstone is a thick (+600 m) unit of massive- to well-banded 
siltstones which are well-burrowed. 

The mineralisation is associated with NNW-trending shear zones, which dip steeply to 
the west.  Several lodes are identified at Augusta.  The E and W lodes are the most 
important lodes, followed by the smaller C and N lodes.  A very small, sulphide-rich 
lode, I lode is also identified.

8 Deposit types 
The Costerfield mineralisation typically occurs as narrow veins along faults.    Veins are 
reported to average ~0.3 m wide, ranging to as much as 1.75 m wide;  individual veins 
are traceable for up to 400 m along strike. There are two main vein types. The older 
consists of massive to laminated, locally brecciated quartz, locally with coarse gold.   
Gold content locally ranges up to several hundred g/t in these quartz veins. The 
younger vein type consists of massive stibnite, typically containing several tens percent 
antimony and up to 90-100 g/t gold. 

Stibnite bearing veins form a distinct mineralogical domain, the Costerfield Domain, 
within the Victorian Gold Field (Gao and Kwak 1995a/b; Campbell et al, 2003; 
Bierlein, Christie and Smith, 2004; Phillips et al, 2003; Moore, 2007; Arne, House and 
Lisitsin 2008). The domain includes veins dominated by stibnite and veins in which 
stibnite is a minor component. It includes fault hosted narrow veins and stockworks. 

The domain is centred on the Melbourne Structural zone but overlaps westwards into 
the Ballarat Zone with an outlying occurrence in the Taberabbera zone. It therefore 
spans major structural units and faults in the Victoria area. The distribution is 
approximately coincident with the Central Victorian Magmatic Province (Cas et al, 
2003), an episode postdating the main deformation and uplift of the Melbourne Zone 
and adjacent areas. 

Host rocks are predominantly metasedimentary rocks and veins postdate deformation 
in the Melbourne Zone. Fold and cleavage formation at 410-380 Ma in the Melbourne 
zone is late relative to events to the east and west (Gray et al, 2003). Rare examples of 
veins occur emplaced in mid/late Devonian felsic dykes and locally stibnite 
mineralisation occurs in volcanic rocks of the Central Victorian Volcanic Province 
which allow Phillips et al (2003) to show that the Costerfield Domain is discrete and 
significantly later event than the main quartz-gold mineralisation of Victoria. It is 
distinguished from minor pluton-related gold mineralisation by its wide distribution in 
the metasedimentare rocks remote from the plutons (Bierlein, Christie and Smith, 2004; 
Bierlein, Gray and Foster, 2002). 

Veins in the Costerfield Domain are likely to have been emplaced at much shallower 
depths than the main goldfields where major vein systems are associated with that late 
stages of fold development. The relict outcrops of gently inclined volcanic rocks of the 
Central Victorian Volcanic Province rest unconformably on the Melbourne zone 
metasedimentary rocks indicating that the region is exposed close to this surface. The 
presence of stibnite is considered an indicator of an epithermal setting (Phillips et al, 
2003; Moore 2007). Anomalous, but still very low, Hg values in wall rocks are 
associated specifically with the Costerfield Domain (Arne, House and Lisitsin, 2008). 
The reports of pyrobitumen and of mercury/cinnabar in associated deposits near 
Jamieson on the east of the Costerfield zone are consistent with this (Phillips et al, 
2003). Pressures (300-900 bars) and temperatures (200±50°C) estimated from a limited 
number of fluid inclusion studies are lower than those seen for the main goldfields (Gao 
and Kwak, 1995a/b; Bierlein, Christie and Smith 2004). Indicators of very near surface 
deposition such as chalcedony, colloform quartz or psuedomorphs after plate-form 
calcites are not reported. This is consistent with the 300-900 bars pressure estimates. 

The Costerfield domain is considered to be of an epithermal setting by Bierlein, Christie 
and Smith (2004) and Moore (2007). It is distinct from the Ballarat and other domains 
and occurs at the end of terrane accretion rather than during accretion. It also lies in the

broad context of orogenic gold deposits, occurring late in the sequence Bierlein, 
Christie and Smith (2004). 

Most sites in the Costerfield Domain were only minor producers or gold or antimony 
and information is more limited than for the major coarse quartz-gold systems. 
Improvements in the genetic and geological understanding are likely as mines are 
opened or extended.

9 Mineralisation 

9.1 Local setting of the Costerfield Mineralisation 
This summary is based on Gao and Kwak (1995), McCarthy, Fowler and Marshall 
(2008), SRK (2010) and Wilson (2009). 

The Costerfield area lies at the western side of the Melbourne Zone. It is 7-8 km east of 
the Mount William Fault that separates the Ballarat and Melbourne Zones. There are no 
major plutons of the Central Victoria Igneous Province in the area, the nearest being 
20 km to the south. (Figure 4.1). 

The local succession is exposed in a dome, elongated north-south (Figure 7.2). The 
Silurian Costerfield Formation occupies the dome centre and is the host to the 
mineralisation. Later Silurian and Lower and Devonian sedimenary rocks conformably 
overly the Costerfield Mudstone Formation. The sequence is dominated by siltstones 
with minor sandstone and argillite. 

The Costerfield dome has a curved crest line, trending from north-northwest to north 
and finally north-northeast when traced from south to north. The structure is truncated 
on the east side by the arcuate Moormbool Fault, across which the Devonian Broadford 
Formation crops out. The dome is spatially associated with a regional change in fault 
strike, north-south changing to north-northwest-south-southeast, affecting the major 
Heathcote and Mount Williams faults and the lesser Moormbool and Black Cat Faults. 

The  vein systems lie west of the main fold crest. Sections and bedding measurements in 
the mine show moderate 30-60

⁰
 dip to the west.  Minor folds plunge to the west and are 

unrelated to the main dome crest. Bedding dip changes across veins and small faults. 

No northerly trending cleavages are reported to be associated with the dome structure, 
consistent with the regional low strain and diagenetic or very low grade metamorphic 
conditions reported for the western Melbourne Zone. Wilson (2009) specifically notes 
that lack of cleavage. An east-west cleavage was reported locally from the Brunswick Pit 
and Wilson reports a local zone of cleavage with northwest-southeast trend 
underground.  These may be later than the main dome structure. 

9.2 The vein systems 
Evidence from outcrop and old mine sites shows that mineralisation occurs in a 14 km 
(north-south) by 9 km (east-west) region around Costerfield (Figure 9.1). Most historical 
mines occur in the north-northwest trending Costerfield Zone, which includes the 
Augusta mine site. Three other less well-defined zones occur. Zones are traceable for 
5 km to 10 km but individual reef outcrops are short, less than 1 km, and more varied in 
orientation. 

Mineralisation is related to north-northwest trending shear zones (Gao and Kwak, 1995; 
McCarthy, Fowler and Marshall, 2008). Narrow veins may be steeply dipping or 
inclined. Steep veins are associated with local pug-filled zones. Inclined faults and veins 
dipping 30-60° west are a major feature of the Augusta Mine (McCarthy, Fowler and 
Marshall, 2008). The vein system  branches and changes in dip in cross section. 
Individual veins are reported to be offset en-echelon.. Wilson (2009) suggests that most 
of the inclined Augusta vein systems are related to  transfer fractures between the main 
faults. The veins are less extensive than the faults and form a discrete zone approx 80 m 
thick, dipping more steeply the bedding through 150 m elevation.

9.3 Vein structure 
Veins average ~0.3 m wide, reaching a maximum of 1.75 m.  Individual structures are 
traceable for up to 400 m along strike (McCarthy, Fowler and Marshall, 2008). There are 
two main vein types: quartz veins with massive or laminated texture and massive 
stibnite veins. Areas of stockwork veining are also reported (Gao and Kwak, 1995). 

Illustrations in the literature show veins to have regular internal structure though several 
metres of exposure. McCarthy, Fowler and Marshall (2008) shows a 270 mm vein 
composed entirely of auriferous stibnite with sharp, parallel boundaries against barren 
siltstone through a height of ~3 m. SRK (2010 – Figure 6) shows a massive stibnite 
vein, with maximum thickness 100 mm, running parallel to a laminated quartz vein of 
similar thickness. Internal laminations in the quartz may be discontinuous and the more 
massive, quartz rich layer looks slightly discordant. Both veins taper upwards and 
downwards within the 2.5 m high exposure to give a common lenticular cross section. 
This may indicate down to right shear component during vein opening. The host rock is 
sheared parallel to the veins for ~2 m but the veins are not disrupted. 

The massive stibnite veins show (a) dense growth of stibnite blades normal to vein 
walls, with local interstitial quartz towards the inner ends of the crystals,  and (b) breccia 
of quartz clasts in stibnite (granular?) matrix. The bladed stibnite grows from a contact 
with earlier massive white quartz. These textures are comparable with stibnite textures 
illustrated in Campbell et al (2003). 

McCarthy, Fowler and Marshall (2008) report ore shoots may be spatially associated 
with lode intersection with cross-cutting, unmineralised faults. These faults trend 
northeast and contain sheared, metre-thick pug fills but are associated with only small 
displacements (<6 m) of the vein.  

9.4 Gold occurrence and mineralisation history 
Gold is closely associated with the stibnite in unweathered material (Gao and Kwak 
1995, Campbell et al 2003, Phillips et al 2003, McCarthy, Fowler and Marshall, 2008). It 
occurs as small, commonly <20 micron, grains within stibnite and more rarely as visible 
gold. Coarse-visible gold is observed in massive to laminated quartz veins and as 
dispersed particles in the stibnite-quartz veins. 

Gold at Augusta is thought to be remobilised from earlier arsenopyrite. The following 
sequence of events is proposed: 

• Sericite and pyrite development in host rocks 
• Faulting with open space quartz deposition and replacement of pyrite by 

arsenopyrite 

• Open space deposition of carbonate in vugs 
• Influx of antimony rich solutions, replacement of quartz and carbonate with 

mobilisation of gold. Gold precipitates in stibnite and quartz. 

• Recrystallisation and annealing of stibnite 
• Brittle faulting, milling of quartz, remobilisation of stibnite and carbonate 

replacement 

• Late narrow cracks with remobilised stibnite, pyrite or chalcopyrite. 

• Weathering processes.

There was not sufficient data available for Snowden to critically evaluate this sequence. 
It is however important that the history is understood from an exploration points of 
view and from the factors controlling gold grain size and deportment.

10 Exploration 
The Costerfield antimony-gold deposits were discovered in the 1860. At this time 
Coster, Field and Youlle named and mined the Main Costerfield Reef. Further 
exploration led to the Minerva and Bombay deposits between 1860 and 1883. From 
1936, the south Costerfield deposit was defined and mined.. Mid East Minerals 
discovered the Brunswick line of antimony and gold mineralisation in 1966. This 
deposit was further explored and mined by the Forsayth Mineral Exploration and 
Costerfield Mining Pty Ltd from 1973 to 1975. The Augusta mineralisation was 
discovered by the Victoria Mines Department between 1975 and 1981.  Continued 
exploration and resource definition drilling resulted in the completion of a successful 
feasibility study and development of the Augusta underground mine in 2006. 

AGD has continued exploration in the mine area. Mandalay drilled the Augusta E and 
W lodes below the existing mine with a single rig from June to December, 2010.  Good 
results of that program (Table 10.1) led the mine to commit a 12 month, two rig 
continuation of the Deeps drilling, plus inaugurate a single-rig, 8 month program to 
explore the district for new ore shoots (the Brownfields program). 

Snowden understand that the procedures employed have not changed materially since 
2009, and are as described in Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 of this document.

11 Drilling 

11.1 Introduction 
Drilling at Augusta is dominated by diamond drilling methods with excellent drill 
recoveries.  Core sizes vary and include PQ, HQ, HQ3 and NQ2.  Dill lengths vary 
from 20 m to over 350 m.  

Fredericksen (2009a) reports that drilling dates back to 1966 in the Costerfield area. 
Table 11.1 presents the drilling history at Augusta.

11.2 Drilling procedures 
Fredericksen (2009a) discusses the drilling procedures used by AGD.  Diamond drilling 
is carried out by contract drillers. The drillers record drilling activities on daily drilling 
reports. Drilled core is placed into storage boxes. Each bock is labelled with the drill 
hole number and the meterage.  Core blocks listing the hole number and meterage are 
placed at the end of each core run.   

Additional blocks marking the location of lost core and the end of hole are included by 
the drillers as required. 

Drilling is carried out in a staged fashion with initial exploration drilling occurring at 
100 m intervals along strike.  Resource drilling is then carried out at 40 m spacing  along 
strike and 30 m spacing down dip. In some places, drilling is as at tight as 10 m by 10 m 
should complexity of the geology warrant the additional drilling.  

Veins at Augusta dip to the west. Drilling is designed to drill from the hanging wall to 
the footwall (east plunging holes). Drilling is designed to be as close as possible to 
perpendicular to the veins. In the case of underground drilling, the drill holes are drilled 
from the footwall to the hangingwall.  

11.3 Drill Hole Collar and Survey Control  
Fredericksen (2009a) reports that underground and surface drill hole collar locations are 
established by survey personnel.  All designed collar locations are marked out by survey.  

Once drilling has commenced, the collar location is surveyed in. The surveyed collar 
locations are recorded in the drill hole request form and drill hole database.  

Down hole magnetic survey cameras are used to manage survey control. Typical 
azimuth and dip measurements are taken at 15 m down hole and every 30 m after that.  
In cases of low variable tolerances or uncharacteristic survey results, surveys are taken at 
closer spaced intervals. Recent drilling of the Augusta deposit has been undertaken with 
the use of electronic single shot instruments (REFLEX® and Camteq® tools).  Older 
drilling within the Augusta and Brunswick deposits has utilised Eastman® single shot 
camera for downhole survey control.    

The measurements obtained from these surveys are relative to magnetic north. A 
conversion is used to translate these measurements to mine grid. The electronic data is 
recorded by the driller on a separate survey data sheet, whilst for the Eastman surveys 
the discs are stored on site.  This sheet is given to the supervising geologist and the data 
is transferred to the drill hole database.  

Down hole cameras in recent times have been tested on a purpose-built site with a 
known azimuth and dip.  

The true thickness is calculated by converting the along-hole length using the dip and 
azimuth of the drillhole downhole survey and the dip and strike of the lode within a 
Minesight function. Details of the relationship between sample length and true width 
are supplied within Section 17.4 of this document.

12 Sampling method and approach 

12.1 Sampling Methods  
Sampling occurs from both the drill core and directly from underground face samples. 
This section summarises information from SRK (2010) and Fredericksen (2009a). 

12.1.1 Diamond Core Sampling  
Diamond holes are orientated so that the drill holes are as close as possible to being 
perpendicular to the veins. Diamond drill core is logged using a standardised procedure 
and legend.  Basic geotechnical (RQD), lithological, structural, mineralogical and 
alteration logs are produced using a touch-screen Tough Book computer installed with 
DrillKing software. 

All geological logs are produced by AGD geology personnel. Data collected on paper 
prior to implementation of this system has been digitally captured and appears in the 
drill hole database.  

Loss of drill core is initially noted on core blocks by the drilling contractor. This is then 
verified by the geologist during logging. The data is recorded within the drill hole 
database. In order to maximise core recovery and mineralised sample size, 80% of the 
core drilled is of HQ3 size.  

McArthur Ore Deposits Assessments Pty Ltd ("MODA") 2005 reported for Augusta 
holes MH001 – MH064, lode recovery was 88%, holes MH065 – M091 lode recoveries 
were 97%. For the Augusta deposit, much of the current resource estimate is based on 
recent drilling information (holes MH092 – MH178) where core recovery of the lodes is 
very high (in excess of 95%). 

Most of the drill core produced from the Costerfield area is comprised of barren 
siltstone and is not sampled. Sample intervals are selected and marked on the core by a 
geologist. 

General rules that are applied in the selection of sample intervals are: 

• All stibnite-bearing veins are sampled. 

• A waste sample is taken either side of the mineralised vein. 

• Areas of stock work veining are sampled. 

• Laminated quartz veins are sampled. 

• Massive quartz veins are sampled. 

• Silt stone is sampled where disseminated arsenopyrite occurs. 

• Puggy fault zones are sampled at the discretion of the geologist. 

AGD staff sample the core. The diamond drill core is cut in half with a diamond saw 
along the top or bottom mark of orientated core.  By this means a representative sample 
of the core is taken. 

Sample intervals for drill core are no smaller than 5 cm in length and no greater than 
2 m in length.  The average sample length for drill core samples within the Augusta drill 
program is 61 cm.  Some drill holes were designed and drilled for metallurgical analysis.  
Some sample intervals from these holes exceed 2 m in length.

The location and sampling orientations of the diamond holes are representative. For 
some holes, RC or hammer drilling is used to establish pre-collars for deeper diamond 
drill holes. Samples from RC or hammer cuttings are not used to support the Mineral 
Resource estimate. The summary statistics for the composite samples are provided in 
Table 12.1 below. 

Table 12.1 Summary statistics of composite samples 

12.1.2 Underground Face Sampling  
Daily underground face samples of the veins are collected using the following method:  

1. Face is marked out by the geologist, showing the limits of the lode (red paint) and the 
bedding angle in blue.  

2. Sample locations are marked out so that the sample is taken in a direction that is 
perpendicular to the dip of the ore lode.  Five separate sample locations are marked:  

          a) Hangingwall sample  

          b) Footwall sample  

          c) Three vein samples  

3. The face is measured and the lengths of the samples are measured. 

4. The face is photographed (a chalk board is used to display the name of the face). 

5. Each sample is collected as a channel sample using hammer and chisel and placed 
into a sample bag. 

6. Each sample bag is assigned a unique sample ID. 

7. A sample book is used to record the sample IDs used.  Also, a tab from the sample 
book is placed into the sample bag for use by the assay lab. 

8. The face is sketched on a face sample sheet and sample detailed recorded. 

9. The location of the face is derived from survey pickups of the floor and backs of the 
drive.

13 Sample preparation, analysis, and security 

13.1 Sample Preparation and Assaying Methods  
Drill core and underground face samples are prepared and analysed using the same 
techniques.  

13.1.1 Testing Laboratories  
Most of the recent drilling at Augusta has used Aminya Laboratories (Onsite 
Laboratories) in Bendigo for the assaying of Au and Sb. However, Genalysis (Brisbane 
and Perth) and ALS (Brisbane) have also been used. 

After dispatching the samples (core or face samples), it is understood that only staff 
employed by the assay laboratories are responsible for sample preparation and chemical 
analysis. Results are returned to AGD staff, who manage the database.  

The Aminya Laboratories is not certified to NATA standards. ALS is NATA-certified 
(825) for Au and Sb. Genalysis is NATA-certified (3244) for Au and Sb. 

13.1.2 Sample Preparation  
Fredericksen (2009a) reports the following sample preparation procedure:  

1. Sample material is placed into a calico bag previously marked with a sample 
number 

2. The sample characteristics are marked on a sample ticket and placed in the bag 

3. Calico bags are loaded in to plastic bags so that the plastic bags weigh less than 
20 kg 

4. Assay request sheet is filled out and placed in the sample bag 

5. Plastic bags containing samples are sealed and transported to Onsite lab in 
Bendigo 

6. Samples received by Onsite staff and checked against the submission sheet 

7. Job number assigned and worksheets and sample bags prepared 

8. Samples placed in oven and dried overnight at 80°C 

9. Sample (0.5 kg to 2 kg) jaw crushed to approximately 2 mm 

10. Sample milled and pulverised to 90% passing 75 µm 

11. Sample split, with 200 g for analysis and the remaining sample returned to 
sample bag for storage and return to site.  

13.1.3 Sample Analysis  
Fredericksen (2009a) report that gold grades are determined by fire assay/AAS. The 
following procedure is used:  

1. 50 g of pulp fused with 180 g of flux 

2. Slag removed from the lead button and cupellation used to produce a 
gold/silver prill

3. 0.6 mL of 50% nitric acid added to test tube containing prill and test tube 
placed in a boiling water bath (100°C) until fumes ceases and silver appears to 
be completely dissolved 

4. 1.4 mL of hydrochloric acid HCL added 

5. On complete dissolution of gold, when solution cooled, 8 mL of water added 

6. Once solids have settled gold content determined by flame AAS. 

Fredericksen (2009a) reports that Sb grades are determined using acid digest / AAS 
with the following procedure:  

1. Add 0.2 g of sample to flask 

2. Add 5 g of Tartaric acid 

3. Add 24 mL of 50% hydrochloric acid and allow to stand for 40 minutes 

4. Add 12 mL of Nitric acid and gently flux on hot plate 

5. When cool, dilute to 200 mL with distilled water 

6. Antimony content determined by AAS.  

13.2 Snowden comment 
The sample preparation practices and analytical techniques used at Augusta are deemed 
appropriate. Snowden can confirm that no directors, staff or other associates of AGD 
or Mandalay are involved in the preparation or assaying of samples from Augusta.

14 Data verification 
Historic data from the Costerfield district has not been subjected to modern Quality 
Assurance Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures.  

Fredericksen (2009a) reports that holes prior to hole MH064 were not subjected to any 
QA/QC analysis.  

In 2005, MODA developed standard reference material. The material was sourced from 
the Brunswick stockpiles.  

Subsequent to this, Geostats Pty Ltd prepared a set of standards for use.  

• At Augusta, four QA/QC protocols are in place:  

• Submission of standards to measure analytical accuracy  

• Review of laboratory preparation repeats  

• Blind re-submission of sample pulps  

• Submission of blanks  
In the following sub-sections, the author has relied upon other experts. This discussion 
on sample quality is based on information prepared by Fredericksen (2010). Snowden 
has not independently verified the results.  

Detailed descriptions on the sampling, assaying and quality assurance and control 
systems are contained in the Technical Report "Costerfield Gold and Antimony Project, 
Augusta and Brunswick Deposits" For this update of the Mineral Resource a 
recompilation and analysis of the QA/QC dataset collected for site standard reference 
material has been completed.  

Following the recommendations from the Brunswick re-assay program AGD 
established three lode grade standards (refer to Table 14.1that are submitted to the 
Onsite laboratory in Bendigo. AGD07-01 is produced from Augusta ore and is certified 
for both Au and Sb. G901-2 and G901-8 were created by Geostats. A standard is sent 
with each batch of exploration samples and twice a week with the underground channel 
samples. The assayed results of the samples are entered into a standard database which 
is then analyzed on a monthly basis. Blanks are submitted on a monthly basis. The 
results of these blanks are reviewed and noted by a geologist.  

The results of the analysis (See graphs of Standards as updated to the end of December 
2010 in Fredericksen 2010) of these samples indicates a reasonable level of compliance 
for the samples collected during the period March 2009 – December 2010. Previous 
QA/QC programs involved a significant amount of re-assaying to verify data sets for 
the data prior to this period.  

Ongoing QA/QC work is required to ensure that this reasonable level of compliance is 
maintained and it is recommended additional Inter-Laboratory repeat programs are 
implemented.

During the February site visit, Snowden observed that some of the most recent results 
from control samples had returned results that were outside the limits for standard 
deviations, and have recommended to site personnel that these be queried. At the time 
of writing, Snowden has not been advised of the results.

16 Mineral processing and metallurgical testing 
This section  is summarised from SRK (2010). Full details are given in that report which 
is filed on SEDAR under Mandalay's profile. Snowden has not undertaken any 
metallurgical review as part of this 2011 study.  

16.1 Mineral Processing Facility  
16.1.1 Introduction 
The plant, in its current configuration, was re-commissioned in 2006 by the previous 
owners to treat sulphide ore. The plant produces an antimony and gold-bearing 
sulphide concentrate.  

The Costerfield processing facility comprises of a two-stage crushing process, two 
milling stages in series, with classification and gravity concentration in closed circuit, 
rougher, scavenger and cleaner flotation for the production of a gravity gold stream and 
an antimony and gold concentrate. Currently, the gravity gold stream is being blended 
back into the flotation concentrate to produce a single product shipped to smelters. A 
facility for cyanide gold dissolution and adsorption followed by elution, electrowinning 
and smelting to produce bullion also exists.  As of early 2011, this facility was shut 
down and decommissioned due to poor leaching performance.  The current flotation 
tailings are sent to the current tailings storage facility. The plant operates 24/7.  

16.1.2 Crushing and Screening Circuit  
The crushing and screening plant consists of two stages of jaw crushing with 
intermediate screening.  Both crushers operate in open circuit.  Crushed ore is conveyed 
to two fine ore bins in parallel. Mandalay recently installed a re-feeder system so that 
crushed ore can be stockpiled on the ground in the event the ore bins are full.  Crushed 
ore can then be fed from the stockpile directly into the primary ball mill as needed. 

16.1.3 Milling Circuit  
The milling circuit comprises two ball mills in series, both in closed circuit. The gravity 
gold circuit is installed within the secondary milling circuit. The primary mill operates in 
closed circuit with a DSM screen, with screen overflow returning to the mill and 
underflow being pumped to the Knelson concentrators. The mill is reported to operate 
reliably.  

16.1.4 Flotation Circuit  
The flotation circuit consists of a combination of purchased equipment and site- 
fabricated or modified items.  The original surge tank, installed to separate the milling 
circuit from the flotation circuit, is now the conditioning tank.  The original 
conditioning tanks have been modified on site with spare parts to tank cell type 
flotation cells to add additional rougher residence time.  Denver cells are used for the 
remaining rougher, scavenger and cleaning duties.  A plate filter press is used for 
concentrate filtration. 

16.2 Metal Accounting  
Metal accounting is performed based on gold and antimony in plant feed, tailings 
discharge, and concentrate assays.  Samples are predominantly taken by hand-sampling 
of solid and slurry streams.  There are no sampling systems installed, although plans for

purchase and installation are in place as of Q1, 2011.  Plant recovery calculations are 
reconciled against gold and concentrate assays following each shipment.    

16.3 Mine and Plant Performance  
During the fourth quarter, AGD changed its processing flow sheet, blending gravity 
gold concentrate, previously sold to an independent refiner, with flotation concentrate 
to produce a high-gold antimony concentrate as a single product.  The technical results 
of this change were successful, and coupled with new smelter terms that include a 
higher payable gold percent at the elevated concentrate gold grades, produced better 
cash returns for concentrate sold than that from producing two separate products. The 
new scheme results in a simpler processing flow sheet and lower operating costs relative 
to the previous two-product scheme.  The Company liquidated its stockpile of 
previously produced gravity gold concentrate in the first quarter of 2011.

may not be comparable to similar data presented by other mining companies. These performance measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for 
measures of performance in accordance with IFRS.  Cash cost  per ounce gold produced or sold net of by product credits is calculated by subtracting antimony revenue 
from the total operating cost of production and dividing the remainder by the number of ounces produced or sold, respectively. 
(2) The cash cost per ounce of gold equivalent produced or sold are non IFRS performance measures that are included in this MD&A because these statistics are key 
performance measures under control of the operations that management uses to monitor performance, to assess how the mine  is performing, and  to plan and assess the 
overall effectiveness and efficiency of mining operations. These performance measures do not have a meaning within IFRS and, therefore, amounts presented may not be 
comparable to similar data presented by other mining companies. These performance measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of 
performance in accordance with IFRS.  Equivalent gold ounces produced or sold is calculated by adding to gold ounces produced or sold, the antimony tonnes produced 
or sold times the antimony realized price divided by the gold realized price. The total cash operating cost associated with the production of these equivalent ounces 
produced or sold in the period is then divided by the equivalent gold ounces produced or sold to yield the cash cost per equivalent ounce produced or sold. Variations 
between the produced ounces and sold ounces in a reporting period are purely the result of the timing of shipments to customers.

Plant throughput appears to be historically constrained by the limited availability of ore.  
The plant has a proven operating history operating at greater than 4,500 t per month 
with similar feed grades and recoveries. Since the SRK 2010 report, the mill has proven 
itself at sustained throughput rates of 6000 tpm and higher. 

Recovery is constant with monthly throughput up to 5,000 t per month, indicating that 
available ore and plant uptime are the key variables impacting production. (Note 
recently higher recovery performance as operational improvements have been made). 

16.4 Metallurgical Testing  
The Costerfield operation maintains operational data available from 2007 through to 
current day. Operational data is typically the most appropriate data to use for 
forecasting and budget purposes for similar ore types. New ore types are generally 
assessed by metallurgical testwork before processing for their suitability and 
characteristics.  Whilst production is ongoing from a single ore source with two lodes, 
each new level accessed contains the possibility for a change in the material 
characteristics.    

Metallurgical testing occurs as new levels of the mine are opened, typically every 
quarter.  Represenative channel samples across development ore faces are taken and 
submitted to the plant for metalurgical testing.  Independent metallurgical testing is 
undertaken using existing plant parameters and optimum grind size.  Most recent 
testwork has been performed in May 2010, June 2010 and January 2011. 

To enable improved plant performance and cost control, SRK recommended variability 
testwork should be conducted on each new level assessed within the mine.  The 
testwork should include, but not be limited to, the following tests: reagent dose vs. 
recovery for flotation reagents, grind size vs recovery, crushing and grinding work index 
determination and gravity gold recovery. 

Once consistent trends are established from level to level within the mine, it may be 
possible to reduce the number and range of tests required. 

16.5 Processing Risks  
Process risks are presented in SRK (2010). 

The primary ore processed is sourced from one mine with two lodes. These consistent 
feed sources to the respective circuits should generally result in lower risks of 
metallurgical losses. However, proactive test work should ensure the operations 
personnel are best equipped to optimise plant performance.    

The key processing risk was considered to be the mechanical availability of the plant. 
The mine has been intermittently able to maintain ore supply at or above the plant 
production capacity since March 2010. Maintenance downtime does not appear to be 
impacting concentrate production in the long term, although the ore stockpile grows 
and shrinks as the balance between mine production and milling rate varies..  

The saleability of the concentrate produced is another risk associated with the process. 
The product sold is a gold-bearing antimony concentrate. Depending on metal prices 
on metal prices, the revenue is roughly equally split between the two metals. It was 
reported on site that only two smelters have been identified that will pay a credit for the 
gold content of the antimony concentrate. As such, the project is heavily reliant on the 
sales agreement with these companies. Whilst there is a long-term sales agreement in 
place with one of them, the reason for the last period of extended plant shutdown was 
the default of the single client and their refusal to buy concentrate during the recent 
global financial crisis.

17.3 The basis of the Mineral Resources estimates for the Augusta 
deposit 
The basis for the 2011 Mineral Resource estimate (Frederickson, 2011) was the same as 
for the 2010 estimate presented in SRK (2010), which in turn was based on 
Fredericksen, 2009). 

The gold antimony lodes at Augusta are narrow, being generally in the 0.1 m to 0.5m 
true width range and exhibit good continuity along strike and up and down dip. Given 
the narrow true thickness of these structures, they are suited to 2D estimation 
methodologies as have been utilised in previous estimates (Table 6.2).  

Vein thickness is a key variable in estimating the tonnage of the deposit and therefore 
using an unbiased estimation methodology such as kriging for the thickness variable in 
2D is considered to be good practice  

Mining has progressed with the establishment of progressively deeper  underground 
levels on both E Lode and W Lode. By year-end, W-lode development had reached 
down to the 1000 level. The vast majority of the faces have been mapped in detail, with 
an accurate measurement of lode thickness samples carefully selected and assayed for 
gold and antimony. This data set was used to estimate a block model of the developed 
lode areas for both E Lode and W Lode using the 2D estimation methodology.  

The remaining areas were estimated using the 2D estimation methodology using only 
the diamond drill data set.  

The 2D estimation method requires that all Lode Intercepts are coded as to the Lode 
they belong to and the true thickness measured/calculated. The metal accumulations 
(Au * Thickness) and (Sb% * Thickness) are calculated for each lode intercept. The data 
points are then transformed to a plane approximately or best fitting vertical grid 
adjacent to the plane of the structure. In this case all data point was transformed to a 
vertical plane on 15400mE.  

The estimation of the variables, Lode Thickness, Au Accumulation and Sb 
Accumulation are then made in the 2D plane block model using ordinary kriging. The 
Au and Sb grades are calculated for each block by dividing the estimated accumulation 
by the estimate thickness.  

Lode tonnages (undiluted and diluted) were then calculated for each block using the 
estimated true width, calculated density and the local strike and dip of the lode.  

The key tasks undertaken were (from Frederickson, 2011):  

• Load and Validate the diamond drillhole 3D data set; 

• Load and Validate face sample 3D data set; 

• Code the Lode Intercepts (1 = E Lodes and 2 = W Lode); 
• Composite the Intercepts to create a single thickness and grade items for each lode 

intercept;

• Create a set of wireframes to represent the different structural orientation zones of 
the lodes. For each structural domain measure the dip and strike of the lode; 

• For the drill hole data set calculate the true width (function of orientation of the 
drillhole relative to the orientation of the structure). This is done using a 

Minesight® software routine. The face sample information is perpendicular to the 

strike and dip of the lodes so true width adjustments are not required; 

• Review data in cross sections, plan and in 3D to ensure the coding compositing 
and true thickness calculations are correct and valid;  

• Transform the 3D data to the vertical 2D plan – Essentially set all Easting's to 
15400mE; 

• Code the 2D drilling data set to represent the developed versus non-developed for 
statistical comparisons; 

• Complete statistical analysis for defined domains by lode; 
• Construct and model variograms for lode within the 2D plane for both the DDH 

data set and the face sample data set; 

• Initialise and Code and Estimate the true thickness, Au accumulation and Sb 
accumulation within a 2D block model for each data set; 

• Validate the estimation visually and statistically; 

• Back calculate the Au and Sb block grades; 
• Code the 2D Blocks to represent the structural domains determined for E Lode 

and W Lode. These are used to calculate the Lode tonnage for each block; 

• Combine the Face sample and DDH models into one model; 
• Calculate the lode tonnage, diluted lode tonnage (1.2 m minimum width) and 

diluted grades for each block; and 

• Classify and report the estimate using the supplied surveyed depletion outlines. 

17.4 Wireframe construction and compositing 
Wireframes for E Lode and W Lode were created from the points representing the 
hangingwall intercepts for each diamond drillhole intercept coded in the drilling data 
set.  

The points were wireframed to create a hangingwall surface and viewed in 3D. Domains 
representing similar structural orientations were created for each surface. 

Compositing was carried out using Minesight compositing routines. The compositing is 
done such that the composites honour the CODES assigned for each lode intercept 
resulting in one composite for each Lode intercept. Each composite was coded as per 
the structural domains for E Lode and W Lode.  

A Minesight routine CMPTRU.dat was run to calculate the true thickness of each 
drillhole intercept. CMPTRU calculates and store true thickness (or true thickness 
converted to vertical) to the drillhole composite File 9.  

The true thickness is calculated by converting the along-hole length using the dip and 
azimuth of the drillhole downhole survey and the dip and strike of the lode.

The Face sample data that has been coded composited already has intervals that 
represent the true widths of the lodes and as such are not adjusted by this routine and 
the true width is set to the along-hole length.  

Following the calculation of true widths of the intercepts, they were adjusted to fall on a 
vertical plan striking north on 15400 mE. All statistics, variography and 2D estimates 
were created in this plane. The orientations and strike and dip corrections that were 
applied to the block models are given in Table 17.3 

Table 17.3 Lode Structural Domains and Strike and Dip corrections to account for the 

difference in orientation between the block model plan and the structures. These 

strikes and dips are used to calculate the true thickness and lode tonnages (from 

Fredericksen, 2011).

17.5 Top-cutting 
A review of the Au and Sb populations for extreme grades was completed using log 
probability plots. For the face sample data, a top-cut of 150 g/t Au was applied prior to 
the calculation of the Au Accumulation. No top-cuts were applied to thickness, Sb% or 
the accumulation data. Fredericksen (2011) adopted separate domains for the 
wider/multi lode zones of the developed E Lode areas, and was cautious with selection 
of lodes in the diamond drill areas such as to limit the impact of an abnormally wide 
intercepts.  

A part of the statistical analysis, the DDH composites that fell within the developed 
areas of ELODE and WLODE were compared with the face sample data.   

• The mean thickness estimated form the diamond drilling is 0.46 m compared to 
that measured in faces of 0.33 m 

• For the Au accumulations the mean of the diamond drilling is 18.3 m.g/t Au 
versus the face samples of 22.1 m.g/t Au, and

Final  June 2, 2011 70 of 97 

 

• For the Sb accumulations the mean of the diamond drilling is 8.44% m versus 
12.06% m from the face samples.  

The face samples have a mean Au and Sb Accumulation some 25% and 15% higher 
respectively than that of the diamond drillholes within the same area.   

This would normally be of concern that the data sets were not comparable and there 
could be risk of a biased estimate.   

However there have been monthly estimates of mine production based on these 
samples that compare favorably with reconciled mill production. On this basis it is 
possible that the diamond drill intercepts will under call future mine production grades.  

17.6 Variography 
The directional variography study for all elements and estimation domains was 
undertaken using MineSight software within the 2D plane. The directional experimental 
variogram models to be applied in the kriging are detailed in Table 17.4 and Table 17.5.

17.7 Estimation 
Two block models were created with different block sizes. The face sample data was  

estimated into 2.5 m by 5 m blocks, and the diamond drill data into 20 m by 10 m 
blocks Upon completion the block models were combined into a single block model

17.8 Validation 
The primary validation tools used were domain statistics. The mean estimated grades 
generally compared favorably with the declustered mean grade of the composites for 
each domain.  In addition "on screen" checks were completed to compare estimated 
block grades with the 2 m composite Au grades. There were no issues identified during 
this review. The model appears to be a valid resource estimate based on geological and 
mineralogical understanding of the deposit and is in line with the data supplied and the 
methods used. The mean block values for thickness, Au accumulation and Sb 
accumulation compare favorably with the mean declustered composite values for 
ElODE both and DDH estimated and face Sample estimated and for WLODE face 
sample models. The WLODE DDH estimate block values are higher than those 
estimates in the model. This affect is marked on the margins of the Inferred Mineral 
Resource area and is not an issue for the Indicate Mineral Resource blocks. 

Statistical validation data is given in Table 17.8.

17.9 Density 
Fredericksen (2009a) reports that only limited density measurements from core have 
been made. In 2005, a formula for density was derived based on the stoichiometry of 
the mineral species.  The formula is:  

SG = ((1.3951*Sb%)+(100-(1.3951/Sb%)))/(((1.3951*Sb%)/4.56)+((100-
(1.3951*Sb%))/2.65)) 

AGD undertook a series of density measurements using immersion methods.  The 
results of these were presented by Fredericksen (2009a).

Figure 17.1 Density data compared to calculated value (from SRK, 2010) 

 

The results (Figure 17.1) indicate that the measured densities are similar, or higher 
than those derived from the formula. Densities in the estimate are derived from the 
formula. 

17.10 Mineral Resource reporting 
The classification categories of Inferred, Indicated and Measured under the JORC Code 
are equivalent to the CIM categories of the same name (CIM, 2005). 

Measured Mineral Resources are based on underground development (face sampling). 

Indicated Mineral Resources are based on 40 m by 40 m or less spaced diamond 
drilling. 

Inferred Mineral Resources are based on 40 m by 40 m or greater spaced drilling, or 
'Indicated' areas where local complexity raises uncertainty. 

17.11 Assumptions, methods and parameters  
17.11.1 Planned Dilution  
Planned dilution in each stope has been calculated by diluting the lode tonnes and grade 
to a nominal mining width of 1.2 m. This has been using a spreadsheet. It is difficult to 
apply a planned dilution on a stope-by-stope basis due to the method of transferring 
grade to the mine design. Planned dilution in each development heading has been 
calculated by diluting the lode tonnes and grade to a nominal mining width of 1.8 m.

17.11.2 Unplanned Dilution  
A combined unplanned dilution figure of 30% was used for stopes. Stoping unplanned 
dilution is the sum of overbreak (from deficient blasting practices), fall off (as in wedge 
failure), and over bogging (as stope ore is bogged against loose backfill). A factor of 
20% was used to represent the combination of overbreak and fall off. An additional 
10% was then added to reflect bogging against backfill. It should be noted that this 
represents the equivalent of 0.36 m over a stope width of 1.2 m. This factor is 
considered to be conservative as every attempt is made to mine the stope as close to 
lode width as possible. Practically, if a stope breaks out to 1.5 m (1.2 m + 03.6 m) wide, 
stoping is stopped, a pillar left and the next stope started. 

Due to the short strike of the uphole airleg stopes (8 m) hangingwall dilution has been 
predicted as 20%. Historically, the hanging wall dilution has been greater than this but 
the stope strike lengths were up to 10 m in length, and widths exceeded design. Bogging 
dilution has been assumed due to the practice of placing a bund at the back of each 
uphole stope to negate the need for remote bogging. This dilution has been assumed as 
10% based on the geometry of the stope and what the loader will be able to reach. 
Overall dilution for uphole airleg stopes is assumed to be 30%. 

A combined unplanned dilution figure of 20% was used for development. Development 
unplanned dilution is the sum of overbreak (from deficient blasting practices) and fall 
off (as in wedge failure before a face is supported). It is recorded monthly, drive by 
drive, by survey.  

17.11.3 Mining Recovery  
Two stoping methods are utilized at Augusta.  

Bench stoping involves drilling upholes (average 4 m long) from level to level. These 
stopes are limited to 8m along strike. A minimum pillar of 2 metres is left between 
stopes. It has been assumed that 10% of the blasted ore is lost in either the back fill, fly 
rock to the level above or due to poor blasting practices. An overall recovery of 72% 
from a 10 m panel along strike has been used. 

Crown stopes are mined by hand held methods. Blast holes extend 3 m up strike. A 
minimum pillar distance of 2 m was used. Stope geometry is engineered to negate the 
need to use remote loaders for bogging. This results in a recovery of 100 tonnes per 
20 m length of strike. This is equivalent to a recovery of 50%. Surveys of crown stopes 
mined to date are consistent with this figure. 

Two different development methods are used at Augusta, full face development and flat 
back development.  A recovery factor of 100% was used for both methods. 

17.11.4 Mineral Reserve classification 
The classification categories of Probable and Proved Ore Reserve under the JORC 
Code are equivalent to the CIM categories of Probable and Proven Mineral Reserve 
(CIM, 2005). 

17.11.5 Mineral Reserve reporting 
Probable and Proven Mineral Reserves are given in Table 17.2. A breakdown by lode 
and mining method is provided in Table 17.9. It should be noted that mining recovery 
for the blast hole method is set by calculation at 90%. Mining recovery factors to allow 
for the crown and rib pillars are created by the actual mine designs, which are governed 
by consideration of geotechnical and economic factors as discussed in Section 18.

Estimation of the Mineral Reserve is determined by applying Modifying Factors within 
the limits of the material classified as Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource 
categories only. Modifying factors considered include planned dilution, unplanned 
dilution and mining recovery (ore loss) within the mine design.  

The Mineral Resource within the designed mine openings, extracted using a Mine 2-4D 
design and IGantt scheduling software, carried out by Mandalay personnel, allowing for 
modifying factors and including material already stockpiled as at the 31st December 
2010,  totals 88,242 t of ore at 9.9 g/t Au and 6.1% Sb, containing 28,104 ounces Au 
and 5,369 tonnes Sb.

19 Additional Requirements for Technical Reports on Development 
Properties and Production Properties 

19.1 Mining operations 
Ms Cox visited the Costerfield operation in February 2011 and inspected the 
underground workings and associated documentation. Documentation and actual 
procedures matched satisfactorily, and do not vary remarkably from those described in 
the Mining Plus 2010 report. 

19.1.1 Mining method 
Initial development of the decline  (averaging 4.4 m by 4.5 m) has been by use of a 
jumbo and a Cat R1700 LHD.  

Stope creation is by uphole airleg stopes, blast hole stopes or a cut and fill method, as 
considered appropriate given the width of the ore and continuity in a particular area.  

These methods have been detailed in the Mining Plus 2010 report, although some 
modification in strike length and fill placement have occurred to improve recovery and 
minimize overbreak. Stope strike lengths have been limited to 8 m in length and pillars 
are 2 m long (Figure 19.1).

19.2 Contracts 
The underground mining activity is now carried out predominantly by Mandalay 
Resources personnel with contract personnel in place for some airleg mining and 
workshop labour. 

19.3 Environmental considerations 
19.3.1 Summary 
Snowden refers to the previous technical report (SRK 2010) with regard to details on 
environmental issues. 

19.3.2 Environmental bonds 
The environmental management programme for the mine exists as parts of each 
approved Work Plan Variation.  

The bonds applicable to MIN4644 are as follows:  

• Cash held by DPI of AUD$2,318,000.00  

• Bank guarantee backed by a cash deposit of AUD$1,198,000   

The rehabilitation bond may be adjusted periodically by DPI's Environmental Division, 
and at time of writing, AGD is expecting an increase on the bond held to be requested 
by DPI.  

19.3.3 Potential Issues  
Toxic elements such as antimony (stibnite), arsenic (arsenopyrite), cyanide (from 
processing) as well as lead (lead nitrate), caustic soda, acids and other flotation reagents 
used in the gold extraction process create problematic residues.  

Anomalous high concentrations of antimony and arsenic found in the groundwater at 
Augusta mine are known to occur naturally in groundwater in similar disseminated gold 
deposits. Mandalay has established baseline conditions, however Snowden cannot 
comment on the progress of the hydrogeological model at this time. 

It is noted that no discharge is permitted from the site. 

There are three tailings storage facilities on the property including the old Brunswick 
tailings dam, a recently filled tailings dam (Bombay Dam Cell 1) and a newly 
constructed tailings dam (Bombay Dam Cell 2) which is now being used.  

Tailings storage facilities have been approved by regulators as designed and have been 
constructed to the relevant standard.  

19.4 Taxes 
Income Tax on Australian company profits are set at 30%, however the Australian 
Federal Government also imposes special levies for mining and has announced an 
intention to impose levies based on carbon use. These may potentially increase taxes in 
the next Australian budget.

19.5 Capital and operating cost estimates 
19.5.1 Capital costs 
Capital and operating expenditure has been identified for the anticipated period of 
operation for the Costerfield Augusta Mine (that is for the period of extraction of the 
Mineral Reserves). Capital costs are grouped as Capital Development and Ongoing 
Capital (being for new or replacement capital expenditure items).  

• Capital Development  
The Capital Development scheduled involves completion of the decline to 980 m RL to 
enable the ore body to be exposed by development and to realise potential future 
mineral reserve. This development, which totals 434 m of various development, will be 
completed in May 2011 and cost AUD1.539M between January and May 2011. 

• On Going Capital  
The ongoing capital requirement to purchase equipment including fans, pumps, 
communication and electrical equipment and refuge bay installation totals AUD86M.   

• Operating Costs 

Actual mining cost (from Augusta Reserves 2011_04 Financials LOM Plan) of the 
operation from January 2010 to November 2010 averaged AUD209/t ore, excluding 
any capital development activity. The budgeted cost for the mine operating activity 
between March 2010 and November 2011 is AUD379/t ore, excluding capital 
development.. 

19.6 Economic Analysis 
19.6.1 LOM Plan and Economics 
The operating plan now extends to September of 2012, with the mine expected to 
extract and process the 81,600 tonnes of ore at 9.9 g/t Au and 6.2% Sb between 
January 2011 and August 2012. In addition to this, there were stockpiles on the ROM to 
be processed at December 31st, 2010 totaling 6,585 tonnes of ore at 9.4 g/t Au and 
5.0% Sb.  The reason the last month is September is because payment for concentrate is 
not made until the month after shipment.  The summary financial results of this LOM 
plan, using proven mineral reserves and probable mineral reserves only are shown in 
Table 19.1.

As with the SRK 2010 Report, the Cash Surplus and Pre Tax Profit are the parameters 
most affected by variation in the gold price with -50% to +50% variation with the 
±20% change from the Base Case (Figure 19.2 ). Variations in the antimony price result 
in similar variations, again affecting Cash Surplus and Pre Tax Profit most (Figure 19.3).

Variation in gold grade (Figure 19.4) affects all the base case characteristics, although 
the variation Cost is almost negligible, however lowering the grade to below -70% 
creates an effective zero point where the sensitivity analysis cannot function with the 
data supplied from site. 

The affect on Cost is more clearly visible when a variation of antimony grades is applied 
(Figure 19.5. Cash Surplus and Pre Tax Profit are the parameters most affected this 
variation also. 

Snowden is not informed enough on the Mandalay finances to generate fully cognisant 
sensitivity analysis for Capital and Operating Expenditure sensitivity analyses. 

19.6.3 Markets 
The Costerfield operation currently has a contract to sell all production of antimony 
concentrate to a single buyer which is for a period of the current life of mine. While 
Snowden is not qualified to comment on legal matters, it is noted that pertinent 
contract material between  Mandalay and Zhongan Antimony and Tungsten Trading Co 
Ltd has been sighted 

19.7 Pay Back Period 
Snowden is not privy to Mandalay finances to the detail required to discuss or comment 
in an informed manner on the Costerfield financial model with respect to pay back 
periods. 

19.8 Mine life 
The Proven and Probable ore reserve as at the December 2010, from the Measured and 
Indicated resource, is 88,242 t of ore, of which 6,585 tonnes are stockpiled . Current 
production targets for the 2011 and 2012 are shown in Table 19.2. The resultant mine 
life is calculated to be 21 months from January 2011. With a reduced throughput 
towards the end of this period, mine production of these reserves is scheduled to 
continue until September 2012.

20 Interpretation and conclusions 

20.1 Summary 
The Augusta mine is a small narrow-vein gold-antimony operation located at 
Costerfield, approximately 10 km northeast of Heathcote,  50 km east of Bendigo and 
100 km north of Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria, Australia.   

AGD Operations Pty Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mandalay Resources 
Corporation, which holds the mining and exploration licences.   

The deposit is located on the western edge of the Melbourne Trough in the Lachlan 
Geosyncline. Gold and antimony mineralisation occurs in narrow sulphide-dominated 
veins. The veins are hosted within a broader, strongly foliated shear system and are 
composed of laminated to brecciated quartz and massive sulphide mineralisation 
containing stibnite and gold.    

Underground production at Augusta commenced in 2006.  

With the previous Mineral Resource statement as at March 2010 production from the 
mine, as reported by AGD Operations, has been 50.7 49.2 kt at 7.3 g/t Au and 4.2% Sb 
from March 2010 to December 2010. All production was from the E and W lodes.  

The underground mine has decline access via 4 m wide and 4 m high development 
mined at a gradient of 1 in 8.  This decline development has been mined to 
approximately 1020 m RL or 150 m below surface.  There is horizontal access to the E 
and W Lodes of the orebody at approximately 8 m level intervals. The orebody width is 
variable – up to 1.2 m and the dip of the orebody is about 70°.  

Access below the 1020 m RL to the lower levels of the orebody is being achieved by 
extending the decline (4.4m wide and 4.5m high) to the lower horizons to enable 
orebody confirmation with diamond drilling and vein development.  

The upper levels of the mine were extracted using long hole stoping. The stope height 
and geological inconsistency on the hanging wall and limited geotechnical support 
resulted in increased dilution from hanging wall fall/failure. 

With deteriorating ground conditions, the extraction method was changed to cut and fill 
mining to improve the mining recovery and reduce dilution. This method, apart from 
improving the recovery by reducing ore loss and increasing the head grade by lowering 
dilution, also improves the consistency of production by decreasing the unpredictability 
of the hanging wall conditions with lower cut heights and allows the level interval to be 
increased to 20 m. It slowed production rates due to inefficiencies in the back fill cycle 
and the limited number of available faces. 

The decision was made midway through 2010 to change the mining method to a sub 
level, blast hole stoping method utilizing a modified Avoca backfill cycle to alleviate the 
need for remote bogging. 

The greatest benefit from this change was the number of development faces that 
became available from each 20 m level was increased three fold. 

The decrease in dilution from changing from Cut and Fill to stoping is yet to be fully 
realised as the mine has been primarily feeding the mill development ore for the period 
since the change.

20.2 Conclusions 
20.2.1 Geological 

• Underground face sampling and diamond core drilling are appropriate to this style 
of mineralisation 

• Underground grade control face samples are supported by face and backs mapping 
• All samples are prepared off-site and fire assayed for gold along with AAS for 

antimony. The methods are deemed appropriate 

• QAQC procedures at Augusta are appropriate, with results indicating that assay 
quality is good and appropriate to support resource estimation 

20.2.2 Mineral Resources 
• Mineral Resource estimation uses a two dimensional approach due to the thin 

nature of the lodes.  The estimation uses both diamond drill data and face sample 

data.  The face sample data appears to be slighter higher in grade when compared 

to the mill data for the same operating period and this represents a risk in the 

mineral resource. 

• It is noted by Snowden that the categorization of Measured and Indicated Mineral 
Resource is based upon the extent of mine development, a conservative approach 

which ensures the estimation of Mineral Reserve is limited to known areas and 

extents of mineralisation. Snowden would suggest that some comparative 

optimization for stope plans both within these regions and in areas of previously 

Inferred Mineral Resource that have been converted to Measured and Indicated be 

trialed to confirm the accuracy of resource categorizations. 

20.2.3 Geotechnical 
• The site is progressing with a geotechnical database and geotechnical domain 

model to assist with geotechnical mine design parameters with depth. This has 

proved slow due to the availability of qualified personnel.  

• It was anticipated that the presence of large quantities of groundwater may result in 
a risk of mud rushes, especially in close proximity to the Brown Fault. While there 

is a risk, the completely recharged groundwater system has not yet resulted in any 

major ground control issue. This is most likely due to the vigilance of both 

technical and operating personnel in ensuring ground control procedures are 

adhered to.   

20.2.4 Environmental 
• Environmental permitting and restrictions were set during a long drought period, 

and while care was taken to allow for the return of normal weather patterns, the 

mine has struggled to maintain integrity of water movements in the last six months 

due to exceptionally heavy summer rainfall. Despite this, Snowden understands 

from AGD that the mine has managed to comply with the no discharge restriction. 

20.2.5 Mining 
• The introduction of Aramine microloaders to reduce drive size and subsequent 

dilution proved unsuccessful. Also issues with installing ground support in narrow

drives.  The primary mining method has been changed from Cut and Fill to Bench 

Stoping. Bench stoping  was selected as it is expected to produce the increase in 

mine grade at a reduced operating cost, despite an increase in dilution and reduced 

recovery. The mill feed has been primarily sourced from level development while 

stoping areas are being established 

• "Mine Design Summary"(MDS) documents are carried out to review each new or 
different mining activity. These mining risk assessments that are a critical feature to 

ensure a safe and efficient working environment. Despite occupying significant 

resources in the technical services area of the operation the MDS documents must 

be continued. 

• The Technical Services team (Geology, Geotechnical, Planning, Production and 
Survey) has been operating with no spare capacity. The introduction of 2 Graduate 

Mining Engineers and a Production Geologist to the team assist in easing this 

strain 

• Following the application of dilution and mining recovery factors, the Mineral 
Reserve, for this operation is (Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves) 88,242 t of 

ore at 9.9 g/t gold and 6.1% antimony.  Based on the current reserves the mine life 

is through to end September, 2012. 

20.2.6 Process 
• Ore characterisation is essential to improving milling processes for scheduling 

purposes, and understanding the trends and potential extents of both the current 

deposit and surrounding areas. This work has only recently begun, and needs to be 

completed to assure continued improvement in the mining operations through 

efficient milling and accurate mine design.

21 Recommendations 

21.1 Geological 
• The down-dip section of the lode system (Augusta Deeps) appears open and forms 

a good target 

• Further drilling is required in this zone to support a resource update 

21.2 Mineral Resource 
• It is noted by Snowden that the categorization of Measured and Indicated Mineral 

Resource is based upon the extent of mine development, a conservative approach. 

Snowden suggests that some comparative three dimensional optimization for stope 

plans, both within these regions and in areas of previously Inferred Mineral 

Resource that have been converted to Measured and Indicated, be trialed to 

confirm the accuracy of resource categorizations. 

21.3 Geotechnical 
• Snowden notes that due to the shortage of geotechnical personnel in the mining 

industry, having a single full time geotechnical engineer has not been possible. 

AGD has resolved this by employing part time personnel to cover all essential. 

Snowden recommends that AGD consider using specialist contractors to assist in 

completing the outstanding geotechnical domain model. 

21.4 Environmental 
• Snowden note that while many of the envronmental issues listed in the SRK report 

are being addressed (Table 1.4), a relatively small number have been closed out. 

While these items may not appear to effect production adversely, they are 

nontheless critical to the continued smooth operation of the mine. Snowden 

recommend that these be pursued and resolved with the aim of closing as many as 

possible in the coming year.  

21.5 Mining 
• The mine management has moved proactively to alleviate difficulties with respect 

to the tightening employment market.  To date, closure of the other local operation 

at nearby Bendigo, preparedness of management to use part time employees in 

roles traditionally seen as full time, and the re-scheduling of the mine roster to a 2-

shift/day, has assisted this. This remains a risk to operations, both from a safety 

and productivity aspect, should the mining industry continue to experience growth 

and the accompanying shortage of skilled workers.   

• There is still no capacity within technical staff to complete a number of items such 
as ore characterization, and Snowden recommend that mine management be 

encouraged to continue with the innovations it has made to compensate for the 

shortfall in availability of personnel.

21.6 Data Management 
• It was noted that a large proportion of geological and mining data is stored in 

electronic spreadsheet form or hardcopy format. Current site personnel have 

created an exceptional organization system and are diligent in maintaining file 

management; however there is no guarantee that this can be continued with 

inevitable staff changes.  Snowden recommend that a program be initiated to 

ensure that all hardcopy drawing data is stored electronically via scanning, and 

drilling and mining data transferred to a relational database to minimize errors and 

reduce both memory storage used and risks of data loss. Short tem contracting of 

specialists in document control and mine site database management could assist 

with this. 

21.7 Process 
• Ore characterization is essential to improving milling processes for scheduling 

purposes, and understanding the trends and potential extents of both the current 

deposit and surrounding areas. This work has only recently begun, and needs to be 

completed to assure continued improvement in the mining operations through 

efficient milling and accurate mine design.
