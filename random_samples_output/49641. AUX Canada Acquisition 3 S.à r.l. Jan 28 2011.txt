1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was retained by David 

Meyer, Managing Director of Norvista Resources Corporation (Norvista), to prepare an 

independent Technical Report on the California Project, Department of Santander, 

Colombia.  The California Project is indirectly held by Norvista's subsidiary Calvista Gold 

Corporation (Calvista Gold).  Calvista Gold is the sole shareholder of Sociedad Minera 

Calvista Colombia, S.A.S. (Calvista Colombia), the registered holder of the mining titles 

comprising the California Project.  This Technical Report is in support of an initial public 

offering and conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Scott 

Wilson RPA visited the property from October 20 to 21, 2010.  

 

On March 12, 2010, Norvista, Calvista Gold, and Calvista Colombia entered into an 

agreement whereby Calvista Gold agreed to indirectly acquire, through Calvista 

Colombia, subject to certain conditions, a 100% interest in eight mining titles totalling 

158.10 ha in the California mining district of Colombia by making certain cash payments 

and issuing shares equal to 30% of Calvista Gold's capital.  Calvista Gold's interest 

would be subject to a one-time cash payment to be paid on the basis of US$12 per 

ounce estimated in NI 43-101 compliant reserves within three years of the date of the 

agreement, to a maximum of US$12,000,000. 

 

On August 26, 2010, Calvista Colombia, also acquired an option to earn up to a 100% 

interest in licence 098-68 (El Sinu), subject to a Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty 

payable on production, which option can be exercised by making aggregate cash 

payments of US$2,150,000 to the optionors, of which US$150,000 has been paid to 

date. 

 

The major asset associated with the California Project is its proximity to significant high-

sulphidation-style vein systems and its potential to host similar mineralization. In 

particular, recent drilling on the Jaramalla–Callejon Blanco–El Sinu licences appears to 

have intersected the southwestern extension of the mineralized corridor that hosts the 

Angostura and Mascota zones.  Calvista Gold's mining titles are strategically located

along the Rio La Baja fault zone, which is thought to be the structure that controls the 

mineralization in the California district. 

 

INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The California Project consists of nine mining titles grouped into six non-contiguous 

blocks within the rapidly developing California mining district of Colombia.  The mining 

titles are underlain by prospective lithologies of the Santander Massif in proximity to the 

northeast striking Rio La Baja fault zone, which appears to be the controlling structure to 

mineralization in the area.  Artisanal mining is currently taking place, or has taken place, 

on all the California Project mining titles.  Prior to Calvista Gold's involvement, the 

subject mining titles had not had the benefit of modern exploration techniques and only 

limited diamond drilling had taken place locally.  

 

Recent exploration in the California district has been successful in defining very 

attractive gold mineralized zones along the Rio La Baja structure, including Greystar 

Resources Ltd.'s multi-million ounce Angostura deposit and Ventana Gold Corp.'s 

(Ventana) Mascota zone, where an underground exploration program is currently 

underway. 

 

The mineralization in the California district consists of sheeted, steeply dipping quartz ± 

pyrite veins and hydrothermal breccias hosted by variably sericitized and argillized 

intrusive and basement gneissic rocks. It has been interpreted to represent high-

sulphidation-style mineralization. 

 

Work to date by Calvista Gold has been concentrated on the two northernmost blocks 

and includes reconnaissance geological mapping and diamond drilling.  As of the 

effective date of this report, 14 holes have been completed for a total of 4,786.89 m.  

Limited geological mapping has been completed on the southern blocks.  Calvista Gold 

has also completed a detailed helicopter-borne, combined magnetic and radiometric 

survey over all of its holdings in the California area. 

 

The projection of the mineralized corridor southwest from Angostura and through 

Mascota appears to have been intersected in diamond drilling by Calvista Gold on its 

Jaramalla (0100-68) and Callejon Blanco (0037-68) licences. Calvista Gold controls a

strike length of approximately 600 m along the prospective structure. Elsewhere, 

Calvista Gold's Buenavista licence is located along strike of Ventana's Las Mercedes 

and Asserradero zones where preliminary sampling has returned very encouraging 

results. 

 

Calvista Gold has developed and implemented quality assurance/quality control 

(QA/QC) protocols that meet current industry best practices. Calvista Gold's protocol 

during the 2010 drilling program included the insertion of blanks and both core and reject 

duplicates as well as a limited number of certified standards into the sample stream. 

Samples with assay results greater than 10 g/t Au were re-assayed by metallic screen 

analysis. Calvista Gold has submitted a suite of samples of pulp duplicates to an 

alternate laboratory. 

 

Although the drilling to date by Calvista Gold is preliminary, the results have confirmed a 

very attractive geological setting including permissive structure, alteration, and 

mineralization. The assay results received to date have been sufficiently encouraging to 

warrant considerable additional exploration. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the California Project has the potential to host 

significant high-sulphidation-style gold mineralization.  

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Calvista Gold's California Project covers highly 

prospective ground and merits continued significant gold exploration, including increased 

diamond drilling.  A substantial work program is recommended.  Recommended Phase I 

work, beginning as soon as is operationally practical, includes: 

 

• Completion of geological mapping, prospecting, and sampling on all licences, 
 

• Follow-up with detailed Induced Polarization (IP) and soil sampling of prospective 
structures/targets on the southern blocks as defined by the helicopter-borne 
geophysical survey, 
 

• Follow-up of Phase I drilling results with additional diamond drilling on the 
northern blocks, and

Calvista Gold Corporation – California Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011 

      

Page 1-4 

• Acquisition of additional ground along the prospective corridor to cover airborne 
geophysical anomalies, if any. 

 

A cut grid will be needed on the southern blocks to facilitate IP surveying and soil 

sampling.  Soil sampling on the southernmost blocks can be done on a 50 m x 50 m grid 

over geophysical targets.  Mobile Metal Ion (MMI) analysis has been demonstrated to 

work in the project area. 

 

Follow-up drilling on the northern blocks should be completed at regular intervals along 

the structure by drilling multiple holes from individual set-ups so as to minimize the 

environmental impact and costs related to making trails and drill set-ups as well 

minimizing moving costs.  A program of 10,000 m of drilling is recommended. 

 

Contingent upon the Phase I program results, a Phase II program, envisioned to begin in 

late 2011 and take approximately six months to complete, consists of: 

 

• Diamond drilling of significant Phase I soil and IP anomalies on the southern 
blocks, 

• Additional delineation drilling on the northern blocks, 

• Preliminary metallurgical testing, 

• Initial resource estimation, and 

• Baseline environmental sampling. 

 

A drilling program totalling 15,000 m is recommended to test coincident geophysical and 

geochemical anomalies on the southern blocks and to delineate the limits of the known 

mineralization and better assess the grade distribution of the mineralized zones on the 

northern blocks. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that Calvista Gold explore the possibility of extending 

the terms of the various exploitation licences to maximize the time available for 

exploration, development, and mining and/or consolidating the licences into one 

concession agreement. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that Calvista Gold continue to implement and make 

enhancements to its current QA/QC protocol during the recommended drilling programs

including the insertion of blanks, core duplicates and multiple certified standards into the 

sample stream. Samples returning over-range gold assays should continue to be re-

assayed by screen metallics.  Pulp and reject duplicates should also be prepared and 

assayed by an alternate laboratory and the regular laboratory, respectively, on an on-

going basis. Calvista Gold should initiate a program of regular specific gravity 

determinations designed to facilitate possible future resource estimations. 

 

Details of the recommended programs can be found in Table 1-1.

TECHNICAL SUMMARY 
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The California Project is located approximately 65 km by road from Bucaramanga, the 

capital city of the Department of Santander, Colombia.  The California Project comprises 

nine exploitation licences grouped into six non-contiguous blocks totalling approximately 

168.98 ha, within the Municipality of California, Department of Santander. The project is 

located on the Instituto Geográfica Augustín Codazzi (IGAC) Plancha 110-I-C 

topographic map (1:25,000 scale), roughly within a rectangular area extending for 

approximately 5.5 km in a northeasterly direction and 2.0 km in a northwesterly direction. 

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) co-ordinates for the approximate centre of 

this area are 1,127,000 mE, 1,308,000 mN (Colombian Gauss coordinate system with 

datum Bogota Observatory). 

 
LAND TENURE 
Norvista, Calvista Gold, and Calvista Colombia entered into an agreement dated March 

12, 2010, whereby Calvista Gold agreed to indirectly acquire through Calvista Colombia, 

subject to certain conditions, a 100% interest in eight mining titles, which confer the right 

to explore and exploit the underlying lands, by making a payment on closing of 

US$2,155,908.20 and issuing to the vendors of the mining titles, or a person designated 

by them, shares equal to 30% of Calvista Gold's capital.  Calvista Colombia has the 

option of making one or two additional, discretionary payments on the first and second 

anniversary of the closing of the transaction for an aggregate amount of 

US$1,437,271.62.  Calvista Gold's interest would be subject to a one-time cash payment 

to be paid on the basis of $12 per ounce, estimated in NI 43-101 compliant reserves 

within three years of the date of the agreement, to a maximum of $12,000,000. 

 

On August 26, 2010, Calvista Colombia, also acquired an option to earn up to a 100% 

interest in licence 98-68 (El Sinu), subject to an NSR royalty payable on production, 

which option can be exercised by making aggregate cash payments of US$2,150,000 to 

the optionors, of which US$150,000 has been paid to date. 

 

Some of the licences that make up the California Project are in their second ten-year 

term, after which no extension is possible. Upon the expiry of the licences, Calvista 

Colombia will be entitled to apply for a concession agreement covering the same areas 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 

Calvista Gold Corporation – California Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011

as the expired licences. In addition, under the current Law 1382 of 2010, Calvista 

Colombia is entitled to request the integration of all of the mining titles into a single 

concession agreement.  Article 101 of Law 1382 of 2010 provides that different 

neighbouring mining titles, which have been granted for the same minerals and that 

belong to the same mineral deposit, may be integrated into a single concession 

agreement for the unified areas.  If a determination is made by the mining authorities that 

the integration of the mining titles is possible and complies with all legal and technical 

requirements, a unified concession agreement could be granted.  The term of this unified 

agreement will be determined taking into account the term that has lapsed in the oldest 

mining title included in the integration.  The unified concession agreement may be for a 

maximum of 20 years subject to the conditions established in Law 1382 of 2010. 

 

In accordance with Colombian law, the holder of the mining licences has a right to 

access the parcel of land covered by such mining licences and may perform exploration 

and exploitation work on them, subject to indemnification for damages to the owners of 

such parcel of land that may arise from such access, and the activities carried on by the 

holder of the mining licences. 

 

All of the mining licences comprising the California Project are currently in good 

standing. None of the licences have been surveyed and there are no known 

environmental liabilities beyond those that relate to on-going artisanal mining and 

recovery of gold using mercury and cyanide. 

 
SITE INFRASTRUCTURE 
The California Project benefits from secondary road access locally.  A high tension 

power line crosses the northern portion of the project area.  Any mining development in 

the project area would have access to the national power grid.  The area of the 

California Project is serviced by a power line with a voltage of 34.5 kV and power of 5 

MW.  Sufficient water for any mining operation is readily available. 

 
HISTORY 
Gold in the greater California district was reportedly discovered in 1549 during a Spanish 

military action, though the area had already been the site of mining by the indigenous

Sura people in pre-Colombian times.  Spanish colonials engaged in two open pit 

operations in the district to the northeast of the California Project. 

 

Although small scale operations have taken place over the years on the various mining 

titles comprising the California Project, no records of this production appear to exist. 

 

In 2010, prior to its acquisition by Calvista Gold, a limited amount of drilling was 

completed on the eastern portion of Licence 098-68. With the exception of one hole, the 

results of this drilling are not known. There is no other documentation related to 

exploration activities, including diamond drilling, available for any of the subject mining 

titles. 

 
GEOLOGY 
The California property is situated within the western splay of the Eastern Cordillera in 

northeastern Colombia and is underlain by rocks of the Santander Massif.  

 

The oldest rocks within the Santander Massif consist of Precambrian gneisses and 

schists that were part of the Guyana Shield. These rocks were regionally 

metamorphosed to upper amphibolite grade during dynamo-thermal metamorphism. 

Younger rocks of Paleozoic age occur in the region. Dioritic to granitic composition 

intrusive rocks in the district belong to the Triassic-Jurassic Santander Plutonic Group. 

Emplacement of these intrusives occurred during a period of uplift in the Triassic- 

Jurassic.  Younger porphyries are very common in the area and these may be as young 

as Tertiary. 

 

The Precambrian rocks were deformed sometime during the Paleozoic. During the 

Mesozoic, granitic to dioritic rocks intruded into the deformed Precambrian basement, 

and felsic to andesitic volcanic rocks were extruded. At that time, part of the Eastern 

Cordillera was in a back-arc setting, and local basins formed and filled with marine-

transgressive sediments. During Late Cretaceous to Paleocene/Eocene, folding and 

thrusting of the Eastern Cordillera resulted in basin inversion and uplift. The porphyry 

stock hosting part of the Angostura mineralization was intruded at this time. Uplift and 

erosion of the Eastern Cordillera, in particular the Santander Massif, occurred during

Page 1-10 

Late Eocene to Early Oligocene time, with reactivation of older structures and continued 

uplift during the Middle to Late Miocene. 

 

Finally, starting in the Late Miocene and continuing to the present, a major Andean 

deformation event is taking place with increased strike-slip faulting, extrusion and 

escape of the triangle-shaped Maracaibo block to the north along the left-lateral 

Bucaramanga Fault (to its west) and the Boconó Fault system (to its south and 

southwest).  Basin inversion and rapid uplift are continuing. 

 

The California Project area is underlain by rocks belonging to the Santander Massif.  The 

constituent rocks can be grouped into two main lithological types: (i) complexly deformed 

rocks of high metamorphic grade including migmatites, and (ii) porphyritic intrusive 

bodies consisting of dykes and small stocks.  Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are found to 

the north of the village of California. 

Precambrian high grade metamorphic rocks include paragneiss, pelitic and arenaceous 

schists, hornblendic schists, and migmatites and are mapped as Bucaramanga Gneiss. 

Metamorphic rocks of low to medium grade metamorphism, including micaceous schists, 

phyllites, meta-sandstones, quartzites and marbles, correspond to the Silgará Formation, 

of Cambrian-Ordovician age. 

Several batholiths and plutons, with compositions ranging from granite to diorite, were 

intruded during the Jurassic-Triassic.  Small stocks of porphyry, ranging from dacite to 

andesite in composition, and dikes of basalt, diabase, and dacite are related to this 

magmatic cycle.  The sedimentary rocks are limited to certain areas of the Santander 

Massif. 

The gold mineralization from the California district has been interpreted to be of the high-

sulphidation epithermal type. 

Gold is located along faults that cross-cut sedimentary and igneous wall rocks intruded 

by dacite porphyry.  Mineralized veins also cross-cut the altered dacite porphyry.  Ore 

mineralogy consists of high-sulphidation assemblages. Alteration assemblages of this 

high-sulphidation system consist of quartz-alunite and an element enrichment spectrum 

of Au, Ag, Te, Bi, As, Sb, and locally W.

From September 28 to October 28, 2010, Calvista Gold completed reconnaissance 

mapping of the three northern blocks.  The host rocks are mainly gneissic with some 

granodioritic zones located along the major fault zones. The extent and shape of the 

intrusives are not yet defined. The structural system appears to correspond to northeast-

southwest, left-lateral regional shear zone, generating primary east-west conjugate and 

secondary north-south conjugate shears. These structures create rectangular blocks, 

which potentially host an excellent environment for gold mineralization.  Dilation zones 

found at the junctions of these faults created potential conduits for the hydrothermal 

fluid.  There appears to be a relationship between the amount of sulphide dissemination 

and gold concentration.

2 INTRODUCTION 
Scott Wilson Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (Scott Wilson RPA) was retained by David 

Meyer, Managing Director of Norvista Resources Corporation (Norvista), to prepare an 

independent Technical Report on the California Project, Department of Santander, 

Colombia (Figure 2-1).  The California Project is indirectly held by Norvista's subsidiary 

Calvista Gold Corporation (Calvista Gold).  Calvista Gold is the sole shareholder of 

Sociedad Minera Calvista Colombia, S.A.S. (Calvista Colombia), the registered holder of 

the mining titles comprising the California Project.  This Technical Report is in support of 

an initial public offering and conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral 

Projects.   

 

Norvista is a private Canadian merchant bank based in Toronto, Ontario, dedicated to 

making investments in the natural resources sector through its various subsidiaries, 

including Calvista Gold.  Norvista has mineral interests in several countries including 

Canada, Colombia, and Mexico. 

 

On March 12, 2010, Norvista, Calvista Gold, and Calvista Colombia entered into an 

agreement whereby Calvista Gold agreed to indirectly acquire through Calvista 

Colombia, subject to certain conditions, a 100% interest in eight mining titles totalling 

158.10 ha in the California mining district of Colombia by making certain cash payments 

and issuing to the vendors of the mining titles, or a person designated by them, shares 

equal to 30% of Calvista Gold's capital.  Calvista Gold's interest would be subject to a 

one-time cash payment to be paid on the basis of US$12 per ounce estimated in NI 43-

101 compliant reserves within three years of the date of the agreement, to a maximum of 

US$12,000,000. 

 

On August 26, 2010, Calvista Colombia, also acquired an option to earn up to a 100% 

interest in licence 098-68 (El Sinu), subject to a Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty 

payable on production, which option can be exercised by making aggregate cash 

payments of US$2,150,000 to the optionors, of which US$150,000 has been paid to 

date.

The major asset associated with the California Project is its proximity to significant high-

sulphidation-style vein systems and its potential to host similar mineralization. In 

particular, recent drilling on the Jaramalla, Callejon Blanco, and El Sinu licences appears 

to have intersected the southwestern extension of the mineralized corridor that hosts the 

Angostura and Mascota zones.  Calvista Gold's mining titles are strategically located 

along the Rio La Baja fault zone which is thought to be the structure which controls the 

mineralization in the California district. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA prepared a previous NI 43-101 report on the California Project dated 

April 15, 2010. 

 

SOURCES OF INFORMATION 
A site visit to the California property was carried out by Paul Chamois, M.Sc. (A), P. 

Geo., Senior Consulting Geologist with Scott Wilson RPA, from October 20 to 21, 2010.  

During the visit, Mr. Chamois reviewed the logging and sampling methods, examined 

drill core from holes CAL-5, CAL-11, CAL-12, and CAL-13, and visited two active drill 

sites and several recently completed drill sites. The locations of the drill collar locations 

were confirmed with a hand-held GPS instrument. Samples for data verification were 

collected from holes CAL-1, CAL-3, and CAL-4. 

 

During the visit, discussions were held with: 

• David Meyer, Managing Director, Norvista  
• Michael D. Johnson, Chief Operating Officer, Calvista Gold 
• Jack King, Project Manager, Calvista Gold 
• Jocelyn Pelletier, Project Geologist, Calvista Gold 
• Nelson Romero Suarez, Project Geologist, Calvista Gold 
• Felix Raul Zipamoncha Yerly, Project Geologist, Calvista Gold 

 

Mr. Chamois had also visited the property on February 13 to 14, 2010, in relation to the 

Technical Report dated April 15, 2010, prepared for Norvista. 

 

This report was prepared by Paul Chamois, an Independent Qualified Person, who is 

responsible for all sections of the report.

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
LAND TENURE 
The California Project encompasses nine mining titles grouped into six non-contiguous 

parcels of land within the Municipality of California (see Figure 2-1).  Collectively, these 

titles cover approximately 168.98 ha. The project is located on the Instituto Geográfica 

Augustín Codazzi (IGAC) Plancha 110-I-C topographic map (1:25,000 scale).  Table 4-1 

lists the subject mining titles, registered owners, areas, and relevant dates.  The subject 

mining titles were map-staked and therefore no boundary markers exist.  As of the 

effective date of this report, none of the licences have been surveyed. 

 

The six parcels of land are located roughly within a rectangular area extending for 

approximately 5.5 km in a northeasterly direction and 2.0 km in a northwesterly direction.  

The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) co-ordinates for the approximate centre of 

this area are 1,127,000 mE, 1,308,000 mN (Colombian Gauss coordinate system with 

datum Bogota Observatory). 

 

In accordance with Colombian law, the holder of the mining licences has a right to 

access the parcel of land covered by such mining licences and may perform exploration 

and exploitation work on them, subject to indemnification for damages to the owners of 

such parcel of land that may arise from such access, and the activities carried on by the 

holder of the mining licences. 

 

All of the subject mining licences are currently in good standing (Valdiri, 2010).

Note 1: Upon expiry of the licences, Calvista Colombia will be entitled to apply for a concession agreement 
covering the same areas as the expired licences.  In addition, under the current Law 1382 of 2010, Calvista 
Colombia is entitled to request the integration of all of the mining titles into a single concession agreement.  
Article 101 of Law 1382 of 2010 provides that different neighbouring mining titles, which have been granted 
for the same minerals and that belong to the same mineral deposit, may be integrated into a single 
concession agreement for the unified areas.  If a determination is made by the mining authorities that the 
integration of the mining titles is possible and complies with all legal and technical requirements, a unified 
concession agreement could be granted. The term of this unified agreement will be determined taking into 
account the term that has lapsed in the oldest mining title included in the integration.  The unified concession 
agreement may be for a maximum of 20 years subject to the conditions established in Law 1382 of 2010. 
 
Note 2: This licence was originally granted by Resolution 992226 dated October 27, 1997, and was 
registered at the National Mining Registry on June 8, 1998. Subsequently, the original resolution was 
amended by Resolution 1170-45 dated May 27, 2002. Pursuant to the notes in the Bucaramanga Mining 
Registry, the new resolution was registered at the National Mining Registry on July 23, 2003. Therefore, the 
expiry date of the licence would be July 13, 2013, renewable for a ten-year period upon request of the 
holder, or by conversion into a concession agreement governed by Law 685, which would extend its 
duration. Calvista Colombia has been informed that the Bucaramanga Mining Registry will request that the

National Mining Registry update its files to show the expiry of the licence as being July 23, 2013. This 
change is still in progress. 
 
Note 3: Note: The National Registry is currently showing the expiration of licence 0108-68 as being on 
October 8, 2010, ten years after its registration on October 8, 1998. However, an extension for an additional 
term of 10 years was requested in accordance with applicable laws, and the extension was granted by 
Resolution GTRB-0146 dated July 28, 2010, issued by INGEOMINAS.  Registration of this Resolution in the 
National Registry is in progress. As indicated in the legal opinion issued by Valdiri, this licence was properly 
extended, is in full force and effect, and expires on October 8, 2018. 
 

On March 12, 2010, Norvista with Calvista Gold, Calvista Colombia, a wholly owned 

subsidiary of Calvista Gold, Sociedad Minera La Baja California S.A.S. (Baja California), 

and Colombian individuals (the Miners) entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement 

(the Agreement), as amended, whereby the Miners agreed to sell, and Calvista 

Colombia agreed to purchase, all the Miners' rights, title, and interest in the subject 

licences for a purchase price payable as follows: 

• a cash consideration in the amount of US$2,155,908.54 due upon the closing of 
the transaction, 
 

• the issuance to Baja California, as designated by the Miners, of shares in the 
capital of Calvista Gold equal to 30% of the outstanding capital of Calvista Gold, 
and  
 

• a one-time payment of up to US$12,000,000 to be paid on the basis of $12 per 
proven and probable ounce of gold, to a maximum of 1,000,000 ounces 
estimated in a Technical Report within three years of the effective date of the 
Agreement.  

 

According to the terms of the Agreement, Calvista Gold has the option to make one or 

two additional, discretionary payments to the Miners on the 12th and 24th months for an 

aggregate amount of US$1,437,271.62 following the closing of the transaction, based on 

Calvista Gold's decision to continue or not development of the mining titles, in 

connection with which Calvista Gold has advanced US$52,000 to date. 

  

The transaction closed on June 10, 2010. As provided in the Agreement, the Miners 

delivered on the closing of the transaction fully executed copies of access and 

indemnification agreements relating to the lands covered by the mining titles. 

 

As of the effective date of this report, all of the mining titles are registered in the name of 

Calvista Colombia at the National Mining Registry.

On August 26, 2010, Calvista Colombia, also acquired an option to earn up to a 100% 

interest in licence 098-68 (El Sinu), subject to an NSR royalty payable on production, 

which option can be exercised by making aggregate cash payments of US$2,150,000 to 

the optionors, of which US$150,000 has been paid to date. The option can be exercised 

at any time by payment of US$2,000,000.  Upon exercise of the option, the parties will 

negotiate the terms of the NSR royalty based on the price of gold and silver at the time 

of production.

In addition to the payments listed in Table 4-2, Calvista Gold paid US$150,000 upon 

execution of the option agreement for licence 098-68 (El Sinu).  Calvista Gold is entitled 

to earn a 100% interest in licence 098-68 upon payment of an additional US$2,000,000. 
 

MINERAL LICENCES 
Mineral rights in Colombia are reserved to the federal government and governed by the 

Colombian Mining Code.  The Colombian Mining Code has been changed and amended 

on several occasions.  The oldest version relevant to the California Project is Decree 

2685 of 1988 (the Previous Mining Code), which has been replaced and superseded in 

its entirety by Law 685 of 2001, as amended by Law 1382 of 2010 (the Modified Mining 

Code). The mining law is administered by the Ministry of Mines and Energy which has 

relegated the administrative duties to INGEOMINAS (the Colombian Geological Survey 

Authority).

Exploitation Licences, as governed by Decree 2655 of 1988, are legal permits to exploit 

minerals in a map-staked area. These licences were granted for a term of ten years, and 

as provided in Article 46 of Decree 2655, it is possible for the title holder to opt for one of 

two options at the end of the ten-year period: (i) an extension of the Licence for another 

ten years, after which there is no legal possibility to extend the exploitation period, or (ii) 

conversion into a concession agreement, covering a map-staked area and in good 

standing for a period of up to thirty years, with additional extensions possible. Both 

Exploitation Licences and Concession Agreements are drawn using the UTM co-ordinate 

system. 

 

In Colombia, mineral concession agreements consist of three phases, namely, the 

exploration, construction and exploitation phases, and are governed by Law 685 of 2001 

as modified by Law 1382 of 2010.  Under the Modified Mining Code, the exploration 

phase is for a three-year period, which can be extended for up to four additional two-

year periods for a maximum of eleven years. During the exploration phase, annual 

surface payments, Cánon Superficiario (Cánon), are payable to the Colombian 

government on the basis of one minimum daily salary per hectare. The current cánon 

rate is COP 17,166 per hectare (approximately US$8.58/ha). The surface payment is 

calculated as one minimum daily wage per contracted hectare per year for the first five 

years of the exploration phase.  During years six and seven of the exploration phase, the 

payment increases to 1.25 minimum daily wages per contracted hectare per year, and in 

years eight to eleven it increases to 1.5 minimum daily wages per contracted hectare per 

year.  Upon completion of the exploration phase of a concession, the construction phase 

is for a period of three years and may be extended for a period of one year, after which it 

enters its exploitation phase, in which cánon fees are no longer payable but are replaced 

by a production royalty payable to the Colombian government. 

 

Regulation of Exploitation Licences, on the contrary, is not divided into three phases but 

consists of a single ten-year period in which exploitation can take place, and in which 

production royalties are payable to the Colombian government on the basis of grams 

extracted. No cánon fees are payable for Exploitation Licences.  Under Decree 2685 of 

1988, Exploration Licences were granted as a previous stage to the granting of an 

Exploitation Licence; under those, the title holder was entitled to explore the area for the 

purpose of determining the existence of mineral reserves, for a term of one to five years,

depending on the area to be explored. Exploitation Licences were granted for small-

scale mining not exceeding 250,000 m3 of extraction per year per licence. 

 

Of the licences which constitute the California Project, Exploitation Licences 0100-68, 

0108-68, 0109-68, and 0132-68 are in their second ten-year periods after which no 

extension is possible.  Within 30 days after a resolution by the mining authority is issued 

declaring such titles terminated, Calvista Colombia will be entitled to apply for a 

concession agreement covering the same areas as such expired licences. In addition, 

under the current Law 1382 of 2010, Calvista Colombia is entitled to request the 

integration of all of the mining titles into a single concession agreement.  Article 101 of 

Law 1382 of 2010 provides that different neighbouring mining titles, which have been 

granted for the same minerals and that belong to the same mineral deposit, may be 

integrated into a single concession agreement for the unified areas.  If a determination is 

made by the mining authorities that the integration of the mining titles is possible and 

complies with all legal and technical requirements, a unified concession agreement could 

be granted. The term of this unified agreement will be determined taking into account the 

term that has lapsed in the oldest mining title included in the integration. The unified 

concession agreement may be for a maximum of 20 years subject to the conditions 

established in Law 1382 of 2010.

Since the subject mining titles are licences, they are not subject to the annual surface 

payments, but production royalties are payable to the government. 

Figure 4-1 shows the location of the licences. 

 

ROYALTIES AND OTHER ENCUMBRANCES 
Scott Wilson RPA is not aware of any royalties, back-in rights, or other obligations 

related to the Agreement or underlying agreements. 

 

The government of Colombia requires the payment of a 4% gross royalty for gold, based 

on 80% of the closing price of the London Bullion Market for an effective rate of 3.2%, for 

any production from the subject licences. 

 

PERMITTING 
Early stages of exploration including geological mapping and stream or soil 

geochemistry do not require permitting. However, exploration activity involving soil 

disturbance, including trenching and road and drill pad construction, requires an 

environmental management plan and approval from the Corporación autónoma regional 

para la Defensa de la Meseta de Bucaramanga (CDMB).  Drilling requires a water use 

and return permit. 

 

Calvista Gold has submitted environmental management plans for the proposed work on 

licences 0100-68 and 0037-68 as well as on licences 14031 and 0108-68. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA understands that Calvista Gold has been granted all the required 

permits for surface exploration on the property, including soil disturbance and water use 

related to drilling, and that the permits are current. Calvista Gold initiated on-going water 

sampling and mitigation activities at the commencement of the drilling activities.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 
The California Project is located approximately 65 km by road from Bucaramanga, the 

capital city of the Department of Santander, which has a population of approximately 

1,250,000 in its metropolitan area.  Bucaramanga is serviced by daily flights from Bogota 

and Medellin.  The drive to the town of California takes approximately two hours, the first 

45 minutes of which are on two lane, paved roads and the remainder of which is on dirt 

roads of varying quality.  Access from the town of California to the northern mining titles 

comprising the California Project is via a dirt road which follows the valley of the Rio Baja 

de California.  Access to the southern mining titles is restricted to foot paths and horse 

trails.  

 

CLIMATE 
The climate of the California Project is cool and humid, with the average annual 

temperature ranging from 9°C to 11°C, with little seasonal change.  The average annual 

precipitation is about 750 mm, while the average annual evaporation is approximately 

1,300 mm. Without significant changes in temperature, the seasons are defined by 

variations in precipitation.  Two rainy seasons occur, from October to November and 

from April to May. Exploration activities are possible year round. 

 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
According to the Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE) census 

of 2005, the Municipality of California had a population of 1,783.  Very limited resources 

are available in the town of California including emergency medical services, temporary 

accommodations, and fuel. California has daily bus service from Bucaramanga. A 

greater range of services are available in Bucaramanga.  Any mining development on 

the project would have access to the national electrical transmission grid.  The town of

California is serviced by a power line from a substation in the nearby town of Matanza 

with a voltage of 34.5 kV and power of 5 MW. 

 

PHYSIOGRAPHY 
The project is located in steep, mountainous, and relatively rugged terrain at elevations 

ranging from about 2,000 m to 2,600 m ASL in the Quebrada La Baja drainage basin. 

The catchment area of the Quebrada La Baja drainage basin is approximately 124 km2 

above the town of California. The slopes are generally greater than 30°.  Valley floors 

are very limited, with slopes extending to the banks of the quebradas. 

 

Vegetation is described as light alpine scrub consisting of grasses and shrubs.  There is 

significant growth of oak and eucalyptus trees along the watercourses in areas that have 

not been deforested. 

 

The local vegetation supports only a limited level of agriculture and livestock pasture. 

The principle economic activity in the area is the small scale exploitation of gold and 

lesser agriculture and cattle grazing.

6 HISTORY 
Gold in the greater California district was reportedly discovered in 1549 during a Spanish 

military action, though the area had already been the site of mining by the indigenous 

Sura people in pre-Colombian times.  Spanish colonials engaged in two open pit 

operations in the district at San Antonio in the La Baja portion and at La Perezosa, to the 

northeast of the California Project (O'Prey, 2008b). 

 

Although small scale operations have taken place over the years on the various licences 

comprising the California Project, no records of this production appear to exist. 

 

GALWAY RESOURCES 2010 DRILLING 
At some time in 2010 prior to Calvista Gold's acquiring an option to earn an interest in 

licence 098-68 (El Sinu) Galway Resources Ltd. (Galway) is reported to have drilled ten 

holes from two set-ups on the property overlapping in part the eastern portion of the 

licence. These holes were drilled without the authorization of the holders of licence 098-

68 and administrative proceedings were subsequently initiated.  The reader is referred to 

Section 18 of this report for further discussion regarding administrative proceedings 

relating to Galway's drilling activities on licence 098-68. 

 

On September 8, 2010, Galway announced that drill hole GWY-39 returned 17.1 m 

grading 1.5 g/t Au and 22.9 g/t Ag, including 1.5 m of 4.4 g/t Au and 109.0 g/t Ag 

(www.galwayresources.com). The assay results of the other holes are not known.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
The following summary of the regional geology is taken from Thalenhorst (2008). 

 

The California Property is situated within the Eastern Cordillera in northeastern 

Colombia.  The Eastern Cordillera bifurcates at a point south of the Maracaibo Basin. 

The western branch swings to the northwest, while the eastern branch maintains the 

northeast trend and continues as the Sierra de Merida in Venezuela, to the east of the 

Maracaibo Basin (Figure 7-1). 

 

The western splay of the Cordillera includes the Santander Massif within which the 

California Project is located. The oldest rocks within the Santander Massif consist of 

Precambrian gneisses and schists that were part of the Guyana Shield. These rocks 

were regionally metamorphosed to upper amphibolite grade during dynamo-thermal 

metamorphism. Younger rocks of Paleozoic age occur in the region.  Diorite to granite 

composition intrusive rocks in the district belong to the Triassic-Jurassic Santander 

Plutonic Group.  Emplacement of these intrusives occurred during a period of uplift in the 

Triassic-Jurassic.  Younger porphyries are very common in the area and these may be 

as young as Tertiary (Felder et al., 2000). 

 

The structural/intrusive history of the area is summarized by Horner (2005). The 

Precambrian rocks were deformed sometime in the Paleozoic. During the Mesozoic, 

granitic to dioritic rocks intruded into the deformed Precambrian basement, and felsic to 

andesitic volcanic rocks were extruded.  At that time, part of the Eastern Cordillera was 

in a back-arc setting, and local basins formed and filled with marine-transgressive 

sediments. During Late Cretaceous to Paleocene/Eocene, folding and thrusting of the 

Eastern Cordillera resulted in basin inversion and uplift. The porphyry stock hosting 

some of the mineralization in the California area was intruded at this time. Uplift and 

erosion of the Eastern Cordillera, in particular the Santander Massif, occurred during 

Late Eocene to Early Oligocene time, with reactivation of older structures and continued 

uplift during the Middle to Late Miocene.

Finally, starting in the Late Miocene and continuing to the present, a major Andean 

deformation event is taking place with increased strike-slip faulting, extrusion, and 

escape of the triangle-shaped Maracaibo block to the north along the left-lateral 

Bucaramanga Fault (to its west) and the Boconó Fault system (to its south and 

southwest).  Basin inversion and rapid uplift are continuing.

LOCAL GEOLOGY 
The California Project area is underlain by rocks belonging to the Santander Massif. The 

constituent rocks can be grouped into two main lithological types: (i) complexly deformed 

rocks of high metamorphic grade including migmatites, and (ii) porphyritic intrusive 

bodies consisting of dykes and small stocks.  Cretaceous sedimentary rocks are found to 

the north of the village of California. 

Precambrian high grade metamorphic rocks include paragneiss, pelitic and arenaceous 

schists, hornblendic schists, and migmatites and are mapped as Bucaramanga Gneiss. 

Metamorphic rocks of low to medium grade metamorphism, including micaceous schists, 

phyllites, meta-sandstones, quartzites and marbles, correspond to the Silgará Formation, 

of Cambrian-Ordovician age. 

Several batholiths and plutons, with a composition ranging from granite to diorite, were 

intruded during the Jurassic-Triassic. Small stocks of porphyry, ranging from dacite to 

andesite in composition, and dikes of basalt, diabase, and dacite are related to this 

magmatic cycle. The sedimentary rocks are limited to certain areas of the Santander 

Massif. 

The local geology is shown in Figure 7-2.  The following descriptions of the local geology 

are taken from Mendoza and Jaramillo (1975). 

 

METAMORPHIC ROCKS – BUCARAMANGA GNEISS 
The main outcrops of fresh rock are only found in some creeks, particularly along La 

Baja River and Páez and Chicaguá creeks. The term migmatite is used in a descriptive 

sense rather than a genetic sense. Contact and age relationships permit the 

interpretation of two classes of migmatitic rocks. 

 
PALEOZOIC MIGMATITES 
Paleozoic migmatites are massive rocks with xenoblastic or granoblastic textures; the 

gneissic structure is defined by the sub parallel orientation of hornblende-biotite flakes, 

between bands or thick and irregular quartz and feldspar lenses with disseminated 

mafics. 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 

Calvista Gold Corporation – California Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011 

      

Page 7-5 

These migmatites show gneissic banding, sometimes of a cataclastic appearance, 

where one centimetre to four centimetre granitic bands of plagioclase, quartz, biotite, 

and orthoclase alternate with up to two centimetre bands rich in biotite and lesser 

plagioclase and quartz.  Locally sillimanite and plagioclase are partially sericitized.  

 

Hornblende-biotitic gneiss, medium to coarse grained, is composed of plagioclase (40-

60%), hornblende (10-26%), and, in a minor proportion, biotite (5-15%) and quartz (10-

20%). Small bodies of dark grey rock, with an appearance ranging from massive to 

slightly gneissic, and associated with the gneiss, could correspond to medium grained 

amphibolites, with corroded and saussuritized plagioclase crystals. 

 

Although a great part of the granite fraction of the migmatite forms lenses, masses of 

augen gneiss, in transition with lit-par-lit gneiss, can also be found locally. 

 

The composition of the lenses corresponds to a granodiorite or quartz diorite, of medium 

grain, observed in some places with cataclastic texture, and composed mainly of 

plagioclase (andesitic-calcic oligoclase), potassic feldspar (orthoclase with perthitic 

zones), quartz, altered hornblende, biotite, chlorite, and epidote. 

 

MESOZOIC MIGMATITES 
Mesozoic migmatites are developed around the Jurassic-Triassic intrusions.  Abundant 

granitic material is found as injection gneiss, crystallizing as concordant and sheet-like 

bands.  

 

Metamorphic rocks pertaining to the Bucaramanga Gneiss are included in the low 

pressure facies. The presence of minerals, such as andalusite, silimanite, and cordierite, 

the scarce quantity of garnet, and the lack of kyanite denote rocks of the cordierite-

amphibolite facies. In many cases, the rocks show evidence of retrograde 

metamorphism, being the principal effect of the alteration of sillimanite to muscovite and 

sericite, the saussuritization of the plagioclase, and the chloritization of the biotite. 

 

The composition and texture of the Mesozoic migmatites, lack of pelitic layers, and the 

volume of granitic material involved suggest an origin related to the magma injection.

IGNEOUS ROCKS 
The California intrusives can be divided into two petrographically different types. The 

oldest unit is composed of a quartz diorite with slight variations to granodiorite and 

diorite. The youngest unit includes granite, quartz monzonite and porphyry of 

granodiorite, of dacite and andesite composition. These rocks show indications of 

hydrothermal alteration. 

 
QUARTZ DIORITE 
The quartz diorite varies from massive to slightly gneissic. In general, it is medium 

grained, holocrystalline, speckled with white quartz and plagioclase, and black biotite 

and hornblende. Rocks of greenish-white colour with flakes of chloritized biotite and 

structure in bands, correspond to cataclastic quartz diorite.  Locally, the rock is found 

mineralized with sulphides, mostly pyrite, which is found in quartz veins and epidote, 

disseminated or sporadically associated with ferromagnesian elements. 

 
ALASKITE 
Igneous leucocratic rocks of fine to medium grain, of granite–quartz monzonite 

composition, are found widely distributed in the California area.  Locally, an increase in 

the content of biotite can be observed, with a granodioritic composition.  Due to the 

predominance of leucocratic rock, it is possible to use the term "alaskite" for rocks with a 

colour index of <5 and plagioclase of a composition between An:0 and An:35, covering 

the range of granite-quartz monzonite.   

 

Leucocratic rocks appear as small stocks, apophyses, and dikes. The California alaskite 

is characterized by hydrothermal alteration, mainly silicification and pyritization, and is 

cut by numerous quartz veinlets.  Around the La Baja location there is an alaskite body, 

locally cut by aplitic dikes and fine grained quartz monzonite.  Outcrops of relatively fresh 

rock can be found in the Agualimpia Creek area. 

 

Macroscopically, alaskite is holocrystalline, fine to medium grained, white or cream 

coloured, and dotted by iron oxides. Generally, it is composed of plagioclase, potassic 

feldspar, quartz, muscovite, and biotite.

Calvista Gold Corporation – California Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011 

      

Page 7-7 

Alaskite is generally found fractured and cut by numerous quartz veinlets; limonite and 

hematite occur in micro-factures and as ochre burnish. The scarce ferro-magnesium 

elements are leached, or replaced by muscovite–sericite flakes.  Several dikes of grey to 

pink rock, fine grained, with aplitic texture corresponding to a biotitic quartz monzonite 

(Los Curos type) cut the leucocratic granite.  Pegmatitic dikes are localized in the area of 

Chicaguá and San Juan creeks. 

 

Contacts between intrusive bodies and the hosting metamorphic rocks are tentative, and 

in places where rocks are frequently mixed, they are considered arbitrary.  Zones of 

diffuse contact are common when alaskites and quartz diorites are mixed. In these 

zones, the leucocratic intrusive is myrmekitic, the biotite is greater than 3%, plagioclase 

crystals present exsolution edges, and quartz occurs in elongated anhedral crystals. The 

abundance of biotite, possibly generated by the reaction between hornblende and an 

acid magma, and the high apatite content in the quartz diorite, suggest that the rock was 

affected by the leucocratic intrusive. 

 

The age of the California intrusives is not known definitively but is assumed to be 

Mesozoic because they are similar to other intrusives of the Santander Massif which 

have been dated. Several outcrops of quartz diorite are cut by leucocratic intrusives or 

found as hanging pendants in the alaskite. 

 
PORPHYRY 
Porphyritic rocks appear as dikes, sills, and small irregular shaped bodies. The term 

"porphyry" will be used to designate hypabyssal rock with more than 10% of the 

phenocrysts in a phaneritic holocrystalline matrix. 

 

In the California Project area, porphyritic rocks are common. Slight variations in 

composition and texture do not permit to determine if these porphyritic rocks correspond 

to the Jurassic-Triassic intrusive marginal phases, if they are bodies of a different 

generation, or if they are apophyses of the same intrusion. There is not sufficient 

evidence to distinguish intrusive rocks with aphanitic textures from extrusive rocks. For 

convenience, the porphyritic rocks are jointly described and grouped in two stocks.

The contacts between the different rocks and the porphyry bodies are somewhat 

arbitrary due to the lack of outcrops and to the hydrothermal alteration and associated 

weathering that have masked the original character of the rock. The irregular distribution 

of the outcrops with porphyritic rock suggests the presence of hypabyssal intrusives, 

emplaced as small dikes and stocks. Their close association with the intrusive bodies 

demonstrates that they are originated from the same magmatic source. The 

emplacement of the La Baja Stock could have been controlled by a possible branch of 

the Cucutilla Fault.  Veins such as San Celestino, Pié de Gallo, El Cuatro and La 

Mascota present outcrops related to this porphyry.  

 

SEDIMENTARY ROCKS 
Sedimentary rocks of Cretaceous age are found north of the town of California.  They 

are divided into two lithological units: the Tambor Formation and the Rosablanca 

Formation.  Both strike north-northwesterly and dip moderately to the west. 

 

Jurassic aged sedimentary rocks are not known in the area, although it is possible that 

the base of a sandstone sequence considered to be Lower Cretaceous may be older. 

 
TAMBOR FORMATION  
The main outcrops of the Tambor Formation are situated in the area of Higuera and 

Agualimpia creeks. Remnants of glauconitic and orthoquartzite sandstones are present 

in Chorreón Creek. 

 

The base of the Tambor Formation is composed by thin micaceous siltstone, of brown to 

reddish colour, alternating with benches of medium grained sandstones.  Overlying, 

there are feldspar-micaceous sandstones of medium to coarse grain, and conglomeratic 

lenses, with subangular to subrounded pebbles up to six centimetres long. Shale 

predominates at the top, with orthoquartzite intercalations.   

 

The Tambor Formation appears as a faulted contact, or an unconformity, overlaying 

intrusive and metamorphic rocks.

ROSABLANCA FORMATION 
Good limestone outcrops can be found in the area of La Venta Creek.  Limestone occurs 

at two horizons, separated by eight metres to ten metres of grey shale.  Although both 

horizons consist of massive limestone benches, the uppermost contains locally 

laminated marlstone cut by calcite veinlets. Towards the top, the detrital content 

increases, and limestone with fine grained calcareous sandstone of greenish-brown 

colour, with glauconite, occurs.  

 

The Rosablanca Formation appears to rest concordantly upon the Tambor Formation. 

 

STRUCTURE 
FAULTS 
A high proportion of the lineaments interpreted from aerial photography are oriented 

north-northeasterly, and probably some of them correspond to faults.  

 

The location of mineralized structures along the La Baja River suggests the presence of 

a structural belt with a northeast strike.  In the region, the presence of faults with pre- 

and post-Cretaceous movement has been demonstrated. The presence of a fault along 

the La Baja River, as a possible splay off the Cucutilla Fault, has been suggested. 

 

Cataclastic textures, accompanied by changes in the orientation and slope of joints 

along Chicaguá Creek, suggest faulting.  The intense alteration and brecciation of the 

Pié de Fallo dike indicates a faulted structure in the direction of San Juan Creek. 

 

A low angle reverse fault parallel to bedding is thought to displace the Tambor Formation 

over the Rosablanca Formation. 

 

High angle fault zones with slickensided surfaces and brecciated fragments usually 

correspond to quartz mineralized dikes.  

 
BRECCIA ZONES 
Irregularly distributed outcrops along Chorrerón Creek, occupying an area of 

approximately one square kilometre, have igneous and sedimentary rocks with 

hydrothermal alteration and a brecciated aspect.

Sedimentary rock fragments include quartz ferruginous sandstones, a matrix formed by 

amorphous brown-reddish material, including subangular and subrounded fractured 

quartz fragments. Aggregates and sericite flakes, stained by iron oxides, fill fracture 

zones and replace some slightly deformed crystals, possibly feldspar.  Igneous rock of a 

granodiorite composition can be found in the area of Chorrerón Creek.  The rock, with 

cataclastic deformation and deuteric alteration, has veins of epidote and orthoclase 

inside quartz and plagioclase. Quartz is anhedral, fractured, and intergrown with 

orthoclase.  The rock also contains altered hornblende crystals, chlorite, and iron oxides. 

 
FOLDS 
It is possible to observe small scale folding in some sandstones layers locally.  

Northwest of California, there is a synclinal structure with a north-south axis. The 

structure could possibly be related to the overthrust of the Tambor Formation over the 

Rosablanca Formation. 

 
JOINTS 
Two joint sets are developed.  The predominant set strikes between N 40º W and N 70º 

W, while the subordinate set strikes N 80º W to east–west.

PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
From September 28 to October 28, 2010, Calvista Gold completed reconnaissance 

mapping of the three northern blocks.  Figures 7-3 and 7-4 depict the property geology 

of the Jaramalla (100-68)–Callejon Blanco (0037-68)–El Sinu (098-68) licences, and the 

Tesorito (0108-68)–Buenavista (14031) licences, respectively. The following descriptions 

of the lithologies and structure are taken from Pelletier (2010a and 2010b). 

 

LITHOLOGIES 
The host rocks are mainly gneissic with some granodioritic zones located along the 

major fault zones. The extent and shape of the intrusives are not yet defined. 

 
PARAGNEISS 
The gneiss is a banded paragneiss containing interstratified bands of leucocratic and 

melanocratic material, suggesting a sedimentary origin. The paragneiss is mostly 

quartzo-feldspathic in composition with hornblende-rich bands.  It is regionally deformed 

and is more highly deformed in proximity to fault zones. 

 

The quartzo-feldspathic (leucocratic) gneiss consists of pale grey, fine to medium 

grained, homogeneous layers. The composition is quite variable and consists of 30-40% 

plagioclase, 20-30% potassium feldspar, 30-40$ quartz and 0-2% hornblende. The 

hornblende (melanocratic) layers are dark, fine to medium grained, and homogeneous. 

They consist of 70-90% hornblende, 5-15% plagioclase, 5-10% quartz, 0-5% potassium 

feldspars, and 0-2% magnetite. 

 
GRANODIORITE 
This unit is a felsic intrusion displaying two distinct phases: fine to medium grained 

granodiorite and porphyritic granodiorite. 

 

The fine to medium grained granodiorite is light pinkish grey in colour and corresponds 

to a contact phase of the intrusive body. It is composed of 30% whitish plagioclase (1 

mm to 2 mm), 10% pinkish orthoclase (1 mm to 8 mm), 2% hornblende (1 mm to 2 mm) 

and 58% quartzo-feldspathic matrix.

Calvista Gold Corporation – California Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011 

      

Page 7-13 

The porphyritic granodiorite is pinkish grey in colour and corresponds to the core of the 

intrusive body.  It is composed of 6% pinkish, porphyritic orthoclase (1 cm to 6 cm), 4% 

greyish-green porphyritic plagioclase (1 cm to 6 cm), 60% whitish plagioclase (1 mm to 8 

mm) 2% black hornblende (1 mm to 2 mm) and 48% greyish, quartzo-feldspathic matrix. 

 
FELSIC DYKES 
The felsic dykes were only observed on the Buenavista property. They are beige to pale 

grey in colour, fine to medium grained, homogeneous and centimetric in width. They 

exhibit irregular shapes and widths, intruding breccias along a fault zone. They are 

hosted by paragneiss. 

 

Compositionally, they are similar to the granodiorite but contain more hornblende and 

less quartz. They are composed of 60-65% plagioclase, 20-25% potassium feldspar, 

10% quartz, and 0-10% hornblende. The dyke cross-cuts the gneissosity and has a 

different composition than the leucocratic layers of paragneiss. 

 

STRUCTURE 
The structural system appears to correspond to northeast-southwest, left-lateral regional 

shear zone, generating primary east-west conjugate and secondary north-south 

conjugate shears. These structures create rectangular blocks, which potentially host an 

excellent environment for gold mineralization.  Dilation zones found at the junctions of 

these faults created potential conduits for the hydrothermal fluid.  There appears to be a 

relationship between the amount of sulphide dissemination and gold concentration.  

 

Figures 7-5 and 7-6 are Pelletier's (2010b) structural interpretation of the Jaramalla–

Callejon Blanco–El Sinu and Buenavista–Tesorito areas, respectively. 

 
JARAMALLA–CALLEJON BLANCO–EL SINU 
The mineralization is associated with a sinistral northeast-southwest oriented shear zone 

resulting in east-west synthetic conjugate and north-south antithetic conjugate faults. 

 

The northeast to southwest oriented structures form a group of parallel faults, the most 

important of which are five metres to 15 m wide and exhibit intense fracturing.  Some

Page 7-14 

segments of the fault zone are sufficiently brecciated to display strong silicification and 

phyllic alteration accompanied by copper and gold mineralization. 

 

On the Callejon Blanco (037-68) and El Sinu (098-68) licences, artisanal mines are 

related to northeast to southwest trending structures. Secondary east-west oriented 

faults exhibit weak to strong silicification attaining one metre to six metres in width. 

 

On the Jaramalla (100-68) licence, the northwest to southeast oriented faults exhibit 

silicification, phyllic alteration, and oxidation zones from 0.5 m to two metres in width. 

Locally, mineralization is related to iron sulphides–oxides–hydroxides within fault breccia 

zones oriented northwest to southeast and changing to north-south. 

 

The northeast to southwest structures dip from 60° north to 90°, while the east-west fault 

zones dip at 70° to 90°. 

 
BUENAVISTA–TESORITO 
The north end of the Buenavista property (14031) is cross-cut by the Mercedes and 

Asseradero northeast-southwest trending structures.  These structures are in turn cut by 

an east-west fault system in the central part of the Buenavista property.  In the eastern 

part of the Buenavista property, a one metre to two metre wide silicified structure yields 

high grades.  This structure exhibits strong clay and phyllic alteration with strong 

oxidation giving a reddish-purple colour to the exposures. There is a positive relationship 

between gold and the amount of disseminated sulphides. 

 

In the central part of the Buenavista property, a group of three east to west oriented, 

parallel faults host a mineralized zone over a width of 30 m. The hangingwall (north side) 

of this structural zone is characterized by strong phyllic to argillic alteration with local 

disseminated pyritic zones. The central portion of the structural zone exhibits weak 

phyllic alteration with local silicification and minor pyrite. The footwall (south side) of the 

structural zone is silicified, with pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralization associated with 

fault breccias.

The dips on the east-west faults are steep north to vertical (70°-90°) and the dips of the 

northeast to southwest and the northwest to southeast structures are also steep to 

vertical (60°-90°). 

 

On the Tesorito property, the artisanal mines are related to two families of subparallel 

structures oriented east-northeast to west-southwest (tension gashes) and northwest to 

southeast (antithetic join), respectively. The fault strikes are different from those on the 

other California Project properties. The mineralization is located in a series of parallel 

structures (tension gashes) located between the two main faults

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
Based on Re-Os isotope systematics, Mathur et al. (2003) interpret the gold 

mineralization from the California district to be of the high-sulphidation epithermal type. 

The following description of high-sulphidation epithermal mineralization is abstracted 

from Taylor (2006). 

 

Epithermal Au (±Ag) deposits form in the near-surface environment, from hydrothermal 

systems typically within 1.5 km of the Earth's surface. They are commonly found 

associated with centres of magmatism and volcanism but also form in shallow marine 

settings. Hot-spring deposits and both liquid- and vapour-dominated geothermal systems 

are commonly associated with epithermal deposits. 

 

Epithermal Au deposits are distinguished on the basis of the sulphidation state of the 

sulphide mineralogy as belonging to one of three subtypes: (1) high-sulphidation 

(previously called quartz-(kaolinite)-alunite, alunite-kaolinite, enargite-Au, or high 

sulphur; (2) intermediate-sulphidation; or (3) low-sulphidation (previously called adularia- 

sericite). 

 

High-sulphidation subtype deposits usually occur close to magmatic sources of heat and 

volatiles, and form from acidic hydrothermal fluids containing magmatic S, C, and Cl. 

 

High-sulphidation alteration mineral assemblages are characterized by alunite, kaolinite, 

pyrophyllite, sericite, adularia (illite), chlorite, and barite.  Native Au, electrum, tellurides, 

and base metal sulphides characterize high-sulphidation mineral assemblages. 

 

Quartz is the predominant gangue mineral in all epithermal Au deposits, whereas 

distinctive ore and gangue minerals characterize high-sulphidation and low-sulphidation 

deposit subtypes. Mineralogical zoning around veins or replacement zones may be 

present in both subtypes, recording chemical and/or thermal gradients. Both subtypes of 

deposits can contain very fine-grained Au and gangue mineral assemblages, especially 

in hot-spring and steam-heated environments that form above boiling hydrothermal 

systems. 

 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 

Calvista Gold Corporation – California Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011 

      

Page 8-2 

In high-sulphidation deposits, native Au and electrum are typically associated with 

pyrite+enargite±covellite±bornite±chalcocite. In addition to sulphosalts and base metal 

sulphides, tellurides and bismuthinite are present in some deposits. Total sulphide 

contents are generally higher in high-sulphidation than in low-sulphidation subtype 

deposits. Where base metals are present in high-sulphidation deposits, the Cu 

abundance can vary significantly (<<0.1-5%), and typically dominate that of Zn. Principal 

gangue minerals include quartz ('vuggy silica'), alunite, barite (especially associated with 

Au), and, in some deposits, S; manganese minerals and fluorite are rare. Calcite is not 

characteristic of high-sulphidation subtype deposits due to the high acidity of the 

hydrothermal fluids. 

 

Vuggy silica has a porous texture formed by removal of minerals, particularly feldspars, 

during reaction with very acidic fluids and concentration of residual silica. Massive, 

quartz-rich zones may result from further silicification (i.e., by addition of silica).  In high-

sulphidation deposits, coarse-grained alunite is characteristic, whereas alunite from 

steam-heated zones (high-sulphidation subtype caps to epithermal systems), and from 

supergene weathering of sulphide deposits, is typically very fine grained to 

microcrystalline. 

 

High-sulphidation deposits of magmatic hydrothermal origin are typically of smaller 

dimension than low-sulphidation deposits, and are found in close proximity to, and often 

topographically above, a related source of magmatic heat and volatiles. Shallow, steam-

heated environments, in contrast, may produce widespread altered areas, typically (but 

not always) barren.  Bulk-tonnage mining of these zones may be possible if they are 

mineralized.  

 

The morphology of epithermal vein-style deposits can be quite variable. Deposits may 

consist of roughly tabular lodes controlled by the geometry of the principal faults they 

occupy, or comprise a host of interrelated fracture fillings in stockwork, breccia, lesser 

fractures, or, when formed by replacement of rock or void space, they may take on the 

morphology of the lithologic unit or body of porous rock (e.g., irregular breccia pipes and 

lenses) replaced. Volumes of rock mineralized by replacement may be discordant and 

irregular, or concordant and tabular, depending on the nature of porosity, permeability, 

and water-rock interaction. In deposits of very near-surface origin, an upward 



SCOTT WILSON RPA www.scottwilson.com 
 

 

 

Calvista Gold Corporation – California Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011 

      

Page 8-3 

enlargement of the volume of altered and mineralized rocks may be found centred about 

the hydrothermal conduits.  Hot-spring deposits tend to comprise subhorizontal aprons 

or lenses of sinter about their upflow zones and subhorizontal replacement zones in the 

shallow subsurface. Phreatic eruptions produce discordant zones of breccia-like 

deposits, where clasts may be partially rounded. 

 

Brecciation of previously emplaced veins can form permeable zones along irregularities 

in fault planes: vertically plunging mineralized zones in faults with strike-slip motion and 

horizontal mineralized zones in dip-slip faults.  Topographic (i.e., paleosurface) control of 

boiling by hydrostatic pressure can also result in horizontal or subhorizontal mineralized 

zones, limiting the vertical distribution of mineralization. The distribution of high-

sulphidation alteration in steam-heated settings may also reflect a topographic control of 

the paleo-water table. 

 

Nearly any rock type, even metamorphic rocks, may host epithermal Au deposits, 

although volcanic, volcaniclastic, and sedimentary rocks tend to be more common. 

Typically, epithermal deposits are younger than their enclosing rocks, except in the 

cases where deposits form in active volcanic settings and hot springs. Here, the host 

rocks and epithermal deposits can be essentially synchronous with spatially associated 

intrusive or extrusive rocks, within the uncertainty of the determined ages in some cases 

(e.g., high-sulphidation Summitville deposit, Colorado). 

 

Gold:silver ratios of epithermal Au deposits may vary widely both between and within 

deposits, from 0.5 for the high-sulphidation type Kasuga deposit, Japan, for example, to 

>>500 in the Cerro Rico de Potosi deposit, Peru.  Differing magmatic metal budgets and 

depths of formation have been suggested to influence this ratio. Typically, Ag:Au ratios 

for epithermal deposits, though variable, tend to be higher in low-sulphidation deposits 

than in high-sulphidation deposits. 

 

In both high-sulphidation and low-sulphidation deposit subtypes, hydrothermal alteration 

mineral assemblages are commonly regularly zoned about vein- or breccia-filled fluid 

conduits, but may be less regularly zoned in near-surface environments or where 

permeable rocks have been replaced. Characteristic alteration mineral assemblages in 

both deposit subtypes can give way to propylitically altered rocks containing

Page 8-4 

quartz+chlorite+albite+carbonate±sericite, epidote, and pyrite. The distribution and 

formation of the earlier formed propylitic mineral assemblages generally bears no 

obvious direct relationship to ore-related alteration mineral assemblages. 

 

Advanced argillic alteration mineral assemblages that characterize high-sulphidation 

deposits include quartz+kaolinite+alunite+dickite+pyrite in and adjacent to veins or 

zones of replacement in the magmatic - hydrothermal environment.  Pyrophyllite occurs 

in place of kaolinite at the higher temperatures and pressures of deeper deposits. In 

some outer zones, argillic (smectite) ± sericite mineral assemblages may occur. These 

alteration minerals indicate a very low pH hydrothermal environment (possibly below 

even that for alunite stability), of high oxidation state (hematite and sulphate are stable). 

Zones of silica replacement and 'vuggy silica' are characteristic, and carbonates are 

absent.  Topaz and tourmaline in high-temperature zones indicate the presence of F and 

B in the acidic hydrothermal fluids. 

 

Acid-sulphate (high-sulphidation) type alteration fluids form by the dissolution of large 

amounts of magmatic SO2 in high-temperature hydrothermal systems, and also by 

reaction of host rocks with steam-heated meteoric waters acidified by oxidation of H2S 

(probably of magmatic origin) or by dissolution of CO2.  Two contemporaneous fluids are 

typically found to have been significant in epithermal Au deposits, and particularly in the 

high-sulphidation subtype. These are a saline fluid (typically ~10-40 wt.% NaCleq) found 

often in the deeper portion of the hydrothermal system, associated with mineralized 

zones, and a low-density (<10% NaCleq) fluid more commonly found in the upper part of 

the hydrothermal system.  The more saline fluids are often interpreted to have evolved 

from magmatic fluids and to have transported the metals to meteoric-water dominated 

geothermal system. In rare situations where recharge of surficial waters is limited (e.g., 

<10 Ma, Andes), magmatic waters may dominate throughout.  Lower acidity, highly 

saline fluids are thought responsible for intermediate sulphidation deposits typically rich 

in base metal and Fe sulphide minerals.

9 MINERALIZATION 
The following description of the typical mineralization of the California mining district is 

taken from Mathur et al. (2003).  Figure 9-1 is an idealized geologic cross-section 

illustrating the simplified geologic relationships of the area. 

 

Gold is located along faults that cross-cut sedimentary and igneous wall rocks intruded 

by dacite porphyry. Mineralized veins also cross-cut the altered dacite porphyry.  Ore 

mineralogy consists of high-sulphidation assemblages.  Alteration assemblages of this 

high-sulphidation system consist of quartz-alunite and an element enrichment spectrum 

of Au, Ag, Te, Bi, As, Sb, and locally W. 

 

The mineralogy of the epithermal gold deposits is highly diverse. In general, gold-rich 

pyrite is the major ore mineral in the California district and constitutes 80-90% of the 

mineralization.  Cu sulphides, Cu-Bi sulphides, and various tellurides including Au 

tellurides, Au-Ag tellurides, hessite, Te-bearing tetrahedrite-tennantite, and native Te 

occur.  Native Au is commonly enclosed in pyrite, tetrahedrite, and bornite.  W-bearing 

phases, such as Cu-W sulphides and huebnerite, may be locally abundant and the 

alteration halo of mineralized veins consists of alunite, jarosite, kaolinite, and quartz. 

Phyllic and propylitic alteration has also been described. 

 

The main mineralized structure strikes northeasterly and consists of discrete and 

sheeted composite veins. 

 

Mendoza and Jaramillo (1975) have recognized four types of quartz veining in the 

California area: 

1. Fine to medium grained white quartz veining. Generally, these veins contain no 
sulphides and are found in all rocks types. These are milky quartz veins, with 
thicknesses between one metre and two metres, which could be crossed by 
veins and veinlets of grey quartz with sulphides. 
 

2. Quartz veinlets and veins, white to clear grey colour, with granular pyrite with 
some gold values, occupying cracks and cutting the host rock in different 
directions (stockwork); apparently related to joint systems.  Usually they are veins 
one to five centimetre thick, white-grey colour, with anhedral quartz locally 
forming mosaics between sericite aggregates. The feldspar is anhedral to 
fractured subhedral, and partially sericitized. When the host rock is cut by quartz 
and pyrite veins, it is altered and changes to greyish-white colour, and is

essentially composed of anhedral quartz (80%) and plagioclase (10%) as 
sericitized anhedral crystals. The pyrite is subhedral to anhedral, and occurs 
mainly in veinlets, with lesser disseminations. 

 
3. Quartz–feldspar veins, with aplitic texture, present in irregular shapes and 

thicknesses, and usually branching out into the adjacent rock.  Locally the 
sulfides occur in lenses up to 50 cm thick.  These veins usually occur in alaskites, 
closely associated with zones of silicification. In metamorphic rocks, these veins 
cross-cut the foliation, and exhibit a slightly greenish colour. Mafic host rocks 
exhibit chloritization and epidotization, or replacement by sulphides. 

 
4. Grey quartz veins, of massive aspect and brecciated texture, containing rock 

fragments, quartz, and feldspar in a grey cryptocrystalline matrix, with 
disseminated sulphides. This is the main gold bearing rock in the area.  The 
thickness varies from a few centimetres to several metres. 

 
5. These veins can be found in fractured and sheared zones, and are commonly 

related to apophyses or porphyritic dikes.  In spite of their dip and variable 
thickness, veins can show a fairly continuous along strike.

ALTERATION 
The following is taken from Mendoza and Jaramillo (1975). 

 

Four types of alteration have been established: argillaceous, propylitic, sericite, and 

silicification. In spite of the overlapping between the different types of alteration, the 

greater development of one type over another depends on the rock composition and the 

degree of fracturing.  

 
ARGILLACEOUS ALTERATION 
This type of alteration varies from a slight alteration of feldspar to minerals with a clayish 

aspect, to a more advanced alteration state. Generally, the dikes contain clay altered 

minerals, such as quartz, pyrite, and sericite.  Some dikes contain alunite and enargite, a 

group of minerals that represent an advanced argillaceous alteration state. The 

presence of alunite in quartz dikes without molybdenum suggests this mineral is of 

supergene origin. 

 
PROPYLITIC ALTERATION 
The propylitic alteration includes minerals such as chlorite, epidote, calcite, etc., and 

generally appears distal from the mineralization centres. The rocks (quartz diorite and 

porphyry) show partially sericitized plagioclase, in part with cores of saussuritization. 

Ferromagnesian minerals are altered or replaced by chlorite and epidote, and these 

minerals could be surrounded, or replaced, by pyrite. Quartz is accessory and 

sometimes abundant apatite is found integrated in the biotite.  

 
SERICITE ALTERATION 
The presence of minerals such as sericite, quartz, and pyrite indicates that the sericite 

alteration affects large zones of the region and appears to be a predominant alteration 

type. Its intensity varies from narrow zones limited to the veins, to zones of several 

metres, mainly in the alaskite. The rock is crossed by numerous quartz veinlets, in some 

places with iron and copper sulphides, and exhibits sericitized plagioclase and potassic 

feldspar.  In fracture zones, there are nests of yellowish–brown biotite, sometimes 

partially chloritized or with sporadic epidote cores. Pyrite is found disseminated and 

associated mainly with aggregates and flakes of muscovite.

Page 9-5 

SILICIFICATION 
Since the deposit of sulphides is accompanied by silica precipitation, the silicification is 

frequently associated to other types of alteration and is the result of the action of the 

solutions over a wide range of environments. Generally, sericite alteration and 

silicification are accompanied by pyrite; therefore areas like these can be regarded as 

"phyllic alteration". A fringe of approximately two kilometres in length, extending at the 

east border of the La Baja River, exhibits intensively silicified rocks, locally with abundant 

pyrite, which produce free sulphur by oxidation that appears mixed with limonite. 

 

Locally, and within this fringe, Mendoza and Jaromillo (1975) found rocks with abundant 

disseminated pyrite, chalcopyrite in veinlets, and sometimes small malachite spots.

10 EXPLORATION 
With the exception of a limited amount of drilling by Galway on Calvista Gold's Licence 

098-68 (El Sinu) in 2010 as described in Section 6 of this report, there are no known 

records of exploration on the California Project licences prior to their acquisition by 

Calvista Gold.  Artisanal mining is currently taking place, or has taken place, on all the 

California Project mining titles.  Prior to Calvista Gold's involvement, the mining titles 

have not had the benefit of modern exploration techniques.  

 

In July 2010, Calvista Gold initiated an exploration program consisting of geological 

mapping, diamond drilling, and airborne geophysical surveying. To date, Calvista Gold 

has spent approximately $2,409,000 on exploration on the California Project. 

 

GEOLOGICAL MAPPING 
From September 28 to October 28, 2010, Calvista Gold completed a reconnaissance 

mapping and prospecting program on the two northern blocks.  Aspects of Calvista 

Gold's geological mapping program are described in Section 7 of this report.  A total of 

61 rock chip samples were taken and submitted for analysis.  Table 10-1 lists the 

locations and results of Calvista Gold's rock chip sampling program. 

 

Several samples returned significant gold values (up to 68.13 g/t Au) and more detailed 

sampling in the vicinity of those samples is warranted.

DIAMOND DRILLING 
From July 21, 2010 to the effective date of this report, Calvista Gold completed 14 holes 

totalling 4,786.89 m. Aspects of Calvista Gold's diamond drilling program are described 

in Sections 11 to 14 of this report. 

 

AIRBORNE GEOPHYSICS 
Calvista Gold contracted MPX Geophysics Ltd. (MPX) of Markham, Ontario, to complete 

a detailed helicopter-borne, combined magnetic and radiometric survey over all of the 

subject licences and intervening areas.  MPX installed the geophysical instruments on a 

Bell Long Ranger helicopter (HK 4181) temporarily chartered from Helifly Colombia in

Bucaramanga on November 5. The survey was hampered by bad weather and was 

flown from November 9 to 13. The survey flight lines were oriented at an azimuth of 149° 

and were spaced at 200 m intervals. Tie lines were flown at 1,000 m intervals, 

perpendicular to the flight lines.  A total of 216 line-km of surveying was flown. 

 

Because of the steepness of the terrain and the presence of power lines, MPX was 

unable to fly at the recommended 70 m height above terrain.  Consequently, the 

radiometric data is compromised as the elevation changes were too great for accurate 

radiometric data collection. 

 

As of the effective date of this report, the results of the survey are being processed and 

have not yet been interpreted.  Figure 10-1 shows the area of the survey.

11 DRILLING 
From July 21, 2010 to November 14, 2010, Calvista Gold completed a first phase of 

drilling consisting of 14 diamond drill holes totalling 4,786.89 m. The purpose of the 

drilling was to test mineralized structures on the Jaramalla (100-68)–Callejon Blanco 

(0037-68)–El Sinu (098-68) licences and on the Buenavista (14031) licence. Table 11-1 

lists the holes completed by Calvista Gold and Figures 11-1 and 11-2 illustrate the collar 

locations on the Jaramalla–Callejon Blanco and Buenavista licences, respectively.

The drilling was contracted to Kluane Colombia (Kluane) of Bogota, a subsidiary of 

Whitehorse-based Kluane Drilling Ltd.  Kluane supplied two lightweight KD-600, 

hydraulic drills. Holes were collared with HTW (71.04 mm diameter) drill core and 

reduced to NTW (56.23 mm diameter) core and further to BTW (42.13 mm) core as 

drilling conditions dictated. The drills were moved manually between drill sites. Calvista 

Gold contracted a local exploration services company, Sociedad Minera La Baja 

California S.A.S. (La Baja), to construct trails and drill platforms, perform site clearing

drill sites.  La Baja will also rehabilitate the drill sites upon completion of the drilling. 

 

Drill collars were spotted using hand-held GPS instruments. All UTM coordinates are 

reported in the Bogota Observatory datum. Subsequent to the drilling, all drill hole collars 

were surveyed with differential GPS instrumentation.  

 

All holes were drilled perpendicular to the mineralized structures. On the Jaramalla–

Callejon Blanco–El Sinu licences, the holes were generally drilled from northwest to 

southeast, but CAL-02 was drilled to the northwest.  On the Buenavista licence, the 

holes were drilled from south-southeast to north-northwest.  Hole CAL-08 was drilled 

from north to south.  Hole dips varied from -60° to -77°.  The core was brought to the 

core logging facility in California on a daily basis by La Baja personnel. 

 

The attitude of the holes at depth was determined by taking azimuth and dip readings 

nominally at 30 m intervals. In holes CAL-01 to CAL-05, the readings were taken once 

the holes were completed using a Flex-It instrument.  From hole CAL-06 and onwards, 

readings were taken with a Reflex instrument as the hole was being advanced.  As of 

the effective date of this report, the true width of the intersections has not yet been 

estimated. 

 

A Calvista Gold technician was present at the drill at all times.  The technician quick 

logged and photographed the core with a digital camera at the drill site and reported to 

the geologist by telephone in the event of drilling problems.  A Calvista Gold geologist 

was present at the drill for the termination of each hole. Upon completion, the drill 

casings were pulled if possible. 

 

Drill holes CAL-01, -03, -04, -06, -07, -08, -10, and -12 were abandoned prior to reaching 

their proposed depths because of difficult drilling conditions. 

 

Table 11-2 lists the significant intersections achieved by Calvista Gold.

Note: Calvista Colombia also drilled hole CAL-09 in addition to those listed in the table above. Subsequent 
to the completion of the drilling, an order was issued by INGEOMINAS Bucaramanga determining that the 
area covered by licence 098-68 is different than originally contemplated. As a result, Calvista Colombia 
drilled in lands predominantly owned by third parties. Accordingly, the results of drill hole CAL-09 have not 
been incorporated into this report. The owners of licence 098-68 are in the process of disputing 
INGEOMINAS Bucaramanga's resolution. See Section 18 of this report.

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
Mineralization in the California district principally occurs as a series of north-northwest 

dipping parallel vein zones, breccias, and mineralized faults. These mineralized 

structures are hosted within altered and variably silicified gneiss and intrusive rocks. 

 

As indicated in Section 11, a Calvista Gold technician was present at the drill at all times 

while the drill was operational. The technician monitored the drilling, verified that the 

metreage markers inserted by the drillers were correct, and quick logged and 

photographed the core. The technician also ensured that the core boxes are properly 

secured for transportation to the core logging and sampling facility in California. 

 

Drill core was placed sequentially in metallic core boxes at the drill. The core boxes were 

transported by La Baja personnel on a daily basis to the core logging and sampling 

facility. The core logging and sampling facility is located on a fenced property with 24 

hour security present.  At the core logging facility, depth markers and box numbers were 

carefully checked, the core was reconstructed, and core recoveries and rock quality 

designation (RQD) were calculated. The core was then photographed with a digital 

camera again. 

 

The core is descriptively logged and marked for sampling by Calvista Gold geologists 

paying particular attention to lithologies, structure, alteration, and mineralization. Logging 

and sampling information was entered into a spreadsheet-based template which could 

be easily integrated into the project digital database.  Logging and sampling was done 

using metric measurements.  The logging was done in Spanish and Calvista Gold is in 

the process of having all the logs translated into English. 

 

The entire length of the drill holes was sampled, with samples generally on the order of 

1.50 m in length, but with individual samples up to 3.05 m in length.  Shorter core sample 

intervals were selected based on visible mineralization and geological contacts.  

Samples in mineralized sections are as short as 0.23 m in length. Core marked for 

sampling was sawn in half.  Half the sampled core was returned to the box and the other 

half was placed in a plastic bag.  A sample tag was placed in the bag and the bag was

sealed with a uniquely numbered zip tie that corresponded to the sample number. 

Sample numbers were marked in the core boxes with a black, indelible ink marker. The 

plastic sample bags were placed in larger rice bags and sealed for shipping. 

 

All the core from Calvista Gold's drilling is kept on site at the secure core logging and 

sampling facility. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the core logging and sampling were done to 

industry standards.

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 
As described in Section 12, core from the California Project was delivered to the core 

logging and sampling facility in California by La Baja personnel on a daily basis.  Once at 

the core logging and sampling facility, the core was logged, marked for sampling, sawn, 

and bagged by Calvista Gold personnel. 

 

Drill core samples for analysis were placed and sealed in larger rice bags and stored in a 

secure area prior to shipping.  The core shack was either under the direct supervision of 

Calvista Gold staff or guarded by private security personnel at all times.  The sample 

storage area is locked at all times.  A sample transmittal form was prepared that 

identified the samples shipped and the analytical procedure requested and assigned a 

unique order number for tracking.  The samples were delivered by Calvista Gold 

personnel directly to SGS' sample preparation facility in Medellin on a regular basis. 

Sample pulps were back hauled to the core logging facility in California by Calvista Gold 

personnel and locked in the sample storage area. 

 

In Medellin, the samples were crushed in a two step process to 95% < 10 mesh and a 

250 g split was then pulverized to 95% < 140 mesh. The pulps were then shipped to 

SGS' laboratory in Lima, Peru, for analysis. In Lima, 50 g charges were analyzed for 

gold by fire assay with a gravimetric finish (SGS lab code FAG 505). In addition, the 

samples were analyzed for a suite of 49 elements by Inductively Coupled Plasma–

Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and Inductively Couple Plasma–Mass 

Spectroscopy (ICP-MS) after a four acid digestion (SGS lab code ICM 40B). 

 

Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the sample preparation, analyses, and security 

meet or exceed industry standards.

14 DATA VERIFICATION 
Paul Chamois, P. Geo., Senior Consulting Geologist with Scott Wilson RPA and an 

independent QP, visited the property on October 20 to 21, 2010.  During the visit, core 

from the 2010 drilling program was inspected, and samples from holes CAL-01, -03, and 

-04 were marked out and duplicate samples taken under Mr. Chamois' supervision. 

 

The duplicate samples were chosen on the basis of gold values achieved in Calvista 

Gold's sampling.  The specified samples were quarter sawn and the samples were then 

bagged, tagged, and sealed in a larger rice bag and remained in Mr. Chamois' 

possession for the trip home.  The samples were then sent to the SGS Minerals Services 

Lab (SGS) in Don Mills, Ontario, by courier.  SGS is accredited to the ISO 17025 

Standard by Certificate number 456. 

 

The samples were dried, crushed to 75% passing 2 mm, split to 250 g, and pulverized to 

85% passing 75 µm according to SGS's sample preparation lab code PRP89.  Fifty gram 

charges were analyzed for gold by fire assay with an Inductively Coupled Plasma–

Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) finish (SGS lab code FAI515). Table 14-1 

lists those samples taken for duplicate analysis and the corresponding results.

The Certificate of Analysis for Scott Wilson RPA's samples can be found in Section 24, 

Appendix 1 of this report. 

 

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
Quality assurance (QA) consists of evidence to demonstrate that the assay data has 

precision and accuracy within generally accepted limits for the sampling and analytical 

method(s) used in order to have confidence in a resource estimate.  Quality control (QC) 

consists of procedures used to ensure that an adequate level of quality is maintained in 

the process of collecting, preparing, and assaying the exploration drilling samples.  In 

general, QA/QC programs are designed to prevent or detect contamination and allow 

assaying (analytical) precision (repeatability) and accuracy to be quantified.  In addition, 

a QA/QC program can disclose the overall sampling–assaying variability of the sampling 

method itself. 

 

Calvista Gold has developed and implemented an industry standard QA/QC program. In 

July 2010, Calvista Gold initiated a QA/QC program with the systematic use of blanks.  

In October 2010, Calvista Gold increased its QA/QC program by systematically taking 

core duplicates from holes CAL-12 to CAL-13 and by inserting two internal standards 

into the sample stream. In December 2010, Calvista assayed 160 samples (in a total of 

15 batches) of coarse reject material from holes CAL-01 to CAL-13 and inserted two 

certified standards into the sample stream for these samples, in addition to certified 

blank material and a duplicate coarse reject sample in each batch. 

 

BLANKS 
The regular submission of blank material is used to assess potential contamination 

during sample preparation and to identify sample numbering errors.  Calvista Gold's 

QA/QC protocol requires blanks to be inserted in the sample stream at a rate of 

approximately 1 in 20 samples.  

 

Calvista Gold used blanks from three sources over the course of the drilling program. 

Calvista Gold inserted blank material acquired from SGS in Medellin into the sample 

stream for holes CAL-01 to CAL-11. This material consisted of silica with an expected 

value of <0.01 g/t Au.  Calvista Gold created an internal blank by combining and

thoroughly mixing pulps of samples that returned less than detection limit values from 

the early drill holes in the program. The internal blank generated by Calvista Gold was 

not sent to multiple laboratories for round robin assaying.  It was inserted into the sample 

stream for a portion of hole CAL-11 and holes CAL-12, -12B and -13.  Calvista Gold also 

acquired certified blank material from Acme Labs in Medellin, Colombia, with an 

expected value of <0.01 g/t, which was inserted into the sample stream for the coarse 

reject duplicate analyses.  Scott Wilson RPA received the results from 179 analyses of 

blanks, including 128 analyses of the silica acquired from SGS, 36 samples of the 

internal blank, and 15 samples of the certified blank acquired from Acme Labs (Table 25-

1, Appendix 2).   

 

An upper tolerance level of three times the detection limit for the assay method used 

(0.06 g/t Au) was established. Figure 14-1 is a plot of the blank sample assays with 

respect to the upper tolerance level. The blank material was under the threshold limit in 

all but six instances. 

  

Two of these instances involve internal blank material and may be a result of introducing 

non-certified internal standard material into the sample stream instead of blank material. 

 

One blank sample from hole CAL-12 (A-1946) returned a value of 0.55 g/t Au. This 

appears to be a case of contamination as it came immediately following a high grade 

sample. Calvista Gold asked the laboratory to re-analyze the high grade sample, the 

blank sample, and the remaining samples in the batch. Calvista Gold also asked for the 

reanalysis of a portion of the coarse reject batch relating to sample A-1904 which 

returned a value of 0.07 g/t Au and investigated the blank failures associated with the 

earlier sampling. The results of the re-analyses of blank material fall within acceptable 

limits and the results of the other re-assayed samples in the batches returned assays 

close to their expected values. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the results of the analyses of blank samples are 

reasonable.

DRILL CORE AND REJECT DUPLICATES 
Drill core duplicates assess the variability introduced by selecting one half of the drill 

core versus the other, sample misordering, and natural local-scale variance (nugget 

effect). Calvista Gold began taking core duplicates in hole CAL-12. Calvista Gold's 

protocol now calls for drill core duplicates to be submitted at a rate of 1 in 20 samples.  

 

Scott Wilson RPA received the results of 30 core duplicate pairs. The results of the core 

duplicate pairs are listed in Table 14-2.  Figure 14-2 is the result of plotting the analysis 

of the original sample versus its duplicate analysis.  Many of the results of duplicate pairs 

fall below the detection limit and are therefore of only limited value. Scott Wilson RPA 

recommends that Calvista Gold investigate those sample pairs which exhibit a large 

variance and re-analyze if necessary. In future drilling programs, Scott Wilson RPA also 

recommends that more mineralized material be duplicated. Scott Wilson RPA 

understands that Calvista Gold has begun a core duplicate sampling program at a rate 

of 1 in 20 samples for the drill holes prior to CAL-12.

Scott Wilson RPA received the results of 160 reject duplicate pairs. The results of the 

reject duplicate pairs are listed in Table 26-1, Appendix 3.  Figure 14-3 is the result of 

plotting the analysis of the original sample versus its duplicate analysis. Generally, the 

results of the reject duplicate analyses are good. One sample (A-1848) plotted outside 

acceptable limits. Scott Wilson RPA understands that Calvista Gold is investigating the 

associated batch and re-analyzing a number of samples from this batch.

CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIAL (STANDARDS) 
Results of the regular submission of certified reference material samples (CRMs) are 

used to identify problems with specific sample batches and long-term biases associated 

with the primary assay laboratory.   

 

Scott Wilson RPA understands that Calvista Gold created two internal, non-certified 

standards by combining and thoroughly mixing the pulps of selected samples from the 

early drill holes in the program. The internal standards generated by Calvista Gold were 

not sent to multiple laboratories for round robin assaying.  The pulps used to create the 

internal standards had average assay values of 0.5 g/t Au and 1.0 g/t Au. Beginning with

Page 14-8 

drill hole CAL-12, Calvista Gold's protocol called for the insertion of the internal 

standards at a rate of 1 in 20 samples. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA received the results of 21 samples from the internal standard with an 

expected value of 0.5 g/t Au and 20 samples from the internal standard with an expected 

value 1.0 g/t Au. The results of these analyses are listed in Appendix 4. 

 

The results of the 0.5 g/t Au internal standard indicate that its actual value is probably in 

the range of 0.32 g/t Au to 0.37 g/t Au. The mean and median values of the assay values 

are 0.32 g/t Au and 0.35 g/t Au, respectively. In three instances, blank material may have 

been introduced into the sample stream rather than standard material. 

 

The results of the 1.0 g/t Au internal standard are somewhat erratic, but it appears that 

the actual value of the material is lower than 1.0 g/t Au. The mean and the median of the 

assay values are 0.82 g/t Au and 0.805 g/t Au, respectively. 

 

Calvista Gold also acquired two CRMs from Rocklabs Ltd. of Auckland, New Zealand, 

which were inserted into the sample stream for the reject duplicate samples at a rate of 1 

in 20 samples. The low standard, Si42, has a recommended value and two standard 

deviations (2σ) of 1.761 ± 0.042 g/t Au.  The high standard, SK43, has a recommended 

value and two standard deviations (2σ) of 4.086 ± 0.072 g/t Au.  

 

Scott Wilson RPA received the results of 19 analyses of CRMs. Table 14-3 lists the 

results of the analyses of the CRMs.

Generally the results of the analyses of CRMs are reasonable. For standard SI42, all ten 

analyses show acceptable results with respect to the expected value. For standard 

SK43, one sample (A-1919) yielded a significant difference with respect to the expected 

value. Scott Wilson RPA understands that Calvista Gold has requested the re-analysis  

of part of the batch associated with this standard. It is noted that the other standard in 

the batch returned a result within the acceptable limits. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that Calvista Gold only use CRMs until such time as 

proper round robin assaying determines the expected values of the internal standards. 

Thereafter, the internal standards could be used to supplement certified reference 

materials. Scott Wilson RPA understands that Calvista Gold is acquiring a third certified 

standard to cover the high end of the expected range of gold values. 

 

METALLIC SCREEN ANALYSIS 
Calvista Gold requests that the laboratory routinely re-assay all samples yielding results 

greater than 10 g/t Au by metallic screen analysis. Scott Wilson RPA agrees with this 

practice. To date, only five samples have been checked by metallic screen analysis and 

a number of results are pending. Although coarse gold appears to occur locally, a 

pronounced nugget effect does not appear to exist, but more data are needed. 

 

ENHANCEMENTS TO QA/QC PROGRAM 
Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Calvista Gold has implemented QA/QC protocols 

that meet current industry best practices and that the results from the drilling completed 

to date could be used in future resource estimates. Scott Wilson has made the following 

recommendations to Calvista Gold with the aim of continually improving its QA/QC 

protocols. Scott Wilson RPA understands that Calvista Gold is working towards 

implementing these recommendations and has adopted them as standard operating 

procedure for any future work. 

 

Pulp duplicates are submitted to a second laboratory to make an additional assessment 

of laboratory bias.  Scott Wilson RPA understands that Calvista Gold has submitted a 

suite of pulp duplicates to an alternate laboratory. The results of the analyses of these 

samples have yet to be received as of the effective date of this report.  For future drilling

Page 14-12 

programs, SGS should be instructed to prepare one pulp duplicate for every 50 samples. 

These should be forwarded to an alternate laboratory for analysis using similar digestion 

and analysis methods as used by the primary laboratory. 

 

Reject duplicates consist of a second split of the crushed sample and should be 

prepared and analyzed at the primary laboratory. The split should be taken using the 

same method and have the same weight as the original sample. Calvista Gold has 

already implemented this procedure and has received the results of 160 reject duplicate 

analyses from the first phase of drilling, equivalent to approximately 1 in 20 samples.  

For future drilling programs, Calvista Gold should continue to submit one coarse reject 

duplicate every 50 samples. 

 

Calvista Gold should continue to request that SGS re-analyze any samples returning 

gold values greater than 10 g/t by screen metallics analysis. 

 

In order to facilitate future resource estimates, Scott Wilson RPA recommends that 

Calvista Gold determine of specific gravities from representative core samples of both 

mineralized and unmineralized core by the water immersion method. Scott Wilson RPA 

understands that Calvista Gold is in the process of implementing this recommendation.

15 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
Regionally, the mineralization in the area of the California Project appears to be 

controlled by the northeast striking Cucutilla fault zone. Properties of note that occur 

along the Cucutilla structure include Greystar Resources Ltd.'s (Greystar) Angostura 

Project, Ventana Gold Corp.'s (Ventana) La Bodega Property, and Galway Resources 

Ltd.'s (Galway) California Project. 

 

ANGOSTURA PROJECT 
The Angostura Project is located approximately 1.5 km along strike to the northeast of 

Norvista's northernmost mining title. Table 15-1 lists the Angostura Project resources 

published by Greystar based on 302,834 m of drilling completed on the property through 

to January 2010, and 1,768 muck samples from exploration tunnels.  The open pit and 

underground resources were reported using an incremental cut-off grade, where each 

block in the model is economically evaluated using the gold and silver prices, 

metallurgical model and processing costs. The blocks with positive revenue are 

considered mineral. Greystar used a price of US$850/oz for gold and US$12/oz for 

silver.

In 2009, Greystar completed a pre-feasibility study which envisions the optimum 

processing route to be a combination of heap leach and flotation treatment.  The initial 

start-up considers the processing of oxide, transitional, and low sulphide material by 

heap leaching at a rate of 70,000 tpd using a conventional valley-fill heap leach 

operation.  From year 5, the pre-feasibility study envisions processing 5,200 tpd of high 

sulphide mineralization and the production of a gold/silver-rich sulphide concentrate by 

flotation (Greig et al., 2009). 

 

LA BODEGA PROPERTY 
Ventana's La Bodega property is contiguous with the northernmost California Project 

mining titles to the northeast and north of Licence 14031. The La Bodega Project 

comprises three properties: the La Bodega property, which includes the La Suiza and La 

Italia properties, and the Coloro and El Cuatro properties. Three zones of mineralization 

have been identified to date, namely, the La Bodega zone, the La Mascota zone, and 

the Las Mercedes zone. 

 

The La Bodega zone is a porphyry style, near-surface deposit, believed to be the 

extension of Greystar's Angostura zone (O'Prey, 2008b). Along strike 350 m to the 

southwest, the larger and higher grade La Mascota zone is an epithermal deposit that 

dips 65° to 85° to the northwest.  It has been defined along a strike length of 800 m and 

to a depth of up to 400 m down-dip, with estimated true composite widths of 10 m to 50 

m. Drill intercepts at La Mascota include 7.04 g/t Au over 47 m in hole LB-004, 8.26 g/t 

Au over 27.52 m in hole LB-006, and 17.44 g/t Au across 27.4 m in hole LB-036 (O'Prey, 

2008b).  The La Mascota zone remains open to the southwest, at depth and to the

northeast, and is believed to extend to the southwest onto the Coloro and El Cuatro 

properties (www.ventanagold.com).  

 

On November 8, 2010, Ventana published the results of a scoping study and an initial 

resource estimate. Table 15-2 lists the La Bodega and La Mascota zone resource 

estimate published by Ventana based on the drilling completed up to September 2010. 

The resources were estimated using cut-off grades of 1.8 g/t Au and 2.0 g/t Au for large 

and small stopes, respectively.

The scoping study envisioned an underground operation employing sublevel stoping to 

produce 7,500 tpd.  During the first six years of production, the mine is expected to 

produce an average of 301,000 ounces of gold, 1.4 million ounces of silver, and 6.9 

million pounds of copper annually. Over the estimated 14 year mine life, the annual 

production is expected to average 220,000 ounces of gold, 1.2 million ounces of silver, 

and 5.4 million pounds of copper annually. 

 

Ventana recently announced that it is undertaking a 3.9 km long exploration decline to 

provide access to the La Mascota zone.  

 

Preliminary sampling of the Las Mercedes zone, situated 500 m south of the La Bodega 

zone has returned significant values. Table 15-3 lists the values achieved in channel 

samples taken from various cross-cuts and outcrops along the zone.

GALWAY RESOURCES 
Galway controls ground located along strike to the southwest of Ventana's La Mascota 

zone.  Galway has concentrated its drilling efforts on three mineralized zones, namely, 

the NE Zone, the Pie de Gallo Zone, and the San Celestino zone 

(www.galwayresources.com). 

 
NE ZONE 
The NE Zone of Galway's California property is located along its eastern boundary with 

Ventana.  Highlights from reported drill results from this area include:

The San Celestino Zone (previously known as the El Dorado Zone) is located one 

kilometre along strike to the southwest of the NE Zone. Highlights of reported drill results 

from San Celestino include the following: 

• 11.0 m of 9.9 g/t Au, including 3.3 m of 30.4 g/t Au from GWY-22  

• 7.2 m of 7.6 g/t Au from GWY-23  

• 1.5 m of 47.1 g/t Au from GWY-25  

• 25.0 m of 3.6 g/t Au, including 16.0 m of 5.4 g/t Au, including 1.5 m of 27.4 g/t Au 
from GWY-26  

• 40.5 m of 1.5 g/t Au from GWY-29 

 

As of the effective date of this report, no mineral resource estimates for the Galway's 

California property have been published. 

 

Other adjoining properties are held by Colombian nationals. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA has been unable to verify the information relating to the Angostura, La 

Bodega, or Galway properties. The information related to these properties is not 

necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the California Project.

18 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 
SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada advises against all travel to certain 

departments in Colombia located along the border with Venezuela, including Santander. 

The presence of armed drug traffickers, guerilla, and paramilitary organizations poses a 

major risk to travellers. These groups continue to perpetrate attacks, extortion, 

kidnappings, car bombings, and damage to infrastructure in these areas 

(www.voyage.gc.ca/countries_pays/report_rapport). 

 

Scott Wilson RPA did not experience any security issues during the property visit. 

 

PARAMO ECOSYSTEM 
Law 1382 of 2010 which reforms the existing Mining Code requires that mining and 

exploration activity must be excluded from the "Paramo" ecosystem. Paramo is an 

ecosystem above 3,200 m elevation consisting of glacier-formed valleys and plains with 

lakes, peat bogs, and wet and dry grasslands intermingled with shrub lands and forest 

patches.  

 

All of Calvista Gold's properties comprising the California Project are located below the 

Paramo ecosystem and, therefore, are not affected by the new legislation. 

 

GALWAY DRILLING ACTIVITIES ON LICENCE 98-68 
It is Scott Wilson RPA's understanding that a dispute arose with regard to certain drilling 

activities conducted by Galway within the licence 098-68 area, arising from the fact that 

Galway has an option agreement in respect of each of licences 90-68 and 107-68 which 

are located above and below licence 098-68, respectively.  In this regard, the owners of 

licence 098-68 alleged that Galway had been conducting operations without 

authorization from the licence holders on an area which comprises part of the property

underlying licence 098-68, in connection with which drilling results were released by 

Galway on September 8, 2010. 

 

On July 12, 2010, the owners of licence 098-68 requested the Colombian Federal Mining 

Regulator INGEOMINAS to issue an administrative injunction ordering Galway to cease 

operations on the properties covered by licence 098-68.  In connection with such 

request, on September 13, 2010, a technical assessment was produced by a surveyor 

retained by INGEOMINAS which confirmed that some of the drill holes which were drilled 

by Galway were in fact located within the licence 098-68 area. 

 

On September 22, 2010, Resolution GTRB No. 0170 was issued by INGEOMINAS in 

favour of the owners of licence 098-68, stating that Galway had illegally conducted 

drilling activities on the properties covered by licence 098-68 and ordering Galway to 

vacate the property. Galway was duly notified of such resolution and had five days to 

appeal the resolution. Galway did not appeal during that term and on October 27, 2010, 

Resolution GTRB No. 0197 was issued by INGEOMINAS confirming and declaring fully 

enforceable Resolution GTRB No. 0170.  

 

On November 11, 2010, Galway filed a brief before INGEOMINAS Bucaramanga 

requesting that the levels and areas corresponding to each of titles 098-68, 090-68, and 

107-68 be specified given that the three licences currently cover the same 10.0881 ha. 

 

On November 18, 2010, Mrs. Josefa Niño de Medina and her sons, title holders of 

licence 090-68, filed a brief before INGEOMINAS accepting the results of a study carried 

out under a Technical Cooperation Agreement entered into by the mining authority and 

UPTC-MINERCOL in the year 2001. Such study concludes that the three licences 

should be divided into three horizontal levels as follows: (i) licence 107-68 – area located 

above 2,460 m; (ii) licence 098-68 – area located between 2,410 m and 2,460 m; and 

(iii) licence 090-68 – area located below 2,410 m. 

 

On December 15, 2010, INGEOMINAS issued a Technical Opinion accepting the 

Integrated Study made in 2001 by UPTC-MINERCOL which declares the boundaries of 

each level of exploitation corresponding to each of licences 090-68, 098-68, and 107-88 

as follows:

• Licence 107-68: from 2,460 m and above; 
• Licence 098-68: from 2,402 m to 2,460 m; 
• Licence 090-68: from 2,402 m and below. 

 

INGEOMINAS is now required to formally notify the decision by an administrative act or 

resolution to the relevant affected parties. 

 

On December 15, 2010, the title holders of licence 098-68 filed a document disputing the 

brief submitted by Josefa Niño and sons on November 18, and requested a copy of the 

documents that served INGEOMINAS to accept the Integrated Study by UPTC-

MINERCOL. 

 

It is Scott Wilson RPA's understanding that this is an on-going matter that is subject to 

final determination by INGEOMINAS, which is expected during the first semester of 

2011.

NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011 

      

Page 19-1 

19 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The California Project consists of nine mining titles grouped into six non-contiguous 

blocks within the rapidly developing California mining district of Colombia.  The mining 

titles are underlain by prospective lithologies of the Santander Massif in proximity to the 

northeast striking Rio La Baja fault zone, which appears to be the controlling structure to 

mineralization in the area.  Artisanal mining is currently taking place, or has taken place, 

on all the California Project mining titles.  Prior to Calvista Gold's involvement, the 

subject mining titles had not had the benefit of modern exploration techniques and only 

limited diamond drilling had taken place locally.  

 

Recent exploration in the California district has been successful in defining very 

attractive gold mineralized zones along the Rio La Baja structure, including Greystar's 

multi-million ounce Angostura deposit and Ventana's Mascota zone where an 

underground exploration program is currently underway. 

 

The mineralization in the California district consists of sheeted, steeply dipping quartz ± 

pyrite veins and hydrothermal breccias hosted by variably sericitized and argillized 

intrusive and basement gneissic rocks. It has been interpreted to represent high-

sulphidation-style mineralization. 

 

Work to date by Calvista Gold has been concentrated on the two northernmost blocks 

and includes geological mapping on portions of the northern blocks and diamond drilling.  

As of the effective date of this report, 14 holes have been completed for a total of 

4,786.89 m.  Limited geological mapping has been completed on the southern blocks.  

Calvista Gold also completed a detailed helicopter-borne, combined magnetic and 

radiometric survey over all of its holdings in the California area.  As of the effective date 

of this report, the airborne survey results had not yet been interpreted. 

 

The projection of the mineralized corridor southwest from Angostura and through 

Mascota appears to have been intersected in diamond drilling by Calvista Gold on its 

Jaramalla (100-68) and Callejon Blanco (0037-68) licences.  Calvista Gold controls a 

strike length of approximately 600 m along the prospective structure. Elsewhere, 

Calvista Gold's Buenavista licence is located along strike of Ventana's Las Mercedes

and Asserradero zones where preliminary sampling has returned very encouraging 

results. 

 

Calvista Gold has developed and implemented quality assurance/quality control 

(QA/QC) protocols that meet current industry best practices. Calvista Gold's protocol 

during the 2010 drilling program included the insertion of blanks and both core and reject 

duplicates as well as a limited number of certified standards into the sample stream. 

Samples with assay results greater than 10 g/t Au were re-assayed by metallic screen 

analysis. Calvista Gold has submitted a suite of samples of pulp duplicates to an 

alternate laboratory 

 

Although the drilling to date by Calvista Gold is preliminary, the results have confirmed a 

very attractive geological setting including permissive structure, alteration, and 

mineralization. The assay results received to date have been sufficiently encouraging to 

warrant considerable additional exploration. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that the California Project has the potential to host 

significant high-sulphidation-style gold mineralization.

20 RECOMMENDATIONS 
Scott Wilson RPA is of the opinion that Calvista Gold's California Project covers highly 

prospective ground and merits continued significant gold exploration, including increased 

diamond drilling.  A substantial work program is recommended.  Recommended Phase I 

work, beginning as soon as is operationally practical, includes: 

 

• Completion of geological mapping, prospecting, and sampling on all licences, 
 

• Follow-up with detailed IP and soil sampling of prospective structures/targets on 
the southern blocks as defined by the helicopter-borne geophysical survey, 
 

• Follow-up of first phase drilling results with additional diamond drilling on the 
northern blocks, and 
 

• Acquisition of additional ground along the prospective corridor to cover airborne 
geophysical anomalies, if any. 

 

A cut grid will be needed on the southern blocks to facilitate IP surveying and soil 

sampling.  Soil sampling on the southernmost blocks can be done on a 50 m x 50 m grid 

over geophysical targets. Mobile Metal Ion (MMI) analysis has been demonstrated to 

work in the project area. 

 

Follow-up drilling on the northern blocks should be completed with HQ diameter core at 

regular intervals along the structure by drilling multiple holes from individual set-ups so 

as to minimize the environmental impact and costs related to making trails and drill set-

ups as well minimizing moving costs.  A program of 10,000 m of drilling is 

recommended.  Table 20-1 lists the locations, attitudes, and lengths of the proposed 

Phase I drilling program.

Calvista Gold Corporation – California Project 
NI 43-101 Technical Report – January 17, 2011 

      

Page 20-4 

A drilling program totalling 15,000 m is recommended to test coincident geophysical and 

geochemical anomalies on the southern blocks and to delineate the limits of the known 

mineralization and better assess the grade distribution of the mineralized zones on the 

northern blocks. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that Calvista Gold explore the possibility of extending 

the terms of the various exploitation licences to maximize the time available for 

exploration, development, and mining and/or consolidating the licences into one 

concession agreement. 

 

Scott Wilson RPA recommends that Calvista Gold continue to implement and make 

enhancements to its QA/QC protocol during the recommended drilling programs 

including the insertion of blanks, core duplicates and multiple certified standards into the 

sample stream. Samples returning over-range gold assays should continue to be re-

assayed by screen metallics.  Pulp and reject duplicates should also be prepared and 

assayed by an alternate laboratory and the regular laboratory, respectively, on an on-

going basis. Calvista Gold should continue the implementation of a program of regular 

specific gravity determinations designed to facilitate possible future resource 

estimations. 

 

Details of the recommended Phase II program can be found in Table 20-3.
