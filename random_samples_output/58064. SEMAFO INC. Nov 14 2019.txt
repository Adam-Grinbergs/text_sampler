1 SUMMARY 

 

1.1 Property Description and Location 

The Nabanga exploration permit ("Permis de recherche") is located in the south-east of Burkina 

Faso, approximately 250 km to the southeast of Ouagadougou. The permit is centered on latitude 

11° 18' 03" North and longitude 0° 29' 58" East in the geographic coordinate system. The Nabanga 

Permit has an irregular shape covering 178.50 km². 

The southeastern sector of the Project is approximately 5 km to the NW extremity of the Kompienga 

Lake formed by the hydro-electrical dam built some 25 km further to the SE. 

SEMAFO formerly held five contiguous exploration permits collectively known as the Yactibo Permit 

Group. Two (2) permits were relinquished and the Kamsongo, Napadé and the Nabanga permits 

were retained. 

The Nabanga Permit is registered under the name of Birimian Resources Sarl, which is 100% owned 

by SEMAFO. The latest renewal brings the expiry date of the Nabanga Permit to April 1, 2020. 

The Nabanga Permit is mainly regulated by the 2003 Mining Code. The Mining Code gives the 

exploration permit holder the exclusive right to explore for the minerals requested, and the right to 

convert it into an Industrial Operating Permit (Permis d'exploitation industrielle). The exploration 

permit is accompanied by a Mining Agreement (Convention minière) that supplements the provisions 

of the Mining Code.  

The permit is subject to a 10% carried ownership interest to the Government of Burkina Faso, and a 

graduated royalty based on the gold price. A Net Profit Royalty (NPR) of 1% is assigned to the 

original vendor. 

1.2 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure, and Physiography 

The Property is accessible from Ouagadougou by travelling 220 km to the east via all-weather, paved 

(Route Nationale) RN04 to Fada-N'Gourma. Proceeding approximately 80 km southward along 

paved RN18 will lead to about 15 km east of the Property. A gravel road that crosses the Kompienga 

River provides the main access to the Property and different sectors of the Property can be reached 

by various roads, drill tracks and trails. 

The Property is located in the southern portion of the Sahelian-Sudanian zone, under semi-arid 

climatic conditions characterized by a rainy season from May to September and a dry season 

between October and April, when the harmattan, a dry wind blowing off the Sahara Desert, carries 

large amounts of dust over hundreds of kilometers. The highest average temperature of 32.1°C was 

recorded in April, and the lowest averaged 25.0°C in January.

Fada-N'Gourma is the nearest town where basic services and supplies are available. It is serviced 

by a hospital, hotels, and a 991 m long dirt-surface landing strip. Specialized services and equipment 

have to be sourced in Ouagadougou. Mining manpower would likely be from local and expatriate 

personnel. Power will probably come from on-site generation, but may be from the Kompienga dam 

power station or from a hydro-power line10 km away from the project. The Kompienga River and 

Lake, as well as a tributary that crosses the center of the northern tier of the Permit may represent a 

source of water for a mining operation. 

1.3 History  

The Nabanga Permit was originally granted to Mr. Sayouba Sawadogo in 2008 for a surface area of 

238 km2 that was reduced by 25% to its current 178.50 km2 upon the second renewal. The permit 

was subsequently acquired by Birimian Resources Sarl, a company 100% owned by SEMAFO under 

the acquisition of Orbis Gold Limited (Orbis) in March 2015.  

Birimian Resources was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mt Isa Metals Limited, an Australian mining 

company that changed its name for Orbis in 2012. Five (5) contiguous exploration permits forming 

the Yactibo Permit Group were acquired between 2007 and 2011.  

No exploration is known to have occurred on the Yactibo permits prior to 2008. Orbis initiated 

exploration on the Nabanga property in 2010 with reconnaissance and field mapping, delineating the 

artisanal mining sites and interpreting satellite imagery data. 

Several soil sampling programs were initiated across the Yactibo Permit Group, as well as airborne 

magnetic-radiometric survey that showed the Nabanga structure extending over approximately 9 km. 

In 2011, Orbis had confirmed the presence of a gold deposit on the Nabanga 500 m long Central 

and 600 m long North Zones by RC holes. 

Additional drilling in 2011-2012 provided the data for the initial resource estimate prepared by 

Snowden in 2012. Deeper holes were drilled in 2013 and soil sampling and Induced Polarization (IP) 

surveys identified possible strike extensions and new mineralized bodies. Several phases of 

historical metallurgical test work were completed for the Nabanga Project. 

An initial Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) compliant resources estimate was performed by 

Snowden in August 2012 (Table 1.1). The estimate is based on 239 RC and 14 diamond drill holes 

and a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au, a minimum mining width of 1.5 m and a top cut at 70 g/t Au. Grade 

interpolation was performed using the Ordinary Kriging method.

The Reader is cautioned that Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have 

demonstrated economic viability. 

The Property has not been the subject of prior commercial gold production, but gold has been 

extracted for an unknown period of time from shallow artisanal workings. 

1.4 Geological Setting and Mineralization 

Burkina Faso is located in the Leo-Man Shield that forms the southern exposure of the West African 

Craton (WAC). The Leo-Man Shield comprises an Archean nucleus, the Kénéma–Man domain 

(3.60–2.70 Ga) centered on Liberia, and the Paleoproterozoic Baoulé-Mossi domain (2.30 – 2.00 

Ga) predominant in Burkina Faso. The Baoulé-Mossi Domain consists of granite-gneiss terrains, 

"Birimian" greenstone belts and basins and fluvio-deltaic basins of the Tarkwaian Sequence. 

Sediments of Neoproterozoic age overlie the Paleoproterozoic basement in the SE of Burkina Faso 

(Volta sedimentary basin) and skirt the western edge of the country (Taoudeni basin). 

The N-NE trending, elongated greenstone belts comprise mafic volcanic rocks and intermediate and 

acid effusive suites that are typical of volcanic arc environments, interbedded with volcano-

sedimentary units. They are bound by older granite-gneiss terrains and have been intruded by syn- 

to late-tectonic granite bodies.

The present-day structural trend of litho-tectonic units and the dominant fabrics in the WAC formed 

during the Eburnean orogeny. An early phase of contractional (collisional) deformation and medium- 

to high-grade metamorphism followed by two (2) phases of transcurrent tectonics and low-grade 

metamorphic overprint is generally recognized. 

The Yactibo Permit Group straddles a major NE-trending shear separating the Youga Belt in the 

northwest from the Diapaga Belt in the southeast, the latter hosting the Nabanga deposit and being 

the easternmost Belt in Burkina Faso.  

The Diapaga Belt is dominantly comprised of intermediate volcanic rocks, sediments, granite and 

gneiss, with subordinate common mafic volcanic rocks and intrusive complexes. Conglomeratic 

sediments are mapped as Tarkwaian equivalents. Early banded or and/or foliated granitoids are also 

very common. 

The main feature on the Nabanga property is the granodiorite hosting the mineralization. The gold-

bearing structure is associated with a sheared quartz vein containing a large proportion of the high 

gold values, bracketed by an alteration halo of lower gold grade accompanied by minor amounts of 

pyrite. The Nabanga mineralization is manifest on surface by a NE-trending zone of shallow artisanal 

gold mining site that extends over 3.5 km. The gold mineralization is hosted in a single structure 

extending over 3.5 km, but traceable over several kilometers to the southwest, based on magnetic 

surveys and exploration work. The deposit is of high-grade gold type, which is evidenced by a 

moderate reduction of the contained gold ounces as the cut-off grade is raised. 

The overall strike of the Nabanga mineralized structure is NE-SW and the dip varies between 55° 

and 70° toward the northwest. The mineralization is arranged as a series of shoots plunging at 45º 

to the NE and has an average thickness of 3.2 m. The Nabanga deposit is divided into the North, 

Central and Southern Extension Zones by three (3) cross faults.  

The weathering profile in the Nabanga deposit area is relatively shallow, generally reaching a depth 

of 10 m to 21 m. 

1.5 Exploration Work and Drilling  

1.5.1 EXPLORATION 

Exploration by SEMAFO on the Nabanga and the adjacent permits included establishment of a line 

grid, field mapping, outlining the different artisanal mining sites, geochemical surveying and an 

IP/Resistivity and magnetometer survey.  

In 2018, 38 quarter core samples were submitted for whole-rock analysis in order to characterize the 

geochemical signature of the hydrothermal alteration associated with the mineralization.

In addition, 8,530 auger holes were drilled to a nominal depth of 5 m for a cumulative total of 

41,923 m, which generated 16,994 samples. Generally, auger drilling returned anomalous values 

that confirmed the regional NE geophysical trends in the Yactibo permits. 

1.5.2 DRILLING 

A total of 441 holes were drilled by Orbis between 2010 and 2013, as listed in Table 1.3.

A combination of 103 RC and core holes were drilled by SEMAFO between 2016 and 2018, as listed 

in Table 1.4. 

In 2016, SEMAFO drilled into the SW Extension of the Nabanga mineralized structure, in an attempt 

to upgrade the potential of the property and was successful explaining the soil anomalies, although 

none was found to be of economic potential. 

Drilling in 2017 was aimed primarily at six (6) proximal targets, parallel to and along, the southwest 

extension of the Nabanga deposit. Generally, the holes returned low gold values and suggested lack 

of continuity. SEMAFO re-logged the RC chips from previous RC holes and incorporated the new 

data into the database. 

In 2018, SEMAFO updated the database used by Snowden in 2012 and 2015, added the holes drilled 

by Orbis in 2012-2013 and the holes drilled by SEMAFO in 2016 and 2017.  

SEMAFO re-interpreted the geology and structure of the Nabanga deposit and updated the 3D 

geology model. The resulting interpretation suggested a shallower northerly plunge than previously 

interpreted of the high-grade shoots, strongly suggesting they could extend along strike and beyond 

the depth of 200 m.  A program of 25 diamond drill holes successful supported the new interpretation 

of higher-grade gold mineralization arranged as shallowly-plunging shoots. This, in contrast to the

previous interpretation by Orbis, strongly suggested that the deposit is still open at depth and to the 

north, along the extension of the plunging shoots.

1.6 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

The tests performed included ball mill work index test and SMC tests. ALS Ammtec performed two 

(2) Bond Work Index tests. The material can be considered very hard and medium abrasive. 

ALS Ammtec performed cyanidation tests. Process development undertaken during the PEA aimed 

at establishing a conventional sulphide gold/silver processing facility considering the constructability, 

operability and maintainability of the processing facility. The results indicate that material has 

refractory characteristics as a high concentration of cyanide is required to obtain good leach results. 

1.7 Mineral Resources Estimate  

The Mineral Resources are stated using an average density and are constrained in a preliminary 

optimized pit. The resources are estimated exclusively for the mineralization within the fresh 

(sulphide) portion of the Nabanga deposit. Table 1.5 presents the results from the resource estimate.

1.8 Mining Method 

The current mine plan is to mine Nabanga mineral resources via open pit mining and underground 

mining methods. It is estimated that approximately 616 Kt of mineralized material is extractable by 

conventional surface mining operations and 2.364 Mt of mineralized material is extractable by 

underground methods. 

The total life of the mine has been estimated at approximately nine (9) years, including the 

preproduction period. 

A production schedule (mine plan) was developed for the Project to produce a total of 571K oz of 

gold over the life of mine, using the mill recovery of 92% and a processing rate of 360 Kt of 

mineralized material per year. 

1.9 Recovery Methods 

The Nabanga concentrator is designed to process a nominal 360,000 tonnes of Run-of-Mine (ROM) 

mineralized material per year and produce 571,000 troy ounces of gold over the life of mine. 

The ROM mineralized material will crush by a jaw crusher and transported the stockpile by conveyor. 

The crushed material is reclaimed from the stockpile by apron feeder to a SAG mill. The SAG mill 

discharge is screened, and the screen oversize is returned back in the SAG mill. The SAG screen 

undersize is pumped to the ball mill circuit in closed circuit with the cyclones. The cyclone overflow 

flows to the flotation circuit. The flotation concentrate will ground to 25 micron and processed in an 

intensive leach reactor, while the flotation tailings will be processed in a more conventional CIL 

circuit, followed by the carbon elution, electro-winning and refining. The estimated combined 

recovery gold recovery is 92%. 

1.10 Project Infrastructure 

The existing (Route Nationale) RN18 connects the town of Fada-N'Gourma to the border between 

Burkina Faso and Togo. Starting approximately 80 km South of Fada-N'Gourma, a new access road 

connecting the RN18 to the Nabanga Process Site will be developed over a distance of about 11 km. 

The power demand of SEMAFO site was determined to be 5.8 MW based on the estimated 

connected loads, running loads and running power for the process operation. The power plant 

consists of five (5) generators using Light fuel oil (LFO) fuel (four in operation, one in stand-by, 

maintenance or repair). 

In addition to the concentrator building that will house the processing equipment, the site will include 

administration and mine offices, an accommodation camp and cafeteria, a warehouse, a 

metallurgical laboratory, and a security gate.

1.11 Market Studies and Contracts 

SEMAFO is an existing producer and seller of gold. Historical data for gold prices, therefore, exists 

and as such no formal market studies for this Technical Report have been undertaken. 

A long-term gold price projection of $1,300 US per ounce for this Technical Report is considered 

reasonable on the basis of actual gold prices which reflect SEMAFO conservative outlook of the 

future market for gold. 

1.12 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact 

The project site is located approximately 250 km south-east of Ouagadougou, the country's capital. 

Access to Nabanga is by means of (Route Nationale) RN04, an all-weather paved road from 

Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, through Fada N'Gourma. From there, travel is via RN18, 

an all-weather paved road to within approximately 15 km of the Nabanga Project. An unsealed dirt 

road, which crosses the Kompienga River, is then used to access the Nabanga property 

approximately 15 km to the west of RN18, although other similar dirt access roads can be used to 

access other parts of the property. 

As part of the environmental approval process in Burkina Faso, SEMAFO will carry out an 

Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ("ESIA") for the Nabanga Project. Currently, little has 

been done to collect environmental and social data in the Project area since the Project is only at an 

early stage of study.  

This Project being still at an early stage, no formal process for the Environmental and Social Impact 

Assessment ("ESIA") has been started at this stage. 

The typical approach that will be developed by SEMAFO during the future ESIA will take into 

consideration the social and environmental concerns of all interested parties. These concerns will be 

integrated into the initial stages of the project design. This approach aims at maximising the project's 

integration into the environment and minimising its negative impacts to increase the environmental 

and social acceptability of the Project. 

1.13 Capital and Operating Costs 

1.13.1 CAPITAL COST ESTIMATE (CAPEX) 

The Project scope covered in this Report is based on the construction of a greenfield mining and 

processing facility with an average mill feed capacity of 360,000 tonnes per year of mineralized 

material and producing an average of 70,000 oz per year of gold. 

The capital and operating cost estimates related to the mine, the concentrator, and all required 

facilities and infrastructure have been developed by DRA/Met-Chem or consolidated from external 

sources.

All amounts are in United States dollars (USD), unless otherwise specified. 

The Capex consists of direct and indirect capital costs as well as contingency. Provision for 

sustaining capital is also estimated and included in the financial evaluation as well as the closure 

and rehabilitation costs. 

The Capex includes the material, equipment, labour and freight required for the mine pre-

development, processing facilities, tailings storage and management, as well as all infrastructure and 

services necessary to support the operation. 

The Capex prepared for this PEA is based on a Class 4 type estimate as per the Association for the 

Advancement of Cost Engineering ("AACE") Recommended Practice 47R-11 with a target accuracy 

of ±35%. Although some individual elements of the Capex may not achieve the target level of 

accuracy, the overall estimate falls within the parameters of the intended accuracy.

1.14 Economic Analysis 

The project has been evaluated using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis. Cash inflows were 

estimated based on annual revenue projections. The economic/financial assessment of the project 

is based on Q3-2019 price projections and cost estimates in U.S. currency.  

The Net Present Value (NPV) of the project was calculated by discounting back cash flow projections 

throughout the Life-of-Mine (LOM) to the Project's valuation date using a base case discount rate of 

5%. The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the payback period were also calculated. 

The financial indicators under base case conditions are presented in Table 1.8.

1.15 Interpretation and Conclusions 

The economic analysis of the Project has demonstrated the potential viability of the project over its 

9 years life of mine expectancy with recommendations to proceed to next level of Feasibility Study. 

At an average gold price of $1,300/oz, the financial results indicate a pre-tax NPV of 146.7 M USD 

at discount rates of 5%. The pre-tax IRR is 31.4% with a payback period of 3.5 years. The after-tax 

NPV is 99.8 M USD at discount rates of 5%. The after-tax IRR is 22.6% and the payback period is 

4.4 years. 

1.16 Recommendations 

1.16.1 MINING AND GEOLOGY 

It is recommended to increase the level of knowledge of the mineral resources of the Nabanga 

Project with the implementation of a new drilling campaign. 

More geotechnical test work and analysis will be needed. A geotechnical drilling program will have 

to be carried out, with the following objectives: 

• Final pit slope angle assessment; 

• Geotechnical and ground support recommendations for portals excavations; 

• Recommendation for stope dimension; 

• 2D/3D finite element analysis, and ground support recommendations for the development 

areas and the production stope. 

A hydrogeological investigation program should take place, possibly at the same time than the next 

geotechnical drilling program (for assessment of the pit slope and stope stability). Pumping / 

dewatering hole could be designed at this point if required. 

Similarly, a hydrology assessment should take place as part of the PFS or DFS of the Nabanga 

Project. This work is required to evaluate the rain water contribution on the overall drainage. 

1.16.2 PROCESS 

A number of Trade-Off Studies (TOS) will need to be conducted during the next stage of the Project. 

The TOS identified during the PEA stage of the Project are the following: 

• Grinding using one large mill or two smaller ones; 

• Intensive Cyanide Leaching of Flotation Concentrate;  

• Carbon-in-Leach versus Carbon-in-Pulp (CIL vs. CIP); 

• Post Leach Thickener versus No Thickening; 

• Large Bulk Reagent Tanks versus Totes.

November 2019 
DRA/Met-Chem Ref.: C3852-Nabanga-PEA-Final Report  
002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

Additional physical characterisation test work will need to be completed. It is understood that further 

testing on mineralized material from deeper in the deposit and variability testing will need to be 

completed. 

Flotation concentrate characterisation including settling, filtering and physical characterisation for 

regrind mill requirements will be required. 

Additional leach and adsorption testing will be required including variability test work to determine 

any differences throughout the orebody with respect to recovery and reagent consumption. Testing 

will also be used to determine the requirement of Oxygen vs. Air as a leach circuit oxidant and also 

to determine the optimum leach and adsorption circuit flowsheet, CIP vs. CIL. 

1.16.3 ENVIRONMENT 

It is recommended to perform the following work in connection with environmental activities: 

• Extend soil and surface water surveys to select the best location for the tailing ponds, waste 

rock and overburden piles; 

• Carry out a hydrogeological study to collect field data in order to estimate from groundwater 

flow modeling dewatering rates and impacts; 

• Start the environmental studies required to support permitting requirement and to optimize the 

site layout; 

• Identify environmental requirement for site closure and estimate the cost.

2.3 Effective Date and Declaration 

This Report is considered effective as of September 30, 2019 and is in support of  SEMAFO's press 

release, dated September 30, 2019, entitled "SEMAFO: Positive PEA Results for Nabanga After-tax 

Net Present Value of $100 Million." 

This Report provides an independent Technical Report for the estimate to complete for the Nebanga 

Project, in conformance with the standards required by NI 43-101 and Form 43-101F1.  

It should be understood that the Mineral Reserves presented in this Report are estimates of the size 

and grade of the deposits based on a number of drill holes and samplings and on assumptions and 

parameters currently available. The level of confidence in the estimates depends upon a number of 

uncertainties which include, but are not limited to, future changes in product prices and/or production 

costs, differences in size and grade and recovery rates from those expected, and changes in Project 

parameters.

4.2 Property Description 

SEMAFO formerly held five (5) contiguous exploration permits collectively known as the Yactibo 

Permit Group: the Yacti, Ouargaye, Kamsongo and Napadé permits, the latter two being adjacent to 

the north and the west of the Nabanga Permit. 

4.2.1 NABANGA RESEARCH PERMIT (EXPLORATION PERMIT) 

The Nabanga Research Permit ("Permis de recherche") is mainly regulated by Law No. 031-2003/AN 

of May 8, 2003 of the 2003 Mining Code (Section 1, Art. 11-16).  

In Burkina Faso, an exploration permit is granted by Decree of the Minister of Mines. An exploration 

permit may be granted for a maximum area of 250 km2. The exploration permit is valid for an initial 

period of three years and may be renewed for two consecutive periods of three years, provided the 

titleholder complies with the rights and obligations set by the Mining Legislation. On the second 

renewal, at least 25 per cent of the original area must be relinquished.  

The Mining Code gives the exploration permit holder the exclusive right to explore for the minerals 

requested, on the surface and in the subsurface, within the boundaries of the permit. 

The Nabanga Permit was originally granted to Mr. Sayouba Sawadogo on April 1, 2008 and is now 

registered under the name of Birimian Resources Sarl, which is 100% owned by SEMAFO. The latest 

renewal by SEMAFO brings the expiry date of the Nabanga Permit to April 1, 2020. 

The Nabanga Permit has an irregular shape covering 178.50 km2, the outline of which is detailed in 

Table 4.1 and depicted in Figure 4.2.

The application for a permit must be filed along with a program of exploration works that the applicant 

contemplates to carry out during the first year of validity of the permit, along with the related budget 

of such program. The titleholder of a permit must start exploration works within the covered perimeter 

no later than 6 months from the date of validity of the permit and must continue work diligently. 

4.2.2 INDUSTRIAL OPERATING PERMIT (MINING PERMIT) 

The exploration permit also gives the holder the exclusive right, at any time, to convert the exploration 

permit into an Industrial Operating Permit (Permis d'exploitation industrielle).  

The mining permit (Section 2, Art. 17-23 of the 2003 Mining Code) grants its holder the exclusive 

right to exploit mineral deposits within the covered perimeter. Mining permits are valid for an initial 

period of twenty years and are renewable for five-year periods, until the reserves have been 

depleted.  

The application for a mining permit must be filed along with a feasibility study and a plan for the 

development and exploitation of the deposits which shall include, inter alia, an environmental and 

social impact study and a mitigation and rehabilitation plan. 

4.2.3 MINING AGREEMENT  

The Mining Code provides that exploration and exploitation permits shall be accompanied by a 

mining Agreement (Section 4, Art. 30-39, 2003 Code; Convention minière) that the State will 

conclude with the titleholder. 

The Mining Agreement supplements the provisions of the Mining Code and specifies the rights and 

obligations of the parties. The Mining Agreement guarantees stabilization of financial and customs 

regulations and rates during the period of the exploitation to reflect the rates in place at the date of 

signing. The Agreement is valid for a maximum of 25 years and is renewable for successive periods 

of 10 years. 

4.3 Royalties, Back-in Rights, Payments, Encumbrances  

The mining permits are subject to a 10% carried ownership interest to the benefit of the Government 

of Burkina Faso. In addition, once a Mining Convention is signed and an exploitation permit is 

awarded by the government, a graduated royalty applies on the prevailing gold price. Below 

$1,000 /oz, the royalty is 3% on the revenue. At a gold price between $1,000 and $1,300 /oz, the 

royalty is 4%. Above $1,300 /oz, a 5% royalty needs to be paid. Moreover, a 1% development tax 

must be applied on the total revenue.  

The Nabanga Permit is subject to a Net Profit Royalty (NPR) of 1% assigned to the original vendor 

(Mr. Sayouba Sawadogo).

All phases of development on the Property will be subject to some environmental regulations related 

to various concerns, such as maintenance of air and water quality standards, land reclamation, waste 

disposal.  

DRA/Met-Chem is not aware of any environmental liabilities to which the Property may be subjected. 

However, DRA/Met-Chem has not investigated any environmental liabilities that may arise from 

previous work.  

4.5 Required Permits  

SEMAFO completed exploration work and drilling between 2016 and 2018 on the Nabanga Permit. 

Future exploration or drilling can probably be completed under the existing permits or it can be 

reasonably be expected that new permits will be issued by the Authorities.  

The Project will require a number of approvals, permits and authorizations throughout all stages of 

development and an Industrial Operating Permit will be required prior to initiation of mining. 

4.6 Significant Factors or Risks  

DRA/Met-Chem is not aware of any significant factors, risks or encumbrances that may affect access, 

title, or the right or ability to perform work on the Property. DRA/Met-Chem has not verified the validity 

of title or rights on the Property. DRA/Met-Chem relied on information provided by SEMAFO on these 

matters (Section 3 – Reliance on Other Experts).   

4.7 Conclusions  

Although a new Mining Code has been formalized into law in 2015, importantly, it respects clauses 

in existing Mining Agreement. Indeed, the new Mining Code (Article 212) specifies that the mining 

titles and Mining Agreements valid at the time the 2015 Code became effective remain valid for the 

duration and substances for which they were granted.  

The information in this section is only a summary description of some of the rights and obligations 

pertaining to the mining exploration titles in Burkina Faso. The reader seeking full, up to date and 

official information on titles or rights and obligations of the permit holders should refer to the Mining 

Code of Burkina Faso available at the following link:

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility 

The Property is accessible from Ouagadougou by travelling 220 km to the east via all-weather, paved 

Highway RN04 (Route Nationale) to Fada-N'Gourma. Proceeding approximately 80 km southward 

along paved RN18 will lead to about 15 km east of the Property. A gravel road that crosses the 

Kompienga River provides the main access to the Property and different sectors of the Property can 

be reached by various roads, drill tracks and trails. 

Access during the rainy season may be problematic, particularly where the road crosses the river. 

However, alternate routes allow access from the west for the greater part of the year. Access to the 

different prospect areas is excellent during the dry season.  

5.2 Climate 

Three (3) principal climate zones can be distinguished in Burkina Faso:  

• Sahelian zone in the north: semi-arid steppe, characterized by three to five months of rainfall; 

• Sahelian-Sudanian zone, across the center of Burkina Faso; 

• Sudanian zone in the south: increasingly tropical wet-dry type climate, with a greater variability 

of temperature and greater total rainfall than in the north.  

The Property is located in the southern portion of the Sahelian-Sudanian zone. The region is under 

semi-arid climatic conditions, characterized by a rainy season from May to September and a dry 

season between October and April (Table 5.1). During the dry season, the harmattan, a dry wind 

blowing from the northeast or east off the Sahara desert, carries large amounts of dust over hundreds 

of kilometers. 

A hot, dry period extends from February to April in the Project area. April is the warmest month of 

the year, with an average temperature of 32.1°C, and January has the lowest average temperature 

at 25.0°C (Table 5.1).  

The prevailing winds in the Fada-N'Gourma region blow from the N-NE and S-SW (Figure 5.1).

002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

A year-round mining operation under the weather conditions at the Nabanga site is possible, as 

attested by the currently active mines in the region.. 

5.3 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

Fada-N'Gourma is the nearest town where basic services and supplies are available. With a 

population of 61,000 (2017 census, Wikipedia or 33,910, World Population Review), it is serviced by 

a hospital, hotels, and a 991 m long dirt-surface landing strip. 

Specialized services and equipment have to be sourced in Ouagadougou. Mining manpower would 

likely be from local and expatriate personnel. 

Currently power is envisioned to be provided by on-site generation, but may be either from the 

Kompienga dam power station or from the regional electricity grid. The Project is 10 km away from 

a hydro-power line. 

Kompienga Lake is in close proximity to the southwestern sector of the Property and the Kompienga 

River crosses the easternmost part of the Nabanga Permit. An east-flowing tributary crosses the 

center of the northern tier of the Permit. These bodies may represent a source of water for the mining 

operation. 

Development of the Project will require upgrade or construction of infrastructure, such as: road 

access, water and power supply, waste dumps and tailings storage areas, leach pad areas, as well 

as plant and camp facilities. 

5.4 Physiography 

The Property area is at an elevation of about 200 m above seal level and is relatively flat. 

The mineralized structures form minor, elevated ridges which may rise some 10 m to 20 m above 

the surrounding plains. 

5.5 Vegetation 

The majority of the Burkina Faso landmass, including the region of the Project, lies on a savannah 

plateau 200 m to 300 m above sea level. Plant life in the Project area is mainly restricted to tall grass, 

shrubs and isolated trees, notably of the acacia species. A tendency towards deforestation by human 

causes is observed. 

Scattered plots of cultivated land are present on the Project around small settlements of a few 

houses.  

5.6 Surface Rights 

Considering the size of the Property and of the adjacent permits owned by SEMAFO, it seems clear 

that the surface area is sufficient to accommodate the needs of a mining operation.

6 HISTORY 

6.1 Prior Ownership and Ownership Changes  

The Nabanga Permit was originally granted to Mr. Sayouba Sawadogo on April 1, 2008 by decree 

No. 2008-08-059/MCE/SG/DGMGC. The permit covered a surface area of 238 km2 that was reduced 

by 25% to its current 178.50 km2 upon the second renewal. The permit was subsequently acquired 

under an option agreement by Birimian Resources Sarl, a company 100% owned by SEMAFO under 

the acquisition of Orbis Gold Limited (Orbis) in 2015. The permit is currently registered under the 

name of Birimian Resources Sarl.  

Birimian Resources was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mt Isa Metals Limited (Mt Isa), a mining 

company headquartered in Brisbane, Australia, that changed its name for Orbis on August 9, 2012. 

Mt Isa acquired a series of mining properties in Burkina Faso and started exploration in 2010.  

Five contiguous exploration permits forming the Yactibo Permit Group were acquired in 2007 and 

2008: the Ouargaye, Nabanga, Kamsongo, Yacti and Nabanga permits. The Napadé permit was 

added in 2011 and filled a gap between the Nabanga and Kamsongo permits.  

6.2 Previous Mineral Exploration Work  

No exploration is known to have occurred on the Yactibo permits prior to their acquisition by Mr. 

Sawadogo in 2008.  

Orbis initiated exploration on the Property in 2010 with reconnaissance and field mapping, which 

identified the trends of several artisanal mining sites. Grab samples of quartz vein material collected 

from heaps or from shallow artisanal workings at Nabanga averaged 14.48 g/t Au. The presence of 

gold mineralization in the Nabanga structure was defined over a 3.5 km strike length and a sub-

parallel gold-bearing structure was identified. 

High-resolution satellite imagery (QuickBird imaging satellite) was also acquired by Orbis and was 

used primarily for regional reconnaissance mapping and delineating the artisanal mining sites. These 

data were utilized to identify targets for follow-up exploration.  

Several regional soil sampling programs were initiated across the Yactibo Permit Group in 2010. The 

soil samples were collected at 100 m intervals along 800 m nominal line spacing. Infill sampling 

followed within Kamsongo and Natanga along distances reduced to 50 m between the samples along 

lines 200 m apart. The results from the soil samples correlated well with the rock chips samples 

(Snowden Mining Industry Consultants Pty. Ltd.; "Snowden" Report, 2015).  

A high-resolution airborne magnetic-radiometric survey was flown by New Resolution Geophysics 

(NRG) of South Africa and Australia in 2011. The Nabanga structure was interpreted from the 

magnetic data to extend over approximately 9 km along the strike. Details and illustrations on the 

geochemical and geophysical surveys are presented in Snowden's 2015 technical report.

On January 20, 2011, Orbis announced that they had confirmed the presence of a gold deposit on 

the Property by widely-spaced RC drill holes. In September 2011, Orbis issued a press release about 

the discovery of the 500 m long Central and 600 m long North Zones at Nabanga.  

Additional drilling in 2011-2012 provided the data for the initial resource estimate prepared by 

Snowden in 2012. The resource focused on a 2.3 km length of the known Nabanga structure.  

On September 25, 2013, Orbis announced that deeper drilling had shown that the Nabanga 

mineralization extends below 200 m from surface, although follow-up drilling suggested a significant 

weakening of the structure below 200 m.  

Soil sampling and Induced Polarization (IP) surveys conducted in 2013 identified linear anomalies 

that were interpreted as possible strike extensions or potential new "Nabanga-style" mineralized 

bodies. The samples from trenches excavated in 2013 across many of the anomalies indicated a 

potential strike extension to the SW of the known main Nabanga mineralized structure.  

In 2014, Pells Sullivan Meynink, Australia, was contracted by Orbis to provide conceptual 

geotechnical risk assessment study pertaining to a potential future underground or open pit mining 

operation at the Nabanga project (Orbis Gold Ltd; Nabanga Project, Scoping Study; Preliminary 

Geotechnical Assessment; Rep. PSM1814-003R; January 2014). 

Several phases of historical metallurgical test work were completed for the Nabanga Project. These 

are documented in reports that include:  

• Pathfinder Exploration Pty Ltd – Petrographic and Mineragraphic Descriptions – 2011; 

• Pathfinder Exploration Pty Ltd – SEM Analyses of Samples NARC040; 66 m to 67 m and 69 m 

to 70 m, for Mt Isa Metals Ltd. – 6 June 2012; 

• JK Tech – SMC Test Report; Mt Isa Metals Ltd. (Orbis Gold former name) – July 2012; 

• Lycopodium – Nabanga Project Metallurgical Testwork Review – October 2012; 

• Knight Piesold Consulting – Memorandum to Mt Isa Metals Ltd. (Orbis Gold former name); re: 

Preliminary Waste Rock Geochemical Characterisation – 22 October 2012; 

• ALS Metallurgy – Metallurgical testwork conducted upon samples from Nabanga Gold Project 

for Orbis Gold – November 2013 (Chemical analyses, Gravity separation; Flotation; Leaching). 

Additional information and illustrations on previous exploration are provided in Snowden's 2015 

technical report. 

6.3 Previous Mineral Resources and Production 

6.3.1 HISTORICAL RESOURCES – SNOWDEN 2012  

A previous JORC (2004) compliant resources estimate for the gold mineralization of Nabanga was 

performed by Snowden for Orbis in August 2012 and is documented in a technical report (Snowden;

Orbis Gold Ltd; Nabanga Mineral Resource Estimate; Project No. 03771; September 2012) and an 

internal report by Orbis entitled: "Nabanga Gold Project, Nabanga Desktop Study – For Internal Use 

Only; 9/01/2015; Report No: INT – RPT 047, Rev 2g). The results from this historical estimate are 

presented in Table 6.1.  

The holes drilled until August 2, 2012 were used in the resources estimate. Out of 390 RC and core 

holes drilled on the Property, 385 of which were RC holes, and a database of 17,895 assay results, 

Snowden used all 239 RC holes and 14 diamond drill holes directly associated with the zone of 

interest in their resources estimate. 

The resource was estimated applying a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au, a minimum mining width of 1.5 m 

and a top cut at 70 g/t Au. Grade interpolation was performed using the Ordinary Kriging method.

6.3.2 HISTORICAL RESOURCES – SNOWDEN 2015 

The resources estimated in 2012 were revised by Snowden in 2015 based on the same drill data 

they used in 2012 (as at August 2, 2012) but applying modified parameters. The CIM Definition 

Standards and the NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure were used for the revised resources. 

The 2015 historical resources are the subject of a published NI 43-101 Technical Report by 

Snowden: "SEMAFO Inc., Yactibo Permit, Nabanga Gold Deposit; Project No. AU4582, NI 43-101 

Technical Report, June 2015; Final".

6.3.3 HISTORICAL RESOURCES – CONCLUSIONS  

DRA/Met-Chem and the issuer are neither treating the 2012 nor the 2015 historical estimates as 

current mineral resources or mineral reserves. The historical resources are only mentioned in this 

Report for the sake of completeness and they are superseded by the more recent and current 

estimate presented in this Report. The present resource includes the results from the later holes by 

Orbis disregarded in the 2012 estimate and from additional drilling by SEMAFO in 2016-2018. 

Although the historical resources are based on the CIM definitions, the QP has not done sufficient 

work to classify the historical estimates as current estimates, and an updated estimate is used in this 

Report. 

No reserves were estimated by Orbis for the Nabanga mineralization. 

The Reader is cautioned that Mineral Resources, that are not Mineral Reserves, do not have 

demonstrated economic viability. 

6.4 Previous Mineral Production 

The Property has not been the subject of prior commercial production from gold mineralization. 

However, gold has been extracted for an unknown period of time by the local community from shallow 

artisanal workings ("Orpaillage"). Gold is still mined manually on these sites, with only minor use of 

semi-mechanized machinery such as small crushers. Free gold is recovered by gravity (panning) 

and the tails are often sold for further processing of the fine gold. Alternatively, the unprocessed 

extracted gold-bearing material may be sold for off-site processing. 

Artisanal mining sites within the Nabanga permit occur along 3.6 km of the NE-SW trending Nabanga 

mineralization. The vertical extent of the workings is unknown; however, they are thought to reach a 

maximum depth of approximately 40 m below surface although the majority of the workings are 

probably less than 10 m deep. 

It appears that the miners have predominantly targeted the higher-grade vein within the core of the 

Nabanga mineralization, possibly leaving out the lower-grade material in the hanging-wall and 

footwall selvages. Although the tonnage and grade of the mineralization extracted from Nabanga are 

unknown they are not material to the resources estimate by virtue of the relatively limited tonnage 

removed.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1 Regional Geology 

Burkina Faso is located in the Leo-Man Shield (Rise) that forms the southern exposure of the West 

African Craton (WAC). The Leo-Man Shield comprises an Archean nucleus, the Kénéma–Man 

domain (3.60–2.70 Ga) centered on Liberia, and the Paleoproterozoic Baoulé-Mossi domain (2.30 – 

2.00 Ga) to the east (Figure 7.1).  

The geology of Burkina Faso is dominated by the Baoulé-Mossi Domain consisting of granite-gneiss 

terrains, "Birimian" greenstone belts and basins (Junner, 1940; Bessoles, 1977) and the fluvio-deltaic 

basins of the Tarkwaian Sequence (e.g. Baratoux et al., 2011; Gasquet et al., 2003). Sediments of 

Neoproterozoic age overlie the Paleoproterozoic basement in the SE of Burkina Faso (Volta 

sedimentary basin) and skirt the western edge of the country (Taoudeni basin). 

The Paleoproterozoic Birimian granite-greenstone province was established and structured during 

the Eburnean Orogeny (2,195 Ma to 2,067 Ma; Pohl, 1988).  

The N-NE trending, elongated greenstone belts comprise mafic tholeiitic volcanic rocks together with 

intermediate and acid calc-alkaline effusive suites that are typical of volcanic arc environments, 

interbedded with volcano-sedimentary units. They are bound by older granite-gneiss terrains and 

have been intruded by syn- to late-tectonic granite bodies.  

Multiple episodes of intrusion have been distinguished in the granitoid domain (2,153 Ma to 2,097±7 

Ma), such as the plutons belonging to the tonalite, trondhjemite, granodiorite (TTG) suite and granitic 

intrusions (Gasquet et al., 2003). The syn-orogenic foliated granitoid batholiths were emplaced into 

the basin centres and the late orogenic, unfoliated intrusions occur within the Upper Series volcanic 

belts (Leube et al., 1990).    

The Birimian sedimentary basins are elongated or broad units dominated by greywacke and shales, 

and they occasionally contain lavas and chemical sedimentary rocks.  

The rocks of the Birimian Supergroup have been subdivided into two main series regarded as being 

time equivalents (Appiah et al., 1991):  

• Lower Series; chiefly sediments: argillite, phyllite, schist and meta-greywacke with subordinate 

volcanic rocks, metamorphosed to greenschist facies (Appiah et al., 1991; Dzigbodi-Adjimah, 

1993); 

• Upper Series; predominantly volcanic rocks: andesitic tuff, tholeiitic basalt, with associated 

basic intrusive rocks and interbedded graphitic phyllite.   

Younger granitoids and lavas (2.10 and 2.07 Ga) were mostly emplaced in the western portion of the 

Baoulé-Mossi domain and along the contact zone with the Archean craton (Egal et al., 2002; Hirdes 

and Davis, 2002; Liégeois et al., 1991).

The Tarkwaian basins are generally bounded by regional-scale shear zones, tectonised sequences 

made up of conglomerate, quartzite and shale that are discordant on Birimian formations (Davis et 

al., 1994; Perrouty et al., 2012). The Tarkwa formation (2,081 ±25 Ma to 1,968 ±49 Ma; Hirdes et al.; 

1987) was defined in Ghana where it covers vast areas and hosts large gold deposits. Although the 

composition of the conglomeratic facies varies according to the rocks forming the substratum, all 

were deposited after the first tectono-metamorphic phase (D1). No Tarkwaian rocks have been found 

within the main Birimian basins of the Lower Series.

7.2 Structural Evolution of the Eburnean Orogeny 

The present-day structural trend of litho-tectonic units and the dominant fabrics in the WAC formed 

during the Eburnean orogeny (Bonhomme, 1962; Eisenlohr and Hirdes, 1992; Feybesseet et al., 

2006; Lemoine et al., 1990; Milési et al., 1989; Milesi et al., 1992; Perrouty et al., 2012). The number 

of deformation phases characterizing the Eburnean orogeny is still under debate. However, the

presence of an early phase of contractional deformation and medium- to high-grade metamorphism 

followed by two phases of transcurrent tectonics and low-grade metamorphic overprint is generally 

recognized (Block et al., 2015; Caby et al., 2000;Debat et al., 2003; Galipp et al., 2003; Ganne et al., 

2012; John et al.,1999; Klemd et al., 2002; Liégeois et al., 1991; Opare-Addo et al.,1993; Pitra et al., 

2010; Triboulet and Feybesse, 1998).  

The first deformation stage (D1; around 2,100 – 2,090 Ma) is characterized by collision thrusting in 

a southerly direction of the Lower Proterozoic over the Archean craton (Milesi, 1989). The second 

transcurrent tectono-metamorphic phase (D2; 2,096 – 2,073 Ma in the north of the Ivory Coast; 

Milesi, 1989) caused regional folds and N-S to NE-SW strike-slip faults. The subsequent transcurrent 

D3 deformation phase (2,091 ± 33 Ma to 2,073 ± 7 Ma in southern Mali) is marked by the 

development of large-scale folds controlled by regional shear zones responsible for the general NE-

SW structuring of most of the WAC. The D1-D3 deformations form a continuous and overlapping 

time sequence. 

7.3 Local Geology 

The Yactibo Permit Group straddles a major NE-trending shear separating the Youga Belt in the 

northwest from the Diapaga Belt in the southeast. The Nabanga deposit is located to the southeast 

of the shear, in the Diapaga Belt, which is the easternmost Belt in Burkina Faso (Figure 7.2).  

The Diapaga Belt is dominantly comprised of metamorphosed intermediate volcanic rocks, 

sediments, foliated or migmatitic granite and gneiss, with less common mafic volcanic rocks and 

mafic-ultramafic intrusive complexes. Conglomeratic sediments are present and are mapped as 

Tarkwaian equivalents. Early banded or and/or foliated granitoids, which may be ascribed to the TTG 

Group, are also very common. 

7.4 Property Geology 

The main feature on the Property is the granodiorite hosting the mineralization. The intrusion is in 

contact on the north with an assemblage of volcanic rocks (Figure 7.2). 

The weathering profile in the Nabanga deposit area is relatively shallow and the contact with the 

fresh rock is generally crossed at a vertical depth of 10 m to 21 m.

The main lithologies encountered on the Nabanga permit consist of granodiorite, diorite, amphibolite 

and the quartz vein.  

7.4.1.1 Granodiorite 

The granodiorite is medium- to coarse-grained and contains 10-20% anhedral quartz, 40-60% 

plagioclase, 15% K-feldspar and some amphibole, biotite and magnetite (Rugless, 2011). Weak 

chlorite-epidote-sericite alteration is observable. The granodiorite often exhibits weak to very weak 

foliation that increases as the quartz-gold mineralization is approached. 

The intrusive includes rafts or xenoliths of chlorite-sericite-biotite schist preserving relict phyric 

plagioclase that are interpreted to represent a basalt or a basaltic andesite metamorphosed to low-

grade greenschist facies. Trace pyrite occurs within the mafic schist that appears to be largely 

unmineralized.

7.4.1.2 Amphibolite 

In the immediate proximity of the Nabanga mineralization, the granodiorite is interpreted to intrude a 

sequence of amphibolite (porphyritic basalt to andesite precursor; Rugless, 2011) that is represented 

by multiple, disconnected lenses within the granodiorite. The geophysical data suggest the 

granodiorite is semi-concordant with the meta-volcanic and/or meta-sedimentary layering. The 

amphibolite is made up of chlorite and actinolite, with minor relict feldspar phenocrysts and rare 

sulphides, and exhibits a weak to moderate pervasive foliation. 

7.4.1.3 Diorite 

A fine- to medium-grained diorite identified by drilling is believed to represent a different phase from 

the granodiorite, owing to its very low magnetic susceptibility, but does not appear to have any impact 

on the mineralization. 

7.4.1.4 Quartz Vein 

A massive, white quartz vein hosts the majority of the gold mineralization.  

7.5 Mineralization 

The gold-bearing structure at Nabanga is predominantly hosted within a magnetite-rich granodiorite 

intrusive that is part of the Birimian Diapaga greenstone belt. The mineralization is associated with a 

sheared quartz vein bracketed by a distinctive alteration halo and development of minor (<1%) pyrite. 

The Nabanga mineralization is manifest on surface by a NE-trending zone of shallow artisanal gold 

mining site that extends over a 3.5 km strike length.  

The main Nabanga gold mineralization is hosted in a single structure extending over 3.5 km, but 

traceable over several kilometers along the strike to the southwest, beyond the limits of the surface 

gold workings, based on data from high resolution magnetic surveys and exploration work.  

The main deposit is of high-grade gold type, which is evidenced by a moderate reduction of the 

contained gold ounces as the cut-off grade is raised (Historical Resources, 6.3.1and 6.3.2). 

The overall strike of the Nabanga mineralized structure is NE-SW and the dip varies between 55° 

and 70° toward the northwest. It has an average horizontal thickness of 3.2 m. A large proportion of 

the high gold values are contained within the quartz vein. The mineralization is arranged as a series 

of shoots plunging at 45º to the NE. The mineralization is often lower-grade and/or narrower where 

the main zone is hosted in the amphibolite. 

The Nabanga deposit is divided into the North, Central and Southern Extension Zones. A sub-

parallel, 800 m long structure referred to as the Nabanga North Lode is present to the NW.

Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses of specimens collected from RC hole NARC040 

show that the gold occurs as fine (>10 µm) gold ± silver telluride inclusions within pyrite grains 

(Rugless, 2012). Cavalerite (gold telluride, AuTe2) inclusions were observed under the SEM within 

pyrite grains.  

Additional information and illustrations such as photomicrographs of thin sections under the 

petrographic and electron microscopes are provided in Snowden's technical report (2015).  

7.6 Alteration 

The granodiorite host has been variously altered by the mineralizing event, as evidenced by the 

presence of a sericite-biotite-hematite-chlorite assemblage. Sulphide minerals, mostly pyrite and 

chalcopyrite, are relatively uncommon (Pathfinder Exploration Pty. Ltd.; Rugless, 2011). 

7.7 Structure 

The Nabanga mineralized structure is crosscut by three (3) faults highlighted in the geophysical 

surveys and confirmed by drilling. The faults are inferred to be sub-vertical and steeply dipping (80º) 

to the NW. The mineralized structure tends to rotate east and to become shallower as it approaches 

the faults, which would be indicative of an oblique fault movement.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 

The Yactibo Permit Group is located within the world-class Birimian Gold Province that hosts most 

of the major gold deposits in West Africa, notably in Ghana, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, and 

Senegal. For example, the Obuasi Mine in Ghana started production in 1897 with over 20 million 

ounces of gold extracted until its suspension in 2014. It is currently under re-development. Other 

large gold deposits include Sadiola (8 million oz Au) and Morila (5.9 million oz Au) in Mali.  

Most Birimian deposits correspond to orogenic quartz lodes with gold or gold associated with 

sulphides or tourmaline. 

A widely used classification of the West African primary gold deposits has been developed by Milesi 

et al. (1989), based on the type of host rock, the host structure, the geometry of the deposit and its 

paragenesis: 

• Type 1: Gold associated with sulphides in tourmalinised turbidites; pre-orogenic deposits 

(Loulo in Mali); 

• Type 2: Gold with disseminated sulphides and associated hydrothermal alteration in tholeitic 

volcanic rocks; syn-orogenic deposits (Yaouré in Ivory Coast; Syama in Mali); 

• Type 3: Gold-bearing paleo-placer quartz pebble conglomerates; syn-orogenic deposits 

(Tarkwa, Tereberie, Iduaprem in Ghana); 

• Type 4: Mesothermal, late-orogenic lode quartz with gold-bearing arsenopyrite associated with 

regional structures in metasediments or dykes and sills; tardi-orogenic deposits (Ashanti, 

Prestea, Konongo in Ghana; Afema in Ivory Coast); 

• Type 5: Mesothermal, native gold and polymetallic sulphides in quartz veins in shear zones 

usually exhibiting evidence of hydrothermal alteration; tardi-orogenic deposits (Sabodala in 

Senegal; Poura in Burkina Faso; Kalana in Mali). 

The secondary gold mineralization has been classified as: 

• Alluvial and eluvial placers; mined by "orpailleurs" throughout the shield; 

• Colluvial, transported material; nugget gold in laterite with no evident underlying primary 

mineralization.  

The Nabanga mineralization is considered to belong to the intrusion-hosted, epigenetic, 

mesothermal class of gold deposits that includes world-class deposits such as Fort Knox and Pogo 

(Alaska), Vasilkovskoe (Russia), Ahafo and Chirano (Sefwi Belt of Ghana). 

Alternatively, the Nabanga deposit belongs to a distinct group that has been generally recognized 

and accepted during the last decade as a type of gold-only deposits associated with moderately 

reduced granodiorite-granite stocks and batholiths (Thompson and Newberry, 2000. Lang and 

Baker, 2001.Hart, 2005).  

SEMAFO has applied this model as a basis on which the exploration and development programs 

were planned.

9 EXPLORATION 

Exploration by SEMAFO on the Nabanga and the adjacent permits included establishment of a line 

grid, field mapping, outlining the different artisanal mining sites, geochemical and geophysical 

surveying and an important auger drilling program (Figure 9.1). 

In May and June 2017, SEMAFO completed regional reconnaissance mapping. 

Systematic auger drilling, logging and whole-rock analysis by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) of the 

recovered material was carried out on the Nabanga, Kamsongo and Napadé permits. Sahara 

Geoservices, an exploration services company with an office in Ouagadougou, was hired to carry 

out the auger drilling programs. 

In 2018, 8,530 holes were drilled to a nominal depth of 5 m for a cumulative total of 41,923 m, which 

generated 16,994 samples (Table 9.1). Three gas-powered auger drill rigs were mobilized on April 

14, 2018 and started investigating the Nabanga North sector. The holes were drilled at 25 m spacing 

along lines 800 m apart, oriented along azimuth N135⁰. Between June 26 and July 14, 2018, three 

rigs were active on the Nabanga Extension block. The holes were drilled along a grid at 400 m by 25 

m intervals, with the lines oriented N135°. Auger drilling is a cost-effective method for geochemical 

sampling. Vertical holes are drilled to the in-situ saprolite horizon and samples taken from both the 

laterite/saprolite interface and within the saprolite. Sample size is approximately 2-3 kg. 

Generally, auger drilling returned anomalous values that confirmed the regional NE geophysical 

trends in the Yactibo permits.

In August 2018, SEMAFO collected 38 quarter core samples from holes NADD18-0005 and 

NADD18-0021 drilled in 2018 in the Nabanga permit to be submitted for whole-rock analysis. The 

purpose of this lithogeochemical work was to characterize the geochemical signature of the 

hydrothermal alteration at Nabanga, more specifically, the hematitic alteration.  

Exploration work outside of the Nabanga permit is not part of the present study, but the results from 

exploration and development work by SEMAFO on the adjacent permits add to the general 

understanding of the general geology, structure and the controlling factors on the gold mineralization.

10 DRILLING 

10.1 Drilling by Orbis 

10.1.1 METHODOLOGY 

A first RC drilling program completed by Orbis (Mt. Isa) in 2010 over the entire 3.5 km length of 

exposed artisanal workings of Nabanga confirmed the discovery of the Nabanga gold deposit. A 

press release from Mt. Isa dated January 20, 2011 announced that 20 out of 21 widely spaced holes 

intersected gold mineralization of greater than 0.5 g/t Au, with an average of 5.66 g/t Au over a core 

intersection 4.6 m. (Source: Minenportal https://www.minenportal.de/unternehmen_degelistet.php?

mid=1373&sid=32288&lang=en). 

This was followed by additional drilling in mid-2011 and in 2011-2012, which culminated with an initial 

mineral resource estimate in 2012.  

Follow-up drilling in 2013 suggested a significant weakening of the Nabanga structure below the 

vertical depth of 200 m. A further five (5) stepout RC holes drilled in 2013 along strike to the northeast 

intersected insignificant mineralization. However, SEMAFO showed that the holes had been 

designed to test a misinterpreted plunge of the high-grade shoots, which led Orbis to conclude that 

the known mineralization was closed off to the northeast.  

Drilling at Nabanga by Orbis was performed by a combination of RC and diamond drill holes. Except 

for a few cored from surface, the diamond drill holes were generally pre-collared using RC drilling to 

a maximum depth of 200 m below surface, down to approximately 10 m above the interpreted top of 

mineralization. The RC holes were extended by coring (NQ core tails, 47.6 mm diameter) through 

the mineralization. These holes are identified as Multi-purpose (MP) holes in the database. 

A total of 441 holes were drilled by Orbis between 2010 and 2013, and 390 of them were used in the 

initial resource estimation of 2012 (Table 10.1). All the holes drilled at Nabanga are listed in Table 

10.1, but the RC or RAB holes drilled outside of the Nabanga permit are omitted.

Drilling the Nabanga deposit was carried out on NE-SW sections, on a nominal spacing of 40 m 

along strike and 20 m across strike. Drilling in the sector between 1 249 850 mN and 1 250 300 mN 

was tightened to approximately 30 m. As all holes were drilled at plunges ranging from 50º to 70º to 

the SE, they intersected the mineralization at angles of no less than 45º. 

The main Nabanga deposit is divided into the North, Central and Southern Extension Zones. Drilling 

aimed at a sub-parallel structure to the NW, referred to as the Nabanga North Lode, returned 2 m of 

core length at 8.32 g/t Au as the best value. The majority of the results suggest that the mineralization 

in the North Lode is narrow, discontinuous and generally of low-grade (>0.3 g/t Au).  

10.1.2 DRILL HOLE COLLAR LOCATION 

No topographic survey had been conducted on the deposit at the time of the resource estimation and 

Snowden recommended Orbis undertake a survey to enable a more accurate depiction of surface. 

A Digital Terrain Model (DTM) produced as part of the airborne geophysical survey was conducted 

over the project area in 2011 but was only used for drill planning purposes.  

Upon completion of drilling, the collar locations were surveyed using a Trimble GeoExplorer 6000 

Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). The stated accuracy of the instrument is 1.0 cm in 

the X-Y directions and 1.5 cm in the Z direction.  

Snowden used the collar elevations (RL) to produce a topographic surface in the immediate Nabanga 

area by triangulation for use in the resource estimate. Whilst not optimal, given the relatively flat 

topography and the early project status at the time, using this surface to constrain the resource was 

considered as reasonable.  

10.1.3 DOWNHOLE DEVIATION SURVEY 

The deviation path of all drill holes was surveyed using digital, single and multi-shot cameras. A 

Campteq and a Reflex Ez-trac multi-shot camera, both with an accuracy of ±0.5° for azimuth 

measurements and ±0.2° for dip measurements, were used for the downhole surveys. A reading was 

taken below the casing, at about 6 m and every 30 m thereafter. The 30 m spacing was adjusted, or 

one reading was added in order to have a measurement at the bottom of the holes.

002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

Snowden noted that the instruments can be influenced by the magnetic interference from the 

surrounding rocks. However, Snowden thought that this interference was unlikely to be material to 

the resource estimate, given the low magnetic susceptibility around the deposit (in the order of 

24,600n Tesla). Yet, Snowden recommended assessing the accuracy of the downhole surveys using 

a method that is not impacted by magnetic interference, such as the gyroscope or optical technique. 

Snowden checked the data for possible unusual deviations both in plan and section and no issues 

were identified except for three holes. DRA/Met-Chem did not detect any abnormal deviation in the 

azimuth or the plunge reported in the Downhole Survey Table of the drill database. 

10.1.4 LOGGING CORE AND RC CHIPS 

Upon completion of each core hole, the geologist at the drill site took a set of photographs and 

performed a quick log prior to moving the boxes to Orbis onsite facilities for detailed logging and 

sampling. The quick logs and the photographs were sent on a daily basis to the Orbis Brisbane office 

for review. The RC holes were logged at the rig site. 

Detailed logging of the drill core and RC chips included recording of lithology, alteration, sulphides 

percentage, vein composition and structural elements. Prior to 2013 logging was hand-written on a 

template and manually entered into the database. All logging after 2013 was done with Micromine 

Geobank Mobile software. The geologists used a library of geology codes to log in order to preserve 

consistency.  

10.1.5 RC SAMPLING BY ORBIS 

The drill cuttings from the RC holes were collected into polyethylene bags at the discharge of the 

cyclone for every meter. The mass of the samples was reduced to 2 kg using riffle splitters. The riffle 

splitters were cleaned after each sample with a brush. 

The 2-kg, one-meter samples of visually identified mineralization were placed into a polyethylene 

bag with a sample tag and shipped to the laboratory. Outside of the mineralized intervals, the 

samples for analysis were composited to 4-m lengths. The bags had been pre-labelled with the hole 

ID and the "From" and "To" meterages. The QC samples were inserted into the sample stream at 

this stage.  

Assays of 0.25 g/t or more on any 4-m composite were flagged for re-analysis of the four (4) original, 

individual 1-m intervals of the composite and of adjacent composites to bracket the identified 

mineralized section. 

For wet samples, holes were poked in the polypropylene bags containing the 1-m samples and the 

water was allowed to drain. The samples were then placed onto a black plastic sheet and, once dry 

they were homogenized by hand and split using the same process as the dry samples. Records of 

sampling show that RC samples were collected dry, moist and wet respectively 77%, 9% and 13% 

of the time.

DRA/Met-Chem Ref.: C3852-Nabanga-PEA-Final Report  
002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

RC drilling is designed to drill under dry or damp conditions. Even though DRA/Met-Chem realizes 

that it is possible to obtain good quality RC samples under wet drilling conditions, this is not 

recommended. Possible loss of fines in the slurry water or fines drained away through the holes 

pierced in the bags may compromise the sample quality. Adequate processing of wet samples 

involves the use of micro-pore bags that allow the water to drain while retaining the fine sample 

material or flocculation/decanting process. 

However, Snowden (2005) compared the analytical results from the wet RC samples and the 

corresponding core samples and did not see any significant difference. 

After extracting the 2-kg sub-samples, the entire 1-m sample bags for the initial RC holes were saved 

for future reference. Subsequently, Orbis only retained 2- to 3-kg splits from the full 1-m samples for 

storage in an enclosed shed on site. DRA/Met-Chem did not check this information provided by 

Snowden, and assumes this is still valid. 

The RC samples were shipped to the SGS Minerals Services (SGS) laboratory in Ouagadougou for 

assay. 

10.1.6 CORE SAMPLING BY ORBIS 

Core sampling was done on a nominal 1-m interval, adjusted to respect the lithological, mineralization 

or alteration contacts. The core was cut using a diamond blade saw and the right-hand half was 

systematically placed into a polyethylene bag and used for analytical work. The QC samples were 

inserted while preparing the core samples. 

The core samples were shipped to the SGS laboratory in Ouagadougou for assay. 

10.1.7 DRILL SAMPLES RECOVERY 

The global recovery of RC chips averaged 80% to 90%, but the values are distributed about two 

peaks, at 60% and at 100% (Figure 10.1). Recovery was calculated on the basis of the volume of a 

5¼ inch (127 mm hammer) diameter hole and an average bulk density of 2.8. 

The presence of two populations and the recoveries exceeding 100% suggests that some difficulties 

were experienced obtaining accurate measurements. It is generally accepted in the industry that a 

recovery of no less than 80% for a sample interval is required for a sample to be representative.  

In Snowden's opinion, the recovery was acceptable for representative samples and subsequent 

mineral resources estimation. The core recovery was reported by Snowden as excellent.  

DRA/Met-Chem did not verify this information provided by Snowden.

10.2 Drilling by SEMAFO 

10.2.1 2016 DRILLING PROGRAM 

In 2015, SEMAFO re-evaluated the results from all previous exploration and drill holes completed by 

Orbis and concluded that the property warranted additional drilling. SEMAFO designed the first 

phase of drilling aimed at investigating the SW Extension of the Nabanga mineralized structure, in 

an attempt to upgrade the potential of the Property. 

Major Drilling mobilized a DB-30 multi-purpose rig and started a program of reverse circulation (RC) 

holes. A total of 15 holes were drilled into the Nabanga SW Extension to a depth of 130 m to 135 m 

for a total of 1,959 m, between April 25 and May 8, 2016 (Table 10.2). The holes were drilled at an 

inclination of -50° toward azimuth 135°.  

Drilling continued until the month of July on the Kamsongo permit, but these holes outside of the 

Nabanga permit are not included in this Report.

The holes were designed to intersect at right angle the strike indicated by the major magnetic 

lineaments, the known Nabanga structure, the quartz veins observed in the artisanal mining sites 

("orpaillage"), as well as the trend of the soil anomalies detected by a local geochemical survey.  

The program was successful explaining the soil anomalies but, although widespread anomalous gold 

values were obtained, none of economic potential was encountered. 

10.2.2 2017 DRILLING PROGRAM 

10.2.2.1 Drilling 

The 2017 drilling program was completed by Forages Technic-Eau Burkina Sarl (FTE), a division of 

FTE headquartered in Canada. Drilling started with a T3W Reverse Circulation rig on March 1, 2017 

and 63 RC holes for a total of 6,861 m were completed on April 4, 2017 (Table 10.2). The length of 

the holes varied between 30 m and 150 m. 

Drilling was aimed primarily at six (6) proximal targets, parallel to and along, the southwest extension 

of the Nabanga deposit: Nabanga North, North-West, Centre, South-West (parallel and NW of 

Nabanga main deposit), South Extension (alongstrike), South-East (parallel and SE of Nabanga main 

deposit).  

As for the 2016 program, the holes in 2017 were planned to cross the known NE trends, with added 

information gained from the trenches excavated in 2013 over several magnetic anomalies, namely 

the N and S Extensions. The holes were drilled toward azimuth 145° (135° over Nabanga SW) at an 

inclination of -50°. 

Generally, the drilled portions of the structures returned low gold values and suggested lack of 

continuity. 

Auger drilling completed by SEMAFO in 2017 on the Nabanga, Kamsongo and Napadé permits is 

addressed under Section 9 – Exploration, as this technique was used as a tool to map the lithologies 

and explore for additional mineralization.  

10.2.2.2 Re-logging of RC Chips 

In November 2017, SEMAFO initiated a program of re-logging the chips from the RC holes drilled at 

Nabanga. In March 2018, 10,523 m from 105 RC holes were re-logged, with another 447 m in six (6) 

holes re-logged in April 2018. 

The purpose of re-logging was to gather consistent rocks descriptions in order to assist with the re-

interpretation of the geology and structure of the deposit. This effort was part of constructing a new 

model to help with subsequent development drilling.

002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

10.2.3 2018 DRILLING PROGRAM 

In 2018, SEMAFO updated the database used by Snowden for the resources estimations of 2012 

and 2015 that were based on the holes drilled until August 2, 2012. SEMAFO entered into the 

database the holes drilled by Orbis in 2012-2013 and the holes drilled by SEMAFO in 2016 and 2017. 

The new descriptions of geology from re-logging the RC chips in 2017-2018 were incorporated into 

the database. 

Building on these data, SEMAFO re-interpreted the geology and structure of the Nabanga deposit 

and updated the 3D geology model. The resulting interpretation suggested a shallower northerly 

plunge than previously interpreted of the high-grade shoots, strongly suggesting they could extend 

along strike and beyond the depth of 200 m. 

SEMAFO commissioned Geodrill Limited who mobilized a 900-9 diamond drill rig on March 25, 2018, 

a second core drill rig (900-10) on May 14, and a third drill (200/3) in June. A program of 25 diamond 

drill holes, for a total of 7,148.20 m, was completed between March 26 and June 28, 2018 to test the 

new interpretation by SEMAFO (Table 10.2). The holes were drilled toward azimuth 145° and started 

at a plunge of -60° and -70°. The length of the holes ranged from 126 m to 456 m. The rigs were 

equipped to retrieve NQ core size and all core was oriented. 

The 2018 program was successful in supporting the new interpretation of the Nabanga gold 

mineralization being hosted in a series of shallowly-plunging shoots of higher-grade mineralization, 

in contrast to the previous interpretation by Orbis. SEMAFO's interpretation and drilling results 

strongly suggested that the deposit is still open at depth and to the north, along the extension of the 

plunging shoots.

10.2.4 DRILL HOLE COLLAR LOCATIONS 

All drill hole collars were surveyed using a Trimble Geoexplorer 6000 differential global position 

system.   

10.2.5 DOWNHOLE DEVIATION SURVEY 

Holes were all surveyed downhole using a REFLEX GYRO™ electronic surveying tool. Both the 

azimuth and dip were recorded at intervals of approximately 5 m intervals downhole. The REFELX 

GYRO™ system is not affected by magnetic interference from either the drill rods or magnetic 

minerals. The accuracy of the system is reported to be ±0.5° when measuring azimuth and ±0.2° 

when measuring dip angle. 

The first reading was taken below the casing at about 6 m and every 5, 10, 15 or 20 m thereafter in 

the 2016 program, every 5 m in 2017 and every 25 m or 50 m in the core holes of 2018.

DRA/Met-Chem checked the results in the Downhole Survey Table of the drill database and did not 

detect any abnormal deviation in the azimuth or the plunge reported. 

10.2.6 LOGGING CORE AND RC CHIPS 

RC chips logging is performed by the geologists at the drill using a small quantity of cuttings for each 

meter drilled. This material is saved in chip boxes for future reference or re-logging. Recovery, 

lithology, mineralization (quartz, sulphide), alteration, texture and weathering were recorded.  

The core logging geologists records core recovery, RQD, lithology, quartz veins (type, percentage), 

sulphides, supergene alteration (weathering), oxidation, hydrothermal alteration, texture and 

structural elements (contacts, fractures, faults, shears, foliation schistosity). A table containing the 

specific gravity results was ignored as the data were considered as unreliable. A table containing the 

specific gravity results was ignored as the data were considered as unreliable. A total of 2,507 

measurements of α and β angles (strike and dip) of planar elements from 2018 oriented core samples 

are available in the database. 

All the data are recorded directly into dedicated software, Geobank Mobile and subsequently entered 

into an electronic database under the supervision of the project geologist and the exploration 

manager. The master database is managed by a GIS specialist. 

10.2.7 MAGNETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY DETERMINATIONS 

SEMAFO started a program of determination of the magnetic susceptibility of the lithologies 

intersected by core drilling on July 5, 2018. The magnetic susceptibility was measured systematically 

on 4,497 m of core in 14 holes in July and over 1,403 m from six (6) holes in August. Five (5) readings 

were systematically taken over 1-m intervals and the final result was calculated as the average of 

the five (5) measurements. 

10.2.8 RC SAMPLING 

RC chips sampling is performed by the geologists at the drill site at fixed intervals of 1-m as drilling 

progresses. The samples dispatched to the laboratory are reduced to 2 kg by multi-stage riffle splitter. 

The remainder of the sample is saved for future reference. 

10.2.9 CORE SAMPLING 

Core sampling was done on a nominal 1-m interval, adjusted to respect the lithological, mineralization 

or alteration contacts. The core was cut using a diamond blade saw and one half placed into a 

polyethylene bag and used for analytical work. The QC samples were inserted while preparing the 

core samples. 

DRA/Met-Chem noticed that the samples occasionally straddle the main contacts.

The core samples were shipped to the SGS Minerals Services laboratory (SGS) in Ouagadougou for 

assay. 

10.2.10 DRILL SAMPLE RECOVERY 

Core recovery was excellent with 95% of the core drilled at a rate of ≥95% recovery. 

10.2.11 CONCLUSIONS 

DRA/Met-Chem has not observed any drilling, sampling or recovery factors that could materially 

impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY 

11.1 Samples from Orbis – 2010-2013 Programs 

11.1.1 INTRODUCTION 

The drill core and RC samples were submitted to three (3) different laboratories, all at their facilities 

in Ouagadougou, for preparation and assay: 

• BIGS: core samples;  

• ALS: samples from holes NARC001 to NARC091; 

• SGS: RC samples subsequent to NARC091. 

11.1.2 SAMPLE PREPARATION 

The samples at SGS were dried at 105° for a minimum of 6 hours, weighted and crushed to 80% 

passing 2 mm (10 mesh). A 1.5-kg coarse split was extracted with a rotary or riffle splitter and 

reduced to 85% passing 75µm (200 mesh) in a bowl and puck pulveriser. A 200-g sub-sample was 

collected by scooping from the 1.5-kg pulp and used for analysis. 

At ALS Minerals Services (ALS), the samples were crushed to 70% passing 2 mm and quartered to 

obtain a 250-g split. The 250-g riffle split was pulverized to better than 85% passing 75μm and 

quartered to get a 50-g split.  

BIGS Global Burkina (BIGS) crushed the samples to <2mm using a Boyd jaw crusher and prepared 

a sample of approximately 1 kg using a riffle splitter to be processed by an LM2 pulveriser to 90% 

passing 75µm. 

11.1.3 SAMPLE ANALYSIS 

All samples were analyzed by Fire Assay (FA) on 50 g aliquots with an Atomic Absorption 

Spectroscopy (AAS) finish. The lower detection limit was 0.01 ppm for SGS and ALS and 0.001 ppm 

at BIGS. The samples exceeding the upper detection limit were re-assayed using a 50-g fire assay 

procedure with a gravimetric finish. 

11.1.4 INTERNAL QA/QC PROCEDURES 

All preparation equipment at SGS was flushed with barren material prior to commencement of the 

job and the crushers and pulverisers were cleaned with compressed air between each sample. SGS 

screened one in 30 samples to ensure a grind of 85% passing 75µm and all the samples were 

screened if this sample failed the test. 

Each batch of 84 samples at SGS included four Certified Reference Materials (CRMs; commonly 

referred to as "Standards"), two (2) coarse and two (2) pulp duplicates and one (1) coarse and one

(1) pulp blank. A minimum of 5% check assays are performed on all batches, depending on the 

number of anomalies present within a given batch. 

The ALS internal QA/QC system involved insertion of two (2) CRMs, one (1) coarse and two (2) pulp 

duplicates and one (1) blank pulp into each analysis batch of 84 samples. 

BIGS' internal quality control at the sample preparation stage includes preparation repeats (duplicate 

samples), cleaning preparation equipment by crushing and pulverizing barren material. BIGS 

introduced one (1) blank, two (2) CRMs and four repeats (including two (2) preparation repeats) into 

the batches of 50 samples. 

Assay reports from the three (3) laboratories were submitted as digital data files and as signed 

certificates in PDF format. 

11.1.5 LABORATORIES CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION 

ALS is certified to ISO 9001:2015 standards and accredited to ISO 17025:2005 at all of their 

locations. Their internal QA/QC protocol includes verifications at the preparation stage, insertion of 

blank, standard and various duplicate samples, as well as periodical internal and external instrument 

calibrations. The laboratories participate in approved proficiency testing and round robin programs 

and they operate under a Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). 

SGS was accredited after Orbis had completed its drill programs. Indeed, on July 15, 2015 SGS 

announced that their analytical laboratories in Ouagadougou were officially recognized by the South 

African National Accreditation System (SANAS) for meeting the requirements of the ISO/IEC 17025 

standard for specific registered tests for the minerals industry.  

The BIGS laboratory was established in 2007 and achieved certification to ISO-17025 standards 

specific for analytical laboratories and ISO-9001 for quality management system by SANAS in 2009. 

SGS, ALS and BIGS are all commercial laboratories well established in the mining industry and are 

independent of SEMAFO. 

11.1.6 QA/QC PROTOCOL – ORBIS 

Orbis used standard, blank and duplicate samples to monitor the laboratory performance. 

Orbis used 22 different CRMs sourced from Ore Research and Exploration Pty Ltd, (OREAS) in 

Australia. The CRMs are sourced from the Magdala Lode at the Stawell Gold Mine in Victoria and 

from the Cracow Gold Mine in Queensland. The grade and matrix from the CRMs matched the style 

of mineralization at Nabanga.

002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

A standard was inserted into the primary sample stream at the end of the visually mineralized 

intersections and at the bottom of the holes. A total of 502 analyses (2.8%) of standards were 

performed out of a total of 17,968 samples submitted to the laboratories. 

Of the 502 analyses, 25 lay outside the control limits of the mean and three standard deviations from 

the expected grade (Figure 11.1). 

Figure 11.1 – Results from the Main Standard used by Orbis 

 
 

For each drill hole, Orbis inserted a blank sample at the top of the sample sequence and one in the 

mineralized intersections. No blank samples were placed into the un-mineralized portions of the 

holes. The blank material was sourced from the Bobu quarry in Burkina Faso. Although this blank is 

not certified, it provides an indication of contamination when positioned directly after a mineralized 

intercept and may also pick up sample mis-sequencing.  

In addition, DRA/Met-Chem believes a coarse blank is preferable to a pulp to monitor possible 

contamination by the crusher. Nonetheless, the use of certified blank material is recommended in a 

future program as part of the QA/QC procedures. 

On average, the background grade of the uncertified blank material is estimated at 0.01 g/t Au. Six 

(6) assays above 0.20 ppm Au may be the result of inherent variability of the blank and one (1) value 

at 1.82 ppm Au may be due to a sample mix-up. The blank samples analyzed at SGS show the 

highest variability of the three laboratories. The few samples with values exceeding the expected 

0.01 ppm tenor do not point to a significant impact on the reliability of the results that are considered 

as acceptable for a resources estimation in the inferred category.

Orbis riffle split 418 field duplicate samples to be submitted to the laboratory with the sample batches. 

The duplicate samples were prepared from the intervals with the best expected mineralization and 

were followed by a blank sample. No duplicate samples were requested in the un-mineralized 

portions of the holes. 

Snowden calculated a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98 for the duplicate sample pairs, which 

is considered as excellent for a gold deposit. Overall, the original and duplicate populations 

compared well, with some outliers at higher grades typical of gold deposits containing visible particles 

(Figure 11.2).  

Figure 11.2 – Scatterplot of Original and Field Duplicate Samples 

 

Additional tests on the reliability of the results from the duplicate samples are provided in Snowden's 

2015 Report. 

11.1.7 SAMPLES SECURITY, CHAIN OF CUSTODY 

Transportation of the samples during the drill programs was overseen by security guards and the 

samples were securely stored on site at Nabanga. SGS picked up the samples from the Project site 

twice a week unless otherwise organized. Personnel releasing the samples for shipment to the 

laboratories assumed responsibility for the sample security.

11.1.8 SPECIFIC GRAVITY 

Bulk density determinations using the Archimedes method were completed on site by Orbis from 

fresh, non-porous drill core samples. The bulk density of a total of 139 samples was determined, 

including five (5) duplicated measurements, on the following lithologies: 

▪ Granodiorite (84); 

▪ Amphibolite (30); 

▪ Quartz Vein (20). 

The initial 46 measurements were taken using the water displacement method, but they had to be 

disregarded due to inaccuracies caused by the use of inappropriate apparatus. The density on the 

subsequent samples was determined by the weight-in-air-weight-in water technique.  

In view of the low number of density determinations, Snowden used default bulk densities in the 3D 

resource model. 

11.1.9 CONCLUSIONS 

Generally, on the brief review of the Orbis data, DRA/Met-Chem believes that the independent QC 

samples and the analytical work, primarily completed by SGS, are of sufficient precision and 

accuracy for use in an estimation of resources at the Inferred level. 

11.2 Samples from SEMAFO – 2016-2018 Programs 

11.2.1 SAMPLING 

The individual diamond drilling samples represent a length of approximately one meter of core that 

was cut lengthwise using a diamond blade rock saw. One half of the core was kept on site for 

reference, and its counterpart was sent for preparation and gold assaying to ALS in Ouagadougou. 

For RC drilling, the individual samples corresponding to each 1-meter advance of drilling were 

homogenized and riffle-split to an approximately 2-kilogram subsample that was sent for preparation 

and assay to ALS in Ouagadougou, or to the Mana Mine laboratory.  

Each sample was fire-assayed for gold content on a 50-gram subsample. In addition to the 

laboratory's own QA/QC program, a QA/QC system was enforced by SEMAFO throughout the 

sampling program, using duplicate and blank samples, and recognized industry CRMs. 

11.2.2 QA/QC PROTOCOL – SEMAFO 

11.2.3 INTRODUCTION 

DRA/Met-Chem reviewed the evaluation of the results from the QC samples by SEMAFO and 

generally agrees with their conclusions. The information and conclusions in this section are extracted 

from the memo by SEMAFO, as well as the selected control charts reproduced in this section.

SEMAFO shipped 112 batches of samples to ALS in Ouagadougou in 2018. A total of 8,153 analyses 

were added to the Yactibo drill database, including re-analyses from a few holes drilled by Orbis. In 

addition, another 248 CRMs, 439 quarter core duplicates and 220 blanks samples were analyzed. 

Finally, 405 pulp duplicate samples were analyzed at SEMAFO's Mana laboratory to serve as 

external check by a secondary laboratory. 

11.2.4 CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS (CRMS; "STANDARDS") 

During the course of 2018, SEMAFO used ten (10) different CRMs with gold values ranging from 

0.609 g/t Au to 5.931 g/t Au (Table 11.1). The grades of the CRMs selected by SEMAFO, as well as 

their oxide or sulphide matrix, match the samples from the Nabanga deposit.

The CRM are used to monitor the laboratory accuracy and are adequate to detect bias or drift of the 

results when they are reviewed over a certain length of time. The CRMs were purchased from 

Rocklabs, New Zealand and were prepared from powered feldspar, basalt and fine gold. The CRMs 

denoted with an S- prefix contain pulverized pyrite (2.6% to 3.0% sulphur). 

Out of the 248 CRMs analyzed at ALS, 212 (85%) yielded results within three standard deviations 

from the mean, which is considered as acceptable (Figures 11.3 to 11.4 and Table 11.3).

The batches containing six (6) of the CRMs that failed the test were re-analyzed and the new results 

were within the three (3) standard deviations threshold. Four (4) batches were left in the database 

although they were outside of the threshold. The assays associated with the remaining 26 CRMs 

were not re-analyzed since the batches they were in did not contain any significant gold values. 

The mobile average plot of the CRM results does not indicate an analytical bias but displays a 

significant increase in failures in early June. Notably, the Z-score plot that incorporates the results 

from all the CRMs in one graph shows that CRMs SG56 and Si81 returned an anomalous number 

of failures.  

11.2.5 COARSE DUPLICATE SAMPLES 

Quarter core from 439 samples were used to serve as duplicates to monitor the precision of the 

analyses. No duplicate samples were prepared from RC cuttings as most of the 2018 holes were 

diamond drill holes. 

The mean of the duplicate analyses is 9% lower than that of the original (Table 11.2). Indeed, 68% 

of the original assays are higher than the duplicates in the individual pairs. It is noteworthy that the 

proportion of original samples that have a higher value than the duplicate samples remains 

essentially the same, regardless of the range of gold values, except for the pairs of samples for which 

the values exceed 1 g/t Au.  

The duplicate assays for the samples that yielded values higher than 1 g/t Au are higher in 54.4% of 

the cases and lower in 45.6% of the cases. In this case, 37 samples (54.4%) exceeded the values 

of the duplicate analysis and an opposite relationship is true for 31 samples (45.6%). Only 32% of 

the pairs have a difference less than 10%. Different statistical tests show a negative bias in the 

duplicate assays (Figures 11.5 to 11.7).

Considering that the duplicate samples consist of quarter core, the difficulty to replicate the original 

analyses can partly be explained by the lower representativity of the duplicate samples. Indeed, 

the effects on the analyses of the volume variance between the mass of the original half core and 

of the quarter core in gold deposits have been widely documented. 

In addition, the high variability of the gold values present in the Nabanga deposit contributes to the 

variance between the original and duplicate assays.

11.2.6 COARSE BLANK SAMPLES 

Blank samples are used to detect possible sample-to-sample contamination resulting from crushers 

or pulverizes that are not properly cleaned after each sample. Mis-sequencing of the samples by 

the geologists or at the laboratory may also be detected by the blank QC samples. 

A total of 220 blank samples were inserted into the sample stream sent to ALS. All the blank 

samples returned gold values below the fail-pass threshold set at 0.08 g/t Au. 

Barren sandstone originating from a site close to the Mana mine served as blank samples. This 

material, albeit not certified, provides the advantage of being a coarse blank that will be crushed 

by the laboratory. Although not ideal, the use of this non-certified, coarse blank is considered as 

adequate for the need of an estimation of resources in the inferred category.  

11.2.7 SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 

11.2.7.1 Primary Laboratory 

Preparation and analysis of all the samples were performed at the ALS laboratory in Ouagadougou.  

At the preparation stage, the samples were crushed to 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh) and quartered 

to obtain a 250-g split of crushed material. The 250-g riffle split was pulverized to better than 85% 

passing 75μm (200 mesh) and quartered to get a 50-g split. The remainder of the coarse rejects 

and of the pulps was saved for future reference.  

All samples were analyzed for gold by the Fire Assay method on 50-g aliquots with a lower detection 

limit of 0.01 ppm gold and an AAS finish. The samples grading over the upper detection limit of 100 

ppm gold were re-assayed using a 50-g fire assay procedure with a gravimetric finish. 

11.2.7.2 Secondary Laboratory (Check Laboratory); SEMAFO's Mana Laboratory 

A series of selected pulps that had been analyzed at the ALS facilities between April 16 and August 

11, 2018 was shipped to the SMF BF laboratory at the Mana mine at the end of every quarter. The 

samples were selected on the basis of analytical results from completed core and RC holes. The 

samples were bundled in separate batches corresponding to their position in the alteration profile 

(Oxide-Transitional-Sulphide). The 405 pulps were comprised of 19 oxide and 386 sulphide 

samples and were re-analyzed during the third quarter of 2018. 

The main purpose of these check analyses was to ensure that coherent inter-laboratories results 

were yielded.

11.2.8 SEMAFO'S MANA MINE LABORATORY 

11.2.8.1 Preparation, Analyses, QA/QC 

Although the samples were shipped to SMF BF under the form of pulps, the preparation stage is 

described for comparison with the sample preparation in commercial laboratories.  

Upon receival, the samples are registered and weighed before being dried for between 8 and 10 

hours depending on moisture. Every ±2 kg sample is crushed to 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh) and 

quartered to obtain a 250-g split of crushed material. The 250-g riffle split is pulverized to 85% 

passing 75μm (200 mesh) and quartered to obtain a 50-g sub-sample. The remainder of the coarse 

rejects and of the pulps is saved for future reference.  

All preparation equipment is flushed with barren material prior to the commencement of each run. 

The crushers and pulverizes are cleaned by compressed air between each sample. 

All samples were analyzed using 50-g Fire Assay method with an AAS finish with a lower detection 

limit of 0.01 ppm gold. The samples grading over 15 ppm gold were re-assayed using a 50-g fire 

assay procedure with a gravimetric finish. 

The SMF BF's internal QA/QC protocol involves insertion of one CRM, one field duplicate, two pulp 

duplicates and one blank pulp into each analysis batch of 20 client samples. A minimum of 5% 

additional pulp check assays are performed on all batches, depending on the number of anomalies 

present within a given batch. 

The laboratory submits the assay reports as digital data files. 

11.2.8.2 Results 

The average grade of the original oxide samples is 0.265 g/t Au and varies between 0.08 g/t and 

0.86 g/t Au, as compared to the average grade of 0.257 g/t Au for the re-assay of the pulps. On 

average, the check samples have a lower grade of 2.87%, with 56% of these check samples 

yielding a grade higher than in the original corresponding sample. 39% of the sample pairs exhibit 

a variance of 10% or less in grade. Statistical tests confirm the absence of bias, although a 

statistically valid conclusion cannot be reached on the basis of such a low population, that is, 19 

samples.  

The average grade of the original sulphide samples is 0.95 g/t Au and ranges from 0.08 g/t Au and 

37.40 g/t Au. The grade of the duplicate samples is 2.32% lower, on average, and 56% of these 

check samples yielded a grade higher than in the original sample. 57% of the sample pairs exhibit 

a variance of 10% or less in the grade. The statistical tests seem to confirm the presence of a 

significant bias toward the grade of the duplicate pulp analyses by SMF BF that are systematically 

higher than the original assays. However, the impact of this bias is probably negligible, considering

that close to 60% of the sample pairs yielded a difference that is lower than 10% and that the 

difference between the average of the original and check samples populations hardly reaches 2%. 

11.2.9 DENSITY 

SEMAFO started completing density determinations on July 5, 2018 and 2,178 samples from 21 

holes were processed over a two-month period. 

The weight-in-air-weight-in-water method was used to measure the bulk density. The core samples 

submitted to the measurements were selected based on lithology and intensity of supergene 

alteration. 

The results obtained for these bedrock samples were inconsistent and deemed unreliable to include 

in the resource estimation. The data should be re-evaluated and correction be made to ensure 

reliability before including the density measurement into the database. 

11.2.10 SEMAFO'S SECONDARY LABORATORY CERTIFICATION AND ACCREDITATION 

Several batches of pulps from samples that had been analyzed at the ALS facilities were shipped 

to SEMAFO's internal laboratory (SMF BF) at their Mana mine in Burkina Faso to serve as a check 

on the original analyses by a secondary laboratory. 

The SMF BF laboratory operates under conditions consistent with industry best practices and 

standards. The facility utilizes a QA/QC system that includes insertion of standard, blank and 

duplicate samples and participates in regular round robin programs to monitor for bias.  

Although the SMF BF laboratory is not independent of SEMAFO, the use of this facility strictly as a 

secondary laboratory is acceptable for a check on resources at the PEA level. 

11.2.11 CONCLUSIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS 

Although the standards in several batches failed the acceptability tests, they did not indicate a 

systematic bias and corrective actions were taken by SEMAFO for the batches with significant 

values.  

The blanks did not indicate any material contamination of the samples or sample mis-sequencing. 

Some bias was observed in the quarter core duplicate samples that returned an average grade 9% 

lower than the average of the original. The volume variance (half core original vs quarter core 

duplicate) and the nugget effect of the deposit are partly responsible for the variance. Noteworthy 

is the fact that the number of pairs where the duplicate samples yielded a higher value than the 

original sample is close to equal to the number with the opposite relationship.

DRA/Met-Chem Ref.: C3852-Nabanga-PEA-Final Report  
002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

The secondary laboratory returned values with an average high bias of 2.32% relative to the original 

pulps. Considering this relatively modest bias and the fact that 60% of the samples exhibit a 

variance of less than 10%, DRA/Met-Chem believes that the duplicate samples reproduce 

reasonably well the original data. 

Although the results from some QC samples did not perform in an outstanding manner, they are 

reasonably reliable for the needs of an estimation of resources exclusively in the lower level of 

confidence, the inferred category. 

DRA/Met-Chem believes the analytical data from the drilling programs of 2016-2018 are sufficiently 

reliable to be used in a preliminary study. 

However, for a future drilling program, DRA/Met-Chem recommends some actions for improvement 

in the quality and heightened confidence of the results: 

• Document, to the extent possible, the causes of the significant increase in the failures on the 

CRMs assays in June 2018 and on the corrective actions taken by ALS to remedy the 

situation; 

• Use the second half core rather than quarter core stubs as duplicate samples in order to 

obtain a more representative duplicate sample; alternatively, two quarter core samples may 

be prepared as the original and duplicate samples. A higher variability can be expected in 

the results, but the volume variance would not be involved from two (2) samples of the same 

mass; 

• Perform density measurements, using proper methodology, including use of standards, 

duplicate determinations and calibration of the scale, and ensure proper validation the results 

before entry into the database.

12 DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1 Twinning of RC Holes by Orbis 

Four (4) RC holes were twinned by Orbis using HQ diameter core holes (Table 12.1). DRA/MC 

reviewed the data and calculated the average grade of the mineralized intersections as logged by 

the geologists and recorded in the Lithology table of the drill database (Tables 12.1 to 12.4).  

The NARC033/NADD023 and NARC184/NADD002 pairs exhibited high repeatability as quartz and 

pyrite are present in both holes, and the average gold grades are equivalent.  

Quartz was found in both in NARC134/NADD013 and quartz and pyrite in the pair of NARC154 

and NADD012 holes. However, the gold grades returned by the twinned holes provide conflicting 

information when gauged against the selected cut-off grade (COG) of 3.0 g/t Au applied in the 

resource estimation (over/below COG).  

On the basis of the average grade of the mineralized intervals, the agreement between the results 

from the original and the twin holes is moderate. Part of the variability between the original and 

twinned holes can be accounted for by the large difference in volume (volume variance) between 

the samples retrieved by the RC holes (53/4 in or 133.35 mm diameter) and the core drilling (half of 

63.5 mm core) that may impact the analytical results by virtue of the volume variance. 

The comparison of the results from twinned holes should not be limited to the average grade of a 

mineralized interval to assess the repeatability. DRA/Met-Chem believes that twinned holes should 

also be compared on positioning and thickness of the mineralisation and on significant geological 

features. This is particularly true where the studied variable is characterized by high short-range 

variability, like in a gold deposit. 

The position and length of the mineralized intervals match in all holes in the respective pairs. The 

analytical results show that no downhole contamination in the RC holes occurred and they do not 

suggest a systematic bias in the average grades. 

A striking feature observed in all the original RC holes is the presence of one or two high-grade 

gold samples (7.400 to 17.500 g/t Au). Remarkably, every core hole picked up these high gold 

values intersected in the RC hole except for the NARC134/NADD013 pair, which can reasonably 

be attributed to the intrinsic nugget effect of the deposit.  

Although the number of twinned holes required for conclusive statistical analysis is not reached, 

the data provided by the four pairs of holes suggest a moderate to fair level of repeatability of the 

original holes.  

The cross sections showing the twinned holes are presented in Snowden's Technical Report 

(2015).

12.2 Orbis Database (Assay) by Snowden 

Snowden checked a random selection of 10% of all assay certificates, against the data in the 

database and found minor but no material issues.  

12.3 Site Visits 

One Snowden's QP geologist visited the site between March 13 and 17, 2015. Snowden did not 

collect independent QP check samples, but considering the QA/QC results, they did not believe 

independent sampling was required at that stage.  

12.4 Verifications by DRA/Met-Chem 

DRA/Met-Chem reviewed the measurements of the path of the drill holes and found no unusual 

deviation. 

DRA/Met-Chem reviewed the detailed analysis of the QC samples results by François Thibert, P. 

Geo.; a QP of SEMAFO and generally agrees with the conclusions.

13.1.2 CYANIDATION TEST WORK 

ALS Ammtec performed cyanidation tests. Process development undertaken during the PEA aimed 

at establishing a conventional sulphide gold/silver processing facility considering the 

constructability, operability and maintainability of the processing facility. The results indicate that 

material has refractory characteristics as a high concentration of cyanide is required to obtain good 

leach results. Tables 13.3 and 13.4 list the results for standard and intensive leach tests.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES  

14.1 Introduction 

The Mineral Resources for the Nabanga deposit were estimated by SEMAFO's resource geologist.  

The resource estimate has an effective date of December 31, 2018 and supersedes the previous 

estimates completed in 2012 and 2015 by Snowden.  

The resources estimate includes exclusively the fresh (sulphide) portion of the Nabanga deposit. 

The resources in the oxide and transitional zones were excluded from this study as SEMAFO 

considers they only represent a marginal proportion of the entire deposit. 

The results from this estimate served as the basis for this Preliminary Economic Assessment 

(PEA). The results from the PEA were presented in a press release dated September 30, 2019 and 

entitled: "SEMAFO: Positive PEA Results for Nabanga; After-tax Net Present Value of $100 

Million". 

The methodology and parameters used in the resources estimate are presented in the following 

sections. 

14.2 Drill Hole Database Construction and Validation 

SEMAFO updated the database used by Snowden for the resources estimations of 2012 and 2015 

that were based on the holes drilled until August 2, 2012. SEMAFO entered into the database the 

latest holes drilled by Orbis in 2012-2013 and the holes drilled by SEMAFO between 2016 and 

2018. The new lithological descriptions deriving from re-logging by SEMAFO of the RC chips from 

previous RC holes were incorporated into the database.  

The data required for the resources estimation was imported into dedicated software 

MICROMINE's Geobank Database that provides an environment for capturing, validating, storing 

and managing data from diverse sources. Several steps of validation of the database by the field 

and project geologists and by the GIS geologists were performed prior to extracting and importing 

the required fields from the master database into the resources database. Discrepancies in 

parameters such as collar location and elevation, permitted minimum/maximum values, overlap 

and gaps in the lithologies or sample intervals, sample numbering were checked. The Geobank 

module added a layer of validation during data transfer. 

The data used for the resource estimate includes the results from RC and core drilling by Orbis and 

SEMAFO. A total of 456, RC, 50 MP, and 37 core holes  directly associated with the North, Central 

and South Zones of the Nabanga deposit were used in the estimate (Table 14.1). The core holes 

pre-collared by RC drilling are referred to as MP (Multi-Purpose) holes.

14.3 Geological Modelling 

Building on drilling data gathered by Orbis, SEMAFO started by constructing a 3D model using the 

historical data and re-interpreted the geology and structure of the Nabanga deposit. The new 

interpretation stemming from this work differed from Orbis' and was successfully tested by drilling 

in 2018. 

Based on this information and an updated database, SEMAFO resource geologist interpreted the 

geology and mineralization in 2D, on cross-sections 40 m and 80 m apart. The outline of the 

polygons was digitized by snapping on the contacts of logged lithologies, quartz percentage, and 

gold assay data. A modelling COG of 0.2 g/t Au with a minimum width of 2 metres were used to 

delineate the  mineralized envelope.  

Two (2) domains of gold mineralization were created to separate the high-grade, central quartz-

filled portion of the shear and the lower-grade sheared and altered granodiorite halo bracketing it. 

A cut-off grade of ≥ 0.2 g/t Au to ≤ 1 g/t Au was used to constrain the low-grade domains and a cut-

off of >1 g/t Au was applied to delineate the high-grade domain, before the grade interpolation 

process.

The mineralized volumes were created by connecting the polygons from section to section to create 

a 3D geological model (wireframe). 

The grade estimation was constrained to within the two (2) mineralized envelopes (i.e. namely Low 

Grade (LG) and High Grade (HG)), in order to avoid smearing of values between the low- and high-

grade mineralization and prevent the influence from the barren host rock or isolated values of 

adjacent mineralization on the estimation process. For the purpose of the Reporting of Resource 

Estimate for the Nabanga deposit, only the blocks constrained within the High Grade envelope 

have been considered. 

The late North and South faults offsetting the deposit were also modeled. 

The Micromine software, Version 16.1 was used by SEMAFO to construct the 3D model. 

14.4 Basic Statistics Calculations 

Basic statistics were calculated on the raw data to provide easy visualization of the interpolated 

quality element (Au) (Table 14.3). 

The assays below the detection limit were reset to a value equivalent to half the detection limit.

14.5 Composite Data 

The assayed intervals of the HG wireframe represent a total length of 936.8 m. A statistical analysis 

of the sample length show that the majority (90%) of assay intervals (mode) have a length of 1.0 m 

whereas 8% have a length of less than 1.0 m and 2% have a length greater than 1.0 m.  Minimum

sample length is 0.45 m and maximum sample length is 4.0 m where only three (3) samples had a 

length over 2.0 m. 

The drill hole data were composited downholeusing the compositing module in Datamine Software. 

By setting the mode to 1, it forces all samples to be included in one of the composites by adjusting 

the composite length, while keeping it as close as possible to interval. The maximum possible 

composite length will then be 1.5*interval. .  

Prior to grade interpolation, capped assay intervals within mineralized intercepts were composited 

into 1-m intervals. The average gold grade of nearby sub-blocks was estimated from only nearby 

composites included in the same mineralized envelope. Compositing standardizes the length of 

assay intervals within the mineralized intercepts. The composite length is selected to reflect the 

average width (along the X axis) of blocks being interpolated. Thus, blocks can be interpolated from 

composites having a length that compares with the intercept length of an inclined hole within a 

block. This ensures that block grades will include some of the dilution of the drill hole intercepts 

within blocks and that the estimates above cut-off are realistic. Datamine adjusts the length of 

composites to the length of mineralized intercepts. 

Within the HG wireframe, a total of 938 composites were downloaded into the datamine software. 

The composite statistics for Au were compared to the results from the raw data (Table 14.3). 

14.6 Capping 

The study based on log probability plot and drawing curves of % cumulated metal vs. % cumulated 

sample proportion indicated a top-cut grade of 70 g/t Au. Capping the extremely high values was 

done on the raw data, prior to compositing.  

The impact of capping on the total gold content of the deposit at 70 g/t Au is not significant. This 

value caps the grade of 0.95% of the samples and reduces the total gold content by approximately 

4.2%. 

14.7 Density 

The density used for the estimation of the resource was set at 2.70 t/m³. An average density was 

used for the entire portion of the deposit, since the estimate only includes the fresh (non-weathered) 

portion of the mineralization. The assigned bulk density of 2.70 is based on the average of the 

measurements for quartz vein material by Orbis, and was used by Snowden in 2012 and 2015. The 

density determinations by SEMAFO's geologists were rejected as unreliable.  

The information on oxidation contained in the drill hole database for all the holes (n=626) was used 

to generate a surface at the interface at the top of the Transitional Zone and the Fresh Zone to cut 

the portions of the blocks extending into the weathered portion of the laterite profile.

Depth of those contacts are derived from description along drill holes. The corresponding control 

points are connected by a series of strings on individual EW sections. A 3-D surface model is 

created by triangulation for both zones. Modelled surfaces may change abruptly from one section 

to the next. Those artefacts indicate that the interpreted contact surfaces are given with a significant 

uncertainty, but generally those contacts are rather flat. The delineation of the different oxidation 

facies may have an impact on tonnage (and metal content) of the estimated resources, through 

density. It also may impact the reserves through mill recovery, maximum pit slope angles as well 

as mining and processing costs. 

14.8 Variogram Modelling  

The spatial continuity of top-cut composites within mineralized solids of the South, North and 

Central Zones was assessed with variograms or correlograms. A correlogram examines the 

decrease of the correlation (measured by a correlation coefficient from -1 to +1) of composite 

grades in any given direction as the distance between composites increases along that direction. 

Composite pairs in the appropriate direction +/- an "angular tolerance" are selected and classified 

into various distance bins based on a given lag along the direction being considered. A correlation 

coefficient is calculated for each bin from the pairs available in that bin. By graphing 1-correlogram, 

a curve is drawn showing increasing average grade differences between composites as the 

distance increases, which is like a traditional variogram. The sill of this "pseudo-variogram" is 

generally around 1.0 and it corresponds to a correlation coefficient of zero (i.e., no correlation 

between composite grades). Correlograms are generally preferred to traditional variograms since 

they are considered more robust with respect to outliers and non-stationary features such as trends 

and proportional effect (i.e., variability increasing with grade). Correlograms have been calculated 

but they are presented herein as variograms by graphing the function: 1-correlogram. 

All variogram analysis and modelling were performed using the Geostat+, Version 2.0 module   

3D variograms of 1-m composite data for the South, North and Central Zones have been computed 

separately along horizontal strike direction of N070, N060 and N050 respectively and dip directions 

(dipping 65° to the north-north-east). Also, variograms along the drill hole direction (short distance 

variogram) were computed separately from those computed along the average strike and dip 

directions (long distance variogram) to facilitate the interpretation. In all three (3) zones (see 

Figures 14.1 to 14.3), short distance variograms are characterized by a relative nugget effect of 

30% with a short range of 3 m.  For the South and North Zones, variograms along strike and dip 

display a 40-50 m range. The proposed model is made of one exponential component that is 

isotropic with a range of 30 m.  For the Central Zone, the variogram along dip (-60 to N330) 

displays a 60 m range whereas the variogram along strike (horizontal N060) displays a 40 m range. 

The model is made of one anisotropic exponential component with ranges of 36 m and 30 m.

Based on the variogram study, the search ellipsoid parameters determined for grade interpolation 

are as follows: 

• 50 to 125 m  along the major axis; 

• 50 to 125 m along the semi-major axis; 

• 10 to 25 m along the minor axis. 

Due to the relatively simple geometry of the Nabanga deposit, no subdivision into different structural 

domains was necessary to allow the search ellipse to properly code all the blocks during grade 

interpolation, but three (3) sectors were separated by two (2) faults, with horizontal directions of the 

mineralization North 70°, North 60°, and North 50°.

14.9 Resource Block Modelling 

A block model was created using Datamine® software package. A unique block model was created 

for the South, Central and North Zones with parent block size of 5 m by 5 m by 5 m. Splitting of the 

parent block into sub-cells was done by using the parameter MAXDIP in Datamine. The degree of 

splitting is made dependant on the dip of the wireframe. By setting MAXDIP to 0 and SPLITS to 3 

allow all parent cells that are intersected by the wireframe to be divided into 8 sub-cells in Y and Z, 

with minimum sub-block size of 0.005 m along X, 0.625 m along Y and 0.008 m along Z. Parent 

cells were estimated using a discretization of 3 m by 3 m by 3 m in the X, Y, and Z dimensions, 

respectively. 

The block model was rotated by 55 to the East, which coincide with the general orientation of the 

mineralized structure. The coordinates of the origin correspond to the rotated model. Parameters 

are presented in Table 14.4. The block model extent is illustrated in Figure 14.4.

14.10 Grade Interpolation Methodology 

Average block or sub-block grades were interpolated from nearby composites within the HG 

mineralized solid. Block grade interpolation was estimated by Ordinary Kriging (OK). The different 

variogram models used for kriging have been presented in a previous section. 

Each block and sub-block are first coded according to its position relative to the oxidation surfaces.  

Bulk density is assigned according to the ore type of the block or the sub-block. 

Three (3) successive interpolation passes were used in the estimation.  

In the first pass, the search ellipsoid size was set at 50 m x 50 m x 10 m in the long, intermediate 

and short axes. The minimum and maximum of composites to interpolate a block were set at 7 and 

25 and the maximum of composite per hole was restricted to 3. These constraints ensure that at 

least 3 holes are required to allow a block to be interpolated during this pass. 

In the second pass, the search ellipsoid size was set at 100 m x 100 m x 20 m in the long, 

intermediate and short axes. The minimum and maximum of composites were set at 7 and 25 and 

the maximum of composite per hole was restricted to 3. Under these constraints, 3 holes are 

required to allow a block to be interpolated during this pass. 

In the third pass, the search ellipsoid size was relaxed to 125 m x 125 m x 25m in the long, 

intermediate and short axes, to ensure that all the blocks situated within the envelope that were not 

coded in the previous passes will be blocks will be captured and coded. The minimum and 

maximum of composites were set at 4 and 25 and the maximum of composite per hole was 

restricted to 3. Under these constraints, two (2)  holes are required to allow a block to be 

interpolated during this pass. 

A summary of the block model set-up and parameters is presented in Table 14.5.

14.11 Resource Validation  

The first step in the Mineral Resources validation consisted in a visual validation: the estimated 

blocks have been compared to the composite and raw assays grades, on sections, plans and in 

3D view. The correlation is considered to be very good. 

The second step involved generating basic statistics of blocks and comparing them to the 

composite and assays used as input. The results from the descriptive statistics are presented in 

Table 14.6. 

The comparisons show a good correspondence between the interpolated blocks (output of the 

resource model) and the composites (in/out of the model). As it could be expected, the ordinary 

krigging has a smoothing effect on the grade and limit the range of extreme values.

14.12 Resources Definitions and Classification 

14.12.1 CIM GUIDELINES & DEFINITION 

The guidelines from the latest (May 10, 2014) version of the Canadian Institute of Mining, 

Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards – For Mineral Resources and Mineral 

Reserves were followed in the resource classification: Selected items from the definitions are 

reproduced below as the full and official text is freely available on the CIM Website. 

In addition to conformity with the guidelines adopted by CIM, the criteria used by SEMAFO's 

resource geologist for classifying the resources are based on the quality of the dataset and the 

certainty of continuity of geology and grade. 

Definitions are from the Canadian institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM): 

Mineral Resource 

Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, 

Indicated and Measured categories. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence 

than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource. An Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher 

level of confidence than an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of confidence than a 

Measured Mineral Resource. 

A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, 

or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial 

minerals in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it 

has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological 

characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from 

specific geological evidence and knowledge. 

The term Mineral Resource covers mineralization and natural material of intrinsic economic interest 

which has been identified and estimated through exploration and sampling and within which Mineral 

Reserves may subsequently been defined by the consideration and application of technical, 

economic, legal, environmental, socio-economic and governmental factors. The phrase 

'reasonable prospects for economic extraction' implies a judgment by the Qualified Person in 

respect of the technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospect of economic 

extraction. A Mineral Resource is an inventory of mineralization that under realistically assumed 

and justifiable technical and economic conditions might become economically extractable. These 

assumptions must be presented explicitly in both public and technical reports. 

Inferred Mineral Resource 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or 

quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably 

assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited 



SEMAFO 
NI 43-101 Technical Report

November 2019 
DRA/Met-Chem Ref.: C3852-Nabanga-PEA-Final Report  
002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 

outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed 

that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured 

Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to 

allow the meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation 

of economic viability worthy of public disclosure. Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from 

estimates forming the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. 

Indicated Mineral Resource 

An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence 

sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support 

mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on 

detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques 

from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely 

enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

Mineralisation may be classified as an Indicated Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when 

the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data are such as to allow confident interpretation of 

the geological framework and to reasonably assume the continuity of mineralization. The Qualified 

Person must recognize the importance of the Indicated Mineral Resource category to the 

advancement of the feasibility of the project. An Indicated Mineral Resource estimate is of sufficient 

quality to support a Preliminary Feasibility Study which can serve as the basis for major 

development decisions. 

Measured Mineral Resource 

A 'Measured Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 

estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic 

parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. 

The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information 

gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings 

and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity. 

Mineralisation or other natural material of economic interest may be classified as a Measured 

Mineral Resource by the Qualified Person when the nature, quality, quantity and distribution of data 

are such that the tonnage and grade of the mineralization can be estimated to within close limits 

and that variation from the estimate would not significantly affect potential economic viability. This 

category requires a high level of confidence in, and understanding of, the geology and controls of 

the mineral deposit.

14.12.2 NABANGA CLASSIFICATION 

The mineral resource classification is based on certainty of geology and grades, which is, in most 

cases, related to the drilling density. Although the mineralized shear exhibits strong geological 

continuity and although a portion of the Nabanga deposit has been more densely drilled, all the 

resources were graded as Inferred Resources.  

SEMAFO elected to constrain the resources using a Cut-Off Grade (COG) calculated on the basis 

of an potential underground exploitation in order to only state the resources that have good 

prospects for eventual economic extraction, in compliance with the CIM requirements. 

14.13 Mineral Resource Statement  

The Mineral Resources are stated using an average density and are constrained in a preliminary 

optimized pit. The resources are estimated exclusively for the mineralization within the fresh 

(sulphide) portion of the Nabanga deposit. Table 14.7 presents the results from the resource 

estimate.

The Reader is cautioned that mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have

16 MINING METHOD 

The PEA was based on Mineral Resources Estimate published by SEMAFO with an effective date 

of December 31, 2018. DRA/Met-Chem has verified that the results of the PEA continue to be 

relevant and are valid for the updated Mineral Resource Estimate. 

The Nabanga deposit will be mined by the use of the Open Pit and Underground mining methods, 

as described in this section. 

16.1 Geotechnical Assessment 

Peel Sullivan Meynink had been contracted by Orbis to provide preliminary geotechnical advice on 

the Nabanga Project (PSM 2014). No further work has been accomplished as part of the Nabanga 

PEA Project since then. 

Peel Sullivan Meynink stated that rock mass where the open pit and the underground excavation 

could be located at Nabanga has a very good rock mass quality (RQD between 90 and 100). A 

high strength (UCS>80 MPa) rock is the dominant rock class. 

The overall slope angles for the open pit was determined using an empirical method based on the 

rock mass ratings for different rock unit classes versus slope height. This method was considered 

adequate given the preliminary nature of the study (PEA Level), and given the relatively shallow 

depth of the proposed open pit excavation. However, for a subsequent evaluation stage (at PFS of 

DFS level), further investigation will be required to increase the amount of confidence. 

The preliminary geotechnical pit slope design parameters are the following: 

• An overall slope angle of 55° to 60° for the pit walls developed in a very good rock mass 

quality; 

• An overall slope angle of 40° to 42° for the upper part of the pit wall in the poor-quality rock 

(overburden). 

All the stopes are likely to be excavated in very good rock mass quality. With this condition, the 

preliminary geotechnical stope design parameters are: 

• The stope width varied with the width of the mineralized material in the range of 1 to 7 m;   

• The recommended maximum stope length is 30 m; 

• Minimum crown pillar thickness is equal to the typical stope width. 

Since the access, ramp and material sills are in a very good rock mass quality, the preliminary 

geotechnical ground support parameters are for an opening of 5.0 x 5.0 m:  

• 2.5 m resin rebar or swellex on a pattern of 2.0 x 2.0 m for the roof (minimum); 

• 1.8 m split set on a pattern 2.0 x 2.0 m for the wall (added for the study);

002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

• Galvanized screen (5.6 mm, 100 mm aperture) (added for the study). 

The wall support and screen were not mentioned in the study or not recommended for excavation 

support; however, they have been added for safety reasons on miscellaneous possibility of small 

rock-falls condition.  

For the vertical development, unsupported shafts up to 4 to 5 m diameter are expected to have few 

stability issues in very good rock mass. If the rock mass quality decreases, additional ground 

support will be required. All the vertical development connecting to surface will be designed to avoid 

any fault or instability zones. 

Two (2) major faults intersect the mineralization zone. These structures have been described as 

highly to moderately weathered, with a RQD below 10. There is no evidence of gouge or clay. The 

orientation of both fault with the mineralization should not be problematic with respect to the open 

pit walls stability or underground stope stability. 

16.2 Hydrology and Hydrogeology 

No field work has been done so far on the Project concerning the hydrogeology, or the surface 

hydrology.  

A river is located at the north-east of the mineralized zone, approximately 300 m away. During the 

rainy season, this river may not be enough to drain all the water, and a large flooded zone (swamp 

area) could be created along the river.  

16.3 Transition Between Open Pit and Underground Mining 

In order to determine the transition level between the Open Pit operation and the Underground 

operation, a calculation of the value of the mineralized material for each slice of 20 m from surface 

to the bottom of the mineralization has been estimated for both the Open Pit and Underground 

mining methods. The mining costs used are the ones described in the cut-off grade calculation in 

Sections 16.4 and 16.5. This method results in the optimum value of the mineralized material zone 

without taking in consideration timing and mine scheduling. 

The optimal open pit limits were established with the NPV Scheduler (from Datamine software 

package) which uses the Lerch-Grossman algorithm for pit optimization. The pits limits were 

optimized using the parameter described in Section 16.4. 

The Stope Optimizer tool from Deswik was used to define the potential stoping area. The 

parameters used for the Stope Optimizer are described in Section 16.5. 

A pit value was evaluated for every 20 m step as it was mined by its own until the ultimate pit.

It is to be noted that a significant portion of Optimized Stopes has been generated below the 40 m 

elevation, whereas no Pit Shell has been generated below that horizon. 

Above elevation 140 m, the value of the 20 m slice is higher with the open pit mining and below, 

the value is better with the underground. The transition of mining method between surface and 

underground will be at elevation 140 m.  

16.4 Open Pit Mining 

16.4.1 PIT OPTIMIZATION 

Open-pit optimization was conducted on the deposit to determine the economic pit limits. The 

optimization was carried out during the initial stage of the Project using initial cost, sales price, and 

pit and plant operating parameters.  

The optimizer operates on a net value calculation for all the blocks in the model (i.e., revenue from 

sales of gold less operating cost).  

Since this study is at a PEA level, inferred material has been considered in the optimization and 

mine plan. 

Table 16.2 presents the pit optimization parameters.

16.4.2 CUT-OFF GRADE (COG)  

Using the economic parameters presented above, a COG of 2g/t of gold was calculated for the 

Open Pit Project. The COG is used to determine whether the material being mined will generate a 

profit after paying for the processing, transportation and administrative costs. Material that is mined 

below the cut-off grade is sent to the waste dump. The COG has been calculated according to the 

following formula: 

𝐶𝑂𝐺 =
(𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 + 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑐𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 + 𝐺&𝐴) ∗ 𝐷𝑖𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛

(𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 − 𝑅𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦) ∗ 𝑀𝑖𝑙𝑙 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑦)
 

16.4.3 PIT DESIGN AND SEQUENCING 

A conventional truck/shovel operation will be used for all open pits. Drill and blast will be required 

almost at the beginning of the excavation work because there is almost no overburden (saprolite). 

Given the expected short life of the Open Pit operation, it is anticipated that a contractor will be 

selected and be responsible for all aspect of surface mining (operation, maintenance, office, garage 

erection and management). 

The ramps and haul roads were designed with an overall width of 15.5 m. For double lane traffic 

(Figure 16.1), industry practice indicates the running surface width to be a minimum of 2.5 times 

the width of the largest truck. The overall width of a 50-tonne haul truck is 3.9 m which results in a 

running surface of 9.75 m. The allowance for berms and ditches increases the overall haul road 

width to 15.5 m. A maximum ramp grade of ten (10) % was used. This grade is acceptable for a 

50-tonne haul truck.

The open pit mining will be completed during Year 2 of the operation, and the total duration of the 

open pit operation is expected to be approximately 31 months. Figure 16.4 shows the tonnage 

mined per year and grade of mineralized material mined. 

Figure 16.4 – Open Pit Sequence 

 

16.5 Underground Mining 

16.5.1 MINING METHOD AND CUT-OFF GRADE (COG) 

The mineralized zone is a sub vertical vein type of mineralization (65-70°) from surface to 

approximately 120 m deep, and then flattens a little bit to about 50° going down. The width of 

mineralization can vary between 1 and 7 m. As described in Section 16.1, the host rock and 

mineralized rock have good strong properties. 

Long hole stoping method is suggested to be used for this mineralized zone. Due to the shallow 

vein, 40 m will be used between levels. An extra 0.5 m will be added on the walls to take in long 

hole dilution into consideration. 

The following parameters presented in Table 16.4 have been considered by DRA/Met-Chem to 

estimate the cut-off grade for the UG operations.

Using the economic parameters presented above, a cut-off grade of 3.7 g/t of gold was calculated 

for the UG operation. This cut-off grade was then used in the Stope Optimizer software (Deswik 

SO), and mineable economical shapes have been generated. A minimum mining with of 1.5 m was 

used. Figure 16.5 shows a longitudinal view of the possible stoping below the pit outline. 

Knowing that the ground has strong properties, a double decking is considered to minimize the 

amount of development required. Figure 16.6 shows the longitudinal retreat approach with up and 

down holes. Once the block is mined out, a wedge of cemented rock fill (4% cement) will be dumped 

in the stope to create an artificial pillar between the stopes, and the rest of the stope will be filled 

with waste rock.

16.5.2 MINE DESIGN 

The mining area is spread over 2 km, several ramps (3 portals) will be used to ease material access 

and increase mining flexibility. The accesses will be designed for each stope grouping. This will 

give the flexibility to mine material zone independently and to give several faces of attack in the 

mining sequence. Moreover, it will ease the ventilation network / alternative egress and shorten the 

hauling distance for truck. 

Figure 16.7 shows an isometric view of the Nabanga underground mine and Figure 16.8 shows a 

longitudinal view.  

All ramps and accesses will be developed with a dimension of 5 m by 5.5 m. This size will allow 

the use of large equipment for hauling to surface such as 40-t truck. The level (material zone and 

ventilation access) will have a size of 5 m Height by 4.8 m Width. Large equipment is also planned 

to be used for mucking the production stopes (14 t LHD). 

There will be four (4) ventilation raises (alternative egress) for the whole underground mine, mainly 

one for each stope grouping (ramp). The size will be 4 m x 3 m. 

When the stoping area cannot justify lowering the ramp to recover them, a bench will be taken to 

recover a part or the whole identified block.  This will reduce the overall mining cost while increasing 

mineralized material recovery. 

The dilution of 0.5 m on each wall was taken in consideration in the MSO calculation. This dilution 

gives an average external dilution of 30% dilution and an internal dilution of 15%. It was assumed 

the same dilution in the mineralized material development on average. 

The mining recovery of the production stopes is 95%. The scatter stopes, which are far from the 

main access or lonely stopes at depth that could not justify a ramp or access, are left behind. 

16.5.3 MINE SERVICES 

16.5.3.1 Ventilation – Alternative Egress 

The fresh air requirement will be established using the Canadian homologation ventilation standard 

(CANMET). At this point, no calculation was done on the quantity; however, the ventilation network 

for the underground mining operation was taken in consideration in the mine design. No mine 

ventilation simulation was done. 

Figure 16.9 shows the suggested ventilation network. Each material zone or area will be ventilated 

independently, which will ease the distribution. Doors/walls will be installed at the level raise access 

to control the required flow on the level. The alternative egress will be parallel to the raises.

Main fans will be installed on surface (extractor) and booster fans will be used to bring the air to 

the working face. The intake air will come from the main ramps and the exhaust will be in the raise 

system. 

16.5.3.2 Water Supply 

The water required for the drilling operation will be taken of the river at the north east of the pit to 

start of the project. This water will be pumped into pond on surface when required. The water will 

be pumped to a tank above the portal to supply the underground mine with the gravity. The pond 

will be also used to collect water from the underground mine dewatering network. 

16.5.3.3 Dewatering 

Sumps will be excavated at each level entrance to collect the water from the level and the ramp 

above. There will be drain hole to connect each sump from level to level as there will be excavated. 

The water will be pumped out of the mine to a settling pond on surface. This water will be 

recirculated as water supply. At this point, there is not dimensioning of the pumping facilities as no 

hydrogeology study has been done, but a provision has been taken in the cost evaluation for 

dewatering. It has been assumed that the mining contractor will provide all the pumping equipment. 

16.5.3.4 Electrical Distribution 

Diesel generators will generate the electrical power for the Nabanga Project. A cable will bring the 

electrical power in the pit down to a substation and after, inside the ramp. There will be electrical 

substations at each level.  

16.5.3.5 Compressed Air 

A compressor will be installed at the pit bottom, close to the portal. One (1) 160 kW electrical 

compressor will service the mining area. The compressed air network in the mine will be used 

mainly for drilling and explosive loading. 

16.5.3.6 Mine Communication 

A leaky feeder system will be installed underground. This will allow an effective communication 

between all underground personal and surface installation. 

16.5.3.7 Mine Facilities 

The main facilities for the underground operation will include office, warehouse and maintenance 

facilities such as wash bay, garage. There will be a fuel station and an area to store used oil which 

will be collected and disposed by the fuel company. A cement batch plant will be installed by the 

contractor for cement needs such as backfill, concrete floor or shotcrete. 

No surface layout for the facilities disposition was done at this stage.

16.5.4 OPERATION 

All of the underground mining will be contracted as a turnkey project. The contractor will oversee all 

mining aspects including mobile, fixed equipment and the maintenance, mine services and facilities. 

The contractor will put in place safety practices and working procedures jointly with SEMAFO. 

Development drilling will be done by jumbo drill. These units will also be used to drill holes for the 

appropriate ground support. Long hole drilling will be done with an electro-hydraulic rig for large scale 

production drilling. An ITH will drill a slot raise with the V30 and ventilation raise. 

There is no plan in the design to have powder magazine underground. The powder magazine will be 

located on surface. 

It is expected to use 14 t LHD to clean the development face as well as the production stopes. 

The mineralized material haulage will be done by low profile underground truck. The truck capacity 

will be 40-t nominal. The material will be hauled from underground to the Run off Mine Pad on 

surface. While on surface, this truck will also be used to transport waste materiel at the bottom of the 

pit for backfill purposes. The waste development rock will be hauled out of the underground mine 

and temporarily stored at the bottom of the pit. 

Waste rock will be used for backfill. The rock will be carried down the stope as there is no plan to 

have a backfill raise. A batch plant will be supplied by the contactor for cement. This will be required 

for the cemented rock fill wedge that is needed to increase stability and avoid leaving material pillar 

between the stope. 

16.5.5 MINE PRODUCTION PLAN 

The underground mine has been designed for a 1,000 t/d production. The mineralized material will 

come from the development and from the long hole stope. At the beginning of the mine, a large 

proportion of mineralized material production will come from development. This proportion will 

decrease as more level will be developed and give the sequence flexibility required in a longitudinal 

retreat mining method. 

Pits 4 and 7 will be mined first and the underground excavation will start roughly 6 months after to 

give enough time to liberate the face for the portal. The mining will start from the bottom of the mine 

and progress towards the top, ending with the surface pillar recovery. 

Figures 16.10 and 16.11 show the production plan and development plan of the Nabanga 

underground mine.

Figure 16.10 – Underground Production Plan 

 

Due to the nature of the mining method, most of the development necessary to access the different 

stoping areas will be done in the early years of the underground operation. From Years 2 to 4, an 

average of 2,680 m of development will be accomplished, then approximately 1,350 m in Year 5 and 

260 m in Year 6, whereas the underground operation will last an additional 3 years (until Year 9). 

Figure 16.11 – Underground Development Plan 

 

Table 16.5 shows the statistics of the life of mine plan. It includes the open pit production at the 

beginning and the underground operation following, as well as the details of the material planned to 

be processed at the plant. 

Figure 16.12 to Figure 16.19 illustrate the progression of the development and the mining of the 

underground operation from Years 2 to 9.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

17.1 Nabanga Processing Plant 

At the Nabanga processing plant, gold will be recovered using conventional sulphide flotation to 

produce a sulphide concentrate for intensive leaching, followed by conventional CIL cyanidation of 

the flotation tailings for additional gold recovery.  

The processing facility or concentrator consists of: 

• One stage crushing; 

• SAG mill and ball mill grinding and classification; 

• Conventional sulphide froth flotation; 

• Intensive cyanidation of the flotation concentrate; 

• CIL leaching;  

• Pressure Zadra elution;  

• Electro-winning and refining for gold doré recovery; 

• Reagent and utilities. 

The concentrator is designed to produce gold doré bars containing gold and silver from mineralized 

material containing a Life-of-Mine (LOM) average grade of 6.5 g/t gold and 3.0 g/t silver. 

17.2 Design Criteria 

Process development undertaken during the PEA aimed at establishing a conventional sulphide 

gold/silver processing facility considering the constructability, operability and maintainability of the 

processing facility. 

The plant design is based on processing 360,000 dry tonnes per year of  mineralized material, with 

a gold recovery of 92% This estimate is based upon bench scale metallurgical testing as described 

in Section 13. There is some variability in the mineralized materials tested and therefore; the results 

obtained which vary depending on mineralized material composition. 

The concentrator is designed to operate 365 days per year with an average utilisation of 91.3% 

following the crushing circuit.  

The concentrator throughput capacity is based upon an average throughput rate of 1,080 dry tonnes 

per day or nominal 49.3 dry tonnes of material per hour.  

Table 17.1 lists the main process design criteria. The complete process design criteria are detailed 

in Appendix A.

• Grinding media and reagents; 

• Utilities and services. 

The crushing facility will operate independently from the remaining concentrator sections. 

The simplified flow sheet presented is simplistic, but representative of the process. 

17.5 Crushing 

The crusher is expected to receive mineralized material, containing 6.5 g/t gold and 3.0 g/t silver with 

a moisture content of 5%. ROM material is introduced into the primary crusher feed bin after passing 

through a static grizzly. Ore enters the jaw crusher via a vibrating feeder at the base of the hopper. 

Jaw crusher product is transported using a conveyor for to the mill feed stockpile.  

The jaw crusher discharges material with a particle size distribution of 80% passing (P₈₀) of 93 mm. 

The parameters are summarised in Table 17.3.

17.6 Grinding 

One-stage crushing followed by SAG mill and ball milling was selected over conventional three-stage 

crushing and rod mill and ball mill grinding, which is usually more expensive and cumbersome. The 

low material competency of the material tested was conducive to SAG milling due to the low energy 

requirement necessary for material breakage. 

Crushed material is drawn from the mill feed stockpile utilizing apron feeders located in the tunnel 

underneath the stockpile. Apron feeders discharge the material onto the SAG mill feed conveyor. 

The SAG mill operates in closed circuit with a SAG mill discharge screen. The ball mill operates in 

closed circuit classification with a hydro-cyclone cluster. Both SAG and ball mill are equipped with a 

trommel screens. The trommel screen protects the mill discharge pumps from steel chunks and large 

pebbles.  

The SAG screen undersize and the ball mill discharge flow into the secondary cyclone feed pump 

box. The material is pumped to the cyclone cluster for classification. Cyclone underflow or coarse 

material reports back to ball mill whilst the cyclone overflow or fine material flows by gravity to flotation 

circuit feed. 

Grinding circuit pulp densities, mill speed and ball mill load are controlled automatically to ensure 

that the grinding circuit produces a consistent product grind size P₈₀ of 53 microns.  

The parameters are summarized in Table 17.4.

17.7 Sulphide Flotation 

The flotation circuit consists of rougher flotation, concentrate regrind and classification followed by 

cleaning flotation stages.

DRA/Met-Chem Ref.: C3852-Nabanga-PEA-Final Report  
002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

The rougher flotation section consists of 8 tank cells that float the sulphide particles containing gold 

to a rougher concentrate. The rougher flotation cells provide 30 minutes of retention time. Rougher 

flotation tailings are pumped to the CIL leach circuit. 

Rougher sulphide concentrate is recovered using copper sulfate as an activator, potassium amyl 

xanthate (PAX) as a collector and MIBC as a frother. 

Rougher concentrate is pumped to a vertical regrind mill operating in closed circuit with a cluster of 

cyclones. The target cyclone overflow product size is a P₈₀ of 20 microns.  

There are three (3) sequential cleaning flotation stages. First cleaner concentrate is pumped to the 

feed of the second cleaners with second cleaner tailings returned to the feed of the first cleaner bank. 

Second cleaner concentrate reports to the feed of the third cleaner bank. The third cleaner 

concentrate is final concentrate with third cleaner tailings reporting back to the feed of the second 

cleaner bank. Total cleaner bank flotation retention time is 30 minutes. Final concentrate is pumped 

to the concentrate thickener for dewatering. First cleaner tailings are combined with the rougher 

flotation tailings stream and pumped to the carbon-in-leach circuit and for additional gold recovery. 

See a summary of flotation parameters in Table 17.5.

The regrind mill size was based on experience with sulphide concentrate regrinding. Additional tests 

on rougher concentrate material targeting the specific regrind mill energy consumption will be 

required during the prefeasibility phase to confirm the size of the regrind mill. 

17.8 Intensive Cyanidation and Carbon-in-Leach (CIL) Cyanidation 

Sulphide concentrate is thickened to 63% solids in the concentrate thickener. Excess solution is 

returned to the process water tank. 

The thickener underflow is pumped to the intensive cyanide leach reactor feed bin. 

The intensive cyanide leach reactor operates as a batch process and uses high cyanide 

concentration solutions and mixing to dissolve the free gold particles recovered from the flotation 

circuit. The leached gold in solution recovered from the leach reactor is pumped to the electro-

winning cells for gold recovery. The intensive leach tailings are rinsed and pumped to final tailings.

002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

The flotation tailings are pumped to the cyanidation leach circuit. The circuit feed is screened to 

remove trash material. Screen undersize flows by gravity to the pre-leach thickener with the pulp 

thickened to adjust the percent solids in preparation for cyanidation. 

Pre-leach thickener underflow is pumped to the pre-oxidation leach tank. The pre oxidation discharge 

then flows by gravity to the first of 6 × CIL tanks for the dissolution of gold and silver. The cyanidation 

leach process is accomplished using oxygen and cyanide in an alkaline leach environment. Pre-

oxidation is a common first step to elevate the pulp dissolved oxygen levels in the slurry prior to 

cyanidation which improves the rate of gold dissolution and reduces the consumption of cyanide and 

lime. 

Activated carbon is added to the last leach tank and pumped being pumped forward from the last 

tank to first tank in counter current sequence such that all of leach tanks contain carbon. This is the 

Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) scenario. The activated carbon adsorbs precious gold and silver from the 

slurry. Inter-stage pumping screens pump the slurry forward to the next tank. The screens prevent 

carbon moving along with the slurry back to the next tank. Fresh carbon containing no gold or barren 

eluted carbon containing low gold grades are added to the last tank in series. The loaded carbon in 

the first tank contains the highest loaded carbon gold grades and is pumped batch wise to the loaded 

carbon screen. 

Carbon-In-Leach (CIL) was selected as the recovery option over leaching followed by Carbon-In-

Pulp (CIP) recovery. The leach and adsorption test results were not available when the circuit 

selection and engineering development took place. The CIL option prevents preg-robbing of gold 

from solution if the material contains naturally occurring active organic carbon or sulphide that will 

consume cyanide. In the CIL option activated carbon is added during the leaching stages which helps 

to minimise this preg-robbing phenomenon. 

Flocculent is added to improve thickener settling rates. Final sulphide concentrate grades will be in 

the order of 87 g/t gold. Approximately 80% of the gold recovered from mill feed is from the flotation 

section. 

The main leach parameters are summarised below in Table 17.6.

17.9 Elution and Carbon Regeneration and Electro-winning and Refining 

Loaded carbon is cleaned of the pulp particles by wet screening on a vibrating screen and then flows 

by gravity to the elution area for gold desorption and recovery. Carbon is first acid washed using 

dilute hydrochloric acid to remove inorganic salts, water rinsed and then eluted or stripped of the 

contained gold in an elution column using a caustic cyanide solution at elevated temperature and 

pressure. The gold cyanide solution recovered is referred to as pregnant solution and reports to the 

gold room area for electro-winning.  

At the completion of the elution cycle the stripped or barren carbon is then water rinsed and then fed 

to a rotary kiln for carbon regeneration or reactivation by heating to 700ºC in a moist environment. 

This regeneration step ensures that the carbon remains active with respect to gold recovery by 

removing organic material from the carbon particles prior to being reintroduced to the last CIL tank. 

The intensive leach reactor leach solution is pumped directly into the pregnant solution tank. 

Pregnant solution reports to the electro-winning cells located in the refinery. Gold and silver from 

solution are deposited onto the electro-winning cell stainless steel cathodes. The deposited product 

is removed from the cathodes using a high pressure washer and then dried, mixed with fluxes 

(sodium nitrate, fluorspar, borax, silica sand and soda ash) and smelted in an electric induction 

furnace.  

Flux is required to remove impurities in the gold sludge from the molten metal and is removed as 

slag. The doré (gold and silver) bars are poured into 1000 troy ounce moulds for shipment to the 

external gold refinery.  

17.10 Grinding Media, Concentrator Reagents and Refinery Chemicals 

The grinding balls will be stored in the drums that they arrived in. Fresh water will be used for reagent 

mixing. Reagent preparation is conducted in a separate area as there is a relatively high consumption 

of sodium cyanide. MIBC is supplied in liquid form and is ready for immediate use. 

17.10.1 GRINDING MEDIA 

• The SAG mill uses 125 mm forged steel grinding balls; 

• The ball mill uses 75 mm forged steel grinding balls; 

• The re-grind mill will use 25 mm steel grinding balls. 

17.10.2 FLOTATION REAGENTS 

• Copper sulfate (CuSO₄) is a sulphide activator to enhance the sulphide recovery in the rougher 

flotation circuit; 

• Potassium amyl xanthate (PAX) is used as a collector to recover sulphides. The sulphide 

minerals bond the collector;

• Methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC) is used a froth stabilizer. 

17.10.3 LEACH CHEMICALS 

• Lime (CaO) is used as pH modifier in the cyanide leach circuits. It is sometimes in the thickener 

to support settling; 

• Sodium Cyanide (NaCN) issued for the dissolution of gold and silver from the pulp to form 

soluble cyanide complexes and in the stripping circuit; 

• Activated Carbon (C) is used to adsorb dissolved gold and silver and transport them selectively 

to the stripping area for purification; 

• Lead nitrate (PbNO₃) is used to enhance gold dissolution in cyanide circuits. 

17.10.4 CARBON SYSTEM CHEMICALS 

• Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) is used to remove inorganic compounds from the activated carbon 

prior to stripping; 

• Caustic Soda (NaOH) is used during stripping to create a high pH environment and enhance 

the solution conductivity. 

17.10.5 REFINERY FLUXES 

• Sodium nitrate (NaNO₃) is a strong oxidiser used to remove sulfur compounds from the melt; 

• Fluorspar (CaF₂) is used remove aluminium impurities and increases the fluidity of the melt; 

• Borax (Na₂[B₄O₅(OH)₄]٠8H₂O) is used to dissolve (base) metals in the melt; 

• Silica (SiO₂) is used to adsorb dissolved (base) metals and form silicates thus transporting the 

unwanted impurities to the slag; 

• Soda Ash (NaCO₃) is used to decrease slag viscosity. 

17.10.6 OTHER CHEMICALS 

Flocculant is used to aid with the settling of fine particles in the thickener. This will be in the form of 

a non-toxic, polyacrylamide polymer. 

Antiscalant is used to prevent the pipes plugging up with scale. 

Table 17.7 lists the estimated main consumables consumption rates.

18.2.2 POWER PLANT AND DISTRIBUTION – RETICULATION NETWORK 

The site will be supplied at 6.6 kV, 3 phase, 50 Hz from a Power Plant installed adjacent to the 

concentrator. The power plant consists in 5 generators using LFO fuel, with operating mode N+1 

(four in operation, one in stand-by, maintenance or reparation). Each engine provides 1,600 kWe @ 

0.8 PF, 2000 kVA, 6.6 kV, 50 Hz, 1500 RPM. The choice of the LFO fuel is justified by the Mine life 

versus the capital investment for HFO fuel. Each DG unit shall be installed in a container. The net 

output installed power for 5 engines is 8,000 kWe and the net output operation power for 4 engines 

is 6,400 kWe (power at the busbars of the of the MV Switchgear, 6.6 kV, 3 phases, 50 Hz, part od 

Power Plant package). 

The main components of the Power Plant are: 

• 5 Main DG units; 

• Control Unit; 

• Batteries c/w Battery Charger; 

• Control and Synchronisation Panel for 5 units; and

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

SEMAFO is an existing producer and seller of gold. Historical data for gold prices therefore exists 

and as such no formal market studies for this Technical Report have been undertaken. 

A long-term gold price projection of $1,300 per ounce for this Technical Report is considered 

reasonable on the basis of actual gold prices which reflect SEMAFO conservative outlook of the 

future market for gold. 

19.1 Contracts 

There are no material contracts or agreements in place as of the effective date of this Technical 

Report. SEMAFO has not hedged, nor committed any of its production pursuant to an off-take 

agreement.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

The Nabanga Project is administratively part of the Soudougui Department in the province of 

Koulpélogo in the Center-East Region of Burkina Faso, close to the limit with the East Region. 

The project site is located approximately 250 km south-east of Ouagadougou, the country's capital. 

Access to Nabanga is by means of (Route Nationale) RN04, an all-weather paved road from 

Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, through Fada N'Gourma. From there, travel is via RN18, 

an all-weather paved road to within approximately 15 km of the Nabanga Project. An unsealed dirt 

road, which crosses the Kompienga River, is then used to access the Nabanga property 

approximately 15 km to the west of RN18, although other similar dirt access roads can be used to 

access other parts of the property. 

As part of the environmental approval process in Burkina Faso, SEMAFO will carry out an 

Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ("ESIA") for the Nabanga Project. Currently, little has 

been done to collect environmental and social data in the Project area since the Project is only at an 

early stage of study.  

This Project being still at an early stage, no formal process for the Environmental and Social Impact 

Assessment ("ESIA") has been started at this stage. 

The typical approach that will be developed by SEMAFO during the future ESIA will take into 

consideration the social and environmental concerns of all interested parties. These concerns will be 

integrated into the initial stages of the project design. This approach aims at maximising the project's 

integration into the environment and minimising its negative impacts to increase the environmental 

and social acceptability of the Project. 

In addition, this approach will allow a better understanding of the social aspects arising from the 

resettlement of households due to the presence of the mine facilities. 

DRA/Met-Chem has performed a review of existing information and desktop reports provided by 

SEMAFO. DRA/Met-Chem has prepared a summary of relevant environmental and social issues, 

which is presented in this Section. 

20.1 Legal Framework and Permits to Obtain 

The legal framework for the construction and operation of mining facilities in Burkina Faso includes 

national and international policies, regulations, and guidelines. The design and environmental 

management of the Project's facilities and activities will be performed in accordance with this legal 

framework. 

Burkina Faso has a regulatory framework for environmental and social management. The relevant 

Burkina Faso policies, laws and regulations pertaining to mine development were taken into account

20.1.3 MINING CODE 

The Mining Code (Law N°036-2015/CNT pertaining to the Mining Code of Burkina Faso) is 

administered by the Ministère des Mines et des carrières ("MMC") and provides the legal framework 

for the mining industry in the country.  The state owns title to all mineral rights and these rights are 

acquired through a map-based system by direct application to the MMC.  

The Mining Code guarantees a stable fiscal regime for the life of any mine developed. It also 

guarantees stabilization of the financial and customs regulations and rates during the operational 

period to reflect the rates in place at the date of signing. The Mining Code also states that no new 

taxes can be imposed with the exception of mining duties, taxes and royalties. However, the title 

holder can also benefit from any reductions of tax rates during the life of the operating license. 

There are three (3) types of mining permits and three (3) types of authorizations according to the 

Mining Code:  

Mining Permits 

• Research Permit. 

• Industrial Operating Permit.

November 2019 
DRA/Met-Chem Ref.: C3852-Nabanga-PEA-Final Report  
002-C3852-NI43-101_PEA_Nabanga_Final 

• Semi Mechanized Small-Scale Operating Permit. 

Authorizations: 

• Prospecting Authorization. 

• Traditional Artisanal Mining Authorization. 

• Quarrying Authorization. 

Adopted in June 2015 by the National Transitional Council, the new mining code complies with 

Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the community mining policies of the 

West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA from its French designation, Union 

économique et monétaire ouest-africaine) by integrating a number of provisions for a better 

contribution of mining projects to the country's economic development. In particular, the new Mining 

Code establishes the creation of a mining fund for local development to fund municipal and regional 

development plans, to which the mining license holders will contribute up to 1% of their monthly 

turnover or the value of extracted products during the month. Like the preceding Mining code, the 

new code requires mining projects to conduct an ESIA and to meet the Environmental Code 

requirements. 

Other relevant changes in the new mining code include: the removal of the mining agreement for the 

research phase; application of a specific transaction tax on mining titles; the possibility of suspending 

or removing mining titles or authorizations without notice when required by public order. The new 

mining code provides for the adoption of decrees relating to the implementation of various provisions 

of this code. No such decree has been adopted up to and including the date of this Report. 

20.1.4 INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK  

The main institutional stakeholders in the environment include: 

• Ministry of Environment, the Green Economy and Climate Change (MEEVCC: Ministère de 

l'Environnement, de l'économie verte et du changement climatique).

20.1.5 PERMITS TO OBTAIN 

The Project will trigger a range of regulatory requirements and processes, which will require the 

application for, receipt of, and compliance with a variety of environmental permits and approvals from 

the relevant Burkinabé authorities. 

The application for an Operating permit requires a Feasibility Study (FS) that must first be accepted 

by MEEVCC. The FS must include an ESIA, which must include a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) 

that has been accepted by all stakeholders.  

Once in production, a mining permit holder is required to open under his name, a Trust account 

named "Fonds de préservation et de réhabilitation de l'environnement minier" at the Banque Centrale 

des États de l'Afrique de l'ouest ("BCEAO"). This account must be funded annually on January 1 by 

an amount equal to the total rehabilitation budget presented in the ESIA, divided by the number of 

years of expected production to cover the costs of mine reclamation, closure and rehabilitation. The 

required permits and administrative procedures are presented in Table 20.1.

20.2 Baseline Studies 

No environmental baseline studies have been undertaken by SEMAFO concerning the Nabanga 

Project at this stage. 

20.3 Project Impacts, Risk Analysis, Environmental and Social Management Plan 

The typical methodology used to identify and analyze the environmental impacts is based on an 

approach recognized by international funding agencies. This approach identifies the direct 

interactions between the project activities considered impact sources and the physical, biological, 

and human components. These interactions are customized according to project-specific phases 

(construction, operation and closure). All interactions identified are then analyzed on the basis of 

three criteria (intensity, extent and duration) to obtain a global indicator, the importance of the impact. 

Three (3) levels of the importance of the impact were determined: minor, medium, and major. 

It is anticipated that the Nabanga Project will result in several negative impacts and some of the 

major impacts expected include the following: 

• Surface water and groundwater. 

• Noise levels. 

• Social and economic aspects regarding resettlement. 

• Cultural heritage. 

The economic impact of the Project at local, regional, and national levels is positive. Beginning from 

the construction phase, direct and indirect jobs will be created, resulting in tangible economic benefits 

for both local and regional communities. The project will create hundreds of skilled and unskilled 

direct and indirect jobs, most of them awarded to Burkinabé workers. This job creation will increase 

household incomes and improve living conditions. In addition, the procurement of goods and services 

required for the construction, operation, and closure of the mine will bring significant economic 

benefits to local and regional businesses, the majority in terms of supplying food and/or various 

products. 

The revenues generated by the mining operation will increase Burkina Faso's internal revenue 

through taxes and royalties charged by the local authorities. These revenues should have a beneficial 

impact at both the local and regional levels through increased investments in social and health 

services, and educational facilities. In addition, SEMAFO typically supports a number of social 

programs for the displaced households as it was previously done for the Mana and Boungou 

operations, and in a broader context, the local and regional communities.

20.3.1 RISK ANALYSIS 

No formal Risk Analysis was conducted so far on the Nabanga Project as it is still at an early stage 

of development. Further analysis will be conducted in a later phase such as the Feasibility or 

Construction phase. 

20.3.2 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLAN 

No formal Environmental and Social Management Plan ("ESMP") has been developed so far on the 

Nabanga Project. The ESMP will cover all project phases and allow avoiding, minimising, enhancing, 

or compensating the various anticipated impacts by reducing them to an acceptable level for all 

stakeholders. 

20.4 Acid Rock Drainage & Waste Disposal 

At this stage, no Acid Rock Drainage ("ARD") and Waste Disposal Management Plan have been 

developed. During the course of the Feasibility Study, further detailed test work will be undertaken 

and ultimately a formal ARD (if necessary) and Waste Disposal Management Plan will be developed. 

20.5 Closure, Decommissioning, and Reclamation 

Following operations, the site will undergo comprehensive decommissioning and reclamation. The 

decommissioning and reclamation plan will conform to Burkinabé requirements. 

The Nabanga Project closure, decommissioning and reclamation costs are estimated to 5.0 MUSD. 

These costs were included in the financial analysis for these closure activities. 

The items presented in the cost estimation are based on a Conceptual Closure and Reclamation 

Plan and has an accuracy level of up to ±50%. The Closure and Rehabilitation Plan and its costs 

estimates will have to be better detailed prior to provide the Reclamation Trust to BCEAO. It is of the 

QP's opinion that this level of accuracy on the closure cost will have negligible effect on the global 

project economics. 

This Mine Closure and Reclamation Plan include work to be conducted from the closure of the mine, 

at the end of operational activities, as well as progressive rehabilitation work. 

Also, the closure, decommissioning and reclamation will be prepared to satisfy the concerns of all 

stakeholders. The closure and reclamation plan will be developed in accordance with the national 

guidelines for preparing a mining site rehabilitation plan. The mine closure plan will be approved 

before the start of operations. The main objectives of the Closure and Reclamation Plan include 

restoring ecosystems and take-over and recovery of land uses.

20.6 Conclusion 

As the Project is in its early stages of study, little has been done to date to promote the Project to the 

various stakeholders and investigate local environmental and social settings.  

As the Project progresses, an environmental and social impact study will be initiated, as well as 

public hearings and stakeholder consultations. The mitigation measures and environmental 

management plans will be prepared and discussed during the public inquiry, as well as a mine 

closure and reclamation plan.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 

The Project scope covered in this Report is based on the construction of a green field mining and 

processing facility with an average mill feed capacity of 360,000 tonnes per year of material and 

producing an average of 70,000 oz per year of gold. 

The capital and operating cost estimates related to the mine, the concentrator, and all required 

facilities and infrastructure have been developed by DRA/Met-Chem or consolidated from external 

sources. 

The capital and the operating costs are reported in United States Dollars ("$"). 

21.1 Capital Cost Estimate (Capex) 

The capital cost estimate ("Capex") consists of direct and indirect capital costs as well as 

contingency. Provisions for sustaining capital are also included, mainly for tailings storage expansion. 

Amounts for the mine closure and rehabilitation of the site have been estimated as well. The working 

capital is discussed in Section 22 – Economic Analysis. 

21.1.1 SCOPE OF THE ESTIMATE 

The Capex includes the material, equipment, labour and freight required for the mine pre-

development, processing facilities, tailings storage and management, as well as all infrastructure and 

services necessary to support the operation. 

The Capex prepared for this PEA is based on a Class 4 type estimate as per the Association for the 

Advancement of Cost Engineering ("AACE") Recommended Practice 47R-11 with a target accuracy 

of ±35%. Although some individual elements of the Capex may not achieve the target level of 

accuracy, the overall estimate falls within the parameters of the intended accuracy. 

The reference period for the cost estimate is Q3 2019. 

21.1.1.1 Major Assumptions 

The Capex is based on the Project obtaining all relevant permits in a timely manner to meet the 

Project schedule. 

The Capex reflects an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management ("EPCM") type 

execution wherein one EPCM contractor will provide the design, procurement and construction 

activities for the Project. All sub-contracts would be managed by the EPCM contractor. 

All back-fill materials will be available from gravel pits or other sources located close to the site. Mine 

waste rock is not suitable for use in road construction. All excavated material will be disposed of 

within the site battery limits.

21.1.1.2 Major Exclusion 

The following items were not included in the Capex: 

• Provision for inflation, escalation, currency fluctuations and interest incurred during 

construction; 

• Project financing costs; 

• All duties and taxes; however, they are considered in the economic analysis. 

21.1.2 CAPITAL COSTS SUMMARY 

Table 21.1 presents a summary of the pre-production initial capital and the sustaining capital costs 

for the Project. 

a. Pre-production Initial Capital Cost 

The pre-production initial capital cost for the scope of work is $ 83.7 M, of which $ 52.6 M is 

direct cost, $ 17.2 M is indirect cost, $ 13.9 M is contingency. 

Provision for sustaining capital is $ 55.9 M, excluding the amounts for working capital.

b. Closure and Rehabilitation Costs 

Based on site layouts, a provision of $ 5.0 M was estimated for the closure and rehabilitation of 

the mine site. Requirements were established and cost estimation was based on material take-

off and unit rates from recent projects. 

The expenses were accounted for in the economic analysis and incurred during the final years 

of the life of mine. 

No provision is required for the dismantling and disposal of the industrial facilities as it is 

assumed that the costs will be compensated by the salvage value. 

21.1.3 BASIS OF ESTIMATE GENERAL 

The capital cost estimate covers the facilities included in the scope of the work described in previous 

sections. 

The Capex is based on the following key assumptions: 

• The proposed construction work week is 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. All construction 

workers will be either from the nearby area or housed in a camp provided by the Owner; 

• Fluctuations to nominated currency exchange rates are excluded; 

• Allowance for industrial dispute or lost time arising from industrial actions is excluded; 

• All taxes and duties are excluded; 

• Escalation is excluded; 

• Project financing costs and interest during construction is excluded; 

• No allowance is made for acceleration or deceleration of the Project schedule; 

• Project insurance is included in the Owner's cost. 

The Capex is based on an advance period whereby the design concepts are frozen and basic 

engineering commences. The timing for this start is following approval of the EIS and obtaining initial 

permits. The work would then continue through its lifecycle until the end of the construction and 

commissioning. 

a. Currency 

The Capex base currency is United States Dollars (USD). The Capex consists of items quoted 

in various foreign currencies which have been converted into USD using exchange rates as of 

August 30, 2019. Table 21.2 shows the currency exchange rates used in this Report.

b. Deliverables 

The Capex estimate was developed based on the following list of deliverables: 

▪ Project description; 

▪ Mine plan, complete with initial mining equipment and pre-production costs; 

▪ Mechanical equipment list; 

▪ MTO for major electrical equipment, including the power plant; 

▪ MTO for tailings storage, including tailings' roads as well as tailings and reclaim water 

pipelines; 

▪ Overall general arrangement plan. 

c. Estimating Software 

The Capex was developed using MS Excel. 

d. Labour Cost and Productivity 

Labour manhours were developed internally, for each site activities. The productivity factors 

vary as a function of the expected qualifications as well as of the building height and the 

congestion; it varies from 1.16 to 1.64 with an overall weighted average of 1.33. It should be 

noted that a PF of 1.0 refers to projects being executed with better than average skill, base 40 

hours workweek, within reasonable commuting distance, limited in-plant movement, favorable 

weather, etc. 

Labour rates were developed based on salary information reflecting local labour. They are 

inclusive of salaries, contractors' indirect costs, namely mob and demob, small tools, 

construction equipment, consumables, PPE, temporary site establishments, supervision, 

administration as well as overhead and profit. 

It is assumed that the local communities can accommodate the direct and indirect workforce 

estimated for the Project, including occasional site visits and vendor representatives. The peak 

workforce is estimated to reach 300, with an average of 200. Local accommodation as well as 

rotational transportation costs are included as part of construction field indirect costs.

e. Freight, Duties and Taxes 

Based on recent surveys and studies and when not included in the cost, the freight was 

accounted for by adding a factor to the value of the goods; a factor of 10 % is applied. 

All duties and taxes were excluded from the capital cost, but relevant factors were considered 

for the after-tax economic analysis. 

21.1.4 METHODOLOGY 

a. Data Sources 

A mechanical equipment list was developed by Engineering. Conceptual estimates, 

supplemented by general arrangements drawings, were used for civil works, including 

earthworks, concrete and structural steel. To ensure the entire scope coverage, some 

allowances were added, based on DRA/Met-Chem's experience. Piping, electrical distribution 

downwards of electrical rooms as well as instrumentation and controls were factored from 

mechanical.  

Budgetary quotations were obtained for major plant equipment with the balance of the plant 

equipment costs generally developed based on an internal database. Some equipment costs 

were estimated when no relevant data was available. 

Rates for bulk material were estimated. 

b. EPCM Services 

While the Project may not ultimately be executed via the EPCM model, the cost estimate was 

structured on that basis. EPCM services consist of the following: 

▪ EPCM team salaries, fringes, uplifts, recruitment, overhead, etc.; 

▪ EPCM team expenses (i.e. business travelling, room & board, accommodation, etc.); 

▪ Home office support and expenses (communications, IT services, IT equipment, courier, 

printing, office space, furniture, consumables, stationaries, etc.). 

For the initial Capex, EPCM services costs are estimated at 14% of the direct costs.  

c. Construction Field Indirect Cost 

Site construction indirect costs are included as a percentage of direct costs: 

▪ Site preparation for all temporary infrastructures and buildings, construction facilities, 

laydown areas, temporary services, etc.; 

▪ Temporary roads, walkways, parking areas and fencing, c/w signage and including 

temporary lighting, complete with maintenance; 

▪ Temporary buildings/construction facilities (offices – for EPCM and Owner's staff, camp, 

cafeteria, laundry facilities, medical clinic, security gate/office, etc.), complete with

mobilization, demobilization, rental, operations and maintenance. It should be noted that 

contractors will be responsible for the provision of their own temporary facilities. 

▪ Temporary infrastructure for the supply of power, fuel, gas, water and communications. It 

should be noted that contractors will be responsible for their own temporary 

infrastructures. 

▪ Temporary infrastructure for the management of sewerage and construction waste (dry 

and wet, hazardous and non-hazardous), including collection, treatment and disposal. It 

should be noted that contractors will be responsible for their own requirements. 

▪ Pad preparation and fencing – only – of contractor's pads are included in the construction 

field indirect costs; 

▪ Field office supply (IT equipment, courier, printing, office space, furniture, consumables, 

etc.); 

▪ Access control and monitoring; 

▪ Temporary lay down and storage areas, as well as warehousing, complete with, but not 

limited to, materials management and materials handling equipment; 

▪ Mobilization and demobilization of all above listed temporary site establishments and 

restoration back to original site conditions; 

▪ Site surveying 

▪ Site security; 

▪ Light vehicles; 

▪ First aid and medical services; 

▪ General and final clean-up. 

Construction field indirect costs are estimated at 10% of the direct costs. They are inclusive of 

vendor representatives for construction and commissioning.  

d. Owner's Costs 

Owner's costs were estimated at 4% of all direct costs. 

e. Other Costs 

Costs for spare parts, special tools and initial fills are estimated at 3.25% of equipment costs for 

the initial capex phase. It is assumed that none will be required for sustaining capex as they are 

included as part of normal operations. 

f. Project Contingency 

For initial Capex, the project contingency was assessed at 13.9 M, representing 20% of all costs. 

g. Inflation 

Inflation beyond this Capex estimate base date is explicitly excluded.

21.2.4 MINING OPERATING COSTS 

The Open Pit operating costs have been estimated using similar contractors' costs used in other 

SEMAFO mine sites in Burkina Faso. This cost does not include a cost increment to consider the 

deepening of the pit. It is an average cost over the pit life. The unit costs used are the following: 

• Ore mining costs: $2.47/t; 

• Waste mining costs: $2.36/t. 

The underground operating costs have been estimated using similar contractors' costs than the one 

of other SEMAFO UG operation. A detailed estimation exercise was done using these contractor 

rates, for manpower, equipment, and maintenance. The resulting unit costs for production and 

development are the following: 

• UG mineralized material production unit cost: $53.68 per tonnes mined. 

• UG lateral development unit cost: $5,789 per m of advance (using a section of 23.6 m² on 

average).

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

The project has been evaluated using discounted cash flow analysis (DCF). Cash inflows were 

estimated based on annual revenue projections. The economic/financial assessment of the project 

is based on Q3-2019 price projections and cost estimates in U.S. currency. No provision was made 

for the effects of inflation. The evaluation was carried out on a 100 %-equity basis.  

Current tax regulations in Burkina Faso were applied to assess the project's tax rate and royalty 

regime. The Net Present Value (NPV) of the project was calculated by discounting back cash flow 

projections throughout the life-of-mine (LOM) to the Project's valuation date using a base case 

discount rate of 5%. The internal rate of return (IRR) and the payback period were also calculated. 

The financial indicators under base case conditions are shown in Table 22.1.

22.1.1 MACRO-ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS 

The main macro-economic assumptions used in the base case are given in Table 22.2. The gold 

price assumption is based on the latest corporate directives from SEMAFO. The sensitivity analysis 

examines a range of prices going from $1,000/oz to $1,600/oz of gold.

22.1.2 MINERAL ROYALTIES 

Burkina Faso royalties on gold have been applied to the project. A 5% royalty has been considered 

for the Project; moreover, a 1% development tax has been applied on the total revenue. 

22.1.3 TAXATION REGIME 

Annual corporate tax liabilities were calculated under the Burkina Faso tax regime. These are based 

on the 2015 new mining tax laws applied to capital costs, operating costs, sales of gold and profits. 

The following assumptions were applied when calculating corporate taxes: 

• 27.5% of corporate tax rate (income tax) 

• Taxes are payable periodically, assumed yearly 

• The project's assets are depreciated over their useful life, which is the total life of the project 

(8 years) which is in accordance with Burkina Faso Taxation legislation 

22.1.4 PROJECT FINANCING 

No assumptions have been made on the financing of the project for the purpose of determining the 

net revenue. 

22.1.5 TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS 

The first production year consists of a ramp-up period of 3 months followed by 9 months during which 

production meets full capacity. 

The engineering and construction period have been estimated at approximately 24 months, which is 

relatively common for this type of project given its size. 

22.2 Cash Flow Analysis and Financial Results 

Figure 22.1 illustrates the after-tax cash flow, the income tax, and the cumulative cash flow profiles. 

The graph shows that the after-tax payback period has been estimated at approximately 4.4 years.

Figure 22.1 – After-Tax Cash Flow and Cumulative Cash Flow Profiles 

 

A summary of the evaluation results is provided in Table 22.3 and Table 22.4 denotes the cash flow 

statement for the base case scenario. 

The summary and cash flow statement indicate that the total pre-production (initial) capital costs was 

evaluated at $ 83.7 M. The sustaining capital requirement was evaluated at $ 55.9 M. Mine closure 

costs have been estimated at $5.0M. 

The cash flow statement shows the estimated capital spending schedule over the 18-month pre-

production period of the Project (the Year -1 column covers a 6-month period).  

The total revenue derived from the sale of the gold was estimated at $ 740.3 M, and the total 

operating costs were estimated at $ 333.5 M (excluding government royalties). 

The financial results indicate a Pre-Tax Net Present Value ("NPV") of $ 146.7 M at a discount rate of 

5 %. The Pre-Tax Internal Rate of Return ("IRR") is 31.4 % and the payback period is 3.5 years.  

The After-Tax NPV is $ 99.8 M at a discount rate of 5 %. The After-Tax IRR is 22.6 % and the 

payback period is 4.4 years.

22.3 Sensitivity Analysis 

A sensitivity analysis has been carried out, with the base case described above as a starting point, to 

assess the impact of changes in total pre-production capital expenditure ("Capex"), operating costs 

("Opex") and gold price ("Price") on the Project's NPV @ 5 % and IRR. Each variable was examined 

one-at-a-time. An interval of 30 % with increments of 10 % was used for the three (3) variables. 

The Pre-Tax results of the sensitivity analysis, as shown in Figure 22.2, indicate that, within the limits 

of accuracy of the cost estimates in this Report, the Project's Pre-Tax viability does not seem 

significantly vulnerable to the under-estimation of capital and operating costs, taken one at-a-time. 

As seen in Figure 22.2, the NPV is more sensitive to variations in Opex than Capex, as shown by the 

steeper slope of the Opex curve. As expected, the NPV is most sensitive to variations in price. The 

NPV becomes negative at a price variation of more than -30%. This corresponds to a break-even 

gold price of about $950/oz. 

Figure 22.2 – Pre-Tax NPV5 % & IRR  
Sensitivity to Capital Expenditure, Operating Cost and Price 

  

The variations in internal rate of return, provides the same conclusions. Due to the different timing 

associated with Capex versus Opex, the IRR is more sensitive to variations in Capex than Opex for 

negative variations, but remains less sensitive to Capex for positive variations.  

The same conclusions can be made from the After-Tax results of the sensitivity analysis as shown in 

Figure 22.3. It indicates that the Project's after-tax viability is mostly vulnerable to a price forecast 

reduction, while being less affected by the under-estimation of capital and operating costs.  

The NPV becomes negative at a price variation of more than 30% also, with a break-even gold price 

of about $970/oz.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

This Report was prepared and compiled by DRA/Met-Chem under the supervision of the QPs at the 

request of SEMAFO. This Report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of National 

Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. 

25.1 Conclusions 

The mineralized material planned to be mined as part of the Nabanga Project includes 616 Kt grading 

6.45 g/t of gold from the Open Pits and 2.364 Mt grading 6.48 g/t of gold from the underground mine. 

The total mineralized material planned to be mined over the life of mine is 2.980 Mt at an average 

grade of 6.47 g/t of gold. The duration of the life of mine has been estimated at approximately 9 years. 

Given the relatively short duration of the operation, it has been assumed that a mine contractor would 

be hired to perform the Open Pit and Underground mining activities. 

The processing plant is designed to process 360 Kt/y of run of mine to produce approximately 68,000 

ounces per year of gold based on a recovery of 92%. A suitable process flowsheet including crushing, 

grinding, flotation, regrind, leaching, elution, and carbon regeneration.  

Tailings storage facility, camp facilities, power generation facilities as well as infrastructure and 

services have been added to complete the investment cost of the Project.   

The pre-production initial capital cost, at an accuracy level of ±35%, is evaluated at 83.7M USD while 

the sustaining capital requirement, at an accuracy level of ±50%, is 55.9M USD.  

The life of mine all-in sustaining costs is evaluated at 760 USD/oz of gold produced.  

Mine closure and rehabilitation cost have been estimated at 5M USD. 

The economic analysis of the project has demonstrated the potential viability of the project over its 9 

years life of mine expectancy with recommendations to proceed to next level of Feasibility studies. At 

an average gold price of $1,300/oz, the financial results indicate a Pre-Tax NPV of 146.7 M USD at 

discount rates of 5 %. The before-tax Internal Rate of Return is 31.4% with a payback period of 3.5 

years. The After-Tax NPV is 99.8 M USD at discount rates of 5%. The After-Tax IIR is 22.6 % and 

the payback period is 4.4 years. 

25.2 Risk Evaluation 

The risks affecting the economic and technical viability of the Project will be reduced as geotechnical 

and hydrogeological studies, more metallurgical testing, and engineering are undertaken during the 

next phase. 

As for all mining projects, external risks beyond the control of the project such as the political situation 

in the Project region, commodity prices, exchange rates and government legislations are much more 

difficult to anticipate and mitigate.  

Negative variance to these risks from the assumptions used to build the block model may have an 

impact on Mineral Resource Estimates.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

26.1 Mining and Geology 

It is recommended to increase the level of knowledge of the mineral resources of the Nabanga Project 

with the implementation of a new drilling campaign. 

This campaign should aim at bringing the resource category to the Measured and Indicated level as 

much as possible, and also to increase the resource base at depth and along strike. 

Given the size of the project and its expected life of mine duration, a formal discussion with different 

potential mining contractors should be done.  

The ventilation system should also be studied in more details in the next stages of the project, and a 

ventilation model should be developed. 

26.2 Geotechnical 

As the Nabanga Project will move ahead into the next phases of development, more geotechnical 

test work and analysis will be needed. A geotechnical drilling program will have to be carried out, with 

the following objectives: 

• Final pit slope angle assessment; 

• Geotechnical and ground support recommendations for portals excavations; 

• Recommendation for stope dimension; 

• 2D/3D finite element analysis, and ground support recommendations for the development 

areas and the production stope. 

26.3 Hydrogeology and Hydrology 

A hydrogeological investigation program should take place, possibly at the same time than the next 

geotechnical drilling program (for assessment of the pit slope and stope stability). Pumping / 

dewatering hole could be designed at this point, if required. 

Similarly, a hydrology assessment should take place as part of the PFS or DFS of the Nabanga 

Project. This work is required to evaluate the rain water contribution on the overall drainage.  The 

hydrological data will be used to design the drainage system of the site, sediment ponds / sumps to 

collect the water and pumping / piping systems to remove the water from the open pit. Although the 

annual average rainfall is low, management of surface stormwater will be important due to large inter-

year variability, potential for heavy rains periods during the wet month and relatively flat ground.

26.4 Process Recommendations 

26.4.1 TRADE-OFF STUDIES 

There are a number of Trade-Off Studies (TOS) that will need to be conducted prior to or during the 

prefeasibility stage. These TOS were identified during the PEA stage of the Project, but were not 

conducted due to the timing and/or availability of metallurgical test work information during the PEA. 

26.4.1.1 Grinding using one large mill or two smaller ones. 

Since there will be a large variability in material hardness, a trade-off study should be done to 

investigate the most efficient method of absorbing these variations. Two (2) smaller mills will adapt to 

changes in material hardness easier than one large mill. Further, two (2) small mills are more energy 

efficient, but will have a larger Capex associated with them. The best selection needs to be 

investigated in the FS. 

26.4.1.2 Intensive Cyanide Leaching of Flotation Concentrate  

There are additional operating costs and issues associated with intensive cyanidation. Cyanide also 

dissolves copper sulphides and this has been an issue at operations that have of copper sulphides 

in the mill feed stream. It can lead to high cyanide consumption levels and produce doré with high 

copper levels. This will need to be investigated in the test work program at the next stage of project 

development. 

26.4.1.3 Carbon–in-Leach versus Carbon-in-Pulp (CIL vs CIP) 

CIL is the conservative approach of designing a gold operation. The CIL plant ensures that if preg-

robbing (gold) particles are in the slurry the carbon adsorb the gold preferentially. However, this leads 

to a significant higher carbon inventory and lower gold loading on the carbon and thus less efficiency 

during stripping. CIP entails the addition of CIP tanks after leaching has been completed. The 

inventory and wear of carbon is thus less. A CIL vs. CIP trade-off study is recommended for the next 

stage of the project to validate the Capex impact. 

26.4.1.4 Post Leach Thickener vs No Thickening 

Some plants with high discharge cyanide levels have a post leach cyanide thickener after leaching. 

This reduces cyanide consumption.  

26.4.1.5 Large Bulk Reagent Tanks versus Totes 

The decision to use drums reagent in the PEA design is based upon prior experience. During the 

feasibility study, reagent costs for bulk versus totes should be evaluated in greater detail to determine 

the most cost-effective option. Generally, bulk reagent deliveries are often lower in cost and the issue 

dealing with empty totes is avoided. Evidently, there is an associated Capex cost associated with 

storage of bulk chemicals.

26.4.2 OTHER TEST WORKS 

Additional physical characterisation test work will need to be completed. It is understood that further 

testing on mineralized material from deeper in the deposit and variability testing will need to be 

completed. 

Flotation concentrate characterisation including settling, filtering and physical characterisation for 

regrind mill requirements will be required. 

Additional leach and adsorption testing will be required including variability test work to determine any 

differences throughout the mineralized material with respect to recovery and reagent consumption. 

Testing will also be used to determine the requirement of Oxygen vs. Air as a leach circuit oxidant 

and also to determine the optimum leach and adsorption circuit flowsheet, CIP vs. CIL. 

26.5 Environment 

It is recommended to perform the following work in connection with environmental activities: 

• Extend soil and surface water surveys to select the best location for the tailing ponds, waste 

rock and overburden piles;

1.3.1 Nominal

1.3.2 Design
These values are used to size equipment. Normally these values are nominal values with a design factor. In some cases these values are based off client needs.

1.3.3 Operating Time
Crushing plant operating time  (measured in hours) is the period that the crusher discharge conveyor operates under normal load.

Processing plant operating time  (measured in hours) is the period that the SAG Mill feed conveyor operates under normal load.

1.3.4 Operating Percentage
Operating percentage is operating time period divided by the calendar time period expressed in a percentage.

1.3.5 Weight recovery
All weight recoveries are based on New Feed, unless stated otherwise.

1.3.6 New Feed
New Feed is the ore placed on the SAG Mill feed conveyor material  by the Apron Feeder underneath the stockpile.

1.4 Colour coding
1.4.1 Black

Final information from either test work, supplier, DRA or client experience.

Used in this context, nominal is a synonym for "normal" or "expected". The values displayed in the mass balance are nominal values. These values are the expected tonnages when the 
plant is fully operational and normal operating conditions.
