1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Pincock Allen & Holt (PAH) prepared this technical report at the request of Compliance Energy 
Corporation (CEC) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Compliance Coal Corporation (CCC).   CEC is a publicly 
traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange, under the symbol CEC.  CEC, through CCC dba Comox 
Joint Venture (CJV), has a 60 percent interest in the Raven project.  The CJV comprises three companies:  
CCC (60 percent); I-Comox Coal Inc (ICC), a subsidiary of Itochu Corporation (20 percent); and LG 
International Investments (Canada) Ltd. (LGI) (20 percent).  CCC has been nominated the manager of 
the CJV (AMEC, 2009; Tapics, 2010).   

This Technical Report has been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, Form 43-101F1 
and submitted to CEC.  The purpose of this document is to build on the previous report dated June 04, 
2010 which presented results of the 2009 exploration program completed on CCC's Raven coal property 
as of December 31, 2009, and reported updated underground coal resources based on data acquired in 
2009 and earlier data used for prior Technical Reports on the property.  Based on the resource models 
developed, PAH has completed a pre-feasibility study on the project and this report presents a summary 
of the pre-feasibility findings in Section 22.  Based on the economic analysis conducted as part of the 
pre-feasibility study, reserves are also reported.         

O. R. Cullingham Resource Consultants (ORC) of Calgary, Alberta, completed a Technical Report for 
Raven resource estimates based on drilling at Raven completed through 2007.  This report was dated 
June 7, 2007 and filed June 12, 2007.  The June 2007 Technical Report, covering exploration activities 
and resource estimates inclusive of 2007 drill data, was the most recent Technical Report filed for the 
Raven surface area prior to the June 04, 2010 report and is referenced extensively in this report.  A 
previous Technical Report by Gardner Exploration Consultants Ltd.  (GEC) for resource estimates on this 
property in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 was dated July 31, 2001, filed August 8, 2001, 
and covered exploration activities and resource estimates inclusive of 2001 drill data, and is also 
referenced in this document.  

1.1 Location 

The Raven property is located at the south end of the Tsable River Coal Field within the Comox Basin.  It 
is about midway along the east coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, approximately 20 kilometers 
south of the city of Courtenay and 198 km north of the island's largest city, Victoria, see Figure 1-1. 

1.2 Exploration  

Initial exploration began in the mid-1860s with the development of the small Baynes Sound Mine.  
Between 1905 and 1957 the mineral rights in the area were controlled by Canadian Collieries/Dunsmuir 
Collieries who drilled 79 holes in the vicinity of the project area.  In the early 1960s, the assets were sold 
to American Plywood Company (the forerunner of Weldwood of Canada Limited) primarily for the  



Project No.

extensive forest land holdings.  Weldwood through name change became West Fraser, who then sold the 
mineral rights to CCC, the current mineral rights owner (Cullingham, 2007; Cullingham, 2010).  

The next stage of exploration occurred in 1975, when a test adit was constructed along the banks of 
Cowie Creek, and 16 holes were drilled in the vicinity of the project area to verify earlier drilling and 
define the resource.  As a result of this work, Weldwood was able to surrender some of its holdings to 
the Crown.  No further exploration was done until 1990 when Consolidated Brinco acquired an option 
from Weldwood to explore for coal in the southern Comox Basin and specifically in the Tsable River 
coalfield.  Consolidated Brinco drilled 20 holes south of the Tsable River. 

In 1996 and 1997, Hillsborough Resources Limited (as a result of a merger with Consolidated Brinco in 
1991) drilled 27 holes east of the main area previously drilled, a few holes north of the Tsable River, and 
carried out reflective seismic over the area.  Gardner (1997), a consultant hired by Hillsborough, 
supervised and reported on this work.  Hillsborough, in 2001 drilled five more holes, apparently 
piezometer wells, then completed an NI 43-101 compliant resource report (Gardner, 2001).  Hillsborough 
did no further work at Raven and relinquished its option with Weldwood (Cullingham, 2007). 

In 2005, CCC optioned the property from West Fraser and initiated exploration activities.  The following 
year, CCC ran seismic lines to define structure and basement rock, drilled 12 holes (three partially), 
extracted a 13-tonne bulk sample from a surface adit, and carried out surface reconnaissance mapping.  
O. R. Cullingham, of ORC supervised these activities, and results of this work were filed in an NI43-101 
Technical Report (Cullingham, 2007). 

Exploration by CCC continued in 2009 with emphasis on delineating underground resources.  A total of 41 
new holes were drilled, plus three holes begun in 2006 were completed, with five holes targeted for seam 
gas content studies to be used in mine safety and ventilation planning, nine holes targeted for 
geotechnical studies, and six holes for hydrogeology studies.  Although the drilling is completed, some of 
the laboratory, geological, and engineering studies are currently in progress.  Additionally, 
reconnaissance field mapping was expanded for the property, digital topography data for the Raven 
project area was acquired via LIDAR technology, and environmental studies were initiated.  Again, ORC 
supervised the exploration activities, while AMEC supervised the environmental studies, and PAH, a 
geological and engineering consulting company in Denver, Colorado, was engaged to complete the 
geological model and mine planning studies.   A Technical Report updating resources was filed in June, 
2010 (Livingston & Sessions, 2010). 

Resource estimates for Raven presented in this report are based on data from pre-CCC exploration 
programs and data acquired by CCC exploration between 2006 and 2009.  Raven resource estimates 
have increased significantly from earlier estimates. 

1.3 Coal Seam Structure 

The Raven project area is located in the Tsable River Coalfield, a part of the Comox Coal Basin.  Regional 
dip ranges from 10 to 15 degrees, with local steepening to 26 degrees.  The coal measures occur in the 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   1.4 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Comox Formation of Upper Cretaceous age, primarily in the Cumberland Member.  A total of five coal 
zones (1 through 5, with Zone 1 being the lowest) have been identified across the project area, including 
a total of 12 seams/subseams that are continuous enough to track and model.  Zones 1 and 3 are 
significantly thicker and more continuous than the other three zones and are composed of interbedded 
and interlaminated coals, carbonaceous rocks, and siltstones.  Zones have been subdivided into a number 
of subseams named in this study with corresponding 3-digit coding.  Thus the main seams in the Raven 
project area are the 360, 340, and 150 Seams (corresponding to the 3U, 3L and 1 Seams, respectively). 

The project area has been subjected to post-depositional stresses resulting in normal and reverse faulting 
as well as uplift along the flanks of the Beaufort Mountains to the west.   Current data indicate a reverse 
fault cuts diagonally across the northeast part of the project area, resulting in a repeat of the coal 
section.  A previous seismic study interpreted this as a low-angle thrust fault, although existing drill hole 
data support the simpler high-angle reverse fault scenario.  This fault divides the project area into an 
Upper and Lower Plate.  

1.4 Coal Quality 

Drilling results from the 2009 CCC exploration program continue to indicate High Volatile A coals, based 
on the ASTM D388 standard, within underground minable depths at the Raven project area.  Raw 
composite and incremental analyses of the main seams (dry basis) average 35 percent ash and 1.8 
percent sulphur.  Clean coal quality of Seam 1 averages 9.74 percent ash and 1.17 percent sulphur.  
Seam 3 clean coal quality averages 9.96 percent ash and 1.36 percent sulphur.  An adjusted average for 
each seam, based on the assumption that higher sulphur coals would be segregated and diverted for 
thermal coal applications, results in 9.72 percent ash and 0.99 percent sulphur for Seam 1 and 9.78 
percent ash and 1.01 percent sulphur for Seam 3.  Yields optimized for 10 percent product ash and 1 
percent sulphur average 40 percent.  More detailed quality studies are in progress.   

1.5 Underground Coal Resources 

PAH completed resource estimations effective December 31, 2009, for the Raven project area.  The 
resource estimates are based on reports and data provided by CCC or acquired via SEDAR filings.  Table 
1-1 is a summary of coal resources of the main seams at Raven, based on data acquired by CCC through 
December 2009.  The deposit has been classed as Deposit Type Underground, and a Geology Type of 
Moderate, bordering on Complex. 

Underground coal resources at the Raven project area, prepared by PAH in accordance with National 
Instrument 43-101, have been determined to be suitable for underground mining to depths up to 600m.  
Underground in situ resources for the main seams total approximately 72 million tonnes of combined 
Measured and Indicated resources, and an additional 59 million tonnes of inferred resources, as 
summarized in Table 1-1.

1.6 Underground Mine Reserves 

The Raven deposit is not yet a development or production property.  Based on the resource models 
developed, PAH has completed a pre-feasibility study on the project. This report presents a summary of 
the pre-feasibility findings in Section 22-Additional Requirements for Technical Reports on Development 
Properties and Production Properties.  Based on the economic analysis conducted as part of the pre-
feasibility study, reserve estimates are summarized in Table 1-2 and were derived from a base case in 
which two products, a semisoft coking coal (SSCC) and a thermal coal byproduct, are produced.  The 
reserves summary includes the ROM tonnes mined (includes dilution), and the product coal produced 
(includes factors for coal processing yield, and process efficiency).  Proven and Probable reserves are 
estimated at 30.1 million ROM tonnes which after processing is estimated to yield 13.2 million product 
tonnes. 

 

1.7 Conclusions 

The coals of the Raven project area dip regionally 10 to 15 degrees (Cullingham, 2007), complicated by 
normal and reverse faulting, which have been located via surface mapping and/or inferred from drill hole 
data.  The Geology Type is considered by Cullingham (2007) and the authors to be "Moderate, bordering 
on Complex." 

Exploration to date at CCC's Raven project area has delineated a significant underground resource within 
the main seams of approximately 72 million tonnes of Measured and Indicated coal, with an additional 59 
million tonnes of Inferred coal within the main seams, of which, CCC controls 60 percent through its 
share of the joint venture.  Resource calculations have been performed in accordance with National 
Instrument 43-101.  Reserve calculations are based on pre-feasibility level evaluation and economic 
analysis in accordance with National Instrument 43-101.

The reported underground resources have been constrained by: 

 Distance from data-point assurance-of-existence categories of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred, 
 consideration only of main, or minable, seams, 
 2:1 or greater coal-to-rock ratio within aggregate seam, 
 1.5 m minimum seam thickness, 
 0.3 m minimum separable parting, 
 600 m maximum depth limit for underground mine development, 
 in situ resources (i.e., 100 percent recovery), 
 CCC property boundary limits. 

Coal is generally of high volatile A bituminous rank and has favorable coking coal characteristics 
according to tests from both the 2006 (Cullingham, 2007) and 2009 programs.  It is suitable for the 
metallurgical market as well as various thermal purposes.  However, the coal in raw form has high ash 
and often high sulfur content, and thus will need to be washed.  Although washability tests from 2006 
studies (Cullingham, 2007) indicated that crushing to smaller size fractions would probably be necessary, 
current washability studies indicate a reasonable product can be obtained without crushing to small size 
fractions (see Section 16.3).   

The reported underground reserves are constrained by the mine plan and limited to areas defined as 
Measured or Indicated resource.  Proven and Probable reserves are estimated at 30.1 million ROM tonnes 
which after processing is estimated to yield 13.2 million product tonnes. 

1.8 Recommendations 

Exploration to date has defined the Raven coal resource amenable to underground mining.  Geological 
and coal quality data on the Raven coal property are sufficient to support resource and reserve 
estimations at a pre-feasibility level for the Raven project area.  Recommendations for additional work, 
pending positive results in a feasibility study, would add to the database with regard to refinement of 
certain elements of structural geology, and coal seam development.  These recommendations are: 

PAH recommends additional drilling at Raven to define locations and offsets of some of the normal faults 
and to determine if the reverse fault is low- or high-angle.  If the reverse fault can be determined to be 
low-angle, significant repeat of the coal section may exist on the Lower Plate, thus potentially increasing 
resources in the northeast part of the project area.  Three holes totalling an estimated 1,900 m could 
determine if the Lower Plate is more extensive than currently interpreted, with the concurrent potential to 
increase resources.  Cost for these holes is estimated at C$817,000. 

Additionally, two pairs of holes positioned on either side of two normal faults at the south end of the 
property would help determine offset on these two faults, totalling an estimated 1,050 m.  These four 
fault-offset holes could result in minor resource shift of Inferred resource to Measured or Indicated 
resource, although they would primarily be used in mine design details.   Cost for these holes is 
estimated at C$294,000.   



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   1.7 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

PAH also recommends that several pre-2006 holes lacking geophysical logs be offset and re-drilled in 
order to confirm collar location and downhole lithology with geophysical logs.  Holes with no geophysical 
logs were excluded from resource calculations.  Two holes at the north end of the property, one at the 
south end, and one at the east edge would be targeted for this confirmation drilling and could result in a 
shift of Inferred resource to Measured or Indicated resource.  These four holes would total 600 m for an 
estimated cost of C$168,000.  

PAH also recommends the drilling of three holes at the north end of the property, on the north side of the 
Tsable River.  Fewer holes exist in this area, resulting in a large area of inferred resource.  Additional 
holes would result in refining seam thickness information and could result in a shift of Inferred resource 
to Measured or Indicated resource.  These holes totalling 400 m would cost an estimated C$112,000.   

Mining studies are ongoing.  Areas of uncertainty in engineering design that must be resolved to 
determine bankable feasibility include reject geochemistry to determine if material is potentially acid 
generating, and groundwater inflows and geochemistry to determine underground water management 
and if necessary, water treatment requirements.

1.10 Risk 

Coal mining, and in particular underground coal mining, is carried out in an environment where not all 
events are predictable.  While an effective management team can identify the known risks and take 
measures to manage and mitigate these risks, there is still the possibility of unexpected and 
unpredictable events occurring.  It is not possible, therefore, to remove totally all risks or state with 
certainty that an event that may have a material impact on the operation of the coal mine, will not occur.

2.0  INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 

Pincock Allen & Holt (PAH) prepared this Technical Report at the request of Compliance Energy 
Corporation (CEC) and its wholly-owned subsidiary Compliance Coal Corporation (CCC).   CEC is a publicly 
traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange, under the symbol CEC.  CEC, through CCC dba Comox 
Joint Venture (CJV), has a 60 percent interest in the Raven project.  The CJV comprises three companies:  
CCC (60 percent); I-Comox Coal Inc. (ICC), a subsidiary of Itochu Corporation (20 percent); and LG 
International Investments (Canada) Ltd. (LGI) (20 percent).  CCC has been nominated the manager of 
the CJV (AMEC, 2009; Cullingham, 2010; Tapics, 2010).   

This Technical Report has been prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, Form 43-101F1 
and submitted to CEC.  The purpose of this document is to update the Technical Report issued in June 
2010 with results from the pre-feasibility level studies that have been completed on the project.  The 
June 2010 report included results of the exploration program completed on CCC's Raven coal property as 
of December 31, 2009, and reported updated underground coal resources of said property based on data 
acquired in 2009 from an exploration drilling program, and earlier data used for prior Technical Reports 
on the property.  PAH reviewed and evaluated all geological and technical information currently available, 
and summarized this information within this Technical Report prepared in accordance with National 
Instrument 43-101.  No update or change has been made concerning the resources.  However, reserves 
are detailed based on the pre-feasibility level work completed. 

2.1 Sources of Information   

O R Cullingham Resource Consultants (ORC) of Calgary, Alberta, completed a Technical Report for Raven 
resource estimates based on drilling at Raven completed through 2007.  Owen Cullingham of ORC was 
present during 2006 through 2009 exploration programs and has provided Qualified Person (QP) 
verification of that data.  Data verified by ORC in 2006 and 2007 were used for the 2007 Technical Report 
(Cullingham, 2007).  The ORC report was dated June 7, 2007, and filed June 12, 2007 on SEDAR.  The 
2007 Technical Report, covering exploration activities and resource estimates inclusive of 2007 drill data, 
is the most recent Technical Report filed for the Raven surface area (Cullingham, 2007) and is referenced 
extensively in this report.   

A previous Technical Report by Gardner Exploration Consultants Ltd. (GEC) for resource estimates on this 
property was dated July 31, 2001, filed August 8, 2001, and covered exploration activities and resources 
estimates inclusive of 2001 drilling data (Gardner, 2001).  Stephen Gardner of GEC was present during 
the 2001 exploration program and has provided QP verification of that data for the 2001 report (Gardner, 
2001).  Portions of this current report have been taken from the two previous 43-101 ORC and Gardner 
reports. 

PAH was not present on-site until 2009.  QP verification of pre-2009 data (geophysical logs if available, 
otherwise geologist logs) was accomplished via comparison with nearby 2009 holes.  Locations of older 
holes were often an issue.  ORC acquired aerial photographs for the years holes were drilled, located the 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   2.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

drill pads on the photographs, then pinpointed the locations on the ground via GPS and ground search.  
PAH was able to see a sample of these old locations.  After comparison with previously validated data 
and current 2009 data, PAH considers much of the earlier data consistent and reliable.   

PAH conducted site visits during the 2009 program and provides QP verification of the 2009 data utilized 
in this report.  Additional geologic information was gathered by PAH on visits to the CCC's office in 
Courtenay, British Columbia, in July 2009.  The findings and conclusions of this report are based on 
information provided to PAH by CCC representatives.  CCC has provided copies of technical and other 
reports to PAH, as well as data collected by a number of entities since the early 1900s through to the 
present, including current and prior drilling conducted by CCC between 2006 and the present.        

Geotechnical testing and analysis has been performed by Agapito Associates, Inc., of Golden, Colorado.   

Environmental review, hydrogeological testing, and analysis has been carried out by AMEC Earth & 
Environmental (AMEC), a division of AMEC Americas Limited, of Burnaby, British Columbia (AMEC, 2009).  
AMEC's work is in progress.   

John Alderman, of Advanced Coal Technology, out of Castle Rock, Colorado, has carried out coal quality 
and washability review and analysis.  Alderman's work is in progress.  

Petro-Logic, Inc. out of Calgary, Alberta, has carried out seam gas content studies to be used for safety 
and ventilation design in underground mine planning.   

Birtley Coal and Mineral Testing, out of Calgary, Alberta; David E. Pearson & Associates, Ltd. out of 
Victoria, British Columbia; and SGS Laboratories out of Beckley, West Virginia have carried out testing for 
coal quality, petrography, and carbonization studies respectively on samples obtained during the 2009 
drilling program.   

Wood Mackenzie, out of Annapolis, Maryland, has prepared price forecasts for the proposed product coals 
from the project.

3.0 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 

PAH has relied solely upon information provided by CCC regarding the ownership of mineral holdings for 
the Raven Project, dated November 27, 2008, issued by legal firm Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP of 
Vancouver, British Columbia (Kim, 2008).  PAH has not conducted land title evaluations with respect to 
the Raven Project or deposit and cannot personally verify such data.  CCC has further provided written 
advice on September 20, 2010 to the effect that: 

1. That the undersurface rights, which are related to the Raven Underground Coal Project located near 
Buckley Bay, British Columbia, as described in Fasken Martineau's work on the Raven Project remain 
in their entirety the property of the three co-joint venturers in the Comox Joint Venture, namely 
Compliance Coal Corporation, I-Comox Coal Inc. and LG International Investments (Canada) Ltd. and 
that none of the properties have been disposed of, sold, or conveyed to other parties. 

2. That the undersurface rights addressed in Fasken Martineau's work remain in good standing in 
respect of any obligations associated with them.

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 

4.1 Location   

As seen in Figure 1-1, the Raven resource area is located about midway along the east coast of 
Vancouver Island, British Columbia.  It is located approximately 20 kilometers (km) south of the city of 
Courtenay and 195 km north of the island's largest city, Victoria.  Baynes Sound, separating Denman 
Island from Vancouver Island, is immediately to the east of the property.  The deposit is located within 
the Tsable River Coalfield at the south end of the Comox Basin in the Nanaimo Mining Division and the 
Nanaimo, Nelson, and Newcastle Land Districts.   

The Raven property is located on NTS map sheets (1:50,000) 92F10W and 92F7W or within BCGS 
(1:20,000) map sheets 092F056 (north) and 092F046 (south) (AMEC, 2009). 

4.2   Undersurface and Surface Access Rights 

The Comox Joint Venture (CJV) was formed in February 2009 for the purpose of exploring and 
developing jointly owned coal and mineral rights in the Comox Basin.  The Raven coal property mineral 
rights are owned by the CJV and were acquired by the three companies from West Fraser in November, 
2008.  The CJV comprises three companies:  CCC (60 percent); I-Comox Coal Inc (ICC), a subsidiary of 
Itochu Corporation (20 percent); and LG International Investments (Canada) Ltd. (LGI) (20 percent).  
CCC has been nominated the manager of the CJV (AMEC, 2009; Cullingham, 2010; Tapics, 2010). 

The Raven project area is at the south end of the CJV's (previously West Fraser) fee simple coal rights 
area.  It comprises approximately 3,100 hectares (ha) (9 km x 3.5 km) of mostly fee simple minerals, 
with a small portion (142 ha) controlled through Crown Coal License # 392561 (Figure 4-1) (Cullingham, 
2007).  License coal rights, as compiled by Cullingham (2007), are shown in Table 4-1. 

TABLE 4-1 
Compliance Energy Corporation 
Raven Coal Project  
Raven Crown Coal License Description 

 
 
 
 

The crown coal license at the Raven project area is subject to an annual rental fee of $7/ha, or $994, 
until 2010, then increases to $10/ha for a further five years, and thereafter increases by $5/ha for each 
five-year period to a maximum of $25/ha (Cullingham, 2007). 

Fee simple undersurface rights, including coal, are shown in Table 4-2.  Fee simple undersurface rights at 
Raven carry the right to explore for, develop, and mine coal and fireclay, and provide associated ancillary

In British Columbia, fee simple undersurface rights are subject to an annual mineral land tax of $1.25/ha.  
The annual mineral land tax for the 3,100 hectares of fee simple coal lands contained within the Raven 
project area is approximately $3,700.  No annual work requirements or annual payments other than the 
mineral land tax are due to the government (Cullingham, 2007). 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   4.7 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Surface rights over the property are owned by timber companies, with the exception of Lot 88 which is 
"titled" Crown land.  Access and use of logging roads and permission to carry out exploration on these 
surface lands is provided for in the ancillary access rights owned by the CJV companies.   

All permits required under British Columbia law were obtained prior to commencing exploration work.  
These permits apply to both crown-held coal rights and fee simple.  A Notice of Work was filed detailing 
exploration activities, and a permit was issued (permit #CX-8-008).  Annual amendments are filed for any 
drill hole additions, access changes, etc.  The 2009 Approval document #09-0801003-0506 (issued May 
19, 2009) authorized Compliance to proceed with exploration.   

Currently no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socioeconomic, marketing, political, 
or other relevant issues that may materially affect the potential mining of coal exist within the confines of 
the Raven project area. 

Property boundaries have been obtained from government sources and compiled for West Fraser by 
McElhanney Associates (professional land surveyors) and others.  The author of this report has accepted 
the outlines as presented. 

4.3 First Nations 

According to AMEC (2009), the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office has requested that the 
following First Nations be contacted on the project: 

1. Campbell River First Nation (member of Hamatla Treaty Society) 
2. Cape Mudge First Nation (member of Hamatla Treaty Society) 
3. Comox (K'ómoks) First Nation 
4. Hul'qumin'um Treaty Group 
5. Qualicum First Nation 
6. Sliammon First Nation 
7. Xwemalhkwu Nation (formerly Homalco Indian Band) 

 
The First Nations closest to the proposed Raven Coal Project are the K'ómoks (Comox) and Qualicum 
First Nations.  Although there are no aboriginal land reserves within the project area, K'ómoks, Hamatla 
Treaty Society, Xwemalhkwu Nation, and Sliammon First Nation all have identified part or all of the 
project area as falling within First Nation Statement of Intent Boundaries (AMEC, 2009).

5.0  ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Accessibility   

As seen in Figure 4-1, access for the proposed Raven Coal project area is by the Inland Highway 
(Provincial Highway 19), which runs the length of Vancouver Island and is the main highway 
transportation route for the eastern side of the island.  Most population centers are located near this 
highway, generally between it and the east coast of the island.  The Inland Highway parallels and in 
some places actually crosses the Raven property boundary.  The Island Highway (Provincial Highway 
19A) lies somewhat to the east of the Inland Highway, usually hugging the coast, and passing through 
the island towns and cities along the coast, rather than bypassing them as commonly does the Inland 
Highway.  The E&N Railroad lies parallel to the Island Highway off to the east of the project boundary 
(Cullingham, 2007).   

The Pacific Rim Highway, also known as the Alberni Highway, and Provincial Highway 4, connects the 
Inland Highway (near Qualicum Beach) to Port Alberni and the Alberni Inlet of the Pacific Ocean.  Any 
coal shipped long-distance by water is expected be trucked to Port Alberni, then loaded on sea vessels 
and shipped overseas to Asian markets (AMEC, 2009). 

The only exit from the Inland Highway accessing the Raven project area is the Buckley Bay Mainline, 
which runs parallel to and north of the Tsable River and is a restricted access road controlled by Island 
Timberlands.  Other local forestry and private logging and resource roads provide local access to the 
property, all of which have restricted access due to active logging and private land ownership 
(Cullingham, 2007).    

BC Ferries operates ferry service from Buckley Bay, 20 km south of Courtenay, to Denman Island.  
Hornby Island just to the east of Denman Island can also be accessed via ferry from Denman (AMEC, 
2009).   

The Comox Airport (YQQ) is located on a small peninsula east of the city of Comox.  Airlines that 
routinely service the Comox Airport include West Jet Central Mountain Air and Pacific Coastal, as well as 
various private and charter companies (AMEC, 2009). 

5.2 Climate 

The project area is located in the Coast Western Hemlock zone, which "is characterized by warm, dry 
summers and moist, mild winters with relatively little snowfall.  Growing seasons are long."  "Coldest 
months occur from November to February with daily average temperatures ranging from 3 to 5.5°C and 
the warmest months occur from June to September with average daily temperatures ranging from 14.2 
to 17.6°C.  The monthly average of the daily minimum temperatures never falls below 0°C.  The highest 
precipitation occurs from October to March, while the driest months are July and August.  The area is 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   5.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

susceptible to forest and brush fires and consequent fire closures during the dry summer months" (AMEC, 
2009).  Rainfall in the area is about 1000mm annually.  Although snow does occur, it tends to melt fairly 
quickly (Cullingham, 2007). 

5.3 Local Resources 

The area, located in an active logging region, is forested with second/third growth conifers and some 
deciduous birch (Cullingham, 2007).  No timber sale licenses exist within the project area as they are fee 
simple lands (AMEC, 2009).  The crown land is currently being managed by BC Timber Sales, a statutory 
company set up by the Ministry of Forests and Range, to manage crown-owned land that is not being 
logged by Forest Licencees (Tapics, 2010). 

Most of the Raven project area has been clear-cut starting in the 1800s.  The site has been modified with 
the presence of numerous old graded rail and road tracks, pits, culverts and bridges.  The site is currently 
used for logging and forestry operations.  Cut blocks in the area are in second or third rotations and 
replanting has been a part of the process of reforestation (AMEC, 2009). 

The Raven project area is known to contain in-seam gas, although it is currently unknown whether such 
gas would be economic to develop.  The 2009 drilling program included five holes to assess in-seam gas 
content for use in mine planning regarding ventilation and safety issues.  A gas content study will form 
part of the Feasibility Study and will not be discussed at this time. 

Baynes Sound located due east of the project, is one of Canada's most productive shellfish growing areas 
and is BC's most significant oyster producing area (AMEC, 2009). 

5.4 Infrastructure 

Hydroelectric energy development occurs on the Campbell River and Puntledge River near Comox 
(Government of BC, 2000).  Additional electrical energy needs are supplied by high-voltage transmission 
lines from the Lower Mainland, and by diesel-electric generation at outlying communities.  "The 
sedimentary basins underlying the eastern edge of Vancouver Island and extending beneath Georgia 
Basin have potential for hydrocarbons, mainly natural gas."  Offshore oil and gas resource development is 
under a federal moratorium (AMEC, 2009).  

The Vancouver Island Natural Gas pipeline transports natural gas to the Island from northeast BC.  
Undeveloped energy resources on the Island include: thermal coal and coal-bed methane deposits in the 
sedimentary basins along the eastern coast (including the Raven project site), low-head hydroelectric 
development and industrial cogeneration (Government of BC, 2000 as detailed in AMEC, 2009). 

Infrastructure appears to be sufficient for development of a mine, including roads, rail, water, and power 
transmission. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   5.3

5.5 Physiography 

The topography of the area is characterized by gently rolling hills to flat-lying areas between the Beaufort 
Mountains to the west and the coastal plain to the east.  Linear northwest-trending ridges interspersed 
with parallel, flat, occasionally swampy areas define the hummocky landscape.  The ridges become more 
prominent with closer proximity to the Beaufort Mountains to the west.  The northwest-southeast trend 
of the ridges gives a "fan" shape to the deposit area, constricting the area to the south where the more 
prominent ridges trend towards the coast and opens up the north in a more expansive peneplain.  The 
total relief over the project area is about 200m extending from a low of approximately 50m to a high of 
250m (Cullingham, 2007). 

The terrain slopes gently from the coastline near Fanny Bay to an undulating, terraced upland in the area 
of the proposed mine facilities site.  Farther upslope, the topography is hummocky to rolling with gentle 
to moderate slopes that comprise the foothills of the Beaufort Range.  Steep bedrock is exposed at higher 
elevations on the flanks and crests of the range (AGRA, 1997a, AMEC, 2009). 

Surface water is present in the immediate area of the Raven project area in the Tsable River cutting 
through the center of the property, Hindoo Creek across the north end of the property, and Cowie, 
Cougar-Smith, and Wilfred Creeks across the south half of the property.  All drainage is to the east into 
Baynes Sound (AMEC, 2009). 

Groundwater at the project site has not been developed for drinking, irrigation, or industrial uses (AMEC, 
2009).

6.0 HISTORY 

The Raven project area (Tsable River Coalfield) has a long history of exploration and mining development 
dating back to the late 1800s. 

6.1 Early Mining History 

Coal mining on Vancouver Island began in 1849 when the Hudson's Bay Company sent a small group of 
miners to Fort Rupert on the northeast coast to mine a thin seam on Suquash Creek.  When more 
promising prospects further south at Nanaimo were discovered, the Suquash Mine was closed and the 
Hudson's Bay Company moved its miners to Nanaimo, where it operated mines for a decade under the 
name of the Nanaimo Coal Company.  In 1862, the Hudson's Bay Company sold the coal rights to James 
Nichol, who formed the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company.  This company continued to operate 
the Nanaimo mines until 1902, when it was purchased by Western Fuel Company of California.  Western 
Fuel operated the mines under various corporate names until 1928, when the company was sold to 
Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. (Gardner, 1999). 

 In 1873, Robert Dunsmuir's newly formed Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Company (E&N) was granted 
around three quarters of a million hectares of land covering most of the eastern coastal lowlands of the 
Island, in return for the construction of the railway from Esquimalt dry-docks to the City of Nanaimo.  
This E&N Land Grant stretched from the southern tip of the Island to Campbell River near the north end, 
and included both surface and subsurface rights, including mineral rights with the exception of gold and 
silver.  Dunsmuir, an up-and-coming coalmine investor with operations between Nanaimo and Victoria, 
with this one act effectively took control of 95 percent of the coal measures in the eastern lowlands as 
well as fireclay, gravels, and other minerals (Gardner, 1999).  The remaining 5 percent of the coal 
measures were controlled by other coal mining companies who had been granted fee-simple rights prior 
to Dunsmuir's grant of the railway belt.  Among these were the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land 
Company (Gardner, 1999). 

In 1905, Dunsmuir's company, now run by his son James, sold all the E&N assets except for title to the 
coal, gravel, and fireclay, to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company Ltd.   Five years later, Dunsmuir sold 
all of the coalmines and associated rights to the Canadian Northern Railways, who reorganized the 
properties under the name of Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd.  (later, Canadian Collieries Resources 
Ltd.).  Canadian Collieries continued to operate the mines in the Nanaimo and Comox coal basins until 
1960 (Gardner, 1999). 

The Comox Basin area has a history of coal mining centered around Cumberland 20 km to the north of 
the Raven project area.  The only mine in the actual project area was the Baynes Sound Mine which 
opened in 1869, (main production between 1875 and 1877), and was the earliest mine in the Comox 
Basin, according to Gardner (1999).  The actual location of Baynes Sound Mine was alluded to in reports 
and documents but was not found on any maps.  During field mapping and prospecting in 2006, what is 
believed to be the Baynes Sound Mine was located on the north bank of the Tsable River (Figure 4-1).  



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   6.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Two adits and considerable tonnes of coal and coal refuse were found in piles nearby.  The mine 
operated for only a short time before economic conditions forced its shutdown.  An unknown quantity of 
coal was removed from the mine prior to its closing (Cullingham, 2007).   

Shortly after the Baynes Sound Mine opened, the first of the mines around Cumberland were also 
opened, under the ownership of Union Collieries.  Union Collieries was underfunded and struggled until it 
was purchased by Robert Dunsmuir and Sons Ltd. in 1883.  Approximately 14.5mt of coal were mined in 
the Cumberland area by Dunsmuir, then Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd. between 1888 and 1955.  
Eight mines (No. 1 through No. 8) worked three thick coal seams (No. 1, No. 2, and No. 4) in the Comox 
Formation.  Union Bay, on the Island's east shore just off the northern tip of Denman Island, became the 
shipping and bunkering terminal for the area.  A coal prep plant that served all of the mines in the vicinity 
was also located there.  (Gardner, 1999) 

The only other mine in the immediate vicinity of the Raven project area was the Tsable River Mine to the 
west of the project area on the north bank of the Tsable River.  The Tsable River Mine, from which 
approximately 2.0mt of coal were extracted, was operated from 1949 – 1966 (Cullingham, 2007).  
Although the seam was substantially thicker than seams further north in the Cumberland area mines, roof 
water, faulting on both a large and small scale and high sulfur content of the coal contributed to the 
demise of the mine (Gardner, 1999).  The authors have visited this abandoned mine site. 

In the early 1960s, all the assets of the old Wellington Colliery Company Ltd. (formerly Canadian 
Collieries Resources) were sold to American Plywood Company (the forerunner of Weldwood of Canada 
Limited) primarily for the extensive forest land holdings.  Likewise, in the late 1960s, the E&N transferred 
all its mineral rights in the E&N Land Grant to PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd.  In 2003, Weldwood through 
name change became West Fraser. 

6.2 Current Ownership 

The Comox Joint Venture (CJV) was formed in February 2009 for the purpose of exploring and 
developing jointly owned coal and mineral rights in the Comox Basin.  The Raven coal property mineral 
rights are owned by the CJV and were acquired by the three companies from West Fraser in November, 
2008.  The CJV comprises three companies:  CCC (60 percent); I-Comox Coal Inc (ICC), a subsidiary of 
Itochu Corporation (20 percent); and LG International Investments (Canada) Ltd. (LGI) (20 percent).  
CCC has been nominated the manager of the CJV (AMEC, 2009; Cullingham, 2010; Tapics, 2010). 

CCC is a 100-percent subsidiary of Compliance Energy Corporation (CEC), a publicly traded company on 
the TSX Venture Exchange, under the symbol CEC.  CEC is a Canadian company based in Vancouver, 
B.C., with interests in mining (AMEC, 2009).  CEC developed and has operated the Basin Coal Mine near 
Princeton, B.C.  This mine is currently under care and maintenance (Tapics, 2010).

7.0  GEOLOGICAL SETTING 

The Tsable River Coalfield has a northeast regional dip, complicated by broad folds, reverse and thrust 
faults, and normal faults.  The regional dip is 10 to 15 degrees northeast with dips locally steepening to 
25 to 26 degrees, especially on the western edge of the basin.  Generally, deformation is more intense 
along the western margin of the basin where the erosional edge of the coal measures about the 
underlying uplifted volcanics forming the Beaufort Mountains (Cullingham, 2010a). 

The coal-bearing rocks at Raven are Upper Cretaceous in age, contained within the Nanaimo Group, 
which outcrops over large areas on the eastern side of Vancouver Island.  The main economic coals of 
the Comox Basin occur in the lowermost Comox Formation.   

7.1 Coal Occurrences 

Depositional sequences are well-detailed in the literature, and the authors have relied extensively on the 
compilation of this work by Gardner (2001) and Cullingham (2007) to define the stratigraphy and 
structural setting of the Comox Coal Basin.  Table 7-1 (from Cullingham, 2007) shows the typical 
lithologic assemblages applied to the basin. 

As shown in Figure 7-1, the significant assemblage over the Raven Project is the Comox Formation, 
although the Trent River Formation occurs over the eastern area of the property.  The Comox Formation 
was deposited unconformably on basalts, gabbros and volcanic breccias of the Triassic Karmutsen 
Formation.  The Triassic volcanics form an irregular basement topography, which strongly influenced the 
deposition of the coal-bearing sediments, causing relatively rapid facies changes and variable coal 
thicknesses (Cullingham, 2007 and Gardner, 2001). 

The Comox Formation is subdivided into three Members (see Table 7-1) from youngest to oldest as 
follows: 

 Dunsmuir Member 
 Cumberland Member 
 Benson Member 

 
The Dunsmuir Member consists of sandstone, conglomerates, with minor shales and thin coals.   

The Cumberland Member is the main coal-bearing member, comprising siltstone, shale, and the only 
economically significant coal on the Raven property.  The Benson Member comprises coarse sediments, 
siltstones to conglomerates, and occurs over a relatively restricted areal extent.  Thickness of this 
member is reported as varying up to 200 m (Cullingham, 2007 and Gardner, 2001). 

The Comox Formation is locally intruded with sills and dikes, although none have been reported in the 
Raven project area nor have any been observed (Cullingham, 2007).

Up to 10 coal seams have been described in the Comox Basin, although most literature refers to four or 
five seam zones.  The thickest most persistent and economic coals occur in the Cumberland Member, 
usually within the 1 and the 3 Seam zones.  Individual coals are generally thin to medium thickness, 
rarely exceeding 3 m.  Aggregate coal zone thickness varies from 2 to 8 m with occasional outliers 
greater than 8 m (Cullingham, 2007).  Generalized stratigraphy with current seam nomenclature for 
Raven is illustrated in Figure 7-1.  

Continuity of the Comox Formation including coal zones is established from drilling and seismic data.  
Despite variability within and between the coal zones, the coal zones are relatively persistent throughout 
the deposit area.  Five coal zones have been identified in the Raven project area, two of which are 
considered thick enough and persistent enough to be considered potentially economic.  As is detailed in 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   7.4 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Section 17, nearly 94 percent of the resources defined for the Raven project area occur in these two 
seam zones.  Therefore, although other thin and frequently discontinuous seams were identified and 
modeled, the focus of this report is on the two main seam zones. 

Coal zone 1 is the lowest zone, with up to five identified plies (Seams 135, 140, 145, 150, 160) 
comprising the zone , Seam 150 the primary ply, and each ply composed of multiple interlaminated coal 
and non-coal layers.  Coal zone 1 was deposited between zero and 30 m above the volcanics.  Coal zone 
1 is composed of many thin coals, bony coals, coaly mudstones, carbonaceous mudstones, mudstones, 
and siltstones.  Despite the variability in thickness and composition, Seam 150 conforms to the thickness 
and coal-to-rock ratio defining resources over much of the property. (Cullingham, 2010a) 

Coal zone 3 is similar to zone 1 with up to three identified plies (Seams 330, 340, and 360).  Seam 360 is 
the primary ply over most of the project area, although 340L is primary in the northeast where the Lower 
Plate occurs.   Coal zone 3 is just as persistent as zone 1, but is much more variable in thickness and 
coal-to-rock ratio, and therefore will probably be considered less attractive to mine. 

Figures 7-2a, 7-2b, and 7-2c show a north-south section roughly along strike, with seam correlations and 
structure.  Figures 7-3a and 7-3b show a corresponding west-east cross-section perpendicular to strike.  
Individual coal zones typically contain a number of discrete coal seams separated by rock partings of 
highly variable thickness and extent.  As such, modeling efforts have required reorganization of these 
coal zones into subseams as defined by separable parting constraints.  Thus, Seam 3 becomes Seams 
340 and 360.   

For ease in digital modeling, seam nomenclature has been modified to accommodate current 
interpretation of the data that includes a high angle reverse fault through the northeast part of the Raven 
area (see Section 7.2).  Seams are named according to the following convention: 

 Seams of the Upper Plate occur in the overlying block and are named as described above:  150, 340, 
360, etc.  
 

 Seams of the Lower Plate occur in the underlying block and have an "L" appended to their respective 
seam names:  150L, 340L, 360L, etc. 

Surficial material over the Raven property varies in thickness from less than 2 m in the west, to over 100 
m in the south and is composed of glacial till or glacio-fluvial deposits of sand and gravel.  Sand and 
gravel deposits are especially prevalent in the south and southeast areas of the project area and mask 
the underlying bedrock.  Surface exposures of Comox Formation rocks are limited to creek and river 
valleys and occasional road cuts (Gardner, 2001 and Cullingham, 2007).

Coalfield structure depicted by Cathyl-Bickford (1998) has been reviewed by the authors.  Some of the 
faults have been located on the property; others have been inferred from drilling, aerial photography, 
and seismic work. (Cullingham, 2007)  Current data indicate a high-angle reverse fault that influences the 
distribution of coal at Raven.  This interpretation divides Raven into two distinct resource blocks:  Upper 
Plate (overlying) and Lower Plate (underlying).   

The rocks of the Upper Plate have been faulted northeast-ward, up and over the Lower Plate.  The 
reverse fault interpretation indicates the Lower Plate contains a repeat of the Upper Plate coal seams.  
Seismic interpretation from 2006 (Berkman, 2006), suggests that the faulting scenario may instead be 
that of a low-angle thrust fault.  Current data support this theory but also the more simple interpretation 
of a high-angle reverse fault, which results in less overlap of the rocks.  However, if the seismic 
interpretation is correct, the coal series may occur extensively across the northern part of the property in 
the Lower Plate.  To confirm this, a series of holes would need to be drilled through the Comox 
Formation, then through perhaps another 200 to 300 meters of underlying volcanics to see if the Comox 
Formation is then repeated.  It is suspected that, given the gas that occurs in the Comox coals and the 
complete seal the volcanics would form above this gas, that penetration of the lower volcanics/Comox 
boundary could potentially release considerable amounts of gas.   

7.3 Geotechnical Data  

Geotechnical testing is in progress at this time by Agapito Associates, Inc. out of Grand Junction, 
Colorado.  Samples from nine holes were collected during the 2009 drilling program.  

7.4 Groundwater Regime 

Piezometer installation and pump testing were carried out in six holes during the 2009 drilling program by 
AMEC Earth and Environmental, out of Burnaby, British Columbia.  Groundwater testing and analytical 
work is currently in progress.

8.0  DEPOSIT TYPES 

Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) Paper 88-21 is a reference for coal deposits as specified in NI 43-101. 
Per that reference, coal deposits must be classified by both "Geology Type," a definition of the amount of 
geological complexity, and by "Deposit Type," a categorization of the extraction method best-suited to 
the coal deposit.  For coal deposits this is an important concept since the classification of a coal deposit 
as a particular type determines the range limiting criteria that may be applied during the estimation of 
Reserves and Resources. 

The classification of a coal deposit by Geology Type determines the approach to be used for 
resource/reserve estimation, and defines the confidence that can be placed in extrapolation of data 
values at a specific distance from a particular point of reference such as a drill hole.  Geology Type is 
unique among international coal reserve classification systems because it is designed to accommodate 
differences in the degree of tectonic deformation of various coal deposits in Canada.  Four classes are 
provided for that range.  The coals of the Comox Basin, inclusive of the Raven project area, are of Late 
Cretaceous age and, although not specified in the GSC Paper 88-21, are found in a similar geologic 
setting as the Lower Cretaceous coals found in the Obed, Bullmoose, and McLeod River deposits in British 
Columbia and Alberta referenced in GSC Paper 88-21 as "moderate" deposits.   

The authors have applied the classification scheme of GSC Paper 88-21 to the Raven coal deposits on 
Vancouver Island.  The Raven deposit has been subjected to a moderate degree of tectonic deformation 
including north-south trending reverse and normal faulting.  In spite of this structural deformation, the 
coal measures are relatively intact and are characterized by only moderate dip.  Except on the steeper 
flanks of the coalfield to the west and in the immediate vicinity of some of the faults, coal seams typically 
dip 10° to 15º.  Such continuity and dip would be classified as "Moderate."  However, the Raven area 
contains a number of faults with minor to significant offset, which would place this area in the "Complex" 
category.  Therefore, the Geology Type for the Raven area falls somewhere between "Moderate" and 
"Complex."  Cullingham (2007) determined the property to be "Moderate, bordering on Complex," and 
the authors agree with this classification. 

"Deposit Type," as defined in GSC Paper 88-21, refers to the extraction method most suited to the coal 
deposit:  Surface, Underground, Non-conventional, and Sterilized.  The Raven deposit is considered to be 
a potential "Underground" mineable deposit.

9.0 MINERALIZATION  

The Comox Basin coals are classified as high-volatile A and B bituminous by ASTM Standard D388.  
Raven coals have been classified as high-volatile A bituminous.  Unconsolidated surface material ranges 
from 0m at outcrop to 103.6 meters.    

Five distinct coal zones, with a total of 12 specific subseams (10 of which are also identified in the Lower 
Plate and therefore replicated with an "L" appended to the seam name) are recognized and included in 
the geological model.  However, as discussed in Section 7, as nearly 94 percent of the defined resources 
occur in the two main seam zones, the focus of this report is on those zones.  Table 9-1 summarizes 
seam thickness and number of occurrences used in the current (March 2010) digital geological model.  
Thicknesses reported are based on drill intercepts and represent apparent thickness.  Main seams are 
bolded.

10.0 EXPLORATION  

Pre-1900:  Presumably a certain amount of undocumented prospecting (mapping, trenching) resulted in 
the development of the Baynes Sound Mine in the 1860s.  However, no pre-1900 data have been found 
to date. 

Pre-1960:  Extensive drilling was done in the area by Canadian Collieries/Dunsmuir Collieries during the 
period 1905 – 1957, when 85 holes were drilled in the vicinity of the project area.  Drillers' and/or 
geologists' logs are available for these holes and were included in Curcio's study of the coal mining 
potential of the Comox Basin (Curcio, 1975).  

This early drilling outlined a potential resource base south of the Tsable River and guided the next stage 
of exploration in 1975.  A test adit was constructed along the banks of Cowie Creek during this phase.  
Due to the downturn in coal demand following the worldwide switch to petroleum and petroleum 
derivatives no further work was done until 1975 (Cullingham, 2007). 

1975:  In 1973, the B.C. government enacted a resource land tax causing Weldwood to hire coal 
consultant Michele Curcio to undertake a coal resource evaluation study in order to determine what fee 
simple lands Weldwood could relinquish to the crown and reduce the resource land tax liability.  Curcio 
carried out a regional drilling program including 16 drill holes in the vicinity of the current project area in 
order to verify Canadian Collieries drilling and to acquire sufficient geological data on the coal resource to 
define the resource.   

The Tsable River area south of the river was again earmarked as a significant coal deposit.  Results of 
Curcio's exploration are contained in a few reports reviewed by Cullingham (2007).  The authors have 
been able to review only the 1975 report.  As a result of Curcio's work, Weldwood surrendered 670,000 
ha to the Crown, leaving Weldwood with 47,750 ha.  Additional lands were later surrendered, netting 
Weldwood's fee-simple holdings to 37,600ha (Gardner, 1999). 

1990-1991:  No further exploratory work was done until 1990 when Consolidated Brinco acquired an 
option from Weldwood to explore for coal in the southern Comox Basin and specifically in the Tsable 
River coalfield.  Consolidated Brinco drilled/cored 20 holes south of the Tsable River to further delineate 
an area previously drilled by Canadian Collieries (Gardner, 2001).   

In addition to drilling, Brinco carried out refractive seismic, VLF-EM and mapping in the area south of the 
Tsable River and outlined what it considered a mineable resource (Cullingham, 2007).  Results of this 
work were documented in two reports (Parkes, 1991 and Butterworth, 1991).  Both reports have been 
reviewed by the authors of this report. 

1996-1997:  In 1991, Consolidated Brinco merged with Hillsborough Resources Limited, and in 1996-
1997 Hillsborough drilled 27 holes east of the main area previously drilled in order to extend resources 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   10.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

downdip, and also drilled north of the Tsable River, where drilling up until then had been quite sparse.  
(Gardner, 2001)   

In addition to drilling, Hillsborough carried out reflective seismic over the Tsable River project, extending 
the area of resources east and north including north of the Tsable River.  Results of this work are detailed 
in a report by Gardner (1997) of GEC, who was hired by Hillsborough to document the 1996 and 1997 
exploration activities (Cullingham, 2007).  This report has been reviewed by Cullingham (2007) and the 
authors, although some of the appendices and attachments (most notably some of the geophysical logs 
of the drilling) were not available.   

2001:  In 1998, Hillsborough made plans to go underground with a test mine near Cowie Creek and 
obtained a mine permit in 1998.  Due to a downturn in coal marketing opportunities, nothing further was 
done until 2001 when Hillsborough re-activated its mine permit and conducted additional drilling for 
groundwater monitoring in the test mine area.  Hillsborough drilled five holes in the Raven area, although 
records regarding downhole lithology, type of rig, or drilling company have not been found.  Information 
from Cullingham indicates these five holes were piezometer holes, and field determination of depth 
indicated relatively shallow holes (approximately 93m total) with piezometers set in surficial material and 
bedrock immediately below the surficial material.  However, the annual B.C. government report for 
activities in 2001 records a total of 880m drilled for these holes (Cullingham, 2009). 

Following completion of these holes, Hillsborough completed an NI 43-101 compliant resource report 
(Gardner, 2001).  The authors have reviewed this report.  Hillsborough did no further work at Raven, and 
relinquished its option with Weldwood in 2002. (Cullingham, 2007) 

2005-2006:  In 2005, CCC optioned the property from West Fraser (formerly Weldwood) and initiated 
additional exploration activities.  In 2006, CCC ran seismic lines to help define structure and basement 
rock, drilled 2,848m to infill the area, and extracted a 13-tonne bulk sample from a surface adit.   

Exploration geology fieldwork included reconnaissance mapping, geologist descriptions of drill hole 
cuttings and core, geotechnical data field logs, and database development.  Field activities were either 
performed directly by Owen Cullingham of ORC or by contract rig geologists supervised by Cullingham.   

A high-resolution seismic reflection program was conducted at the Raven property in 2006 (Berkman, 
2006).  A series of seven parallel lines over approximately 21 line kilometres were generated by Emerald 
Exploration Consultants (EMEX, 2006).  The objective of the program was to facilitate interpretation and 
mapping geological structures such as folds and faults, and the continuity, depth, and thickness of coal 
seams.  Interpretation of the seismic reflections was accomplished through correlation to drill holes by 
comparing reflection characteristics against synthetic seismograms developed from sonic and density logs 
run in approximately 50 drill holes from the 1990-1991, 1996-1997, and 2006 drilling programs.  
Conclusions drawn by Dr. Ernest Berkman (2006) of EMEX are as follows: 

 The reflectors are interpreted to be caused by coal/rock interfaces with reflections from 
rock/rock interfaces being infrequent.  The data indicates the presence of thick seam 3 and 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   10.3 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

seam 1 coal, their depth, configuration, and faulting with beds dipping regionally to the 
northeast.  Erosional surfaces and lithologic changes related to thickening, thinning, and 
variations in the coal zone are present.  The presence of several sonic logs makes correlation 
of the seismic reflectors to specific coal seams clear cut in those areas and more conjectural 
in others.  Based upon all the available seismic data in the Raven property, there is evidence 
for complex thrust faults in the coal zone in some areas while other areas are virtually free of 
faulting. 

 The presence of shallow coal amenable to strip mining is noted.  The seismic data is clear cut 
and easily interpretable.  It is felt that mining should be initiated.  The seismic data shows 
thick coal seams, their depth, configuration, and thickness variations, faults where present, 
and stratigraphic features.  It should be used to guide the coal mining in these areas. 

Bulk sampling was also undertaken in 2006, with the site selection based on knowledge of Seam 1 
subcrop and drill hole information.  The adit was advanced 6.5m until it was free from oxidation.  Sodium 
hydroxide and coke button field testing were done to monitor when the adit had advanced through the 
oxidized zone into hard, non-oxidized coal.  A 13-tonne bulk sample was extracted from a crosscut in the 
adit.  Sixteen 1-meter bulk bags were filled with coal extracted from what was believed to be a 
representative minable section, including out-of-seam dilution.  The mineable section has a stratigraphic 
thickness of 2.0m at the sample point (Cullingham, 2007).  Washability analysis and bulk washing were 
completed by Hazen Research in Golden, Colorado.   

Results of this 2005 and 2006 work were filed in an NI 43-101 Technical Report (Cullingham, 2007). 

2009:  Exploration by CCC continued in 2009 with the emphasis on delineating underground resource 
potential.  A total of 41 new holes were drilled and three holes begun during the 2006 program were 
completed.  (An additional approximately 300m were drilled to set casing for six more holes for which 
budget constraints prevented completion.  As these holes were not completed through the coal 
measures, they were not included in the model nor included in total meterage tallies.)  All completed 
holes were targeted for coal quality studies, although a few holes were not sampled due to core recovery 
issues and/or thin seams.  Five holes were selected for seam gas content studies (to be used in mine 
safety and ventilation planning), nine holes for geotechnical studies, and six holes for hydrogeology 
studies.   

Birtley Coal and Mineral Testing (coal quality), David E. Pearson & Associates, Ltd. (petrography), and 
SGS Laboratories (clean-coal carbonization studies) were selected as the labs to perform coal quality 
testing.  Petro-Logic Services, Ltd. carried out the seam gas content studies.  Geotechnical work was 
performed by Agapito Associates, Inc.  Hydrogeology work was carried out by AMEC Earth and 
Environmental.  Work is in progress for coal quality, seam gas content, geotechnical, and hydrogeology 
studies.   

Additionally, AMEC carried out detailed research survey of the project and its potential affect on the 
environment (AMEC, 2009).

Digital topography data for the Raven project area was acquired via LIDAR technology, conducted by 
Aero Geometrics out of Vancouver, B.C.  The topographic surface was incorporated into the current 
geologic model. 

ORC and contract rig geologists provided geologic data acquisition services. 

Summary:  To summarize:  This current Technical Report utilizes data collected at the Raven property 
through 2009 by the following entities: 

 Canadian/Dunsmuir Collieries (1905 – 1957) 
 Curcio/Weldwood (1975) 
 Consolidated Brinco (lessee)//Weldwood (lessor)  (1990-91)  
 Hillsborough-Brinco (lessee)/Weldwood (lessor) (1996-97) 
 CCC (lessee)/West Fraser (lessor) (2005 – 2007) 
 CCC/CJV (2008 – present) 

 

Geological surface mapping has been conducted at various times during the history of the region.  The 
most current surface map (Cullingham, 2009a) has been derived from mapping done by Michele Curcio 
circa 1975, by Steve Gardner and Gwyneth Cathyl-Bickford in the 1990's, and by CCC staff during the 
2009 exploration program. The Gardner and Cathyl-Bickford maps were obtained from the B.C. Ministry 
of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (Gardner, 1999 and Cathyl-Bickford, 1998).

11.0 DRILLING 

Pre-1900:  No pre-1900 drilling data are available.       

Pre-1960:  Extensive drilling was done in the region by Canadian Collieries/Dunsmuir Collieries during 
the period 1905 – 1957, when 85 holes were drilled, using rotary drilling or coring methods.  Of these 85 
holes, 67 are located within the Raven project area.  Although the drilling company and type of rig are 
unknown, drillers' and/or geologists' logs are available for these holes and were included in Curcio's study 
of the coal mining potential of the Comox Basin (Curcio, 1975).  Cathyl-Bickford (1988) later entered 
these drill holes into a database on behalf of the BC Ministry of Mines and Petroleum Resources and 
located them by NAD 83 coordinates.  Cullingham (2009) used the government database to locate most 
of these holes, with some modifications.  Aerial photographs, historical records, and ground "sleuthing" 
were used to verify drill sites.  Questionable drill hole locations (either due to not fitting the model or 
topography) were removed from the database or relocated – the latter, only where a high degree of 
confidence exists to justify relocating the drill hole.  The authors, after site visits to some of these drill 
holes, have accepted the descriptive geology and coordinates as presented. 

1975:  In 1975, Michele Curcio carried out a regional drilling program including 16 drill holes with 12 
holes located in the vicinity of the Raven project area.  Six of these holes were drilled south of Cougar-
Smith Creek and were either abandoned in overburden or drilled into volcanics below the overburden.  
The drilling company and type of rig are unknown.  Geologists' logs are available for all drill holes and 
geophysical logs are available for all drill holes intersecting the Comox Formation seams.  Cullingham 
(2007) determined the locations of these drill holes from historical records and verified from the 
government database, aerial photographs, and ground search.  Drill holes were located along existing 
access routes available at the time of drilling and thus were relatively easily identified with the 
appropriate year's aerial photographs (Cullingham, 2009).  Coal quality analyses are available for two drill 
holes and have been included in this study. 

1990-1991: No further exploratory work was done until Consolidated Brinco drilled/cored 20 holes south 
of the Tsable River in 1990-1991 to further delineate an area previously drilled by Canadian Collieries 
(Gardner, 2001).  These were drilled by JT Thomas Drilling, Ltd. out of Smithers, B.C., with an Acker 
diamond drill equipped to recover conventional N size (5.08cm) core (Gardner, 2001).    The standard 
coal suite of geophysical logs (gamma, density, resistivity, caliper) were run on all holes.  Several were 
logged with deviation and dipmeter tools.  Drillers' and geologists' logs and geophysical logs are available 
for all holes and have been reviewed and interpreted by Cullingham in 2007 and by the authors of this 
report. 

Drill hole spacing of the Canadian Collieries/Weldwood/Brinco drilling through 1991 averages 300m for 
the area between the Tsable River and Cowie Creek and between the western edge of the Comox 
Formation east for a distance of about 1,200m (Cullingham, 2007). 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   11.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

1996-1997:  In 1996-97, after the Consolidated Brinco/Hillsborough Resources merger, Hillsborough 
drilled 27 holes east of the main area previously drilled in order to extend resources downdip, and also 
drilled north of the Tsable River, where drilling, up until then had been quite sparse (Gardner, 2001).  
Both rotary and spot coring were done by HiRate Drilling out of Stettler, Alberta.  A combination of air 
and drilling mud were used as necessary, recovering a modified P size (76mm) core.  (Gardner, 2001)  
Drillers' logs and geologists' logs are available for all holes.  Although the standard coal suite of 
geophysical logs were run on all holes, not all logs have been located to date.  However, Gardner (2001) 
published portions of the relevant logs in his Technical Report, detailing the logs where they penetrate 
each main seam.  All available data were reviewed and interpreted by Cullingham in 2007 and again by 
the authors of this report. 

Drill hole spacing through the 1997 averaged around 300m south of the Tsable River and about 600m 
north of the river (Cullingham, 2007). 

2001:  In 2001, Hillsborough completed five additional holes for groundwater monitoring in the test mine 
area.  Records regarding downhole lithology, type of rig, or drilling company have not been found.  
Information from Cullingham indicates these five holes were piezometer holes, and field determination of 
depth indicated piezometers were established at relatively shallow depths (approximately 93m total) into 
the surficial material and bedrock immediately below the surficial material.  The annual B.C. government 
report for activities in 2001 records a total of 880m drilled for these holes (Cullingham, 2009). 

2006:  In 2006, CEC drilled 2848 m to begin to infill the area.  The 2006 CCC exploration program drilled 
or partially drilled 12 boreholes in the Raven project area.  (Three holes were drilled to or near core 
point, but completion through the coal series was delayed until the 2009 exploration program.)  The 
drilling was done by Drillwell Enterprises Ltd. out of Duncan, Vancouver Island, using a rotary core truck-
mounted drill.  The holes initially were rotary hammered to core point using air followed by coring also 
using air.  Poor core recovery and drilling difficulties plagued the first five holes and a decision was made 
to drill with mud, which improved drill hole stability and core recovery significantly.  Starting with the 
sixth hole, a dual rotary drill equipped with a drill-through downhole air hammer was used to case holes 
through the overburden and to drill ahead to core point.  The dual rotary rig was brought in primarily to 
set casing through thick glacial deposits and alluvial sands and gravels and was extremely successful.  
Once core point had been reached the truck-mounted drill equipped to core was moved onto the drill 
hole to complete the drilling (Cullingham, 2007 and 2009). 

Drill holes were geophysically logged with gamma, neutron, resistivity, density, caliper, and sonic tools.  
Downhole deviation surveys were run on all holes and dipmeter surveys on some holes as a check on 
measured core dips.  It should be noted that due to stability problems, one hole (RAV06-04) was partially 
logged and another (RAV06-05) was not logged at all.   All drill holes were vertical holes, and deviation 
surveys run in select holes showed minimum deviation (Cullingham, 2007 and 2009).  Cullingham's 
opinion was that the deviation is insignificant to affect the interpretation.  The authors concur with this 
opinion. 

 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   11.3 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

2009:  Exploration by CCC continued in 2009 with the emphasis on delineating underground resource 
potential.  A total of 41 new holes were drilled and three holes from 2006 were completed.  Total 
meterage for the 41+3 completed holes is 9834.  In addition to that, six hole locations had surface casing 
set, adding another 306 meters, although these holes were not completed through the coal measures 
during the 2009 program and are therefore not included in the model database.  Three drilling companies 
were employed:  Drillwell Enterprises Ltd. out of Duncan, Vancouver Island, B.C., Alliance Drilling Ltd. out 
of Victoria, Vancouver Island, B.C., and Peak Drilling Ltd. out of Courtenay, Vancouver Island.   

Drillwell provided a rotary core rig equipped to hammer-drill with air, tricone with fluids, and split-tube 
core drilling to recover 3-inch core.  Drillwell also provided a 6-inch core barrel to recover 5-7/8-inch large 
diameter core for coal quality, washability testing, and carbonization testing.  Drillwell also provided a 
dual rotary drill equipped with a drill-through downhole air hammer used to case holes through the 
overburden and to drill ahead to core point.  Drillwell completed all the hydrogeological holes, installed 
piezometers, and performed pump tests under the direction of AMEC personnel (Cullingham, 2009 and 
2010). 

Alliance provided a rotary core drill equipped to drill with downhole hammer, tricone, and split-tube 
coring system, recovering 3-inch size core (Cullingham, 2009 and 2010). 

Peak provided a hydraulic skid diamond drill equipped with a solid-tube Longyear coring system, 
recovering HQ size core (Cullingham, 2009 and 2010). 

Five of the holes were targeted for groundwater monitoring and had piezometers installed and one other 
was twinned to enable pumping tests for transmissivity testing.  Hydrogeological studies were carried out 
AMEC (Cullingham, 2009 and 2010). 

Nine holes were targeted for sampling for geotechnical testing.  (Cullingham, 2009 and 2010) 
Geotechnical testing was carried out by Agapito Associates, Inc. of Grand Junction, Colorado.  This work 
is in progress. 

Five holes were targeted for sampling coal for in-seam gas quantity and compositional analyses to be 
used for safety and ventilation design of the underground mining (Cullingham, 2009 and 2010).  Gas 
testing was carried out by Petro-Logic, Inc.  This work is in progress. 

Four holes were targeted for large-diameter core sampling in order to create a bulk sample for Seam 150 
and Seam 360 (Cullingham, 2009 and 2010).  Bulk sample washing and clean-coal sample preparation 
was carried out by Birtley Coal and Minerals Testing in Calgary, Alberta (a division of GWIL Industries).  
Those clean-coal samples were shipped to SGS Laboratories in Beckley, West Virginia for carbonization 
studies.   

Drill holes were geophysically logged by Weatherford International Ltd., out of Houston, Texas, with 
gamma, density, caliper, resistivity, and downhole deviation run on all holes while neutron, sonic, 
acoustic televiewer, dipmeter (to check on measured core dips), and temperature logs run on select

holes.  Most drill holes were vertical or near-vertical with deviation ranging from 0 to 35m from vertical 
(Cullingham, 2009, and Weatherford 2009 logs).  Cullingham's opinion was that the deviation would not 
affect interpretation.  The authors concur with this opinion. 

The 2009 holes were all successfully drilled and logged, although one hole (RAV-09-021) encountered 
methane gas and had to be offset 10m and re-drilled (RAV-09-029) prior to logging.  Both holes were 
geophysically logged. 

Drilling was planned as infill to the existing drill holes, and has resulted in net spacing of approximately 
150m in the central part of the property, and 300m in the northern and southern thirds.   

ORC and contract rig geologists provided geologic data acquisition services.

Not all holes in or immediately nearby the project area were utilized in this current resource evaluation.  
Problems with reliability of location, elevation, downhole lithology, or lack of downhole data required 
elimination of a number of earlier holes.  The new detailed LIDAR digital topography was incorporated 
into the geologic model, and holes with surface elevation varying more than 15 m from the LIDAR 
surface were also considered to be unreliable.  Figure 11-1 details a location map showing the drill holes 
used in this project evaluation and the ones eliminated due to location reliability issues. 

All drilling completed through December, 2009 within or immediately nearby CCC's Raven property, 
whether used in the digital geological model or not, includes a total of 34,576 m drilled in 189 exploration 
holes.  Of these, 41 were drilled in 2009, plus three additional 2006 holes that were completed from core 
point to total depth in 2009.  Four of the 2009 holes were twins of previous holes, cored with a large 
diameter bit in order to provide bulk samples for washabiltiy and carbonization testing.  Two holes, also 
twins of existing holes, were rotary holes completed for hydrological testing.  Thirty-nine of the 2009 
holes are coreholes.  

Table 11-2 details all drilling and other exploration activities completed in the general vicinity of the 
project area to date, including holes not located within the project boundaries.  Core recovery in all 
programs has been quite variable, ranging from zero to 100 percent.  Table 11-3 gives a distribution of 
core recovery by seam for those drill holes where sampling and analyses were done.  Although these 
samples include two holes with quite poor recovery, in general, recovery in the 2009 holes was above 80 
percent.

12.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 

Core drilling was utilized in 2009 to collect representative samples of Raven coal seams, observe 
structural details, and to measure more accurately the depths of lithologic contacts.  A total of 39 new 
coreholes were drilled out of 41 total.  Three holes drilled to core point in 2006 were completed in 2009.   

For the 2009 coreholes, casing was set for each hole; each hole was then rotary or hammer drilled to 
core point (Drillwell and Alliance) or cored from surface (Peak), followed by coring to completion (either 
with the same rig or a separate core rig).   All coring completed during the 2009 drill program was 
performed under ORC supervision.   

Core was retrieved, logged, and sealed according to ORC sampling protocols established in 2006 
(Cullingham, 2009b).  Each core run was measured for total core recovered versus total core cut.  Coal 
showing distinct lithologic variation was sampled separately, as were partings between 0.05 and 0.30m.  
Partings greater than 0.30m were not sampled.  Partings less than 0.05m were included with the coal 
sample.  Otherwise, coal intervals with a uniform appearance were bagged in increments not exceeding 
1.0 m.  Roof and floor samples were taken for Seams 150, 340, and 360, as well as any other seams 
where the intersected thickness was considered potentially minable.  Roof and floor samples were 
typically taken of the 0.1 m interval immediately above or below a coal seam.  Samples were 
photographed, described, and placed in plastic bags along with a sample tag.  The bags were sealed with 
plastic tape to prevent moisture or volatile loss, and placed into plastic tubs for shipping (Cullingham, 
2010). 

The four large-diameter holes were used to create bulk samples which were sent first to Birtley for 
washing and preparation of bulk clean coal samples, then sent on to SGS Beckley in West Virginia for 
clean-coal carbonization testing.  Two holes (RAV-09-036 and -037) were twins of RAV-09-014 and 
targeted the Seam 3 zone (Seam 360).  The other two holes (RAV-09-038 and 039) were twins of RAV-
09-011 targeted the Seam 1 zone (Seam 150) (Cullingham, 2009 and 2010). 

Core logging and sampling were performed by contract geologists under ORC supervision.  PAH, through 
on-site visits, has verified data collection and data collection protocols used during the 2009 drilling 
program.  ORC reports that protocols were established by ORC for the 2006 exploration program 
(Cullingham, 2009b), but neither ORC nor PAH are personally aware of the sampling protocols used by 
earlier exploration.  Gardner (2001) reports that Consolidated Brinco staff geologists supervised 
exploration work in the 1990-91 program, and two consulting geologists supervised the Hillsborough 
exploration program during 1996-97. 

Upon completion, drill holes were geophysically logged with a standard coal log suite (gamma, density, 
caliper, resistivity, and downhole deviation).  Selected holes were also logged with neutron, sonic, 
dipmeter, acoustic televiewer, and/or temperature logs.  Lithologies and coal seam thicknesses were 
identified on the logs and compared with cored thicknesses to confirm recovery.  As laboratory analyses 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   12.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

were received, driller's intervals were converted to geophysical log intervals to remain consistent with the 
rest of the data.   

Chip samples from rotary drilling from surface to core point were collected in 1.5 m increments and 
bagged for later examination and logging by the on-site rig geologist.  

Core recovery in the Raven area has been quite variable over the years, with recovery ranging from 0 
percent to 100 percent.  This has proved true for the 2009 drilling program as well.  Although some 
coreholes experienced core loss, the authors are of the opinion that core data are sufficient to detail 
range and average quality and to model quality trends.  PAH is unaware of any drilling, sampling, or 
recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability of the results.

13.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND SECURITY 

Sample preparation and analytical procedures followed by laboratories used for the Raven project are 
specific for coal and conform to the standards established by the American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM). 

Core logging and sample handling was performed by contract geologists under ORC supervision during 
the 2009 drilling program.  Laboratory instructions and chain-of-possession security measures were 
likewise provided by ORC.  Laboratories used were: 

 Agapito Associates, Inc. - geotechnical testing,  

 Birtley Coal and Minerals Testing - coal quality analyses and preparation of bulk clean-coal sample,  

 SGS Laboratories  - clean-coal carbonization testing of the bulk samples,  

 Petro-Logics, Inc. - seam gas content testing,  

 David E. Pearson & Associates, Ltd. - petrography studies on splits of samples prepared by Birtley, 
and  

 AMEC Earth and Environmental, in Burnaby, British Columbia - hydrogeological and geochemical 
testing.   

Normal precautions for security were made for storage and transportation of coal samples.  The on-site 
geologist collected and prepared coal core samples, storing them in sealed plastic bags then in plastic 
tubs at a secured warehouse until ready for shipment.  The samples were shipped directly to the relevant 
laboratory by reputable transport companies.  Confirmatory communications between shipper and 
laboratory were done via e-mail and/or phone.  

13.1 Core Drilling Samples 

Field protocols for handling core samples were established by ORC for the 2006 program (ORC, 2009b) 
and continued during the 2009 drilling program.  They conform to industry standards and are detailed as 
follows: 

Recovered coal zone intervals are sampled using the following criteria and quality control measures:  

 Each core run is measured for total core recovered vs. total core cut.  Core recovery (reported in 
percent) is recorded.  Lost core intervals are recorded and adjusted if necessary after completion of 
the hole, when the geophysical log can be compared with the core log.  



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   13.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

 Core is cleaned of any contaminants with fresh water. 

 All core is photographed and described in detail, including: downhole depth interval, major rock type 
and lithologic description  (including color, grain size, bed spacing and angles, structure, presence of 
minerals, coal lustre, coal cleating, relative hardness), joint and other structural information, Rock 
Quality Designation (RQD), degree of breakage, alteration and weathering, core quality.   

 Coal showing distinct lithologic variation is sampled separately, as are partings over 0.05m in order to 
facilitate later compositing.  Otherwise, coal intervals with a uniform appearance are bagged in 
increments not exceeding 1.0m.   

 Where possible, roof and floor samples are also sampled at 0.1m intervals to characterize the roof 
and floor and to assess the impact of roof and floor dilution on coal quality. 

 All samples that are to be sent to the laboratories are placed in heavy-duty plastic bags with a 
sample tag identifying corehole number, sample identification number, and meterage interval, then 
sealed with tape to prevent excessive moisture and volatile loss.   

 Sample bags are placed in plastic tubs for shipment to Birtley Coal and Minerals Testing for coal 
quality analyses (Cullingham, 2009). 

 Core earmarked for geotechnical testing is quickly described, photographed, and wrapped in plastic, 
and replaced in the core boxes.  The wrapped core is secured with foam and bubble wrap in the core 
boxes to prevent breakage during transport.  Core boxes are shipped to Agapito Associates, Inc. for 
geotechnical testing. 

 Copies of laboratory instructions and the shipment manifest are forwarded to CCC office in 
Vancouver, B.C. 

 All records are compared with contents upon arrival at the accredited laboratory.  To date, there has 
been no loss or compromise of samples during shipment. 

 All unsampled rock core is stored in consecutive core-run order in plywood core boxes. 

 Core boxes are transported from the rig site to a secure warehouse in Courtenay and stored until all 
descriptive log work is completed.   

 Upon completion of all descriptive log work and photography, core box lids are nailed on and are 
labeled with the Box Number and core interval(s) contained within. 

It is noted that in a few instances some indistiguishable partings or shaly zones were not identified during 
core logging and were therefore included with coal samples rather than sampled separately.  They were 
later identified on the geophysical log as being bony or shaly zones in the seam.  In one case (RAV-09-



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   13.3 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

03), Seam 150 occurred in the oxidized zone near the top of the hole, making identification of coal and 
non-coal layers extremely difficult.   

In the authors' opinion, the sampling, preparation, security and analytical procedures conform to industry 
standards and the analyses adequately reflect the purpose for which they were intended.

14.0 DATA VERIFICATION 

Between 1990 and 1997, Gardner of GEC directly managed, supervised, and verified the exploration 
program and data collection from the Raven property.  In 2006, Cullingham of ORC directly managed, 
supervised, and verified the exploration program and data collection from the Raven property.  For the 
2009 exploration program, Cullingham of ORC directly managed and supervised the drilling program and 
data collection, with PAH via on-site visits confirming and verifying data collection and protocols. 

All data collection was done under a defined set of protocols established in 2006 by the QP from ORC.  
Contract site geologists were responsible for the administration of data collection procedures and were 
responsible for reviewing all data.  ORC maintained oversight of data collection throughout the 
exploration program, and the PAH QPs visited these operations and reviewed these procedures. 

Upon completion of a drill hole, the geologic and geophysical logs were reviewed by ORC and then 
posted to an FTP website for download by PAH staff.  All geologic and sampling data were entered and 
maintained in an electronic database.  All mapping was entered and maintained in electronic format on a 
CAD-based system.  Data entry of all geologic data was managed by Cullingham at the project site.  All 
electronic data were forwarded on a routine basis to PAH's office in Denver.   

The 2009 topographic LIDAR data was forwarded in ASCII format by ORC by means of PAH's FTP site.  
PAH loaded those data into Minex and created a topographic grid and contours of the project area to be 
used in geologic modeling.  The data were later verified by comparing these contours with those provided 
by Aero Geometrics, who carried out the LIDAR mapping. 

PAH is an independent geological and engineering consulting company based in Lakewood, Colorado.  
Lynn Sessions, PG, and Lorraine Livingston, CPG, are Associate Senior Geologists with PAH and are the 
QPs for this report.  Livingston and Sessions were not present for prior drilling programs, but have 
verified current protocols through a July, 2009 on-site visit, compared data acquired under the current 
protocols with previous data, and found them generally consistent. 

Information collected prior to PAH's involvement in the Raven project area in 2009 has been supplied to 
PAH by CCC and ORC.  Data collected in 2009 have been verified by PAH through on-site inspection of 
data collection, examination of data collection protocols, examination of chain of possession security 
measures, and confirmation of acceptability of laboratories.  Pre-2009 drilling data have been examined 
by the authors and comparisons made with 2009 data.  Holes with geophysical logs were compared with 
geophysical logs from 2009 holes.  Geologist logs were compared with 2009 geologist logs.  Locations of 
very old holes were often questionable.  Aerial photographs of prior years were helpful in pinning down 
locations, which in many cases could then be found on the ground.  ORC carried out these search 
operations.  PAH was able to see a sample of these old hole locations.  All data used in the creation of 
the geological model and calculation of resources have been determined to be reasonable and accepted 
as reliable by the authors.

16.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND TESTING 

16.1 Regional Quality Characteristics 

Coals in the Comox Coal Basin have been ranked as high volatile B bituminous and high volatile A 
bituminous.  ASTM D388 standard determines coal rank either by Moist-Ash-Free Specific Energy, dry 
Ash-Free Fixed Carbon, or by percent reflectance.  Ryan (1997) details high reflectance values in the 
Tsable River area.  Coals at the Raven project area within the basin have been determined in prior 
exploration programs to be of high volatile A bituminous rank.  ASTM rank for 2009 quality analyses at 
the Raven property, based on BTU and Fixed Carbon values, is determined to be high volatile A 
bituminous rank.  Khan (2006) suggests that Raven coals, because of their high volatile A rank, would 
require blending in order to be considered for use in a blast furnace.  It should be noted, however, that 
steel companies routinely blend coals from various sources for blast furnace feed. 

Detailed analyses from prior years have identified the coals at Raven to be of metallurgical grade.  2009 
composite and washed analyses confirm metallurgical grade. Regionally, the coal is generally high ash 
and variable sulphur.  At Raven, typical raw ash averages 33 percent, ranging from 16 to 73 percent on a 
dry basis.  Incremental and composite raw ash analyses for 2009 range from 17 to 73 percent (dry 
basis), averaging 35 percent.  Sulphur for 2009 ranges on a dry basis from 0.36 to 7.04 percent, 
averaging 1.81 percent.  Inherent (or residual moisture) in Raven coals averages less than 1 percent.  
This summary was reported from the Minex database inclusive of raw seam composites (as received 
basis), or incremental samples (air dried basis) where composites were not available, all converted 
mathematically to dry basis. 

16.2 Raw Coal Quality 

Drilling activities at Raven are summarized in Section 11.  A total of 156 rotary and core exploration holes 
are located in or in the immediate vicinity of the Raven project area and have been determined reliable 
for use in the Raven geological model.  Of this total, 75 coreholes have samples of sufficient recovery 
suitable for reporting quality analyses, as shown in Table 16-1.

Proximate Analysis (Long):   The values for moisture, ash, volatile matter, and fixed carbon collectively 
total 100 percent, with fixed carbon being a value calculated as the difference of 100 percent minus the 
sum of the other three values.  Sulphur is reported as a percentage of the total sample.  Thermal Value, 
a measure of the heat-producing capability of coal measured in Kcal/kg or Btu/lb, was tested for in 
composite and washability samples, but not in incremental samples.     

Specific Gravity was measured on a small subset of samples only.  A mathematical Specific Gravity was 
calculated on all samples for comparison with the tested value.  While the calculated specific gravity is 
similar to the tested value, it is not always close enough to be considered an acceptable replacement to 
the test. 

Vitrinite reflectance, a test related to establishing coal rank and metallurgical characteristics, was 
performed on a subset of samples.   

Canister head space, one of several tests that determine in-seam gas content, was performed on a 
subset of samples. 

Raw incremental (air dried basis), raw composite (as received basis), and washed composite analyses 
were complete as of December 31, 2009 and are reviewed in this report.  Although washability tests from 
2006 studies (Cullingham, 2007) indicated that crushing to smaller size fractions would probably be 
necessary, current washability studies indicate a reasonable product can be obtained without crushing to 
small size fractions (see Section 16.3 following.)   

A summary of 2009 raw composite values (or incremental where composites do not exist) by drill hole for 
the main seams at Raven is shown in Table 16-2.  Since composite samples were presented on an as 
received basis and incremental samples were reported on an air dried basis, values were converted 
mathematically to dry basis for comparison and reporting purposes.  Seam composites comprising less 
than 50 percent core recovery are excluded as unreliable representations of the seam.  Incremental and 
composite samples with less than 50 percent core recovery are also excluded.  When a gridded quality 
model is generated later, more restrictive data constraints (80 percent or greater core recovery) will be 
employed for the gridded model, since generation of quality trends for use in mine planning will be its 
primary purpose.  Table 16-2 summarizes 2009 data available excluding exceedingly unreliable 
composites with less than 50 percent core recovery.  

16.3 Washability Analyses 

The following data have been provided by John Alderman of Advanced Coal Technology. 

16.3.1 Metallurgical Quality Coal 

From a review of prior drilling and laboratory analytical work on the property, it was determined that a 
product suitable for coking coal blends could be obtained through a separation at a specific gravity of 
approximately 1.40, and a thermal product could be made at a separation of approximately 1.60.

Table 16-3 summarizes the core recovery percent and the dry basis ash percent, sulfur percent, and 
kg/kcal for the 1.40 float fraction of the plus 100-Mesh size fraction for Seam 1 of the cores tested.  It 
should be noted that the data in Tables 16-3 and 16-4 include all samples, even those that are partings 
or represent extremely low recovery zones that would not report to the coal preparation plant. These 
data artificially suppress recovery values.  In addition, the average recovery is a simple arithmetic 
average and is not weighted for seam thickness or density.  In the feasibility phase, a mine plan can be 
developed that maximizes the recovery of metallurgical coal and provides higher recoveries than the 
average values shown in these raw tables.  The initial washability interpolation work, which normalizes all 
products to 10 percent ash and 1 percent sulfur, shows a simple average recovery of over 40 percent for 
metallurgical coal. 

Coal recovery is very sensitive to product ash content. As shown in Figure 16- 1, a plot of cumulative ash 
percent versus cumulative recovery percent for the plus 100-Mesh composite of one of the Large 
Diameter (LD) core samples, the rate of change for values of less than 10 percent ash is significantly 
greater than the rate of change for values greater than 10 percent ash.  For example, based on Figure 
16-1, when product ash increases from 5 percent to 10 percent, recovery increases from 5 percent to 42 
percent, or 7.4 percent recovery increase per 1 percent increase in product ash.  In contrast, as product 
ash increases from 10 percent to 15 percent, the recovery increases from 42 percent to 65 percent, or 
4.6 percent recovery increase per 1 percent increase in product ash.  Note in Table 16-3 that many more 
of the 1.40 float ash values are less than 10 percent ash than over 10 percent ash.  In order to properly 
estimate theoretical recovery for a 10 percent ash met coal product, the washability data were 
interpolated at a constant 10 percent ash, and the results are shown in Table 16-5. 

The nominal specification for internationally traded metallurgical blending coals is less than 10.0 percent 
ash and less than 1.0 percent sulfur (dry basis), although these limits can be exceeded in a number of 
markets, and many other quality factors are also important.   

As Table 16-3 shows, the simple arithmetic average for all of the samples was 9.74 percent ash and 1.17 
percent sulfur.  Eliminating the six (shaded) samples with sulfur values ranging from 1.49 to 3.12 percent 
(shaded) brings the average sulfur on the remaining samples down to 0.99.  In actual practice, these 
higher sulfur coals can be segregated utilizing on-line analyzers and diverted for thermal coal 
applications, if necessary.  Core recovery for the low-sulfur samples averages 85 percent and sink/float 
yield averages 36 percent. 

Table 16-4 summarizes the core recovery percent and the dry basis ash percent, sulfur percent, and 
kg/kcal for the 1.40 float fraction of the plus 100-Mesh size fraction for Seam 3 of the cores tested.   

The 1.40 float fraction from these analyses are generally higher in sulfur than the Seam 1 analyses.  
However, as was the case with the Seam 1 coals, systematically eliminating the higher-sulfur coals, can 
bring the average sulfur down below 1.00 for Seam 3.  Core recovery for the low-sulfur samples averages 
83 percent and sink/float yield averages 34 percent, which is similar to the results for Seam 1.

Proximate Analysis, FSI, and Ultimate Analysis results for samples from Seams 1 and 3 previously 
identified as suitable for low-sulfur coking coal were performed by the Lab and reported on a dry basis. 
The coal represented by these values is a high volatile metallurgical coal with high Free Swelling Index 
averaging 8.00. 

Table 16-6 contains the petrographic analysis for the samples from Seam 1 and Seam 3 along with 
rheology measurements, phosphorous analysis, coke oven tests, and coke strength tests.  As would be 
expected with a high volatile coal, vitrinite types are dominated by types V8 and V9.  Light transmittance 
values were high, indicating limited oxidation, and FSI values ranged from 7.5 to 8.5.  Dilatometer testing 
showed Maximum Contraction values ranging from -24 to -30, and Maximum Dilation values ranging from 
44 to 168.  Plasticity values were generally under 3,200 dial divisions per minute. A sample of Seam 3 
coal showed a value of 30,000 ddpm. 

Moveable Wall Coke Oven Tests resulted in Coke Reactivity Index values ranging from 66.4 percent to 
72.1 percent, and Coke Strength After Reaction Values ranging from 1.3 to 6.0.  The Sole Heated Oven 
Test showed a -9.84 percent contraction. 

16.3.2 Thermal Coal Quality 

Table 16-7 shows the basic quality parameters for the thermal coal product as indicated by the 1.60 float 
fraction of the plus 100M coal.  The average ash percent on a dry basis is 16.4 percent and ranges from 
under 10 percent to over 50 percent in a single instance. Ash percent values generally range in the mid-
teens. Sulfur percent values in Table 16-7 average 1.55 percent but range from as low as 0.49 percent to 
as high as 6.30 percent. The specific energy content averages 6,880 kc/kg and ranges from 3,508 kc/kg 
to 7,669 kc/kg.

16.3.3 Analytical Procedures 

All sample processing and testing was performed in accordance with the relevant standards, namely SCC 
(Canada), ASTM (United States), and Standards Australia, to insure representative samples and sub-
samples of coal were used in testing and analysis. 

For flotation testing an additional procedure was added to the standard timed-release froth flotation test 
procedure.  Because previous testing showed concentrates with modest yields and high ash content, an 
initial test procedure was performed employing incremental reagent addition to identify the appropriate 
reagent dosage to achieve a desirable quality product. 

The clean coal quality and recovery will directly reflect the laboratory results for the washability analysis. 
As indicated in the washability analysis, a specific gravity separation in the general range of 1.40 will 
produce a 10 percent ash (dry) met coal in most cases for Seam 1 and in many cases for Seam 3.  Plant

recovery will be prorated for the mechanical efficiency of the preparation plant and for discarding the 
minus 100-Mesh fine coal.  Product moisture content is estimated to be 7 percent based upon the size 
analysis of the coal.

17.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE ESTIMATES 

17.1  Approach 

The classification, estimation, and reporting of coal resources for the Raven project area is in accordance 
with National Instrument 43-101.  PAH has used the following referenced documents for the resource 
estimates summarized in this Technical Report:  

 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's Definition Standards on Mineral Resources 
and Reserves , dated November 22, 2005 and adopted by CIM Council on December 11, 2005;

Mineral Properties, adopted on February 2003;

Reserves, Best Practice Guidelines, adopted on November 23, 2003;

Guidelines;

System for Canada by Hughes, et al. 

17.2 Coal Resource Estimation 

Coal resources were estimated and reported in a previous 43-101 report dated June 04, 2010.  There has 
been no update to the resource estimate presented in that report.  This section restates the information 
presented in that report concerning resources.  Significant engineering work, however, has been 
completed and an estimate of reserves is presented in Section 17.3 below. 

As discussed in the 2007 ORC report, the term resource is used to quantify coal contained in seams 
occurring within specified limits of thickness and depth from surface.  It does NOT identify coal reserves, 
which are resources determined to be economically minable. 

Resource estimates contained in this report are in situ tonnage and not adjusted for mining loss, 
recovery, or beneficiation (crushing and wash plant).  Resource estimation depends on several criteria:  
minimum mineable seam thickness, maximum separable parting thickness, and coal-to-rock ratio of 
aggregate seam thickness.  Since this deposit will be subject to beneficiation, the coal-to-rock ratio took a 
higher priority in defining seam tops and bottoms.    



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   17.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Resources are classified as to their assurance-of-existence into one of three categories:  Measured, 
Indicated, or Inferred.  These classifications are defined by their respective distances from a closest data 
point.  The category to which a resource is assigned depends not only on distance from a closest data 
point, but also the level of confidence in the available geological information.  Raven resources are sub-
categorized for assurance-of-existence using criteria for coals defined in Deposit Type (Underground) and 
Geology Type (Moderate, bordering on Complex).  GSC Paper 88-21 provides guidance for categorizing 
various types of coal deposits by levels of assurance.  These were considered by the QPs during the 
classification of the resources.  All reported resources for the Raven project area are less than 600 meters 
depth from surface. 

A comparison of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred distances from a data point for Geology Types 
Moderate, Complex, and Moderate, bordering on Complex (first set forth by Cullingham (2007), and 
supported by the authors) is shown in Table 17-1.  The regional dip and continuity of coal seams in the 
Raven area supports a Moderate classification, while the number of faults and the amount of apparent 
offset on those faults would support a Complex classification.  Thus, the authors (and Cullingham in 
2007) believe Moderate would be too optimistic and Complex would be too stringently conservative in 
identifying resources.  The criteria set forth by Cullingham opt for Measured and Indicated distances 
equivalent to Complex, but Inferred distances more in line with Moderate classification.  Further, the drill 
hole spacing and alignment are equivalent to Moderate criteria.

DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

All Raven coals are considered to be underground minable; i.e., a Deposit Type of Underground as 
determined in GSC Paper 88-21, and are reported as such.  However, it is possible that some small 
localized areas along the western outcrops and subcrops may be surface minable.  No attempt has been 
made to detail surface mining potential at the present time.   

PAH completed resource estimates effective December 31, 2009, for the Raven area.  Select holes drilled 
in prior exploration programs were included in the resource estimation based on the authors' 
determination of reliability.  Only those drill holes with available geophysical logs to confirm thickness and 
coal-to-rock ratio have been included in resource calculations, although some with geologists' logs but no 
geophysical logs have been used to help determine structure of the seams.   

The main seams comprising Seam Zones 1 and 3 are most likely to be mined at Raven.  As such, 
resources of the main seams at Raven are summarized in Table 17-3.  Coal resources for the Raven area 
are defined for the categories of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred, per the criteria specified in Table 17-
2.  Resources were calculated as in situ; i.e., 100 percent recovery factor, specific gravity of 1.5, 600m 
maximum depth.  ASTM coal rank for Raven coals is high-volatile A bituminous.  Exploration to date at 
CCC's Raven project area has delineated a significant underground resource within the main seams of 
approximately 72 million tonnes of Measured and Indicated coal, with an additional 59 million tonnes of 
Inferred coal within the main seams, of which CCC controls 60 percent through its share of the joint 
venture.

While there are seams at Raven in addition to those seams used in the stated resource, they do not 
qualify in terms of size, thickness, areal extent, etc., to be classified as a resource per CIM standards:  "A 
Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   17.4 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals 
in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction." (CIM, December 2005) 

Maps of each of the main seams showing resource blocks by assurance category are shown below:  

 Seam 360 Figure 17-1 
 Seam 340 Figure 17-2 
 Seam 150 Figure 17-3 
 Seam 340L Figure 17-4 
 Seam 150L Figure 17-5 

 
In addition to assurance-of-existence criteria, resource estimates were further limited by the CCC 
property boundary and fault boundaries, where applicable. 

To facilitate estimation of resources at Raven, PAH generated a digital geological model for Raven using 
Gemcom Software International's Minex® geological modeling software.  Key horizons or "surfaces" of 
each seam were modeled to provide the necessary limits for volume estimation.  These surfaces (roof 
and floor elevations and seam thickness) are created as 25m- mesh 2-D grids, and calculated using the 
Minex® proprietary growth algorithm – a combination of inverse distance squared and trending formulas.  
Limits for areal extent polygons, acceptable depth range, minimum thickness, and resource distance from 
a given drill hole were used to create secondary grids used in the actual resource calculations.   

Cross-sections were displayed on-screen in order to map digitally the 3-dimensional locations of various 
faults.  The reverse fault dividing the Raven area into an Upper Plate and Lower Plate was then gridded 
in order to provide a surface which could be used to cut the seam grids.  Seams in the Upper Plate were 
cut using the fault as a lower cutting surface, while seams in the Lower Plate were cut using the fault as 
an upper cutting surface. 

As specific gravity tests were not performed on all samples, and primarily on washability samples, in situ 
volumes were converted to tonnages by application of the global density value (1.5) used by ORC in 
2006, as representative of coal seams derived from available coal quality data.  Resource estimates 
above are based on data acquired by CCC exploration through December 2009. 

The calculated coal tonnages are in situ and are considered only a resource base for underground mine 
planning.  The resources as reported have not been subject to a detailed economic analysis nor do they 
have demonstrated economic viability.

The following factors may have an effect on actual mineable reserves or salable tonnes determined in the 
future for the Raven project area: 

 A wash plant will be employed, reducing the salable tonnes from the in place resource.  Recovery 
factor from the wash plant will be determined based on economic factors. 

 Product quality will likely be significantly enhanced after processing through the wash plant.   

 Localized complex structure such as frequency and nature of faulting suggested from seismic and 
surface mapping; variability of seam, roof, or floor conditions; and localized wash-outs will complicate 
mining and may contribute to reductions in minable reserves. 

 Although small localized areas may have met the assurance-of-existence criteria, they may not be 
large enough to warrant the expense of underground mine development, thus reducing minable 
reserves. 

Currently, per information supplied by CCC, there are no known mining, metallurgical, infrastructure, 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socioeconomic, marketing, political, or other relevant 
factors that would materially affect the resource estimate. 

Sections of this report are from the previous 43-101 reports compiled by ORC and GEC, and information 
gathered by PAH on recent visits to the Vancouver and Vancouver Island offices. 

17.3 Coal Reserve Estimation 

The CIM Definition Standard provides the following definition for Mineral Reserves: 

"A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral 
Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors 
that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral 
Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is 
mined." 

The conversion of resources to reserves requires the application of a number of modifying factors also 
referred to as quantifying elements.  Guidance on these factors and their application is found in the CIM 
Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines: 

"There are a number of quantifying elements or modifying factors that should be considered in 
the conversion of a Mineral Resource to a Mineral Reserve. The QP should ensure that these 
elements/factors have been considered in adequate detail to demonstrate that, in accordance 
with the CIM Standards and as referenced in NI 43-101, economic extraction can be justified. 
While the appropriate level of detail for each of the elements/factors is left to the discretion of 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   17.11 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

the QP, in aggregate, the levels of detail and engineering must meet or exceed the criteria 
contained in the definition of Preliminary Feasibility Study. The main elements/factors to be 
considered include mining, metallurgy, geotechnical, hydrological, environmental, location, 
marketing, legal requirements, revenue, costs and social implications." 

Considering these and other factors, PAH engineers and their sub-consultants developed mine plans 
based on the geologic model.  Section 22 contains extensive discussion on the selection of mining 
method (Section 22.2), design parameters (Section 22.3) and resulting mine design and production 
schedule (Section 22.4).  Section 22 details geotechnical, hydrological/hydrogeological and other 
important technical matters such as seam gas and ventilation. 

Particular attention must be given to recovery factor and mining dilution as these parameters affect the 
run-of-mine (ROM) tonnes derived from the in place tonnes included in the resource estimate. 

While coal seams themselves contain a certain amount of rock or non-coal parting material, the mine 
design and operation result in additional out-of-seam dilution.  For example, the mine design for practical 
reasons includes certain areas where the coal seam is less than 1.5 m in height.  This results in additional 
roof and/or floor material being mined in order to maintain the minimum mining height of 1.5 m – the 
minimum limit of the planned continuous miner.  The Carlson®Mining 2009 mine design and scheduling 
software  used by PAH honors the minimum 1.5 m mining height parameter and thus calculates 
additional dilution tonnes of roof and floor material resulting from that parameter. 

Variability in seam thickness and localized rolls in coal seam roof and floor, along with minor disruptions 
in seam structure due to faulting make it a practical impossibility for mining operations to stay wholly 
within the coal seam, routinely introducing additional roof and/or floor material to the ROM product.  
Consequently, in addition to the in-seam partings and any dilution mined to maintain minimum mining 
height, an allowance of an additional nine percent dilution has been applied to reserve estimates for 
routine roof and floor dilution. 

While minimum mining height parameters affect dilution, the mining method and equipment chosen has 
practical operational limitations in an underground environment.  Specifically, continuous miners and roof 
bolters are designed to operate across a range of mining heights, in this case from the minimum 1.5 m to 
a maximum of 3.2 m.  The Carlson®Mining 2009 software honors the maximum 3.2 m mining height 
parameter and in any locations where the seam thickness exceeds 3.2 m, the coal seam is not fully 
recovered.   
 
As a practical matter, where the seam is consistently thicker than the maximum mining height of 3.2 m, 
the operations will generally work towards the coal seam roof, leaving floor coal.  If the remaining floor 
coal is thick enough, it is possible to make a second pass in order to mine that coal as well.  If this 
practice were implemented, it would normally be limited to development roadways either during initial 
panel development or the retreat phase with concurrent removal of the pillars.  However, recovery of the 
additional seam thickness in the pillars is generally impractical.  Therefore, mine plans supporting the 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   17.12 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

reserve estimate in this report do not include any recovery of coal in excess of 3.2 m maximum mining 
height. 

Even if seam thickness remains within equipment height constraints, mining of coal pillars on retreat (or 
depillaring) as a practical matter does not result in recovery of 100 percent of the coal contained in those 
pillars.  A limited number of panels (mining blocks) do not include any recovery of pillars where 
geotechnical analysis based on depth and seam thickness indicate insufficient stability factors for pillar 
removal.  The expected average recovery of pillars in areas where they are mined on retreat is 70 
percent. 

Recovery is also affected by environmental, location/social factors.  For example, no pillar recovery 
operations are planned within a zone of 75 m either side of the Tsable River.  Nor will mine layouts pass 
under or otherwise affect the Inland Island Highway. 

ROM coal will be conveyed to the surface where it will be processed to coal suitable for sale.  PAH 
engineers developed an approach to coal processing based on the nature and quality of the coal and 
market specifications.  Section 22 contains an extensive discussion on the process design (Section 22.5) 
which will partially remove non-coal material in order to deliver product coal at 10 and 15 percent ash.  
The projected coal recovery is based on extensive analysis of coal cores with emphasis on the 2006 and 
2009 program data and including large diameter cores.  Process plant efficiency of 97 percent has been 
applied to the projected plant yields.  Additional factors have been considered and discussed at length in 
Section 22 including: 

 necessary facilities and infrastructure to support mining operations (Section 22.6),  

 logistics and port facilities/infrastructure(Section 22.8),  

 marketing and price forecasts (Section 22.7),  

 broad environmental considerations (Section 22.10) 

 capital and operating costs (Section 22.9). 

The results are summarized in Table 17-4.  In compliance with NI 43-101, only Proven and Probable 
reserves are reported.  While generally only one number is reported for each category for mineral 
reserves, for coal, it is acceptable to report a ROM Coal Reserve and/or a Clean Coal (Saleable or Product 
Coal) Reserve.  

It is important to clarify that Reserves are the part of Resources deemed economic, i.e., Reserves and 
Resources are not additive.

19.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 

The coals of the Raven project area dip regionally 10 to 15 degrees (Cullingham, 2007), complicated by 
normal and reverse faulting, which have been located via surface mapping and/or inferred from drill hole 
data.  The Geology Type is considered by Cullingham (2007) and the authors to be "Moderate, bordering 
on Complex." 

Exploration to date at CCC's Raven project area has delineated a significant underground resource within 
the main seams of approximately 72 million tonnes of Measured and Indicated coal, with an additional 59 
million tonnes of Inferred coal within the main seams, of which CCC controls 60 percent through its share 
of the joint venture.  Resource calculations have been performed in accordance with National Instrument 
43-101. 

The reported underground resources have been constrained by: 

 distance from data-point assurance-of-existence categories of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred 
 consideration only of main, or minable, seams 
 2:1 or greater coal-to-rock ratio within aggregate seam 
 1.5 m minimum seam thickness 
 0.3 m minimum separable parting 
 600 m maximum depth limit for underground mine development. 
 In situ resources (i.e., 100 percent recovery) 
 CCC property boundary limits 

Coal is generally of high volatile A bituminous rank and has favorable coking coal characteristics 
according to tests from both the 2006 (Cullingham, 2007) and 2009 programs.  It is suitable for the 
metallurgical market as well as various thermal purposes.  However, the coal in raw form has high ash 
and often high sulfur content, and thus will need to be washed.  Although washability tests from 2006 
studies (Cullingham, 2007) indicated that crushing to smaller size fractions would probably be necessary, 
current washability studies indicate a reasonable product can be obtained without crushing to small size 
fractions (see Section 16.3).   

The Raven deposit is not yet a development or production property.  Based on the resource models 
developed, PAH has completed a pre-feasibility study on the project.  Reserves estimates have been 
prepared, subject to the following considerations: 

 mine design,  
 coal processing plant design,  
 other factors necessary for project development,  
 economic analysis conducted as part of the pre-feasibility study,  



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   19.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Proven and Probable reserves are estimated at 30.1 million ROM tonnes which, after processing, is 
estimated to yield 13.2 million product tonnes.

20.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 

Exploration to date has defined the Raven coal resource amenable to underground mining.  Geological 
and coal quality data on the Raven coal property are sufficient to support resource and reserve 
estimations at a feasibility level for the Raven project area.  Recommendations for additional work, 
pending positive results in a Feasibility Study, would add to the database with regard to refinement of 
certain elements of structural geology, and coal seam development.  These recommendations are: 

PAH recommends additional drilling at Raven to define locations and offsets of some of the normal faults 
and to determine if the reverse fault is low- or high-angle.  If the reverse fault can be determined to be 
low-angle, significant repeat of the coal section may exist on the Lower Plate, thus potentially increasing 
resources in the northeast part of the project area.  Three holes totalling an estimated 1,900m could 
determine if the Lower Plate is more extensive than currently interpreted, with the concurrent potential to 
increase resources.  Cost for these holes is estimated at C$817,000. 

Additionally, two pairs of holes positioned on either side of two normal faults at the south end of the 
property would help determine offset on these two faults, totalling an estimated 1,050 m.  These four 
fault-offset holes could result in minor resource shift of Inferred resource to Measured or Indicated 
resource, although they would primarily be used in mine design details.  Cost for these holes is estimated 
at C$294,000.   

PAH also recommends that several pre-2006 holes lacking geophysical logs be offset and re-drilled in 
order to confirm collar location and downhole lithology with geophysical logs.  Holes with no geophysical 
logs were excluded from resource calculations.  Two holes at the north end of the property, one at the 
south end, and one at the east edge would be targeted for this confirmation drilling and could result in a 
shift of Inferred resource to Measured or Indicated resource.  These four holes would total 600 m for an 
estimated cost of C$168,000.  

PAH also recommends the drilling of three holes at the north end of the property, on the north side of the 
Tsable River.  Fewer holes exist in this area, resulting in a large area of inferred resource.  Additional 
holes would result in refining seam thickness information and could result in a shift of Inferred resource 
to Measured or Indicated resource.  These holes totalling 400 m would cost an estimated C$112,000.   

Mining studies are ongoing.  Areas of uncertainty in engineering design that must be resolved to 
determine bankable feasibility include the following: 
 
 reject geochemistry to determine if material is potentially acid-generating,  
 groundwater inflows and geochemistry to determine underground water management, 
 water treatment requirements, if necessary.   

PAH recommends that these studies be completed to support further decisions on project development.

22.0  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR A TECHNICAL REPORT ON 
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES  

22.1  Introduction 

The proposed Raven Underground Coal Project (also referred to as the Raven Coal Project or Raven 
Project) is a greenfield project on which studies to pre-feasibility level have been completed as defined in 
NI 43-101. 

"Preliminary feasibility study" and "pre-feasibility study" each mean a comprehensive study of the viability 
of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where the mining method, in the case of underground 
mining, or the pit configuration, in the case of an open pit, has been established and an effective method 
of mineral processing has been determined, and includes a financial analysis based on reasonable 
assumptions of technical, engineering, legal, operating, economic, social, and environmental factors and 
the evaluation of other relevant factors which are sufficient for a qualified person, acting reasonably, to 
determine if all or part of the mineral resource may be classified as a mineral reserve; 

Work is currently underway to advance the level of work on the project and complete a Bankable 
Feasibility Study. 

"Feasibility study" means a comprehensive study of a mineral deposit in which all geological, engineering, 
legal, operating, economic, social, environmental and other relevant factors are considered in sufficient 
detail that it could reasonably serve as the basis for a final decision by a financial institution to finance 
the development of the deposit for mineral production; "development property" means a property that is 
being prepared for mineral production and for which economic viability has been demonstrated by a 
feasibility study. 

Although then by definition, the Raven Project cannot yet be considered a development property, this 
section has been prepared to summarize the key findings of the pre-feasibility study and outline the basis 
for the feasibility study now being undertaken. 

22.2 Mining Method 

Geologic models generated for the Raven Project were reviewed.  These included seam thickness, seam 
floor structure, seam floor gradient, interburden thickness, overburden thickness, and geologic anomalies 
such as faults in the mineable seams.  From the geologic models, mineable blocks were defined in all 
areas meeting the following four criteria: 

 coal seam thickness greater than 1.5 m, 
 seam gradient less than 14 degrees, 
 cover depth less than 500 m, and 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.2 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

 block boundaries completely inside the Measured and Indicated resource area (within 450 m of a 
borehole intercepting the seam of interest). 

For the mineable blocks thus defined, the seam thickness criterion was relaxed to permit thicknesses 
down to 1 m, where judged applicable.  The resulting collection of minable blocks based on the above 
criteria is highly variable in terms of location, shape and size.  The various design parameters such as 
seam thickness, seam floor gradient, and overburden depth vary over a significant range, both between 
blocks and also within individual blocks.  The ranges of pertinent design parameters were compiled and 
used to evaluate their compatibility with potential mining methods. These ranges and other specific 
factors that were considered in the selection of an appropriate mining method are as follows: 

 The widths of mineable coal blocks range from approximately 250 m to 1,000 m. 

 Coal blocks have irregular, typically non-rectangular shapes. 

 Seam thicknesses vary from 1 m to 6 m. 

 Seam floor gradients vary from 10 to 14 degrees. 

 Overburden depths vary from 75 m to 450 m. 

 Multi-seam mining (in some areas) of Seam 360 or 340 and Seam 150 with an average interburden 
thickness of 30 m. 

 Immediate roof composed of moderately strong siltstone and claystone with good caving potential. 

 Typical mechanized coal mining production rates and maximized resource recovery.  

 Available mineable resource. 

 Nominal production target of two million run-of-mine (ROM) tonnes per year. 

 Reasonable level of capital investment in mining equipment. 

Based on the above constraints, the selected mining method should be highly adaptable to unexpected 
changes in geometry (block shape caused by changes in seam thickness and gradient).  The only realistic 
candidate mining systems are longwall mining and room-and-pillar mining (with or without secondary 
pillar extraction.)  Longwall mining requires large areas of continuous reserve and is not readily adaptable 
to changing conditions.  The greatest difficulty is the relatively small size of the mining blocks and 
resulting small longwall panels which would require frequent moves and associated loss of productivity.  
Also, significant resource would be lost since the rectangular panels cannot reach all parts of a non-
rectangular block area.  Steep and changing seam gradients and variable seam thickness are also 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.3 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

problematic for longwall mining.  Therefore, the longwall mining method was deemed ill suited to 
conditions at the Raven Project and ruled out for further consideration. 

The room-and-pillar mining technique, however, is easily the more attractive option for several reasons, 
the foremost being the flexibility of this method to adapt to the variable conditions present at the Raven 
Project.  For example, the operation of multiple room and pillar super-sections has the potential to 
achieve reasonable production rates.  Pillar sizes and geometries can be easily modified during 
development to accommodate changing overburden loads.  Full pillar extraction maximizes coal recovery 
in normal operations, but can be suspended in those limited areas having excessive overburden load.  In 
a multi-seam environment, remnant pillars in one seam may induce high stress spots in the second seam.  
The room-and-pillar method would permit local modifications of the pillar dimensions to accommodate 
the high stress zones.  The designated mining blocks can be almost completely mined, with no wasted 
resource.  Blocks can be accessed by a limited number of development entries (mains) to minimize the 
exposure to unfavorable conditions (inadequate seam thickness and steep gradient.)  Thus room-and-
pillar mining is considered to be the most suitable extraction method for the Raven Project.  

22.3  Design Parameters  

22.3.1  Geotechnical Considerations  

Agapito Associates, Inc. (AAI) were subcontracted by Pincock Allen & Holt (PAH) to prepare a 
geotechnical characterization of the project as a basis for development of mine plans, productivities and 
roof support requirements. 

Laboratory Investigation Results 

Laboratory tests were performed on rock samples obtained from eight exploratory boreholes (RAV 9-16, 
18, 20, 22, 24, 27, 34 and 35) that intercepted the Seams 360/340 and 150.  The samples were selected 
from the roof, floor, coal and interburden lithologic horizons.  AAI provided instructions on the sampling 
procedure and based on logs of the holes, selected samples for testing.  The samples were shipped to 
AAI for testing in their laboratory located in Grand Junction, Colorado.  The laboratory characterization 
tests included Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS), Triaxial Strength, Brazilian (indirect) Tensile 
Strength, Point Load Strength and Slake Durability tests.  The samples were categorized into the 
following ten lithologic groups based on their relative distances from the two mineable seams: 

 Overburden 
 Seam 360 roof (2-5 m) 
 Seam 360 roof (1-2 m) 
 Seam 360 coal 
 Seam 360 floor (0-3 m) 
 Interburden 
 Seam 150 roof (2-5 m) 
 Seam 150 roof (1-2 m)

A summary of the laboratory test results is presented in Table 22-1.  The table also presents the 
percentage composition and Rock Quality Designation (RQD) of each rock group.  In general, the rock 
types are typical of coal measure strata, consisting of moderately strong sandstones/siltstones mixed with 
weaker mudstones/claystones.  The summarized geotechnical data presented here formed the basis for 
design in later analyses.  

Formation Stresses 

In September 2009, AAI performed downhole in situ stress testing at the Raven Project site in order to 
measure the in situ horizontal stress field surrounding two target coal seams to be used in the design of 
underground workings and associated ground support systems.  Testing was conducted in Core Hole RAV 
09-028 at various depths above, between and below Seams 360/340 and 150.  The test method is based 
on an over coring technique conducted at the bottom of an HQ-sized borehole using standard wireline 
techniques.  Measurements were conducted using the Sigra stress tool, which measures the changes in 
hole diameter in six directions resulting from over coring a 25 mm diameter pilot hole with a 64mm inside 
diameter (ID) HQ core bit.  The field measurements are used to estimate the magnitude and orientation 
of the principal stresses in the horizontal plane. 

A total of ten tests were attempted, yielding six successful runs.  Core samples from the successful 
attempts were tested in AAI's laboratory to determine the elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio.  The data 
were examined to determine the change in diameter that occurred during overcoring and were combined 
with the elastic properties to calculate the principal stresses.  The stress solution utilizes a least-squares 
technique that considers the data from all six directions and provides a relative indication of the 
measurement accuracy.  Table 22-2 lists the major results from the laboratory testing and the calculated 
principal stresses.

The results show moderate variability of magnitudes, directions, and σ1:σ2 ratio.  There is a definite 
trend of increasing stress with depth, approximately corresponding to the assumed vertical stress 
gradient.  The average maximum horizontal stress (σ1) is 0.85 times the vertical stress (σv) and the 
average minimum horizontal stress (σ2) is 0.60 times σv (or 0.70 times σ1.)  The horizontal stresses 
exceed those predicted by the elastic Poisson effect, which indicates that the boundary stress conditions 
are most likely a uniform stress field rather than uniform deformation.  The stress magnitudes suggest 
that the stresses are approaching a hydrostatic condition (all stresses equal) through inelastic 
mechanisms and thus, do not agree with the ideal elastic predictions. 

The orientations are also variable, but generally correspond to two directions.  Three over cores are 
oriented at an average true bearing of N 72° E and the other three over cores are oriented at an average 
true bearing of N 33° W.  These orientations roughly correspond to the large-scale trends of an anticline 
axis and fault traces located within the mine property.  The stresses also appeared to be aligned with the 
movement of the San Juan plate, subducting under Vancouver Island on the west.  The biaxial ratio of 
the principal stresses is relatively small, indicating that they are not strongly directional.  The estimated 
orientations appear highly sensitive to minor variations in the data and may be influenced by localized 
anomalies at the test locations.  

The rock types in which testing occurred are thought to be relatively consistent throughout the proposed 
mining area.  Although there are several structural features identified (primarily folds and faults) that 
could influence the stress field at a particular location, no structures were identified in the immediate 
vicinity of the tests and the stress results should be applicable for most areas of the mine property.  The 
stress measurements were obtained reasonably close to the target mining seams; therefore, the 
measured stress magnitude should be representative of the stresses immediately around the mine 
workings.  The likelihood of roof problems such as cutter roof and extensive roof falls is small due to the 
nearly hydrostatic stress conditions, the lack of directionality of the horizontal stresses, and the presence 
of strong, non-laminated sandstones and siltstones in the roof.  In summary, the measured in situ stress 
levels and orientations at the Raven Project do not warrant any special roof support or mine design 
approach. 

Overburden Caving and Subsidence Assessment 

AAI reviewed several available techniques to characterize roof cavability of Seams 360/340 and 150.  Of 
all the approaches reviewed, the critical span determination method proposed by Wu and Karfakis (1993) 
was selected to assess cavability of mine roof in this study.  The critical span method utilizes elastic beam 
theory to equate the tensile stresses induced in the mine roof beam (fixed-end or cantilever) with the 
tensile strength of roof rock to ultimately, calculate a critical roof span.  AAI chose two different mining 
scenarios for cavability assessment: (1) the immediate roof stratum is supported at both ends prior to the 
first cave (fixed-end beam behavior); and (2) the immediate roof is cantilevered (fixed) at only one end.  
The roof rock and coal characteristics used to estimate critical roof spans were based on averages of 
relevant laboratory test results.  The overburden depth, roof thickness and roof tensile strength were 
varied in order to perform a parametric analysis of the critical span. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.7 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

It was found that the critical span range was 4.5 to 16.3m for first cave conditions (fixed-end beam) and 
2.2 to 6.6 m for periodic caving conditions (cantilevered beam).  These span values represent a cross-
section of an unsupported roof beam and assumes an infinitely long entry perpendicular to the section.  
The 6-m-wide entries are not expected to cave during development since the exposed roof is constrained 
on four sides (three sides over solid pillars and one side bolted).  During pillaring, however, the roof over 
the mined pillars is unsupported and is part of a long (unconstrained) cave line, thus, the model 
conditions are met and the critical span range should easily be exceeded, producing a good cave.  It was 
also noted that the thickness of the immediate roof layer is the predominant influence on the critical span 
for caving, with the extreme values of the above-mentioned ranges corresponding to 3m and 9m roof 
thicknesses, respectively.  Overall, the estimated critical span values indicate that the mine roof is 
anticipated to have good cavability behind the retreat line. 

Subsidence due to Multi-Seam Mining:  In addition to the cavability assessment, AAI performed a 
predictive analysis on the potential surface subsidence above the proposed Raven Project.  The 
subsidence modeling effort used the program Surface Deformation Prediction System (SDPS [Agioutantis 
and Karmis 2002]) to evaluate potential subsidence due to full room and pillar panel extractions in the 
360/340 and 150 seams.  In this study, an area to the south east end of the property was chosen 
(Figures 22-1 and 22-2) for analysis so that the impact of multi-seam extraction could be simulated.  Two 
multi-seam extraction cases (scenarios) were simulated during this study.  In the first case, the lower 
(150) seam panel layout aimed to maximize extraction independent of the upper (360/340) seam layout, 
and in the second case, the lower seam panels were stacked under the upper seam panels so that the 
impact of interseam stresses would be minimized (Figure 22-2).  The two cases were named Case 1 and 
Case 2, respectively.  

The "Influence Function" module of SDPS was used for subsidence prediction in this investigation.  This 
program module uses an influence function method, which essentially assigns a mathematical expression 
(in this case, the bell-shaped Gaussian function) to predict subsidence distribution induced by excavation 
of a unit area.  The influence function method has the ability to superpose the influences from multiple 
and irregular mine geometries.  In addition to subsidence, this program also estimates associated 
subsidence indices such as strain, slope, and curvature, described below: 

 Ground subsidence—the vertical displacement of a given point on the surface 

 Horizontal strain—the change in horizontal distance between two points divided by the original 
horizontal distance between the points 

 Slope—the difference in subsidence at two points divided by the horizontal distance between the 
points 

 Curvature—the difference in slope for two points divided by the horizontal distance between the 
points 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.8 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Representative extraction geometries of both the upper and lower seams, including elevations, were 
imported in to SDPS to construct the models for the two cases.  Topographic data for the area of interest 
were also imported to both the models.  Based on the review of Raven lithologic information, geologic 
models and engineering judgment, values were assigned to the various input parameters, including the 
subsidence factor (the ratio of maximum possible subsidence to extraction thickness), the influence angle 
(the angle between the projection of the inflection point to seam level and the point of zero subsidence, 
as measured from horizontal), and the location of the inflection point (the zero curvature point on the 
surface subsidence profile) from the panel edge, otherwise known as "edge offset."  The subsidence 
factor was assumed to be 19 percent and the influence angle was assumed to be 66.5o.  Edge offsets 
varying from 10 to 50 m were assigned to room and pillar panels, depending on the depth and width of 
the panel under consideration.  The extraction heights of the upper and lower seam panels were kept 
constant at 3.2 m and 2 m, respectively.  The sequence of mining was not a variable in this analysis; 
both the upper and lower seams were assumed to be mined out. 

The subsidence index plots for Case 1 are presented in Figures 22-3 to 22-6.  Four distinct subsidence 
troughs are observed, located approximately over the extracted panels in the Seams 360/340 and 150 
(Figure 22-3).  The maximum subsidence is approximately 1 m.  The maximum horizontal strain contours 
are plotted in Figure 22-4.  Compressive strains are observed toward the center of the subsidence 
troughs and the individual panels, with maximum values of up to -7.5 millistrains.  Tensile strains are 
present around the edges and between the panels, with maximum values of up to 6.5 millistrains.  The 
maximum slope of the subsided ground is presented in Figure 22-5, showing that the edges of panels 
exhibit steeper slopes than the centers.  Figure 22-6 presents the maximum curvature contours above 
the mined-out panels.  High negative curvatures are confined to the edges of the panels and high 
positive curvatures occur toward the centers, which correspond to pockets of high tensile and 
compressive strain values, respectively.   

The subsidence index plots for Case 2 are presented in Figures 22-7 to 22-10.  Similar to Case 1, four 
subsidence troughs are observed over the four extracted panels and the maximum subsidence value is 
less than approximately 1 m (Figure 22-7).  However, the four subsidence troughs on the ground surface 
are observed to have subsided more as compared to Case 1; each reaching maximum subsidence, which 
may be attributed to stacking of the extraction panels from both the seams.  The maximum horizontal 
strain contours are plotted in Figure 22-8.  The extreme values of tensile and compressive strains in Case 
2 are similar to those observed in Case 1.  The only observable difference is that areal spread of high 
strain values is larger in Case 2.  This may be explained by the relative position of gob-solid edges in the 
upper and lower seams, which are staggered and stacked in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.  The 
maximum slope and maximum curvature of the subsided ground for Case 2 are presented in Figures 22-9 
and 22-10, respectively.  These two plots also indicate that for Case 2, there are more areas on surface 
that experience high slopes and curvature than for Case 1.  Overall, it is concluded that even though 
stacking of the multi-seam panels reduces the total surface area that experiences subsidence, such an 
approach may lead to a larger proportion of the subsided ground experiencing high values of subsidence, 
strains, slopes and curvatures.

Potential for water inflow from streams:  As per the mining layout at the proposed Raven Project, several 
room and pillar panels in both Seams 360/340 and 150 are planned to be mined directly under Cowie 
Creek and Cougar Smith Creek, or in the proximity of the Tsable River.  A summary of approximate 
depths and extraction thicknesses of the underground workings is presented in Table 22-3 for each of the 
three streams.  Where full extraction mining of the panels (development and depillaring) is undertaken, 
minor, but measureable subsidence of the ground surface is expected.  This will involve some 
deformation of the overlying strata and create fractures in the strata in the immediate vicinity of the coal 
seam.  AAI evaluated the overburden depths to determine their adequacy to protect against stream 
inflows into the workings.  A literature review of guidelines for mining under water bodies included a 
United States Bureau of Mines report (USBM 1979) that categorized perennial streams, such as the three 
Raven streams described above, as water bodies with the potential for major subsidence impacts.  The 
cover depth criteria for major potential water bodies given by the USBM requires the overburden rocks to 
be classified into one of four rock types:  (I) minimum cumulative 6m clay, (II) minimum 75 percent 
shale, (III) shaley and silty sandstone, and (IV) 100 percent limestones and sandstones.  Once the 
overburden has been classified appropriately (Class III for the Raven Project), a multiplier is applied to 
the extraction thickness to arrive at the safe cover depth.  The appropriate minimum cover depth for 3.2 
m of extraction thickness (in the upper seam) is 150 m (47 times the extraction thickness).  Most of the 
later references on the topic of appropriate cover depth (Hartman 1992, Maleki 2008) tend to apply a 
generic cover depth criterion of 60 times the extraction thickness.  In the original USBM report, such a 
criterion was meant to be applied only to extraction below water bodies of catastrophic potential size.

Therefore, it appears that the frequently quoted factor of 60 times the extraction thickness is a 
conservative generalization that somewhat mischaracterizes the USBM study recommendations.  
According to the USBM cover depth guidelines of mining under streams of major subsidence potential, 
the planned Raven Project workings have sufficient overburden cover to prevent stream inflow into the 
workings.   

Potential Impacts of Subsidence on Salmon Habitat:  Certain creeks flowing through the property (Cowie 
Creek and Cougar Smith Creek) are understood to act as Salmon habitats.  Segments of these two creeks 
that are used by the salmon as breeding grounds are presented in Figure 22-11.  AAI performed an 
analysis to predict both the immediate- and long-term subsidence-related movements that the salmon 
habitat may experience.  In total, 19 extraction panels from Seam 150 and 8 extraction panels from 
Seam 360/340 were selected for the analysis (Figure 22-11), since portions of these panels are located 
within 300m (projected horizontal distance) of either creek.  A numerical model was constructed in SDPS 
(described earlier) that incorporated all of the 27 extraction panels.  Based on the range of seam 
thicknesses at each panel location (as specified in the geologic model), the average extraction 
thicknesses were varied from 1.5 to 3.2 m.  The edge offset assigned to each panel was based on their 
respective widths and cover depths.  The subsidence factor and angle of influence, however, were kept 
constant at 19 percent and 66.5o, respectively.  Finally, the cover depth relative to the lower seam was 
applied to the entire model prior to the simulation. 

The long-term surface subsidence and related indices, as predicted by the analysis, in the proximity of 
the two creeks are presented in Figures 22-12 to 22-15.  Figure 22-12 presents the predicted subsidence 
contours that may develop in the vicinity of the salmon habitat.  The maximum subsidence is 
approximately 0.8 m and occurs close to Cowie Creek, as it passes over Panel 56 (Seam 150) and Panels 
12 and 13 (Seam 360/340).  Most of the subsidence basins are centered above extraction panels in either 
or both the seams.  Figure 22-13 presents the maximum horizontal strain distribution on the surface.  
Creek segments within the salmon habitat are exposed alternately to compressive and tensile strains 
which represent the interior and exterior of the subsidence basins, respectively.   

The highest magnitudes of tensile and compressive strains, as experienced by the creeks, are less than 
3.5 and -4.5 millistrains, respectively.  The strain damage criterion for streams such as these is 5 
millistrains (Wardell 1976); therefore, mining-induced subsidence impacts to the two creeks are likely to 
be insignificant.  The maximum slope and maximum curvature plots around the salmon habitat are 
presented in Figures 22-14 and 22-15.   

The predicted long-term deformations experienced by both creek segments, which act as salmon 
habitats, along the stream longitudinal axis are presented in Figures 22-16 and 22-17.  The subsidence 
indices plotted along the lengths of the respective creeks are subsidence, maximum horizontal strain, 
maximum slope and maximum curvature at the surface.  The plots are relative changes from the 
baseline, pre-mining conditions which are represented by the horizontal X-axis.  Cowie Creek intercepts 
four mining panels in the lower seam and three mining panels in the upper seam, which include multiple-
seam mining scenarios.  The resultant four distinct subsidence basins are shown on the Cowie Creek 
longitudinal section (Figure 22-16), with the maximum observed subsidence of 0.72 m.  Approximate

projections of the extraction panels in Seams 360/340 and 150 are presented in the figure and show that 
all the subsidence basins align with the extraction panels.  Tensile (positive) horizontal strains are 
observed at the solid-panel edges and compressive (negative) horizontal strains are observed within the 
panel limits.  The horizontal strain magnitudes are smaller than 5 millistrains, which is the strain damage 
criterion limit for streams. 

The subsidence indices for Cougar Smith Creek are presented in Figure 22-17.  Since Cougar Smith Creek 
intercepts one extraction area each in the 360/340 Seam (Submains-05) and 150 Seam (S-Sub-05c) in a 
multi-seam mining scenario, only a solitary subsidence basin is observed above these two extraction 
panels.  The maximum observed subsidence is less than 0.55 m and the largest values of observed 
horizontal strains (at the panels' edges and center) are less than the strain damage criterion for streams.  
The subsidence index plots along the salmon habitat segments of Cowie Creek and Cougar Smith Creek 
indicate that mining-induced subsidence impacts on the stream channels and flows are likely to be 
insignificant.   

Short-term Impacts of Subsidence on Salmon Habitat:  The next step in the subsidence investigation was 
to assess the effect of mining-induced subsidence on the salmon habitat immediately after retreat mining 
operations.  Two mining scenarios were analyzed, in which the direction of retreat mining was 
perpendicular to or parallel to the streams.  Idealized schematic diagrams of both scenarios are 
presented in Figures 22-18 and 22-19 (note that the mining, stream and subsidence geometries are not 
to scale).  The pillaring operations are planned to retreat at a rate of 27 m per day.  It has been 
estimated that the subsidence factor is 19 percent for the Raven Project; therefore, 19 percent of the 
extraction thickness may be expected to be manifested at the surface as subsidence.  However, such 
magnitudes of subsidence are long-term estimates and the retreat line needs to have moved at least 0.9 
to 2.2 times the cover depth before the maximum possible subsidence is attained.   

In order to characterize daily deformations at the ground surface, dynamic (immediate or short-term) 
subsidence was considered.  The ratio of maximum dynamic displacement to final displacement typically 
ranges from 60 to 75 percent and the ratio of the maximum dynamic slope to the final slope ranges from 
50 to 80 percent (Peng 1992).  Thus, dynamic subsidence (60 to 75 percent of maximum) at a given 
point will occur immediately after the pillar retreat line passes and will gradually increase to the maximum 
value once the pillar line reaches 0.9 to 2.2 times the cover depth away from the point. 

In locations where the stream flow is perpendicular to the retreat mining direction, the stream cross-
section may be expected to subside in stages as depicted in Figure 22-18.  With each day of retreat, the 
stream bed is subsided gradually depending upon the position of retreat line with respect to the stream 
cross-section.  Lowering of the stream bed is likely to increase the pool volume within the stream, while 
the retreat line is crossing the stream and this is likely to temporarily lower the flow rate downstream of 
the subsided zone.  The reduction in flow is directly dependent on the pool volume and the stream base 
flow.  As the retreat mining line advances across the stream (in approximately four to five days, assuming 
a flood plain width of 100m.), the stream bed would have subsided by equal amounts along the entire 
cross-section (Figure 22-18, Day 4).  Once the stream cross-section has experienced maximum 
subsidence, no further significant change in stream flow is expected. 







   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.30 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

For segments of the streams that are oriented parallel to the direction of retreat, the longitudinal section 
of streams may be expected to subside in a manner similar to depicted in Figure 22-19.  With each day of 
retreat, the stream bed will subside gradually, creating additional pool volume within the channel.  As 
discussed earlier, this may lead to a temporary decrease in flow rate downstream depending on the base 
flow rate.  Within the subsidence basins that appear and are elongated in the stream bed with each day 
of retreat mining, approximately half the basin will have a slightly steeper slope than the original and the 
other half will have a slightly flatter slope than original.  The maximum dynamic slopes at each extreme 
may be estimated by adding/subtracting the approximate maximum dynamic slope value to/from the 
average stream gradient in the area under consideration.  The ratio of maximum dynamic to final slope 
ranges from 50 to 80 percent (Peng 1992).  The steepening of the stream bed in one half of the dynamic 
subsidence basin and flattening of the stream bed in the other half may pose temporary impediments to 
the movement of salmon in the affected area, depending on the post-subsidence stream bed gradient.  
The duration of such impact will be a function of the length of such stream segments that run parallel to 
the retreat mining direction.  For long stream segments, the temporary effects of subsidence will be 
experienced during the time that the retreat mining zone moves from between 300 to 600m (i.e. 
approximately 10 to 25 days).  The range of dynamic stream bed slopes could not be estimated, as the 
salmon habitat stream segments provided had inconsistent elevations.   

For stream segments within the salmon habitat that intercept the mining areas at an angle, the effect of 
subsidence will be a mix of the two scenarios described earlier and need to be examined on a case-by-
case basis.  As per the subsidence analysis results, the salmon habitat downstream of the junction of 
Cowie Creek and Cougar Smith Creek will be unaffected due to being at sufficient distance away from any 
planned mining activities.  

22.3.2  Methane Desorption and Ventilation 

Seam Gas Characterization 

As part of the 2009 exploration program, a comprehensive program was designed to characterize the 
seam gas regime.  A total of 38 coal core samples were collected and desorbed in the five wells from the 
depth range 138.1 to 381.9 m.  Sample collection and subsequence testing was undertaken by Petro-
Logic Services who were contracted by Compliance Energy.   

The boreholes sampled included RAV- 09-017, RAV-09-019, RAV-09-021, RAV-09-023 and RAV-09-029.  
The testing program was designed to determine the gas content, coal quality and gas composition of the 
coals of the Comox Formation, prior to mining.  In each well gas samples were collected from desorption 
canisters for compositional analyses.  Following desorption, coal samples were analyzed at GWIL-Birtley 
Laboratories, Calgary and gas composition samples were analyzed at Gauge Analytical, Calgary.  

Most coals are of high volatile bituminous A and B rank, within the thermogenic gas window. Ash content 
is quite varied, ranging from 8.8 percent (arb) to 70.9 percent (arb) in all wells and several samples 
should be considered as carbonaceous shale and shale, rather than coal. Sulfur content for desorbed coal 
samples also varied widely, ranging from 0.53 to 3.23 percent (arb).  





   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.32 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Samples were desorbed at approximately 21oC, corresponding to the reservoir temperature derived from 
thermal logs.  Lost gas times were short due to shallow depth and wireline retrieval.  Core retrieval 
generally took 2 to 7 minutes and extraction of the core, brief descriptions, photography and sealing in 
desorption canisters required another 12 to 33 minutes.  Consequently, lost gas is a relatively minor 
component of the total gas content in all wells with mean values ranging from 8.8 to 14.2 percent. 
Residual gas ranges from 4.3 to 8.7 percent of the total gas content.  

Total gas contents are quite varied reflecting the variation in coal quality and in reservoir depth. Gas 
contents for coals (< 40% ash, arb) range from 1.88 to 8.57 m3/tonne (60.3 to 274.4 scf/ton) (arb).  
Despite this variability, there is a linear relationship between depth and gas content when expressed on 
the dry ash-free basis.  As could be expected there are linear relationships between ash and gas content 
in each well.  Based on these relationships, the desorption data was sub-divided on the basis of lithology, 
as defined by ash content, and the mean gas content in each lithology group in each well was 
interpolated.  The gas content data is summarized in Table 22-4. 

 

The desorbed gas is mainly comprised of methane and nitrogen.  Nitrogen content ranges from 8.4 to 
77.4 percent.  Analysis undertaken by Petro-Logics using light transmittance tests suggested that the 
nitrogen was derived from the reservoir and is not an artifact of oxidation and the correction of analytical 
data to the air-free basis.  Further analysis by the firm GeoGas contracted directly by PAH suggests that 
atmospheric contamination may also have contributed to the high nitrogen contents. 

Ventilation System Requirements 

Providing adequate mine ventilation for the underground mine is critical to workplace health, safety, and 
worker efficiency.  Mine ventilation is required to dilute the contaminant gases to safe levels.  The 
contaminants of primary concern at the Raven mine are methane, diesel particulate matter (DPM), and 
dust.

DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

The Health, Safety and Reclamation Code, Mine Design Procedures, (Ministry of Energy, Mines and 
Petroleum Resources, Mining and Minerals Division, 2008) includes contaminant exposure and ventilation 
standards for mines in British Columbia.  An excerpt of rules pertaining to the ventilation concerns 
includes the following:   

 Part 6.42.3.  The concentration of explosive gases must not exceed 1 percent.   
 Part 6.37.2.  The time-weighted average exposure of a worker to airborne respirable dust shall be no 

more than 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter (m3) of air.  
 Part 4.6.1.  A minimum flow rate of 0.06 m3 per second (m3/s) of ventilating air is required per 

kilowatt (equivalent power) of diesel equipment operating in a particular section. 
 

Methane emissions are expected to drive the dilution requirements.  A review of the gas content analysis 
indicates that the highest gas content is 10.92 m3/tonne.  The estimated methane emissions 
corresponding to a gas content of 10.92 m3/tonne is 127,500 m3/day (Grau, R. H., 1984).  This level of 
gas content and quality does not appear to support degasification in advance of mining.   The quantity of 
air required to dilute the methane emitted to 0.8 percent by volume is 200 m3/s.  Accounting for 50 
percent leakage, the single section would require 37 m3/s of air flow measured at a point 90 m from the 
active face and each super section would require a flow of 74 m3/s.   

To minimize mine ventilation requirements with regard to DPM mitigation, production section equipment 
will be electric-powered to the extent practical.  To optimize utilization, non-production support 
equipment is assumed to be diesel-powered. 

Ventilation is expected to be accomplished through intake air drawn through the slope entries with 
separate splits directed to each mining area.  The main mine fans provide ventilation throughout the 
mine, from the portals to last open crosscuts.  Inby the last open crosscut, additional means of 
ventilation, in the form of ventilation curtains or auxiliary fans are required.  Auxiliary fans allow for much 
greater control of the ventilating circuit, particularly as related to control of fugitive dust generated during 
the mining process.  Ventilation curtains will be used in areas that are too low to provide fan and tubing 
clearance.  Four auxiliary fans are necessary for each mining section. 

If possible, velocities should not exceed 6 m/s in main haulage drifts, 5 m/s in conveyor drifts and 4 m/s 
in working areas.  The belt is assumed to be on a fresh split of air having a lower velocity. 

The mine plan sequencing was analyzed to determine the worst case scenario for the ventilation system 
analysis.  The mining sections appear to be located at the furthest inby extents in 2017.  At this time, one 
super section (two continuous miners) will be located in the Seam 150 northern district of the mine, and 
two production sections in the southern district of the mine, another super section mining Seams 360/340 
and a standard section (one continuous miner) working Seam 150.  The mine ventilation system was 
modeled using Ventsim Visual© (Chasm Consulting, 2010).  The mine ventilation branches were modeled 
using the characteristics typical of coal mines.  The friction factors for exhaust, intake and belt airways 
are:

DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

 Intakes, clean conditions    0.009 kg/m3 
 Return, some irregularities, sloughing  0.01 kg/m3 
 Belt Entries      0.005 to 0.011 kg/m3 

 

A mining height of 2 m is assumed in all areas except in the slopes and in the areas where the entries 
neck down for protection of the river corridors or slopes.  In these entries a height of 3.4 m was 
assumed.  In all airways a width of 6m was used.  The model indicates that an intake shaft (3.5 m 
diameter) is needed in the southern extents of the mine to adequately deliver the air required.  Two main 
fans are recommended at 150m3/s and 2,375 Pa each requiring 475 kW of power.   

The conditions of the airways and, in particular, the methane gas emission rates influence the mine 
ventilation system.  Assumptions for this preliminary evaluation are based on samples from drill holes and 
published data.  The actual conditions encountered during mining cannot be verified until the mine is 
established.   

Based on the gas contents identified from exploration, modeling evaluations investigation have not 
revealed any ventilation issues that cannot be resolved with typical underground coal mine ventilation 
practices.   

22.3.3 Equipment Selection 

The proposed mining method of room and pillar mining centers on the use of a continuous miner, with 
shuttle car haulage and dual boom roof bolters used for roof support.  The development sections will 
typically include of the following equipment: 

 Continuous miner (1 or 2) 
 Shuttle cars (3) 
 Roof bolter (2) 
 Section power center 
 Section switch house 
 Feeder breaker 
 Diesel scoop  
 Auxiliary fan(s) 
 Maintenance/parts trailers 
 Section mantrip 

Continuous Miner 

Super sections will require two (2) 950-volt-alternating-current (VAC), medium height (Joy 14CM15 or 
equivalent) continuous miners, while a single unit will be required for the standard section.  Low ground 
pressure crawlers will be specified to minimize damage to and generation of out-of-seam dilution from 
the mine floor.  The continuous miners will also be specified to be equipped with automation, which 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.35 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

provides for better horizon control, consistent loading of shuttle cars, and easier, more effective training 
of new personnel. 

The 14CM15E has a minimum cutting height of 1.3m and a maximum cutting height of 3.3 m, and is 
capable of cutting and loading coal in a range of 10 to 28 tonne/minute. 

Shuttle Car 

The shuttle cars haul coal from the continuous miner to the belt-conveyor feeder breaker.  There are 
three types of shuttle cars:  electric trailing cable-powered, battery-powered, and diesel-powered. 

Diesel powered cars offer advantages of power and flexibility as they are not "tethered" by an electric 
trailing cable.  The disadvantages associated with diesel cars are noise and the higher ventilation 
requirements.  There are currently, however, no diesel cars available capable of operating at a minimum 
mining height of 1.5 m.   

Battery powered cars offer similar flexibility to diesel cars without the noise and ventilation issues.  While 
they are readily available and widely used in mines with similar range of seam heights as Raven, the 
steep grades that will often need to be negotiated at Raven would typically drain a battery in less than a 
shift.  

The trailing-cable-type shuttle car is therefore assumed for the Raven Project.  It is assumed there will be 
three (3) shuttle cars assigned to each super section, with two (2) being assigned to the standard 
section.  A Joy 10SC32AA (or equivalent) shuttle car has a nominal payload capacity of 11 tonnes of coal.  
With a height over the operators canopy of 1.1 m, it can operate in seam heights as low as 1.3 m. 

Roof Bolter 

The roof bolter is required to install the prescribed ground support after the removal of the coal by the 
continuous miners.  The bolters will be a Fletcher DDR (or equivalent) with extended reach temporary 
roof support (TRS) system.  Alternately, a low profile HDDR model may also be an option.  Roof bolters 
may be crawler-mounted or rubber tire-mounted, with crawler mounted units being preferred at the 
Raven Project due to the steeper grades and soft floor.  The machines are equipped with dust collectors 
and precleaners for dry (vacuum) bolting.  Roof bolters can be converted to wet bolting at minimal cost 
and with lower ongoing maintenance costs, if necessary.  There will be two (2) roof bolters assigned to 
each super section and a single unit on the standard section.  

22.4 Life of Mine Development Plan 

22.4.1  Mining Layout and Pillar Design 

As previously discussed, room-and-pillar mining method will be used to extract coal at the Raven 
property.  Due to the variable nature of the overburden depth and seam thickness over the mineable coal 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.36 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

blocks, it was imperative that guidelines be developed for selecting pillar dimensions for mains, sub-
mains and production panels for all possible combinations of overburden depth and extraction thickness.  

The mining layouts are presented in Figures 22-20 and 22-21 for Seams 360/340 and 150.  The mineable 
blocks of the 150 Seam generally extend from the Northwest to the Southeast.  The mine access slope 
descends from the surface portal in a Southwest to Northeast direction and intercepts the 150 seam at 
the approximate midpoint of the reserve area.  Although most of the slope will be completely in coal, 
some portions near the portal need to be driven partly or wholly in rock to maintain a working grade of 
no greater than 14 degrees.  From the bottom of the slope, mains are planned to head the North and 
South, which in turn branch into sub-mains and extraction panels.   

Ramps will be driven from the 150 Seam to the 360/340 Seam workings.  Rock inclines will be driven up 
from the 150 Seam to the 360/340 Seam at two different locations.  These locations are from near the 
bottom of the mine access slope in 150 Seam and from the last section of the southern (south eastern) 
sub mains.  Based on the interburden thickness and floor gradients of both seams at these locations, the 
length of such drives were estimated to be in the range of 60 to 75 m.  Coal haulage from development 
and pillaring operations within seam will be handled by belt conveyors.  Coal haulage up the access slope 
is planned to be carried out by a slope conveyor system. 

Mains, sub-mains pillar panels were sized based on geotechnical, ventilation and operational 
considerations.  Pillar panels will be developed with an entry system along one side of the panel, 
preferably consisting of at least seven entries, for adequate ventilation.  When the entry system reaches 
the end of the panel, three rows of crosscuts (and entries) will be advanced to the opposite side of the 
panel.  One continuous miner crew will continue developing pillars in the unmined side block while the 
other crew retreat mines the pillars, row by row, starting at the end of the panel.  In this manner, both 
miners can maintain full production rates.  Depending on the width of each panel pillar (17 m or 27 m), 
an additional miner cut of 10.7 m is to be taken from each alternate entry or each entry on the retreat, 
maximizing the coal recovery.  During retreat, wing cuts will be mined from the barrier pillars on each 
side of the panel.  However, the remaining width of barrier pillar will be adequate to prevent transfer of 
stresses from mined to unmined panels.  No bleeders are incorporated in the mining layouts. 

In order to develop the mining layouts for both seams of the Raven coal property, AAI used the ARMPS 
(Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability [Mark, 1995]) pillar design program authored by NIOSH 
(National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health).  ARMPS calculates stability factors (SF) based on 
pillar strength and the applied loads during retreat mining.  Variables such as number of entries per 
panel, entry/crosscut spacing, barrier pillar width and slab cut width in the barriers while retreating can 
be input in ARMPS to estimate retreat pillar stability factors.  Based on a database of more than 250 case 
studies, ARMPS also incorporates recommended stability factors for various overburden depths.   

Prior to the panel pillar design, AAI utilized ARMPS to estimate barrier pillar widths for overburden depths 
ranging from 100 to 400 m and extraction heights ranging from 1.5 to 4 m.  Rib-to-rib development 
barrier pillar widths were estimated for a retreat mining situation with gob on both sides and a stability 
factor of 1.5.  Once the barrier pillar width was determined, it was used in ARMPS in conjunction with  







   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.39 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

either of four different pillar sizes (17 x 27 m, 17 x 40 m, 27 x 27 m and 27 x 40 m) to determine the 
adequate pillar size for specific overburden depth and extraction thickness combinations.  These four 
pillar sizes were selected due to their associated operational efficiency during both development and 
retreat mining stages, and potential for high recovery.  Additionally, the maximum safe extraction height 
for any given depth (and corresponding pillar size) was identified.  For some panels, the overburden 
depth and height combinations were such that no adequately safe pillar design could be obtained for 
retreat mining.  For these panels, retreat mining was ruled out and only development mining was 
implemented, using square pillars and development loading.  A summary of the ARMPS pillar design 
results are presented in Table 22-5. 

In order to corroborate the ARMPS pillar design results, the LAMODEL numerical modeling program was 
used to model the stress distribution in the panel and barrier pillars.  LAMODEL is a nonlinear, boundary-
element, displacement-discontinuity code for estimating stress, displacement, and yielding in tabular 
deposits.  This modeling tool has the ability to simulate both linear and nonlinear mechanical (stress-
strain) behaviors of materials.  The program performs an iterative procedure to solve a set of equations 
representing the stress-strain state of each element in a grid representing the mine geometry, until 
steady-state equilibrium is reached.  Following a Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) 
recommended confined core approach to pillar strength (Karabin and Evanto 1994), element properties 
are arranged so that the weakest elements are adjacent to the mine opening, with element strengths 
increasing into the solid unmined materials.  Strain-softening elements with increasing peak and residual 
strengths are employed to approximate elastic-plastic behaviors observed in pillars and to provide close 
agreement with empirical pillar design methods.  The models used square elements and fourteen levels 
of increasing element strength into the pillars.  Each band of strength was one element wide.  To 
accurately approximate the geometry of the as-mined pillars, 0.76 m elements were selected.  In total, 
ten models with retreat mining panel geometry and one model with development-only (no retreat) panel 
geometry were simulated, representing various pillar sizes and overburden depths.  The model outputs 
include the total load carried by each pillar, the pillar strength and the degree of yielding (if any) of the 
pillar ribs.  Stability factors are also calculated to quantify the structural status of the pillars.  In general, 
the LAMODEL analysis confirmed the adequacy of the pillar sizes determined using ARMPS and increased 
the level of confidence in the accuracy of the pillar designs.   

Based on the review of ARMPS and LAMODEL results, it was determined that maximum extraction height 
in both Seam 360/340 and 150 should be limited to 3.2 m to ensure optimum safety and coal recovery. 

22.4.2  Multi-Seam Extraction  

Since a significant amount of the mineable coal blocks at the Raven Project occur in a multi-seam 
environment, four different extraction approaches were considered.  The four methods considered and 
their brief descriptions are as follows: 

1. Undermining.  The upper seam panels are developed and mined prior to the lower seam.  This 
method has the history of most success in North American multi-seam coal mines.  Mining induced 
subsidence from the upper seam rarely hinders the mining of the lower seam.  Also, with the

presence of a known aquifer above the upper seam, it is preferable not to disturb the overburden of 
the upper seam by mining the lower seam first.    

2. Overmining.  The lower seam panels are developed and mined prior to the upper seam.  One of 
advantages of this approach is that the post-mining stresses transferred from the lower seam to the 
upper seam are typically smaller in magnitude than the stresses transferred in the opposite direction.  
However, overmining has approximately three times the failure rate as undermining in North 
American coal mining conditions.   

3. Sequential mining.  In this method, panels in both seams are developed and mined in sequence.  As 
in the cases of undermining and overmining, high stresses at gob-solid edges and remnant pillars in 
the seam being mined are transferred to the unmined seam.  In the sequential mining method, 
development and retreat of panels in both the seams can be done in tandem so that the pillars in the 
second seam do not experience high stress concentrations from the first seam and vice versa.  
However, the panel geometries in the Raven property are not regular enough to implement a proper 
sequence for such an extraction plan to be effective.    

4. Staggered development.  For this method, development and pillaring operations are staggered 
between the two seams.  The upper seam is developed first, followed by the lower seam 
development.  Then, upper seam pillars are mined followed by pillar extraction in the lower seam.  In 
this method, the pillars in lower seam experience high stress concentrations for smaller periods of 
time as compared to the undermining method, since the lower seam pillars are already developed by 
the time the upper seam is fully mined out.  The smaller time of exposure to high stresses is likely to 
decrease the probability of pillar failure in the lower seam, as compared to undermining.  However, 
production and ventilation efficiency may turn out to be worse for this method, given that the lower 
seam panels have to be developed prior to the retreat mining commences in the upper seam and 
developed panels in both seams need to be ventilated. 

AAI evaluated the available alternatives for multi-seam extraction and selected undermining as the most 
suitable approach.  Although the fourth method, where development of the lower seam precedes the 
pillar extraction in the upper seam, may have some advantages from a ground control standpoint; it has 
not been successfully implemented a sufficient number of times in North American coal mines to be 
recommended. 

Once undermining was selected as the preferred extraction method for the Raven coal property, it was 
imperative that the interseam stress interaction be evaluated.  Towards this end, LAMODEL was used to 
simulate induced stresses in the lower seam due to mining in the upper seam.  Two cases were modeled 
to evaluate induced stresses: (1) the lower seam (150 Seam) panels are laid out independent of the 
upper seam (360/340 seam) panels to maximize coal recovery; and (2) the lower seam panels are 
stacked (aligned) under the upper seam panels (Figures 22-1 and 22-2) to limit the interseam stresses 
generated at the gob-solid edges of the upper seam from transferring to the lower seam.  In the 
developed model, the four upper seam panels in the area of interest were completely mined out and the 
lower seam was unmined.  Mains and submains were excluded from the models.  The upper seam was 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.42 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

assumed to have an extraction height of 3.2 m and the lower seam was assumed to have an extraction 
height of 2 m.  The overburden depths for both the seams were obtained from geologic model.   

The multi-seam mining LAMODEL analysis results are presented in Figures 22-22 to 22-24.  The post-
mining stress distributions around the upper seam panels along with the upper seam panel boundaries 
are presented in Figure 22-22.  It may be observed that the stress distributions within the gob areas 
created by full panel extraction tend to revert to pre-mining levels, whereas the gob-solid edges and 
inter-panel barrier pillars experience high stress concentrations.  Figure 22-23 presents the induced 
interseam stress distributions in the lower seam relative to the two cases (aligned and non-aligned).  It 
was found that additional stresses in the range 17 – 67 percent may be expected on the lower seam 
pillars due to full extraction by retreat mining in the upper seam, depending on the location of such 
pillars.  Pillar design in the lower seam must account for such a surcharge load, in addition to the 
anticipated overburden load.  Comparison of the results for the stacked and un-stacked cases indicates 
that the stacked panel case will tend to avoid high stress concentrations; however, stacking of the panels 
will necessitate sacrificing some mineable coal.  For the un-stacked case, it may be necessary to suspend 
retreat pillar extraction operations in certain areas; however, the total area is larger and overall recovery 
might be greater.  At the present, there are no clear advantages of stacking the lower seam panels that 
are apparent to AAI and hence, no such recommendation is being made.  An additional model was run to 
evaluate the overmining case, with the lower seam mined first followed by the upper seam.  Figure 22-24 
shows the distribution of the induced stresses in the upper seam after mining the lower seam first.  The 
model results indicate that the increased stress on the unmined upper seam pillars can be expected to be 
in the range 17 – 33 percent.  

The cases analyzed for multi-seam mining using LAMODEL represent unique mining situations and in all 
probability, the final designs of the panel, mains and sub-mains pillars as well as the layout for both 
seams will deviate from the cases analyzed.  The level of interseam stresses is influenced by parameters 
such as overburden depth, seam extraction thickness, interburden thickness, sequence of mining and 
percentage of recovery, all of which are highly variable throughout the Raven Coal property.  All of these 
factors need to be taken in to account, on a case by case basis, when finalizing the multi-seam mining 
layouts.     

22.4.3  Roof Bolting Support Specifications 

Prior to developing roof bolting guidelines for the Raven coal property, AAI evaluated the roof and floor 
rock conditions using CMRR (Coal Mine Roof Rating).  CMRR takes into account rock strength parameters 
such as uniaxial compressive strength, point load index, RQD and moisture sensitivity to estimate a 
composite rating to classify roof rock conditions.  In this study, CMRR was also used to assess floor 
conditions.  Roof and floor CMRR contour plots for the entire coal property are presented in Figures 22-25 
to 22-28).  CMRR values were utilized to develop roof support guidelines.  

Potential roof bolt support systems were evaluated using the NIOSH ARBS (Analysis of Roof Bolt 
Systems) software package based on the CMRR, cover depth and mining type (development, retreat and 
single seam vs. multi-seam).  ARBS uses the cover depth to estimate pillar loads and associated roof  

















   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.50 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

support requirements.  To account for increased pillar loading during retreat mining and for stress 
interactions from multi-seam mining, the cover depth input to ARBS was adjusted to simulate the 
different loading conditions.  The NIOSH ARMPS (Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability) program was 
used to determine pillar loads during retreat for expected panel dimensions and retreat sequences.  It 
was found that the pillar loads during retreat were approximately 1.8 times the loads during 
development.  Therefore, the cover depth for retreat mining was increased 1.8 times the actual depth.  
The LAMODEL program was used to model the actual multi-seam configurations to determine the stress 
interactions between the two seams.  It was found that the maximum interaction was about 1.3; thus, 
the cover depths were increased by 1.3 to evaluate bolting requirements in the multi-seam areas.  The 
analysis was conducted for two depth ranges (less than or greater than 106m); however, the depth did 
not significantly influence the selection of the most favorable support systems. 

The multiple combinations of rock quality, depth, mining stage and multiple seam geometry results in a 
possible maximum of 16 separate designs, optimized for each combination.  Many support systems 
provide the required support capacity (ARBS value) for a given combination; therefore the number of 
possible choices was reduced by attempting to use the same bolt types for different mining 
configurations and varying only the bolt spacing to cover the range of required support.  All bolt patterns 
utilize four bolts in each row across the entry.  The bolt cost is primarily related to the volume of steel 
installed; therefore, candidate systems were sorted by steel volume to select the systems having the 
minimum volume (cost) that provided the required support capacity.  Table 22-6 lists the recommended 
roof bolt support systems that resulted from this analysis. 

Other ground support considerations involve secondary roof support, in areas where bolts alone are 
inadequate, and rib support, to control rib slabbing and sloughage.  A large variety of secondary support 
systems, of varying extent could be employed to control different types of adverse ground conditions.  
Some instabilities might be controlled installing additional or longer rod or cable bolts, truss bolts, cable

slings or grout injection.  These techniques have the advantage that they do not obstruct the entries.  
Standing supports are available for almost any application and include wood and concrete cribs, yielding 
and rigid steel posts, yieldable concrete (can) supports, and steel and timber sets.  However, standing 
supports may interfere with equipment movement and would be problematic during pillar retreat 
operations.  It is not expected that routine installation of secondary support would be required, but that 
localized applications may be needed to control unusual situations. 

Rib support, however, may be required routinely to prevent excessive sloughage from blocking 
travelways and to guard against hazardous rib falls from high (> 2.4 m) ribs.  In development-only areas, 
such as mains and deep panels, steel wire mesh can be installed during the bolting cycle using standard 
steel bolts installed in the ribs to both stabilize the rib and hold the mesh in place.  In pillar extraction 
areas, a non-metallic "geo-mesh" installed with non-metallic fiberglass bolts would be preferred so that 
the continuous miner would be able to cut through the supports while extracting pillars and ribs. 

22.4.4  Mining Productivity and Production Forecast 

In developing estimates of mine production, a number of assumptions were made, based on typical 
industry practice, evaluations of site specific geotechnical considerations and seam geometries.  These 
assumptions are summarized below: 

1. The mining labor schedule consists of three 9-hr shifts per day.  Crews for each section will change 
out at the face. 

2. Coal production is scheduled for the day and evening shifts with maintenance/idle work scheduled for 
the night-shift. 

3. The mining method will be room-and-pillar mining, in panels separated by barrier pillars with pillar 
removal where possible.   

4. The mine will be equipped and staffed to operate one single continuous miner section and two walk-
between super continuous miner sections.  The super sections involve two continuous miners and 
crews operating in close proximity in the same panel. 

5. Prevailing adverse mining conditions (seam inclination, low seam height, faults, water, small resource 
areas (pockets), and required rib support in high seam areas) will limit section productivity and 
advance rates to 50 percent of industry averages for similarly staffed and equipped mining units. 

6. Average development cut dimensions are 5.5 m wide with 6m advance (cut depth) before bolting.  
Cutting height ranges from 1.5 m to 3.2 m. 

7. Average development productivity is 30 m/shift for a single continuous miner section and 48 m/shift 
for a walk-between super continuous miner section.  Productivity is 15 m/shift for 3-entry 
development through the more adverse mining conditions and for the initial slope development. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.52 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

8. Pillar extraction productivity is 60 m/shift (equivalent advancement).  

9. Rock slopes between the Seam 150 and Seams 360/340 will be mined at a rate of 10 linear meters of 
tunnel advance per day. 

10. Each unit will initially staff all three shifts simultaneously and production rates will ramp up as 
follows:  25 percent of full production for the first quarter of operation; 50 percent for the second 
quarter; 75 percent for the third quarter and 100 percent after the third quarter. 

22.4.5  Mine Development Sequence by Period 

It is currently projected that after environmental approvals and permitting, initial project development will 
take place in quarters 2-4 of 2012.  This will include development of a portal access boxcut and portal 
entries will be driven in Seam 150 to the first cross cut to allow the fan to be connected and a ventilation 
circuit established.   

Development of the main slope will commence from the portals with a super section at the beginning of 
2013.  Initial development is expected to be slow with both a learning curve for the new crews, and also 
working on steep grades impacting productivity.  After approximately 9 months, the slope will be 
advanced sufficiently to allow the second super section to commence in a production panel on the left 
side of the slope. 

Toward the end of 2013, the slope will be advanced sufficiently to allow the development of rock slope 
access to Seams 360/340 northern district.  This will be done in December of 2013 and the single 
continuous miner section will commence in the 340/360 northern district in January of 2014. 

Once the bottom of the slope is reached, the mine will be developed in both directions to the north and 
the south.  The bulk of the northern district will be completed in 2020, at which time, mining efforts will 
focus in the south. 

As much as possible, the mine is extracted up dip.  The 2009 drilling program and further drilling in 2010 
included pump testing of the strata to determine hydrogeologic properties.  The development of a 
hydrogeologic model for the project area is still ongoing.  Therefore it is unknown at this time what the 
groundwater inflows will be; however, based on experience at Quinsam mine, there will be water inflows 
that must be managed, and based on sampling and analysis from the Raven Project environmental 
baseline studies, and some of the water under greater depth of cover is likely to be saline.  To minimize 
the need for water treatment, it is intended with the updip extraction sequence to leave where possible, 
water behind.  This sequence while developing the mine to its maximum extents early also has the 
potential to simplify ventilation management in respect of mined out areas. 

The production schedule for the Raven Project is summarized in Tables 22-7 and 22-8, and illustrated in 
Figures 22-29 through 22-32.  The ROM tonnes presented include in seam dilution, any rock that must be

of seam dilution material from the roof and floor. 

22.5  Product Coal Quality and Preparation/Process Design 

Product quality projections and for the basis of process design was based primarily on analytical data 
from the 2009 Raven drilling program.  Data from prior exploration programs reviewed as well and that 
information compared with results from the current program.  Small diameter cores provided the basis for 
resource quality estimates and large diameter cores were used for plant design and metallurgical testing.  
Multi-core composites of the small diameter cores were also utilized for metallurgical testing.  Detail on 
the testing and analysis program for product coal quality is contained in Section 16 of this report. 

22.5.1  Product Target Specifications  

The basic target specification for the metallurgical coal product is: 

 10 percent ash (dry basis) 
 ~ 1.2 percent Sulfur (dry basis) 
 ~7.0 percent Moisture as-received 

The basic target specification for the thermal coal product is: 

 15 percent ash (dry basis) 
 ~ 7,000kcal/kg (dry basis) 
 ~ 1.2 percent Sulfur (dry basis) 
 ~ 7.0 percent Moisture as-received 

22.5.2  Preparation/Process Design  

The characteristics of the Raven coal resource and the potential markets drive the plant design.  The key 
coal characteristics are: 

 A majority of the Raven salable product is less than 10 percent ash and less than 1 percent sulfur 
and is, therefore suitable for the metallurgical coal market. 

 A significant percentage of the salable product from processing the Raven feed is middling coal that 
can be used for cement production or blended with better quality coal for the thermal coal market. 

 All of the Raven washed product could be marketed as high-quality thermal coal. 

 At the required plant separating gravities, there is a high percentage of near-gravity material present. 

 There are markets for met coal, steam coal, and industrial coal available to the Raven project. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.59 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

22.5.3 Process Design Considerations  

The potential for making a two-product separation and the percentage of near-gravity material in the 
plant feed dictated a two-stage heavy-medium cyclone circuit for the bulk of the cleaning.  Poor froth 
flotation test performance eliminated the need for costly froth flotation equipment for the plant.  The 
liberation in the 0.60 mm x 0.15 mm size fraction creates the opportunity for producing met coal for this 
size fraction, therefore a two-stage cleaning process consisting of water-only cyclones and spirals was 
selected for fines cleaning. 

The relatively coarse nature of the Raven coal and the absence of an ultra-fines cleaning circuit in the 
process permits the production of a low moisture content product without the need for thermal drying. 
The reject circuitry includes a belt filter press for the thickener underflow, eliminating the need for a 
tailings impoundment on the property.  

22.5.4 Plant Layout  

The plant is arranged to permit the effective use of gravity flow and to allow three products (met coal, 
middlings, reject) to be collected from the process dewatering equipment and sorted to the appropriate 
stockpile based upon product quality. 

The Raven preparation plant will consist of one (1) 363 T/h (tonne/hour) system.  The cleaning process 
includes primary and secondary dense medium cyclones, water-only cyclones, and spirals.  The process 
can produce a primary reject, met coal product, and middlings product.  Ancillary equipment includes 
screens, classifying cyclones, mechanical dryers, pumps, a thickener, and a belt filter press. 

The plant met product conveyor will incorporate a PGNAA on-line ash analyzer to provide real-time 
feedback to the control-room operator for adjusting plant separating gravities. 

The preparation plant is capable of processing a nominal 2.2 MT/y of feed per year operating 6,000 
hours/year.  The maximum annual capacity of the plant is in the range of 2.5 MT/y of feed. 

The plant flow sheet (including mass balance) is shown in Figure 22-33. 

22.5.5 Crushing and Sizing  

Minus 200 mm ROM coal from the slope will be discharged at a rate of up to 800 T/h into a feed chute 
for a rotary breaker.  The feed chute will be furnished with a bypass mechanism to divert mine rock to a 
disposal area when required.  ROM coal from the rotary breaker feed chute will normally be discharged 
onto an inclined grizzly screen with 50 mm spacing between bars.  Undersize material from the grizzly 
screen will discharge onto the rotary breaker collecting conveyor.  Oversize ROM coal reports to the 3.35 
m x 7.31 m rotary breaker with 63.5 mm openings in the breaker plates.  Oversize material passing 
through the rotary breaker will be discharged to the ground for disposal; undersize material from the 
rotary breaker will be discharged to the rotary breaker collecting conveyor. 





   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.61 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

The 50 mm x 0 raw coal from the rotary breaker collecting conveyor will be discharged onto a 0.9 m 
inclined raw coal conveyor that transports and elevates the raw coal to the top of the primary raw coal 
stacking tube.  A transfer chute and diverter gate at the top of the primary raw coal stacking tube 
enables raw coal to be discharged onto the raw coal transfer conveyor, which will transport raw coal to 
the secondary raw coal stacking tube.  The two stacking tubes form stockpiles with capacities of 25,000 
tonnes each and permit segregation raw coal feed based upon the washing characteristics of the feed.  

Each of the stacking tubes is serviced by four (4) 0.9 m raw coal vibrating feeders and a raw coal reclaim 
tunnel.  A single 0.9 m plant feed conveyor receives coal from the vibrating feeders and transports the 
raw coal into the preparation plant at a nominal rate of 363 T/h.  A magnet mounted over the plant feed 
conveyor head-pulley removes tramp metal from the plant feed.  

22.5.6 Coarse Coal Circuit  

Primary Dense Medium Cyclone Circuit 

Raw coal from the plant feed conveyor will be discharged through a chute and into the feed box of 2.9 m 
wide raw coal desliming sieve bend, which removes the majority of the minus 28 m undersize coal from 
the raw feed.  Substantial process water will be added to the raw coal feed ahead of the sieve bend to 
facilitate desliming.  Undersize coal from the sieve bend reports the desliming screen launder and 
oversize coal is discharged onto the 3.05 m x 6.10 m double-deck desliming screen.  The top deck of the 
screen has 10 mm square openings and the bottom deck has 0.6 mm slotted openings.  Undersize coal 
from the bottom deck reports to the desliming screen launder and oversize coal from both decks reports 
to the primary dense medium cyclone sump. 

The 50 mm x 0.6 mm size fraction from the desliming screens is mixed with magnetite medium in a 4:1 
medium:coal ratio and pumped to a single 1.02 m primary dense medium cyclone.  Clean coal from the 
cyclone is discharged to one (1) 3.05 m x 6.10 m double-deck product drain and rinse screen furnished 
with a 2.9 m wide sieve bend.  Medium is drained from the slurry on the sieve bend and the front section 
of the screen.  Adhering medium is rinsed from the clean coal with sprays at the mid-screen section.  The 
concentrated drained medium is returned to the primary dense medium cyclone sump and the rinsed 
medium reports to the primary dilute medium sump.  Clean coal is discharged from the drain and rinse 
screens into the secondary dense medium cyclone sump. 

Reject from the primary dense medium cyclones is discharged to one (1) 2.44 m wide x 4.88 m long 
single-deck reject drain and rinse screen with a 2.29 m sieve bend.  Medium is drained from the reject 
slurry on the sieve bend and the front section of the reject drain and rinse screen.  Adhering medium is 
rinsed from the reject with sprays at the mid-screen section.  The concentrated drained medium is 
returned to the primary dense medium cyclone sump and the rinsed medium reports to the primary dilute 
medium sump.  Dewatered reject is discharged from the drain and rinse screens onto the plant reject 
conveyor. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.62 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Dilute medium from the primary cyclone circuit is pumped to two (2) 0.9 m diameter x 2.44 m long 
magnetic drum separators.  The magnetite concentrate flows by gravity to the primary cyclone sump and 
the separator tailings are utilized as dressing water for the desliming screen. 

Secondary Dense Medium Cyclone Circuit 

The 50 mm x 0.6 mm primary cyclone product is mixed with magnetite medium in a 4:1 medium:coal 
ratio in the secondary dense medium cyclone sump and pumped to a single 838 mm secondary dense 
medium cyclone.  Clean coal from the cyclone is discharged to one (1) 2.44 m x 4.88 m double-deck met 
coal drain and rinse screen furnished with a 2.29 m wide sieve bend.  Medium is drained from the slurry 
on the sieve bend and the front section of the screen.  Adhering medium is rinsed from the met coal with 
sprays at the mid-screen section.  The concentrated drained medium is returned to the secondary dense 
medium cyclone sump and the rinsed medium reports to the secondary dilute medium sump.  Met coal is 
discharged from the drain and rinse screen into one (1) met coal vibrating centrifugal dryer.  Product 
from the dryer is discharged onto the plant met coal conveyor and effluent from the dryer reports to the 
secondary dilute medium sump. 

Middlings from the secondary dense medium cyclones are discharged to the 1.83 m x 4.88 m middlings 
reject drain and rinse screen furnished with a 1.68 m sieve bend.  Medium is drained from the middlings 
slurry on the sieve bend and the front section of the middlings drain and rinse screen.  Adhering medium 
is rinsed from the middlings with sprays at the mid-screen section.  The concentrated drained medium is 
returned to the secondary dense medium cyclone sump and the rinsed medium reports to the secondary 
dilute medium sump.  Dewatered middlings are discharged from the drain and rinse screens into one (1) 
middlings vibrating centrifugal dryer.  Middlings from the dryer are discharged onto the plant middlings 
conveyor and effluent from the dryer reports to the secondary dilute medium sump. 

Dilute medium from the secondary cyclone circuit is pumped to one (1) 0.9 m diameter x 2.44 m long 
magnetic drum separators.  The magnetite concentrate flows by gravity to the secondary cyclone sump 
and the separator tailings are utilized as dressing water for the desliming screen. 

22.5.7 Fine Coal Circuit  

Water-Only Cyclone/Spiral Circuit 

Minus 0.6 mm raw coal fines from the desliming screen report to the water-only cyclone sump.  The 
slurry in the water-only cyclone sump is pumped to one bank of fourteen (14) 254 mm water-only 
cyclones.  The underflow from the water-only cyclones is diluted to the correct solids content and flows 
by gravity to the distributor for one-bank of four (4) triple-start coal spirals.  The overflow from the 
water-only cyclones flows by gravity to the classifying cyclone sump. 

Clean coal from the spiral separation flows by gravity to classifying cyclone sump.  Spiral reject flows by 
gravity to a 1.83 m x 3.66 m reject dewatering screen.  Undersize effluent from the screen reports to the 
Thickener and oversize reject is discharged onto the plant reject conveyor. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.63 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Fine clean coal slurry in the classifying cyclone sump is pumped to one (1) bank of three (3) 381 mm ø 
classifying cyclones that make a size separation at 100M.  Minus 100 M overflow from the cyclones 
reports by gravity flow to the thickener and 28 M x 100 M cyclone underflow is diluted with water and 
further deslimed using one (1) 4-deck stacksizer screen.  Effluent from the stacksizer reports to the 
thickener and oversize product is discharged to 0.9 m diameter x 1.8 m screenbowl centrifuge.  The 
mechanically dried coal from the screenbowl centrifuge is discharged onto the met coal conveyor and the 
centrate and filtrate from the centrifuge reports to the thickener. 

The 18.3 m diameter thickener receives fine reject material from the preparation plant and with the use 
of chemical flocculants, clarifies the plant process water for reuse and concentrates the solids content of 
the fine settled sludge.  Thickener underflow is pumped to one (1) 3.0 m belt filter press where further 
additional consolidation of solids takes place.  Filter cake from the belt filter press is discharged onto the 
plant reject conveyor and filtrate from the belt filter press reports to the thickener.  

22.5.8  Product Coal Handling  

Met coal from the plant is analyzed for ash and sulfur using an on-line PGNAA analyzer and is transported 
by conveyor to the clean coal radial stockpile.  Met coal can be sorted for quality by shift based on the 
analyzer readings.  

Coal from the radial stockpiles is moved by front-end loader to a feed hopper and conveyed to one of two 
50,000 tonne stockpiles depending on coal quality.  The product stockpile arrangement allows coal of 
varying quality to be blended to prepare both metallurgical quality and thermal quality products for 
shipment. 

22.5.9  Refuse/Tailings Handling  

Plant reject is conveyed overland to the Reject Disposal Area where the reject is discharged by a radial 
stacker and is spread and compacted by a bulldozer. 

22.5.10  Recommendations  

If it is determined the Raven plant can economically produce a single product, either met coal or thermal 
coal, there are considerable capital and operating cost savings to be had by eliminating the process 
equipment and material handling equipment to clean, sort and blend multiple products. 

The fine tailings disposal concept for the plant is also an area where there is potential for capital and 
operating cost savings. Underground injection or impoundment of thickener underflow is usually less 
costly that processing with a belt filter press.

22.6  Facilities and Infrastructure 

The project is a Greenfield development and will require the development or upgrading of existing 
facilities and infrastructure.  This section will address the facilities and infrastructure on site other than 
preparation plant and coal handling described previously.  A separate section will address the port 
infrastructure development required to enable the export of coal. 

22.6.1  Local Resources and Infrastructure  

The project area lies in close proximity to the east coast of Vancouver Island adjacent to the Inland 
Island Highway (BC Provincial Highway 19), which between Campbell River to the north and Nanaimo to 
the south is a 4 lane controlled access, divided highway.  The eastern edge of the project area overlaps 
this highway, but no mining will take place under or in close proximity to the highway.  Access to the 
highway exists at the Buckley Bay Main, which is a major arterial road within the project area, and also 
provides access to the community of Buckley Bay.  A BC Ferry service operated between Buckley Bay and 
nearby Denman Island.  Approximately 4km south of Buckley Bay and still adjacent to the project area is 
the larger community of Fanny Bay. 

More or less parallel and to the east of the Inland Island Highway adjacent to the project area is a major 
BC Transmission Corporation (BCTC) 138 kV transmission line.   

Further east still is the Southern Railway of Victoria Island (formerly the Esquimalt and Nanaimo) rail 
corridor.  The line is owned by the Island Corridor Foundation and operated under contract by Southern 
Rail.  The line runs from Victoria to Courtenay, with branch lines from Parksville to Port Alberni and from 
just south of Nanaimo to the Southern Rail main rail yard and car float slip (dock) on the Nanaimo 
waterfront.  Southern Rail provides rail freight services to various customers on Vancouver Island offering 
connections to the continental railway network. The company also operates daily inter-city passenger 
service from Victoria to Courtenay on behalf of VIA Rail Canada, Inc.  The line has been in service for 
over 120 years, and would require significant rehabilitation to serve as a line for standard coal haulage. 

Larger population centers nearby include: 

 Courtenay/Comox, 25 km to the north with a combined population of approx. 34,000, 
 Campbell River, 81 km to the north with a population of approx. 30,000, 
 Parksville, 51 km to the south with a population of approx 11,000, and 
 Nanaimo, 81 km to the south with a population of approx 79,000. 

The closest airport with commercial service is the Comox Valley Airport approx 34 km to the north.  This 
airport provides both light aircraft service to the mainland and other areas, as well as daily jet service to 
Calgary and Edmonton. 

The closest major hospitals are located in Campbell River (Campbell River & District General Hospital) and 
Nanaimo (Nanaimo Regional General Hospital). 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.65 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

22.6.2  Site Development  

Site development will include: 

 Acquisition of land necessary for construction of surface facilities. 

 Establishment of a security gate and employee parking lot adjacent to the Buckley Bay Main and just 
off Highway 19. 

 Minor upgrading of approximately 2.6 km of the Holiday Main. 

 Completion of a southbound access ramp onto Highway 19 at the intersection with the Holiday Main. 

 Upgrades, realignment and construction of roads in the facilities area. 

 A substation connection to the BCTC transmission line and construction of 5.1km 138kV transmission 
line along the Holiday Main to the facilities area. 

 Establishment of drainage control around the facilities area. 

Access to the site will be via the Buckley Bay Main which is a controlled access logging road, connecting 
to Highway 19.  From the exit point on highway 19, the distance travelled on existing two lane logging 
roads is approximately 7.6 km.  As listed above, a security gate/checkpoint will be established just off 
Highway 19 and an employee parking lot developed adjacent to the logging road.  This will be a staging 
point from which the majority of the workforce will be transported to the mine facilities area by bus.  This 
will minimize traffic congestion on the logging roads.  Staff and coal haulage contractor personnel will be 
trained and have vehicles equipped with the necessary radio equipment so as to be able to travel on the 
roads unaccompanied.  Delivery vehicles if regular may like the coal haulage contractor be equipped with 
necessary radio equipment and the drivers trained.  Irregular deliveries and visitors will be accompanied 
to the facilities area. 

The project area layout, including access roads and location of site facilities is shown in Figure 22-34. 

22.6.3  Buildings  

A number of buildings have been planned including: 

Warehouse Building 

This building is typical for the type of supplies needed for an underground mine.  It is expected that this 
will be adequate for plant supplies as well, under single warehouse management.  Plant operations will 
likely require a short term supply in the plant for frequently used parts and supplies. 





   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.67 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Maintenance Shop 

This facility would be located adjacent to the warehouse and provide 3 bays sized appropriately for 
servicing and routine repairs to the underground and surface equipment fleet.  Major overhauls will be 
done offsite. 

Wash Bay 

This facility would be located close by the maintenance shop for preparing equipment to undergo repair 
and maintenance. 

Administrative Offices 

Current design is a generic footprint that can be partitioned as needed. 

Change House 

A conceptual layout with lockers for 240 men and 10 women is shown, typical for an underground mine.  
A separate facility may be included with the plant, since the baskets for underground clothing and special 
equipment rooms are not needed. 

Covered Bulk Storage 

This is a typical feature of underground mines, situated near the portal for ready access by the mining 
team and maintenance.  Currently only one such building is proposed, but there may be more particularly 
at Raven where weather protection is an important consideration for mine supplies. 

Hazmat Building 

This building provides temporary control for a wide variety of mining chemicals and materials that require 
collection and possible treatment prior to off-site disposal at established sites. 

Resin Storage 

This facility provides the necessary segregation and climate control for storage of ground control resins. 

Compressor Building 

This building provides for operation and routine compressor maintenance operations.  It will be located, 
above the portal entries.  Receivers will be located ahead of the mine entry and at shops on the surface.  
This system will be sized for the mine requirements.  Independent systems are included in the 
preparation plant and maintenance shops with this main plant serving as a back-up reserve. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.68 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Other surface facilities include the mine fans, dewatering and mine supply water systems, water supply 
pump stations and tanks, fuel and lubricant storage, waste water treatment (including sanitary wastes), 
and rock dust system. 

22.7  Marketing and Coal Sales  

Compliance Energy anticipates producing two types of coal from the Raven Project: a high volatile 
metallurgical coal and a high volatile thermal product.  Specifications for the metallurgical and thermal 
product are shown in Table 22-9 and 22-10, respectively.

Virtually all the Raven Project coal will be sold into Asian and other Pacific Rim seaborne markets that are 
currently enjoying strong demand growth due to rapid electrification and infrastructure development.  
The Raven coal will be loaded into ocean going vessels at Port Alberni, British Columbia.  Port Alberni will 
be able to accommodate so-called "Panamax" vessels of roughly 70,000t capacity.  At the current time, 
Compliance Energy does not anticipate that Port Alberni will develop the capability to load larger vessels 
such as roughly 130,000 – 150,000t "Cape" size vessels.  The inability to load Cape size vessels at Port 
Alberni will cause a freight disadvantage.1    

As discussed in more detail in Section 22.8.2.1 below, the most advantageous markets for the Raven coal 
are in northeast Asia, primarily Japan and Korea.  As shown in Table 22-11, these markets are 
significantly closer to Port Alberni than other markets in China, Taiwan, or India.  The Raven coal also 
enjoys relatively shorter distances to South American markets on the west coast of Mexico and Chile. 

22.7.1  Coal Prices and Marketing Options  

Compliance retained Wood Mackenzie, a well known and respected coal consulting firm, to provide price 
forecasts for both the metallurgical and thermal coal products.  Wood Mackenzie produced three reports: 
A Metallurgical Price Forecast, a Sulfur-Adjusted Metallurgical Price Forecast, and a Thermal Price 
Forecast.  These reports are attached as Appendices A, B, and C, respectively.  Figure 22-35 summarizes 
the Wood Mackenzie results.2          

As can be seen in Figure 22-35, Wood Mackenzie uses prices for commonly traded Australian 
metallurgical and thermal coals as references for its forecasts of prices for the Raven coals.  Three such 
reference prices are shown in Figure 22-35: an Australian premium hard coking coal (HCC), an Australian 
(New South Wales) Semi-Soft Coking Coal (NSW SSCC), and an Australian thermal coal shipped from the  

                                                
1 Ocean freight rates are notoriously volatile, making a reliable, long-term forecast of the freight differential between Panamax and Cape size vessel 

rates difficult.  In September 2010, this differential is approximately $7.60 per tonne.  (Source: Platts International Coal Report, September 13, 2010 

edition.) 
2 As is conventional in the international seaborne coal trade, prices are quoted in U.S. dollars per metric tonne ($US/tonne).  A metric tonne is 1,000 

kilograms or 2,204.62 pounds avoirdupois.

New South Wales port of Newcastle (Newcastle).  As can also be seen in Figure 22-35, Wood Mackenzie 
characterizes the Raven metallurgical product as essentially similar to the NSW SSCC, notwithstanding 
some characteristics that are more typical of the HCC product.  Wood Mackenzie also forecasts that the 
Raven thermal product will closely track the price of the Newcastle reference coal.   

Accurate price forecasts are extremely difficult.  Wood Mackenzie uses the most theoretically sound 
methodology for its forecasts, which generally equate long term prices to long term marginal costs.  
While this method is economically sound, it depends on accurate forecasts of long term, worldwide costs, 
both for existing operations and for greenfield projects, which in turn are based on numerous 
assumptions that may not be eventually realized.  As a result, the price cost forecasts shown in Figure 
22-35 may also not be realized.  Finally, Wood Mackenzie stresses, and PAH concurs, that cycles and 
volatility will occur around the general price trends shown in Figure 22-35.   

Metallurgical  

Wood Mackenzie uses an extensive data base of seaborne metallurgical coal specifications to characterize 
the Raven metallurgical product.  The Raven specifications generally fall well within the parameters for 
Australian SSCC.3  Low reflectance, low fluidity, and poor expansion characteristics preclude 
characterizing Raven as a premium HCC that can realize the relatively higher prices associated with this 
product.   

Compared to the 2010 price of $240 per tonne for the reference Australian HCC product, PAH notes that 
the current price for this coal is approximately $195 per tonne,4 significantly below the average 2010 
Wood Mackenzie price and also well below the 2011 Wood Mackenzie forecast, notwithstanding the fact 
that Wood Mackenzie forecasts a significant price decline from 2010 to 2011, to $220 per tonne. 

Thermal  

As shown in Figure 22-35, the Wood Mackenzie price forecast for the Raven thermal coal product is 
virtually identical to its forecast for the Newcastle thermal coal.  As shown in Table 22-10, the Raven coal 
is a 6,479kcal/kg, 1.16 percent sulfur product on a "gross as received" ("GAR") basis.  The Newcastle 
product is a 6,322kcal/kg, 0.8 percent sulfur product.  Wood Mackenzie recognized that Raven thermal 
coal would compete not only with Newcastle thermal coal, but other thermal coals as well.  As a result, it 
used an average of the delivered prices for a number of thermal coals as the basis for its Raven forecast.  
Wood Mackenzie also incorporated a freight differential into its forecast.  This freight differential is the 
result of the geographic proximity of Port Alberni to target markets.  Hence, although the Raven thermal 
coal price forecast is nearly identical to the Newcastle forecast, its congruence is not the result of simply 
forecasting the two as the same, but rather results from several competing factors that largely cancel 
each other. 

                                                
3 See Raven Coal Project Metallurgical Price Forecast, Final Report dated June 30, 2010, page 8. 
4 Source: Platts International Coal Report, September 20, 2010 edition.  The specifications for the Platts reference coal may not be identical to the 

specifications for the Woods Mackenzie reference product. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.72 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Compared to the 2010 price of $98.00 per tonne for the Newcastle reference coal, PAH notes that the 
current price for this coal is $95.00 per tonne.5    

PCI  

In recent years, the market for coals used in Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) applications has moved 
towards semi-anthracite, i.e., higher rank, low volatile coals.  As a high volatile coal with relatively higher 
sulfur content, Raven coal is not ideally situated for this market.  As shown in Figure 22-35, Wood 
Mackenzie does not forecast that PCI coals will enjoy much, if any, premium over thermal coals.  For 
Raven, eschewing the PCI market with its tighter specifications and more draconian penalties for off-
specification product and instead concentrating on the thermal coal market appears to be a better 
strategic fit. 

22.7.2  Marketability  

Despite increasing demand over the last several years and resultant price increases, the market for 
international seaborne coal is inherently competitive.  Sustained demand growth, along with depletion of 
the most readily mineable reserves, underlies the generally increasing Wood Mackenzie price forecasts.  
Moreover, while the Raven metallurgical and thermal coal products have generally acceptable 
specifications, they are not without characteristics, particularly relatively higher sulfur content, that 
buyers will use to pressure pricing.  Hence, while PAH does not see any fatal flaws that would preclude or 
significantly inhibit the marketability of the Raven coal, it cautions that the markets into which this coal is 
placed will remain strongly competitive. 

Coal prices, and, indirectly, coal marketability, are significantly correlated with foreign exchange rates.  
Because international seaborne coals are priced in U.S. dollars, while most costs are incurred in local 
currencies, a weak U.S. dollar tends to increase the price of seaborne coals and allow non-U.S. producers 
to capture higher margins.  If, or more probably, when, the U.S. dollar strengthens from its current, 
relatively low, level, international seaborne coal prices will likely decrease.  To the extent that an increase 
in the value of the U.S. dollar occurs in both Canadian and Australian currencies, the relative 
marketability of the Raven coal should not be greatly affected.  However, a strengthening Canadian dollar 
coupled with a weakening Australian dollar could be problematic.   

Logistics and Pricing Considerations 

Table 22-11 shows the distances from Port Alberni to major coal markets in the Pacific Rim, as well as 
the distances from competing producing regions in Australia and Indonesia. 

                                                
5 ibid. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.73 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

(Miles)6 

As can be seen in Table 22-11, Port Alberni is closer to markets in northern Asia, particularly Japan and 
Korea, than it is to markets in Taiwan, mainland China, and India.  Compared to the distances from 
Australia to Japan and Korea, the Raven coal also enjoys an absolute distance advantage.  Port Alberni is 
closer than other Pacific Rim sources to markets in South and Central America, although Colombian and 
Venezuelan coals traversing through the Panama Canal are relatively closer.  All other factors being 
equal, therefore, the natural markets for Raven coal are northern Asia, i.e., Japan and Korea, and Central 
and South America.  Other potential markets, including China, Taiwan, and, especially, India, suffer from 
significant logistical hurdles compared to alternative sources of coal.   

As noted above, however, Port Alberni cannot accommodate the most efficient ocean going bulk 
transports, the large Cape sized vessels.  At the current time, rates in Cape size vessels from Vancouver, 
British Columbia ports to Japan are about $7.60 per tonne less than the rates in the Panamax vessels 
that Port Alberni can accommodate.  While this cost differential will fluctuate, it will always prove a 
detriment to Raven pricing and may result in lower FOBT (freight on board, trimmed) prices than forecast 
by Wood Mackenzie.   

Offsite Costs  

International seaborne coal is generally sold on an FOBT basis, which means that the producer is 
responsible for all costs until the coal is loaded onto the vessel at the port of origination.  Buyers are 
generally responsible for chartering vessels and for all costs associated with off-loading and further 
shipping.  This practice means that Compliance will be responsible for all costs associated with producing 
the coal, transporting it to Port Alberni, storing it at the dock, and loading it into the vessels.  In addition 
to the obvious cost components, ancillary costs including coal sampling and analysis, weighing, export 
licenses and/or customs charges (if necessary), and wharfage, dockage, and berthing charges may add 
to the shipper's costs.  The last of these charges are usually governed by port-specific tariffs. 

In addition to these typical expenses, delays in loading the vessel once it has been accepted by the 
shipper can be very expensive.  Such delays often result in additional charges, known as "demurrage",

which can run thousands of dollars per day of delay.  In order to preclude such charges, the shipper 
should maintain sufficient inventory at the port well in advance of the vessel's arrival.    

Losses  

Physical coal losses are unusual and are not expected to have a material impact on the Raven project. 

Insurance  

As noted above, the shipper generally retains title to the coal until it is loaded onto the vessel.  Risk of 
loss generally follows title, i.e., if coal is somehow lost prior to loading, the shipper bears the expense.  
PAH recommends that Raven's overall insurance coverage include the cost of insuring against damage or 
loss at the port or in transit to the port. 

Marketing Agents  

Marketing agents or trading companies are commonly used in the international coal trade.  Compliance 
participants ITOCHU and LG are recognized and capable coal marketing agents.  Given their equity 
participation in the project, PAH anticipates that they will fill this role in Japanese and Korean markets, 
respectively.  In addition, ITOCHU and LG likely have regional offices in other potential market areas.     

22.8  Logistics and Port Facilities  

PAH engaged the firm KPFF to assist with the port facilities, particularly in relation to the general 
evaluation of port options, rail transportation and where necessary, design of wharf and shiploading 
facilities. 

22.8.1  Coal Transportation to Port 

A number of options were considered for the transportation of coal from the mine to port.  The base case 
is to use a similar approach to that taken by the nearby Quinsam mine where coal is hauled over the road 
in Super "B" Train belly dump highway trucks as a contract operation.  The use of trucks provides great 
flexibility in meeting the volume requirements, considering a range of alternative routes and effectively 
can reach any port location on Vancouver Island.   

The primary alternative is the use of rail transport.  The existing railway which is adjacent to the mine  
and owned by the Island Corridor Foundation and operated by Southern Railway of Vancouver Island 
extends north to Courtenay, south to Nanaimo (southern most port option considered), and has a spur 
line to Port Alberni from Parksville.  Effectively, the only option the rail can serve directly is Port Alberni.  
The potential to use the existing Westshore coal export facility at Roberts Bank was considered with coal 
delivered by rail, where the rail cars would be transported by barge from a facility near Nanaimo was 
considered, but economics and capacity constraints at Westshore make this option unattractive.  The rail 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.75 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

does not directly access the Duke Point facility discussed below, nor does it serve the various port options 
to the north of Courtenay. 

Another intermodal option was considered with coal being trucked to the barge loading facility used by 
Quinsam at Middle Point, then barged to either Texada Island or to Westshore.  The economics of the 
rehandling of the coal and the additional cost of barging the coal to the final port destination are not 
favorable. 

A number of trucking contractors exist capable of providing the required service.  To date, four different 
companies have expressed interest in the business and the cost estimates used in the current study are 
based on pricing provided by three of these firms. 

It is envisioned that truck transportation would involve road legal B-Train vehicles.  Each vehicle is 
capable of carrying a payload of 42 tonnes of coal.  The loads are covered to minimize loss of coal and 
dust along the route.  Coal hauling operations are expected to be a 7 day/24 hour activity. 

22.8.2  Port Location Considerations  

In collaboration with Compliance Energy, a variety of considerations were identified that were considered 
significant in evaluating each port location and comparing the various locations.  The following 
considerations were used to evaluate and screen the port locations: 

 Transportation:  Proximity to the mine site, ship travel time from the port to Asia, the potential to use 
railroad hauling between the mine and the port, and the risk of weather delays. 

 Berthing:  The existence of a Panamax berth, adequate Panamax water depth, berthing conditions, 
and available equipment (tugs, etc.) to assist berthing. 

 Upland area:  Availability of 4 hectares or more. 

 Environmental:  Potential environmental concerns and community objections.   

Port sites at Buckley Bay, Duke Point, Gold River, Menzies Bay, Middle Point, Port Alberni and Tyee Spit 
(Campbell River) were investigated, visited and compared to one another.  The work relied heavily on 
available existing information, observations made during site visits and the insights of professional staff 
with port-related experience.   

Following the consideration and comparison of all port alternatives, it was concluded that the two most 
promising alternatives are Port Alberni and Duke Point.  These two alternatives were then considered 
further.  Conclusions regarding those two alternatives are described hereinafter.

Port Alberni  

The Port Alberni Port Authority (PAPA) offered to make the existing wharf at Berths 1 and 2 and adjacent 
uplands available for vessel berthing/loading and coal storage respectively.  The wharf is approximately 
320m long and most of it was constructed in the 1950s using timber piling, timber caps and concrete 
deck panels.   

PAPA provided a wharf condition report authored by Hay & Company Consultants and dated March 2008.  
The report identifies that the majority of the wharf structure is in satisfactory condition, except for 
several relatively small areas requiring pile and deck repairs.  Additionally, the report states "…Analysis 
has determined that the Berth structure as a whole does not meet these code requirements for seismic 
resistance.  In order to meet these requirements, the entire structure would have to be modified at great 
cost…"  We concur with the foregoing statement. 

To avoid the significant cost of seismic upgrade of the entire wharf structure, a conceptual design for the 
coal loader support structure was developed that isolated the new support structure from the existing 
wharf structure.  The result of this isolation is the new support structure is independent from the wharf 
structure and does not diminish the lateral capacity of the existing wharf structure. 

PAPA also provided a bathymetric survey for Berths 1 and 2 accomplished by AquaCoustic Remote 
Technologies Inc., and dated May 10, 2006.  That survey reflects depths of 6-8 m at the north end of 
Berth 2, approximately 10m near the center, and 12-14 m at the south end of Berth 1.  Depths less than 
12 m are inadequate for Panamax vessels.  Consequently, it was concluded that the vessel should be 
positioned toward the southern end of Berths 1 and 2 and dredge the berth as required to provide 12 m 
depth. 

A conceptual design was developed and an estimate of the probable construction cost for that design was 
prepared. 

Duke Point  

Island Timberlands offered to lease a portion of their property on Duke Point southeast of Nanaimo, BC.  
The property formerly housed a lumber mill and has a small dock (137m long) that supported the mill 
operation. 

Island Timberlands stated that no drawings are available for the existing dock.  They shared anecdotal 
information that the dock was constructed using concrete caissons filled with rock mined from the site.  
They provided a bathymetric drawing, dated September 7, 1993, reflecting water depths of 9.9-10.5 m 
along the western half of the dock face and 10.7-13.4 m along the eastern half of the dock face. 

Bedrock is visible at the surface on the upland property.  In an attempt to determine the depth to 
bedrock in the berth along the north side of the dock, divers were retained to probe the surface at 
several locations along the dock face.  They were able to probe to depths varying from 0.2 m to 1.5 m 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.77 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

before meeting refusal.  Unfortunately, the results did not confirm, with certainty, whether bedrock 
caused refusal for the probe. 

Based upon the anecdotal information, observation of the visible portions of the dock, and the feedback 
from the divers, it was hypothesized that the dock is comprised of a series of 15.2 m x 21.3 m concrete 
box caissons that were floated into position atop a bed of quarry spalls and filled with rock.  If this 
hypothesis is correct, the material causing refusal to the divers probe could be quarry spalls, rather than 
bedrock, and it may be possible to dredge to Panamax depth.  Nevertheless, considerable uncertainty still 
exists regarding existing conditions and what can be constructed. 

A conceptual design was developed and an estimate of the probable construction cost for that design was 
prepared. 

Recommendations  

It was recommended and approved by Compliance Energy to focus preliminary design efforts on the Port 
Alberni site.  The existing wharf structure at Port Alberni and its superior suitability, as compared to the 
Duke Point dock structure, highly influenced the recommendation.  Additionally, it was concluded that the 
risk related to unanticipated conditions is larger for Duke Point due to the larger amount of uncertainty 
regarding existing conditions and what can be constructed.   

22.8.3  Port Facilities  

Preliminary design has been accomplished for export facilities located on PAPA property.  PAPA has 
offered the use of Berths 1 and 2 which includes approximately 320 m of wharf.  The existing wharf was 
constructed in increments and is comprised of timber, timber and concrete, and concrete sections.  
According to reference documents provided by PAPA, the oldest portions of the wharf were constructed 
in 1955 and the most recent portions were completed in 1983. 

Design Criteria 

Vessel Criteria 

The berthing and loading facilities have been designed to accommodate Panamax bulk coal vessels with 
characteristics as shown in Table 22-12.

Bathymetry 

Bathymetry furnished by PAPA and prepared by AquaCoustic Remote Technologies, Inc in May 2006 was 
used for this study.  It shows that water depths increase rather significantly from north to south along 
the length of Berths 1 and 2 and waterward from the face of the wharf.  Water depths along the face of 
the wharf vary from approximately 6m at the north end to approximately 13 m at the south end.   

More recent and detailed bathymetry will be required if the project proceeds to final design and 
construction. 

Geotechnical 

The firm Hart Crowser was engaged to assist with port geotechnical investigations.  Hart Crowser 
advanced several geotechnical borings for the purpose of investigating the site geology and providing 
preliminary geotechnical engineering recommendations for the berthing and loading facilities.  Generally, 
the existing wharf is founded on the following geologic formations, in descending order: 

 a layer of soft silt 
 a layer of medium dense to very dense, sandy gravel to gravelly sand 
 a layer of stiff to hard, sandy, gravelly silt/clay 
 weathered and unweathered granite bedrock 

Additional geotechnical investigation and analysis will be required if the project proceeds to final design 
and construction. 

Tidal Range 

The project site experiences a significant tidal range as shown in Table 22-13. 

 

Design Life 

The proposed design life for the berthing and loading facilities is 30 years.

Seismic 

The seismic force resisting system is divided into two sections with a seismic isolation joint at wharf 
gridline 17. 

In the main portion of the wharf, north of gridline 17, the new concrete structure has fixed connections 
to new steel pipe piling.  The new concrete beams are independent and isolated from the existing timber 
wharf structure.  

In the east-west direction, battered steel pipe piling provide lateral support to the concrete crosstie 
beams.  In the north-south direction, lateral support is provided by moment frames.  The bases of the 
pipe piles develop fixity though skin friction with the silt sand/gravels and the underlying very dense 
cobbles/weathered granite bedrock.  At battered piling, where sufficient tension capacity cannot be 
obtained due to hard-driving conditions, high-strength steel anchor rods will be drilled through the piles 
and grouted into the granite bedrock. 

At the existing concrete wharf, south of gridline 17, the new concrete beams are laterally supported by 
the existing battered concrete piles.  The existing concrete piles are assumed to develop fixity though 
skin friction (similar to above).  Since no plans are available for this existing structure, this construction 
was assumed to be similar to that of Berth 3, which was constructed in a similar period and manner, 
according to PAPA.  The Berth 3 plans show bearing piles with an estimated penetration of 7.6 m.  

The seismic design complies with the 2006 BC Building Code and the Highway Bridge Design Code, CSA-
S6-06. 

The Modal Response Spectrum analysis used the following mapped spectral response accelerations taken 
from the 2005 National Building Code Seismic Hazard Calculation (with a 2 percent probability of 
exceedance in 50 years): 

 Sa(0.2) = 0.767 
 Sa(0.5) = 0.575 
 Sa(1.0) = 0.307 
 Sa(2.0) = 0.161 

The Basic Seismic Force Resisting Systems (BCBC 2006 4.1.8.9): 

 Moderately Ductile Moment-resisting Frame (north-south) 
 Rd * Ro = 5.25, T = 1.25, 1,960kN base shear 
 Moderately Ductile Concentrically Braced Frames - Chevron Braces (east-west) 
 Rd * Ro = 3.9, T = 0.3, 5,020kN base shear 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.80 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Seismic studies were conducted showing that the shiploader's approximate period (T = 2.5 sec), which is 
out-of-phase with the wharf structure, tends to dampen the structural oscillation and reduce the seismic 
base shear of the wharf.  Therefore, this mass was considered non-concurrent with the wharf mass. 

The analysis included a 1.0 seismic importance factor and Site Class D. 

Coal Handling and Storage  

Using contracted truck transportation as the preferred option, Highways 19 and 4 will be used to 
transport the coal from the mine site.  Coal will be delivered to the port in Super "B" Train belly dump 
highway trucks.  This is a twin trailer arrangement and the overall length including the tractor will be 
approximately 25 m.  The total capacity of both trailers combined is 53.5 m3 with a net weight of 
approximately 42,000 kg of product.  These trucks are similar in size and weight to other trucks currently 
using Highways 19 and 4.  All trucks will be covered by tarps to prevent fugitive dust while travelling. 
Since these are bottom dump units there is very little dust generated while unloading.  Figure 22-36 
shows the proposed location of the entryway to the Port of Port Alberni.  This route is currently used 
extensively by trucks serving other industries and facilities on the Alberni Inlet, including the PAPA 
facility.  Alternatives that reduce the presence of truck traffic on city roads that may be available are 
under review. 

Highway trailers will be emptied into a drive-over hopper with a trash grate.  The truck unloading area 
will include approach room for turning and holding trucks.  To further ensure control of fugitive dust and 
noise, it is proposed that the truck unloading station will be a covered structure with dust collection 
equipment. 

Vibrating feeders under the hopper will deliver coal to the first belt conveyor.  This conveyor will 
transport coal to the storage buildings.  The conveyors from the hopper to the coal storage buildings will 
have a capacity of 400 tph.  All conveyors within the facility will be covered to minimize noise and fugitive 
dust emissions.  

Covered storage will help reduce noise, eliminate dust and erosion losses and preserve coal quality.  Both 
dome and elongated shed structures are currently under consideration.  It is intended that there would 
be storage for up to 80,000t, adequate to hold a full cargo for larger Panamax vessels. 

A reclaim system will deliver coal via covered conveyor from each building to the shiploader feed 
conveyor.  The reclaim system and conveyors delivering coal to the shiploader will have a capacity of 
2,000 tph. 

Coal Handling & Loading Equipment  

A traveling gantry shiploader of 2,000 tph loadout capacity is proposed for this project.  This shiploader is 
mounted on rails and travels along the length of the berth as described above.  Cross-ship spout  





   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.82 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

positioning is provided by a moving shuttle conveyor which carries the spout.  The over-ship loading 
boom is able to luff, or raise up, to clear above-deck ship structures, such as hatch cranes, etc.  The 
shiploader spout is telescoping, allowing the spout to be very close to the hatch pile as a means of dust 
control.  These shiploaders are generally considered to have the highest amount of flexibility relative to 
vessel type and high load-out production rates due to their ability to completely cover rectangular hatch 
areas. 

Coal to be shipped is reclaimed from storage and loaded onto a dockside conveyor that runs the full 
length of the shiploader travel, on the land side of the land side rail.  Coal is transferred from the 
dockside conveyor to the shiploader by a tripper mechanism that rides on rails attached to the dockside 
conveyor support structure, and is towed by the shiploader as it travels. 

The dockside conveyor and shiploader will be equipped with dust control systems to prevent fugitive dust 
migration.  The dockside conveyor will be enclosed and the enclosure equipped with a "zipper duct" 
opening for the tripper loader to the shiploader.  All points of potential dust creation, such as conveyor 
transfers and loaders, will have negative pressure dust control systems to gather fugitive dust.  Exhaust 
air will be passed through a baghouse type filter, and collected dust will be returned to the shipping 
stream via a rotary air lock at the bottom of the filter. 

The shiploader can be operated from a control cab or from the deck of the vessel being loaded.  In either 
mode, a programmable logic controller (PLC) will manage operations to assure proper sequencing and 
monitor safety interlocks.  Through the PLC, a slowdown or stop in loading rate will slow or stop loading 
of the dockside conveyor in a logical sequence to prevent plugs or spills.  Similarly a shiploader PLC 
command to begin loading will lock-out operation of the storage reclaim conveyor until all necessary 
dockside conveyor and shiploader systems are running. 

Medium voltage electrical power will be supplied to the shiploader at a connection box at the midpoint of 
the travel range along the dock.  A cable reel on the shiploader carries a length of cable equal to just 
over one half the travel distance and pays out or takes in cable as required.  460 V 3-phase power will be 
supplied to the dockside conveyor at its head (south) end.  Total connected load of all shiploader and 
dockside conveyor systems is estimated at 550 kW. 

In addition to the gantry travel-drive brakes, the shiploader will be equipped with rail brakes or other 
means to secure it for stowage in high winds. 

Berthing & Loading Facilities 

The ship will likely be positioned with the bow facing southward for ease of departure.  Additionally, the 
ship will be located as far south in Berths 1 and 2 as possible to minimize dredging – existing berth 
depths diminish significantly near the north end of Berths 1 and 2. 

A condition assessment, done for PAPA by Hay & Company Consultants in March 2008, identified that the 
entire existing timber wharf structure would have to be modified at great cost to meet code requirements 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.83 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

for seismic resistance.  To avoid adding that cost to the cost of this project, the proposed berthing and 
loading facilities have been designed to be structurally separate from the existing timber wharf.  The 
existing wharf structure is not being degraded nor upgraded by this project. 

The shiploader will be rail-mounted on a new support structure comprised of concrete crane rail beams 
and large diameter, steel pipe piles extending down to bedrock.  Lateral capacity to resist berthing, 
mooring and seismic loads will be provided by battered, large diameter, steel pipe piles attached to the 
support structure and extending down to bedrock.  Installation of rock anchors may be required to 
provide sufficient uplift capacity in the piling.  The new support structure will be located within the 
footprint of the existing timber wharf.  The shiploader will span 17 m between rails and travel 
longitudinally along the full length of the vessel, approximately 235 m. 

Four new breasting dolphins will be constructed along the outboard face of the existing wharf to position 
the ships 9.1m beyond the wharf face.  This will minimize the dredging requirement since the existing 
bathymetry progressively deepens beyond the wharf face.  

A new mooring dolphin will be constructed approximately 29 m south of the south end of the existing 
wharf.  The dolphin will be comprised of a large mooring bollard mounted atop a large concrete cap 
supported by battered steel pipe piles.  Additional mooring bollards, with 100 t capacity, will be added at 
several locations along the length of the wharf. 

The existing timber fender piles will be removed and a new fendering system, comprised of steel pipe 
piles and rubber fender elements, will be constructed several feet off the face of the wharf. 

Water depths increase rather significantly from north to south along the length of Berths 1 and 2 and 
waterward from the face of the wharf.  However, limited dredging will be required within a relatively 
narrow band along the face of the wharf.  Depth of dredging will vary from 0 to 2.5m. 

Plan and cross section views of the wharf configuration and the shiploader are shown in Figures 22-37 
and 22-38.

that water inflows will likely be less than the nearby Quinsam mine, but that some of the inflows will 
require treatment due to elevated salinity.  The estimate included is for a reverse osmosis treatment 
plant capable of treating up to 454 m3/hr and will be installed in two phases, an initial 227 m3/hr plant in 
2013 and the remainder in 2017 (year 5 of production).  This represents a large capital item and 
currently has significant uncertainty, insofar as the modeling has not been completed and there is 
potential that this amount could increase or decrease significantly once quantities and water

Coal Preparation Plant 

Costs for the coal preparation include allowances for the engineering design and construction of the 
plant.  Although the base case calls for construction of a plant capable of producing two products, an 
alternative is a single product plant.  A summary of the costs included for both options is shown in Table 
22-18.   

Raw & Product Coal Handling / Rejects 

Costs for raw and product coal handling include allowances for the coal handling system from the rotary 
breaker to the plant feed conveyor and the product coal conveying and storage.  Also included is the 
capital associated with reject disposal.  As with the plant the scope of the coal handling systems can vary 
depending on whether a single or two product plant is selected.  A summary of the costs included for 
both options is shown in Table 22-19.   

Underground Mining Equipment 

Costs for underground mining equipment include allowances for the mobile production equipment, 
support equipment and various other items of hardware necessary to operate an underground production 
section.  There are three proposed production sections, one single continuous miner section and two 
walk-between super continuous miner sections.  A summary of the costs included for all three production 
sections is shown in Table 22-20.   

Underground Conveyors 

Costs for underground conveyors include allowances for the conveyor terminal groups, the power center 
and the initial belt structure and belting.  Many of the belts are installations that will serve the mine for 
long periods.  These include the Main Slope belt and the various "Trunk" belts that will be installed in the 
submains network of the mine.  Panel belts will be relocated from production panel to production panel 
as the panels are developed and then retreat mined.  As sequencing of the mine allows, some truck belts 
will also be relocated after the district they serve is completed.  The initial purchase of a complete panel 
belt will include the belt structure and belting.  Replacement of structure and belting after the initial 
purchase is covered in operating costs.  A summary of the costs included for underground conveyors is 
shown in Table 22-21.   

Ancillary Underground Equipment 

Costs for ancillary underground equipment include allowances for the mobile support equipment and 
various other items of hardware necessary to support the underground production operations and 
maintain the outby areas of the mine.  Included also in ancillary equipment is an allowance for purchase 
of an additional continuous miner.  This unit will be purchased as a rebuild unit and be used for rock 
slope drivage, fault drivage if necessary and as a spare unit.  Should further geotechnical work determine

product case) or a total of C$32.0 million (C$2.65 for thermal product only) for sustaining capital is 
included in the project economics.   

The base year for the capital and cash flow models has been established as 2012 with commencement of 
project development once necessary approvals and permits are in place.  A minor amount (less than 1%) 
of the capital shown in 2012 may be spent earlier in securing approvals and permits and on engineering 
and tendering in preparation to award contracts for project development as soon as possible after 
approvals are received. 

22.9.2  Operating Cost Estimate  

Mine Operations  

Operating costs for underground mining operations and supporting activities were developed based on 
the mining parameters and mine plan described previously.  Costs have been developed in the following 
categories: 

 Labor and Salary. 
 Fixed operating costs. 
 Variable operating costs. 

Labor and salary costs are based on the personnel requirements previously described.  Cost build up for 
hourly workforce assumes: 

 An average hourly rate of C$30/hr, 
 Base hours of 2,080/yr, 
 Benefits and overheads at 41 percent of base pay, 
 Overtime of 7.5 percent of base hours at 150 percent of base rate. 

At full production, hourly workforce cost for 200 employees is C$19.4 million per year. 

Cost build up for the salaried staff includes: 

 An average annual salary of C$75,000/yr (based on proposed staff and range of salaries), 
 Benefits and overheads at 40 percent of base pay. 

At full production, salary workforce cost for 36 employees is C$3.8 million per year. 

In addition to labor and salary, the following allowances were included as fixed costs. 

 General Mine Maintenance C$750,000/yr 
 Natural Gas   C$100,000/yr 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.96 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Variable operating costs are based on production volume.  These are summarized in Table 22-27. 

 
The breakdown of operating supplies is summarized in Table 22-28. 

 

Roof support costs are based on a typical roof support requirement and costs obtained from the supplier 
currently providing these supplies to the nearby Quinsam mine.  The costs are calculated based on units 
of length of roadway and reduced to a per tonne cost based on the average roadway height.  Depillaring 
does not require support to be installed in the roof and costs have been adjusted on a ratio of 60 percent 
development and 40 percent depillaring tonnes.  This is a slightly conservative approach as the mine 
schedule shows the development to depillaring ratio as closer to 50:50.  Costs include an additional 
allowance of 5 percent for product that is wasted, damaged or ineffective. 

Most of the other costs included in Table 22-27 and 22-28 were estimated based on unit costs from 
similar operations.

DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Receding face costs represent costs of a range of services installed as the mine advances and recovered 
as areas are either depillared or abandoned and sealed off.  After the items are recovered, they are  

reused with an allowance for some losses.  Receding face costs typically include: 

 Communications and monitoring cable and hardware, 
 High-voltage cable & couplers, 
 Rock-dust pipe and tanks, 
 Compressed air pipe, 
 Conveyor belt and structure, 
 Water supply and discharge pipe, 
 Stoppings, overcasts and other ventilation control devices, 
 Lifelines. 

Unlike roof support which is installed for every meter of roadway developed (excluding depillaring), 
receding face costs are installed based on the overall advance of a panel which may consist of several 
roadways and joining cross cuts.  The ratio of total development to panel advance will vary according to 
the panel configuration and pillar dimensions.  The cost of conveyors when first purchased for the main 
truck panels of the mine is included in the capital estimate and includes the initial structure and belt 
installed.  Receding face costs are based on the cost of recovery and replacement of conveyor belt and 
structure, and purchase of the remaining items as new when needed and then recovery and replacement.  
The assumed recovery factor for the items described above varies from 80 percent to almost 100 
percent. 

Maintenance parts and supplies are required for the maintenance of the mining equipment, cables 
ancillary equipment, and installed services including conveyors (drives, belt and structure). 

The potential for water treatment was discussed previously in the capital expenditures and an allowance 
of C$1.50 per ROM tonne has been included based on estimates of similar treatment costs known for 
other operations.  The average cost is approximately C$3.0 million per year of the productive life of the 
mine, which is assumed to cover pumping from the mine, treatment and disposal of residues from the 
treatment process.  As previously stated in the capital section, the quantities of groundwater inflow and 
the amount of that inflow that will require treatment are currently based on assumptions relative to the 
experience at the nearby Quinsam mine.  Once quantities and quality are modeled, these costs can be 
determined with more certainty.  It should be recognized that there is potential for the current costs 
included for water treatment to increase or decrease significantly. 

Rock slope drivage has been estimated based on assumptions for productivity (assumed advance rates of 
10 m/day), labor assuming experience contractors are hired at higher pay rates than full time 
equivalents, roof support, operating supplies, repairs and maintenance (at higher per tonne rate to 
account for higher wear and tear cutting rock) and power.  The costs are reduced from per tonne rates 
where applicable to per meter rates assuming dimensions of the rock slope tunnels at 6.0 m wide by 3.2 
m high.  It is proposed that 3 tunnels will be driven at two locations to access the Seam 360/340.  The 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.98 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

northern access developed in 2013 will require 250m of rock slope drivage, while the southern access 
developed in 2015 will require 800m of drivage. 

Coal Processing  

Operating costs for coal processing were developed based on the proposed plant design.  Costs have 
been developed in similar categories to mine operations, however only labor and salary, and variable 
operating cost categories are included. 

Labor and salary costs are based on the personnel requirements previously described.  Cost build up for 
hourly and salary workforce is based on similar assumptions to those described above for mine 
operations with the exception being a slightly higher allowance of 12.5 percent of base hours was used 
for estimating hourly overtime. 

At full production, hourly workforce cost for 25 employees is C$2.6 million per year. 

At full production, salary workforce cost for 10 employees is C$1.1 million per year. 

Variable operating costs are based on differing processing quantities.  Some costs are determined on a 
fixed cost basis and then converted on an average quantity basis to be included as a variable cost.  These 
are summarized in Table 22-29. 

 

The other costs included in Table 22-29 were estimated based on unit costs or consumption rates from 
plants of similar design.   

The fixed costs are unitized over an average annual production of 2.0 million ROM tonnes.  Power is 
calculated based on the connected load of 1,248 kW, operating for 6,000 hours/year and a power cost of 
US$0.05/kW.  Fuel is based on consumption of 212 l/hr, with 6,000 operating hours/year and a diesel 
cost of US$ 0.66/l.

Other Site Costs  

Other site costs include: 

 Site General and Administrative at a rate of C$2.50 /product tonne. 
 Environmental at a rate of C$0.35 /product tonne. 

The general and administrative category captures costs incurred for items such as general office 
expenses, communications, IT costs including software licenses and fees, consulting, contract services, 
training, travel, subscriptions, legal fees, regulatory fees and fines, etc. 

The environmental category covers maintenance of ditches and ponds, compliance sampling and analysis, 
etc.  No allowances have been made for water treatment of surface waters as testing for potential 
impacts is ongoing.  Some additional cost may be required if reject material for example is determined to 
be potentially acid generating.  

Offsite Costs  

Costs allocated for offsite expenses are summarized in Table 22-30. 

 

The cost for loading of the product coal at the mine and transportation to the port is based on budget 
estimates provided by three different firms capable and interested in bidding for this work should the 
project proceed, including the firm currently contracted to haul the coal from nearby Quinsam mine to a 
barge loading facility at Middle Point.  Other firms also exist who have expressed an interest in providing 
this service on a contract basis so a competitive price should be able to be obtained. 

Port costs were based on operating costs for similar facilities.  A number of concepts for the coal handling 
and storage have been considered and final design of port coal handling and storage facilities will enable 
a more detailed estimate to be made.

Corporate G&A (General and Administrative) covers similar costs to the site G&A, but borne by a 
company head office.  These costs typically include the salary costs of corporate staff and some 
additional costs such as office rent, utilities, etc.  Corporate G&A and Sales Commission have been 
reported by Compliance to be capped as stated contractually in the Joint Venture agreement(s). 

Compliance also provided the basis for the Royalty payment calculation. 

PAH have not been provided or had opportunity to review either the Joint Venture agreement or 
documents outlining the royalty payments but has accepted these as presented for inclusion in the cost 
and economic models. 

22.9.3  Financial Analysis  

PAH performed an economic analysis on an un-inflated pre-tax basis over the life of the project.  The 
operating costs include all on-site costs (mining, processing and general and administration), the off-site 
costs (truck haulage, port charges and quality assurance) as well as overhead costs. 

The coal sale price was based on the Wood Mackenzie forecasts FOB Port Alberni averaging US$131/T 
(range US$126-141/T) for a semisoft product and averaging US$105/T (range US$95-114/T) for a 15 
percent ash thermal product over the projected life of the project. 

Where costs / revenues were estimated or based in US dollars they are converted to Canadian dollars 
with the base case exchange rates shown in Table 22-31.  Effectively a rate of US$0.90 per Canadian 
dollar is used except for initial capital expenditures.  It is assumed that to minimize risk, the bulk of the 
initial capital expenditure would have a currency hedge established with the rate assumed to be US$0.95 
per Canadian dollar.  All costs are 2010 dollars. 

 

Two primary production scenarios were considered.  The mine production profile is the same in each 
case; however, the product profile changes with the base case producing primarily a semisoft 
metallurgical coal with a thermal coal byproduct, and the alternative case producing a thermal product 
only. 

The results of base and alternative case financial analysis are summarized in Table 22-32.

The results show that based on the production profile and cost assumptions, the project provides a 
reasonable rate of return at modest discount rates on a pretax basis.  As the IRR is modest, some 
sensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine the breakeven points for various parameters.  The 
breakeven points evaluated were the NPV at 10 percent and 15 percent discount rates.  These are 
summarized for the Base Case in Table 22-33.

and of the parameters evaluated, is least sensitive to capital. 

22.10 Environmental 

22.10.1 Introduction  

Compliance Coal Corporation ("CCC") is proposing the development of an underground coal mine on 
Vancouver Island (the "Raven Underground Coal Project" hereafter referred to as the "Raven Project").  
It will mine approximately 30.1 million tonnes of coal and rock ("raw coal") over a 17-year period.  A 
Project Description was submitted by CCC to the British Columbia Environmental Assessment Office 
(BCEAO) August 2009, and the BCEAO has designated the Raven Project as reviewable under BC's 
Environmental Assessment Act (BCEAA).  The Raven Project is also anticipated to be reviewable under 
the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA).  CCC plans to submit an Environmental Assessment 
(EA) Application to the BCEAO, with the objective of obtaining an EA Certificate to allow construction and 
operation of the Raven Project to proceed.  The federal and provincial EA process will be coordinated. 

A draft version of the Application Information Requirements (AIR) document was submitted to the 
BCEAO, made available for public review and comment and is being updated inconsideration to 
comments received to date.  The AIR document takes into account requirements of a comprehensive 
study review under the CEAA, to facilitate a harmonized review of the Application by the BCEAO and the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEA Agency), as provided for under the 2004 Canada-
British Columbia Agreement on Environmental Assessment Cooperation.  

The land within and adjacent to the Raven property has been extensively explored.  Historical activities 
have included: 

 1875-1877: the abandoned Baynes Sound Mine was in operation (production statistics unavailable); 

 1949 – 1966: the abandoned underground Tsable River Mine (to the west of the Raven Project area 
on the north bank of the Tsable River) produced approximately 2.0 million tons of coking coal; 

 pre-1975-2009: ongoing exploration and resource definition. 

A coal washing plant was located in Union Bay to the north of the Raven Project and operated during the 
late 1800s to early 1900s (SEACOR undated).  

A number of studies were completed for the Raven Project by Hillsborough Resources Limited in 1996 in 
connection with a proposed bulk sample at the site.  The studies were focused toward resource definition 
but a number of biophysical environmental investigations were completed as well.  Biophysical studies 
were completed by Agra Earth & Environmental (AEE), Nanaimo office.  The AEE report referenced a 
number of other studies previously completed.  In addition to that list, a number of other studies have 
been completed before and since.

22.10.2 Regulatory Overview 

The Raven Project requires federal approval under the CEAA and provincial approval under the BCEAA 
from the BCEAO to proceed. The provincial review of the Raven Project is extensive and considers 
environmental, social, economic, health, and First Nations interests. 

Under a bilateral agreement between the governments of Canada and British Columbia (BC), projects 
that require a review under both federal and provincial assessment legislation will undergo a single 
cooperative assessment, meeting the legal requirement for both governments while maintaining their 
respective roles and responsibilities. The BCEAO and the CEA Agency have advised CCC that the Raven 
Project will undergo a single cooperative assessment as provided for in this agreement.  

Public review and comment is a key part of the review process. The BCEAO will provide at least two 
opportunities for public comment on the Raven Project's environmental application which are anticipated 
to occur during: 

 Fall 2010 - Draft "Application Information Requirements" (AIR) 

 The AIR describes the issues the Raven Project will address. Comments received by the Raven 
Project during this 30-day review period will be provided directly to the BCEAO.  

 Spring 2011 - "Application for Environmental Certification" 

 Following public review of the draft AIR, the Raven Project will submit its application for 
environmental certification. There will be at least one formal public review and comment period of 45 
days. 

22.10.3 Baseline Summary 

Baseline information is collected to characterize the existing, pre-project environment, and is used to 
predict potential Raven Project effects, guide mitigation and compensation planning, and establish 
baseline conditions to which the results of future monitoring can be compared.  Baseline investigations 
for the Raven Project were undertaken beginning in 2009, and continue at present.   

Baseline studies are focused on the areas potentially affected by the Raven Project, including both the 
mine site and the coal loading facility in Port Alberni.  Local and regional study areas for each discipline 
are defined by the scale of the potential direct and indirect Raven Project-specific effects.  The objectives 
for selected baseline studies, and available preliminary results, are summarized in Table 22-34.  This 
information was compiled from a variety of sources including the Draft Work Plan (AMEC 2009), the Draft 
Application Information Requirements (AMEC 2010) and the Raven Project website 
(http://theravenproject.ca/).

TABLE 22-34 
Compliance Energy Corporation 
Raven Coal Project 
Baseline Environmental Studies 

Discipline Summary 
Air Quality and Noise Data are being collected near the mine site and near the Port Alberni coal loading facility.  Work includes review of 

existing data from provincial and national air quality stations, and field collection of noise data.  Preliminary results show 
the average baseline concentrations of relevant air pollutants over Vancouver Island in 2006 and 2007 (the most recent 
reported years), were all lower than the ambient air quality objectives set by the World Health Organization and 
Environment Canada.  Preliminary noise results are not yet available. 

Climate and 
Meteorology 

Detailed climate information on wind, precipitation, temperature, humidity, solar-radiation, evaporation and extreme 
weather events will be compiled to ensure the development of robust and scientifically defensible air quality modelling, 
and to aid in proper interpretation of air quality and hydrological monitoring data. 

Hydrogeology and 
Groundwater 

The investigation program has been developed to determine groundwater characteristics, including characterization of: 
each of the two primary coal seams; the sandstone layer between and above the coal seams; and, the vertical hydraulic 
conductivity of the sandstone layer (i.e. how fast groundwater moves between the different layers).  Two test centres 
were developed, and a groundwater well, monitoring wells and vibrating wire piezometers used for pump tests and to 
determine hydraulic connectivity.  The data obtained will support numerical model development required for both 
engineering studies and the EA.  Preliminary results suggest that the coal seams have generally low to very low 
permeability, indicating that little groundwater should be released from within the seams themselves.  Water bearing 
features in the sandstone above the coal seams are moderately water bearing.  Water quality ranges broadly from 
moderately fresh to brackish with neutral to high pH.  This range of chemistry is similar to other water quality studies 
(e.g. Gabriola Island and other coal formations).  Broadly varying water qualities suggest some level of 
compartmentalization of groundwater bodies. 

Hydrology Hydrological gauging stations for Cowie Creek above and below the Raven Project footprint and Cowie Creek below 
the confluence with Cougar Smith Creek will provide site-specific data for the Raven Project.  The data collected from 
the creeks can then be calibrated against T'Sable River's data and used to develop flood and low flow estimates 
required for the Raven Project's water management design objectives and to determine potential effects from 
alternations to the Cowie Creek drainage basin by Raven Project development.   

Water and Sediment 
Quality 

Since April 2009, water and sediment quality samples have been collected from ten sites within the Cowie Creek 
watershed.  Analyses include physical parameters, major ions, nutrients, total and dissolved metals and polynuclear 
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  Preliminary results indicate water quality typical of south coastal streams in relatively 
undisturbed areas; it is slightly acidic (due to the high proportion of rainwater in runoff), soft, with low alkalinity, low 
dissolved solids, low suspended solids, and generally low to undetectable trace metals.  PAHs are undetectable in both 
water and sediments.  Some sediment metals are slightly elevated but not above average for the bedrock types found 
in the Raven Project area; aquatic studies indicate this has had no detectable effect on freshwater aquatic organisms 
and healthy populations exist in all water bodies examined.

Discipline Summary 
Metal Leaching / Acid 
Rock Drainage 
(ML/ARD) 
 

A 2001 ML/ARD characterization study was designed to support a bulk coal sampling program. The proposed ML/ARD 
characterization program is completed through an iterative approach that includes static ABA testing, kinetic leach 
testing and can include field based leach testing. 

Fisheries and Aquatic 
Resources 

Studies include mapping and monitoring of aquatic habitats, including stream temperature, flow and the relationship 
between flow and habitat quantity/quality.  Fish abundance, species composition, life history and movement data are 
being collected.  Benthic invertebrates and periphyton (algae) are being sampled as indices of stream condition.  Fish 
tissue metal samples have been collected to determine background concentrations.  Preliminary results show that the 
Raven Project surface facilities will affect small Cowie Creek tributaries with typically seasonal with surface flows 
(October to May).  Natural barriers on Cowie and Cougar Smith creeks keep anadromous fish away from the mine area; 
as a result stream resident cutthroat trout are the only fish species in the immediate vicinity of the proposed surface 
facilities. 

Marine Environment Water quality will be assessed at three monitoring stations located in subtidal waters of Baynes Sound.  Sediment 
quality samples will be collected at each of the water quality stations once during the summer using a 0.1 square meter 
Van Veen dredge.  A remote underwater video camera integrated with a differential global positioning system will be 
deployed from a boat following a pre-determined transect grid at the Port Alberni coal loading facility marine study area. 

Terrain, Soils and 
Geology 

Soils mapping will be completed in conjunction with Terrestrial Ecosystem Mapping (TEM; BC provincial standard for 
ecosystem mapping) for vegetation and wildlife. Background concentrations of metals and soils suitability for 
reclamation will be required for the EA and the Mines Act permit.   

Natural Hazards Terrain hazards are identified by terrain mapping at the same scale as TEM. A seismic hazard analysis will be required 
to assess risk to Raven Project facilities such as stock and spoil piles. 

Vegetation A modified version of TEM was undertaken; ecosystem type and extent were mapped from aerial photographs and 
verified in the field.  Rare plant surveys were also conducted.  Preliminary results indicate that a large proportion of the 
study area has recently been logged, and logging activity continues; there are few mature forest stands remaining, but 
there are some wetlands and riparian ecosystems of excellent quality.  No rare ecosystems (provincially red- or blue-
listed) were found in proximity to the proposed mine site, and no rare plant species have so far been discovered.  

Wildlife Resources Studies include habitat assessments, bird surveys, amphibian and reptile surveys and butterfly and dragonfly surveys.  
Preliminary results show that the majority of wildlife habitat has been affected by logging and road construction 
activities.  Most mature forest stands are located in ravines and valleys.  Wetland and stream riparian habitats provide 
the most intact habitats for wildlife and provide important habitat for Species-of-Concern, such as the red-legged frog 
and western toad.  Elk, black-tailed deer and black bear are relatively common in the area and use a variety of habitats 
such as cut-over areas and young and older forests.  Species such as the band-tailed pigeon, martin, and bald eagle 
forage in the study area, but suitable breeding habitat does not appear to be present. 

Human Health A profile and description of public health parameters potentially affecting the Raven Project will be provided by 
compiling and assessing information on a variety of parameters including noise levels, local landscape aesthetics, 
water sources, water quality, air quality, and services (e.g., water supply, waste disposal, health and emergency

services). 

Non-Traditional Land 
Use 

The Raven Project area (T'Sable River Coalfield) has a long history of exploration and development for coal mining 
dating back to the 1800s.  There are no parks or environmental sensitive areas within the Raven Project area.  A BC 
Hydro Biodiversity Corridor runs north-south paralleling the Island Highway on the inland side.  Existing transportation 
ways in the area included the Island Highway, Highway 19, Pacific Rim Highway, the E&N Railway and various logging 
roads. Additional information will be collected and confirmed as part of the land use assessment.  

Visual and Aesthetic 
Resources 

Recreational activities by residents and tourists identified in the Raven Project area will be reviewed and various 
viewpoints identified as being scenic and accessible will be identified.  The baseline analysis will describe the setting, 
whether or not a visual resource is present and why it qualifies as a visual resource.  An inventory of existing visual 
features will also be developed. The visual and aesthetics resources potentially affected by the Raven Project will be 
identified. 

Archaeology and 
Heritage Resources 

Studies have included review of available information; engagement with First Nation communities to ask for help 
designing archaeological studies in a culturally appropriate manner and to identify archaeological, heritage, or sensitive 
cultural sites; discussion of local history with local museums, archives and individuals; and preliminary fieldwork to 
ground-truth predictions of archaeological and heritage potential.  Preliminary results indicate that the archaeological 
integrity of the area has been impacted by past industrial and logging activity.  However, two previously unknown 
archaeological sites have been identified (no sites previously documented); two historic logging camps and an intact rail 
track and coal tender from historic era logging were also located. 
 

Economic and Social Local and regional socio-economic profiles will be developed for Courtney and Comox and other communities in the 
area.  Demographic, economic and social conditions will be described.  Two types of socio-economic analysis will be 
undertaken.  The first assessment will evaluate the extent to which Raven Project construction and operation will affect 
the BC economy.  The results of this assessment will help demonstrate the potential direct, indirect and induced 
economic effects that the Raven Project will have on provincial gross domestic product, employment and income and 
will be used to determine what percentage of Raven Project effects will be experienced outside the immediate region. 
The second assessment will describe the regional and local impacts of Raven Project construction and operation.  The 
analysis will examine the Raven Project demands for labour, goods and services in the context of current and expected 
future regional capacity to determine what labour and materials may have to be imported, potentially creating additional 
demands on regional infrastructure and services.   

Transportation Traffic data as part of the feasibility study will be collected from the Ministry of Transportation.  Vehicle accident and 
injury data will be collected from the police.  Potential impacts on transportation infrastructure, traffic and safety will be 
analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.   

Traditional Land Use CCC proposed a Traditional Use Study (TUS) to each of the First Nations listed under the Order of Section 11.  The 
proposed TUS would identify First Nation traditional land use interests, improve the Raven Project's understanding of 
impacts and mitigate those impacts, provide input and incorporate traditional knowledge (TK) into Raven Project 
planning and design and fulfill regulatory expectations.  Key components of the study would incorporate existing TUS 
information for the Raven Project area (if available), gather new information, produce a baseline TUS report, review 
with communities and use the Traditional Use (TU) data to help reduce Raven Project effects and assist in Raven

Discipline Summary 
Project planning. To date the Qualicum First Nation is the only First Nation to participate in a TUS.  A community 
meeting was held on January 19, 2010. During that workshop, participants identified relevant TK and TU information. 
Workshop participants provided information acquired from hunting in the area, and from gathering vegetation. 
Geographical information, such as the wintering locations for elk, and plant harvesting locations were marked on maps.  
Additional TK holders, who could contribute to the study, were identified, and participants requested a site visit. A site 
visit and a second workshop, attended by additional TK and TU holders occurred on March 8, 2010.   Participants 
viewed the location of the proposed mine site (including proposed mine opening) and haul roads. Participants provided 
TK and traditional land use information during the site tour and the site-specific information provided during the tour was 
documented on maps.  In addition to the workshops and site tour, a literature review of existing sources including the 
internet, library, newspaper, provincial and local archives/museums, government databases, and consultants' reports 
was conducted. Several sources were of particular importance for the inclusion of biophysical TK. These sources 
include books by an ethnobotanist and the transcript of an oral history of Elder of the Qualicum First Nation in 1979. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.108 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

22.10.4 First Nations  

The Order under Section 11 issued by the BCEAO indicates that the proposed Raven Project footprint is 
located on private land in the asserted territories of the Qualicum First Nation, the We Wai Kai Nation, 
the Wei Wai Kum First Nation, the Xwemalhkwu (Homalco) First Nation and the K'omoks First Nation.  
The proposed Raven Project footprint is also in the vicinity of the asserted territories of the Sliammon 
First Nation and the Hul'quimi'num Member First Nations (Cowichan Tribes, Chemainus First Nation, 
Penelakut Tribe, Lyackson First Nation, Lake Cowichan First Nation and the Halalt First Nation). 

CCC has also communicated with, and provided information about the Raven Project to the Tseshaht First 
Nation and the Hupacasath First Nation whose asserted territories are in the Port Alberni area, the 
location of the Port Alberni coal loading facility. 

CCC is committed to ensuring that interested First Nations are informed about potential Raven Project 
effects, mutually-developed mitigation strategies and potential Raven Project benefits.  First Nations input 
will be incorporated into the planning and design of the Raven Project. This includes working together to:  

 understand the impact of the proposed Raven Project on: 

• traditional use of land  
• Aboriginal Rights 
• Aboriginal Title  

 identify training, employment and business opportunities; and 

 maximize participation in the EA process. 

First Nations have been involved with the Raven Project by participating in:  

 the Opportunities and Concerns Workshop and Mine Site Tour in June and October 2009; 
 the drill pad site tour prior to the infill drilling program in 2009 to investigate cultural potential; 
 fieldwork in the Archaeological Overview Assessment completed in November 2009; 
 the two Raven facilitated workshops with the First Nations EA Technical Working Group; 
 the formal Community Advisory Group (CAG) meeting in February 2010;  
 drilling, environmental and archaeological baseline work: and 
 fieldwork in the Archaeological Impact Assessment in September 2010. 

This participation helps CCC to identify First Nation traditional land use interests, improve the Raven 
Project's understanding of impacts and mitigate those impacts, provide input and incorporate traditional 
knowledge (TK) into Raven Project planning and design and fulfill regulatory expectations. 

Key components of the study would include: incorporating existing TUS information for the Raven Project 
area (if available), gathering new information, producing a baseline TUS report, reviewing with 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.109 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

communities and using the Traditional Use (TU) data to help reduce Raven Project effects and assisting 
in Raven Project planning. 

To date community members of the Qualicum First Nation have provided TK and TU information, 
however the report has not been verified by its community members.  First Nations interests and values 
will be incorporated into each phase of the EA process. 

22.10.5 Consultation  

CCC is committed to working closely with the community as plans to reduce or eliminate potential Raven 
Project effects are developed.  The CCC consultation team has met with or offered informational 
presentations to, provincial ministry officials, Member of Parliament John Duncan, Members of the 
Legislative Assembly (Don McRae, Scott Fraser, and Ron Cantelon) mayors and council (City of 
Courtenay, Town of Comox, Village of Cumberland and City of Port Alberni), Regional Districts (Comox 
Valley, Alberni-Clayoquot and Nanaimo), First Nations (Qualicum First Nation, We Wai Kai Nation, Wei 
Wai Kum First Nation, Xwemalhkwu (Homalco) First Nation, K'omoks First Nation, Sliammon First Nation, 
Cowichan Tribes, Chemainus First Nation, Penelakut Tribe, Lyackson First Nation, Lake Cowichan First 
Nation, Halalt First Nation, Tseshaht First Nation and the Hupacasath First Nation), Improvement Districts 
(Union Bay, Fanny Bay, Ships Point, Bowser, Deep Bay, Qualicum Bay - Horne Lake) community and 
business groups (B.C. Shellfish Grower's Association, Rotary Clubs in Courtenay, Comox, Cumberland, 
and Port Alberni,  Oceanside Development and Construction Association, Lighthouse Country Business 
Association, Port Alberni Chamber of Commerce, Island Corridor Foundation, Port Alberni Port Authority, 
Vancouver Island Exploration Group, Nanoose Bay Probus Club) and individuals. 

Two Raven Project updates have been circulated via mail drop and through newspaper advertisements, 
and members of the CAG have participated in three community meetings (June 25/26, 2009, October 16, 
2009, February 4, 2010).   The team has met with residents at the Deep Bay Harbour Festival and at 
"Island Railway Days" in Parksville.  Open houses conducted to-date include:  

 Approximately 300 people attended the first in a series of open houses and public engagement 
opportunities held on October 28, 2009 at the Fanny Bay Community Hall.  

 Close to 160 residents had the opportunity to ask questions and review the early plans for the 
proposed Raven Project and upgrade to the Port Alberni coal loading facility at the Port Alberni open 
house on July 13, 2010.  

A working group, made up of representatives of First Nations and federal, provincial and local 
government agencies, will review all aspects of the Raven Project's BCEAO application.  Public comment 
is an essential element of both the federal and provincial review process; the first CEA Agency public 
comment period closed September 20, 2010.  Future comment periods will be announced as the Raven 
Project progresses and more information about the Raven Project is available. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.110 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

22.10.6 Key Issues 

Key issues for the Raven Project have been identified from public comments received and from regulatory 
and First Nation comments on the draft Application Information Requirements.  These concerns are 
summarized below, along with the approach to resolve the issues. 

Ground and Surface Water 

There is public concern that the Raven Project may impact ground and surface water.  Technical and EAs 
are being completed to identify design and operational requirements to protect surface and ground 
water.  These assessments will continue through 2010, when a detailed water management plan will be 
developed.  Preliminary results indicate that the Raven Project will not affect drinking water aquifers. 

There is public concern that the Raven Project may impact the Tsable River watershed.  Following input 
from the community, the original surface facilities location was relocated away from the Tsable River 
watershed; there are no surface facilities located in the watershed, but the mine will use an existing 
industrial road through the watershed for transportation.  

Transportation to the Port 

There is interest in the anticipated number of trucks travelling from the mine site to Port Alberni coal 
loading facility.  The anticipated number of truck loads is 2 to 4 per hour (approximately 45-80/day) 
based on current production estimates of 0.7 to 1.1 Mt of clean (processed) coal per year.  At average 
production levels of 0.9 Mt, just under 3 truck loads per hour or approximately 60/day are required. 

Port Operations 

There is concern that coal dust from the Port Alberni coal loading facility may affect Port Alberni 
residents.  The Port Alberni coal loading facility will be the first in Western Canada to have a fully 
enclosed storage facility. This will reduce or eliminate coal dust at the Port Alberni coal loading facility. 

There is interest in proposed activities at the Port Alberni coal loading facility and associated EA of the 
proposed Port Alberni coal loading facility expansion and operations.  The federal government will 
conduct an EA of the Port Alberni coal loading facility expansion as part of its environmental review of the 
Raven Project.  The assessment will include construction and operational details for the Port Alberni coal 
loading facility, including possible effects on the marine environment. 

The Baynes Sound Shellfishery 

There is concern that the proposed Raven Project may affect shellfish and salmon in Baynes Sound.  The 
Raven Project will be designed and managed to protect shellfish, salmon and other aquatic species. This 
is required by provincial and federal law. 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.111 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

Quality of Life 

There is concern that coal dust from operational activities may affect local residents. Coal dust is not 
anticipated to be a problem. Based on laboratory testing coal from the Raven Project is not anticipated to 
contain a large proportion of fines. The surface facilities are located approximately four to five kilometers 
from the nearest local residence.  All coal transportation trucks will be tarped or covered and coal 
stockpiles will be sprayed with water if necessary to control dust. The Raven Project team will work 
closely with the community to minimize or eliminate potential impacts from coal dust and an 
environmental management plan will be put in place to manage dust emissions as required.  Air quality 
will be monitored throughout the life of the Raven Project. 

There is concern about visual aesthetics and possible noise effects.  The proposed mine site is located in 
a valley behind a ridge.  Baseline studies and modeling are underway to reduce noise and visual impacts.  

Transportation 

There is interest in how the coal will be transported.  The Raven Project considered transporting the coal 
to one of three port options: Middle Point in Campbell River, Duke Point in Nanaimo, and Port Alberni.  
Following review of transportation options, Port Alberni emerged as the preferred port option due to its 
available facilities, proximity to markets, environmental considerations, and accessibility.  

The preferred transportation method is by truck.  

Coal Washing  

There is interest in "coal washing," and how the environment will be protected from the process.  Coal 
washing is the process of separating dirt and non-coal rock material from the coal.  This is a water-based 
process that does not use toxic chemicals.  It is estimated that 330 to 490 cubic meters of water will be 
used per day for coal washing.  This is equivalent to the amount of water a medium to large hotel uses in 
an average day.  Almost all the water used in the coal washing process (about 99%) is expected to be 
recycled.  Any water released will meet or be better than government water quality standards.  A 
comprehensive water management plan will be implemented to safely and efficiently manage all water 
requirements.  

There is interest in what "reject rock" is.  Reject rock refers to the rock that is left over after the coal has 
been removed.  The rejects are stored on the mine site in a pile. Compliance is required by law to 
develop reclamation and closure plan and bonding to reclaim all areas including reject piles.  The reject 
piles must meet stringent government standards to ensure no long term impacts to the environment.  

Coal Mining  

There is interest in the method used for coal removal.  Coal would be mined underground, using the 
room-and-pillar method, which means coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of small rooms into 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.112 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

the coal seam. There would be minimal impacts to the ground surface area above the mine area. Room-
and-pillar mining is a safe and effective mining method that is widely used in Canada and the United 
States, and is particularly well-suited to geologies such as the Raven Project.  

There is interest in what "reject rock" is. There is interest in what a "settling pond" is.  A settling pond is 
a man-made pond used during mining operations to catch and retain dirt and sediment from coal 
washing and site run-off so that it is not released to surrounding streams and rivers.  

Any water that is released will meet or be better than government water quality standards. 

Reclamation and Closure  

There is an interest in whether a reclamation or closure plan is in place.  Land reclamation is a 
requirement of modern day mining.  At every step of the mining process, from exploration to 
decommissioning, environmental regulations require that land is returned to a productive state. As part of 
the provincial government environmental approval process, the Raven Project is required to develop a 
"reclamation and closure plan" detailing site remediation at the end of the Raven Project.  In addition, 
the Raven Project is also required to post a closure bond, to ensure sufficient funds will always be 
available to complete the reclamation and closure plan.  

Extreme Events 

There is a concern about how extreme weather events factor into the water studies currently underway.  
Climate and meteorology studies take extreme weather events into consideration.  Environmental 
consultants are collecting and analyzing wind, temperature and precipitation data that has been recorded 
since 2001 at the University of British Columbia meteorological station, just north of the Tsable River. 
This data will be correlated with climate data that has been collected at the Comox airport since 1971 and 
used to create a site-specific weather summary and model of weather conditions. 

There is a concern about what would be the impact of a major seismic event.  The Raven Project will be 
designed to withstand major seismic events. This is required by federal and provincial regulations. 

Subsidence 

There is a concern about the potential for subsidence induced by underground mining activities.  The 
removal of coal from underground creates the potential for land subsidence, and possible changes to 
surface land forms and waterbodies.  Local geological considerations and mine design determine the 
extent and severity of surface subsidence.  Engineering studies based on the mine planning as described 
in Section 22.3.1 above indicated: 

 The planned Raven Project workings have sufficient overburden cover to prevent stream inflow into 
the workings.   



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.113 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

 Mining-induced subsidence impacts on the stream channels and flows are likely to be insignificant.   

Community Participation 

There is interest in opportunities for community input.  Opportunities for community input will be 
provided at every phase of the Raven Project and considerations and interests raised by the community 
will be incorporated into the planning and design of the Raven Project. More than 300 people attended 
an open house hosted by the Raven Project in October, 2009, at the Fanny Bay Community Hall.  Close 
to 160 residents had the opportunity to ask questions and review early plans for the proposed Raven 
Project and Port Alberni coal loading facility upgrades at the Port Alberni open house on July 13, 2010.  
More open houses and meetings will be held as the Raven Project progresses, and a CAG made up of 
local representation will help ensure community issues are identified and addressed. 

Employment 

There is an interest in local employment opportunities.  The proposed Raven Project is committed to 
training and hiring local people. Mine construction is estimated to create jobs for up to 200 people. Mine, 
transportation and port operations will provide training and employment for about 325 employees in well-
paying, full-time positions. The Raven Project will create an estimated 500 indirect jobs in the local or 
regional economy.   

Community Benefits  

There is an interest in any community benefits generated in association with Raven Project.  The Raven 
Project team is committed to maximizing economic and social benefits to the community.  The Comox 
Valley has already benefitted from the exploration and planning work underway on the Raven Project. 
More than nine First Nations members have been employed during exploration and baseline EAs, and 
local contractors have been used for construction and exploration drilling. The Raven Project will require 
local suppliers and local contract services at every stage.  

First Nation Traditional and Current Land Use 

There is a concern from some First Nations about how their TU of the land will be maintained including, 
but not limited to, hunting of wildlife (elk and deer in particular), collection of traditional medicinal plants, 
grasses, firewood and harvesting of cedar bark. 

22.10.7 Environmental Assessment and Permitting Requirements  

New and modified major mining projects in BC are subject to EA and review prior to certification and 
issuance of permits to authorize construction and operations.  Environmental assessment is a means of 
ensuring the potential for adverse environmental, social, economic, health, and heritage effects or the 
potential adverse effects on Aboriginal interests or rights are addressed prior to project approval.  There 
are generally two stages in the EA: pre-application phase when appropriate studies are identified through 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.114 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

consultation and studies are undertaken and application review phase during which further consultation 
occurs and potential environment, economic, social, heritage and health effects are identified, mitigated, 
or avoided.   

On August 12, 2009, the BCEAO issued an Order under Section 10(l)(c) of the Act, stating that the 
proposed Raven Project requires an Environmental Assessment Certificate and that the Proponent may 
not proceed with the proposed Raven Project without an assessment.  The proposed Raven Project 
constitutes a reviewable project, pursuant to Part 3 of the Reviewable Projects Regulation (B.C. Reg. 
370/02), because the proposed Raven Project is a new mine facility that, during operation, would have a 
production capacity of 2,250,000 tonnes/year of a combination of clean and raw coal; 

Generally, the scope, procedures, and methods of each assessment are flexible and tailored specifically to 
the Raven Project circumstances.  These are defined in both the Section 11 Order and an approved AIR 
document.  An order under Section 11 was issued by the BCEAO on March 5, 2010.  The draft AIR was 
submitted for regulatory review April 2010.  

Federal government review under the CEAA is independent of provincial review as the federal agencies, 
deemed responsible authorities, will ascertain if there are federal "triggers" invoked by the Raven Project, 
thereby resulting in an applicable level of federal review (e.g., none, screening level assessment, or 
comprehensive review or Panel).  The CEAA may be triggered if the federal government grants financial 
assistance to the Raven Project; sells, leases or transfers control of land required for the Raven Project; 
or exercises a specified regulatory duty (known as the Law List Trigger) in relation to the Raven Project.  
The type of trigger determines the level of screening.   

Any required federal and provincial EA processes must be completed before the respective jurisdictions 
can issue permits, licenses or other authorizations required in order to allow the development to proceed.  
The primary BC authorization for the development of a mine project is a permit under the provincial 
Mines Act.  The provincial Mines Act permit process includes an EA as described in Part 10 of the Health, 
Safety, and Reclamation Code for Mines in BC.  In any situation where the BCEAA does not apply this Act 
constitutes the primary provincial review process.   

The provincial and federal processes are subject to a harmonization agreement to avoid duplication and 
expedite reviews. 

The application for a mine permit will require a description of the Raven Project including details of the 
underground mine work system, method of mining, water management, ARD prevention and final 
reclamation.   

Other authorizations potentially required from the federal government include: Department of Transport 
authorization to allow road site access through crossing rivers and streams under the Navigable Waters 
Protection Act, Natural Resources Canada authorization for use of explosives for mining use under the 
Explosives Act, Fisheries and Oceans Canada authorization to potentially alter fisheries habitat; and other 
possible authorizations from Environment Canada such as those under the Species at Risk Act.  An access

permit will be required from the provincial Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure to connect to the 
Island Highway if existing road access or railway access is not utilized.   

Key approvals for initial construction activity will include:  

 all licenses, permits, and approvals related to the construction and operation of the mine site access 
road and power line; 

 all licenses, permits, and approvals related to the development and use of a construction aggregate 
quarry, including a Mines Act permit; 

 the Mines Act permit for initial site construction activity, including construction of site roads, 
foundation excavations for the coal processing plant, and maintenance facilities, and other initial 
construction-related activity; 

 all licenses, permits, and approvals related to the set-up and operation of the construction work 
force, including those required under the Health Act, Drinking Water Protection Act, and Waste 
Management Act (sewage, incinerator and refuse disposal); and, 

 any water licenses for storage, use, and diversion.

22.10.8 Environmental Management 

An Environmental Management System (EMS), based on the following elements, will be designed to 
ensure a consistent approach to responsible environmental management: 

 Planning: defining the scope of the EMS; establishing an environmental policy for the Raven Project; 
identifying applicable legal and other (non-regulatory) requirements; setting environmental 
performance objectives and developing the Environmental Management Plans (EMP)s; 

 Implementation: resource allocation and the assignment of roles and responsibilities; environmental 
management training; internal and external communications; EMS documentation and records and 
document control; and operating controls, including emergency response activities; 

 Checking and corrective action: ongoing monitoring of environmental performance; inspection and 
evaluation of environmental management practices, including environmental compliance; and EMS 
audits; and 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.117 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

 Continual improvement: senior operational management review of the EMS and identification of 
improvements in environmental performance of the Raven Project. 

The EMS will emphasize key stakeholder engagement initiatives for environmental management, 
including educational and consultation programs with local First Nations communities and other key 
stakeholders. 

Raven Project specific EMPs will be designed to provide an integrated, systematic approach to 
environmental management and will help deliver assurance to interested parties regarding the phases 
and activities of the Raven Project.  The EMPs will be based on the principle of adaptive management. 

22.11 Risk 

PAH has undertaken the pre-feasibility study evaluation of the Raven Project based on the currently 
available information and PAH's experience in underground coal mining projects and also coal and other 
mining projects in Canada. 

Mining projects involve inherent risk.  PAH has considered the risks in preparing the study, and where 
possible addressed them in the planning and the cost projections for the project.  Accepting that at this 
stage of the project evaluation a range of uncertainties exist, sensitivity analyses have also been 
undertaken on costs and revenues to understand their impacts to project value.  It must be accepted 
however that not all risks can be modeled simply as financial impacts.  Specific risks to the Raven Project 
include: 

The Raven Project has not received Environmental Assessment (EA) approval.  Significant approval delays 
and/or regulatory concerns that impact or alter the mine plan, mining methods or other processes could 
negatively impact project value. 

Testing of coal reject material to determine whether or not it is potentially acid generating (PAG) is also 
ongoing.  If the reject material is found to be PAG, regulatory expectations for management of the 
mining and reject disposal process to ensure there is no impact to the environment may result in 
significant differences to the current plans and costs. 

The investigations into groundwater inflows and geochemistry are ongoing.  Modeling efforts are 
underway but considerable work remains to be completed.  Assumptions concerning inflows have been 
made based on an understanding of inflows at the nearby Quinsam mine however considerable 
uncertainty remains concerning the volumes of water that will enter the mine workings or the variation in 
the quality of those inflows.  Consequently there could be significant variance (increase or decrease) in 
the final capital and operating costs to manage and when necessary treat water to the current 
assumptions. 

Despite the recent global financial crisis and recession, activity in the mining sector has rebounded 
steadily.  Continued growth in the Western Canadian coal and oil sands mining sectors and the mining 



   
Pincock, Allen & Holt   22.118 
DE-00033   October 14, 2010 

industry could place pressure on engineering and construction activity, as well as experienced mine 
operations and maintenance labor and mining equipment.  The actual timing of project development in 
relation to other mining and major industrial projects is impossible to predict with certainty but can have 
considerable impact on the eventual project development timeline and cost. 

The price of steel has been volatile in recent years after a dramatic increase prior to the global financial 
crisis.  The costs of equipment, construction and roof support materials now commonly include an 
adjustment factor to reduce risk for suppliers or construction contractors.  The Raven project semisoft 
coking coal is a raw material in the steel making process and so prices may follow similar trends to steel.  
While this has potential to increase or decrease costs and revenue, untimely variation whereby capital 
increased significantly above expectations during the project construction and implementation phase 
followed by a period of lower steel prices coupled to lower coal prices would negatively impact project 
economics.  Here again project timing in relation to swings in the steel and coal market are impossible to 
predict with certainty.   

Raven geology is variable and changes in thickness and gradient have potential to impact not only the 
recoverable coal, but the productivity of the mining operations.  While the rates assumed in Raven 
production schedules are derated by 50 percent from what might be expected of the same equipment in 
flatter lying seams, and the reduction is expected to be conservative, there is limited operating 
experience in similar conditions.  Lower productivity than expected would increase operating costs and/or 
potentially require additional capital if projected production levels were to be maintained. 

This same variability as well as changes in ground conditions has the potential to impact both the mining 
layout and the recovery of coal pillars which represents a significant portion of the reserve.  The balance 
of development to depillaring also impacts operating cost and production capacity.  While the available 
measured and indicated resources conforming to mine planning parameters have been almost entirely 
accounted for in the current mine plan, additional measured and indicated resources exist where the coal 
seam gradient is slightly steeper and these resources may potentially be recoverable and provide makeup 
for areas where current reserve recovery is lower than planned or recovery of these resources may 
potentially increase the overall recoverable reserve.  Additional resource areas exist that are currently 
classed as inferred resources.  Additional drilling may adequately define coal which also may potentially 
be recoverable and provide makeup for areas where current reserve recovery is lower than planned or 
these additional recoverable resources may potentially increase the overall recoverable reserve.  There is 
however no certainty that any of the steeper gradient resource or inferred resource will be economically 
mineable. 

Along with variability in the coal seam thickness and gradient, coal quality will also vary over the project 
life.  Actual operating performance in regard mining dilution and process efficiency may differ significantly 
from planning assumptions.  Product specifications necessary to secure coal sales may also change over 
time.  While the process plant has been designed with a certain amount of flexibility, it is not unusual 
that adjustments to a plant will be required over time, requiring unexpected capital investment and 
potentially increasing operating costs.

Compliance Energy has retained Wood Mackenzie to 
prepare a coal price forecast for high volatile 
metallurgical coal expected to be produced at the Raven 
Coal Project for the period 2010 through 2030.

The Raven Coal Project is high volatile bituminous A

Key Findings

Raven's Seam 1 product has been classified as high volatile coking coal.  By contrast, typical 
Canadian coking coals found in Alberta and mainland British Columbia tend to be low- or 
mid-volatility coking coals. 
While the crucible swelling number (CSN) is 8.0 (typical of hard coking coals), some of the 
other quality characteristics are not ideal; therefore, the primary use of this product will be as 
a blend coal in the steelmaking process. 
The coal quality is similar to Australia's New South Wales (NSW) semi-soft coking coals, with 
the primary differentiator being the CSN.
Raven Seam 1 is priced at semi-soft coking coal levels.

Although Raven coal swells like a hard coking coal, its quality more 
accurately reflects that of a high volatile semi-soft coal.

Raven coal quality can be qualitatively described as follows, relative to high volatile met 
coals:

• Volatility is in the medium category for a high volatile coal 

• Reflectance is low
• Ability to produce a strong coke decreases with low reflectance

• Fluidity is low
• Best quality high volatile coking coals have fluidity in excess of 30,000 ddpm.  High volatile coal in 

the blend helps in coal  type mixing and the production of coke with good porosity

• Expansion is poor for a high volatile coal (under 100, Arnu)
• The low Arnu value reduces the effectiveness of Raven coal in balancing the already low Arnu value 

of low volatility coals present in any blend

• The CSN (swelling index) (8) is quite good

• For a high volatile coal, the inert content is satisfactory (that is, it is low)

• The strength index is satisfactory

the parameters of the Australian 
seaborne market, it is more 
indicative of a semi-soft coking 
coal – except for its high CSN.

• Raven's volatile matter and 
ash are very similar to other 
NSW semi-soft coking coals.

• Reflectance and max fluidity 
are better than the other NSW 
semi-soft coals.

Raven coal is mostly unique in Canada given its higher volatility and higher 
CSN value

Canadian Coking Coal Quality CharacteristicsCanadian Coking Coal Quality Characteristics

All other Canadian metallurgical 
coking coals fall in the low- to mid- 
volatility range.
Raven's sulfur content is slightly 
higher than the average.
Raven's high CSN is on par with 
Fording River and Wolverine coals.
However, fluidity of Raven coal is 
poor for a high-volatile coal and 
this reduces its effectiveness in 
blends with naturally lower fluidity 
mid- and low-volatile coals.

A host of factors are driving coal market dynamics…

The figure on the right defines some key metallurgical 
coal market drivers that are taken into consideration in 
preparation of this forecast.

These interrelated drivers and their varying impact over 
time is managed by utilizing the following two 
approaches in parallel: 

• The Wood Mackenzie International Coal Trade 
(ICT) linear program which is predominantly a 
fundamentals driven model relying substantially 
on the supply and demand balance and 
delivered cost competitiveness.

• A market analysis model which is more of an 
iterative process that captures the elements not 
readily adaptable to a linear program.

Between 1986 and 2004, the differential between 
thermal coal prices and coking coal remained relatively 
constant. The settlement of thermal coal prices was 
influenced by the settlement price of coking coals, with 
the coking coal price typically settled (but not always) 
before thermal coal in North Asian markets.

Historical differentials 
changed dramatically as the 
market entered a new period 
of volatility initially caused by 
supply uncertainty and later

We have priced the Raven coal using the basis 
of Australian semi soft coking coals.
There are no penalties or premiums for ash or 
sulfur as the quality falls within accepted 
parameters.
A modest market correction post-2011 is 
expected as additional supply enters the market

Raven coal prices will react to new supply entering the market then grow 
slowly and steadily over time in line with other globally traded coals.

We have considered the Raven coal to 
be priced with other Australian semi- 
soft coking coals and high-vol PCI 
coals.
Our assumed price differential 
between the two products is an 
average of the two prices.
This figure shows the Raven coal 
along with the semi-soft (considered 
our upward bound), the high-vol PCI 
(the lower bound), and the reference 
HCC price forecast.
Should steel demand falter, the Raven 
coal may fall closer to the thermal 
boundary, with a premium of about 
close to 30%, to reflect its quality and 
high heating value.

4a Metallurgical Coal Quality Fundamentals

Delivering commercial insight

www.woodmac.com

Metallurgical coal broadly includes all coal used in the steelmaking 
process, while coking coal is specifically that coal which can be coked

Coking Coals 

Hard Coking Coals (HCC) are essential for the production of a strong coke when using coke ovens 
and generally have the ability to make a strong (or hard) coke when coked on their own.  These 
coals are often classified based on volatile matter content (high, medium, and low) and are typically 
blended with other coals to produce high quality coke.

Semi-Hard Coking Coals (SHCC) are generally considered high ash versions of hard coking coals,
which still have good coke making properties. The term is more of a commercial classification rather 
than one which reflects the strength of the resultant coke and often is confusing in terms of the 
value in use aspect of the coal.

Other 
Metallurgical 

Coals

Semi-Soft Coking Coals (HCC) do not produce a strong coke when coked alone. They tend to 
have weak coking properties and are commonly added to the coke oven blend to reduce the overall 
cost of the coal. There is a limit to the proportion of semi-soft coking coal that can be added without 
coal pre-treatment prior to coking.

Pulverized Coal Injection (PCI) Coals are used for direct injection into the blast furnace. They 
tend to fall into two broad categories: 1. High volatile matter (HV), low rank bituminous coals 
(including semi-soft coking coals) and 2. semi-anthracite. Higher rank coals such as semi-
anthracites, with high energy and high fixed carbon contents have been shown to be the most 
successful in this application and have significantly increased their share of the PCI market.

Not all coking coals are created equal…and a number of quality 
measures help determine a coal's coking properties

The basic measure of whether a coal has coking 
properties is the propensity of the coal to 
agglomerate or cake together into strong lumps 
when it is heated and then re-cooled in the absence 
of oxygen
Chemical measures such as sulfur and ash content 
are also important to the economics of the pig iron 
and steel-making process

• Low sulfur content (generally below 1% by 
weight) is desirable in order to avoid the cost of 
removing unduly high sulfur in the steel refining 
process

• Low ash content also is desirable as ash lowers 
the process efficiency in blast furnaces and may 
contain undesirable minerals (it is not generally 
economical to reduce ash below 4-5% for the 
best US coals or below 9-10% internationally)

Volatile matter is an important factor in a coal's performance in 
the coke oven

Generally, high-volatile coals are considered to contain in excess of 31% volatile matter by weight
Low-volatile coals tend to support coke product strength and also provide significant amounts of carbon, 
which is used as a reductant in the blast furnace in the production of free iron
High-volatile coals provide the fluidity necessary to ensure complete mixing of all coal types in the blend 
during the fluid stage of cokemaking while also providing the volatile content necessary to create the 
necessary porosity of coke product
In practice, coals with volatile contents between 29 and 31% (classified as mid high-vols) are included in the 
high-volatile category
Good mid-volatile coals provide some of each of the characteristics of the low- and high-volatile coals and 
help span the differences between the two types

In order to support product homogeneity, coals in a coking blend 
should have widely overlapping plastic ranges

The Gieseler Plastometer test is a common method of measuring fluidity, which utilizes a mechanical stirrer 
turning through a sample of finely ground coal in a small crucible that is being heated
The maximum fluidity in rotations per minute or Dial Divisions per Minute (DDPM) is the most widely used 
result of this test (rankings are shown above)
The fluidity of the coking blend should be approximately 2,000 DDPM
Because coals can lose fluidity over time, sellers (and buyers) should be aware of the time a coal has been 
in inventory or transit

The CSN or Free-Swelling Index (FSI) is a measure of expansion 
during heating

The FSI or "coke button" of a coal is an older measure of coking properties
Unlike the Audibert-Arnu test, during the FSI test, the sample is heated quickly in a crucible 
without any constraint
An FSI of 8 – 9 indicates the coal has a good coking value
FSI is still useful in identifying oxidized coals but has been largely replaced by the Arnu test

The Composition Balance Index (CBI) measures the ratio of 
reactives and inerts in a coal

Coal is composed of organic matter and minerals (i.e, ash)
• Some of the organic matter is highly reactive and becomes plastic, devolatizes, and solidifies when heated, 

thus forming the porous carbonaceous matrix of coke

• Other parts of the organic material and ash are non-reactive or "inert" and act as an aggregate, or filler, to 
strengthen the coke wall during cokemaking

There is an optimum balance between reactives and inerts in producing high quality coke (shown above)
A coal is inert-deficient at a CBI less than 1.0 and has an overabundance of inerts at a CBI greater than 1.0
Typically, low-vol coals have an abundance of inerts and high-vol coals are inert-deficient

Reflectance is often used as a measure of coal rank

The reflectance test uses a sample of finely 
ground coal that is mounted in a thermoplastic 
or cold-set resin and polished
An oil coating is applied to the polished 
surface of the sample, and the maximum 
reflectance of this sample is measure 
numerous times across the area of the 
polished sample
The average of the measurements is 
designated as Ro , or reflectance
Coals with medium to high rank (1.0 – 1.6%) 
generally produce stronger coke than other 
coals
However, tests in Japan and elsewhere 
measuring coke strength after reaction (CSR) 
indicate that the role of reflectance varies 
depending on the source coalfield

High volatile coals are typically considered to be "A-grade" or 
"B-grade"

A-grade high-volatile coals have reflectance values that range between 1.00 and 1.10 and 
fluidities that are over 30,000 DDPM (nearly all buyers for coke plants agree on this definition) 
B-grade high volatile coking coals have reflectance values that range between 0.99 and 0.90, 
although metallurgical coal buyers are in less agreement on lower limit of the B-graded coals  

• Some buyers will accept coals down to Ro = 0.85

• The flexibility depends on the availability of Grade-A high-volatile coals, prices and the other 
coals in the blend

If a coal has a marginal reflectance (0.99 or 0.98) and a very strong fluidity (28,000 to 30,000 
DDPM) it may be treated as an A-grade coal  
In Central Appalachia, the B-Grade coals are most likely to enter and exit the market as 
demand rises and falls

Raven's Seam 1 product has been classified as high volatile coking coal.  By contrast, typical Canadian 
coking coals found in Alberta and mainland British Columbia tend to be low- or mid-volatility coking coals. 
While the crucible swelling number (CSN) is 8.0 (typical of hard coking coals), some of the other quality 
characteristics are not ideal; therefore, the primary use of this product will be as a blend coal in the 
steelmaking process. The coal quality is similar to Australia's New South Wales (NSW) semi-soft coking 
coals, with the primary differentiator being the CSN.  In our past work for Compliance Energy, Raven Seam 
1 coal was priced at semi-soft coking coal levels using a specification of 1% sulfur.

A higher sulfur specification would result in a lower price.  At this time, the penalty for increased sulfur is 
about $1/tonne for every 0.1% increase in sulfur.  The resulting price forecast for Raven coal (at the higher 
sulfur specification) is shown below.

Compliance Energy has retained Wood Mackenzie to 
prepare a thermal coal price forecast for the Raven Coal 
Project for the period 2010 through 2030.

The Raven Coal Project includes approximately 80% 
high volatile bituminous A coking coal and 20% thermal 
coal to be developed on Vancouver Island, British 
Columbia.  This coal is expected to be exported from 
Port Alberni.

The Raven thermal coal has a slightly higher energy content than the 
Newcastle thermal benchmark price, but it also have a higher sulfur content

The Raven thermal coal has a gross calorific value of 7,000 kcal/kg on an air-dried 
basis.

• Using the proximate analysis, the energy content on a gar basis has been calculated to  
be 6,479 kcal/kg.  The sulfur content is 1.16% (as received).

• The Newcastle thermal benchmark price is based on 6,322 kcal/kg gar basis, and a 
maximum sulfur content of 0.8%. 

Because the Raven thermal coal will compete with more than the Newcastle thermal 
coal, we averaged several competing coals, but included a freight differential, which 
benefits the Raven thermal coal.
We believe the upward bound of the thermal price will be the Newcastle benchmark, 
adjusted for the better heat content, but recognize that there could be a slight sulfur 
penalty.
Going forward, it will be crucial to watch the freight market.  If freight rates fall 
significantly, the differential that increases the Raven thermal pricing advantage could 
disappear.

	Key Findings
	Contents
	The Raven Seam 1 product is a high volatile metallurgical coal with semi-soft coking characteristics and a hard coking coal CSN 
	Although Raven coal swells like a hard coking coal, its quality more accurately reflects that of a high volatile semi-soft coal.
	The Raven quality generally compares favorably to Australian NSW semi-soft coals
	Raven coal is mostly unique in Canada given its higher volatility and higher CSN value
	A comparison of Raven Seam 1-type with selected seaborne coking coals
	Contents
	Wood Mackenzie coal prices are determined using a sophisticated price forecast methodology
	A host of factors are driving coal market dynamics…
	…which impact Wood Mackenzie's coal price forecast
	Prices are derived in part through the use of the Wood Mackenzie International Coal Trade (ICT) Model
	Note that historical relationships between coking coal and thermal coal have been altered…
	…and now, Wood Mackenzie modeling indicates that a robust global pricing environment supports a strong price outlook for the Raven coal
	Raven coal prices will react to new supply entering the market then grow slowly and steadily over time in line with other globally traded coals.
	Contents
	Metallurgical coal broadly includes all coal used in the steelmaking process, while coking coal is specifically that coal which can be coked
	Not all coking coals are created equal…and a number of quality measures help determine a coal's coking properties
	Volatile matter is an important factor in a coal's performance in the coke oven
	In order to support product homogeneity, coals in a coking blend should have widely overlapping plastic ranges
	The CSN or Free-Swelling Index (FSI) is a measure of expansion during heating
	The Composition Balance Index (CBI) measures the ratio of reactives and inerts in a coal
	Reflectance is often used as a measure of coal rank
	High volatile coals are typically considered to be "A-grade" or "B-grade"
