1 SUMMARY 

 GEOLOGY SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
The Rose Property (the Property) is located in the southern portion of the Middle and Lower Eastmain 
Greenstone Belt (MLEGB). Although the MLEGB shows a wide variety of rock types, most of the Property is 
underlain by intrusive lithologies.  These are mainly syntectonic (2,710 to 2,697 Ma), with lesser volumes of late 
to post-tectonic intrusions (<2,697 Ma). 

Gabbros, pyroxenites, and diorites cut across the Property geology.  Pegmatites occur as irregular but generally 
continuous lenses within biotite schists.  Historical work in the 1960s by the Ministère des Ressources 
naturelles du Québec (MRNQ), now the Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles (MERN), followed by 
additional regional-scale government work, uncovered four showings on the Property, two of which (Rose and 
Pivert) were have been examined more closely by the issuer.  Both are showings of lithium and rare-element 
mineralization in pegmatites. 

Other rock types, including gneiss, dacite, quartzite and conglomerate, have also been reported.  Lithologies are 
generally well foliated with a SE orientation, except for the more massive and unfoliated granites and 
pegmatites. 

Mineralization recognized to date on the Property includes rare-element LCT-type pegmatites and 
molybdenum occurrences  

Critical Elements started drilling the Property in late 2009.  This report considers 255 holes drilled by the 
company for a total of 29,135.50 m. Of those 255 holes, 202 (totalling 25,200.90 m) were included in the current 
resource estimate.   

 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
The 2017 Rose Deposit Mineral Resource Estimate presented in this report (the 2017 MRE) was prepared by 
Pierre Luc Richard, P.Geo., M.Sc., using all available information.  The 2017 MRE was prepared as part of a 
mandate assigned by Critical Elements in 2016. 

The 2017 main resource area measures 1,600 m along strike, 1,300 m wide and 300 m deep.  The resource 
estimate is based on a compilation of all recent diamond drillholes and wireframed mineralized zones largely 
inspired by previous work.  The final model was constructed by InnovExplo. The result of this study is a single 
Mineral Resource Estimate for 23 mineralized zones.  The estimate includes Indicated and Inferred resources 
for open pit and underground scenarios.  The effective date of the resource estimate is August 29, 2017, based 
on compilation status. 

Mineral Resources were compiled using a minimum NSR cut-off of CAN$110 for the underground potential and 
CAN$30 for the open-pit potential.  Parameters used to determine such cut-offs are presented in the report. The 
NSR cut-offs must be re-evaluated continually according to prevailing market conditions and other factors, 
such as lithium and tantalum prices, exchange rate, mining method, related costs, etc. 

Table 1.1 displays the results of the in situ Mineral Resource Estimate for the Project at the official $30 NSR cut-
off for the open-pit scenario and at the official $110 NSR cut-off for the underground scenario.

Notes: 
— $30 NSR Cut-Off for the Open-Pit Scenario and at $110 NSR Cut-Off for the Underground Scenario. 
— Given the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, the drillhole density, and the specific 

interpolation parameters, InnovExplo is of the opinion that the current mineral resource estimate can be 
classified as Indicated and Inferred resources.  The estimate was prepared in accordance with CIM's 
standards and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves. 

— The independent and qualified person for the Mineral Resource Estimate, as defined by NI 43-101, is 
Pierre-Luc Richard, P.Geo., M.Sc., of InnovExplo Inc.  The effective date of the estimate is August 29, 2017. 

— These Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. 
— The model includes 23 mineralized zones. 
— Results are presented in situ and undiluted. 
— Sensitivity was assessed using cut-off NSR values for $5-10 increments from $20 to $150.  The official 

resource is reported at a cut-off of $30 NSR for the open-pit and $110 NSR for the underground potential, 
based on market conditions.  Cut-offs must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions (metal 
price, exchange rate and mining cost). 

— A range of densities was used on a per-zone basis based on statistical analysis of all available data. 
— A minimum true thickness of 2.0 m was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a 

value of zero when not assayed. 
— High-grade capping was done on raw assay data based on the statistical analyses of individual mineralized 

zones. 
— Compositing was done on drillhole intercepts falling within mineralized zones (composite lengths range 

from 1.5 m to 3 m in order to adequately distribute the tails). 
— Resources were evaluated from drillholes using a 2-pass OK interpolation method in a block model (block 

size = 5 m x 5 m x 5 m). 
— The Inferred category is only defined within the areas where blocks were interpolated during Pass 1 or Pass 

2 where continuity is sufficient to avoid isolated blocks being interpolated by only one drillhole.  The 
Indicated category is defined only by blocks interpolated by a minimum of two drillholes in areas where the 
maximum distance to the closest drillhole composite is less than 40 m for blocks interpolated in Pass 1.  

— Ounce (troy) = tonnes x grade / 31.10348.  Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and ppm). 
— The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest hundred.  Any discrepancies in the totals are due to 

rounding effects.  Rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101. 
— InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-

political, marketing, or other relevant issue that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.

 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
Metallurgical test work performed at SGS Lakefield was used to define design criteria for the spodumene plant.  
Bench scale metallurgical test work was performed on outcrop and drillcore samples having lithium grades from 
1.0% Li2O (bench scale test work) to 1.45% Li2O (pilot scale test work).  Variability drillcore composites tested had 
head grades; 0.99% Li2O to 2.15% Li2O except for one composite (PEG2) with 0.80% Li2O that did not produce 
acceptable grade-recovery due to the presence of higher levels of amphiboles and pyroxenes in the ore.  

Metallurgical test work on nine representative drillcore composites having a lithium head grade varying 
between 0.50% Li2O and 1.70% Li2O was conducted at SGS laboratory to investigate its effect on grade/recovery.  
Results show that a head grade of 0.85% Li2O could produce a chemical grade lithium concentrate of 5.0% Li2O 
with a recovery over 90% or a technical grade lithium concentrate of 6.0% Li2O with a recovery over 87%. 

Tantalum upgrading test work at SGS Lakefield shows that tantalum grading 2.0% Ta2O5 recovered by magnetic 
separation could be upgraded to 20% Ta2O5 by gravity separation. 

The proposed flowsheet is comprised of conventional three-stage crushing and single-stage grinding followed 
by magnetic separation for the recovery of tantalum, mica flotation, and spodumene flotation.  

Settling and filtration tests were performed by rewetting the combined dry tailings from the production tests 
to obtain design criteria for sizing thickener and filtration equipment.  Dry spodumene concentrate available 
from previous test work was used to perform settling and filtration tests to generate design criteria for sizing 
spodumene concentrate dewatering circuit.  

 MINING 

1.4.1 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 

The Mineral Reserves estimate (Table 1.2) for the Project was prepared by Mr. Patrick Frenette, P.Eng, an 
employee of InnovExplo Inc. and is effective as of August 4, 2017.  The Mineral Reserves estimate stated herein 
is consistent with the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and is suitable for public 
reporting. As such, the Mineral Reserves are based on Measured and Indicated Resources, and do not include 
any Inferred Resources. Measured and Indicated Resources are inclusive of Proven and Probable Reserves. 

The Feasibility Study (FS) Life-of-Mine plans and Mineral Reserves estimate were developed from the geological 
block model prepared by InnovExplo, with the exception that a constant mill recovery is used.  The effects of 
using a constant recovery were found to not materially affect the results of the FS.  As of the date of this report, 
the QP has not identified any risks, legal, political, or environmental, that would materially affect potential 
development of the Mineral Reserves.

— The Independent and Qualified Person for the Mineral Reserve Estimate, as defined by NI 43-101, is Patrick 
Frenette, P.Eng, M.Sc.A, of InnovExplo Inc.  

— The effective date of the Mineral Reserves estimate is August 4, 2017. 
— The reserve estimate is based on the current resource estimate with the exception of a constant recovery of 

85% Li2O. Metal prices are set at US$15,000/t Li2O and US$130$/kg Ta2O5 using an exchange rate of 
1.25 CAN$:US$. Metallurgical recoveries set constant at 85% for Li2O and 64% for Ta2O5.  The cut-off NSR 
value of CAN$29.70/t. 

— The reserve estimate includes 12.3% dilution and 5% ore loss. 
— The model includes 20 mineralized zones, of which 17 are included in the mining plan. 
— Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and ppm). 
— The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals 

are due to rounding effects.  Rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101. 
— InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-

political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the Mineral Reserve Estimate. 

1.4.2 MINING METHODS 

The Rose deposit is made of stacked mineralized lenses oriented N296° with an average dip of 15° to the 
northeast (varying locally between 5° and 25°).  The orebody is relatively flat and close to the surface, so the FS 
is based entirely on an open pit operation. 

A conventional truck and shovel mining method is proposed to mine 220.2 Mt of material over the mine life, 
comprising 26.8 Mt of ore, 182.4 Mt of waste and 11.0 Mt of overburden, for an average stripping ratio of 7.2:1.  
This FS is based on a milling capacity of 1,610,000 tonnes per year.  To achieve these milling production targets, 
the yearly mining production rate will vary accordingly between 12 and 16 Mt of rock material and decrease 
towards the end of the mine life.  All overburden material will be mined by a contractor. The open pit mining 
schedule resulted in a LOM of approximately 19 years, starting with 19 months of pre-production, just over 16 
years of production, and ending with 5 months of stockpile processing.  The mine plan includes four different 
phases to delay overburden removal, to keep the ore extraction rate relatively constant, and to improve mill 
feed grade in the first years of the Project. 

1.4.3 GEOTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

The pit design for the Project is based on single benching with 10-m bench heights.  This bench height was 
selected based on the loading and hauling equipment that would best suit the mining operation.  The 
geotechnical report recommends an inter-ramp angle of 57° and an overall pit slope angle of 55°.

1.4.4 FINAL PIT DESIGN 

The final pit design, based on the selected optimized pit shell and geotechnical parameters.  The pit design 
includes haulage ramp access to all benches, except for the final bench which will be excavated via a temporary 
ramp. 

1.4.5 MINING PHASE DESIGNS 

Based on the Whittle pit shell optimizations, three nesting intermediate pit shells were used as guidelines to 
design the mining phases.  By subdividing the ultimate pit into these four separate phases, the ore mining rate 
is kept relatively constant.  The selection of these mining phases results in a low production rate for the pre-
production period and improves the mill feed grade in the first years of the Project. 

1.4.6 MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 

The life-of-mine plan (LOM) for the Project is based on an ore processing rate of 1,610,000 t per calendar year.  
The LOM plan was prepared to supply the required ore quantities to the mill while reducing the overall 
quantities of material to be mined, and to send higher grade ore to the mill in the first years of operation.  

1.4.7 WASTE ROCK, OVERBURDEN, AND TAILINGS MANAGEMENT 

Two stockpiles have been designed to store mining waste. One large waste rock stockpile is located directly to 
the west of the pit and near the main ramp exit, and one overburden stockpile is located south of the pit.  

The waste rock pile will be constructed in two phases.  A co-deposition strategy will be used to store dry 
tailings from the mill and mined waste rock on the same pile. 

1.4.8 MINING EQUIPMENT 

Based on the production targets and operational constraints, the loading fleet comprise a 7.4 m3 backhoe 
excavator for ore handling, a 15 m3 electric hydraulic front shovel for waste rock handling, and a 13.8 m3 
production wheel loader for operational flexibility.  

The ore mined from the pit will be hauled by a maximum of seven ±65t payload trucks while, while waste 
mining, dry tailings transport and reclaimed ore will be hauled by a maximum of seven ±135t payload trucks. 

Most production drilling will occur in waste as the strip ratio for the Project is high.  Two high capacity rotary 
diesel blasthole drills are dedicated to drilling waste panels, whereas drilling in ore panels will be performed by 
a down-the-hole drill rig.  The down-the-hole drill is also suited to perform pre-splitting of the final walls.  
During the pre-production period, this drill will also perform all drilling in waste panels. 

1.4.9 MANPOWER 

A total of 199 employees will be needed at the peak of mining operations, not including contractors.  This 
manpower requirement is based on an operation that runs 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and 350 days 
per year. 

As the site is remotely located, the working schedule for all employees will be a fly-in/fly-out rotation of two 
working weeks and two rest weeks, for 12 hours each day.

 RECOVERY METHOD 
The spodumene plant will be located near the open pit mine.  The plant will be designed to process 4,900 tonnes 
per day and 365 days per year at 90% availability.  Run-of-Mine (ROM) will be transported to the crushing plant.  
The ore will be crushed to a P80 12.7 mm in three stages using conventional crushing equipment:  jaw crusher, 
secondary cone crusher, and tertiary cone crusher.  The crushed ore will be stockpiled under a storage dome.  

Crushed ore will be ground in a ball mill to a grind size, P80 220 μm.  The ground ore will feed the magnetic 
separation circuit for recovering tantalum grading 2.0% Ta2O5 from the flotation feed.  Tantalite recovered will 
be thickened, filtered, dried to 1% moisture in a rotary dryer, and stored in a 100 tonne tantalite silo.  A bagging 
system installed under the silo will be used to ship the tantalite concentrate in 1.0 tonne bags.  

The non-magnetics from the magnetic separation circuit will be deslimed ahead of mica flotation. The flotation 
circuit consists of mica flotation followed by attrition scrubbing prior to spodumene flotation.  

Mica concentrates, slimes from scrubbing, and spodumene scavenger tailings will be thickened and filtered in a 
vacuum disc filter for producing tailings with a moisture content of 15% for dry stacking.  Truck and loading 
arrangement will be used to dispatch tailings to the waste rock facility.  The spodumene flotation concentrate 
will be thickened, filtered, and dried to 1% moisture in a rotary dryer.  The dried spodumene concentrate will 
be stored in a silo.  A truck loading system installed under the spodumene silo will be used to ship the 
concentrate in bulk loads.  

 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
The Project is accessible via Route du Nord (North Road), a gravel-top road open year-round which links the 
Cree village of Nemaska and Chibougamau.  From Nemaska, the well-maintained Eastmain-1 gravel road, which 
belongs to Hydro-Québec, leads directly to the Project.  The Project can also be reached from Matagami via 
Route 109, Route de la Baie-James and Route du Nord.  
The closest airport is located in Nemaska, 30 km south of the Project, near Nemiscau electrical station (50 km 
by road). The airport is owned and operated by Hydro-Québec and weekday flights to Montréal via Air Creebec 
are offered.   Figure 1.1 shows the Property location.

The project infrastructure includes:  

— Waste rock and dry tailings co-deposit pile; 
— Ore stockpile and industrial pad;  
— Service and haulage roads;  
— Overburden stockpile;  
— Explosive and cap magazine storage;  
— LNG, diesel and gasoline storage and distribution;  
— Truckshop, warehouse, administrative building and gatehouse; 
— Spodumene process plant;  
— Main electrical substation and distribution; 
— Communication system;  
— Surface water management and final effluent treatment; 
— Fresh and potable water supply;  
— Sewage. 

The combined waste and dry tailings co-deposit was selected in order to reduce infrastructure footprint. The 
total capacity of the pile is 102M m³, which is sufficient to contain the waste rock and the dry tailings during 
mining operation. A toe berm for the dry tailings retention and dripping water filtration is included. Dry 
tailings will be prepared in the spodumene process plant and hauled to the waste stockpile by mine trucks. 

The ore pad will have an approximate capacity of 3.9M T (1.6M m³) and will be adjacent to industrial pad. An 
overburden stockpile with a capacity of 11.3M T (6.0M m³) will contain materials coming from the pit 
excavation required to reach bedrock and other infrastructure development. 

Installed on the industrial pad, LNG storage and distribution will be required on site for the carbonation plant 
kiln. Since this infrastructure is required, it will be used at the beginning of the Project for the heating of the 
buildings and for the drying of the concentrates. 

The diesel (45,000 litres) and gasoline (10,000 litres) storage and distribution system will also be installed on the 
industrial pad. In order to reduce the equipment required on site, it is planned that a contractor operated diesel 
tanker truck will directly fill the mobile and mining fleet. 

The truckshop, wash bay, and warehouse structural steel arch-type fabric buildings will be installed side by side 
on the industrial pad and mounted on sea. The truckshop will offer four repair bays, a lube unit room, a tool 
crib, and offices and will be equipped with an overhead crane. The wash bay will be a dedicated building 
considering its special needs in terms of HVAC and water supply. The warehouse will have a storage capacity of 
750 m² and will also contain a small truck repair bay and a welding bay. There will also be a smaller heated 
fabric building to park the emergency vehicle.  

The administrative building is planned to be a two-storey modular construction mounted on wood blocks with 
a skirt to allow heating of the piping installed underneath. The 26 modules connected together include offices, 
dry area and other required installations. The gatehouse will be an independent module also mounted on wood 
blocks. A 48-space parking lot and a 80,000-tonne truck scale will be installed near the gatehouse. 

All the water coming from waste stockpile, industrial pad and ore pad will be directed to an equalization pond 
for final effluent treatment.

A 315 kV electrical transmission line owned by Hydro-Québec runs north-south over the eastern section of the 
Project. The transmission line will need to be relocated approximately 500 m east of the mining pit by 
Hydro-Québec.  The Project main substation will be fed by this 315 kV line (15.6 MVA load). 

The internet will be supplied via microwave towers linked with the Eeyou Communications network in 
Nemaska. A project-wide optic fibre network will link all buildings, allowing transfer of data such as 
automation, administrative, security camera, fire alarm system and voice over IP phone communications. 

 ENVIRONMENT 
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) document was submitted to both federal (Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Agency) and Provincial (review Committee of the James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement, or 
COMEX) authorities for review in July 2017.  Following the deposit of the EIA, changes have occurred in the 
development of the mining infrastructures (the EIA used the mining infrastructure plan of March 2017), an 
addenda will be filed to the authorities to update the project description and respond to the preliminary 
comments received from the authorities. Following the deposit of the addenda and meetings with the 
authorities, a series of questions and comments will follow to give more details, if required, on certain aspects 
of the project.  

An Environmental Baseline was done for water, soil, fauna (including fish), flora and social.  Consultations with 
the First Nations were held prior to submitting the Impact Study, and regular communications are ongoing 
with the Communities. 

The results of the EIA showed no major negative impacts on the receiving environment (fauna, flora and 
social), and showed positive impact on economic development, training and business opportunities for the 
neighboring communities. 

Several measures will be taken with regards to the progressive closing works for the mine.  The waste pile will 
be revegetated, as the lower benches are accessible, and so will all areas that are no longer used for 
exploitation.  At closure, the site of the mine infrastructures, the waste rock and tailings pile, the 
sedimentation ponds, and any road which will not be used for post closure monitoring operations, will be 
restored and covered with vegetation. 

After examining all documents and having held the required consultations, Québec's ministry of Sustainable 
Development, Environment, and The Fight against Climate Change (MDDELCC) and the Canadian Environment 
Minister can grant the general Authorizations for the mine Project. 

 ECONOMICS 
A Life-of-Mine (LOM) cash flow model was constructed based on the LOM production schedule for the Rose 
deposit.  The key outcomes of the economic evaluation for 100% of the Project, before any financing costs, are 
presented in Table 1.3.  All costs are estimated in Canadian dollars (CAN$) and referenced as '$', unless 
otherwise stated.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the economic model to test changes in key economic assumptions, 
namely commodity prices, operating cost, capital cost, and exchange rate.  The Project's pre-tax and after-tax 
NPV were most sensitive to the factors impacting revenue, that is, Li2O commodity pricing, Li2O metal recovery, 
and currency exchange rate.  All sensitivities were analyzed as mutually exclusive variations. 

 RISKS 
Factors such as the ability to obtain permits to construct and operate a mine, obtain major equipment and 
skilled labour on a timely basis may impact the ability to achieve the presented production plans and cost 
estimates, thus causing actual results to differ substantively from those presented in the economic analysis. 

Project financing: 
— As with all resource development projects there is an inherent risk that the project will not be able to raise 

the necessary capital to fund any new construction.   

Commodity pricing: 
— This Project is exposed to commodity pricing on the world markets, and in fact shows its greatest 

sensitivity to commodity pricing.  Tight control on Capital and Operating spending will alleviate some of 
the sensitivity to commodity pricing, but under an extended period of depressed lithium markets, the 
Project would be marginal to uneconomical.

2 INTRODUCTION 
This Technical Report was prepared to support a Feasibility Study (FS) in Québec's Regulation 43-101 respecting 
standards of disclosure for mineral projects.  The main objective of the FS is to demonstrate that the Rose 
Lithium-Tantalum Project (the Project) has sufficient merit from a technical, environmental and economic 
point-of-view to justify moving towards the EPCM phase. 

 PURPOSE OF THE TECHNICAL REPORT AND PRELIMINARY 
ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT 

WSP Canada Inc. (WSP) was commissioned in June 2016 by Mr. Jean-Sébastien Lavallée, President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Critical Elements Corporation (Critical Elements), to complete an independent 
Technical Report on the Project.  This Technical Report complies with National Instrument 43-101 Standards 
and Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101), Companion Policy 43-101CP and Form 43-101F1 as amended on 
May 9, 2016.  It includes an economic analysis of the potential viability of mining the mineral resources of the 
Project. 

The purpose of the FS consisted in evaluating the potential for mining, milling and metallurgical processes of 
the Project.  This FS took into account all necessary infrastructure required for the development of the Project.  
The results of the FS were disclosed by Critical Elements in a News Release on September 6, 2017. 

This FS is based on developing the Project over a 17-year production period using a conventional truck and 
shovel open pit operation and a conventional milling process to produce technical and chemical grade 
spodumene concentrates and a tantalite concentrate. 

This Technical Report was prepared as a collaborative effort between InnovExplo of Val-d'Or, Québec for the 
Mineral Resources, Reserves and Mining, Bumigeme of Montreal, Québec for the Metallurgy and Mineral 
Processing, Gerrit Fuelling for the Market Study, Vincent Jourdain of MRB & Associés of Val-d'Or, Québec for 
the adjacent property description, Denis Vachon for the indirect capital costs and general and administrative 
costs, and WSP Canada, Québec and Ontario for all other aspects of the study including, surface infrastructures, 
economic analysis, environmental considerations and report integration.  The Report presents the Qualified 
Persons' findings, conclusions, and recommendations. 

The economic analysis presented in this Technical Report is based on Indicated Mineral Resources only.  
Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and economic 
considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.  

 ISSUER OF THE TECHNICAL REPORT 
This Technical Report was prepared for Critical Elements Corporation (Critical Elements, CEC), a Canadian 
mining exploration company based in Montréal, Québec, Canada.  Critical Elements is the issuer of this 
Technical Report as per NI 43-101.

3 RELIANCE ON OTHER EXPERTS 
The Qualified Persons (QP) who prepared this report relied on information provided by experts who are not 
QPs.  The QP's who authored the sections in this report believe that it is reasonable to rely on these experts, 
based on the assumption that the experts have the necessary education, professional designations, and 
relevant experience on matters relevant to the Technical Report. 

— Olivier Joyal, relied upon GESTIM Plus from Énergie et Ressources Naturelles du Québec for the mining 
titles extracted from their Website January 25, 2017 as well as Critical Elements for guidance on the titles 
that are part of the Property described in Section 4. 

— Olivier Joyal, relied upon Critical Elements for the description of their relation with stakeholders described 
in Section 20.  

— Philippe Rio Roberge, relied upon independent consultant, Gerrit Fuelling, Diplom Ingenieur (TU) for 
market studies and contracts information used in Section 19.   Mr. Fuelling's relevant experience is as 
follows.  Since April 1989 he has worked in the Lithium business, sales and marketing as well as 
management of Chemetall GmbH, later Rockwood Lithium GmbH till November, 2015. This company and its 
successor is one of the leading integrated lithium suppliers in the world.   He has been instrumental and 
responsible amongst other business duties for the Asian set up of the lithium business for more than 25 
years as well as from 2011 initiator and mentor for the QA/QC program related to establish quality systems 
which comply with automotive standards.  Between 2011 and 2015 Mr. Fuelling was President of Rockwood 
Lithium Asia and member of the management team of Rockwood Lithium GmbH and as such reporting to 
Dr. Steffen Haber, at that time CEO of the Rockwood Lithium Group.  Asia is the focus of the global lithium 
battery and related materials development and his work was essentially to lead, align adjust the business of 
Rockwood Lithium to this industry in this region (i.e.  redirecting the business set up towards the emerging 
battery business for electro-mobility). As such, he has been in, and commanded over, business and personal 
relationships with most active and relevant market players on the customer side.  

— Philippe Rio Roberge relied upon Critical Elements and its external advisors for guidance on royalties and 
buy-back options as well as taxes and other government levies of the economic analysis described in

 PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND AGREEMENT 
The Project is made of 473 active mining titles spread over 24,654 ha.  Mining titles are grouped into one 
continuous block (Figure 4.3).  

The mineralization identified, to date, on the Project includes LCT-type pegmatites and molybdenum indices.  
An iron index is also mentioned in the government database.   

A table showing the mining titles comprising the Project as of August 30, 2017 is included in Appendix 4-A. 

On November 29, 2010, First Gold (now Critical Elements Corporation) announced the closing of a transaction 
with Jean-Sébastien Lavallée (a director and the interim president and chief executive officer of First Gold), 
Jean-Raymond Lavallée and Fiducie Familiale St-Georges (together the Vendors) to increase its interest in the 
Pivert-Rose project from 85% to 100% in consideration of a cash payment of $225,000 and the issuance of 
7,500,000 common shares of First Gold.  Critical Elements Corporation fulfilled its obligations and now owns 
100% of the Rose property.  The Vendors retained a 2 % net smelter return royalty on the Property, half of 
which (1 %) can be bought back by Critical Elements Corporation for $1,000,000.  

According to the GESTIM database (Québec's mining title management system), all mining titles comprising the 
Project are currently registered to Critical Elements Corporation.  Other than what is discussed in the above 
transactions, no liens or charges appear to be registered against the Property.  

All claims seem to be in good standing according to the GESTIM database (Québec's mining title management 
system), although a total of 69 active claims are affected by electrical power transmission lines.

 TENURE RIGHTS 
A land lease will need to be obtained from the provincial government (the custodian of the Crown lands). This 
will be applicable to all lands where construction work is required (surface rights). This land lease will need to 
be acquired before permit requests. As such, a land lease request will be prepared and submitted to the MERN 
at least a year before the permits are required as the Ministry must include consultation with Aboriginal 
Communities before delivery of the land lease. 

A mining lease will also be needed for the area where the pit will be located. 

4.3.1 JAMES BAY AND NORTHERN QUÉBEC AGREEMENT 

The territorial regime introduced by the James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement (JBNQA) is a determining 
factor in land use.  It provides for the division of the territory into Category I, II, and III lands. 

Category I lands are reserved for the exclusive use of the Cree.  They may be used for residential, community, 
commercial, industrial or other purposes. In addition, the Cree have an exclusive right to hunting, fishing and 
trapping.  

Category II lands are contiguous to Category I lands.  They are part of the public domain of Québec.  These are 
lands where the Cree have exclusive rights of hunting, fishing and trapping.  They are part of the public domain 
of Québec.   

Category III lands represent all lands in the Agreement Area not included in Category I and Category II lands.  
On these lands, the Cree enjoy the exclusive right to trap fur animals.  In addition, certain wildlife species are 
reserved for their hunting and fishing activities.  In these territories, hunting and fishing are permitted for 
both native and non-native people.  In Category III lands, mining rights belong to the provincial government. 
The Project is located on Category III lands. 

 ROYALTIES AND RELATED INFORMATION  
The Property is subject to a 2% net smelter return royalty to Jean-Raymond Lavallée, Jean-Sébastien Lavallée, 
and Fiducie Familiale St-Georges.  Critical Elements may purchase half of the net smelter return (1%) for 
$1,000,000. 

 ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES 
The mineral resources will be mined by excavating an open pit to a depth of 200 m.  The pit itself will disturb an 
area of about 140 ha.  The combined pit and infrastructures of the Project will directly impact an area of 
approximately 725 ha. 

It is worth noting that the development of the proposed open-pit for the Project will require drainage of two 
small bodies of water, identified as Lake 1 and Lake 2 on Figure 4.4.

 PERMITS 
All required permits to conduct exploration work are current. 

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) document was submitted to both federal (Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Agency) and Provincial (review Committee of the James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement, or 
COMEX) authorities for review in July 2017.  Following the deposit of the EIA, changes have occurred in the 
development of the mining infrastructures (the EIA used the mining infrastructure plan of March 2017), an 
addenda will be filed to the authorities to update the project description and respond to the preliminary 
comments received from the authorities.  Following the submission of the addenda and meetings with the 
authorities, a series of questions and comments will follow to give more details, if required, on certain aspects 
of the Project.  

After these steps, the Québec's ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment, and The Fight against 
Climate Change (MDDELCC) can great a general certificate of authorization (CA) for the mine Project. 

 OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS 
Three high-voltage power transmission lines cross over the Property.  One of these crosses over the planned 
open pit operation and will need to be relocated. 

The Eastmain hydroelectric reservoir is located to the east of the Property.  Hydro-Québec has an exclusion 
zone east of the Project. Any work on the exclusion zone would require the consent of Hydro-Québec.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 ACCESSIBILITY 

ROAD 

The Project is accessible via Route du Nord (North Road), a gravel-top road open year-round which links the 
Cree village of Nemaska and Chibougamau.  From Nemaska, the well-maintained Eastmain-1 gravel road 
belonging to Hydro-Québec leads directly to the Project.  The site can also be reached from Matagami, via Route 
109, Route de la Baie-James and Route du Nord.  Figure 5.1 shows the main access roads to the site. 

The Route du Nord is a 407 km entirely unpaved road in central Québec.  It starts at km 0 in Chibougamau and 
ends at a junction with Route de la Baie-James (James Bay highway), 275 km north of Matagami.  Extensive 
logging is present along the southern half of the Route du Nord. 

A junction with a main gravel road leading to the Eastmain-1 hydroelectric power station exists at km 291 of 
the Route du Nord.  The Project is located some 43 km north of that junction.  The east part of the Project 
overlaps the Eastmain-1 road so that the road passes a mere 320 m east of the proposed open-pit.  The Project is 
located less than 20 km south of the Eastmain-1 power station (24 km using roads).  Access to the Project is 
available year-round. 

AIRPORT 

The closest airport is located in Nemaska, 30 km south of the Project, at km 294 of the Route du Nord, near 
Nemiscau electrical station (50 km by road).  The airport is owned and operated by Hydro-Québec.  The 
Nemaska airport offers weekday flights to Montréal, via Air Creebec, a regional air carrier.  Flight time from 
Nemaska to Montréal is approximately two-and-a-half hours.   

Small craft landing strips are also located in Eastmain, 164 km west of the Project (258 km by road), and in 
Waskaganish, 190 km west of the Property (297 km by road). 

PORT 

Port facilities are found in Eastmain, 170 km west of the Project in the James Bay, and 700 km south of the 
Project in Grande-Anse in the Saguenay River (municipality of La Baie).  The Grande-Anse Marine Terminal is a 
deep-sea general cargo port facility, open year-round, accredited by the International Ship and Port Facility 
Code to receive vessels from abroad of more than 100,000 deadweight tonnes.  The Grande-Anse Marine 
Terminal provides direct connection with international ocean shipping lines.  As a result, it could eventually 
play an important role in the shipment of raw materials to, and of lithium and tantalum concentrates from the 
Project site. 

RAILROAD 

The closest railway is in Chibougamau, providing a connection with the North American railroad network.  Rail 
service is also available in Matagami.  Figure 5.1 shows the location of Northern Québec's main roads, airports, 
ports and railroads.

 PHYSIOGRAPHY 
The Project is located at the 52nd parallel north in Central Québec, Canada, well south of Nunavik's southern 
limit.  The Project is characterized by a relatively flat topography (Figure 5.2).  The relief in the vicinity of the 
Project consists of rounded hills separated by low vegetation-covered valleys.  Elevations range between 
269 masl and 328 masl.

The Project lies on the line of demarcation of the Eastmain and Pontax watersheds.  Figure 5.3 shows the 
various watersheds within the Property with the proposed infrastructure and open pit. 

Several waterbodies are found on the Property. The proposed mining plan includes drainage of two small lakes 
identified as Lake 1 and Lake 2. Lake 3 is not drained. The shoreline of these three lakes lies at elevation 
288 masl.  Lake 1 is located on the south side of the proposed open-pit, Lake 2 on its north-west side, and Lake 3 
on the north-east side.

A bathymetric assessment of Lake 1 and Lake 2 revealed that they are small and shallow waterbodies.  Lake 1 
has an elongated oval shape oriented in a general northeastern direction.  Lake 1 is approximately 660 m long x 
120 m wide x 2.3 m at its deepest point (Figure 5.4).  Lake 2 has a diamond shape oriented in a general 
northeastern direction.  Lake 2 is approximately 480 m long x 200 m wide x 6.5 m at its deepest point 
(Figure 5.5).  The volume of water contained is estimated at approximately 90,050 m3 for Lake 1, and at 
186,300 m3 for Lake 2. 

Lake 3 is significantly larger than Lake 1 and Lake 2.  It has an irregular shape roughly made of a circular middle 
extending into two arms along a northeastern direction (Figure 5.6).  Lake 3 is approximately 2,000 m long x 
455 m wide at its widest point, and 11 m at its deepest point.  However, the average width of Lake 3 is about 
130 m.  The volume of water contained in Lake 3 is estimated at approximately 1,082,640 m3.

 FAUNA AND FLORA 
The vegetation of the Project is typical of the boreal forest (Figure 5.7).  Mature black spruce constitutes the 
predominant tree species, with occasional birches, poplars, alders and deciduous bushes.  The predominance of 
peatland and black spruce increases towards the north. The tree stratum is mostly composed of gray pine, black 
spruce and white spruce.  The shrub stratum is mainly composed of green alder, sheep-laurel, Labrador tea, 
lowbush blueberry and few willows.  The herbaceous stratum is sparse and little diversified.  Eight wetland 
classes were identified in the study area, totalling a surface area of approximately 3,100 ha.  No plant at risk was 
observed during the various field campaigns. 

Field surveys have confirmed the presence of 12 fish species within the study area (WSP, 2017a).  No species at 
risk were captured during surveys.  Species caught are: white sucker, northern pike, yellow perch, lake 
whitefish, yellow walleye, brook trout, burbot, lake chub, pearl dace, longnose dace, mottled sculpin, and slimy 
sculpin.  According to the Act respecting Hunting and Fishing Rights in the James Bay and Northern Québec 
Territories, lake sturgeon, white sucker, burbot, and lake whitefish are strictly limited to the use of First 
Nations.  

Several herpetofauna species were observed during field surveys:  american toad, northern spring peeper, mink 
frog, green frog, wood frog, northern two-lined salamander, and common garter snake.  No species at risk were 
observed.  

The various field surveys confirmed the presence of 87 bird species belonging to 30 families (WSP, 2017b).  Nine 
species were confirmed to have the breeding status, 21 species the probable breeding status, and 38 the possible 
status.  Five bird species at risk were observed in the study area: peregrine falcon, rusty blackbird, bald eagle 
(immature), short-eared owl, and common nighthawk.  

Mammals found in the vicinity of the Project include moose, bear, fox and caribou (woodland and migratory 
ecotypes).

 CLIMATE AND OPERATING SEASON 
Because of its continental location approximately 200 km east of James Bay, the Project area receives less 
precipitations than other regions located at similar latitude along the shore.  The climate is sub-arctic, 
characterized by long cold winters and short cool summers.  Break-up usually occurs early in June and 
freeze-up in early November. 

Weather conditions have been recorded at La Grande Rivière A since 1975 (Table 5.1).

Data recorded at the above weather stations include air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, 
precipitations and relative humidity.  Each station records some of the data for part of the year.  Details 
concerning climatic conditions found at the Project will be provided in a separate report currently being 
prepared for the Environmental Impact Assessment study. 

On average, the Project site gets about 444 mm of rain and 267 cm of snow per year.  Prevalent winds come 
from the south-east at an average speed of 15 km/h.  Average wind speeds are fairly constant over the year, 
varying between 14 and 16 km/h. 

Average annual temperature ranges between -23 ºC in January and 14 ºC in July (Table 5-2).  The coldest 
temperature recorded at La Grande Rivière A weather station was -45 ºC, while the warmest was 35 ºC (WSP. 
2017c). 

Access to the Project is available year-round.

 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURES 

5.5.1 LOCAL RESOURCES 

Limited services are available along the Route du Nord. At km 290, the Cree Construction Company offers fuel 
and repair services.  Also, fuel, food, and lodging can be obtained in the Cree village of Nemaska.  Food and 
limited lodging are available at the Eastmain-1 power station, provided prior arrangements have been made to 
that effect with Hydro-Québec.  Eeyou-Istchee surrounding communities are shown on Figure 5.8. 

The nearest significant community to the Project is the town of Chibougamau (population: 8,000) located 
265 km south-east of the Property (350 km by road).  Chibougamau is the major supply centre for regional 
resource-based industries.  The town of Matagami (population: 1,500) also offer services and is located 270 km 
south-west of the Property, 430 km using roads. 

5.5.2 INFRASTRUCTURE 

Critical Elements maintained an exploration camp on the Project in recent years, with capacities adapted to 
drilling campaigns requirements.  All equipment and supplies required for the exploration camp are brought 
on site via road transportation.  Drillcore samples are sent directly to Val-d'Or for storage.  The Project is not 
fenced and no other infrastructures are currently found at the site. 

Some parts of the Project are serviced by the Bell cellular telephone network, but reliability is an issue. A 
microcell system covering approximately 2 km wide could be added to increase reliability. 

Hydro-Québec established a camp, 24 km north of the Project on the Eastmain-1 road, to service the workers' 
needs during the construction of the Eastmain-1 power station.  This camp had a capacity to lodge over 
2,500 workers, but it is now dismantled.  A much smaller camp was built on the same site in recent years for 
Eastmain-1 power station workers, with a much smaller capacity (around 150 people).  However, existing 
infrastructure such as potable water, sewage, and electrical power could ease construction of a new camp for 
mine workers.  Critical Elements is investigating the option of negotiating an agreement with local contractors 
to build and operate camp facilities to accommodate the Project workers. 

5.5.3 POWER 

Hydro-Québec owns several infrastructures and facilities in the area including the EM1-Nemiscau 315 kV 
transmission line, which bisects the proposed Project open-pit from north to south, and a 735 kV transmission 
line located some 3.5 km south of the Property.  

Development of the proposed open-pit will require dismantling five towers of the 315 kV line (length of 2.7 km) 
and installing 11 new ones (4.2 km), east side of the open-pit.  Studies and arrangements with Hydro-Québec for 
site connection and transmission towers relocation are underway. 

For safety reasons related to mine blasting operations, a safety distance of 500 m from open-pit walls to the 
existing and new towers is complied with.  Furthermore, usual precautionary measures during blasting, such as 
the use of proper stemming within boreholes collars, road signage warning of imminent blasting, banning of 
radio-transmission during blasting, will need to be applied to prevent damages that could arise from fly rocks. 

The Eastmain-1 hydroelectric power station, located approximately 24 km north of the proposed open pit, is 
planned to supply power to the future mine.

6 HISTORY 
Most of the historical work prior to 2005 consisted of regional surveys conducted by the Government of Québec 
or by a few mining companies.  Recently, there has been a bit more activity from mining companies in the area.  
Table 6.1 summarizes historical work declared as assessment work by mining companies working on, or in the 
vicinity of, the Property.  Drilling from 2009 to 2016 is furthermore detailed in Section 10 - Drilling. 

Only one historical drillhole is known to have been drilled on the current Property.  Hole 555-09 was drilled by 
Dios Exploration in 2008 to test a magnetic anomaly.  The hole intercepted biotite granitic gneiss followed by 
feldspar-porphyric diorite.  No samples were assayed and the core was left at the drill site. 

Critical Elements started drilling on the Property in December 2009 under the name First Gold Exploration Inc. 
and acquired 100% interest in the Rose Tantalum- Lithium Project in November 2010 from J.-S. Lavallée, J-R 
Lavallée and Fiducie Familiale St-Georges.  Details concerning the current ownership of the Property are 
presented in Section 4.2 of the present Technical Report.

 HISTORICAL MINERAL RESOURCES ESTIMATES 

On September 30, 2010, InnovExplo prepared a Technical Report on the Property which stated that the Rose 
showing was the most significant mineralization recognized on the Property at that time.  The purpose of the 
September 2010 report was to provide an update on the Property, as well as make recommendations for an 
exploration program.  The analyses carried out showed significant mineralized values of lithium (Li) and 
tantalum (Ta), with interesting values of rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), gallium (Ga), and beryllium (Be). 

The report was then updated on January 24, 2011.  No Mineral Resources estimate was included in these 
reports.  Both Technical Reports are available on SEDAR, the System for Electronic Document Analysis and 
Retrieval filing system developed for the Canadian Securities Administrators at www.sedar.com. 

On September 7, 2011, InnovExplo prepared the first NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resources estimate for the 
Property.  This Mineral Resources estimate was then used as a base for the December 10, 2011 Technical Report 
and Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Rose Lithium-Tantalum project prepared by Genivar.  Both 
Technical Reports are available on SEDAR.

7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 

The Property is located in the northeastern part of the Archean Superior Province (Figure 7.1) of the Canadian 
Shield, more precisely within the Middle and Lower Eastmain Greenstone Belt (MLEGB).  

Most of this section was borrowed and modified from Card and Poulsen (1998), which provides a thorough 
description of the regional geology, and from Moukhsil et al. (2007), which synthesizes the geology and 
metallogenesis of the MLEGB.  Other sources were also used to complete the description of the geological 
setting, such as assessment reports, the authors' personal knowledge of the region, and information provided 
by the issuer.

 REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING (ARCHEAN SUPERIOR 
PROVINCE) 

The Archean Superior Province forms the core of the North American continent and is surrounded and truncated 
on all sides by Proterozoic orogens, the collisional zones along which elements of the Precambrian Canadian 
Shield were amalgamated (Hoffman, 1988, 1989).  The Superior Province represents two million square kilometres 
free of significant post-Archean cover rocks and deformation (Card and Poulsen, 1998).  Tectonic stability has 
prevailed since ca. 2.6 Ga in large parts of the Superior Province (Percival, 2007).  The rocks of the Superior 
Province are mainly Mesoarchean and Neoarchean in age and have been significantly affected by post-Archean 
deformation only along boundaries with Proterozoic orogens, such as the Trans-Hudson and Grenville orogens, or 
along major internal fault zones, such as the Kapuskasing Structural Zone.  The rest of the Superior Province has 
remained stable since the end of the Archean (Goodwin et al., 1972). 

Proterozoic and younger activity is limited to rifting along the margins, emplacement of numerous mafic dyke 
swarms (Buchan and Ernst, 2004), compressional re-activation, large scale rotation at ca. 1.9 Ga, and failed 
rifting at ca 1.1 Ga.  With the exception of the northwest and northeast Superior margins that were pervasively 
deformed and metamorphosed at 1.9 to 1.8 Ga, the craton has escaped ductile deformation.  A first-order 
feature of the Superior Province is its linear subprovinces of distinctive lithological and structural character, 
accentuated by subparallel boundary faults (Card and Ciesielski, 1986).  Trends in the Superior Province are 
generally easterly in the south, westerly to northwesterly in the northwest, and northwesterly in the northeast 
(Figure 7.1).  The southern Superior Province (to latitude 52°N) is a major source of mineral wealth.  Owing to 
its potential for base metals, gold and other commodities, the Superior Province continues to attract mineral 
exploration in both established and frontier regions.  

 LOCAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING (MIDDLE AND LOWER EASTMAIN 
GREENSTONE BELT) 

The MLEGB is located in the middle of the James Bay region, about 420 km north of Matagami (Figures 7.1 and 7.2).  
This greenstone belt trends approximately E-W and extends over an area 300 km long and 10 to 70 km wide 
(Moukhsil et al., 2007). 

The MLEGB consists of volcano-sedimentary rock sequences derived from volcanic eruptions in an oceanic 
environment (i.e.  mid-ocean ridges, oceanic platforms and volcanic arcs) that were subsequently injected by 
calc-alkaline intrusions of gabbroic to monzogranitic composition.  Like the Abitibi Greenstone Belt, the MLEGB 
has no basement, sensu stricto.  The La Pêche Pluton is the oldest intrusion, dated at 2747 +3/-2 Ma (Moukhsil 
and Legault, 2002), compared with 2751 +0.6/-0.8 Ma for the Kauputauch Formation (Moukhsil et al., 2001).  The 
volcanism of the Eastmain sector therefore occurred in the absence of an ancient felsic crust (basement 
sensu stricto), as is evidenced by inherited zircon ages from volcanic rocks that range from 2745 to 2713 Ma and 
from intrusions that crosscut the MLEGB (2747 to 2723 Ma) ( Moukhsil, 2000; Moukhsil et al., 2001).  This 
contrasts sharply with the eruptive setting of the volcanic rocks of the La Grande Belt (2800 to 2738 Ma) 
(Figure 7.1), which was emplaced in the presence of an ancient (3520 to 2810 Ma) tonalitic protocraton 
(Goutier et al., 1999a,b and 1998a,b). Proterozoic activity in the MLEGB was limited to the injection of N-S, NW-
SE and NE-SW diabase dykes.

At least three deformation phases can be recognized within the MLEGB (Moukhsil et al., 2007).  The first phase 
(D1), with an estimated age of 2710 to 2697Ma (minimum ages of syntectonic intrusions), is associated with 
roughly E-W schistosity (S1).  The second phase (D2), with an estimated age of 2668 to 2706 Ma (Moukhsil and 
Legault, 2002), is associated with NE-SW schistosity (S2), roughly N-S in several areas.  The D2 deformation 
phase is responsible for the second NNE-SSW shortening in the James Bay area and is probably equivalent to 
the event that occurred around 2690 Ma in Opatica (Boily, 1999).  The third phase (D3), whose age is estimated 
at <2668 Ma (age of metamorphism), affects the syn- to post-tectonic intrusions, among others.  This 
deformation phase was non-penetrative and less evident on a regional scale.  However, it is more pronounced 
in the metasedimentary rocks where it trends WNW-ESE to NW-SE.  The MLEGB was affected by a set of faults 
or shear zones.  Most of these faults are spatially linked to the mineral occurrences found in the MLEGB.  There 
are three possible orientation systems for the distribution of these structures.  The first system runs E-W, the 
second ENE-WSW and the third NW-SE.  Since the principal schistosity (S1) is E-W, Moukhsil et al. (2007) 
postulate that the E-W-trending faults predate the other faults.  The relationship between the two other 
systems is not clear, but it appears that the NE-SW-trending faults predate the NW-SE-trending faults in the 
Lake Elmer section (Moukhsil et al., 2007). 

There are several major tight to isoclinal regional-scale folds (Moukhsil and Doucet, 1999).  Franconi (1978) 
prepared a synthesis on this topic, concluding that the MLEGB features a large synclinorium with an E-W axis, 
whose core is occupied by the rocks of Opinaca. 

Metamorphism ranges from greenschist to amphibolite facies.  Gauthier and Laroque (1998) and Moukhsil 
(2000) identified a metamorphic front characterized by large folds overturned to the south at the contact 
between Nemiscau metasediments and MLEGB volcanics.  Contact metamorphism is amphibolite facies, 
especially around syn- to post-tectonic intrusions.  Granulite facies has been identified mainly in the middle of 
the sedimentary basins of Nemiscau and Opinaca.  Locally, a few orthopyroxene grains are observed in the 
paragneisses of the Auclair Formation (Moukhsil and Legault, 2002). 

 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
The Property is located in the southern portion of the Middle and Lower Eastmain Greenstone Belt (Figures 7.2 
and 7.3). 

Although the MLEGB shows a wide variety of rock types, most of the Property is underlain by intrusive 
lithologies.  Based on the regional geology interpretation of Moukhsil et al. (2007), these are mainly syntectonic 
(2,710 to 2,697 Ma), with lesser volumes of late to post-tectonic intrusions (<2,697 Ma). 

Gabbros, pyroxenites, and diorites cut across the Property geology.  Pegmatites occur as irregular but generally 
continuous lenses within biotite schists.  Historical work in the 1960s by the Ministère des Ressources 
naturelles du Québec (MRNQ), now the Ministère de l'Énergie et des Ressources naturelles (MERN), followed by 
additional regional-scale government work, uncovered four showings on the Property, two of which (Rose and 
Pivert) were been examined more closely by the issuer.  Both are showings of lithium and rare-element 
mineralization in pegmatites. 

Other rock types, including gneiss, dacite, quartzite and conglomerate, have also been reported.  Lithologies are 
generally well foliated with a SE orientation, except for the more massive and unfoliated granites and 
pegmatites. 

Mineralization recognized to date on the Property includes rare-element LCT-type pegmatites (Block A) and 
molybdenum occurrences (Block A).  An iron occurrence (Block B) is also mentioned in the government 
database.

7.3.1 PIVERT SHOWING 

First discovered in 1961 by the MRNQ, the Pivert showing was later revisited during the MRNQ's regional 
mapping program in 2001.  The showing is approximately 4.6 km south of Pivert Lake on Block A. 

The MRNQ recognized lithium and beryllium mineralization in a pegmatite dyke hosted by paragneiss units.  
The pegmatite dyke was described as being approximately 10 m wide and of unknown length because it only 
cropped out for a few metres.  It contains approximately 20% spodumene (lithium aluminum silicate), with 
crystals up to 20 cm long.  Beryl (beryllium aluminum silicate) and molybdenite (molybdenum sulphide) were 
also noted.  A grab sample taken from the MRNQ yielded 1.16% Li and 74 ppm Be. 

Critical Elements collected four grab samples from the Pivert showing as discussed in Section 9 - Exploration, 
and drilled eight holes as discussed in Section 10 - Drilling.  The work added rare elements (Rb, Cs, Ta, Ga) to the 
original Li-Be mineralization reported by the MRNQ. 

Mr. Pierre-Luc Richard, P. Geo, M.Sc., visited the Pivert showing (Figure 7.4) and visually confirmed the 
presence of mineralization. He determined that the pegmatite dyke was oriented N280/30.  A single grab 
sample confirmed the type of mineralization, as discussed in Section 12 - Data Verification.

7.3.2 ROSE DEPOSIT 

Like the Pivert showing, the original Rose showing was discovered in 1961 by the MRNQ and revisited during a 
regional MRNQ mapping program in 2001.  It is approximately 2.3 km southwest of Pivert on Block A. 

The MRNQ's description of the Rose showing in 1961 was similar to the description for Pivert:  lithium and 
beryllium in pegmatite dykes hosted by melanocratic gabbro.  In contrast to Pivert, where only one pegmatite 
dyke was recognized at surface, Rose was described as several pegmatite dykes, with one up to 20 m wide. 

The MRNQ reported that spodumene and lepidolite (potassium lithium aluminum silicate) constituted up to 
40% of the pegmatites.  A grab sample collected by the MRNQ yielded 0.21% Li and 129 ppm Be.

Critical Elements collected 25 grab samples on the Rose deposit as discussed in Section 9 - Exploration, and 
drilled 181 holes as discussed in Section 10 – Drilling.  The company's work added rare elements (Rb, Cs, Ta, Ga) 
to the original Li-Be mineralization reported by the MRNQ. 

Mr. Richard visited the Rose deposit (Figure 7.5).  He visually confirmed the presence of the mineralization and 
collected five grab samples, which confirmed the type of mineralization, as discussed in Section 12 - Data 
Verification.  The lengths of the pegmatite dykes could not be determined by surface observations, but later 
modelling (as part of the current resource estimate) shows the mineralized pegmatitic dykes oriented N296 
with a shallow average dip of 15° to the northeast (locally from 5° to 20°).

7.3.3 JR SHOWING 

Discovered by Critical Elements while prospecting in the vicinity of the Rose and Pivert showings, the 
JR showing is approximately 2.4 km south-southwest from Pivert.  It is easily accessible because it crops out on 
both sides of the main gravel road. It is now considered part of the Rose deposit. 

Critical Elements collected 3 grab samples from the JR showing as discussed in Section 9 - Exploration, and 
drilled 23 holes as discussed in Section 10 - Drilling.  The JR showing is very similar to the Rose and Pivert 
showings in terms of geological context and mineralization.  It consists of Li, Be, Rb, Ta, Cs, and Ga enrichment 
in pegmatite dykes.  Surface observations were insufficient to determine the length of the dyke because it crops 
out for only 30 m. 

Mr. Richard visited the JR showing and visually confirmed the presence of mineralization (Figure 7.6).  He 
determined that the orientation of the pegmatite dyke was similar to that of the Pivert and Rose pegmatites 
(N280/30).  Two grab samples were assayed and confirmed the type of mineralization as discussed in Section 12 
- Data Verification. 

The QP considers the JR showing to be part of the Rose deposit now that the area between the Rose deposit and 
the JR showing has been drilled.  In this report, the JR showing has been integrated into the Rose deposit for 
resource estimation purposes.

7.3.4 HELICO SHOWING 

The Helico showing was discovered by Critical Elements while prospecting in the vicinity of the Rose and Pivert 
showings.  It is located approximately 1 km SSE of the Pivert showing. 

Critical Elements drilled 12 holes as discussed in Section 10 - Drilling.  Helico is very similar to Rose, Pivert and 
JR in terms of geological context and mineralization.  It consists of Li, Be, Rb, Ta, Cs, and Ga mineralization in 
pegmatite dykes.  The QP did not visit the Helico showing. 

7.3.5 PIVERT EAST SHOWING 

The Pivert East showing was discovered by Critical Elements while prospecting in the vicinity of the Rose and 
Pivert showings. It is located approximately 1 km SE of Pivert. 

Critical Elements drilled two holes as discussed in Section 10 - Drilling.  Pivert East is very similar to Rose, 
Pivert, and JR in terms of geological context and mineralization. It consists of Li, Be, Rb, Ta, Cs, and Ga 
mineralization in pegmatite dykes.  The QP did not visit the Pivert East showing. 

7.3.6 PIVERT SOUTH SHOWING 

The Pivert South showing was discovered by Critical Elements while prospecting in the vicinity of the Rose and 
Pivert showings.  It is located approximately 1 km SE of Pivert. 

Critical Elements drilled two holes as discussed in Section 10 - Drilling.  Pivert South is very similar to Rose, 
Pivert, and JR in terms of geological context and mineralization.  It consists of Li, Be, Rb, Ta, Cs, and Ga 
mineralization in a pegmatite dyke.  The QP did not visit the Pivert South showing. 

7.3.7 OTHER OCCURRENCES 

Mr. Richard examined another occurrence not mentioned in the government database:  a molybdenite- and 
spodumene-bearing pegmatite dyke on the side of the main gravel road (UTM83, Zone18: 422188E, 5765993N), 
midway between the Pivert (900 m NE) and JR showings (1.5 km SSW) (Figure 7.7).   Molybdenite and 
spodumene were observed in the pegmatite, which cuts through a deformation zone without showing any signs 
of being affected by it. 

No samples were analyzed, but its presence suggests other occurrences are likely in the area.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The Middle and Lower Eastmain Greenstone Belt (MLEGB) contains more than a hundred mineral showings 
exhibiting a variety of ages, host rocks, styles (disseminated sulphides, massive sulphides, veins and dykes) and 
metal suites.  

The mineral occurrences of the MLEGB have been divided into six types according to Moukhsil et al. (2007): 
— Type 1: Sulphide facies iron formation; 
— Type 2: Volcanogenic mineralization; 
— Type 3: Magma-related mineralization; 
— Type 4: Orogenic mineralization; 
— Type 5: Gold-bearing mineralization associated with oxide- or silicate-facies iron formations; 
— Type 6: Pegmatite-related mineralization. 

Types 1 to 3 are associated with an episode of volcanic arc construction (volcanic cycles 1 to 4).  Types 4 and 5 
are contemporaneous with major deformation events (D1 and D2), whereas Type 6 is associated with 
post-tectonic intrusions. 

Based solely on its geological environment, the Property has the potential to host a number of deposit types.  
However, based on the known discoveries, only the type recognized in Type 6 (Rare-Element LCT-type 
Pegmatite) will be discussed herein. 

Pegmatites constitute a category of granite-related ore deposits that are distinct from the magmatic ores 
disseminated within granites and from hydrothermal assemblages.  Granitic pegmatites have been the subject 
of numerous attempts at classification, but Cerny and Ercit (2005) provided the most recent update.  These 
authors stipulate that, in addition to geochemical composition, the geological location should also be taking 
into account in the classification of granitic pegmatites, leading to the following division of five classes: 
— Abyssal; 
— Muscovite; 
— Muscovite – rare-element; 
— Rare-element; 
— Miarolitic. 

Most of these classes can be subdivided into subclasses with fundamentally different geochemical (and in part 
geological) characteristics.  Further subdivision of most subclasses into types and subtypes is based on more 
subtle differences in geochemical signatures or pressure and temperature conditions of solidification, expressed 
as different accessory mineral assemblages.  The second approach proposed by Cerny and Ercit (2005) is 
petrogenetic and developed for pegmatites derived by igneous differentiation from plutonic parents.  Three 
families are distinguished: 

— An NYF family with progressive accumulation of Nb, Y and F (besides Be, REE, Sc, Ti, Zr, Th, and U), 
fractionated from subaluminous to metaluminous A- and I-type granites that can be generated by a variety 
of processes involving depleted crust or mantle contributions. 

— A peraluminous LCT family marked by prominent accumulation of Li, Cs and Ta (besides Rb, Be, Sn, B, P, 
and F), derived mainly from S-type granites, less commonly from I-type granites. 

— A mixed NYF + LCT family of diverse origins, such as contamination of NYF plutons by digestion of 
undepleted supracrustal rocks.

 GENERAL MODEL FOR RARE ELEMENT LCT-TYPE PEGMATITES 
Based on the pegmatite classification in Cerny and Ercit (2005) and the assay results from the Property, the 
pegmatites recognized to date are clearly of the rare-element LCT-type.  Thus, only this subtype will be 
discussed further. 

8.1.1 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS 

According to Cerny et al. (2005), rare-element pegmatite deposits of the LCT family are encountered in orogens 
from the early Archean to very recent; i.e.  from ~3 Ga (Trumbull, 1995) to 6.8 Ma (Pezzotta, 2000).  The 
granite-pegmatite suites are syn- to late orogenic and related to fold structures, shears and fault systems.  The 
pegmatites vary greatly in form, controlled mainly by the competency of the enclosing rocks, the depth of 
emplacement, and the tectonic regime during and after emplacement.  The pegmatites rarely occur within 
their parent granites, but in such cases they form swarms or networks of fracture-filling dykes hosted by 
contraction fractures or structures generated by post-consolidation stresses (e.g.  Ginsburg et al., 1979).  Most 
of the deposits are hosted by schists and gneisses, and their shapes vary from lenticular, ellipsoidal, turnip- or 
mushroom-like forms in plastic environments, to fracture-filling dykes and stocks in brittle host rocks 
(e.g.  Cameron et al., 1949).  The length of a mineralized pegmatite intrusion is typically tens to hundreds of 
metres, but they may attain several kilometres (Greenbushes, Australia; Partington et al., 1995), and 
interconnected dyke systems are known to be up to 12 km long (Manono, Zaire; Thoreau, 1950). 

An important pattern emerges in the generalized scenario and especially in the zoning sequences for individual 
pegmatite districts (Cameron et al., 1949; Norton, 1983; Cerny et al., 2005).  The minerals present in each zonal 
assemblage decrease in number from the margins (border and wall zones) to the central or latest primary unit, 
termed the core.  Assemblages of the border and wall zones typically consist of quartz-plagioclase-microcline-
muscovite-biotite-garnet-tourmaline-(beryl-apatite), and the internal zoning sequence usually ends with 
nearly monomineralic masses of microcline followed by a monomineralic quartz core.  Crystallization along a 
liquidus surface, wherein the number of coexisting phases increases with decreasing temperature, produces 
the opposite trend in the sequence of mineral assemblages (e.g.  Burnham and Nekvasil, 1986). 

The shape and attitude of pegmatite intrusions have considerable control over the internal structure of the 
deposits (Cerny et al., 2005).  Homogeneous bodies are exceptional, and a primary oriented fabric is generally 
restricted to the albite-spodumene type (e.g.  Oyarzábal and Galliski, 1993).  The pegmatites are largely 
concentrically zoned or layered, or they display a combination of both features (Cameron et al., 1949; 
Beus, 1966; Cerny, 1991b).  Concentric patterns typical of substantially three-dimensional bodies can be 
extensively disturbed in flat pegmatites.  Sub-vertical dykes commonly exhibit telescoping of strongly 
asymmetric zoning patterns, with the inner zones prominently shifted upward.  The zoning progresses from 
finer grained zones of more or less granitic composition on the outside to inner zones that exhibit enrichment 
in rare-element mineralogy and textural diversity, but some are also near-monomineralic. 

In conjunction with the accumulation of rare-element mineralization in the inner zones, complex pegmatites 
also show inwardly increasing geochemical fractionation in rock-forming minerals (e.g. Cerny et al. 1985; 
Cerny, 2005; London, 2005, which serves as an important exploration guide (e.g.  Cerny, 1992). 

More detailed descriptive information on general features of granitic pegmatite deposits, including mineralogy, 
geochemistry, REE abundances, and fluid inclusion studies can be found in Cameron et al. (1949), Beus (1966), 
Solodov (1962), Cerny (1989a, 1991b), and Cerny et al. (1998).

8.1.2 EMPLACEMENT OF PEGMATITE MELTS 

Passive emplacement of pegmatite magma was historically advocated by many authors, but 
structural-geological analysis contradicts this interpretation (Cerny et al., 2005).  Forcible intrusion is indicated 
in all closely examined cases (Brisbin, 1986) and relevant theoretical considerations and experiments 
(e.g.  Rubin, 1995a, b).  Beus (1966) arrived empirically at 2 km for the maximum distance of a pegmatite from 
its parent granite.  In contrast, Baker (1998) considers the magma pressure in the parental chamber sufficient 
to propel low-viscosity pegmatite melts up to 10 km from the source. 

Increasing contents of Li, B, P, F, and H2O reduce polymerization, increase fluidity and mobility, and enhance 
thermal stability of pegmatite melts to lower temperatures (Cerny et al., 2005).  Thus, the pegmatite melts that 
are most enriched in volatiles and rare-elements can travel the farthest from their source (Figure 8.1).  This 
explains the regional zoning of rare-element pegmatites around parental granites (Cerny, 1992.  The Li-rich 
complex pegmatites in general and the lepidolite-subtype dykes in particular, are invariably the most distal 
ones relative to the parent plutons (Cerny et al., 2005).  These categories of LCT rare-element pegmatites locally 
appear to be divorced from granites by interplay of host structures and erosional exposure.  In individual 
pegmatite dykes, internal diversity in fluidity promotes geochemical and paragenetic telescoping 
(e.g.  Beus, 1948; Cerny and Lenton, 1995). 

Pegmatite dykes commonly occur as groups of similar pegmatite-types that originated from the same parent 
granite intrusion.  A pegmatite field can occur over territories of hundreds to thousands of square kilometres 
when favourable conditions are met.  Finally, pegmatite provinces are described as huge terranes characterized 
by commonality of geologic history that tend to generate arrays of pegmatite fields that are at least loosely 
related in time, structural style, and mode of origin.  A more detailed definition of these terms is given by 
Cerny et al. (2005): 

— A pegmatite group is a spatially and genetically coherent pegmatite population, generated by 
differentiation of a single granitic pluton.  Pegmatite dykes interior, marginal, and exterior to a particular 
fertile granite intrusion may be neatly distributed around the plutonic parent, although asymmetric arrays 
are much more common (Fig. 8.1; Beus, 1966; Kuzmenko, 1976; Cerny, 1989b, 1990, 1991c; Cerny et al. 2005).  
Radiometric dating confirms in many cases the link between fertile granites and surrounding pegmatite 
dykes (e.g.  Baadsgaard and Cerny, 1993; Trumbull, 1995; Breaks et al., 2005).  The pegmatites tend to show 
different kinds and degrees of mineralization in a regional zonal pattern, concentric to unidirectional.  The 
common progression from proximal to distal pegmatites is from barren to Be, Be-Nb-Ta, Li-Be-Ta-Nb, and 
Li-Cs-Be-Ta-(F) assemblages, with B, P, and Sn appearing at (and generally also increasing from) locally 
different stages.  The zoning tends to be particularly strongly developed vertically, with the most evolved 
pegmatites at the top of the three-dimensional array.  Locally, the more evolved pegmatites are relatively 
late, as they crosscut the primitive dykes (e.g.  Cerny, 1991c, 1992b). 

— Pegmatite fields are the results of favourable conditions for partial melting that generate fertile granites 
and are regional in scale, and they commonly lead to intrusion and differentiation of multiple fertile 
plutons over territories of hundreds to thousands of square kilometres (Cerny et al., 2005).  The ensuing 
pegmatite fields contain granite-pegmatite suites that are more or less closely related, having been 
mobilized and differentiated from related or identical metamorphic protoliths during a single anatectic 
event.  This results in similarities in mineral assemblages and geochemical signatures of the granite-
pegmatite groups. 

— Pegmatite provinces are huge terranes characterized by commonality of geologic history that tend to 
generate arrays of pegmatite fields that are at least loosely related in time, structural style, and mode of 
origin; geologic provinces locally represent rare-element pegmatite provinces of enormous dimensions 
(Landes, 1935; Gordiyenko, 1974; Ginsburg et al., 1979; Cerny, 1991a, c).

8.1.3 WELL-STUDIED PEGMATITE ORE DEPOSITS 

Two examples of well-studied pegmatite deposits showing similarities with the known Rose pegmatites are 
presented here as a reference.  At the current exploration stage of the Property, the extent of the mineralized 
pegmatites has not yet been fully investigated.  Therefore, the authors do not make any assumption that the 
Rose pegmatites are comparable in terms of tonnage and/or grade to the deposits presented in this section.  
These deposits should be considered in light of their general characteristics and not in terms of their 
established economic characteristics.  

The first example is the extensively studied Tanco deposit (Figure 8.2) in the Archean Superior Province of the 
Canadian Shield in southeast Manitoba.  It is described in Cerny et al. (1998), Cerny (2005), Stilling et al. (2006) 
and Cerny et al. (2005).  This 2640 Ma pegmatite is completely hidden and forms a subhorizontal lenticular body 
consisting of four concentric and five layered zones about 1.3 km long (Fig 8.2; Cerny et al., 2006).  It belongs to 
an extensive series of cogenetic, closely associated pegmatites, but the parent granite is not exposed.  However, 
nearby pegmatite groups of similar character show a clear connection to pegmatitic leucogranites.  
Near-extreme igneous fractionation of Rb, Cs, Ga, and Ta characterizes Tanco, which is enriched in these metals 
as well as Li, Be, B, and P, and a variety of industrial minerals.  Nevertheless, the overall composition of the 
pegmatite is close to granitic, despite the assemblage of approximately 100 minerals (Stilling et al., 2006). 
Petalite, largely decomposed into secondary spodumene + quartz, dominates over minor late primary 
spodumene and over subordinate amblygonite-montebrasite and lepidolite.

The second example is the Mongolian Altai 3 deposit (Figure 8.3), which shows extensive reserves of 
spodumene (Cerny et al., 2005).  Mongolian Altai 3 (also known as Keketuhai, Keketuohai, or Koktogai), dated at 
330 Ma, is located in the central part of an Altai Caledonian-Hercynian fold belt in northwest China.  It belongs 
to an extensive suite of cogenetic leucogranites and pegmatites.  The pegmatite forms a vertical plug with far-
reaching sub-horizontal sheets branching from its base (Figure 8.3).  Ten concentric zones show a classic 
progression from mineralogically simple outer assemblages to complex and then near-monomineralic 
associations in the interior.  Multi-generational minerals show the same progressive fractionation pattern as in 
the Tanco pegmatite above.

 RARE-ELEMENT PEGMATITES FROM THE SUPERIOR PROVINCE 
Although Selway et al. (2005) reviewed only rare-element pegmatites in the Superior Province of Ontario and 
Manitoba, excluding the large portion of the Superior Province in Québec, the authors of this report consider 
the study to be applicable to the Québec portion of the Superior in which the Property is situated.  The 
following text has been largely adapted from Selway et al. (2005).

According to Selway et al. (2005), rare-element pegmatite dykes within the Superior Province (in Ontario and 
Manitoba) usually cluster to form pegmatite fields that contain one or two large and highly fractionated 
pegmatites and numerous small pegmatite dykes. For example, the Bernic Lake pegmatite group, part of the Cat 
Lake-Winnipeg River pegmatite field in southeastern Manitoba, includes the Tanco pegmatite (1.99 km long x 
1.06 km wide x 100 m thick; Stilling, 1998) and eight other smaller, less-fractionated pegmatite dykes (Cerny et al., 
1981).  The Separation Rapids pegmatite group lies to the east of the Cat Lake–Winnipeg River pegmatite within 
the same Bird River–Separation Lake metavolcanic belt (Breaks et al., 1975).  The Separation Rapids pegmatite 
group contains two large highly fractionated pegmatites:  Big Whopper (350 m in strike length x 60 m thick) and 
Big Mack (30 x 100 m; Breaks and Tindle, 1997 Breaks et al., 1999).  The Big Whopper and Big Mack pegmatites are 
members of the Southwestern pegmatite subgroup, which contains at least 23 additional smaller pegmatite dykes.  
Additional large pegmatite fields in the Superior Province of Ontario with economic potential include:  the Dryden 
pegmatite field, which includes the highly-fractionated Fairservice pegmatite dykes and Tot Lake pegmatite, and 
the Seymour Lake pegmatite group, which includes the highly-fractionated North Aubry and South Aubry 
pegmatites (Breaks et al., 2003).  These pegmatites contain elevated Rb, Cs, Be, and Ta contents.  The Case 
pegmatite in northeastern Ontario is unique in that it is a large fractionated pegmatite with no identified 
associated smaller pegmatite dykes, likely due to thick overburden (Breaks et al., 2003). 

Selway et al. (2005) also report on several geological features that are common among pegmatites of the 
Superior Province of Ontario (Breaks and Tindle, 2001; Breaks et al., 2003) and Manitoba (Cerny et al., 1981; 
Cerny et al., 1998): 

— The pegmatites tend to occur along subprovince boundaries.  For example, Tanco (Manitoba) and 
Separation Rapids (Ontario) pegmatites within the Bird Lake-Separation Lake metavolcanic belt occur along 
the boundary between the English River and Winnipeg River subprovinces; the beryl-phosphate 
Sandy Creek and McCombe pegmatites, and the Lilypad Lake pegmatite field occur along the Uchi–English 
River subprovincial boundary; the Dryden pegmatite field occurs within the Sioux Lookout Domain along 
the Winnipeg River–Wabigoon subprovincial boundary; and the North Aubry, South Aubry, and 
Tebishogeshik pegmatites occur along the English River–Wabigoon subprovincial boundary north of 
Armstrong. 

— Most pegmatites in the Superior Province (in Ontario and Manitoba) occur along subprovince boundaries, 
except for those that occur within the metasedimentary Quetico Subprovince.  Examples of pegmatites 
occurring in this area from west to east are:  Wisa Lake (south of Atikokan), the Georgia Lake pegmatite 
field (north of Nipigon), and the Lowther Township (south of Hearst) pegmatites. 

— Pegmatites are present at greenschist to amphibolite metamorphic grade.  In Ontario and Manitoba, 
pegmatites are absent in the granulite terranes of the Quetico and English River subprovinces.  

— Most pegmatites in the Superior Province (Ontario and Manitoba) are genetically derived from fertile 
parent granite.  The Cat Lake–Winnipeg River pegmatite field (Manitoba) contains six leucogranite 
intrusions (Greer Lake, Eaglenest Lake, Axial, Rush Lake, Tin Lake, and Osis Lake) emplaced along 
east-trending faults, which are parents to numerous pegmatites (Cerny et al., 1981; Cerny et al., 1998).  In 
contrast, the Tanco pegmatite has no fertile granite outcropping in reasonably close vicinity that could be 
its potential parent (Cerny et al., 1998).  The peraluminous Separation Rapids pluton (4 km wide) is the 
parent to the Separation Rapids pegmatite field, including Big Whopper and Big Mack pegmatites, north of 
Kenora, Ontario.  The peraluminous Ghost Lake batholiths (80 km wide) is the parent to the Mavis Lake 
pegmatite group, including the Fairservice pegmatite dykes, north of Dryden, Ontario.

— Highly fractionated spodumene- and petalite- subtype pegmatites are commonly hosted by mafic 
metavolcanic rocks (amphibolite) in contact with a fertile granite intrusion along subprovincial 
boundaries, whereas numerous beryl-type pegmatites are hosted by metasedimentary rocks (metawacke or 
metapelite) of the Sioux Lookout Domain.  Pegmatites within the Quetico Subprovince are hosted by 
metasedimentary rocks or their fertile granitic parents.  For example, the spodumene-subtype Wisa Lake 
pegmatite is hosted by metasedimentary rocks south of Atikokan, Ontario.  The MNW petalite-subtype 
pegmatite, north of Nipigon, Ontario, is enclosed within a medium-grained biotite-muscovite granite of the 
MNW stock, which is presumed to be its parent (Pye, 1965).  The lepidolite-subtype Lowther Township 
pegmatite, south of Hearst, Ontario is enclosed within its parent garnet-biotite pegmatitic granite 
(Breaks et al., 2002).  The spodumene-subtype Case pegmatite system is hosted by orbicular biotite tonalite 
in the southeastern part of the Case batholith north of Cochrane, Ontario, within the Opatica Subprovince. 

— Biotite and tourmaline are common minerals within metasomatic aureoles in mafic metavolcanic host 
rocks to pegmatites.  Tourmaline, muscovite, and biotite are common within metasomatic aureoles in 
metasedimentary host rocks. 

— Most of the pegmatites of the Superior Province contain spodumene and/or petalite as the dominant 
Li mineral, except for the Lilypad Lake, Swole Lake, and Lowther Township pegmatite (all in Ontario), and 
the Red Cross Lake lithium pegmatite (Manitoba), which have lepidolite as the dominant Li mineral.  
Amblygonite- and elbaite-dominant pegmatites have not yet been found in the Superior Province, although 
amblygonite and elbaite occur in the Tanco pegmatite. 

— Cesium-rich minerals only occur in the most extremely fractionated pegmatites.  Pollucite occurs in the 
Tanco, Marko's, and Pakeagama petalite-subtype pegmatites, the Tot Lake spodumene-subtype pegmatites, 
and the Lilypad Lake lepidolite-subtype pegmatites (Teertstra and Cerny, 1995).  The Pakeagama pegmatite 
is located in northwestern Ontario along the Sachigo-Berens River subprovincial boundary.  Cesium-rich 
beryl occurs in the spodumene-subtype North Aubry, South Aubry, Case, Tot Lake, and McCombe 
pegmatites and the lepidolite-subtype Lowther pegmatite, all in Ontario, and in the Tanco pegmatite, 
Manitoba. 

— Most pegmatites in the Superior Province contain ferro-columbite and mangano-columbite as the 
dominant Nb-Ta-bearing minerals.  Some pegmatites contain mangano-tantalite as the dominant Ta-oxide 
mineral, for example the North Aubry, South Aubry, Fairservice, Tot Lake, and Tebishogeshik pegmatites.  
The Tanco pegmatite contains wodginite as the dominant Ta-oxide mineral.  Tantalum-bearing cassiterite 
is relatively rare in pegmatites of the Superior Province, except for the Separation Rapids and Tanco 
pegmatites. 

— Fine-grained Ta-oxides (e.g.  manganotantalite, wodginite, and microlite) commonly occur in the aplite, 
albitized K-feldspar, mica-rich, and spodumene core zones in pegmatites in the Superior province.  At 
Tanco, Ta mineralization occurs in the albitic aplite zone (30), central intermediate muscovite-quartz after 
microcline zone (60), and lepidolite zone (90).

9 EXPLORATION 
In addition to drilling (see Section 10), Critical Elements also performed limited prospecting activities on the 
Property that were restricted to the Pivert showing and Rose deposit areas.  The work, which took place in the 
last decade, focused on grab sampling and the visual reconnaissance of pegmatites at both localities, and 
outcrop mapping at Rose only. 

A total of 34 grab samples were collected and sent for analysis (Table 9.1).  Grades for Li, Ta, Rb, Cs, and Be are 
reported in this section as parts per million (ppm).

10 DRILLING 
Critical Elements started drilling the Property in late 2009.  This report considers 255 holes drilled by the 
company for a total of 29,135.50 m. Of those 255 holes, 202 (totalling 25,200.90 m) were included in the current 
resource estimate.   

 DRILLING ON THE PIVERT SHOWING 
Diamond drilling on the Pivert showing is limited to eight holes (NQ core; total of 671.60 m) completed by 
Critical Elements in 2009, 2010, and 2016 (Table 10.1).  The objective of the program was to confirm the 
continuity of the mineralized pegmatite observed at surface.  

The orientations of the eight holes varied from N210 to N010 and the dip varied from 45° to 75°. 

All holes were supervised, logged, and sampled by Consul-Teck Exploration Inc. (Consul-Teck).  The Pivert 
program produced 125 core samples.  Hole LP-09-01 returned anomalous values in Li, Cs, and Rb, and Hole 
LP-09-02 returned anomalous values in rare elements such as Rb and Cs.  Hole LP-09-03 did not intersect any 
significant values.  Holes LP-10-04 and LP-10-06 reported intersected Li, Ta, Rb, Cs, Be, and Ga mineralization, 
while hole LP-10-06 reported only anomalous values.

 DRILLING ON THE ROSE DEPOSIT 
Critical Elements drilled 207 holes (NQ core size; 25,581.90 m) on the Rose deposit in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2016 
(Tables 10.2 and 10.3).  Holes from the Hydro and JR showings are included in this total because they are now 
considered part of the Rose deposit after drilling expanded the original Rose showing to encompass Hydro and JR. 

The original objective of the program was to confirm the continuity of the mineralized pegmatites observed at 
surface.  This objective was quickly upgraded to systematic drilling of the mineralized pegmatites.  

The Rose drillholes were supervised, logged, and sampled by Consul-Teck.  The program produced 4,446 core 
samples.

 DRILING ON OTHER SHOWINGS 
Three other showings were drilled in 2010 and 2016 (Table 10.4).  Nine holes totalling 879 m were drilled on the 
Helico showing, two totalling 102 m on Pivert East, and two totalling 102 m on Pivert South. 

The original objective of the program was to confirm the continuity of the mineralized pegmatites observed at 
surface.  Drillholes were supervised, logged, and sampled by Consul-Teck.  The program produced 157 samples.

 CONDEMNATION DRILLING 
Twenty-four holes totalling 1,799 m were drilled on the Property to confirm the absence of mineral resource 
potential in areas of proposed infrastructure.  Table 10.5 lists the holes.  InnovExplo was not provided with 
assay results from these holes, but was informed by Critical Element representatives that no mineralization was 
encountered.  Drillholes were supervised, logged, and sampled by Consul-Teck.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES, AND 
SECURITY 

 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
— The drillcore is boxed, covered and sealed at the drill rig and moved to the side of the main gravel road by 

the drillers, where they are piled either on the ground or on a trailer.  Consul-Teck personnel then carry 
the boxes once or twice a week to the core logging and sample preparation facility in Val-d'Or. 

— After being examined and described (logged), the core is sampled according to an established protocol.  The 
core of the selected section is first cut in half using a typical table-feed circular rock saw, with one half put 
aside for shipment to the laboratory.  The second half of the core is put back in its place in the core box, 
and a tag bearing the same number is placed at the end of the sawed core halves forming the sampled 
length.  Core sample intervals are selected based on the presence of favourable geological units (pegmatite) 
and placed into sample bags before being shipped to the assay laboratory. 

— Channel samples collected from the Property by Critical Elements are referred to in company press releases 
as 'non-chosen grab samples' because the collection process differs from traditional channel sampling.  
Unlike traditional channel samples, they are not necessarily perpendicular to the interpreted strike of the 
pegmatite and they are of variable lengths.  This type of channel sampling was employed in lieu of grab 
sampling since traditional grabs are very difficult or impossible to obtain from the smooth, hard outcrops 
surfaces using a hammer and chisel.  The resulting samples, however, are similar to grab samples in that 
they are selective by nature and unlikely to represent average grades.  The purpose of such sampling was to 
rapidly determine whether mineralization is constant throughout the outcropping pegmatite.  Author 
Pierre-Luc Richard examined some of the channel sampling sites during a visit to the Property.  The 
channels were approximately 5 cm wide and cut with a motorized circular saw to a depth of approximately 
5 cm.  Most were approximately 1 m long and entirely within the pegmatite dyke.  As mentioned above, 
they were not necessarily perpendicular to the interpreted strike of the pegmatite.  According to the issuer, 
samples were placed whole into bags before sending to the laboratory.  

— Most core samples range in length from 0.10 to 2.00 m, with only a few exceptions exceeding 2.00 m.  This is 
discussed further in Section 12 - Data Verification. 

— Every pegmatite unit was systematically sampled.  Samples collected by diamond drilling are generally 
intact with little possibility of loss due to wash out and are considered to be of good quality.  Overall, the 
author Pierre-Luc Richard considers the drillcore sample recovery from mineralized zones to be 
representative. 

— Consul-Teck's core logging facility in Val-d'Or was used for the drilling program.  Consul-Teck defined the 
sample preparation, analysis, and security protocols for the Critical Elements drilling programs.  Assays 
were mostly performed at the independent and accredited facilities of ALS Laboratory in Val-d'Or (ALS), 
but nine of the first grab samples (430901 to 430909) were sent to Techni-Labs S.G.B Abitibi Inc. in 
Ste-Germaine-Boulé (Tech-Labs). 

— After having been logged and sampled at Consul-Teck's Val-d'Or facility, the samples are delivered to the 
laboratory by Consul-Teck personnel.

— Upon arrival at ALS, the samples are dried then crushed (jaw crushers) to 70% passing 10 mesh (i.e.  2 mm). 
Samples are then riffle-split (Jones riffle splitters) to reduce the sample size for pulverization to a 
maximum of 1 kg.  The 1-kg samples are then pulverized (ring and puck) to 85% passing 200 mesh 
(i.e. 75 μm).  Analytical protocols require that all samples be analyzed for 48 elements by the Ultra-Trace 
Level method using ICP MS and ICP-AES (ALS internal code ME-MS61).  

— The ALS protocol for this type of analysis stipulates that a prepared sample (0.25 g) is digested by 
perchloric, nitric, hydrofluoric, and hydrochloric acids.  The residue is topped up with dilute hydrochloric 
acid and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma–atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).  Following this 
analysis, the results are reviewed for high concentrations of bismuth, mercury, molybdenum, silver, or 
tungsten and diluted accordingly.  Samples with high concentrations are then analyzed by inductively 
coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  Results are corrected for spectral inter-element 
interferences.  ALS notes that although the four-acid digestion is able to dissolve most minerals, it is 
described as 'near-total digestion' because not all elements may be quantitatively extracted, depending on 
the sample matrix. 

— In cases where Li is higher than the detection limit of the ME-MS61 method, selected samples are then 
analyzed using the ALS Ore Grade Lithium method by four-acid digestion with ICP-AES finish (ALS internal 
code Li-OG63).  Approximately 0.4 g is first digested with HClO4, HF, and HNO3 until dryness.  The residue is 
subsequently re-digested in concentrated HCl, cooled and topped up to volume.  The samples are analyzed 
for Li by ICP-AES spectroscopy. 

— In cases where Ta and/or Cs are higher than the detection limit of the ME-MS61 method, selected samples 
are then analyzed using the ALS Pressed Pellet Geochemical Procedure method (ALS internal code ME-
XRF05).  A finely ground sample powder (10-g minimum) is mixed with a few drops of liquid binder 
(Polyvinyl Alcohol) and then transferred into an aluminum cap.  The sample is subsequently compressed in 
a pellet press at approximately 30 tons/in2.  After pressing, the pellet is dried to remove the solvent and 
analyzed by WDXRF spectrometry for the desired elements. 

— In addition to the regular sampling and assaying of samples, Consul-Teck externally initiates additional 
quality control protocols by preparing various duplicate samples to evaluate the precision 
(i.e. reproducibility) and accuracy (i.e.  correctness) of the values reported.  According to the company 
database, a total of 192 samples from the Property were duplicated.  In addition, 198 blank samples were 
inserted in the batches sent to the laboratory to verify that contamination did not occur during the 
preparation process.  ALS also conducts internal quality control protocols. 

— The laboratory delivered the results in electronic format, sent by e-mail only to Jean-Sébastien Lavallée.  
Assay results were then transferred directly to the Critical Elements database. 

There is no indication of anything in the drilling, core handling and sampling procedures or in the sampling 
methods and approach that could have had a negative impact on the reliability of the reported assay results. 

 ANALYTICAL METHODS 

The QP obtained assay certificates from ALS to create an independent database.  The QP used the independently 
compiled database to recalculate the results according to the following rules:  
— For Li, two methods were present in the database:  ME MS61 and ME OG63.  ME OG63 is only available when 

ME MS61 shows >10,000 ppm and is a method capable of returning results for higher grades.  Therefore, 
values from ME OG63 were used when available. 

— For Be, two methods were present in the database:  ME MS61 and ME ICP61a.  ME ICP61a is only available 
when ME MS61 shows >500 ppm and is a method capable of returning results for higher grades.  Therefore, 
values from ME ICP61a were used when available.

— For Rb, two methods were present in the database:  ME MS61 and ME MS81.  When both methods were 
available, an average of the two methods was applied.  In cases where the result was >10,000 ppm Rb, a 
value of 10,000 was applied before proceeding with the average. 

— For Ta, three methods were present in the database:  ME MS61, ME MS81, and ME XRF05.  When more than 
one method was available, an average was applied.  In cases where Ta values were >100 ppm using method 
ME MS61, the average of ME MS81 and ME XRF05 was used.  In each instance where this occurred, the results 
from either ME MS81 or ME XRF05 (or both) were available.  In cases where Ta values were >10,000 ppm using 
method ME XRF05, the value of 10,000 was used. 

— For Cs, three methods were present in the database:  ME MS61, ME MS81 and ME XRF05.  When more than 
one method was available, an average was applied.  In cases where Cs values were >500 ppm using method 
ME MS61, the average of ME MS81 and ME XRF05 was used.  In each instance where this occurred, results 
from either ME MS81 or ME XRF05 (or both) were available. 

— For Ga, two methods were present in the database:  ME MS61 and ME MS81.  When both methods were 
available, an average of the two methods was applied. 

— Grades for Li, Ta, Rb, Cs, and Be are reported in this section as parts per million (ppm). 

 CRITICAL ELEMENTS QUALITY CONTROL 
The quality control database for drillcore assays contains 198 blank and 192 core duplicate samples that were 
sent to ALS as part of the program.  Core duplicates are quarter-splits using what is left in the box after taking 
the original half-split sample.  Certified standards were not included in the sample protocol. 

According to the database, not every hole had blanks and/or core duplicates, but the majority did. 

Field duplicates returned values similar to the original assays (Figure 11.1), the only exception being Be and Ta 
which show less (although reasonable) coherence.  Only four blanks (Samples 738810, 747847, 883610, and 
883661) returned abnormally high results.  After reviewing the weights received at the laboratory, the authors 
came to the conclusion that there must have been a mistake in the tag identification of Sample 747847 rather 
than a laboratory issue.  However, the three batches containing Samples 738810, 883610, and 883661 should be 
quarter-split and re-assayed with new blanks and duplicates.  With the exception of those three suspicious 
batches, there were no signs of significant contamination.

Figure 11.1 Verification of Core Duplicates 

 

Approximately 10% of the Rose deposit samples sent to ALS were sent to a third laboratory in November 2010 
to confirm the values.  Critical Elements chose Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd (Acme) as the third laboratory, 
and the results were obtained on November 26, 2010, via electronic transmission.  

Acme's values for pulp re-assays are similar to the original assays (Figure 11.2).  Initially it may appear that this 
is not true for the Ta results, which show an R-squared value of 0.58, but the value becomes 0.9618 if the single 
outlier (lower-right corner of the chart) is omitted from the database.  The authors therefore conclude that the 
two sets of assays correlate well.

 HISTORICAL WORK 
The historical information used in this report was taken mainly from reports issued by the Québec 
government's geological survey (the MRNQ, now the MERN) as part of its vast regional programs.  Little 
information is available about sample preparation or analytical and security procedures in these documents, 
but InnovExplo assumes that the government's exploration activities were in accordance with prevailing 
industry standards at the time.  

Only one historical drillhole is reported for the current Property.  There was therefore no historical database 
for the author to validate. 

 CRITICAL ELEMENTS DATABASE 
The Critical Elements ACCESS database comprises 217 NQ-size diamond drillholes totalling 26,176.5 metres.  A 
total of 4,631 core samples (4,406 from the Rose deposit and 225 from the Pivert, Pivert-East, Pivert-South and 
Helico showings) are included, as are 390 QA/QC samples (blanks and duplicates).  

The author was granted access to the official results from ALS Laboratory (ALS) for all holes and grab samples 
discussed in this report (holes LR-09-01 to LR-11-181; JR-10-01 to JR-11-18; HD-10-01 to HD-10-03; LP-09-01 to 
LP-10-06; HE-10-01 to HE-10-05; PE-10-01 to PE-10-02; PS-10-01 to PS-10-02).  The author downloaded every 
certificate directly from the laboratory and built the tables presented in this report using the information 
contained therein.  Very few errors were noted in the database, and these were considered minor and of the 
type normally encountered in a project database.  None of the observed errors would affect the integrity of the 
database, and it is considered to be of very good overall quality. 

InnovExplo considers the Critical Elements database for the Project to be valid and reliable.

 CRITICAL ELEMENTS DIAMOND DRILLING 
Every collar on the Rose deposit was professionally surveyed.  Most of the other collars were surveyed using a 
handheld GPS.  The surveys conducted on the Rose deposit are considered adequate for the purpose of a 
resource estimate.  The great majority of the holes were surveyed by a Flexit instrument (single shots 
approximately every 60 m). 

Drilling was underway (Hole LR-10-86) when author Mr. Richard first visited the site on July 13, 2010 
(Figure 12.1).  He visited the drill rig during the site visit and witnessed approximately nine metres of core 
being pulled from underground.  He also observed spodumene in the core section. There was no active drill rig 
on site during the second visit in July 2011.  The QP was able to confirm the location of many casings using a 
handheld GPS during both visits (Figures 12.2 and 12.3).

 CRITICAL ELEMENTS OUTCROP SAMPLING 
As discussed in Section 11, Critical Elements refers to channel samples from the Property as 'non-chosen grab 
samples' in company press releases because the collection process differs from traditional channel sampling.  
Unlike traditional channel samples, they are not necessarily perpendicular to the interpreted strike of the 
pegmatite and they are of variable lengths.  

This type of channel sampling was employed in lieu of grab sampling because traditional grab samples are very 
difficult or impossible to obtain from smooth, hard outcrops surfaces using a hammer and chisel.  However, the 
channel samples are similar to grab samples in that they are selective by nature and unlikely to represent 
average grades.  The purpose of such sampling is to rapidly determine whether mineralization is constant 
throughout the outcropping pegmatite.  

For this reason, channel samples collected on the Project to date should be considered as grab samples and not 
be used in any future resource estimates, even with proper surveying.

 CRITICAL ELEMENTS SAMPLING AND ASSAYING PROCEDURES 
InnovExplo reviewed several mineralized core sections while visiting the core storage facility in Val-d'Or 
(Figures 12.4 and 12.5).  All core boxes were labelled and properly stored outside.  Sample tags, located at the 
end of each sample, were still present in the boxes.  Marks on the bottom of the box were also found, indicating 
sample intervals.  It was possible to validate sample numbers and confirm the presence of spodumene for each 
of the samples in the mineralized zones.

Mr. Richard reviewed and judged adequate the entire path taken by the drillcore, from the drill rig to the 
logging and sampling facility (Figure 12.6).  Core sample lengths were also reviewed.  After Critical Elements 
made corrections, only 6 of the 4,633 reviewed samples from the Rose deposit were found to be more than 2 m 
long (3.75 m being the maximum), and 728 were less than 0.50 m.  The smallest sample was 0.10 m long.

The grade versus sample length graph shows a very homogeneous distribution for all elements considered (Li, 
Ta, Rb, Cs, Be, Ga), without any detectable bias due to small interval sampling (Figure 12.7).  A comparison of 
grade versus sample length seemed appropriate considering more than 15% (728) of the 4,633 samples in the 
database are less than 0.50 m long.  This kind of sampling procedure can sometimes conceal high-grade values 
derived from small samples by spreading them over longer composite intervals when a suitable capping grade 
has not been applied.

 INNOVEXPLO'S GRAB SAMPLING 
During the first site visit, InnovExplo collected 12 grab samples for the purpose of conducting an independent 
analysis.  Samples were collected, bagged and delivered to ALS by one of the authors. Table 12.2 presents the 
results for those samples. 

The goal of this verification was to confirm the presence of the reported Li, Be, Ta, Cs, Rb, and Ga 
mineralization.  Mineralization-level values were successfully obtained for all of the visited showings, except 
Hydro:  samples from this showing failed to yield significant results for Li, with only Ta returning significant 
levels (>100 ppm).  However, the author is of the opinion that all showings presented in this report truly 
contain Li and rare-element mineralization, and grab samples are unlikely to represent average grades.

13 MINERAL PROCESSSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 

 METALLURGICAL TEST WORK SUMMARY 
SGS Canada Inc., Lakefield developed a conceptual flowsheet based on a series of bench scale tests on various 
samples from the Rose deposit.  Bench scale metallurgical test work was performed on outcrop and drillcore 
samples having lithium grades from 1.0% Li2O (bench scale test work) to 1.45% Li2O (pilot scale test work). 
Variability drillcore composites tested had head grades; 0.99% Li2O to 2.15% Li2O except for one composite 
(PEG2) with 0.80% Li2O that did not produce acceptable grade-recovery due to the presence of higher levels of 
amphiboles and pyroxenes in the ore.  

Metallurgical test work on nine representative drillcore composites having a lithium head grade varying 
between 0.50% Li2O and 1.70% Li2O was conducted at SGS laboratory to investigate its effect on grade/recovery. 
Results show that a head grade of 0.85% Li2O could produce a chemical grade lithium concentrate of 5.0% Li2O 
with a recovery over 90% or a technical grade lithium concentrate of 6.0% with a recovery over 87%.  

The proposed flowsheet is comprised of conventional three-stage crushing and single stage grinding followed 
by magnetic separation for the recovery of tantalum, mica flotation and spodumene flotation. The flowsheet is 
capable of producing a spodumene concentrate with a minimum of 6.0% Li2O and lithium recovery around 85% 
from a spodumene ore with 1.15% Li2O. Settling and filtration tests were also performed for sizing dewatering 
equipment.  

Historical metallurgical test work is presented in Section 13.2.  The bench scale at ACME metallurgical testing is 
presented in 13.2.1. The SGS bench scale test work is presented in Section 13.3.  The final spodumene 
concentrate production tests are presented in Section 13.4.  Solid-liquid separation test work is presented in 
Section 13.5.  Flotation pilot plant test work is presented in Section 13.6.  Section 13.7 shows the ongoing 
tantalum concentrate upgrading test work, and Section 13.8 presents the test work on the nine variability 
samples.  

 HISTORICAL TEST WORK SUMMARY 

13.2.1 BENCH SCALE TEST WORK – ACME METALLURGICAL LIMITED 

A preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) study was completed in 2011.  Bench scale metallurgical testing was 
performed at ACME Metallurgical Limited in Vancouver in 2011.  Details are reported in 'Technical Report and 
Preliminary Economic Assessment on the Rose Tantalum-Lithium Project', Project 111-52558-00 December 10, 2011.   
The results from these tests were used for the PEA study.  Three composites, the Rose (main structure), the 
Rose Sud-Est (Southeast structure) and Tantale (secondary structure with higher tantalum and lower lithium 
content) were subjected to various metallurgical tests.  

The head assays of the samples are presented in Table 13.1 and indicate that the Rose composite is rich in 
lithium and low in tantalum whereas the Tantale composite is rich in tantalum and low in lithium with a 
lithium content of 0.3% Li2O.

Most of the test work was performed on the Rose Composite as it was likely the most representative of the 
known resource at the time.  Grindability tests, rod mill and ball mill work index tests and abrasion tests were 
performed on the composites.  Bond rod mill index, 9.82 kWh/t, ball mill work index, 13.3 kWh/t, and an 
abrasion index, 0.429 Ai were determined.  

Heavy-liquid separation tests performed at 2.7, 2.9, and 3.2 g/cm3 specific gravities concluded that the 
mineralization was not amenable to dense media separation at a coarser grind size of 500 μm. 

Mineralogical examination of the flotation products indicated that tantalum was present as mangano-tantalite 
in liberated grains of 50 to 150 μm and as small inclusions within spodumene minerals.  The spodumene, 
feldspars, quartz, and mica minerals were liberated at a grind size of 150 μm. 

Twenty eight (28) bench scale flotation tests were performed on 4 kg samples at different grinds.  Test F-28 
performed at the optimum grind size of 80% passing 150 μm produced a spodumene concentrate containing 
5.86% Li2O and 90.7% lithium recovery.  The final flotation spodumene concentrate assayed 0.08% Ta grade with 
85% Ta recovery. 

Thirteen high-gradient wet magnetic separation tests were performed on the spodumene flotation concentrate to 
recover magnetic tantalum minerals.  Tests performed up to 14,000 Gauss showed that about 60% of the tantalum 
contained in the spodumene concentrate was recovered in a concentrate assaying 1.14% Ta. 

 BENCH SCALE TEST WORK – SGS CANADA INC. LAKEFIELD 
Bench scale metallurgical test work performed at SGS Lakefield (SGS) in 2015 were aimed at optimizing a 
flowsheet for producing spodumene concentrate with a minimum of 6.0% Li2O grade at about 90% lithium 
recovery.  Improving tantalum recovery from 50% from previous study at ACME Metallurgical Limited to a 
higher level was also a focus.  The detailed results of the metallurgical test work were reported by SGS Canada 
Inc. 'Phase 1 Beneficiation bench scale testing on the Rose Lithium/Tantalum Project', Project 14120-001 Final report, 
April 20, 2015. 

13.3.1 SAMPLE DESCRIPTION 

Rose outcrop and South Rose outcrop rock samples were first received at SGS Canada in June 2013.  Five 
variability drillcore composites received later in September 2013 were identified as 1st shipment variability 
samples.  Five additional variability drillcore samples received subsequently in December 2013 were identified 
as 2nd shipment variability samples.  

Rose outcrop rock sample was referred to as Rose sample by SGS during metallurgical test work.  Mineralogical 
characterization, grindability, heavy-liquid testing, gravity separation, magnetic separation, and flotation tests 
were performed on the Rose sample.  

Rose sample was used for the development of flowsheet.

The lithium content of the samples ranged from a low of 0.80% Li2O for the PEG2 sample to a high of 2.15% Li2O 
for the South Rose sample.  Tantalum was reported high at 0.0349 % Ta in the Rose sample; tantalum content in 
the other samples ranged from 0.0072 %Ta to 0.0292 % Ta.  Deleterious elements, Fe2O3, CaO, and MgO are low in 
all samples except for PEG2 sample with high contents of 1.79% Fe2O3, 1.36% CaO, and 0.78% MgO which affect 
negatively on spodumene flotation and produce a concentrate that may not meet spodumene concentrate 
product specifications for certain applications.  PEG2 sample is mostly composed of material from Zone 119 
while all the others are mostly from Zone 115 as shown in Table 13.3.  Zone 119 is not in the feasibility mine 
plan.  Zone 115 represents more than 50% of the feasibility mine plan. 

The variability tests were aimed at investigating differences in metallurgical results on ore from various areas 
of the operation.  The sample composites were gathered from diamond drillcore at different locations and 
depth of the pit.  The composites RSE2, ROSE 2, ROSE 3, and ROSE 4 were made of material mostly from 
Zone 115 with the exception of composite PEG2 which is mostly composed of material from Zone 119.

13.3.2 MINERALOGICAL EVALUATION 

Mineralogical studies were performed on the Rose composite sample with QEMSCAN, electron microprobe, X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy.  The Rose sample was crushed to 100% passing 600 μm, screened into 
four size fractions; +425 μm, -425/+300 μm, -300/+106 μm, and -106 μm to characterize the minerals present and 
their liberation characteristics.  The mineralogical report can be found in 'An Investigation by High Definition 
Mineralogy into the Mineralogical Characteristics of One Beneficiation Head Sample from the Rose Lithium/Tantalum Project', 
SGS Canada Inc. Project 14120-001 Final report, April 20, 2015. 

Plagioclase, 43.3% was found to be the dominant mineral in the Rose sample with moderate quartz 25.5%, 
spodumene 14.5%, K-feldspar 13.8%, minor mica 2.7%, and trace amounts, less than 1% of tantalite and other 
minerals.  Electron microprobe analysis showed that tantalite [(Fe,Mn),(Nb,Ta)2O6] occurs as the main phase 
and liandratite [U6+ (Nb,Ta)2O8] and tantite (Ta2O5) in minor amounts. 

13.3.3 GRINDABILITY TESTS 

Bond grindability test was performed on the Rose sample only and it was categorized as moderately soft with a 
ball mill work index of 12.9 kWh/t and a rod mill work index of 8.0 kWh/t.   

13.3.4 HEAVY LIQUID SEPARATION TESTS 

Heavy-liquid separation (HLS) tests were performed on the -1/4"/+0.5 mm fraction of Rose sample for 
evaluating the potential for gravity separation.  Methylene iodide was mixed with acetone to achieve target 
specific gravity (SG) for the HLS tests.

Simplified HLS test flowsheet is shown on Figure 13.1.  The -1/4"/+0.5 mm fraction was separated at 3.0 g/cm3 
and the float fraction was separated further at a media specific gravity (SG) 2.95 g/cm3.  The SG 2.95 g/cm3 float 
was separated at SG 2.80 g/cm3.  The sink 3.0 sinks, 2.95 sinks, and the SG 2.80 floats were collected as products.  
The 2.8 SG test sink product was stage crushed to 3.36 mm (6 Mesh) and the - 0.5 mm fraction was screened out.  
The -3.36+0.5 mm fraction was sequentially separated at SG 3.0 g/cm3 and 2.95 g/cm3.  The initial 3.0 SG sinks 
fraction graded 6.74% Li2O and the second 3.0 SG sink fraction achieved a higher Li2O grade of 6.89%.

Based on these results, Dense Medium Separation (DMS) might have good potential to produce spodumene 
concentrate with 6.0%Li2O in the early stage of the process prior to grinding followed by flotation.  However, in 
such a DMS operation, the density of the media should not be lower than 2.90 g/cm3 to produce concentrate 
grading higher than 6.0% Li2O.  The results also confirmed that DMS operation will be sensitive to media 
density, and deviation from the target media density may result in a spodumene concentrate with less than 
6.0% Li2O grade. 

Low tantalum recovery of 16.7% Ta in the HLS concentrate was attributed to poor liberation of tantalum 
minerals at -1/4"/+0.5 mm fraction.  The HLS silicate tailings at 2.8 g/cm3 had significant spodumene loss, 
14.3% lithium at 0.24% Li2O grade with 61.5% of the mass reporting to the tailings.  The losses were due to poor 
liberation of spodumene at -1/4"/+0.5 mm fraction.  

13.3.5 GRAVITY SEPARATION TESTS 

Gravity separation tests were performed on three (3) size fractions of the Rose sample:  -48/+150 mesh 
(-300/+105 μm), -150/+400 mesh (-105/+37 μm), and -400 mesh (37 μm) fractions using a combination of Wilfley 
Table, Knelson Concentrator, and Mozley Table.  The gravity separation test flowsheet is shown on Figure 13.2. 
The objective of the test work was to improve the recovery of tantalum.  Each size fraction was first processed 
on a Wilfley Table and the concentrate further processed on a Knelson Concentrator; the Knelson concentrate 
further upgraded on a Mozley Table.  The finer size fraction, -400 mesh (-37 μm) was processed on the Knelson 
Concentrator; as it was too fine for processing on the Wilfley Table and the Knelson concentrate, further 
processed on the Mozley Table.  The Mozley concentrate from the -400 mesh product stream was further 
processed on a low intensity magnetic separator.  The combined gravity concentrate recovered about 57% 
tantalum with 5.6% Ta grade in 0.29% weight for the combined -48 mesh (-300 μm) fraction.  Results are shown 
in Table 13.5.

However, low lithium upgrade ratios suggest that gravity flowsheet selected was not suitable for the recovery 
of spodumene.  

The performance of gravity separation was greatly affected by the grain size.  The flowsheet involving these 
gravity separators was complex and operating such a circuit at plant scale may not be practical.  

Magnetic separation tests were performed on the -48 mesh (300 μm) Rose sample, with the aim of recovering 
tantalum bearing minerals without the desliming step.  A simplified flowsheet is shown on Figure 13.3.  
Wet High-Intensity Magnetic Separation (WHIMS) tests were conducted at 5 Amps (5,000 Gauss), 
15 Amps (14,000 Gauss), and at 30 Amps (20,000 Gauss).  Some tests were also performed on the lithium flotation 
concentrates to recover tantalum.

Table 13.6 shows the results of WHIMS tests.  The test (Test F1), performed on spodumene concentrate 
produced a low recovery tantalum at 6.3%.  Magnetic separation test (Test F11) performed on the -48 mesh 
(300 μm) feed sample produced a magnetic concentrate having a grade of 1.04% Ta with a highest recovery of 
84% Ta at a mass pull of about 1.7%.  The tests suggest that performing wet high-intensity magnetic separation 
(WHIMS) at high current intensities of 30 Amps (20,000 Gauss) on the -48 mesh feed obtained the best results 
for tantalum recovery.  It was observed that magnetic separation greatly affected by magnetic intensities 
applied and number of passes.  High magnetic fields up to 20,000 Gauss and multiple passes are required to 
achieve high-grade tantalum and better recovery.

13.3.6 BENCH SCALE FLOTATION TESTS 

Fifteen (15) flotation tests were performed on Rose sample stage-ground to 100% passing 48 mesh (300 μm).  
The P80 of the ground material was similar for different grind schemes with a P80 of about 220-230 μm for the 
flotation feed.  Desliming and scrubbing processes were identified and demonstrated by all tests as necessary to 
achieve high-grade spodumene concentrate with high recoveries.  The loss of lithium in the slimes is a function 
of slimes mass.  Test results showed that better spodumene flotation performance was obtained after 
separating about 3% slimes with about 2% lithium losses.

Separation of mica prior to spodumene flotation was found necessary since the head sample had considerable 
amounts of mica impacting spodumene flotation performance.  Mica reporting to spodumene concentrate could 
be better controlled by separating mica prior to spodumene flotation.  Sulphuric acid was used to lower the pulp 
pH to 3.0 before conditioning with collector amine (Armac T) for achieving better performance in mica flotation.  

Laser ablation technique (LA-ICP-MS) was suggested to determine the loss of spodumene to the mica 
concentrate to find out if lithium is present as solid solution in the mica crystal structure.  

Borresperse CA, a calcium lignosulfonate reagent, was used for improving the dispersion of fine particles and 
improving desliming performance.  Sodium hydroxide was used in scrubbing to improve slimes suspension and 
facilitate the separation of spodumene grains from iron contaminants.  Soda ash was the preferred pH 
regulator in spodumene flotation.  The performance of spodumene rougher flotation was found dependent on 
fatty acid-2 dosage and flotation time. 

The upgrading of beryllium, gallium, and rubidium in the flotation products were evaluated in Tests F11, F12, 
and F13.  The beryllium- and gallium-bearing minerals were upgraded to some extent in the spodumene 
concentrates.  Over 40% of the beryllium and gallium minerals were distributed in the lithium rougher 
scavenger tailings (Test F13).  Rubidium achieved fairly good upgrading in the mica concentrate and was likely 
to be associated with mica.  Detailed results can be found in the 'Phase 1 Beneficiation bench scale testing on the Rose 
Lithium/Tantalum Project', Project 14120-001 SGS Canada Inc., Final report, April 20, 2015. 

Flotation Tests F11, F12, and F13 performed by duplicating F10 test conditions, obtained fairly consistent results in 
spodumene rougher and scavenger stage.  Test F13 achieved the best performance and produced a spodumene 
concentrate containing 6.43% Li2O with 91.9% lithium recovery in 14.3% weight recovery (mass pull).  Flotation 
tests results are presented in Table 13.7. 

Flotation test (F9) conducted on the -0.5 mm fraction from the HLS test produced a rougher concentrate with 
3.53% Li2O with 78.6% lithium recovery in 15.3% weight recovery.  Cleaner flotation further failed to produce 
+6.0% Li2O grade.  Poor flotation performance was due to the different mineralogical composition of the 
flotation feed (HLS test, -0.5 mm fraction).

13.3.7 LOCKED CYCLE TESTS 

Two locked cycle tests (LCT) were performed on the Rose sample using the flowsheet developed.  Figure 13.4 
shows the flowsheet for LCT-2.  The difference between the two LCT flowsheets is that LCT-2 flowsheet included 
two stages of mica cleaner flotation, whereas LCT-1 had only one stage of mica rougher flotation.  LCT-2 flowsheet 
was used to produce spodumene concentrate for hydrometallurgical test work.  LCT-1 tests were performed in 
6 cycles whereas LCT-2 tests in 8 cycles.  The results of LCT-1 presented are the average projected balance for the 
2 cycles D to E.  For LCT-2, the average projected balance is for three cycles from Cycle E to G.

The LCT tests did not achieve higher recoveries than the batch tests due to the effect of recirculating streams 
that contain less than 3% lithium.  LCT-1 achieved higher recovery, 89.1%, compared to LCT-2 that achieved 
83.6% recovery.  Low recovery in LCT-2 is mainly due to significant loss of lithium in scavenger tailings and the 
loss of lithium in scrubber slimes in LCT-1.  Results from the LCT tests are shown in Table 13.8.

13.3.8 VARIABILITY TESTS 

A total of eight variability beneficiation tests were performed using the developed flowsheet on the samples.  
PEG2, Rose 2 samples from 1st shipment were tested and tests on other samples were not performed as it was 
reported that 1st shipment samples were not the correct samples.  All variability samples from 2nd shipment 
were tested; PEG2, RSE2, Rose 2, Rose 3, Rose 4 and South Rose samples.  Test F13 conditions, which achieved 
best results on the Rose sample, were used for the variability tests.  

QEMSCAN Mineralogy was not performed on the variability samples.  The lithium grade of South Rose sample 
was relatively high at 2.15% Li2O and varied from 0.80% to 1.49% Li2O for other variability samples.  The 
impurities such as MgO, CaO and Fe2O3 were similar compared to the Rose sample, except for PEG2 from 2nd 
shipment that contained relatively high impurities; 1.79% Fe2O3, 0.78% MgO, and 1.36% CaO. 

Figure 13.6 shows the grade-recovery for the variability samples and the Rose sample.  The spodumene 
flotation results varied greatly for the variability samples using the developed flowsheet on Rose sample.  Test 
F18 performed on South Rose sample produced superior results; 6.89% Li2O with 90.9% lithium recovery 
compared to Test 13 on the Rose sample.  Test F22 on PEG2 produced a low-grade concentrate, 4.15% Li2O with 
55.1% lithium recovery.  Low metallurgical performance of was attributed to the presence of amphiboles and 
pyroxenes in the ore, which tend to float with spodumene and impair spodumene selective flotation. 

Flotation tests on the variability samples indicate that a spodumene concentrate having +6.0% Li2O with 73-90% 
lithium recoveries could be achieved.  In general, the higher lithium head grade samples had better lithium 
recovery in an overall trend.  

Tantalum performance was not evaluated on the variability samples as tantalum was assayed only on selected 
products.  The tantalum grade of the magnetics ranged from 0.71% Ta on the PEG2 to 1.08% Ta on the Rose 3 
sample and was likely dependent on the tantalum head grade.   

It was noted that the developed beneficiation flowsheet cannot be effective if the flotation feed contains a 
significant amounts of amphiboles and pyroxenes, as observed in Test F22 performed on PEG2 sample.  

Statistical analysis was performed on the results of grade and recovery.  Variability of the results was evaluated 
using coefficient of variation (CV) on:  1. on same composite, and 2. between composites.  

1 Rose Sample:  Statistical analysis of the grade and recovery for twelve Rose samples indicate that a CV of 8% 
for Li2O concentrate grade and 15% for lithium recovery.  Low coefficient of variation suggests that the 
results are consistent within acceptable variability. 

2 Between Composites:  Statistical analysis of the grade and recovery for Rose composite and seven 
variability composites indicate that a very low CV of 1% for Li2O concentrate grade and an acceptable CV of 
58% for lithium recovery.  The coefficient of variation for grade and recovery suggests that the results are 
consistent within acceptable variability.

 SPODUMENE CONCENTRATE PRODUCTION TESTS – SGS CANADA 
INC. LAKEFIELD 

Bench scale spodumene concentrate production and phase transformation tests were performed at SGS in 2016.  
The test work produced around 5  kg spodumene concentrate from 40 kg Rose sample, left over from previous 
test program, following the previously developed beneficiation flowsheet.  

The flowsheet is presented on Figure 13.7.  All spodumene concentrate produced was further used for 
spodumene phase transformation test work. 

The head assay for the Rose sample is presented in Table 13.9.

The Rose sample was stage crushed and ground to -300 μm (48 mesh), with a P80 203 μm. 

Four beneficiation tests were performed using the flowsheet and reagent scheme developed for the Rose 
sample in the previous test program described in Section 13.3.  Minor adjustments to reagent scheme were 
made for improving the spodumene concentrate grade. 

The tantalum recovery circuit shown on Figure 13.7 is oversimplified and indicates a single-stage magnetic 
separation.  

Wet high-intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS) tests were conducted at a current intensity of 5 Amps 
(~5,000 Gauss) and the non-magnetics passed on WHIMS at either 15 Amps (~15,000 Gauss) or 30 Amps 
(~26,000 Gauss) in a rougher-scavenger arrangement.  The first two tests (F1-F2) and (F3-F4) were performed at 
5A and 15A current intensities.  Tests F5-F6 and F7-F8 were performed at 5A and 30A current intensities. 

The results of WHIMS tests are shown in Table 13.10.

The WHIMS test results show that a tantalum concentrate (rougher-scavengers concentrate) grading 
1.62% - 2.19% Ta with 63% - 68% Ta recoveries in 0.9-1.2% weight was produced by multiple-stage magnetic 
separation.  Test F5-F6 produced highest Ta recovery of 68.3% Ta with a tantalum grade of 1.93% Ta.  About 33% 
to 45% Fe2O3 in the feed reports to the tantalum concentrate.  Lithium losses to the tantalum concentrate were 
low, from1.0% to 1.4%. 

Mica flotation was performed at an alkaline pH, 9.5 using Aero 3030C as collector, eliminating the need for mica 
flotation in an acidic environment. The addition of dispersant F220 in the roughers and cleaners of Test F3-F4 
improved lithium recoveries compared to the base case test (Test F1-F2). 

The four production bench scale tests produced 4.9 kg spodumene concentrate containing an average concentrate 
grade 6.83% Li2O, 63.7% SiO2, 26.8% Al2O3, and 0.51% Fe2O3.  The overall combined recovery from the open circuit 
tests was 84.6%.  The assays for the combined spodumene concentrate are presented in Table 13.11.  The detailed 
results for the four production tests are shown in Table 13.12.  Spodumene production test report can be found in

 SOLID-LIQUID SEPARATION TEST WORK – SGS CANADA INC. 
LAKEFIELD 

Solid-liquid separation tests were performed on the spodumene concentrate and combined mica, spodumene 
flotation tailings in 2016.  Details of these tests can be found in 'Solid-liquid separation responses of process samples 
from the Rose Deposit', SGS Project No. CALR-14120-003, Final report April 05, 2017.  Since all of the concentrate 
produced was used for the phase transformation tests, spodumene concentrate available from previous test work 
was used for determining the design criteria for sizing thickener and filtration equipment. 

Static settling tests were performed only on the spodumene concentrate due to shortage of sample; Table 13.13 
shows the results.  Static settling tests on the spodumene concentrate indicated that the concentrate settled 
well in the presence of 7 g/t BASF Magnafloc 10 flocculant, producing 73% w/w solids underflow from a 15% 
w/w solids thickener feed.  Resulting supernatant appeared clear after 30 minutes of elapsed settling time.  The 
total suspended solids (TSS) were 33 mg/L.

Relevant thickener sizing data included was 0.026 m2/(t/d) thickener underflow unit area (TUFUA), 
0.006 m2/(m3/d) thickener hydraulic unit area (THUA) and 905 m3/m2/d rise rate.  An abridged version of standard 
vacuum filtration tests were conducted on the thickener underflow due to limited spodumene concentrates 
sample availability.  Results are shown in Table 13.14.  Tests were performed at reduced vacuum level of about 20 
inches mercury level (0.68 bar) due to rapid filtration rate.  Micronics 89415 cloth was selected for spodumene 
concentrate filtration tests.  Filter cake thickness ranged from 25 to 40 mm.  The resulting solids throughput 
ranged from 2 022 to 18 8803 kg/m2.h.  The discharge cake residual moisture content ranged from 7.9% to 19.9% 
w/w.  The filtrates were clear by visual observation and total suspended solids (TSS) ranged from 44 to 67 mg/L.  

Settling tests were performed on a spodumene-mica combined flotation tailings sample prepared by 
SGS Lakefield.  Both static and dynamic settling tests were performed on the tailings sample.  Dynamic settling 
tests on the combined spodumene mica flotation tailings sample indicated that the tailings settled well in the 
presence of 30 g/t BASF Magnafloc 10 flocculant, producing 60.3% w/w solids underflow from a 25% w/w feed 
density.  The test results are presented in Table 13.15. 

Relevant thickener sizing data included was 0.05 m2/(t/d) thickener underflow unit area (TUFUA), 
0.02 m2/(m3/d) thickener underflow unit area (THUA).  This corresponded to 54 m3/m2/d net rise rate, 
0.833 t/m2/h solids loading, and 2.25 m3/m2/h net hydraulic loading.  The total suspended solids (TSS) 
contained in the overflow was 56 mg/L.  Vacuum filtration test results for the combined tailings are presented 
in Table 13.16.  Vacuum filtration tests were conducted on the tailings underflow from the thickener tests at 
about 24 inches mercury vacuum level (0.85 bar).  Testori P6124Q cloth was selected for tailings filtration tests.  
For the tests at 60% feed solids, the cake thickness ranged from 30 to 49 mm.  The resulting solids throughput 
ranged from 1 915 to 16 136 kg/m2.h.  The discharge cake residual moisture content ranged from 10.7% to 24.6% 
w/w.  The filtrates were hazy by visual observation and total suspended solids (TSS) ranged from 26 to 115 
mg/L.  Test performed at 40% feed solids produced a cake thickness, 47 mm at a solids throughput rate, 961 
kg/m2.h.  Discharge cake moisture was 14.5% w/w and total solids suspended in the overflow, 26 mg/L.

 PILOT PLANT FLOTATION TEST WORK – SGS CANADA INC. 
LAKEFIELD 

A pilot plant program based on the previously developed beneficiation flowsheet (Figure 13.7) was conducted 
in early 2017.  Pilot tests report can be found in 'An Investigation into Flotation Pilot Plant testing on Material from the 
Rose Lithium/Tantalum Project', SGS Canada Inc. Project 14120-005 – Final report August 18, 2017. The main 
objective of pilot plant program was to produce spodumene concentrate for further pilot scale tests for 
producing lithium carbonate.  Secondary objectives were to prove metallurgical performance on a continuous 
pilot scale and to generate metallurgical and operating data for further studies. 

13.6.1 HEAD SAMPLE CHARACTERIZATION 

The Rose sample graded 0.67% Li (1.44% Li2O) and 250 g/t Ta, while the Rose South sample graded 0.71% Li 
(1.53% Li2O) and 170 g/t Ta.  The two samples had similar size distributions, with K80 values of approximately 
7 mm at minus 9.45 mm (3/8") and 2.5 mm at minus 3.35 mm (6 mesh).  X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that 
mineral proportions of both samples were similar, with 31.5-34.3% quartz, 26.4-35.4% albite, and 16.4-19.5% 
spodumene. 

13.6.2 COMMINUTION TESTING 

The two samples were very similar in terms of grindability, with the Rose South sample generally slightly 
harder than the Rose sample.  Results are summarized in Table 13.17.

13.6.3 BENCH SCALE GRAVITY SEPARATION TESTING 

Heavy-liquid separation (HLS) testing on the feed samples at a density of 3.00 g/cm3 generated a concentrate 
grading 6.4% Li2O at a lithium recovery of 36-37%.  More than 40% of the mass was rejected as barren silicates, 
with lithium losses of 2.5-3.3%.  These results indicate that dense medium separation (DMS) would likely be a 
viable process option for generating lithium concentrate and rejecting a substantial portion of the silicate 
gangue minerals. 

Lithium in the flotation feed (which mainly consisted of HLS middlings and the undersize fraction) was 
upgraded from 0.7% Li2O to ~0.9% Li2O, with a mass pull of approximately 50%.  The majority of the tantalum 
(74%) reported to the flotation feed and can likely be recovered by magnetic separation.   

Heavy-liquid testing on the combined flotation rougher and cleaner tailings sample recovered ~45% of the 
tantalum from the flotation tailings.

A Wilfley Table test conducted on the pilot plant SLon magnetic separator feed from the PP-07 campaign 
recovered ~49% of the tantalum at a grade of 9,113 g/t Ta with a concentrate mass pull of 1%.  Approximately 
3% of the lithium was lost to the tantalum concentrate. 

13.6.4 BENCH SCALE FLOTATION TESTING 

Nine batch flotation tests were conducted on the Rose and Rose South samples to re-evaluate the previously 
developed flotation scheme and grind size with the pilot plant feed samples.  The feed for the bench scale 
flotation tests was prepared by stage grinding, followed by magnetic separation and mica pre-flotation. 

For the Rose sample, 62% of the tantalum was recovered into a magnetic concentrate with a mass pull of 1% and 
grade of ~1.5% Ta.  For the Rose South sample, tantalum recovery was lower, at ~47%, with a magnetic 
concentrate mass pull of 0.7% and grade of ~1.1% Ta. 

On average, the mica concentrate mass pull was 5.7% at a K2O grade of 6.3% and K2O recovery of 15.6%.  About 
2% of the lithium was lost into the mica concentrate. 

There was no significant difference in lithium flotation performance using either Aero 3030C or Armac T as the 
collector. 

One locked-cycle test was conducted on each of the Rose and Rose South samples.  In both cases, the final 
spodumene concentrate graded 6.65% Li2O, with higher than 89% lithium recovery and ~20% weight recovery. 

13.6.5 PILOT PLANT OPERATIONS 

Pilot plant testing commenced on February 14, 2017 and was completed on March 17, 2017, in a series of 
twenty-two shifts.  The pilot plant was constructed according to the flowsheet displayed on Figure 13.8.  The 
pilot plant was designed to process material at a target feed rate of approximately 250 kg/h. 

The first eleven operating shifts were completed on the Rose South sample.  Shifts PP-01 to PP-07 were 
considered as commissioning and optimization day shifts, followed by four shifts (PP-08 to PP-11) of round- 
the-clock continuous operation, to demonstrate metallurgical performance and generate products over an 
extended uninterrupted period. 

The final eleven operating shifts were completed on the Rose sample.  A low-intensity drum magnetic 
separator was added to the magnetic separation circuit to treat the SLon magnetics stream, and the spodumene 
3rd cleaner stage was removed, such that only two stages of cleaning of the spodumene rougher concentrate 
were required.  The focus of day shifts PP-12 and PP-13 was to transition the pilot plant to the new sample and 
achieve operating stability with some degree of optimization.  The final nine shifts (PP-14 to PP-22) were 
intended as continuous operation to demonstrate metallurgical performance and generate products over an 
extended uninterrupted period.

During the continuous operation of the Rose South sample, the overall grinding circuit unit energy 
consumption was 9.7 kWh/t, for an operating work index of 17.6 kWh/t.  During the continuous operation of 
the Rose sample, the overall grinding circuit unit energy consumption was 9.3 kWh/t, for an operating work 
index of 16.3 kWh/t.  Consistent with the observations at bench scale, the Rose South sample required slightly 
more energy than did the Rose sample. 

During the continuous operation of the Rose South sample, the magnetic concentrate represented 1.0% of the 
original feed mass, at a tantalum recovery of 47.8% and an associated lithium loss of 1.8%.  During the 
continuous operation of the Rose sample shifts that included a Knelson Concentrator, the combined Knelson 
gravity concentrate, and SLon 750 magnetic concentrate represented 3.5% of the original feed mass, at a 
tantalum recovery of 63.5% and an associated lithium loss of 6.2%. 

Spodumene flotation was conducted in a rougher stage followed by either three (Rose South) or two (Rose) 
stages of cleaning.  The feed K80 values were almost identical for the two samples during the extended runs, at 
216~218 μm on average.  Slightly different dosages of FA-2 collector were employed for the two samples, at 
772 g/t for the Rose South sample extended run and 854 g/t for the Rose sample extended run. 

13.6.6 PILOT PLANT METALLURGICAL RESULTS 

Concentrate grades varied from 4.5% Li2O to 6.4% Li2O during the start-up and commissioning runs on the Rose 
South sample, PP-01 to PP-07.  Concentrate grades were consistently above the target of 6.0% Li2O for all other 
shift surveys, from PP-08 to PP-22, indicating stable operation and metallurgical performance throughout the 
extended run of the Rose South sample and the entire campaign of the Rose sample. 

Lithium recoveries ranged from 45% to 60% during the start-up and commissioning runs on the Rose South 
sample, PP-01 to PP-07.  During the Rose South extended run, PP-08 to PP-11, lithium recoveries were 
significantly improved, ranging from 56% to 82%, and averaging 68%.  Lithium recoveries during the Rose 
sample campaign were consistently in the range from 74% to 83%, and averaged 79%. 

Metallurgical performance of the Rose sample campaign, from shifts PP-12 to PP-22, was better than that of the 
Rose South sample campaign, from shifts PP-01 to PP-11, in terms of both consistency and overall performance.  
This is undoubtedly due, at least in part, to instability of the circuit during the commissioning and optimization 
runs PP-01 to PP-07, with the continual manipulation of circuit parameters.  Once stability had been achieved 
(i.e., during the extended run, starting at PP-08), the operation and metallurgical performance of the Rose 
South sample was in line with that of the Rose sample. 

Table 13.18 summarizes the results of the best shift and the comparable bench test results (from the locked 
cycle testing) for the two samples.  Lithium recoveries were lower in the piloting campaign than that achieved 
in the locked cycle tests, which was due in part to less efficient desliming in the pilot plant, resulting in higher 
lithium losses to the slimes streams.  Further optimization in continuous operation should focus on 
improvements in that area.

 TANTALITE CONCENTRATE UPGRADING TESTS 
Tests are ongoing at SGS Lakefield laboratory with the objective of improving the tantalite concentrate grade 
obtained from the pilot plant.  Magnetic separation, heavy liquids separation, Wilfley table separation, Knelson 
concentrator, and flotation are being explored.  

Preliminary results indicate that the pilot plant tantalite concentrate may be upgraded to 20% Ta2O5 with a 
recovery over 60%. 

 LITHIUM VARIABILITY TESTS 
SGS laboratory conducted a small test program in August 2017 to investigate grade/recovery results with 
varying lithium head grades using the design process flowsheet (Figure 13.9).  Nine samples were tested having 
head grades varying between 0.50% Li2O and 1.70% Li2O; the results are shown in Table 13.19.  The grade-
recovery results show that samples with head grades higher than 1.0% Li2O produce a lithium concentrate of 
5.0% Li2O with a recovery over 90% and of 6.0% Li2O with a recovery over 86%. The sample with a 0.50% Li2O 
head grade produces a concentrate 5.0% Li2O with a recovery of 67%.  A head grade of 0.85% Li2O produces a 
5.0% Li2O concentrate with a recovery of over 85%.

14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
The 2017 Project Mineral Resource Estimate presented herein (the 2017 MRE) was prepared by Pierre-Luc 
Richard, P.Geo. using all available information.  The 2017 MRE was prepared as part of a mandate assigned by 
Critical Elements in 2016. 

The 2017 main resource area measures 1,600 m along strike, 1,300 m wide and 300 m deep.  The resource 
estimate is based on a compilation of all recent diamond drillholes and wireframed mineralized zones largely 
inspired by previous work.  The final model was constructed by InnovExplo of Val-d'Or, QC. 

The mineral resources herein are not mineral reserves as they have no demonstrable economic viability.  The 
result of this study is a single Mineral Resource Estimate for 23 mineralized zones.  The estimate includes 
Indicated and Inferred resources for open pit and underground scenarios.  The effective date of the resource 
estimate is August 29, 2017, based on compilation status. 

 DRILLHOLE DATABASE 
The GEMS diamond drillhole database (the "GEMS database") contains 255 surface drillholes (29,135.5 m; 
Figure 14.1).  Some of these are condemnation holes for which InnovExplo did not receive assay results.  A 
subset of 202 holes cut across the mineralized zones of the Project (this total includes holes from the zones 
formerly known as the JR and Hydro showings).  All 255 holes in the GEMS database were compiled and 
validated for the resource estimate.  

The information for the 202 diamond drillholes includes lithological descriptions taken from drillcore logs, as 
well as 4,631 sampled intervals amounting to 4,145 m of core.  The holes cover the strike-length of the Project 
at a drill spacing of 30 to 70 m (mostly less than 50 m).  

In addition to basic tables of raw data, the GEMS database also includes several tables of calculated drillhole 
composites and wireframe solid intersections, which were used for the statistical evaluation and resource block 
modelling. 

Data verification by author Pierre-Luc Richard during the course of a previous mandate comprised the 
following and is summarized in Section 12:   

— A site visit to the Project and the logging/core storage facilities;  
— Verification of selected drillhole collar locations;  
— A review of selected core intervals, QA/QC protocols and downhole surveys;  
— A review of assays and the descriptions of lithologies, alterations and structures in the database; and  
— Confirmation that there are no mined-out areas.  

InnovExplo personnel also collected 12 drillcore quarter-splits during the site visit and sent them to the 
laboratory for an independent review.

 INTERPRETATION OF MINERALIZED ZONES 
In order to conduct accurate resource modelling, the mineralized-zone wireframe model was based on the 
GEMS database and the author's knowledge of the Project and similar deposits.  

The interpretation of the Project was based on geological and grade continuity using transverse sections spaced 
50 m apart.  

The model comprises 23 mineralized solids that honour the drillhole database.  A total of 1,084 construction 
lines were created (233 3D rings and 851 tie lines), all of which were snapped to drillhole intercepts to produce 
valid solids. 

The mineralized zones were defined solely on lithium and tantalum grades and did not take into account other 
elements (Rb, Cs, Ga, Be).  However, these other elements were interpolated inside the mineralized zones. 

Two surfaces were also created to define topography and overburden.  These surfaces were generated from 
drillhole descriptions and survey information provided by Critical Elements. 

Figure 14.2 presents a 3D view of the mineralized solids with drillholes used for the resource estimate.  
Figure 14.3 presents a typical cross-section through the Project.

 VOIDS MODEL 
The Project was never the subject of underground or surface excavation work. 

 HIGH-GRADE CAPPING 
Codes were automatically attributed to all drillhole assay intervals that intersect the mineralized zones using 
the name of the 3D solids, and these coded intercepts were used to analyze sample lengths and generate 
statistics for high-grade capping and composites. 

Basic univariate statistics were performed on the raw assay dataset. 

— The following criteria were used to decide whether capping was warranted or not (inspired by Parrish, 
1997), and to determine the threshold when warranted: 

— If the quantity of metal contained in the last decile is above 40%, capping is warranted; if below 40%, the 
uncapped dataset may be used. 

— No more than 10% of the overall contained metal must be contained within the first 1% of the highest grade 
samples. 

— The probability plot of grade distribution must not show abnormal breaks or scattered points outside of the 
main distribution curve. 

— The log normal distribution of grades must not show any erratic grade bins nor distanced values from the 
main population. 

Tables 14.1 and 14.2 present a summary of the statistical analysis for each element.  Figures 14.4 to 14.9 show 
graphs supporting the capping threshold decisions.

 COMPOSITING 
In order to minimize any bias introduced by the variable sample lengths, capped DDH assays were composited.  

For geological and statistical reasons, a 2 m composite, with an allowable spread of 1.5 to 3 m was selected as 
the logical option for the Project.  The total number of composites used in the DDH dataset is 1,830.  A grade of 
0.00 ppm was assigned to missing sample intervals.  Table 14.3 shows the basic statistics for composites by zone.

 DENSITY 
Densities were used to calculate tonnages from the volume estimates in the resource-grade block model. 

The author examined all available data to establish which values could be used for the Project resource 
estimate.  A total of 475 density values were judged adequate for the current study, 296 of which are in 
mineralized zones and 179 in barren country rocks.  The average density value of each individual zone was used 
in the block model.  Although values are considered realistic, additional sampling is recommended in order to 
improve confidence in the density model. 

Based on this information, InnovExplo used the density values presented in Table 14.4.

 BLOCK MODEL 
A block model was established for the purpose of the 2017 MRE.  The block model covers an area sufficient to 
host an open pit and has been pushed down to a depth of approximately 300 m below surface.  The block model 
was rotated.  Block dimensions reflect the sizes of the mineralized zones and plausible mining methods.  
Table 14.5 provides the properties of the block model.

All blocks with more than 0.001% of their volume falling within a selected solid were assigned the 
corresponding solid block code in their respective folder.  A percent block model was generated, reflecting the 
proportion of each block inside every solid (i.e.  individual mineralized zones, individual lithological domains, 
overburden, and country rock). 

Table 14.6 provides details about the naming convention for the corresponding GEMS solids, as well as the rock 
codes and block codes assigned to each individual solid.  The multi-folder percent block model thus generated 
was used for the mineral resource estimation.

 VARIOGRAPHY AND SEARCH ELLIPSOIDS 
Three-dimensional directional variography was completed for the main mineralized zone using DDH 
composites of capped assay data.  The study was carried out in Supervisor software.  The directional-specific 
investigations yielded the best-fit model along an orientation that corresponds to the strike and dip of the 
mineralized zones.  Lithium and tantalum, but also other elements such as rubidium, cesium, gallium, and 
beryllium, were investigated. 

Figures 14.10 and 14.11 show examples of the main zone variography results for lithium and tantalum, 
respectively. 

Two ellipsoids were built from the results of the variography study.  These correspond to: a) one quarter (1/4x) 
of the variography ranges; and b) whole (1x) variography ranges.  Figure 14.12 shows the Pass 1 ellipsoid for the 
main zone on a 3D view.

 GRADE INTERPOLATION 
The variography study provided the parameters to interpolate the grade model using composites of capped 
grade data in order to produce the best possible grade estimate for the defined resource.  The interpolation was 
run on a point area workspace extracted from the DDH dataset. 

The composite points were assigned block codes corresponding to the mineralized zone in which they occur.  
The interpolation profiles specify a single composite block code for each mineralized-zone solid, thus 
establishing hard boundaries between the mineralized zones and preventing block grades from being estimated 
using sample points with different block codes than the block being estimated. 

The interpolation profiles were customized to estimate grades separately for each of the mineralized zones. 
After multiple methods were considered (ID2, ID3, OK, NN), the ordinary kriging (OK) method was selected for 
the final resource estimation as it better honour the grade distribution of the Project. 

Two passes were defined.  The ellipsoid radiuses from Pass 1 were established using one quarter of the 
variography ranges.  Ellipsoid radiuses from Pass 2 used the full ranges.  Pass 2 interpolated only those blocks 
that were not interpolated during Pass 1.

 RESOURCE CATEGORIES 

14.10.1 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION DEFINITION 

The resource classification definitions used for this report are those published by the Canadian Institute of 
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum in their document 'CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 
Reserves' (CIM, 2014). 

Measured Mineral Resource:  that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, 
shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient 
to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning 
and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable 
exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as 
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and 
grade continuity. 

Indicated Mineral Resource:  that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, 
shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing 
information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings 
and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed. 

Inferred Mineral Resource:  that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be 
estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, 
geological and grade continuity.  The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes.  Due to the 
uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an 
Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of 
continued exploration.  Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to allow the meaningful application of 
technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic viability worthy of public 
disclosure.  Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming the basis of feasibility or 
other economic studies.

14.10.2 MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 

All interpolated blocks were assigned to the Inferred category during the creation of the grade block model, 
ensuring that sufficient continuity was observed in order to avoid isolated blocks being interpolated by only 
one hole.  Moreover, the average maximum distance to any composite was set at approximately 100 m. 

The reclassification to an Indicated category was done for blocks meeting all the conditions below: 

— Blocks showing geological and grade continuity; 
— Blocks from well-defined mineralized zones only; 
— Blocks from Pass 1; 
— Blocks interpolated by a minimum of two holes; and  
— Blocks for which the distance to the closest composite is less than 40 m. 

A series of outline rings (clipping boundaries) were created in long views using the criteria described above, 
while keeping in mind that a significant cluster of blocks is necessary to obtain a resource.  Within the 
Indicated resource outlines, some Inferred blocks were upgraded to the Indicated category, whereas outside 
these outlines, some Indicated blocks were downgraded to the Inferred category.  The author is of the opinion 
that this was a necessary step to homogenize (smooth out) the resource volumes in each category, and to avoid 
isolated blocks from being included in the Indicated category.  

 METALLURGICAL RECOVERY AND NSR CALCULATION 
Given the polymetallic (Li and Ta) nature of the mineralization comprising the Project, InnovExplo created an 
NSR block model by calculating the value of each mineralized block.  

A lithium recovery formula was provided by Paul Bonneville, a representative of Critical Elements.  The 
formula applied a top-cut recovery value of 91.6905% for any lithium grade above 5,595 ppm.  Furthermore, a 
lithium recovery of 0% was applied to Zone 119 as requested by Critical Elements.  

Figure 14.13 shows the seven tests results and the metallurgical recovery formula derived from them.  
InnovExplo has not seen the study supporting these values.

Figure 14.13 Lithium Recovery based on Lithium Grade  

 
Note:  Figure compiled from data provided by Paul Bonneville 

A fixed recovery of 64% was applied to tantalum throughout the deposit.  This recovery value was provided by 
Paul Bonneville, a representative of Critical Elements.  InnovExplo has not seen the study supporting this value. 

No penalty was applied to the NSR calculation as no supporting information was provided to InnovExplo.  The 
resultant is Lithium and Tantalum being payable where all other elements (Rb, Cs, Ga, Be) do not contribute to 
the economics of the deposit. 

The NSR calculation used a USD/CAD exchange rate of 1.25, a lithium price of US$15,000 per tonne Li2O, and a 
tantalum price of US$130 per kilogram Ta2O5.  These exchange rate and metal prices were provided by 
Paul Bonneville, a representative of Critical Elements. 

Using the information provided to InnovExplo mentioned above, the NSR value is given by the following 
formula:  

NSR Value = [(Li2OGrade (%) x LiRecovery (%) x LiPrice ($) x Exchange Rate) – (Concentrate Transport Cost x 
Exchange Rate x Li2OGrade (%) / AverageMillFeedGrade (%))] + (Ta2O5Grade (%) x TaRecovery (%) x TaPrice ($) x 
Exchange Rate). 

Metallurgical Recoveries: The resource model recovery information was provided to Mr. Bonneville, P.Eng., 
by Sunil Koppalkar, Senior Metallurgist for Bumigeme Inc., via email on August 29, 2017.  Mr. Koppalkar 
mentioned in his email that the grade recovery curve was developed based on recent metallurgical test work 
on low-grade composites at SGS Minerals Lakefield. 

Metal Prices: Although Mr. Richard was not provided with confidential contract terms held by Critical 
Elements, an online review allowed him to confirm that the lithium and tantalum prices submitted by Mr. 
Bonneville for the resource model (15,000$/t Li2O and 130$/kg Ta2O5) are in line with recent contract pricing 
terms in the industry; see Galaxy press release dated June 14, 2017 for lithium (15,090$/t Li2O) and InfoMine 
price for Ta2O5 varying from 123$ to 179$ over the last two years.

Transport Costs: Transport costs used for the resource estimate cut-off grades calculation are identical to 
what has been used elsewhere in the Report (item 15). InnovExplo reviewed this cost and found it adequate for 
this study. 

 

 CUT-OFF PARAMETERS 
Mineral Resources were compiled using a minimum NSR cut-off of CAN$110 for the underground potential and 
CAN$30 for the open-pit potential.  Parameters used to determine such cut-offs are presented below. 

The NSR cut-offs must be re-evaluated continually according to prevailing market conditions and other factors, 
such as lithium and tantalum prices, exchange rate, mining method, related costs, etc.

The two commodity prices considered for the economic pit are lithium oxide (Li2O) at US$15,000 per tonne and 
tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) at US$130 per kg.  No commodity selling costs were considered for the Whittle run.  

An adjustment of 0.5 m was made to account for loss during ore block removal, resulting in an average mining 
dilution of 11.71% on total ore tonnage.  Given that ore and waste are easily distinguishable, a mining recovery 
assumption of 95% was applied.  The design of the in-pit mineral resource shell was based on the latest 
geotechnical study provided by Mine Design Engineering in their report titled 'Update to Rose Pit Geotechnical 
Model and Open Pit Stability Assessment', issued on March 1, 2017.  An overall slope angle of 55° was applied to 
all pit areas except for the North area where a 50° overall slope angle is suggested.  The pit walls in overburden 
will have a 21° overall slope angle.  Mining and processing costs, derived from budgetary estimates, hands-on 
knowledge with comparable projects, and literature surveys are the same as for the previous PEA. 

The marginal NSR cut-off (MNSR) used in Whittle was calculated using the input parameters of Table 14.7 
according to the following equation: 

	 	 · Mining Dilution +1
	

29.70	 $ 

 

The in-pit Resource Estimate presented herein used a rounded value of CAN$30 as the marginal NSR cut-off. 

Two exclusions to the block model were considered: 

— The Eastmain Reservoir of the public utility Hydro-Québec, adjacent to the east side of the Project, and a 
30 m buffer zone around its perimeter.  

— Lake #3, next to the north area of the pit outline, and a buffer zone of 30 m around the lake. 

The blocks falling into these zones were discarded from the optimization in Whittle.   

14.12.2 UNDERGROUND RESOURCE CUT-OFF PARAMETERS 

The underground cut-off value was determined using the parameters presented in Table 14.8. 

Table 14.8 Underground Cut-Off Parameters

Ore processing costs 16.07

The ore processing costs, the general and administration costs, and the sustaining capital are the same as for 
the previous PEA.  The mining costs are based on hands-on knowledge with comparable projects. 

The underground NSR cut-off is calculated using the parameters of Table 14.8 according to the following 
equation: 

UG_NSR=Mining+Processing+G&A+Sustaining capital= CAN$111.06  

The Underground Resource Estimate presented herein uses a rounded value of $CAN110 for the underground 
NSR cut-off. 

 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
All amounts are reported in Canadian dollars. 

Given the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, the drillhole density, and the specific 
interpolation parameters, InnovExplo is of the opinion that the current mineral resource estimate can be 
classified as Indicated and Inferred resources.  The estimate was prepared in accordance with CIM's standards 
and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves. 

Table 14.9 displays the results of the in situ Mineral Resource Estimate for the Project at the official $30 NSR 
cut-off for the open-pit scenario and at the official $110 NSR cut-off for the underground scenario.  Tables 14.10 
to 14.13 display the in situ resource and sensitivity at other cut-off scenarios.  The reader should be cautioned 
that values listed in Tables 14.10 to 14.13 should not be misinterpreted as a mineral resource statement.  The 
reported quantities and grade estimates at different cut-off grades are provided for the sole purpose of 
demonstrating the sensitivity of the resource model to the selection of a reporting cut-off value. 

Figures 14.14 and 14.15 show the grade distribution and classification, respectively, for the open-pit scenario. 
Figures 14.16 and 14.17 show different views of the above. 

Sensitivity charts are presented on Figures 14.18 to 14.25.

— Sensitivity was assessed using cut-off NSR values for $5-10 increments from $20 to $150.  The official 
resource is reported at a cut-off of $30 NSR for the open-pit and $110 NSR for the underground potential, 
based on market conditions.  Cut-offs must be re-evaluated in light of prevailing market conditions (metal 
price, exchange rate and mining cost). 

A range of densities was used on a per-zone basis based on statistical analysis of all available data. 

A minimum true thickness of 2.0 m was applied, using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a 
value of zero when not assayed. 

High-grade capping was done on raw assay data based on the statistical analyses of individual mineralized zones. 

Compositing was done on drillhole intercepts falling within mineralized zones (composite lengths range from 
1.5 m to 3 m in order to adequately distribute the tails). 

Resources were evaluated from drillholes using a 2-pass OK interpolation method in a block model (block size = 
5 m x 5 m x 5 m). 

The Inferred category is only defined within the areas where blocks were interpolated during Pass 1 or Pass 2 
where continuity is sufficient to avoid isolated blocks being interpolated by only one drillhole.  The Indicated 
category is defined only by blocks interpolated by a minimum of two drillholes in areas where the maximum 
distance to the closest drillhole composite is less than 40 m for blocks interpolated in Pass 1.  

The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest hundred.  Any discrepancies in the totals are due to 
rounding effects.  Rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101. 

InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, 
marketing, or other relevant issue that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.

 COMPARISON TO THE PREVIOUS RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
The most important difference with the previous mineral resource estimate is the use of a lower NSR cut-off 
than for the 2011 MRE. This new NSR cut-off is supported by economic assumptions defined during the course 
of the current mandate. The estimate also used an updated NSR calculation supported by new assumptions for 
metal prices, net recoveries and transportation costs. 

Other technical differences of lesser significance are the use of updated density values, a new geostatistical 
study, the use of ordinary kriging instead of inverse distance squared, and the addition of holes drilled after the 
2011 MRE. 

This resulted in the following: 

— An increase in indicated tonnage (31.9 Mt versus 26.5 Mt: +20%). 
— A decrease in inferred tonnage (2.8 Mt versus 10.7 Mt: -74%). 
— A decrease in indicated Li2O grade (0.93% versus 0.98%: -5%).

— A decrease in inferred Li2O grade (0.82% versus 0.86%: -5%).

15 MINERALS RESERVE ESTIMATE 

 INTRODUCTION 
The mineral reserve estimate is based on the geological block model prepared by InnovExplo and presented in 
Section 14.0, with the exception that a constant mill recovery is used.  The effects of using a constant recovery 
were found to not materially affect the results of the FS. 

Other sections of this FS address mining, processing, metallurgic, economic and other relevant factors that 
allow the classification of the Probable Mineral Reserve. These figures were estimated by selecting an optimal 
pit. The methodology to achieve the optimal pit shell is explained below. 

 OPEN PIT OPTIMIZATION METHODOLOGY 
The objective of pit optimization is to generate an ultimate pit contour that maximizes the value of a deposit 
and to use this contour as a basis for mine design, scheduling, and economic analysis. Design parameters, such 
as operating costs, mining and metallurgical recoveries, dilution and NSR were used to generate an optimal pit 
shell. 

15.2.1 RESOURCE BLOCK MODEL 

From the grade category block model created for the mineral resource, an NSR attribute was populated using 
the grades from the indicated resources.  The NSR value was calculated using preliminary production and 
processing parameters and commodity metal prices, as follows: 

 

NSR(CAN$)

Lippm 	 	price 	 	

%	 	in	 	

	
Tappm 	 	price

%	 	in	 	

Exchange rate 

 

Where: 

— Exchange rate = USD:CAD = 1:1.25; 
— % Li in Li2O = 46.45%; 
— % Ta in Ta2O5 = 81.90%; 
— Li recovery = 85%; 
— Ta recovery = 64%; 
— Li2O price = US$15,000 per tonne of metal contained; 
— Ta2O5 price = US$130 per kilogram of metal contained; 
— Transport costs of Li2O concentrate = CAN$8.12 per Li2O% (equivalent to CAN$6.90 per tonne milled). 

This calculation was applied to all mineralized rock types except Rock Type 119.  The lithium recovery drops 
dramatically in Rock Type 119, so it was considered to be 0% in the NSR calculation.

The resulting model contained the NSR variable used in the Lerchs-Grossman algorithm for pit optimization.  
The original block size of 5 x 5 x 5 (in metres) was reblocked to 10 x 10 x 10.  The reblocking was done by 
merging blocks together while preserving the ore percent of each block.  This action adds minimal in-pit 
dilution due to the support effect (Chilès and Delfiner, 1999) but maintains the amount of ore inside the pit. 

The block value of three rock codes were imported into Whittle™ v.4.7.1 software from Dassault Systems 
GEOVIA to perform the pit optimization: 

— The overburden, coded OB. 
— The waste host rock, coded WAST, which included the meta-sediment, amphibolite, porphyry and gneiss 

rock types. 
— The ore rock from the Rose deposit, coded ORE, which included the 20 pegmatite mineralized zones, 101 to 

120. 

These three rock codes were imported separately and were assigned different production and processing 
parameters during the optimization.  The specific density of each rock type was used in the optimization 
process.  

15.2.2 PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS ON BLOCK MODEL 

The Eastmain hydroelectric reservoir is located to the east of the Property.  Hydro-Québec has an exclusion 
zone east of the Project which constitutes a physical constraint for the east side of the pit (Figure 15.1).  The pit 
excavation was limited to a distance not closer than 30 m from the exclusion zone. 

As per Critical Element's request, two additional exclusion zones were considered: 

— Rock types JR-01 to JR-04 representing mineralized zones 750 m to the northeast of the eastern limit of the 
main Rose deposit; 

— Lake #3, in the northern area of the pit outline (a 30 m buffer zone around the lake was considered). 

Blocks in these three zones were discarded from the optimization.

OPERATING COSTS 

The pit optimization is based on operating costs from the Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA), dated 
December 10, 2011. These costs were used as the required inputs in Whittle to obtain an optimal pit shell 
reflecting the economic profile of the Project.  The costs are presented in Table 15.1.

with a strip ratio of 1 : 7. 
2 Total rehabilitation cost are estimated at 7.5 M CAN$ (PEA). 
3 Sustaining capital cost are estimated at 36.8 M CAN$ (PEA). 

COMMODITY METAL PRICES 

The two commodity metal prices considered for the economic pit are lithium oxide (Li2O) at US$15,000 per 
tonne, and tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) at US$130 per kilogram.  No prices were directly input in Whittle as the NSR 
calculations in the model already included them. 

PROCESS RECOVERY 

A constant processing recovery of 85% Li and 64% Ta was used in the NSR calculation.  The latest data provided 
by Critical Elements shows that lithium recovery varies by grade.  As this information was received late in the 
FS process, the effects of this variable recovery were assessed and the results showed that it would not 
materially affect the results of the FS. 

MINING DILUTION AND MINING RECOVERY 

An excavation precision of 0.5 m was assumed for the mining of mineralized zones with hydraulic shovels.  A 
diluted tonnage, initially calculated for each zone, led to an average mining dilution of 11.7% on total ore 
tonnage.  Given that ore and waste are easily distinguishable, a 95% mining recovery was judged acceptable the 
selected mining equipment, and this value was applied to the ore.  

OVERALL SLOPE ANGLE 

The economic pit was designed based on the latest geotechnical study provided by Mine Design Engineering 
Inc. (MDE), titled 'Update to Rose Pit Geotechnical Model and Open Pit Stability Assessment', issued in July 2017.  An 
overall slope angle of 50° was used on the block on the north wall of the pit, while a steeper angle of 55° was 
used for the rest of the pit.  The pit walls in overburden will have an overall slope angle of 21°.

ANNUAL DISCOUNT RATE 

The annual discount rate used for the NPV calculation in Whittle is set at 8%.  The NPV and discounted NPV 
values calculated in Whittle are not final values, but they are preliminary comparative tools to guide the 
optimization process toward the most lucrative scenario. 

 DETERMINATION OF CUT-OFF VALUE 
The NSR cut-off value (MNSR) was calculated using the input parameters in Table 15.2, according to the following 
equation: 

M
Whittle	Processing	costs Mining	Dilution	 1

Mining	Recovery
29.70	CAN$ 

This cut-off value applies to a modified NSR value, which only considers the Li; i.e.: 

NSR(CAN$)
Lippm Li	recovery Li O	price Transport	costs	Li O

%	Li	in	Li O 100	000
Exchange rate 

This modified NSR value has the effect of privileging blocks with NSR values attributable to Li, therefore 
increasing the in-pit average grade of Li.  The Whittle input parameters are summarized in Table 15.2.

 FINAL PIT SELECTION 
The pit shell with a 0.6 revenue factor (RF) was selected.  This pit shell was selected as the base case pit shell for 
further phasing and scheduling work for the Project.  Mining additional resources by open pit beyond the limits 
of this pit shell increases the strip ratio and the footprint, but does not increase significantly the NPV of the 
Project.  This pit shell ensures an average Li2O grade above 0.85%, as requested by Critical Elements. The chosen 
pit shell has an average grade of 0.88% Li2O.  This pit, with a higher average grade, was selected to ensure that 
the desired average grade would be attained once the pit was designed.  Figures 15.2 and 15.3 compare the pit 
shells with different revenue factors.

From this Whittle shell, the final pit was designed to include ramps and catch berms.  The final pit design is 
presented in Section 16 and was used to create a mining plan that serves as the basis for the amount of ore 
material in the mineral reserve estimate. Dilution was re-evaluated within the engineered pit with the same

 MINERAL RESERVES 

15.5.1 MINERAL RESERVE CLASSIFICATION, CATEGORY, AND DEFINITION 

MINERAL RESERVE 

According to CIM Definitions Standards, a Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured or 
Indicated Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.  A Mineral Reserve includes 
diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined. 

Mineral Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Mineral Reserves and Proven 
Mineral Reserves.  A Probable Mineral Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proven Mineral Reserve. 

PROBABLE MINERAL RESERVE 

A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated and, in some circumstances, a 
Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include 
adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that 
demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.  

PROVEN MINERAL RESERVE 

A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by 
at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study.  This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, 
metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic 
extraction is justified. 

Application of the Proven Mineral Reserve category implies that the Qualified Person has the highest degree of 
confidence in the estimate with the consequent expectation in the minds of the readers of the report.  The term 
should be restricted to that part of the deposit where production planning is taking place and for which any 
variation in the estimate would not significantly affect potential economic viability. 

15.5.2 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 

The mineral resource block model contains only Indicated Resources.  Indicated Resources were converted into 
Mineral Reserves.  Following the detailed design of the final pit and detailed production scheduling with the 
cut-off NSR value, a total of 26.8 Mt of diluted ore exists inside the mine design.  The detailed pit design and 
production plan are discussed in Section 16.  Table 15.4 presents the reserves inside the engineered pit.

16 MINING METHODS 
This section describes the results of the technical work undertaken by InnovExplo to produce a mine plan for 
this Feasibility Study (FS) for the Project. 

The Project deposit is made of stacked mineralized lenses oriented north 296° having an average dip of 15° to 
the northeast (varying locally between 5° and 25°).  The orebody is relatively flat and close to the surface, 
therefore the FS was based entirely on an open pit operation. 

A conventional truck and shovel mining method is proposed to mine 220.2 Mt of material over the life of mine 
(LOM), comprised of 26.8 Mt of ore, 182.4 Mt of waste, and 11.0 Mt of overburden, for an average stripping ratio 
of 7.2:1.  This FS is based on a milling capacity of 1,610,000 t per year.  To achieve these milling production 
targets, the mining operation yearly production rate will vary accordingly between 12 and 16 Mt of rock 
material and decrease towards the end of the mine life.  All overburden material will be mined by a contractor.  
An open pit mining schedule was planned and resulted in a LOM of approximately 19 years, starting with 19 
months of pre-production, just over 16 years of production and ending with 5 months of stockpile processing.  
Table 16.1 presents the LOM mining production plan and Table 16.2 presents the resulting milling production 
plan.

 PIT DESIGN 

16.1.1 GEOTECHNICAL STUDY AND PIT DESIGN PARAMETERS 

Mine Design Engineering Inc. conducted the geotechnical analysis for the Rose Lithium-Tantalum Project and 
supplied their recommendations in their report titled 'Update to Rose Pit Geotechnical Model and Open Pit Stability 
Assessment' for the hard rock materials of the proposed pit. 

The Project pit design is based on single benching with 10 m bench heights.  This bench height was selected 
based on the loading and hauling equipment that would best suit the mining operation.  The geotechnical 
report recommends an inter-ramp angle of 57° and an overall pit slope angle of 55°.  A 90° face angle was 
considered so a minimum berm width of 6.5 m was recommended to respect the inter-ramp angle. However, a 
berm width of 7.0 m corresponding to the recommended overall slope angle was used, as ramps were only 
designed on moderately sloped pit walls (i.e.  intermediate pit walls and the ultimate south wall). 

The pit slopes in overburden respect a face ratio of 2.5:1 with a 10 m berm width, resulting in an overall slope of 
3.5:1, as per the design of the overburden stockpile.  The pit slope requirements in overburden for the pit walls 
should be analyzed in further studies.  This configuration could be steepened during the mining phase to 
reduce overburden waste mining.  

Figure 16.1 shows the pit slope design parameters used for the ultimate pit walls. 

Figure 16.1 Pit Slope Design Parameters

For intermediate pit walls, an overall slope angle of 45° was respected.  This reduction in the wall angle will 
improve slope stability and allow time for the operation to better assess the pit wall characteristics and 
optimize the final pit design.  Also, less work will be required to maintain the walls in good condition. 

Several risks were identified in the geotechnical study.  The analyses conducted by Mine Design Engineering 
Inc. consider only dry pit slope conditions.  Once a hydrogeological model for the site is completed, these 
results should be sent to Mine Design Engineering Inc. for re-analysis.  Furthermore, joint persistence should be 
further investigated when excavating the mine.  

 HAUL ROAD DESIGN 
The haulage ramps are based on the largest haulage truck and are designed for double lane traffic, except for 
the last benches of each phase which are designed for single lane traffic.  The pit ramp designs are presented on 
Figure 16.2. 

Figure 16.2 Pit Ramp Design Parameters 

 

For both ramp designs, a half-truck width is considered as buffer space. A safety ridge is designed considering a 
height equivalent to the radius of a haul truck tire and with a 2:1 slope.  Lastly, a 2 m wide ditch is included to 
allow for water drainage and pipe installation. 

The maximum gradient of the inner curvature of all ramp segments is 10%.  All switchbacks are designed with a 
flat rolling surface.

 FINAL PIT DESIGN 
Based on the selected optimized pit shell and the geotechnical parameters, a final pit design was created 
(Figure 16.3).  The mine design process is iterative and aims to convert the optimal pit shell into an operational 
open pit mine design.  Once completed, the total contents of the designed pit do not differ considerably from 
the contents of the optimized shell.  The detailed pit design was created using the Deswik 2017.1 mining 
software.  The pit design includes haulage ramp access to all benches, except for the final bench which will be 
excavated via a temporary ramp. 

Figure 16.3 Final Pit Design 

 

The final pit design is approximately 1 620 m long, 900 m wide, and 200 m deep. 

It should be noted that the pit design respects the geotechnical slope recommendations with the material 
classification from the block model.  Further site investigations and test pits were conducted following the 
generation of the block model and found varying depths of overburden in certain areas.  The pit design will 
need to be reviewed as mining progresses to account for changes in the depth of overburden.

Lastly, a 30 m perimeter around Lake 3 was maintained to avoid water infiltration in the pit.  However, this 
perimeter is estimated and not based on a hydrogeological study with a corresponding geotechnical analysis.  
This perimeter should be reviewed in further studies when more information is available.  A limit to the east of 
the pit corresponding to Hydro-Québec's Eastmain reservoir was also respected. 

 MINING PHASE DESIGNS 
Based on the Whittle pit shell optimizations, three nesting intermediate pit shells were used as guidelines to 
design the mining phases.  By sub-dividing the ultimate pit into these four separate phases, the mining rate of 
ore is kept relatively constant.  The selection of these mining phases results in a low production rate for the 
pre-production period and improves the mill feed grade in the first years of the Project. 

Phase 1 is the first intermediate and smallest of the mining phases.  It is approximately 840 m long, 570 m wide, 
and 90 m deep.  It is in the south-east corner of the final pit.  The first five ramp segments of the final pit ramp 
are developed.  The design is presented on Figure 16.4. 

Figure 16.4 Phase 1 Design 

 

Phase 2 is the second intermediate phase.  It is approximately 1,100m long, 700 m wide, and 130 m deep.  The 
design is presented on Figure 16.5.  The upper benches will be mined either directly from the surface or by 
returning on some of the final south wall benches.

Phase 3 is the third intermediate phase.  It is approximately 1,400m long, 840 m wide, and 160 m deep.  The 
design is presented on Figure 16.6.  A double-lane ramp was included in the northern wall for mining the upper 
benches.  When the phase reaches the depth to continue the main ramp on the south wall, access will be 
switched to this ramp and continued to be driven down.

Phase 4 is the ultimate pit phase design and was previously presented on Figure 16.3.  The upper benches of this 
phase will also be mined either directly from surface or by returning on some of the south wall benches. 

 MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 
The LOM for the Project is based on an ore processing rate of 4,600 tpd and 350 operating days per calendar 
year.  The LOM plan was prepared to supply the required ore quantities to the mill while reducing the overall 
quantities of material to be mined and to send higher grading ore to the mill in the first years of operation.  
Year 1 represents the start of the production period as the mill begins to process ore.  Critical Elements will 
undertake the mining of all hard rock material with its own equipment fleet and operators, while a mining 
contractor will undertake all overburden mining and stockpiling work. 

Figure 16.7 presents a graph of the mining production plan.

Figure 16.7 Mining Production Plan Graph 

 

For the pre-production period, mining will occur only in Phase 1.  This period will last 19 months.  During this 
period, the mining contractor will begin overburden removal work and a single backhoe excavator will have 
sufficient capacity to load all the hard rock material in the mine plan.  All ore will be stockpiled to prepare for 
the start-up of the mill.  A total of 4.0 Mt of material will be mined, including 1.1 Mt of overburden, 2.7 Mt of 
waste, and 0.2 Mt of ore. 

In Year 1, the production rate increases to mine just enough ore material to feed the mill.  As of Year 2, Phase 2 
overburden removal is started, and Phase 3 is started in Year 4.  The final phase, Phase 4, is started in Year 8.  A 
hard rock mining rate between 12.0 and 16.0 Mt is maintained until Year 14, followed by a gradual reduction to 
the end of mine life, as sufficient ore material is accessible. 

Strip ratios in the first nine years range between 7.0 and 9.1 and then decrease until the end of the mine life, 
with the exception of Year 13.  The overall strip ratio for the Project is 7.2. 

This production plan produces enough ore material to supply the mill, except for Year 13 and the two final 
years of operation, where a significant portion of the ore feed will come from the ore stockpile.

 ORE STOCKPILE MANAGEMENT 
A stockpile capable of storing up to 3.9 Mt of ore was designed by WSP.  The design criteria for this stockpile are 
elaborated in Section 18.2. 

The ore stockpile area is located directly to the east of the crusher and just to the south-west of the main ramp 
exit and will store any surplus ore that is mined at any given time.  An area capable of storing some ore on the 
Run-of-Mine pad is also available to manage spontaneous issues with the crusher. 

During the pre-production period, all ore material mined from the pit is stockpiled.  During the production 
period, ore exiting the mine is sent to the crusher, as this material has precedence over material from the ore 
stockpile.  This process will reduce the quantity of material to be re-handled.  During production periods where 
more ore material is mined than can be processed, lower grading ore is sent to the stockpile to ensure that 
higher grading ore is processed earlier.  Only during production periods where insufficient ore is mined will ore 
be reclaimed from the stockpile. 

 WASTE AND TAILINGS MANAGEMENT 
Two piles have been designed for the storage of waste material.  One large waste rock pile is located directly to 
the west of the pit and near the main ramp exit, and one overburden pile is located to the south of the pit, as 
presented on Figure 16.8. 

The waste stockpile will be constructed in two phases.  A co-deposition strategy will be used to store both the 
dry tailings produced by the mill and the mined waste rock material on the waste stockpile.  However, the 
strategy should be reviewed for both operational efficiency and geotechnical stability (Section 18).

Figure 16.8 Stockpile Map 

 

Some waste material will be needed for mining the upper benches of Phase 2 and 4.  As previously described, 
the upper benches of Phase 2 and 4 will be mined by returning on some of the south wall benches via 
temporary ramps.  As such, waste material will be used to create temporary ramps from the main ramp and to 
backfill some narrow benches to allow for haulage trucks to travel safely.  These quantities were not considered 
in the deposition plan as they are not significant and could be re-handled throughout the final years. 

 MINING OPERATION 
The mining operation will run 24 hours per day and all year round, based on a 350-day year.  The equipment 
performance indexes were estimated to properly evaluate the number of each type of main production 
equipment needed. 

The mechanical availability of an equipment is defined as the percentage of time that the equipment is 
mechanically functional.  For the haulage and loading equipment, an initial mechanical availability of 90% was 
used in the beginning of the Project, with a gradual reduction to 82% at the end of the mine life.  For the drills, a 
constant 82% mechanical availability was used, as these equipment tend to work in more difficult conditions.  
All other equipment were considered to have a constant 85% mechanical availability.

The use of availability of an equipment is defined as the percentage of time that the equipment is running 
when mechanically available.  This factor accounts for all delays such as lunch breaks and shift changes.  The 
use of availability for the haul trucks, the production backhoe excavator and the production wheel loader was 
82.5%, and the electric shovel was 83.9%.  Tables 16.3 and 16.4 present the delays considered.  The electric 
shovel does not need to be re-fuelled, so this delay does not apply.  The production drills were assigned a use of 
availability of 75%.  All other equipment were given various rates depending on the needs of the operation.  For 
example, while the water trucks are necessary, they will not be constantly in operation, so a lower rate was 
considered to reflect the need.

The efficiency of the equipment is defined as the percentage of time that the equipment is used for actual 
production work when running.  For example, when a shovel operator cleans his bench and moves to better 
position the shovel with regards to the excavation face, the shovel is mechanically available and it is running.  
However, the shovel is not loading any material into a truck, so it is not producing.  The efficiency index 
considers this unproductive time.  A proportion of 55 efficient work minutes per 60-minute hour was used for 
the Project. 

The product of all these indexes is the overall equipment efficiency (OEE).  These factors were used to 
determine the quantity of equipment needed and the production rates.  Furthermore, these rates were used to 
evaluate the consumables costs (i.e.  tires, wear parts, fuel, etc.) and the manpower needs for each equipment. 

 LOADING 
Several factors contributed to the selection of the type of loading equipment for the mining operation.  First, as 
the mineralized pegmatite dykes are narrow and dip sub-horizontally (between 5° and 25°), a small backhoe 
excavator was evaluated for ore mining purposes.  Furthermore, to reduce dilution, it is planned for 
mineralized areas to be mined in 5 m flitches.  Based on the production targets and these operational 
constraints, a 7.4 m³ backhoe excavator was selected. 

Second, as the pit has a relatively high strip ratio, an equipment capable of loading greater quantities of waste 
rock was desired, therefore, a 15 m³ hydraulic front shovel was selected.  Given that the operation is connected 
to Hydro-Québec's hydroelectric grid, this equipment will be electrically driven, thus reducing power costs and 
gas emissions. 

Third, a 13.8 m³ production wheel loader was added to the loading fleet, as it will provide operational 
flexibility.  This equipment can quickly be dispatched to anywhere in the pit or to the ore stockpile. 

Given the varying thickness of the mineralized zones, some instances where the ore zone is thick enough to be 
mined by the front shovel or the wheel loader should be evaluated during the operation. 

 HAULING 
As there are two different sized loading shovels, two different types of trucks will be used.  The ±65 t payload 
trucks will be paired with the backhoe excavator and the ±135 t payload trucks will be paired with the hydraulic 
front shovel and the production wheel loader.  The ±65 t payload trucks will be used for transporting both ore 
and waste material out of the pit, while the ±135 t payload trucks will be used to transport mined waste 
material out of the pit, reclaimed ore from the ore stockpile to the crusher, and the dry tailings to the waste 
stockpile. 

The ±135 t haul trucks will haul all the stockpiled ore to the crusher and the tailings from the tailings plant to 
the waste stockpile.  To consider crusher down times (both expected and unexpected), 5% of all ore from the pit 
that should have been sent directly to the crusher was considered to be sent to the ore stockpile and re-
handled within the same period.  Furthermore, as the tailings will be stockpiled in the same area as the waste 
from the pit, the mine operation haul trucks will also transport this material. 

The haul fleet requirements meet the production objectives of the LOM and were adjusted to optimize the 
purchase and replacement plan.  The requirements are based on haul cycles times for each year of mining by 
material type, by phase, and by truck type.  Conservative average truck speeds per segment type (i.e.  
loaded/unloaded, uphill/flat/downhill, etc.) were used to calculate the haul cycle times.

 DRILLING 
Most production drilling will occur in waste as the strip ratio for the Project is high.  Two high-capacity rotary 
diesel blasthole drills are dedicated to drilling waste panels, whereas drilling in ore panels will be performed by 
a down-the-hole drill rig.  The down-the-hole drill is also suited to perform pre-splitting of the final walls.  
During the pre-production period, this drill will also perform all drilling in waste panels. 

Table 16.5 presents the drilling patterns for the ore and waste blasts and the pre-split holes. 

Table 16.5 Ore, Waste, and Pre-Split Drilling Patterns

Powder factor (kg/t) 0.37 0.32 0.32  

 

The spacing and burden dimensions of drilling patterns were designed primarily to reach a targeted powder 
factor for optimal blasting.  This geometry was also chosen to allow a decent working area for the blasthole 
drills in the waste pattern and for the down-the-hole drill rig in all patterns.  Pre-split holes will only be drilled 
for ultimate pit walls with 10 m holes at 1.25 m apart. 

 BLASTING 
The blast designs were optimized to reach a targeted powder factor (PF) for optimal blasting in each rock 
domain.  The ore domain, mainly constituted of pegmatite and gneiss, was attributed a PF of 0.37.  The waste 
domain was attributed a PF of 0.32. 

The ore and waste blast patterns were also planned to reduce the charge density, while achieving the targeted 
PF, to reduce explosives costs. The designs are presented in Table 16.5. 

These parameters will need to be re-evaluated with the experience gained during the mining operation.  
Further analyses should be performed to evaluate the particle size distribution needed for the crusher's 
operation.  The ore blast pattern could potentially be widened and consequently reduce the PF. 

16.12.1 EXPLOSIVES AND ACCESSORIES 

A bulk emulsion, composed of ammonium nitrate pearls in an emulsion matrix, was selected as the explosive 
for the Project.  The two components are transported and stored separately on site.  These components are 
combined in a mobile manufacturing unit (MMU) truck on the blast panel to create the emulsion.

This type of bulk emulsion is recommended for multiple reasons: 

— The product's matrix is conceived to resist the multiple transfers during the transportation to site.  A total 
of four transfers will be required from the manufacturing plant to the blast panel (plant, transport tank 
truck, ISO container on site, MMU truck, blast panel). 

— The addition of ammonium nitrate pearls in the emulsion increases the quality of the fragmentation and 
the rock heave during the blast. 

— The emulsion performs well in summer and in winter. 
— The emulsion is very resistant to water. 

The MMU trucks will be used to pump the explosive emulsion in the blastholes.  The Project will require two 
trucks:  one operating and one as a backup. 

The explosive that was selected for pre-splitting needs is a packaged emulsion in a continuous cartridge, traced 
with 10g/m detonating cord.  The continuous explosive column provides a consistent blast pressure along the 
entire loaded hole resulting in a uniform tensile shearing effect, much needed for pre-splitting.   

Only electronic detonators are considered for this Project, as they allow for more precise blasts and 
consequently provide better control on rock projection and vibrations.  Their high precision lead to more 
stable highwalls, fewer misfires, reduced oversize and undersize rock fragments, and a better rock heave.  

All the equipment and consumables will be provided by the explosive supplier, except for the stemming 
material which will be provided by the mine. 

16.12.2 SITE-MIXED EMULSION FACILITY 

A site-mixed emulsion facility will be built for the Project.  All the civil and earth works for the plant will be 
managed by the mine during pre-production.  A geotechnical study, site preparation, foundations, sanitary 
systems, electricity, potable water, process water, and the required lifting equipment will be provided by the 
mine. 

The explosive supplier will oversee the construction of the facility.  For the magnitude of the Project, a storage 
capacity of 40,000 kg of bulk emulsion, 52,000 kg of ANP, 20,000 kg of package emulsion, and 15,000 detonator 
units are required.  Also, a heated truck shop for the MMU truck maintenance and office space are necessary.  
The site selection meets the minimum distance requirements as specified by Natural Resources Canada 
Explosives Regulatory Division. 

16.12.3 BLAST MONITORING 

As dilution control and mining recovery will be important factors for the mining operation, it will be essential 
to monitor the movement of each blast in mineralized areas.  As such, a monitoring system has been considered 
for the Project.  Beacons will be placed strategically in holes throughout the ore blast patterns.  The position of 
these beacons will be surveyed before and after each blast.  The geology department will then be able to re-
interpret the location of the ore after each blast. 

By monitoring the movement of each blast, the drill and blast technicians will be able to adjust the patterns and 
blast sequences in order to improve the heave of the ore blasts and, consequently, dilution and recovery.

 STOCKPILE AND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND MINE SERVICES 
Several other equipment will be needed to operate the mine to support the main production fleet.  A wheel 
dozer and some motor graders will be required to maintain cleared roads and pit floors.  Several bulldozers will 
be needed to maintain the waste and ore stockpiles.  An auxiliary excavator will be required for scaling and 
general work around the pit, and will also have a hammer attachment to break oversize rocks.  A smaller wheel 
loader will be required also for general work around the pit and to move the electrical equipment required to 
power the electric hydraulic shovel (i.e.  cables and substation).  Some trucks will be required to spray the pit 
roads with water in the warmer months to suppress dust and to spread sand in the winter for better traction.  A 
fuel and lube truck will be needed to replenish all track-mounted and stationary equipment. 

 EQUIPMENT SUMMARY 
A detailed list of all the main production mining equipment required per year throughout the mine life is 
presented in Table 16.6.  Other smaller equipment, such as transport vehicles and tower lights, are also 
required for the operation of the mine.

 MINE DEWATERING 
Shallow lakes and rivers characterize the area around the pit.  In fact, two lakes are within the pit limits and 
will be pumped during the pre-production period.  As previously explained in Section 15, an exclusion zone 
surrounding a third lake to the north of the pit was included in the pit optimization simulations, as per the 
request of Critical Elements.  Also, the reservoir for Hydro-Québec's Eastmain complex is located directly to the 
east of the pit. 

A hydrogeological model of the site was not available at the time of this study, so only preliminary values for 
water infiltration and precipitation were considered.  The precipitation and weather values considered are the 
30-year average values measured at the 'La Grande Rivière A' station between 1971 and 2000.  The preliminary 
groundwater measurements have indicated high flow rates in the pit.  As this quantity would be too great to 
handle with an in-pit dewatering network, dewatering wells will be drilled around the pit to prevent inflow to 
the mine (see Section 18.13 for further details on the dewatering wells).  This strategy is also conservative as 
the geotechnical analysis was evaluated only under dry conditions.  As such, mine dewatering needs in the pit 
are limited to precipitation and an estimated 100 m³/hr of inflow. 

During the pre-production period, all dewatering work will be executed by the mining contractor.  During the 
production period, a combination of diesel powered pumps will be used to dewater the pit.  Diesel powered 
pumps were considered as they can be easily moved anywhere in the pit, however the use of electric pumps 
should be considered in future studies. 

A complete review of mine dewatering needs is necessary once a hydrogeological model of the site is 
completed. 

 MAINTENANCE 
The maintenance department will consist mainly of mechanics, mechanic helpers, welders, and electricians.  
The ratio used to estimate the personnel needs for this department is 60% of the total operators of the main 
production mining departments.  Furthermore, maintenance planners will coordinate all maintenance work. 

While the Project is remotely located, it is still easily accessible year-round by road.  As such, damaged parts 
can easily be sent out to the equipment suppliers for repairs or be replaced with new ones, and specialized 
personnel can be sent to the site for special repairs. 

 ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT 
The engineering department will be responsible for providing all production and technical support to the 
mining operations.  The department will consist of a chief engineer, a senior engineer, planning engineers, drill 
and blast technicians, geotechnical and hydrogeological technicians, and surveyors. 

 GEOLOGY DEPARTMENT 
The geology department will be responsible for updating all the geological information and following the 
mineralized zones.  The department will consist of a chief geologist, a senior geologist, production geologists, 
and grade control technicians.

 GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT 
The general and administration department will be responsible for all supervision and administrative work.  
This department consists of the mine and technical services superintendents, the mine, pit, and maintenance 
foremen, a mine trainer, an administrative assistant and some clerks. 

 MANPOWER 
A total of 199 employees will be needed at the peak of mining operations, not including contractors.  This 
manpower requirement is based on an operation that runs 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and 350 days 
per year. 

As the site is remotely located, the working schedule for all employees will be a fly-in/fly-out rotation of two 
working weeks and two rest weeks, for 12 hours each day. 

Manpower requirements for the Project will vary over time, as presented on Figure 16.9.  Some personnel, such 
as surveyors and maintenance teams, will be needed even after mining operations are completed for ore 
stockpile reclaiming purposes and other general activities.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 

 SPODUMENE PLANT 
The spodumene concentrate will be recovered by froth flotation.  The spodumene plant or concentrator 
consists of a crushing area, beneficiation and dewatering areas. 

The concentrator will be designed to produce a spodumene concentrate grading 6.0% Li2O (technical grade) or 
higher.  However, spodumene concentrate grading 5.0% (chemical grade) could also be produced. 

To achieve this concentration, the beneficiation processes include crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, and 
flotation.  The spodumene concentrate, tantalum concentrate, and tailings will undergo further steps of 
thickening, filtration, drying, and material handling, including storage and loading.  Dried spodumene 
concentrate will be loaded on trucks and the tantalum concentrate will be bagged prior shipping.  Tailings will 
be dry stacked in the waste rock facility.  

17.1.1 PROCESS DESIGN CRITERIA 

All throughput rates were based on milling of 1,610,000 dry tonnes.  The spodumene process flowsheet retained 
is capable of producing a spodumene concentrate grading +6.0% Li2O or lower.  Tantalum concentrate grading 
2% Ta2O5 will be produced.  Further, 20% Ta2O5 could be produced by adding gravity concentration equipment 
as demonstrated by the ongoing test work at SGS. 

Based on the feed variability simulations developed by Outotec Finland, 'Feed Variability Simulation of Critical 
Elements Spodumene Concentrator', Outotec Report 17015-MP-R Confidential September, 2017 the spodumene 
plant will be able to produce a spodumene concentrate, grading 6.0% Li2O with a lithium recovery of 87% at feed 
grade of 0.85% Li2O.   

The spodumene plant will operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and 52 weeks per year.  The concentrator 
operating availability will be 90%, and the crushing plant will be operated at 50% availability.  The concentrator 
capacity has been established at a nominal throughput rate of 4,900 dry tonnes per day.  The process design 
criteria is presented in Table 17.1.

17.1.3 FLOWSHEETS AND PROCESS DESCRIPTION 

Simplified flowsheet indicating the process is presented on Figure 17.2.  Detailed process flowsheets have been 
developed and are presented in Appendix 17-B. The crushing facility can operate independent of the 
concentrator.  The concentrator has three distinct areas, magnetic separation for tantalum recovery, flotation 
for mica, and spodumene concentrates and thickening, filtration, drying and bagging.  

The detailed description of the process areas is given below. 

CRUSHING 

The crushing section can be divided into in two areas, primary crushing including jaw crusher and the 
secondary crushing includes secondary and tertiary cone crushers and screens. 

The ROM ore will be dumped onto a feed ore hopper by the mine haul trucks.  The grizzly feeder installed 
under the hopper feeds the oversize to the jaw crusher.  The jaw crusher breaks the ore and the broken 
material along with the grizzly feeder undersize will be transported via conveyor to secondary crusher 
building.  The jaw crusher discharge will have a particle size distribution of 80 % less than (P80) 150 mm. 

The secondary crushing section consists of a secondary double deck vibrating screen and a secondary cone 
crusher and a tertiary double deck screen and a tertiary cone crusher.  The oversize from the top deck and the 
bottom deck reports to the secondary crusher, while the undersize bypass the secondary crusher.  The tertiary 
cone crusher operated in closed circuit with a tertiary double deck vibrating screen receives the crushed ore 
from the secondary crushing.  The oversize from the tertiary vibrating screen feeds the tertiary cone crusher.  
The undersize from the tertiary screen reports to the crushed ore storage dome. 

The secondary cone crusher crushes the oversize to a (P80) of 39 mm and the tertiary crusher crushes the 
oversize to a (P80) of 13 mm.  Both crusher discharges will be re-directed to the tertiary double deck vibrating 
screen via three belt conveyors. 

CRUSHED ORE STORAGE DOME 

Crushed ore will be stored in a storage dome having 9,200 tonnes stockpile capacity.  The stockpile has been 
designed to hold ore stock for two (2) days of uninterrupted milling capacity.  

Ore will be withdrawn from the crushed ore stockpile using four (4) belt feeders, two (2) operating and two (2) 
in standby mode.  The operating belt feeders transfer the crushed ore via a conveyor to the grinding mill. 

GRINDING 

The grinding circuit consists of a ball mill operated in closed circuit with two-stage hydrocyclones clusters.  
The two-stage cyclone classification system minimizes overgrinding of spodumene ore and helps minimize 
spodumene losses as slimes. 

The undersize from the 1st stage cyclone cluster will be pumped to the 2nd stage cyclone cluster, while the 
underflow from the 2nd stage cyclone cluster will be returned to the mill for grinding.  The overflows from the 
two stages will be combined and sent to a wet magnetic separation circuit. 

TANTALUM RECOVERY 

Wet magnetic separation will be performed in two stages, rougher and scavenger magnetic separation for 
recovering magnetic tantalum minerals from the flotation feed.

The magnetic tantalum concentrates recovered will be sent to a thickener and vacuum filtration for 
dewatering.  Further, a dryer will remove residual moisture down to 1% by weight to bag the tantalum 
concentrate in bulk bags for shipment. 

MICA FLOTATION 

The removal of slimes is done prior to mica flotation to improve flotation performance and reduce the reagent 
dosage, as slimes have a tendency to increase the reagent consumption.  The cyclone underflow will be 
conditioned with AERO 3030C and Soda ash (Na2CO3) for floating mica. 

In mica flotation, the floated mica will be considered as tailings.  There will be two (2) stages of mica flotation.  
The first stage is the rougher mica flotation stage to remove as much liberated mica as possible and the second 
stage is a cleaner flotation stage, which releases the entrained spodumene particles back into the beneficiation 
process.  The mica cleaner concentrate goes to the tailings thickener.  The rougher and cleaner tailings go to 
the attrition circuit for further processing. 

ATTRITION 

A dewatering cyclone step prepares the feed for attrition.  The attrition scrubbing circuit will remove 
deleterious slimes prior to spodumene flotation.  Caustic soda (NaOH) and F220 dispersant will be added to 
facilitate scrubbing.  The attrition step has to be performed at a higher pulp density (60% solids) to be effective.  

A desliming cyclones cluster will remove slimes generated from attrition prior to spodumene flotation and 
provides the high slurry density required for spodumene ore conditioning. 

SPODUMENE FLOTATION 

The spodumene flotation circuit starts with high density conditioning.  High density conditioning is a process 
requirement to obtain proper flotation results.  F220 dispersant, soda ash (Na2CO3) and Fatty acid-2 collector 
will be added to high density conditioning (60%) tank. 

Spodumene flotation will be a standard rougher–scavenger and cleaner flotation process.  The spodumene will 
be floated to produce a rougher concentrate.  To minimize spodumene losses during flotation, the rougher 
tailings will be further floated in a scavenger flotation circuit.  The rougher concentrate undergoes two-stage 
cleaning to produce a high grade spodumene concentrate (>6.0% Li2O or chemical grade at 5.0% Li2O depending 
on the market conditions).  F220 dispersant and Fatty acid-2 collector will be added to the cleaner flotation to 
improve performance.  The second cleaner flotation concentrate will be pumped to the concentrate thickener.  
The cleaner tailings and the scavenger concentrates return to the attrition circuit. 

SPODUMENE CONCENTRATE DEWATERING AND STORAGE 

Spodumene cleaner flotation concentrate from second cleaner will be thickened to 65% solids in a high rate 
thickener.  The thickened concentrate will then be filtered to 15% moisture in a vacuum disc filter.  The filtered 
concentrate will be dried on a rotary dryer to remove residual moisture to around 1% by weight to store in 
1,500 tonnes spodumene concentrate storage bins.  Trucks will be used to ship the concentrate. 

TAILINGS DEWATERING AND STORAGE 

Tailings from several locations in the plant will be collected and thickened to 60% solids in a high rate 
thickener.  The thickened tailings will be filtered to 15% moisture using a vacuum disc filter.  The filtered 
tailings will be discharged on a conveyor that brings the dried tailings to a truck loading hopper. 

Mine haul trucks transport the tailings to the waste rock facility.

17.1.4 SPODUMENE PLANT – EQUIPMENT SIZING AND SELECTION 

The equipment selection was based on the design criteria developed from the metallurgical test 
work.  The equipment list was prepared and the equipment was sized according to the 
developed design criteria, the flowsheet drawings, and the mass balance.  An equipment list 
showing electrical power is presented in Appendix 17-C.  The crushing equipment was designed 
with 22% overdesign, the processing equipment was designed with 11% overdesign, and the 
slurry pumps were designed with 10% overdesign. 

Crushing of the ROM takes place in two crusher buildings.  

PRIMARY CRUSHING 

The primary crushing building houses the ore hopper, stationary grizzly, rock breaker, the 
vibrating grizzly feeder, and the jaw crusher.  ROM ore will be hauled from the open pit mine.  
The mine haul trucks dump directly into the ore hopper.  A stationary grizzly installed on the 
hopper prevents oversized rocks reporting to the jaw crusher.  A rock breaker breaks the 
oversize boulders.  A vibrating grizzly feeder (1.6 m wide x 6.1 m long) extracts the ore from the 
hopper and feeds the oversize to a 224 kW jaw crusher.  The undersize, less than (P80) 150 mm in 
size bypass jaw crusher.  The crushed ore and the fines will be conveyed to the secondary 
crushing building that contains two vibrating screens and the secondary and tertiary cone 
crushers. 

A 15-tonne overhead crane installed in the jaw crusher building will be used for maintenance.  
A dust collector with various pickup points collects dust generated at conveyor discharges and 
transfer points. 

SECONDARY AND TERTIARY CRUSHING 

The crushed ore from the jaw crusher will be screened on the secondary vibrating screen 
consisting of one 1.80 m wide × 4.80 m long doubledeck screen with top deck screen aperture of 
100 mm and the bottom deck screen aperture of 35 mm. 

The oversize from the two decks will be crushed in the secondary cone crusher of 300 kW 
producing crushed ore, at a P80 of 39 mm.  The discharge from the secondary crusher and the 
screen undersize will be sent to the tertiary doubledeck vibrating screen, 2.4 m wide x 8.5 m 
long, with top deck screen aperture of 32 mm and bottom deck screen aperture of 19 mm.  The 
tertiary screen will be operated in closed circuit with the tertiary cone crusher.  

The oversize from the tertiary screen will be crushed in the tertiary cone crusher of 375 kW 
and will produce crushed ore at a P80 of 16 mm.  The discharge from this crusher will be sent 
back to the tertiary double vibrating screen.  The undersize from the tertiary vibrating screen 
will have a P80 of 12.5 mm and will be transported by a conveyor to a crushed ore storage dome. 

The cone crusher building has a 5-tonne overhead crane for maintenance purposes.  A dust 
collector installed in this building collects dust emissions from various conveyor discharge 
points and transfer tower.

CRUSHED ORE STORAGE DOME 

The crushed ore stockpile is covered by a storage dome and is located outside the crushing 
building, close to the mill.  The crushed ore storage dome is 42 m diameter x 20 m high and will 
have a storage capacity of 9,200 tonnes. 

Four variable speed belt feeders are installed under the storage dome.  Two belt feeders are 
capable of supplying the rated tonnage to the ball mill.  The feeders discharge the ore on to the 
mill feed conveyor. 

Bin vent type dust collectors control dust emissions from the storage dome and the belt 
feeders. 

GRINDING 

Grinding will be performed in an overflow discharge ball mill.  The ball mill, 5.0 m diameter x 
8.2 m long, with 3550 kW motor will be operated in closed circuit with a two-stage 
hydrocyclones classification system.  Grinding is performed using 75 mm dia. grinding balls at a 
ball load of ~285 tonnes.  Mill discharge will be pumped to the 1st cyclone cluster (6 x 380 mm) 
and the underflow will be pumped to the 2nd cyclone cluster.  The underflow from the 2nd 
cyclone cluster (4 x 380 mm) will be returned to the mill for grinding, while the overflow from 
the two stages will be combined and sent to the magnetic separation circuit for tantalum 
recovery.  

A pulp sampler installed on the combined overflow collects samples at regular interval for 
determining the head assays.  

A 30-tonne overhead crane will be used for mill maintenance. 

The ball mill sizing was based on the bond ball mill work index test.  Two-stage classification 
ensures that overgrinding of the liberated spodumene ore is minimum and helps minimize 
generation of slimes. 

TANTALUM RECOVERY 

The combined overflow from the two-stage cyclone clusters will be sent to a wet magnetic 
separation circuit to recover tantalum bearing minerals.  Tantalum concentrate will be 
recovered in two stages.  In the first stage, two 5.8 m L x 5.0 m W x 5.4 m H single drum wet 
magnetic separators operated at 5,000 Gauss will be used as roughers.  The non-magnetics from 
the roughers will be sent to the second stage magnetic separation that will use two 5.8 m L x 
5.0 m W x 5.4 m H single-drum magnetic separators operated at 15,000 Gauss as scavengers to 
recover the remaining magnetic tantalite minerals from that stream.  The magnetics 
concentrate from both roughers and scavengers will be combined and sent to the tantalite 
thickener, while the non-magnetics product will be further deslimed in a desliming cyclone 
cluster No.1.  The cyclone cluster ensures slimes removal before mica flotation.  The desliming 
cyclone cluster consists of four, 380 mm diameter cyclones.  

A pulp sampler installed on the magnetic product stream determines the tantalum concentrate 
grade.  

Flocculant FlominTM 905(MC) will be added to the thickener.  Tantalum concentrate from the 
thickener underflow will be sent to a vacuum disc filter.  A rotary dryer further removes the 
residual moisture down to 1% by weight.  The dried tantalum concentrate will be stored in a 
100-tonne silo and will be bagged in a 1-tonne big bag filling system and shipped.

The magnetic separators were sized using bench scale test work results.  The cyclones sizing 
was based on optimal slimes removal. 

MICA FLOTATION 

The desliming cyclone cluster underflow slurry will feed the conditioning tank by gravity, 
where reagents will be added for mica flotation. 

The conditioned slurry will be pumped from the conditioning tank into the dilution tank to 
reduce the pulp density prior to mica rougher flotation. 

The mica flotation circuit consists of a conditioning tank, 3.0 m diameter x 3.2 m high, equipped 
with 11.0 kW agitator and a dilution tank, 3.0 m diameter x 3.2 m high, equipped with 11.0 kW 
agitator.  Mica rougher flotation consists of five mechanical cells in series, 14.2 m3 each.  The 
rougher concentrate will be pumped to the mica cleaner flotation circuit consisting of two 
mechanical cells in series, 2.8 m3 each.  The mica cleaner concentrate will be pumped to the 
tailings thickener. 

In the mica flotation, undesired mica will be removed as flotation concentrate from the 
spodumene ore prior to spodumene flotation.  

The flotation circuit was designed based on the 5 kg spodumene concentrate production test 
results and other bench scale tests. 

DEWATERING, ATTRITION, AND DESLIMING 

The combined mica rougher tailings and cleaner tailings will be pumped to a dewatering 
cyclone cluster for increasing the percent solids of the underflow stream prior to attrition 
scrubbing.  The dewatering cyclone cluster No.1 consists of fourteen (14), 150 mm diameter 
cyclones.  

Attrition scrubbing is carried out to clean the mineral surfaces and remove slimes from the 
spodumene mineral surface.  The dewatering cyclone cluster No.1 underflow will discharge 
into the attrition circuit with four (4) attrition scrubber cells, 19.3 m3 each.  The attrition 
scrubber cells residence time was derived from the bench scale test work.  

The scrubber discharge will be further deslimed in a desliming cyclone No.2 cluster.  This 
cyclone cluster is required to ensure thickening before high density conditioning. The 
desliming cyclone cluster No.2 consists of twelve (12), 150 mm diameter cyclones.  

The cyclones sizing was based on optimal slime removal. 

SPODUMENE FLOTATION 

The spodumene flotation circuit is designed to produce good quality spodumene concentrate 
grading 6.0% Li2O or higher.  The flotation circuit was designed based on the metallurgical test 
work performed at SGS Lakefield. 

The desliming cyclone cluster No.2 underflow slurry will feed the high density spodumene 
conditioning tank #1 by gravity.  The high density conditioning is a requirement for optimal 
performance of spodumene flotation.

The conditioned slurry will be pumped to a dilution conditioning tank #2 where the slurry is 
diluted with process water to obtain the correct flotation pulp density for maximum 
performance in the spodumene rougher flotation cells.  The two high density spodumene 
conditioning tanks will be 4.1 m diameter x 4.3 m high, each equipped with a 22.4 kW agitator. 

Spodumene rougher flotation will consist of seven mechanical cells in series, 14.2 m3 each and 
the scavenger flotation consisting of four mechanical cells in series, 14.2 m3 each.  The 
spodumene cleaner flotation consists of two stages of cleaning.  The spodumene first cleaner 
flotation cells will consist of six mechanical cells in series, 2.8 m3 each, while the spodumene 
second cleaner flotation cells will be five mechanical cells in series, 2.8 m3 each.  The second 
cleaner concentrate will be pumped to the spodumene concentrate thickener.  The cleaner tails 
from both cleaners return to the attrition scrubber. 

A pulp sampler installed on the second cleaner concentrate will be used to assay the lithium 
content of the spodumene concentrate.  

The spodumene rougher tailings will be sent a dewatering cyclone cluster No.2 for increasing 
pulp density for high density conditioning prior to scavenger flotation.  The dewatering 
cyclone No.2 cluster consists of eighteen 150 mm diameter cyclones.  The cyclone underflow 
flows by gravity to a high-density conditioning, 4.1 m dia. x 4.3 m tank with a 22.4 kW agitator.  
The conditioned slurry is then pumped to another conditioning tank for diluting the slurry 
density prior to scavenger flotation.  The dilution tank will be 4.1 m dia. x 4.3 m tank with a 
22.4 kW agitator.  Scavenger flotation consists of four mechanical cells in series, each 14.2 m3.  
Scavenger concentrate will be pumped to the attrition scrubber, while the tailings will be 
pumped to the tailings thickener.  

A pulp sampler installed on the tailings line determines the lithium reporting to the tailings 
stream.  

A 5-tonne overhead crane installed in the flotation area will be used for the maintenance of all 
flotation equipment. 

SPODUMENE CONCENTRATE DEWATERING AND STORAGE 

The spodumene cleaner concentrate will be pumped to the 6.1 m diameter concentrate 
thickener.  The thickener overflow will be pumped to the process water tank for recirculation 
of process water, while the concentrate thickener underflow at 65% solids will be pumped to 
spodumene concentrate holding tank 7.0 m diameter x 8.0 m high.  The solids will be kept in 
suspension with a 45 kW agitator.  From the holding tank the concentrate will be pumped to 
the concentrate vacuum disc filter (4'.0 dia. x 3 discs). The filtrate will be re-circulated to the 
spodumene concentrate thickener by a filtrate pump. 

The high rate concentrate thickener was sized based on the results of sedimentation test work 
conducted at SGS. FlominTM 905(MC) will be added to the thickener as the flocculant.  The 
vacuum disc filter was sized by filtration test work results as well. 

The filter cake at 14% moisture will be dried in a rotary dryer (1.8 m dia. x 10.7 m long) and 
stored in a 1,500-tonne capacity spodumene concentrate storage silo before being transported 
by trucks.

TAILINGS DEWATERING AND STORAGE 

Various streams from the plant, including mica concentrate from mica flotation, overflows 
from desliming cyclone clusters, and dewatering cyclone clusters, scavenger tailings from 
spodumene flotation circuit will be directed to the 19.8 m diameter thickener.  The high-rate 
tailings thickener size was selected based on dynamic settling tests.  FlominTM 905(MC) will be 
the flocculant that will be added to the tailings thickener. 

The thickener overflow will be pumped to the process water tank, while the tailings thickener 
underflow at 60% solids will be pumped to the tailings holding tank 12.0 m diameter × 14.0 m 
high agitated with a 112 kW agitator. 

From the holding tank, the tailings will be pumped to the tailings disc filter (6'.0 dia. x 5 discs).  
The disc filter was sized based on filtration tests results.  The filtrate will be re-circulated to the 
tailings thickener by a filtrate pump.  

The filter cake at 15% moisture will be stored in a truck loading hopper.  Mine haul trucks will 
be used to transport the tailings to the waste rock facility. 

17.1.5 SPODUMENE PLANT – UTILITIES 

CONCENTRATOR WATER SERVICES 

The water consumption is based on concentrator plant nominal water consumption per hour. 

1 Fresh (Raw) Water 

Water wells will be the main water source of fresh water to the concentrator.  The fresh water 
will be stored in a 6 m diameter × 7 m high water tank.  

Fresh water from the wells was not tested during metallurgical test work. 

2 Process Water 

Reclaim water will be recycled back, at a nominal rate of 1,045 m3/h, from the tailings thickener 
and concentrate thickeners.  The process water tank will be stored in a 12 m diameter × 14 m 
tank.  

The effect of process water on flotation was not tested during metallurgical test work. 

3 Gland Water 

The gland water system has a separate 5.0 m diameter by 6.0 m high gland water tank, which 
will also be used for reagents preparation. A special water filtration produces filtered water for 
gland seal and reagent preparation.  

CONCENTRATOR COMPRESSED AIR 

1 High-Pressure Air 

The plant will have two (2) air compressors.  An air dryer and receiver tank will be used for 
instrument air only.  One compressor is on standby. 

2 Low-Pressure Air 

The flotation cells will receive low-pressure air about 4.0 Psig from two (2) air blowers.  One 
blower is on standby.

 WASTE ROCK AND DRY TAILINGS CO-DEPOSIT PILE 
A combined waste and dry tailings co-deposit is proposed.  The total capacity of the pile is 107M 
m³, which is sufficient to contain the waste rock and the dry tailing, including a toe berm for 
the dry tailing pile.  The volume was assessed based on the optimized pit shell.  

The pile design was completed in accordance with Québec government's Directive 019 related to 
the mining industry.  It is understood that materials used for the stockpile are considered as 'low-
risk mining waste'.  No waterproofing measure is expected for the ground water protection.  In 
addition, no accumulation on surfaces is located less than 20 m from nearby watercourses. 

The co-deposit pile has an approximate capacity of 182 MT (91M m³) for mine waste and 24 MT 
(16 M m³) for the dry tailings.  Two distinct zones are identified for stockpiling waste material, 
thus reducing the water management infrastructure required in the first years. The detailed co-
deposition plan will be implemented during the operations.  Figure 18.2 shows the section view 
of the waste rock and dry tailings co-deposit pile. 

The particle size of waste materials was determined using information provided by InnovExplo. 

The waste section covers the dry tailing piles in accordance with the following design criteria:  
— First bench slope 2H: 1V; 
— First bench maximum height: 20 m; 
— First bench maximum width: 40 m; 
— Subsequent bench slopes 1.5H: 1V; 
— Maximum subsequent bench offsets: 10 m; 
— Maximum subsequent bench heights: 10 m; 
— Overall slope of the dump: 2.5H: 1V; 
— Maximum number of benches: 10.  

Both zones (Phase 1 and Phase 2) have sufficient clearance from other infrastructures to allow 
for an extension, if necessary.  

The same design criteria and geometry that were proposed by Amec Foster Wheeler 
(TX16017703-01000-RGE-0001-0, 2017) were used to define the dry tailings piles within the co-
deposit pile.  Additional stability analyses were undertaken by WSP to reflect the co-disposal 
concept and possible filling sequence. 

Soil parameters from geotechnical data collected from four test wells (T-25, T-26, T71, and T-75) and 
surface deposit maps were used in the design.  The proposed design respects all required regulations. 

The dry tailings pile will be placed on the cleared and stripped natural soil.  Waste sections will 
be placed on the cleared, but not stripped, natural soil to allow an effective management of 
sediments when work is completed.  

The subsoil (natural soil) of the pile is assumed to be made of materials with variable grain size 
and property ranging from silty sand to coarse sand with rocks, such as defined by samplings 
collected under the supervision of WSP.  

A service road will be built around the waste rock pile to allow for maintenance of the ditches, 
the ponds, and the pumps.  No service road is added on the north side of the pile since no 
infrastructure that requires maintenance is located on this side of the pile.

18.1.1 PROPOSED FILLING SEQUENCE 

The filling sequence is proposed to reduce the run-off water management requirements 
throughout the life of the mine.  For Years 2 to 4 (Phase 1), only the south-west section of the 
co-deposit will be used.  Doing so, Ponds 2 and 3 will not be required at construction.  Since the 
waste stockpile toe limit will remain within the catchment area of the final peripheral ditch, no 
temporary ditches will be required.  At no time will the run-off water be in contact with the 
stockpile flow without being caught through ditches and treated at the Equalization Pond.  

A second phase is proposed covering Years 5 to 17.  Prior to this phase, peripheral ditches will 
be dug so the whole catchment area of Pond 2 and Pond 3 is directed towards those two ponds.  
Since the co-deposit pile toe limit will remain within the catchment area of Pond 2, no ditches 
will be built on the north side of the co-deposit pile.  At no time will the run-off water be in 
contact with the stockpile flow without being caught through ditches and treated at the 
Equalization Pond. 

A detailed sequence of filling should be developed in detailed engineering. 

18.1.2 RUN-OFF WATER MANAGEMENT 

Run-off water coming from the waste rock pile will be directed in the surrounding ditches.  It is 
assumed that the north side of the pile does not require ditches, since the co-deposit toe limit 
will remain within the catching area of the final peripheral ditch.  The ditches will collect run-
off water and bring it towards three ponds (Pond 2, Pond 3, and the Equalization Pond).  Run-
off water will then be pumped into the retention pond for characterization and processing 
before being discharged into the effluent.  

Ditch design flows were calculated according to the rational method.  The overburden stockpile 
was divided into three sub-catchment areas.  For each catchment area, a 100-year rainfall, with 
a duration equal to the time of concentration of the catchment area, was considered to 
determine the design flow.  

A run-off coefficient (Cp) of 0.5 was selected for the waste pile surfaces.  A Cp of 1 was 
considered for the dry tailings pile surfaces.  The Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves of 
Station A, La Grande Rivière, were used.  The water velocity and height in the ditches were 
determined using the Manning's equation.  

This Cp of 0.5 was considered conservative for predominantly coarse soil in mountain areas, 
such as defined in the culvert design manual of the ministère des Transports du Québec.  The 
Cp of 1.0 for the dry tailings is also considered conservative. 

The depth of the specified ditches is appropriate to maintain at least a gross freeboard of 1 m 
while keeping a maximum flow velocity below 3 m/s.  To protect ditches against erosion, 
broken stones of 0-400 mm in size are expected on the walls and the bottom of the ditches.  A 
Manning's coefficient of 0.036 was selected for the ditch protection. 

Three ponds are also expected in order to hold a 24-hour duration, 100-year flood (3.45 mm/h) 
in addition to snow melting over a period of 30 days (0.4 mm/h).  These ponds have a minimum 
freeboard of 1 m.  Pumping is evaluated to collect water, but neglected for drainage.  Rainfall 
over the pond was also considered.   Table 18.1 presents surface water management ponds 
required and designed volumes.

Discharge flow rates of water were determined so that rainfalls of 25 mm (90% of rainfalls are 
below 20 mm) are discharged within 72 hours. 

According to rainfall statistics from Environment Canada, La Grande Rivière Station A, there 
are 27.3 days with rainfall over 5 mm during the months of April to October (210 days), or a 
significant rainfall per 8 days.  This 72-hour delay appears to be adequate and safe to drain the 
pond.  The additional volume is considered to reduce pumping requirements. 

 ORE STOCKPILE PAD 
An ore pad with an approximate capacity of 3,900,000 T (1.6M m³) is expected to hold the ore 
stockpile.  

The design of the ore pad complies with Directive 019 related to the mining industry.  It is 
understood that materials used for the ore pad are considered as 'low risk mining waste'.  No 
waterproofing measure is expected for the ground water protection.  

The following design criteria were selected.  These criteria were validated with the 
Geotechnical Stability Analysis of overburden stockpile prepared by WSP in 2017.  Since native 
soil in both the waste stockpile area and the ore stockpile area are the same, applying the same 
design criteria is safe since the ore pile height is significantly lower than the waste pile. 

— Slope for each level: 1.5H :1V; 
— Maximum  bench height: 10 m; 
— Maximum  bench offset: 10 m; 
— Maximum number of benches: 4. 

The proposed ore pad will be placed on a surface cleared, stripped, and levelled with waste 
materials.  All stored material will be processed at the plant at the end of the Project. 

The subsoil (natural soil) of the pile is assumed to be made of materials with variable grain size 
and property ranging from silty sand to coarse sand with rocks, such as defined by samples 
collected under the supervision of WSP.  

18.2.1 RUN-OFF WATER MANAGEMENT 

Run-off water coming from the ore pad will be directed in the surrounding ditches and 
redirected towards the Equalization Pond using gravity.

Ditch design flows were calculated according to the rational method.  A 100-year rainfall, with a 
duration equal to the pond concentration-time, was considered to determine design flows.  A 
Cp of 0.6 was selected for the design of these works.  The Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves 
of Station A, La Grande Rivière, were used.  The water speed and height in ditches were 
determined using the Manning's equation.  

This Cp of 0.6 was considered conservative for predominantly coarse soil in mountain areas, 
such as defined in the culvert design manual of the ministère des Transports du Québec.  

The depth of the specified ditches is appropriate to maintain at least a gross freeboard of 1 m 
while keeping a maximum flow velocity below 3 m/s.  To protect ditches against erosion, 
broken stones made of 0-400 mm stones are expected on the walls and the bottom of the 
ditches.  A Manning's coefficient of 0.036 was selected for the ditch protection. 

The Equalization Pond will have to contain a 100-year rainfall during 24 hours (3.45 mm/h) in 
addition to snow melting for a period of 30 days (0.4 mm/h) on the ore pad surface.  This 
volume represents 5,530 m3.  

Figure 18.3 shows the surface water management calculated flows for the waste & dry tailing 
stockpile, industrial pad and ore stockpile going to the equalization pond and final effluent 
treatment plant.

 INDUSTRIAL PAD 
A 296,175 m² industrial pad, over which most of the industrial infrastructures are located, is 
included in the Project.  This proposed industrial pad is on two levels in order to match the 
natural ground. 

The industrial pad is built over the natural soil which is cleared and stripped of organic 
materials.  The organic materials will be stocked in a distinct pile in order to be used when the 
site is restored.  

The subsoil (natural soil) of the pad is assumed to be made of materials with variable grain size 
and property ranging from silty sand to coarse sand with rocks, such as defined by samplings 
collected under the supervision of WSP.  

Embankments, up to 1.1 m below the finished ground, are made with materials coming from 
Class-2 excavated materials or raw muck.  The last 1.1 m is filled with crushed material from 
the pit's waste material.  

Materials used for the industrial pad are considered as 'low-risk mining waste'.  No 
waterproofing measure is expected for the underground water protection.  

Figure 18.4 shows the industrial pad detailed layout and Figure 18.5 shows the industrial pad 
cross-section.

18.3.1 RUN-OFF WATER MANAGEMENT 

Run-off water coming from the industrial pad will be directed in the surrounding ditches and 
redirected towards the balancing pond using gravity. 

Ditch design flows were calculated according to the rational method.  A 100-year rainfall, with a 
length equal to the pond concentration-time, was considered to determine design flows.  A Cp 
of 0.65 was selected for the design of these works.  The Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves of 
Station A, La Grande Rivière, were used.  The water speed and height in ditches were 
determined using the Manning's equation. 

This Cp of 0.65 was considered conservative for predominantly coarse soil in mountain areas, 
such as defined in the culvert design manual of the ministère des Transports du Québec.  

The depth of the specified ditches is appropriate to maintain at least a gross freeboard of 1 m 
while keeping a maximum flow velocity below 2.5 m/s.  To protect ditches against erosion, 
broken stones made of 0-400 mm stones are expected on the walls and the bottom of the 
ditches. A Manning's coefficient of 0.036 was selected for the ditch protection. 

The Equalization Pond will have to contain a 100-year rainfall during 24 hours (3.45 mm/h) in 
addition to snow melting for a period of 30 days (0.4 mm/h) on the industrial pad surface. This 
volume represents 17,727 m3.

Piping is designed to comply with the following standard: BNQ 1809-300 – Construction Work - 
General Technical Specifications - Drinking Water and Sewer Lines.  The freezing depth, which is 
considered, is such as described in Table 2 of standard BNQ 1809-300.  For the municipality of 
Chapais, it is 3.51 m.  To reduce excavation and to allow easier maintenance, a minimum burial of 
2.1 m is expected.  To prevent pipes from freezing, sheets of isolating material (100 mm) will be 
installed to increase protection against freezing at the required level.  Isolation material will be 
placed in a reversed 'U' shape. 

For productivity reasons during the installation, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) conducts 
are recommended. 

These conducts will be installed in trenches and backfilled in accordance with the cross-section 
and alignment shown on drawings.

The roads are settled on the natural soil which is cleared and stripped from organic materials.  
The organic materials will be stocked in a distinct pile in order to be used when the site is 
restored.  

The subsoil (natural soil) of the roads is assumed to be made of materials with variable grain 
size and property ranging from silty sand to coarse sand with rocks, such as defined by 
samplings collected under the supervision of the geotechnical engineer.  

Embankments, up to the infrastructure line, are made with materials coming from natural soil 
Class-2 excavated materials.  Materials used over the infrastructure line will be made of 
crushed pit waste to a 0-200 mm calibre. 

Materials used for the industrial pad are considered as 'low-risk mining waste'.  No 
waterproofing measure is expected for the underground water protection.

18.4.1 RUN-OFF WATER MANAGEMENT 

Run-off coming from roads will be directed in the lateral ditches and redirected without being 
processed in the surrounding watercourses using gravity. 

Galvanized corrugated steel culverts installed in compliance with the Guide d'aménagement des 
ponts et ponceaux dans le milieu forestier are required to direct water towards the effluent and 
ensure an adequate drainage of the road. 

 OVERBURDEN STOCKPILE 
An overburden stockpile with a capacity of 11,310,000 T (6.0M m³) is expected to contain 
materials coming from the pit excavation required to reach bedrock.   

Test pits T-65 to T-69 indicated that the overburden stockpile would be made of coarse-grained 
soil (sand with gravel, stones, and erratic blocks).  Organic materials (topsoil) will be disposed 
of in a distinct stockpile so they are used for rehabilitation work.  This temporary organic 
material stockpile will be located within the footprint of the proposed waste stockpile.  

The overburden stockpile design will be produced in accordance with Directive 019 related to 
the mining industry.  It is expected that materials used for the overburden stockpile will be 
considered as 'low risk tailings'.  No specific measures to protect ground water, such as a 
membrane, is expected.  In addition, the stockpile will be located at least 60 m from the 
surrounding watercourses. 

The following design criteria were selected.  These criteria were validated with Geotechnical 
Stability Analysis Co-disposal of tailings and waste rock performed by WSP (2017) and based on 
geotechnical data collected from four test wells (T-71 to T-74).   However, a slope of 3H: 1V, 
instead of the calculated 2.5H: 1V was used to ease revegetation. 

— Slope for each level: 3 H :1V; 
— Height of benches: 10 m; 
— Space between benches: 10 m; 
— Maximum number of benches: 3. 

The proposed overburden stockpile will be placed on the cleared, but not stripped, natural soil 
to allow an effective management of sediment.  Figure 18.7 shows the overburden stockpile 
section (east-west axis).

18.5.1 STORM WATER MANAGEMENT 

Storm water coming from the overburden stockpile will be directed towards surrounding areas 
through natural water run-off patterns.  No ditches will be dug in the surroundings of the pile.  
During operation, the top of the piles will be levelled so the water flow is split throughout the whole 
surface of the overburden stockpile to avoid significant changes in the natural flow pattern.  

 PADS FOR OTHER INFRASTRUCTURES 
Pads used for other buildings are settled over the natural soil which is cleared and stripped of 
organic materials.  The organic materials will be stocked in a distinct pile in order to be used 
when the site is rehabilitated. 

The subsoil (natural soil) of all pads is assumed to be made of materials with variable grain size 
and property ranging from silty sand to coarse sand with rocks, such as defined by samples 
collected under the supervision of WSP.  

Embankments, up to 1.1 m below the finished ground, are made with materials coming from 
Class-2 excavated materials or raw muck.  The last 1.1 m is filled with crushed material coming 
from the pit's waste material.  

Materials used for the industrial pad are considered as 'low-risk mining waste'.  No 
waterproofing measure is expected for the ground water protection. 

 LIQUID NATURAL GAS STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION 
LNG storage and distribution will be required on site for the carbonation plant kiln.  Since this 
infrastructure is required, it was decided that it would be used at the beginning of the Project 
for the heating of the buildings and for the drying of the concentrates.  The LNG will be 
delivered by truck by Gaz Metro from their Montreal-Est terminal or future Bécancour 
terminal.  The storage and distribution system will be installed on the industrial pad. 

Before construction of the carbonation plant, only one 330 m³ double-wall reservoir will be 
needed.  A secure procedure will have to be developed to allow bottom filling while operating. 

The LNG system will also include the following items: 
— Electric vaporizers (one per reservoir and one spare); 
— Pumps for LNG transfer to vaporizers; 
— A flare for emergency release; 
— A compressor to return gas to the system; 
— A Mercaptan gas odorization system; 
— A nitrogen tank for LNG system flush; 
— LNG stainless steel piping and valves; 
— A fire protection and leak detection system with strobe and buzzer; and 
— An emergency leakage retention basin and trench. 

Figure 18.8 presents the LNG flowsheet and Figure 18.9 the LNG storage and distribution layout.

18.7.1 LNG INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS 

The capacity of the retention pond must be 110% of the biggest tank, (363 m³ in this case).  The 
emergency retention pond, its canal and containment area under the ponds must possess an 
electrical heat tracing system to melt the snow made of reinforced concrete and resistant to 
temperatures of -160°C. 

A pump will draw the water out of the pond to prevent water from occupying all the space 
available in the pond.  If there is an issue with the LNG and the pond fills, there has to be as 
little water as possible inside it.  The pump will be stopped by two switches.  The canal will 
consist in a slope of 3% so that LNG flows under gravity, from the tanks towards the retention 
pond for the canal.  The LNG delivery path has been designed to prevent the trucks to travel in 
reverse direction 

The production, storage, and handling of LNG are regulated by the CSA Z276-15 standard 
(Liquefied natural gas (LNG) - Production, storage, and handling).  In Québec, the standard has 
been integrated into the Building Act, more precisely the Construction Code and the Safety 
Code Article 2.01.  According to applicable standard, the following distances were considered 
for the LNG layout design: 

— Distance between the retention pond and the diesel tank: 20 m; 
— Distance between the areas where personnel is often present: 20 m; 
— Distance between process equipment and any source of ignition: 15 m; 
— Distance between each piece of process equipment: 15 m; 
— Distance between the compressor and any source of ignition: 4.5 m; 
— Distance between each LNG tank: 2 m; and 
— Distance between the LNG tank and the diesel or gasoline tanks: 6 m.

 DIESEL AND GASOLINE STORAGE 
The diesel and gasoline storage and distribution system will also be installed on the industrial 
pad.  In order to reduce the equipment required on site, it is planned that a diesel tanker truck 
will directly fill the mobile and mining fleet.  This tanker truck will be operated by a company 
having installations in the area, such as Petronor with their Eastmain fuel depot. 

A 45,000 litre double-wall tank with a low flow delivery system (gas boy) for diesel will be 
installed on site for the supply of vehicles.  A concrete slab will be erected in the delivery area 
to ease leak recuperation. 

A 10,000 litre double-wall tank and delivery system for gasoline will be installed near the diesel 
tank for the supply of vehicles.  Both systems will share the same concrete slab.   

Figure 18.10 shows the diesel and gasoline layout.

 TRUCKSHOP AND WAREHOUSE 
The truckshop, wash bay, and warehouse will be installed side by side on the industrial pad.  
They will be structural steel arch-type fabric buildings which use sea containers as foundation, 
all mounted on a concrete slab and equipped with HVAC systems, lighting, and services.  
Containers will be designed to provide offices, restrooms, and storage area.  

The truckshop will offer four repair bays, a lube unit room, a tool crib, and offices and will be 
equipped with an overhead crane.  The wash bay will be a dedicated building considering its 
special needs in terms of HVAC and water supply. 

All truckshop buildings will have pits connected to an oil separator used to collect oil and 
lubricant transported by washouts.  The oil separator installation will be preceded by a sand 
trap.  The oil separator will be designed to process an estimated flow of 150 US gpm while 
respecting the hydrocarbon C10-C50 discharge standard of 15 ppm in the garage's industrial 
sewer system.  Oil recovered in the oil separator will be periodically transferred into a waste oil 
storage tank before being disposed of at an authorized site.  

The warehouse will have a storage capacity of 750 m² and will also contain a small truck repair 
bay and a welding bay.  The container foundation will allow extra storage area and specialized 
shops. 

There will also be a smaller heated fabric building to park the emergency vehicle (not mounted 
on containers).   

Figure 18.11 shows the truckshop and warehouse layout.

 ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING AND GATEHOUSE 
The administrative building is planned to be a two-storey modular construction mounted on 
wood blocks with a skirt to allow heating of the piping installed underneath.  The 26 modules 
connected together include offices, restrooms, an infirmary, a mine rescue meeting room, a dry 
area, a lunch room, and two conference rooms. Modular construction allows for a faster 
installation on site, thus reducing costs and construction crew lodging requirements.  The dry 
area will include 340 lockers and 63 baskets for men, and 36 lockers and 36 hooks for women.  

Figure 18.12 shows the administrative building layout. 

The gatehouse will be an independent module also mounted on wood blocks.  This module will 
include a desk with screens for the security cameras and process monitoring, a main fire alarm 
panel and a restroom.  A parking lot (capacity of 48) is planned for visitors and staff, 
considering most of the employees will commute by bus from the camp.  A 80,000-tonne truck 
scale will be installed near the gatehouse with a remote monitoring system to keep a record of 
weightings.   

Figure 18.13 shows the gatehouse layout.

 MAIN ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION AND DISTRIBUTION 

A 315 kV electrical transmission line (L3176), owned by Hydro-Québec, runs north-south over 
the eastern side of the Project.  The transmission line will need to be relocated approximately 
500 m east of the mining pit.  The relocation project is being discussed with Hydro-Québec and 
the draft design study is underway. 

The power demand for the Project has been estimated at about 13,486 kW (15,615 kVA) and a 
reserve of up to 20 MVA has been accepted by Hydro-Québec. 

To meet the anticipated electrical power needs of the Project, the installation of two 15 MVA 
(20 MVA with one ventilation stage) electrical transformers (315 to 25 kV) feeding off Hydro-
Québec's 315 kV main power line is proposed.  The two 15 MW transformers will operate at the 
same time to feed the site and the process plant.  A sole 15 MW transformer will be able to 
withstand all loads in case of failure of one of the two transformers.  Each transformer will be 
protected by a circuit breaker fitted with isolating switches located upstream and downstream 
of the transformers.  A 315 kV measuring device will be installed upstream of each transformer 
and the readings from both transformers will be combined.  Hydro-Québec needs a differential 
protection and communication between the new protection relays and their existing 
installations to coordinate the protection.   

Figure 18.14 shows the electrical distribution on site. 

The transformers will feed a 25 kV structure equipped with two series of four 25 kV exterior 
breakers connected with a tie circuit breaker to ensure continuous supply in the event of a 
breakdown of either of the two main transformers.  Two banks of capacitors will be installed to 
correct the power factor.  Three 25 kV transmission lines will be installed on site: one dedicated 
to the process plant and the other two to the supply of the rest of the site.  Various 
transformers will be installed to supply 4.16 kV or 600 V to the buildings and equipment 
according to the power requirements of that sector.  A substation will be installed near the 
mining pit to supply the electrical mining equipment and the pumping stations around the pit.   

Figure 18.15 shows the main power station layout.

 COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
The main network is composed of fibre optic cables connecting the various buildings together.  
These include the administrative building, the truckshop, the warehouse, the gatehouse, the 
process plant, the crushing plant, the explosive storage area, the blasting cap storage area, the 
water treatment plant, and various pumping stations.  

The fibre count will remain the same across the network.  That way, every subnetwork will be 
available from all locations.  This will be useful in the future if, for example, a camera is 
necessary in an area that was initially deemed unimportant.  The network will use 24-fibre 
cables.  Table 18.5 shows the fibre distribution.  

Table 18.5 Fibre Distribution 

Number of 
Fibres 

Description of Network 

6  Automation network (ring topology + 2 dedicated spares) 

4  Administrative network (internet, printers, file servers, etc.) 

2  Security camera network 

2  Fire alarm system 

8  Spare fibres 

 

While it would be possible to reduce the number of fibres, using a non-standard fibre count 
increases the cost. 

The network will be as linear as possible, meaning that a location will receive a cable from the 
previous location and send a cable to one other location.  There are some exceptions that 
cannot be avoided at this point, mostly at the pumping stations.  Usually, administrative 
networks are designed in a star configuration, but the site layout makes it difficult to do so 
without increasing the cost.  One option would be to use the spare fibres. 

Each location will include a network cabinet.  This cabinet will include fibre optics patch panels 
to receive the various networks and redistribute them to the next location, cat6 patch panels 
for the various end users (cameras, phones, computers, etc.), one or more switches depending 
on the needs at that specific location, and an uninterruptible power system (UPS) to maintain 
the network integrity in case of a power failure.  The UPS is particularly important for the 
security camera and the fire alarm system networks.  Some cabinets will be installed outside 
and will require necessary protection rating and heating system. 

The server room in the administrative building will include two general purpose servers to 
handle the files, printers, emails, user accounts, etc., and one special server for the voice over 
IP (VoIP) phone system.  A hardware firewall will also be used to protect the network from 
intrusions. 

The workers will mostly communicate using the phone system or portable radios.  Fifty radios 
and two repeater stations are included to cover most of the site.  Radios will also be installed in 
the cabin of heavy machinery.

The internet will be supplied by Telesignal, or another locally implanted supplier who uses 
fibre from Eeyou Communication Networks.  The mine will be connected to the network using 
microwave towers, which is simpler and less expensive than installing fibre along the road.  An 
existing tower already connected to the Eeyou network should be used as a base connection 
point, like at CCDC in Nemaska.  To complete the network, a new microwave emitter will be 
installed on the CCDC tower and two similar towers will be built:  one at the mine site and one 
at the camp.  The towers will be built and maintained by the supplier with a monthly based fee. 

This internet connection should be sufficient for voice over IP and general use (emails, 
browsing, etc.).  However, this is not a dedicated connection and, therefore, cannot be used for 
remote operations of trucks, for example.  This would require a different hardware 
configuration and a different package from the internet service supplier. 

 SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT 

18.13.1 PROCESS WATER SUPPLY 

The process water supply for the industrial pad buildings, including the process plant, the 
administrative building, and the truckshop, will be drawn from the first submersible pump 
installed in the de-watering wells around the open pit. 

18.13.2 POTABLE WATER SUPPLY 

Some of the water pumped to the industrial pad will be treated for potable water usage.  The 
planned treatment includes anionic exchanger, activated carbon filter and UV sterilization.  
The final treatment system will have to be optimized according to underground quality water.  
Water bottles will also be supplied in various buildings for drinking. 

18.13.3 SEWAGE 

The selection criteria for a domestic wastewater treatment technology mostly depends on the 
natural soil conditions and on the presence of waterbodies.  Natural soils at the industrial site 
seem to be favourable for a soil infiltration technology while available areas could allow the 
compliance with the minimum distance of 200 m from waterbodies.  

A conventional leach field (modified element) is planned, but a geotechnical survey is needed 
to confirm soil quality and performance.  This option represents the lowest cost for installation 
and maintenance, but requires a larger footprint.   

Figure 18.16 shows the calculated flows for the water consumption and sewage for the 
industrial pad.

18.13.4 RUN-OFF WATER MANAGEMENT 

The run-off water management network includes the underground and surface water.  The 
construction of the water management network has been divided in phases to follow mine 
development and reduce initial costs.  Phase 1 starts at pre-production, Phase 2 starts at Year 3, 
and Phase 3 starts at Year 5.  The water management Process Flow Diagrams 8000-D-0101

In order to lower the ground water level, submersible pumps will be installed in 250 m deep 
boreholes.  During Phase 1, one pit peripheral well dewatering pump will be installed near the 
open pit main ramp.  During the subsequent years, and over the LOM, eight additional 
submersible pumps will be installed and spread out around the open pit.  Four pit peripheral 
well dewatering pumps will be installed during Phase 2, and four will be installed during 
Phase 3.  The dewatering water will be directed to Lake 3 and Lake 7 and also to the Industrial 
Pad for daily operational fresh water requirements.  Both submersible pump quantities and 
water release destinations will have to be confirmed by a complete hydrogeology study.  The 
submersible pumps for the pit dewatering will be installed in containers (one pump per 
container) and be operated 12 months per year.  

Open pit dewatering is considered and discussed in Section 16.

COMBINED WASTE AND TAILINGS STOCKPILE PONDS 

The collected run-off water from the waste stockpile will be handled through submersible 
pumps installed on floating barges.  The submersible pump and barge arrangement will be 
floating on the pond.  These submersible pumps will be operated three seasons a year.  During 
downtime (winter), the submersible pumps will be removed and stored and the pipeline will be 
drained.  The water collected in the waste stockpile ponds will be redirected to the Equalization 
Pond.  Waste Stockpiles #2 and #3 will be installed during Phase 2.  

EQUALIZATION POND 

The water in the Equalization Pond will be coming from the surface and the open pit 
dewatering.  From the Equalization Pond, the water will be pumped with centrifugal pumps to 
the final effluent water treatment plant.  The centrifugal pumps for the water management at 
the Equalization Pond will be installed in a container.  This container will be installed on the 
shore of the Equalization Pond.  The pumps will be operated 12 months per year.  Pumps #1 and 
#2 of the Equalization Pond will be installed during Phase 1, while Pump #3 will be installed 
during Phase 2. 

FINAL EFFLUENT TREATMENT PLANT 

The final effluent treatment plant will be installed next to the Equalization Pond, on a concrete 
slab inside a fold-away or prefabricated wall panel building (1,200 m²).  The capacity for Phase 1 
will be 500 m³/h and will be upgraded to 920 m³/h in Phase 2.  

The design criteria were based on the requirements of the Minister of Fisheries and 

Oceans Canada Metal Mining Effluent Regulations (MMER 2017).  Further studies on water to be 
treated will be required to optimize the design.  The proposed plant presents three treatment 
steps to achieve effluent requirements, which include different reagents (hydrated lime, 
coagulant, polymer, microsand, and sulphuric acid):  

3 Metal precipitation and sludge recirculation; 
4 High rate clarifier; and 
5 pH correction. 

Reagents will be used in different steps. 

The system will be automated and controlled by a PLC.  Effluent water quality monitoring and 
alarming will include pH and turbidity before reaching Stream A through a ditch.

18.14.2 SPODUMENE PLANT WATER MANAGEMENT 

Most of the water required for the spodumene plant will be recycled from the three thickeners.  
Fresh water will be required for make-up water for process, pumps gland seal water system, 
and reagents preparation.  Fresh water will also be required to fill the fire protection tank at 
the beginning of the operation and for the potable water system. 

18.14.3 SPODUMENE PLANT POWER SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION 

Power demand for the Spodumene process plant was estimated at 8.55 MW.  The estimation 
was based on data from the mechanical equipment list prepared for the Project, on the 
connected load, running load and load factors.  A breakdown by area is presented in Table 18.6.

The electrical installation prepared for the spodumene plant is presented on the single line 
diagram (Appendix 18-B).  

The spodumene process plant will be powered from the main substation 315/25 kV.  The power 
will be transported to the spodumene plant through a 25 kV overhead power line from this 
substation to an outdoor 12/15 MVA oil filled transformer.  

The transformer will stepped down the voltage from 25 kV to 4.16 kV.  Using a 5kV switchgear 
installed in the spodumene process plant main substation (E-House-001), this voltage will be 
used as a distribution voltage to feed the other six (6) prefabricated substations.  The 
prefabricated substations (E-House-003; E-House-004; E-House-005; E-House-006, and E-House-
007) will be 4.16 kV supplied with buried cable from the E-House-001 to the concentrator 
building and then in cable trays.  The cable supplying the crusher buildings (E-House-003) will 
be partially installed on the conveyor. 

All the electrical equipment will be installed in the prefabricated substation including dry type 
transformers 4.16/0.6 kV to step-down the voltage to 600 V to feed the low-voltage loads.

EMERGENCY POWER 

A 500 kVA emergency diesel generator will be provided as a standby source of power and 
installed in an outdoor prefabricated building to feed the critical loads at 600 V.  It will mainly 
feed fire-fighting pump, communication and control equipment, thickeners racks and lighting. 

MOTORS AND STARTING METHODS 

All the LV motors will be Totally Enclosed, Fan Cooled (TEFC) induction motors.  The starting 
methods retained are:  

— Direct-on-line (DOL) starting used for all low voltage motors below 100 HP with fixed speed 
applications,  

— Soft-Start (SS) starting used for all low-voltage motors over 100 HP with fixed speed 
applications; 

— Variable Frequency Drives (VFD) for variable speed applications. 

The ball-mill drive motor will be a 4.16 kV wound rotor induction motor started with an 
electrolytic starter (LRS).  The auxiliary motors will be 600V. 

SYSTEM GROUNDING 

The neutral of the main spodumene process plant transformer 25/4.16 kV will be grounded 
through a resistance to limit damage due to arcing faults and provide a better protection to 
personnel and equipment.  

The distribution transformers 4.16 kV/600 V will have a neutral directly grounded.  

The grounding system will consist mainly of a network of copper conductors, provided for each 
process building and substation, and will be buried externally around each building with taps 
thermo-welded to every other column.  The individual ground grids (substations, crushing 
building) will be tied together with interconnecting ground cables. 

CABLES AND TRAYS 

The power cables will consist of three conductors (a single conductor when needed) 1000 and 
5000 V, copper, XLPE insulated, aluminium armour, PVC sheathed 90°C.

18.14.4 SPODUMENE PLANT CONTROL SYSTEM 

CONTROL SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY 

Following industry practice for similar size plants, all process equipment installed in the 
concentrator and crushing buildings, as well as the electrical prefabricated substations, are 
controlled and supervised from a central control room equipped with a Supervisory Control 
and Data Acquisition (SCADA) control system and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) system 
located in the ore processing plant.  This architecture was selected for the plant-wide process 
control system (Appendix 18-C - DWG # C20203-08-DG-001).  It is a reliable and low-cost 
approach.  

Five process Human Machine Interface (HMI) stations will be installed throughout the plant 
and will be located in the following areas: crusher, grinding, flotation, dewatering, and drying. 

For redundancy, in the control room, the SCADA system will include two SCADA servers, two 
SCADA operator stations, and one engineering station.  

Integrated control systems solution to the major equipment will be privileged.  Mostly all the 
major equipment will be provided with their own control PLC which will locally control 
start/stop sequences, operation parameters, and alarms of the equipment.  

The plant process control system's PLC will act as a master controller and will control and 
coordinate the operations of the major equipment with other equipment of the process.  
Operation and alarm data will also be collected and archived.  Where vendor packaged process 
control systems are not available, logic will be developed at plant PLC level for process control 
and monitoring.  

FIBRE OPTIC NETWORK 

A fibre optic ring type topology configuration will be implemented for the process control 
system and the Ethernet backbone network will be used throughout the plant.  In ring 
topology, all the nodes are connected to each other in such a way that they make a closed loop.  
Each node is connected to two other components on either side, and it communicates with 
these two adjacent neighbours.  This topology will insure a second route to transfer the data to 
the control room in case of a communication outage on one segment (Appendix 18-C- DWG # 
C20203-08-DG-002). 

The fibre optic ring will link all the main areas of the plant such as SCADA, HMI, remote I/O 
cabinets, E-Houses, laboratory, and concentrator offices.  It will also be used to connect the IP 
phone system, the camera and security video system, and the fire detection system.  The 
different systems will use different fibres from the same cable.

— Footings: 30 MPa; 

— Pilasters: 30 Mpa; 

— Walls: 30 Mpa; 

— Equipment bases: 30 Mpa; 

— Lean concrete: 15 Mpa; 

— Reinforcement steel: 400 Mpa; 

— Anchor bolts: ASTM A325; and 

— Formwork: Wood and Steel. 

CRUSHING PLANT 

The industrial steel structure of the primary crushing building is composed of heavy steel 
sections to support the following: crusher, equipment laydown, rock breaker support, ore 
hopper support, feeders, and overhead bridge crane.  Each floor is comprised of a steel beam 
framing supporting a steel deck and concrete floor.  The truck discharge level consists of a 
slab-on-grade for a section, and steel grating platform for the other region.  

The general arrangement used to complete the estimate was the structure supported at the 
rock level with minimal drilling and blasting for outgoing conveyors trench.  This is a 
conservative assumption, and it is recommended in the detailed design to optimize the layout 
with geotechnical and hydrogeological studies.  The actual design includes a concrete wall and 
structure bracing the wall.  There is a Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) wall outside of the 
primary crusher structure that has been estimated to retain the fill and allow a horizontal slope 
from the ramp. 

The secondary crusher building is comprised of a discharge conveyor level, crusher level, chute 
access platforms, conveyor access platforms, and a roof.  The discharge conveyor and crusher 
floor consists of steel beam framing supporting steel deck and concrete floor.  The tower 
support of the conveyor galleries have been modelled, including the steel tower and concrete 
foundations. 

Drilling and blasting will be necessary to cast the concrete structure of the tunnel supporting 
the reclaim conveyors and crushed ore stockpile above it. 

SPODUMENE PLANT AREA 

The tunnel going to the ball mill area will require drilling and blasting in order to install the 
conveyor coming out of the reclaim tunnel and going to the ball mill area. 

For the spodumene plant, engineered backfill is required for foundations and concrete slabs. 
For information, the concrete and structure models include: 

— Excavation and backfill;  

— Concrete raft and monuments for the ball mill;

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 

 SPODUMENE MARKET 
All information pertaining to current and future spodumene market has been compiled from publicly available 
information, publications issued by expert consultants, as well as an internal outlook for the supply of 
spodumene.    

19.1.1 SPODUMENE MARKET BACKGROUND 

Spodumene is a pyroxene mineral that is found, almost exclusively, in granite pegmatites.  It has a chemical 
composition of LiAlSi2O6 (Lithium Aluminum Silicate) but small amounts of sodium sometimes substitute for 
lithium.  Spodumene is typically found in lithium-rich pegmatites in association with other lithium minerals 
such as lepidolite, eucryptite, and petalite that normally contains a percentage of lithium oxide (Li2O).  It is a 
major feedstock for the lithium industry and accounts for approximately 45% of current lithium production.  
The alternative source of lithium production is from brines predominantly located in South America in the 
so-called Lithium Triangle of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina. 

In the market, there is a distinction between so-called chemical grade spodumene (CG) and technical grade 
spodumene (TG).  The differentiation goes mainly by the iron content. 

Whereas the conversion from spodumene to chemical compounds like lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) or lithium 
hydroxide (LiOH) is done exclusively from the chemical grade spodumene, the low iron technical grade 
spodumene can be directly applied.  

Chemical grade spodumene sold as a 5% to 6% Li2O concentrate is solely used in the conversion to lithium 
carbonate and lithium hydroxide.  These compounds are then used in the grease, construction materials, and 
many other industries often as other salts like lithium fluoride, lithium acetate or derivatives from lithium 
metal, the so-called lithium organic compounds.  The latter are used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, 
pharmaceutical intermediates, and other specialties.  Of major importance became the use of lithium in Li-ion, 
batteries.  Li2CO3 and LiOH are used to manufacture cathode materials as well as anodes and electrolytes.  

Today more than 60% of the chemical grade spodumene after conversion is used in the rechargeable battery 
sector as either lithium carbonate or hydroxide.  Li-ion is the leading technology in rechargeable batteries for 
the use in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and increasingly, energy storage systems (ESS).  Hence, 
spodumene is a critical feedstock for the rapidly growing demand of rechargeable batteries and plays a central 
role as the energy industry transitions from fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable sources. 

Figure 19.1 illustrates the spodumene market size in 2016, estimated by Roskill Information Services Limited 
(Roskill), an international marketing research group.

The lithium contained has a technical effect in and by its application in lowering melting points, enhancing 
thermal shock resistance, etc.  This is important in production of special heat resistant glass, fibreglass, glass 
ceramics, frits, steel casting, foundry auxiliaries like fluxes, etc. (i.e. in most cases the lithium cannot be easily 
reduced let alone abolished without negative effects). However, customers may use instead of spodumene 
lithium carbonate or in some cases, mainly ceramics use petalite or for some certain applications lepidolite. 
Petalite, unlike spodumene, does not expand when thermally heated, thus is can be used directly in the 
production of ceramics, where spodumene would lead to cracking of the products. 

Petalite and lepidolite (in the diagram included in the spodumene TG approx. 50,000 MT petalite and approx. 
90,000 MT lepidolite) though contain less lithium (around 4.0 – 4.5% Li2O) increasing production cost which 
need to be compensated by respective pricing.  The main petalite source is Bikita Mine in Zimbabwe, whilst 
lepidolite is more or less solely mined in China, Jiangxi Province.  80,000 MT of spodumene TG concentrate are 
supplied by Talison.  Talison also supplies a low 5% lithia grade technical grade spodumene at a reduced price 
level, which can be only used for glass fiber flux and tile bodies due to higher impurity levels. 

Most of the spodumene resources contain to some extend iron (Fe) and so far Talison's Greenbushes mine has 
been for most of the time the only large source of the technical grade spodumene to the glass ceramics and 
glass market as the mine has an area of low iron spodumene. 

19.1.2 SPODUMENE MARKET AND CURRENT DEMAND SITUATION 

The global lithium demand in 2016 was approximately 200,000 MT of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE), of 
which close to 50% was supplied directly or indirectly via spodumene concentrate.  The market can generally 
be split into four regions, namely China, Far East Asia, Europe, and the United States, as shown on Figure 19.2.

Figure 19.2 Lithium Consumption by Region 

 
Source:  Roskill 

China is the largest consumer of lithium, where it is consumed both in traditional markets and Li-ion battery 
applications.  In Japan and South Korea, the major use of lithium is for the production of materials such as 
cathodes and electrolytes for Li-ion batteries.  In Japan, Sony produced the first Li-ion rechargeable consumer 
batteries since the early 1990s.  With South Korea's Samsung, LG inter alia entering the consumer electronics 
market and producing in-house their own batteries for their mainly mobile devices also battery materials have 
followed and are produced in Korea.  Today, battery materials were and still are made either in-house or 
sourced from independent but often closely associated companies such as Sumitomo Metal Mining, Umicore, 
Nichia, L&F, Ube, Mitsubishi Chemicals, Foosung, and Morita Chemical. 

In order to reduce material cost for Li-ion batteries, Japanese and South Korean consumer electronic companies 
started manufacturing Li-ion batteries (Panasonic, ATL, Samsung, LG, etc.) in China and started sourcing from 
Chinese battery manufacturers. In addition, sourcing from China was established  from new local Chinese 
material manufacturers such as Reshine, Pulead, Shanshan, Beijing Easpring, MGL, Novolyte (now BASF), 
Capchem. 

Europe and the United States mainly consume lithium for their glass, glass ceramics, enamel frits, ceramic 
industries, grease and organolithium compounds. 

Demand for Li-ion batteries is expected to increase as aside from prominently Tesla/Panasonic Korean and 
Chinese battery producers as well as large car manufacturers like VW, Daimler and are investing into battery 
production facilities.  The German Automobile Manufacturers Association (VDA) in a press release dated 
November, 2016 conceded that it is now imaginable unlike so far expected that penetration of e-mobility could 
be as high as between 15% and 25% by 2025.  Recent announcements by VW, Daimler, BMW, and others related 
to investments in e-mobility, new models, battery production, etc. strongly support this statement.   

This though does not necessarily mean that the lithium containing compound itself, like the cathode material, 
will be produced in Europe.

TECHNICAL-GRADE SPODUMENE 

In the past decades, global lithium consumption has been dominated by glass, enamel frits, ceramics, and steel 
casting applications where often technical-grade spodumene (which includes for some glass and ceramic 
applications petalite) as well as lithium carbonate can often alternatively be used.  Some applications though 
have special specifications regarding iron (Fe) or sodium (Na) or particle sizes requiring customized market 
approach or limited sources for such applications.  The split (Lithium carbonate versus Spodumene TG) so far 
depended on availability of spodumene TG, which is for technical reasons partially preferred, and pricing of 
Li-carbonate. 

Roskill have estimated the following average industry annual growth rates since 2000: around 6% in the glass 
and ceramics industry and 7% in metallurgical powders, all driven by the boom in construction in emerging 
countries.  Other end-use markets have continued to grow along the respective gross domestic product (GDP), 
apart from the aluminum industry where its use is decreasing due to the phase-out of Söderberg smelters. 

Since 2012, growth rates have been closer aligned to GDP growth rates of the respective country; according to 
Deutsche Bank, traditional markets for lithium will only grow by 3.5% p.a. over the next ten years.  

Stormcrow estimates that for glass-ceramics there is great potential due to the growing ubiquity of "gorilla 
glass", used in most touch surfaces due to its superior resistance to scratches and breakage.  Stormcrow 
estimates 7% p.a. growth from 2013 to 2025.  Aside from this market segment, increasing popularity of 
induction heating which requires heat and thermal shock resistant glass ceramics continues to increase as it is 
energy efficient and safer to use.  For these particular applications, use of technical-grade spodumene is highly 
advantageous. 

As Figure 19.3 illustrates, the highest growth for global lithium consumption from 2000 to 2015 was driven by 
the demand in the battery sector.

CHEMICAL-GRADE SPODUMENE 

According to Roskill, around 60.000 t LCE of chemical-grade spodumene was processed into lithium carbonate 
and lithium hydroxide in 2016.  Internal research yielded approximately 80,000 MT been converted into either 
Li2CO3 or LiOH.

Today all current chemical-grade spodumene processing plants are located in China due to costs associated 
with the import of raw materials, an existing and proven process, and most importantly, very limited supply of 
Chinese brine.  Chinese resources for spodumene and minerals so far have not been very competitive neither in 
quality nor in cost and reliability.  Spodumene has so far been sourced from Talison's Greenbushes mine.  The 
availability, transportation, grade, and quality, such as low mica content, played a major role in the historical 
set-up for the supply chain.  

The spodumene route is more expensive than the brine route from the Atacama production of SQM and ALB 
but has an advantage over brine that it can either yield a Li2CO3 or a LiOH product.  FMC's brine operation at the 
Salar del Hombre Muerto (ARG) has cost similar to the spodumene route when spodumene prices were at levels 
of approximately USD350/MT.  The spodumene is digested into the intermediate lithium sulfate (Li2SO4) from 
which both products Li2CO3 and LiOH, though not within the same production line can be made.  Therefore 
production of LiOH which emerged as the favorite 'precursor' for NCA as lithium battery cathode material has a 
substantial cost advantage (capex, processing).  With some investment a production line can within reasonable 
time be changed to the other product.  This provides not only flexibility but also diminishes risks for the 
investment as final market direction for cathode materials has not yet been decided. 

However, in the longer term, direct processing projects of spodumene near global mine locations, if current 
technical issues can be resolved, may become more prevalent, as made evident by Nemaska Lithium's lithium 
hydroxide project from mineral concentrate in Canada or plans of Neometals for a LiOH production facility in 
Australia as well as the ongoing construction in two phases of approximately 24,000 MT LiOH each by Tianqi in 
Kwinana, Australia near to its Talison spodumene mine, the latter running on a conventional and proven 
process.

Although total chemical-grade processing capacity in China for 2017 is estimated to be around 118.000t LCE, 
current utilization rates for these plants are 55% to 60%.  With more suppliers and quantities of spodumene 
available, conversion capacity in China should grow further quickly in order to satisfy the strongly growing 
demand for lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide.  Market availability for spodumene is projected to 
increase, spurring Chinese capacity growth, as Mt. Marion from Neometals and Mt. Cattlin from Galaxy 
Resources started to ship spodumene into the Chinese market.  Pilbara Minerals and Altura Mining from 
Australia are expected to follow suit supplying Chinese converters as suppliers from Brazil (AMG) and Canada 
will do over the next five years. 

The logic for this assumption was explained by Orocobre in an April 2017 presentation and presented in 
Table 19.2.  

Table 19.2 Conversion Cost of Spodumene Converters 

 
Source:  Orocobre, Investor Presentation 19.04.2017 (from Blue Ocean report27.04.2017) 

With prices for Li-carbonate at 15,000-20,000 USD/t even with spodumene prices close or above 1,000 USD/t of 
a 6% concentrate, further investments into the development into new resources and expansion of conversion 
capacities are facilitated, which are needed to support the tremendously growing Li-ion battery industry.  The 
calculation also implies that price levels below USD10,000/t are not sustainable as also S,G&A and financing 
cost have to be included in the calculation as explained below  

CURRENT PRICING AND CONTRACTS 

Spodumene concentrate is usually handled in dry bulk of tens of thousands of tons per parcel.  The most 
common international commercial term for negotiations are "FOB Australian Port" (Free on Board) and "CIF 
China" (Cost, Insurance and Freight), as per the INCOTERMS; the concentrate must be shipped to reach its 
destination in China, Europe, and the United States.  Payment for spodumene is usually against a first class 
bank guarantee or Letter of Credit. 

Most spodumene deals are done on frame contract basis, in which the volume is mutually agreed for six to 
twelve months.  In some cases, pricing is fixed or is alternatively negotiated on a quarterly basis.

Chinese spodumene converters are engaging in foreign lithium projects and off-take agreements to secure 
supply.  Recent pricing examples have shown that current deals are closing at level which considers the 
increased Li2CO3 and LiOH prices.  

According to Galaxy Resources, offtakes have been signed at a level of US$600/t for 2016.  In 2017, Galaxy has 
agreed to a binding agreement, whereby 120,000t of 5.5% spodumene concentrate will be contracted at 
US$830/t FOB.  Every additional 0.1% of Li2O content will garner a premium of US$15/t, enabling their recent 
stated prices of US$905/t.  Therefore, suppliers who will be able to provide a higher concentration of 
spodumene CG yielding lower conversion cost will also be able to achieve higher prices e.g. for a 6.5% 
concentrate USD980/t can be targeted.  

Another example of an offtake pricing mechanism is the agreement between Neometals and Gangfeng Lithium 
for 6% spodumene concentrate.  The parties have agreed to a price of US$750/t for H1, 2017.  This agreement 
includes a formula which is linked to the weighted average China import prices of lithium carbonate and 
lithium hydroxide, i.e. prices for concentrate from Neometals will rise further.  Furthermore, there is a floor 
price protection mechanism for the producer, which covers the cost of production plus a guaranteed margin.  
The payment for spodumene is made 100% on invoice against a letter of credit. 

Newcomer Tawana Resources announced on April, 26 2017 that it has entered into an off-take agreement with a 
100% subsidiary of Burwill Holdings Ltd (Hong Kong) for all production from no later than March 15, 2018 and 
until December 31, 2019 a fixed price of USD880/t (FOB Port Esperance) with a 25 million AUS$ interest-free 
prepayment in 3 installments (April, July and September).  The agreement is for 5 years with prices for Years 3 
to 5 being based on prevailing market conditions.  For the first 2 years, an aggregate production of 200,000 t is 
expected.  The concentrate may reach higher concentrations than 6% Li2O, (up to 6.7%) i.e. if materializing 
higher prices for Year 3 and following years should be expected. 

Critical Elements already has a take-or-pay agreement in place, guaranteeing a 100% off-take for all products 
from the Rose Lithium-Tantalum deposit for the whole life-of-mine.  The partner is HELM AG (HELM), a family-
owned chemical company headquartered in Germany.  HELM has been active in the chemical industry for more 
than 116 years.  The company is globally represented in more than 30 countries with 100 offices and moves 
approximately 14 million tons of product annually.  HELM provides both financial and technical support from 
the feasibility to production and has a solid balance sheet with a track record in assisting junior companies in 
building greenfield projects.  With the global logistic setup and synergies within the industry, HELM adds value 
throughout the whole value chain by enabling prompt deliveries to customer's premises, buffering functions, 
as well as other securities and added values for customers in all regions. 

19.1.3 SPODUMENE EXPANSION 

According to Roskill, the global lithium supply has experienced strong rates of growth in the last decade, 
increasing from around 100,000t LCE in 2009 to around 215,000t LCE in 2016 to meet the growth in demand 
from smartphones and other electronics.  Until recently, the surge in demand had exceeded any additions in 
supply from incumbent producers which incentivized new projects that plan or are starting up during the next 
five years.  Apart from this, a large number of so-called junior miner companies started to acquire prospective 
tenements for lithium exploration in pegmatite areas such as in Canada and Australia as well as so-called salars 
which bear brine in the mentioned Lithium Triangle.  Such new greenfield projects though require a long term 
of 7 to 10 years till they come to fruition. 

Due to the nature of lithium mine reserves, lithium production is concentrated by geography and ownership of 
reserves.  

There are currently two feasible sources of lithium, brines, and so-called hard rock mineral deposits, split 
roughly 55:45.

As spodumene is a product from mineral deposits, the scope of information will focus on lithium supply from 
hard-rock mineral deposits.  For the overall market, balance of lithium though brine deposits and their 
developments need to be taken into account as well. 

DEPOSIT AND RESOURCES REGIONS 

Two-thirds of the world's lithium reserves occur in the form of brine in an area commonly known as the 
'Lithium Triangle', which consists of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina.  Most hard-rock lithium deposits are found 
in so-called LCT pegmatites which occur geographically in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and some African 
countries.  Roskill states that current production from hard-rock deposits come from Australia, Brazil, China, 
Portugal, and Zimbabwe.  Other geological occurrences are based on clay mineralogy like Mexico and USA or 
other minerals like Zinnwaldit in the 'Erzgebirge' at the German-Czech border, Jadarite in Serbia, etc.  

According to data from Deutsche Bank Market Research (Deutsche Bank) and the United States Geological 
Survey (USGS), global lithium resources in 2016 were reported to be 250 million tons LCE, of which around 
76 million tons LCE, or 30%, are from hard-rock mineral deposits.  Figure 19.4 depicts the location of global 
lithium resources by country.  Figure 19.5 shows the allocation of global lithium resources by country. 

Figure 19.4 Location of Global Lithium Hard-Rock Deposits

Australia and Canada have so far the largest proportion of lithium bearing occurrences.  This is due to intensive 
geological research past exploration work for other minerals such as tantalum.

EXISTING PRODUCERS IN 2016 

According to Roskill, spodumene supply (this includes petalite and lepidolite) in 2016 lies around 90,000 t LCE, 
or 600,000 t of 6% concentrate.  The largest spodumene mine site is the Greenbushes site in Western Australia, 
owned by Albemarle (49%) and Sichuan Tianqi (51%), which produced around 70,000 t to 80,000 t LCE or 77% of 
total global spodumene supply in 2016.  Other major producers of spodumene and their respective volumes in 
2016 are shown in Table 19.3.

— The Mt. Marion project is a greenfield project in Western Australia owned by Mineral Resources (43.1%), 
Neometals (13.8%), and Ganfeng Lithium (43.1%), whereby Ganfeng Lithium has exclusive off-take until 
2020.  According to Neometals, production will be 200,000 t per year of a 6% spodumene concentrate and 
further recovery of 200,000 t per year of a 4% spodumene concentrate, which might be concentrated 
higher, subject to an investment into processing facilities. 

— The Mt. Cattlin project belongs to Galaxy Resources in Western Australia.  The project had been placed on 
care and maintenance in 2012 due to poor recoveries and a subdued market but has since restarted because 
of attractive market conditions.  According to Galaxy Resources, production in 2017 from Mt. Cattlin will be 
160,000 t of a 6% spodumene concentrate.  Off-take agreements are mainly with Chinese spodumene 
converters, including major converting company Shandong Ruifu Lithium. 

— Pilbara Minerals has completed financing of its Pilgangoora project which targets a production of 
2 million t of ore or 160,000 t of a 6% spodumene concentrate in the first phase to be doubled later in a 
second phase.  EPC is awarded, long-lead items ordered, and commissioning of the production planned for 
Q1, 2018.  Off-take agreements are in place for 100% of the production. 

— Altura Mining will follow suit but still has to settle some financing gap.  Long lead items though are ordered 
and commissioning is also planned for Q1, 2018.  Chinese battery producer Optimum Nano is backing this 
operation, although it is currently not clear who will convert the spodumene concentrate for them. 

— AMG, Brazil has approved the first phase of the project and ordered a processing facility to recover lithium 
from tailings of its Mibra Tantalum mine.  Ninety thousand (90,000)t of concentrate will be produced, and 
plant commissioning is planned for Q1, 2018.  Off-take for the concentrate has been agreed with General 
Lithium (CN).  In the second phase, lithium will be extracted from the mine as well and a chemical plant, 
production of LiOH or Li2CO3 is planned. 

19.1.4 LITHIUM MARKET GROWTH 

The future growth of the lithium market will clearly be dominated by the e-mobility powered by Li-ion 
batteries but also increasingly energy storage systems (ESS).  With the declining cost of Li-cells, targets for 
1 kWh being now very close to 150 USD, they are also becoming attractive also for use in private installations 
combined with increasing use of photovoltaic roof-top electricity generation (PV).  Figure 19.6 shows projected 
lithium consumption by battery end users. 

In Germany, a new regulation demands that for all PV projects exceeding 1MW power generation an energy 
storage system has to be installed by 2025.  This is in order to avoid peak energy stressing the electricity 
distribution systems, a phenomenon which already pushes European systems to their limits during summer 
months and increasingly so with the ongoing addition of new PV systems, be they commercial or private.

Canaccord, amongst others, assumes that the overall share of electric vehicles (EV) will climb to over 50% of all 
Li-ion batteries installed, i.e. being the driver of the expanding lithium market.  The absolute growth numbers 
from Canaccord's forecast are higher than previous assumptions, however, in line of some forecasts from OEMs.  

The current growth assumptions will, if they materialize, lead to a lithium demand requirement of 
approximately 750,000 tonnes of LCE.  This is an additional 550,000 tonnes of LCE required from 2017 until 2025 
or the equivalent of almost 70,000 tonnes per year of LCE.  Figure 19.8 presents the individual sector growths.

According to a recent Orocobre presentation, the expected growth already leads to a short position for supply 
as early as 2020 for the base case, and a demand-supply balance in case for the pessimistic growth case 
(Figure 19.9).

Whatever recent forecast is applied if materializing the growth expectations and hence demand for LCEs until 
2025 will require additional supply beyond the projects listed in Table 19.4 (total of 426,000t LCE) and be fully 
operational by 2025.  The situation will be aggravated if projects, as it is usually the case, are delayed or

2019 will therefore consume their available lithium concession by 2022.  This means that LCE supply from brine 
sources will be reduced by approximately 50,000t to 63,000t, unless SQM can find an agreement with CORFO, 
the Chilean government agency managing the lithium concessions, an undertaking which currently seems to 
be difficult as legal issues related to taxes, payments etc. are in an unresolved status. 

If these days consensus emerges to be that the market will grow by more than 450,000t of LCE, then the current 
projects even if executed timely and SQM finding a solution with the government a deficit of 30,000 t LCE per 
year remains.

In addition, the numbers shown in Table 19.4 as do many other publications from analysts or market 
researches, are so called 'name plate' figures.  Such numbers regularly do not include the technical availability 
of the production line itself, neither e.g. conversion yields.  Assuming that the technical availability is 90%, 
which is a very good number and the conversion yield from spodumene 85% capacity numbers could be revised 
approximately 25% downwards.  Another perspective is that the negative correction represents the risk to 
available capacity.  Whatever the case, if the downward risk is approximately 25% or from the 426,000t reduced 
by approximately 100,000t, then the gap between supply and demand will not be easily closed leaving very 
little room for scenarios with lower prices.  

Thus, in terms of LCE sourcing, the chemical grade spodumene concentrate will have to play a dominating role 
in the coming years, as it is not only this grade of spodumene which is used for the conversion of battery grade 
lithium carbonate and hydroxide but also the only source in combination with Chinese converters that can feed 
the lithium market expansion. Some conversion from lepidolite ore into Li-carbonate may take place in China, 
but it will not be on a scale that can effectively cover the emerging gap between demand and supply. Current 
cash cost estimation for conversion of lepidolite concentrate into Li2CO3 or LiOH are in the range of USD9,500/t 
of Li2CO3 to USD11,000/t of Li2CO3.  This would then be still below the cost for conversion of a DSO backed 
supply chain to China as evaluated by Canaccord. 

In all by third parties published industry cost curves for lithium carbonate either the cost are not precisely 
defined or the assessment of cash cost is not accurate.  Given that Chile's producers at the Atacama have the 
lowest production cash cost, nevertheless, for Albemarle the increase of royalties effective with the renewed 
contract with the Chilean government will increase the total cash cost to a level of spodumene converters at 
past spodumene purchasing prices, whilst SQM without having an ongoing concession from Chile will not 
supply the market after 2022.  Insofar the Chilean government created a 'level playing field' for lithium 
carbonate.  

In this context it is feasible for spodumene producers and not only Tianqi and Albemarle to pursue the 
downstream lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide production as with tight markets prices for lithium 
carbonate and lithium hydroxide should incentivize a downstream investment.  The same incentive is valid for 
converters of spodumene pursuing investments into upstream resources. 

In addition, spodumene technical grade will alleviate only negligibly the expected short LCE supply situation, 
but surely meet a market with a pricing reflecting the increased LCE prices.  Historically spodumene TG prices 
have either followed or exceeded the Li-carbonate price.  Accordingly with contracted Li-carbonate prices of 
currently USD12,000/t to USD15,000/t (spot prices in China can exceed this level) the spodumene TG price is 
expected be to at USD1,500/t and USD1,800/t. 

Avicenne, a leading consulting firm specializing in energy, does not see potential for an invasion from 
competing Li-ion technology.  Before widespread adoption of any competing technology can take place, the 
industry would have to conduct necessary tests to determine safety and feasibility of the new technology, 
which is a timely and costly process.  Moreover, any competing technology would have to compete against 
today's cost of the Li-ion battery, which has already benefited from considerable cost reductions due to 
economies of scale.  

Thus, the rechargeable battery sector and in particular the e-mobility will continue to drive lithium 
consumption.

 TANTALUM BACKGROUND 
Tantalum is a rare, non-toxic, and dense blue-gray metal which is highly malleable and chemically inert.  Its 
unique characteristics are stability at extreme temperatures and its anti-corrosion properties have permitted 
the element to gain prominence in many metal alloys and applications. Tantalum's primary use is in capacitors 
for consumer electronics.  Table 19.4 provides an overview of industrial uses of tantalum.

Historically, tantalum supply and demand were relatively balanced.  Demand grew at GDP levels based on the 
wide ranges of applications for the material with supply sourced primarily from artisanal mining operations in 
Central Africa and supplemented by major mines in Brazil and Australia.  This resulted in a relatively stable 
pricing environment of approximately $80-90/kg.  With the passing of the Dodd-Frank act in 2011 which 
included the designation of tantalum as a conflict mineral, the supply of tantalum became constrained and 
prices for tantalum became very volatile, peaking at over $270/Kg in 2012.  In the years since 2012, the supply 
constraint for tantalum has diminished first by consumers sourcing their requirements from certified 
conflict-free sources in Central Africa and later by new supply originating as a by-product of lithium mining. 
With improved availability, prices for tantalum have fallen back to approximately $120-130/kg today.

19.2.1 TANTALUM AS A MINING CO-PRODUCT 

Tantalum is rarely found in its elemental form and is instead mined as a mineral such as columbite, tantalite, 
and wodginite. These minerals are composed of a mixture of elements most commonly containing tantalum, 
niobium, thorium, and uranium. These minerals often occur in deposits with other commercially valuable 
materials such as lithium, cobalt, and tin.  Consequently these minerals are often recovered as a co-product of 
mining these materials. Current estimates suggest that co-product recovery of tantalum could represent as 
much as 20% of the supply of tantalum by 2026. 

19.2.2 ARTISANAL MINING AND CONFLICT MATERIALS 

Tantalum-bearing mineral deposits occur in Central Africa where they are often mined on a small scale by local 
individuals, so called artisanal mining.  The proceeds from the mining of these materials are occasionally used 
to fund on-going civil conflicts in this region.  The Dodd-Frank Act of 2011 and its companion legislation in the 
European Union requires all public companies to disclose the source of minerals used in their products and to 
certify that they have not been associated with human rights violation.  Tantalum is defined as a conflict 
mineral under the act.  Therefore, companies must perform due diligence in order to determine whether their 
sourced tantalum, or any of its derivatives, were sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or its 
bordering countries.  These and similar regulations in Canada and China constrain tantalum supply from the 
region, as it can be difficult for companies to file and prove the mineral to be conflict-free.   

19.2.3 TANTALUM DEMAND AND OUTLOOK 

The total demand for tantalum in 2015 was estimated to be 1,700t.  Roskill forecasts compound annual growth 
rates for tantalum of 3.3% through 2026 based on very rapid growth in super alloys for land based and 
aerospace gas turbines which offsets below trend line growth in the key capacitor segment.  The growth in 
tantalum demand in the capacitor industry is challenged by its substitutes such as ceramic, aluminum, and 
niobium capacitors.  

There are two major distributors in the tantalum supply chain:  H.C. Starck and Global Advanced Metals.  Other 
companies offering tantalum include   PLANSEE, and Vascotube GmbH. 

19.2.4 TANTALUM SUPPLY AND OUTLOOK 

There are a number of sources of supply for tantalum such as mining, recycling, tin slags (by-products of tin 
smelting), and synthetic concentrates.  Roskill estimates that more than half of the world's supply of tantalum 
comes from mining operations.  According to the United States Geologic Survey (USGS), the total production of 
tantalum from mining operations was approximately 1,200 tons in 2015.  The largest producing mines in 2015 
are located in Brazil and Central Africa, specifically the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda. 
According to the USGS these two countries account for close to 67% of the total supply from mining operations 
(although Rwanda is only a trader).  These two countries account for close to 67% of the total supply from 
mining operations.  Figure 19.11 illustrates the global mine production.

According to Roskill, the supply of tantalum could increase by 37% by 2026.  This will be mainly from 
conventional mining projects either on a co-production basis or from expanded mining operations in Brazil.  
The tantalum industry could undergo substantial shift in the source of supply as future volumes of material will 
be supplied from mining projects in Australia, Brazil, and Canada.  Several estimates indicate that Australia 
alone may supply up to 20% of the global demand for tantalum.  For example, Mt. Cattlin's hard-rock lithium 
operation alone is expected to add approximately 90t/ of supply, or 7.5%, of Ta2O5 to the market. 

In 2016, 12% of the global supply of tantalum came from three companies in Brazil, Mineração Taboca (Pitinga 
Mine), AMG (Mibra Mine), and MBAC Fertilizer.  Based on expansion plans published by these companies, this 
region could account for 24% of global tantalum supply by 2026.  

In 2016, according to the USGS, an estimated 67% of tantalum mine supply came from the DRC and Rwanda, the 
majority of which came from artisanal mining operations.  Tantalum consumers are expected to switch to 
conflict-free material offered by lithium by-product producers to reduce their current dependence on Central 
African artisanal supply.  

19.2.5 TANTALUM PRICING FORECAST 

As described above price have come down over the past years and have reached a level of approximately 
$125/kg.  According to recent study by Roskill, a price of at least $110-132/kg is needed in order to sustain 
continued supply from artisanal and by-product sources.  

However, Roskill expects that in the long-term prices should increase to about $175/kg driven mainly by the 
sustained growth of the end-markets as well as conflict minerals regulations.

Although in the US, the SEC will likely no longer be enforcing the 2012 Dodd-Frank act rule, requiring firms to 
verify that their products do not use conflict minerals, in the EU, conflict minerals regulations will apply from 
2017 on (majority of the provisions will be effective in 2021).  Additional supply will come predominantly from 
the growth of lithium ore mining with Tantalum as a by-product, especially in Australia, presenting a 
guaranteed conflict-free source.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, 
AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 

The following section details the regulatory environment of the Project.  It presents the applicable laws and 
regulations and lists the permits that will be needed in order to begin the mining operations.  The 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) process requires that data be gathered on many components and 
consultations be held to inform the Project relevant stakeholders.  The main results of this inventory and 
consultation process are also documented in this section.  The design criteria for the water and mining waste 
infrastructure are also outlined.  Finally, the general outline of the mine's rehabilitation plan is presented to 
the extent of the information available at this point in time. 

 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 
The opening of a mine is subject to the provincial environmental impact assessment and review procedure 
under Section 153 of Chapter II of the Environment Quality Act (EQA; CQLR, chapter Q-2).  This chapter deals 
with the provisions applicable to the James Bay and Northern Québec region.  Appendix A of the EQA lists the 
projects that are subject to the assessment and review process, and so the Project is subject to it, as it states 
"any mining project, including expansion, transformation or modification of an existing mining operation ".  It 
is also subject to a federal environmental assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act 
("CEAA"), 2012 (S.C. 2012, c.19, s.52) in application of the Regulations Designating Physical Activities 
(DORS/2012-147), as the mine will produce more than 3,000 t/day.  

In conjunction to these legislations, the Project is located on the James Bay and Northern Québec Agreement 
("JBNQA") territory.  Chapter 22 of the JBNQA defines the environmental and social protection regime in 
relation to development activities affecting the territory.  Appendix 1 of Chapter 22 (JBNQA) also lists projects 
submitted to the environmental assessment procedure, activities such as mine openings and relocation of 
power lines.  As such, the environmental assessment process will be guided by the dispositions of this chapter 
and environmental evaluation committees will be created (COMEX, COMEV, COFEX-South).  These committees 
will ensure that the Cree people are represented and involved. 

Beyond the environmental impact assessment, the Project design must comply with the applicable provincial 
and federal regulations regarding planned equipment and infrastructure.  Numerous laws, regulations, policies 
and directives are applicable to the Project, the most significant of which are detailed hereinafter.  

20.1.1 LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

PROVINCIAL LEVEL 

Mining Act (CQLR, Chapter M-13.1) 

The Mining Act, with its Regulation respecting mineral substances other than petroleum, natural gas and brine (CQLR, 
chapter M-13.1, r. 2), determines how mines must be developed, operated and closed. Under this law, mining 
companies must submit a site restoration plan which must be approved by the Ministère de l'Énergie et des 
Ressources naturelles (MERN). This plan must be reviewed every five years, or when changes in the mining 
activity warrant changes. Thus, a restoration plan will be elaborated as part of the present project, as required 
in the provincial directive which sets the ESIA requirements.

Finally, this law requires the promoter to provide, for the two years following the plan's approval, a financial 
guarantee equal to 100% of the anticipated cost of the planned restoration work. This guarantee must be 
provided in three installments: 50% within 90 days of the plan's approval and 25% at the next 2 plan approval 
anniversary dates. 

Directive 019 on the Mining Industry (March 2012 Edition) 

The operational (re-use, extraction and treatment) and closure activities are also subject to Directive 019 on the 
mining industry, the tool currently used to analyze mining projects requiring a certificate of authorization 
under the EQA.  In addition to the information required for the certificate of authorization request, this 
directive includes standards for the safe management of tailings as well as the MDDELCC's broad guidelines 
regarding environmental protection.  

The directive was taken into account during the design of the Project, most notably with regard to capacity, 
safety of the retention structures, and the water tightness criteria. 

Environment Quality Act (CQLR, Chapter Q-2) 

Section 22 of the EQA requires that mining projects obtain certificates of authorization.  The main regulations 
to which the mine project is subject under the EQA include:

— Authorisation for implementing dust collector (RRAEQA, s. 48). 

Also, Critical Elements must compensate for the loss of wetlands.  A compensation program will be developed 
in collaboration with the environmental authorities. 

FEDERAL LEVEL 

At this stage of the Project, it is foreseen that the following federal authorizations will be required: 

— A permit from Transport Canada according to the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Regulations; 
— A permit to store explosives according to sections 2 and 3 of the Explosives Act, 
— A permit from Environment Canada (storage of chemicals) according to the Canadian Environmental 

Protection Act; 
— Critical Elements will need to complete a declaration to the National Pollutant Release Inventory. 

Also, Critical Elements must compensate for the loss of fish habitat.  A compensation program will be developed 
in collaboration with the environmental authorities.  Other permits/authorizations could be required following 
the conclusions of the federal analysis of the EIA. 

20.1.3 LAND LEASES 

A land lease will need to be obtained between Critical Elements and the provincial government (the custodian 
of the State lands).  This will be applicable to all lands where construction work is needed.  This land lease will 
need to be acquired before permit requests.  As such, a land lease request will be prepared and submitted to the 
MERN at least a year before the permits are required as the Ministry must include consultation with Aboriginal 
Communities before delivery of the land lease. 

 ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE STUDIES 
Baseline environmental studies were initiated in the spring 2011.  In 2016, various studies were undertaken in 
order to update the 2011 data and also to obtain the baseline information that is required to assess the Project's 
impacts within the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the Project.  In total, 12 different sectorial 
studies were completed documenting the following components: 
1 Climatology and hydrology; 
2 Surface water and sediments; 
3 Terrestrial fauna and avifauna; 
4 Aquatic fauna; 
5 Artificial light at night; 
6 Landscape; 
7 Environmental Site Assessment – Phase I; 
8 Vegetation and wetlands; 
9 Greenhouse gas; 
10 Air quality (including modelling); 
11 Noise (including modelling); 
12 Archeology.

Another sectoral study is currently ongoing for the following environmental components: 
— Hydrogeology (including modelling). 

Since the Project has changed since the EIA was submitted to the authorities, three studies will be updated in 
the next weeks.  These updates are required to take into account the changes made in the Project. 

— Air quality (including modelling); 
— Greenhouse gas; 
— Noise (including modelling). 

Two studies areas have been identified for the EIA and the associated environmental and baseline studies 
(Figure 20.1).  The 'local study area' includes all of the areas likely to be directly physically impacted by the 
mine development (in regard of the infrastructure locations). The 'regional study area' is a larger area 
extending out of the Property and to which is potentially associated cumulative effects with other projects or 
infrastructures.

20.2.1 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT 

Much of the information on the natural environment was obtained from the environmental impact study of the 
Eastmain-1-A development and Rupert diversion project, produced by Hydro-Québec in 2004.  These data have 
been updated with field inventories that began in the summer and fall of 2011 and then continued in 2016.  The 
overall picture of the Project's host environment can be drawn, at this stage, using these data. 

GEOLOGY AND SEDIMENTS 

Bedrock Geology 

The bedrock of this sector of the Canadian Shield is composed mainly of granitic tones and rocks (Brosseau, 
2008).  These intrusive igneous rocks are located just east of the volcano-sedimentary strip of the Eastmain 
River, which forms a green belt, Archean in age.  Refer to Section 7 for details of bedrock geology. 

Surficial Geology 

The nature of loose deposits in the immediate sector of the study area is primarily related to the sedimentary 
processes associated with the last glaciation and subsequent deglaciation.  The highest portions of the area are 
covered with till and thin till; the latter, less than 1 m thick, is often traversed by rock outcrops 
(Brosseau, 2008).  The till matrix is silty sandy and forms 85-90 % of the sediment; the rest is represented by 
variable proportions of blocks, pebbles and gravel (Brosseau, 2008).  

The lowlands of the study area are covered with sand and gravel with blocks.  These accumulations, of 
fluvioglacial origin, took place at the margin of the glacier in recess.  They are based on the regional till or 
directly on the rocky basement.  These sediments are composed largely of sand, gravel and rounded blocks.  
The thickness of these sand-gravel accumulations exceeds 0.6 m and frequently exceeds 5 m (Brosseau, 2008; 
Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie, 2004).  The lakes and rivers in the study area occupy the areas where these 
sediments have been established. 

GEOMORPHOLOGY 

The study area is located approximately 170 km east of the James Bay coast.  The sediments of the Project 
region are mostly associated with the last glacial episode.  The oldest stratigraphic unit that lies on the rock 
surface is the bottom till that has been sedimented during the different phases of glacial flow (Hardy, 1976).  
Most of the sediments have been set up in a transition zone, as the study area is located 14 km east of the 
Sakami Moraine.  The till can be surmounted by a layer of fluvioglacial sediments set up by glacial meltwater. 

In the study area, there are no glacial-lacustrine deposits.  The boundary of Ojibway Proglacial Lake is located 
15 km west of the study area.  There are no marine deposits in the study area.  However, the waters of the 
Tyrrell Sea invaded a large area to the east of the study area because of lower altitudes.  These are now flooded 
by the Eastmain-1 reservoir waters.  Before the establishment of the reservoir, very large bog that had 
developed on silty clay sediments introduced by the Tyrrell Sea were present.  Finally, more contemporary, 
alluvial, aeolian deposit and organic, have been implemented during the Holocene. 

GEOCHEMISTRY 

Critical Elements commissioned Lamont Inc. of Québec to compile and analyze the results of geochemical 
characterization tests performed on samples of rock waste taken from the projected footprint pit of the Project 
(Lamont Inc., 2017).  The samples and the analytical test protocol were previously determined by Critical 
Elements.

The Lamont Inc. (2017) report shows the following: 

— The Project deposit is located in the Superior Geological Province.  The mineralization is contained in 
spodumene pegmatite dykes that are encased in gneiss, amphibolite, porphyry and metasedimentary units.  
These four lithologies represent all of the future waste rock that will be extracted from the open pit, 
planned to be exploited for the Project.  The lithologies of gneiss and porphyry represent about 85 % of the 
future waste rock. 

— The characterization program was undertaken to characterize 21 samples of waste rock: 11 gneiss, 
6 amphibolite, 2 porphyry, and 2 metasediments.  All samples were taken from exploration drillcores, by 
Critical Elements. 

— The samples are mainly composed of SiO2 and Al2O3. The amphibolite samples also show slightly higher 
concentrations in Fe2O3, MgO and CaO. The results obtained with the whole rock analysis clearly 
demonstrate the overall composition of the samples being silicates. 

— The geochemical characterization tests were used to determine the potential of the samples to generate 
acidity.  According to Directive 019 criterion, applicable in Québec, two samples out of 21 are considered to 
potentially be acid generators, with Stotal concentrations of 0.314 % and 0.353 %.  These values are very close 
to the 0.3 % Stotal criterion.  The majority of the samples have a Stotal concentration below 0.05 %.  According 
to currently available information, either the majority of samples are NPAG, sulphur concentrations are 
low and that the presence of sulphides is marginal in the lithological units, it can be considered that all of 
the waste rock will be NPAG. 

— The tests were also used to determine the leaching potential of metals.  There are no samples with metal 
concentrations exceeding PPSRTC (Politique de protection des sols et de réhabilitation des terrains contaminés) 
criterion C.  Waste rock is therefore not considered to be high-risk material.  Still, according to Directive 
019 criterion, based on metal analysis and leachate test TCLP, 6 samples out of 21 are considered potentially 
leachable for copper.  Copper exceedances are mainly observed in amphibolite samples.  According to 
Critical Elements, this lithology could represent only 10.6 % of the total amount of waste rock to be 
extracted. 

In several cases of exceedances, copper concentrations (metal analysis) are very close to the value of PPSRTC 
criterion A.  The TCLP test is carried out in an acid medium, and since it has been demonstrated that all of the 
waste rock would be NPAG and the tailings would not be subjected to acidic conditions, SFE and CTEU-9 water 
leachate tests have been carried out.  Samples with copper concentrations exceeded criterion A did not exceed 
the RES criterion in these leachate tests.  Since the results of the leachate tests are not unanimous on the 
potential for copper and that Cu concentrations are relatively low, the risk of copper leaching is unlikely 
(Lamont Inc., 2017). 

In the case of mine tailings from the Project, they are NPAG, and there is no exceedance of PPSRTC criterion A; 
tailings are therefore not potentially leachable to metals. 

CLIMATE 

Meteorological data from La Grande Rivière Airport have been used to reflect prevailing conditions in the study 
area.  It is to be noted that this station is located at 205 km from the study zone and that climate parameters 
should be interpreted with caution prior to their use.

Climate of the study zone is characterized by a long and cold winter and a relatively short summer. 
Temperature varies over a broad range and extremes observed at the Grande Rivière Airport were between -
27.4 °C and 20 °C.  January is the colder month with an average temperature of -23.2 °C whereas July is the 
warmest month, with an average temperature of 13.7 °C.  Total yearly precipitation reach an average of 
683.9 mm and are more abundant from July to October.  Snowfalls occur from October to May and reach an 
average of 246 mm of water.  Wind blows mainly from west to south-east. 

AIR QUALITY 

A study of air quality was carried out as part of the Project and was incorporated into the EIA.  However, since 
the Project has changed since the EIA was submitted (July 2017), air quality modelling needs to be revised to 
reflect changes to the Project.  The air quality study is currently underway and the results are expected to be 
available shortly.  The objective of the baseline study is to model anticipated effects of the air quality in the 
study area.  In order to assess the impacts of air emissions from the mining work, modelling of the air 
dispersion covers the construction and operation and maintenance phases of the mine.  Canadian Ambient Air 
Quality Standards (CAAQS) and the Clean Air Regulation (CAR) were considered for the EIA and will be again 
considered with the new modelling.  Suspended solids, i.e. the total particulates (PMT) and fine particulates 
(PM2,5), will be taken into account during modelling.  The main gas compounds emitted, such as carbon 
monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), will also be modelled. 

GREENHOUSE GAS 

The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with mine operations will be recalculated to reflect changes to 
the Project, since the submission of the EIA.  The GHG study is currently underway and the results are expected 
to be available shortly.   

Legally, Critical Elements is annually required to report its air emissions, including EWGs, to the MDDELCC, in 
accordance with the Regulation respecting the mandatory reporting of certain emissions of contaminants into 
the atmosphere (RDOCÉCA). 

NOISE 

Field data collection for noise was completed in August 2011.  Noise data was collected with a sound level meter 
at different locations within the study area, following standards outlined in Directive 019 for the mining 
industry (MDDELCC, 2005).  However, since the Project has changed since the EIA was submitted (July 2017), 
noise modelling needs to be revised to reflect changes to the Project.  The noise study is currently underway 
and the results are expected to be available shortly. 

SOILS COMPOSITION AND QUALITY 

Field data collection for noise was completed in August 2011.  Noise data was collected with a sound level meter 
at different locations within the study area, following standards outlined in Directive 019 for the mining 
industry (MDDELCC, 2005). 

Construction noise simulation results show that they are below the criterion of MDDELCC guidelines for noise 
levels for a construction site, except for one receiving point (Cree camp at night).  It should be noted that 
although the Cree camp is subject to noise overruns, it will no longer be in use once the mining Project is in 
operation. 

The simulation results for the operation and maintenance scenario demonstrate that the calculated noise levels 
are all lower and thus complies with MDDELCC NI-98-101 criteria.

HYDROGEOLOGY 

The hydrogeology study is currently ongoing and will take into account the present project.  Until now field 
work has been carried out by WSP between the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017.  The hydrological work 
consisted of:  

— Forty intervals packer testing were carried out in  four existing drillings:  LR-10-47, LR-10-93, LR-10-126 and 
LR-11-158 - (December 2016); 

— Completion of 78 trenches - (December 2016); 
— Construction of two pumping wells of 226.8 m (PP1) and 182.9 m (PP2) depth - (end of January - beginning 

of February 2017); 
— Completion of two stage tests and two long-term pumping tests (PP1 and PP2) - (February 2017); 
— Water level surveys in pumping wells and certain exploration wells - (February 2017); 
— Particle size analysis of 54 soil samples from the trenches - (February 2017);  
— Collection of groundwater samples in the two pumping wells - (February 2017). 

Packer testing has been done to evaluate locally the bedrock hydraulic conductivity variation with depth in the 
pit area.  The two long-term pumping tests (72 hours) have been carried out to evaluate the global bedrock 
hydraulic properties in the deepest pit area. 

All collected data and hydraulic properties results of all hydrogeological formations were used to develop the 
conceptual model and carry out hydrogeological 3D modelling.  The study that is currently underway will 
determine baseline conditions such as ground water flow direction, hydrogeological formations, probable 
weakness zones in the bedrock, and permeability of bedrock.  The outcome of the study will help evaluate the 
potential impacts of the mining activities (dewatering, waste rock and tailing storage) on groundwater and 
propose an appropriate monitoring plan.   

HYDROLOGY AND HYDRAULIC 

A sectorial report was prepared in January 2017 by WSP on behalf of Critical Elements. 

The environment into which the Project will be inserted affects two water basins, the Eastmain River and the 
Pontax River watersheds.  The proposed pit lies directly on the watershed limit of these two major river basins. 

The Eastmain River basin originates in the Otish Mountains.  Since 1980, its waters have been diverted to the 
Grande Rivière basin by means of dams located on the Eastmain River, on the Opinaca River and on the Petite 
Rivière Opinaca.  The derived waters are temporarily retained in the Opinaca reservoir, with a maximum area 
of 1,040 km2.  They emerge through the installed capacity of the Sarcelle hydroelectric power plant. 

Below the Opinaca reservoir, the waters successively flow through Boyd Lake and its natural outlet, the Boyd 
River and then, Sakami Lake and its natural outlet constituted by the lower Sakami River, and finally reach the 
Robert-Bourassa reservoir.  This diversion drains an area of 40,275 km2, corresponding to 87 % of the Eastmain 
basin; it resulted in an average elevation of 3 m from Boyd Lake and 1.6 m from Sakami Lake.  Flows through 
the Boyd and Sakami rivers increased 50-fold and 6-fold, respectively, over natural flows. 

Prior to the La Grande hydroelectric development, Grande River drained a 98,820 km2 watershed.  It now 
captures the waters of a territory of 176,800 km2. 

The Pontax River basin originates in Champion Lake on the outskirts of the Nemaska village.  The Pontax River 
drains a watershed of 6,090 km2 and flows into Rupert Bay, 13 km northwest of the Cree village of Waskaganish.  
The Project is located at the head of the watershed, in a secondary branch that joins the Pontax River, 25 km 
east of the James Bay Road.  The mean flow of the Pontax River, measured between 1975 and 1996, is 98.8 m3/s 
(MDDEP, 2011).

Given its topographic location, the study area is mainly composed of small lakes and low flow streams. The 
hydrometric data of the waterbodies and rivers likely to be affected by the Project will be measured and 
collected. 

Five watercourses in the study zone have been analyzed as part of two hydrological characterization that took 
place in 2011.  Their average annual flow is estimated at 18.7 L/s/km2. The low water level Q10.7 is estimated at 
2.26 L/s/km² and the low water level is estimated at 3.03 L/s/km².  It should be noted that those data could 
have been underestimated.  Flood flows vary between 0.6 m³/s to 2.8 m³/s for a return period of 2 years. 

SURFACE WATER AND SEDIMENTS QUALITY 

In June and August, 2011, two sampling campaigns were conducted.  The study area covers a surface of 
approximately 102 km² and is shared between two watersheds, namely the La Grande Rivière watershed which 
includes the Eastman 1 reservoir and the Pontax river reservoir.  The study area includes many watercourses 
and waterbodies amongst which five lakes, five watercourses, and one bay of the Eastman 1 reservoir have been 
sampled in 2011.  They were selected because of their proximity to the mine's planned location and because 
they may be affected by mining activities.  

Generally, water and sediments quality is very good with respect to the criteria for the protection of aquatic 
life.  Water is limpid, low in productivity, dimly mineralized and has a low buffering capacity. Results show 
that, as a whole, the different sampled waterbodies have not been affected by contaminants spreading.  Apart 
from dissolved oxygen concentration and bacteriological analysis, there is no significant difference in water 
quality between sampling periods.  Due to the low activity level occurring in the sector, the presence of fecal 
coliforms is very likely of natural origin. 

Regarding sediments, only one detection has been registered at the Lake no. 5 sampling station in terms of oils 
and greases, and exceeding measurements for threshold effects level have been noted for cadmium and zinc at 
Lake no. 4 and for copper at Lakes no. 2, 4, and 5. 

ARTIFICIAL LIGHT AT NIGHT 

The Project's site and nearby camps are located in an area where the clarity of the sky is almost optimal.  A very 
much lesser clarity of the sky is present nearby the two main artificial light emitters: electrical substation 
Nemiscau, located south of the Project's site, and hydroelectric plant Eastman-1, located north of the site.  
However, this effect quickly fades after a few kilometres and gives place to a sky-clarity of very good quality. 

Regarding intrusive light, there is no such source in the study area.  Only the Nemiscau electrical substation 
and the hydroelectric plant Eastman-1 are sources of nocturnal artificial light that affects nocturnal landscapes 
with a very visible luminous halo.  This halo quickly fades and is no longer visible a few kilometres away from 
its source. 

20.2.2 BIOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT 

FLORA 

The Project area is characterized by the presence of numerous hills and valleys.  The mainly coniferous 
terrestrial stands, as well as peatlands, are the main vegetative groups of the territory.  The density and 
composition of these stands vary mainly according to the fire regime (more or less recent slash and burning), 
the substrates, and drainages observed, as well as the exposure of these to the severity of the climate.  Whether 
in wetlands or on land, heath plants dominate virtually all landscapes.

Vegetation Groups 

Terrestrial environment represents 54.1 % of the study zone.  In general, the area under study is largely 
dominated by coniferous stands, more particularly, the jack pine forest with lichens (60.3 %).  Those are mainly 
observed on the slopes and hilltops in rather xeric conditions, whether on sandy deposits or directly on the 
rock.  The age of these stands is mainly dictated by the fire regime varying in frequency, intensity, and extent.  
Depending on the average height of the individuals observed in these groups, the pine forests were classified 
into three different categories: regenerating pinewood, intermediate pine forest, and mature pine forest.  The 
intermediate pine forest is the most frequently observed category in the area.  As for the shrub and herbaceous 
strata, only a few species are found and the soil is almost entirely covered with lichens. 

Apart from pine forests, spruce-moss and spruce-lichens stands are also observed in the Project area.  These 
groups, however, are less numerous and often cover smaller areas than jack pine forests.  The muscinal strata 
on which these spruces (mosses and / or lichens) grow varies according to the drainage of the soil; lichens are 
rather observed in areas with excessive drainage, while mosses are more present in more mesic conditions.  
The ericaceae are omnipresent and form a relatively denser shrub stratum than in the pine forests.  The 
herbaceous stratum, on the other hand, is not very diversified. The soil is almost entirely covered with 
hypnaceous mosses, sphagnum mosses, and lichens. 

Although the stands are mainly composed of coniferous species, several small deciduous stands are also 
observed on the southern slopes of the mountains or in some sheltered areas of the hills.  White birch is the 
most frequently observed species.  It is observed either in pure stands or in the company of aspen.  These two 
species can also be observed with coniferous species forming mixed stands. 

In addition to the arborescent groups, several terrestrial areas composed mainly of ericaceae are also observed 
in the study area.  These mainly result from more or less recent forest fire.  The density of regenerating trees in 
these areas varies according to the age of forest fires. 

Wetlands 

Wetlands represent whereas represent 30.5 % of the study zone.  They are mainly composed of peatlands and 
some riparian environments.  Peat bogs (bogs) are the largest and most frequent in the study area.  In the 
insertion area of the Project, different types of ombrotrophic peatlands are present.  These can be arborescent 
or shrubby.  In all cases, they are characterized by a thick carpet of sphagnum sometimes accompanied by 
hypnaceous mosses and lichens. 

Riparian wetlands are infrequent, usually narrow and poorly developed.  The vegetation then appears as a 
succession of parallel bands of swamps and marshes.  These wetlands consist of herbaceous species and shrubs 
different from peatlands, such as salicaceae, myricaceae and sedges. 

Ecological Value 

Among inventoried areas, four were attributed a high ecological value due to their ecological integrity, quality 
of their hydrological connections and their maturity:  two emergent marsh, one treed marsh, and one open 
ombotrophic peatland.  No plant of special status has been inventoried.  However, an invasive exotic plant, the 
Reed Canarygrass, has been found at various places, although only on a few square metres for each observation.  
Thirty-two species of Cree's medicinal interest have been identified:  six species of trees, twenty species of 
shrubs, five herbaceous species, and one group of mosses species.

FAUNA 

Terrestrial Wildlife 

Three species of large mammals are likely to frequent the study area.  These include moose (Alces alces), black 
bear (Ursus americanus), and caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), both woodland and migratory ecotypes.  
Also several species of small terrestrial fauna are likely to frequent the study area of the natural environment 
according to their range.  As for the micromammals, there are 14 species potentially present in the study area, 
the presence of six species has been confirmed during the inventory carried out in 2016.  No species with a 
special status has been recorded. 

Moose 

In general, the density of moose in Hunting Zone 22, of which the study area is part, is one of the lowest in 
Québec.  It was estimated at 0.26 moose / 10 km2 in 1991 and 0.31 moose / 10 km2 in 1997.  Signs of presence 
(faeces and traces) of moose were observed during inventories carried out in 2012 and 2016. 

Black Bear 

The presence of the black bear was confirmed within the study area from observations of some black bear 
traces and feces (summers 2012 and 2016). 

Caribou 

The study area for the Project is located in the area of distribution of woodland caribou and migratory caribou 
(Leaf River Herd).  Thus, individuals from these two ecotypes are likely to frequent the study area of the 
Project.  The woodland caribou of the Nottaway local population, which occupies the territory north of 
Matagami, are most likely to be in the study area of the Project.  It should be noted, however, that there may be 
exchanges between the individuals of this population and those of the Témiscamie and Assinica herd.  
Following a request for information, two woodland caribou with geolocation collars have frequented the study 
area.  One individual stayed at the end of the winter period from March 31 to April 14, 2009.  The other 
individual frequented the area on two sequences, during the winter period from December 10, 2005 to January 
6, 2006, and in the spring period from April 16 to 21, 2007.  An individual, in the spring period, was located in an 
area between 8 and 25 km from the mine site according to the MFFP telemetric survey data.  Within a 50 km 
radius of the proposed mine centre, available information does not indicate any location of forest-dwelling 
caribou during critical calving and calf rearing (summer) periods. 

Current knowledge therefore indicates that woodland caribou of the Nottaway herd have scarcely used the 
study area over the past decade within a radius of approximately 25 km from the projected mine.  The presence 
of migratory caribou in the area is considered to be marginal. 

Avifauna 

For avian wildlife, the various field surveys and opportunistic observations confirmed the presence of 87 
species belonging to 30 families in the study area during the inventories carried out in 2012 and 2016.  The 
distribution and abundance of avifauna in the area varies according to seasons, ecological preferences and 
habitat availability for each of the groups, namely waterfowl and other aquatic birds, shorebirds, forest birds, 
diurnal raptors, and nocturnal raptors.

For the forest birds species, 15 are confirmed to be breeding birds (i.e.: american three-toed woodpecker 
(Picoides dorsalis); the swamp sparrow (Zonotrichia georgiana); the golden crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), 
etc.  Many game birds are also present in the area (i.e.: the ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus); the common 
goldeneye (Bucephala clangula); the black duck (Anas rubripes); the sprouse grouse (Falcipennis canadensis), 
etc.). Concerning birds of prey, several species have been recorded in the area.  The most abundant species is 
the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), followed by the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis).  Finally, on the 87 species, 
five bird species at risk were surveyed in the study area, two of which were in the period of migration 
(peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and rusty blackbird (Euphagus carolinus)), and three in nesting periods 
(bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), and common nighthawk (Chordeiles 
minor)).  The bald eagle was an immature individual. 

Herpetofauna 

For herpetofauna, the various field surveys and opportunistic observations confirmed the presence of 
11 species potentially present in the study area, seven were identified in the study area in 2012 and 2016: 
american toad (Bufo americanus), northern spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer crucifer), mink frog (Lithobates 
septentrionalis), green frog (Lithobates clamitans melanota), wood frog (Lithobates sylvaticus), the common 
garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) and the northern two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata).  No species at 
risk were observed. 

Aquatic Fauna 

In June and August 2011, two sampling campaigns were conducted to determine the fish species found within 
the study area.  In 2016, an additional fish sampling campaign was conducted and the main objectives were to 
describe the fish communities in lakes, determine the fish density in stream and describe lacustrine and stream 
habitats.  The study area covers a surface of approximately 102 km² and is shared between two watersheds, 
namely the La Grande Rivière watershed, which includes the Eastman 1 reservoir, and the Pontax river 
reservoir.  The study area includes many watercourses and water bodies amongst which five lakes, five 
watercourses, and one bay of the Eastman 1 reservoir have been sampled.  They were selected because of their 
proximity to the mine's proposed location and therefore, they may be affected by mining activities. 

The field surveys have confirmed the presence of 12 fish species within the study area.  These are: white sucker 
(Catostomus commersonii), lake chub (Couesius plumbeus), pearl dace (Margariscus margarita), longnose dace 
(Rhinichthys cataractae), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), northern pike (Esox lucius), walleye (Sander 
vitreus), yellow perch (Perca flavescens ), mottled sculpin (Cottus bairdi), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus), 
burbot (Lota lota) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis).  None of these are listed on the Species at Risk Act or 
likely to be vulnerable or endangered in Québec.  Hydro-Québec has carried out a program to introduce lake 
sturgeon in the Eastmain 1 reservoir.  The species is now found in that reservoir and this species is designated 
likely to be vulnerable or endangered in Québec.  According to the CBJNQ, lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), 
white sucker, burbot and lake whitefish are strictly reserved to the First Nations use in this region. 

— White sucker as well as pearl dace were found within Lake 1 while the presence of brook trout and burbot 
was confirmed in Watercourse A which is Lake 1 outlet.  Lake 1 has shallow water (max depth of 2.4 m) and 
the dissolved oxygen concentration may be limiting to fish survival during summer and winter.  

— Northern pike and white sucker were found within Lake 2, but fish density was very low.  The substrate of 
this lake showed a very thick layer of muck which may explain the water acidic pH measured near the 
bottom.  The dissolved oxygen concentration in water may also be limiting to fish survival during summer 
and winter.  Lake 2 is partially isolated from Lake 3 due to the presence of barriers in Watercourse B.

— In Lake 3, white sucker was the main fish species found in 2011 field surveys.  However, in 2016, white 
sucker and lake whitefish were the two main species captured.  Besides these, northern pike, yellow perch, 
mottled sculpin and walleye were also found in Lake 3.  The water pH and dissolved oxygen were low, 
especially below 5 m, and this could be limiting to some fish species survival.  There are several aquatic 
plants and marshes offering suitable spawning habitats to northern pike and yellow perch. Beaver dams 
were observed in Watercourse E and these may prevent fish passage between Lake 3 and the Eastmain 1 
reservoir. 

— Lakes 4 and 5 were sampled in 2011.  Northern pike and yellow perch were found in small amount in these 
waterbodies.  The water pH and dissolved oxygen showed low values which may be limiting to some fish 
species survival. 

Elements of Interest from the Natural Environment 

Several occurrences of wildlife and floristic species at risk were identified during the implementation of the 
Hydro-Québec environmental impact study (2004) for the Eastmain-1 reservoir. These species are associated 
with specific habitats which, by the same token, become elements of interest in the natural environment. The 
elements of interest of the natural environment specific to the Property can be defined more precisely when 
interpreting the data collected during the various field work campaigns. 

The common nighthawk, the bald eagle, the rusty blackbird, the peregrine falcon and the short-eared owl are 
the only precarious species observed in the study area according to the inventories. 

20.2.3 SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT 

ARCHAEOLOGY 

In 2011, an archaeological potential study was undertaken by Arkéos Inc. on a 83.4 km2 study area.  Within this 
area, 12 archaeological sites corresponding to Native American occupation and prehistoric, modern and 
contemporary period are actually known following the research made as part of the Eastmain-1 hydroelectric 
project. 

Twenty-one archaeological potential sites has been identified.  In order to avoid archaeological and 
ethnological vestige destruction because of projected construction works, an archaeological team should 
proceed to an archaeological inventory of areas affected by the Project.  Such an inventory will allow to 
validate what has been noticed on aerial maps and photographs, and to proceed to field investigations if 
required.  This inventory should take place before the construction phase, when there is no snow cover 
(i.e. from the beginning of June in this region).  Following this study, further recommendations (such as 
archaeological excavations) could be addressed depending potential discovery. 

LANDSCAPE 

A sectorial report was done in February 2017 by WSP on behalf of Critical Elements.  Analysis of visible features 
of the landscape allowed to determine six kinds of landscape.  Delimitation of landscape types mainly comes 
from land use, visual quality and observer's visual field.  Identification and analysis of landscape types allow to 
determine visual issues for the study zone.  Landscape types are as follows: 

— Mistassini's highland hill Landscape type (174 km2, 42 % of the study area), which includes hillslopes of an

TRADITIONAL LAND USE 

Land Use 

The study area is located in the administrative region of Northern Québec, on the territory of the Regional 
Government of Eeyou Istchee James Bay.  It should be noted that the municipality of James Bay no longer exists 
since the creation of the Regional Government of Eeyou Istchee James Bay, January 1, 2014.  The latter is a 
municipal body governed by the Cities and Towns Act and its territory is constituted of the territory of the 
Municipality of James Bay as it existed before, except Category II lands.  

The territory of Eeyou Istchee James Bay includes the municipalities of Chibougamau, Chapais, Lebel-sur-
Quévillon and Matagami, the three towns of Valcanton, Radisson and Villebois, and the nine Cree communities 
of Northern Québec:  Chisasibi, Eastmain, Waskaganish, Wemindji, Whapmagoostui, Mistissini, Nemaska, 
Oujé-Bougoumou and Waswanipi. 

The legislative and legal context of Northern Québec is notably governed by the James Bay and Northern 
Québec Agreement (JBNQA), the Northeastern Québec Agreement and the Agreement Concerning a New 
Relationship between the Government of Québec and the Cree of Québec also called the "Peace of the braves".  
The territorial regime introduced by the JBNQA is a decisive element in the use of the territory.  It provides for 
the division of the James Bay territory into Category I, II and III lands.  The study area intersects Category II and 
III lands.  On Category II lands, the Cree have exclusive rights to hunt, fish and trap, while on Category III lands 
they enjoy the exclusive right to trap fur animals and certain benefits in the field of outfitting, without having 
exclusive rights. 

The Cree communities of Eastmain and Nemaska are the main involved in the project.  The study area overlaps 
four traplines linked to users of these communities: R10 (Waskaganish), RE1 (Eastmain), R19 and R16 
(Nemaska).  The use of this territory is dominated by the hunting, fishing and trapping activities of tallymen 
and their families and other Cree users.  At least two settlements located on grounds RE1 and R19 respectively, 
are located in the study area.  They are located along the Nemiscau - Eastmain-1 road that crosses the study 
area in a north-south axis and connects the Eastmain-1 hydroelectric plant to the Route du Nord.  

The territory under study is also frequented by non-native users for sport hunting and fishing activities.  It is 
part of the Weh-Sees Indohoun ("WSI") hunting and fishing zones established within the framework of the 
Eastmain-1 hydroelectric projects and the Eastmain-1-A and Sarcelle power stations, and the Rupert diversion, 
in order to supervise the hunting and fishing activities on the territory surrounding the project site.  
Previously, WSI was managed by Weh-Sees Indohoun and funded by Hydro-Québec.  Since 2015, management 
of this area has been transferred to the Weh-Sees Indohoun subcommittee established by the Joint Hunting, 
Fishing and Trapping Committee, which was established in the context of the JBNQA.  The subcommittee 
oversees the WSI area and the exploitation of its wildlife resources to manage access to resources, promote 
wildlife and ecosystem conservation, and preserve wildlife heritage for future generations. 

Under the ESIA, information will be sought to document the use of the study area by the tallymen and their 
families, as well as by other Cree and non-Cree users.

In terms of infrastructure, in addition to the road leading to the Eastmain-1 power plant and some secondary 
roads, the study area is crossed by two power transmission lines, one at 315 kV and the other at 735 kV.  
Discussions are underway with Hydro-Québec to move a few 315-kV tower pylons that would be required to 
operate the mine.  This work will be conducted under the direction of Hydro-Québec.

Jamesian Community 

In the Jamesian community, interviews were conducted in Matagami in May, 2012, with stakeholders from 
certain sections of the municipal administration, economic development, land management and planning, and 
natural resources management (see Table 20.2).  These interviews identified the concerns and expectations of 
the Jamesians, regarding the Project and overall mining development on the territory.  Community 
stakeholders expressed support for mining developments in their region, but all stressed the importance of 
developing conditions to ensure and to maximize the positive socio-economic benefits for the region.

Stakeholder Consultation and Commitment Plan 

A stakeholder consultation and commitment plan will be developed regarding the Project development. 

 WASTE AND WATER MANAGEMENT 

20.3.1 WASTE MANAGEMENT 

Activities on the mine site will produce some waste material to be handled and removed from site.  It is planned 
for a specialized contractor to manage waste material on site, including the supply, handling, and 
transportation at periodic times of the containers to appropriate disposal and sorting centre.  Depending on the 
capacities and costs, disposal centre could be in Chibougamau or St-Félicien. 

All waste on site will be sorted at source as to separate domestic waste, recycling material (wood, metal, papers, 
plastic, copper, etc.) and hazardous waste (oils, lubricants, adhesives, paints, reagents, solvents, batteries, etc.). 
Dedicated containers will be installed to collect waste and recycling materials from office or working areas 
bins.  Domestic waste containers will be animal-proof.

Hazardous material will be collected in specific and clearly identified locations.  The contractor will be 
responsible for the gathering of hazardous materials on site, proper identification, safe transport, and 
appropriate sorting at the sorting centre (or safe shipment of material directly to specialized companies if 
required). 

Empty bags of explosives will be recovered and managed by the explosive supplier.  

20.3.2 WATER MANAGEMENT 

GENERAL 

The water management plan includes minimizing the amount of water that comes in contact with mining 
infrastructure and the mixing of contact water with infrastructures with potential for contamination (pit, 
industrial area, waste rock storage areas and of ore) with those that do not have contact with the same 
infrastructure. 

The pit will in part be kept dry by means of underground water wells installed on its outer perimeter and partly 
by pumps installed at the bottom of it.  These waters from the bottom of the pit will be conveyed to the mining 
site's contact pond and will be treated, if necessary, before being released to the environment.  The 
groundwater pumped from the perimeter of the pit will be released to the environment in accordance with the 
capacities of the receiving environments. 

Surface waters that come into contact with mining infrastructures but have no potential for contamination, 
such as overburden and service road ditches, will not be captured, but passive means of controlling materials 
will be implemented during construction and operation in order to comply with the suspended solids (TSS) 
discharge standards. 

PIT DEWATERING 

The pit dewatering flow was estimated using the analytical equation presented by Marinelli and Niccoli (2000).  
This method uses the following parameters: 

— Hydraulic conductivity; 
— Influence of the pit; 
— Refill; 
— Area of the pit (use of the equivalent radius); 
— Hydraulic load. 

In total, four scenarios were defined for the estimation based on the following variables:  

— Depth of bottom of pit: maximum value and mean value; 
— Hydraulic conductivity (K): maximum value and mean value. 

The radius of influence was set at 3,000 m and the recharge was estimated by the equation.  For precipitation, a 
value of 700 mm / year corresponding to the average of the last 30 years was used.  Details of each scenario are 
presented in Table 20.3.

Table 20.3 Scenarios used to Estimate the Rate of Dewatering 

 

Dewatering flows with precipitation range from 41,680 to 61,483 m³ / d. Precipitation (700 mm / year) 
represents an increase in the dewatering rate of 2,672 m³ / d. 

Nine vertical pumps will be installed in wells around the pit to reduce water infiltration.  These pumps will be 
installed as the pit develops and the collected water will be used as site fresh water or discharged into Lakes 3 
or 7, while respecting their reception capacity. 

All the water pumped from the bottom of the pit will be sent to the equalization pond.  The effluent will be sent 
to a final processing unit.  Some of the treated water could be re-used as process water. 

RUN-OFF WATER FROM THE STOCKPILE AND THE INDUSTRIAL PAD 

Peripheral ditches will lead run-off to three basins (two at the waste rock pile and one being the equalization 
pond).  Table 18.1 presents the characteristics of the basins.  The water is then pumped or gravity-directed 
towards the Equalization Pond for treatment before discharge to the effluent. 

The collection ponds are planned to contain the flood of a 100-year recurrence project with a duration of 24 
hours (3.45 mm / h) in addition to the melting of over a period of 30 days (0.4 mm / h).  These collection ponds 
have a minimum free-board of 1 m. 

WATER TREATMENT PLANT 

The treatment plant will operate 24 hours / day for 365 days / year.  It can operate as well in temperature 
conditions ranging from -45 ° C to 30 ° C.  The plant will be located near the Equalization Pond located some 
100 m from the industrial pad.  The water treatment plant is required to treat run-off from tailings stockpiles, 
dry tailings, and for the pit dewatering. 

FINAL EFFLUENT 

The final effluent will be directed to Creek A via a channel.  This canal will display a width of 3 m at the base, a 
height of 2 m and a slope of 1.5H: 1V.  To protect the canal from erosion and for the purpose of stabilizing it, a 
stonework of 0-400 mm stones is provided on the walls and the bottom of the ditch.  A Manning coefficient of 
0.06 was used for ditch protection.

 RELATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS 
Meetings with the various local stakeholders were held within the scope of the Project.  Critical Elements and 
its representatives have had discussions with stakeholders since 2011, mainly with First Nations including the 
tallyman of the trapline on which the Project is located, the Ministère des Ressources naturelles (MRN), the 
MDDELCC, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, municipal governments including Eeyou Istchee 
Baie-James.   

Several meetings were held in the Eastmain community.  These were held in the context of ongoing discussion 
committee meetings, interviews for the documentation of Cree traditional knowledge and focus groups.  
Critical Elements is pursuing its regular practice of consulting and informing the communities. 

All those who spoke and made comments at the 'focus groups' days were in favour of the Project.  However, 
despite seeing positive aspects, some people mentioned concerns and expectations, mostly related to jobs, 
economic benefits, training and environmental impacts.  Also, an IBA is currently being negotiated with the 
Cree Nation and the Cree Community of Eastmain.  

Regular communications are maintained with the various government representatives, as the Project is going 
through various phases of its development.  Critical Elements will continue to actively engage the various 
stakeholders through all the coming development stages.  

 CLOSURE PLANNING 

20.5.1 PRELIMINARY MINE CLOSURE 

In accordance with provincial law, a closure and restoration plan should be prepared and approved by the 
Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MERN) in order for the mining lease to be issued by the MERN.  The 
mining lease is required for the mine's exploitation Certificate of Authorization (CoA) to be delivered by the 
Ministry of Durable Development, Environment and Climate Change (MDDELCC).  The closure guidelines and 
costs presented in this Technical Report are based on the mine closure guidebook published in November 2016 
by the Québec MERN entitled "Guide de préparation du plan de réaménagement et de restauration des sites miniers au 
Québec".  The guidelines and costs are preliminary and will be detailed during the preparation of the closure 
and restoration plan.  

The restoration work will include buildings dismantling, site safety, ground scarification and revegetation of 
impacted area such as the infrastructure's footprints, the access roads and the former ore stockpile that will be 
fully depleted.  Restoration work will also include re-profiling and revegetation of the overburden pile as well 
as the waste rock and dry tailing co-disposition pile.  It is important to note that the restoration cost estimate is 
made considering that the materials to be managed at the Project mine site will be non-acidic and 
non-leachable (Lamont, 2017). 

DISMANTLING BUILDINGS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURES 

Buildings and infrastructures specifically erected for the operation of the mine will be dismantled to retrofit 
the site to a state compatible with the surrounding environment.  Other infrastructures might be maintained 
for the benefit of the local communities.  The cost estimation considers that all building will be dismantled.  
The following buildings were considered:  

— Ore processing plant,

— Electric transport line,  
— Dome for dry tailings. 

Dismantling Work 

During the dismantling operations and disposal of the Project buildings, all buildings and surface 
infrastructures not required for the closure plan follow-up process should be taken apart by a certified 
contractor.  Waste material resulting from the dismantling operations will transported to authorized recycling 
points located in the southern part of the province.  During the dismantling operations of the buildings and 
surface infrastructures, restoration work should include the following activities: 

— Salvageable material and equipment should be set aside and then either given or sold to recycling points.  If 
members of the local population express an interest in these items, then Critical Elements should 
encourage the creation of an agency responsible to give a second life to these residual items.  

— Any process, production or service equipment, such as silos, reservoirs, tanks, pipes and pumps should be 
drained and cleaned.  The wash water should be collected for treatment (settling, water/oil separation if 
needed) before being discharged into the environment. 

— Any equipment containing oils or other potentially contaminating liquids such as electrical equipment and 
vehicles should be drained and cleaned before being discarded.  

— Management of chemical products, waste materials, and dangerous goods should be carried out safely 
according to regulations in effect.  All solids, liquids, pulps and sludges located inside the buildings should 
be characterized, if needed, and their disposal sites should be approved by the Project environment 
representative. 

— The walls and floors of the buildings should be cleaned, if needed, before the buildings are dismantled.  The 
wash water should be collected for treatment (settling, water/oil separation if needed) before being 
discharged into the environment. 

RESTORATION OF IMPACTED AREAS 

All impacted areas such as service and haulage roads, laydown areas, industrial work bay, ore pad as well as the 
various dismantled buildings footprint areas will be scarified to improve drainage and revegetation results.  
The scarification will be carried with a scraper box in order to rework the ground surface on a thickness of 
150 mm.  An overburden layer of 150 mm will then be placed on the restored ground before seeding.

OVERBURDEN PILE 

The MERN guidebook suggests the global stability of the piles should have a long term safety factor of 1.5.  The 
conceptual design of the overburden and waste piles were adjusted to meet this closure requirement.  Thus, 
minimum re-profiling will be required at closure. 

Approximately 10 % of the overburden pile will be used for the restoration works.  The area which will have 
been excavated for the restoration works will be re-profiled, in order to provide benches and slopes respecting 
the design for long term stability.  The pile will then be completely seeded.  

DRY TAILINGS AND WASTE ROCK CO-DEPOSITION PILE 

It is planned to spread overburden and seeds over the slope of first bench and on the top surface, above the last 
bench.  Overburden will also be spread on every flat surface between benches and trees will be planted. 

WATER MANAGEMENT 

As preliminary consideration, it is assumed that approximately 500 mm of sludge will be accumulated at the 
bottom of the water ponds.  Therefore, the cost for ponds restoration includes excavation and transportation of 
the sludge to the bottom of the pit.  The pond dykes will then be excavated and the material will be level out on 
the pond area. 

SITE SAFETY 

At closure, it is essential and mandatory that the site remains safe for the population.  It is planned to install 
blocks of waste rock around the open pit.  It was considered that a «Danger» sign will be installed every 30 m 
around the pit.  The overburden around the pit will be re-profiled to a slope of 3H:1V before being revegetated. 
Eventually, water will fill the pit and create a lake.  

HEAVY MOBILE AND STATIONARY SURFACE EQUIPMENT 

Whenever possible, heavy mobile and stationary surface equipment should be sold on the used equipment 
market.  The remaining unwanted equipment can be sold as scrap metal or disposed of at designated dump 
sites.  Heavy mobile and stationary surface equipment located in the open-pit should be hauled outside the pit, 
drained of any liquids, and tagged as either saleable or scrap.  Excessively worn or old parts should be sent to 
scrap metal recyclers or disposed of at designated dump sites. 

NEW AND USED CONTROLLED PRODUCTS 

Petroleum Products 

Petroleum products, fuels, diesel, oils and greases should be spent out at the end of the LOM.  Otherwise, they 
should be sold or given to the local communities.  Critical Elements should ensure that the persons to whom 
they give or sell these products will be able to handle them properly in compliance with the regulations in 
place. 

All petroleum products reservoirs and associated piping used on site to store should be drained, cleaned and 
dismantled.  Soils contiguous to the reservoirs or containers should be characterized and corrective measures 
should be taken in compliance with the Policy on the protection of soils and the rehabilitation of contaminated 
lands.

Chemical Products 

All reagents and other chemical products should be spent at the end of the LOM, except those required for 
water treatment during the environmental post-closure follow-up period.  Residual reagents and chemical 
products not required for that purpose should be put into properly labelled containers and transported to the 
southern region of the province of Québec for recycling at approved sites. 

Residual Dangerous Goods 

Management of residual dangerous goods is regulated and the disposal of such products must be done in 
compliance with the Regulations on dangerous goods of the Québec Law of the Quality of the Environment 
(LQE).  No residual hazardous materials shall be found on the Property after the cessation of the mining 
operations at the Project.  All used oils should be burnt as heating oil, and the other residual dangerous goods 
should be collected, packaged, labelled and transported to the southern region of the province of Québec for 
elimination at approved sites. 

Residual Non-Dangerous Materials 

Residual non-dangerous materials generated by the mining operations should be sorted out, recyclable 
materials should be sent to an authorized recycling facility, flammable materials should be burnt, and 
non-combustible materials and ashes should be transported to a dump site. 

SOILS AND CONTAMINATED MATERIALS 

As required by the regulation, at the cessation of mining activities the Property will be characterized and 
rehabilitated if the characterization study reveals present of contamination.  

Despite the measures that will be put in place by Critical Elements to minimize that risk, incidents associated 
with handling of petroleum products or other chemical products could to occur, especially at the following 
sites: 

— Petroleum products storage facility; 
— Point of use locations of petroleum products; 
— Reagents and chemical products storage facility; 
— Near plants and mechanical shops; 
— Near the concentrate loading station; 
— On the road linking the plant to the tailings disposal facility. 
 

As a preliminary consideration, the cost estimation considered that a surface area of 300 m2 of soil around the 
fuel tanks would have been contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons to a thickness of 50 cm.  It was 
considered to excavate and dispose of soils affected by petroleum hydrocarbons at an authorized site.  It was 
also considered that 15% of the industrial area will have been affected by metals up to 150 mm.  It is intended to 
relocate the soil affected by metals on the waste rock piles or in the pit. 

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE 

An amendment to Article 111 of the Regulation respecting Mineral Substances other than Petroleum, Natural 
Gas and Brine (Chapter M-13.1, r. 2) was adopted on July 23, 2013 (Decree 838-2013).  Thus, Critical Elements 
must now provide a financial guarantee whose amount corresponds to the total anticipated cost of completing 
all the work set forth in its rehabilitation and restoration plan.  The payment shall be provided in three 
installments constituting of 50%, 25% and 25% of the total restoration costs.

21 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
The Capital and Operating Costs section of the report is based on design criteria and engineering performed by 
the various QPs. Each QP contributed the cost information that is pertinent to their work. 

All capital works and the associated Capital Costs are at the Project proper.  No Capital costs for upgrading 
infrastructure off-site is included in this feasibility study. 

Sources for the Capital costs include vendor quotations, historical data, similar projects, CostMine information, 
and empirical factors. Hourly rate costs for installation of equipment and for rental of construction equipment 
were based on local rates.  

 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES 

21.1.1 RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX 

Responsibility for the cost estimates has been divided amongst the study contributors as follows: 

— WSP – General site infrastructures, including roads, earthworks, and buildings; power distribution; 
coordination with Hydro-Québec; surface water management Infrastructure; final effluent water 
treatment; process plant buildings and ancillary installations.  

— Bumigeme – Spodumene process plant including crushing section, tantalum recovery section including 
bagging system, spodumene recovery section, spodumene concentrate thickening and filtration, final 
tailings thickening, filtration and dry tailings. 

— InnovExplo – All pre-production mining related activities, such as overburden removal and the drilling, 
blasting, loading, and hauling of the rock material, as well as the purchase of the mining equipment. 

21.1.2 BASIS OF ESTIMATE 

The purpose of the Basis of Estimate is to describe the methodology used in the development of the Capital 
Expenditures (CAPEX) estimate. The CAPEX estimate has been structured based on the Work Breakdown 
Structure (WBS). The CAPEX estimate has been designed to provide the details required to convert the estimate 
into a cost control budget for project control purposes upon an investment decision by the Project Owners. The 
Base Date of the CAPEX estimate is Q2 2017. 

The accuracy of the estimate is ±15%, based on a global engineering completion of approximately 30% 
(Class 3 according to AACE 47r-11 recommended practice).  Please refer to Table 21.1 for the maturity level of 
infrastructure deliverables. 

The CAPEX estimate is assembled in Canadian dollars (CAN$) and all sales taxes are excluded from the estimate. 
No escalation factor was applied to equipment and material quotes received. For financial modelling purposes, 
estimates in local currencies have been time-phased separately for inclusion in the financial model, in order to 
be able to perform exchange rate sensitivities on the complete financial model.

21.1.5 BUDGETARY SUPPLY QUOTATIONS 

Each infrastructure package Request for Quotation (RFQ) was prepared with the following sections: 

— Instructions to Bidders; 
— Technical Specification Sheet, with a section to be completed by the vendor; 
— Scope of Supply; 
— Acknowledgment of Receipt Form; 
— Bid Form; 
— Reference Drawings and Documentation; 
— Site Conditions; 
— Package Dictionary. 
 

The vendors supplied a detailed price including delivery lead times and packing and transportation costs.  
Where applicable, the vendors also provided an estimate of installation hours/duration for both the 
installation and commissioning.  A bid analysis document was completed for each package, including the 
technical compliance, commercial analysis and recommendations.  The pricing recommendation for the CAPEX 
estimate was identified and selected in collaboration with Critical Elements. 

21.1.6 LABOUR HOURS 

Labour hours were estimated for all construction tasks.  If no hours were received with a quote, hours were 
estimated using experience from similar projects or handbooks.  Direct field supervision hours are included in 
the labour hours of each item and trades (foremen). 

A Productivity Factor adjustment of 1.21 was integrated to all disciplines labour hours to account for local site 
conditions such as Project location / size, labour availability, working schedule, workforce skills and 
availability, distance from camp to site, weather, working conditions, contract strategy, staff breaks, 
daily / weekly coordination and health and safety meetings. 

21.1.7 DIRECT LABOUR RATES 

WSP requested quotations for onsite installation work from local general contractors located in the James Bay 
area, or the adjoining area, to supply a weighted labour rate for each trade, considering 70 hours per week, 
14 days in / 14 days out schedule, supervisor/foreman, overtime, benefits, tools, individual protective 
equipment, transportation to site premium, insurances, contractor's administrative fees and profit.  A 20% 
indirect supervision factor was considered for the contractor's high-level project management team 
(construction supervisor, administrative clerk, procurement / logistics, HSSE agent, etc.) and also the required 
construction equipment supply / rental for each discipline (mobile and lifting equipment, expensive 
specialized tools).  The weighted average labour rates per discipline are outlined in Table 21.4.  

Room and board, mobilization / demobilization, field site temporary facilities, temporary construction 
infrastructures (scaffolding, platform, etc.), consumables (fuel, lubricant, etc.) and winter conditions are not 
included in these weighted complete hourly rates.  These costs are all included in the construction indirect 
costs.

21.1.8 MATERIAL TAKE-OFFS AND UNIT COSTS 

Material take-offs (MTOs) are based on neat quantities, with applied factors for waste and details not shown in 
actual documentation.  However, no design growth factor was applied on these quantities.  

21.1.9 EARTHWORKS 

Earthwork quantities are generated from grading designs using Autodesk Civil 3D 2017 software.  Excavation of 
topsoil and allowances for rock excavation/drill and blast are based on the preliminary geotechnical 
information from boreholes and test pits performed on site. 

Unit costs were established based on past project productivity and references, such as the Caterpillar 
performance handbook.  Cost of operated machinery was based on the rates of the Taux de location de machinerie 
lourde avec opérateur published by the Centre de services partagés du Québec for the year 2017.  This reference 
recommends using a 10% overhead on equipment rental cost for works north of the 49th parallel when 
compared to rates used in southern Québec.  Those rates include the cost of rental, operation (oil and gas), and 
the operator man-hour.  Aggregate prices are based on prices taken from Wemindji Paving, a local contractor 
specialized in paving and aggregate production.  

Buried services (potable water, fire water, fresh water, natural gas, and sewage) piping length, and valve 
quantities were based on conceptual designs, which identify pipe sizes and routing.  Piping characteristics were 
calculated from required flows for each building and material selected according to the fluid requirement. 

It is assumed in the civil works estimations that the pad around the building area is brought to the subgrade 
line level.  The additional excavation and backfill quantities required for the foundations and the installation of 
a building were calculated separately from the pad and were associated to this building. 

The key assumptions are as follows. 

— Overburden stockpile located in a mean radius of 1 km from the construction. 
— A layer of organic matter of 250 mm (average) was considered. 
— Cut and fill activities include excavation of second-class material, haulage within 500 m from its point of 

origin, and reuse in the backfill of roads or pads below the infrastructure line. 
— Excavation activities include excavation of second-class material and haulage within 1,000 m from its point 

of origin.

— If muck is used for the backfill, no cost was considered, since doing a mass backfill with muck is comparable 
to the disposal in a waste dump by the mining contractor. 

— Timber cut during deforestation will not be sold to the neighbouring forest companies. 
— A return period of 1/10 years was used for rainfall and drainage design.  
— No pavement is required on site. 

21.1.10 CONCRETE 

Concrete material take-offs were done using two methods:  detailed design for each building for the majority of 
concrete items, and ratio-comparison estimation from previous projects for certain smaller concrete items. 

The first method, detailed design, follows the normal procedure used for detailed engineering.  The first step is 
to obtain the load at the support from the steel structure modelling software (Graitec's Advance Design 
America) used to design the structural steel for all the surface buildings.  The support is a node that is generally 
located at the base of a column and supports the loads that are transmitted by the columns to the foundation.  
These loads (compression, traction, and lateral loads) are used for the design of the pier and footing.  The pier 
dimensions are adjusted according to the steel column above.  The footing dimensions are determined 
according to the bearing capacity of the soil and CSA standard requirements.  

Once the dimensions and internal reinforcements have been calculated, the quantities are extracted for cost 
estimation purposes.  A waste factor of 5% was added to the neat calculated quantities.  The concrete strength 
used in the estimate is 30 MPa, while 25 MPa was used for slabs-on-grade. 

Unit costs associated with concrete construction were established according to quotations obtained from a 
specialized contractor and validated based upon previous similar projects.  Man-hours dedicated to each task 
for concrete preparation (formwork, foundation wall, slab, etc.) were also validated from specialized 
contractors' data.  Suggested man-hours include reinforcing bars cutting and folding and staff breaks on site 
during construction. 

Concrete will be supplied by a contractor with a mixing plant based on a cost of 276 $/m³, including crushed 
stone and sand provided nearby. 

21.1.11 STRUCTURE AND ARCHITECTURE 

Structural steel material take-offs were done using two methods: mostly through detailed design of each 
building and through the comparison to historical projects for smaller structures (staircases, handrails, etc.).  
Graitec's Advance Design America was used to model the structure for this Project.  Once the structural framing 
established, the equipment loads and floor loading specified in the design criteria were added to the model.  

Several analyses were conducted in order to select the shape of steel that is the most adequate to the 
application.  The load limit for beams and columns is 80 to 90%.  Whenever possible, material optimization was 
conducted for static loads, but no dynamic analysis was performed.   

Architecture unit costs were prepared by an architect from Architecture49 based on building's design criteria, 
budget cost quotations to vendors and the database of similar projects. The architect also conducted a Building 
Code analysis on the general arrangement to validate safety issues and fireproofing requirements.

21.1.12 HVAC 

The methodology for estimating the building mechanics (ventilation, heating, air conditioning and plumbing) 
was based on a conceptual design.  Major equipment costs were obtained from quotations from suppliers.  
Smaller equipment cost information was based on previous similar projects.  

21.1.13 ELECTRICAL AND INSTRUMENTATION 

Budget quotations were obtained for major electrical distribution and main electrical substation material.  
Cable sizing and lengths were estimated based on the Feasibility Study's General Arrangements.  A waste of 
10 m was considered for each power and control cable. 

Man-hours for the installation of the equipment, services, grounding, cable trays, and cables were based on an 
estimation book edited by the Corporation des maîtres électriciens du Québec ["Guild of Master Electricians of 
Québec"] (Antoine Poggi, 2006). 

21.1.14 FACTORS APPLIED TO DIRECT COSTS 

The following direct cost factors were considered and applied as described below. 

— Design growth – not factored on direct costs, design growth is considered a component of contingency in 
indirect costs. 

— Construction waste – there was some allowance for waste added to industrial material direct cost estimated 
by WSP in the process plant – e.g.  5% for concrete, 10 m for each electrical cable and cable tray material, 
5% for piping material. 

— Productivity factor – as described in the hourly rates section above. 
— Seasonal influence – there was no cost added in direct costs for seasonal influence. 

21.1.15 ESTIMATE EXCLUSIONS 

The following costs are not included in the CAPEX estimate. 

— Schedule delays and/or associated costs, such as those caused by: 
— unexpected site conditions; 
— unidentified ground conditions; 
— labour disputes; 
— force majeure; 
— permit applications; 

— Foreign currency changes from Project exchange rates. 
— Economy factors/pressure on labour productivity (less skilled workforce).

 INDIRECT CAPITAL COSTS 

21.3.1 BASIS OF ESTIMATE FOR INDIRECT CAPITAL COSTS 

SUMMARY OF INDIRECT CAPITAL COSTS 

The indirect Capital cost covers for administration and overhead, project development, and EPCM and other

— EPCM cost is based on a factor of 12% on all construction estimates with the exception of pre-production 
excavations which will be managed by the pre-production mining team, and Hydro-Québec costs related to 
the displacement of the high-voltage power line and power supply preparations which they will manage. 

— The Critical Element's EPCM oversight team costs are based on labour requirements and associated costs. 
— Spare parts and freight are based on a factor on materials and equipment.  Spare parts and freight for the 

mining equipment are included in the equipment purchase costs. 

21.3.2 CONTINGENCY 

A provision of $31.0M is included in the initial capital for contingency, based on the level of development stage 
of the Project. 

In order to meet the budget established for the Project in this estimate, it is expected that sufficiently 
developed engineering, adequate project management, realistic construction schedule and appropriate 
controls will be implemented. 

21.3.3 MINE REHABILITATION BOND 

The total estimated mine rehabilitation cost for the life of mine is $18.8M.  According to the environmental 
regulations of the Province of Québec, 50% of this amount is to be paid to a reserve fund as one of the 
conditions to obtain the mining lease.  The remaining 50% is to be paid to the fund in two instalments of 25% 
each. 

The rehabilitation fund may be replaced by a bond issued by a reputable insurance company.  Critical Elements 
will obtain a bond to secure its rehabilitation obligations toward the Province of Québec.  The cost of the bond 
during the pre-production period is estimated to be $180,000. 

 MINING CAPITAL COSTS 
Capital costs directly related to the mining operation were estimated by InnovExplo.  Capital cost estimates are 
based on budgetary quotes for major mining equipment.  Mill start-up defines the beginning of the production 
period.  The Capital cost estimate for the pre-production period is $32.1M, and $76.6M for the production 
period, for a total of $108.7M over the mine life.  Table 21.18 presents the mining Capital costs. 

Table 21.18 Mining Capital Costs 

Mining Capital Cost Items ($M) Pre-Production Ongoing Total 

Pre-Production Work $19.2 $0.0 $19.2 

Equipment Purchases $12.9 $76.6 $89.5 

TOTAL $32.1 $76.6 $108.7 

 

The cost of pre-production work is $19.2M.  This includes all mining operations during the 19 months of 
pre-production, such as overburden removal, drilling, blasting, loading and hauling of all rock material, and all 
other auxiliary work.  This cost includes the mobilization of a mining contractor for the removal of overburden.

Equipment purchases total $89.5M of which $12.9M is incurred in the pre-production period.  This cost includes 
all the main mining equipment (i.e.  trucks, drills, excavators, etc.) and all the support equipment (i.e.  pick-up 
trucks, pumps, cables and sub-station for the electric front shovel, tower lights, etc.). 

Table 21.19 presents the purchasing and replacement schedule for all the main mining equipment.  The 
equipment purchases are incurred in the year the equipment is needed.  These costs are not depreciated over 
time and do not consider a salvage value at the end of equipment life.  No contingencies were considered for 
the purchase prices.  During the negotiation process for the purchase of the equipment, it could be 
advantageous to consider a financing plan to spread out these costs over time.

— The Overburden Removal category has been separated from the rest of the mining activities as it will be 
executed by a mining contractor with its own mining fleet and support staff. 

— The General and Management category mainly include all supervision and management related salaries 
and benefits. 

All categories also include other lesser costs, such as light vehicle repairs and registration, personal protective 
equipment, office supplies, etc. 

A detailed list of the manpower requirements is presented in Table 21.23.  This list does not include contractor 
personnel. 

For the salaries and benefits, a northern allowance and a production bonus, each equivalent to 5% of the base 
salary, were considered as the Project is remote and employees will be lodged on site.  The fringe benefits were 
estimated at 30% of the base salary to cover all health plans, while paid holidays were estimated at 6% of the 
base salary.  Some overtime and yearly bonuses were also considered and vary based on the position.  These 
salaries and benefits were compared to similar projects.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 

 INTRODUCTION 
An engineering economic model was prepared for the Project to estimate annual cash flows and assess 
sensitivities to certain economic parameters.  The economic results of this report are based upon the 
engineering performed by WSP, Bumigeme Inc., InnovExplo, and Critical Elements.  

The Project includes an open pit mine, a spodumene plant for the recovery of spodumene concentrate and 
tantalum concentrate, surface infrastructure to support the mine and mill operations (maintenance and office 
facilities), water management features, and a tailings storage facility. 

The Project indicates an after-tax cash flow of $1,567 million, after-tax NPV (8%) of $726 million and after-tax IRR 
of 34.9%.  The project is most sensitive to Lithium concentrate commodity prices and currency exchange rates.

 PRINCIPAL ASSUMPTIONS 
The cash flow estimate includes only revenue, costs, duties and taxes, and other factors applicable to the 
Project.  Corporate obligations, financing costs, sunk costs, and taxes at the corporate level are excluded. 

The model was prepared from mining schedules estimated on an annual basis.  The cash flow model was based 
on the following: 
— All costs are reported in Canadian dollars (CAN$) and referenced as '$', unless otherwise stated. 
— One hundred percent (100%) equity basis. 
— No cost escalation beyond 2017. 
— No provision for effects of inflation. 
— Constant 2017 dollar analysis. 
— The economic analysis consists of the technical assumptions outlined in the previous sections, together 

with the economic assumptions and estimated Capital and Operating costs described in Section 21. 
— The economic analysis is based on Critical Elements' preferred scenario of selling three products: 

— A chemical grade lithium concentrate: 
— 75% of lithium production; 
— 90% recovery; 
— 5.0% Li2O concentrate grade; 
— 750 US$/t concentrate. 

— A technical grade lithium concentrate: 
— 25% of lithium production; 
— 87.3% recovery; 
— 6.0% Li2O concentrate grade; 
— 1500 US$/t concentrate. 

— A tantalum concentrate: 
— 40% recovery; 
— 20% Ta2O5 concentrate grade; 
— 130 US$/kg Ta2O5 contained. 

— A constant exchange rate assumption of 1 US$: 1.33 CAN$ (1 CAN$: 0.75 US$) was used in the economic 
analysis.  

— Exploration costs are deemed outside of the project. 
— Any additional project study costs have not been included in the analysis.  
— Reclamation costs and requirements for a reclamation bond have been estimated and included in the 

economic analysis.  The bond would likely be secured with insurance or similar financial instrument at 
some annual cost.  Costs of financing the bond have been estimated at annual costs of 2% of the remaining 
balance.

 TAXES AND ROYALTIES 

22.4.1 DUTIES AND TAXES 

The Project has been evaluated on an after-tax basis.  It must be noted that there are many potential complex 
factors that affect the taxation of a mining project.  The taxes, depletion, and depreciation calculations in the 
FS economic analysis are simplified and only intended to give a general indication of the potential tax 
implications.  

The Project will be subject to the following taxes as they relate to the Project: 

— A federal income tax rate of 15%. 
— A provincial corporate income tax rate ranging from 11.8% (in 2017) to 11.5% (in 2020 and thereafter). 
— A provincial mining tax rate from 16% to 24% depending on the profit margin of the year. 

Processing Allowance 

A company is entitled to deduct a processing allowance in the calculation of its mining profit.  Basically, this 
deduction corresponds to 10% of the original value of an asset used in the ore processing. 

Depreciation Allowance   

A company may claim a depreciation allowance on an asset used in the mining operations at the declining rate 
of 30%. 

22.4.2 ROYALTIES 

The Project royalties are described in Section 4.  One percent (1%) will be purchased before the start of 
production and will be paid for with shares, therefore no cash disbursement.  A 1% NSR royalty is included in 
the cash flow model. 

 ECONOMIC RESULTS, BASE CASE 
The results are derived from the Life-of-Mine schedule presented in Section16, the recovery method are 
discussed in Section 17, and Capital and Operating costs are presented in Section 21.  Table 22.2 summarizes the 
cost inputs for the Economic Analysis.  

Figure 22.1 shows the cash flow model results.  The cash flow is presented in Table 22.3.

 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, PRE-TAX BASIS 
The pre-tax cash flow was evaluated for sensitivity to commodity prices, currency exchange rates, Capital 
expenditures, and Operating costs.  All sensitivities were analyzed as mutually exclusive variations. 

The project's pre-tax NPV was most sensitive to the factors impacting revenue, that is, Li2O commodity pricing, 
Li2O metal recovery, and currency exchange rate.  Figures 22.2 and 22.3 and Tables 22.5 to 22.10 summarize the 
pre-tax sensitivity results.

23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
The Property is almost completely surrounded by land held by companies or prospectors.  The only contiguous 
areas available for staking are to the west of the Property and at its southern end, as well as an isolated block 
within the Property. 

Table 23.1 lists the immediately adjacent claim holders of the Property, and Figure 23.1 presents their location.  
A preliminary review of the entities listed in Table 23.1 showed that none have reported work on their claims. 

The Nemaska Lithium Whabouchi Project (www.nemaskalithium.com) and the Galaxy Resource James Bay 
project (www.galaxylithium.com) are not "adjacent" to the Project.  However, given the nature of their work, it 
is worth mentioning that both companies have disclosed Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves, for their 
respective spodumene-bearing pegmatites projects on SEDAR. 

The Whabouchi Project is an open pit lithium project currently being developed by Nemaska Lithium Inc.  It is 
located 45 km south-east of the Property, and contains mineral reserves consisting of 20.0 Mt grading 
1.53% Li2O (Met-Chem, 2016).  

The James Bay Lithium Project , owned by Galaxy Resources Limited, is located about 70 km northwest of the 
Property and contains Indicated Mineral Resources of 11.8 Mt grading 1.30% Li2O and Inferred Mineral 
Resources of 10.5 Mt grading 1.20% Li2O (SRK, 2010).

24 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND 
INFORMATION 

 IMPLEMENTATION 
The Project implementation schedule covers all the areas of the Project and includes the engineering, 
procurement, permitting, construction, and commissioning of the facilities, and pre-production excavations.  
The facilities include the main electrical station, 315 kV power line displacement, the process plant, and site 
infrastructure.  

The Project schedule assumes environmental certificates of authorization and the mining lease will be obtained 
in due time.  The planned mill start-up is planned for April 2020.  Figure 24.1 presents a summary of the Project 
Schedule. 

The EIA was submitted to the Canadian and the province of Québec's environmental regulation bodies on 
July 28, 2017.  While the EIA is being reviewed, the Project will proceed to detailed engineering, contracting of 
construction services, procurement of long-lead items, and necessary permitting to be in a state of readiness 
when the environmental certificates of authorization are granted.  Detailed engineering will begin soon after 
the completion of the FS.  Mine site construction work is scheduled to begin in October 2018.  The mill start-up 
is scheduled for April 2020 and will ramp up over 6 months.  

Critical Elements will have an Owner's team to manage the detailed engineering, procurement, and 
construction.  It will contract consultants to conduct the detailed engineering for each discipline, as required. 

The Project will require a camp of 575 rooms during the construction period and 300 rooms during production.  
Camp and associated services will be provided locally.  Negotiations are under way with local vendors.  The 
camp will be available and functional in time for the start of mine site construction.  The camp will have a 
kitchen and recreational area to accommodate the Project construction phase. 

Hydro Québec has confirmed that the 315 kV power line section passing over the mine site can be re-located 
and provide power in time for mill commissioning.  The construction work will be powered by diesel 
generators until electricity is available from the Hydro Québec power grid.  Hydro Québec is conducting a 
technical study regarding the displacement of the power line and the supply of electrical power. 

Delivery periods were requested from suppliers for major equipment. The delivery periods for such items as 
the crushers, the ball mill, conveyors, etc. ranged between 20 and 32 weeks.  These deliveries were taken in 
consideration for the implementation schedule.  Long lead items will be procured early to ensure delivery 
corresponds with the implementation schedule. 

Mine construction priority will be given to site preparation and installation of temporary infrastructure to 
initiate the mill construction as early as possible.  Temporary roads will be established using exploration roads, 
the industrial pad will be cleared and leveled, and excavation of waste material from the starter pit will be 
initiated early to provide aggregates for the infrastructure.  When mill construction has begun, permanent 
roads and other items may be initiated. 

The starter pit pre-production excavation will total 3.9M tonnes. While the overburden will be excavated by a 
contractor, the rock will be excavated by a small mining crew and minimal mining equipment. This will permit 
establishing a competent mining team prior to start of production.

 PROJECT RISKS  
As with all mining projects, there are technical risks that could affect the technical feasibility and economic 
outcome of the Project.  At the feasibility stage, this Project has reasonably reduced the uncertainties and 
validated baseline assumptions.  The remaining risks are considered to be manageable during the next phases 
of the Project.  These risks are common to most mining projects, many of which can be mitigated with adequate 
engineering, planning, and pro-active management. 

External risks are, to a certain extent, beyond the control of the Project proponents and are much more 
difficult to anticipate and mitigate, although, in many instances, some risk reduction can be achieved.  External 
risks are things such as the political situation in the Project region, mineral price, exchange rate, and 
government legislation.  These external risks are generally applicable to all mining projects.  Negative variance 
to these items from the assumptions made in the economic model would reduce the profitability of the mine 
and the mineral resource estimates. 

During the Feasibility Study project, a risk identification template was submitted to all QP's to be filled in with 
three of their respective high-level critical risks.  The tables were then compiled by the Project Integrator.  
Table 24.1 identifies what is currently deemed to be the most significant technical project risks, the potential 
effects, the proposed mitigation approach, and the action to be taken in order to address the risk at the correct 
time. 

This initial project risk register should be revisited, reviewed and updated at each stage gate of the Project 
(i.e. detailed engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, etc.).  Further, it is recommended that as 
the Project develops, additional risk workshops be held to access different levels of risk such as HAZOP and 
field risks. 

 PROJECT OPPORTUNITIES 
Although only open pit mining has been evaluated in this study, underground mining could be an option to 
mine deeper portions of the mineralized zones.  Many zones, especially Zone 115 from which most of the ore in 
the pit comes from, are known to continue outside the pit boundaries.

Mining 1 Underground 
water 
infiltration 

High levels of water 
infiltrating into the 
pit. 

The presence of large 
quantities of water 
near the pit and 
several fractured 
zones in the pit could 
allow great quantities 
of water to inflow. 

Flooding of pit, pit 
wall instability, loss 
of production, 
potential health 
and safety hazard. 

Hydrogeological study is 
necessary to better understand 
the flow of all sources of water 
on and around the site. 

2 Dilution and 
mining 
recovery 

Excess dilution or 
poor ore mining 
recovery due to 
improper mining 
methods. 

Poor drilling and 
blasting practices, 
poor follow-up from 
the geology 
department, and 
inefficient shovel 
operators can lead to 
both excess waste 
material being sent 
to the mill and ore 
being sent to the 
waste stockpile. 

Higher costs, lost 
revenue. 

- Testing in-pit to improve drill 
and blast parameters (blast 
patterns, timing, etc.). 
- Use of blast monitoring 
technology to follow the heave 
of the blast. 
- Training geology technicians 
to properly guide the 
operations for the ore calls. 
- Train the shovel operators to 
be as efficient and precise as 
possible. 

3 Faults and 
other 
destabilizing 
geological 
structures 

Pit walls becoming 
unstable due to 
faults and other 
geological structures. 

Insufficient 
knowledge of all 
geotechnical 
parameters, lack of 
follow-up by the 
engineering team 
with regards to 
geomechanics 
during excavation. 

Potential health 
and safety risk for 
workers in the pit, 
loss of equipment, 
excessive 
rehabilitation 
generating delays 
and costs, loss of 
production. 

- Gather more geotechnical 
information. 
- Create a policy for declaring 
all potential geotechnical 
hazards. 
- Ensure the engineering team 
has the right training and tools 
to follow the evolution of the 
pit with regards to 
geotechnical stability.

25 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 

 MINERAL RESSOURCE ESTIMATE 
InnovExplo validated drilling procedures and sample preparation, including a QA/QC protocol, for 255 holes 
drilled by Critical Elements since 2009 at the Project as well as the assay results obtained by ALS Laboratory and 
found Critical Elements' database for the Project to be valid and reliable. A subset of 202 holes cut across the 
mineralized zones of the Rose deposit. 

Given the density of the processed data, the search ellipse criteria, the drillhole density and the specific 
interpolation parameters, InnovExplo is of the opinion that the current mineral resource estimate can be 
classified as Indicated and Inferred resources.  The estimate was prepared in accordance with CIM's standards 
and guidelines for reporting mineral resources and reserves.  This is the most recent Mineral Resources 
estimate for the Project and it comprises Indicated Mineral Resources of 31.9 Mt grading 0.93% Li2O and 
148 ppm Ta2O5 and Inferred Mineral Resources of 2.8 Mt grading 0.82% Li2O and 145 ppm Ta2O5 using $30 NSR 
per tonne cut-off for the open-pit mine and $110 NSR cut-off for the underground mine. 

The effective date of the estimate is August 29, 2017, based on compilation status, metal price parameters, and 
metallurgical recovery inputs. 

 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
The objective of achieving a spodumene concentrate with a minimum grade of 6.0% Li2O was achieved during a 
series of metallurgical testing program at SGS Canada in Lakefield.  

The spodumene plant is designed to process 1 610 000 tonnes of ore per year to produce 199,117 tonnes of 
spodumene concentrate with a chemical grade lithium concentrate of 5.0% Li2O with a recovery over 90% or a 
technical grade lithium concentrate of 6.0% with a recovery over 87%. 

Tantalum will be recovered as a by-product.  

The flowsheet selected includes three-stage conventional crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, mica 
flotation, spodumene flotation, spodumene concentrate and tantalum concentrate thickening, filtering, drying 
and spodumene and tantalum concentrates storage and shipping.  

Bumigeme concludes that the Project is technically feasible as well as economically viable for moving it to the 
detailed engineering followed by construction.  

 MINERAL RESERVE STATEMENT 
The Mineral Reserves estimate (Table 25.1) for the Project was prepared by Mr. Patrick Frenette, P.Eng, an 
employee of InnovExplo Inc. and is effective as of August 4, 2017.  The Mineral Reserves estimate stated herein 
is consistent with the CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves and is suitable for public 
reporting. As such, the Mineral Reserves are based on Measured and Indicated Resources, and do not include 
any Inferred Resources. Measured and Indicated Resources are inclusive of Proven and Probable Reserves.

prepared by InnovExplo, with the exception that a constant mill recovery is used. The effects of using a 
constant recovery were found to not materially affect the results of the FS. As of the date of this report, the QP 
has not identified any risks, legal, political, or environmental, that would materially affect potential 
development of the Mineral Reserves.

Notes: 

— The Independent and Qualified Person for the Mineral Reserve Estimate, as defined by NI 43 101, is Patrick 
Frenette, P.Eng, M.Sc.A, of InnovExplo Inc.  

— The effective date of the Mineral Reserves estimate is August 4, 2017. 
— The reserve estimate is based on the current resource estimate with the exception of a constant recovery of 

85% Li2O. Metal prices are set at US$15,000/t Li2O and US$130$/kg Ta2O5 using an exchange rate of 
1.25 CA$:US$. Metallurgical recoveries set constant at 85% for Li2O and 64% for Ta2O5. The cut-off NSR value 
of CA$29.70/t. 

— The model includes 17 mineralized zones. 
— Calculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and ppm). 
— The number of metric tons was rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to 

rounding effects. Rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101. 
— InnovExplo is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-

political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the Mineral Reserve Estimate. 

 MINING METHODS 
The Rose deposit is made of stacked mineralized lenses oriented N296° with an average dip of 15° to the 
northeast (varying locally between 5° and 25°).  The orebody is relatively flat and close to the surface, so the FS 
is based entirely on an open pit operation. 

A conventional truck and shovel mining method is proposed to mine 220.2 Mt of material over the mine life, 
comprising 26.8 Mt of ore, 182.4 Mt of waste and 11.0 Mt of overburden, for an average stripping ratio of 7.2:1.  
This FS is based on a milling capacity of 4,600 tonnes of ore per day (tpd) and 350 operating days.  To achieve 
these milling production targets, the yearly mining production rate will vary accordingly between 12 and 16 Mt 
of rock material.  All overburden material will be mined by a contractor.  The open pit mining schedule resulted 
in a LOM of approximately 19 years, starting with 19 months of pre-production, just over 16 years of 
production, and ending with 5 months of stockpile processing.  The mine plan includes four different phases to 
delay overburden removal, to keep the ore extraction rate relatively constant, and to improve mill feed grade 
in the first years of the Project.

 GEOTECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The pit design for the Project is based on single benching with 10-m bench heights.  This bench height was 
selected based on the loading and hauling equipment that would best suit the mining operation.  The 
geotechnical report recommends an inter-ramp angle of 57° and an overall pit slope angle of 55°. 

 FINAL PIT DESIGN 

The final pit design is based on the selected optimized pit shell and geotechnical parameters.  The pit design 
includes haulage ramp access to all benches, except for the final bench which will be excavated via a temporary 
ramp. 

 MINING PHASE DESIGN 

Based on the Whittle pit shell optimizations, three nesting intermediate pit shells were used as guidelines to 
design the mining phases.  By subdividing the ultimate pit into these four separate phases, the ore mining rate 
is kept relatively constant. The selection of these mining phases results in a low production rate for the pre-
production period and improves the mill feed grade in the first years of the Project. 

 MINE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 

The life-of-mine plan (LOM) for the Project is based on an ore processing rate of 1,610,000 t per calendar year. 
The LOM plan was prepared to supply the required ore quantities to the mill while reducing the overall 
quantities of material to be mined, and to send higher grade ore to the mill in the first years of operation.  

 WASTE ROCK, OVERBURDEN, AND TAILINGS MANAGEMENT 

Two stockpiles have been designed to store mining waste. One large waste rock stockpile is located directly to 
the west of the pit and near the main ramp exit, and one overburden stockpile is located south of the pit. 

The waste rock pile will be constructed in two phases. A co-deposition strategy will be used to store dry tailings 
from the mill and mined waste rock on the same pile. 

 MINING EQUIPMENT 

Based on the production targets and operational constraints, the loading fleet comprise a 7.4 m3 backhoe 
excavator for ore handling, a 15 m3 electric hydraulic front shovel for waste rock handling, and a 13.8 m3 
production wheel loader for operational flexibility.  

The ore mined from the pit will be hauled by a maximum of seven ±65t payload trucks while, while waste 
mining, dry tailings transport and reclaimed ore will be hauled by a maximum of seven ±135t payload trucks. 

Most production drilling will occur in waste as the strip ratio for the project is high.  Two high capacity rotary 
diesel blasthole drills are dedicated to drilling waste panels, whereas drilling in ore panels will be performed by 
a down-the-hole drill rig. The down-the-hole drill is also suited to perform pre-splitting of the final walls. 
During the pre-production period, this drill will also perform all drilling in waste panels.

 MANPOWER 

A total of 199 employees will be needed at the peak of mining operations, not including contractors. This 
manpower requirement is based on an operation that runs 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and 350 days 
per year. 

As the site is remotely located, the working schedule for all employees will be a fly-in/fly-out rotation of two 
working weeks and two rest weeks, for 12 hours each day. 

 SPODUMENE PROCESS PLANT 

The objective of achieving a spodumene concentrate with a minimum grade of 6.0% Li2O was achieved during a 
metallurgical testing program at SGS Canada in Lakefield.  

The spodumene plant is designed to process 1 610 000 tonnes of ore per year to produce 199 117 tonnes of 
spodumene concentrate with a chemical grade lithium concentrate of 5.0% Li2O with a recovery over 90% or a 
technical grade lithium concentrate of 6.0% with a recovery over 87%.  Tantalum will be recovered as a by-product.  

The flowsheet selected includes three-stage conventional crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, mica flotation, 
spodumene flotation, spodumene concentrate and tantalum concentrate thickening, filtering, drying and 
spodumene and tantalum concentrates storage and shipping.  

Bumigeme concludes that the Project is technically feasible as well as economically viable for moving it to the 
detailed engineering followed by construction.  

 ENVIRONMENT 
The Environmental Impact Study has taken into account Environmental and Social Baseline and the Project 
Description to evaluate the impacts.   Consultations were held with the First Nations, and Critical Elements enjoys 
ongoing good relationships with its stakeholders.  No major environmental issue was raised in the Impact 
Study.   Critical Elements has submitted its Impact Study to both provincial and federal authorities, and will 
receive questions and comments as part of the Environmental Evaluation Processes.  Once the provincial and 
federal administrators have issued Authorizations for Project Development, final permits will be sought from the 
MDDELCC, DFO, MERN, and all relevant other authorities. 

 ECONOMICS 
Based on the study results, the conclusions are as follows: 

— The overall economic results indicate that the Project will have positive economic returns and generate 
approximately $1,567 million net after-tax cash flow ($2,567 million pre-tax) over the Project's 17-year mine life. 

— Total capital requirements for the Project have been estimated at approximately $341 million prior to the 
commencement of concentrate production.  With approximately $127 million required as sustaining capital 
over the remaining life of the Project.  These are inclusive of contingency. 

— Total Operating expenses over the life of the mine are estimated to be approximately $1,785 million or $66.56 
per tonne milled or $458 per tonne of Li2O concentrate. 

— At the base case metal prices, the Project's post-tax net present value is estimated at approximately 
$726 million at a discount rate of 8%.  The post-tax IRR is estimated at 35% and payback has been calculated at 
2.8 years.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 

 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
InnovExplo recommends that Critical Element considers additional drilling on the JR, Pivert, Pivert-East, Pivert 
South and Helico showings, and perhaps West-Ell, to determine their potential.  Drilling a stratigraphic fence 
NE and SW of the Rose deposit should also be considered in order to potentially identify other mineralized 
structures associated with Rose.  The portion between the Rose area and the JR area should be prioritized as the 
author believes the potential to fill this area with new zones is high.  Apart from immediately drilling the 
known mineralized pegmatites, a creek-sediment geochemical survey and a visual satellite photo 
reconnaissance program covering the entire property could be the first step in determining which portions of 
the property should be investigated more closely.  Based on the results, systematic geological survey grids 
should be established and geochemistry rock samples collected. 

— Regional survey ($650,000):  Systematic grids should be ground prospected on the large and relatively 
unexplored Property.  Using a 100-m grid, samples of every outcropping intrusion should be assayed in 
order to identify their fertility.  Every pegmatite should be sampled regardless of any pre-defined grid.  
Creek sediments could also be collected and assayed. It is estimated that a total of 35 days with four 
prospectors would be needed. 

— Drilling on showings other than Rose ($750,000):  The objective of drilling on showings other than Rose 
is to continue to investigate their potential extensions laterally and at depth. Positive results from drilling 
will potentially lead to a resource estimate on these showings. A total of 5,000 metres in approximately 
50 holes is recommended at this stage for the best targets.  

— Drilling new regional exploration targets on the Property ($360,000):  Drilling should be considered for 
any new mineralization recognized during the regional survey presented above.  The number of metres will 
be determined by the number of targets, but InnovExplo estimates approximately 1,500 metres in ±15 holes 
for drilling the best targets in a first Phase.  

 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
The process flowsheet selected for spodumene recovery is robust based on the results of bench scale 
metallurgical tests and proven technology.  Lithium recovery over 90% at a chemical grade of 5.0% Li2O or a 
technical grade lithium concentrate of 6.0% Li2O with a recovery over 87% could be produced at a head grade 
of 0.85% Li2O. 

Bumigeme Inc. considers that the Project is technically and economically feasible and recommends that the 
Project move forward to the next engineering phase.  

To improve tantalite grade up to 20% Ta with decent Ta recovery, more bench scale test work is necessary in 
this direction. 

Further, the Project could become more viable economically by producing mica, feldspar and silica as by-
products.

 MINING OPERATIONS 
Although InnovExplo considers this FS complete and based on sufficient information, some aspects require 
further studies.  While such information is not expected to have a significant impact on the Project, it will be 
needed for the detailed engineering phase.  The main issues that need further investigation are the following. 

— Several risks identified in the geotechnical study, including the fact that analyses conducted by Mine 
Design Engineering Inc. consider only dry pit slope conditions.  Once a hydrogeological model for the site is 
completed, the results should be sent to the firm for re-assessment.  Moreover, joint persistence should be 
investigated more thoroughly when excavating the mine.  

— The 30-metre perimeter used as an exclusion zone around Lake #3 and whether it is sufficient to avoid 
water infiltrating the pit.  Hydrogeological and geotechnical studies will be required. 

— The operational efficiency and geotechnical stability of the co-deposition strategy to store both dry tailings 
and mine waste rock. 

— The mine dewatering needs once the hydrogeological model of the site is completed. 
— The thickness of the overburden over the entire pit area and any adjustments to the mine design that 

would arise from such findings. 

 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
The following actions and studies are recommended prior to or during the surface infrastructure detailed 
engineering mandate. 
— Confirm electricity supply and 315 kV line relocation contract with Hydro-Québec. 
— Confirm LNG supply contract and reserve expected volumes with Gaz Metro. 
— Establish detailed waste and dry tailings co-deposition plan with mining plan and process plant production 

schedule. 
— Conduct an additional phase of geotechnical investigation along with an extensive laboratory program at 

major infrastructure locations to confirm bedrock depth and bearing capacity thus allowing optimization 
of roads, concrete, pads and stockpiles. 

— Establish characterization of the tailings and waste rock, including proctor tests to document the 
unsaturated moisture-density relationship in the tailings, evaluation of the tailings shear strength by 
means of direct shear box and the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the water 
retention curve of the tailings. 

— Conduct an additional phase of hydrogeology study to confirm ground water volumes to be pumped around 
the open pit and confirm discharges optimal locations. 

— Conduct a specific investigation program to determine the nature, the properties and to assess the volume 
of emptied lake sediments. 

 ENVIRONMENT 
— Continue the various steps involved in obtaining the CA. 
— Continue discussions throughout the Project and aligning the different phases of the Project with the 

Aboriginal communities to understand their concerns and consider their comments in the Project.
