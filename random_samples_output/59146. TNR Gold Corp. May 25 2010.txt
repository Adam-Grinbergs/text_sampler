1.0 Summary 
 
The Mavis Lake Lithium Property (the "Property"), which consists of 13 contiguous 
claims (160 units, totaling 2,544 ha) within Brownridge Township, is located 
approximately 19 km east-northeast of Dryden in northwestern Ontario.  
 
Currently, the Property is 100% owned by TNR Gold Corporation ("TNR").  As of the 
date of this report, TNR and its wholly owned non-public subsidiary International 
Lithium Corporation ("ILC" or the "Company"), has initiated a proposed plan of 
arrangement (the "Arrangement") to "spin-out" TNR's lithium and other rare metals 
mineral property interests into a separate public company, ILC. Upon completion of the 
Arrangement, ILC will acquire all of TNR's interests in the Spin-Off Properties including 
the Mavis Lake property; the subject of this report. The spin-out is subject to the approval 
of the TSX Venture Exchange, the B.C. Supreme Court and shareholders of TNR. 
 
This report documents the geology, mineralogy, lithogeochemistry, economic geology, 
historical exploration and a proposed exploration program of the Mavis Lake rare-
element claim-group (Mavis Lake Property) near Dryden, Ontario. The 2009 exploration 
program was focused upon lithium and tantalum mineralization within a late Archaean 
(2665 million year old) swarm of granitic pegmatites and associated metasomatic 
alteration that comprises part of the Dryden pegmatite field.  
 
In the regional context, the Mavis Lake Property lies within a 2733 to 2706 Ma 
collisional tectonic zone known as the Sioux Lookout Domain (SLD) in the western 
Wabigoon Subprovince (WS) that evolved during the Kenoran orogeny. The 150 by 900 
km WS is a granite-greenstone terrain and comprises metavolcanic and subordinate 
metasedimentary rocks, ranging in age from 3.0 Ga to 2.71 Ga, and intruded by 3.0 to 
2.69 Ga granitoid batholiths, gabbroic sills and stocks. 
 
The mineralization is specifically contained within the 1.8-3 by 8 km Mavis Lake 
pegmatite group (MPG), that comprises a swarm of rare-element class granitic pegmatites 
and associated metasomatic zones genetically related to the 2685 Ma, S-type, 
peraluminous, fertile Ghost Lake batholith (GLB). Strong mineralogical zonation of 
pegmatite types has been documented with increasing eastward distance from this 
parental granite: beryl-bearing pegmatitic granite units in the GLB ïƒ external beryl-type 
pegmatite zoneïƒ albite-spodumene-type pegmatite zoneïƒ albite-type pegmatite zone. 
The rare-element granitic pegmatites of the area also belong to the LCT-geochemical 
family (Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum).  
 
Eleven rare-element granitic pegmatites are known on the Mavis Lake Property and vary 
in strike length from 11 to >240m, and thicknesses in 0.3 to >2.4m range. These bodies 
are mainly hosted in the 2733 Ma Brownridge mixed felsic-mafic metavolcanic unit of 
the Neepawa group that is intensely deformed by at least 4 folding events that culminated 
with development of a regional shear zone (Wabigoon fault) and metamorphism to 
middle amphibolite grade.

Historical exploration for rare-elements has focused upon the lithium potential of the 
albite-spodumene-type pegmatites and tantalum potential in the albite-type pegmatites 
situated on the Mavis Lake and adjacent Fairservice properties. The latter property 
contains a resource of 500,000 tons averaging 1.0 wt% Li2O (Storey 1990, p. 153).  This 
is a historical resource calculated prior to implementation of NI43-101 standards, 
therefore should not be relied upon.  The authors have no means available to classify this 
estimate as a current resource (per CIM definition) nor is International Lithium Corp 
using these historical estimates as a current mineral resource.  In addition, the authors 
have no means available to verify the resources and that the resources are not necessarily 
indicative of the mineralization on the Mavis Lake property that is the subject of this 
technical report. 
 
The initial discovery of rare-element mineralization occurred in the mid-1950's related to 
a boom in the lithium demand owing to the US atomic energy program. Most surface 
exposures of spodumene pegmatites were found during this period. Subsequent 
exploration focused upon tantalum spurred by high technology applications during the 
early 1980's and 1997-2001. In recent times there has been a surge in interest in lithium, 
due to advancement in lithium-ion technology and is the commodity of chief interest in 
the company's exploration program. 
 
The rare-element pegmatites are associated with a significant lithium lithogeochemical 
anomaly at least 7km in strike length and widths of 100 to 700m according to historical 
record. Exploration during 2009 extended this anomaly a further 1.1 km to the northeast. 
 
The highest lithium values on the Mavis Lake Property occur in albite-spodumene-type 
pegmatites with Li2O values up to 1.22 wt.% over 5.3 meters from a composite channel 
sample across part of Pegmatite 18 documented in 2009 work by the Company. 
Numerous grab samples with elevated tantalum, cesium and rubidium were encountered 
in sodic aplite and albitite dykes within a 500 by 800 m area of the albite-type pegmatite 
zone. The highest values for Ta2O5 (1349 ppm), Rb2O (1.0 wt %) and Cs2O (1537 ppm) 
were encountered in these high sodium units (6 to 10.5 wt% Na2O). The eastern and 
southeastern limits of the rare-element mineralization, associated with albite-type 
pegmatites on the Mavis Lake Property, remains open to the east and southeast. 
 
A systematic exploration program for lithium, tantalum, cesium and rubidium in exposed 
and blind pegmatites is proposed for the claim-group that includes geological and 
structural mapping, lithogeochemical sampling, documentations of the economically 
important mineralogy through electron microprobe analysis and establishment of vectors 
of pegmatite evolution. 
 
2.0 Introduction and Terms of Reference 
 
This report on the Mavis Lake Lithium Property (the "Property") was commissioned by 
International Lithium Corporation (ILC), a wholly owned subsidiary of publicly traded 
TNR Gold Corporation (TNR.V)(the "Company", individually or jointly), to comply with 
the disclosure and reporting requirements set forth in National Instrument 43-101 (NI43-



 7 

101), and Form 43-101F1 and is intended to be used as supporting documentation to be 
filed with the British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) and the TSX Venture 
Exchange. The report recommends a two-phase exploration program totaling $560,450 to 
further assess the Property to host economic concentration of lithium and other rare-
element metals such as tantalum, cesium, rubidium etc. 
 
This report presents the results of 2009 exploration programs conducted by Coast 
Mountain Geological Ltd. A BC registered mineral exploration consulting company in 
conjunction with Company personnel. The report is written and edited by J. Garry Clark, 
Ike A. Osmani and Fred W. Breaks utilizing sources of information from reports listed in 
Section 23 (References). All three Authors edited the illustrations. The report and 
recommendations are based on: 
 

1. Public data archived at the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines and 
Forestry, Kenora and Sudbury, Ontario. 

2. Exploration records provided by TNR and ILC. 
3. A personal site visit by the independent author J. Garry Clark to the Property on 

January 11th, 2010. 
 
The independent author J. Garry Clark of Clark Exploration Consulting Inc. completed a 
property visit on January 11th, 2010. The visit was completed utilizing a pick-up truck 
and focused on Pegmatite 11 located near the southwestern Property boundary. Three of 
the pulp samples from the channel sampling were selected and sent for analysis. 
 
The co-author I.A. Osmani holds a position of chief geologist with ILC and its parent 
company TNR, and is a practicing member of professional geoscientists/engineers 
associations in Ontario, Manitoba, British Columbia and Northwest Territory. He is also 
an internal Qualified Person (QP) on ILC's Canadian rare-metals/rare earth elements 
projects. The author F.W. Breaks is a special advisor on the Company's rare metal 
projects, and a practicing member of the professional geoscientists of Ontario. The 2009 
exploration program by the Company was planned and executed under the supervision of 
I.A. Osmani and F.W. Breaks. 
 
ILC's other lithium and rare-metals projects, which are not subject of this report, are 
located both in North and South Americas (Canada, USA, Argentina) and Europe 
(Ireland). Company's rare metals portfolio comprises a mix of both lithium pegmatites 
(e.g., Forgan, Niemi and Mavis lakes, Ontario; Moose in Northwest Territory) and 
lithium-brines (e.g., Fish Lake, Mud Lake and Sarcobatus Flats in Nevada; Mariana in 
Salta Province, Argentina) properties. 
 
2.1 Abbreviations and Units 
 
Confusion can result from the various ways that lithium and other rare metals quantities 
and concentrations have been reported in scientific and business publications. In this 
report, rare metals (lithium, tantalum, cesium, rubidium etc) are reported as elemental 
metal quantities and converted to oxides by using their respective conversion factors (see 



 8 

Tables 1 and 2). All references to dollars are in Canadian dollars (CDN$) unless 
otherwise indicated. Abbreviations and units used in this report are those commonly 
referred to in the scientific literature.

2.2 Granitic Pegmatite Minerals 
 
Pegmatite is a common igneous plutonic rock of variable texture having a crystal size 
from few centimeters to occasionally reaching a metre or so in length. The word 
pegmatite refers to a rock of granite composition consisting of common granite minerals 
such as quartz, feldspar (both sodic and potassic) and micas plus minerals containing 
lithium, tantalum-niobium and rare earths (Table 3). Pegmatites also commonly contain 
typical pneumatolitic and hydrothermal minerals, such as tourmaline, cassiterite, 
fluorite, apatite etc. They are economically important as a source of many rare elements, 
including radioactive ones, together with tin and tungsten.

4.0 Property Description and Location 
 
The Mavis Property is located south and east of Mavis Lake within Brownridge 
Township in northwestern Ontario. The claim group, which occurs within the Kenora 
Mining District, is approximately 19 km by road to the east-northeast of Dryden, and is 
shown on National Topographic System (NTS) map sheet 52F/15E (Figure 1). The 
property is centered approximately at 526 500mE/5 520 200mN UTM coordinates (Zone 
15N, NAD83).  
 
The property consists of 13 contiguous unpatented claims (160 units), totaling 2,544 
hectares (Table 4 and Figure 2). TNR acquired 100% interest in the property by staking 
claims in two stages. The property is not subject to any underlying royalties, back-in 
rights, payments or other agreements and encumbrances. 
 
As of the date of this report, The Company has initiated a proposed plan of arrangement 
(the "Arrangement") involving TNR Gold Corp. and wholly owned non-public subsidiary 
International Lithium Corp. The purpose of the Arrangement is to "spin-out" TNR's 
lithium and other rare metals mineral property interests into a separate public company, 
International Lithium Corp. Upon completion of the Arrangement, ILC will acquire all of 
TNR's interests in the Spin-Off Properties including the Mavis Lake property; the subject 
of this report. A meeting date of the shareholders of TNR has been set for June 8, 2010 to 
vote on the Arrangement.  Upon satisfactory passing of the motion to adopt the 
Arrangement as presented, the Mavis Lake property will be duly assigned and 100% 
owned by ILC. The spin-out is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, the 
B.C. Supreme Court and shareholders of TNR. 
 
The Property hosts known mineral occurrences but no developed prospects (Figure 8). 
 
The eastern property boundary is bound by Lola Lake Provincial Reserve, which was 
regulated in 1985 from a Provincial Park to a nature reserve class park. The claims have 
not been legally surveyed. The Government of Ontario owns the surface rights. 
 
The Government of Ontario requires expenditures of $400 per year per unit, prior to 
expiry, to keep the claims in good standing for the following year. The report must be 
submitted by the assessment due date. 
 
There are no known environmental liabilities associated with the property. For the 
proposed exploration program consisting of line-cutting and geophysics no permits are 
required. Permits are required if, during the course of exploration, waterways are 
affected.

5.0 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, Infrastructure and 
Physiography 
 
5.1 Access and Infrastructure 
 
The Mavis Lake property has excellent road accessibility. It is approximately 19 km 
northeast by road from the city of Dryden and can be reached from the city by driving 
east on Trans-Canada Highway 17 for approximately 8 km to its junction with the 
Thunder Lake. On Thunder Lake Road travel is roughly 3 km to the intersection of 
Thunder Lake Road and Ghost Lake South Road. From this point, driving north on the 
Ghost Lake South Road for about 1 km and thence turn east along the Mine Road, a 
major gravel road, for approximately 4 km brings one to an intersection of a subsidiary 
gravel road heading north to the eastern claims of the property. 
  
A general labour force and many goods and modern services are readily available in 
Dryden, which is the second largest city of 8,195 inhabitants (2006 Census) in the Kenora 
District of Northwestern Ontario and is located on Wabigoon Lake. Skilled labour, 
mining and specialized exploration services and equipments are available from larger 
cities such as Thunder Bay and Winnipeg (Manitoba), which are located respectively 356 
km east and 350 km west of Dryden. Dryden has an airport with connecting flights to 
many major Canadian cities, including Thunder Bay and Winnipeg, which can also serve 
as points to many international flights. 
 
Hydroelectric power is available only few kilometers southwest of the property, from a 
line, which also supplies power to the city of Dryden. Railway links to the eastern and 
western Canada and also south to the USA are readily available from Dryden.   
 
5.2 Climate 
 
The property lies near the northern boundary of the Lake of the Woods eco-region of the 
Southern Boreal Shield. The region is classified as having a sub-humid mid-boreal eco-
climate (cf. Anthony 2004). Dryden and adjacent region is known to have temperatures 
ranging from a low of â€“27 deg. Celsius in the winter to high of +26 deg. Celsius in the 
summer. The climate is considered to be temperate. Annual rainfall is 0.6 to 0.8 metres 
and annual snowfall ranges between 1.3 to 2.3 metres.  
 
5.3 Topography and Physiography 
 
The topography varies from generally flat to slightly undulating south of the property, 
corresponding to a transition from a glaciolacustrine sand plain to a boulder till. The 
northern parts are relatively rugged with prominent hills, ravines and cliffs. Elevations 
range from around 400 metres along the shores of the lakes to about 460 metres on ridge 
crests located in the central part of the property.  
 



 16 

The northern and west-central parts of the property have been recently logged leaving 
sparsely spaced trees and scattered underbrush. On the other parts of the property 
characteristic vegetation includes a succession from trembling aspen, paper birch, white 
and black spruce, and balsam fir. Cooler and wetter areas support black spruce and 
tamarack growth. 
 
Characteristic wildlife includes moose, black bear, wolf, lynx, snowshoe hare and 
woodchuck. Bird species include ruffed grouse, woodpecker, bald eagle, herring gull and 
waterfowl. Forestry, recreation and hunting are the major land uses in this region. 
 
6.0 History 
 
The Wabigoon region, which includes the Property, was mapped in 1940s by Ontario 
Department of Mines (Moorhouse 1941, Satterly 1943). Later semi-detailed bedrock 
mapping was conducted by the government of Ontario in 1970s and 1980s (Breaks 1980, 
Breaks et al. 1976, 1978 and Breaks and Kuehner 1984) and more recently for the 
government by Beakhouse (2001, 2002). Breaks et al. (2003) also conducted more 
focused studies of the rare metal potential of the region. The Ontario Geological Survey 
has flown airborne magnetic and electromagnetic surveys both in the Dryden and Stormy 
Lake areas (Ontario Geological Survey 1997, 2001). The Dryden Lake area survey 
included the Property. 
 
The Mavis Lake area, including the current Property, saw three main periods of mineral 
exploration: 
 

1. 1955 to 1964: in 1950s lithium was the main target while tungsten and tantalum 
dominated in 1960s. 

  
2. Late 1960s to late 1980s: tungsten and tantalum were the focus of exploration. 
 
3. Early 2000 to present: the focus of exploration has been quite diversified, 

ranging from volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) copper-zinc-silver to shear-
hosted lode-gold deposits, and currently exploration efforts once again focused on 
pegmatite-hosted rare metals. 

 
In 1956, Lun-Echo Gold Mines Ltd. drilled the area immediately south of Mavis Lake. 
From August to September, ten NQ holes were drilled, totaling 873.32 ft (266.19 metres), 
18 samples were assayed for Cu (0.09-1.31%), Ni (0.07-0.48%), Au (nil) and Ag (nil to 
trace). Pegmatite dikes were intercepted in the 8 of 10 holes drilled at this time but no 
assays for rare metal mineralization were reported (Table 5).

After encountering the pegmatite interceptions in the previous drilling program, Lun-
Echo Gold Mines Ltd. carried out trenching and another 40-hole diamond drilling 
program, totaling 1968 meters, for potential lithium mineralization on the property. The 
drilling program defined lithium mineralization over a strike length of 670 meters with 
lithia (Li2O) percentage from as low as 0.37% to a high of 2.76% (Table 6). This drilling 
program was conducted west of current Property on the adjacent Fairservice claims.

In the same year 1956, Milestone Mines Ltd. completed a trenching work and very 
limited diamond drilling on some pegmatites immediately east and southeast of Mavis 
Lake on the current Mavis property (Vanstone 1983). 
 
In 1978, R.J. Fairservice staked the property and subsequently optioned to Selco 
Mining Corporation Limited ("Selco"). Between 1979 and 1981, Selco carried out 
geological mapping, lithogeochemical surveys and diamond drilling over the area that 
extended from west, south and southeast of the Mavis Lake. During June 1979-
September 1980, Selco drilled eight holes, totaling 1153 feet or 351.4 metres. This 
drilling delineated South and Main pegmatite zones (Figure 3). Pryslak (1980) described 
the results of 4 out of 8 holes as following: 
 

South Zone: this pegmatite zone was intercepted by drill holes M-1 and M-2. The 
pegmatite intersected in each case was less than 10 feet thick and consisted 
essentially of wall-zone and mixed intermediate zone material. Minor aplitic 
material was encountered but this would appear to be of primary origin rather 
than a late replacement zone.  

 
Main Zone: this pegmatite zone was intersected by drill holes M-3 and M-4. The 
pegmatites consisted of a wall zone and intermediate spodumeneâ€“bearing core 
zones.  A total of 14 core samples were assayed for tantalum, niobium and lithium 
oxides (Ta2O5, Nb2O5 and Li2O, respectively) at Swastika Laboratories Limited 
(Ontario) in November 1979 and the results are presented in the Table 7 below.

In the early 1980, Selco carried out a reconnaissance lithogeochemical survey. A total of 
313 bedrock samples were collected and analyzed for lithium content. Samples returned 
results from a low of 7 ppm Li to a high of 4095 ppm lithium (Li). The survey was 
controlled by chaining along claim lines and by running intermediate lines by compass 
and chain. The Mavis Lake geochemical survey has shown good correlation between 
lithium halos with the known albite-spodumene pegmatite zone (Figure 3). 
 
In 1982, Tantalum Mining Corporation of Canada Limited ("Tanco") optioned the 
Fairservice Property. In June 1982, a program of line cutting and geophysical survey was 
completed on a portion of the property. It was concluded that the Mavis Lake area is 
characterized by a higher (>1000 gammas) but irregular magnetic response over the 
mafic metavolcanic rocks. The sediments have a low, flat magnetic response, but this 
could be partially due to the masking effects of the overburden. It was thought that the 
contrasts in magnetic signatures could be used as an aid to identifying favorable zones for 
pegmatites since the rare metal pegmatites have an affinity for mafic metavolcanics in the 
Mavis Lake area (Vanstone, 1982). 
 
In June 1982, Tanco also completed a detailed lithium litho-geochemical survey over a 
portion of the Property. The purpose of the litho-geochemical survey was to locate, by 
means of a systematic sampling of the bedrock, blind tantalum-bearing pegmatites. 
Samples were collected at 25 meters intervals along chained lines 50 metres apart. A total 
of 737 samples over approximately 37.2 line kilometers were collected. At each sample 
location roughly 0.5 kg of fresh sample was taken. Grid coordinates identified the 
samples with the rock type recorded and samples analyzed for ppm Lithia (Li2O). The 
Li2O values for the survey ranged from less than detection limit to a high of 8000 ppm 
with mean value being 203 ppm.  
 
Two anomalous zones were defined by Tanco's lithium litho-geochemical survey: the 
North or Northeast and East zones (Figure 3). The North Zone is a very intense zone 
with values in excess of 1000 ppm Li2O. The zone is characterized by broad, extensive 
anomalies, but also contains a number of small, tight isolated anomalies. The zone is 
generally confined to the more magnetically responsive mafic metavolcanics. The East 
Zone consists of small, generally elongated, and relatively tight anomalies. Such anomaly 
configurations are indicative of near vertical pegmatites. The eastern part of the 
anomalous zone tends to be broader reflecting the change to more shallow dipping 
pegmatites. The East Zone geochemical pattern is not as strong as the North Zone, with 
values rarely exceeding 1000 ppm Li2O (Vanstone 1983). 
 
Tanco conducted no follow up exploration program after completing the litho-
geochemical survey and all claims were returned to R.J. Fairservice in the same year.  
 
During the late summer in 2002, Emerald Field Resources optioned the property from 
R.F. Fairservice for its rare metal (Ta, Cs and Be), VMS-type base metal (copper-zinc) 
and Hemlo-style gold mineralization potential. In 2003, Emerald Field Resources carried 
out prospecting, trenching, geological mapping programs and a 4-hole diamond drill 
program (Mowat, 2003). 



 21 

 
In the summer of 2003, True North Gems Inc. undertook development work on a 
previously known emerald occurrence (Brand et al. 2009) on its optioned Taylor beryl 
pegmatite located on strike to the now lapsed property holdings of Emerald Field 
Resources. 
 
Houston Lake Mining in 2004 carried out exploration for rare metals on the Brady 
property (Anthony 2004), situated immediately west of the Mavis Lake and Fairservice 
properties and which contains the various showings on the former Sanmine property. 
 
7.0 Geological Setting 
 
7.1 Regional Geology 
 
In the regional context, the Property lies within Sioux Lookout Domain (SLD) in the 
western Wabigoon Subprovince (WS) (Figures 4 and 5). The SLD is sandwiched 
between the granitoid-dominated Winnipeg River Subprovince (WRS) to the north and 
the greenstone-granite rich WS to the south.  The eastern half of the WS shares border 
with the metasedimentary-dominated English River Subprovince (ERS) to the north and 
in the south by the metasedimentary Quetico Subprovince (QS). The WS is 
approximately 900 km long, 150 km wide granite-greenstone terrain and comprises 
metavolcanic and subordinate metasedimentary rocks, ranging in age from 3.0 Ga to 2.71 
Ga, and intruded by a suite of 3.0 to 2.69 Ga granitoid batholiths, gabbroic sills and 
stocks. 
 
The SLD is interpreted to have developed within a collisional tectonic setting during the 
Kenoran orogeny (Breaks 1989, Beakhouse 1989, 1991).  Features of the SLD include: 
 

â€¢ inverted stratigraphy and out-of-sequence thrust stacking of metavolcanic and 
clastic metasedimentary rocks (2733Â±1 Ma to 2706Â±2 Ma), 

 
â€¢ Abukuma-type metamorphism, 
 
â€¢ areas of higher-grade, migmatized clastic metasedimentary rocks adjacent to the 

western contact of the 2685 Ma Ghost Lake batholith (GLB), the main source for 
the 2665 Ma rare metal granitic pegmatites in the Dryden area, 

 
â€¢ occurrences of peraluminous granite and pegmatitic granite plutons over 150 km 

strike length, and, 
 
â€¢ widespread occurrences of rare metals (Li, Rb, Cs, Be, Nb, Ta and Ga) plus other 

lithophile elements such as Mo, W, Sn, U, Th etc contrasting with the adjacent 
WRS and WS. 

 
The 10 by 30 km area within the eastern SLD which is host to numerous rare metal 
pegmatites in the Dryden area, is known as the "Dryden Pegmatite Field" (DPF) of 



 22 

 



 23 

 



 24 

Mulligan (1965) (Figure 6). The DPF is populated by two distinct pegmatite clusters 
(Breaks and Janes 1991) occur roughly 10 km apart: 
  

1. Mavis Lake Pegmatite group (MPG) in the Mavis Lake area, with a 2665Â±10 
Ma age (Smith 2001), and,  

 
2. Gullwing-Tot Pegmatite group (GPG) in the Gullwing and Tot Lakes areas of 

unknown mineralization age.  
 
The Wabigoon Fault represents a major curvilinear, southwest- to east-northeast trending 
regional structure, located along the southern contact of the SLD, and lies about 4.5 to 5 
km south of the Mavis Lake lithium property. Beakhouse (2001) has subdivided the 
supracrustal units of the SLD, from north to south, into an alternating series of southward 
facing metavolcanics and metasedimentary rocks. These supracrustal rocks in the Mavis 
Lake area comprised the following sequences:  
 

1. Brownridge sediments and volcanics in the north,  
 
2. Thunder Lake sediments and volcanics in the middle and,  
 
3. Highly strained Zealand sediments adjacent to the Wabigoon Fault (WF) 

defining the southern most portion of the SLD. 
 
The Minnitaki and Abram Lake greenstone belts (2745Â±1 to 2711 Ma) characterize the 
eastern SLD. Supracrustal rock sequences within this part of the domain comprise 
ultramafic (komatiitic) through mafic (tholeiitic, calc-alkaline, alkalic and komatiitic) and 
to calc-alkalic felsic volcanic rocks. Overlying metasediments are mostly clastic rocks of 
alluvial fan-fluvial, turbidite and platformal facies. Minor chemical sedimentary rocks are 
predominantly oxide-facies iron formation. All these rocks units are surrounded by 
external granitoid batholiths, and internally intruded by numerous variably sized sills, 
stocks and plutons of gabbroic and granitic compositions. Deformation and syntectonic to 
post-tectonic granitic plutonism occurred in the interval 2711 to 2685 Ma.  
 
The underlying Brownridge metasediments within the Mavis Lake area are dominated by 
wacke with subordinate siltstone strata and have well-preserved primary structures. 
Structurally overlying metavolcanic rocks (Brownridge volcanics) consist of fine-grained 
pillowed, massive mafic lavas and medium- to coarse-grained flows and/or gabbroic sills. 
The upper portion of the metavolcanics tends to be variolitic, massive and pillowed mafic 
flows (Beakhouse, 2001). 
 
The Thunder Lake sediments underlie the southeastern-most part of the property 
boundary and are similar in character to the Brownridge sediments. Quartz+/-plagioclase 
porphyritic felsic metavolcanic rocks (crystal tuffs?) are interlayered within sediments. 
The Thunder Lake 



 25 



 26 

metavolcanics consist of massive to pillowed mafic flows with minor mafic to ultramafic 
rocks of undetermined age.  
 
Five plutonic rock suites occur in the region (Breaks and Janes 1991): a tonalitic gneiss 
suite (circa 3170 million-year old); tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suite (2665+/- 20 
million-year old); two mica, peraluminous granite â€“granodiorite suite (2681+/- 20 
million-year old); biotite granite-granodiorite suite (2560+/- 40 million-year old); and a 
mafic-ultramafic plutonic suite.  
 
The two-mica granites are the source for rare metal pegmatites in the region, for example, 
the 2685 Ma Ghost Lake batholith (GLB) in the Mavis Lake area (Figure 6). The GLB is 
the largest (80 square km) and most fractionated of any peraluminous granite in the SLD 
with eight internal, subsolvus granitic and pegmatitic granite units as shown in Figure 7 
(Breaks and Janes 1991, Breaks et al. 2005).  
 
Structural data between Dryden and Sioux Lookout indicates four stages of deformation. 
Berger (1990) and Chorlton (1991) identified flat-lying folds (D1) within iron formation 
units and associated pre-metamorphic axial planar schistosity. A second stage 
deformation (D2) associated with plutonic activity, produced contact strain and thermal 
aureoles adjacent to plutons and subsequently developed steeply dipping foliation and 
aureoles with amphibolite-facies metamorphic grade. The third (D3) stage of regional 
deformation interfered with D1 folds to produce complex outcrop patterns of domes and 
basins. The resulting northeast striking shear zones are characterized by steep dips with a 
southwest plunging mineral lineation. The final stage (D4) of deformation produced 
continued convergence and subsequently formed the Wabigoon shear zone and its 
associated splays. The resultant structural complexities within the Abram and Minnitaki 
Lake belts, along with strong evidence of layer-parallel shearing, suggests the belts have 
been tectonically stacked and subsequently form repetitive volcanic and sedimentary 
sequences (Drost and Hunt 1997). 
 
Mineral deposits and prospects of the Wabigoon Subprovince include volcanogenic 
copper-gold and zinc-copper-silver deposits within volcanic units and iron formations 
(Blackburn et al. 1991). Mafic and ultramafic rocks contain mineralization associated 
with granitic pegmatite-related rare metals, uranium and platinum group elements 
deposits and prospects. Gold deposits are known to be associated with shear zones, 
quartz-carbonate veins, and within contact strain aureoles developed around large 
plutons. 
 
7.2 Property Geology 
 
The Property is located on the north limb of a westerly plunging syncline that lies 
adjacent to the Thunder Lake anticline (Figures 8 and 8a - Beakhouse and Pidgeon 2003). 
Mafic metavolcanic and clastic metasedimentary rocks predominantly underlie the 
property. Intermediate to felsic volcanics occur as minor intercalations within the 
volcanic sequences. Intruded into these units are ultramafic dikes, small alkalic stocks 
and numerous granite pegmatite dikes.

7.2.1 Mafic Metavolcanic Rocks 
 
Mafic metavolcanics are the dominant rock type on the property and stratigraphically 
correspond to the Brownridge volcanics. The subunits include massive, pillowed, 
variolitic, plagioclase porphyritic and spherulitic flows, and volcanic conglomerates, tuffs 
and interflow sediments. 
 
7.2.2 Intermediate to Felsic Metavolcanic Rocks 
 
These rocks occur as narrow, tuffaceous interbeds of dacitic chemical composition within 
the mafic metavolcanic rocks. 
 
7.2.3 Clastic Metasedimentary Rocks 
 
A thick boulder till and proglacial sand cover generally masks clastic metasedimentary 
rocks underlying the extreme northern and southern portions of the property. The clastic 
metasediments are composed of mainly wacke with minor siltstone interbeds. 
 
7.2.4 Ultramafic to Mafic Intrusive Rocks 
 
Two small bodies of medium to coarse-grained gabbro are located on the south-central 
part of the property. These rocks are likely interfingered as shallow sills with mafic 
volcanics though contact relationships are unclear. 
 
7.2.5 Granitoid Stocks 
 
Two small, moderately to weakly peraluminous granodiorite stocks have intruded the 
supracrustal rocks on property. The larger of the two stocks is 3.0 km long by 1.1 km 
wide, oblong in shape and occurs in the extreme southeast corner of the property. The 
second and smaller Mavis Lake stock is a round body approximately 1.0 km in diameter 
and largely covered by Mavis Lake.  A much smaller, 100 by 300 m, strongly 
peraluminous intrusion, possibly associated with a beryl pegmatite (Beakhouse 2001), is 
located at the north-central end of the property and comprises granite to granodiorite with 
minor pegmatite and aplite.  
 
7.2.6 Granitic Pegmatite Dikes 
 
Numerous granitic pegmatite dikes, ranging from the primary spodumene-bearing to 
albite-rich, tantalum-enriched varieties occur on the property. The dikes are generally 
found within the mafic metavolcanic sequences. These pegmatites are linked to Ghost 
Lake batholith (GLB), and a part of the Mavis Lake Pegmatite Group (MPG) of Breaks 
and Janes (1991). The MPG is characterized by east-trending concentration of rare 
elements-bearing pegmatites and related metasomatic zones.  
 
Eleven rare metal pegmatites of this group occur on the Mavis-property, denoted as 
Pegmatites 11 through 19, including a new pegmatite, named RVL that was discovered 



 31 

by TNR during the fall 2009 exploration program (Figures 8 and 8a). These pegmatites 
fall into two zones according to the initial classification of Breaks (1989), based upon 
systematic variation in rare-element mineralogy and petrochemistry: 
 

â€¢ Spodumene-beryl-tantalite zone (Li-Rb-Be-Ta>Nb-B) 
 
â€¢ Albite-type pegmatite zone (Li>Rb-Be-Ta>Nb and Rb>Li-Be-Ta>Nb). 

 
In the classification of ÄŒernÃ½ (1991) and recent revision (ÄŒernÃ½ and Ercit 2005), these 
pegmatites represent a mix of albite-spodumene-type, albite-type and complex-type 
pegmatite dikes. Pegmatites 11, 12, 17 and 18 have been classified as albite-spodumene-
type (spodumene-beryl-tantalite zone) and Pegmatites 13, 14, 15, 16 and 19 as albite-
type. Geochemically, all these types also belong to the LCT (Li-Cs-Ta)-geochemical-
family of pegmatites (ÄŒernÃ½ 1991).  
 
The granitic pegmatite bodies exhibit an arcuate east to northeast strike pattern around 
the southeast corner of Mavis Lake. Dips are generally steep to the north. Tops, 
determined from pillowed flows, are to the south, indicating that the north limb of the 
syncline has been overturned. Sets of both steep and shallow dipping joints occur 
throughout the property. In the western portion of the property the pegmatites appear to 
have an affinity for the steep dipping set, whereas in the eastern portion of the property 
the pegmatites tend to have shallow dips (Vanstone 1982).  
 
8.0 Deposit Types 
 
8.1 General 
 
The Superior Geological Province contains more than 200 rare-element pegmatite (also 
termed rare metal pegmatite) occurrences that are hosted by metavolcanic (52%), clastic 
metasedimentary (23%), peraluminous granite plutons (20%) and tonalite to granodiorite 
(5%) rocks (Figure 9, Breaks et al. 2005). Genetically, these pegmatites have been linked 
to peraluminous, S-type, fertile parent granites and recognition of such parental granites 
is critical in the exploration for rare elements such as Li, Cs, Rb, Be, Ta, Nb, Ga, Tl and 
Ge (Breaks et al. 2005). One of the best examples of such parental granites is the Ghost 
Lake batholith (GLB) located adjacent to the Property area (Breaks and Moore 1992). A 
fertile granite is the parental granite to rare metal pegmatite dikes. Some granitic melts 
have the capability to initially evolve into a fertile granite pluton that subsequently 
produced episodes of residual melts available to migrate into the host rock via structural 
anisotropies and crystallize as rare-element pegmatite dikes (Breaks et al. 2003). 
 
 
8.2 Genesis of Peraluminous Granite-Rare Metal Pegmatite 
 
Pegmatite is a common plutonic rock of variable texture and coarseness that is composed 
of interlocking crystals of widely different sizes. They are formed by fractional 



 32 



 33 

crystallization of an incompatible element-enriched granitic melt. Several factors control 
whether or not barren granite will fractionate to produce a fertile granite melt (Figure 10, 
ÄŒernÃ½ 1991, Breaks 2003): 
 

â€¢ presence of trapped volatiles: fertile granites crystallize from a 
volatile-rich melt. 

 
â€¢ composition of melt: fertile granites are derived from an aluminum-rich 

melt. 
 
â€¢ source of magma: barren granites are usually derived from the partial 

melting of an igneous source (I-type), whereas fertile granites are 
derived from partial melting of a peraluminous sedimentary source (S-
type). 

 
â€¢ degree of partial melting: fertile granites require a high degree of 

partial melting of the source rock that produced the magma. 
 
Initially, fractional crystallization of a granitic melt will form barren granite consisting of 
common rock forming minerals such as quartz, potassium feldspar, plagioclase and mica. 
Because incompatible rare elements, such as Be, Li, Nb, Ta, Cs, B, which do not easily 
fit into the crystal of these common rock-forming minerals, become increasingly 
concentrated in the granitic melt as common rock forming minerals continue to 
crystallize and separate from the melt (Breaks et al. 2003). At this point, if the granitic 
melt is of a volatile-rich modestly peraluminous composition, then further fractional 
crystallization will lead to fertile granite melt enriched in incompatible rare-
elements/metals. The rare metals will remain in the melt until the last possible moment 
when they will crystallize as pegmatitic minerals such as spodumene, petalite, tantalite, 
columbite, etc.  
 
After most of the fertile granite pluton has crystallized, the residual fractionated granitic 
melt that remains as concentrates at the roof of the pluton, can then intrude along 
rheological contacts, fractures and faults into the host rocks to form pegmatite dikes. The 
forms of rare metal granitic pegmatite are greatly variable, and are controlled mainly by 
the competency of the enclosing rocks, the depth of emplacement, and the tectonic and 
metamorphic regime at the time of emplacement.  
 
8.3 Regional Setting 
 
Following geological settings of the fertile granites and related pegmatite dikes have been 
observed within the Superior Province (Figure 9, Breaks and Osmani 1989, Breaks et al. 
2005):  
  

â€¢ peraluminous, S-type and pegmatite granites typically occurring along or near 
the boundaries of high-grade (amphibolite to granulite facies),  



 34 



 35 

 
â€¢ metasedimentary-dominant subprovinces such as the English River, Quetico 

and Opatica. 
 
â€¢ fertile S-type granites situated within medium-grade (greenschist to 

amphibolite facies) rocks hosted within the Wabigoon Subprovince (WS) 
adjacent to high-grade Winnipeg River (WR) and English River (ER) 
subprovinces (e.g., Dryden pegmatite field, Separation Rapids pegmatite 
group and Aubrey pegmatites in the Armstrong field). 

 
â€¢ rare metal pegmatites and their parental granites occurring along faulted 

subprovinces boundaries (e.g., "Pakeagama pegmatite group" along Bearhead 
Fault Zone at the Sachigo-Berens River subprovinces boundary â€“ Osmani and 
Stott 1988, Osmani et al. 1989, Breaks and Osmani 1989, Breaks and Tindle 
1998). 

 
â€¢ lithium-bearing pegmatites located within greenstone belts but are not related 

to high-grade metamorphic rocks or major fault systems (e.g., Raleigh Lake 
lithium occurrences â€“ Breaks et al. 2005). 

 
The rare metal pegmatites are regionally scattered throughout the boundary zone between 
the granitoid-dominant WR to the north and the greenstone-granite WS to the south. This 
15-40 km by 250 km zone is characterized by: 
 

a. inverted stratigraphy and out-of-sequence thrust stacking of allochthonous 
metavolcanic and metasedimentary assemblages, ranging in age from 2733Â±1 to 
2703Â±2 Ma. 
 
b. wide range in metamorphic grade â€“ low to high grade. 
 
c. zones of metasedimentary migmatite. 
 
d. two-mica, peraluminous granite plutons distributed over 150 km. 
 
e. a distinctive metallogeny relative the adjacent WS and WR featured by 

widespread lithophile metal enrichment which is in addition to rare-metal 
pegmatites. 

 
8.4 Local Setting 
 
Pegmatites of the Dryden area were initially described and named by Mulligan (1965) as 
the "Dryden Pegmatite Field" (DPF). The DPF has been subdivided into two distinct 
pegmatite populations (Figure 6 - Breaks 1989, Breaks and Janes 1991, Breaks et al. 
2003, 2004):  
 

1) Mavis Lake Pegmatite Group (MPG), and, 



 36 

 
2) Gullwing -Tot Lakes Pegmatite Group (GTG) 

 
These two groups are approximately 10 km apart. The MPG is linked genetically with the 
GLB, a late Achaean (2685 Ma), late to post-tectonic, fertile, S-type, peraluminous 
granite and pegmatitic granite body. According to Breaks and Janes (1991), although 
both MPG and GTG are hosted within amphibolitized mafic metavolcanic rocks, they 
differ in their respective structural settings and development processes. The GTG is a 
post-tectonic of no known genetic linkage with any exposed granite body in the area but 
contains one of the most highly evolved pegmatites in Ontario. Pollucite-bearing 
pegmatites occur within this group and, based on their fractionation indices, indicate 
extreme fractionation that compares with the Tanco pegmatite (Breaks 1989, ÄŒernÃ½ et al. 
1998, ÄŒernÃ½ and Ercit 2005).  
 
Since the pegmatites belonging to the MPG are the main objective of the current study, 
the dikes of this group are only discussed in this report. Detailed descriptions of GTG are 
contained in Breaks and Janes (1991) and Breaks et al. (2003, 2005) to which the reader 
is referred.   
 
The majority of the rare metal pegmatites within the MPG strike parallel to the foliation 
of their host rocks and exhibit localized effects of late tectonic deformation such as 
weakly strained contacts, internal ductile shearing, pull-apart structures involving 
tourmaline and spodumene and buckling and boudinage of pegmatite granite dikes near 
the GLG contact (Breaks and Janes 1991). However, those pegmatites (albite-type) that 
are located in the outermost zone of the MPG are thought to postdate the tectonic 
deformation as evident by their discordant emplacement and lack of ductile 
deformational features. 
 
8.5 Mavis Lake Deposit Model 
 
Rare-element pegmatites of the MPG, as discussed in the preceding sections, are spatially 
and genetically linked with the peraluminous, S-type Ghost Lake batholith (GLB) 
(Breaks 1989, Breaks and Janes 1991, Breaks and Moore 1992, Breaks et al. 2003 and 
2005), of which the extreme eastern end is located within  the northwest corner of the 
Property (Figure 11). This late tectonic, multi-stage, co-magmatic, subsolvus, 280 square 
km complex was emplaced principally into the medium and high metamorphic grade 
clastic metasedimentary rocks within the SLD.  
 
The pegmatitic granite units, which occupy the eastern lobe of the Ghost Lake batholith, 
form a small zone (10 square km) interpreted as a cupola zone. Bulk chemical 
characteristics and chemical indices of these units are comparable to fertile pegmatitic 
granite masses in other fields (ÄŒernÃ½ and Meintzer 1988). The rare element pegmatite 
dikes on the Property and adjacent areas are related both spatially and genetically to this 
pegmatitic eastern lobe of the GLB.



 37 



 38 

The MPG consists of a 0.8 to 1.5 by 8 km, east trending swarm of pegmatites and related 
metasomatic zones hosted mostly within the mafic rocks. Pegmatites of this group exhibit 
a classic regional zonation with increasing distance from the parent GLB, as defined by 
systematic changes in mineralogy, chemical association and extent of post magmatic 
replacement (Figure 11). With increasing distance east from the GLB, the group exhibits 
the following regional disposition of pegmatite zones and distinctive petrochemistry 
(Breaks 1989, Breaks and Janes 1991):  
 

1. Interior beryl zone [(Be-B- (Cs) and Rb-Be-F-Sn- (Cs-Ga-Ta>Nb)], 
 
2. Beryl-columbite zone [(Be-B-Nb>Ta-P- (Cs)]  
 
3. Spodumene-beryl-tantalite zone (Li-Rb-Be-Ta>Nb-B) 
 
4. Albite-type pegmatite zone (Li>Rb-Be-Ta>Nb and Rb>Li-Be-Ta>Nb) 

pegmatites.  
 
The interior beryl zone is 1.5 by 3.5 km area of garnet-tourmaline-muscovite-enriched 
pegmatitic granites within the GLB (Figure 11). This zone resides within the eastern lobe 
of the GLB and is characterized by sporadic green primary beryl in potassic pegmatite 
dykes and masses. 
 
The beryl-columbite zone occurs within mafic metavolcanic country rocks adjacent to 
contact of the batholith. The rare-metal mineralization occurs in muscovite-tourmaline 
potassic pegmatites (e.g., Taylor #1 and #2 pegmatites) or in locally albitized pegmatites 
(e.g., Contact Beryl Occurrence). The Taylor pegmatites contain localized "emeralds" 
that formed adjacent to phlogopite-rich metasomatic selvedges derived from fluid 
interaction with the ultramafic host (peridotite sill). Brand et al. (2009) recently published 
a detailed account on a petrographic-mineralogical study of the emerald mineralization of 
the Taylor emerald occurrences.  
 
The spodumene-beryl-tantalite zone occurs 2.5 to 6 km from the GLB contact. Within 
this zone, a swarm of spodumene-enriched pegmatites 1 to 19, plus the newly discovered 
RVL pegmatite by TNR in the fall 2009, extend easterly from the adjacent Fairservice 
claims onto the Property (Figure 11). The property currently hosts 10 such pegmatites 
(#11 to 19 plus RVL). Pegmatite 1 on the Fairservice property reportedly contains a 
resource of 500,000 tons grading 1.0% Li2O (Storey 1990, p. 153).  This historical 
resource estimate was calculated prior to the implementation of NI 43-101 standards 
therefore it is not current and should not be relied upon. The QP is not able to verify 
the historical estimates of average grades and tonnage for the adjacent Fairservice 
property. As such, these historical data are not necessarily indicative of lithium 
mineralization exposed on the Mavis Lake Property. Furthermore, it is cautioned that 
rare-metal pegmatites of the Dryden pegmatite field adjacent to the Mavis  Lake Property 
individually vary in terms of pegmatite type, modal mineralogy, grain size, internal 
zonation of rock units and Li2O content and therefore the lithium mineralization on 
the Mavis Lake Property may or may not compare with other lithium pegmatites of the 



 39 

area.  The authors have no means available to classify this estimate as a current resource 
(per CIM definition) nor is International Lithium Corp using these historical estimates as 
a current mineral resource. 
 
 Besides lithium-rich spodumene pegmatites within this zone, this pegmatite also contains 
Ta-Nb-Sn oxide minerals such as mangano-columbite and tantalite, wodginite, tantalian 
rutile and cassiterite (Tindle et al. 2002). The pegmatites in the zone generally strike 
concordant to foliation in the host mafic metavolcanic rocks. 
 
Albite-type pegmatite zone represents the distal zone, in which the pegmatites comprise 
less than 1.0m thick sheets composed of units rich in albite (sodic albite and albitite) 
contain fine-grained aggregates of green muscovite and albite formed after primary 
spodumene. Other minerals include mangano-tantalite, white beryl, fluorapatite and 
tourmaline of schorl and highly evolved elbaite compositions.  
 
The rare metal pegmatites on the Property occur in a swarm of flat lying and near vertical 
dikes hosted within mafic metavolcanic rocks and contain some minerals identical to the 
Tanco deposit in southeastern Manitoba (ÄŒernÃ½ and Ercit 2005).  For example, 
wodginite, the chief ore mineral at the Tanco deposit, also occurs in several pegmatites in 
the MPG (Tindle et al. 2002). On the basis of systematic changes in mineralogy, 
chemistry and metal association, these pegmatites are classified as albite-spodumene-
type with beryl and tantalite, albite-type, and complex-type with lithium tourmaline, 
tantalite and wodginite group minerals.  
 
The adjacent Fairservice property is dominated by east-trending albite-spodumene-type 
pegmatites, considered to be part of the same dike swarm as the Property pegmatites.  
 
The pegmatites on both properties are historically correlated with a substantial lithium 
lithogeochemical anomaly, with a minimum length of 3.4 km and up to 700 metres wide. 
This anomaly was recently extended by TNR a further 1.1 km to the northeast beyond 
this known historical length. This lithium anomaly remains open to the east onto the 
Property and also is open to the west on the adjacent Brady property. 
 
9.0 Mineralization   
 
Rare-metal mineralization (e.g., lithium, tantalum, cesium, and rubidium) on the property 
occurs in granitic pegmatite and sodic aplite and albitite dikes, which are typically hosted 
in mafic metavolcanic rocks. These pegmatite dikes are genetically related to a parent 
peraluminous, S-type parent granite body (GLB), the northeastern part of which lies 
within the northwest corner of the Mavis Lake Property. The characteristic minerals 
associated with rare metal mineralization within the pegmatite and related aplite bodies 
are spodumene (Photo 1), tantalite, columbite and tourmaline. Holmquistite, a lithium 
amphibole characteristic of lithium pegmatites, occurs in altered mafic metavolcanic host 
rocks.  
 



 40 

The project area covers the eastern extent of the MPG, which comprises an east trending 
concentration of rare metal pegmatites and related metasomatic zones. The nine known 
pegmatites and a newly discovered dike by TNR on the property are denoted as 
Pegmatite 11 through 19 and RVL, respectively (Figure 11). These pegmatites represent a 
mix of albite-spodumene-type, albite-type, and complex-type dikes (Breaks et al. 2003). 
Pegmatites 11, 12, 17 and 18 are classified as albite-spodumene-type (spodumene-beryl-
tantalite zone) and from 13 to 16 plus 19 are classified as albite-type. Geochemically, 
these pegmatites can be classified the LCT-family of pegmatites (ÄŒernÃ½ 1991). 
 
The spodumene-beryl-tantalite zone is defined by the initial appearance of spodumene in 
pegmatites of the albite-spodumene-type (ÄŒernÃ½, 1991), which is located about 3.5 km  

 
 
Photo 1: Light green blades of spodumene crystals interlocked with light pink to gray 
feldspar.  
 
from the GLB contact with the mafic (Brownridge) metavolcanics (Breaks and Janes 
1991). Swarms of tabular pegmatites dikes, up to 10 m in thickness and 280 m in length, 
generally strike parallel to the foliation in the host rock. Internal zoning is indistinct to 
absent, for example the Pegmatite 1 on the adjacent Fairservice claims. This pegmatite 
contains three gradational zones of increasing content of quartz: a) potassic pegmatite 
with minor interstitial spodumene and quartz, b) spodumene-quartz-rich pegmatite, and 
c) a discontinuous quartz-rich core zone with minor spodumene, blocky microcline and 
beryl.  
 



 41 

Pegmatites 11, 12, 17 and 18 have been classified as albite-spodumene-type pegmatite 
that typically contains the highest spodumene content of any pegmatite type within the 
MPG. Pegmatite #18, for example, contains 53 volume % spodumene (Breaks 1989, 
p.104). 
 
The albite-type pegmatite zone, which is the most distal part of the MPG, composed of 
Pegmatites 13,14, 15, 16 and 19. These pegmatites form thin (<1 m) sheets rich in albite 
and contain sporadic fine-grained aggregates of green muscovite and albite (secondary 
replacement after spodumene), tantalite, white beryl, and rare green lithium tourmaline 
and amblygonite-montebrasite series minerals. 
 
Pegmatites 13, 14 and 15, which occur within the former East Zone of Selco, consist 
mainly of shallowly dipping, thin sheets and one possibly interconnecting dyke. In 
Pegmatite 14 pervasive albitization has resulted in spodumene completely replaced by a 
fine-grained, green mica+albite assemblage. The pegmatitic sheets in some cases occur as 
a linear series of ovoid erosional remnants, which can be intermittently traced for up to 
320 m. These sheets strike parallel to the host rock but their shallow southeast dips are 
discordant to the generally steep northwest dips (68Âº-78Âº) of the metavolcanic sequence. 
Individual sheets vary significantly in dip values, as exemplified by Pegmatite 16. At the 
southwest end steep southeast dips between (65Âº-76Âº) are evident, compared to 38Âº at the 
northeast end. 
 
Pegmatite 14 is typical of the intensely albitized sheets and only ten percent of the dike 
contains recognizable spodumene relics. Most of Pegmatite 14 consists of 20-25% fine-
grained white smoky quartz embedded in a mass of white-pink albite. Beryl occurs 
sporadically in Pegmatites 13, 14 and 15 as subhedral white to bluish-white crystals 
embedded with quartz and albite. 
 
Intense tourmaline replacement of underlying massive mafic metavolcanics is especially 
conspicuous near the northwestern end of Pegmatite 16. Scheelite was identified by 
ultraviolet examination in vein system underlying Pegmatite 16 and in similar veins 
between Pegmatites 13 and 14, near the main dykes of the East Zone. In the case of 
Pegmatite 16, it is clear that the tungsten mineralization is genetically associated at least 
with the tourmaline-rich veins occurring with spodumene bearing rare element 
pegmatites of the East Zone (Breaks 1989). 
 
Tantalum-, niobium- and tin-bearing minerals were confirmed in albite-type and albite-
spodumene pegmatites on the Property by 106 electron microprobe analyses (Tindle et al. 
2002). These minerals were verified as mangano-tantalite, mangano-columbite, ferro-
columbite, cassiterite and wodginite group [Mn (Sn,Ta)Ta2O8]. 
 
The North or Northeast Zone comprises Pegmatites 17 and 18 that have minimum 
respective strike lengths of 240 m and 214 m. Pegmatite 18 consists of several en-
echelon, stacked pegmatite sheets that strike 135Âº with variable northeast dips of 15 to 43 
degrees. This attitude is approximately normal to the regional foliation strike in the host 
massive to pillowed mafic volcanics.  



 42 

 
The main primary assemblage in Pegmatite 18 consists of muscovite-tourmaline-K 
feldspar-albite-spodumene-quartz pegmatite, which is considerably less coarse than 
comparable primary assemblages from the South Zone and on the Fairservice property. 
Spodumene is usually light green and it ranges in abundance from 23 to 53 volume %. 
Beryl, columbite-tantalite, and holmquistite are sparse.  
 
Small quantities of scheelite are disseminated within calc-silicate pods and layers in 
mafic metavolcanic rocks situated within up to one metre from the spodumene pegmatite 
contact. The occurrence of axinite (Ca,Fe,Mn)3Al2BO3Si4O12OH in these calc-silicate 
domains suggests that boron was introduced from nearby albitized spodumene 
pegmatites. 
 
10.0 Exploration 
 
The 2009 field program was conducted by TNR in two stages: 1) a brief, summer 2009 
reconnaissance program from July 25th to 26th, and 2) a detailed month-long follow-up 
program in fall 2009 from September 25th to October 27th. 
 
10.1 2009 Summer Program 
 
The summer reconnaissance program consisted of only two field days with a four-man 
crew to evaluate rare metal potential by locating and sampling one or more of the known 
granite pegmatites on the property. Eight grab and five channel samples were collected 
from Pegmatite 18 for a total of 13 samples (Table 8).  Assay results (as oxides) for 
lithium, tantalum, cesium and rubidium returned up to 3.14 wt % Li2O, >122.1 ppm 
Ta2O5 (maximum upper detection limit), 243 ppm Cs2O and 2500 ppm Rb2O from grab 
samples. Five continuous channel samples were cut for a total length of 5.3 metres 
averaged 1.22 wt.% Li2O, 34.1 ppm Ta2O5, 92.2 ppm Cs2O and 1965 ppm Rb2O (Table 
9). Samples with maximum upper detection limits for some of these metals were re-
analyzed. 
 
10.2 2009 Fall Program 
 
The fall 2009 exploration program consisted of a grid construction, mapping/prospecting, 
sampling and litho-geochemical surveying in selected areas of the property (Figure 8, 8a 
13 and 114a and 14b). The geological work, including mapping/prospecting, sampling 
(grab and channel) and litho-geochemical surveying were conducted from September 25th 
to October 27th. 
  
10.2.1 Grid Construction 
 
A total of 11 lines, including one baseline, totaling 11.25 line-kilometres were cut (Figure 
12). The most westerly north-south line is located 200 m west of the Mavis Lake in the 
vicinity of the Pegmatite 18. The grid lines were spaced 100 metres apart and oriented at 
130Ëš-310Ëš, approximately perpendicular to the dominant foliation on the property.  



 43 

 
10.2.2 Lithogeochemical Survey 
 
One of the objectives of conducting the lithogeochemical survey on the Property was to 
use lithium (Li) and, to lesser extent, other rare-element values/anomalies developed in 
metavolcanic host rocks that have a metasomatic imprint due to rare-element pegmatite 
emplacement as exploration tool for finding hidden or blind pegmatites (ÄŒernÃ½ 1989b). 
This survey is based on a well-tested theory that when a rare-metal pegmatite melt 
intrudes a country rock, rare-element enriched fluids exchange with components in the 
country rock and results in chemically altered host rock called a metasomatic or 
dispersion halo. The host rock becomes enriched in highly mobile alkali elements (i.e., 
Li, Rb, Cs) and volatile components (e.g., H2O, B, F etc). A similar group of elements 
(e.g., B, Be, Li, Rb and Sn) in dispersion halos is also diagnostic of Ta-enriched 
pegmatites although tantalum itself is immobile (ÄŒernÃ½ 1989b). 
 
Lithium is the most mobile exomorphic element in most rare-element mineralized 
systems, and can form halos many times larger than the pegmatite bodies themselves 
(ÄŒernÃ½ 1989b, Breaks and Tindle 1997).  Due to the superior mobility of the Li, it is used 
as primary element of choice in the current survey. According to Selway et al. (2005), the 
most extensive regional Li dispersion anomaly (100-750m x 7.0 km area) associated with 
rare metal pegmatites delineated to date in Ontario underlies the Mavis Lake area. Of this 
large historical anomaly, half of its strike length (~3.4 km) underlies the Fairservice 
claims and Property.  
 
The lithogeochemical survey utilized the newly cut gridlines. Samples were collected as 
close to the station pickets as outcrop would permit.  Exact sample locations are marked 
with an aluminum tag embossed with the unique sample number stapled to a 46 cm long 
lath.  A total of 335 samples were collected and were analyzed for lithium (Li) and other 
trace elements such as tantalum (Ta), cesium (Cs), rubidium (Rb), tin (Sn), gallium (Ga), 
niobium (Nb) etc. Two samples were assayed for gold (Au). 
 
Samples returned a range of values from 1.3 to 9780 ppm Li with 136 samples returning 
values greater than 50 ppm Li. Lithium values greater than 50 ppm are considered 
strongly anomalous as the average regional background for lithium in mafic metavolcanic 
rocks is 16 ppm (Breaks 1989). The 2009 fall sampling program extended the lithium 
dispersion anomaly approximately 1.1 kilometres northeast beyond the 3.4 kilometre long 
historical anomaly underlying the Fairservice claims and the Property (Figure 12). The 
lithium anomaly remains open to the east. 
 
10.2.3 Mapping/prospecting and Sampling 
 
Mapping/prospecting and sampling (grabs and channels â€“ Photo 2) were carried out in 
the latter half of the fall program with the objective of locating and sampling known 
pegmatites. All of the known occurrences were located and an additional pegmatite, the 
RVL, was discovered. More so, the Pegmatite 17 was extended 187 metres from its 
previously known length of 33 metres to 220 metres.

10.2.3.1 Results 
 
A total of 192 grab samples were collected during the course of mapping/prospecting 
mostly from outer boundary of the lithium lithogeochemical grid that included both 
pegmatites and metavolcanic country rocks. Expectedly, the granite pegmatites samples 
yielded the best rare metal values compared to their host country rocks. 
 
Of all the pegmatites, grab samples of Pegmatites 17 and 18 returned the highest lithium 
oxide values at 1.86 and 2.11 wt% Li2O (Table 8).  Pegmatites 11 yielded the best lithium 
oxide results from channel samples. Twelve channel samples were cut with values 
ranging from 37.4 ppm to 1.7 % Li2O.  A composite sample 4.7 m long returned 1.4% 
Li2O. Comparable channel sample results were also returned by the Pegmatite 18 from 
2009 summer field program ("Section 10.1" and Table 9). 
 
In addition to lithium, a number of pegmatites, particularly with associated sodic aplite 
and albitite, also returned highly anomalous tantalum, cesium and rubidium values. The 
most significant tantalum oxide (Ta2O5) results yielded by some of the samples of 
Pegmatites 14, 16 and 19 are 1246 ppm (0.12 wt.%), 1349 ppm (0.14 wt.%) and 593 ppm 
(0.06 wt.%), respectively. A sample of a sodic aplite vein with apatite-muscovite-rich 
selvedges situated near Pegmatite #19 returned the highest values of cesium (1537 ppm 



 46 

or 0.15 wt.% Cs2O) and rubidium (10,021 ppm or 1.02 wt.% Rb2O) (sample H373758 in 
Table 8).

All pegmatites, with exception of the RVL, produced Ta2O5 levels that exceeded the 
initial upper detection limit. The highest values came from Pegmatites 13, 14 and 16 



 47 

which occur within an area of 500 by 800 m that represents the presently minimum 
southeastern limits for rare metal mineralization on the property.  Samples from this area 
returned peak Ta2O5 values of 1349 ppm and 1246 ppm from the Pegmatites 16 and 14, 
respectively (Plate 1). This area of elevated Ta values is completely open to the east and 
southeast and warrants further field investigation to find additional mineralization. 
 

 
 
Plate 1: Mn-tantalite grain from pegmatite #16 â€“ photomicrograph is showing spectacular 
oscillatory zoning between high tantalum zones (bright white) and zone with higher 
niobium pentoxide (darker areas). Average Ta2O5 content of grain = 60.5%. Source: 
Tindle et al. 2002. 
 
Other highlights include Ta2O5 values of 723 ppm, 614 ppm and 593 ppm from 
Pegmatites 13, 17 and 19, respectively.  Sixty-nine of the 83 samples, which initially 
exceeded the upper detection limit of 122 ppm for Ta2O5, resulted in values greater than 
200 ppm Ta2O5 in the re-analyzed data set.   
 
Samples with very high tantalum values tend to have low lithium values as is typical of 
sodic aplite and albitite-rock units that represent important host-rocks for tantalum 
mineralization as exemplified by the Tanco Mine in southeastern Manitoba (ÄŒernÃ½ et al. 
1998; ÄŒernÃ½ and Ercit 2005) and the Wodgina Mine of Western Australia (Fetherston 
2004). However, there are samples with very high lithium values that also carry strongly 



 48 

anomalous tantalum.  Examples of this strong multi-element signature can be found in 
both grab samples (Table 8) and channel samples (Table 9). 
 
Tantalum mineralization occurs as fine-grained columbite-group minerals that are hosted 
primarily in sodic aplite and related albitite (>8 wt% Na2O).  Other tantalum-rich 
minerals may also be present as previous work confirmed wodginite associated with 
tantalite, columbite, lithium tourmaline and amblygonite-montebrasite at Pegmatite 19 
(Breaks 1989). 
 
Wodginite is the chief ore mineral for tantalum at the Tanco and Wodgina mines. The 
Tanco Mine had a historical reserve estimate of 1,879,000 tons grading 2160 ppm Ta2O5 
and has proven to be a world-class producer of tantalum, lithium, cesium and rubidium 
(ÄŒernÃ½ 2005). The QP is not able to verify the historical estimates of average grades and 
tonnage for the Tanco Pegmatite also situated within the Superior geological province. 
As such, these historical data are not necessarily indicative of lithium mineralization 
exposed on the Mavis Lake Property. Furthermore, it is cautioned that rare-metal 
pegmatites of the Dryden pegmatite field adjacent to the Mavis  Lake Property 
individually vary in terms of pegmatite type, modal mineralogy, grain size, internal 
zonation of rock units and Li2O content and therefore the lithium mineralization on 
the Mavis Lake Property may or may not compare with other lithium pegmatites of the 
area. 
 
 
10.3 Expenditures 
 
The estimated total amount spent on acquisition and exploration work in 2009 on the 
Mavis Lake Property is approximately $196,994.00. This total dollar amount was 
provided to the authors by TNR. A complete breakdown of the cost of these programs is 
listed in the Appendix "A". 
 
 
11.0 Drilling 
 
TNR or ILC has not conducted drilling on the Property. 
 
12.0 Sampling Method and Approach 
 
Two qualified persons (I.A. Osmani, P. Geo. and F.W. Breaks, P. Geo.) supervised the 
work program and sample collection during TNR's 2009 summer and fall field programs 
on the Mavis Lake property. A total of 527 grab and 17 channel samples were collected 
from the property (Figures 13, 14a, 14b and 15). Of the 527 grab samples, 335 samples 
were collected along the gridlines for lithogeochemical survey and 192 samples are from 
outside the grid area. 
 
The grab samples collected from the grid and various localities elsewhere on the property 
consisted of fresh pieces of bedrock collected over representative and mineralogically 



 49 

homogeneous areas of a given outcrop. Between 0.5 and 2 kg of rock material was 
selected as fresh chips and the sample size was dependent upon grain size. The 
metavolcanic units sampled on the lithogeochemistry grid and sodic aplite units, 
prevalent in the south and southwest part of the property, are dominantly fine-grained and 
0.5 kg was considered as an adequate sample weight. The spodumene units are coarser-
grained, with grain diameters in the 1 to 3 cm range and thus larger sample sizes were 
collected and at least 1 kg in weight.  
 
Lithogeochemical samples were collected from outcrop as close to grid stations as 
possible. The exact sample location was marked with an aluminum tag embossed with the 
sample number and stapled to a 46 cm long lath.  A GPS location and lithological 
description were collected at each station.  Stations where outcrop was absent are 
indicated by lath labeled with "N/S" for "No Sample". 
 
All samples selected for analysis were homogeneous with respect to grain size at the 
collection site. The authors are not aware of any sampling factors that could impact the 
accuracy and reliability of the chemical data. The QP cautions that grab samples are by 
nature selective and therefore may or may not represent average values. 
 
The 17 channel samples focused upon representative spodumene pegmatite and sodic 
aplite units of Pegmatite dykes 11 and 18 and possibly related pegmatites situated within  
25m of Pegmatite 11 (Figure 15). These samples were cut using a Stihl Cut-Quik rock 
saw.  Channels were cut to a depth of approximately 5 cm and 1 metre long where 
possible.  Samples were extracted using a hand sledge and a chisel or hatchet.  Intervals 
were marked with an aluminum tag embossed with the sample number and hammered 
into the channel cross cut at the start of the sample.  A GPS location was taken as a 
survey benchmark and then samples were located with a chain and compass from the 
benchmark.  In addition to sample location, a brief lithologic description of the samples 
was also taken in the field. 
 
Grab samples collected outside the grid area (Figures 14a and 14b) were located in the 
field with a handheld GPS unit. Samples sites were marked on the ground by a pink or 
orange flag with the sample number written in permanent marker. After taking notes of 
the sample material, the sampler then placed the sample material into a numbered 
(tagged) clean plastic sample bag in the field. 
 
Each sample was placed in a plastic sample bag with a unique pre-numbered tag either 
purchased from "Chaltrek Ostrom Outdoor" store in Thunder Bay (Ontario) or was 
provided by ALS Chemex.  A smaller sample was kept in a separate bag labeled with the 
sample number for reference.  Bags were sealed with plastic ties and grouped into larger 
tarpaulin (rice) bags for shipping.  Samples were either shipped to ALS Chemex in 
Thunder Bay by Greyhound or driven to Thunder Bay by an employee.  Reference 
samples were shipped via Greyhound to Dr. Frederick Breaks in Sudbury (Ontario) for 
storage and, if required, to conduct further study on these samples.

12.1 J. Garry Clark Samples 
 
J. Garry Clark selected three channel sample pulps to be re-analyzed by Activation 
Laboratories. The samples were picked up by the author from ALS Chemex Thunder Bay 
and delivered to Activation Laboratories Thunder Bay. The samples utilized the same 
sample tag numbers but had differing laboratory numbers. 
 
 
13.0 Sample Preparation, Analyses, and Security 
 
Samples from the 2009 program were prepared and analyzed by ALS Chemex 
Laboratory Group with check assays for lithium undertaken on 12 pulp duplicates by the 
Geoscience Laboratory of the Ontario Geological Survey in Sudbury, Ontario. Both 
laboratories are considered by the authors as industry leaders and accordingly we have 
confidence of high industry standards with respect to handling, preparation, analysis and 
security methodology. Both labs employ a stringent system of quality control by insertion 
of blanks, pulp duplicates of samples collected and international reference standards in a 
given lot of submitted material. 
 
The samples were submitted to ALS Chemex in Thunder Bay, Ontario, for preparation 
work that involved crushing and pulverization according to their Prep-31 procedure 
(Method codes LOG-22, CRU-32, SPL-21 and PUL-31).  Samples were logged into the 
tracking system and a bar code applied to each and then weighed, dried at 110 to 120 
degrees Celsius and finely crushed so that greater than 70% of the sample passes a 2mm 
screen (Tyler 9 mesh, US standard No.10). A split up to 250 grams was then taken and 
pulverized so that greater than 85% the material passes a 75 micron screen (Tyler 200 
mesh, US standard No. 200). The resulting pulps were subsequently shipped to their 
Vancouver-based analytical lab where analysis for Li, Ta, Cs, Rb, Nb, Ga and other trace 
elements (Ag, Al, As, Au, Ba, Be, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ga, Ge, Hf, In, K, La, 
Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Re, S, Sb, Sc, Se, Sn, Sr, Te, Th, Ti, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Zn and 
Zr) was undertaken . 
 
13.1 Analytical Methods 
 
13.1.1 ALS Chemex 
 
For geochemical analysis of rock samples, the lab's ME-MS61 package with a four acid 
digestion method was used.  Samples were treated with hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, 
perchloric and nitric acids.  This is a strong acid solvent capable of decomposing nearly 
all common rock forming minerals with the notable exception of resistate phases like 
barite, chromite, monazite, titanite or xenotime.  Select samples were assayed for gold 
with the Au-ICP21 procedure, Ta and Rb and other REEs with the ME-MS81 and ME-
MS81h procedures and Cs with the ME-XRF05 procedure. 
 
The ME-MS61 method was utilized for all samples except for those collected in the 
summer of 2009.  This procedure uses a minimum 1 g split of the 30 g pulp.  This 



 55 

procedure employs an Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP-MS), which 
is capable of determining the concentrations of 70 or more elements simultaneously by 
measuring the mass of ions generated by argon gas plasma heated to 8,000ÌŠ C and passing 
through a magnetic quadruple detector.  It is capable of ultra low detection limits (ppb to 
ppt) with very wide linear ranges (up to 7 orders of magnitude). 
 
Select samples submitted for Au analysis were subjected to the Au-ICP21 procedure, 
which is comprised of fire assay and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission 
Spectroscopy (ICP-AES).  Fire assay samples are mixed with fluxing agents including 
lead oxide and fused at high temperature.  As the reactants cool, molten lead exsolves and 
descends to the bottom of the vessel, collecting precious metals as it travels and leaving a 
borosilicate slag at the top of the vessel.  To win the precious metals from the leftover 
lead "button," samples are subjected to temperatures of 960Ëš-1000ËšC where the lead is 
volatilized and a bead of precious metals is left.  The remaining bead is subject to strong 
acid digestion and then analyzed using ICP-AES.  ICP-AES is similar to ICP-MS in that 
argon plasma is used to ionize and excite the samples.  In this case, however, the 
characteristic frequencies of light emitted by excited ions are measured and compared 
against known calibrating standards. 
 
Seventy-two samples were submitted for the rare element procedure ME-MS81 or ME-
MS81h.  ME-MS81 is a general procedure for Ag, Ba, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Er, Eu, 
Gd, Hf, Ho, La, Lu, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Pr, Rb, Sm, Sn, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, Tl, U, V, W, Y, Yb, 
Zn and Zr and ME-MS81h is a specific procedure for assaying up to 5% Rb and Ta.  The 
procedures are essentially the same and involve lithium borate fusion before digestion in 
strong acid.  The procedure is finished with mass spectrometry for the various elements. 
Eight samples were submitted for re-assay of Cs under the ME-XRF05 procedure.  This 
procedure also utilizes a lithium borate fusion.  However, rather than analysis by mass 
spectrometer or emission spectrometer, an x-ray fluorescence apparatus is used.  The 
XRF irradiates the sample with primary x-rays.  The excited sample emits characteristic 
x-rays, which are sorted and analyzed against calibrating standards. 
 
13.1.2 Geoscience Laboratories - Ontario Geological Survey 
 
The twelve samples collected during the summer program were all submitted first to ALS 
Chemex for preparation and analysis.  Pulps were then forwarded for check analysis to 
the Geoscience Laboratory of Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) in Sudbury, Ontario.  
Duplicate analysis served to confirm the accuracy of the ALS Chemex analyses (Table 
10). 
 
All samples submitted to the OGS Lab were and subjected two separate acid digestion 
and analysis procedures.  Digestion techniques were specific to the assay technique used 
on the samples.  Atomic absorption (code AAF-100) and the complementary open vessel 
multi-acid digestion and the ICP-MS (code IMC-100) with the complementary closed 
vessel multi-acid digestion techniques were used to analyze the samples.  Open vessel 
multi-acid digestion is designed specifically to break down most silicate minerals in a 
four acid solvent and is used by the OGS Lab for their atomic absorption procedure.  



 56 

Closed vessel digestion is designed specifically for ICP-MS and AES analysis.  Digestion 
is also with four acids but the beaker is closed to promote more complete digestion.   
The ICP-MS procedure utilized by the OGS Lab is essentially the same as that of the 
ALS Chemex laboratory.  The atomic absorption method is similar to the atomic 
emission spectroscopy procedure employed by ALS Chemex.  Samples are atomized by a 
nebulizer then directed through a radiation source.  The input energy of the instrument is 
set to a quantity characteristic of the absorption of a specific element.  The intensity and 
the spectrum of the light are measured to quantify the concentration of the analyate. 
 
13.1.3 Activation Laboratories 
 
Activation Laboratories' Quality System is accredited to international quality standards 
through International Organization for Standardization /International Electrotechnical 
Commission (ISO/IEC) 17025 (ISO/IEC 17025 includes ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 
specifications) with CAN-P-1758 (Forensics) and CAN-P-1579 (Mineral Analysis) for 
specific registered tests by the Standards Council of Canada. 
 
The author's samples were analyzed utilizing inductively coupled plasma mass 
spectrometer.  The digestion technique was total digestion that employs a lithium 
metaborate/tetraborate fusion. The resulting molten bead is rapidly digested in a weak 
nitric acid solution. The fusion ensures that the entire sample is dissolved. It is only with 
this attack that major oxides including SiO2, REE and other high field strength elements 
are put into solution. High sulphide-bearing rocks may require different treatment, but 
can still be adequately analyzed. For whole rock XRF analysis, the molten bead is poured 
into platinum molds to form a glass disk. 
 
13.2 Sample Security 
 
At the end of each day, samples were brought back to camp and stored in the secure crew 
cabin at the Bonny Bay Camp near Dryden, Ontario.  All samples were packed and 
readied for shipping on site by the field crew under the supervision of one of two project 
geologists (Justin Mundhenk and Gabe Jutras, G.I.T.).  Samples were delivered by a 
crewmember to the Greyhound depot in Dryden or directly to the ALS Chemex 
preparation facility in Thunder Bay, Ontario.  To the authors' knowledge, laboratory 
sample pulps, rejects and assay certificates are kept in secure locations for future 
reference, security and legal requirements. 
 
The author J. Garry Clark hand delivered the three selected check samples to the 
Activation Laboratory in Thunder Bay. 
 
14.0 Data Verification 
 
Historical data from Lun-Echo Gold Mines, Selco Mining Corporation, Tantalum Mining 
Company of Canada and Corona Gold Corporation has been incorporated into this report.  
The historical data reviewed and used are referenced and considered by the authors to 
represent the best standards and practices of the industry at the time. 



 57 

 
Due to recent re-emergence of interest in lithium and other rare-metals, as on the current 
Property, there was a need for due diligence on analytical accuracy and reproducibility of 
these metals in commercial laboratories, such as at ALS Chemex.  Thus, sample pulps 
were submitted to the well-regarded Geoscience Laboratory of Ontario Geological 
Survey in Sudbury, Ontario that has had long-term experience in dealing with the 
analysis of rare-metals. The results obtained from both laboratories are comparable 
although the OGS samples tend to be systematically higher which may possibly be due to 
incomplete digestion of spodumene and possibly tourmaline by the four-acid combination 
method.  Table 10 and Figure 16 summarize this trend.

14.1 Author's Visit and Analysis 
 
The author J. Garry Clark visited (September 10th, 2009) the property and examined the 
channel sampling of Pegmatite 11.  The sample channels were ice and snow filled and the 
author selected three samples to check. To check the sample values and analysis samples 
H372685, H372725 and H372727 pulps were delivered to Activation Laboratories of 
Thunder Bay. A comparison of the two laboratory results is presented in Table 11.  The 
author believes the numbers are quite comparable.

15.0 Adjacent Properties 
 
There are no past or presently producing rare metal mines in the area, although there are 
several occurrences/showings of merit on mineral properties in the area held by other 
individuals and mining/exploration companies. A lithium deposit, containing a historical 
(non-NI 43-101 compliant) resource of 500,000 tons @ 1.0% Li2O, occurs on the 
adjacent Fairservice claims (Storey 1990, p. 153). This historical resource estimate was 
calculated prior to the implementation of NI 43-101 standards therefore it is not 
current and should not be relied upon. The QP is not able to verify the historical 
estimates of average grades and tonnage for the adjacent Fairservice property and that on 
the Tanco Pegmatite also situated within the Superior geological province. As such, these 
historical data are not necessarily indicative of lithium mineralization exposed on the 
Mavis Lake Property. Furthermore, it is cautioned that rare-metal pegmatites of the 
Dryden pegmatite field adjacent to the Mavis  Lake Property individually vary in terms of 
pegmatite type, modal mineralogy, grain size, internal zonation of rock units and Li2O 
content and therefore the lithium mineralization on the Mavis Lake Property may or may 
not compare with other lithium pegmatites of the area. The authors have no means 
available to classify this estimate as a current resource (per CIM definition) nor is 
International Lithium Corp using these historical estimates as a current mineral resource. 
 
 
The style and setting of the rare metal mineralization on the Property is almost identical 
to the Fairservice claims. On both properties, the rare-metal mineralization, which is 
associated with albite-spodumene- and albite-type pegmatites with lithium, tantalum and 
beryllium, is genetically linked with the parent, peraluminous, S-type, Ghost Lake 



 59 

batholith (GLB). The pegmatites on both properties occur as swarm of flat-lying and near 
vertical dikes hosted mostly by the mafic metavolcanic country rocks. 
 
Other granite pegmatite-associated mineralization, such as the 'emerald' and 'tungsten' 
occur 5-7 km west of the Property. These occurrences are hosted within the mafic 
metavolcanic host rocks near the GLB contact. The emerald/green beryl mineralization, 
popularly known as the "Taylor Emerald occurrence", occurs within intensely 
metasomatized pegmatites along the contact with a meta-ultramafic unit.  
 
D. Petrunka discovered tungsten mineralization near Sharpe Lake in the late 1960s, 
which was later evaluated by Noranda Mines Limited. In 1982 Sanmine Exploration Inc. 
explored the Petrunka showing and adjacent area by extensive trenching and diamond 
drilling programs. The main showing revealed a historical value of 0.095 wt% WO3 over 
3.5 metres (Breaks and Janes 1991). 
 
Other significant rare metal mineralization occurs in the Gullwing and Tot lakes areas, 
located about 10-15 km northeast of the Property. The rare metal pegmatites, which occur 
as clusters in this area, have been named the "Gullwing-Tot lakes pegmatite group (GTG) 
by Breaks and Janes (1991). In addition to rare metal mineralization, such as Li, Ta, Cs 
and Rb, some of the pegmatites of this group are also mineralized with molybdenum 
(Mo), copper (Cu) and bismuth (Bi).

19.0 Interpretation and Conclusions 
 
Rare-metal mineralization in the Superior Province is spatially associated with 
peraluminous, two-mica, granitic and pegmatitic plutonic complexes that were derived 
through partial melting of a clastic metasedimentary progenitor followed by substantial 
geochemical evolution of the derivative granitic melts (Breaks et al. 2005). The Mavis 
Lake pegmatite group in the Dryden field provides one of the best examples of a genetic 
linkage between peraluminous S-type granites and rare-metal mineralization in 
northwestern Ontario (Breaks and Moore 1992; Breaks et al. 2005).  
 



 60 

The Mavis Lake pegmatite group, the eastern part of which is the focus of current 
exploration efforts of the company, additionally provides a good example of regional 
zonation amongst constituent members of pegmatite types and subtypes of the LCT-
geochemical family of ÄŒernÃ½ (1991).  A progressive evolution in degree of geochemical 
fractionation and mineral assemblages of these pegmatite types and subtypes with respect 
to increasing distance from the contact of the parent fertile granite is well documented 
(Breaks 1989; Breaks and Moore 1992):  
 
Beryl-bearing pegmatitic granite units in the GLB ïƒ external beryl-type pegmatite 
zoneïƒ albite-spodumene-type pegmatite zoneïƒ albite-type pegmatite zone. 
 
The albite-spodumene-type pegmatites contain the highest concentration of lithium of 
any pegmatite type and these large tabular bodies can achieve dimensions up to 90 metres 
in thickness and 1 kilometre in strike length (ÄŒernÃ½ 1989a). Historical measured plus 
indicated reserves can total up to 26 million tonnes grading 0.7% wt Li2O as documented 
at the Kings Mountain deposit in the tin-spodumene belt of North Carolina that was 
formerly mined by Foote Minerals Company (Kunasz 1982). This is a historical resource 
calculated prior to implementation of NI43-101 standards, therefore should not be relied 
upon.  The authors have no means available to classify this estimate as a current resource 
(per CIM definition) nor is International Lithium Corp using these historical estimates as 
a current mineral resource. This deposit was mined for chemical and ceramic spodumene, 
and mixed feldspar, quartz and mica products. 
 
Pegmatite 18 represents the largest example of this type on the property, and occurs as a 
system of stacked, flat-lying, en-echelon pegmatite sheets with a minimum strike length 
of 240 m and thickness of least 2.5 m for the largest sheet. This pegmatite is open in all 
directions. 
 
Albite-type pegmatites are considerably scarcer in the geologic record but represent 
extremely evolved systems (ÄŒernÃ½ 1989a) that may contain economically important 
tantalum concentrations. Examples include the Wodgina Main Lode and Mount 
Cassiterite deposits of Western Australia that respectively have historical proven and 
probable reserves of 0.402 Mt @ 0.128 wt.% Ta2O5 and 63.5 Mt @0.037 wt.% Ta2O5 
(Fetherston 2004). The QP is not able to verify the historical estimates of average grades 
and tonnage for the Wodgina Main Lode and Mount Cassiterite deposits. As such, these 
historical data are not necessarily indicative of tantalum mineralization exposed on the 
Mavis Lake Property. Furthermore, it is cautioned that rare-metal pegmatites of the 
albite-type situated elsewhere, as at the Wodgina Main Lode and Mount Cassiterite 
deposits, may individually vary in terms of modal mineralogy, grain size, internal 
zonation of rock units and Li2O and Ta2O5 contents. Therefore mineralization on 
the Mavis Lake Property may or may not compare with deposits at the Wodgina Main 
Lode and Mount Cassiterite. In addition, the authors have no means available to classify 
this estimate as a current resource (per CIM definition) nor is International Lithium Corp 
using these historical estimates as a current mineral resource.

A swarm of these pegmatites occurs within a minimum area of 500 by 800 m on the 
Property and consist of sodic aplite and albitite mineralized with tantalite, columbite, 
wodginite, white beryl and local green lithium tourmaline and amblygonite-montebrasite 
series minerals. TNR has recently documented maximum levels of Ta2O5 (1349 ppm), 
Cs2O (1537 ppm) and Rb2O (1.0 wt%) on the property to date in northwestern Ontario 
(TNR Gold Corp. News-Release - December 9, 2009). These rock types can also occur in 
highly fractionated, complex-type, petalite-subtype pegmatites as exemplified by the 
Tanco deposit in southeastern Manitoba where the tantalum mineralization is associated 
in part with layered to massive sodic aplite (ÄŒernÃ½ 1991; ÄŒernÃ½ 2005). 
Intense alteration of the mafic metavolcanic host-rocks due to interaction with pegmatite-
forming fluids led to pervasive tourmaline and anomalous bulk rock concentrations of Li, 
Rb, and Cs within an extensive geochemical anomaly. This anomaly can be traced at least 
7 km through the entire regionally zone progression of pegmatite zones in the MLG and 
varies in 100-700 m in breadth extent. Within the beryl-type pegmatite zone situated to 
the west of the company's property, the lithium dispersion zones within the Brownridge 
metavolcanics are related to holmquistite-bearing, lithium-rich high strain zones with 
albitites and also to sheets of tourmalinite where Li and Cs values up to 1820 ppm and 
332 ppm, respectively, were documented (Breaks and Janes 1991, Anthony 2004). 
 
The Property, which contains a swarm of albite-spodumene- and albite-type pegmatites 
with potential for lithium and tantalum mineralization, requires further delineation for 
both surface and blind rare-metal pegmatite bodies. 
 
The exploration program undertaken by TNR Gold Corporation featured variable 
densities of bedrock grab and channel samples (Figures 13, 14a, 14b and 15). High 
density grab sampling was undertaken at a spacing of 25 m on a cut grid with the purpose 
of verifying and extending historical lithium lithogeochemical anomalies in mafic 
metavolcanic host-rocks to lithium mineralization by Selco Incorporation (Pryslak 1981) 
and Tanco Exploration (Vanstone 1982). As lithium lithochemical anomalies in peer-
reviewed literature can be extensive (ÄŒernÃ½ 1989b), the 25 m sample spacing is 
considered by the authors to be very adequate in the delineation of previously unknown 
lithium bedrock anomalies and detection of new anomalies. 
  
Grab samples collected outside the cut grid in the southern and southwestern parts of the 
claim-group were taken at generally lower densities and more variable spacing compared 
to those from the grid. This work was mainly of reconnaissance scale only and intended 
to obtain preliminary chemical data at and adjacent to known rare-element-bearing 
pegmatites and sodic aplites. The sampling was mainly confined to five clusters (Figures 
14a and 14b) with sample spacing summarized below proximal to specific pegmatites: 
 

â€¢ Pegmatite 14: 35 grab samples with 5 to 250 m spacing  
â€¢ Pegmatite 17:  grab samples with 10 to 60 m spacing 
â€¢ Pegmatite 18: 10 to 50 m spacing 
â€¢ Pegmatite 19: 35 grab samples with 5 to 250 m spacing 
â€¢ RVL pegmatite: 14 grab samples with 2 to 100 m spacing 



 62 

â€¢ Unnamed pegmatites centred around sample locality H37264: 10 grab samples 
with 2 to 170 m spacing. 

 
Large parts of the claim-block, as in the northeast, east and southeast beyond the cut grid 
and in the southeast did not receive any sampling due to time and weather constraints. 
 
It is concluded that a systematic approach of exploration, which comprises rare-metal 
lithochemistry (Li, Cs and Ta) in the host Brownridge metavolcanic rocks coupled with 
geological and structural mapping and definitive mineralogical work in the rare-metal 
pegmatites bodies, be continued. This is particularly important with respect to the highly 
evolved albite-type pegmatites as the fine grain size has likely resulted in these 
pegmatites being completely overlooked in the historical exploration work. 
 
20.0 Recommendations 
 
Based upon the positive exploration results achieved by the company to date, an 
aggressive two phase $560,450 exploration program is recommended in order to further 
evaluate the lithium and other rare metals (Ta, Cs, Rb) potential of the Property: 
 

1. An exploration program, consisting of expansion of the existing grid so that litho-
structural mapping, prospecting, and lithogeochemical sampling of pegmatites 
and country rocks to be continued to the east, south and north of the grid. This 
work would potentially increase the strike length of the lithium lithogeochemical 
anomaly from the currently known length of 4.7 km, and may also help in 
discovering more rare-metal bodies in underexplored areas in the east and 
southeast parts of the claim block. 

 
2. Mineralogical evaluation work: verification and composition data for tantalum-

bearing minerals and important exploration indicator minerals (beryl, K-feldspar 
and muscovite) from the albite-spodumene and albite-type pegmatites via electron 
microprobe analysis. 

 
3. A small first phase of diamond drilling program, totaling 1500 metres, is 

recommended to be initiated, both in parallel, and subsequent to other field work, 
in the areas of known lithium and rare-metal pegmatites. This drilling program 
will potentially test the extent of the known rare-metal pegmatites (e.g., 
Pegmatites 11, 17 and 18), both laterally and at depth. 

 
4. A second phase of diamond drilling program be planned and executed, depending 

upon the favourability of the results obtained from the Phase I exploration 
program.
