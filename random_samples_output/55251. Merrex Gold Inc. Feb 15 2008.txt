SUMMARY 

The Jubilee zinc-lead property held by Merrex Gold Inc. (Merrex) is located in the Little 

Narrows area of central Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. In September 2006 Mercator 

Geological Services Limited (Mercator) was retained by Merrex to plan and supervise a 

diamond drilling program on the property and this program was ongoing at the effective 

date of this report. In mid-2007 Mercator was further tasked with completion of a mineral 

resource estimate for the Jubilee zinc-lead deposit that would be compliant with  

requirements of National Instrument 43-101 and Canadian Institute of Mining, 

Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions and 

Guidelines (the CIM Standards).    

Outcropping mineralization hosted by Lower Carboniferous Macumber Formation 

limestone was discovered at Jubilee in the 1920's and prospecting, pitting and minor 

underground investigation near the original showing were completed at that time. No 

commercial production is attributed to this early work. Between 1971 and 1978 Amax 

Exploration Inc., Texas Gulf Canada Limited, Getty Mining Northeast Limited Ltd., and 

St. Joseph Exploration Limited, among others, completed geological, geophysical and 

diamond drilling programs in the Jubilee district and results of these provided definition 

of both the Jubilee "Main Zone" as well as the related "Road Zone" areas of zinc-lead 

mineralization. Subsequent drilling by Falconbridge Exploration Ltd. in the early 1990's 

resulted in discovery of the new "Northeast Zone" area. All areas of significant zinc-lead 

mineralization outlined to date at Jubilee are spatially associated with northwest trending 

faults cutting Macumber Formation limestone, the most important of which is the Jubilee 

Fault. Stratabound breccia and replacement styles of zinc-lead mineralization 

predominate but mineralization within and along fault zones is also present.  

To address drill program planning and resource estimation requirements at Jubilee, a 

digital database of validated drilling results for both historic and Merrex programs was 

developed by Mercator. Database information and Surpac© Version 6.1 modeling 

software were used to generate a geological model of the Jubilee deposit and a three-

dimensional block model was subsequently developed. Zinc and lead grades within the 

block model were assigned using inverse distance squared (ID
2
) interpolation supported 

by 1 meter assay composites and a 150 meter by 35 meter by 35 meter interpolation 

ellipse. Block size was established at 5 meters by 5 meters by 2.5 meters and multiple 

domains were established within the deposit to accommodate dip changes along the zone. 

A minimum of 1 composite sample and maximum of 15 composite samples were used as 

limiting parameters for grade interpolation. The block model was completely constrained 

within deposit solids developed through interpretation of geological and assay sections.

Four separate orientation domains were separately modeled to accommodate changes in 

deposit plunge. In total, 67 drill holes intersect the deposit solid. Results of the resource 

estimation program are presented below and have an effective date of November 12

2007. The estimate is considered compliant with both the CIM Standards and National 

Instrument 43-101.

At the effective date of this report the main mineralized trend reflected in the block model 

remained open to the northwest, along the strike of the Jubilee Fault. In addition, Merrex 

drilling results included in the model provide definition of at least two new mineralized 

zones that provide potential for future exploration and expansion of the property resource 

base. All of these areas warrant additional work and both step-out and infill drilling 

programs have been recommended.

1.0 Introduction and Terms of Reference 

This report on estimation of mineral resources for the Jubilee zinc-lead deposit, located in central 

Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, was prepared by Mercator Geological Services Limited 

(Mercator) on behalf of Merrex Gold Inc. (Merrex) to comply with technical reporting and 

disclosure requirements set out under National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) and is considered 

compliant with Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards on Mineral 

Resources and Reserves Definitions and Guidelines  (Figures 1 and 2). Terms of reference were 

established through discussions between Merrex staff and Mercator in early 2007 at which time 

it was determined that the resource estimate was to be based upon a validated drilling database 

developed for the Jubilee project by Mercator. In addition to results for historical drill holes 

completed on the property, the database used in the resource estimate included results for 

twenty-eight drill holes completed by Merrex, for which the company had received analytical 

data. Of these drill holes, sixteen were completed during the 2007 drilling program, with the 

remaining twelve completed in 2006. 

To meet the resource estimate objectives, a comprehensive review was completed of all pertinent 

Nova Scotia government assessment reports, government and industry technical reports, digital 

government data (e.g. GIS database), published maps, and digital airborne and ground 

geophysical data. Data files, maps, sections, original report and memo drafts, laboratory reports, 

drill logs and other exploration data from the 1971 through 1978 period of property exploration 

by Amax Exploration Inc. (Amax) and Texas Gulf Canada Limited (Texas Gulf), and now held 

by Merrex, were also reviewed, as was data from the Falconbridge Exploration Limited 

(Falconbridge) programs of 1989-91, the Westminer Canada Limited (Westminer) programs of 

1992-93, Savage Zinc Inc. (Savage) programs of 1997-98 and subsequent Jubilee Minerals 

Limited (Jubilee) programs. The senior author of this report (M. Cullen) has substantial 

professional experience with respect to the Jubilee properties, having managed exploration 

carried out in the area by Westminer, Savage and Jubilee. Author P. Ténière managed the 2006 

and 2007 on-site work in consultation with Merrex staff and Mercator staff.      

Work completed to date has shown that stratabound and fault surface sulphide mineralization of 

potentially economic proportions is best developed proximal to the Jubilee Fault, a near vertical, 

northwest trending structure showing predominantly normal displacement. Sub-parallel 

mineralized trends have also been identified on the property, the best known being the Road 

Zone and Northeast Zone. At least two new mineralized zones related to faults parallel to the 

Jubilee Fault were discovered through drilling completed by Merrex during 2007.

Authors Cullen and Ténière, both professional geologists at Mercator, have met with Merrex 

staff on numerous occasions, beginning in July 2006 and Mercator maintained  a staff presence 

at the Jubilee site during the entire Merrex drilling program. Both authors visited the property on 

many occasions during the drilling campaign of 2006 and 2007 and during this time reviewed 

both mineralized and non-mineralized core as well as bedrock outcroppings. One author 

(Ténière) provided on site management for the entire 2006 and 2007 program. Core logging, 

storage, handling, sampling, quality control and security protocols with respect to the 2006 and 

2007 drilling programs were established through consultation between Mercator staff and 

Merrex management.

3.0 Property Description and Location   

3.1 General  

The Jubilee properties are located in the Little Narrows area of central Cape Breton Island, Nova 

Scotia, centered at approximately 45
0
 59' 52" North latitude and 61

0
 55' 59" West longitude 

(Figures 1 and 2).  Access is by way of Highway 105 to the Little Narrows exit, then easterly to 

the ferry crossing and subsequently along the Little Narrows Road, Ross Road, Cains Mountain 

Road, Cains Mountain Cross Road or St. Columba Road. The largest population center in the 

region is the city of Sydney, located approximately 75 kilometres to the east and the provincial 

capital city of Halifax is located approximately 280 highway kilometres to the west on the Nova 

Scotia mainland. The Jubilee mineral resource area is fully covered by Licences 06221 and

At the effective date of this report Merrex was the registered holder of Exploration Licences 

06221 and 06218, claims of the former being previously held by Aur Resources Inc. under an 

option agreement with Merrex (Cullen, 2005), and those of the latter being previously held by 

Jubilee Minerals Ltd. Records at the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources showed both 

licences to be in good standing at the effective date of this report. Merrex has advised that Teck-

Cominco Limited (through acquisition of Aur Resources Inc.) holds a 2% net smelter return 

royalty with respect to any production from Licence 06221. Terms of this agreement were not 

reviewed by the authors for purposes of this report.    

3.2 Summary of Exploration Title Information   

Mineral exploration licences in Nova Scotia are issued under the province's Mineral Resources 

Act (1990 and as subsequently amended - the "Act") and provide a licensee with exclusive right 

to explore for specified minerals within the licensed area, subject to terms and conditions of the 

Act. Individual claims held under a mineral exploration licence measure 16.188 hectares in 

surface area (~forty acres) and are renewable on a yearly basis. No equivalence to "patented 

claim status" exists under the Act. Retention of claims in good standing from year to year 

requires filing of annual renewal fees and documents for each exploration licence as well as 

meeting minimum yearly work commitment and reporting requirements. Fees and minimum 

work requirements set out under provision of the Act vary according to the year of licence issue 

and are summarized in Table 2.  Payment of cash in lieu of work on a claim or claims can be 

made once in any five year period.

4.0 Accessibility, Climate, Physiography, and Infrastructure  

4.1 Accessibility, Climate and Physiography 

The Jubilee properties are located in the Little Narrows area of Central Cape Breton, Nova 

Scotia, centered at approximately 45º 59' 52" latitude and 61º 55' 59" longitude. Access is by 

way of Highway 105 to the Little Narrows exit, then easterly to the ferry crossing and 

subsequently along the Little Narrows Road, Ross Road, Cains Mountain Road or Cains 

Mountain Cross Road.  

The area is situated in north eastern Nova Scotia, which is characterized by northern temperate 

zone climatic conditions moderated by proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and subject to local 

influence of the Bras D'Or Lakes system. Distinct seasonal variations occur, with winter 

conditions of freezing and substantial snowfall expected from late November through late 

March. Spring and fall seasons are cool, with frequent periods of rain. Summer conditions can be 

expected to prevail from late June through early September, with modest rainfall and daily mean 

temperatures in the 15 to 20 degree Celsius range. Maximum daily summer temperatures to 30 

degrees Celsius occur, with winter minimums in the minus 25 to minus 30 degrees Celsius range.   

Mineral exploration field programs can be efficiently undertaken during the period May through 

late November, while winter programs can be readily accommodated with appropriate allowance 

for weather delays and snow removal for site access.   

The properties show slight to modest topographic relief, rising from sea level at St. Patrick's 

Channel to a maximum of approximately 120 meters along the ridge of Cains Mountain. Areas 

underlain by evaporite bedrock typically show karstic surface features and have been broadly 

incised by established drainages. Highway 105 crosses the adjoining Merrex exploration 

property west of Saint Patrick's Channel and marks the base of a steep escarpment that rises to 

the plateau level of the Cape Breton Highlands to the west. Although outside the property area, 

elevations in the highland adjacent to the western property boundary exceed 200 meters above 

sea level. Forested areas predominate over most of the property with several recent and older 

clearcuts present. Mining operations and stockpiles of Little Narrows Gypsum Limited (LNG) 

have extended over some portions of the main Jubilee deposit and several areas of agricultural 

land use also occur in the immediate area. Isolated residential properties are present along the 

main highways crossing the properties and several residences comprise the community of Little 

Narrows, at the eastern terminus of the Little Narrows cable ferry.

4.2 Local Resources and Infrastructure 

The Jubilee area is rural and sparsely populated, with the largest local employer being the open 

pit gypsum mine and shipment facility operated by LNG at Little Narrows. Forestry industry 

interests are also well represented in the area and during the summer and early fall periods 

tourism operations are of substantial economic importance. The Strait of Canso Super Port is 

located approximately 80 kilometres to the southwest and plays an important part in the 

economic base of the region. This reflects employment of area residents in various operations 

located there such a paper mill and shipping facility, an aggregate quarrying and shipment 

facility, a gypsum fibre-board plant and export facility and a petroleum trans-shipment and 

export facility. A bulk coal marine terminal and electrical generating station are also present in 

Point Tupper. The ice free, deep water Super Port boasts safe access to major shipping lanes, an 

established vessel traffic management system and access to common user wharf facilities from 

which Jubilee concentrates could be shipped. Rail service is available at the Super Port and could 

also be accessed at the community of Orangedale, located approximately 10 kilometres by road 

southwest of Little Narrows - Jubilee.  

Presence of the gypsum mine at Little Narrows, another gypsum mine approximately 30 

kilometres to the southwest at Melford, and the multiple industrial sites at the Strait of Canso, 

have supported development of a local skilled trades employment base that could be drawn upon 

if development of the Jubilee deposits were to be undertaken. No local experience base exists 

with respect to underground hard rock mining but skilled coal miners and underground 

tradesmen previously employed in deep underground mining operations of the Sydney coalfield, 

60 kilometres to the east, represent a potential workforce source. 

5.0 History 

5.1 Introduction 

The history of exploration in the Jubilee area spans approximately 80 years, beginning with 

discovery of outcropping mineralization at the Jubilee showing in 1927 and continuing through 

to recent programs carried out by Jubilee. As noted in Cullen (2005a), Hein et.al (1988) reported 

on the Jubilee deposit under terms of a contract with the Geological Survey of Canada and as 

part of that project produced a detailed review of past exploration carried out in the area. The 

following point exploration summary reflects information presented therein for the pre-1989 

period and in Isenor (1976, 1978 and 1979). Additionally, it directly reflects review of post-1989 

reports from both government and Jubilee file sources pertaining to the properties. A listing of 

selected references documenting exploration programs carried out to date in the Jubilee area

appears in section 20 of this report. These are in part additional to those cited in the report and 
reflect various contributing components of the summary reported below.  
 
5.2 Summary of Past Exploration 
 
The following itemized summary presents a chronological review of the Jubilee Property 
exploration history including the Main, Road and Northeast Zones. The area of compilation 
extends beyond the limits of Licences 06221 and 06218 and therefore references some activities 
not directly related to the Licences.   
 
Discovery of Jubilee Zinc-Lead Showing and Early Drilling (1927-1963) 

• The high grade Jubilee surface showing was discovered and initially explored in the 
1927–35 period and early assessment of the mineralization was through trenching and 
development of two short adits. Face samples taken at the time returned up to 33.13% 
zinc and 12.25% lead over 1.60 metres in one of the adits. The other did not reach 
bedrock. 

 
• Four drill holes were completed near the showing in 1937 and these were followed by 

eight more in late 1948 by Maple Leaf Mining and Development Company in the 
showing area. MacIntyre Porcupine Mines Ltd. completed limited work on the property 
in 1963 after which little activity occurred for several years.  

 
Amax Exploration Inc., Texas Gulf Canada Ltd. (1973-1979) 

• During the period 1976 to 1979 Amax Exploration Inc. (Amax) and Texas Gulf Canada 
Ltd. (Texas Gulf) completed a total of seventy-nine drill holes under terms of a joint 
venture agreement, primarily focused within the present Jubilee deposit area. Amax had 
previously completed three holes and Texas Gulf had completed seventeen in the area. 
This work served to define the basic Jubilee model of hydrocarbon bearing zinc, lead, 
pyrite and barite mineralization hosted by limestone breccia adjacent to the Jubilee Fault. 
A preliminary tonnage and grade estimate for a portion of the main zone was prepared 
during this exploration period, details of which are discussed below in section 5.3.  

 
St. Joseph Exploration Ltd. and Getty Mines Ltd. (1972-1975)  

• Substantial work programs were carried out during this period by St. Joseph Exploration 
Ltd. and included mapping and soil geochemistry programs as well as completion of 
several diamond drill holes in the Washabuck area, several kilometres northeast of 
Jubilee. Getty Mines Limited also completed two drill holes in the Jubilee area.

Falconbridge Exploration Limited (1987-1991) 

Between 1987 and 1991 Falconbridge Exploration Limited completed an airborne 

magnetometer and VLF-EM survey over the district and also drilled thirty holes. Most 

drilling occurred within the deposit area and confirmed the extent of known 

mineralization, but several holes outlined a new area of breccia hosted mineralization, 

termed the Northeast Zone, located approximately 1 kilometre east of the Jubilee 

Showing.  

Westminer Canada Limited (1992) 

Westminer Canada Limited completed five drill holes in the district during 1992 after 

completing limited geophysical surveys (induced polarization, magnetometer and VLF-

EM) and soil geochemical programs. These tested regional targets and no drilling was 

completed on known mineralized zones. Galena, pyrite and hydrocarbon intersected in 

some holes provided further indication of mineralization potential along other untested 

structures in the area, but follow up work was not carried out.   

Savage Zinc Incorporated (1996-1999) 

During the period 1996 to 1999 Savage Zinc Inc. (Savage) reviewed data, optioned the 

property and completed five drill holes in the deposit area as well as four on other district 

targets. Two lines of high resolution reflection seismic surveying were also completed at 

this time across the northwest strike extension of the Jubilee Fault.  This work confirmed 

strike extension of the Jubilee Main Zone through significant mineralized drilling 

intercepts (e.g. 7.5% zinc and 1.00% lead over 1.80 metres in SJL98-04, 6.30% zinc and 

0.70% lead over 6.7 metres in SJL98-05) and also confirmed the importance of the 

Jubilee Fault surface as an exploration target through the SJL98–09 intercept that 

returned 2.31% zinc and 0.15% lead over 3.10 metres, including a 21 centimetre interval 

of 6.82% zinc and 0.02% lead, all within a broader 11.2 metre zone grading 1.06% zinc 

and 0.21 % lead. This intercept occurs approximately 50 metres above the Jubilee Main 

Zone elevation. The company also carried out several combined magnetometer and VLF-

EM surveys and drilled three short holes near Bucklaw, plus one near Washabuck, to test 

interpreted fault structures. These did not intersect the targeted Macumber Formation 

stratigraphic unit that hosts most known zinc and lead mineralization in the district. The 

company prepared two preliminary, in-house tonnage and grade estimates for portions of 

the main zone during this time, both of which are discussed below in section 5.3.        

Jubilee Minerals Limited (2001) 

In 2001 Mercator Geological Services Limited conducted a ground magnetometer survey 

at Bucklaw, west of St. Patrick's Channel, on the interpreted strike extension of the 

Jubilee Fault, near its intersection with an interpreted major northeast trending structure.

Data from this survey was merged with that from earlier surveys by Savage and re-

imaged to better define northeast and northwest trends believed to be indicative of 

bedrock faults.  

Merrex Gold Incorporated (2005) 

In 2004 Merrex retained Mercator to complete a valuation of certain portions of the 

Jubilee property, details of which are presented in Cullen (2005b). Subsequent to this, the 

company began exploration drilling in the district and completed a total of five holes 

(MX-05-01 to 05) (872 metres) on exploration licences in the Jubilee, Bucklaw and 

Washabuck areas. Cullen (2005a) reported on this work.  

MX-05-01 was completed to test an interpreted northwest trending structural feature that 

had not previously been assessed by drilling. The vertical hole cored gypsum and 

anhydrite with minor limestone before being terminated at 197 metres, therefore it did not 

intersect the Macumber Formation or any zinc and lead mineralization.  

MX-05-02 was completed in Bucklaw to test a northeast trending fault interpreted from 

previous ground magnetometer survey results. This 45º angle hole intersected Upper 

Windsor Group limestone and gypsum and terminated at 150 metres in red and grey 

siltstone and sandstone of the Horton Group. Steep bedding and structural indicators 

suggest a steeply dipping fault at the Horton-Windsor contact in this area. This hole did 

not intersect the Macumber Formation or any zinc and lead mineralization. MX-05-03 

was completed in Lower Washabuck to assess the Macumber Formation along an 

interpreted northwest trending structural feature. The hole was drilled to 137 metres 

before being completed in red conglomerate of the Horton Group. Minor amounts of 

barite were noted along fractures within the Macumber limestone, but no visible zinc and 

lead were recorded.  

MX-05-04 targeted the well-mineralized Jubilee Main Zone interval previously 

intercepted by Amax-Texasgulf drill hole ATG77-24 and was designed to test the Jubilee 

Fault above the Jubilee Main Zone elevation. This hole was drilled at a - 61º angle and 

encountered carbonate and carbonate breccia with fracture associated galena and 

sphalerite (within the fault zone) that returned an average grade of 1.31% zinc and 0.55 

lead over 2.85 meters of core length. The Main Zone was encountered deeper in the hole 

and returned an average grade of 12.26% zinc and 3.15% lead over 2.87 meters of core 

length, including a 0.90 meter interval grading 22.0% zinc and 4.30% lead.  

Drill hole MX-05-05 was completed from the same setup as MX-05-04 and drilled at a 

different azimuth and dip to provide a second test of the Jubilee Fault and the Main Zone.

A longer and more strongly mineralized fault zone intercept was returned from this hole, 

grading 2.71% zinc and 0.12% lead over 9.20 meters of core length. The Main Zone 

intercept is located approximately 45 meters from ATG77-24 and consisted of 10.7 

meters of variably mineralized carbonate, including a 0.55 meter section of banded 

massive pyrite at the base of the zone. Zinc and lead grades were lower than those of 

MX-05-04, the highest being 6.35% zinc and 1.06% lead over 0.50 meters or 2.81% zinc 

and 0.59% lead over 1.35 meters. Recommended future work included drilling in the 

Bucklaw area and further drilling of the Jubilee Main Zone and its northwest extension 

towards St. Patrick's Channel. 

Other Work and Research 

In addition to mineral exploration activities, the Jubilee area and deposit have been the 

subject of several government and academic publications or studies. These include an 

unpublished thesis by Stewart (1978) as well as the previously referenced work by Hein 

et. al (1988) and follow-up work by the same authors under Graves et. al. (1990). Fallarra 

and Savard (1998) discussed structural, petrographic and geochemical aspects of the 

deposit while Bertrand  et. al. (1998) studied hydrothermal alteration of clay minerals and 

organic matter in the Jubilee area. Lynch et.al (1998) studied the possible influence of a 

regional structural detachment surface to metallization in this area.  

5.3 Historic Mineral Resource or Reserve Estimates 

One historic preliminary tonnage and grade estimate for in-situ mineralization forming part of 

the Jubilee Main Zone is available in the public record (Sugden,1978). Documentation associated 

with two in-house preliminary estimates prepared for Savage (Mitchell, 1996 and Cullen, 1998) 

were also provided by Merrex for review. Results of these estimates are presented in Table 3 and  

pertain to areas currently held under exploration licences 06218 and 06221 held by Merrex. The 

mineral resource estimates mentioned above are not considered compliant with National 

Instrument 43-101 or the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum's Standards 

and Definitions for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Reserves (the CIMM Standards). As

such, they should not be relied upon.

The Sugden (1978) estimate was prepared during the course of on-going exploration and did not 

include all holes ultimately drilled by the Amax-Texas Gulf Joint Venture. The larger tonnage 

figure of the Mitchell (1996) estimate reflects use of data from all Amax-Texas Gulf Joint 

Venture holes as well as Falconbridge  holes completed subsequent to 1978. File documentation

Note: Estimates are not compliant  with CIMM Standards or NI 43-101 and should not be relied upon 

for the Cullen (1998) estimate was incomplete, but results of the first phase of Savage drilling 

and all Falconbridge drilling were incorporated. In all three estimates, drill-hole-centered 

polygonal methods of volume estimation were used along with arbitrarily assigned specific 

gravity factors reflecting general experience to estimate deposit tonnage. No comprehensive 

specific gravity data set is present in property files reviewed for this report. Metal grades reflect 

length-weighted drill hole assignments to influence polygons with subsequent tonnage-weighting 

or simple averaging for deposit grades.     

File information supporting these historic estimates was reviewed for this report and is 

considered reliable, with the caution that in all cases the estimates were originally deemed 

preliminary in nature. Based on such review, the estimates are considered generally relevant to 

evaluation of the property, particularly with respect to in-situ metal grade, grade distribution and 

continuity parameters within the specific areas included in the respective estimates.  However, as 

clearly stated above, they should not be considered reliable estimates of deposit tonnage and 

grade in the areas assessed. 

6.0 Geological Setting 

6.1 Regional Geology 

The Jubilee properties occur within the River Denys Sub-Basin of the Late Devonian to Lower 

Permian age Maritimes Basin of Eastern Canada. Basin-fill sedimentary sequences evolved from 

Late Devonian–Early Carboniferous rift fill clastic sediments represented by the Horton Group, 

to overlying marine evaporite, carbonate and fine grained clastic sequences of the Early 

Carboniferous (Viséan) age Windsor Group. The basal carbonate unit of the Windsor Group is 

termed Macumber Formation where it overlies Horton Group strata and Gays River Formation. 

In combination, these formations host most of the significant zinc-lead-barite deposits defined to 

date within the Windsor Group. Foremost among these with respect to past development and 

mining are the Gays River zinc-lead deposit in the Shubenacadie Basin of central Nova Scotia 

and the Walton barite, lead, zinc silver deposit in the adjoining Windsor Basin.

Windsor Group stratigraphy records a series of marine transgressions and regressions, beginning 

with an evaporite dominated initial cycle above the Macumber Formation limestone. Evaporite 

thickness in this interval locally exceeds 700 metres and can include substantial halite 

components. Subsequent cycles show increasing siliciclastic and decreasing evaporite 

components and are ultimately overlain by fine grained siliciclastic rocks of the late Viséan to 

Namurian age Mabou Group (Giles, 1981; Giles and Boehner, 1982; Lynch et. al., 1998).   

Map 2007-01 (Appendix 4) presents a summarized regional geological interpretation for the 

north eastern portion of the River Denys sub-basin near Jubilee and shows the location of the 

Jubilee Deposit. Along the southeast margin of the sub-basin, Horton Group strata dip shallowly 

northwest and unconformably overlie metamorphic and igneous basement sequences. Windsor 

Group strata typically overlie the Horton Group and both successions show faulted contacts with 

northeast trending metamorphic and igneous sequences to the northwest. This configuration 

approximates a half graben setting with thickest interpreted sections occurring adjacent to the 

faulted, northwest boundary of the sub-basin. Hein et. al. (1988 and 1993) and Graves et. al. 

(1990) cite drilling data as evidence of syn-sedimentary growth faulting within the Horton Group 

and Windsor Group sections.    

Recent re-interpretations of stratigraphic and structural relationships within Carboniferous age 

successions of Cape Breton Island indicate that substantial structural thinning may have occurred 

locally, resulting in stratigraphic omissions. These are interpreted as resulting from movement 

along a regional thrust surface termed the Ainslie Detachment.  Evolution of this structure has 

also been tentatively linked to localization of base metal sulphide mineralization in Macumber 

Formation brecciated limestone at various locations, including Jubilee (Lynch et. al., 1998).

6.2 Jubilee Main Zone Geology 

The Jubilee Main Zone is primarily a limestone breccia-hosted accumulation of zinc, lead and 

iron sulphides plus associated barite and hydrocarbon, localized in the upper portion of the 

Windsor Group's Macumber Formation. Most mineralized breccia is stratabound and spatially 

associated with the northwest trending Jubilee Fault or related sub-parallel structures such as the 

Road Fault and Northeast Fault . Recent drilling in 2006 and 2007 by Merrex confirmed 

presence of substantial zinc-lead mineralization occurring along additional northwest-trending 

fault structures that parallel the Jubilee Fault. Mineralization is preferentially developed along 

the downthrown sides of these structures in most areas but also occurs in relative up-thrown 

positions and along the fault surface itself. Drilling to date has defined breccia-hosted 

mineralization along at least 2.1 kilometres of strike length and at distances of up to 400 metres 

laterally from the Jubilee Fault (Figures 3, 4 and 5).

Geometry and grade distribution characteristics of the Jubilee Main Zone were originally 

documented by the Amax-Texas Gulf Joint Venture during the 1970's (Isenor, 1976; Graham, 

1979, Sugden, 1978). These define a shallowly northwest plunging mineralized breccia trend 

localized along the intersection of Macumber Formation limestone with either the Jubilee Fault 

or related sub parallel structures such as the Road Fault. Hein et. al. (1988, 1993) concluded that 

such relationships were attributable to syn-sedimentary faulting. Strongest breccia development 

corresponds with the location of a transitional contact sequence of interlayered limestone and 

anhydrite occurring at the top of the Macumber Formation. Intersections of the northwest 

trending normal faults with poorly defined northeast trending structures of indeterminate throw 

appear to be focal points of higher grade mineralization.  

7.0 Deposit Type 

The Jubilee deposit is a carbonate-hosted, stratabound zinc-lead-barite deposit that has been 

classified to date as showing affinity with both "Irish Style" base metal deposits and the broad 

Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) deposit class. The Irish Style deposits are stratabound and 

typically occur proximal to normal faults, some of which may be growth faults, which provided 

access for hydrothermal fluids. The principal sulphides are galena and sphalerite, which occur as 

replacements of host rock and as breccia matrix phases. These deposits are found preferentially 

in the lowest non-argillaceous carbonate unit in the host section and are formed from the 

intermixing of seawater derived sulphur–rich fluids and relatively sulphur-poor metal-bearing 

hydrothermal fluids. Barite and iron sulphides can be dominant or subordinate components.  

Mineralized zones in limestone or dolostone typically display hydrothermal dolomitic alteration, 

either as massive areas in the case of limestone or as stockwork veining surrounding the 

dolomite. Notably, dolomitic alteration has not been recognized at Jubilee.  

Timing of Irish Style mineralization is variable, with evidence of both early diagenetic and 

clearly epigenetic processes represented in many deposits. In some instances, evidence also 

exists for syn-sedimentary accumulation of mineralization, but emplacement of base metal and 

barite mineralization during early diagenesis seems most common. In contrast, MVT deposits 

typically show obvious epigenetic characteristics plus spatial association with regional changes 

in host sequence character such as stratigraphic pinchdowns, pinchouts around paleo-topographic 

highs or association with regional arch structures. Sub-classes of this deposit type, such as those 

of the Old Lead Belt and East Tennessee reflect direct association of epigenetic vein and breccia 

development with structural features such as faults, folds or breccias (Anderson and MacQueen, 

1982).

In recent years Jubilee mineralization has frequently been interpreted as showing affinity with 

the Irish Style subset of the broader stratabound, carbonate hosted family of deposit types. This 

provides a useful guide in planning of exploration programs, through focus on definition of 

structural zones intersecting preferable host stratigraphy. However, due to overlap of deposit-

scale characteristics of the MVT and Irish Style deposit types, features of both should be 

considered in exploration planning to increase likelihood of success.   

8.0 Mineralization  

Sphalerite and galena plus variable amounts of pyrite and marcasite characterize the sulphide 

assemblage present at Jubilee. They occur as disseminated and massive replacements of 

laminated limestone and limestone breccia, as breccia matrix filling phases, and in spatially 

associated veins and irregular vugs. Framboidal textures are common in some pyritic intervals, 

and colloform banding of pyrite and sphalerite is frequently seen. Barite is not pervasively 

distributed, but is a locally significant associate of sulphide phases, often occurring within 

faulted core sections (Figures 6a, 6b, 7a, 7b, 8 and 9).  

Fallara et. al. (1998) documented a paragenetic sequence from framboidal pyrite through fibrous 

calcite, pyrite/marcasite, sphalerite, galena and late calcite to barite–anhydrite-gypsum.  They 

also noted that liquid and bituminous hydrocarbon phases were present prior to and during the 

sulphide-mineralizing event, and that post mineralization hydrocarbon migration to fault zone 

sites had also occurred. Drilling observations have consistently shown that substantial amounts 

of hydrocarbon, particularly liquid phases, are spatially associated with zones of strongest 

sulphide mineralization (G. P. Isenor, 2004, personal communication).  

With respect to characterization of mineralizing fluids at Jubilee, Fallarra et. al. (1998) used Sr 

isotope data to suggest origin as brines from a clastic dominated basinal source, while Bertrand 

et. al. (1998) cite organic matter maturation data and clay mineral alteration data as indicating 

mineralizing stage temperatures of  150
0
 C to 230

0
 C.  These are higher than those seen in many 

MVT deposits but are similar to temperatures cited for the Irish Style deposits.     

9.0 Exploration  

Exploration activities carried out by Merrex since 2005 have focused on further definition of the 

Jubilee deposit through core drilling, with the 2006-2007 program being most significant. The  

2005 program included 2 drill holes in the immediate deposit area, results of which were 

presented in a technical report by Cullen (2005a) and summarized in section 5.0 of this report.

Exploration by Merrex in 2006-2007 was concentrated on the Jubilee Main Zone and primarily 

consisted of diamond drilling designed to extend the known Main Zone area of mineralization 

and to verify historic drilling results. Overall, the program accomplished three significant 

objectives:  

Drilling along strike to the northwest extended the length of Main Zone to over 2.1 

kilometres, this being from the Jubilee showing to St. Patrick's Channel. The Main Zone  

remains open in this direction and will be the subject of continued drilling by Merrex to 

potentially expand the deposit into the Bucklaw area, north of St. Patrick's Channel 

Step-out drilling adjacent to the Main Zone intersected two, and possibly three, 

previously unknown zones of significant zinc and lead mineralization. These are 

currently interpreted as mineralized fault zones developed parallel to the Main Zone and 

are  similar to, but distinct from, the Road Zone and Northeast Zone structures. Merrex 

also recognized that these intercepts could be associated with mineralized, but to date 

poorly defined, northeast trending cross faults. In either case, the new mineralization has 

potential to contribute to future resource estimates at Jubilee and will be the subject of 

further drilling. 

Infill holes provided confirmation and validation of historic drill results and 

mineralization styles within the Main Zone.  

10.0 Drilling 

10.1 General 

A total of fifty eight drill holes were completed on Merrex claims in the deposit area between 

September 2006 and December 2007. The 2006 drilling program focused entirely on Licence 

6221 with thirteen holes drilled in the northwest region of the Main Zone. The 2007 drilling 

program initially focused on the same area, where twenty-one drill holes were completed to 

further delineate the extent of zinc-lead mineralization along the Jubilee Fault. This work also 

confirmed presence of parallel mineralized zones. An additional twenty-four holes were 

completed in mid-2007 and these tested a portion of the  Road Zone mineralization as well as 

targets at nearby Bucklaw and Washabuck. The balance of Merrex holes tested regional 

exploration targets. Only drill holes testing the Main Zone, Road Zone, Northeast Zone and the 

new parallel zones of mineralization are pertinent to the current resource estimate.   

Company-specific details of drilling programs pertinent to the resource estimate are discussed 

below under separate headings. In each case, associated information, including lithologic and

sampling logs, assay results, collar survey data and down hole survey data were assembled from 
hard copy assessment reports filed with the Nova Scotia government, or from in-house data sets 
and reports provided by Merrex. Digital compilation of historic drilling data was carried out by 
Mercator staff and both hard copy source documents plus the digital files of associated drill hole 
data were subsequently validated for resource estimation purposes.

Logan Drilling Limited of Stewiacke, Nova Scotia was contracted to provide core drilling 
services for the 2006-2007 Merrex program and supplied both a diesel-powered skid-mounted 
Longyear 38 wire-line drilling unit equipped to recover both NQ and HQ size core (4.76 cm and 
6.35 cm in diameter respectively), and a Longyear 44 drilling unit also equipped to recover NQ 
and HQ size core. The latter drill was used only in the Bucklaw, South Cove and Cains Mountain 
areas where deep HQ coring was necessary to deal with difficult near-surface bedrock 
conditions. The company also provided all necessary support equipment, including a bulldozer

for drill moves and site preparation work.  Drilling was typically carried out on a 24 hour per day 

basis and the program was ongoing at the effective date of this report.      

Mercator provided a full-time project geologist (author P. Ténière) to supervise the drilling 

program, supported as necessary by additional Mercator staff. Merrex provided a site logistics 

manager and two support staff to facilitate day to day coring operations and logging functions, 

with project planning and oversight provided through consultation with senior Merrex and 

Mercator staff. All drilling, field and geological personnel were accommodated through local 

motel and restaurant facilities. Field support for Mercator included rental of one SUV for the 

entire field program and access to two buildings on site for logging and sampling activities. Drill 

core from the 2005-2007 Merrex diamond drilling programs is stored on site at the company's 

core secure storage facility at Little Narrows.  

The majority of collar locations for drill holes prior to 2005 were based on local grids used at the 

time of drilling, but some locations have been re-surveyed to the Nova Scotia MTM Zone 4 grid 

or deduced from historical maps or drill logs. The historical collar locations were converted to 

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 20 grid coordinates based on North American 

Datum 83 (NAD 83). All Merrex drill holes have been surveyed to the UTM NAD83 grid and 

are included in the project drilling database developed by Mercator for use in the Jubilee 

resource estimate. Merrex holes were typically tested for inclination and azimuthal variation 

using Flex-it© down hole survey instruments and results were incorporated in the project 

database for use in the resource estimate. All collars were transformed to a local grid for resource 

estimation purposes. 

11.0 Sampling Method and Approach 

11.1 Historical Drill Programs 

Pre-1971 Drilling Programs 

No information was reviewed pertaining to whether half or full core sampling was carried out. 

Mineralized zones appear to have been identified visually and sampling completed to cover those 

intervals with visible zinc, and/or lead and/or pyrite mineralization.  

1971 to 1978 Drilling Programs  

Drilling by Amax Exploration Limited, Texas Gulf Limited, and Getty Mines Northeast Limited 

was completed under direct supervision of company geologists and typically consisted of 

continuous half core sampling through the Macumber Formation target interval, with extension 

into the non-mineralized overlying anhydrite section and underlying Horton Group conglomerate 

section. Sample intervals were designed to reflect specific styles of mineralization and included

25

segregation of narrower sections of high grade mineralization to specific sample intervals. 

Occurrence of disseminated zinc, lead and iron sulphides in Horton Group conglomerates was 

commonly noted and sampling typically included such sections. In most instances, Macumber 

Formation target intervals were sampled, regardless of whether visible sulphide mineralization 

was present. Sampling was also carried out across any other lithologic intervals showing 

sulphide mineralization, with these typically consisting of thin (< 2.5m thick) limestone marker 

units within the thick anhydrite overlying the Macumber Formation.  

In all instances, half core archive samples were retained in marked core boxes and some core 

from these programs is available for review at the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources 

Core Library in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.  

1989 to 1991 Drilling Programs  

Falconbridge carried out work during this period under supervision of staff geologists from that 

company's regional exploration office in Windsor, Nova Scotia. All Macumber Formation target 

intervals as well as adjoining anhydrite unit and conglomerate unit sections were half-core 

sampled regardless of whether visible sulphide mineralization was present, and sampling was 

also carried out across several thin limestone intervals within the anhydrite unit overlying the 

Macumber Formation. In some instances these limestone show traces of sulphide mineralization 

and sulphides are also commonly present in the Horton Group conglomerates, particularly in 

broad proximity to areas of Macumber Formation mineralization close to the Jubilee Fault.  In all 

instances, half core archive samples were retained in marked core boxes and most core is 

available for review at the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources Core Library in 

Stellarton, Nova Scotia.  

.

1992 Drilling Program  

Westminer Canada Limited sampling procedures were similar to those of Falconbridge and 

earlier modern era explorers and were carried out under supervision of qualified company 

geologists. All Macumber Formation target intervals as well as adjoining anhydrite unit and 

conglomerate unit sections were sampled, regardless of whether visible sulphide mineralization 

was present, and sampling was subjectively carried out on limestone intervals within the 

anhydrite unit overlying the Macumber Formation.  

In all instances, half core archive samples were retained in marked core boxes and some core 

from this program is available for review at the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources 

Core Library in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.

1997 and 1998 Drilling Programs

Savage Zinc Inc. carried out these programs under management and supervision of one current 

author (M. Cullen) and sampling procedures closely followed those of Falconbridge and earlier 

modern era explorers. All Macumber Formation target intervals were half-core sampled as well 

as some adjoining anhydrite unit and conglomerate unit sections, regardless of whether visible 

sulphide mineralization was present. Sampling was subjectively carried out across several thin 

limestone intervals within the anhydrite unit overlying the Macumber Formation.  

In all instances, half core archive samples were retained in marked core boxes. Macumber 

Formation intercepts and associated Horton Group intervals were retained and initially stored at 

the Gays River Mine site in central Nova Scotia. During 2007 this core was moved to the secure 

Merrex core facility at Jubilee. In all holes, core recovered from the stratigraphic section above 

the Macumber Formation was given to Little Narrows Gypsum Limited for purposes of logging 

and analysis. This core is believed to have been discarded.   

11.2 Merrex Gold Drilling Programs (2005-2007) 

In 2005 Merrex retained Mercator to assist in development of protocols for core logging, 

sampling, project security and quality assurance/control procedures for the Jubilee project.  

These procedures were retained for the 2006-2007 program, with only minor changes.  

With respect to logging and sampling protocols, use of three tag sample record books was 

instituted to provide a more efficient means of tracking and recording samples through the 

splitting and archiving process. Samples were chosen based on lithology and mineralogical 

characteristics with minimum and maximum half core sample sizes of 30 cm and 100 cm, 

respectively. Generally, sampling began 2-3 metres above the Macumber Formation limestone or 

at the first visual indication of sphalerite, galena, barite or pyrite/marcasite mineralization, and 

was continuous through the limestone intercept to a minimum of four metres into the Horton 

Group conglomerate. Depending on the extent of mineralization at the base of the hole, more 

than four metres of conglomerate would be sampled for assay analysis. Sampling was also 

carried out across several thin laminated limestone intervals (marker beds) within the anhydrite 

unit overlying the Macumber Formation. The sample processing protocol included insertion of 

blank samples (non-mineralized anhydrite) and CANMET-MMSL certified standards. Half core 

archive samples were retained in core boxes labelled with weather-proof aluminium tape and 

stored at the secure Merrex core facility at Little Narrows.  

All core logging and sampling was carried out at the Merrex core logging facility at Little 

narrows. The first step in this process was a quick log of the core at the drill site and was 

followed by delivery of the core from the drill to the core logging facility where it was laid out

for detailed core logging. After detailed logging by a Mercator or Merrex staff, under supervision 

of the Mercator Project Geologist, the Macumber Formation limestone intercept, top of the 

Horton Group conglomerate section, plus other sections of interest, were marked for half-core 

sampling and then cut using a  rock saw. Split samples were placed in pre-labelled plastic bags 

along with a corresponding sample book tag and then sealed and laid out for checking prior to 

insertion of certified quality control materials into the sample sequence.  A maximum sample 

length of 1 meter was established along with a minimum sample length of 0.4 meter. Geological 

boundaries and limits of high grade intervals were typically respected.   

Conventional core logging procedures were standardized through use of a project lithologic 

legend and lithocode system with log information entered directly into PDA-based Logmate© 

software that could be easily integrated into the digital project database. Copies of the lithologic 

legend and associated lithocodes appear in Appendix 2.    

12.0 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

Mercator was responsible for all aspects of project security and established a core handling 

protocol to ensure appropriate control and supervision of core and core samples. This protocol 

specified covering of all core immediately after drilling, with delivery of covered core boxes to a 

designated Mercator or Merrex staff member after each drilling shift. Boxes were opened to 

allow preliminary logging at the drill site and then re-covered and transported to the secure core 

logging facility at Little Narrows. After completion of logging and sampling those boxes 

containing zones to be sampled were stored in a locked and secure building onsite. Samples were 

placed in sealed buckets for secure delivery by UPS Courier to ALS Chemex Laboratories (ALS) 

for ore-grade assay analyses. Only persons authorized by Merrex and Mercator were allowed to 

view the core, and the sampling facility was locked at all times when staff was not present. 

Upon arrival at ALS  core samples were subjected to standardized preparation procedures, which 

included digital log-in, weighing, drying, and fine crushing of the entire sample. Further 

preparation included splitting off 250g of each sample and pulverising to better than 85% passing 

75 microns for subsequent analytical procedures. The samples were prepared for inductively 

coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy analysis (ICP-AES) using the four acid "near 

total" digestion method to determine ore-grade assay results for Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn. If the 

corresponding Zn level was determined to be 1% or greater the laboratory was directed to 

analyze for Ba using the x-ray fluorescence (XRF) method after metaborate fusion. ALS was 

also instructed to split every 30
th
 sample in the sequence for duplicate analysis as a QA/QC 

measure. An additional reject split from the same sample was also prepared and returned to

Mercator for submission to Eastern Analytical Limited in Springdale, NFL for analysis by 

Atomic Absorption methods after multi-acid digestion. This methodology was used for all 

Merrex 2006-2007 drill core samples. Further descriptions of sample preparation and analytical 

methods pertaining to both laboratories appear in Appendix 2.   

13.0 Data Verification 

13.1 Review and Validation of Project Data Sets  

Government assessment reports and internal Merrex files consisting of core sample records, 

lithologic logs, laboratory reports and associated drill hole information for all holes used in the 

Jubilee resource estimate were reviewed by Mercator. Spot checking of historic digital records of 

drilling information used to create the resource estimate block model were manually validated 

against hard copy records. This consisted of back checking individual database lithocode entries 

against the source hard copy drill logs and assessing whether the lithocoding adequately 

represented originally logged rock types. Several minor inaccuracies were detected in both 

database lithocoding and sample record entries at this time and these were corrected. This 

generally positive result in part also reflected pre-resource estimate use of automated validation 

routines that detect certain data entry errors associated with sample records, drill hole lithocode 

intervals and both collar and down hole survey tables. All of these issues were addressed to 

establish a validated and functional drilling database considered acceptable by Mercator for use 

in a resource estimation program.  

13.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance   

13.2.1 Pre-Merrex Drilling Programs 

Assessment reports documenting previous Jubilee drilling programs do not specifically address 

QA/QC issues. Some evidence was noted of independent certified standards or check samples 

being submitted with core samples; such as Amax, Falconbridge, and Savage Zinc, but there was 

no mention of systematic submission of blank samples or systematic provisions for duplicate 

sample splits to be prepared and analysed. Laboratory QA/QC standards appear to have been 

generally relied upon by most companies to monitor precision and accuracy of analytical results 

and it can be assumed the assay results met the internal laboratory QA/QC standards of the day. 

On this basis, the Jubilee assay drilling results from Amax, Falconbridge and Savage are 

considered by Mercator to be of quality consistent with the industry standards of the day and to 

be acceptable for use in a resource estimation program.

13.2.2 Merrex Gold Drilling Programs 

Overview 

During its 2005 drilling program, Merrex completed two drill holes within the Jubilee resource 

area described in this report. ALS laboratories administered analytical standards, blanks and 

duplicate sample analyses to meet QA and QC requirements. Independent insertion of certified 

standards and in-house blanks was carried out by Mercator and duplicate analyses were 

requested for sample splits. Assay results for the 2005 Merrex drilling program are considered of 

sufficient quality for use in estimation of the mineral resources.   

During the 2006 and 2007 programs Merrex adopted a QA/QC program recommended by 

Mercator that included systematic insertion of Canmet certified analytical standards and blind 

blank samples as well as analysis of check samples by an independent commercial laboratory. 

More specifically, blind blank samples were inserted into the normal core sample sequence at a 

frequency of every 20th sample and sample tag books were pre-marked to ensure adherence to 

this system. Barren, massive anhydrite from the upper part of two drill holes was used for sample 

blank material.  Two certified laboratory standards sourced from CANMET-MMSL were used in 

2006 and 2007, these being FER-1 and KC-1A. Certified standards were inserted into the sample 

submission sequence by Mercator or Merrex staff every 40 core samples and assigned sample 

numbers within the continuous sample record sequence. Since standards were previously 

prepared, they were not blind to the receiving laboratory, but no recognition of their status or 

identity was included in sample support documentation submitted to the laboratory. Preparation 

and analysis of duplicate sample splits from every 30th core sample was also carried out during 

the 2006 and 2007 programs, with the duplicate analysis identified as such by the laboratory. 

ALS Chemex Limited (ALS), an independent and accredited commercial laboratory, provided 

primary analytical services for the core sampling programs carried out by Merrex during 2006 

and 2007. A third sample split was prepared from coarse reject of the duplicate samples for 

submission to Eastern Analytical Ltd. (Eastern) for purposes of independent check analysis. 

Certified Standard Program    

Two certified laboratory standards sourced from CANMET were used in the Merrex 2006 and 

2007 programs, these being FER-1 and KC-1A. Prepared standard samples were inserted into the 

sample submission sequence at intervals of every 40
th
 sample and assigned unique numbers 

within the continuous sample record sequence. Since these were previously prepared, they were 

not blind to the receiving laboratory, but no recognition of their status or identity was included in 

support documentation submitted to the laboratory. Analytical data for 15 certified standard 

analyses were received and Figures 10 through 13 present associated results for zinc and lead. 

Tables 5 and 6 present descriptive statistics.

Very good approximation of certified values is evident for both zinc and lead results returned for 

the FER-1A standard, values for which are generally comparable to grades seen in low grade  

Jubilee core sample data set. Zinc results for high grade standard KC-1A (34.5% zinc certified 

mean value) exceeded the upper acceptable limit for the standard in 7 of 9 samples with the  

mean exceeding the certified value by 1.99% zinc. Lead results for KC1A (2.24% lead certified 

mean value) are generally acceptable but show a bias toward and exceeding the upper limit of the 

standard's acceptable range.   

In contrast to KC-1A, both lead and zinc results for standard FER-1 consistently fall within the 

accepted range for the standard. Since samples of the two standards are distributed alternately 

throughout the core sample stream, the results described above are interpreted as indicating that a 

slight lessening in accuracy of the zinc and lead analytical results occurs at the high zinc levels 

seen in KC-1A. This could reflect a matrix or instrumental factor but could also reflect 

heterogeneity of prepared standard materials developed during handling, possible resulting from  

density stratification of the sample material. In either case, the KC-1A variation range requires 

follow-up which should include assessment of homogenization procedures for prepared materials

received by the laboratory, re-analysis of the selected standard pulps, and discussion of the issue 

with laboratory management.   

In light of the fact that standard FER-1A consistently returned good results for both lead and 

zinc, and that variance noted in the KC-1A zinc results only slightly exceeded 5% of the standard 

value, potential impact on analytical results used in the current resource is recognized but 

considered acceptable. As noted above, however, further study of the KC-1A results is 

necessary, and it is recommended that additional certified standards be procured that more 

closely approximate the mid and upper zinc and lead grade ranges seen in the deposit.  

Based on overall results, and as qualified above, the 2006 and 2007 certified standards results  

are considered acceptable for current resource estimation purposes.   

Blind Blank Sample Program    

As described previously, blind blank samples were inserted by Mercator into the sample stream 

at a frequency of every 20th sample and these were analysed for Zn, Pb, Cu, and Ag levels. Half 

cores of barren, massive anhydrite from the Windsor B subzone were collected from two Merrex 

drill holes for service as blank materials.  

Analytical results for a total of 46 blank samples from 2006 to 2007 drill holes were reviewed for 

purposes of this report. Results for zinc and lead are presented in Figures 14 and 15 and these 

show that sample background values for the analyzed materials are consistently repeated with 

only isolated exceptions. This is interpreted as indicating that no systematic problem exists 

within the data set with respect to consecutive sample cross-contamination from laboratory 

preparation procedures. Investigation of isolated divergent values showed that potential for low 

level cross contamination existed in the case of sample #81300, which contains the highest Zn 

and Pb values presented. However, the degree of such contamination, if present, is considered 

minimal (<100ppm) and would not meaningfully impact grade assignments in the resource 

estimate. Other potential explanations for observed results include (1) original sample 

heterogeneity, (2) low level contamination related to sample collection or core cutting practices 

at the project site, or (3) a non-systematic laboratory sample preparation or analytical factor. Re-

analysis of the split and adjoining samples is recommended in addition to review of on-site core 

saw cleaning practices with respect to cutting of blank sample core materials.

Duplicate Split Sample Program 

Duplicate sample splits were prepared from pulverised material for every 30
th
 sample submitted 

and these were analysed for Zn, Pb, Cu, and Ag levels.  In total, 29 duplicate pairs were 

reviewed for the current resource estimate and Figures 16 and 17 compare associated Zn and Pb 

values. Results depict generally acceptable correlation between sample pairs, with Pb values 

tending to be slightly higher in original split analyses. In cases of both metals it is apparent that 

analysis of a broader spectrum of metal grades would be advantageous. Modification of the 

current sample selection protocol is recommended to specifically include more samples of 

moderately to strongly mineralized core materials. Based on these results, and as also 

demonstrated in ALS Chemex internal quality control and assurance reporting, precision of the 

2006 and 2007 duplicate sample results is considered acceptable for resource estimation 

purposes.  

Independent Check Sample Program 

A check sample split was prepared from coarse reject material of every 30th core sample from 

the 2006-2007 drilling programs and this material was returned to Mercator after preparation at 

ALS Chemex. Check samples were subsequently submitted to Eastern Analytical Limited 

(Eastern) in Springdale, NFL  for analysis of Cu, Pb, Zn and Ag levels using assay quality 

procedures and atomic absorption analytical methods. As reflected in Figures 18 and 19, 

reasonable correlation exists between data sets. In two instances Eastern results for Pb clearly 

under report those from ALS Chemex but absolute differences are less than 0.03%. In the case of 

Zn, the greatest variance in results totalled less than 0.2% and most samples are closely grouped 

about the 1:1 correlation line. Due to the structured nature of sample selection, the data set range 

is less than that seen in the grade range of the deposit and most samples group at relatively low 

grade levels.  

Based on the above, results of the check sampling program are considered acceptable for 

resource estimation purposes. It is recommended, however, that the selection protocol for check 

samples be amended to provide coverage of a broader sample grade range.

15.0 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

No record was found of metallurgical or mineral processing studies being carried out on Jubilee 

zinc and lead mineralization by Amax Exploration, Texas Gulf, Falconbridge, Westminer, Aur  

or Savage. However, Jubilee Minerals Ltd. commissioned a preliminary assessment of gravity 

separation processing of high grade mineralization obtained from rock dumps in the Sp Jubilee 

Showing area, and results of this work carried out at DalTech in Halifax, NS were reported by 

Isenor (1988) as positive. However, due to the limited nature of such testing and exclusion of 

flotation methodologies, Mercator considers this program to have been incomplete.         

Fallara and Savard (1998) included petrographic descriptions of base metal sulphide and barite 

mineralization from Jubilee, and thereby provided useful information with respect to mineral 

associations, grain sizes of constituent mineral phases and relationships with limestone wall rock. 

While none of this was directed toward metallurgical assessment, future studies could benefit 

from consideration of these references.  

Review of information carried out for this report has shown that no complete and substantive 

studies of metallurgical testing or mineral processing have been completed to date for the Jubilee 

property.  

16.0 Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserve Estimates 

16.1 General  

The definition of mineral resource and associated mineral resource categories used in this report 

are those recognized under National Instrument 43-101 and set out in the Canadian Institute  

Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions 

and Guidelines (the CIMM Standards). Assumptions, metal threshold parameters and deposit 

modeling methodology associated with this estimate are discussed below in report sections 16.2 

through 16.4. 

16.2 Geological Interpretation Used In Resource Estimation  

For resource model purposes the Jubilee deposit is considered a carbonate-hosted, stratabound 

zinc-lead-barite deposit showing affinity with both "Irish Style" base metal deposits and the 

broad Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) deposit class. Mineralization is in most instances   

stratabound within Macumber Formation limestone and typically occurs proximal to normal 

faults which appear to have focused mineralizing fluids. Sphalerite and galena, plus variable 

amounts of pyrite and marcasite characterize the sulphide assemblage and occur as (1)

44

disseminations and massive replacements of laminated limestone and limestone breccia, (2) as 

breccia matrix filling phases, and (3) in spatially associated veins and irregular vugs. Framboidal 

textures are common in some pyritic intervals, and colloform banding of pyrite and sphalerite is 

frequently seen. Barite is not pervasively distributed, but is a locally significant associate of 

sulphide phases, often occurring within faulted core sections.  Mineralization of economic 

interest also occurs within and along the near-vertical fault zones, but this style of occurrence has 

been tested to date by only a few drill holes and forms a relatively insignificant portion of the 

current resource.   

All areas of zinc-lead mineralization included in the current resource are spatially associated 

with northwest trending faults cutting the Macumber Formation limestone and the most 

important of these at present is the Jubilee Fault. The resource area forms a northwest trending, 

elongate zone measuring over 2 kilometers in length that is dominated by the Main Zone with 

minor amounts of mineralization occurring within the adjacent Road Zone and Northeast Zone. 

16.3 Methodology of Resource Estimation 

16.3.1 Overview Of November 2007 Estimation Procedure 

The Jubilee mineral resource estimate is based on a three dimensional block model developed 

using Surpac © Version 6.01 modeling software and the validated project drill hole database. 

The model includes results from 67 diamond drill holes completed by either historic explorers or 

Merrex plus face sampling results from the historic Jubilee Adit. A complete set of interpreted 

vertical cross sections was first developed through the entire deposit area upon which a 

geological model was established. Sections were created using the local project grid at a nominal 

spacing of 100 meters but distribution of holes locally required expansion of section coverage. 

Assay information from core sampling as well as lithocoded rock types were presented on these 

sections to aid interpretation. The geological and grade distribution models developed from the 

sections were used to guide and refine the subsequently developed block model of the zinc-lead 

deposit.  

Assay results from the validated project database were first assessed through calculation of 

distribution statistics for both zinc and lead populations after normalization of results to a 

common 1.0 meter support base. Frequency distribution and probability plots were then prepared 

and reviewed. Based on results of these and subjective understanding of the mineralization style, 

no requirement for high grade capping of assay results was considered necessary.  

The manually interpreted geological and grade distribution cross sections showed that zinc lead 

grades of economic interest were closely associated with the Jubilee Fault, Road Fault and

45

related parallel structures within the modeled area. Good continuity of metal distribution along 

the northwest deposit strike is apparent, while lateral limits to stratabound mineralization within 

the Macumber Formation limestone are irregular in definition, showing substantial variation 

from section to section. In general, highest metal grades and thickest mineralized sections occur 

relatively close to the Jubilee Fault and thickness of mineralized intercepts decreases away from 

higher grade mineralized zones that are adjacent to the faults.  

In addition to stratabound mineralization described above, carbonate hosted sphalerite, galena 

and barite have been intercepted by drilling on the Jubilee Fault surface in at least one area. This 

style of mineralization is currently interpreted as conforming to the near-vertical fault surface 

and to have potential for grades and widths of economic interest. One small panel of such 

mineralized carbonate has been incorporated in the current block model.   

The resource block model was developed after calculation of weighted average intercepts for all 

available drill holes based on reported zinc and lead values. These were used to develop a series 

of three dimensional mineralization solids that respected the geological model developed earlier 

from cross sections. Several separate solids were necessary to properly distinguish mineralization 

domains showing contrasting dip and elevation configurations. Based on distribution of drill 

holes and the overall character of mineralization, development of useful variogram models for 

the deposit was considered unlikely and this was confirmed by calculation of experimental 

variograms in the area of highest Main Zone drill hole and core sample density.  In light of this 

result, prominent geometric aspects of the mineralized zones were used to constrain a grade 

interpolation ellipse which was then applied to the separate deposit solid domains using domain-

specific orientation components. Block grades were assigned within the deposit solids using 

inverse distance squared (ID2) interpolation methodology.  

Results of the grade interpolation process were checked against the geological cross sections to 

assess conformity and to assist in validation of the final deposit block model. A further check on 

the resource model was completed using nearest neighbour grade interpolation methodology on 

the same deposit solids. Resource figures reflecting several minimum grade thresholds were 

calculated for the block model and combined results constitute the final resource estimate 

documented in this report.  

Report subsections 16.3.2 through 16.3.10 below provide details regarding the resource 

estimation procedures and parameters summarized above.

16.3.2 Capping of High Grade  Assay Values 

Zinc and lead grades for all drill core samples were reviewed and descriptive statistics calculated 

for both the raw data and the data set reflecting 1 meter composite support. Distribution and 

probability plots were also prepared and all of these are included in Appendix 3.  In light of this 

information and the character of sulphide mineralization in the deposit, as reflected in drill core 

and bedrock samples, it was determined that no requirement to cap analytical results was 

necessary. The maximum zinc and lead grades at 1 meter composite support are 37.63% and 

9.80% respectively and are considered to reflect grades that can reasonably be expected to occur 

within the deposit and to be correlatable at the scale of several grade interpolation blocks.  The 

high grade samples are considered a meaningful part of the grade data set and to represent metal 

distribution characteristics in the subsurface that are significant at the scale of potential future 

development. In light of these determinations no capping factors were applied to the drill core 

dataset.   

16.3.3 Compositing of Drill Hole Data and Statistics 

One meter down-hole composites of uncapped drill hole assay values were created for each drill 

hole, with this length nominally representing the dominant sample interval used by Merrex in 

areas other than those showing thin concentration of visually determined high grade 

mineralization. As described earlier, descriptive statistics were calculated for the population of 

zinc and lead composites that occur within the resource solids and these were presented earlier in 

Table 6.  In total, 371 assay composites at 1 meter support are intersected by the resource solids 

and a complete listing of these appears in Appendix 3. These composites were initially used to 

support definition of resource solid wireframes and then used to calculate a weighted average 

grade for every drill hole cutting the resource solid. These intercepts were used in the nearest 

neighbour interpolation check model mentioned above and also appear in Appendix 3. The grade 

composites at one meter support were used in main ID2 resource block model.      

16.3.4 Calculation of Equivalent Zinc   

A zinc equivalent parameter was calculated to assist in defining resource solids. For this purpose, 

zinc equivalent was established as zinc equivalent = (zinc % + lead %)  on the basis of estimated  

averages of monthly London Metal Exchange spot market values for the two metals for the 

period July through  October 2007. This factor allowed direct comparison of current resource 

estimate figures with those of earlier workers who independently quoted the combined metal 

parameter. At the effective date of this report London Metal Exchange spot prices for lead were 

substantially higher than those for zinc (~$1.58US/lb lead versus $1.22US/lb.zinc – see 

Appendix 3 for support data), with this relationship being opposite to that seen earlier in 2007

when zinc was trading at substantially higher levels than lead. This highlights the need to be 

aware of equivalent metal calculation parameters and their potential for impact on resource 

evaluation efforts.  

With respect to the Jubilee block model, zinc and lead grades were separately interpolated into 

the block model and zinc equivalent values that appear in the resource statement were calculated 

from the average metal values defining the resource. As noted earlier, zinc equivalent values for 

1 meter drill core composites were also used to guide development of model solid limits. In this 

case, qualifying drill hole intercepts occurring within the solids had to meet or exceed a metal 

accumulation factor of 1.5 (zinc equivalent % x sample length or "MAF"). As reflected in the 

Appendix 3 listing of drill hole intercepts within the resource solid, only one intercept below the 

2.5 MAF level is present in the dataset. 

16.3.5 Variography  

The manually developed models of geology and grade trends based on drilling results provide 

clear definition of an elongate, narrow and proportionally thin zone of mineralization that trends 

northwesterly along the strike of the Jubilee Fault. The geological model also shows that 

mineralized zones associated with the Road Fault and Northeast Fault present comparable 

attributes at lesser scales of significance. Presence of mineralization laterally away from the 

northwest trending faults is typically stratabound within the Macumber Formation and/or the  

overlying transition zone to the Carrolls Corner Formation evaporite sequence. Sharp cut-offs 

between well mineralized drill holes and non-mineralized holes are commonly seen along lateral 

limits of the main bodies of stratabound mineralization, but continuity of mineralization trends 

and styles at closer proximity to controlling faults is recognized. All of the above characteristics 

have an impact on whether valid variogram models for the deposit can be readily generated, but   

the irregular drill hole and sample distribution pattern defining the deposit presents potentially 

the most important contributing factor.  

An initial assessment of variography for the deposit model was carried out by creation of 

experimental variograms within the best defined area of the Main Zone resource solid. Highest 

potential for development of useful results was considered to exist in this area, where greatest 

density of drill holes and core sampling coverage is present. Notwithstanding these factors, 

experimental variograms calculated at various lags along the interpreted trends of geological 

model continuity did not provide acceptable results. This is largely attributed to deposit geometry 

combined with relatively low numbers of available sample pairs and generally irregular spacing 

of associated drill holes.  The primary purpose of assessing deposit variography was to develop 

parameters for use in the block model grade interpolation ellipse. Results described above

showed that this expectation could not be achieved and on this basis the geological model 

approach described in section 16.3.8 below was pursued.      

16.3.6 Setup of October 2007 Three Dimensional Block Model  

Block model total extents were defined in local grid coordinates as being from 9435 meters East 

to 12440 meters East and from 9800 meters North to 11040 meters North. The local grid baseline 

(090 º Grid) is oriented at azimuth 317º (True) and both local grid and UTM Zone 20 (NAD83) 

coordinates were calculated for all drill holes and other significant project points. Drill hole and 

adit coordinates calculated for the resource model are included in Appendix 2. The model 

extends in elevation from minus 500 meters to plus 100 meters relative to sea level datum (ASL), 

with the nominal topographic surface at Jubilee being between 10 meters and 35 meters in 

elevation (ASL), depending upon location. All resource solids respect the bedrock/overburden 

surface.   

A standard block size for the model was established at 5 meters x 5 meters x 2.5 meters, with the 

minimum dimension nominally seen as corresponding to bedding thickness. A minimum sub-

block size of 2.5meters x2.5 meters x2.5meters was permitted to constrain the model along 
geological, topographic and peripheral solid limits. Descretization was 1 x 1x 1 and no block 

rotation was applied. The chosen block size reasonably reflects the laterally continuous, thin, and 

potentially grade-variable character of the deposit, as represented in the geological model and in 

core and rock samples. The chosen block size also provides a meaningful approximation of a 

mining unit size that might be applicable in development of this style of base metal deposit.     

The major lithologic units incorporated in the geological model were discussed in report section 

6.0 and, from stratigraphically oldest to youngest, consist of Horton Group siliciclastics, 

Macumber Formation limestone and transitional interbedded limestone and anhydrite of the 

Windsor Group, (3) anhydrite, gypsum and and minor limestone of the Windsor Group's 

Carrolls Corner Formation, and (4) interbedded gypsum, siltstone limestone and karstic sections 

of the Windsor Group's second depositional cycle (B Subzone). A listing of lithocodes used in 

the resource database appears in Appendix 2.  

Resource estimation was completely constrained within a series of deposit solids developed from 

systematic wireframing of interpreted mineralization envelope limits on the complete set of 

geological cross sections for the deposit area. The Jubilee, Road and Northeast faults as 

interpreted in the Merrex geological sections, were incorporated as discrete three dimensional 

elements of the block model and used to locally define resource solid limits. As noted in section 

16.3.4, a metal accumulation factor (MAF - zinc-equivalent % x total intercept length in meters) 

was also calculated for all drill holes and a 1.5 MF minimum threshold used to define sectional 

wireframe limits for resource solids. Lateral deposit limits were otherwise typically modelled at

midpoints between holes that marked the mineralized zone to non mineralized zone transition.  

In cases of isolated drill holes, rectangular resource solid polygons with strike extensions of up to 

50 meters northwest and southeast of a hole and 25 meters northeast and southwest of a drill hole 

were created.   

Due to spatial isolation of mineralized drill holes in the Road and Northeast zone areas, and 

interpretation of multiple discrete zones of mineralization in the northwest part of the Main Zone 

area, the term "resource solid" is best described as a group of discrete solids, the largest of which 

incorporates all of the Main Zone mineralization and therefore most of the resource tonnage and 

grade. With the exception of one solid based on analytical results for face sampling in the Jubilee 

adit, all were developed directly from composited drill core sampling results. In total, 16 separate 

solids were defined to properly model mineralization occurring on opposite sides of the Jubilee 

Fault and to accommodate spatially isolated mineralization occurring in the Road Zone, 

Northeast Zone and in new zones interpreted from Merrex drilling results.   

16.3.7 Material Densities  

Density factors for the block model were assigned using a calculation method incorporating both 

an assigned value for the limestone host rock and a value developed from relative proportions of 

zinc and lead occurring in sphalerite and galena present in a sample. Values were generated from 

interpolated metal block grades within the deposit solid and assigned to associated blocks. These 

values were multiplied by corresponding block volumes and results summed to obtain tonnage 

values for the block model. No grade–dependent contribution to density was assigned on the 

basis of barite content, but low analytical values (< 5%) for Ba were commonly reflected in 

analytical results for most mineralized samples. Future study of barite distribution within the 

deposit is required to better constrain its potential economic importance.  

The density calculation formula used for the block model appears below and follows application 

by Roy et. al. (2006) in feasibility study reporting for the Scotia Mine project in central Nova 

Scotia. At that location, carbonate hosted zinc and lead mineralization occurs within Gays River 

Formation dolomites that are lateral stratigraphic equivalents to the Macumber Formation 

limestones seen at Jubilee. The density calculation recognizes the contribution of zinc and lead, 

assumed to be present only as sphalerite and galena, to overall block density. Assignment per 

block is based on the metal grade factor plus a default density for the host rock. A 2.7 gm/cm
3

default factor for limestone host rock was assigned, this being slightly high for limestone but 

considered acceptable in light of the recognized low grade barite present in many mineralized 

intercepts. The density factor calculation appears below:

A review of density assignment procedures is currently being carried out for the Jubilee project, 

with an anticipated result being development of a database of specific gravity measurements 

based on laboratory analysis of core samples from all areas of the deposit. Results of this 

program could be used in future resource estimates to better constrain the density assignment 

process. For purposes of comparison, descriptive statistics for the drill hole composite density

16.3.8 Interpolation Ellipse and Resource Estimation 

Inverse Distance Squared (ID
2
) grade interpolation was used to assign block model grades, with 

blocks being fully constrained by limits of the resource solids. A search ellipse for grade 

interpolation was developed on the basis of the deposit geological model defined from 

interpretation of geological cross sections. Specifically, the elongate northwest trend of the Main 

Zone mineralization was initially used to define a major axis trend at 270º (local grid) or 313º 

azimuth (True) with the secondary axis defined at local grid 000º (043º azimuth True). The plane 

containing the major and secondary axes was determined to coincide with that of bedding in the 

deposit area, which strikes approximately 045º azimuth (True) and dips to the northwest at low 

to moderate angles (5º to 30º), depending upon location.  

Major axis range was set at 150 meters to include drill holes on adjacent sections that are 

separated by approximately 100 meters, as well as inclusion of intervening and irregularly 

spaced holes. Secondary axis range was set at 35 meters to reflect potential for moderately rapid 

attenuation of stratabound metal grade laterally away from the controlling faults. Minor axis 

range was also set at 35 meters to accommodate irregularities in the constraint solid surfaces 

combined with the maximum solid thickness of nearly 20 meters.

The deposit is flat lying or dips shallowly northwest in the Road Zone and Northeast Zone areas 

but in the Main Zone, northwest from the Jubilee showing, three additional domains of differing 

stratigraphic dip (and therefore deposit plunge) are present. Dip across all domains ranges from < 

5 º in the Road Zone area to approximately 30 ºdegrees in limited areas of the Main Zone. Plunge 

values for the mineralized zones are approximated by the full dip values of the host rocks, since 

faults controlling mineralization are oriented at nominally 90º to bedding strike in the deposit 

area. To accommodate the changing plunge of mineralization within the block model, 4 separate 

orientation domains were defined and grade interpolation within each of these was accomplished 

by slightly modifying search ellipse major axis orientation parameters for each domain. Since 

secondary and minor axes were set at equal value, the defining orientation parameters are major 

axis trend and plunge. Table 8 presents ellipse parameters pertaining to each dip domain.

 grade interpolation using the search ellipse described above was completed 

in each dip domain for both zinc and lead data sets, followed by passes using 50 meter, 40 meter 

and 30 meter ranges for the secondary and minor axes. Grade distribution results were modeled 

at thresholds of 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.25%, 3.5% and 3.75% zinc equivalent for all of these and 

compared to the cross sections used to develop the geological model. This showed that the 150 

meter x 35 meter x 35 meter interpolation ellipse provided the best fit of grade trends to the 

geological model and on this basis it was retained for final estimation purposes. Use of the 

smaller ellipse resulted in grade gaps occurring in some areas where reasonable geological 

certainty existed and the larger ellipse extended higher grade values to some areas that did not 

have sufficient geological support.  

The final resource model was generated by running the 150 meter x 35 meter x 35 meter 

interpolation ellipse within each orientation domain, with corresponding changes of major axis 

orientation attributes. Block grade, block density and block volume parameters estimated for 

each orientation domain at the assigned threshold values were combined to produce the final 

deposit tonnage and grade estimate. Results of the resource estimation program are presented in 

Table 9 below and are considered compliant with Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and

16.3.9 Resource Category Definitions     

Definitions of mineral resource and associated mineral resource categories used in this report are 

those recognized under National Instrument 43-101 and set out in the Canadian Institute of 

Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards On Mineral Resources and Reserves Definitions 

and Guidelines (the CIMM Standards). These are set out below: 

Mineral Resource 

A "Mineral Resource" is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic or fossilized 

organic material in or on the earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or 

quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, 

geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or 

interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.  

Inferred Mineral Resource 

An "Inferred Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be estimated on the basis of geological

56

evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade 

continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through 

appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. 

Indicated Mineral Resource

An "Indicated Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 

estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 

economic parameters to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the 

deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information 

gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 

workings, and drill holes, that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to 

be reasonably assumed.  

Measured Mineral Resource 

A "Measured Mineral Resource" is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or 

quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be 

estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and 

economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 

the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information 

gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 

workings, and drill holes, that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade 

continuity.  

16.3.111000 Resource Classification 

All mineral resources presented in the current estimate have been assigned to the Inferred 

resource category. This reflects consideration of several factors, including evaluation of grade 

distribution and continuity trends in both strike and dip directions within the deposit block 

model, as well as review of drilling results and drill core lithologic correlations. In combination, 

these show that discrete zones of higher grade zinc and lead occur within the deposit and that 

these are spatially associated with fault structures that are considered to have focused 

mineralizing processes. The current block model reflects the above through recognizable higher 

grade domains that respect the preferred northwest trending, plunging stratabound geometry 

reflected in the geological model.

57

Accurate geological correlation, interpretation of mineralized zone limits and lithocoding of 

geological information are important components in developing a deposit model and increasing 

confidence in the model can ultimately be reflected in higher order resource categories. With this 

in mind, the irregular drill hole spacing pattern that characterizes historic drilling over much of 

the Jubilee deposit is considered for the most part to meet requirements for definition of Inferred  

mineral resources. The detailed drill sections completed by Merrex are spaced at 100 meter 

separation and these too are acceptable for definition of Inferred category mineral resources.

16.3.11 Validation Of Model  

Visual Comparison To Geological Sections  

Results of block modeling were compared on a section by section basis with corresponding 

manually interpreted geological and grade distribution sections prepared prior to block model 

development. This comparison showed block model grade patterns to reasonably conform with 

the interpreted variably plunging stratabound character of the deposit. Results of the visual  

inspection are interpreted as showing an acceptable degree of consistency between the block 

model and the independently derived sectional interpretation, thusly providing a measure of  

validation against the geological model developed for the deposit.     

Comparison of Composite Database and Block Model Grades  

Descriptive statistics were calculated for the drill hole composite values used in the block model 

grade interpolation and these were compared to values calculated for block model figures 

calculated at the 2.0% zinc equivalent resource estimate threshold. The mean drill hole 

composite grades of 3.47% (Zn) and 0.86% (Pb) were found to compare favourably with the 

3.51% zinc and 0.77% lead corresponding grades of the block model (Table 10), thereby 

providing a check on the model with respect to the underlying total assay composite population.

Comparison of With Nearest Neighbour Grade Interpolation Model   

As a check on the ID2 block model grade interpolation methodology, a separate deposit model 

was developed using Nearest Neighbour (NN) grade interpolation methodology within the same 

resource solids used for the ID
2

method. At the 2% zinc equivalent threshold this resulted in 

definition of 3,480,000 tonnes at an average zinc grade of 3.62% and average lead grade of 

0.86% (4.48 % zinc equivalent). This compared favourably with the 3,460,000 tonnes at 0.86% 

zinc and 0.89% lead reported for the ID
2
 method. At higher threshold levels, grades from the NN 

model slightly exceeded those for ID
2
 but category tonnages were lower due to drill hole 

distribution (Table 11).

*Note: Zn Equivalent calculated as Zn Equivalent = (Zn% + Pb%) based on averaged July to October 2007 zinc 

and lead market pricing 

The higher metal grades at elevated thresholds were anticipated for the NN method and with this 

in mind, overall results of the NN model at the lowest threshold value were considered a 

reasonable check on validity of the preferred ID
2
 model results.   

16.4 Previous Resource or Reserve Estimates  

No previous resource or reserve estimates compliant with the CIMM Standards and National 

Instrument 43-101 exist for the Jubilee property. Three historic estimates of tonnage and grade 

for portions of the deposit are known to the authors and these were described in the previous 

discussion of exploration history presented in report section 5.0. The reader is directed to that 

discussion for further information. None of the historic estimates applies to the full area 

considered in the current estimate, but all provide useful insight with regard to the general 

character and disposition of zinc and lead mineralization at Jubilee. As stated previously, all of 

the early estimates are historic in nature and should not be relied upon.

17.0 Other Relevant Data and Information 

17.1 Environmental Liabilities 

Several site visits were conducted by the authors and other Mercator staff throughout the Merrex 

drilling program period between September 2006 and December 2007. These visits did not 

reveal any obvious environmental liabilities on the Jubilee property. Additionally, no such 

liabilities were communicated by Merrex personnel during the periods in which drilling activities 

were on-going, the current report was in preparation, or previous to these. However, this 

comment does not constitute a professional opinion with respect to environmental status of the 

property. It is appropriate to recognize that the property's location adjacent to the Bra D'Or lake 

system demands a high degree of diligence during exploration activities such as drilling. This 

condition would clearly apply to any future development or production activities. It is also 

appropriate to note that past gypsum mining operations on adjacent lands have resulted in site 

disturbances for which formal reclamation planning by LNG is in place.    

17.2 Surface Access for Exploration Purposes 

During the course of 2006 and 2007 drilling programs Merrex endeavoured to obtain permission 

from Little Narrow Gypsum Company Ltd. (LNG), a subsidiary of United States Gypsum 

Company Limited, to access certain lands in the area for the purpose of exploratory drilling. 

Permission to access these lands had been granted in the past. At the report date, however, the 

two parties had not come to an agreement on this point and LNG had earlier advised Merrex to 

refrain from any activities, including core drilling, on company lands.  

The authors note that the above restriction by LNG negatively impacts the ability of Merrex to 

complete infill core drilling along a portion of the mineralized Main Zone. This is potentially 

significant, since drilling in this area will be necessary to upgrade Inferred mineral resources to 

higher resource categories and to explore strike extensions of at least one new mineralized zone 

outlined by 2006-2007 drilling. Merrex has advised that at the effective date of this report it was 

still pursuing an agreement with LNG for access to these lands and that the Nova Scotia 

Department of Natural Resources has been informed of the situation. Nova Scotia's Mineral 

Resources Act addresses the issue of non-Crown land access for purposes of mineral exploration 

and provides certain avenues for review and resolution of such issues.  

Merrex owns surface title to a large area of land adjoining the LNG properties at Jubilee and a 

substantial portion of future infill or delineation drilling activities can be carried out from these 

lands or from adjacent lands for which the company has established and maintained separate 

access agreements with land owners.

17.3 Contact with Aboriginal and Other Communities  

During 2007 Merrex management established contact with First Nations communities in the area 

and met with their representatives to provide general information on the company's activities and 

future plans. Merrex has advised that this relationship will be further developed in future in 

combination with efforts directed toward other community stakeholders.      

18.0 Interpretations and Conclusions  

As detailed by Cullen (2005b) and various other workers, stratabound and fault localized zinc-

lead-barite mineralization, hosted by brecciated, Lower Carboniferous Macumber Formation 

limestone forms the exploration and development focus of the Jubilee properties. Some aspects 

of geologic setting and mineralization seen at Jubilee are comparable to the highly significant 

"Irish Style" class of stratabound zinc-lead deposits, while classification within the broader 

family of Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) zinc-lead deposits has also been proposed. Potential in 

both instances has been demonstrated for occurrence of economically important deposits of zinc 

and lead and Merrex has focused diamond core drilling programs on this potential since 2005.

Mercator was retained by Merrex in July 2006 to manage the company's on-going core drilling 

program at the Jubilee property, and to compile historic and Merrex drilling information in a 

digital database to support a mineral resource estimate for deposits defined to date. This report  

documents preparation of the mineral resource estimate and associated three dimensional block 

model. Results of the estimation program are reported below in Table 12 and are considered 

complaint with both the CIMM Standards and requirements of National Instrument 43-101.

19.0 Recommendations  
 
Based upon results of data review and resource estimation studies presented in this report, the 
following recommendations are provided with respect to future exploration and resource 
estimation efforts on the Jubilee property:  
 

1. Core drilling within and adjacent to the Jubilee deposits should be continued at a 
minimum drill hole spacing of 25-50 metres along drilling sections oriented at right 
angles to targeted fault zones. Section spacing of 100 meters is appropriate for initial 
assessment of strike extensions to mineralized zones but 50 meter spaced sections are 
necessary on an infill basis to better constrain continuity and limits of mineralized zones. 
This detailed information will be necessary to define Indicated and Measured  resources.  

 
2. To gain a better understanding of mineralization within and along fault surfaces, at least 

one angled drill hole per drilling section should be completed along mineralized target 
structures where fault separation, drilling conditions and target depth make this a 
reasonable strategy. Substantial opportunity exists in this setting for deposit expansion.  

 
3. Core logging, sampling, site security and data handling protocols currently in effect 

should be maintained, with implementation of RQD and expanded rock density 
determination programs in the next phase of drilling. Additional certified analytical 
standards that more closely match the entire deposit grade range should be incorporated 
in future programs and more specific coverage of the deposit range by additional check 
and duplicate samples should be established.    

 
4. Efforts should be directed toward finalizing access to the LNG lands at the earliest 

possible date.

Sample Preparation Package – PREP-31 

Standard Sample Preparation: Dry, Crush, Split and Pulverize 

Sample preparation is the most critical step in the entire laboratory operation. 
The purpose of preparation is to produce a homogeneous analytical sub-
sample that is fully representative of the material submitted to the laboratory.  

The sample is logged in the tracking system, weighed, dried and finely 
crushed to better than 70 % passing a 2 mm (Tyler 9 mesh, US Std. No.10) 
screen. A split of up to 250 g is taken and pulverized to better than 85 % 
passing a 75 micron (Tyler 200 mesh, US Std. No. 200) screen. This method 
is appropriate for rock chip or drill samples.

Sample Decomposition:               50% Li2B4O7 – 50% LiBO2 (WEI-GRA06) 
Analytical Method:                         X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF) 

A calcined or ignited sample (0.9 g) is added to 9.0g of Lithium Borate Flux 
(50 % - 50 % Li2B4O7 – LiBO2), mixed well and fused in an auto fluxer 
between 1050 - 1100°C. A flat molten glass disc is prepared from the 
resulting melt. This disc is then analysed by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry.

Assay Procedure – ME-OG62 

Ore Grade Elements by Four Acid Digestion Using Conventional ICP-AES 
Analysis 

Sample Decomposition: HNO3-HClO4-HF-HCl Digestion (ASY-4A01) 
Analytical Method: Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic 

Emission Spectroscopy (ICP - AES)*  

Assays for the evaluation of ores and high-grade materials are optimized for 
accuracy and precision at high concentrations. Ultra high concentration 
samples (> 15 -20%) may require the use of methods such as titrimetric and 
gravimetric analysis, in order to achieve maximum accuracy. 

A prepared sample is digested with nitric, perchloric, hydrofluoric, and 
hydrochloric acids, and then evaporated to incipient dryness. Hydrochloric acid 
and de-ionized water is added for further digestion, and the sample is heated 
for an additional allotted time. The sample is cooled to room temperature and 
transferred to a volumetric flask (100 mL). The resulting solution is diluted to 
volume with de-ionized water, homogenized and the solution is analyzed by 
inductively coupled plasma - atomic emission spectroscopy or by atomic 
absorption spectrometry. 

*NOTE: ICP-AES is the default finish technique for ME-OG62. However, under 
some conditions and at the discretion of the laboratory an AA finish may be 
substituted. The certificate will clearly reflect which instrument finish was used.

Eastern Analytical Ltd. Preparation and Analytical Procedures 

SAMPLE PREPARATION
ROCK/CORE
Samples are organized and labeled when they enter the lab.  They are 
then placed in drying ovens until they are completely dry. 
After drying is complete samples are taken and crushed in a Rhino 
Jaw Crusher to approximately 75% -10 mesh material. 
The complete sample is rifle split until we are left with approximately 
250 – 300 grams of material.  The remainder of the sample is bagged  
and stored as coarse reject. 
The 250 – 300 gram split is then pulverized using a ring mill to approximately 
98% -150 mesh material.
SOILS/STREAMS/SILTS
Soils are dried at 90

o
F.  They are then pounded with a rubber mallet in the soil bag.  Then the 

soil is screened through a 80 mesh screen.  The -80 fraction is rolled and kept as the sample.  The 
+80 mesh fraction is discarded. 

ASSAY PROCEDURE FOR CU/PB/ZN/NI/CO
A 0.200g sample is digested in a beaker with 10ml of nitric acid and 5ml of  
hydrochloric acid for 45 minutes.  Samples are then transferred to 100ml 
volumetric flasks and then analyzed on the AA. 
Lower detection limit is 0.01%, no upper detection limit. 

ASSAY PROCEDURE FOR AG
A 1000mg sample is digested in a 500ml beaker with 10ml of hydrochloric acid and 10ml of 
nitric acid with the cover left on for 1 hour.  Remove the covers and evaporate to a moist paste.  
Add 25ml of hydrochloric acid and 25ml of deoinized water, heat gently and swirl to dissolve 
solids.  Cool, transfer to 100ml Volumetric and analyze on the AA.Lower detection limit is 
0.01oz/t, no upper detection limit.  

PROCEDURE FOR AR-ICP30
Each rack is to contain one blank, two CanMet standards and 37 unknowns, of which two will be 
duplicates. 
A 0.500 gram sample is digested with 2ml HNO3 in a 95

o
C water bath for ½ hour, after which 

1ml HCL is added and the samples is returned to the water bath for an additional ½ hour.  After 
cooling, samples are diluted to 10ml with deionized  water, stirred and let stand for 1 hour to 
allow precipitate to settle. They are now prepared for ICP analysis.
