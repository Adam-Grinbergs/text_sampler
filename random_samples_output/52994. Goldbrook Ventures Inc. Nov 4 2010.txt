P & E Mining Consultants Inc. i  
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No.188 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
 
The following report was prepared to provide a NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report and 
Resource Estimates of the nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum, palladium and gold mineralization 
contained in the Bravo, Getty, Mystery, Pad, Sylvie and Timtu Deposits of the Raglan Project, 
(also referred to as the Raglan Property, Belanger Project, Belanger Trend), Nunavik, Québec, 
Canada. The centre of the Property lies at approximately 6825000N and 545000E in UTM 
NAD83, Zone 18. The Property is held 100% by Goldbrook Ventures Inc., ("Goldbrook") which 
has an Option-Joint Venture Agreement with Jilin Jien Nickel Industry Co Ltd on the Property. 
 
This report was prepared by P&E Mining Consultants Inc., ("P&E") at the request of Mr. D. 
Brian Grant, P. Geo., President and COO of Goldbrook. Goldbrook is a Vancouver based 
resource company trading on the Toronto Venture Exchange and the Frankfurt, Germany Stock 
Exchange. 
 
In June 2007, Goldbrook entered into an agreement with Novawest Resources Inc., 
("Novawest") to acquire all of Novawest's interest in its properties in the Raglan belt and 
associated assets. Goldbrook granted a 1% net smelter royalty on the Property to Novawest, with 
the exception of any portion of the Property that carries any royalty to any other person. One half 
of the royalty may be purchased by Goldbrook at any time for $1 million.  
 
In July, 2007 Goldbrook entered into an agreement with Cascadia International Resources Inc. 
("Cascadia") to acquire all of Cascadia's interest in its properties in the Raglan belt and 
associated assets. Cascadia was formerly in joint venture with Novawest.  Cascadia was also 
granted a 0.5% net smelter royalty on the Property, with the exception of any portion of the 
Property that carries any royalty to any other person other than Novawest. 
 
The eastern end of the contiguous part of the elongate property is approximately 17 km west of 
Kangiqsujuaq, an Inuit community on the Arctic coast, and extends 200 km west, and is up to 50 
km wide in a north-south direction. There are several smaller outlying claim blocks on the east 
end, west end and south side of the large contiguous block. The total area of the 8,596 individual 
mineral claims held in the name of Goldbrook Ventures Inc. is approximately 863,666 acres. The 
8,596individual mineral claims are in good standing. 
 
Air Inuit and First Air provide daily air service from Montreal and Val-d'Or to the coastal 
communities of Kuujjuaq, Salluit and nearby Kangiqsujuaq. Air service from Salluit also 
connects to the community of Radisson in the James Bay hydroelectric development area. 
 
The Raglan Project is located in Nunavik, northern Québec, Canada. The present logistical centre 
of the property is the Belanger Camp with accommodation for 80 persons. The camp is located 
approximately 95 km south of the Northern Village of Salluit, a regional community on the 
Arctic coast.  
 
The Project is located on a broad plateau, in an area of gently rolling topography north of the tree 
line, within the Povungnituk Range. The topography is characterized by moderate to steep east-
west trending ridges and valleys. Vegetation consists of sparse shrubs, plants and grasses, which 
grow to less than 25 centimetres in height. Outcrop ridges are generally bare rock, devoid of 
vegetation, where outcrop or subcrop is commonly reduced to heaps of frost-heaved blocks and 
boulders. The low areas between outcrop ridges are typically flat, grass-covered tundra traversed 
by small streams.

The base camp at Belanger is in the southwest portion of the Property. The Belanger camp has an 
approximate 300 metre airstrip suitable for Twin Otter STOL aircraft. No road network is 
available so all work is helicopter supported. The company establishes other temporary work 
campsites to support winter geophysics or fly camps for summer geological mapping. 
 
Heavy equipment (fuel, drill equipment, salt etc.) is sent by barge to Salluit and airlifted from 
there to the camp. Waste is returned to Salluit and disposed of there or sent south by barge for 
disposal. In recent years personnel and logistical support has been via Iqaluit in Nunavut. 
 
Historical work in and around the Property dates back to 1957, although there is mention of visits 
to the area by a mining syndicate as early as 1932. Goldbrook began acquiring portions of the 
Property in 2003. 
 
In 2003 the Novawest/Cascadia JV explored large portions of the Property. Goldbrook also 
undertook an exploration and drilling program in 2003 and 2004. In 2005 and 2006, large areas 
were explored and drilled by the Anglo American Exploration Canada, ("AAEC")/Goldbrook 
JV, as well as Goldbrook exploring and drilling certain sectors on their own. 
 
By 2007, the Joint Ventures had been terminated and from 2007 to 2009 Goldbrook has been 
adding on to the Property through staking or transfer of claims. In 2008 Goldbrook signed an 
Option-Joint Venture Agreement with Jilin Jien Nickel Industry Co Ltd to carry out exploration 
across the entire breadth of the Property. 
 
The Cape Smith Belt, in which all of the deposits of the Raglan Property lie, is an interpreted 
foreland thrust-fold belt that constitutes the north-eastern extension of the Trans-Hudson Orogen, 
an early Proterozoic collision zone, which separates the Archean Superior Province from the 
Proterozoic Churchill Province. The Trans-Hudson Orogen includes the Thompson Nickel Belt 
of Manitoba and the New Quebec Orogen (Labrador Trough) on opposite sides of the Superior 
Province. The Cape Smith (Ungava) Belt extends for 375 kilometres in an east-west direction 
across the Ungava Peninsula of Nunavik. 
 
The Property is located within the central portion of the assemblage, near the suture separating 
the foreland from the hinterland domains. The North Domain is dominated by the mostly 
volcanic Watts Group, which has been interpreted as an Island-Arc accretionary complex. The 
South Domain includes the Lamarche, Povungnituk, and Chukotat Groups, which are 
collectively interpreted as an extensional sequence consisting predominantly of basalt, sediment 
and ultramafic rock grading into oceanic crust toward the north. The boundary between the North 
and South domains is marked by the regional scale Bergeron Fault, considered to be a subduction 
zone. 
 
The geology of all six deposits for which there are currently resource estimates is essentially the 
same, though the morphology of each can be very different. The portions of the ultramafic 
complexes within which the deposits lie can vary considerably from horizontal to essentially 
vertical, and the proportions of massive to net-textured to disseminated sulphides can vary 
greatly depending on location within the intrusive complexes and the amount of structurally 
related remobilization. The mineral occurrences along the South Trend as well as those of the 
Raglan Trend to the north belong to the class of magmatic sulphide deposits, (Eckstrand, 1996). 
 
A broad group of deposits containing nickel-copper-platinum group elements (PGE) occur as 
sulphur segregations associated with a variety of mafic and ultramafic magmatic rock. Among 
such deposits, two main subtypes are distinguishable. In the first, the Ni-Cu sulphide type, nickel

and copper are economic commodities contained in sulphide-rich ores that are associated with 
differentiated mafic sills and stocks and ultramafic volcanic (komatiitic) flows and sills. The 
second type, magmatic PGE is mined principally for PGE's which are associated with sparsely 
dispersed sulphides in medium to large, typically layered mafic to ultramafic intrusions. 
 
As a group, magmatic nickel-copper sulphide deposits have accounted for most of the world's 
past and current production of nickel. International reserves of magmatic sulphide nickel remain 
large, though they are exceeded by those of lateritic nickel deposits, the only other significant 
source of nickel. 
 
Most nickel sulphide deposits consist of several closely adjacent, but discrete orebodies, 
therefore the definition of a "deposit" is rather arbitrary. Individual orebodies may contain from a 
few hundred thousand to a few million tonnes of ore, and in some instances tens of millions of 
tonnes of ore. Mining grades are generally about 1 to 3% Ni, but may be higher in some small 
deposits.  
 
Since 2007, all exploration and diamond drilling has been completed by Goldbrook. A total of 
48,741 metres in 279 holes has been completed in addition to regional scale airborne and ground 
surveys.  
 
In June 2008, Goldbrook engaged the services of Wardrop Engineering Inc. ("Wardrop") to 
undertake a metallurgical and mineralogical study to investigate the potential for the economic 
recovery of nickel and copper from the Getty Deposit on the Raglan Project.  
 
The test work was limited to undertaking a bulk flotation of the potentially marketable minerals 
with some limited upgrading (cleaning) of the initial (rougher) concentrate. The reagents that 
were chosen are typical of those used for these minerals without determining optimum dosage or 
addition points (Aero 3477, sodium isopropyl xanthate, and MIBCfrother, with lime added for 
pH control). 
 
Three bulk samples from drill core representing the component fractions of the Getty Deposit 
were tested at SGS Metallurgical Laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario. These included: 
 
• A massive sulphide composite containing 3.7% Ni and 0.9% Cu; 
• A net textured composite containing 1.5% Ni and 0.7% Cu; 
• A disseminated composite containing 0.65% Ni and 0.65% Cu. 
 
Almost 100% of the copper exists as chalcopyrite, and like the pentlandite, is liberated at a 
relatively coarse grind (80% at 92 μ for the chalcopyrite and 80% at 52μ for the pentlandite). A 
quantitative evaluation of minerals using a scanning electron microscope ("QemScan") was 
undertaken to map and trace the major and minor minerals in the sample. The main sulphide 
mineral is pyrrhotite (80% in the massive sulphide), with small amounts of pyrite. There was no 
arsenopyrite in the samples tested. Talc was also very limited and only present in the finer 
fractions. 
 
The resource estimates for all of the six deposits were completed to current and compliant NI 43-
101 reporting standards for mineral resource disclosure. Drilling was underway in 2010, however 
none of the 2010 data were included in the current resource estimate.

All metal prices were derived from the prevailing 36 month trailing average as of September 30, 
2010. Resources are reported in the Indicated and Inferred categories both within an optimized 
pit shell and with an underground component. The C$NSR cut-off values are C$40/tonne for the 
optimized pit component and C$120/tonne for the underground component.  
 
The six deposits are stretched out along a linear east-west trend approximately 30km in length 
generally referred to as the Belanger Trend. Each resource was estimated individually using 
Inverse Distance Cubed (1/d3) weighting of composited values, derived from a database 
containing 528 drillholes across the property. The average spacing of the drillholes in the 
individual project areas is in the order of 25m. 
 
October 1, 2010 P&E Resource Estimate for the Raglan Deposits 
 

 
(1) Open pit resources ("Pit") are tabulated at a NSR cut-off value of $40.00, and accumulated within an optimized

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
1.1 TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 
The following report has been prepared to provide a NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report and 
Resource Estimates on the six deposits situated on the Raglan Project, (also referred to as the 
Raglan Property, Belanger Project, Belanger Trend). This is the first time resources have been 
reported for Goldbrook's Raglan Project deposits (however, there has been resource information 
from the adjoining Jien Canada Mining, Nunavik Nickel Project of which Goldbrook is a partial 
owner).  

The Raglan Property (the "Property") has grown in size since 2003 when Goldbrook began 
acquiring it through option agreements and through direct acquisition of mineral titles from the 
Provincial government mineral tenure authority (northeast and northwest parts). The large 
Property was not contiguous until as recently as 2007, and was comprised of blocks of tenure 
across the expanse of the mineralized Cape Smith (Raglan) belt. These property components 
have been named based on locality of the tenure blocks and include from east to west along the 
belt, the Wakeham Property, the Ungava Property, the Masuparia Property, the Nuvilik Property, 
the Belanger Property, and the most recently added Bravo Property that connects the three 
western Nuvilik, Masuparia and Belanger Properties. The current focus of work on the Belanger 
Trend extends from the Novawest/Bravo Main Property westward for approximately 75 km. 

This report was prepared by P&E Mining Consultants Inc., ("P&E") at the request of Mr. D.

Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No.188 
 

3.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND TENURE 
 
3.1 DESCRIPTION AND TENURE 
 
The Goldbrook Raglan property has grown in size since 2003 when Goldbrook began acquiring 
the Raglan Property through option agreements and staking of mineral titles from the Provincial 
mineral tenure authority.  The large property was not contiguous until as recently as 2007, and 
was comprised of blocks of tenure known as, from east to west along the belt, the Wakeham 
Property, Ungava Property, the Masuparia Property, the Novawest Properties (comprised of the 
Bravo block [also called the Main block], Kozmo and western blocks), the Nuvilik Property, and 
the Belanger Property.  The Belanger Property was first to be acquired through option agreement 
in 2003 followed by the Wakeham, Masuparia and Nuvilik Properties in 2003, the Ungava in 
2003/2004, followed by the Novawest Properties in 2007.  Additional small tenure blocks 
acquired through option agreement and staking consolidated the titles into a large contiguous 
property with a few outliers and also added various target areas.   
 
In June 2007, Goldbrook entered into an agreement with Novawest Resources Inc., 
("Novawest") to acquire all of Novawest's interest in its properties in the Raglan belt and associated 
assets.  

Goldbrook granted a 1% net smelter return royalty on the Property to Novawest, with the exception 
of any portion of the Property that carries any royalty to any other person. One half of the royalty 
may be purchased by Goldbrook at any time for $1 million.  
 
In July, 2007 Goldbrook entered into an agreement with Cascadia International Resources Inc. 
("Cascadia") to acquire all of Cascadia's interest in its properties in the Raglan belt and 
associated assets. Cascadia was formerly in joint venture with Novawest.  Cascadia was also 
granted a 0.5% net smelter return royalty on the Property, with the exception of any portion of 
the Property that carries any royalty to any other person other than Novawest. 
 
The large Raglan Property is located in Nunavik, northern Québec, Canada. The present 
logistical centre of the property is the Belanger Camp with accommodation for 80 persons. The 
camp is located approximately 95 km south of the Northern Village of Salluit, a regional 
community on the Arctic coast. The eastern end of the contiguous part of the elongate property is 
approximately 17 km west of Kangiqsujuaq, another Inuit community on the Arctic coast, and 
extends 200 km west, and is up to 50 km wide in a north-south direction. There are several 
smaller outlying claim blocks on the east end, west end and south side of the large contiguous 
block. The total area of the 8596 individual mineral claims held in the name of Goldbrook 
Ventures Inc. is 349,514 hectares or approximately 863,666 acres. The 8,596 individual mineral 
claims are in good standing. 
 
A list of the individual properties comprising the Raglan Property and their respective areas is 
presented in the following table.

4.0 LOCATION, ACCESS, CLIMATE, PHYSIOGRAPHY &INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

4.1 LOCATION AND ACCESS 
 
The Raglan Property is located in Nunavik, northern Québec, Canada. The present logistical 
centre of the Property is the Belanger Camp with accommodation for 80 persons. The camp is 
located approximately 95 km south of the Northern Village of Salluit, a regional community on 
the Arctic coast. The eastern end of the contiguous part of the elongate property is about 17 km 
west of Kangiqsujuaq, another Inuit community on the Arctic coast, and extends 200 km west, 
and is up to 50 km wide in a north-south direction. The Property is centred at 6825000N and 
545000E in UTM NAD83, Zone 18.  
 
Air Inuit and First Air provide daily air service from Montréal and Val-d'Or to the coastal 
communities of Kuujjuaq, Salluit and nearby Kangiqsujuaq. Air service from Salluit also 
connects to the community of Radisson in the James Bay hydroelectric development area. 
 
Goldbrook uses commercial air services from Ottawa and Montréal to Iqaluit and Salluit during 
the summer months to support the exploration programs. Project logistics are facilitated by Air 
Inuit charter, Twin Otter (DHC-6), shuttle service to the Belanger camp from the coastal village 
of Salluit, Nunavik, or from Iqaluit in Nunavut. The Property can also be reached by helicopter 
from the nearby coastal villages. Daily fieldwork requires helicopter support. 
 
4.2 CLIMATE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Raglan Property is located on a broad plateau, in an area of gently rolling topography north 
of the tree line, within the Povungnituk Range. The topography is characterized by moderate to 
steep east-west trending ridges and valleys. Vegetation consists of sparse shrubs, plants and 
grasses, which grow to less than 25 centimetres in height. Outcrop ridges are generally bare rock, 
devoid of vegetation, where outcrop or subcrop is commonly reduced to heaps of frost-heaved 
blocks and boulders. The low areas between outcrop ridges are typically flat, grass-covered 
tundra traversed by small streams. 
 
The entire area is affected by permafrost resulting in the widespread formation of soil polygons 
and other soil solifluction features that form in response to a type of creep that takes place in 
regions where the ground freezes to a considerable depth and as it thaws during the warm 
seasons the upper thawed position creeps downhill over the frozen material. The soil moves as a 
viscous liquid down slopes of as little as two or three degrees and may carry rocks of 
considerable size in suspension. At Xstrata Nickel's Raglan Mine, the permafrost reaches a depth 
of 400 metres, and the average rock temperature is -6 Cº (Falconbridge Annual Report 1998).  
 
Elevation is 550-600 metres above sea level and the relief is subdued and ranges from 50 to 75 
metres. Overburden in the area is generally less than 20 metres in thickness (from drillhole 
information). The climate of the area is harsh, with summer (July and early August) temperatures 
ranging from 0 Cº to 20 Cº while winter temperatures range from 0 Cº to -50 Cº. Snow can 
accumulate in any month of the year, and parts of some sheltered ridges can remain snow 
covered throughout the year. The field season for surface exploration activities optimally lasts 
the months of June, July, August and early September, with some early winter snow expected in 
late August and early September. The area is subject to strong wind conditions and periods of 
dense fog.

4.3 INFRASTRUCTURE 
 
The Raglan Property has a base camp at Belanger which is in the southwest portion of the 
Property. The Belanger camp has an approximate 300 metre airstrip suitable for Twin Otter 
STOL aircraft. No road network is available so all fieldwork is helicopter supported. The 
company establishes other temporary work campsites to support winter geophysics or fly camps 
for summer geological mapping. 
 
Heavy equipment (fuel, drill equipment, salt etc.) is sent by barge to Salluit and airlifted from 
there to the camp. Waste is returned to Salluit and disposed of there or sent south by barge for 
disposal.  
 
The Belanger base camp is suitable to support up to 80 people during the season, and typically 
has one fixed wing aircraft based there and at least two or three helicopters, in addition to the 
drill contractor, who operates a maintenance shop.

5.0 HISTORY AND PREVIOUS EXPLORATION 
 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
This section is taken largely from Schau, 2003, with additions from recent publications and 
assessment reports (cf Daxl and Dressler, 2004). 
 
The permit region was first visited by Watts and McCart in 1932 on behalf of the Cyril Knight 
Syndicate. After the war a prospecting team was sent to the general area who located some 
showings in the Delta region, as well as at Kenty Lake. In 1957 the provincial government 
divided the Belt into blocks and put them up for auction. 
 
Kovik Québec Mines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Le Moyne Ungava Mines, a company 
controlled by Watts, obtained three of the blocks, which included parts of the permit region. 
Asarco optioned the blocks and conducted work in the region. 
 
The area was mapped by the Geological Survey of Canada in the years 1985 to 1987 at a scale of 
1: 50 000.  
 
Numerous other companies such as Rio Canadian Exploration Ltd., the Asbestos Corporation, 
Acquisitor Resources Ltd., Asarco Nickel Company Ltd., Cominco Ltd., Falconbridge Ltd., 
Imperial Platinum Corporation, Nuvilik Mines Ltd., and Tazin Mines (Quebec) Ltd., all 
conducted exploration in the area. 
 
In 1984 a Québec Provincial government team, led by Danielle Giovenazzo (also see 
Giovenazzo, 1985, 1989) sampled a showing with almost 17000 ppb Pd. Falconbridge acquired 
an exploration permit in 1986 and staked 41 claims. Other permits were acquired by Imperial 
Metals and other companies (Pitrie, 1988). 
 
A history of the acquisition of the Raglan Area Properties by Goldbrook is presented in Table 5-
1 on the following page. A summary of exploration history on the Property is presented in Table 
5-2.

5.2 RECENT PROPERTY HISTORY 

5.2.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Recent historical work on the Property is considered by the author to be that work on what is 
now the Raglan Property [or portions thereof] for which detailed reports are readily available. 
This was defined by the author to be work beginning in 2003 completed by the 
Novawest/Cascadia JV, and by Goldbrook, up to and including 2006. For the purposes of this 
report, all work from 2007 to 2009 inclusive is considered current and is discussed in Sections 
10 and 11. 
 
The Belanger trend (the west part of the Southern Raglan or South trend) has been the most 
productive exploration ground with all six principal GBK deposits (Mystery, Getty, Sylvie, 
Timtu, Pad, Bravo B-4) located there (see Table 5-3 Summary of 2003 to 2009 exploration).

5.3 2003 EXPLORATION AND DRILLING BY NOVAWEST/CASCADIA JV 

5.3.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
The Novawest/Cascadia JV, which became part of the Raglan Property holdings in 2007, 
covered a very large area, and was the subject of much exploration and drilling beginning 
principally in 2003. Limited exploration work had been completed by Novawest from 1997 and 
1998, (See Table 5-2). 
 
Novawest, acting as operator in the JV with Cascadia, undertook airborne geophysics, geological 
mapping and prospecting, lithogeochemical sampling, ground geophysics and beep mat surveys 
over the Property in 2003. Details of the extent of the work and the findings are presented in 
Table 5-4 below. 
 
Table 5-4: Summary of Exploration Work undertaken on the Property in 2003 
 

 

5.3.2 2003 DIAMOND DRILLING 
 
The following section draws heavily upon the assessment file report authored by Daxl, H. and 
Dressler, B., (2004) 
 
Thirteen holes were drilled in August and September 2003 on the Delta East-Juliet, Echo-E1, 
and Bravo-B4 grids. All holes were drilled BQ diameter. Table 5-5 below presents results of the 
most significant intersections from this drilling. 
 
Table 5-5: Significant Drill Hole Intersections 2003 
 

 
 
Results from the drill program extended the known mineralization at Echo-E1 and Bravo-B4, 
and according to Daxl (2004), suggested four types of mineralization which included sulphide 
dykes, hydrothermal Ni-Cu-PGE precursors, magmatic disseminated interstitial sulphides and 
PGE sill horizons.  
 

Year Operator Work Undertaken

Airborne geophysics 7,208 line-km on 100 m spaced flight path. Digital Terrain Model (DTM) constructed. 11,000 EM 
anomalies detected;  formational and potentially economic. Geological mapping conducted and compared to airborne 
geophysics results. Collection of approx. 623 rock samples, of which 100 passed a "filter" for Ni, Cu and/or PGE grades. 
Beep mat operation and collection of 67 samples of which 11 passed the "filter". 

Novawest

Ground geophysics HLEM conducted over previously known prospective areas - five grids for a total of 65 line-km with 
stations on 25 m. Several anomalies detected and followed up with drilling on Delta East Grid. Generally the HLEM 
anomalies were of little interest.

5.3.3 2003 SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
During the drill program, core recovery was excellent, and was not a factor affecting the 
accuracy or reliability of results. Significant mineralization encountered was typically 
disseminated, net-textured to semi-massive and massive sulphides hosted by pyroxenite. 
 
Mineralized intercepts were continuously sampled and bracketed with samples of barren or 
poorly mineralized material. Core sample lengths were not established at exact intervals, but 
varied somewhat, based on heterogeneity of sulphide density, texture or constituent mineralogy. 
Sampling of material most likely to be barren, i.e. banded pyrrhotite hosted by graphitic argillite, 
was not done systematically, but rather examples of better mineralized material were selected for 
verification purposes. 
 
Novawest sent all samples to ALS Chemex Laboratories. ALS Chemex is an internationally 
recognized minerals testing laboratory operating in 16 countries and has an ISO 9001:2000 
certification. The laboratory in Vancouver has also been accredited to ISO 17025 standards for 
specific laboratory procedures by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC). 
 
Nickel, copper and cobalt were analyzed using an aqua regia digest with either an atomic 
absorption spectrometry (AA) or inductively coupled plasma (ICP) read. Gold, platinum and 
palladium were analyzed using lead collection fire assay with an AA read on either a 30 or 50 
gram aliquot.  
 
5.4 2003 EXPLORATION AND DRILLING BY GOLDBROOK 
 
In 2003 GBK undertook reconnaissance prospecting, mapping and investigation of geophysical 
targets (anomalies from a DIGHEM survey), and drilled 1,068 metres in 11 exploration holes on 
its eastern Wakeham and Ungava properties, and also completed an AeroTEM surveys on part of 
the Wakeham property and part of the western Belanger property (Kiddie, 2004).  GBK 
contracted AeroQuest Ltd to fly the AeroTEM airborne magnetic and time domain 
electromagnetic survey over selected areas of the properties.  These data were employed in the 
planning of field surveys and generation of drill targets on the Wakeham, Ungava and Belanger 
properties. Disseminated sulfide showings were discovered in ultramafic rocks at Nancy, eastern 
Wakeham property.  Nancy grab samples assayed up to 0.4% Ni, 0.6% Cu and 2 g/t Pt+Pd.  Two 
of three drill holes (GBW03-01 to 03) on the Wakeham property at the Nancy showing 
intersected anomalous but weakly disseminated mineralization in ultramafic rock.  Drilling at 
eight Ungava property targets (GBU03-01 to 08) failed to intersect significant Ni-Cu-PGE 
mineralization.  
 
5.5  2004 EXPLORATION AND DRILLING BY GOLDBROOK 
 
In 2004, Goldbrook acquired a portion of the Bélanger Property, which at the time was referred 
to by Goldbrook as simply "The Belanger Property". The Property was just over 38,000 hectares 
in size. 
 
The Belanger Property in 2004 was bound on the north side by properties held by Falconbridge 
Ltd., Novawest Resources and Knight Petroleum/Anglo American, and was connected to 
Goldbrook's Nuvilik Property to the north by a single column of claims sandwiched between 
concessions held by Falconbridge and Novawest. The property was bound on the south side by 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 18 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No.188 
 

properties held by Resolve Ventures and Acrex Ventures, and a small claim block controlled by 
Golden Valley/Little Mountain abutted the Bélanger Property at its eastern extremity. 

5.4.1 2004 EXPLORATION 
 
The following sections on 2004 exploration and drilling rely heavily on the 2004 report authored 
by Alexander Kiddie, P.Geo. 
 
The summer 2004 exploration program conducted by Goldbrook included a variably medium to 
high-resolution (100m to 200m line-spacing) AEROTEM airborne magnetic time-domain 
electromagnetic survey over the entire Property, (less the 2003 survey area), property-wide 
geological mapping, prospecting and sampling, verification of selected airborne geophysical 
targets, detailed work on a 450m by 300m grid covering the Getty Zone, expansion of the grid to 
2200m by 600m to cover the newly discovered Sylvie Zone, detailed mapping over the extended 
grid, a FLTEM (fixed-loop transient electromagnetic) survey over portions of the grid and 
drilling of 44 diamond drill holes totalling 5,853 meters. 
 
Prospecting efforts resulted in the discovery of a number of new Cu-Ni-PGE showings, which, 
along with the historically known Getty Zone and Pillow Lake showings help define the 
Bélanger Trend.  
 
The eastern and western limits of observed and sampled anomalous mineralization (known at the 
time) are separated by approximately 16 km. The mineralized zones and/or showings hosted by 
members of the Bélanger Trend in 2004 principally included, from west to east: 
 
Clark Zone, a newly discovered area of weakly mineralized pyroxenite and melanocratic gabbro 
float/subcrop located about 3 km west of the Getty Zone. Various samples taken over a 120m 
strike length assayed up to 0.39% Cu, 0.32% Ni and 0.90 g/t combined Pt+Pd; 
 
Allard showing, a newly discovered showing of weakly mineralized melanocratic 
gabbro/pyroxenite, located about 750m west of the Getty Zone, grabs from which assayed up to 
0.30% Cu, 0.36% Ni and 0.67 g/t combined Pt+Pd; 
 
Getty Zone, a historically known area of mineralized pyroxenite outcrop and subcrop, exposed 
over a 325m by 15 to 50m area, various surface grabs from which assayed up to2.25% Cu, 
1.11% Ni and 1.45 g/t combined Pt+Pd; 
 
Getty East showing, a mineralized melanocratic gabbro located about 200m east of the eastern 
extremity of the main Getty zone, one grab from which assayed 0.19% Cu, 0.12%Ni and 0.55 g/t 
combined Pt+Pd; 
 
Midway Getty-Sylvie Zone, a newly discovered showing of weakly mineralized gabbro 
pyroxenite subcrop, various samples from which assayed up to 1.14% Cu, 0.24% Ni and1.40 g/t 
combined Pt+Pd; 
 
Sylvie Zone, a newly discovered zone of mineralized pyroxenite subcrop exposed over150m by 
20 to 40m, located about one kilometer east of the Getty zone. Grabs from the Sylvie Zone 
assayed up to 0.41% Cu, 0.28% Ni and 1.45 g/t combined Pt+Pd. A small showing 330m NNW 
of the Sylvie Zone (Sylvie North showing) yielded 0.31% Cu, 0.23%Ni and 0.83 g/t combined 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 19 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No.188 
 

Pt+Pd, and another 210m northeast of the main Sylvie zone(Sylvie East showing) assayed 0.18% 
Cu with 0.8 g/t combined Pt+Pd.; 
 
Midway Sylvie-Pillow Lake showing, a small subcropping exposure of mineralized gabbro 
located about 4.5 km east of the Sylvie Zone, a single grab from which assayed 0.31% Cu, 
0.08% Ni and 0.77 g/t combined Pt+Pd; 
 
Pillow Lake and Pillow Lake East zone, a series of small showings of mineralized ultramafic 
rock falling into two loose clusters separated by about 500m, some of which are newly 
discovered and at least one of which may correspond to the historic Pillow Lake showing. Grabs 
from this zone assayed up to 0.53% Cu, 0.50% Ni and 2.04 g/t combined Pt+Pd. 
 
Highlights from the drill program include results from the Getty Zone, where 16 holes were 
drilled in a series of fences spaced 50m apart, testing a 150m strike length of the core of the 
exposed surface mineralization. Collectively the holes define a body of mineralized pyroxenite 
within an embayment or trough-like structure near the base of a discordant mafic-ultramafic 
complex. Twelve holes intersected significant near-surface sulphide mineralization including 
disseminated to net textured sulphide, semi-massive and massive sulphide (pyrrhotite-
pentlandite-chalcopyrite), while three holes undercut the mineralized zone. The true thickness of 
the massive sulphide lenses intersected in the various holes is as yet unknown, and the 
mineralized zone remains open to both the east and west. 
 
Drill testing of the newly discovered Sylvie Zone involved eight holes, seven of which 
intersected significant sulphide mineralization, mostly as disseminated to incipient net-textured 
pyrrhotite hosted by pyroxenite. The most significant intersections from the 2004 drilling are 
presented in Tables 5-6 and 5-7 below.

5.4.2 2004 SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
The sampling methods employed by Goldbrook were the same as those employed by Novawest 
as detailed in Section 5.3.3 above. 
 
Analytical sample preparation (drying, crushing, splitting and pulverizing) and base metal 
analyses were done by ALS Chemex Laboratories of Val-d'Or, Quebec. PGE assays were 
completed at ALS Chemex in Vancouver, British Columbia. Base metals were analyzed by 
atomic absorption spectroscopy, whereas Pt, Pd and Au were assayed by fire assay (30 g). 
 
5.6 2005 EXPLORATION COMPLETED BY AAEC/GOLDBROOK JV 
 
In 2005, Anglo American Exploration (Canada) Ltd. ("AAEC") entered into an Option and JV 
agreement with Goldbrook to explore the Belanger and Nuvilik Properties. AAEC was the 
operator. 
 
During the exploration program conducted between June and September 2005, AAEC completed 
geological mapping & prospecting, surface geochemical surveys, ground geophysical surveys 
and diamond drilling (including borehole electromagnetic surveys) on the Belanger and Nuvilik 
Properties. 
 
Geological mapping and prospecting programs were largely focused in the eastern portion of the 
Belanger Property where outcrop and previously known surface Ni-sulphide mineralization were 
most abundant.  Two new zones of surface Ni-Cu-PGE mineralization (the Timtu and PAD-1 
Zones)were discovered on the Belanger property during the summer. 
 
The rest of the properties were mapped at various scales depending on objectives and by the end 
of the summer program a total of 298 rock samples were collected and analyzed for major and 
trace elements, and 134 rock samples were sent for assay determinations. 
 
A total of 3,707 till, moss matt and organic soil samples were collected from the Belanger and 
Nuvilik Properties and analyzed for major and trace elements. 
 
From July to September 2005, a total of 388.1 line-km of ground magnetic surveys and 
117.8 line-km of horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM) surveys were completed on the two

properties and all 18 drill holes were probed with bore-hole pulse electromagnetic surveys 
(BHPEM) from multiple loop configurations. 
  
By the end of the program, a total of 18 holes were drilled on the Belanger Property for a total of 
2,699 metres.  Diamond drilling was successful in confirming two new surface nickel-copper-
PGE mineralized zones at the Timtu and PAD-1 targets as well as extending the historically 
known mineralized region at Getty Zone by an additional 100m to the west of previous drilling.  
No diamond drilling was completed on the Nuvilik Property in 2005. 
 
5.6.1 SOIL, TILL AND MOSS MAT SURVEY RESULTS 
 
The surveys completed on the Belanger Property consisted of 85 soil samples over five line km 
and 2,144 till samples over 110 line km. A total of 48 moss-mat and 1,430 till samples were 
collected on the Nuvilik Property.  Till surveys on the Nuvilik Property covered approximately 
89 line km. All sample collection and data interpretation were completed by AAEC geochemists 
and summer students. 
 
Additional till sampling, analyses and interpretation were recommended at the following target 
areas: the entire Getty Trend including from Allard & Getty-Sylvie to Pad-1, Gunga, Echo, 
Hennessey, Kingsley and Belafonte.  For the 2006 field season, a soil survey for the western 
portion of the Belanger Property was proposed, as the soil coverage is better developed in the 
western area and could be used to assess the potential for buried/covered mineralized zones. 
 
5.6.2 GROUND AND BOREHOLE GEOPHYSICS RESULTS 
 
Ground geophysical surveys, consisting of Horizontal-Loop EM (HLEM) and ground magnetic 
surveys, were completed on both the Nuvilik and Belanger Properties between July and 
September of 2005.  The HLEM data were collected along established picketed grids whereas 
the magnetic data were collected in a "walking mode" and did not require grids.  In total, 117.8 
line km of HLEM were completed (100m and 200m coil separation) over select targets and 
388.1 line km of walking magnetic data were collected utilizing a Cesium vapour censor 
equipped with a GPS receiver.   In addition, all eighteen 2005 drill holes were surveyed with a 
Crone Geophysics time-domain electromagnetic borehole instrument; some holes from multiple 
surface loop configurations.  All geophysical data were acquired by contractors and 
interpretation was largely completed on-site by AAEC staff and contractors.   
 
No results were discussed in the 2005 exploration report. 
 
5.6.3 2005 DIAMOND DRILL PROGRAM 
 
AAEC contracted Rouyn-Noranda, Québec-based drilling company Bradley Nuvumiut for the 
summer 2005 drilling program. All 2005 drilling was completed on the Belanger Property and 
no drilling was done on the Nuvilik Property.  The drilling program commenced on July 17, 
2005 and was completed on September 17, 2005. In total, 18 holes for a combined length of 
2,699 metres were drilled during the summer program. 
 
Drilling on the Belanger Property was carried out on the Getty, Clark, Dormé, Pad-1, R-2, 
Timtu, Echo and Jabba targets. 
 
The best results from the 2005 drill program are presented in Table 5-8 below.

Table 5-8: 2005 Significant Drill Results 
 

 
 
5.6.4 2005 SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
All drill core was logged, sampled, and cut by diamond saw on site at the Belanger Camp with 
all drill core stored on site.  Half samples of core were sent for crushing and sample preparation 
to ALS Chemex (Val-d'Or, QC) then to either ALS Chemex (Vancouver, B.C.) for assay or to 
Acme Analytical Labs (Vancouver, B.C.) for whole rock major and trace element analysis.  
Including samples collected from a select number of Goldbrook 2004 drill holes (n= 21), a total 
of 940 separate geochemical analyses were performed on 897 samples in addition to the analyses 
of 97 duplicates, 73 standards and 58 procedural blanks.  Samples were assayed using analytical 
methods ICP 23 for platinum group metals and ICP 81 for base metals.  Internationally 
recognized CANMET standards used for quality control were WMS-1, and WMG-1 as well as 
Ore Research and Pty standards OREAS-13P and OREAS-14P.  Whole rock oxide and trace 
element analyses were done using the 4Ni multi-element analytical package (ACME Analytical 
Laboratories Ltd.).  Representative whole rock standards MKO (Mount Keith), OREAS-24P or 
altered andesite were inserted by AAEC staff where appropriate based on the estimated MgO 
content of samples in the batch.   
 
Drill site environmental audits were typically conducted during drilling and again upon 
completion of drilling and site remediation.  After completion of each borehole, drill equipment 
and garbage were removed from the site and a labeled wooden picket was placed at the collar 
location.  All sites were photographed after remediation to show that they had been left in a 
natural state.   
 
Drill logs were entered in Gemslogger (or GEMS), a stand alone add-on logging program 
provided by GEMCOM.  Magnetic susceptibility measurements were taken systematically every 
3 m with an Exploranium Kappameter KT-9.   
 
5.6.5 GEOLOGICAL MAPPING AND PROSPECTING PROGRAM 
 
AAEC completed an extensive mapping and prospecting program during the 2005 field season. 
The mapping program commenced on July 8, 2005 and was completed on September 7, 2005, 
and was undertaken to take advantage of the good outcrop exposure throughout much of the 
eastern part of the Belanger and Nuvilik Properties.   
 
The mapping and prospecting program involved both east-west traverses along linear magnetic 
highs and north-south traverses across the Cape Smith Belt stratigraphy.  Additional detailed 
mapping and prospecting was completed over areas of significant surface sulphide 
mineralization discovered during the regional traverses.

Rock samples from outcrop and subcrop within the Belanger and Nuvilik Properties were 
collected for major and trace element analysis and assays.  Rock and site descriptions were 
completed in the field and were transferred to a digital database on a daily basis. Weathered or 
oxidized rinds were removed during sample collection.  The presence of pervasively weathered 
samples was noted.  A representative hand specimen for each rock sample was also collected at 
each sample location and stored at camp for future reference.  As with the drill core samples, 
surface rock samples were crushed and prepared at ALS Chemex (Val-d'Or, QC) and then were 
either shipped to ALS Chemex (Vancouver, B.C.) for assay or to Acme Analytical Labs 
(Vancouver, B.C.) for whole rock lithogeochemical analysis.  A total of 298 samples (Belanger: 
206 samples; Nuvilik: 92 samples) were collected and analyzed for major and trace elements, 
and 134 samples were assayed (Belanger: 86 samples and Nuvilik: 48 samples).   
 
5.7 2006 EXPLORATION COMPLETED BY AAEC/GOLDBROOK JV 
 
During the summer 2006 exploration program conducted between June and September 2006, 
AAEC completed geological mapping & prospecting, surface geochemical surveys, ground 
geophysical surveys and diamond drilling (including borehole electromagnetic surveys) on the 
Belanger and Nuvilik Properties.   
 
Geological mapping and prospecting programs were largely focused on the Nuvilik Property as 
well as the eastern portion of the Belanger Property, where activities in 2005 indicated outcrop 
and surface Ni-sulphide mineralization are most abundant. 
 
The rest of the properties were mapped at various scales depending on objectives and by the end 
of the summer program a total of 58 rock samples were collected and analyzed for major and 
trace element abundances, and 11 rock samples were sent for assay. 
 
A total of 1,925 till and 1,210 organic soil samples were collected from the Belanger and Nuvilik 
Properties and analyzed for major and trace elements to detect surface geochemical anomalies in 
area of extensive cover. 
 
From June to September 2006, a total of 350.7 line-km of ground magnetic surveys and 62.9 
line-km of horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM) surveys were completed on the two 
properties and 22 drill holes were probed with bore-hole pulse electromagnetic surveys 
(BHPEM) from multiple loop configurations. 
 
By the end of the program, a total of 21 diamond drill holes were drilled on the Belanger 
Property and four holes were drilled on the Nuvilik Property for a combined total of 4,741 
meters in 25 holes. On the Belanger Property, diamond drilling concentrated on the nickel-
copper-PGE mineralized zones at the Getty and PAD-1 targets with additional drilling at Sylvie, 
Midway, Hill, Jabba, and Timtu. 
 
The historically known mineralization at the Getty Zone was extended by an additional 50 m to 
the west of previous (2005) drilling. Diamond drilling on the Nuvilik Property consisted of four 
holes along the Mandrake Trend, which is interpreted to be the boundary between the 
Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups ("Raglan Horizon"). 
 
The recommendation for the 2007 exploration program was to apply systematic drilling to the 
Getty trend of mineralized ultramafic rocks. The new geologic map produced in 2006 clearly 
showed that mineralization is confined to marginal pyroxenite within a 600 m long footwall

embayment. Mineralization appears to plunge shallowly to the west, where it was intersected by 
2006 drilling (e.g. BEL06-023 and 024). Several potential drill targets, mainly in the western 
(down-plunge) part of the Getty target area, were identified by down-hole EM surveys (BHEM) 
from 2006 drilling. 
 
5.7.1 2006 DIAMOND DRILL PROGRAM 
 
A total of 4,741 m of BQ core was retrieved from 25 diamond drill holes on the Nuvilik and 
Belanger Properties during the 2006 drill program. The Belanger Property included six holes at 
PAD-1, seven holes at Getty, three holes at Hill, two holes at Timtu, and a single hole at each of 
the Midway, Jabba and Sylvie target areas. Drilling of the Nuvilik Property comprised four holes 
in the Mandrake target area in the southern part of the Property. All holes were between 122 m 
and 266 m in length. Approximately four to 10 m of casing through glacio-fluvial overburden 
was required at each site. AAEC contracted Eastern Geophysics of West Pubnico, Nova Scotia 
to complete borehole electromagnetic pulse surveys down selected holes. Table 5-9 lists the 
most significant results from this drill program. 
 
Table 5-9: Significant Drill Results from 2006 AAEC JV Program 
 

 
 
5.7.2 2006 SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
All BQ drill core was logged, sampled and stored on site at the Belanger Camp. Drill core was 
cut in half lengthwise by diamond saw for sampling. One half was returned to the core box on 
site and one half was sent for crushing and sample preparation at ALS Chemex lab in Val-D'Or, 
QC. Assay samples were sent to ALS Chemex lab (Vancouver, B.C.) and whole rock (major and 
trace element) samples were sent to Acme Analytical Laboratories Ltd. (Vancouver, B.C.). 
 
A total of 657 core sample geochemical analyses were done and an additional 43 duplicates, 69 
standards and 65 procedural blanks were submitted for QA/QC purposes. Samples were assayed 
using the ALS Chemex ICP-23 analytical method for platinum group metals and ICP-81 for base 
metals. 
 
Internationally recognized CANMET standards WMS-1 and WMG-1, as well as Ore Research 
and Pty standards OREAS-13P and OREAS-14P were used for monitoring accuracy at the lab. 
Whole rock major element oxide and trace element analyses were done using the 4Ni multi-
element analytical package (AALITHO) at ACME Analytical Laboratories Ltd. Representative

whole rock standards Mount Keith Ore, OREAS-24P or altered andesite were inserted by AAEC 
staff where appropriate based on the estimated MgO content of samples in the batch.  
 
In total, 299 whole rock samples from drill core were analyzed for major and trace element 
abundances (258 from the Belanger Property and 41 from the Nuvilik Property), and 358 
samples were assayed (276 from Belanger and 82 from Nuvilik).  
 
Drill site environmental audits were conducted throughout drilling and after completion of 
drilling and site remediation. After completion of each drill hole, equipment and waste were 
carefully removed from the site and a labelled wooden picket was placed at the collar location. 
All sites were photographed prior to drilling and after remediation to show that they had been 
left in a near-natural state. 
 
5.8 2006 EXPLORATION PROGRAM COMPLETED BY GOLDBROOK 
 
During the summer of July to September 2006, Goldbrook completed airborne geophysical 
surveys, geological mapping and mineral prospecting, ground geophysical surveys, geological 
mapping, surface geochemical surveys, and diamond drilling programs on the Wakeham, 
Masuparia, Ungava, Belanger and Nuvilik Properties.  
 
An AeroTEM II airborne electromagnetic survey was flown by AeroQuest Ltd. (Milton, 
Ontario) from July 12 to August 25, 2006. The survey was flown with a line spacing of 100 
metres to 200 metres for a total of 9402.9 line-km over the five properties. 
 
The geological mapping and mineral prospecting program covered the length and breadth of all 
the property holdings. Approximately 741 field stations were visited and fifteen new showings 
of surface Ni-Cu-PGE sulphide mineralization were discovered. Previously discovered mineral 
showings were extended for up to one km or more in outcrop and subcrop. By the end of the 
summer program a total of 510 surface rock samples were collected and submitted for assay 
analysis at a commercial laboratory. In addition, 12 surface rock samples and 16 diamond drill 
core samples were submitted to a research quality lab at McGill University for major and trace 
element abundances. 
 
From July to September 2006, a total of 488.4 line-km of ground magnetic surveys, 191.3 line-
km of horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLEM) surveys, and 2.2 line-km of fixed-loop 
electromagnetic surveys were completed on four of the properties. Geological mapping was 
carried out in areas of good outcrop and geophysical anomalies on the Wakeham and Nuvilik 
Properties. 
 
A total of 1,498 till and organic soil samples were collected from the Wakeham, Ungava, 
Masuparia and Nuvilik Properties and assayed at a commercial laboratory. 
 
Abundant geochemical anomalies were identified in the data sets for follow-up evaluation in 
2007. 
 
By the end of the 2006 exploration program, 2,375 metres of drilling was completed in 16 holes. 
Eight holes were drilled on the Wakeham Property for a total of 1,380 metres. Diamond drilling 
was successful in extending known mineralization at the Nancy showing and the newly 
discovered Emperor showing at depth. Six holes were drilled for 803 metres on the Ungava 
Property. Diamond drilling at the Margarita showing was successful in intersecting weakly 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 26 of 123

mineralized gabbro and favourable ultramafic rocks at depth. Two holes drilled on the 
Masuparia Property for a total of 193 metres intersected sulphidic sedimentary rocks and barren 
gabbro and basalt. Approximately 117 samples were submitted for assay at a commercial lab. 
 
Twelve of the sixteen holes were probed with bore-hole pulse electromagnetic surveys 
(BHPEM) from single loop configurations. 
 
Recommendations for the 2007 exploration program included follow-up deep 
penetratingairborne and ground geophysical surveys, geological mapping, and geochemical 
assay analyses of surface rock and drill core samples and diamond drilling of geophysical and 
geochemical anomalies on the Wakeham, Ungava, Masuparia and Nuvilik Properties.  
 
5.8.1 2006 DIAMOND DRILL PROGRAM RESULTS 
 
Goldbrook contracted Bradley Numuviut, based in Rouyn-Noranda (Quebec), for the 2006 
drilling program. The drilling program commenced on August 11, 2006 and finished September 
25, 2006.  
 
Sixteen holes were drilled for a total of 2,376 metres: eight holes for 1,380 metres were drilled 
on the Wakeham Property, six holes for 803 metres on the Ungava Property, and two holes for 
193 metres on the Masuparia Property.  
 
Drilling on the Wakeham Property was carried out on the Nancy and Emperor-Surtsey targets. 
All drilling on the Ungava Property was carried out on the Margarita target, whereas that on the 
Masuparia Property was done on the Big Bertha target. 
 
The most significant results from the 2006 Goldbrook drilling are presented in Table 5-10 below. 
 
Table 5-10: Significant Drill Results from 2006 Goldbrook Program 
 

 
 
5.8.2 2006 SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
Core logging, sample selection, sawing and packaging were the same as in previous years. 
 
All samples were crushed and prepared at the ALS Chemex laboratory in Val-d'Or (QC) and 
shipped to ALS Chemex, Vancouver for analysis. Duplicate samples and blanks were inserted 
approximately one every 20 samples by GBK in order that lab precision and accuracy could be 
monitored. Four different internationally recognized reference standards were utilized in the 
2006 program: (1) OREAS 14P (massive sulphide); (2) OREAS 70P (Mt Keith ore); (3) WMG-1 
(mineralized gabbro); and (4) OREAS 45P (ferruginous soil). In total, 156 reference materials, 
sample duplicates and blanks were analyzed in addition to those required by ALS Chemex 
internal analytical protocols.

6.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
6.1 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 
The Cape Smith Belt in which all of the deposits of the Raglan Project lie, is an interpreted 
foreland thrust-fold belt that constitutes the north-eastern extension of the Trans-Hudson Orogen, 
an early Proterozoic collision zone, which separates the Archean Superior Province from the 
Proterozoic Churchill Province (Hynes and Francis, 1982; Hoffman 1990). The Trans-Hudson 
Orogen includes the Thompson Nickel Belt of Manitoba and the New Quebec Orogen (Labrador 
Trough) on opposite sides of the Superior Province. The Cape Smith (Ungava) Belt extends for 
375 kilometres in an east-west direction across the Ungava Peninsula of Nunavik. The 
greenschist facies foreland portion of the belt is divided into three structurally superimposed 
Proterozoic units, from south to north and oldest to youngest: Lamarche, Povungnituk and 
Chukotat Groups (Lamothe, 1994). The amphibolite grade hinterland is divided into four 
structurally superimposed Proterozoic units from south to north; Sparton, Parent, Perreault, and 
Watts Groups (Lamothe, 1994; St-Onge et al., 1992). 
 
The tectono-stratigraphic elements of the belt record a rifting event 2.0-1.9 billion years (Ga) 
ago, with accumulation of sedimentary and volcanic units (Povungnituk and Chukotat Groups) 
on a north-facing continental margin. Subsequent closing of the rift during the Hudsonian 
Orogeny (ca 1.8 Ga), resulted in a complex interaction of thrusting, penetrative shearing, 
metamorphism and imbrication of the foreland thrust belt with the tectono-stratigraphic units of 
the hinterland (Lamothe, 1994; Lucas and St.-Onge 1989; St-Onge and Lucas, 1990; St-Onge et 
al., 1992). After detailed geological mapping on the Expo Ungava Property in recent years, 
Mungall (2004) has queried the existence of or structural necessity for the various thrust faults 
postulated by the earlier workers. 
 
The Property is located within the central portion of the assemblage, near the suture separating 
the foreland from the hinterland domains. The North Domain is dominated by the mostly 
volcanic Watts Group, which has been interpreted as an Island-Arc accretionary complex. The 
South Domain includes the Lamarche, Povungnituk, and Chukotat Groups, which are 
collectively interpreted as an extensional sequence consisting mainly of basalts, sediments and 
ultramafic rocks grading into oceanic crust towards the north. The boundary between the North 
and South domains is marked by the regional scale Bergeron Fault, considered to be a 
subduction zone (Bergeron, 1957; Bergeron, 1959; Lamothe et al., 1983; Lamothe, 1986). The 
basin is interpreted to record a protracted regime of extension followed by sea-floor spreading 
and subsequent convergent tectonics marked by folding and thrusting. 
 
6.2 LOCAL GEOLOGY 
 
The geology of all six deposits for which there are currently resource estimates is  essentially the 
same, though the morphology of each can be very different. The portions of the deposits within 
the ultramafic complexes in which the deposits lie can be horizontal to essentially vertical, and 
the proportions of massive to net-textured to disseminated sulphides can vary greatly. The 
geology of each deposit is detailed in individual sub-sections, accompanied by cross sections 
typical of each.

6.2.1 MYSTERY DEPOSIT GEOLOGY 
 
The following six sub-sections, which describe the deposit geology in detail, rely heavily on the 
internal report co-authored by Pardy, J., Wells, K., Carter, G., Liard, M., Peat, C., Wan, Z., 
Ulansky, S., Bligh, J., and Nourpour, M., supplied to the author by Goldbrook. The author 
considers the deposit descriptions to be clear, concise and very descriptive and has chosen to use 
them almost verbatim from the internal reports. 
 
The geology of the Mystery area (Figure 6.3) is based on surface geological mapping by Sheila 
Jonnes in summer 2008 at a scale of 1:2,000 and on the projection to surface of the sectional data 
from the drilling program. 
 
Three main rock units were identified in the area: a volcanic (extrusive) unit, an intrusive unit 
and a metasedimentary unit. The extrusive unit is an aphanitic, silicified basalt unit (possibly 
metabasalt) extending northeast-southwest along the length of the Little Puvirnituq River 
marking the southern boundary of the map (Figure 6.3). The intrusive unit (the Mystery 
ultramafic unit) consists of a suite of ultramafic rocks including peridotite, minor dunite, 
pyroxenite, gabbro, and marginal gabbro. The metasedimentary unit includes the aphanitic 
silicified pelite and graphitic argillite.  
 
The Mystery Deposit extends to surface, but is mostly covered by a thick blanket of organics in a 
local topographic low adjacent to the hill located immediately to the south of the Main Zone. The 
deposit consists of the Mystery Main Zone and the Mystery North Zone. Both zones occur within 
the Mystery ultramafic unit which exists within a steeply south dipping metasedimentary unit 
interpreted to be a slightly overturned graphitic pelite synform. The footwall of the Mystery 
ultramafic hosts the Main Zone, averaging about 30m true width. The Mystery North Zone 
ranging in width from 0.5 to eight metres is located within the hanging wall of the Mystery 
ultramafic and is about 75 metres north of the Mystery Main Zone mineralization. 
 
The Mystery Main Zone has a currently defined strike length of 150 metres WNW to SSE and a 
depth of 425 metres. It is still open to the east based on its apparent steep eastern plunge. 
Mineralization in the Mystery Main Zone ranges from finely disseminated pyrrhotite up section 
and away from the footwall sediment-Mystery ultramafic contact to net textured and massive 
pyrrhotite mineralization just above or at the footwall sediment-Mystery ultramafic contact. 
Nickel-bearing pentlandite occurs in varying amounts with pyrrhotite. 
 
On section 490775E in the western part of the deposit, the Main Zone plunges moderately 
(approximately 50 degrees) to the east-southeast, and on section490825E (Figure 6.4) the deposit 
shifts further south and plunges steeply (approximately 80 degrees) to the southeast. The dip of 
the Main Zone varies significantly from the west to the east: the deposit steepens from 
approximately 65 degrees on section 490775E to near vertical (88 to 90degrees) on section 
490875E (Figure 6.5). 
 
The Mystery North Zone was defined by the 2009 drilling as a high-grade Ni-Cu zone of 
approximately0.5 to eight metres true width with a vertical depth in excess of 170 metres. The 
North Zone consists of massive sulphide veins within a weakly mineralized peridotite and it is 
closely associated with the peridotite-marginal gabbro contact. The North Zone has yet to be 
fully tested. 
 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 31 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

The Mystery North Zone is mainly a vertical dipping body that varies about its axis dips to the 
north on section 490825E (Figure 6.4), and then dips south from section 490850 through to 
section490875. 
 
Alternate descriptions and interpretations have been made: 1) the Main and North Zones may 
connect at depth as one mineralized zone on both limbs of the synform interpreted from drillhole 
data, 2) the Main and North Zones are separate, but proximal mineralized bodies (with their own 
footwall and hangingwall or with the Main Zone occurring in the footwall of the Mystery 
ultramafic and the North Zone occurring in the hangingwall of the ultramafic), and 3) the North 
Zone represents remobilized mineralization and the associated marginal gabbro is an alteration of 
ultramafic rock.

6.2.2 TIMTU DEPOSIT GEOLOGY 
 
Timtu is a magmatic sulphide, Ni-Cu-Co-PGE deposit that is hosted by differentiated ultramafic 
sills of the Povungnituk Group. The geology described is based on regional scale mapping (J. 
Logan, 2009),geophysics where outcrop is poor, and cross-sectional interpretation of drilling on 
a deposit scale (see Figure 6.6). 
 
The ultramafic sill that is host to the Timtu Deposit is interpreted to extend over four km in strike 
on a regional scale, but extends locally ~230 m east-west at the deposit scale. 
 
Outcrop is poor at surface, but mineralized gossanous Ni-bearing peridotite subcrop and outcrop 
are present over an area of ~9m2.  Sparse outcrop and subcrop at surface show an ultramafic 
body that is surrounded by sediments, with a gabbro body located to the south.  
 
Ultramafic rocks intersected at the Timtu Deposit consist mainly of peridotite, grading from an 
intact fine-grained peridotite at the top of the deposit to an intensely altered, medium-grained 
olivine pyroxenite to pyroxenite at the basal contact. In addition, the rocks become increasingly 
altered (giving a pseudo-brecciated appearance) and oikocrystic closer to the basal contact. 
Argillite below the basal contact of the ultramafic rocks is veined, sheared and mineralized. A 
late gabbro intrusion seen on the west side of the deposit is interpreted to be fault controlled, 
intruding the ultramafic sill and sediments along a low-angle fault. The deposit has been strongly 
folded in a slightly overturned S-folded synform (looking west). This folding affects all 
lithologies and mineralization present, including sediment, ultramafic and mineralization. The 
ultramafic is sheared in the core of the deposit, likely related to this deformation. 
 
Ni-Cu-Co-PGE sulphide mineralization of the deposit is contained within the ultramafic rock 
units. The mineralization itself extends 200m vertically and 150m along strike, and remains open 
to the east, north, and at depth to the west. The ultramafic body is between ~25 and 75 m wide, 
with the basal mineralized zone ~5 to 20 m wide. In the west, section 507900E, the deposit dips 
steeply north, with the top of the deposit thrust east by a low angle fault along which the 
gabbroic intrusion is introduced. In the centre of the deposit (section 508015E, Figure 6.7), the 
mineralization dips steeply toward the north near the surface, and then becomes folded, dipping 
steeply to the south at the deepest known part of the deposit. On the eastern side, section 
508050E, the S-bend folding continues along strike to the eastern extent of the drilling, and the 
deposit remains open along strike and at depth. A lower copper-rich horizon is also present 
within the adjacent sediments, mimicking the shape of the intrusion. Chalcopyrite occurs as 
massive veins in argillite within three metres of the argillite –ultramafic rock contact. 
 
The main mineralized zone at Timtu consists of pyrrhotite + chalcopyrite +/- pentlandite +/- 
marcasite + accessory pyrite. The deposit contains disseminated, interstitial, net-textured and up 
to semi-massive and massive mineralization styles. The majority of the mineralization occurs 
just above the southern peridotite-argillite contact. Throughout the core, mineralization increases 
towards the base of the ultramafic sill, and is also remobilized into the sediments at the contact. 
This basal contact and the mineralization associated with it are deformed and folded. Massive 
sulphide is present in the deposit as sulphide veins as well as magmatic sulphide intervals. 
Mineralization is generally low grade at the upper contact and increasingly becomes more 
interstitial and blebby toward the base. The clear vertical mineralization differentiation or 
settling observed at the base of the sequence does suggest that the isoclinally folded package was 
rather flat lying and had not yet been overturned at the time of the ultramafic emplacement. The 
true-width of the mineralization at the Timtu Deposit varies, but is generally five to 20m wide.

6.2.3 GETTY DEPOSIT GEOLOGY 
 
The Getty Deposit is located along the northern horizon of the South Trend, approximately nine 
km SW of the Timtu Deposit and 9.2 km E of the Mystery Deposit. Coordinates of the Getty 
area center are 499965 E, 6806825 N, UTM NAD83, Zone 18. 
 
Getty is a distinctive, discrete mafic–ultramafic intrusive body that occupies the subvertical 
south contact zone of the Getty-Sylvie Intrusive, ("GSI"); contact relations show that Getty is 
intrusive into the pre-existing contact, (Figure 6.8). 
 
Getty has a 'spotted gabbro' footwall lithology, due to the local intrusive rocks preferentially 
following the much more permeable, mechanically and thermally unstable metasedimentary 
horizons. Getty is unique in occupying a relatively isotropic, indurated subvolcanic host rock. 
 
The limits of the known contiguous deposit are reasonably well defined. Dimensions are 
~400mlong (E-W) from ~ 499700 E to 500120 E, five to 35 m thick centred on 6806820 N and 
20 to 80 m in the vertical direction (though narrow offshoots continue to >200 m depth). The 
deposit is cut off at the west end by an oblique fault, at the upper surface and east end by the 
erosional surface, and pinches out at depth. 
 
The Getty Deposit plunges shallowly (12°to 20°) west, leaving most of its length exposed to 
surface, causing a350 m long gossan. The 475 m of deformation - displacement at the west end 
occurs entirely within a ~100 m thick horizon of pelitic metasediment, along the locally east-
northeast strike of this unit. The GSI and the Getty Deposit, which previously cut the 
sedimentary strata, have been faulted off to the west-southwest to become the Allard area. 
 
From its western limit at 499700 E to ~ 499750, (Figure 6.9), the various intrusive phases of 
Getty bifurcate down dip into two subvertical 'dikes' which have been drilled (albeit over very 
narrow widths) to over 200 m deep, and a separate but clearly related mineralized unit within the 
upper contact metasediment. From 35 to 80 m depth the zone is 30-40 m thick and contains some 
massive veins. 
 
From 499800E through 499880 E, the apophyses disappear; the zone remains 35 m thick but 
much weaker, lacking much of the massive sulphides.  
 
The deposit strengthens dramatically moving east of 499900 E, with the proportion of massive 
sulphide increasing in the thickest part of the zone until 500025 E, (Figure 6.10), where the zone 
begins to surface and loses some of its upper part to erosion. In this interval, the main 
mineralized zone is 35 m thick by 50 m in the vertical direction. 
 
East of 500025 E, the main bulk of the mineralized zone grows progressively shallower and 
loses depth extent. Effective drilling ends at 500075, but the surface gossan and magnetic 
response continue to ~500140 E. This extension is expected to be very shallow.

6.2.4 BRAVO DEPOSIT GEOLOGY 
 
The Bravo Deposit (also referred to as Bravo 4 or B4) is located at the south-west corner of the 
Bravo ultramafic complex, which itself lays along the northern strand of the Raglan South Trend. 
It is about 11.5km ENE of the Timtu Deposit and 24km W of Jien Canada Mining's Ivakkak 
Deposit. Coordinates of the Bravo area center are 519520E, 6813800N (all coordinates are 
datum UTM NAD83 Z18N), Figure 6.11. 
 
Bravo is a tabular, sub-vertically dipping magmatic segregation deposit, carrying a significant 
component of supergene, remobilized massive sulphide veining, which itself follows a tabular 
form proximal to the basal intrusive contact. In typical fashion, the primary, largely disseminated 
mineralization increases strongly toward the basal contact of the ultramafic unit. The 
mechanically remobilized massive sulphide veins are most abundant in the zones richest in 
primary sulphide, and tend to concentrate around an intermittent screen of highly altered, 
quartzitic country rock positioned five to 15m above the basal contact, or at the contact itself. At 
depth, massive veining migrates partially into the footwall metasediments. 
 
The deposit occupies a distinct, E-W striking, zoned mafic – ultramafic horizon of ~ 1000m by 
90 to 140m, at the inferred base of the much larger Bravo complex. This unit is clearly separate 
from the main bulk of Bravo to the north on ground magnetics; whether it is a discrete, 
subsidiary intrusive or the south limb of a synform has yet to be determined. 
 
The basal contact dips near vertically until ~100m depth, the dip then abruptly alters to a shallow 
30°N; sparse drilling below this level does not allow interpretation. The ultramafic horizon 
which hosts Bravo is also subtly distinct in outcrop from the overlying strata, having a redder 
and smoother weathering surface, a more prominent gabbro margin on the hanging wall, and 
stronger jointing. Otherwise the only obvious lithological difference is the presence of sulphide 
throughout. 
 
The limits of the known contiguous deposit are at present only partially defined due to 
insufficient diamond drilling. The total strike length drilled in the Bravo area is 320m, from 
519370E to 519690E, though effective drilling is concentrated in two clusters from 519425E to 
519525E, Figure 6.12 and from 519650 to 519670E, Figure 6.13. The gap in drilling is partially 
due to a weakening of the surface showing in that area, as the drilled sections immediately 
bracketing the gap in drilling are as strongly mineralized as any part of the deposit. Bravo is 
relatively consistent to ~100 m depth, where it appears to weaken substantially at the dip change 
in the basal contact, with a decrease in widths of primary mineralization, and as the massive 
veins continue, much narrower and less abundant, vertically down into the footwall. Isolated, 
narrow massive veins occur in several holes below 150 m depth, and in the deepest hole (NW03-
13) a 3.15 m MS – wallrock breccia vein was intersected at ~200 m vertical depth. 
 
The thickness of the main part of the disseminated zone (assaying over 0.25% Ni) varies from 
two metres to a maximum of ~21m, generally decreasing downward, and averaging five to eight 
metres overall. Massive veining makes up 10% to 40% of the total thickness of the zone, being 
more abundant within wider intervals of stronger primary sulphide mineralization. 
 
Bravo is open to the east and west. The surface showing continues ~120 m to the west of the 
present drilling, with strong assays, after which it weakens and disappears. To the east, the Bravo 
horizon terminates within 75 m of the last effectively drilled section.

6.2.5 PAD DEPOSIT GEOLOGY 
 
The Pad Deposit is located on the eastern part of the southern horizon of the South Trend. Pad is 
located approximately 11 km east of Sylvie, at coordinates 511650 E and 6809950 N UTM 
NAD83 Zone 18, see Figure 6.14. 
 
The deposit is hosted by an elongate, en echelon ultramafic body. The west end of Pad appears 
as a narrow line of mineralized pyroxenite in contact with basalt to the southwest. The ultramafic 
body is immediately north of the main mass of the continuous Getty-Sylvie horizon intrusion.  
 
The Pad mineralized body is sub-vertical and generally plunges towardthe west at ~20 degrees.  
It has an E-W strike length of 150 m, a width ~40 m and depth of about 160 m from surface.  
 
Mineralization typically occurs within the ultramafic near the contact between the ultramafic and 
marginal gabbro or sediment. Throughout the core, mineralization increases toward the base of 
the ultramafic unit. At depth, remobilized massive sulphide veins also occur within the gabbro 
unit near the contact (e.g PDR09-002).  
 
Mineralization assemblages usually consist of pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite. 
 
The mineralized body generally includes net textured and massive zones located at the bottom of 
a larger disseminated zone. This is typical in the west of the drilling area. In the middle of the 
drilling area, the mineralized body bifurcates into a large upper zone and a small lower zone, 
Section 511660E, Figure 6.15. Both zones have disseminated halos surrounding a net 
textured/massive zone. Toward the east, the upper and lower zones join and it appears that the 
upper part of the disseminated zone was eroded, Section 511685, Figure 6.16. The net 
textured/massive zone in the east is sitting at a shallower depth and is wider than it is in the west.

6.2.6 SYLVIE DEPOSIT GEOLOGY 
 
The Sylvie Deposit is located along the northern horizon of the South Trend, approximately eight 
km WSW of the Timtu Deposit and 10.5 km E of the Mystery Deposit. Coordinates of the Sylvie 
Deposit center are 501200E, 6807050N, Figure 6.17. 
 
Sylvie is a shallowly W-plunging, multipartite complex of discrete, sulphide-mineralized, mafic 
– ultramafic intrusive units which occupy a local pinch-out of the GSI; contact relations show 
that Sylvie is the later unit.  
 
On the deposit scale, Sylvie consists of a discontinuous, upper, gabbro-hosted, disseminated 
zone and a lower, variably net-textured zone within a dip-discordant, highly altered ultramafic 
unit which appears to constitute a 'floor' to the Sylvie intrusive system. The lower zone features 
abundant remobilized sulphide forming clusters of anastomosing, massive veins within the 
original mineralized unit. The upper and lower zones are in partial auto-intrusive contact, or 
locally are separated by a large, irregular block of mixed basaltic and gabbroic country rock. 
 
The limits of the known contiguous deposit are at present partially defined by drilling along 
strike and reasonably well-defined in the depth direction. Dimensions are ~200 m long (E-W) 
from 501100E, Figure 6.18 to 501300E,15 to 30 m thick overall and 40 m to 140 m deep overall 
(including upper and lower zones). The main massive sulphide zone is ten metres thick within a 
30 m lower zone and reaches a measurement of 75m+ in the dip direction; it is most prominent 
on sections 501175E and 501200E. 
 
Both upper and lower zones are open down plunge at the W end, while the upper surface and E 
end are cut up plunge by the erosional surface. There appears to be a floor to the Sylvie intrusive 
system at depth which varies from ~55 m deep at the east end to 100 m in the strongest central 
area, to 140 m at the western limit of drilling (though narrow dikes are found to ~180 m depth). 
 
Sylvie plunges variably 20° to 30°W (overall ~25°W). Both the upper and lower zones reach 
surface and the upper zone is exposed in a 120+m long gossan. Both zones appear to be 
thickening at the western limit of drilling, west of a weak area between 501125E and 501150E. 
 
Sylvie is highly complex, and shows several interesting lithological, genetic and morphological 
features: 
 
• The country rock of the footwall in Sylvie and the nearby Getty Deposit is exclusively 
weakly deformed 'spotted gabbro' and basalt, though generally the local intrusive rocks tend to 
preferentially follow the much more permeable, mechanically and thermally unstable 
metasedimentary horizons; 
• A distinctive, featureless, aphanitic, highly chloritized, sulphide-barren rock often (and 
only) occurs within and adjacent to clusters of massive sulphide veins. This rock type may be 
altered inclusions of basalt which aided permeability for the veining, though the absence of 
sulphide argues against this. Otherwise, it could represent portions of formerly mineralized 
ultramafic rock mechanically stripped of sulphide, which has genetic implications as a source for 
the massive sulphide; 
• The lower, richer ultramafic / sulphide zone dips much more shallowly (~35°N) than all 
other intrusive contacts and the upper disseminated zone; this orientation continues through a 
notable 45 m vertical step between sections 501250E and 501275E, Figure 6.19 (which also has 
no analogue on the hangingwall contact). When viewed in the dip plane however, the step in the 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 51 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

floor occurs between sections 501125E and 501150E, within the weakest part of the zone. Both 
en-echelon parts of the lower zone strengthen to the west, suggesting further mineralization 
down plunge. Structures which could explain the shallowness of the dip of the lower zone or its 
abrupt eastward rise are not evident on surface or in drilling; 
• Sylvie is notable for discontinuous mineralization and lithology, sometimes over a few 
metres. It is very difficult to correlate between sections, and sometimes between holes on the 
same section. Multiple minor faults of a few metres to a 20 m displacement are the likely cause; 
• There are narrow, sporadic, mineralized gabbro dikes present in the footwall country 
rocks some 40 m below the deposit, which is uncommon in other deposits; 
• No remaining potential 'feeder' or source conduit for the mineralized Sylvie ultramafic 
rocks has yet been identified. Other zones are open at depth (Mystery, B4, Timtu) or have a 
barren depth extent (Pad1); Getty has the bounding metasediment as a plausible former conduit 
locale. The magma flow must therefore have been primarily lateral in the deposit area; 
• The GSI narrows at Sylvie and the remaining space is filled by the mineralized 
material. It is unlikely that any of the relatively undeformed, homogeneous GSI has been stoped, 
however, and there is no evidence for this (barren xenoliths, missing gabbroic margin etc.). The 
local discontinuity in the GSI must have provided (or resulted from) some kind of country rock 
permeability, as seen at Pad1 (pinch out) and Getty (oblique metasedimentary horizon); 
• Though the host Sylvie-type ultramafic rock is at most weakly magnetic, the magnetic 
signature of the mineralization itself is detected by ground-based magnetometer surveys. The 
deposit is not detected by either of the modern airborne TEM surveys conducted, nor by ground 
based HLEM despite the massive sulphide. There is a possible weak, 1-station-only response on 
ground based TEM and a strong response on moving-loop 'SQUID' TEM.

7.1 MAGMATIC Ni-Cu-PGE TYPE 
 
The mineral occurrences along the South Trend as well as those of the Raglan Trend to the north 
belong to the class of magmatic sulphide deposits. The descriptions that follow are cited from the 
Geology of Canadian Mineral Deposit Types 1995, edited by Eckstrand, Sinclair and Thorpe. 
 
A broad group of deposits containing nickel-copper-platinum group elements (PGE) occur as 
sulphur segregations associated with a variety of mafic and ultramafic magmatic rocks. Among 
such deposits, two main subtypes are distinguishable. In the first, the Ni-Cu sulphide type, nickel 
and copper are economic commodities contained in sulphide-rich ores that are associated with 
differentiated mafic sills and stocks and ultramafic volcanic (komatiitic) volcanic flows and sills. 
The second type, magmatic PGE is mined principally for PGE's which are associated with 
sparsely dispersed sulphides in medium to large, typically layered mafic to ultramafic intrusions. 
 
Nickel-copper sulphide deposits are sulphide concentrations that occur in certain mafic and/or 
ultramafic intrusions or volcanic flows. Nickel is the main economic commodity; copper may be 
either a co-product or by-product, and platinum group elements (PGEs) are usual by-products. 
Other commodities recovered in some cases include gold, silver, cobalt, sulphur, selenium, and 
tellurium. These metals are associated with sulphides, which generally make up more than 10% 
of the ore. 
 
As a group, magmatic nickel-copper sulphide deposits have accounted for most of the world's 
past and current production of nickel. International reserves of magmatic sulphide nickel remain 
large, though they are exceeded by those of lateritic nickel deposits, the only other significant 
source of nickel. 
 
Most nickel sulphide deposits consist of several closely adjacent, but discrete orebodies, 
therefore the definition of a "deposit" is rather arbitrary. Individual orebodies may contain from 
a few hundred thousand to a few million tonnes of ore, and in some instances tens of millions of 
tonnes of ore. Mining grades are generally about 1 to 3% Ni, but may be higher in some small 
deposits. Noteworthy exceptions are some of the ore zones in the Talnakh camp of the Noril'sk 
area, where substantial orebodies average several per cent Ni and greater than 20% Cu. 
 
There are four subtypes of this deposit and all subtypes have some general similarities. For 
example, the host intrusions in all cases are either mafic or ultramafic in composition. In 
addition, most deposits occur as sulphide concentrations toward the base of their magmatic host 
bodies. Furthermore, all subtypes of nickel sulphide ores usually consist mainly of the simple 
sulphide assemblage pyrrhotite-pentlandite-chalcopyrite, either as massive sulphides, sulphide-
matrix breccias, or disseminations of sulphides. Nickel-copper sulphide ores of any of the 
subtypes that have undergone tectonic remobilization have been converted to similar-appearing 
sulphide-matrix breccias. The subtypes differ significantly in their geological-tectonic settings 
and in the geometric form and style of differentiation of the host magmatic bodies. They differ 
also in that the magmatic hosts in most subtypes are intrusions, but in the komatiitic subtype 
most are volcanic flows. Furthermore the ores of the various subtypes show some differences in 
composition, most noticeably in their Ni:Cu ratios.  
 
Although Eckstrand (1996) groups the Raglan Trend deposits with those related to komatiitic 
flows and related intrusions, considerable evidence suggests that the deposits located along the 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 56 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

South Trend are related to continental or continental margin intrusive suites. The fact that these 
deposits have nickel/copper ratios of approximately 0.8:1 and are universally endowed in PGE 
also contrasts with the standard komatiitic model.

8.0 MINERALIZATION 
 
In all six deposits, all of the intrusive rocks can carry significant amounts of pyrrhotite + 
chalcopyrite + pentlandite (+ accessory PGM's). Mineralization style can be divided into: 
 
• Disseminated mineralization: <20% sulphide 
 In gabbro and pyroxenite, sulphides are generally coarse disseminations less than 10%.  
 disseminations (rare), coarse disseminations, medium to large blebs. 
 
• Net textured mineralization: 20-75% sulphide 
 Net textured mineralization mainly occurs in the more magnesian phases as 
 intercumulus  matrix material together with olivine grading into net texture (>25% to 
 ~40%) where oikocrysts are a lesser component (sulphides never occur within 
 oikocrysts). 
 
• Semi-massive - Massive mineralization: >75% sulphide 

Semi-massive – massive mineralization generally occurs at the stratigraphic bottom of 
the deposit. Sulphides consist of pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite +/- pentlandite.  

 
• Remobilized massive sulphide veins and stringers 
 Massive sulphide veins and stringers (essentially 100% sulphide) are remobilized into 
 fractures, contacts and joint planes; veins are most commonly found near the highest 
 concentrations of primary sulphide, but are more rarely found in any rock type including 
 barren country rocks. Massive sulphide veins pinch and swell within metres, from 
 veinlets to three m thick masses, and though generallysubvertical, they may be found 
 anastomosing into any attitude. Pentlandite is only (and always) visible in remobilized 
 veins, forming large (2-10mm) 'eyes' that align on foliation planes. 
 
For detailed mineralogical descriptions of each of the six deposits, the reader is referred to Sub-
sections 6.2.1 to 6.2.6 above.

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 
9.1 GOLDBROOK 2007 EXPLORATION PROGRAM OVERVIEW 

9.1.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Beginning in 2007, Goldbrook had acquired all of the properties comprising the Raglan Group of 
Properties, and all JV partnerships had been terminated. From 2007 to the date of this report, all 
exploration and drilling programs undertaken on the Raglan Property were completed by 
Goldbrook.  
 
The 2007 exploration program consisted of 20,523 metres of BQ size core drilling in 133 holes, 
geological mapping and prospecting, a heli-borne VTEM geophysical survey, borehole EM 
surveys on 90 of 133 drill holes, walking ground magnetic survey for a total of 381.8 
km,MaxMin EM surveys for a total of 189.7 km on Allard West, Bravo, Delta East, Echo, 
Lightning, Mystery, Pillow, River North, Superfortress, Timtu and Wackett areas, SQUID 
MLEM surveys for a total of 18.9 km in the Getty-Sylvie area and a total of 9.0 km in Stuka 
area. 
 
The 2007 drilling program along the Belanger trend consisted of 1) in-fill and extension drilling 
on known Ni-Cu-PGE zones (Getty, Sylvie and Bravo B4 zones) with high potential for 
expansion, and, 2) testing at lesser known prospects and new targets as part of longer-term 
exploration objectives.  
 
Eighty one percent (81%) of drilling metreage was spent on in-fill and extension at Getty, Sylvie 
and Bravo B4, 1% was spent on Mystery in the Belanger West area and 18% was spent in the 
Belanger East area. 
 
The 2007 drilling program identified new, previously unknown sulphide concentrations which 
either enhanced known deposits or proved the presence and potential for new and significant 
sulphide systems. In particular drilling expanded the Bravo B4, Getty and Sylvie Zones, 
identified Timtu and PAD1 Deposits, and intercepted the first mineralization intervals at the 
Mystery prospect. The 2007 drilling program further demonstrated the economic potential for the 
discovery of new Ni-Cu-Co-PGE sulphide systems within the Raglan belt. 
 
The ground geophysical surveys proved to be useful in outlining the ultramafic body, identifying 
conductors and assisting drill targeting, and provided an important database for making informed 
exploration decisions in the future. 

9.2 GROUND GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS 
 
The 2007 ground geophysical program consisted of 1) bore hole EM surveys of 90 out of the 133 
holes drilled in 2007, 2) walking ground magnetic survey for a total of 381.8 km, 3) MaxMin 
EM survey for a total of 189.7 km on Allard West, Bravo, Delta East, Echo, Lightning, Mystery, 
Pillow, River North, Superfortress, Timtu and Wackett areas, 4) SQUID MLEM survey for a 
total of 18.9 km in the Getty-Sylvie area and a total of 9.0 km in B8 Stuka area.

Borehole EM surveys 
 
Goldbrook contracted Crone Geophysics and Exploration Ltd, ("Crone") to conduct borehole 
pulse electromagnetic surveys on Bravo, Getty, Sylvie, Timtu, Mystery, PAD1/R2, River North 
and Wackett Zones.  Out of the 133 holes drilled in 2007, 90 holes were surveyed. 
 
The equipment used was a Crone Pulse EM Borehole system, which included a 2.4 kW 
transmitter with a 120V voltage regulator powered by a 4.5hp motor generator. The Crone 
Digital 187 Receiver was used to collect the field data. The synchronization between the 
Transmitter and the Receiver was maintained by direct cable synchronization.  
 
Ground Magnetics 
 
GeophysiqueTMC, ("TMC") based out of Quebec was contracted to conduct a walking ground 
magnetic survey in the Bravo, Echo, Delta East, Lightning, Mystery, River, Superfortress, 
Wackett and Getty-Sylvie areas. In the Getty-Sylvie area, only tie-line, infill and extension work 
were done to add to the historical data. A gem gsm-35 instrument was used to measure the total 
magnetic field. The survey was conducted at a 50 m line interval for a total of 381.8 km.  
 
MaxMin EM survey 
 
TMC was also contracted to conduct the MaxMinHLEM survey in 2007 in the Allard West, 
Bravo, Delta East, Echo, Lightning, Mystery, Pillow, River North, Superfortress, Timtu and 
Wackett areas. An Apex Max-Min I system with a 100 m coil separation was used. The inphase 
and quadrature (out-of-phase) components at three frequencies (110, 880, and 3520 Hz) were 
measured and recorded at 25 m intervals along the grid lines. The line interval was 50 m except 
for the 100 m survey line interval in the Bravo and Delta East areas and 150-200 m line interval 
in the Echo area. The topography along the lines was also recorded. A total of 189.7 line-km was 
surveyed.  
 
SQUID-sensor MLEM survey 
 
Crone was contracted to conduct a Moving Loop Pulse Electromagnetic Survey utilizing a 
SQUID magnetometer on the Getty - Sylvie Grid during the period of June 30 - July 24 2007 and 
on the Stuka area from August 19-28 2007. Forty (40) lines totalling 18.9 km were surveyed in 
the Getty-Sylvie grid and 12 lines totalling nine km were surveyed in the Stuka area. The Crone 
High Power Pulse EM system was used for the moving loop surveys. A 200×300 m loop was 
utilized. Within the loop, 40 lines (50 m apart) were surveyed utilizing one SQUID device. The 
loop was moved along the line at 50m intervals with the survey stations moving at the same 50 
m interval until the end of the line when the equipment and loop wire would be moved to the 
next survey area/lines.  
 
Results of the various geophysical surveys were useful in outlining the ultramafic body, 
identifying conductors and assisting drill targeting.  
 
9.3 2008 EXPLORATION PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
 
The 2008 exploration program consisted of 12,000 metres of BQ size core drilling, a remote 
sensing program that covered large parts of the Raglan Property, a regional geology and 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 60 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

sampling program, interpretation of VTEM geophysical data collected in 2007, and reclamation 
of two camp sites previously used for exploration in parts of the Raglan Property. 
 
The drilling component consisted of a total of 11,992 metres of BQ size core in 59 holes at the 
following sites: 
 
Mystery Zone – 8,161.5 metres in 35 holes delineated this new deposit; 
Allard area – 301.0 metres in two holes in an area west of the Getty Deposit; 
Sylvie Zone – 2,098.6 metres in 12 holes to expand the known deposit; 
Midway showing area – 554.6 metres in four holes at the Midway showing area; 
Pad-1/R2 area – 876.6 metres in six holes to expand the R2 Deposit and test the south limb of a 
bifurcated ultramafic body in the Pad-1/R2 area. 
 
The remote sensing program consisted of: 
 
A LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey  was completed over the most explored part of the 
Belanger trend, in order to generate a digital model of the earth's surface. Data were collected by 
an aircraft based laser over 53 linear-km and 760 sq km of the Belanger trend. 
 
A VNIR (visible and near infrared) &SWIR (shortwave infrared) hyperspectral survey was 
completed over vast parts of the Raglan Property to collect data for visible-thermal imaging of 
the earth surface – high resolution photography was also collected along with this survey. 
 
A 'SEBASS' (mid-long infrared) hyperspectral survey was completed over large parts of the 
eastern part of the property and strips over the western parts in order to generate thermal 
imaging. 
 
The regional geology program consisted of: 
 
1)geological mapping and sampling over fifteen (15) areas including West Belanger, Gunga, 
Solo & Chui, Phoenix, South Kozmo, Mystery, Six Lakes, Ben, Sylvie Midway, MIC, Hill, West 
Pillow, East Pillow, Pad-1/R2, Window and SE Claims; 
 
2)reconnaissance examination traverses and sampling over seven (7) areas including the Allard, 
Cecilia, Delta East, Juliet, Moon Lake, Thunder, and True North areas. Geological stations were 
made at 323 separate locations, and 128 field grab samples were sent in for geochemical 
analyses, and; 
 
3)rock geochemical sampling over three grids: the MIC showing, the Mystery prospect, and the 
Mystery SE extension. 
 
In total approximately 13,000 hectares of ground was traversed and/ or geologically mapped.  

9.3.1  2008 GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS 
 
VTEM 
 
Processing and analysis were completed on VTEM geophysical data collected in 2007 on 7,133 
line-km over the Belanger trend. This work was conducted by Condor Consulting Inc., 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 61 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

("Condor") of Lakewood, Colorado to assist with drill targeting and spotting of holes in the 
Mystery, Allard-Getty-Sylvie, Mic and Pad areas during the 2008 drilling program. 
 
The first level of analysis consisted of an assessment and correction of data as required, and 
production of plan maps of EM conductivity and magnetics, pseudo-sections of EM responses 
and 3-D images of isocontour EM bodies and magnetic bodies. 
 
The Processing and analysis was taken to the 'Fly to Drill' stage for four focus areas - the 
Mystery, Allard- Getty-Sylvie, Mic and Pad areas noted above. This interpretation consisted of 
the generation of 'Maxwell plates' that represent conductive horizons and suggested drill holes 
to test the anomalies. 
 
LiDAR 
 
After completion of several days of ground work to accurately locate, by differential GPS, a 
series of survey control points, data were collected by an aircraft based laser over 53 km (760 sq 
km) of the Belanger trend. The LiDAR survey resulted in production of a surface DEM and 
elevation contours with an accuracy of +/- 50 cm. These data were particularly useful to confirm 
differential GPS locations of drill-hole collars, to provide an accurate representation of the 
surface in areas of drilling. 
 
VNIR&SWIR Hyperspectral survey 
 
A hyperspectral survey over the VNIR (visible and near infrared) &SWIR (shortwave infrared) 
Spectrums, along with high resolution photography were completed over 2,432 km2 of the 
Goldbrook claims by instruments mounted in a Cessna 414 aircraft that was based at the Salluit 
airport.  
 
The survey is dependent on radiance/reflection of sunlight from the earth's surface and requires 
clear skies for data collection. NIR&SWIR hyperspectral surveys particularly identify various 
types of clay minerals and iron oxidation or gossan zones. 
 
'SEBASS' MWIR&LWIR Hyperspectral survey 
 
The third type of remote sensing survey conducted was a 'SEBASS' MWIR (midwave infrared) 
&LWIR (longwave infrared) hyperspectral survey. A SEBASS survey can be completed with the 
collection aircraft flying under cloud cover and does not require clear, sunny days as  
VNIR&SWIR hyperspectral surveys do. SEBASS thermal imaging data were collected over 
2,390.3 km2 on large portions of the eastern part of the Raglan Property and elongate strips in the 
western part. 
 
Instrumentation was mounted on a Twin Otter aircraft. Collected radiance data are converted to 
emissive data by removing the effect of the atmosphere. These data are particularly useful in the 
identification of silicate minerals.  
 
In addition to the three remote sensing surveys and high resolution photo collects, a ground-
based field program was conducted to gather spectral data for different rock types, gossans and 
vegetation of the region. SpecTIR LLC of Reno, Nevada was contracted to collect the 
VNIR&SWIR hyperspectral and high resolution photography and subcontracted Surdex Corp. 
and Aerospace Corp., both also of the USA, to collect respectively, the LiDAR and SEBASS

hyperspectral data. Cal Data Ltd. of Kelowna, B.C. provided survey organization, data QAQC, 
secondary data processing and image generation services to Goldbrook. 
 
Geological Mapping and Sampling 
 
The 2008 regional program focused on the entire Belanger trend from West Belanger to Delta 
East, as well as several small satellite areas in the Nuvilik and Bravo Properties.  Fifteen (15) 
areas were the focus for geological mapping and sampling, including West Belanger, Gunga, 
Solo & Chui, Phoenix, South Kozmo, Mystery, Six Lakes, Ben, Sylvie–Midway, MIC, Hill, 
West Pillow, East Pillow, Pad-1/R2, Window and SE Claims. 
 
Seven (7) areas were the focus for property traverses and sampling, including the areas Allard, 
Cecilia, Delta East, Juliet, Moon Lake, Thunder, and True North. In total approximately 13,000 
hectares of ground was traversed and/ or geologically mapped.  
 
Geological stations were made at 323 separate locations, and 128 field grab samples were sent in 
for geochemical analyses. The samples were initially prepared at ALS Chemex in Yellowknife 
and later analyzed for multi-elements by ALS method ME-MS61, for precious metal by PGM-
ICP27 and/or for Ni- Cu-Co by ALS method OG46 at ALS Chemex in North Vancouver. No 
standards were inserted in the field grab samples. 
 
9.4 2009 EXPLORATION PROGRAM OVERVIEW 
 
The 2009 exploration program consisted of 16,226 metres of BQ size core drilling in 87 holes, 
regional geological mapping, target assessment including geological evaluation, analysis using a 
portable XRF instrument, large-scale mapping and rock sampling, an airborne VTEM survey and 
borehole EM surveys on 39 of 87 drill holes, further analysis and interpretation of VTEM data 
collected in 2007, environmental water & sediment sampling, and reclamation at Camp 
Belanger, storage areas in both Salluit and Kangiqsujuaq and assisting the KRG with its 
continuing reclamation program on historic abandoned exploration sites. 
 
The 2009 drilling program along the Belanger trend consisted of 1) in-fill and extension drilling 
on known Ni-Cu-PGE zones (the Mystery, Timtu and Pad zones) with high potential for 
expansion, and 2) testing at lesser known prospects and new targets as part of longer-term 
exploration objectives. 
 
Fifty-two percent (52%) of drilling was completed on in-fill and extension of known zones, 25% 
was spent on targets in the Belanger West area, 20% in the East Belanger area and 2% in the far 
eastern Ungava area. 
 
The 2009 exploration drilling program was deemed highly successful in that it identified new, 
previously unknown sulphide concentrations which either enhanced known deposits or proved 
the presence and potential for new and significant sulphide systems. In particular drilling 
expanded the known resources at Mystery, discovered the Mystery North Zone and discovered a 
very significant sulphide system at Timtu. Drilling at other sites in 2009 returned significant 
results and provided targets requiring further testing in 2010. 
 
The regional geological mapping program proved useful in better understanding the type, size 
and areal distribution of nickel-sulphide host rocks.

Target assessment resulted in the confirmation and identification of numerous other areas of 
interest/showings that warrant analysis and specific drill targets. Some of these areas are also 
candidates for further geophysical surveys or tests with methods such as gravity, ground 
magnetics, ZTEM, and SQUID-sensor ground EM, and possibly for more detailed VTEM 
analysis. In addition, analysis of regional geochemical data (rock, soil and till) may provide 
insight or support other evidence for drilling. 
 
9.4.1 2009 PROPERTY WIDE EXPLORATION PROGRAMS 
 
Regional Geological Mapping 
 
During the 2009 field season, regional geological mapping over an area of ~320 km2 was 
completed along the Belanger trend. The area covered an irregular elongate strip of land over 56 
km in length. A distance of over 517 km was traversed during the 2009 field season to cover the 
ground, and a total of 1,387 geological stations were taken over the area. 
 
Forty-seven surface rock samples were collected during the regional mapping program. Twelve 
of the samples returned anomalous Ni and Cu values, ranging from 2370 to 7940 ppm Ni (0.24% 
to 0.79% Ni); and from 1125 to 6810 ppm Cu (0.11% to 0.68% Cu). These values are all well 
above background levels for the rocks, and indicate very good potential for the relative areas.  
 
Regional Target Assessment 
 
In the summer of 2009 the Innov-X XRF analyser was used in 22 separate areas in order to 
assess mineral potential. The XRF analyser was successful in distinguishing nickel bearing 
sulphides from non nickel bearing sulphides. It does not replace traditional geochemical assays, 
but in conjunction with mapping and prospecting, it provides data for in-field assessment of 
prospective areas. 
 
On the Belanger Property, the Mystery, Maverick, Getty North, Getty Hot Plate, Sylvie Lake 
Southeast, Timtu, Pillow Lake, Central Pillow Lake, Pillow Lake East, and Pillow Lake 
Southeast, were evaluated with the XRF analyzer in predefined grids. The areas deemed a 
priority for investigation were the Maverick, Getty North, Getty Hot Plate, Timtu, and Pillow 
Lake Southeast.  
 
On the Ungava Property, four areas were tested with the XRF analyser, including: Area 1, Area 
2, Sweet Chili and Area 3. All of the areas occur within prospective geological horizons that 
have received minimal exploration in the past, due to over-burden covering much of the area, 
and little outcrop exposure. As such, all of the areas warrant analysis of VTEM data collected in 
2009 and consideration for follow-up and more detailed ground EM and magnetic surveys. 
 
Geophysical Program 
 
Geophysical data collection consisted of 1) an airborne VTEM geophysical survey of a total of 
9,409 line km including tie-lines in three blocks; and 2) borehole EM surveying of 40 of the 87 
drill holes. Work also continued in 2009 on analysis and interpretation of VTEM geophysical 
data collected over the Belanger area in 2007. 

  



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 64 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

VTEM Geophysical Survey 
 
The VTEM airborne survey was completed in three blocks comprised of the north-western 
Nuvilikblock with 3,447 line-km of traverse and 354 line-km of tie-lines, the north-eastern 
Wakehamblock with 2,586 line-km of traverse and 265 line-km of tie-lines, and the south-
eastern Ungavablock with 2,504 line-km of traverse and 254 line-km of tie-lines. 
 
Condor conducted QAQC on the survey data as they were collected by Geotech Ltd. and also 
completed a preliminary analysis that lead to decisions to expand the Nuvilik block to cover off 
on EM anomalies at the southern boundary of the planned survey block. The same was done for 
the Wakeham block.  
 
Interpretation had not been completed at the time of writing. 
 
Borehole EM Surveys 
 
Crone conducted borehole EM (BHEM) surveys on 40 of 87 holes.  
 
The interpreted BHEM surveys were useful in providing additional data to: 1) assess the need for 
further drillholes to test the potential of a drill target area, 2) to assist with cross-section 
geological interpretation, and 3) to directly detect mineralized zones.

10.2 2008 DIAMOND DRILL PROGRAM RESULTS 
 
In 2008, Goldbrook drilled a total of 11,992 metres of BQ size core in 59 holes.  Drill contractors 
Bradley Nuvumiut Drilling, ("Bradley") were retained for the season, drilling from early July to 
late September, with a two week hiatus in mid-summer.  
 
The 2008 program was successful in outlining a large continuous mineralized zone at the 
Mystery Deposit. Mineralization extends over 175 m in strike length and more than 300 m in 
depth on some sections. Drilling at the Sylvie Deposit confirmed local down dip and lateral 
mineralization extensions and provided a much better understanding of the geometry and 
mineralization setting of the deposit. The minor drilling program at the PAD-1/R2 prospect 
extended mineralization at depth and also to the west. The Allard VTEM anomaly was explained 
by graphitic argillite and will not be drilled further. Drill results at the Midway prospect were 
disappointing and may suggest that a detailed ground geophysical survey is necessary to better 
define targets in the area.  
 
The most significant results for the 2008 drilling are presented in Table 10-2 below.

10.3 2009 DIAMOND DRILL PROGRAM RESULTS 
 
The 2009 drill program consisted of 16,226 metres of BQ size core in 87 holes on numerous 
zones and areas on the Property. 
 
The program proved successful by drilling on, and increasing the size of three of the six nickel-
sulphide deposits, and by better defining the potential for, and location of, additional zones for 
further exploration within the Raglan Property.

11.0 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH 
 
11.1 2007 DRILL PROGRAM 
 
This section is summarized from an internal report prepared for Goldbrook by G. Carter, P. Geo. 
who was commissioned by Goldbrook to independently verify and assure the quality and 
reliability of sampling methodology and analytical data of the 2007 Raglan drill program. 
 
Core samples were collected by sawing the BQ core in half, with one half submitted to the lab 
and the other half kept as a geological reference in the original core box. 
 
Geologists logged each hole and marked intervals to be sawn and sampled on one metre intervals 
except where geological constraints dictated otherwise. Prospective intervals were sampled to 
reflect variations in lithology, alteration and mineralization. Samples were not allowed to cross 
lithology contacts or abrupt changes in mineralization styles including the three principal types 
of mineralization - disseminated, net-textured and massive sulphide. Generally, a couple of 
samples were taken above and below mineralized zones. 
 
Geotechnicians measured and calculated RQD, core recoveries and other geotechnical 
measurements, and photographed batches of core in four boxes per frame. Recoveries were 
generally good to excellent and were above 90% on average. Adequate labelling provided hole 
and interval identification. Drill holes were surveyed during drilling using Reflex Maxibore and 
Gyro survey instruments to provide azimuth and dip at depth. Collar locations were established 
by high resolution Trimble GPS technology. No attempt was made at marking or orienting the 
core. 
 
Three-tag pre-numbered sample booklets were used to identify and track samples. Part 1 was 
temporarily attached to the sample interval in the core box and was later put in the sample bag 
with half of the core once it was cut. Part 2 was tagged at the end of the sample interval. Part 
3remained as a record in the sample book, indicating drill hole number, interval sampled and 
type of analysis required. An identical sample number was then written with a waterproof marker 
on a plastic sample bag laid beside the place where the sample was to be collected. The core 
length to be sawn was marked with a line. One half of the core sample was taken with Part 1 tag 
(for field duplicate samples, core halves were sawn into quarters and each quarter was 
independently numbered). 
 
The bags were sealed with ziploc ties and left in position beside the box.  
 
Quality control samples were used in 2007 - blanks, standard reference materials (sourced from 
CANMET and OREAS) and field duplicate samples were inserted into the sample stream at 
regular intervals. Field duplicates were produced by sawing a core half into quarter core.  
 
There are no sampling or recovery issues that would be considered to materially impact the 
accuracy and reliability of the results. 
 
11.2 2008 DRILL PROGRAM 
 
The following relies heavily upon the 2008 Sampling and QC Program Report that constituted 
Appendix K of the 2008 Assessment Report.

Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

At the end of each shift, core boxes were brought to the Belanger Camp by helicopter, and boxes 
were open for immediate inspection. Before pulling the rods each hole was surveyed with a 
downhole gyro tool to verify the subsurface trace of the hole. 
 
Boxes were marked, and magnetic susceptibility was measured at one meter intervals. Core 
recoveries were measured between core blocks. Typical mineralized and barren samples were 
weighed to determine each unit's specific gravity. Every 20th specific gravity sample was sent to 
ALS Chemex Lab as part of a specific gravity QC check. 
 
Geotechnical data were measured and recorded. 
 
Each geologist logged the core, recording all data using custom designed Gemcom logger 
software. Sample intervals were marked and recorded before being sent to the core sawing 
shack. One to two metre long samples were taken over mineralized intersections and shorter 
samples (0.2m to 1m) were taken over richer mineralized intervals.  
 
A control sample was introduced every 11th sample. In total, Goldbrook used five certified 
reference materials, including a certified blank. Three sets of duplicates were inserted regularly 
to monitor sampling, laboratory preparation and analytical precision. Duplicate types consisted 
of 1) field duplicates (¼core sawn duplicates), 2) preparation duplicates (preparation from the 
coarse reject material), and 3)pulp duplicates (repeat pulp analysis specifically requested from 
the lab). 
 
Goldbrook retained ALS Chemex for the analytical work and sent a total of 1,820 samples  to the 
laboratory. One hundred ninety four of these samples were control samples, of which 28 were 
blanks and 103 certified reference materials. Of 63 duplicate pairs, 22were field duplicates, 24 
were preparation duplicates and 17 were pulp duplicates. 
 
Samples were bagged and shipped to the ALS Chemex Lab Yellowknife, N.W.T. preparation 
laboratory where the samples were dried, crushed and pulverized. Pulps were sent to the North 
Vancouver lab for final analysis. 
 
There are no sampling or recovery issues that would be considered to materially impact the 
accuracy and reliability of the results. 
 
11.3 2009 DRILL PROGRAM 
 
The 2009 sampling method and procedures were identical to those in 2008. 
 
A control sample was introduced every 11th sample. In total Goldbrook used four certified 
reference materials, including a certified blank. Three sets of duplicates were inserted regularly 
to monitor sampling, laboratory preparation and analytical precision. Duplicate types consisted 
of field duplicates (¼ core sawn duplicates), preparation duplicates (preparation from the coarse 
reject material), and pulp duplicates (repeat pulp analyses specifically requested from the lab).  
 
Goldbrook retained ALS Chemex for the analytical work and sent a total of 3,070 samples to the 
laboratory. Three hundred one (301) of these samples were control samples. Sixty nine (69) of 
those were blanks, 144 were reference materials. Of 98 duplicate pairs, 34 were field duplicates, 
33 were preparation duplicates and 31 were pulp duplicates.

Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

ALS in house QC was extensive, including 203 lab duplicates of Goldbrook's samples (checks), 
and 11duplicates of Goldbrook's reference materials. Overall ALS used 822 internal standards 
and 419 blanks to test both base metals (OG46) and platinum group metals (PGM27).  
 
There are no sampling or recovery issues that would be considered to materially impact the 
accuracy and reliability of the results.

12.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
12.1 2007 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
All samples were crushed and prepared at the ALS Chemex laboratory in Val-d'Or (QC) and 
shipped to ALS Chemex, Vancouver, B.C. for analysis. No employee, officer, director or 
associate of Goldbrook was involved in any of the sample preparation or analysis.  
 
Duplicate samples and blanks were inserted approximately one every 20 samples by Goldbrook 
in order that lab precision and accuracy could be monitored. Four different certified reference 
materials were used in the 2007 program. In total, 156 reference materials, sample duplicates and 
blanks were analyzed in addition to those required by ALS Chemex internal analytical protocols. 
 
The samples were analyzed using the ALS Chemex ME-MS61, PGMICP24, Hg-CV41 and S-
IR08 packages. The ME-MS61 package involves 47 element determination by three acid 
digestion, acid leach, and a combination of ICP-MS and ICP-AES analyses. Samples with >1% 
nickel or copper were re-analyzed using the ME-ICP81 package for ore grade samples. 
 
12.2 2008 AND 2009 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 
All samples were crushed and prepared at the ALS Chemex laboratory in Yellowknife, N.W.T. 
and shipped to ALS Chemex, Vancouver, B.C. for analysis. No employee, officer, director or 
associate of Goldbrook was involved in any of the sample preparation or analysis. 
 
In addition to quality control by ALS Chemex, Goldbrook inserted certified reference materials, 
blanks and duplicates into the sample stream for independent verification of quality control. 
 
Assay results for nickel, copper and cobalt were determined by acid digest and ICP-AES finish. 
Platinum, palladium and gold were determined by lead fire assay and ICP-AES finish.  
 
It is the author's opinion that the sample preparation, analysis and security were satisfactory and 
in keeping with good industry practise.

13.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 
13.1 SITE VISIT AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLING 
 
Mr. Antoine Yassa, P. Geo., visited the Raglan Property from August 21 to 23, 2009. A total of 
37 samples were taken from 20 holes by doing a quarter split of the half core remaining in the 
box. The deposits sampled were Bravo, Getty, Sylvie, Mystery, Pad and Timtu. At no time prior 
to the time of sampling were any employees of Goldbrook advised as to the location of the 
samples to be taken. 
 
Samples were packed by Mr. Yassa into rice bags, sealed with a ziploc tie and taken by Mr. 
Yassa to Rouyn-Noranda. From there the samples were shipped via Dicom to SGS Mineral 
Services in Toronto, Ontario for analysis. 
 
Results of the independent sampling by P&E versus the original results as reported by Goldbrook 
are presented in Figures 13.1 to 13.6 below.

13.2 QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAMS FOR HISTORICAL WORK 
 
A detailed review was made of all the Raglan Property QC from the years 2003 to 2009 
inclusive. There were detailed QC reports for the years 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In the 
reports the author examined, QC Programs were mentioned as having been done in 2004, 2005 
and 2006 but there was no discussion of results, nor were there any raw data to examine.  
 
For all the years in which the QC data were not available, (i.e. 2004, 2005, 2006) the author 
requested and received from ALS Chemex all the pertinent internal lab QC data. This task was 
made easier by the fact that ALS Chemex was the lab used by every joint venture and joint 
venture partner from 2003 to 2006. Goldbrook continued using Chemex in 2007 and retained 
them as the principal lab through 2009. 
 
All the internal lab QC certificates for 2004 through 2006 were examined, and it can be stated 
that the data for these years, based on ALS Chemex internal QC are of good quality. 

13.3 QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM FOR 2003 JV 
 
The Novawest/Cascadia JV did not institute their own QC program, however they monitored the 
results using Chemex' internal QC, and they used SGS Mineral Services as an umpire lab for 
verification purposes. The QP on the project in 2003 detailed the QC results. The author has 
reviewed the results and the QP's conclusions and is in agreement with them that the 2003 data 
are of good quality.

13.4 QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAMS FOR 2007 THROUGH 2009 

13.4.1 QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM 2007 
 
Quality control samples were used in 2007 - blanks, standard reference materials (sourced from 
CANMET and OREAS) and field duplicate samples were inserted into the sample stream at 
regular intervals. Field duplicates were produced by sawing a core half into quarters.  
 
G. Carter, P. Geo. was commissioned by Goldbrook to independently verify and assure the 
quality and reliability of sampling methodology and analytical data of the 2007 Raglan drill 
program. 
 
The author reviewed all raw data and conclusions advanced by G. Carter and agrees that the 
2007 data were of good quality. 

13.4.2 QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM 2008 
 
For the 2008 program, a control sample was introduced every 11th sample. In total, Goldbrook 
used five certified reference materials, including a certified blank. Three sets of duplicates were 
inserted regularly to monitor sampling, laboratory preparation and analytical precision. Duplicate 
types consisted of 1) field duplicates (¼ core sawn duplicates), 2) preparation duplicates 
(preparation from the coarse rejects), and 3) pulp duplicates (repeat pulp analysis specifically 
requested from the lab). 
 
Goldbrook again retained ALS Chemex for the analytical work and sent a total of 1,820 samples 
from the drill program to the laboratory. One hundred ninety four, (194) of these samples were 
control samples of which 28 were blanks and 103 reference materials. Of 63 duplicate pairs, 22 
were field duplicates, 24 were preparation duplicates and 17 were pulp duplicates. 
 
ALS Chemex carried out in-house QC work introducing a total of 1,191 controls. Both QC data 
sets were statistically and graphically monitored each time new assay results were imported into 
the Goldbrook master database using the commercial DataShed database and QC program. 
 
The author examined all 2008 data and states they are of good quality. 

13.4.3 QUALITY CONTROL PROGRAM 2009 
 
The 2009 QC program maintained the same procedures as the 2008 program. A control sample 
was introduced every 11th sample. In total Goldbrook used four certified reference materials, 
including a certified blank. Three sets of duplicates were inserted regularly to monitor sampling, 
laboratory preparation and analytical precision. Duplicate types consisted of field duplicates (¼ 
core sawn duplicates), preparation duplicates (preparation from the coarse rejects), and pulp 
duplicates (repeat pulp analysis specifically requested from the lab). 
 
Goldbrook retained ALS Chemex for the analytical work and sent a total of 3,070 samples from 
the drill program to the laboratory. Three hundred one, (301) of these samples were control 
samples; 69 blanks and 144 reference materials. Of 98 duplicate pairs, 34 were field duplicates, 
33 were preparation duplicates and 31 were pulp duplicates. 
 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 78 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

ALS in-house QC was extensive, including 203 ALS Lab duplicates of Goldbrook's samples 
(checks), and 11 duplicates of Goldbrook's standards. Overall ALS used 822 internal standards 
and 419 blanks to test both base metals (OG46) and platinum group metals (PGM27).  
 
ALS QC results were compiled and evaluated and the laboratory was advised when any error or 
bias was noted. Both QC data sets were statistically and graphically monitored when each assay 
certificate was imported into DataShed's database and QC program. 
 
The author examined all data from all years 2003 through 2009 and declares them to be of good 
quality and pertinent for use in resource estimation.

14.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
14.1 NUNAVIK NICKEL PROJECT 
 
The Nunavik Nickel Project previously belonged to Canadian Royalties Inc., ("CRI" delisted). 
As of January 13, 2010, Jien Canada Mining Ltd., ("JCM") acquired all of the outstanding 
common shares of Canadian Royalties (being the Shares held by holders other than JCM) in 
exchange for $0.80 per Share. As a result of the Arrangement, JCM now owns 100% of the 
outstanding Shares of Canadian Royalties. Goldbrook owns 25% of the voting shares of JCM.  
 
The Expo, Mesamax, Mequillon, Allammaq and Ivakkak Deposits lie on the Expo-Ungava 
Property located approximately 80 kilometres west of the village of Kangiqsujuaq, (Wakeham 
Bay) and approximately 30 kilometres east-southeast of the Katinniq Mine, part of the Raglan 
operations of Xstrata Nickel, (a subsidiary of Xstrata PLC). The Property is centred at 6825000N 
and 585000E in UTM NAD83 Zone 18. 
 
The Puimajuq Deposit lies on the New Foreurs East Property, which is contiguous to the east of 
the Expo-Ungava Property, (see Figure 14.1). 
 
In a Technical Report titled, "Technical Report on the Allammaq, Expo, Ivakkak, Mequillon, 
Mesamax and Puimajuq Ni-Cu-PGE Deposits of the Nunavik Nickel Project, Nunavik, Quebec", 
authored by P&E Mining Consultants Inc. and dated April 14, 2010, the total resources are

14.2 XSTRATA NICKEL 
 
The deposits of the currently operating Raglan Mine are located along a parallel belt of rocks 
approximately 15 to 20 kilometres to the north of the Raglan Property. 
 
The Raglan Trend stretches 55 kilometres from east to west, with a series of many high-grade 
ore deposits scattered along its length. While the general geology of the South Trend and Raglan 
Trend is similar with comparable sulphide mineral paragenesis and with similar sulphide 
textures, the Ni-Cu ratios are different. The Raglan Trend displays a 3:1 Ni-Cu ratio that 
contrasts with that of the South Trend, which is generally closer to parity. 
 
Mineralization at Raglan is associated with up to nine separate peridotite flows, which constitute 
an overall ultramafic body that has been identified along the 55 kilometres. Deposits along this 
trend include from east to west the Donaldson, Boundary, West Boundary, 13-14, 5-8, Katinniq, 
East Lake, 2-3 Zone and Cross Lake Deposits. The thicknesses of the sulphide lenses vary from 
a few metres to a few tens of metres, and the strike length can vary from tens of metres to 200 
metres. Production began in April 1998 at Katinniq, which consists of over 20 discrete lenses of 
massive and disseminated sulphide, which vary in size from 10,000 tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes 
(Falconbridge Limited, Website May 2003). The lenses extend along an ultramafic horizon 1400 
metres in strike length, which dips to the northwest at 45º to 50º. The mineralized horizon has 
been traced to a depth of 350 metres and is open in that direction.  
 
The Raglan operations consisted of open pits (which have now been exhausted), three 
underground mines, a concentrator, power plant, accommodation and administration buildings, 
fresh water supply and fuel storage tanks. The mine site is linked by all-weather roads to an 
airstrip at Donaldson and to the concentrate, storage and ship-loading facilities at Deception Bay.  
 
The ore from the Raglan Mines is crushed, ground and treated at the Raglan mill to produce a 
nickel-copper concentrate. Milling capacity is now approximately 3,500 tonnes per day. Nickel 
capacity at the concentrator is now over 28,000 tonnes of nickel-in-concentrate per year. Xstrata 
Nickel has expanded mine production to 1.3 million tonnes per year.  The project to further 
expand capacity to 2.0 million tonnes per year has been shelved indefinitely. 
 
The concentrate is trucked 100 kilometres to Deception Bay and then shipped via ocean freighter 
to Québec City within an expected shipping season of at least eight months of the year, and a 
minimum of six shipments per year. From there, it is sent by rail to the smelter in Sudbury. The 
smelted matte material is returned by rail to Québec City, and then shipped overseas to Xstrata's 
Norwegian Nikkelverk refinery for refining into pure metals.  
 
The 2008 versus 2009 production figures are presented in Table 14-2.

On December 5th, 2007 Xstrata Nickel announced exploration results and declared that Zone 5-8 
was now the largest mineralized zone in Raglan's history and that Zone 5-8 would be Raglan's 
next mining centre. Zone 5-8 now contains proven and probable mineral reserves of 0.8 million 
tonnes at 3.02% nickel and 0.80% copper, measured and indicated mineral resources of 0.4 
million tonnes at 1.30% nickel and 0.35% copper, and inferred mineral resources of 11.5 million 
tonnes at 3.00% nickel and 0.80% copper.

While the authors will not suggest at this point that the Goldbrook deposits will attain the scale 
of the Raglan Mine deposits in the Raglan Trend, there is an undeniable similarity in host rock, 
ore genesis, style of mineralization and metallurgy.

15.0 METALLURGICAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
In June 2008, Goldbrook engaged the services of Wardrop Engineering Inc. (Wardrop) to 
undertake a Level 2 Scoping Study to investigate the potential for the economic recovery of 
nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) from the Getty Deposit on the Raglan Project.  
 
The test work was limited to undertaking a bulk flotation of the potentially marketable minerals 
with some limited upgrading (cleaning) of the initial (rougher) concentrate. The reagents that 
were chosen are typical of those used for these minerals without determining optimum dosage or 
addition points (Aero 3477, sodium isopropyl xanthate, and MIBC frother, with lime added for 
pH control). 
 
Three bulk samples from drill core representing the component fractions of the Deposit were 
tested at SGS Metallurgical Laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario. These included: 
 
• A massive sulphide composite containing 3.7% Ni and 0.9% Cu; 
• A net textured composite containing 1.5% Ni and 0.7% Cu; 
• A disseminated composite containing 0.65% Ni and 0.65% Cu. 
 
Each test was conducted on a two kilogram (kg) sample in a standard bench-top flotation cell 
agitated at 1,800 rotations per minute (rpm), after grinding for 24 minutes (±1). The three 
mineral types that were used above were identified from the major styles of mineralization 
encountered in drill core from Goldbrook's exploration programs. 
 
15.1 MINERALOGY RESULTS 
 
The QEMSCAN (Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by Scanning Electron Microscopy) 
mineralogical study of the massive sulphide sample product identified the following 
characteristics: 
 
• The main value minerals are pentlandite and chalcopyrite, at 10.4 wt% and 3.0 wt%, 
respectively, both of which become more abundant with increasing particle fineness. Pyrrhotite 
is a significant component to the sample, accounting for 80.8 wt% overall, which decreases with 
particle fineness. Oxides are the most abundant non-sulphide phase at 2.4 wt%, and are 
composed almost entirely of iron oxides. 
 
• Nickel occurs primarily as pentlandite, accounting for 97.3% of the nickel in the sample, 
with minor amounts of violarite (2.7%) and trace millerite group minerals. Copper occurs almost 
exclusively as chalcopyrite, with trace bornite and covellite/chalcocite/digenite. 
 
• Pentlandite and chalcopyrite exhibit a similar grain size distribution, which is slightly 
finer than the average particle and pyrrhotite size, with the majority of their respective masses in 
the 7-40μ range. Phyllosilicates and hard silicate minerals (OPX/Qtz/Fld/Amp) are all finer than 
the sulphides, with the phyllosilicates showing a greater proportion of their mass in less than 10 
μ particles. 
 
• Pentlandite liberation is quite high, with a combined global liberation of 84.7 wt%. 
Chalcopyrite liberation overall is 88.4wt%. Liberation generally increases with increasing 
fineness, though the 53 to 20μ fraction is marginally more liberated than the finer <20 μ fraction 



 

P & E Mining Consultants Inc.  Page 84 of 123 
Goldbrook Ventures Inc. Raglan Property Report No. 188 
 

for both value minerals. Pyrrhotite is very well liberated, with an overall mineral liberation of 
97.4 wt%. 
 
• The only notable association for each value mineral is with pyrrhotite, accounting for 
17.2% and 11.0 wt% of pentlandite and chalcopyrite respectively. The proportion of liberated 
value mineral generally increases while the proportion of binary value mineral: pyrrhotite 
particles decreases. 
 
• The mineralogically limiting grade vs. recovery curves show a maximum achievable 
nickel grade of 33.9%, found at 85.0% recovery, while a grade of 13.8% is achievable at 100% 
recovery. Maximum copper grade is 33.9%, found at 89.1% recovery, while a grade of 15.1% is 
achievable at 100% recovery. 
 
• Chalcopyrite liberation increases until a maximum is reached at 24μ, after which it 
decreases. At this point, the liberation achieved is 91.7%. Pentlandite liberation continues to 
increase with finer particle size, though it levels off noticeably after the 24 μ average grain size 
where 87.0% liberation is achieved. Chalcopyrite is always more liberated than pentlandite, 
though this discrepancy narrows as the particle size decreases to where the liberations at 10 μ are 
almost equivalent. 
 
15.2 METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 
The samples submitted for mineralogical and beneficiation studies were representative of the 
core recovered from the drill programs undertaken by Goldbrook.  
 
The main nickel mineral is pentlandite (about 97%) with minor amounts of Violarite and 
Millerite. 
 
Almost 100% of the copper exists as chalcopyrite, and like the pentlandite, is liberated at a 
relatively coarse grind (80% at 92 μ for the chalcopyrite and 80% at 52μ for the pentlandite). A 
quantitative evaluation of minerals using a scanning electron microscope ("QemScan") was 
undertaken to map and trace the major and minor minerals in the sample. The main sulphide 
mineral is pyrrhotite (80% in the massive sulphide), with small amounts of pyrite and no 
arsenopyrite in the samples tested. Talc was also very limited and only present in the finer 
fractions. 
 
From exploration drilling, there are three distinct forms of mineralization. They are represented 
in the following metallurgical samples: 
 
• Disseminated Composite; 
• Net textured composite; 
• Massive sulphide. 
 
The samples were ground for 23-25 minutes to liberate the sulphides from the gangue and were 
then floated using lime for pH control. A mixture of sodium isopropyl xanthate  (SIPX) and an 
Aero brand di-thiophosphate (A3477), were used as the "collector" and MIBC as the frother.  
 
The data are summarised in Table 15-1 below. Talc levels in the three samples were all relatively 
low, with only 0.2% (by mass) in the massive sulphide sample, and 0.6% in the finer fractions.

16.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
The mineral resource estimate presented herein is reported in accordance with the Canadian 
Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 and has been estimated in conformity 
with generally accepted CIM "Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves Best 
Practices" (2005) guidelines. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have 
demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the mineral 
resource will be converted into a mineral reserve. The quantity and grade of reported Inferred 
mineral resources in this estimate are conceptual in nature. 
 
All mineral resource estimation work reported herein was carried out by FH Brown MSc (Eng) 
CPG Pr.Sci.Nat., an independent Qualified Person in terms of NI43-101. FH Brown has not 
visited the sites that are the subject of this mineral resource estimate. This mineral resource 
estimate relies entirely on information and data supplied by Goldbrook. A draft copy of this 
report was reviewed by Goldbrook for factual errors. The effective date of this mineral resource 
estimate is  October 01, 2010. 
 
Mineral resource modeling and estimation were carried out using the commercially available 
Gemcom GEMS and Snowden Supervisor software programs. 
 
16.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Mr. D. Brian Grant, P. Geo., President and COO of Goldbrook, requested a mineral resource 
estimate of six deposits identified by Goldbrook on the Raglan Property, Raglan District, 
Québec, viz. the Bravo, Getty, Mystery, Pad, Sylvie and Timtu Deposits. The six deposits are 
stretched out along a curvilinear east-west trend approximately 30 km in length (Figure 16.1).

16.2 PREVIOUS RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 
P&E is not aware of any previous resource estimates for the six Raglan Deposits. 
 
16.3 DATA SUPPLIED 
 
Goldbrook supplied all data in electronic format, including drilling databases, interpreted 
sections, topography, and internal technical reports relating to the deposits. 
 
The supplied drillhole database was imported into a GEMS Access format database, which 
contains 528 drillhole records, 9,355 downhole survey records, 13,232 assay records and 4,497 
lithology records. Assay interval fields consist of Au ppm, Co %, Cu %, Ni %, Pd ppm and Pt 
ppm. Because the data represent a mixture of drilling campaigns from different companies and a 
variety of assay techniques, all assays values that were reported as below detection limit were 
converted to a nominal value of 0.0001. Summary statistics for assays are listed in Tables 16-1 
through 16-6.

16.4 DATABASE VALIDATION 
 
Industry standard validation checks were completed on the imported database. P&E typically 
validates a mineral resource database by checking for inconsistencies in naming conventions or 
analytical units, duplicate entries, interval, length or distance values less than or equal to zero, 
blank or zero-value assay results, out-of-sequence intervals, intervals or distances greater than 
the reported drill hole length, inappropriate collar locations, and missing interval and coordinate 
fields. Several minor survey and out-of-sequence interval errors were reported and corrected. No 
further significant discrepancies or errors were noted in the supplied databases. 
 
16.5 TOPOGRAPHIC MODEL 
 
A series of topographic surfaces were constructed from the Lidar surface DEM supplied by 
Goldbrook. Lidar data were collected by an aircraft based laser over 53 linear-km and 760 km2 
of the Belanger trend with a reported accuracy to within 50 cm. 
 
16.6 DOMAIN MODELING 
 
Domain models for each deposit were generated from successive polylines spaced every ten 
meters and oriented perpendicular to the trend of the mineralization. The outlines of the polylines 
were determined by the defined mineralization categories with demonstrated continuity along 
strike and down dip, and include low-grade material where necessary to maintain continuity 
between sections. All polyline vertices were snapped directly to drillhole assay intervals, in order 
to generate a true three-dimensional representation of the extent of the mineralization (Figures 
16.2a, b and c). Domain wireframes were then clipped below an overburden surface constructed 
from drillhole data. The resulting domains were used for rock coding, statistical analysis and 
grade estimation. 
 
16.7 BULK DENSITY 
 
A total of 3,049 bulk density values were supplied by Goldbrook. Average density values were 
calculated based on the defined mineralization categories, and assigned as bulk density 
parameters across the deposits for mineral resource estimation (Table 16-7).

16.8 COMPOSITING 
 
Reported assay interval lengths range from 0.03 m to 27.00m, with an average length of 1.39m. 
A total of 98% of the assay lengths are less than or equal to 2.00m (Figure 16.3). A compositing 
length of 2.00 m was therefore selected for use for mineral resource estimation. Length-weighted 
composites were calculated for all commodities within the defined mineralization domains. 
Missing sample intervals in the supplied data were assigned a nominal background grade of 
0.001. 
 
The compositing process started at the first point of intersection between the drillhole and the 
domain intersected, and halted upon exit from the domain wireframe. Composites that were less 
than 1.0 m in length were discarded so as to not introduce a short sample bias into the estimation 
process. The wireframes that represent the interpreted mineralization domains were also used to 
back-tag a rock code field into the drillhole workspace.  Each assay and composite were assigned 
a domain rock code value based on the domain wireframe that the interval midpoint fell within. 
The composite data were then exported to Gemcom extraction files for grade estimation. 
 

 
 
Figure 16.3: Assay sample length histogram 
 
16.9 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS 
 
At the request of P&E, Goldbrook geologists classified drilling intervals into broad 
mineralization classes, defined as the North Zone (Bravo and Mystery only), Net-Textured, 
Massive, Disseminated and Copper Zone (Timtu only) mineralization categories. Where the 
number or distribution of samples in an individual category was insufficient to demonstrate 
continuity they were combined into a larger domain. 
 
The Bravo deposit consists predominantly of a Disseminated domain, with a contained Massive 
unit and a distinct separate Northern domain. A small number of Net-Textured intervals were 
combined with the Disseminated domain. 
 
The Getty deposit consists of a Massive unit contained within a larger Disseminated domain.

The Mystery deposit consists of a Net-Textured domain contained primarily within a larger 
Disseminated unit, and a distinct separate Northern domain. 
 
The Pad deposit contains a mixed Net-Textured/Massive unit contained within a Disseminated 
deposit. Net-Textured and Massive intervals were combined and defined as a Massive unit. 
 
The Sylvie deposit consists of a Massive unit contained within a mixed Net-
Textured/Disseminated unit. 
 
The Timtu deposit consists of vertically-layered Copper, Disseminated and Net-textured 
domains. 
 
The highest composite averages for Ni, Cu and Co are associated with Massive domains, while 
the highest averages for Au, Pd and Pt are associated with Net-Textured domains (Table 16-8). 
 
Table 16-8: Highest average grades by domain 
 

Grade Element  Average Domain 
Au 0.15 Mystery Net-Textured 
Co 0.06 Sylvie Massive 
Cu 1.20 Bravo Massive 
Ni 1.40 Sylvie Massive 
Pd 2.24 Mystery Net-Textured 
Pt 0.55 Mystery Net-Textured 

 
A review of the basic statistics for the composited domain-coded data indicates that several of 
the domains are characterized by mixed populations and incorporate low-grade internal waste 
and scattered high-grade outliers (Tables 16-9 to 16-14). This indicates that either a non-
parametric approach or the use of grade capping with linear estimation is required to generate a 
meaningful mineral resource estimate. 
 
Correlation analysis was conducted on the composited sample data by domain in order  to assess 
the correlations between the variables as a guide to subsequent capping analyses and parameter 
selection for estimation. A high degree of correlation was observed between Ni, Cu and Co for 
all domains, and between Pd and Pt. No correlation between Au and the other grade elements 
was observed (Table 16-15).

16.10 TREATMENT OF EXTREME VALUES 
 
The presence of high-grade outliers was evaluated by examining summary statistics, histograms 
and log-probability graphs of composite sample populations for each deposit. Capping values 
were selected that minimize the rapid variation in the composite sample distribution and reduce 
the impact of high-value outliers during linear estimation. The observed correlations between 
variables were also taken into consideration in the selection of capping values. For sample 
populations where the maximum composite value was more than twice the 99th percentile, the 
99th percentile was selected as the capping level, which was implemented on composites during 
estimation (Table 16-16).  
 
Table 16-16.Composite capping levels. 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
16.11 VARIOGRAPHY 
 
Variography was carried out for each deposit on the constrained domain composites. Although 
the mineralized domains in general exhibit a reasonable sectional continuity, the overall grade 
element variography was inconclusive and did not yield discernable variograms. Additional 
future drilling may enhance the variography for the deposits. 
 
16.12 BLOCK MODEL 
 
A series of orthogonal 5m x 5m x 5m block models were established for each deposit (Table 16-
17). Each block model consists of separate folders for domain type, block density, block percent, 
estimated Ni, Co, Pt, Pd, Au and Cu grades, a calculated NSR value, and block classification. A 
percent block model was used to accurately represent the volumes and tonnages that were 
contained within the respective domain model. As a result, domain boundaries are properly 
represented by the percent model's capacity to measure infinitely variable inclusion percentages 
within a specific structure.

16.13 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 
Mineral resources were classified in accordance with guidelines established by the Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum, December 11, 2005: 
 
• Indicated Mineral Resource: "An 'Indicated Mineral Resource' is that part of a mineral 
resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics, can be 
estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical 
and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of 
the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drillholes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be 
reasonably assumed." 
 
• Inferred Mineral Resource:  "An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a mineral resource 
for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and 
limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The 
estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques 
from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drillholes." 
 
The mineral resource estimate was constrained by wireframes representing individual domains 
that form hard boundaries between their respective composite grade data sets. Due to the 
complex nature of the mineralized structures, variography was inconclusive. Block grades were 
therefore estimated using Inverse Distance Cubed (ID3) linear weighting of capped composite 
values. A two-pass series of expanding search ellipses with minimum sample requirements was 
used for sample selection, and classification was based on the Ni composite search results: 
 
• During the first pass, three to twelve composite values from two or more drillholes within an 
isotropic 30m diameter search ellipsoid were required for estimation. All block grades estimated 
during the first pass were classified as Indicated. 
 
• During the second pass, blocks not populated during the first pass were estimated. Three to 
twelve composite values from two or more drillholes within an isotropic 300m diameter search 
ellipsoid were required for estimation. All block grades estimated during the second pass were 
classified as Inferred. A small number of blocks within the domain limits fell outside the first 
and second sample pass requirements and were not assigned an estimate, as the level of 
geological continuity was considered tenuous at this distance.  
 
A NSR block value was then calculated directly from the estimated block grades based on the 
economic parameters listed in Table 16-18. Because the Bravo North domain was assayed only 
for Cu and Ni, no contribution for the other grade elements could be included for this unit.

In order to ensure that the reported mineral resources meet the CIM requirement of "reasonable 
prospects for economic extraction" a conceptual floating-cone pit shell was developed based on 
all available mineral resources (Indicated and Inferred) for each deposit. Mineral resources 
within the conceptual pit shell were then accumulated against a NSR cut-off of $40.00. 
Additional resources outside the pit-shell limits were accumulated against an underground NSR 
cut-off of $120.00 (Table 16-19). Cut-off values were derived from knowledge of similar 
projects, utilizing a processing cost of $25.00/tonne, G&A cost of $15.00/tonne and an UG 
mining cost of $80.00/tonne. Pit optimization assumed a mining cost of $2.00/tonne and a pit 
slope of 50°.

Table 16-19: Mineral resource estimate.1,2,3.4 
 

 
(1) Open pit resources ("Pit") are tabulated at a NSR cut-off value of $40.00, and accumulated within an optimized 
pit shell. 
(2) Underground resources ("UG") are tabulated at a NSR cut-off value of $120.00. 
(3) Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of 
mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, 
marketing, or other relevant issues.  
(4) The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources are conceptual in nature. There is no guarantee that all or 
any part of a mineral resource will be converted into mineral reserve. 
 
16.14 VALIDATION 
 
The block models were validated visually by the inspection of successive section lines in order to 
confirm that the block model correctly reflects the distribution of high-grade and low-grade 
samples.  
 
A validation check for global bias was completed by comparing the modeled block estimates to a 
Nearest Neighbour (NN) block estimate generated using the same search criteria and tabulated at 
a zero grade cut-off within the constraining domain. Similar values are shown for the average 
block estimate, the average sample grade and the assigned NN grade. These results demonstrate 
some smoothing of the estimate and a minimal global bias, and are deemed suitable for mineral 
resource estimation (Tables 16-20 to 16-26).

18.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
18.1 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The Raglan Property is in a highly prospective area sandwiched between a producing Ni-Cu-Co 
mine (Raglan Mine Xstrata Nickel), and the Ni-Cu-Co-PGE deposits on Jien Canada Mining's 
Nunavik Nickel Project with a projected production start-up date of Q1-2012. 
 
The deposits on the Raglan Property for which resources are reported in this Technical Report; 
Bravo, Getty, Mystery, Pad, Sylvie and Timtu Deposits, all have geology, mineralization 
geomorphology and grades consistent with the Raglan Mine and JCM deposits.  
 
The Raglan Mine, JCM and Raglan Project deposits all belong to the class of magmatic sulphide 
deposits, which occur as sulphur segregations associated with a variety of mafic and ultramafic 
magmatic rocks.  
 
Most nickel sulphide deposits consist of several closely adjacent, but discrete orebodies, which is 
the case with the Raglan Mine (currently nine known deposits) the Nunavik Nickel Project, 
(resources currently estimated for seven deposits, and more, smaller "deposits" are known) and 
the Raglan Property deposits (resources estimated for six deposits). There is no denying the 
similarities that the Raglan Property shares with the Raglan Mine and the Nunavik Nickel 
Property. 
 
All subtypes of nickel sulphide ores usually consist predominantly of the simple sulphide 
assemblage pyrrhotite-pentlandite-chalcopyrite, either as massive sulphides, sulphide-matrix 
breccias, or disseminations of sulphides.  
 
• Currently Mystery, the largest known deposit on the Raglan Property, contains 3.09 Mt 
of Indicated Resources defined in an open pit scenario, and 0.22 Mt of Indicated Resources 
defined in an underground mining scenario. The deposit has not been fully tested and remains 
open to the east and particularly at depth. 
 
• The Timtu Deposit remains open to the east, north, and at depth. 
 
• The Bravo Deposit does not have well defined limits and it remains open to the east and 

to the west. 
 
• The Sylvie Deposit is not well defined and requires further diamond drilling. 
 
• The Getty and Pad Deposits are the only deposits on the Property that are well defined in 

their limits and any further diamond drilling would be required simply to better define the 
morphology of them.

18.2 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Regional program recommendations for the Raglan Deposits are to be completed over a two year 
period. 
 
Goldbrook should focus on development drilling particularly within and around the currently 
outlined deposits of the Raglan Trend to help define additional tonnages and the geological 
configuration of these deposits. In particular, P&E recommends the following: 
 

•  In-fill drilling for the relatively higher grade Bravo Deposit in order to potentially convert 
Inferred Resources to Indicated; 

• Infill drilling for the Getty Deposit to potentially convert Inferred Resources to Indicated; 
• Infill drilling for the Mystery Deposit to potentially convert Inferred Resources to 

Indicated; 
• Increase data density for the Mystery, Timtu, Bravo and Sylvie Deposits by drilling 

 deposit extensions and better defining the interior configurations of the sulphide systems; 
• Complete additional and detailed mineralogical, geochemical and metallurgical work on 

the deposits; 
• Complete advanced metallurgical studies and research with the goal of improving 

metallurgical recovery rates; 
• Complete further regional studies and integrate Goldbrook and Jien Canada Mining 

geoscience data, such as 1:50 000-scale geological mapping, to assist in defining regional 
setting, periodicity of deposits and better identify geological ore controls.
