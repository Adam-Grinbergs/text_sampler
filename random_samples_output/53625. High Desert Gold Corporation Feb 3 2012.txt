1.0   SUMMARY 

The Gold Springs Project, located in western Iron County, Utah and eastern Lincoln 
County, Nevada and consists of 1,051 unpatented lode claims 13 patented lode claims and 
2 state of Utah leases covering approximately 15,537.7acres (6,287.88 ha). Gold 
mineralization is hosted by complex sheeted veins, breccias and stockwork vein systems 
that are laterally extensive and locally form resistant ledges and ribs that protrude up to 10 
metres above the surrounding ground surface.  The veins contain quartz, adularia, and 
bladed calcite with minor sulfides (<2%) and represent a low sulfidation, epithermal 
gold-silver vein systems.  Trace element geochemistry for As (arsenic) and Sb (antimony) 
show relatively low values similar to other quartz-adularia epithermal vein systems such as 
the K-2 deposit (>2,000,000 ounces gold) in Washington and the Midas deposit 
(>3,000,000 ounces gold ) in northern Nevada.  The Gold Springs project is a joint venture 
between High Desert Gold Corporation ("HDG" or "High Desert Gold") and Pilot Gold Inc. 
("PG" or "Pilot Gold") as a 60% interest HDG and 40% PG. 

High Desert Gold Corporation has completed rock chip sampling, preliminary mapping, soil 
sampling and a property-wide aero-magnetic and ZTEM geophysical survey. The 
combination of the geological and geophysical work has identified 18 target areas for gold 
mineralization located within the project area. Each of these targets include areas that 
exhibit a strong gold and silver signature and have the potential to represent targets that 
justify drill testing. Currently, HDG has completed drilling on the Jumbo (10 drill holes), 
Thor (3 drill holes), Gray Eagle (10 drill holes), Homestead (5 drill holes) and Midnight (2 
drill holes) targets. Previous work by other exploration companies completed drill holes on 
the Jumbo (18 drill holes) Etna (5 drill holes) and North Jennie (1 drill hole) targets. In each 
instance, the drilling demonstrated that gold mineralization is present in these areas. The 
combination of surface geochemical sampling and drilling results completed on the project 
to date, shows the potential for significant gold mineralization in the Gold Springs project 
area as narrow high-grade veins (>3.0 gpt gold) and areas of broad lower-grade 
mineralization (<1.0 gpt gold). HDG completed an initial inferred resource on the Jumbo 
target area that indicates an inferred estimate of 173,115 ounces of gold @ 0.57 gpt and 
3,880,745 ounces of silver @ 12.9 gpt for a total of 233,344 ounces gold equivalent at a 
grade of 0.77 gpt.  This inferred resource remains open along strike and at depth within the 
Jumbo target area.

The Gold Springs project area has a long history of gold exploration and production dating 
back to the 1870's. Early mining efforts between 1897 and 1942 focused on the high-grade 
veins mined by underground methods and did not pursue the substantial widths of lower 
grade gold mineralization hosted in the breccia and stockwork zones that are the targets 
for exploration on the property. Areas of bulk mineable gold mineralization are identified in 
the Jumbo target area over a strike length of 700 metres, within the total outcropping strike 
length of the Jumbo system, that extends more than 1,000 metres along strike.  This is an 
area that had previously been drill tested by Energex Resources, Inc ("Energex") (1988) 
and Astral Mining Corporation (2006) ("Astral").  HDG has focused its work to better define 
and expand the Jumbo mineralization on the property, in addition to developing a number 
of other potentially significant areas of gold mineralization throughout the current project 
area.

Additional detailed geological work is recommended for the Gold Springs property, which 
would focus on collecting geologic information from detailed mapping, geochemical 
sampling of rock chips and analyzing the geophysical data, followed by a rotary drill 
program. Any future drill programs should include standard and blank samples inserted into 
the drill samples submitted to the labs at a rate of no less than 5%. This work has the 
potential to develop the high-priority targets within the property and continue developing 
additional targets in preparation for future drilling.  It is estimated that this continuing 
exploration at the Gold Springs property will require an expenditure of approximately 
US$2,569,000.  A two-phase approach is recommended with an initial rotary drilling 
program in the Jumbo resource area followed by a second phase with drilling in other 
target areas that are developed by detailed geological work carried out during Phase I in 
the large property position controlled by High Desert Gold.

4.0   PROPERTY LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION 

4.1  PROPERTY LOCATION 

The Gold Springs property is located along the Nevada/Utah state lines approximately ninety kilometers 
west of Cedar City, Utah and thirty five kilometres east of Pioche, Nevada.  The primary target areas on 
the Property are approximately 15 kilometres north of Utah State Highway 56/ Nevada Route 25, as 
shown in Figure 1.1.  Cedar City is the nearest significant town to the Property with a population of 
approximately 29,000, and lies along Interstate I-15 which provides access between Las Vegas, Nevada 
and Salt Lake City, Utah, and is served by the Union Pacific railroad and an airport with regular daily 
service to Salt Lake City.  There is a long history of mining in Iron County, Utah dating back to the 1860's 
and Cedar City has the facilities to provide labor and services to support the exploration and mining 
activities on the Property.  Pioche, Nevada is located thirty five kilometers east of the Property with a 
population of approximately 2,000, and is the county seat of Lincoln County, Nevada.  

4.2  PROPERTY DESCRIPTION 

The HDG project area falls within several historic mining districts that include the Deer Lodge, Fay, and 
Eagle Valley district in Nevada and the Gold Springs District in Utah.  For the purposes of this report the 
entire area is collectively referred to as Gold Springs Mining District. The Gold Springs project area 
contains numerous historic mines which were active starting 1897 and several mines that continued 
producing gold intermittently until the early 1940's. 

The Gold Springs project consists of a joint venture (JV) between High Desert Gold (60%) and  Pilot Gold 
(40%) that includes 1,051 unpatented  lode claims covering approximately 14,956.6 acres (6,052.72 ha)  
on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in Utah and Nevada, and on Stock Raising Homestead 
Lands in Nevada where private surface rights are underlain by Federal mineral rights. The mineral rights 
located under the homestead lands were staked under a Notice of Intent to Locate filed with the BLM 
Nevada state office. All claims were located with the use of a global positioning system ("GPS") and tied to 
section corners and quarter-section corners physically located in the field.  In addition to the unpatented 
lode claims, the JV controls 13 patented claims through lease or purchase agreements, and 2 Utah Trust 
Land leases for a total of 15,537.7acres (6,287.88 ha) subject to the joint venture agreement. 

The JV was formed pursuant to an Option and Earn-in Agreement dated January 10, 2010 which called 
for HDG to expend $1 million in exploration and make payments to Pilot Gold ("PG") totaling $160,000. 
These obligations have been completed and the two companies have a 60% (HDG) and 40% (PG) 
interest in a newly incorporated company called Gold Springs LLC to which the claims, leases and 
purchase agreements comprising the Gold Springs project will be assigned. HDG is operator of the Gold 
Springs project.  

In addition to the federal unpatented lode claims which make up the bulk of the project there are three 
blocks of patented lode claims (13 claims in total) which have been acquired through leases or option 
agreements. These blocks are the Melville, Midnight, and the Talisman patents. These claim blocks 
represent an additional 201.78 acres (81.66 ha) which are part of the project and are shown in Figure 4.1. 
HDG has also completed leases on Utah Trust lands covering an additional 377.72 acres (152.86 ha) 
bringing the total land position to 15,537.7 acres (6,287.88 ha), as shown in Figure 4.1.

Map showing the Gold Springs property and the claims and leases held by Gold Springs LLC in Utah 

and Nevada 



Page 13 of 98 

The Melville and Midnight patented claim blocks are subject to a lease agreement dated March 19, 2010 
and provides for annual payments and a small retained Net Smelter Royalty (NSR). The Talisman patent 
is subject to an option agreement dated April 4, 2011 which calls for a series of payments in cash and 
HDG stock over a 4 year period to purchase a 100% interest in the property. 

Two of the claims that were part of the original JV land package, the Grandee 2 and Grandee 4 are subject 
to an underlying lease option to purchase agreement dated June 11, 2009. This agreement requires 
annual advanced royalty payments and is subject to a small NSR. It also allows for the purchase of a 
100% interest in the claims within the first 10 years of the agreement. 

All agreements are in good standing as of the date of this report. 

 

The following are the unpatented lode claims, patentented lode claims and state leases subject to 
the JV:

Pursuant to the Earn-in Agreement between HDG and Pilot Gold, Gold Springs LLC has been 
incorporated to hold registered title to all properties subject to the JV agreement. The title to all of the 
properties listed above is in the process of being transferred by Pilot Gold and HDG into Gold Springs 
LLC. 

The Author does not know of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, surface access, taxation, 
socio-economic, marketing or political issue that could materially affect the information contained in this 
Technical Report.  Annual payments to the BLM are required to maintain the claims in good standing. 

 

5.0   ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1  ACCESS 

Access to the property is from Cedar City, west along State Route 56, to a point just west of the town of 
Modena, Utah, and then north via maintained gravel roads approximately 15 kilometres to the Property.  
Access is also available via County maintained gravel roads east from Pioche, Nevada through Eagle 
Valley and Ursine, Nevada, as shown in Figure 1.1.  Road access within the Property is served by a 
network of good gravel and dirt roads and trails that were previously developed to serve the mining and 
ranching activities in the area 

5.2  CLIMATE 

Climate is typical for the southern Great Basin, with arid, relatively dry, cold winters with temperatures 
ranging from an average of 5oC in January to 9oC in February, and moderate summer temperatures that 
average 29.5oC in June to 33oC in July.  Rainfall falls relatively evenly throughout the year with slightly 
heavier periods during the summer monsoon season and from Pacific storm systems which generally last 



Page 20 of 98 

from July through early September and winter snow storms that occur between January and March.  
Average annual precipitation is 260 millimetres ("mm"), as recorded at nearby Modena, Utah, located 
approximately 20 km southeast of the Property. 

5.3  LOCAL RESOURCES 

The Gold Springs property is located approximately ninety kilometers west of Cedar City, Utah and thirty 
five kilometres east of Pioche, Nevada, and approximately 15 kilometres north of Utah State Highway 56/ 
Nevada Route 25, as shown in Figure 1.1.  Cedar City is the nearest significant town to the Property with 
a population of approximately 29,000. Cedar City lies along Interstate I-15 which provides access 
between Las Vegas, Nevada and Salt Lake City, Utah, and is served by the Union Pacific railroad and an 
airport with regular daily service to Salt Lake City.  Electric power lines and a spur of the Union Pacific 
railroad follow Utah State Highway 56, with the closest utility services at Modena, Utah.  There is a long 
history of mining in Iron County, Utah dating back to the 1860's and Cedar City has adequate facilities to 
provide labor and services to support the exploration and mining activities on the Property.  Pioche, 
Nevada is located thirty five kilometers east of the property, and is the County seat for Lincoln County, 
Nevada.  Pioche has a population of approximately 2,000 and lies along US Highway 93 that links 
Caliente and Ely, Nevada and provides services to the local ranching communities.    

5.4  INFRASTRUCTURE 

Currently there is little infrastructure developed at the Gold Springs property other than a series of gravel 
and dirt roads and trails, a few local springs, wells, and tanks for watering livestock.  However, power lines 
and a spur railroad line follow Utah State Highway 56 approximately 15 kilometres south of the Property.  
There has been adequate water available from springs and wells in the area to support the recent drilling 
operations at the project during 2010-2011 work seasons.  Cedar City is currently the closest source for 
an adequate labor force available for mining and development, transportation, and medical services. 

5.5  PHYSIOGRAPHY 

The Property has sufficient area in gently rolling topography and valleys available to accommodate 
potential development typical for an open-pit or underground mining operation.  At present exploration on 
the property remains at an early stage and no detailed studies have been conducted for a mine plan and 
layout, which would include the location of storage, waste disposal, and processing areas.

View from the Jumbo property looking South towards Etna Mine area. Note the bare slopes in the 

Utah State land section that are used for livestock grazing. 

The Gold Springs property is located between Gold Springs Wash and the Deer Lodge Canyon along the 
southeastern flank of the Mahogany Mountains that straddle the Utah/Nevada state line.  The project 
covers gently rolling to moderate topography that ranges in elevation from 1,950 m (,6400 feet) above sea 
level ("asl") at Newell Spring, to 2,337 m (7,668 feet) asl at Bull Mountain, and includes rolling hills and 
valleys as shown in Figure 1.2 and 5.1.  The topography is typical for the flanks of Basin and Range 
faulting, with colluvial cover blanketing the lower slopes of the fault-block range, which is subsequently 
being incised by more recent erosion.  The hills and slopes in the project area are covered by scrub 
juniper and Pinyon pine, with sage brush and grasses dominating the valleys where they support grazing 
for cattle and wild horses.  Locally, areas have been stripped of vegetation (as shown in Figure 5.1) to 
support livestock grazing, which is currently the primary economic use of the land.

6.0   HISTORY 
The area surrounding the Gold Springs project has a long history of gold mining and exploration activity 
dating back to the 1870's when gold was first discovered by "Old Man Pike" who found high-grade float 
while prospecting in the area but was unable to trace it to its source (Perry, 1976).  In 1896 gold was 
discovered in the nearby Stateline District in Utah, and this "rush" attracted prospectors to the Gold 
Springs area (Tschanz and Pompeyan, 1970), with the first locations in the district made in 1897 on the 
Jumbo and Wild Irish claim groups (Salt Lake Mining Review, 1903).  The Gold Springs district was 
formed shortly thereafter (Tingley, 1998; Doelling and Tooker, 1983).  Originally, the portion of the mining 
district located in Utah was called the Gold Springs District, and the portion located in Nevada was called 
the Eagle Valley district and the Fay district (Perry, 1976), the use of several names for these mining 
areas has contributed to some of the confusion with regards to crediting past production records to 
various mining districts (Perry, 1976).  Mining continued in the Gold Springs area until the 1940's with the 
historical production reported as being 9,300 ounces of gold up to 1942, however, it is certain that this 
figure is well below what was actually produced, because some reports have combined mine production 
from the Gold Springs and the nearby Stateline District in Utah and some of the individual mine production 
records exceed what has been reported for the district (Perry, 1976).  Historic exploration and 
development of the mines was often reported to have been restricted by the inability of operators to 
establish significant land positions and control the laterally extensive vein systems along strike length.  In 
addition, some of the veins are cut and offset by post-mineral faults and the extensions never located, 
such as at the Jennie Mine.  The largest producing mines in the district are the Horseshoe, Jennie, and 
Homestake mines for which individual production records are generally lacking and inconsistent.  
Historically, the gold ores are reported to have been mined from high-grade veins and stockworks that 
averaged >10 gpt gold across mining widths that locally exceeded 10 metres wide (Perry, 1976).  The 
ores typically had a low-sulfide content (<2%) and were treated in local mills which are reported to have 
recovered >80% of the gold by gravity separation and cyanide vat leaching methods (Short, 1909). 

In the 1960's-1970's, Ranchers Exploration, Inc. and others conducted drilling programs at the Horseshoe 
and Jumbo properties, with limited success in identifying significant gold resources there (Ranchers, 
1974).   In the early 1980's AMAX Exploration, Inc. looked at potential molybdenum mineralization in the 
nearby Stateline District in Utah (Candee, 1981), and there is evidence that FMC Exploration, Inc. may 
have also been interested in molybdenum mineralization in the Gold Springs caldera where they drilled 
several holes that target the rhyolitic breccias and rhyolite dome complex in the Bull Mountain area 
(Askey, 1985).

In 1981, Energex Minerals Ltd. initiated consolidation of a significant land position that included the Jumbo 
and Etna target areas, and in 1988 completed a 10-hole, 890 metre reverse circulation drilling program 
that focused on identifying bulk-mineable gold mineralization targets.  Some of the Energex Minerals 
drilling data reported mineralized drill intercepts in the Jumbo target grading 2.0 gpt gold across 24.4 
metres, and 14.5 gpt gold across 1.5 metres (Energex News Release, 9/1988).  Between 1986-1988, 
Energex completed 11 drill holes in the Thor area, however, this data was not available to the Author for 
review. During 1996-1998 Cambior Inc. ("Cambior"), acquired a large land position in the area and 
conducted a program of geological mapping, rock chip, and soil sampling.  Cambior collected and 
analyzed 662 rock chip samples across the project area, and 88 soil samples.  In 1998, the property was 
optioned to Phelps Dodge Exploration, Inc.  ("Phelps Dodge") who evaluated the property, and focused 
their efforts on gold mineralization hosted in the caldera environment, and in potential bulk tonnage 
targets in the Jumbo and Etna areas.  Phelps Dodge Exploration, Inc. allowed the claims to lapse in 2001.  
North American Gold Inc. re-staked and acquired claims in the area during 2002-2003, conducted 
geochemical sampling, and completed the drilling of six reverse circulation holes in the Jumbo and Etna 
target areas.  In 2004, Amanda Resources Corporation ("Amanda Resources") acquired the property from 
North American Gold Inc., and conducted exploration on a portion of the current property controlled by 
High Desert Gold.  The work conducted by Amanda Resources included geologic mapping and sampling 
in the Etna, Jumbo and Iris areas, and geophysical work consisting of magnetometer and Controlled 
Source Audio Magneto Tellurics (CSAMT) surveys on portions of the property conducted by Zonge 



Page 24 of 98 

Geosciences of Reno, Nevada.  In 2005 Amanda Resources changed its name to Astral Mining 
Corporation and filed a NI 43-101 report on their work to that date.  Astral completed a 10 hole reverse 
circulation drilling program in 2006 on the Jumbo, and North Jennie targets, and in 2009 Astral terminated 
their interest in the project due to a lack of funds. Summary of Previous Drilling 

In 1988, Energex M conducted a 10 hole RC drill program totaling 890 metres (2920 feet). Eight holes 
were completed in the Jumbo Zone (Grandee #2 and Grandee #4 claims) and two holes in the Etna 
Zone (Etna #1 and Etna #2 claims). The Energex data was not available for review by the Author, but the 
Technical Report of the gold Springs District (G. Smith 2005) stated that the data was available at that 
time to Astral Mining.  

 

The following is a comprehensive tabulation of the known drilling completed in the Gold Springs 
project area ;

In 2006, Astral completed 10 holes for a total of 1,756.6 metres of reverse-circulation drilling. Eight holes 
were located on the Jumbo target, one on the Etna and one on the North Jennie. The North Jennie hole 
was targeted on a CSAMT resistivity anomaly in an area of post mineral cover. The Astral drill logs were 
available for review and assays were compiled in electronic data bases. The drill program was completed 
by Harris Drilling out of Elko, Nevada.

7.0   GEOLOGIC SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 

7.1  REGIONAL OVERVIEW 

The project lies within the Indian Peak volcanic field, which is a broad Tertiary volcanic field that straddles 
the Utah-Nevada border and contains several collapsed calderas and resurgent dome features (Best, et 
al, 1989).   The volcanic field formed about 32 to 27 million years ago (Ma) in the southeastern Great 
Basin and consists of the Indian Peak caldera complex and the surrounding blanket of ash-flow tuff sheets 
that cover an area of approximately 55,000 square kilometers, and with an estimated volume of 
approximately 10,000 cubic kilometers of volcanic rocks. The caldera complex is located central to the 
volcanic field, and the volume of rock is dominated by ash-flow tuff units, with minor amounts of andesite 
and rhyolite flows that were extruded during the early stages and later in the life of the volcanic complex 
(Best et al, 1989). 

The oldest rocks in the region consist of Proterozoic through lower Mesozoic sedimentary sequence that 
became folded and thrust-faulted during the Cretaceous Sevier orogeny, and were subsequently overlain 
by Tertiary sedimentary deposits (Stewart, 1980).  Regional crustal extension during the middle Cenozoic 
resulted in crustal thinning, volcanic activity in the Indian Peak volcanic field, and subsequently the Basin 
and Range normal faulting and extension in the late Cenozoic.  The basin and range faulting overprints 
the Indian Peak caldera complex, and nearly half of the complex now lies beneath alluvium-filled basins or 
younger volcanic rocks (Best et al, 1989a). 

Andesite and latite flows occur during the early stages and late in the evolution of the volcanic complex.  
The early andesite flows are correlated with the Escalante Desert Formation, approximately 32 Ma (Best 
et al, 1989a), and are overlain by a series of rhyolitic to dacitic flows and tuffs associated with episodic 
eruptions from the caldera complex.  This stage of volcanic activity includes the development of collapse 
caldera features and resurgent domes and ash eruptions that were deposited over an extensive area 
(Best et al, 1992).  The Gold Springs caldera was formed during this period of activity, and is a prominent 
feature in the HDG project area. 

Following a hiatus of approximately 3 million years after final eruptions in the Indian Peak complex, the 
Caliente caldera complex began activity 40 km to the south as part of the continued southward migration 
of volcanism (Rowley and Sider, 1988; Best et al, 1989a).  During the Pliocene, local basins and lakes 
formed as a result of Basin and Range faulting and these features accumulated sediments and ash 
deposits that overlie the older volcanic rock units.  Uplift has continued into the Quaternary and many of 
the slopes are covered with a variable thickness of recent colluvial and alluvial deposits. 

Gold mineralization in the Gold Springs project is hosted by complex sheeted veins, breccias, and 
stockworks that are oriented along NE and NW-striking structural zones that cut andesite and latite flows 
adjacent to the collapsed margins of the Gold Springs caldera.  The veins typically form resistant ledges 
and ribs that protrude up to 10 metres above the surrounding ground surface and consist of quartz, 
adularia, and calcite with minor sulfides (<2%).  These vein systems are laterally extensive and can be 
traced for up to two kilometres along strike between exposures where the veins are not obscured by the 
Quaternary cover.  Numerous small mines and prospects, primarily exploiting high-grade gold and silver 
veins, are scattered throughout the volcanic field and have remained largely inactive since the 1940's 
(Perry, 1976; Thompson and Perry, 1976).

7.2  LOCAL GEOLOGIC SETTING 

The oldest rocks in the project area are Upper Cambrian light to dark gray limestone and dolomites that 
are correlated with the Mendha Formation (Tschanz and Pompeyan, 1970) these rock units have been 
mapped by Best et al (1992) to outcrop several kilometers northwest of the project area where they may 
represent a piece of basement rock along the margins of the caldera.  The following is a summary of the 
rock units in the Indian Peak volcanic complex, as they have been described and subdivided in the project 
area by Williams  et al (1997), and are shown in Figure 7.1 below. 

The Lund Formation (Oligocene) consists of at least several hundred metres of breccias and dacite 
ash-flow tuff that unconformably overlie the older pre-Tertiary rock units within the larger White Rock 
caldera (Best et al, 1992).   

The Ripgut Formation (Oligocene) is a crystal-poor, pumice-rich partially to densely welded rhyolite tuff 
that contains phenocrysts of feldspar and quartz that ranges from 200 to 650 metres thick and locally 
overlies lava flows of similar composition within and adjacent to the Mount Wilson caldera (Best et al, 
1992; Rice et al, 1992).

Page 32 of 98 

Andesitic lava flows (Oligocene) are prevalent in the project area (Tlf), and appear to be correlated with 
stratigraphically similar andesite and dacite flows further to the northeast (Best et al, 1989a).  The 
andesite flows are variable thicknesses, and incomplete sections are as much as 100 metres thick (Best 
et al, 1992).  The andesite flows are the primary host rock for the vein systems that are exposed in the 
Gold Springs project area. 

Isom Formation (Oligocene) consists of as many as three moderately to densely welded units of trachytic 
ash-flow tuff (Rowley et al, 1991).  An upper unit locally contains a black vitrophyre, several lower 
members have been identified that exhibit reddish cooling units and may be intercalated with tuffs from 
other sources (Best et al, 1989b).  

Leach Canyon Formation (Miocene or Oligocene) partially welded light colored rhyolitic ash-flow tuff 
containing 20% phenocrysts including quartz, feldspars, biotite, and hornblende (Williams, 1967).  The 
unit consists of two simple cooling units, the Upper Table Butte Member contains abundant lapilli and 
small pumice blocks, and the lower Narrows Member is almost devoid of lithic fragments.  This unit has a 
source in the Caliente caldera complex to the south, and does not outcrop in the project area, but has 
been mapped in nearby areas. 

Latite Lava Flows (Miocene) are a sequence of reddish-brown lava flows that contain sparse phenocrysts 
of plagioclase, biotite, and clinopyroxene (Tscl), probably as much as several hundred metres thick in the 
Deer Lodge Canyon (Best et al, 1992). 

Condor Canyon Formation (Miocene) consists of the Bauers Tuff Member and the underlying Swett Tuff 
Member, each is a simple cooling unit of densely welded rhyolite ash-flow tuff that contain less than 20% 
phenocrysts, and characterized by an upper devitrified portion containing lapilli and small blocks of 
pumice, and a lower black vitrophyre just above the base of the units (Best et al, 1992). 

Blawn Formation (Miocene) is an assemblage of siliceous rhyolite and trachyandesitic rocks of early 
Miocene age that have been subdivided into informal members of rhyolite tuffs (Tbg), rhyolite lava flows 
(Tsr), rhyolite intrusions (Tbi), breccias (Tbb), mafic lava flows, and minor epiclastic deposits (Tt).  The 
age for the rhyolite flows range from 24 to 18 Ma (Best et al, 1992).  These informal members are 
particularly useful in mapping and understanding the features such as caldera margins, domes, flows and 
epiclastic debris associated with this period of volcanic activity. 

Clastic Rocks (Miocene) are a heterogenous sequence of weakly consolidated pyroclastic, reworked 
pyroclastic, and epiclastic rocks that underlie the Steamboat Mountain Formation (Best et al, 1992).  This 
unit generally represents the erosional unconformity that occurred during the hiatus between these two 
volcanic episodes. 

Steamboat Mountain Formation (Miocene) is a bi-modal assemblage of high-silica rhyolite and basaltic 
trachyandesite of middle Miocene age (Best et al, 1987), in the project area a rhyolite flow unit (Rhyolite of 
Deer Lodge Canyon) is exposed as a dike that possibly was a feeder to the Steamboat Mountain 
Formation flows that occur further east of the project area. 

Lacustrine Deposits (Upper Miocene to Pliocene) consist of silt and fine sand sediments(Tal), that 
accumulated in a lake that occupied ancestral Eagle Valley, to the west of the project area.  These 
sediments are generally fine-grained and grade laterally and upwards into coarse sands and gravels, 
representing a transition from lacustrine to alluvial deposition as the basin filled and along its margins.  



Page 33 of 98 

Intercalated with the lacustrine sediments are at least two tephra units that have been identified, of which 
one bears similarity to the Point of Rocks tuff near Lathrop Wells in southwestern Nevada (Best et al, 
1992). 

Quaternary Deposits consist of a number of distinguishable and mappable units that represent tectonic 
episodes and subsequent erosion and deposition along the range front.  These include talus (hillslope 
debris trains), colluvial deposits (Tc), alluvial deposits adjacent to streams (Qal), floodplain deposits in the 
modern washes, and older benches and terraces associated with progressive downcutting of fan and 
pediment alluvium.  Perhaps the most important note here is that a majority of the project area is covered 
by Quaternary deposits of varying thickness.  Of particular interest is the presence of high-grade vein 
material as cobbles and boulders that occur in these deposits.  Many shafts and cuts were developed 
historically in the colluvium based on the presence of ore-grade material, and it is unclear how far this 
material has travelled from its source. 

Perhaps the most striking feature in the project area is the collapsed Gold Springs caldera, mapped by 
United States Geological Survey (the "USGS") (Best, et al, 1992), in the vicinity of Bull Mountain. This 
caldera is bound on the west and northwest by heterolithic breccias along a steeply-dipping contact with 
older andesite flows, and interior to the caldera is a resurgent rhyolite dome complex at Bull Mountain and 
intercalated tuffaceous sediments, tuffs, and flows.  In the Pope and Charlie Ross Mine areas, the tuffs 
appear to have breached the caldera margin and unconformably overlie the surrounding andesite flows, 
extending southward towards the Jennie Mine. 

7.3  LITHOLOGIC UNITS 

In general, the project area extends along the flanks of the Mahogany Mountains, and most of the area is 
covered by Quaternary colluvial deposits that are related to recent basin range faulting and erosion.  A 
majority of the areas where bedrock is exposed, show evidence of mineralization hosted predominantly by 
the andesitic lava flows (Oligocene) that are tentatively correlated with the Ripgut Formation, which also 
appear to be correlated with stratigraphically similar andesite and dacite flows further to the northeast by 
Best et al (1989a).  The andesites are a composite of many flows with a variable aggregate thickness of as 
much as 100 metres (Best et al, 1992), and there has been some attempt to identify individual flow units 
(Smith, 2005).  The andesite flows are the primary host rock for the vein systems that have been 
historically mined in the Gold Springs project area (Perry, 1976).  HDG is currently working to develop a 
better understanding of this important host rock unit, particularly where subdividing this package and 
identifying individual flows or units may have a bearing for preferentially hosting the high grade vein 
mineralization.

Figure 7.2: Map showing the project geology and structures 

 
Map showing the project geology and structures mapped in the Gold Springs area and some of the 

identified mineralized areas. 

A series of three moderately to densely welded units of trachytic ash-flow tuffs of the Isom Formation 
unconformably overlie the andesite flows (Rowley et al, 1991).  Remnants of an upper unit locally contains 
a black vitrophyre, and several lower members have been identified that exhibit reddish cooling units and 
may be intercalated with tuffs from other sources found to the east of the Jumbo mine area, and cap some 
of the higher ridges and hills in the project area.  

An assemblage of siliceous rhyolite and trachyandesitic rocks of early Miocene age, have been 
subdivided into informal members of rhyolite, tuffs, rhyolite lava flows, rhyolite intrusions, mafic lava flows, 
and minor epiclastic deposits correlated with the Blawn Formation, occur in the e Bull Mountain area, and 
extend southward to the Pope Mine area where they unconformably overlie the older andesite flows.  
These rocks are particularly useful in mapping and understanding the features that define the caldera 
margins, domes, flows and epiclastic debris associated with this period of volcanic activity, which range 
from 24 to 18 Ma (Best et al, 1992).  In the project area, the Gold Springs caldera is a prominent feature, 
and was identified by the USGS (Best, et al, 1992), in the vicinity of Bull Mountain. The caldera is partially 
defined on the west and northwest by outcrops of heterolithic breccias that locally form large ribs along the 
steeply-dipping contact with older andesite flows to the south and west caldera margin, and contain a 
resurgent rhyolite dome complex, and associated flows and intercalated tuffaceous sediments and tuffs 
surrounding the Bull Mountain area.  In the Pope and Charlie Ross Mine areas, the welded tuff units 



Page 35 of 98 

extend beyond the caldera margin and unconformably overlie the surrounding andesite flows, and extend 
southward towards the Jennie Mine.  It is unclear whether these flows and tuffs overlie and post-date 
mineralization, or if the vein systems crosscut these rock units. 

To the west of the Gray Eagle and Keno target areas, lacustrine deposits consisting of silt and fine sand 
sediments that accumulated in a lake that occupied ancestral Eagle Valley during the Miocene-Pliocene 
and unconformably overlie the mineralized andesites.  These sedimentary units grade laterally into 
coarser sediments, and are weakly consolidated, often indistinguishable from the younger Quaternary 
sediments.  Locally there are tephra and tuffaceous sedimentary units that are intercalated with the 
coarse sands and gravels, and some of these have been identified to be similar to the Point of Rocks tuff 
near Lathrop Wells in southwestern Nevada (Best et al, 1992). 

The USGS (Best et al, 1992) has identified a number of distinct mappable Quaternary deposits in the 
project area that represent a series of tectonic episodes and subsequent erosion and deposition along the 
range front.  These include talus (hillslope debris trains), colluvial deposits, alluvial deposits adjacent to 
streams, floodplain deposits in the modern washes, and older benches and terraces associated with 
progressive downcutting of fan and pediment alluvium.  A majority of the project area is covered beneath 
these Quaternary deposits which are of varying thickness, and it is interesting to note that the vast 
majority of areas where the bedrock andesites are exposed is where gold mineralization has been 
prospected and mined.  Of particular interest is the presence of high-grade vein material as cobbles and 
boulders that occur in some of the Quaternary deposits, historically, this is what initially attracted the first 
wave of prospecting in the 1870's, but the source for the ore material remained elusive to the early 
prospectors (Perry, 1976).  There are a number of shafts and open cuts throughout the project area that 
appear to have been developed in colluvium searching for the presence of ore-grade material.  In some 
cases, it appears that this material may not have travelled far from the source, and there is a possibility 
that these areas may be a relic of the large outcropping vein ribs, as seen in the Jumbo target area.

7.4  STRUCTURE 

The Gold Springs project area is located within the Basin and Range province and is characterized by N-S 
block faulting that produced internally draining basins and ranges that have developed since the early 
Pliocene (Best et al, 1992).  The original rock units in the Indian Peak volcanic field have been displaced 
by faulting, and a majority of the project area remains covered beneath younger Pliocene to Quaternary 
sediments and colluvium.   

The dominant mineralized structures in the Gold Springs project generally strike NW and dip 50 to 75 
degrees east along laterally continuous fault zones that cut the andesites, and are shown in Figure 7.2- 
above.  In addition there are subsidiary NE-striking veins systems such as in the Etna and Midnight areas, 
and some cases these NE striking zones contain a series of NW striking veins within them.  At the Jumbo, 
the veins system consists of a wide area of silicification, veining, and breccias, with some distinct 
orientation to some of the vein stages within the zone. This is an area where HDG is conducting more 
detailed analysis to determine if there are additional structural controls on the higher grade gold 
mineralization.  At many of the historic mines, it has been observed that only certain portions of the vein 
contain the high grade gold mineralization, historically, only the vein portions grading >0.2 oz/t gold were 
mined (Perry, 1976) and the remaining vein material was left behind.   



Page 37 of 98 

Post-mineral faults have been observed and reported by previous workers (mostly in inaccessible 
underground mine workings) that have displaced the mineralized veins and these faults generally strike E 
and NE.  Some workers have speculated that the N-S faults reflect basement structures in the pre-Tertiary 
rocks (Perry, 1976).  In the Jennie Mine, the main vein was cut off above the 300 foot level by a series of 
N-S faults dipping to the west, and a fault striking N80E, dipping 55o south displaced the Jennie vein to the 
north of the main shaft (Mallory, 1928).  The Jennie vein appears to have been displaced 45 metres to the 
east, and the extension has not been located, and is possibly covered by a crystal lithic tuff unit (Perry, 
1976).  The Thor vein is also cut off on the north and south by post-mineral faulting, the northern fault may 
be the same fault that offsets the Jennie vein.  In the Etna area, the vein has been noted to strike N80oW, 
and dips west consisting of a series of stringers and veins, it has been cut by a post-mineral fault that has 
displaced the vein and dips downward to the east. 

There are several areas where the N-S vein structures appear to intersect the margins of the Gold Springs 
caldera, in the vicinity of the Pope and Charlie Ross mines, these areas exhibit stockwork veining and 
pervasive alteration in the tuff units.  The Pope vein strikes N60-65oE, and is nearly vertical and cuts 
welded crystal tuffs, the Charlie Ross vein strikes N30oE and dips 72o south and is associated with argillic 
alteration and some quartz veining.   

7.5  MINERALIZATION 

Mineralization in the Gold Springs area is characterized by the dominant, generally north-striking faults 
and structures that are the primary control for the gold bearing quartz veins, with subsidiary northeast and 
northwest striking gold bearing veins also noted in the target areas.  Andesite flows are the primary host 
rocks to the gold-silver mineralization in the district and intercepted during drilling at the Jumbo, Thor, 
Midnight, Gray Eagle, and Homestead target areas conducted by HDG.  

In general, gold mineralization in the Gold Springs area consists of structurally controlled quartz veins, 
breccia, and stockwork veins. These types of mineralization are primarily hosted in andesite that occur 
about the margins of a collapsed caldera. Host rocks adjacent to the veins and stockwork zones are 
variably silicified, and exhibit sericitic, argillic and propylitic alteration in a general progression away from 
the vein. To a much lesser extent the mineralization occurs in the rhyolite ash-flow tuff that overlies the 
andesites, and here the veins are commonly narrow surrounded by stockworks, and exhibit broad areas 
of sericitic alteration associated with the presence of fluorite.  

Within the vein zones, quartz is generally coarse-grained crystalline and appears in crustiform, colloform 
banding, comb, and pseudomorphs of bladed carbonate forms. The quartz veins are generally white to 
light grey and greenish in colour. Multiple episodes of veining are evident from the replacement textures 
and the different varieties of vein material being cut by subsequent veins. 

Sulphides are uncommon in the veins, and generally constitue <1% of the veins, but when seen they 
occur as pyrite and lesser amounts of arsenopyrite. Gangue minerals include calcite (with occasional Fe 
and/or Mn carbonates), fluorite, and locally adundant amounts of adularia. The dominant orientation for 
veins in the District is north-northwest to north-northeast with variable steep dips to the east and west. 
The veins occur in a belt of mineralization that trends northwest to southeast. 



Page 38 of 98 

Gold grades are variable, ranging from less than detectable to 145,683 ppb (4.25 ounces per ton). Silver 
grades are also variable ranging from less than detectable to 4 4 2 . 7 ppm (12.93 ounces per ton). In 
general silver exhibits a positive correlation with gold values.  

During the 2011 geological work by HDG in the Jumbo target area, it was observed that some high-grade 
gold-silver drilling intercepts may be related to a high-angle west-northwest trending structures. The 
higher grade intercept in drill hole GS-06-01 (Astral Mining) appears to possibly be associated with a 
steep, west-northwest trending structure that has been mapped by HDG. Further work is needed to 
determine the significance of cross structures and their role in the higher gold grades within the Jumbo 
target.   

7.6  TARGET AREAS

7.6.A  JUMBO  ZONE 

The Jumbo Zone is located in the far east-central part of the Project area. HDG has completed 10 holes in 
the Jumbo zone, Astral completed 8 holes (2006), Amanda Resources completed 3 holes just south of the 
Jumbo resource area (2003), and Energex completed eight holes (1988). These form the basis of the 
resource presented in this report. The Jumbo Vein is comprised of a prominent vein system with 
north-south strike and a steep easterly dip. Within the vein system there is a massive vein that can exceed 
5 meters width: This is typically in the center of the vein system or zone and forms a distinct linear/planar 
pattern which contrasts with the somewhat braided appearance of the less prominent portions of the vein 
system. Much of this central vein is dense, fine-grained quartz which on close inspection can occasionally 
be seen to contain relict rounded breccia clasts, banding, and bladed texture. The distribution and form of 
the clasts indicate that they are derived from repeated hydrothermal brecciation and fluidization within the 
vein system.  

Locally, adjacent to the veins there are surrounding areas of quartz stockwork veining that grades inward 
to a vein breccia comprised of angular wall-rock fragments to 12+ cm in a quartz matrix. In some areas the 
breccia consists of angular silicified wall-rock clasts in a quartz matrix. The Jumbo vein exhibits bladed 
texture which suggests that boiling occurred within the hydrothermal system, and is typical for a low 
sulfidation epithermal system, as described below in section [9.0].  

Locally within the vein system, there are somewhat discontinuous zones of quartz veins, silicified 
wall-rock and quartz stockwork in both the foot-wall and hanging-wall of the central vein zone, which 
appears to form an enigmatic pattern like an "S" so that north of drill hole number GS-10-5 (HDG 2010 
drilling) silicification is observed on the west or foot-wall side of the central, dominant vein while south of 



Page 41 of 98 

that drill hole it is on the east or hanging-wall side. Within this southern, hanging-wall portion there are 
complex relationships with multiple short vein segments that give the appearance of a braided system to 
the structure. Near drill hole number GS-06-01 there are outcrops of "vein" in the hanging-wall that forms 
an arc of stockwork and breccia with quartz matrix, these appear to enclose short segments of 
northwesterly trending veins and this may prove to be structurally important in understanding possible loci 
for some of the higher-grade intercepts of gold-silver mineralization encountered in GS-06-01.  

Detailed mapping of portions of the Jumbo vein system suggests that there may be a significant, relatively 
late stage quartz deposition episode that may have formed the prominent large outcrops of quartz at the 
Jumbo vein system. This late stage of quartz appears to over-print and cement the earlier hydrothermal 
breccias and blade texture after calcite, with some minor traces of alunite. 

Wall-rock alteration is relatively restricted in the surrounding the Jumbo system, and typically extends only 
a few meters from the vein into the adjacent andesite wall-rock, which commonly appears to have a slight 
propylitic wash, with  sericitic alteration adjacent to the veins.  

7.6.B  THOR ZONE 

The Thor vein is in the SE1/4 of section 32, T1N, R71E and is approximately 180 meters east of the 
Jennie Vein. The Jennie was one of the districts largest producing mines with a reported grade of 0.4 oz/t 
over widths of 1.5 to 7 meters (Perry, 1976). The Thor vein is poorly exposed but can be traced for more 
than 300 meters on surface, and has been reported to be offset on the north and south by post-mineral 
faults (Perry, 1976). The Thor vein strikes northwest with a variable easterly dip, but also rolls over and 
dips to the west. The vein varies in width from 0.6 to 6 meters and consists of quarts, calcite, adularia, 
sometimes exhibiting distinct bands of high-grade mineralization which have been mined, and other 
mineralized bands that have been left behind as waste. Unlike the Jumbo, Gray Eagle and Homestead 
targets there is no significant wallrock mineralization observed surrounding the Thor vein structure. 
Samples of the vein mineralization exhibits banded quartz and adularia, sparse oxidized sulfide grains, 
visible gold grains, and rock samples that assay up to 23.35 gpt Au and 252.9 gpt Ag. A rock chip sample 
collected by the Author across a 2 meter section of the Thor vein left behind by early mining, assayed 3.28 
gpt gold (sample KK-11-39), and the location is shown in Figure 7.5.  The mapping and detailed rock chip 
sampling conducted by HDG demonstrates that there are at least 3 narrow (0.2-1.0 meter) parallel veins 
located in the footwall for the Thor vein.

Figure 7.5: Vein exposed in caved stopes at the Thor mine, Author's sample KK-11-39  

 

Vein exposed in caved stopes at the Thor Mine, assays 3.1 gpt gold across the 2 meters face shown 
above. 

HDG completed a total of three drill holes in the Thor target area during 2011. One core hole was drilled to 
intersect the vein in an area of historic work, and contained several intercepts with values >3 gpt gold.  
Two additional reverse circulation drill holes were completed approximately 100 meters south of the core 
drill hole.  Each of these drill holes intersected vein material and contained significant gold values as 
shown in Table 10-5 below.  

7.6.C  GRAY EAGLE 

The Gray Eagle target is characterized by a complex zone of intersecting veins trending north-south, 
northeast and northwest. The veins form a mineralized corridor ranging from 20 to over 75 meters in width 
which is traceable on surface for over 700 meters before being obscured by post-mineral cover. The 
individual veins and vein zones are characterized by white quartz, crustiform, colloform banding, comb, 
and pseudomorphs of bladed calcite forms. Calcite and fluorite have been observed both in outcrop and in 
drill samples. Areas of both stockwork and sheeted veining are present in both the hanging wall and 
footwall to the dominant veins. Breccia cemented by silica is often noted in close proximity to the 



Page 43 of 98 

structures.  Several shafts and tunnels from historic mining operations are located within the mineralized 
corridor, but are inaccessible at this time.  

While rock chip sampling has been limited across this broad area of mineralization, rock chip samples of 
up to 13.85 gpt gold and 35.3 gpt silver have been collected, and HDG completed 10 RC holes within the 
Gray Eagle area, two of which were re-drilled due to lost holes. The drill holes were located to test 
structural intersections and to cut the predominant vein trends. The southern extension of the zone has 
yet to be drilled and displays a wide sheeted vein zone up to 80 meters wide displaying abundant textures 
of colloform banding, comb, and pseudomorphs of bladed calcite forms.

7.6.D  HOMESTEAD TARGET 

The Homestead target is located in the northwest portion of the property on patented lands under lease by 
HDG. This target is dominated by a 3 meter wide north-south trending vein and an intersecting 5 meter 
wide N350E vein. In addition there is a wide zone of up to 100 meters of sheeted northeast trending veins 
exposed in an old road cut. This zone can be traced along strike to where it is obscured by post mineral 
volcanic rocks and colluvium. There are several shafts located within this zone, however, there is no 
recorded historic production.  

HDG has conducted limited rock chip sampling in the Homestead area but results include values up to 
8.169 gpt Au and 8.9 gpt Ag. A total of 5 RC holes were drilled by HDG in 2011 with 2 of the holes being 
re-drilled due to lost holes during the drilling, possibly where they intersected un anticipated underground 
workings.

7.6.E  MIDNIGHT TARGET 

The Midnight target area is located in the southern portion of the property. The target is covered by 
patented claims controlled by HDG. One of the largest shafts found within the project area is located on 
the Midnight vein system. In the 1990 these patented claims were leased to a group that initiated 
excavation of a production size adit in the area of the shaft but never progressed beyond a depth of 20 
meters. There are numerous cuts across the adjacent hillside areas that explore several smaller veins and 
stockwork zones within this vein system.  HDG has conducted surface rock chip sampling in the Midnight 
area that indicates a potentially wide area of gold mineralization associated with north-south trending 
veins, sheeted veins and stockwork zones in this target area. The rock sampling results include numerous 
samples of +0.1 gpt Au with values up to 1.83 gpt Au and 8.3 gpt Ag. In 2010 HDG completed 2 RC holes 
on the Midnight target, the results were encouraging, however, problems with the drilling included one 
hole that passed through 2 unanticipated open stopes in the underground workings.

7.6.F  NORTH JENNIE TARGET 

Astral completed one hole on the North Jennie target which is reported in their data. Astral defined this 
target based on interpretations of the CSAMT survey conducted by Zonge Geoscience and the target is 
located beneath a thick cover of Quaternary gravels at the drill collar.  Astral's drill hole demonstrated that 
gold mineralization is present along the northern projection of the Jennie vein system. This projection 
corresponds to the resistivity anomaly shown in the CSAMT survey data.   

7.6.G  NORTH JUMBO TARGET 

The North Jumbo target is defined as the extension of the Jumbo zone based on both the ZTEM work by 
HDG and the CSAMT survey conducted by Astral. Limited sampling by HDG has produced gold results of 
up to 1.51 gpt from rock chip sampling. 

7.6.H  ETNA ZONE 

HDG has not conducted any work on the Etna target but past operators have done extensive sampling 
and have completed 6 RC drill holes.  The Etna Zone is located in the south-eastern portion of the Gold 
Springs Project. Mineralization at the Etna occurs primarily as quartz stockwork in brecciated andesite 
that forms a prominent ridge that extends from Newells Spring, on the south, for 1500 metres to the north.  
Vein mineralization dips consistently 60 degrees to the west.  The outcropping width of the Etna zone 
varies from 30-75 metres (100-250 feet) with the greatest widths generally to the north (the area near the 
shaft). The silicified andesite locally forms large cliff outcrops along the eastern side of the ridge, primarily 
where the structure terminates against a footwall country rock, which has eroded away. 

In the Etna target, hanging-wall mineralization occurs primarily as quartz healed breccia that grades west 
into quartz stockwork mineralization. Individual quartz veins are normally less than 0.6 metres (2 feet) 
thick, unlike other areas in the District where quartz veins dominate the terrain.  Alteration consists 
of silicification occurring in variable amounts and recemented breccias and stockwork zones that grade 
into variably argillized andesite in the hanging wall of the vein system. 



Page 46 of 98 

Figure 7.8: View of stockwork veining in the Etna system 

 

The Etna Mine is located on the northern end of the mineralized zone as shown in Figure 5.1. An inclined 
shaft accessed the mine workings in which several hundred feet of workings were driven on the 100 foot 
level (Perry, 1976).  HDG has a database of rock chip sampling from Astral Mining and Cambior.  This 
data shows that numerous samples contain greater than 100 ppb gold with a high of 27.9 ppm have been 
collected along the Etna vein system.   ZTEM results suggest that the Etna and Jumbo zones are portions 
of a larger resistivity anomaly that extends for 10 kilometers in a north-south direction. HDG currently has 
approval from the BLM for 5 drill locations on the Etna target. These holes are designed to follow-up the 
results of two drill holes completed by Energex that intersected long intervals of gold and silver 
mineralization during their work in 1988.  One of these drill holes is reported to have contained an 
intercept of 91.44 meters averaging 0.5 gpt Au including 24.4 meters at 1.46 gpt Au (Smith, 2005). 

7.6.I  FLUORITE TARGET 

Bull Hill is the historic name for the prominent hill to the north of the Pope Mine, as shown in Figure 7.10.  
Bull Hill is a resurgent rhyolite dome within the Gold Springs caldera, and is surrounded by intercalated 
flows and tuffaceous sediments and tuffs that accumulated within the caldera moat (Best, 1992).  Locally, 
the rocks exhibit opaline silicification, which may represent the near-surface expression of an epithermal 
system as described by Hedenquist (2000) and shown schematically in Figure 8.1.  Mineralization at the 
Fluorite target area is unsual, and consists of a vertical shaft (Figure 7.9) and a lower adit that explore a 
fluorite-bearing pipe that cuts the rhyolite and tuffs  surrounded by a broad area of phyllic alteration.  The 



Page 47 of 98 

"vein" structure is reported to trend N 20o E, and averages 0.7-1.0 meter wide, mineralization consists of 
purple and green fluorite, crustiform lattice quartz, and red earthy hematite.  The hematite will produce a 
nice tail of gold when panned, and samples taken of the fluorite have resulted in assays of up to 8.2 gpt 
gold, as shown in Figure 9.2.  Additional geological work is required to better understand the gold 
mineralization in the Fluorite area, as it appears to be directly associated with the caldera complex and is 
a distinctly separate style of mineralization than the vein systems observed elsewhere in the district, 
possibly a later stage of gold mineralization.

7.6.J  SILICA HILL/SILICA HILL EXTENSION 

These areas are located to the west of the Thor vein extending to the north and south. There are 
numerous small pits and trenches which are located on narrow- high-grade veins. The area is covered by 
broad areas of colluvium which displays vein fragments along the projections of the outcropping veins 
suggesting the material is locally derived. These targets contain veins displaying visible gold with assays 
reaching highs of 126.326 gpt gold. The Silica Hill and Silica Hill Extension are a N20oW trending zone 
that is 1600 meters in length displaying widths of up to 300 meters in which these narrow high-grade veins 
are found. The projection of these targets extend to both the north and south trends under post mineral 
cover. Veins within the corridor generally exhibit orientations of N35oE, N30oW and N10oW all of which 
contain gold mineralization. 

7.6.K  CAMP BELL/LOST WORLD 

Camp Bell and Lost World represent developing targets on the Gold Springs project. Reconnaissance 
prospecting at Gold Springs has focused primarily on areas of colluvial cover south and west of the 2010 
claim block following anomalies identified by the ZTEM data.  These targets are characterized by linear 
traces of vein material as float containing high grade gold mineralization hosted in these vein fragments. 
The fragments range in size from 0.2 meters to 1 meter across and consist of quartz, calcite, adularia, with 
bladed quartz and adularia textures formed after calcite. The linear zones of mineralized vein float follow 
the predominant orientation of the major veins within the district.  Considering the large ribs that form in 
some of the vein systems, such as the Jumbo, one hypothesis is that the source of these float trains may 
be locally derived and represent residual traces of these structures.  Assays as high as 145.68 gpt gold 
and 148.2 gpt silver have been generated from samples of the float material and gold grades of > 3 gpt 
gold are not uncommon.  Continued exploration of this type of target will require either trenching or drilling 
to determine the presence of subsurface mineralization. 

7.6.L  CHARLIE ROSS 

This target is similar to the Pope in that it is hosted within tuffs along the margin of the caldera. This area 
has not received any detailed work by HDG but initial investigations reveal occasional narrow veins in a 
broad area of sericite and clay alteration. Samples of altered and hematite stained tuff have returned gold 
values as high as 1.3 gpt. 

7.6.M  POPE TARGET 

The Pope Mine area is located in the central part of the current Gold Springs Project and differs from the 
other targets described above, and may be unique in the style of gold mineralization described in the 
district.  The Pope target consists of numerous narrow sheeted quartz veins and clay seams which cut 
welded tuffs associated with the resurgent rhyolitic dome in the Gold Springs caldera.  These veins 
generally strikes east-west and are surrounded by a broad area of ser ic i t ic al terat ion, and 
narrow veinlets and stockwork of quartz-adularia veins that individual ly can assay as high as 19.06 
gpt gold and 70 gpt silver.  Rock chip samples reported by Cambior in 1997 indicated that anomalous gold 
values of up to 0.57 gpt were obtained from the silicified tuff unit (Katsura, 1997). 



Page 49 of 98 

Figure 7.10: View from the Pope mine looking towards Bull Hill 

 

7.6.N  TIN CAN 

This area is located north of the historic Little Buck mine and is characterized by a wide area of strong 
sericitic alteration with pyrite casts. There are a few historic pits with abundant vein float covering the 
hillside. HDG has done little work on this target but the CSAMT survey conducted by Astral shows this 
area to be underlain by a resistivity anomaly. 

7.6.O  HORSESHOE EXTENSION 

The historic Horseshoe mine was one of the largest producers in the historic Fay District. The northern 
projection of this north-south structural vein system extends into an area of extensive colluvial cover. This 
area contains numerous shafts which were collared in the colluvium and display gold bearing vein 
fragments on the dumps. There are rare outcrops of andesite which generally display stockwork veining 
that have returned values of up to 4.0 gpt Au from rock chip samples collected across over 1 metre 
intervals.   

7.6.P  IRIS 

The Iris zone is located in the north-western corner of the Gold Springs Project. The vein strikes N5oE 
and rolls steeply to the east and to the west. The vein can be traced on the ground for over 600 metres 



Page 50 of 98 

(2000 feet) prior to going under post-mineral cover.  The Iris mine produced high-grade gold from 
unknown widths. Samples from old ore piles return gold grades of 5.4 gpt. Of significance is that the area 
is characterized by wide zones of small and multiple parallel veins that cut the andesites in both the 
footwall and hanging wall of the main vein. 

7.6.Q  KENO 

The Keno target is along the southern projection of the Gray Eagle zone. Two of the largest adits in the 
target area are located on this vein. The workings are not accessible and no mapping has been done 
outside of demonstrating that the Keno vein is continuous with the Gray Eagle and represents a 
north-south mineralized zone of over one kilometer in length. 

7.6.R  STATE SECTION 

HDG controls portions of the Utah Trust Lands in section 36, T20W, R33S. These lands are on the 
southern projection of the Jumbo zone and along a strong ZTEM resistivity anomaly. There are numerous 
small pits located on these lands with wide areas of clay+/- sericite alteration. Little work has been 
conducted on this target thus far other than a cursory geologic review and geophysical surveys.  

8.0   DEPOSIT TYPES 
Gold mineralization on the Gold Springs project is characterized by structurally controlled vein and 
stockwork systems that are laterally extensive over a strike length of several kilometers. The veins exhibit 
quartz, adularia and low sulfide contents that are typical of a deposit type referred to as "low-sulfidation 
epithermal deposits" (Brommecker, et al, 2007).   Examples of this deposit type include Hishikari, Japan 
(Etoh et al, 2002), the Republic district, Washington, and Midas, Nevada (Leavitt et al, 2004).  These 
systems have been correlated with fossil hot springs, and the hydrothermal systems that underlie them, 
that developed in response to alkalic and silicic volcanic activity, commonly in a caldera setting 
(Brommecker et al, 2007).  One of the characteristics that help classify the Gold Springs systems as a 
"low-sulfidation epithermal deposit" are the observed textures of quartz, adularia, and calcite in the vein 
deposits and would be tentatively correlative with the "vein ore" shown in Figure 8.2 below.  The 
mineralization observed in the Bull Hill and Pope Mine areas may correspond to some of the upper levels 
of a hot springs system, as shown in Figure 7.10, or may be a part of a completely different style of gold 
mineralization.  Ongoing detailed geologic work by HDG is focusing on a better understanding of the 
mineralization in these target areas.

Figure 8.1: Schematic cross section showing components in a low sulfidation epithermal system 

 
Schematic cross section showing components in a low sulfidation epithermal system, after 

Hedenquist et al, 2000. 

 

Several well documented "low sulfidation" epithermal gold systems include the El Penon deposit in Chile, 
where structurally controlled veins containing quartz, adularia, cut felsic volcanic units and are associated 
with waning rhyolitic volcanic activity (Robbins, 2000).   Silicification extends outward from the veins into 
the country rock, with sericitic alteration haloes.  The precious metal-bearing veins exhibit stockworks, 
breccias, banded texture, comb quartz, and bladed texture in quartz that replaces carbonates (Robbins, 
2000).  The Midas deposit in Nevada is another low sulfidation epithermal deposit that is structurally 
controlled near the margins of a volcanic complex, and is known for very high-grade gold ores hosted by 
veins (Leavitt, et al, 2004). 

Low sulfidation epithermal gold deposits commonly exhibit a vertical zoning for precious metals that 
correspond to the levels of boiling that occurred within the hydrothermal system.  Episodic sealing and 
explosive activity formed the breccias and stockworks commonly observed in the structures, and the 
concurrent rapid pressure changes resulted in the precipitation of carbonates, and in many cases the 
subsequent resorption and replacement of the carbonates by quartz that result in a lattice-texture and 
bladed texture where quartz replaces calcite (Simmons and Christenson, 1994).  These textures are 
noted as an important feature and observation in the mineralized zones of low sulfide systems because it 
records the rapid changes associated with the boiling zone and is associated with the precipitation of gold 



Page 52 of 98 

(Etoh et al, 2002).  Low sulfidation epithermal systems are noted for distinct vertical zoning of ore horizons 
that correspond to the boiling level in the system (Etoh et al, 2002, and have been reported to range 
generally from <300 m to almost 1km vertically (Brommecker et al, 2007).  This vertical zoning of precious 
metal mineralization has also been documented in systems such as Midas, Nevada (Leavitt et al, 2000). 

Figure 8.2: Bladed texture and banding in quartz vein sample from the Jumbo system 

 

The alteration associated with low sulfidation epithermal systems commonly exhibit silicification proximal 
to the veins and stockworks, illite alteration, and distal propylitic alteration in the country rocks, with some 
vertical zonation of clay minerals that have been noted ranging from higher temperature (deeper) illite to 
low temperature (shallow) kaolinite in the wall rock alteration assemblage (Simmons et al, 2005).  Low 
sulfidation epithermal systems associated with alkalic volcanism may exhibit V-rich mica and abundant 
carbonate minerals in the alteration surrounding the veins (Jensen and Barton, 2000).  In some examples, 
massive opaline silica and siliceous sinter can form, and generally indicate a very shallow level in the 
system that corresponds to where the paleowater table intersected surface topography (Simmons et al, 
2005). 

In the Gold Springs project area, gold mineralization is typically hosted by andesites, and is also 
associated with the rhyolitic volcanism (caldera formation). The vein systems exhibit silicification adjacent 
to the structures, sericitic alteration, and distal propylitic alteration in the andesites.  In the Bull Hill and 
Pope Mine areas, mineralization is hosted by rhyolitic flows and tuffs, and alteration appears to have a 
different character, dominated by sericitic alteration with fluorite and carbonate.

9.0   EXPLORATION 
HDG has completed rock chip sampling, preliminary mapping, soil sampling and a property wide 
aero-magnetic and ZTEM geophysical survey. This work has resulted in the definition of 18 targets 
located within lands controlled by the HDG/Pilot Gold JV. All targets have a strong gold and silver 
signature and all potentially represent targets worthy of drill testing. 

It is also reasonable to assume that some of the targets will merge into larger targets as suggested by the 
ZTEM geophysical results. These results have demonstrated that there exist long (6 to 8 km) north-south 
oriented zones of high resistivity along which a number of targets are located. Long portions of these 
resistivity anomalies occur in areas of thin colluvial cover which will require trenching or drilling to further 
understand. 

The following is a description of the specific sampling techniques employed by High Desert Gold during 
the 2010-2011 during their tenure in exploring the project.   

9.1  ROCK CHIP 

Rock chip samples were collected by HDG geologists and described in the field and located by hand held 
GPS units. These samples were designed to define mineral distribution within the vein systems and wall 
rocks. The majority of the samples were collected on a reconnaissance basis from both outcrop and float 
material. These samples were designed to determine areas of mineralization and locate gold occurrences 
both within the project area. The reconnaissance sampling lead to the locating and filing of additional 
claims by HDG to cover areas of mineralization identified through the rock chip samples.  

Sampling was also conducted within the target areas where outcropping mineralization was sampled 
perpendicular to structural trends where possible. Grab samples were collected to help define background 
geochemical levels within the various rock units and to evaluate metallic ion distribution and chemical 
zonation in areas of new exploration.  Select samples were also collected from mine dumps and vein 
exposures to determine if there were any specific geochemical signatures and to characterize the ability of 
the system to contain high-grade gold values.  This type of first pass sampling is typical in early stage 
exploration projects, and provides a good overall representation of the mineralization present to develop 
more focused targets for follow-up investigations.   

The geologic mapping, geochemical sampling and geophysical surveys conducted by HDG identified the 
numerous additional targets and lead to the expansion of the claim block at the end of the 2011 field 
season.  Mineralization occurs along high angle quartz veins and within the surrounding andesite as 
stockwork zones and disseminated mineralization.  Rock chip sampling has identified 18 target areas 
within the claim block. All areas have produced samples containing high-grade gold and silver 
mineralization and all require additional detailed geologic work and drilling to fully evaluate the mineral 
potential.

9.2  GEOPHYSICS 
9.2.A    Z-TEM 

High Desert Gold also completed a 470 line-km ZTEM and aeromagnetic helicopter survey. Previous 
ground CSAMT surveys revealed a positive correlation between the known epithermal gold systems and 
buried, subvertically-dipping resistivity high features. The ZTEM results correlated very well with CSAMT 
results and known geology, in particular the presence of all the known epithermal centers. This work 
indicated numerous additional targets in the project area which were later covered by additional federal 
lode claims.  

Figure 9.1: Helicopter conducting ZTEM survey for HDG during 2011 

  

During April 27–30, 2011 Geotech Ltd. carried out a helicopter-borne geophysical survey for High Desert 
Gold Corporation over the Gold Springs project The principal geophysical sensors included a Z-Axis 
Tipper electromagnetic (ZTEM) system, and a caesium magnetometer. Ancillary equipment included a 
GPS navigation system and a radar altimeter. A total of 470 line-kilometres of geophysical data were 
acquired during the survey. 



Page 55 of 98 

The survey operations were based out of the town of Pioche, Nevada. In-field data quality assurance and 
preliminary processing were carried out on a daily basis during the acquisition phase. Preliminary and 
final data processing, including generation of final digital data and map products were undertaken from 
the office of Geotech Ltd. in Aurora, Ontario. 

The processed survey results were presented as the following maps: 

• 3D view of In-Phase Total Divergence versus Skin Depth (30-720Hz) 

• Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) 

• Digital Elevation Model (DEM) 

• Reduced to Pole (RTP) of Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI) 

• First Vertical Derivative of RTP 

• Second Vertical Derivative of RTP 

• 30Hz In-Phase Total Divergence Grid 

• 90Hz In-Phase Total Divergence Grid 

• 360Hz In-Phase Total Divergence Grid 

• Tzx (In-line) In-Phase Profiles over 90Hz Phase Rotated In-Phase Grid 

• Tzx (In-line) Quadrature Profiles over a 90Hz Phase Rotated Quadrature Grid. 

• Tzy(Cross-line) In-Phase Profiles over 90Hz Phase Rotated In-Phase Grid 

• Tzy (Cross-line) Quadrature Profiles over a 90Hz Phase Rotated Quadrature Grid. 

In addition to above, Geotech was contracted to complete 2D inversion processing of the ZTEM data and 
more detailed processing of the magnetics including the development of first and second derivatives of 
the RTP. 

The survey was flown in an east to west (N 90° E azimuth) direction, with a flight line spacing of 200 
metres. Tie lines were flown in a north to south (N 0° E azimuth) direction, with a flight line spacing of 1900 
metres.  

DT (Total Divergence) imaging, analogous to the VLF Peaker parameter of Pedersen (1998), converts the 
ZTEM tipper cross-over data into peak-responses which assists their interpretation in plan. DT lows 
(conductive) areas signify areas with sulphides or possibly conductive clays and the DT highs (resistive) 
areas, represent resistive rocks which show an excellent correlation with known gold occurrences as 
would be expected in the low sulphidation environment. This correlation of resistive rocks and gold 
mineralization can also be demonstrated in the prior ground CSAMT. 



Page 56 of 98 

Some of the resistive features come to the surface such as at the Jumbo where a strongly silicified 
structural zone including breccias is exposed, or the Fluorite prospect where rhyolitic intrusives and tuffs 
are exposed. In both cases, strong gold mineralization is known from surface rock sampling or have been 
tested by drill holes in these areas. 

Presently surface follow up of the resistive features is underway. In the case of the Jumbo Zone it can be 
seen to extend in the subsurface for several kilometres to the North of the area drilled to date and in the 
southern portion of the property this same feature can be seen to extend several kilometres to the south. 
It is thought that these extensions have an excellent potential for discovery of further gold mineralization.  
HDG is currently working with the geophysical data to help define targets and extensions of known gold 
mineralization where they may extend under the colluvial cover or be offset by fault structure. 

9.3.A  GEOCHEMICAL SAMPLING 

Significant gold anomalies have been generated through rock chip and soil sampling. High gold values are 
variably correlated with silver and arsenic. Other trace elements, such as antimony and mercury, and the 
base metals of copper, lead, and zinc generally occur in too small amounts to be a significant 
exploration tool. 

Figure 9.2: Hand samples of fluorite veining from Bull Hill 

 

During the 2010 and 2011 field seasons High Desert Gold collected 822 rock chip samples, 869 soil 
samples and 145 stream sediment samples from the project. Rock chip results ranged from <5 ppb gold to 



Page 57 of 98 

a high of 145.68 gpt gold with 123 samples greater than 1.0 gpt Au. Silver shows some correlation with 
gold and values ranged from <0.1 ppm to a high of 252.9 ppm. Gold geochemistry from the soil samples 
ranged from <0.5 ppb to a high of 1.3 gpt while silver ranges from <0.1 ppm to 11.6 ppm. Results from the 
stream sediment sampling show a variation in gold values from a low of <5 ppb to a high of 1.28 gpt. 

10.0   DRILLING 
Thus far HDG has completed drilling on the Jumbo (10 holes), Thor (3 holes), Gray Eagle (10 holes), 
Homestead (5 holes) and Midnight (2 holes) targets. Previous companies completed holes on the Etna (6 
holes) and North Jennie (1 hole) targets. In all cases the holes intersected gold mineralization. Results 
include both narrow high-grade intercepts and long intervals of lower-grade mineralization. HDG has now 
completed an initial inferred resource on the Jumbo target resulting in an estimate of 173,115 ounces of 
gold @ 0.57 gpt and 3,880,745 ounces of silver @ 12.9 gpt for a total of 233,344 ounces gold equivalent 
at a grade of 0.77 gpt.  This inferred resource is open along strike and at depth.  

With this initial resource calculated on one of the target areas and having similar geologic settings on 
numerous other targets the project is developing into a district scale exploration program. There is a 
additional significant work needed to understand and prioritize all of the remaining targets and to continue 
to develop resources. Drill results from the HDG programs and from previous operators supports the 
expectations that some of the targets will produce positive drill results with continued work. 

10.1  ROTARY DRILLING AND SAMPLING 

In 2010 HDG completed a total of 11 reverse-circulation drill holes for a total 1,822.7 meters. Nine holes 
were located within the Jumbo system and two were located on the Midnight target. Holes located on the 
Jumbo target were designed to confirm past drilling and to infill areas between past drill holes.

In 2011 a total of 17 reverse-circulation holes totaling 1,631.9 meters and two core holes totaling 280.7 
meters were completed by HDG.  The 2011 drill program provided for the first drill testing of the Gray 
Eagle (10 RC holes) and the Homestead targets (5 RC holes). Three holes (2 RC holes and 1 core hole) 
were also completed on the Thor target in the general area where Energex reported completing several 
holes (data not available). One core hole was drilled on the Jumbo target as a twin of HDG hole J-10-04. 
The holes were logged by L. Campbell and R. Moore and the program was completed under the direction 
of Randall Moore a qualified person. 

Each Drill Log includes details for the following categories:  Project, Name, Hole ID, Location UTM 
Northing and Easting, Elevation, Bearing, Dip, Total  Length,  Logged  by,  Date,  Contractor,  and Date. 
The main portion of the drill logs provides details for the following categories: Sample number, footage 
interval, description of lithology, alteration and mineralization, and a numeric classification for identifying 
the abundance of  oxidizes, pyrite, silicification, adularia, sericite, clay, chlorite, veins, stockwork, veinlets, 
and faults.

10.2  DIAMOND DRILLING AND SAMPLING 

HDG completed 2 core holes in 2011. The holes were drilled by West-Core Drilling and they provided 
HDG with oriented core in order to evaluate the relationship between vein orientation and gold grades. 
The core was oriented by use of a top mark provided by the drill crews. Core was collected in a split tube 
to reduce breakage and to provide the drillers the ability to remove the core without rotation.   

One core was drilled on the Thor target and a second hole was drilled as a twin to hole J-10-04 on the 
Jumbo target with the purpose of testing variations in grad between the two drilling methods.

10.3  RC DRILLING 

The 2010 drilling program was performed by Diversified Drilling and was done by wet reverse-circulation. 
Material coming out of the hole passed through a wet rotary splitter producing 2 samples of equal size. 
The samples were collected on 5 foot intervals and handled by HDG employees at all times. A geologist 
was at the drill site at all times during drilling. The geologist collected a small sample coming from the 
rotary splitter and placed it into chip trays labeled by hole number and footage. Samples were numbered 
with one split being designated as a duplicate sample. Duplicate samples were stored on site until the end 
of the drill program when they were transported to a locked storage facility in Cedar City, Utah. Samples 
for analysis were transported on a daily basis to a secured area behind locked gates with access secured 
and under the supervision of a Qualified Person. Drill samples were transported from the site to the 
Inspectorate Laboratory facility in Sparks, Nevada by HDG employees every 3 to 4 days and were 
delivered directly to laboratory personnel.  

The 2011 RC drill program was conducted by Drift Drilling and was done without injecting water. Material 
from the hole was passed through a Jones style splitter and 100% was collected in two equal splits on 5 
foot intervals. One split was labeled as a duplicate sample which was stored on site behind a locked 
access gate until the end of the drill program and then transported by HDG employees to a locked facility 
in Cedar City, Utah. Samples were handled at all times by HDG personnel and a geologist was present at 
all times during drilling. The geologist collected a small portion of the duplicate sample which was placed 
into chip trays labeled by drill hole number and footage. Chips were then logged on site by the geologist. 
From the duplicate sample HDG filled a 4x6 inch zip lock bag labeled by drill hole number and footage. 
This material is intended to be used for chip boards and future petrographic work if needed. Samples for 
analysis were transported from the drill to a secured area behind a locked gate on a daily basis. From the 
secured area samples were picked up by Inspectorate Laboratories and transported to their facilities in 
Sparks, Nevada.  

The QP for the project, Randall Moore VP of Exploration for High Desert Gold, organized sampling 
procedures and supervised the labeling and cataloging of all the samples.   

10.4  CORE DRILLING 

HDG completed 2 core holes in 2011. The holes were drilled by West-Core Drilling and they provided 
HDG with oriented core. The core had a top mark provided by the drill crews. Core was collected in a split 
tube to reduce breakage and to provide the drillers the ability to remove the core without rotation. Core 
was then placed in boxes by the drill crews. Boxes were labeled by hole number, box number and footage. 
Boxes were collected at the drill site by HDG geologists and transported to a secure area behind locked 
gates. Core was logged by HDG geologists who determined sampling intervals. Intervals were marked in 
the boxes and noted on the drill logs. The core was split in half by HDG employees by either a rock saw or 
a mechanical splitter. Half the core was returned to the box taking care to keep the proper alignment and 
location for the pieces. Half of each sample interval was placed in numbered bags for analysis. These 
bags were stored in a secure area behind locked gates and later transported to the Inspectorate 
laboratory facility in Sparks, Nevada by HDG employees.

10.5  RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION 

The Gold Springs gold system is characterized  by large through-going veins, complex sheeted veins, 
breccias and stockwork vein systems that are laterally extensive and locally form resistant ledges and ribs 
that protrude up to 10 metres above the surrounding ground surface.  The veins contain quartz, adularia, 
bladed calcite, minor fluorite, and minor sulfides (<2%) and represent a low sulfidation, epithermal 
gold-silver vein systems.  Trace element geochemistry for As (arsenic) and Sb (antimony) show relatively 
low values similar to other quartz-adularia epithermal vein systems such as the K-2 deposit (>2,000,000 
ounces gold) in Washington and the Midas deposit (>3,000,000 ounces gold ) in northern Nevada. Veins 
generally strike north-south but significant high-grade gold values occur in secondary structural settings 
trending northeast and northwest. This is observed in the Gray Eagle target area where the three 
dominant faulting and mineralized trends intersect. Gold is also hosted in welded tuffs at the historic Pope 
mine location where east-west narrow veins and clay filled fractures contain concentrations of gold that 
can be panned from crushed samples or washed samples.    

HDG has completed rock chip sampling, preliminary mapping, soil sampling and a property wide 
aero-magnetic and ZTEM geophysical survey. This work has resulted in the definition of 18 targets 
located within lands controlled by the HDG/Pilot Gold JV. All targets have a strong gold and silver 
signature and all potentially represent targets worthy of drill testing.   

There are a variety in the styles of mineralization which include disseminated and stockwork controlled 
bulk targets, high-grade underground targets, tuff hosted sheeted vein and disseminated bulk targets, and 
pipe-like features hosted within intra-caldera tuffs and rhyolites.  The geologic setting is positive for the 
discovery of additional high-grade gold mineralization with the wide-spread distribution of targets 
developed by HDG across the project area with the potential for additional discoveries.

11.0   SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
All assays were performed independently by Inspectorate Laboratories, located in Sparks, Nevada, USA 
using a one ton fire assay with an AA finish for gold and Inductively-Coupled Plasma ("ICP") analytical 
methods for all other elements. Internal lab check analyses were performed through analytical standards 
and the re-analyzing of certain samples.  Both types of check analyses showed very consistent results 
with variations of less than +/- 2%.   

All samples were collected by, or under the direct supervision of, a Qualified Person ("QP").  Emphasis 
was placed on quality control and the proper handling and numbering of all samples. No sample 
preparation was conducted prior to the material being shipped to the laboratory and no sample 
preparation was conducted by an employee, officer, director, or associate of HDG. The samples were 
transported by trusted HDG personnel or by Inspectorate personnel or shipped via a commercial carrier to 
Inspectorate or transported by Inspectorate from the site to the laboratory.  Under controlled laboratory 
conditions, the samples were crushed, split, ground and analyzed for gold using an industry standard 50 
gram fire assay charge, with an atomic absorption (A.A.) or gravimetric finish and trace element 
geochemistry was performed using standard Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry 
("ICP-AES") methods beginning with a four- acid, near-total digestion of the sample matrix.  All samples 
with geochemical content greater than the detection limits for ICP methodology were re-analyzed using 



Page 66 of 98 

standard assay methods. Initial analytical results were checked by re-analysis of suites of both drill 
samples and rock chip samples.  These facilities are ISO 9001:2000 certified laboratories which insert a 
total of 8% blank and standard samples into each analyzed sample batch to ensure precision and 
accuracy. When analytical results were received, they were checked against their geological context and, 
subsequently, the field locations and sample descriptions were cross-referenced with the results and 
sample numbers to ensure accuracy.   

The Author's opinion is that the samples were handled by HDG with adequate security in transport and 
handling.  The samples were adequately prepared by the lab and that all analytical procedures 
implemented by Inspectorate Laboratories, ISO 9001:2000 certified, meet the industry standards. 

11.1  CHECK SAMPLING 

A total of 48 RC and 18 rock chip samples from the 2010 exploration program were submitted for 
re-assay.  These samples were re-pulped from the coarse rejects using a disc pulverizer. This was done 
to determine both repeatability and to check if there would be a significant difference in gold values using 
a different prep method.   A total of 28 RC coarse rejects form the 2011 drill program were submitted for 
re-assay using a metallic screen analysis where samples are screened to 150 mesh and the oversized 
fraction and the minus fraction are individually analyzed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish.  

Re-assaying pulps from the 2010 program produced an average variation for all samples of 2.95%. While 
the suite of samples as a whole display very good repeatability, individual samples can show variations of 
up to 37%. This type of variation is not is not unexpected given the presence of coarse gold particles 
within the district. .

A total of 28 RC samples from the 2011 exploration drilling program were submitted for re-assay.  The 
2011 samples which were re-assayed display a 6% variation when viewed as a whole. Individual samples 
display variations of up to 179%.  In general most of the gold reported to the -150 mesh fraction, and in all 
but one sample a portion of the gold reported to the coarse fraction.

11.2  PRELIMINARY TESTING OF "NUGGET EFFECT" PHENOMENA 

High Desert Gold conducted a series of tests designed to assess the recoverability of gold by gravity 
separation followed by cyanidation. These tests were also conducted to assess the possible variation of 
gold grades due to the presence of coarse gold, the so called "nugget effect".  These tests were 
conducted on twelve samples collected from the 2010 drill program on the Jumbo target which had 
previously been analyzed by fire assay. The tests used a much larger sample size of 3 kilograms instead 



Page 71 of 98 

of the original 30 grams used for the fire assays. The average recovery for all samples tested was 96.8% 
and the overall gold grades increased by an average of 30% over the original fire assays. 

The test work demonstrated that excellent gold recoveries can be obtained through a combination of 
gravity separation followed by cyanidation and also showed that the true average gold grade for the 12 
samples is 30.1% higher than previously reported from the fire assay procedure. The differences between 
grades derived from the initial fire assays using the smaller 30 gram samples and the bottle rolls using the 
larger 3 kg samples varied significantly between some samples, with the present tests yielding results 
which varied between 30.5% lower to 209.9% higher than the original gold fire assays. This type of 
variation is commonly referred to as the "nugget effect" and occurs when gold occurs as coarse grains in 
the mineralization, as shown in Figure 12.1 below. The average 30% increase in grade is economically 
significant and would have an important positive impact on results reported to date.

Samples 25366 through 25368 were from the unoxidized portion of drill hole Jumbo-10-02. All other 
samples were from the oxidized portions of holes Jumbo-10-02 and Jumbo-10-03. Importantly the 
recoveries from both oxidized and unoxidized pyritic mineralization were very similar, indicating that good 
leach recoveries should be obtainable throughout the mineralized system not just in the near surface 
oxidized material. This is an important economic characteristic and very positive with respect to the 
property potential and valuation. 

The tests were carried out by Process Research Associates, a metallurgical Laboratory located in 
Richmond, BC. Assays at were performed by International Plasma Laboratories, an ISO 9001:2000 
Certified laboratory. Gold was analyzed by fire assay of a 30 g sample with an AA finish.

12.0   DATA VERIFICATION 

12.1  AUTHOR'S CHECK SAMPLING 

During the site visit in 2011, the Author collected representative samples from the splits of drill cuttings 
that are stored in Cedar City by High Desert Gold.  A split of these samples were collected by the Author 
and sent to Inspectorate Labs in Reno, Nevada for analysis and checked against the samples collected 
by HDG.  The results of this check sampling are shown below in Table 12-1.  The Author also collected 
two rock chip samples from locations in the field where HDG and others had previously sampled.  These 
samples were also submitted in December 2011 to Inspectorate Labs in Reno, Nevada by the Author for 
analysis.  Sample KK-11-39 was a 2 metre chip sample across the Thor vein where it remains in a caved 
stope, as shown in Figure 7.5, and was the same location and interval that was sampled by Cambior in 
1997. 

Each of the samples were collected and bagged by or supervised by the Author and directly labeled for 
submittal to the lab.  The samples were selected by the Author with the intent of testing a representative 
sample of the mineralized intervals, and these results are shown in the Table 12-1 below with the 
corresponding data that was reported by HDG for each check sample.  The intent of the Author's sampling 
was, to the extent possible, to duplicate the same type of sample taken by HDG.  The Author ensured that 
to the extent possible each sample was collected and prepared to be representative for the drill interval 
and sample.

above). 

The results of the sampling by the Author confirm the presence of gold mineralization and in the relative 
value ranges that have been reported by HDG.  Although there are some variations in the geochemical 
data for the check samples, this is considered by the Author as being within an acceptable range 
considering that the samples taken were not exactly identical to the original HDG samples from drilling 
and sample sites. 

The sampling conducted by HDG has suggested that there is a potential for a "nugget effect" and the 
variability noted in the samples reported above is considered within reason by the Author.  This effect is 
particularly evident where visible gold grains are observed in some of the high-grade samples and in 
panned concentrates, as shown in Figure 12.1, above.  There are a few samples listed above that should 
be considered for re-running and checking the pulps, notably HDG samples numbers: 25624 and 42191.

13.0   MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
To date, HDG has not carried out any mineral processing or metallurgical testing on the project. 

14.0   MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
This resource estimate represents the first resource estimate completed on the High Desert Gold's (HDG) 
Jumbo Zone, on the Gold Springs Property in Nevada. The resource report was commissioned by HDG 
and completed by GeoVector Management Inc. ("GeoVector") on the Property in 2011, the results of 
which were reported in a news release issued on December 22nd, 2011 (filed on SEDAR). HDG reported, 
at a 0.3 gpt qold equivalent (AuEq*) cut-off, an Inferred Mineral Resource of 173,000 oz. gold at 0.57 gpt 
and 3.88 Moz of silver at 12.9 gpt, equivalent to 233,000 ounces of AuEq* at 0.77 gpt. To complete the 
inferred mineral resource GeoVector assessed the raw drill core database that was available from drill 
programs completed between 1988 and 2010. 

The inferred mineral resource was estimated by Allan Armitage, Ph.D., P. Geol., of GeoVector. Dr. 
Armitage is an independent Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. Practices consistent with CIM 
(2005) were applied to the generation of the  resource estimate. There are no mineral reserves estimated 
for the Property at this time. 

Inverse distances squared interpolation restricted to mineralized domains were used to estimate gold and 
silver into the resource block model. Inferred mineral resources are reported in summary tables under the 
sub-heading "Resource Classification" below, consistent with CIM definitions required by NI 43-101 (CIM, 
2005). 

14.1  DRILL FILE PREPARATION 

The Jumbo mineral resource estimate is based on 28 RC (reverse circulation) drill holes totalling 4,076 
metres with 2,280 assay values collected through 2010. A summary of the complete database used for 
the updated resource is presented below (Table 14-1). In order to complete the resource, GeoVector was 
provided with a drill hole database which included collar locations, down hole survey data, assay data, 
and lithology data. A preliminary geological model was also provided to GeoVector to help guide the 
resource model. Finally a database of topographic points was provided from which a 3D DXF topographic 
surface was created. 

The database was checked for errors. The assay database was checked for sample overlaps and gapping 
in intervals. The database was checked for typographical errors in assay values and supporting 
information on source of assay values was completed. Generally the database was in good shape and 
was accepted by GeoVector as is. 

Verifications were also carried out on drill hole locations, down hole surveys, and topography information. 
A number of drill hole elevation values were adjusted based on the topographic surface. Drill hole 
locations have not been surveyed. 

A summary of a statistical analysis of assays from the Jumbo zone drilling is presented in below.

14.2  RESOURCE MODELING AND WIREFRAMING 

For the resource estimate, a grade control model was built which involved visually interpreting mineralized 
zones from cross sections using histograms of gold and silver values. Polygons of mineral intersections 
were made on each cross section and these were wireframed together to create contiguous resource 
models in Gemcom GEMS 6.3 software. 

The modeling exercise provided broad controls of the dominant mineralizing direction. The Jumbo 
resource model (Figure 14.2) extends for approximately 700 metres and to a depth of 150 to 200 metres, 
trends at 360° and dips approximately 70-85° to the east.

14.3  COMPOSITES 

The assay sample database available for the updated resource totalled 2,280 samples representing 4,076 
metres of core. Average width of the sample intervals was 1.53 meters, within a range of 1.52 meters to 
3.05 meters. Of the total assay population only 3 samples were greater than 1.53 meters. For 
consistencies, 1.5 metre composites of gold, silver and gold equivalent ("AuEq") were used for the 
resource estimate.  

Composites for drill holes were generated starting from the collar of each hole and totalled 2,541. For the 
resource estimate, a composite population of 825 sample points was generated for the mineralized 
domain  (Table 14-3). This resource composite population is constrained by the samples within that 
domain. These composite values were used to interpolate grade into the resource model.

14.4  GRADE CAPPING 

For the resource estimate, the composites were domained into mineralization and waste based on 
whether they intersected the individual resource models. A total 825 composite sample points occur within 
the Jumbo resource model (Table 14-3). These values were used to interpolate grade into their respective 
resource blocks. 

Based on a statistical analysis of the composite database from each resource model, it was decided that 
no capping was required on the composite populations to limit high values. Descriptive statistics of the 
composited values for Au and Ag are shown in Table 14-3. Histograms of the data indicate a relatively log 
normal distribution of the metals with very few outliers within the database. Analyses of the spatial location 
of these samples and the sample values proximal to them led GeoVector to believe that the high values 
were legitimate parts of the population, and that the impact of including these high composite values uncut 
would be negligible to the overall resource estimate.

14.5  BLOCK MODELING 

A block model was created for the Jumbo mineralized zone within NAD 27 Zone11 space. Block model 
dimensions are listed in Table 14-4. Block model size was designed to reflect the spatial distribution of the 
raw data – i.e. the drill hole spacing (Figure 14.3) within each mineralized zone. It was decided to create 
resource blocks that were 5 x 10 x 10 metre in size in the X, Y and Z directions respectively. At this scale 
of the deposit this still provides a reasonable block size for discerning grade distribution, while still being 
large enough not to mislead when looking at higher cut-off grade distribution within the model. The model 
was intersected with surface topography to exclude blocks, or portions of blocks, that extend above the 
bedrock surface.

14.6  SPECIFIC GRAVITY 

There was no specific gravity (SG) data available from the Jumbo drill database. A value of 2.6 t/m3 was 
recommended by HDG and accepted by GeoVector. The host rocks for the Jumbo mineralization include 
felsic volcanic rocks and an SG value of 2.6 t/m3 is considered acceptable. It is recommended that HDG 
begin collecting SG data during the next round of drilling. 

14.7  GRADE INTERPOLATION 

The primary aim of the interpolation was to fill all the blocks within the resource model with grade. To 
generate grade within the blocks inverse distance squared (ID2) was used. Due to the lack of composite 
data, a 3D semi-variography analysis of mineralized points within the resource model did no effectively 
design an acceptable search ellipse. As a result, a search ellipse was interpreted based on drill hole 
(Data) spacing, and orientation and size of the resource model. The long axis of the search ellipses was 
oriented to reflect the observed preferential long axis (geological trend) of the resource model (Figure 
14.3). The short Z direction reflects the roughly 1/4 distance of the model in this direction relative to the 
longer axis. The dip axis Y of the search ellipse was set to reflect the observed trend of the mineralization 
down dip. 

For the Jumbo resource the size of the search ellipse was set at 100 x 100 x 25 in the X, Y, Z direction. 
The Principal azimuth is oriented at 0º and the Principal dip is oriented at -70°. 

14.8  MODEL VALIDATION 

The total volume of the blocks in each resource model, at a 0 cut-off grade value compared to the volume 
of each wireframe model was essentially identical. The size of the search ellipse and the number of 
samples used to interpolate grade achieved the desired effect of filling the resource models and very few 
blocks had zero grade interpolated into them. 

Because ID2 interpolation was used the drill hole intersection grades would be expected to show good 
correlation with the modelled block grades. Visual checks of block grades of gold, silver and gold 
equivalent against the composite data in 3D (Figure 14.4) and on vertical sections (Figures 14.5-14.8) 
showed excellent correlation between block grades and drill intersections. The Jumbo resource model is 
considered valid.

14.9  RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 

The Mineral Resource estimate is classified in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards (2005). 
Based on the current drill and channel sample database, it is considered that there is sufficient drill density 
and confidence in the distribution of gold and silver within the resource model to classify the Jumbo 
mineralization as inferred. Therefore, all material in the resource estimates is classified as inferred. 

14.10  RESOURCE REPORTING 
14.10.A  INFERRED MINERAL RESOURCE: 

An 'Inferred Mineral Resource' is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality 
can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but 
not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling 
gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and 
drill holes. 

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all 
or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral 
Resource as a result of continued exploration. Confidence in the estimate is insufficient to allow the 
meaningful application of technical and economic parameters or to enable an evaluation of economic 
viability worthy of public disclosure. Inferred Mineral Resources must be excluded from estimates forming 
the basis of feasibility or other economic studies. 

GeoVector has estimated a range of inferred resources at various silver equivalent (Ag_Eq) cut-off grades 
for the Jumbo Zone (Table 14-5). Using a 0.3 AuEq gpt cut-off, an inferred resource of 173,000 oz. gold at 
0.57 gpt and 3.88 Moz of silver at 12.9 gpt, equivalent to 233,000 ounces of AuEq at 0.77 gpt, has been 
estimated.

Page 90 of 98 

in this report. In addition GeoVector does not know of any mining, metallurgical, infrastructural or other 
relevant factors that could materially affect the Inferred Mineral Resource estimate contained in this 
report. 

15.0   ADJACENT PROPERTIES  
Pilot Gold has mining claims and properties approximately 6 kilometres to the northeast in the Stateline 
District in Utah, where they are actively exploring outside the JV area. 

16.0   OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION  
There is no other relevant data or information available that is necessary to make the technical report 
understandable and not misleading. 

17.0   INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS  
The Gold Springs gold system is characterized  by large through going veins, complex sheeted veins, 
breccias and stockwork vein systems that are laterally extensive and locally form resistant ledges and ribs 
that protrude up to 10 metres above the surrounding ground surface.  The veins contain quartz, adularia, 
bladed calcite, minor fluorite, and minor sulfides (<2%) and represent a low sulfidation, epithermal 
gold-silver vein systems.  Trace element geochemistry for As (arsenic) and Sb (antimony) show relatively 
low values similar to other quartz-adularia epithermal vein systems such as the K-2 deposit (>2,000,000 
ounces gold) in Washington and the Midas deposit (>3,000,000 ounces gold ) in northern Nevada. Veins 
generally strike north-south but significant high-grade gold values occur in secondary structural settings 
trending northeast and northwest. This is seen in the Gray Eagle zone where the three dominant faulting 
and mineralized trends intersect. Gold is also hosted in welded tuffs at the historic Pope mine location 
where east-west narrow veins and clay filled fractures contain concentrations of gold that can be panned 
from crushed samples or washed samples.    

High Desert Gold has completed rock chip sampling, preliminary mapping, soil sampling and a property 
wide aero-magnetic and ZTEM geophysical survey. The combination of the geological and geophysical 
work has identified 18 target areas for gold mineralization located within the project area. These targets 
include areas that exhibit a strong gold and silver signature and have the potential to represent targets 
that justify drill testing. Currently, HDG has completed drilling on several of these areas, including the 
Jumbo (10 holes), Thor (3 holes), Gray Eagle (10 holes), Homestead (5 holes) and Midnight (2 holes) 
targets. Previous exploration by companies completed drill holes on the Etna (6 holes) and Jennie North 
(1 hole) targets. In each instance, the drilling demonstrated that gold mineralization is present in these 
areas. The combination of surface geochemical sampling and drilling results show the potential for 
significant gold mineralization exists in the Gold Springs project area as narrow high-grade veins (>3.0 gpt 
gold) and in areas of broad lower-grade mineralization (<1.0 gpt gold). HDG completed an initial inferred 
resource on the Jumbo target area that indicates an estimate of 173,115 ounces of gold @ 0.57 gpt and 
3,880,745 ounces of silver @ 12.9 gpt for a total of combined amount of 233,344 ounces gold equivalent 
at a grade of 0.77 gpt.  This inferred resource remains open along strike and at depth within the Jumbo 
target area.  



Page 91 of 98 

With this initial resource calculated on one of the target areas and having similar geologic settings on 
numerous other targets the project is developing into a district scale exploration program. There is a 
significant amount of work needed to understand and prioritize all of the remaining targets and to continue 
to develop resources. Drill results from the HDG programs and from previous operators supports the 
expectations that some of the targets will produce positive drill results with continued work. It is also 
reasonable to assume that some of the targets will merge into larger targets as suggested by the ZTEM 
geophysical results. These results have demonstrated that there exist long (6 to 8 km) north-south 
oriented zones of high resistivity along which a number of targets are located. Long portions of these 
resistivity anomalies occur in areas of thin alluvial cover which will require additional geophysical surveys 
or drilling to further understand.   

There are a variety in the styles of mineralization which include disseminated and stockwork controlled 
bulk targets, high-grade underground targets, tuff-hosted sheeted vein and disseminated bulk targets, 
and pipe-like features hosted within intra-caldera tuffs and rhyolites.  The geologic setting is positive for 
discovery and the number of high-grade gold samples and the wide spread distribution across the project 
area suggests that there is a good possibility for additional discoveries.  

It is recommended that as HDG continues work on the Gold Springs Project they complete a project wide 
mapping program that is designed to look at the volcanic stratigraphy and to place the mineralized target 
areas into a regional framework. In this way they will have the ability to further prioritize areas for 
exploration drilling and to define additional resources. 

18.0   RECOMMENDATIONS 
Additional detailed geological work is recommended for the Gold Springs property, which would focus on 
collecting geologic information from detailed mapping, geochemical sampling of rock chips and analyzing 
the geophysical data, followed by a rotary drill program. Any future drill programs should include standard 
and blank samples inserted into the drill samples submitted to the labs at a rate of no less then 5%. This 
work has the potential to develop the high-priority targets within the property and continue developing 
additional targets in preparation for future drilling.  It is estimated that this continuing exploration at the Gold 
Springs property will require an expenditure of approximately US$2,569,000.  A two-phase approach is 
recommended with an initial rotary drilling program in the Jumbo resource area followed by a second 
phase with drilling in other target areas that are developed by detailed geological work carried out during 
Phase I in the large property position controlled by High Desert Gold. 

The following budget is for a phase one 6,000 foot (1,829 meters) RC drill program which is proposed for 
the first half of 2012. The budget will also include expenditures for continued soil and stream sediment 
sampling programs and first pass sampling in areas of new claims. Expenditures for permitting will be 
required to ensure that HDG will be able to continue to develop and carry out future drill programs on 
priority targets later in 2012 and in the years ahead. A phase two program to be conducted after results for 
phase one are received and interpreted is also outlined below and consists of a 15,000 foot (4,572 
meters). This program will continue to explore targets developed by HDG but will also focus on expanding 
the resource base at Gold Springs either at the Jumbo target of on one of the other targets depending on 
the phase one results.
