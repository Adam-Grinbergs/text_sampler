 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 4 
 

1.0 SUMMARY 
 
This technical report (the "Report") was prepared at the request of Mr. Jean-Marc Lacoste, 
President and Chief Executive Officer of Monarques Resources Inc., ("Monarques"), and Mr. 
Thomas Larsen, President and CEO of Eloro Resources Ltd. ("Eloro"). Monarques is a 
Canadian-based, public company, currently trading on the Toronto Venture Stock Exchange 
(TSX:V) under the symbol of MQR, whereas Eloro is a Canadian based, publicly-held company 
trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol of ELO. Monarques is a reporting 
issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Québec, with its corporate office at 450, Gare 
du Palais Street, Québec (Québec), Canada G1K 3X2. Eloro is a reporting issuer in British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, with its corporate office at 20 Adelaide Street East, Suite 301, 
Toronto (Ontario), Canada M5C 2T6. 
 
In August of 2013, Monarques and Eloro commissioned the author, Mr. Abderrazak Ladidi (the 
"Author") of MRB & Associates Inc. ("MRB"), of Val-d'Or, Quebec, to prepare a Mineral 
Resource Estimate and accompanying Technical Report (the "Report") in accordance with 
National Instrument (NI) 43-101 on the Simkar Gold Project (the "Project" or, the "Property"), 
which comprises two (2) contiguous mining concessions (2.26 km2) and eleven mineral claims 
(1.77 km2) in the prolific Val-d'Or Gold Mining Camp, 20 km east of Val-d'Or, Québec. The 
Simkar Project is currently being explored pursuant to an option agreement with Eloro 
Resources Ltd. (TSX-V: ELO), whereby Monarques was granted the right to earn a 50% 
interest in the Project. Monarques are the current operators on the Property and are carrying 
out a diamond-drilling campaign; however, the results of this campaign are not included in 
this Report. As at November 1st the current drilling program had completed a cumulative total 
of 4209 metres in 13 holes. Eloro's last exploration work on the Property was completed on 
January 13th, 2013. 
 
Under the terms of the agreement Eloro Resources Ltd. has sold an undivided 50% interest in 
the Property in exchange for a commitment by Monarques to perform $750,000 of exploration 
work on the Property. Following the fulfilment of the exploration work commitment, Eloro and 
Monarques will form a joint venture with respect to the Property which will be operated by 
Monarques. If the exploration work commitment is not completed on or before June 30, 2014, 
the Company will have the right to rescind the sale and take back the interest in the Property 
sold to Monarques. 
 
Eloro has also issued 8 million common shares to Monarques by way of private placement at a 
price of $0.015 per share. In a concurrent transaction, Eloro has also issued 3 million shares 
to an arm's length creditor at a deemed value of $0.05 per share. Following the completion of 
the private placement and the shares for debt issuance Monarques holds approximately 12.8% 
of the issued and outstanding common shares of Eloro.  

The purpose of the Report is to provide an independent Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) for 
the Simkar Project, prepared in accordance with NI 43-101. The Report will be filed on the 
System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) (http://www.sedar.com/), as 
required under applicable securities regulations. 
 
1.1 Property Description and Ownership 
 
The Simkar Project is an early-stage exploration property within the National Topographic 
System (NTS) map sheet 32C/04 in Louvicourt Township, approximately 20 km east of Val-
d'Or, Quebec. It consists of comprises two (2) contiguous mining concessions (2.26 km2) and 
eleven mineral claims (1.77 km2) totalling 225.63 ha. The Property hosts a high-grade, 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 5 
 

intrusion-related, shear zone, gold-quartz vein system, characteristic of most gold deposits in 
Val-d'Or Gold Mining District.  
 
At present, there is no commercial production on the Property; however, there are extensive 
underground mine workings and stopes, from a former gold producer (Louvicourt Goldfield) on 
the Property. 
 
Prior production from the mine on the property came from three main zones – the A Zone, B 
Zone, and C Zone. Exploration by Megastar Resources (1996-2004) identified three additional 
gold-bearing zones (Pillar Zone, F Zone, and Montana Zone), and identified a high-potential 
structure named the East Zone Shear.

1.2 Geology and Mineralization 
 
The Simkar Property is located within the Late Archean Abitibi Greenstone Belt. It is underlain 
by a thick sequence of complexly intercalated volcanic flows and pyroclastics of the Malartic 
Group. Typical of the region, the sequence strikes east-west and dips steeply to the north with 
top directions to the south. The rocks have undergone greenschist facies metamorphism. 
 
Quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes and sills intrude the intercalated volcanic flows and pyroclastic 
sequences in the central and southern parts of the Property. These intrusions trend east and 
northeast, and dip steeply to the south. Five diorite sills underlie the Property, south of the 
baseline (from north to south); B-diorite, A-diorite, East diorite, Southwest diorite, and the 
Southeast diorite. The diorites are closely associate, spatially, with mineralization.  
 
The Simkar Property contains Archean gold-vein systems that generally strike easterly. The 
high-grade, intrusion-centred gold-quartz vein system is similar to the Sigma-Lamaque 
deposit in Val-d'Or and many other camps in the Abitibi Belt. A secondary type of target on 
the Property, little-investigated to date, are Noranda- or Matagami-type volcanogenic massive 
sulphide (VMS) deposits, one of which may underlie the northwest part of the Property, at 
around 1000 m depth.  
 
Shear zones and intrusions play an important role in controlling the mineralization along the 
Larder Lake - Cadillac Tectonic Zone, the focus of gold mining activity in the south eastern 
Abitibi Greenstone Belt. The mineralized zones or "shoots" at Simkar follow second order 
(Riedel) shear patterns and consist of quartz-carbonate-tourmaline vein systems that locally 
form stock-works (vein arrays). The mineralized zones contain mainly pyrite, minor 
chalcopyrite, and trace pyrrhotite, sphalerite, molybdenite, telluro-bismuthite and native gold. 
Gold occurs mainly in quartz-pyrite veins as fine inclusions within pyrite or at its boundaries, 
and is closely associated with the bismuth telluride.  
 
The primary (most abundant) set of Riedel veins dips 40º towards 320º. A second set dips 35º 
towards 220°. The intersection of these two sets plunges 25° towards 270º, and defines the 
long axis and plunge of the ore zones.  
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 6 
 

The various mineralized veins and structures on the Property exhibit a variety of features 
individually; however, they all have certain characteristics in common, which are also typical 
of most Abitibi camps. Typically, mineralized zones on the Simkar Property feature quartz-
tourmaline veinlets/veins/stockwork with some carbonate and sulphides. The sulphide content 
of veins varies from 3 percent to over 50%, with pyrite by far the dominant sulphide, typically 
70-95% of total sulphides. Other sulphides are chalcopyrite with lesser gold/electrum, galena, 
and sphalerite.  
 
1.3 Recent Exploration 
 
The 2004 and earlier exploration work has been described in a previous Technical Report 
(Pelletier, 2004).  
 
Megastar Development Corp. undertook additional work in 2006 and 2007. Their work 
consisted of digitization of underground mine workings, the creation of a diamond-drill hole 
database, surface geophysics, and a 2007 drilling program of 15 NQ diamond-drill holes 
totalling 4,340 metres. 
 
The holes intersected targets in the B, C, and East Shear zones, plus other targets. These 15 
holes were added to the pre-existing database of over 500 drill holes and sample channels. 
 
A 2008 NI 43-101 Technical Report commissioned by Megastar, and prepared by Chlumsky, 
Armbrust & Meyer (Bourgoin and Sandefur, 2008) included a Resource Estimate of the Simkar 
Property; however, the estimate is no longer considered valid as it was calculated using an 
unconstrained, nearest-neighbour method.   
 
From 2009-2013 Eloro Resources were the principle operators on the Property completing 
23,778 cumulative metres of diamond-drilling in 54 surface holes, and collecting 8,352 core 
intervals samples for assay.  
 
in October 2013, Monarques commenced a diamond-drilling programme on the Property, 
which is currently on-going. As at the date of this Report, 4200 metres in 13 holes have been 
drilled; however, data from the current exploration programme are not included in this Report. 
 
The database for the current Mineral Resource Estimate modelling incorporates 590 surface 
and underground diamond-drill holes, comprising 79,590 total metres, and results from 
14,506 sampled intervals. 
 
1.4 Resource Estimation 
 
The mineral Resources reported herein were calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, 
Definitions and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions 
and adopted by CIM Council on Dec 11, 2005. 
 
The current Simkar Project Mineral Resource Estimate was calculated using conventional 
statistical analysis, variography and grade interpolation via Gemcom® block modelling. 
Utilizing 1.0 m long assays for gold (Au), the block models, within an interpreted three-
dimensional (3D) solid domain were coded with the rock codes, bulk density, and classified 
into the Measured, Indicated and Inferred categories. 
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 7 
 

The Inferred Resource estimate in this report was developed to determine whether further 
exploration on the Simkar Property was warranted. Highlights of the estimation procedure 
include: 

 A Gemcom database developed by MRB was used in the estimate, using the GEMCOM 
down-hole survey calculations and GEMLOGGER drill-logs; 

 Some inconsistencies and minor errors were noted in the database. MRB believes that 
the effect of these is not significant, given the inherent uncertainty in the Resource 
estimation process; 

 Calculations were done using the Gemcom block models software system; 
 ordinary Kriging algorithm was used for the primary estimate within anisotropic 

elliptical search ranges (where appropriate) and using suitable parameters. The search 
distances used for the estimates are based upon an expansion factor of the semi-
variogram ranges. A block size of 10 m x 1 m x 10 m was employed; 

 A bulk density of 2.70 tonnes per cubic metre was used for this estimated resource 
based on theoretical densities and practices in mine exploiting similar minerals in the 
region Capping of gold grades did not significantly change the Resource estimate within 
any one set of parameters, therefore caps were not applied. 

 
The following table presents a summary of the Resources1, using ore blocks. Based on these 
parameters, a 3.0 gpt cut-off grade appears reasonable at this stage of the project.

1 The current Mineral Resource Estimate was calculated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions 
and Guidelines prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions. Mineral 
resources, which are not mineral reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The 
mineral resource estimate may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, 
title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. Furthermore, the quantity 
and grade of estimated Inferred Resource reported herein are uncertain and there has been 
insufficient exploration to categorize them as an Indicated or Measured Resource. It is 
uncertain if further exploration will result in reclassification of Inferred Mineral Resources to 
the Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource categories. The tonnage numbers are rounded 
according to NI 43-101 standards. Grades are calculated from Au concentrations determined 
from sample assays completed by ALS Minerals using conventional Fire Assaying with 30 g 
fusions and AAS finish. 
 
Mineral Resources are not mineral Reserves and therefore do not have demonstrated 
economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by 
environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant 
issues. 
 
The quantity and grade of reported Inferred Resources in this estimation are conceptual in 
nature. There has been insufficient exploration to define an Indicated mineral resource on the 
Property, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in discovery of an Indicated or 
Measured mineral Resource on the Property.

1.4 Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
Recent work on the Simkar Project has confirmed that the formerly explored and exploited 
gold bearing structures on these properties continue to show potential for hosting additional 
mineralization, and merit additional exploration work.  
 
The resources were estimated using ordinary kriging and a parallel estimate was conducted 
using the inverse distance squared method as a check. The majority of the resource has been 
classified as Inferred; more drilling information is judged necessary to identify Indicated and 
Measured resources. 
 
The block size dimension (10m X 1m X 10m) was based on the existing drilling pattern and 
mine planning considerations.  
 
Although there are some discrepancies for the individual pulp re-assays, the QAQC program 
employed for the Simkar Project was more than adequate. 
 
Based on his review of the Simkar Project, the author makes the following recommendations:  

 Phase I - additional diamond-drilling should be carried out with a concurrent, thorough 
sampling protocol, to expand the estimated Mineral Resources and provide core 
material for initial metallurgical testing, which will help to determine the characteristics 
of the mineralized zones;  

 Phase II - Additional diamond-drilling to further increase the resource volume and to 
upgrade Inferred Resources to the Indicated category. Supplementary metallurgical 
testing and bulk sampling to determine  potential processing and recovery scenarios. 

 
A diamond-drilling campaign that will qualify as part of the Phase I recommended programme 
is currently underway on the Project, pursuant to the active Joint Venture agreement between 
Monarques and Eloro. The current campaign, which is expected to be completed by mid-
December 2013, is budgeted at $750,000, of which approximately $600,000 has been 
expended.  
 
The recommended Phase II exploration programme is contingent on favourable results from 
the Phase I programme. 
 
The investment required for both phases is $5,692,500; expenditures for Phase I of the 
work program are estimated at $1,950,000, whereas expenditures for Phase II of the work 
program are estimated at $3,000,000.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
At the request of Monarques Resources Ltd. ("Monarques"), and Eloro Resources Ltd. 
("Eloro"), Abderrazak Ladidi of MRB & Associates ("MRB"), who is completely independent of 
Monarques and Eloro and a Qualified Person (QP) under the terms of National Instrument (NI) 
43-101, was contracted to prepare this Technical Report. 
 
Monarques Resources Ltd., of Val-d'Or, QC is a public company listed on the TSX Venture 
Exchange trading under the symbol MRQ. Eloro is a Canadian based, publicly-held company 
trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol of ELO. This report is intended to be 
used for public filing in Canada by Monarques. 
 
The following Report presents an initial Resource Estimate, prepared by MRB, regarding the 
gold deposit underlying the Simkar Property, located in Louvicourt Township, approximately 
20 km east of the city of Val-d'Or, Québec, Canada.  
 
This report does not incorporate parameters from previously released resource estimates for 
the Simkar deposit. The estimates of mineral resources contained in this report conform to the 
CIM Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve definitions referred to in NI 43-101, Standards of 
Disclosure for Mineral Projects. 
 
Both Monarques and Eloro have accepted that the qualifications, expertise, experience, 
competence and professional reputation of MRB's Principals and Associate Geologists and 
Engineers are appropriate and relevant for the preparation of this Report. Monarques and 
Eloro have also accepted that MRB's Principals are members of professional bodies that are 
appropriate and relevant for the preparation of this Report. 
 
The purpose of the current Report is to provide an independent, technical report and Mineral 
Resource Estimate for the Simkar Property. MRB understands that this Report will be used to 
support the public disclosure of the Monarques mineral resource estimate regarding Simkar, 
announced on October 15th, 2013 (refer to the Monarques News Release, dated October 15, 
2013). This Report will be filed on SEDAR as required by NI 43-101. 
 
This Report is considered current as at November 19th, 2013. The effective date of the Report 
is August 30th, 2013. 
 
2.1 Site Visits 
 
Site visits to the Simkar Property were carried out on January 14th, 2013 and August 10th, 
2013 by Mr. Abderrazak Ladidi, P.Geo., of MRB, a Qualified Person (QP) as defined in NI 43-
101. On both occasions, Mr. Ladidi was accompanied by Bryan Sinkunas of MRB. During the 
site visits Mr. Ladidi explored the general landscape and surface features of the Property. A 
number of drill-sites (inactive) and outcrops were visited. It was noted that all visited drill 
collars were correctly labelled and accurately reflected the azimuth and dip recorded on the 
logs. Mr. Ladidi also reviewed Eloro's drill core from the Project, which is stored at a secure 
facility in Val-d'Or, Québec, and noted that the core on hand was securely stored and in very 
good condition. Core trays were well labelled, and observation suggested that the core 
cutting/splitting was well done. Sample tags were noted as being in place, and the tags and 
sampled sections corresponded to those indicated in the core logs.

 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 12 
 

4.0 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
 
The Property is located in the south-eastern part of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt proximal to the 
Val-d'Or gold camp (Figure 4-1). The Abitibi Greenstone Belt is within the Abitibi Subprovince 
of the Canadian Shield, and extends in an east-west direction for over 500 kilometres from 
Chibougamau, Quebec in the northeast to west of Timmins, Ontario, making it the largest 
greenstone belts in the world. It is a productive gold and base-metal producing region. 
 
The Simkar Property is in western Québec, approximately 20 kilometres east of the 
municipality of Val-d'Or, and overlies part of Louvicourt Townships. The Property lies within 
National Topographic System (NTS) map sheet 32C/04 (see Figure 4-1 and Figure 4-2). The 
shaft of the former Louvicourt Gold Mine (near the centre of the Property) using the Universal 
Transverse Mercator (UTM) system, is approximately 308915 E, 5326620 N (North American 
Datum (NAD) 83, Zone 19), or Latitude 48º-03'-51.17" north, Longitude 77º-33'-53.70" west. 
A summary of the individual concessions and claims is shown in Table 4-1. 
 
The Mining Licences have no encumbrances of any kind. The 11 claims, formerly known as the 
Louvicourt Property, were obtained by Eloro from KWG Resources Inc. (TSX-V: KWG) 
("KWG"), which retains a net smelter return ("NSR") royalty on gold production from the 
Louvicourt Property that is 1% of the NSR, plus an additional 1% of the NSR exceeding $2,000 
per troy ounce, plus an additional 1% of the NSR exceeding $3,000 per troy ounce. Eloro has 
done no work on these claims since their acquisition, nor is there any work underway on these 
claims. 
 
At the time of the agreement between Eloro and Monarques, the mining leases and claims 
comprising the Simkar Project were in good standing. In order to maintain the concessions, 
Monarques must make annual payments to the government of Quebec totalling approximately 
$19,000. 
 
Interest in the Property stems from an Archean gold-vein systems that underlies the Property. 
The high-grade, intrusion-centred gold-quartz vein system is similar to the Sigma-Lamaque 
deposit in Val-d'Or and many other camps in the Abitibi Belt. A secondary type of target on 
the Property, little-investigated to date, are Noranda- or Matagami-type volcanogenic massive 
sulphide (VMS) deposits, one of which may underlie the northwest part of the Property, at 
depth 
 
The recommended exploration work is in accordance with the Province of Québec's natural 
resources, environmental and cultural legislation. 
 
The reader is cautioned that previous mineral resources estimates on the Simkar Project are 
not considered valid.  
 
Currently, there are no known risk factors that would affect access, title, or the right or ability 
to perform work on the property, nor are there any legal restrictions or impediments to 
accessing the Property. There are no physical restrictions to gaining overland access to the 
claims other than the conditions of the unmaintained secondary and tertiary access roads in 
the vicinity of the Property. 
 
Part of the permit application process involves consultation with First Nations, which will have 
to be acted upon directly by Monarques as primary operator. First Nations' land claims have 
not been comprehensively settled in Québec, and their future impact on the property's access, 
title or the right and ability to perform work remain unknown.

4.1 Environmental Liabilities  
 
There has been a significant amount of exploration work performed on the Property since it 
was optioned by Eloro in 2009. There is currently a diamond-drilling programme underway on 
the Property by Monarques; however, results of this work are not included in this Report. The 
Property was explored historically by trenching and pitting, surface-geophysical surveys, 
sampling/prospecting, and diamond-drilling programmes that included grid-cutting and 
clearing of drill-sites. An historic mine, the Louvicourt Goldfields Mine operated on the 
Property from 1945 to 1949 and from 1985 to 1993. There are few vestiges of this previous 
work other than the foundations of the mine buildings and the shaft opening (covered). Past 
mining on the Property was done long prior to Eloro's acquisition of the Property and 
Monarques subsequent earn-in deal with Eloro, and any future potential liability regarding 
tailings or old mine workings are "grandfathered" to the government of Quebec. There and no 
environmental issues related to said historic exploration and mining programs, and there is no 
current commercial production on the Property.  
 
The author is familiar with the Property, is knowledgeable about the environmental regulations 
in Quebec and in Canada. As of the writing of this report, the Author is not aware of any back-
in rights, payments or other agreements, encumbrances or environmental liabilities to which 
the Property could be subject; nor are there known environmental or land claim issues 
pending with respect to the Property. 
 
4.2 Work Permits and Plans 
 
Depending on how the recommended work on the Property is carried out, Monarques, as 
Operator, may be required to obtain some or all of the following Work Permits: Land Use; 
Timber & Cutting; Explosives; Water Crossings; Road Construction, and; Permission to Test 
Material. In addition aboriginal communities potentially affected by the exploration plan 
activities will have to be notified and be given the opportunity to provide feedback before the 
proposed activities are carried out.  
  
4.3 Details of Property Agreement 
 
The Simkar Project is currently being explored pursuant to an option agreement between Eloro 
Resources Ltd. and Monarques Resources Ltd., whereby Monarques was granted the right to 
earn a 50% interest in the Project. 
 
Under the terms of the agreement Eloro has sold an undivided 50% interest in the Property in 
exchange for a commitment by Monarques to perform $750,000 of exploration work on the 
Property. Following the fulfilment of the exploration work commitment, Eloro and Monarques 
will form a joint venture with respect to the Simkar Property, which will be operated by 
Monarques. If the exploration work commitment is not completed on or before June 30, 2014, 
Eloro will have the right to rescind the sale and take back the interest in the Simkar Property 
sold to Monarques. 
 
Eloro has also issued 8 million common shares to Monarques by way of private placement at a 
price of $0.015 per share. In a concurrent transaction, Eloro has also issued 3 million shares 
to an arm's length creditor at a deemed value of $0.05 per share. Following the completion of 
the private placement and the shares for debt issuance, Monarques holds approximately 
12.8% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Eloro. 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 17 
 

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 
The Simkar Property is accessible by gravel road that branches from Highway 117 (the Trans- 
Canada Highway) near the settlement of Colombière, located between Val-d'Or and Louvicourt 
(see Figure 4-2). The distance between Val-d'Or and Colombière is 17 km. A gravel road, the 
Chemin de la Sabourin, leaves the highway northwest of the Property boundary. The 
Louvicourt Gold Mine shaft is found approximately 3.7 km south of Highway 117 along this 
gravel road. 
 
Val-d'Or is a comprehensive mining centre capable of providing personnel, contractors, 
equipment and supplies to mining and exploration operations in the area. Electricity is 
relatively inexpensive and is maintained by Hydro-Quebec. Power is available from a provincial 
hydro transformer located at the community of Louvicourt, approximately 20 kilometres east 
of the Property. There is ample local supply of water, both potable and for processing. 
 
The topography of the Project is generally flat, half covered by marshes, with forest vegetation 
consisting primarily of black spruce, jack pine, poplar, birch, and alder. 
 
The area has a typical continental boreal climate, comparable to communities at the same 
latitude in mid Canada like Timmins, Sudbury and Thunder Bay. Snow stays on the ground 
from mid-November and the ice leaves the lakes about early-mid May. Winters can be bitterly 
cold with temperature averaging –15°C in January and February. The ground is frost free from 
May to October. Summers are warm and relatively dry with a mean temperature of 22°C. 
Precipitation is moderate, ranging from 200 to 500 millimetres annually, with half of it arriving 
as snow. 
 
There is sufficient space, and access to surface rights, for exploration work and for any 
eventual mining operations, tailings storage, waste disposal, and processing plants. 
 
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 18 
 

6.0 HISTORY 
 
This section was prepared in large part from a report by Davis (1989), and from other private 
reports and published articles. 
 
6.1 Early Work, 1939-1995 
 
1939: The Simkar claims were originally staked by J. J. Simard and C. Karpus in May 1939 to 
cover extensions of gold showings on the neighbouring Met-Mac property to the east. In July 
1939, Senator J. H. Rainville and Associates of Montreal purchased the Simkar claims. By 
August 1939, stripping and trenching along the eastern boundary had been completed yielding 
negative results. A discovery in the southwest part of the property was subsequently exposed 
by trenches for a length of 80 feet. During the period October 18 to November 10, 1939, nine 
surface diamond-drill holes totalling 643.4 metres (2,111 feet) were completed to investigate 
the discovery (Karpus) vein. Significant results included 0.60 oz./ton Au across 1.7 ft., 0.23 
oz./ton Au across 1.8 ft., 0.09 oz/ton Au across 2.2 ft. and 0.15 oz/ton Au across 16 feet. 
 
1940 to 1943: No work was completed. 
 
1944: The Simkar property was acquired by the newly formed Louvicourt Goldfields 
Corporation. In July 1944 a 10,000 foot surface diamond-drilling program was started. Due to 
encouraging results (discovery of the A and B zones) 42 drill holes yielding a total footage of 
8,971 metres (29,432 feet) were completed. 
 
1945 to 1947: In September 1945, Louvicourt Goldfields Corporation announced the decision 
to put the property into production. This would involve sinking a four-compartment shaft and 
installation of a 750 ton per day mill. A four-compartment vertical shaft was sunk to a depth of 
975 feet with levels excavated at 225, 375, 525, 675, 825 and 975 feet. Underground 
development was completed on the 225, 375, 525 and 675 levels. The total underground 
program consisted of 3,927 metres (12,883 feet) of drifting and crosscutting, 2,346 metres 
(7,696 feet) of raising and 18288 metres (60,000 feet) of underground diamond-drilling. A 
400 ton per day mill was constructed and began treatment of the Simkar ore on April 20, 
1947. 
 
1947 to 1949: Mining and underground exploration was suspended on May 7, 1949, with the 
mill continuing treatment until July 1949. During the period April 20, 1947 to July 1949 the 
mill processed 261,590 tons of ore yielding an average grade of 0.123 oz./ton Au with a mill 
recovery of 94.71%. This production was from three separate zones; the A, B and C. The 
mining and milling were suspended when the operating costs ($5.00 to $5.50 per ton) 
exceeded the recovered values of $4.00 to $4.50 per ton. Salvage of all underground 
equipment and installation (track, pipe, etc.) was completed before the mine closing. 
 
A consulting report by E. G. Bishop in 1948 suggested that 1) not enough stope preparation 
had been completed before production began; 2) stope preparation costs were too high; 3) a 
mining rate of 400 tons per day was too high for the property; 4) mill tailing losses were 
excessive from 0.39 g (0.011 oz./ton Au) to 0.44 g (0.013 oz./ton Au); 5) the sampling 
techniques applied did not provide a reliable estimate of ore grades. 
 
1950: Surface diamond-drilling to a total of 6,100 metres (20,000 feet) was drilled to explore 
for gold mineralization elsewhere on the property. As a result of this drilling, a "new" zone 
(East Zone) was discovered. This East Zone was traced for 300 feet and was situated 600 feet 
east of the last heading on the 375 foot level C-Zone drift. 
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 19 
 

1951 to 1967: No work as completed. 
 
1968: A Turam electromagnetic survey was completed by Louvicourt Goldfields Corporation in 
order to investigate the base metal potential of the property. 
 
1972: Louvicourt Goldfields Corporation carried out an assessment of the gold potential of the 
property. The result of this study and the location of relevant sections, plans and paper are 
unknown. 
 
1973 to 1981: No work was completed. 
 
1982: Goldlund Mines attempted to revive the dormant Louvicourt Goldfields Corporation 
property. There is no record concerning any exploration completed at this time. 
 
1982 to 1986: Numerous exploration companies assessed the Simkar property but no deal 
with Louvicourt Goldfields Corporation was made. 
 
July 1987: A summary and evaluation of the gold potential of the Louvicourt Goldfields 
property was completed by Christopher R. Davis. The conclusions of this report were that the 
identified ore zones appeared to be open in one or more directions and favourable structure 
and lithologies continue across the entire property. A two phase exploration program was 
recommended consisting of a compilation, geophysics, surface drilling Phase #1, and a Phase 
2 (dependent on Phase #1 results) underground exploration program. 
 
August 11, 1987: Louvicourt Gold Mines Inc. (formerly Louvicourt Goldfields Corporation) 
executed a farm-out agreement with Fonteneau Resources Limited outlining an expenditure of 
$7 million in order to earn a 50% interest in the Simkar Project property. Fonteneau 
Resources Ltd. Assigned this agreement to Ronrico Explorations Ltd. Ronrico assumed all 
Fonteneau's rights and some of Fonteneau's obligations in the property. 
 
October 1987 to February 29, 1988: During this period, Louvicourt Mining Management 
Company Ltd. Administered a $3 million exploration program for Ronrico Explorations Ltd. The 
program consisted of detailed surface mapping; VLF, magnetometer, and HLEM geophysical 
surveys; initial sampling of the old tailings pond; overburden investigation drilling; a crown 
pillar investigation drill program; partial to complete installation of required surface 
infrastructure; and 10,114.79 metres (33,185.01 feet) of surface exploration diamond-drilling. 
 
The 1987-88 exploration program objectives were to further investigate the A, B and C zones 
gold mineralization; assess and investigate the potential of the "new" zone (East Zone); 
compile and present all available previous data; and define ore reserve potential accessible 
from the existing underground excavations. 
 
1988 to 1993: During this period of time MEGA Mining Management Ltd. Administered a 
$4.64 million exploration program for Ronrico Explorations Ltd. 
 
The program consisted of 1,510.70 metres (4,956.36 feet) of surface diamond-drilling, 
6,502.50 metres (21,333.66 feet) of underground diamond-drilling, completion of the surface 
infrastructure installations, dewatering of the underground exploration site, underground 
rehabilitation (shaft, drifts, raises), 639.10 metres (2,096.78 feet) of drifting, 299.70 metres 
(983.27 feet) of crosscutting, 179.50 metres (588.91 feet) of raising, complete remapping and 
sampling of the underground workings, compilation of available data, a structural analysis, 
and mineralogical and chemical studies. The surface infrastructure installations for the 
underground exploration consisted of a 3.7 kilometres electrical line, a 50 ft. x 130 ft. service 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 20 
 

building housing the hoist, compressors, shops and warehouse, five temporary trailers housing 
offices and dry facilities, a 90 foot head frame with a 40 ft. x 40 ft. shaft house, an Ingersoll-
Rand 72 in. x 60 in. 350 Hp hoist with 1 1/8 in. cable, septic field, water well, 138 ft. x 105 ft. 
settlement basin, and two Ingersoll-Rand compressors model Ep-250. 
 
The objectives of the 1988-89 exploration programs were to prove up the existence of ore in 
the A, B, C and East zones by underground excavations (i.e. Drifts, raises, crosscuts) and 
diamond-drilling, to define potential ore reserves remaining in the previous underground 
workings, to define new auriferous structures, and to calculate an ore reserve estimate for the 
property. 
 
The underground development work to access the East Zone on levels 2 and 3 led to the 
extraction of 71,068 metric tonnes at a grade of 8.42 g/t Au (20,000 Oz. Au). Approximately 
$12 Million was spent during this phase of underground development work. 
 
6.2 Work by Megastar, 1996-2004 
 
1996: Megastar Development Corp. acquired all rights, titles and interests of the Simkar gold 
mine in 1996. 
 
1996-2004: Megastar completed an Induced potential (IP) ground geophysical survey over 
the entire property along with limited diamond-drilling work; 9 holes in 1997 (2,763 m) and 3 
holes in 2004 (900 m). Most of this drilling was designed to test geophysical anomalies. 
 
Subsequent to the 2004 drilling work, Megastar contracted InnovExplo Inc., an independent 
geological consulting firm based in Val-d'Or QC, to prepare a NI 43-101 compliant technical 
report on the Simkar property (Pelletier, 2004).  
 
6.3 Work by Megastar, 2006-2008 
 
2006: From April to December of 2006, Megastar completed 3D mine modelling work which 
consisted in the digital construction of all underground mine workings, along with the creation 
of a diamond-drill hole database. All of this digital data was then imported into one 
comprehensive 3D database on GEMCOM software. 
 
The 3D mine modelling completed in 2006 was followed by geological interpretation work 
which in turn led to a surface drilling program designed to test several targets outlined by the 
3D study. 
 
2007: During February and March 2007, Megastar completed down-hole Pulse EM work on 4 
historical drill holes in the northern part of the Property. The survey was conducted by TMC 
Geophysics of Val-d'Or QC and was done on holes 90-19, 90-39, 97-07, and 04-SKR-01. All 
four holes were probed using the Crone Geophysics Pulse- EM (PEM) using a 16.66 millisecond 
time-base, a 1500 microsecond ramp-time and 20 sampling windows (channels). The survey 
did not detect any definite responses, which indicates the absence of conductive mineralized 
zones within a radius of approximately 150 metres surrounding the borehole axis. 
 
From March 4th, 2007 to May 25th, 2007, Megastar completed a 15 hole, 4,340 m, BQ-sized 
diamond-drilling programme on the property. A total of 1,788 samples of the core were 
collected and assayed for gold content. The drilling program was designed to further evaluate 
the gold-quartz vein systems in the southern part of the property, as well as the potential 
copper-zinc-gold-silver volcanogenic massive sulphide type mineralization in the northern part 
of the property. 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 21 
 

 
2008: A 43-101 Technical Report on the Simkar property was prepared for Megastar by 
Martin Bourgoin of MRB & Associates, and Robert Sandefur of Chlumsky, Armbrust and Meyer 
LLC (Bourgoin and Sandefur, 2008). The resource estimate published in this report was 
calculated using an unconstrained, nearest-neighbor method and is no longer considered as 
valid. 
 
6.4 Work by Eloro, 2010-2013 
 
Eloro optioned the Simkar Property from Megastar Development Corp. in 2009 and purchased 
it outright in 2010. From 2010 to 2012, Eloro completed 23,778 cumulative metres of 
diamond-drilling in 54 surface holes, and collecting 8,352 core intervals samples for assay 
(Table 6-1).

 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 22 
 

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The Simkar Property is located within the Late Archean, Abitibi Greenstone Belt (AGB), which 
is part of the central core of the North American craton known as Superior Province. The 
Abitibi Greenstone Belt is the largest, and perhaps the best-studied Archean greenstone 
terrane in the world, and hosts significant mineral resources. 
 
7.1 Regional Geological Setting 
 
The Simkar Property is situated in Louvicourt Township in the south-eastern part of the AGB. 
Louvicourt Township is underlain by the east-striking volcano-sedimentary Malartic Group, 
which is faulted against the older meta-sedimentary Pontiac Supergroup located to the south 
(Figure 7-1). Both sequences strike 060° to 090°, dip steeply north and young towards the 
south. 
 
The volcanic rocks of the Malartic Group are subdivided into two sub-groups: The Lower 
Malartic to the north composed of ultramafic and basalt flows with greywacke-argillite 
intercalations, whereas the Upper Malartic to the south, consists of basalt and andesite flows 
and fine to coarse grained pyroclastics. A spherulitic intermediate volcanic flow has been 
traced for 25 kilometres across the district. 
 
The Pontiac Supergroup is located in the southern part of the district. It consists of 
conglomerate, argillite, greywacke and mica schist, and is separated from the Malartic Group 
by the Cadillac Fault. 
 
Both the Pontiac Supergroup and Malartic Group have been metamorphosed to greenschist 
facies. In contact with later intrusive bodies, the rocks may demonstrate a higher degree of 
metamorphism. 
 
Three classes of intrusive rocks have been recognized (Quebec Provincial Report RG135 - 
Sharpe, 1968); diorite to granodiorite plutons (e.g., Bourlamaque Batholith); quartz-feldspar 
porphyry dykes and sills; and gabbro-diorite dykes and sills (e.g., Duraine sill). 
 
Numerous east-west and northeast-southwest trending shear zones occur throughout the 
region, transecting all rock types and lithologies. The majority of the east-west shears exhibit 
a reverse sense of movement (north-south compression) accompanied by distinct sub vertical 
stretching and horizontal shortening components. These shear zones provide favourable 
structures for potential gold mineralization. Most of the region's gold mineralization is spatially 
associated with these types of shears and related fracture fillings. 
 
7.2 Property Geology 
 
The Simkar Property is underlain by a thick sequence of complexly intercalated volcanic flows 
and pyroclastics of the Malartic Group. Typical of the region, the sequence strikes east-west 
and dips steeply to the north with top directions to the south (see Map 1). 
 
A complex of semi-concordant diorite-gabbro sills cut by quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes 
intrudes the intercalated volcanic flows – pyroclastic sequence in the central and southern 
parts of the Property. These intrusions trend east-west to the northeast-southwest, and dip 
steeply to the south. The diorite sills are typically continuous and regular, whereas the 
porphyry dykes are more discontinuous and highly irregular in outline.

The coexistence of albite and epidote and the presence of chlorite indicate that the rock units 
underlying the Simkar Property have undergone green schist grade metamorphism. A slightly 
higher grade of metamorphism is evident in rock units adjacent to the later stage quartz-feldspar 
porphyry dykes. 
 
Five diorite sills underlie the Property south of the baseline (from north to south); B-diorite, A-
diorite, East diorite, Southwest diorite, and the Southeast diorite. The B, A, Southwest and East 
diorite sills are actually branches of one longer diorite sill which traverses the Property and region 
(Lourmet sill) but for this report each will be discussed or referred to as separate diorite sills. 
 
The B-diorite is bounded by the Main Porphyry to the south and the Simard Shear to the north. It 
has a confirmed strike length of 1,200 metres (3,950 feet) and has been defined to a maximum 
depth of 640 metres (2,100 feet). It strikes into the Aur Resources' Annamaque property to the 
west. The eastern extent of the B-diorite sill is unknown due to a lack of drill hole intersections, 
and the masking effect of thick overburden. 
 
The A-diorite is bounded by the Main Porphyry to the north and is assumed to be the southern 
extreme of the B-diorite. It trends approximately east-west and dips steeply to the south. At the 
present time, its eastern extent is unknown. 
 
Near the south central part of the Property, the A-diorite branches into southern parallel diorite 
sills or zones; the East diorite and Southwest diorite. 
 
The East diorite occurs in the eastern part of the Property. It has a confirmed strike length of 
1000 metres (3250 feet) and extends onto the adjacent Sigma Mine's Lapaska property. 
Eastward, the north part of the East diorite apparently separates into two narrow terminal sills. 
 
The southwest diorite extends westward along the southern limit of the Property. This diorite has 
been a target of exploration on the adjacent properties; to the south and west. 
 
The Southeast diorite occurs in the south-eastern part of the Property. It is cut by a small north-
northwest trending normal, to strike slip fault with a dextral sense of displacement to the west, 
and can be traced onto the eastern adjacent property. No exploration has yet been directed 
toward this sill. 
 
Numerous quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes intrude the diorite sills and volcanic flows – pyroclastic 
sequence. The largest and most continuous of these porphyry dykes is the Main porphyry which 
separates the B and A diorite sills. It has a confirmed strike length of 1200 metres (3950 feet) 
and can be traced onto and across the adjacent properties to the west. Its eastern extension is 
presently unknown, but the Lapaska property adjacent to the east is underlain by a similar 
continuous porphyry dyke. No porphyry dykes have been defined north of the Simard Shear. The 
greatest concentration of porphyry dykes occurs in the south central part of the Property near 
the shaft and underground workings. 
 
Numerous east-west trending shear zones have been identified. These shears vary in dip for 45° 
south to 85°north, and show a reverse sense of movement. The longest of the identified shear 
zones are the Dunraine Shear separating the B-diorite from the Northern Volcanics, the East 
Zone Shear and the C-Zone Shear. The East Zone and C-Zone shears are of particular 
importance in that significant gold mineralization is associated with both. 
 
7.3 Metamorphism and Alteration 
 
Rocks on the Simkar Property appear to have undergone three phases of alteration, consisting of 
a broad regional chloritization phase and a localized silicification-sericitization phase. 
 
The ubiquitous occurrence of chlorite and carbonate (calcite) throughout the Simkar lithologies is 
the result of a regional green schist grade metamorphism. Chlorite and calcite occur as mineral 
replacements in all lithologies except in the quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes, and as joint surface 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 25 
 
coatings. Calcite is also common within small discontinuous veinlets in both the volcanics and 
diorite dykes. Sauvé (1985) notes that the addition of potassium at this time has resulted in the 
alteration of ferromagnesium minerals to biotite. 
 
The Simkar and adjacent properties underwent a phase of moderate to strong propylitization. 
This hydrothermal alteration has resulted in the development of epidote, calcite, sericite and 
saussurite. These alteration products occur within all rock types as mineral replacements (i.e., 
sericite, saussurite replacement of plagioclase) and as a late stage open space filling (i.e. Epidote 
and calcite veins). The quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes were particularly affected by this phase of 
propylitization. 
 
A later-stage phase of silicification and sericitization accompanied the emplacement of quartz 
tourmaline veins, following a remobilization event which was possibly contemporaneous with the 
intrusion of quartz-feldspar porphyry dykes and/or by later movement along the larger shear 
zones. Silicified and sericitized alteration halos ranging in thickness from 1 centimetre to 30 
centimetres commonly occur adjacent to quartz veins. Up to 10% pyrite is also common in these 
halos as medium to coarse grained disseminations.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES AND MINERALIZATION 
 
8.1 Deposit types 
 
The Simkar Property hosts an Archean, high-grade, shear-zone associated, gold-bearing, fault-fill 
and extensional quartz vein system, characteristic of the gold deposits in the Val-d'Or Gold 
Mining District. As Eloro's exploration has advanced, similarities between the gold mineralization 
at Simkar and that of the well-studied Sigma Mine in Val-d'Or, continue to be recognized.  
 
Sigma/Louvicourt-type mineralization is the result of fracturing of the relatively competent sill-
like (mainly diorite) intrusions followed by the growth of en-echelon vein systems. Progressive 
deformation causes dilation, and repeated reopening results in "crack and seal" veins, often with 
bands of tourmaline that form with successive infillings. The veins pinch and swell, and often 
branch and intersect in response to localized stress fields.  
 
The auriferous veins in these types of deposits typically include: 1) moderately to steeply dipping 
fracture-fill veins within, and parallel to, the shear zones (south dipping at Simkar); 2) 
moderately dipping extensional-shear veins (north-dipping at Simkar), and; 3) sub-horizontal 
extensional veins in the structurally competent intrusions, which at Simkar comprise diorite 
dykes sub-parallel to the regional strike (see Figures 1 and 2). The fracture-fill auriferous veins 
show a clear affinity for the more competent intrusive rocks (diorite, quartz-feldspar porphyry), 
whereas shear zones and their gold-bearing veins are typically located in the more ductile 
surrounding volcanic rocks. As a result of the stress-controlled structural permeability, the 
mineralization along the various vein systems at Simkar is unevenly distributed, with linear and 
irregular mineralized shoots separated by lower grade zones and barren fault segments. At 
Simkar, as at Sigma, both the fault-fill and extensional veins are distributed in an en-echelon or 
stepping pattern both along strike and down dip making the targeting of the mineralized zones 
difficult from surface. 
 
8.2 Mineralization 
 
This section relies heavily on the report by Bourgoin and Sandefur (2008), which in turn was 
largely based on the report by Davis (1989). 
 
The Simkar Property hosts a number of quartz lodes, as described below. These generally strike 
easterly. Figure 8-1 is a diagrammatic composite east-west long section, with the major zones 
projected into the plane of the section. 
 
The gold ores mined by from the underground workings during the period 1946 to 1949 came 
from three main zones (north to south); the B-Zone, A-Zone, and C-Zone. Other gold-bearing 
structures were investigated at this time, but were not developed and fully evaluated. The recent 
exploration has determined three new gold-bearing zones and identified one high potential 
structure, the East Zone Shear.



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 27 
 
 

 
 

Figure 8-2: Diagrammatic composite east-west long section; major zones are projected 
into the plane of the section 

 
The following sections describe each zone: 
 
8.2.1 B-Zone 
 
The B-Zone occurs within the B-diorite, north of the Main Porphyry. It consists of a series of en 
echelon, steeply-dipping ore shoots plunging westward (260°) at 20 to 25 degrees. The ore 
shoots above the 525 foot level were partially to completely mined out from 1947 to 1949. These 
shoots averaged 10 to 15 metres thick, 15 to 20 metres wide, and 65 metres long. The largest 
shoot defined was 30 metres thick, 30 metres wide and 150 metres long. 
 
The B-Zone mineralized shoots are composed of a complex pattern (stockwork) of quartz-
tourmaline veins and altered pyritic fractured wall rock. The individual veins and fracture zones 
range in thickness from 10 centimetres to 3 metres and appear to have a maximum strike length 
of 20 metres (66 feet). Three main vein sets have been observed in the B-Zone: 
 

1. Striking east with shallow to steep north dips 
2. Striking east with shallow south dips 
3. Striking north with shallow west dips 

 
All three vein sets carry gold. Their relative ages have not been determined. These vein sets are 
believed to occupy oblique extension fractures. All quartz veins and altered facture zones 
terminate within two metres of the B-diorite contacts. 
A petrographic analysis of the B-Zone veins by Sauvé in 1985 indicated that they consist of 
quartz with minor carbonate, tourmaline, pyrite, and chalcopyrite. The carbonate and tourmaline 
are most abundant near vein margins. The adjacent wall rock is chloritized, silicified, and 
sericitized. 
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 28 
 
 
The sulphide content of the veins ranges from 1% to 20%, and consists of euhedral pyrite, 
chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite (as inclusions in pyrite), traces of molybdenite, and marcasite and 
telluro-bismuthinite as rare inclusions in pyrite. Gold occurs as 5 to 25 micron inclusions in pyrite 
and as fine grained disseminations in quartz vein micro fractures. 
 
Recent exploration has investigated the potential down-plunge extension of the B-Zone below the 
525 foot level. Significant B-Zone veining and gold mineralization has been outlined to the 825 
foot level by underground diamond-drilling. This mineralization appears to have the same 
characteristics as that previously mined: i.e. mineralization occurs within plunging shoots, 
irregular veining and alteration patterns, and steep dips. One narrow shoot is interpreted as 
being north-dipping (as opposed to the habitual south dips). This anomalous feature could be 
explained as being an isolated north-dipping quartz-tourmaline vein or altered facture zone. 
 
8.2.2 A-Zone 
 
The A-Zone occurs within the A-diorite, south of the Main Porphyry. Significant gold 
mineralization within the A-Zone occurs in three different modes; a) small stockwork, b) 
000/042°W quartz-tourmaline-pyrite veins, and c) 090/065°S quartz-tourmaline-pyrite veins. 
 
Small stockwork of quartz-tourmaline-carbonate-pyrite veins occur as isolated occurrences within 
the A-diorite. They make up less than 10% of the total gold-bearing structures in the A-Zone. It 
is possible that these "stockwork-like" areas are simply the result of the irregular overlapping and 
subsequent folding of the irregular overlapping and subsequent folding of the 090/065°S and 
000/042°W vein sets. 
 
The 000/042°W quartz-pyrite veins have been defined to a maximum vertical depth of 140 
metres. They have a strike length of approximately 20 metres but the dip length is considerably 
longer (250 metres). They occur only in the A-diorite and are bounded by the Main Porphyry to 
the north and agglomerated units to the south. The veins consist of quartz with tourmaline and 
chlorite as distinct bands. Up to 2% pyrite occurs as fine grained disseminations along mafic 
bands and vein boundaries. A later set of near vertical dipping veinlets and fractures occurs 
across the west dipping veins. No alteration or shearing is evident in the host diorite. Up to 10% 
coarse grained pyrite is common in wall rock adjacent to the veining. The 000/042°W veins 
appear to have been introduced into a brittle fractured diorite with a dominate north-south 
striking west dipping joint set. 
 
The 090/065°W south dipping veins occur in the A-diorite but below the 000/042°W Vein 
Domain. These south dipping veins were the target of most of the previous mining in the A-Zone. 
They are irregular in character and consist of quartz-tourmaline-chlorite-pyrite. The host diorite 
is weakly foliated but does appear to be sheared. The veins and associated gold mineralization 
plunge 020° to 025° west, as is the case for all gold-bearing structures on the Simkar Property. 
 
The potential for increased reserves in the A-Zone is high. Scattered drill intercepts along strike 
and at depth have encountered favourable structure and gold values. 
 
8.2.3 C-Zone 
 
The C-Zone is situated approximately 200 metres south of the shaft in the East-A diorites. It 
consists of a 10 centimetre to 70 centimetre thick sulphide-filled fracture zone within a narrow 
(two metre thick) shear zone (C-Zone Shear). This shear zone strikes 070°, dips at 090°, and 
has a minimum strike length of 200 metres. The C-Zone Shear may represent an auxiliary 
structure to the dominant East Zone Shear to the north. 
 
A petrographic study of the C-Zone indicated that it consists of coarse aggregate vein quartz and 
carbonate with 3-5% chlorite and accessory biotite and rutile-leucoxene. The sulphide 
assemblage consists of up to 85% pyrite, 5% chalcopyrite, and ilmenite with trace gold and 
electrum. 
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 29 
 
 
Previous C-Zone exploration and production was concentrated between the 375 foot and 225 foot 
levels. A drift on the 375 foot level followed the C-Zone Shear for a length of 170 metres and 
defined gold mineralization for a length of 145 metres. Sampling of this drift in 1988 indicated 
that only 53.60 metres of this drift actually contains economic gold mineralization. Two sections 
of drift yielded (34.29 g/tonne Au cut) 5.35 g/t Au over 1. 22 m for a length of 18.60 metres, 
and 6.92 g/t Au over 1. 33 m for a length of 35.00 metres. 
 
The economic gold mineralization within the C-Zone Shear probably plunges approximately 20° 
west. This 20° plunge is common to the gold-bearing zones on the Property. 
 
There has been no serious exploration up or down the presumed plunge in the C-Zone Shear. 
One deep drill hole (number unknown) on the 675 foot level confirms the presence of the C-Zone 
Shear and assayed 8.57 g/t Au over 0.41 m. 
 
8.2.4 Pillar Zone 
 
The Pillar Zone occurs within the A-diorite at a vertical depth of 205 metres, in the down plunge 
projection of the upper A-Zones. It consists of numerous sub-zones (P Main, P1, P2, P3, and P4) 
but these will be discussed as a whole. 
 
On the 675 foot level, the Pillar Zone occurs as a series of northeast-striking, north-dipping 
fracture zones which have been strongly altered and impregnated by quartz-tourmaline veinlets. 
The zone occurs only in the A-diorite and is bounded to the north by the Main Porphyry. 
Alteration consists of carbonatization, minor silicification, and tourmalization. Up to 10% pyrite 
occurs as fine grained subhedral disseminations within the alteration envelope. 
 
The Pillar Zone plunges westward at 20° and has been defined from the 675 foot level to a 
vertical depth of 300 metres. At this point the Pillar Zone appears to pinch out. 
 
Drill holes completed beyond this termination in the A-diorite did not intersect Pillar zone-type 
mineralization but did encounter significant A-Zone mineralization. This deeper A-Zone 
mineralization appears to occur in near vertical to slightly south dipping fracture zones. It is 
characterized by quartz-tourmaline-carbonate veins within intensely altered diorite. Up to 5% 
pyrite occurs as fine to medium grained disseminations. The actual style of mineralization 
resembles the Pillar Zone (i.e. altered diorite with abundant pyrite) but its structure is different 
(i.e. possible vertical dipping versus shallowly north dipping). Further drilling at depth in this area 
is warranted as gold grades are slightly higher than those in the upper part of the A-diorite. 
 
8.2.5 B-A Deformation Feature 
 
The B-Zone shoots occur north of the Main Porphyry in the B-diorite, whereas the A and Pillar 
zones occur south of the Main Porphyry in the A-Diorite. 
 
The A, B and Pillar zones all occur within a structural unit that strikes 096° and dips south at 45° 
to 55°. The ore zones within the structural unit plunge west at 261°/20°. 
The Deformation Feature ranges in thickness from 8 to 25 metres and has a confirmed strike 
length of 600 metres. It strikes and dips discordantly to the contacts. 
 
The Main Porphyry is thinner where the Deformation Feature crosses it. This thinning suggests 
that the porphyry failed by shearing to the deformation stress whereas the development of 
stockwork-type veins in the diorites indicates a response by fracturing. This fracturing response 
to the deformation provided an excellent location for the development of the veining and gold 
mineralization. The lack of significant veining in the porphyry is a result of its ductile response to 
the deformation. Folding of some of the veining represents the effect of a later regional 
deformation. 
 
 
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 30 
 
 
Scattered drill hole intersections up and down dip along this B-A Deformation Feature or trend 
have encountered significant gold values in the Northern Volcanics and Southern Agglomerates. 
Further exploration of this feature may locate additional reserves. 
 
A structural analysis of the Simkar Property by Hugon in 1988 suggested that other similar 
structures to that of the B-A Deformation Feature may occur since such features are commonly 
repeated on a regular spacing. The B-A Deformation Feature and the East Zone Shear have 
similar attitudes and are now believed to be two major parallel structures (deformation zones) 
crossing the Simkar Property. Where these two structures cross favourable diorite units, veining 
with gold mineralization can be expected. The potential in other rock units (agglomerate) 
traversed by these structures appears reasonable in view of the many "ore-grade" drill 
intersections obtained to date. 
 
8.2.6 East Zone Shear 
 
The East Zone Shear is located approximately 350 metres east of the Simkar shaft. It has a 
minimum strike length of 850 metres and has been traced to a vertical depth of at least 200 
metres. It strikes discordantly across the East diorite at 90 0 to 100 0 with dips ranging from 55° 
to 85° south. At a depth of approximately 200 metres it crosses into the southern sequence of 
flows and pyroclastics. The East Zone Shear has an average thickness of six metres but shows 
pinch and swell characteristics. Foliation is well developed and commonly undulating both along 
strike and at depth. 
 
Three gold-bearing zones have been defined: the East Zone, Lavallee Zone, and the Beauchemin 
zone. 
 
The East Zone occurs between sections 8000E and 8320E. It consists of three westerly plunging 
(25°) ore shoots, each carrying up to three quartz-tourmaline-pyrite veins and numerous narrow 
extensional veinlets. The veins have irregular thicknesses (from 0.15 metres to 1.50 metres) and 
commonly show boudinage. They dip parallel to the East Zone Shear and locally show evidence 
of a later deformation within the shear zone (brecciation and folding). Wall rock between the 
individual veins is typically silicified, well foliated and pyritized. Up to 90% pyrite and chalcopyrite 
occur within the veins. Galena, sphalerite, and bismuth telluride occur in trace amounts. The gold 
mineralization typically occurs within a pyrite host as rounded inclusions or as pyrite boundary 
fillings. Gold also occurs as interstitial fillings between quartz and carbonate. 
 
The largest defined ore shoot (E4) is 250 metres long, 30 metres wide and 1.52 metres thick. 
Two other parallel shoots have been defined. The potential for the existence of similar ore shoots 
to the east is good. The East Zone Shear is believed to extend eastward for 750 metres to the 
Lapaska boundary. 
 
The Lavallee Zone is located in the East Zone Shear immediately west of the East Zone ore 
shoots. Only limited exploration has been directed towards the Lavallee Zone. On the 375 level a 
strike length of 26.60 metres of sub economic mineralization was encountered averaging 3.56 g/t 
Au over 1.24 m (34.29 g/tonne Au cut) or 2.89 g/t Au over 1.24 m (17.14 g/tonne Au cut). The 
Lavallee Zone on the 375 level is a steep dipping quartz-pyrite vein within a sheared quartz-
porphyry dyke. 
 
Above the level the vein disappears but the fracture set continues. No drilling has been 
completed to evaluate the up- or down-plunge potential. 
 
The Beauchemin Zone occurs approximately 500 metres west of the East Zone. The Beauchemin 
Zone consists of two quartz-carbonate vein-alteration zones within sheared and fractured diorite. 
The mineralization trends parallel to the weak foliation, striking 092° and dipping 73° south. Up 
to 10% fine grained pyrite occurs within the veins and associated alteration holes. Sampling of 
the drift and raise did not obtain economic gold values. Further exploration of this zone may be 
warranted. 
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 31 
 
 
8.2.7 F-Zone 
 
The F-Zone occurs within the East Zone Shear where the shear crosses into the agglomerates. 
The F-Zone has been cut by three drill holes. The host rock is agglomerate, in contrast to the 
diorites which act as host rocks for the rest of the ore bodies on the Property. 
 
The fact that the East Zone Shear contains significant gold mineralization in both diorite and 
agglomerate greatly enhances the exploration potential of this structure. The F-Zone is 
characterized by quartz-tourmaline shear veins occurring within weakly sheared, highly fractured 
agglomerate. Up to 3% pyrite occurs as medium to fine grained disseminations. Traces of 
chalcopyrite have also been noted. No pyrite mineralization has been seen in the wall rock. 
 
8.2.8 Montana Zone 
 
The Montana Zone is characterized by mineralized surface showings near the breakthrough point 
of ventilation raise 224-C. This surface gold showing is represented by sulphide burns in diorite 
bordering a crosscutting feldspar porphyry dyke. The showing had been sampled by the M.E.R. 
(Ministere Energie et Ressources) and returned the following values: 0.18, 1.53 and 0.54 oz. 
gold per ton across 2, 3 and 3 feet. It was later re-sampled by Chris Davis (Davis, 1989), in the 
summer of 1988 and a grab sample returned an assay of 57.50 grams / tonne gold over 1.07 
metres (1.58 oz. gold/ton over 3.5 feet). 
 
This showing had always been thought to represent surface outcropping of the C-Zone, a near 
vertical massive sulphide lens approximately 5-8 inches in width, which had been worked from 
underground in 1949. The fall 1989 surface diamond core drilling program however has 
discredited this theory, proving instead that the C-Zone pinches out approximately fifty (50) 
metres below surface. 
It was then decided, in 1990, to investigate this small sulphide stringer through a tight grid of 
shallow surface diamond-drill holes in order to explore the possibility of extracting the narrow 
vein using an open cut surface mining method. 
 
As drilling progressed however, two other narrow mineralized veins were intersected south of the 
original zone, later named the Montana Zone. The other two veins, south of the Montana Zone 
were named the Idaho and Utah Zones. 
 
These narrow mineralized veins are approximately ten (10) metres apart, sub-parallel and dip 
steeply to the south. They are characterized by their high sulphide content (mostly pyrite with 
minor chalcopyrite), narrow widths and are almost always associated with the presence of 
carbonate alteration. All three zones occur within a strongly magnetic, non-sheared diorite sill 
which in turn is bordered by a feldspar porphyry dyke to the north, and intermediate tuffaceous 
volcanics to the south. 
 
The most prominent of the three zones, the Montana Zone, has been traced out for a strike 
length of forty-five (45) metres and down to a depth of sixty (60) metres. It remains open to the 
east and at depth. The Utah and Idaho Zones, however, remain open to the east, west and to 
depth. 
 
8.2.9  East Boundary Zone 
 
Surface diamond-drilling on Sigma Mines' Lapaska property adjacent to the eastern boundary 
located a quartz-impregnated fracture system similar to that of the B-Zone ore shoots. 
Significant intersections from the three completed drill holes included; 10.63 g/t Au over 1.00 m, 
18.86 g/t Au over 0.55 m, and 9.60 g/t Au over 3.05 m. 
 
Two drill holes put down by Louvicourt Goldfields Corporation in this area encountered a large 
diorite sill with some porphyry. Trace gold values were obtained from the sill. An intersection of 
2.40 g/t Au over 1.52 m was obtained from immediately adjacent mafic agglomerate. 
 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 32 
 
 
Approximately 930 metres of this favourable diorite-porphyry complex has yet to be explored on 
the Simkar Property. 
 
8.2.10  Western Boundary Zone 
 
A diamond-drill program was completed by El Sol Gold Mines Limited immediately west of the 
Simkar Property in 1947. It encountered numerous economic gold intersections. These 
intersections occur within apparently north-south striking, west dipping quartz-tourmaline veins 
ranging in thickness from 0.50 metres to 3 metres. These veins occur in diorite between a depth 
of 244 metres (800 feet) and 510 metres (2000 feet). The Zone may represent the down plunge 
continuation of the Simkar Property A-Zone mineralization. 
 
The best intersections from the El Sol diamond-drilling include; 11.55 g/t Au over 2.13 m, 8.23 
g/t Au over 2.74 m, 4.80 g/t Au over 5.49 m, 9.60 g/t Au over 1.83 m, 24.69 g/t Au over 1.52 
m, and 16.46 g/t Au over 1.22 m. 
 
On September 20, 1982, C. E. Page, Chief Geologist for Tex-Sol Explorations Ltd. (formerly El Sol 
Gold Mines Limited) published in a memorandum an ore reserve for the Tex-Sol structures of 
50 000 tons averaging 0.33 ounces per ton (Bubar, 1988). Three holes were put down by Ronrico 
in 1987 to test the area up-plunge from the Tex-Sol mineralization. Only minor veining was 
encountered as the drill holes deviated away from the projected target area. 
 
8.2.11  Base-metal Mineralization 
 
There are indications that the volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) type mineralization, similar 
to Noranda, might be present along the northern perimeter of Simkar concession. The rhyolitic 
volcanic horizon within the Val-d'Or Formation (part of the Malartic Group) appears to be hosting 
volcanogenic massive sulphides. The area in question, Colombière, lies along the northern 
perimeter of the Property and encouraging results were achieved by Megastar in 1997. Only five 
drill holes had been completed on this target to date. Possible analogies to the geology and 
mineralization at the Matagami VMS camp would also need to be investigated.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY* 
 
*The following applies to the sample preparation, analyses and security protocols that 
were established and followed by MRB & Associates, for Megastar Development Corp. 
and Eloro Resources Ltd., during Eloro's tenure as Property operators.  
 
Sample preparation was performed at ALS-Chemex, whereby upon reception, the samples were 
dried, weighed, crushed and pulverized before analysis.  
 
ALS Chemex has attained ISO 9001:2000 registration at all of its laboratories. In North America, 
ALS are accredited to ISO 9001:2000, which requires evidence of a quality management system 
covering all aspects of the organisation. To ensure compliance with this system regular internal 
audits are undertaken by staff members specially trained in auditing techniques. In addition, ALS 
Chemex is currently working towards accreditation to ISO 17025, which provides specific 
assessment of our laboratories' analytical competence for specific analytical techniques. The 
combination of the two ISO standards provides clients complete assurance regarding the quality 
of every aspect of ALS Chemex operations.  
 
Core from Megastar's 2007 and Eloro's 2010-2012 diamond-drill programmes were logged, and 
sample intervals selected, by independent consulting geologists working for MRB & Associates. 
Core intervals that required sampling were marked off and tagged. Sample intervals were a 
minimum of 0.3 metres long and a maximum of 1.5 metres long and respected any lithological 
contacts. Core cutting was conducted by an MRB Technician using a rock saw. Approximately half 
of the core was bagged for assay purposes, and the remaining half placed back in the core box 
with its duplicate sample tag for future reference purposes. The submitted sample included both 
pieces of core and fines, carefully collected and placed in a plastic bag and sealed. After each 
sample, the Technician cleaned the area to avoid any cross contamination between samples. 
Individually bagged samples were placed in rice shipping bags, secured and dropped-off at ALS 
Laboratories for analysis.  
 
From 2007 to 2013, MRB logged 69 diamond-drill holes for Megastar and Eloro, and collected a 
total of 10,140 samples, including duplicates, blanks and standards, that were submitted to ALS 
Chemex of Val-d'Or, Quebec for gold assaying, using a standard 30 gram fire assay with an AA 
finish. No aspect of the sample preparation was conducted by an employee, officer, director or 
associate of Eloro or Megastar. 
 
All logging and sampling work was supervised by Qualified Persons as defined by NI 43-101. The 
Author considers that the core sampling, security of samples, sample preparation and analysis 
programmes were conducted in a satisfactory method and meet the standards set out in NI-43-
101. The adequacy of any reported values prior to 2007 is unknown as no discussions exists as 
per sample preparation, security and analytical procedures.  
 
The reader is referred to previous 43-101 Technical Reports (Pelletier, 2004; Bourgoin and 
Sandefur, 2008; Kramo, 2010), available on SEDAR (http://www.sedar.com/), for details of 
sample preparation, analysis and security from previous programmes completed on the Property. 
 
The Author is not aware of any drilling, sampling or recovery factors that would impact the 
reliability of results reported from the assayed drill core.

12.0  DATA VERIFICATION 
 
MRB has confirmed that the assaying procedure and results listed in the diamond-drill logs are 
conformable with standard procedures. 
 
MRB collected and analysed a total of 8,352 samples during three programs drilling (2010-2012) 
 
MBS's samples were collected and transported to the ALS Chemex assay laboratory of Val-d'Or 
for analyses.  
 
No bulk-density (specific gravity) tests have been performed on the Simkar mineralized zones. A 
value of 2.70 g/cm3 (tonnes/m3), based on theoretical densities and practices in mines exploiting 
similar mineralization in the region, was used to calculate their Inferred Resource estimate. 
 
A review of all the pertinent and available Assessment files (GM's) has been completed. MRB has 
reviewed the reports containing information on the Simkar Property and believes the information 
to be accurate.  
 
The author believes the sampling, sampling preparation, security, and analytical procedures to be 
adequate and is not aware of any sampling problems that would impact the accuracy and 
reliability of the assay results. The Author has not independently verified any other data included 
in report from previous exploration programs. 

12.1 Analysis of Quality Control Data from Assay results 
 
The current sampling and QAQC procedures for this project were set up by MRB & Associates.  
 
The QAQC routine program for the Simkar project includes the use of Certified Standard 
Reference Materials (CSRM), blanks and duplicates. 
 
QAQC procedure Routine (2010 -2013):  
A comprehensive QAQC program was carried out since 2010 by MRB. For every 75 samples sent 
to the laboratory, the following QAQC materials were inserted: 
 

1. three of the six (6) utilized standards, issued from the internationally certified Rock Labs 
laboratory, having values of 1.027, 1.760, 1.780, 5.909, 5.867 and 8.685 gpt, 
respectively; 

2. three blanks (composed of crushed decorative marble gravel) to test for analytical 
contamination and validate detection limits; 

3. three pulp-duplicate samples to help estimate the precision of the various sample 
preparation steps. 

 
For every 75 samples, there were nine (9) QAQC samples introduced into the sample stream that 
was submitted to ALS. The QAQC samples were inserted at regular intervals within the sample 
batch. A total of 291 CSRM standards, 235 blanks and 209 pulp duplicates, representing 9.18% 
of total sample submissions from the 2010 to 2012 drilling programs, were submitted. 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 36 
 

12.2 CSRM Standards  
 
A total of 291 CSRM standards were included within all the samples sent to the laboratory. The 
summary statistics for the standards used during the current study and the assigned grades are 
displayed in Table 12-1.

SG56 1.027 0.03 37 0.998 0.967 to 1.087 86.49% 

  
The data from Table 12-1 shows that 92.6% of all assayed standards passed the ±2 standard 
deviation test. Ideally, for optimal accuracy, 95% of all the samples should pass the test. 
Nevertheless, the bulk of standards show a reasonable accuracy even though SG56 is clearly 
below expectations. 
 
When comparing the mean values provided by ALS Chemex with the expected values, the 
averages are very close, indicating that the data gathered since 2010 is accurate and can be 
used to generate a mineral resources estimate. 

12.3 Blanks  
 
MRB has utilised one type of blank into the QAQC routine procedure to test the potential 
contamination at different sample preparation stages. A total of 235 blanks were submitted to 
ALS Chemex from the 2010 to 2012 drilling programs, (Figure 12-1). From these, 94.89% 
returned results lower than twice the detection limit (0.02 gpt). Twelve samples returned assay 
values higher than the detection limit but were not greater than 0.1 g/t. Although two samples 
were greater than 0.02g/t with very little contamination and should not be a problem for the 
estimated resource.

The red circle indicates the 2 values over the detection limit. 
 

12.4 Coarse-pulp duplicates: 
 
In all, 209 pulp samples were re-assayed by ALS Chemex. The mean of the re-assays is 0.20 
gpt, whereas the mean of the original assays was 0.19 gpt - yielding a 96% coefficient of 
correlation. The result demonstrates the ability of the laboratory to replicate the global average 
despite some discrepancies for the individual assays. A scatter plot (Figure 12-2) shows the 
correlation between the first and second analyses.

12.5 SUMMARY OF QAQC ANALYSES  
 
Based on the data provided by the employed QAQC procedures, the Simkar Project shows 
acceptable results, notwithstanding minor discrepancies with a few individual pulp assays, which 
is typical for nugget-type gold deposits, especially where visible gold is present. 
 
Going forward, it is the Author's opinion that a rigorous industry standard QAQC procedure 
should be implemented during the insertion of control samples into the stream of core samples 
for the Simkar Project. The Author also strongly recommends that the assays of blank, standard 
and duplicate samples be monitored by means of control charts rather than manually, and he 
further recommends that a fixed percentage of samples should be sent to a secondary 
laboratory, during future drilling programs, in order to confirm the results, as no details have 
been supplied from any external laboratory checks since 2010.  
 
The statistics of the CSRM are within the industry standard threshold limits and are considered 
accurate. The level of contamination appears very low as the blank samples do not display any 
evidence of significant contamination. The coarse-pulp duplicates show a slight negative bias for 
some standards when compared to the expected value of these standards. The Author is of the 
opinion that the employed QAQC program was sufficient to support the mineral resources 
reported herein.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING  
 
Neither Monarques nor Eloro have undertaken any metallurgical investigations of the Simkar 
Project gold mineralization.  
 
Historic mineral processing, metallurgical and recovery studies and results were reported by 
Pelletier (2004), as reproduced below with minor edits. 
 

Historical data reports, at the end of the mining in July 1949 after processing a total of 
261,591 tonnes of mill-feed and production of 31,915 ounces of gold, an equivalent to 
0.123 oz/t of gold grade recovered. The records indicate that the average head grade was 
0.135 oz/t gold for that period which translates to the hydro-metallurgical recovery rates 
of 90%. 
 
During the month of June 1989, a total of 9,759 tons of Simkar mineralization was 
processed at Aurizon Mines Ltd. Beacon mill facility. This tonnage included 7,096 tons of 
development muck from 375 and 525 East zone drift, all the East Zone raises (i.e., 822, 
825, 830) and limited muck from the shaft spill pocket, and 2,663 tons of muck from the 
375 and 525 East Zone sub-drifts. These sub-drifts were kept to a mining width of 1.22 to 
1.52 metres. 
 
The Beacon mill is a conventional cyanidation mill with a daily capacity of 750 tons per 
day. The Simkar mineralization was batch-processed at a maximum daily rate of 550 tons 
per day. Only muck from Simkar was processed at the mill during the Simkar bulk test. 
According to Baker (1990), "the bulk sample test indicated that the East Zone 
mineralization is amenable to a straight cyanidation process and the grade can be 
successfully estimated utilizing the muck and chip sample programs initiated during the 
1989 program. The grade estimated in the ore reserve calculation for the East Zone 
compares favourably with the mill results for the sub-drift muck pile". However, Baker did 
not mentioned in this report the mile head grade, the final calculated mill grade nor the 
recovery. 
 
In April 1991, 6,000 tonnes of material grading 0.29 oz/t was shipped to the Ferderber 
processing facility for treatment. Exploration and mining tests ceased in March 1992. No 
details on the milled grade and on the recovery were found in the reports. 

 
No milling or metallurgical testing has been done on the Simkar Property for base metals.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES  

14.1 Data  
Eloro resources began exploration on the Simkar Project deposit in 2009. In total, Eloro drilled 
23,779 m in 54 holes and collected 8,352 samples for assay (Table 14-1).  

14.2 Modelling  
 
All modelling done for this resource estimate was performed by MRB based on the drill-hole 
database supplied to MRB by Eloro. The modelling of the mineralized zones, topographic and 
overburden surfaces was carried out using GEMS 6.5 software. 

14.2.2 Mineralization modelling  
 
Based on a cut-off of 3 g Au/t, five individual zones (A, B, C, D and South) were modelled. As the 
mineralized zones are often closely associated, spatially, with so-called porphyry dykes, the local 
geology was also used to delineate the mineralized zones. The porphyry dykes cross-cut (i.e., are 
younger than) the gabbro–diorite intrusions. Mineralization is associated with two of the porphyry 
dykes. Figure 14-1 shows the location of the mineralized zones (isometric and view), whereas 
Figure 14-2 and Figure 14-3 are cross-sections (looking East) of the deposit. 

14.2.3 Surface topography and overburden  
 
MRB & Associates constructed a 3-D wireframe model of the surface topography based upon 
topographic pick-up of the drill-hole collars of the Simkar project. The wireframe model is in 
reasonable agreement with the drill-hole collars and provides a good representation of the 
predominantly flat, low-lying terrain in the immediate vicinity of the Project. Although not strictly 
accurate, the depth of overburden was taken as the length of the casing used for the hole; 
however, the difference between the length of hole-casing and the true depth of overburden is 
not considered material for this study. The bedrock and topographic surfaces should nonetheless 
be refined with additional data for more detailed modelling.  

14.3 Underground development and stopes  
 
The digital modelling of the underground stopes for the Simkar project, was completed using an 
extrusion technique, for intersecting solids. The cartographic figures of the underground raises 
were not available, instead the opening design combined with the opening of longitudinal design 
were used to reconstruct a three dimensional volume of each stope. This method provided the 
best representative approximation of the volume of the stopes. 
 
A shortcoming of this method is that the inclinations of the stopes are not well represented. 
Subsequent to the modelling of the mineralized zones, some of the modelled stopes were 
modified to reflect their chronicled inclination.  
 
Representations of the underground galleries were generated by digitizing the contour map and 
extruding a constant height of 2.5 metres. The elevation of the drifts was deduced from section 
and longitudinal maps. The main drive levels were modelled along with the underground stopes.

14.4 Statistical Analysis  

14.4.1 General Statistics and Grade Capping 
 
As a standard industry practice, designed to reduce the influence of statistically anomalous 
sample data on resource estimations, higher-grade assay values are typically capped, prior to 
compositing, at levels determined by various means, including examination of probability 
distribution data.  
 
For the Simkar Project, log-normal probability curves were produced for all gold assays 
located within each mineralized zone in order to examine the distributions of the data. Both 
drill data and underground sampling data exhibit strong positive skews with exceptionally long 
tails and maximum assay values well beyond the standard deviations. 
 
Sample assays were capped at values that coincided with inflection points on the high end of 
the probability curves. Setting maximum assay values reduced the average Au assay grades 
for compositing. Appendix I, includes a summary, by zone, of capping levels and assay 
statistics. 

14.4.2 Compositing  
 
Prior to the undertaking of a statistical analysis, the samples were composited into equal 
lengths to yield constant-volume samples. 
 
MRB analyzed the mean-length of the drill-hole samples in order to determine appropriate 
composite lengths, the results of the study for vein samples indicated that 0.8 m composite 
length was optimal. 
 
In summary, MRB has used 0.8 m composites within the gold mineralisation model for all 
subsequent statistical, geostatistical and grade interpolation 

14.6 Variography  
 
Variography was completed for the gold samples contained within each mineralized zone. The 
variogram for each mineralized zone was plotted and an autofit routine was run to determine 
an approximate curve fit. The results of the variography in the unfolded X-Y plane (Table 14-
2), were used to determine the search parameters for grade estimation.  
 
Grade variography was generated and modelled in preparation for the estimation of gold 
grades. The variography was completed based directly on the 1.0 m down-hole composite 
data. A standard approach was used to generate and model the variography for each of the 
domains:  

1. Examination of the orientations and dips of the solids representing the domains to be 
studied to help in the determination of the axes of better continuity; 

2. Generate and model the down-hole direction variogram, which allows the determination 
of the nugget effect (closed spaced variability); 

3. Calculate and model the major-, semi-major and minor-axes of continuity.  
 
Figure 14-5 shows an example of the orientation of a search ellipse (in Zone C) based on the 
variography study. It is noteworthy that the rake established by the search ellipse corresponds 
to the rake of mineralization.

14.7 Block Modelling 
  
A block model was constructed using the GEMS (version 6.5) database. Block model 
parameters are summarized in Table 14-3. The block dimension (10 m X 1 m X 10 m) is 
based on the existing drilling pattern (25 m X 25 m) and the former-mine planning 
considerations.

14.8 Grade Estimation Methodology  
 
For the Simkar Project, an ordinary Kriging algorithm was used for the primary estimate within 
anisotropic elliptical search ranges (where appropriate) and using suitable parameters. The 
search distances used for the estimates are based upon an expansion factor of the semi-



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 49 
 

variogram ranges. Individual searches have been specified for each data field, GEMS 6.5 
software was used for the estimates. The grade estimates were generated using 0.8 m core-
length composites. The blocks that are included in one particular zone are estimated only with 
the composites coded within that zone. The estimated ordinary Kriging ("OK") have been done 
using the sample search parameters shown in Table 14-6.

First pass: minimum of 6 and maximum of 35 composites collected within a search ellipse that 
corresponds to the range of the first structure identified by variographic studies (generally 
<30 m for the major axis). A maximum of two composites per drill-hole were used for any 
single block estimate.  
 
Second pass: minimum of 3 and maximum of 35 composites within a search ellipse large 
enough to estimate all blocks within the mineralized zones. Notably, the D Zone composite 
minimum is 1, whereas the composite maximum is 75.

14.9 Grade Estimate Validation  
 
Validation of the interpolation techniques and resulting block model included, but were 
not limited to, the following: 

• Point validation using kriging and inverse distance cubed; 
• Visual inspection of the block grades in comparison to surrounding data values; 
• Comparison of block and sample means. 

14.9.1 Composites vs interpolated block  
 
Block grade estimates for the remaining resources were compared with sample composite 
grades. Table 14-7 presents the average grade of the cut 0.8 m composites and of the blocks 
interpolated for each individual zone of the deposit.  

 
Table 14-7: Comparison Between Composites and Interpolated (OK-Model) Blocks 

 
 
A slight difference was observed between the Mean-Grade-Composites and Mean-Grade-OK-
Model values for the A Zone, B Zone and C Zone, but not for the South Zone or D Zone. These 
values should normally be equal for all zones. In the case of the A Zone, B Zone and C Zone, 
the average Composite values are higher than the average OK-Model values because the 
volume occupied by the stopes were not included in the OK-Model calculations. 

14.9.2 Classification  
 
MRB has considered sampling density and distance from samples in order to classify the 
mineral resource according to the terminology, definitions and guidelines given in the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Standards on Mineral Resources 
and Mineral Reserves, as required by NI 43-101. 
 
Data quality, drill-hole spacing and the interpreted continuity of grades controlled by the veins 
and mineralized-shoots have allowed MRB to classify parts of the veins in the Measured, 
Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource categories respectively.  
 
It is becoming increasingly common practice to apply some basic economic considerations to 
determine which part of the Mineral Resource has reasonable prospects for economic

extraction by underground mining methods. To define the economic part of the Mineral 
Resource at Simkar, MRB has assumed a grade of 3.0 g/t to be required over a minimum 
mining width of 1.6 m. These parameters pared areas of lower grade material within thinner 
parts of the vein-systems from the resulting estimate. A comparison of the resulting areas 
where resources can be defined, to the historic mined areas, shows a strong correlation. 

14.10 Resource Estimate  
 
Table 14-8 presents the resource estimate at 2.0 gpt, 3.0 gpt and 4.0 gpt cut-offs for the 
different mineralized zones using the ordinary Kriging model.

**Cautionary note: Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral 
Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be 
upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration. 
The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, 
legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues. Also, mineral 
resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. There 
are no mineral reserves presently identified for the Simkar deposit.  
 
 
15.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 
The mineral Resources reported herein are contained entirely within the Simkar Property. 
 
Geological information from other mines and prospects in the adjacent parts of the Abitibi Belt 
have been used to aid in formulation of geological ideas and target concepts. 
 
 
16.0 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 
 
The authors are not aware of any additional information, the exclusion of which would tend to 
make this report misleading. 
 
 
17.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
Recent work on the Simkar Project has confirmed that the formerly explored and exploited 
gold bearing structures on these properties continue to show potential for hosting additional 
mineralization, and merit additional exploration work.  
 
The resources were estimated using ordinary kriging and a parallel estimate was conducted 
using the inverse distance squared method as a check. The majority of the resource has been 



 2013 Technical Report - Simkar Gold Property 52 
 

classified as Inferred; more drilling information is judged necessary to identify Indicated and 
Measured resources. 
 
The block size dimension (10 m X 1 m X 10 m) was based on the existing drilling pattern and 
mine planning considerations.  
 
Although there are some discrepancies for the individual pulp re-assays, the QAQC program 
employed for the Simkar Project was more than adequate.  
 
 
18.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
Based on his review of the Simkar Project, the author makes the following recommendations:  

 Phase I - additional diamond-drilling should be carried out with a concurrent, thorough 
sampling protocol, to expand the estimated Mineral Resources and provide core 
material for initial metallurgical testing, which will help to determine the characteristics 
of the mineralized zones;  

 Phase II - Additional diamond-drilling to further increase the resource volume and to 
upgrade Inferred Resources to the Indicated category. Supplementary metallurgical 
testing and bulk sampling to determine  potential processing and recovery scenarios. 

 
A diamond-drilling campaign that will qualify as part of the Phase I recommended programme 
is currently underway on the Project, pursuant to the active Joint Venture agreement between 
Monarques and Eloro. The current campaign, which is expected to be completed by mid-
December 2013, is budgeted at $750,000, of which approximately $600,000 has been 
expended.  
 
The recommended Phase II exploration programme is contingent on favourable results from 
the Phase I programme. Table 18-1 shows a budget for the recommended Phase I and Phase 
II programs.
