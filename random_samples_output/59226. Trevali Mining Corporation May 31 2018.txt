1 SUMMARY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by Trevali Mining Corporation (Trevali) to 

prepare an independent Technical Report on the Perkoa underground zinc mine (Perkoa), 

located in Burkina Faso, which is operated by Nantou Mining Burkina Faso S.A. (Nantou 

Mining).  Trevali holds a 90% interest in Nantou Mining while the Burkina Faso State holds a 

10% interest, in accordance with the Mining Code.  The purpose of this report is to support the 

disclosure of the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates prepared by Nantou Mining 

and reviewed by RPA as of December 31, 2017.  This Technical Report conforms to NI 43-

101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  RPA visited the property from January 15 

to January 18, 2018. 

 

Trevali is a zinc focused, base metals mining company with four commercially producing 

operations.  Trevali is actively producing zinc and lead-silver concentrates from its 2,000 tonne 

per day (tpd) Santander mine in Peru, its 3,000 tpd Caribou mine in the Bathurst Mining Camp 

of northern New Brunswick, Canada, and its 2,000 tpd Rosh Pinah mine in Namibia.  

 

The Perkoa underground zinc mine and milling operation is located in the Sanguié Province, 

120 km west of the capital city of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.  The Perkoa mine has been in 

operation since 2012 and currently produces zinc concentrates at a nominal processing rate 

of 2,000 tpd.   

 

On August 31, 2017, Trevali finalized definitive agreements with Glencore International PLC 

(Glencore) and certain of its subsidiaries whereby Trevali acquired a portfolio of zinc assets 

from Glencore, including a 90% interest in the Perkoa mine. 

 

Perkoa Mineral Resources, estimated as at December 31, 2017, are summarized in Table 1- 1.

CONCLUSIONS 
Based on a site visit, discussion with Nantou Mining personnel, and review of available 

documentation, RPA offers the following interpretations and conclusions. 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 

• The geology and mineralization is well understood by Nantou Mining geology 
personnel. 
 

• The drilling procedures employed by Nantou Mining conform to industry best practice 
and the resultant drilling pattern is sufficient to interpret the geometry and the 
boundaries of the mineralization with confidence.  All drilling sampling was carried out 
under the direct supervision of appropriately qualified geologists.  There are no drilling, 
sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability 
of the results. 
 

• Drilling, sampling, sample preparation, and analyses were appropriate for the style of 
mineralization and adequate for Mineral Resource estimation.   
 

• In 2017, the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) results showed an improvement 
over the 2016 results, with a significant reduction in large variances for certified 
reference materials (CRM) and better performance of the new granodiorite core blank 
material.  Overall, the QA/QC program, as designed and implemented by Nantou 
Mining, is adequate, and the assay results within the database are suitable for use in 
a Mineral Resource estimate. 
 

• The assumptions, parameters, and methodology of the Mineral Resource estimation 
are appropriate for the style of mineralization.  
 

• The updated variography study provides better interpolation parameters and will result 
in more accurate Mineral Resource estimations, especially for the Hanging Wall lenses.  
 

• Mineral Resources were estimated consistent with Canadian Institute of Mining, 
Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and 
Mineral Reserves dated May 10, 2014 (CIM (2014) definitions). 
 

• Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 4.85 million tonnes (Mt) grading 
13.73% Zn for a total of approximately 665,700 t of contained zinc. 
 

• Inferred Mineral Resources total 0.68 Mt grading 8.9% Zn for a total of approximately 
60,900 t of contained zinc. 

 
EXPLORATION 

• The areas covered by the exploration licences, as well as other areas along the Perkoa 
Mine Horizon, are very prospective for both base and precious metals. 

 
• Rapid progress has been made over the last year with respect to exploration activities 

at Perkoa.

• The Mineral Reserve estimate has been prepared utilizing acceptable estimation 
methodologies and the classification of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves 
conform to CIM (2014) definitions and NI 43-101. 
 

• Mining and milling costs used for the Mineral Reserve Net Smelter Return (NSR) 
calculation have been extracted directly from the 0.67 Mt per annum mining cost 
estimation physicals prepared by Nantou Mining in mid-2017.  The values are based 
on the average operating costs from the first half of 2017. 

 
• In addition to site operating costs, the Mineral Reserve estimate takes into 

consideration metallurgical recoveries, concentrate grades, transportation costs, 
smelter treatment charges, and royalty in determining economic viability. 
 

• The NSR cut-off value used for Mineral Reserve estimation is reasonable. 
 

• Stope shapes have been designed manually using Surpac software.  The resultant 
shapes were evaluated against the geological resource model to report the tonnes and 
grade for each stope shape. 
 

• Stope modifying factors were applied, post-geological interrogation, to generate the 
final diluted and recovered Mineral Reserve.  
 

• The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve totals 3.33 Mt at 13.06% Zn for a total of 
434,700 t of contained zinc. 

 
MINERAL PROCESSING 

• The process plant is a conventional sulphide flotation plant capable of processing 2,000 
tpd, currently operating at approximately 1,900 tpd, and includes crushing, screening, 
and grinding, followed by zinc flotation and filtering to produce a zinc concentrate. 
 

• Over the past five years of operation, the process plant has produced a zinc 
concentrate in the range of 50.6% Zn to 53.0% Zn from head grades ranging from 6.3% 
Zn to 15.2% Zn.  Recovery of zinc has been in the range of 89.3% to 96.7%. 
 

• In general, the Perkoa concentrate is considered "clean" by industry standards, with 
mercury and iron being two elements incurring small penalties. 
 

• There are no other by-product credits.  
 

• Zinc concentrates are trucked 1,200 km to the port of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, COMMUNITY 

• There is no evidence of environmental risks that could materially impact Nantou 
Mining's ability to extract the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves at the Perkoa 
mine.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 1-5 

• The Perkoa mine has a Health, Safety, Environment and Community (HSEC) Policy 
(2014) outlining its commitment to the environment as well as procedures aligned to 
the requirements of applicable Burkina Faso legislation.   
 

• The approved Environmental Management Plans (EMP) integral to the Environmental 
and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) provide the framework for Perkoa mine's 
environmental management. 

 

RECOMMENDATIONS 
RPA offers the following recommendations. 

 
GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 

• A comprehensive data process map should be undertaken, including logging and 
sampling inputs, database review, and mine to mill production reconciliation studies. 
 

• The Microsoft Access format diamond drill hole database should be modified so that 
only the Drill Hole Database Administrator has secured rights to revise or add data.  
RPA also recommends that the drill hole database include a field for QA/QC completed 
and a final Drill Hole Signoff by the Database Administrator. 
 

• Additional effort should be undertaken to monitor QA/QC inputs and results.  Also, the 
potential source of blank contamination must be investigated and remedied.  Although 
the granodiorite core has performed much better than the historical quartz vein blank 
material, some minor metal content is still being reported. 
 

• The composite length should be reviewed from the current 1.5 m to 2.0 m.  
 

• Grade capping should be applied to the raw assays prior to compositing as per industry 
best practices. 
 

• A reconciliation of the resource model versus the actual tonnage and grade, as 
determined by the process facility, should be included as a standard practice for the 
annual Mineral Resource estimation. 
 

• A study should be undertaken on the Crown Pillar to determine if the mineralization can 
be reported as part of the Mineral Resource estimate.  

 
EXPLORATION 

• In-mine drilling should continue to explore for economic downdip potential. 
 

• The comprehensive detailed review, compilation, and systematic exploration targeting 
plan should be continued prior to any future significant exploration expenditures. 
  

• The 2018 exploration budget of approximately $3.5 million, including exploration 
targeting, 20,000 m of diamond drilling, geochemistry, and geophysics, is well 
warranted.

MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 
• A review of the Mineral Reserves based on current zinc prices should be carried out. 

 
• The possibility of recovering the Crown Pillar should be studied as it is a potential 

source of mill feed once the current reserves are mined out. 
 
MINERAL PROCESSING 

• Zinc recoveries (92% to 94%) and concentrate grades (52% to 53%) are reasonable, 
however, both of these may be improved to maintain the upper range of recoveries and 
concentrate grades with further metallurgical testing. 

 
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, COMMUNITY 

• Malaria is a threat to the employees and contractors working at the mine.  Although 
strict controls are put in place by the mine, there are a high number of infections per 
year based on the location of the mine.  Training and Awareness programs will need 
to continue and possibly be extended beyond employees as infections may be 
occurring out of the mine workplace or camp site. 
 

• The permit for the closure and reclamation of cell one at the tailings facility is required 
to comply with the regulatory framework.  The risk is being managed by the onboarded 
contractor Knight Piésold and continuous engagement with the authorities by the 
Perkoa mine.   
 

• The update to the mine wide financial closure will need to be completed in 2018 to 
comply with the requirements from Bureau des Mines et de la Geologie du Burkina 
(BUMIGEB). 
 

• The Perkoa mine is actioning a detailed plan to manage the expired chemicals on site.  
At the time of writing this report, all the expired Zinc Sulphate and Zinc Metabisulphate 
had been removed from the Perkoa mine by Saphyto for safe disposal, as regulated. 
 

• New facilities are to be constructed in line with regulatory requirements for the storage 
of chemicals on site.  The documentation has been submitted for regulatory approval.  
 

• Waste management was identified as a potential risk to the Perkoa mine.  As such, a 
detailed waste action management plan was developed and reviewed during the site 
visit.  The action plan details a remediation plan for the waste that is currently on site, 
followed by the planning of a formalized waste management facility on site. 
 

• The mandate from the government to conduct an acid rock drainage potential study at 
the mine will assist in understanding mitigation measures that need to be developed, 
managed, and monitored in order to provide an accurate closure liability costing and 
rehabilitation plan for the mine.  
 

• There will need to be a stakeholder management plan that is developed to address the 
one percent levy that has been imposed from government.  Although the mine will 
possibly not be able to direct the spend of that levy, community perceptions regarding 
lack of local benefits and misappropriation of development funds could pose risk to the 
project, regardless of whether these perceptions are substantiated.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
As part of the 2018 Budget process carried out in mid-2017, Nantou Mining has developed a 

life of mine plan (LOM) which forecasts production to 2022 with a total of 3.33 Mt being mined 

at a grade of 13.1% Zn.  A Cash Flow Projection has been generated from the current LOM 

production schedule and capital and operating cost estimates, and is summarized in Table 1-

3.  Metal prices, as provided by Trevali, are based on consensus, long term forecasts from 

banks, financial institutions, and other sources.  All costs are presented in US dollars.  Some 

of the key parameters and assumptions for the after-tax cash flow on a 100% basis are as 

follows. 

 
REVENUE (100% BASIS) 

• 1,900 tpd 

• Head grade: 13.1% Zn 

• Mill recovery averaging: 93.3% 

• Metal price: based on consensus forecast per year, averaging $1.20 per pound zinc 

• Smelting and transport costs totalling $0.38 per pound payable zinc. 

• NSR: $182 per tonne milled. 

 
COSTS (100% BASIS) 

• Mine life:  4.8 years 

• Sustaining capital:  $24.5 million 

• Average operating cost over the mine life: $103/t milled 

• Closure costs:  $7.0 million 

• Salvage costs: nil 

• NSR Royalty:  $18.7 million 

• Net cash cost (equivalent to C1 cost), including sustaining capital, of $0.87 per pound 
of payable zinc. 

• After-tax Net Present Value (NPV) at 8%: $188 million 
 

Income tax losses may be carried forward for four years, while losses resulting from 

depreciation of assets can be carried forward indefinitely.  Nantou Mining has a substantial 

income tax loss carry-forward and is not subject to corporate income tax until the income tax 

loss carry-forward has been used.

SENSITIVITIES 
Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic risks 

were examined through analysis of cash flow sensitivities: 

• Head grade 

• Zinc recovery 

• Zinc price 

• Operating costs 

• Sustaining capital costs 
 

Pre-tax NPV at 8% discount sensitivities over the Cash Flow Projection have been calculated, 

and are shown in Table 1-4 and Figure 1-1.  The Project return is most sensitive to the product 

of changes in the head grade and zinc price followed by changes in the operating costs, 

recovery, and capital costs.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 1-11 

LAND TENURE 
The Perkoa mine consists of one exploitation permit (the Perkoa Exploitation Permit), which 

contains the Perkoa main zone deposit (Perkoa deposit) and two exploration permits (the 

Perkoa Exploration Permits), all located on contiguous ground. 

 

The Perkoa Exploitation Permit, held by Nantou Mining, was granted on March 20, 2007, and 

formally grants Nantou Mining the rights to develop and operate the Perkoa mine.  It is 

scheduled to expire on March 20, 2027.  Boundary Ventures Limited (BVL) holds 90% of the 

share capital of the exploitation company while the Burkina Faso State holds 10%, in 

accordance with the Mining Code.  BVL was a joint venture between Blackthorn Resources 

Ltd. (Blackthorn) and Glencore that explored the potential of the Perkoa deposit and four 

exploration permits (POA, Guido, Seboun, and Sepaogo) from 2010 to 2014.  The total area 

of the Perkoa Exploitation Permit is 6.24 km2 and the permit is of sufficient size for the mining 

operations. 

 

The Perkoa Exploitation Permit is surrounded by the Perkoa Exploration Permits, held by 

Nantou Exploration S.A. (Nantou Exploration), which currently cover a total area of 231.83 

km2.  Nantou Exploration is owned 100% by Trevali.  The Burkina Faso Mining Law gives the 

exploration permit holder the exclusive right to explore for the minerals requested on the 

surface and subsurface within the boundaries of the exploration permit.   

 

EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
There is limited existing infrastructure or services in the general area that are suitable to 

support the Perkoa mine other than good road access to the mine site.  All existing 

infrastructure in place is to support the local subsistence and small-scale agricultural practices.   

 

As power from the National Grid is deemed unreliable, the Perkoa mine generates its own 

power by way of diesel generators.  Water is supplied by a pipeline from a recently constructed 

dam at Seboun, approximately 18 km to the northeast of the mine.   

 

HISTORY 
The Perkoa mine area has been explored and investigated by a variety of companies for 

approximately 38 years.  The initial exploration was undertaken as part of a wider United 

Nations Development Program (UNDP) research program, however, this was followed by 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 1-12 

further exploration by La Société Minière et Métallurgique de Peñarroya (Peñarroya), Boliden 

AB (Boliden), Billiton Plc (Billiton) (now BHP Billiton), and Metorex (Pty) Limited (Metorex), 

before AIM Resources Ltd. (AIM Resources), which subsequently changed its name to 

Blackthorn, took over the project in 2005.   

 

In late 2010, a joint venture between Blackthorn (39.9%) and Glencore (50.1%) was formed 

(BVL).  In March 2013, an agreement was reached for Glencore to provide additional equity 

funding to the Project.  Blackthorn elected not to fund its equity share of the $80 million funding 

and, as a result, its interest in the project was diluted from 39.9% to 27.3%.  In May 2014, 

Blackthorn and Glencore reached an agreement whereby Glencore acquired Blackthorn's 

27.3% interest in the Perkoa Project, thereby allowing Blackthorn to exit the Perkoa Project 

and increasing Glencore's interest to a 90% level.  As of August 31, 2017, Trevali finalized the 

purchase of Glencore's 90% interest in the Perkoa Project.  Production at the Perkoa mine 

commenced in May 2013 and is ongoing at present. 

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERALIZATION 
The Perkoa deposit lies in a felsic to intermediary series of volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks, 

within the Paleoproterozoic Birimian Supergroup of West Africa.  The prospective Birimian 

rocks in Burkina Faso are the same sequences that host major gold deposits in Burkina Faso 

and in neighbouring Ghana and Mali.  The Birimian greenstone belts of West Africa are 

renowned for their gold mineralization, however, known occurrences of base metals are 

scarce.  The Perkoa deposit represents the only significant zinc-silver massive sulphide 

mineralization discovered in the Birimian to date and it is also the first zinc-silver massive 

sulphide mineralization discovered in this region.  Only zinc is currently being recovered at the 

Perkoa mine. 

 

The Perkoa mine area is located in the central part of the Boromo greenstone belt, which 

comprises volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Lower Palaeozoic Birimian Supergroup that 

have been metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies.  At least three phases of deformation 

have affected the Boromo belt and mafic to felsic dykes and granitic bodies were emplaced in 

several intrusive phases.  The zinc mineralization has been dated at 2,120 Ma to 2,141 Ma 

(Billiton, 1998). 

 

In the Perkoa mine area, the Birimian sediments, lavas, and pyroclastics strike from northeast 

to southwest and generally dip steeply to the northwest.  Several units of andesitic lavas with

subordinate andesitic tuffs, separated by sequences of tuffs interlayered with fine grained 

clastic sediments, make up the lithological package in the Perkoa mine area. 

  

A number of syn-tectonic and post-tectonic intrusive bodies have been emplaced within the 

meta-sediments, which range from large plutons of granitic and dioritic composition, to smaller 

ultramafic to rhyolitic intrusions.  Crosscutting lineaments with a northwest-southeast 

orientation are common although major displacements along these lineaments are rare. 

 

The Perkoa deposit has been classified as a volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit.  

VMS deposits are lenses and sheets of massive sulphide that form from seafloor hydrothermal 

systems where metal rich fluids (black smoke) precipitate on (exhalative) or near the seafloor 

(sub-seafloor replacement.). 

 

The Perkoa mineralization occurs as a series of stacked, northeast-southwest striking tabular 

VMS lenses hosted, and separated by, tuffaceous material that has been overturned with an 

average dip of approximately 70°.  The deposit is unusual for its high concentrations of zinc 

and barium mineralization, and relatively low levels of lead and copper.   

 

MINERAL RESOURCES 
Geological interpretation and Mineral Resource estimation were completed by Nantou Mining 

and reviewed by RPA, with an effective date of December 31, 2017 (Table 1-1).  The Mineral 

Resources have been completed to a level that meets industry standards and are compliant 

with CIM (2014) definitions.  As of year-end 2017, total Measured and Indicated Mineral 

Resources are estimated to be 4.85 Mt grading 13.73% Zn, containing approximately 665,700 

t of zinc.  In addition, Inferred Mineral Resources are estimated to be 0.68 Mt grading 8.9% 

Zn, containing approximately 60,900 t of zinc. 

 

The geological interpretation comprised wireframes for mineralization and lithological domains, 

which were developed using Surpac software.  The wireframes for lithology, including dykes, 

were generated based on logging of the major lithological units.  The cut-off grade for 

mineralization wireframes was 5% Zn.   

 

Composites were made using Surpac software using the wireframe intercept technique where 

intercepts of the geological drill or channel traces are coded to the geological database.  

Composites were made for each domain, including lead, silver, copper, pyrrhotite, pyrite, and

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 1-14 

density, at a 1.5 m length.  A grade cap, which varied per domain, was applied to the 

composites to avoid the use of anomalous data leading to local overestimation of the grade.   

A 5 m by 5 m by 5 m block model was constructed which was then sub-blocked down to a 

minimum size of 1.25 m.  Updates to the variography and search ellipsoids were used in the 

Ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation due to the addition of new analytical data, revised 

wireframes and the isolation of a sub-domain on the southern side of the main fault.  Inverse 

Distance (ID) and Nearest Neighbour (NN) interpolation methods were used for comparison 

and validation of the model against the OK results. 

 

Mineral Resource classification is based on the interpolation pass estimate attribute as well as 

the Qualified Person's level of geological knowledge and information (e.g., sufficient density of 

underground development or underground diamond core drilling in the area). 

 

Following estimation and classification, the block model was depleted using the actual 

development and stoping voids solids from survey pick-ups and cavity monitoring surveys 

(CMS).  Once the mining depletion had been completed, any "unrecoverable" areas, such as 

unbroken ore from completed stopes, design pillars, abandoned low grade areas, crown pillars, 

etc., are considered as unrecoverable, completely sterilized, and extracted from the Mineral 

Resource estimate. 

 

RPA reviewed the Perkoa block model in Micromine software.  The block model was validated 

by completing a series of visual inspections.  The checks showed good agreement between 

drill hole composite values along sections and plans.  The overall compiled Mineral Resource 

estimate had no material differences to that reported. 

 

MINERAL RESERVES 
As of year-end 2017, Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves total 3.33 Mt grading 13.06% Zn 

containing approximately 434,700 t of zinc (Table 1-2).  RPA is not aware of any mining, 

metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the 

Mineral Reserve estimate. 

 

Mineral Reserves are estimated from the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources.  RPA 

has performed an independent verification of the block model tonnes and grade, and in RPA's 

opinion, the process has been carried out to industry standards.

MINING METHOD 
The Perkoa mine is an underground operation, however, a small open pit was mined to reach 

near surface material during initial start-up to increase plant throughput as the underground 

mine ramped up production.  The pit is now complete.  Underground mining commenced in 

2013, with contractors carrying out all aspects of the mining process.   

 

All mining operations are currently being carried out by a mining contractor, which supplies 

manpower and equipment.  Nantou Mining personnel provide geological and engineering 

services. 

 

Longhole stoping is being used as the primary extraction method.  There are several variations 

on this mining method employed such as longitudinal and transverse, with both bottom-up and 

top-down mining sequences.  The exact method chosen is dependent on the orebody 

geometry.  Stopes are backfilled either with cemented rock fill (CRF) or waste. 

 

Longitudinal bottom-up stoping has been used above 190 level.  Due to the orebody width and 

mine sequencing, stopes between 190 level and 280 level are mined using the transverse 

method with primary and secondary stopes, with some longitudinal retreat mining occurring at 

the extremities of the orebody.  All of the primary stopes above 280 level have been mined out 

with the remaining ore to be mined as secondary stopes.   

 

A recoverable sill pillar is being established on 310 level in order to be able to convert the 

mining below 310 level to a bottom-up longitudinal retreat method, which is expected to reduce 

the amount of development required.  As well, a higher percentage of waste backfill instead of 

CRF can be used with this method which is expected to lower the mining cost. 

 

The majority of the stopes to be mined are located in the Footwall Lens of the orebody.  Bottom-

up mining will be utilized between 400 level and 310 level and top-down longitudinal retreat 

will be utilized between 400 level and 520 level.  The current limit of the Proven and Probable 

Mineral Reserves is at 520 level.  The majority of the stopes below 520 level are in a portion 

of the orebody which is classified as an Inferred Mineral Resource.  This area will require infill 

drilling in order to upgrade the Inferred Mineral Resource to a Measured or Indicated Mineral 

Resource.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 1-16 

For the Hanging Wall Lens, bottom-up mining will be utilized between 430 level and 310 level 

and top-down longitudinal retreat primary and secondary stoping will be utilized between 430 

level and 520 level.  The current limit of the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves is at 520 

level.  The majority of the Hanging Wall stopes below 520 level are in a portion of the orebody 

which is classified as an Inferred Mineral Resource.  This area will require infill drilling in order 

to upgrade the Inferred Mineral Resource to a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource. 

 

MINERAL PROCESSING 
The process plant at Perkoa is a conventional sulphide flotation plant capable of processing 

2,000 tpd and is currently operating at approximately 1,900 tpd.  The process plant includes 

crushing, screening, and grinding, followed by zinc flotation and filtering to produce a zinc 

concentrate.  The process plant originally included a lead recovery circuit, however, this circuit 

is no longer used and has been reconfigured to increase capacity in the zinc recovery circuit 

due to higher zinc head grades.   

 

Over the past five years of operation, the process plant has produced a zinc concentrate in the 

range of 50.6% Zn to 53.0% Zn from head grades ranging from 6.3% Zn (open pit) to 15.2% 

Zn (underground).  Recovery of zinc has been in the range of 89.3% to 96.7%.   

 

Zinc concentrates are trucked 1,200 km to the port of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.   

 

PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
Current infrastructure includes power, water, sewerage, a diesel storage facility, fire protection, 

and explosives magazines.   

 

Buildings on site include change houses, office blocks, gate houses, a clinic, and ablution 

facilities.  Appropriate security fencing and access control prevents inadvertent access onto 

the property and enhances safety. 

 

The supply of power from the national grid is unreliable.  Power for all areas of the mine, with 

the exception of the underground mine, are supplied from the central power station.  The power 

station has five Caterpillar 3516B-HD (2 MVA) generators installed in an industrial type 

structure of masonry and corrugated iron construction with a concrete floor.  Power usage at 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 1-17 

the central power station is approximately 2.5 MW to 3.2 MW, which means that normally three 

generators run at approximately 60% capacity, at any one time.   

 

An 11 kV overhead power transmission line is installed between the central powerhouse and 

the mine switch room to provide power to the underground mine.  

 

Plant tailings are deposited into a tailings storage facility (TSF) immediately adjacent to the 

process plant. 

 

MARKET STUDIES 
Global zinc demand continues to rise by between 2% to 4% per annum (or 280,000 t to 560,000 

t of zinc metal) driven by gross domestic product (GDP) growth, urbanization, and 

infrastructure development, and as a "mid-cycle" commodity with expanding markets for 

consumer goods (automobiles, appliances, etc.).  Mine closures and production cuts over the 

past few years have constrained primary supply which has driven the zinc price to near-decade 

highs. 

 

Zinc smelters are scaling back/curtailing refined zinc metal production due to concentrate 

shortages.  Benchmark zinc smelter treatment charges (TCs) dropped to US$172/tonne in 

2017, with no smelter price participation (0% escalators), a 10-year low.  TCs for 2018, are 

US$147/t. 

 

Consensus forecast is for continued strength in zinc prices in reaction to ongoing supply 

deficits.  Wood Mackenzie, an independent global commodity forecast consultant, is predicting 

robust zinc commodity prices over the short-term; averaging US$1.71/lb in 2018, US$1.87/lb 

in 2019, and a long-term forecast price of US$1.23/lb.   

 

ENVIRONMENTAL, PERMITTING, AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The Perkoa mine has a HSEC Policy (2014) outlining its commitment to the environment as 

well as procedures aligned to the requirements of applicable Burkina Faso legislation.  These 

commitments are then implemented and managed through a HSEC system, which is aligned 

to the principles of ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management System.  The current 

Environmental Management System (EMS) is based on the overarching procedures of 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 1-18 

Glencore, however, Trevali is in the process of implementing its corporate EMS, and the EMS 

at Perkoa and the procedures will be updated and aligned with this corporate framework.   

 

The approved EMP provides the framework for Perkoa mine's environmental management 

and outlines mitigation measures and monitoring programs, to reduce and manage negative 

impacts on the biophysical and social environment.  Environmental audits must be carried out 

in accordance with Article 4 of Decree No. 2015-10000 of October 28, 2015 laying down 

detailed rules for carrying out environmental audits.  As per these requirements, regular 

monitoring and evaluation of environmental performance through compliance audits is 

undertaken by BUMIGEB.   

 

The Perkoa mine has areas of waste disposal, including a tailings pond with additional 

extensions that were implemented in 2017, waste treatment facilities, and a scats stockpile, 

and generates both general and hazardous waste.  The mine currently has a tailings facility 

licensed by the Ministry of Environment that comprises three areas.  At the present stage of 

development of mine activities, only the first and second cells were constructed.  The Perkoa 

mine proposes to build a third cell for the receipt of its mining waste for a period of two years.  

The third cell is required as the first cell is full and will be managed under a closure and 

rehabilitation process and the second cell is almost at the maximum of its nominal design 

storage capacity.   

 

The Perkoa mine has a procedure in place for publicizing recruitment, signed by Nantou Mining 

and the Youth Committee on June 12, 2015 to use only local unskilled labour and to favour 

local labour if qualification is required.  Stakeholder management is being successfully 

managed on site by the implementation of a tripartite committee, comprised of representatives 

from Nantou Mining, the local community, and the government. 

 

In terms of corporate social responsibility, projects are consistent with those as required by the 

EMP.  In 2013-2016 corporate social projects included compensation for displaced graves and 

structures, construction of replacement houses, Perkoa Health and Social Promotion Centre, 

community water boreholes, and a literacy program.   

 

The National HIV/AIDS infection rate for Burkina Faso is approximately 1.8%.  The mine is 

actively involved in the prevention of HIV/AIDS and was presented with an award from the 

Government for "Significant Contribution to Community HIV/AIDS Program".

Of concern is the threat of malaria to the employees and contractors working at the mine.  

Although strict controls are put in place by the Perkoa mine, there are a high number of malaria 

cases reported annually.  Spraying schedules and training and Awareness programs will need 

to continue to be rolled out and extended beyond employees as infections may be occurring 

out of the mine workplace or camp site.

2 INTRODUCTION 
Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. (RPA) was retained by Trevali Mining Corporation (Trevali) to 

prepare an independent Technical Report on the Perkoa underground zinc mine (Perkoa), 

located in Burkina Faso (Perkoa).  The purpose of this report is to support the disclosure of 

the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, prepared by Nantou Mining Burkina 

Faso S.A. (Nantou Mining) and reviewed by RPA, as at December 31, 2017.  This Technical 

Report conforms to NI 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.   

 

Trevali is a zinc focused, base metals mining company with two commercially producing 

operations.  Trevali is actively producing zinc and lead-silver concentrates from its 2,000 tonne 

per day (tpd) Santander mine in Peru, its 3,000 tpd Caribou mine in the Bathurst Mining Camp 

of northern New Brunswick, Canada, and its 2,000 tpd Rosh Pinah mine in Namibia. 

 

The Perkoa underground zinc mine and milling operation is located in the Sanguié Province, 

120 km west of the capital city of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.  The Perkoa mine has been in 

operation since 2013 and currently produces zinc concentrates at a nominal processing rate 

of 2,000 tpd.  Trevali holds a 90% interest in Nantou Mining while the Burkina Faso State holds 

a 10% interest, in accordance with the Mining Code. 

 

On August 31, 2017, Trevali finalized definitive agreements with Glencore International PLC 

(Glencore) and certain of its subsidiaries whereby Trevali acquired a portfolio of zinc assets 

from Glencore, including a 90% interest in the Perkoa mine.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 4-1 

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
The Perkoa mine is located in the Sanguié Province of Burkina Faso, approximately 120 km 

west of the capital city of Ouagadougou (Figure 4-1).  The property's latitude and longitude are 

12° 22' N and 2° 36' W. 

 

The Perkoa mine consists of one exploitation permit (the Perkoa Exploitation Permit), which 

contains the Perkoa main zone deposit (Perkoa deposit) and two exploration permits (the 

Perkoa Exploration Permits), all located on contiguous ground. 

 

MINERAL RIGHTS AND LAND OWNERSHIP 
The exploitation and exploration permits comprising the Perkoa mine are subject to Burkina 

Faso's 2003 Mining Code No. 31–2003/AN, dated May 8, 2003 (the Burkina Faso Mining Law). 

 

Under the Mining Code, an exploitation permit is granted by a government decree passed on 

the basis of a proposal by the Mining Minister, pursuant to the recommendation of the National 

Mining Commission.  An exploitation permit is granted to any holder of an exploration permit 

which has provided evidence of the existence of an economic deposit in accordance with the 

Mining Code. 

 

EXPLOITATION PERMIT 
The Perkoa Exploitation Permit, held by Nantou Mining, was granted on March 20, 2007 and 

formally grants Nantou Mining the rights to develop and operate the Perkoa mine.  It is 

scheduled to expire on March 20, 2027.  Boundary Ventures Limited (BVL) holds 90% of the 

share capital of the exploitation company while the Burkina Faso State holds 10%, in 

accordance with the Mining Code.  This 10% state participation must be maintained when 

there is an increase in the capital of the company.  The government also collects various taxes 

and duties on the imports of fuels, supplies, equipment, and outside services, as specified by 

the Burkina Faso Mining Law.  In addition, there is a 3% royalty, payable to the government, 

on all base metal production in Burkina Faso.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 4-2 

The Mining Convention between Nantou Mining and the Government of Burkina Faso, which 

was signed by the Minister of Mines of Burkina Faso on August 27, 2008, sets out the fiscal 

and legal terms with respect to the operation of the Perkoa Exploitation Permit, including 

taxation rates applicable to the project, per the 2003 Mining Code.  The Convention is valid for 

20 years commencing on the date of the grant, and may be renewed for subsequent periods 

of five years. 

 

The Perkoa Exploitation Permit's perimeter is defined by UTM coordinates of the corner posts 

as listed in Table 4-1 and the permit's limit is shown in Figure 4-2.  The total area is 6.24 km2 

(624 ha) and is of sufficient size for the mining operations.

The new Burkina Faso Mining Code was approved by the transitional government and came 

into effect on June 16, 2015, however, an application decree is required for the Mining Code 

to be operational.  Trevali does not expect a material impact of the new Mining Code on Nantou 

Mining, as it has fiscal stability clauses in its existing Mining Convention. 

 

RPA is not aware of any environmental liabilities on the property.  Nantou Mining has all 

required permits to conduct the work on the property.  RPA is not aware of any other significant 

factors and risks that may affect access, title, or the right or ability to perform the work on the 

property.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 4-5 

EXPLORATION PERMITS 
The Perkoa Exploitation Permit is surrounded by the Perkoa Exploration Permits, held by 

Nantou Exploration S.A. (Nantou Exploration), which currently cover a total area of 231.83 

km2.  Nantou Exploration is owned 100% by Trevali.   

 

The Burkina Faso Mining Law gives the exploration permit holder the exclusive right to explore 

for the minerals requested on the surface and subsurface within the boundaries of the 

exploration permit.  Exploration permits are guaranteed by the Law and its associated arrêtés 

(decrees) provided that the permit holder complies with reporting requirements and annual 

exploration expenditures totalling 270,000 CFA francs/km2, or approximately $650/km2. 

 

The exploration permit also gives the holder the exclusive right, at any time, to convert the 

exploration permit into an exploitation permit, in accordance with the law.  Each exploitation 

permit application requires a separate Feasibility Study (FS), however, there are precedents 

in Burkina Faso for variations to this rule (e.g., Etruscan's Youga project). 

 

Exploration permits are valid for a period of three years from date of issue and may be renewed 

for two more consecutive terms of three years each for a total of nine years; however, on the 

second renewal, at least 25% of the original area must be relinquished. 

 

The Perkoa Exploration Permits have been granted by the Minister of Mines, Quarries, and 

Energy (MMCE) as an arrêté under Burkina Faso's 2003 Mining Code (Code Minier, No. 31–

2003/AN dated May 8, 2003).   

 

The POA Exploration Permit was originally granted to Blackthorn Resources Limited 

(Blackthorn) by arrêté N° 07-098/MCE/SG/DGMGC on July 10, 2007 and was subsequently 

transferred to Nantou Exploration by arrêté N° 2015-000073/MME/SG/DGMGC on March 2, 

2015.  The third renewal application was submitted to MMCE on May 12, 2016.  The application 

was approved on October 26, 2017 and backdated to July 10, 2016.  The POA Exploration 

Permit, listed as arrêté N° 17/187, is now valid until July 10, 2019. 

 

The Guido Exploration Permit was originally granted to Blackthorn by arrêté N° 07-

098/MCE/SG/DGMGC on July 10, 2007 and was subsequently transferred to Nantou 

Exploration by arrêté N° 2015-000073/MME/SG/DGMGC on March 2, 2015.  The third renewal 

application was submitted to MMCE on May 12, 2016.  The application was approved on

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL 
RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE AND 
PHYSIOGRAPHY 
ACCESSIBILITY 
The Perkoa mine is located in the Sanguié Province of Burkina Faso, approximately 120 km 

west of the capital city of Ouagadougou.  The location of the mine is shown in Figure 4-1.  

Driving time from Ouagadougou is approximately 2.5 hours along paved roads, except for the 

last 7 km, which are on graded laterite road.   

 

The project is 35 km by road from the country's third largest town, Koudougou, which is linked 

to neighbouring states of Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Togo by paved roads and by rail to Abidjan, 

the capital of Cote d'Ivoire. 

 

Burkina Faso is serviced by two international airports, one in Ouagadougou, and the other in 

Bobo-Dioulasso.  There are numerous secondary airfields throughout the country.  Asphalt 

highways connect the main cities and neighbouring countries, and a narrow-gauge railroad 

connects Kaya and Ouagadougou with the port city of Abidjan in Côte d'Ivoire.  A modern 

cellular telephone network has been established in the country.   

 

CLIMATE 
The Perkoa region is of the Sudanese north type with two distinctive seasons: (i) a long dry 

season from October to May with temperatures between 15°C and 41°C, (ii) a season of rainfall 

from June to September with temperatures between 22°C and 35°C.  

 
The annual precipitation ranges from 703 mm to 994 mm.  The average monthly quantity is 

between 207 mm and 226 mm.  The month of August is the wettest.  The average evaporation 

is 3,524 mm. 

 

Burkina Faso's climate allows for exploration to be carried out throughout the year.  Geological 

fieldwork and rotary drilling are usually conducted during the dry season between January and 

May, while diamond drilling can be conducted throughout the year.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 5-2 

LOCAL RESOURCES 
The main activity of the local population is subsistence agriculture and to a lesser extent the 

raising of animals.  Crops grown include cereals (sorghum, millet, and corn), which annually 

occupy more than 85% of the sewed surfaces and constitute the principal food of the 

population.  Some cash crops, mainly cotton, and peanuts are cultivated.  

 

The Project is named after the nearest village, Perkoa, and borders three other villages, 

Sanguié, Bonyolo, and Pouni Naorth.  Perkoa is divided into three main areas: Piokoura, 

Negoulidouan, and Dakoulitio. 

 

INFRASTRUCTURE 
There is limited existing infrastructure or services in the general area that are suitable to 

support the Perkoa mine.  There is good road access to the mine site.  All existing infrastructure 

in place is to support the local subsistence and small-scale agricultural practices.  Power from 

the National Grid is deemed unreliable.  The Perkoa mine generates its own power by diesel 

generators. 

 

Water is supplied by a pipeline from a recently constructed dam at Seboun, approximately 18 

km to the northeast of the mine.   

 

The surface and underground infrastructure at the Perkoa mine includes the following: 

• A 1,800 tpd to 2,000 tpd process plant. 

• A tailings pond comprising three cells, a polishing pond, and a process water pond. 

• A crushing plant. 

• Administrative buildings, a warehouse, a dry, an infirmary, a laboratory, a main garage. 

• A warehouse for reagents and lubricants. 

• A decline and a series of ramp-connected levels. 

• Power supply to the plant, mine, workshops, camp, and offices is provided by five diesel 
Caterpillar 3516B-HD (2MVA) generators. 

• Mining equipment.

6 HISTORY 
PRIOR OWNERSHIP 
The Perkoa mine area has been explored and investigated by a variety of companies for 

approximately 38 years.  The initial exploration was undertaken as part of a wider United 

Nations Development Program (UNDP) research program, however, this was followed by 

further exploration by La Société Minière et Métallurgique de Peñarroya (Peñarroya), Boliden 

AB (Boliden), Billiton Plc (Billiton) (now BHP Billiton), and Metorex (Pty) Limited (Metorex), 

before AIM Resources Ltd. (AIM Resources), which subsequently changed its name to 

Blackthorn, took over the project in 2005.   

 

In late 2010, a joint venture between Blackthorn (39.9%) and Glencore (50.1%) was formed.  

In March 2013, agreement was reached for Glencore to provide additional equity funding to 

the project.  Blackthorn elected not to fund its equity share of the $80 million funding and, as 

a result, its interest in the Project was diluted from 39.9% to 27.3%.  In May 2014, Blackthorn 

and Glencore reached an agreement whereby Glencore acquired Blackthorn's 27.3% interest 

in the Perkoa Project, thereby allowing Blackthorn to exit the Perkoa Project and increasing 

Glencore's interest to a 90% level.  As of August 31, 2017, Trevali finalized the purchase of 

Glencore's 90% interest in the Perkoa Project.  Production at the Perkoa mine commenced in 

May 2013 and is currently ongoing. 

 

EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY 
The key milestones of the Project are described in the following sections. 

 

UNDP – BUMIGEB:  1979 – 1982 
Various anomalies including Perkoa were discovered following regional soil geochemistry 

conducted by the Bureau des Mines et de la Geologie du Burkina (BUMIGEB), the Burkina 

Faso state run geological research and mining company, between 1979 and 1982 during an 

exploration program funded by a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP):   

• Regional soil geochemical surveys. 

• Follow-up soil geochemical surveys. 

• Ground geophysical surveys including magnetics and electromagnetic (EM). 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 6-2 

• Surface diamond drilling included 12 inclined drill holes totalling 2,359.5 m. 

 

PEÑARROYA – BUMIGEB:  1983 – 1986 
More detailed geochemistry as well as auger drilling, geophysics, and diamond drill holes 

undertaken confirmed the Perkoa zinc-silver volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit.  

The following work was completed between 1983 and 1986 in a joint venture between 

Peñarroya and BUMIGEB: 

• Additional ground geophysical surveys. 

• Surface diamond drilling included 39 inclined drill holes totalling 12,925.4 m. 

• A pre-feasibility study report. 

 

BOLIDEN:  1990 – 1992 
Boliden undertook a drilling program and defined a maiden resource for Perkoa: 

• Surface diamond drilling included 23 inclined drill holes totalling 6,476.0 m. 

 

BILLITON:  1996 – 1997 
Billiton undertook further drilling as well as geotechnical work and re-estimated the resource.  

The following work was completed between 1996 and 1997 by Billiton: 

• Surface diamond drilling including six inclined and vertical drill holes totalling 1,283 m. 

• Re-sampling of 19 historical drill holes for check analyses and metallurgical testwork.  
The check assays by Billiton did not find major discrepancies in the zinc assays. 

• Soil geochemical survey (50 m by 50 m grid). 

• Re-interpretation of regional geophysical airborne magnetics and EM data. 

• Pre-feasibility study. 

 

METOREX:  1999 – 2004 
Metorex acquired the project from Billiton on September 30, 1999. 

 

No field work was carried out by Metorex on the Perkoa deposit.  A geochemical anomaly 

situated 5 km southwest of Perkoa (Prospect AF1 of Billiton) was tested by induced 

polarization (IP) geophysical techniques, reverse circulation (RC) drilling, and diamond drilling 

in December 2002.  Three DD holes, totalling 500 m in length, were drilled at this anomaly and 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 6-3 

intersected semi-massive pyrite/pyrrhotite mineralization, which was considered to be of little 

economic significance by Metorex. 

 

AIM RESOURCES:  2005 – 2008  
In 2005, AIM Resources obtained ownership of Perkoa and commenced drilling for exploration 

and metallurgical testwork. 

• December 2005 – Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS) completed by Snowden Mining 
Industry Consultants (Snowden). 
 

• March 2007 – Exploitation Licence for Perkoa awarded to AIM Resources. 
 

• March 2007 – Project construction commenced for a 525,000 tpa mining operation 
based on the design developed in the December 2005 BFS. 
 

• July 2008 – Construction halted and Perkoa was placed on a care and maintenance 
program due to declining zinc prices. 

 

BVL:  2010 – 2014 
BVL was a joint venture between Blackthorn and Glencore that explored the potential of the 

Perkoa deposit and four exploration permits (POA, Guido, Seboun, and Sepaogo) from 2010 

to 2014.   

 

The significant exploration work completed during this phase included: 

• Versatile Time Domain Electromagnetic (VTEM) System airborne geophysical survey. 

• Airborne magnetic survey. 

• Ground IP geophysical surveys. 

• Rotary Air Blast (RAB) drilling and geochemical sampling. 

 

GLENCORE:  2014 – MID 2017 
In 2015, Glencore took over all responsibility for exploration.  Glencore's review concluded that 

mine definition drilling should be prioritized, however, regional exploration must be undertaken 

well in advance of reserves depletion.   

 

Glencore's exploration observations for the Perkoa area included: 

• The Perkoa deposit appears to be a good conductor. 
 

• IP surveys are not suitable for base metal deposit discrimination. 
 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 6-4 

• Soil and stream sediment sampling could have significant limitations resulting in low 
confidence levels. 
 

• Surface geological mapping is problematic due to the weathered terrain. 
 

The principal exploration recommendation was that proven geophysical exploration techniques 

(airborne, surface, and downhole) should be employed in the search for large blind base metal 

deposits along the strike of the Perkoa deposit (the Perkoa Mine Horizon). 

 

HISTORICAL MINERAL RESOURCE AND RESERVE 
ESTIMATES 
On December 21, 2005, Snowden issued a BFS on behalf of AIM Resources. 

 

The 2005 Mineral Resource estimate for Perkoa (Table 6-1) was classified as Measured and 

Indicated Resources using the guidelines of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration 

Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the JORC Code) (December, 2004).

These estimates prepared for AIM Resources are considered to be historical in nature and 

should not be relied upon.  These estimates are relevant as these are indicative of the 

mineralization on the property.  Trevali is not treating the historical estimates as current Mineral 

Resources or Mineral Reserves and these have been superseded by the Mineral Resource 

and Mineral Reserve estimates in Sections 14 and 15 of this report.  

 

Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimation were completed by Perkoa and reviewed 

by RPA, with an effective date of December 31, 2016 (Table 6-3 and 6-4, respectively).

7  GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND 
MINERALIZATION 
REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
The Perkoa deposit lies in a felsic to intermediary series of volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks, 

within the Paleoproterozoic Birimian Supergroup of West Africa.  The prospective Birimian 

rocks in Burkina Faso are the same sequences that host major gold deposits in Burkina Faso 

and in neighbouring Ghana and Mali.  The Birimian greenstone belts of West Africa are 

renowned for their gold mineralization, however, known occurrences of base metals are 

scarce.  The Perkoa deposit represents the only significant zinc-silver massive sulphide 

mineralization discovered in the Birimian to date and it is also the first zinc-silver massive 

sulphide mineralization discovered in this region.  Only zinc is currently being recovered at the 

Perkoa mine. 

 

The Perkoa project area is located in the central part of the Boromo greenstone belt, which 

comprises volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the Lower Palaeozoic Birimian Supergroup that 

have been metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies.  At least three phases of deformation 

have affected the Boromo belt and mafic to felsic dykes and granitic bodies were emplaced in 

several intrusive phases.  The zinc mineralization has been dated at 2,120 Ma to 2,141 Ma 

(Billiton, 1998). 

 

The extensive development of laterite and the paucity of outcrop have not allowed for detailed 

surface mapping to take place.  Consequently, geological maps are based on limited 

information. 

 

LOCAL GEOLOGY 
In the Perkoa mine area (Figure 7-1), the Birimian sediments, lavas, and pyroclastics strike 

from northeast to southwest and generally dip steeply to the northwest.  Several units of 

andesitic lavas with subordinate andesitic tuffs, separated by sequences of tuffs interlayered 

with fine grained clastic sediments, make up the lithological package in the project area.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 7-3 

A number of syn-tectonic and post-tectonic intrusive bodies have been emplaced within the 

meta-sediments, which range from large plutons of granitic and dioritic composition to smaller 

ultramafic to rhyolitic intrusions.  Crosscutting lineaments with a northwest-southeast 

orientation are common although major displacements along these lineaments are rare. 

 

PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
The Perkoa mineralization occurs as a series of stacked, northeast-southwest striking tabular 

VMS lenses hosted, and separated by, tuffaceous material that has been overturned with an 

average dip of approximately 70° (Figure 7-2).  The deposit is unusual for its high 

concentrations of zinc and barium mineralization, and relatively low levels of lead and copper.   

 

The stratigraphic hanging wall is represented by andesites.  Six mineralized lenses, hosted 

within the tuffs, have now been identified; one main lens called "Footwall Lens" (split into 

normal and high grade domains due to plutonic activity which had locally caused remobilization 

of zinc), one minor thin (less than 2 m) lens in the footwall, which is sometimes intermixed with 

the main orebody, and four minor lenses in the stratigraphy above called "Hanging Wall 

Lenses".  A granitic pluton is present in the footwall of the deposit and locally intrudes into the 

mineralized orebody, creating enriched remobilized areas.  The volcanics in contact with the 

granodiorite are locally metasomatized, forming a silica-magnetite-garnet skarn. 

 

Dyke structures crosscut the deposit, most notably a large granitic dyke 5 m to 20 m thick 

striking east-northeast to west-southwest and dipping an average of 50°, and have replaced 

areas of mineralization.  Smaller families of andesitic and basaltic dykes crosscut the deposits 

and are typically sub-horizontal and sub-vertical respectively.  Finally, the deposit is cut by 

several felsic to intermediary intrusive rocks, which tend to reappear in more or less regular 

intervals and can be interpreted as the feeders of lavas and intrusions found locally above and 

below the mineralized sequence. 

 
One major reverse fault, which is split into several minor to major ones, crosses the entire 

orebody from the southern point of the open pit on surface to the northern point of the deepest 

part of the mine and seems to play an important role on the geological continuity of the orebody 

and other structural elements.

MINERALIZATION 
The Footwall Lens is the thickest (up to 25 m to 30 m) most continuous and typically the highest 

grade of all the lenses.  It is a massive sulphide lens, with sharp hanging wall and footwall 

contacts and is interpreted to have formed at or near the seafloor.  The Footwall Lens typically 

has higher zinc grades than that of the Hanging Wall Lenses and represents the majority of 

the overall Mineral Resources.  The Footwall Lens is composed of approximately the same 

proportions (20% to 25%) of coarse grained sphalerite and pyrite, a minor content of pyrrhotite, 

plus localized galena associated with silver.  Locally barite (up to 15%) is a common 

constituent of the gangue.  In the upper northeastern area of the deposit, the Footwall High 

Grade Lens has grades in excess of 50% Zn near the contact between the sulphide lens and 

granodiorite pluton.  This is due to the late heat driven re-modification of the sulphide 

mineralization by the granodiorite.  Zinc grades in the footwall average between 9% and 15%. 

 

The Hanging Wall Lenses are typically thinner (up to 15 m) than the Footwall Lens and 

represent more interbedded features of massive, vein type, sulphide replacement, or 

disseminated VMS together with tuffaceous material along the same geological horizon.  

These lenses are interpreted to represent sub-seafloor replacement by sulphides.  In these 

lenses, the pyrite and pyrrhotite content is higher than that of the Footwall Lens, while barite 

content is lower and almost no lead and silver are present.  Due to the interbedded and 

disseminated nature of the Hanging Wall Lenses, they are typically of lower average zinc 

grade, however, they are found to have some enriched zones in proximity to fault zones and/or 

intrusions 

 

High temperature alteration, ferruginous and copper minerals can be found in small proportions 

in the Hanging Wall lenses, especially at depth or in relation to local structural features.  From 

310 level and below, assay results from both grade control samples and underground drill 

holes show a progressive enrichment in copper in the hanging wall main lens.  Perkoa is known 

to host trace copper (generally below 10 ppm), but values in the hanging wall are progressively 

increasing up to 0.6% on 370 level.  A preliminary "copper area" lens is being modelled to 

investigate the potential.

REGIONAL EXPLORATION TARGETS 
A 2008 airborne VTEM survey revealed that the Perkoa sulphide deposit gives a strong EM 

and magnetic response.  A total of 46 other targets have been generated with four main 

clusters of anomalies, all located along the prospective Perkoa Mine Horizon.  The principal 

regional exploration targets located along strike from Perkoa, marked on the VTEM survey, 

are presented in Figure 7-3 and discussed below. 

 

AF1 
AF1 is located approximately 5 km southwest from Perkoa and is centred on two VTEM/EM 

targets.  Around the principal VTEM anomaly, the composition of the volcanics changes from 

andesitic clastic/lapilli tuffs with minor andesite flows to a mafic volcanic package, with pillow 

basalts interbedded with mafic clastic tuffs.  Silica-sericite-pyrite alteration is abundant and 

historic drilling intersected pyrite-pyrrhotite stringers. 

 

With an outcropping gossan and extensive alteration within the same volcanic package as 

Perkoa, AF1 is interpreted as being the second "VMS style" hydrothermal system along the 

horizon.  The prospect is considered to consist of multiple stacked targets.  

 

PERKOA NORTHEAST 
Perkoa Northeast is a broad area located approximately 2.7 km to 7.0 km northeast of Perkoa.  

The volcanic package is dominated by interbedded andesitic clastics and crystal tuffs, with 

minor andesite flows and graphitic tuffs.  Broad zones of intense silica-sericite plus sulphide 

stringers and chlorite-pyrite alteration have been mapped.  Historic drilling intersected semi-

massive pyrrhotite possibly a feeder zone to a massive sulphide. 

 

SEMAPOUN 
Semapoun is located approximately 11 km along strike, to the northeast of Perkoa.  The 

geology is dominated by graphitic shales but Mn-Fe rich cherts and silicified tuff have been 

mapped along the Perkoa Mine Horizon.  Historic RAB drilling identified anomalous Zn.

8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
The Perkoa deposit has been classified as a VMS deposit (Billiton, 1998).  VMS deposits are 

lenses and sheets of massive sulphide that form from seafloor hydrothermal systems where 

metal rich fluids (black smoke) precipitate on (exhalative) or near the seafloor (sub seafloor 

replacement.). 

 

Worldwide, VMS deposits are major sources of zinc, copper, lead, silver, and gold.   

 

VMS deposits generally display a massive sulphide horizon, overlying an alteration or stringer 

zone, and metal zonation is common.  As VMS deposits commonly occur in groups or clusters, 

there is good potential for additional discoveries of mineralization in the Perkoa area. 

 

The Perkoa deposit has also undergone later re-modification driven by late heat from the 

granodiorite intrusion located in the footwall.  This resulted in recrystallization of the sulphides 

and metasomatism of the surrounding host rocks. 

 

The important characteristics of this deposit type, that have been used to guide exploration 

and evaluation at Perkoa, have included: 

• The relationship between the VMS deposit type and the steeply dipping planar 
brittle/ductile shear zones and regional zones of deformation which provided sources 
and pathways for the hydrothermal solutions. 
 

• The occurrence in volcanic-sedimentary successions and often at an interface between 
two lithological units. 
 

• Characteristic metal zonation.

9 EXPLORATION 
EXPLORATION PROCESS AND TECHNIQUES 
Upon completion of the purchase transaction, Trevali took over all responsibility for exploration 

as of September 2017 and have since ramped up exploration activities, building a new 

exploration team, with experience of the local geology.  RPA concurs with Trevali's opinion 

that Perkoa should be considered as an emerging unexplored belt with analogies to Canadian 

VMS camps.  Given the intensity of the mineralisation at Perkoa, especially its high grade 

nature, it is highly likely that Perkoa is not an isolated deposit. 

 

Trevali has two goals with the exploration at Perkoa; (i) discover additional tonnes at the 

Perkoa deposit, and (ii) discover a new deposit in this unexplored, frontier VMS camp. 

 

PERKOA MINE 2017 EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES 
Following a comprehensive review of the data and geology of Perkoa by Trevali, new insights 

to the deposit were gained.  A strong northeast plunge to the orebody was identified, with a 

coincident, northeast plunging, stretch lineation, identified in the surrounding rocks.  The 2017 

in-mine diamond drilling program focussed on down-plunge Mineral Resource extension 

drilling.  In-mine exploration was based on the following considerations: 

 

• The mineralization within the Perkoa deposit has a well-developed northeasterly 
plunge; 
 

• No drilling has been conducted down plunge; and 
 

• Mineralization remains open at depth below the orebody and along strike. 
 

Perkoa 2017 in-mine resource conversion and expansion exploration drilling included 12,347.5 

m of underground drilling and 12,756.6 m of surface drilling. 

 

OPEN PIT MAPPING AND SAMPLING 
The Perkoa open pit was re-mapped in October 2017.  Sixty-three orientation samples were 

collected from both the northeast and southwest walls of the open pit in order to characterize 

the dispersion of the mineralization in the oxidized host rocks in the open pit:

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 9-2 

• Forty-two of these samples were from two chip lines; and,  

• Twenty-one of these samples were from point surface samples. 

 

HISTORICAL CORE RE-LOGGING 
In February and March 2017, seven historical holes (PS106, PS321, PS322, PS307GT, 

PS303, PS305GT, and PS323) were re-logged for geological interpretation allowing for 

improved targeting of the deep part of the deposit and the identification/confirmation of local to 

regional geological features. 

 

UNDERGROUND MINERAL RESOURCE EXTENSION DRILLING EXPLORATION 
Underground drilling was conducted from March to December 2017.  This drilling, which is 

discussed further in Section 10, was planned to upgrade resources to the Measured and 

Indicated categories from 400 to 460 levels. 

 
Of particular note was Drill Hole PU340 which was drilled to target the down-plunge depth 

extension of the hanging wall lens, and intercepted 12.05 m grading 8.68% Zn; including 7.00 

m grading 11.74% Zn and 8.15 m grading 10.34% Zn at the 580 Level.  This demonstrated the 

potential for additional material to be defined at depth.  Follow up drilling is planned for 2018. 

 

SURFACE RESOURCE EXTENSION DRILLING EXPLORATION 
In 2017 surface exploration drilling targeted areas to the north of the deposit and at depth 

which could not be tested from current underground drilling platforms: 

• PX17_001.  This hole failed/cancelled. 
 

• PX17_002B (777 m total depth) targeted the northeast extension.  It intersected a 
strong sulphide stringer zone.  Beginning with pyrite-pyrrhotite with chalcopyrite flecks, 
it continued into a sphalerite-pyrite stringer zone with intense chlorite-silica alteration.  
The hole then intersected a series of dykes and structures, which appears to be a major 
structure, locally termed "the big blue fault", before continuing into another sulphide 
stringer zone.  The hole will be surveyed with Borehole Electromagnetics (BHEM) in 
early 2018. 
 

• PX17_003 (662 m total depth) targeted the Perkoa Northeast extension.  It only 
intersected a zone of minor disseminated/stockwork pyrite-pyrrhotite.  The hole will be 
surveyed with BHEM in early 2018. 
 

• PX17_004 (914 m total depth) dropped significantly and intersected the target 
approximately 120 m below the designed intercept point, returning a broad zone of 
disseminated sulphide with minor sphalerite.  The hole will be surveyed with BHEM in 
early 2018. 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 9-3 

Three holes were drilled to test the main historic geophysical targets within the Exploitation 

Permit: 

• PX17_005 (512 m total depth) was drilled in the centre of a geophysical anomaly, but 
failed to intersect the source of the anomaly.  A BHEM survey is planned for 2018.   
 

• PX17_006 (521 m total depth) was drilled to test the Perkoa Southwest EM anomaly, 
but failed to intersect any significant sulphide mineralization.  The hole will be surveyed 
with BHEM in early 2018. 
 

• PX17_007 (575 m total depth) was drilled to test the VTEM/EM anomaly underneath 
Tailings Pond No. 2.  This hole intersected a wide zone of disseminated pyrrhotite (2% 
to 5%) with minor associated alteration between 300 m to 350 m.  The pyrrhotite is 
thought to explain this EM/VTEM anomaly, however, BHEM will be conducted on this 
hole in 2018.   

 

2017 REGIONAL EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES 
Trevali's regional exploration program is focussed on the discovery of new deposits within the 

economic transport distance of the Perkoa Mill.  Trevali's 2017 exploration activities outside 

the Perkoa Exploration Permit, conducted under the auspices of 100% owned Nantou 

Exploration, included: 

 

APPLICATION FOR ADDITIONAL GROUND 
• Renewal applications for the POA and Guido Exploration Permits were approved in 

2017. 
 

• In addition, a 716 km2 WorldView2 imagery with 50 cm resolution around Perkoa has 
been purchased.  This high quality data will greatly aid mapping and regional 
exploration activities. 

 

BUILD UP NANTOU EXPLORATION TEAM 
• A dedicated senior exploration geologist was been hired along with three other 

experienced geologists.   
 

• Trevali has retained a VMS specialist and geophysical consultants to provide advice 
and exploration guidance. 

 

ACQUISITION AND REINTERPRETATION OF ALL EXISTING EXPLORATION 
DATA 

• The existing exploration data includes geology, geochemistry, and geophysics.  
 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 9-4 

• Nantou geologists are continuing a program that was initiated by Trevali in 2017, 
consisting of re-logging and re-sampling historical surface holes for inductively coupled 
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses.  The goal of this program is to generate 
a geochemical model using Leapfrog to determine indicators for future exploration.  
Nantou geologists have also attempted to map and better understand the volcanic 
stratigraphy. 
 

• The Perkoa geophysical dataset has been reprocessed and the positioning of targets 
has been corrected. 
 

• A first pass geological map of Perkoa Northeast was completed.  Mapping was 
completed at 1:5000 scale.  Although limited by outcrop coverage, a reasonable 
understanding of the geology of the area has been developed and two hydrothermal 
systems were identified within 5 km of Perkoa with associated geophysical and 
geochemical anomalies.  
 

• A first pass geological map of AF1 was completed.  Mapping was completed at 1:5000 
scale and a good understanding of the geology of the area has been developed, and a 
hydrothermal system identified. 
 

• The historic electronic exploration data was organized, cleaned, and validated.  This 
data includes regional RC, diamond, and RAB drilling, soil sampling, trench sampling, 
and grab samples.  There does appear to be missing data, which is reportedly in paper 
reports/folders. 
 

• Over 40 prospective targets have been generated, in four main clusters, along the 
Perkoa Mine Horizon within the POA and Guido Exploration Permits. 

 

SURFACE POINT SAMPLING PROGRAM 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately 21-point rock samples were collected by 

Nantou Exploration.   

 

SURFACE SOIL SAMPLING PROGRAM 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately 674 soil samples (435 at Perkoa Northeast 

and 239 at AF1) were collected by Nantou Exploration.  All samples were collected from the 

bottom of small pits dug 20 cm to 40 cm deep, below any wind blown or organic material and 

sieved to a -6 mm fraction.  Sample spacing was based on a 25 m by 200 m grid. 

 

SURFACE CHANNEL SAMPLING PROGRAM 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately 241 channel samples were collected by 

Nantou Exploration.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 9-5 

At Perkoa Northeast, 199 channel samples were collected from the 10 channel lines which 

have been completed.  This sampling campaign has been targeting zones of alteration and 

stockworking, which is possibly part of a footwall alteration/feeder zone to the mineralized 

horizon, over which there are EM/VTEM anomalies.  The geologists ensured that the lines 

were clean, and all continuous samples of rock (or saprolite) were taken. 

 

Trenching was also conducted at AF1 with 250 m completed by year end 2017 (Figure 9-1).   

 
FIGURE 9-1   AF1 TRENCHING 

 

 
 

PROPOSED 2018 EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES 

IN-MINE EXPLORATION 
For 2018, approximately 5,000 m of underground drilling is proposed in order to target 

Measured Resources from 460 to 640 levels.  This will be following up on the success of 

PU340, which discovered the extension to the Hanging Wall lens.  The 2017 surface drilling 

will be followed up with downhole EM surveys.  

  

As the mineralization is still open at depth, an additional 5,000 m of underground drilling is 

proposed to target new inferred resources from the 640 to 790 Levels.  No drilling has 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 9-6 

previously been conducted at these depths, which is targeting further extensions to the 

Hanging Wall Lens. 

 

IN-MINE GEOPHYSICS 
The 2017 surface and underground diamond drilling programs will be followed up in 2018 with 

downhole electromagnetic surveys (Crone) scheduled to start in Q1 2018.  Petrophysical data 

on the rocks at Perkoa will also be collected.  This will aid in the re-processing and re-

interpretation of historic geophysical surveys. 

 

REGIONAL EXPLORATION 
The 2018 regional exploration program will be focussed on developing targets along the 

Perkoa Mine Horizon.  The 2018 budget is approximately $3.5 million.  As there are already 

over 40 targets generated from airborne EM, the targets will be evaluated by combining 

mapping, geochemistry, and further geophysics (including detailed ground EM and gravity).  

Geological mapping and first pass fieldwork on identified gossan outcrops will form the 

foundation of the exploration.  The strongest targets will be tested with diamond drilling in the 

second half of the year. 

 

The current goals of the regional exploration program is to increase Inferred Mineral Resources 

to support the Long Range mine planning, and to discover a new deposit. 

 

REGIONAL GEOPHYSICS 
Ground EM surveys will be conducted over selected targets, to verify the position of potential 

conductors.  In addition, a gravity survey is proposed, initially over selected target areas within 

the belt to determine its effectiveness.  This combined approach should allow for potential 

massive sulphide bodies to be distinguished from EM responses caused by stringer zones of 

pyrrhotite and graphitic shale.   

 

DISCUSSION 
In RPA's opinion, the areas covered by the exploration licences, as well as other areas along 

the Perkoa Mine Horizon, are very prospective for both base and precious metals.  For base 

metals, the presence of the Perkoa VMS deposit is an indicator of the prospectivity for this 

type of deposit, which generally occurs in clusters.   



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 9-7 

A significant amount of exploration work has been carried out on the permits by previous 

operators which can be used for target generation.  In RPA's opinion, Trevali should continue 

its comprehensive detailed review, compilation, and systematic exploration targeting plan, 

prior to any future significant greenfields exploration expenditures.   

 

RPA also notes that due to the ability to take advantage of existing Perkoa infrastructure and 

processing facilities, the minimum size and grade thresholds for a potentially economic deposit 

would be smaller than the same thresholds for a stand-alone greenfields discovery. 

 

In RPA's opinion, regional exploration activities should focus on the discovery of new, and/or 

upgrade of known, near surface exploration targets in the size range of approximately 250,000 

t to 500,000 t.  Based on the current life of mine (LOM) plan, a shortfall of production starting 

in 2022 will be approximately 500,000 t.  Filling this gap with pittable resources will then allow 

mining of the crown pillar which will, in effect, extend the LOM to approximately 2025.  This 

will also allow additional exploration time to explore for a Perkoa sized exploration target.

10 DRILLING 
DRILL HOLE DATABASE 
The Perkoa drill hole database contains 436 holes, totalling 86,623 m of surface and 

underground diamond core drilling (DDH).  In addition, there are 54 geotechnical drill holes 

totalling 1,350 m.  The database also contains grade control face and channel samples which 

have been converted into 980 pseudo drill holes totalling 6,722 m (Table 10-1).

The drilling history is summarized below: 

• Over the course of several campaigns prior to 2005, a total of 23,000 m of historical 
drilling was conducted by previous operators as described in Section 6.  The aim of 
this drilling was to estimate Indicated Mineral Resources as well as limited Measured 
Mineral Resources for FS purposes. 
 

• Almost 6,000 m of surface drilling was added during the 2011 to 2012 period in order 
to define the silver rich areas within the upper portion of the mine, with the aim of 
defining additional resources for conversion to open pit reserves.   
 

• Between the end of 2013 and June 2015, 17,530 m of underground infill drilling was 
completed.  Drilling followed the development of the underground mine and helped 
define most of the upper part of the mine from 70 to 280 levels. 
 

• Between December 2015 and September 2016, 9,218 m of underground infill drilling 
was completed to upgrade the resources to a higher classification between 280 and 
430 levels and complete the definition of the upper areas of the deposit. 
 

• Between March and October 2017, approximately 8,796 m of surface diamond drilling 
was successfully completed targeting the bottom part of the orebody, local extension 
for resource upgrade and validation of the bottom inferred part of the orebody (460 
level to 550 level), and local deposit exploration. 
 

• Between October and December 2017, an additional 3,961 m were drilled from surface, 
targeting near-mine exploration targets, especially on the northeast-deep trend of the 
mineralization as well as localized deposit geophysical targets.

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 10-2 

• In 2017, 12,348 m of underground diamond drilling was completed to upgrade the 
resource classification.  This campaign is ongoing with a forecasted completion in 
March 2018, and should upgrade the current Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources 
in the deep part of the mine to a Measured classification.  

 

Figure 10-1 presents a schematic vertical cross section of the Perkoa deposit illustrating drill 

traces.  Figure 10-2 presents a plan map illustrating drill hole collars.   

 

Prior to June 2017, all DDHs were drilled NQ core size and split for sampling.  Since June 

2017 underground drill holes have been drilled BQ size core, with the entire core sent for 

sampling.  Core recovery is estimated to be greater than 95%.  All surface drill core is retained.  

For underground drilling, only a few split witness holes have been kept due to storage 

limitations. 

 

Diamond drill spacing is generally 80 m by 80 m for Inferred, 50 m by 50 m for Indicated, and 

25 m by 25 m for Measured Mineral Resource classification.  Occasionally, a 20 m by 20 m 

drill spacing pattern is completed when detailed geological information is required (e.g., dyke 

locations).  All drilling is completed by Canadian contractors.  

 

Underground diamond drilling was ongoing during RPA's 2018 site visit.  RPA visited the drill 

rig drilling hole number PU-374-3, located in a drill station of the 430 Level decline (Figure 10-

3).  RPA also visited the surface core processing facility which has undergone significant 

enhancements since RPA's 2017 visit (Figure 10-4).  During the site visit RPA reviewed core 

from hole number PU 379, as well as the new bulk density / specific gravity determination set-

up.

SURVEY GRIDS 
The current survey grid used at Perkoa is UTM WGS 84 Zone 30 north. 

 

In 2013, underground development intersected traces of historical surface drill holes, and their 

coordinates in the database were found incorrect.  The error was discovered to be a conversion 

error that occurred when AIM Resources converted all local grid collar coordinates to Clark 

1880 and all collar coordinates converted to or recorded in Clark 1880 were later converted to 

WGS 84.  The error was noted and corrected in 2014 by Glencore personnel onsite, who took 

the original survey coordinates and used an accurate conversion calculation to obtain the 

correct coordinates in WGS 84.  These collar coordinate conversion adjustments have been 

verified by underground development which intersected historical drill traces or by 

underground confirmation DDHs which almost twinned the holes where errors were suspected.  

 

DRILL PLANNING AND SITE PREPARATION 
Drill holes are planned in Surpac software.  Consideration is given to the orientation of the 

drilling in relation to the geological structures, to provide for unbiased sampling.   

 

The Geologist, Drill Foreman, Mine Planner, Mine Surveyor, and Mine Manager all sign off on 

the drill hole plan prior to initiating drilling.   

 

COLLAR SURVEYS 
All surface drill hole collars are surveyed using a differential global positioning system (DGPS).  

A collar location, as well as a foresight and backsight for each side of the skid mounted surface 

rigs, are surveyed in order to facilitate drill line-up.  Upon completion of the drill hole, the Mine 

Surveyors pick up the collar location as well as the sides of the rig to check accuracy.  

 

Drill locations for underground drill holes are marked by the Perkoa Mine Survey Department.  

Surveyors mark the foresight and backsight drift walls and steel marker pins are drilled into the 

walls.  Drillers are given drill instruction sheets showing the section lines, the direction of 

drilling, and the dip of the borehole.  Drillers are allowed to field fit the collar position by up to 

50 cm in any direction. 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 10-8 

The drill foreman and geologist check the machine set-up before drilling starts and the 

underground production geologists visit the drill each day to review Environment Health and 

Safety (EHS).  The Mine Surveyors pick up the as drilled collar location upon completion of 

drilling. 

 

DOWNHOLE SURVEYING 
Historic downhole surveying was carried out approximately every 50 m downhole.  

 

Downhole surveying is currently conducted using a REFLEX Act III Rapid Descent digital core 

orientation system.  For underground drilling, an initial survey is taken at 15 m to ensure the 

correct drill hole trajectory.  If correct, subsequent surveys are taken at 30 m downhole intervals 

as well as at the total depth.  At the end of the hole, a final multi-shot survey is taken back up 

the hole with an average survey interval of approximately three metres.   

 

For surface drilling, the first survey is taken approximately 15 and then every 30 m downhole 

during drilling operations.  Upon hole completion, a full multi-shot survey is taken at 15 m 

intervals up from the bottom of the hole.  

 

All survey data is checked for any azimuth or dip variances prior to incorporation into the drill 

hole database. 

 

GEOLOGICAL CORE LOGGING 
Nantou Mining has a detailed procedure manual outlining drill hole logging and core sampling 

procedures.  Prior to 2017, all logging was completed either on paper forms or in MS Excel.  

Currently, Nantou Mining geologists are using a customized MS Access logging form with the 

same database structure as the Surpac Drill Hole Database.  Nantou Mining geologists are 

also now providing additional geological descriptions when logging, rather than just relying on 

codes.  As is standard, more detailed descriptions are completed for the regional exploration 

geological core logging.  

 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 10-9 

CORE PREPARATION 
The drill core is delivered to the surface Core Processing Facility (CPF) by the drilling 

contractor.   Prior to undertaking geological core logging and sampling, the geologist ensures 

that the core on all trays of the required borehole to be logged is identified by the borehole 

number and sequences (marked on the core trays) and sorted in proper order.   

 

The geologist initially checks the entire drill hole core for the drilled depth, recovery, cavities 

(rare), and core blocks.  The core is then carefully examined for structural features and fabric 

lineaments such as beddings and mineralization.   

 

Surface core to be split is reviewed to determined equal structural and mineralization 

distribution on both sides of selected axial planes.  The selected axial planes are then marked 

with a marker and fitted together in readiness for core splitting. 

 
CORE LOGGING 
The geologist initially checks the core for lithological contacts, core angles and extent of 

economical mineralization limits, Geological Footwall, Assay Footwall, Base of Banded Ore 

and Assay Hanging wall (GFW/AFW/BBO-AHW), by visual determination and estimations. 

 

A comprehensive geological analysis of the core is then initiated by examining and recording 

all geological information on a standard logging form including the following details: 

• Borehole Number. 

• Location (Mine, Level and Section). 

• Collar Coordinates (Easting and Northings) and Elevation. 

• Bearing (Azimuth). 

• Survey (Inclination and Azimuth). 

• Drilling Dates (Dates when drilling of the hole was started and stopped). 

• Date of Core Logging. 

• Name of the Geologist (who logs the borehole). 

• Descriptive notes and comments  

• Ground conditions. 

• Drilled interval (metres). 

• Recovery (metres of core recovered or percentage of recovered core). 

• Core angles (in degrees).

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 10-10 

• Formation. 

• Member (name of member of the rock formation). 

• Sample number. 

• Depth interval (of sampled core in metres). 

• Recovery (metres or percentage of core recovered). 

• Visual percentage estimation of mineralization. 

• Zinc, lead, and silver assay grades. 

• Mineralization type. 

• Descriptions (colour, grain sizes and shapes, alterations, textures, veining, 
mineralization habits, core condition, as well as rock hardness and Rock Quality 
Designation (RQD)). 

 

The core is photographed in a wet state just outside the core shed in natural light.   

 

GEOTECHNICAL LOGGING 
Geotechnical logging is conducted on the drill core by the geotechnical geologist who also 

performs the underground geological mapping.  The use of oriented core has yet been 

implemented at Perkoa.  Items recorded include: 

• RQD. 

• Number of discontinuities per metre. 

• Joint Number (JN), Joint Roughness (JR), Joint Alteration (JA). 

• Q-System. 

 

CORE SAMPLING 

HISTORIC PRACTICES 
Based on SRK (2009), the core from BUMIGEB drill holes was sampled every one metre within 

the mineralized zones.  The Boliden and BHP Billiton core were sampled with respect to rock 

facies contacts with the mineralized zone resulting in varying sample intervals between four 

and six metres.   

 

CURRENT PRACTICES 
Economical mineralization limits of ore minerals (GFW/AFW/BBO-AHW) are visually identified 

and carefully marked on the logged core in readiness for sampling.  Sampling criteria are 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 10-11 

focussed on sections containing grades higher than 5% sphalerite by visual estimation, 

however, currently, all sections with main mineralization areas (e.g., within the VMS) are 

sampled.   

 

Main selection criteria for infill program sampling are as follows: 

• Samples need to be limited to major lithological borders (i.e. minor dykes smaller than 
50 cm in length can be sampled within an ore sample as internal dilution). 
 

• Ore sample length must be limited to one meter and must not be smaller than 0.5 m, if 
the lithology allows it. 
 

• Waste samples must be between 0.5 m and 1.5 m. 
 

• For underground infill drilling:  
o All areas containing grades higher than 5% sphalerite (visual estimation) are 

considered as mineralized samples and must be sampled systematically.  Other 
areas should not be sampled unless they represent a continuity in an existing 
orebody (between two other richer areas or on the borders of an orebody).  

o If the mineralization is interrupted by a non-economic area (major dyke, pillar, 
etc.) the area should not be sampled if bigger than 10 m. If smaller than 10 m, 
the full area will be sampled. 
 

• For surface infill drilling: 
o All areas containing grades higher than 5% sphalerite (visual estimation) are 

considered as mineralized samples and must be sampled systematically.  Any 
other mineralized areas (containing Zn, Ag, Pb, and Au) will be sampled with 
the same criteria as the waste (longer samples) for information purposes and 
records.  

o If the mineralization is interrupted by a non-economic area (major dyke, 
uneconomic mineralization, etc.) the area should not be sampled if bigger than 
10 m.  If smaller than 10 m, the full area will be sampled. 
 

• All the ore sample areas must be "closed":  two samples of 1.5 m (adjusted on major 
lithologies) must be taken on each side of the mineralization to ensure a good closure 
of the mineralized area.  This applies to waste portions described in the point above. 
 

• All the samples must be identified on the core by clear marks showing the start and the 
end of the samples as well as the cutting line when necessary. 
 

• The tag corresponding to each sample is inserted between the core and the block to 
make sure that the sample numbers are consecutive.  QA/QC samples (blanks, 
duplicates, and reference material) are inserted after every 25th sample (one reference 
material, one blank, one reference material, one duplicate) in the sequence of 
sampling. 
 

• Photos of good quality must include the marks on the core for verification and QC 
control.

Bulk density is conducted on drill core prior to splitting.  Pre-2018, a minimum of 60%, and 

preferably 100%, of the sample length was tested using a standard Archimedean water 

displacement method.  A new bulk density apparatus, installed in 2018, now allows for 100% 

of the sample length to be tested for bulk density. 

 

The geologist samples half of the split core in interval limits of a quarter of a metre to one 

metre.  Samples do not cross lithologies.  One and one-half metre intervals are used for 

shoulder samples and in waste areas.   

 

The Core Shed Attendant splits the marked core into half along the marked axial planes using 

a diamond saw and then lays the core back in the original positions on the core trays.  

 

The sampled core pieces are packed in new small sample plastic bags and tagged with 

duplicate labelled sample tickets.  The Geologist also ensures that the Quality Assurance/ 

Quality Control (QA/QC) process is followed during sample submission. 

 

The small sample bags are then packed into larger bags which are secured to prevent 

contamination and spilling of samples during transportation to the assay laboratory. 

 

All samples sent to the assay laboratory are listed in a submission form.  This submission form 

includes:  

• The name of person authorized and the goods dispatched. 

• Any special analysis instructions. 

 

Sample batches are composed of a maximum of 100 assays and QA/QC elements. Once 

prepared and validated by the geology department head, they are sent to the Ouagadougou 

laboratory (SGS or ALS in this case) to be prepared (crushed and dry) prior to being sent to 

the respective Vancouver labs by air freight for analysis. 

 

Prior to September 2017, samples were delivered directly to SGS Ouagadougou by Perkoa 

mine transportation personnel and the reject samples were retained by SGS Ouagadougou 

and pulps are kept in either SGS Johannesburg or SGS Ouagadougou. 

 

Since September 2017, samples are delivered directly to ALS Minerals (ALS) Ouagadougou 

by Perkoa mine transportation personnel or by courier.  Once assay results are confirmed the

rejects are delivered to Perkoa and securely stored in containers.  Pulps are currently retained 

by ALS in Vancouver, Canada. 

 

UNDERGROUND CHANNEL SAMPLING 
Nantou Mining has a detailed geological procedures manual for underground sampling.  The 

purpose of this sampling is to determine the actual mineral grades of the exposed ore for use 

in determining the size and intersection grade, for use in Mineral Resource estimates.  

 

• The initial procedure is to determine that the work area is safe and that the required 
personal protective equipment (PPE) is conformed with. 
 

• Channel sampling is generally completed on the Northern or Southern wall. 
 

• The geologist or geological assistant will then mark with paint all the contacts of the 
main geological units.  The exposure will then be examined to determine the extent of 
mineralization and mark the probable sampling limits. 
 

• Having completed this classification, a tape measure is then set up, at a height of 1.5 
m above the bench, placing the zero at the extremity of the exposure.   
 

• The previously marked geological units and probable assay limits are subdivided into 
suitable sample lengths ensuring that there are no sections that cross lithologies.  The 
maximum sample length is 2.0 m and the minimum is 0.2 m. 
 

• The position of all sample divisions in relation to the tape line are recorded as a simple 
sketch (not to scale diagram) in a field note book and the tape line is fixed to a survey 
peg.  Positions of other main features relevant to the exposure are also marked on the 
sketch.  
 

• A horizontal guide line corresponding with the tape is then drawn across the marked 
sampling sections marked earlier. 
 

• Samples are then chipped using a hammer and chisel along the chalked guide line 
drawn on the sampling face.  The groove cut or in effect the ideal groove should be 10 
cm wide by 3.0 cm deep. 
 

• In hard materials where groove cut may fall short of the ideal size, a suitable sample is 
obtained by taking equitable volumes from across the intersection following the guide 
line. 
 

• Extra care is taken in sampling large concentration of minerals as they may not 
representative of the sample section as a whole. 
 

• Clean polythene bags are used for sample collection.  The sampler places a sample 
ticket number in each bag at site.  No sample will be moved until the entire exposure 
is fully sampled and the samples have been verified by the sampler.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 10-14 

• Before leaving the site, the sampler must counter check the work completed against 
the field book entry.  The number of samples in the field book must be equal to the 
physical samples in the bags. 
 

• Underground samples are brought to surface by the sampler, and then packed and 
delivered directly to the Perkoa Mine Laboratory.

11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND 
SECURITY 
HISTORIC SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
No information is available on the sample preparation, assay laboratory, or QA/QC for the pre-

2005 drill holes. 

 

Samples collected by Blackthorn Resources were assayed for Zn, Pb, Ag, Cu, and As at 

Transworld Laboratory (TWL) in Tarkwa, Ghana, using aqua regia digestion (ARD) with an 

atomic absorption (AA) finish.   

 

Samples collected by Blackthorn Resources following the BFS (2008 to 2011) were analyzed 

by ALS laboratories (ALS) in Vancouver, Canada after sample preparation in Ouagadougou, 

Burkina Faso.  The samples were analyzed by four acid digestion with inductively coupled 

atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) finish.   

 

The first channel and face samples collected onsite on mining levels 70-130 (160-220 

elevation) were all analyzed by ALS in Vancouver, Canada after sample preparation in 

Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.  These samples were analyzed using AA acid digestion with 

ICP-AES finish.  All samples assayed thereafter for channel and face samples were analyzed 

at the onsite mine laboratory by pressed pellet X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis. 

 

For the period 2013 to mid-2017, core samples were sent to SGS Ouagadougou for crushing 

and grinding.  The pulps were then sent to SGS South Africa for analysis.  The SGS 

commercial geochemical analytical laboratories in Burkina Faso and South Africa are officially 

recognized by the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS) for meeting the 

requirements of the ISO/IEC 17025 standard for specific registered tests for the minerals 

industry. 

 

Prior to analysis, the pulps were weighed (SGS Code WGF79) and test samples were dry 

screened to ensure -75 µm passing (SGS Code SCR32).   

 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 11-2 

The main assaying suite was SGS Ore-Grade Analysis Code ICP13B.  The pulps were 

analyzed by two acid digestion with ICP-AES finish for lead, zinc, and silver.  Ore-grade 

packages were used to analyse samples that have high concentrations of pay metals.  

Typically, ore-grade analyses were accomplished by adjusting the sample weight and final 

solution volume ratio, thus expanding the linear range of the analysis. 

 

SGS also inserted a suite of internal laboratory blanks and certified reference materials (CRMs 

or standards).  The frequency of inserted quality control materials was approximately 14%. 

 

CURRENT SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS 
A decision was made in early 2017 to change the analytical laboratory from SGS South Africa 

to SGS Canada to facilitate improved sample turn-around times.  Following an in-country 

sample preparation laboratory review held in August 2017, the laboratory was changed later 

to ALS.  

 

All new assays are now prepared (crushed and dried) at ALS in Ouagadougou prior to being 

sent to ALS in Vancouver for analysis.  

 

The ALS commercial geochemical analytical laboratory in Burkina Faso (independent Abilab 

Burkina SARL laboratories in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, which is part of the ALS Chemex 

group) is officially recognized by the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS) for 

meeting the requirements of the ISO/IEC 17025 standard for specific registered tests for the 

minerals industry.   

 

The ALS Vancouver laboratory is accredited by the Canadian Association for Laboratory 

Accreditation (No.  A1719) in accordance with the recognized International Standard ISO/IEC 

17025:2005.  This accreditation demonstrates technical competence for a defined scope and 

the operation of a laboratory quality management system.   

 

Iron and copper are now analyzed systematically and are included in the block model for 

metallurgical and geological purposes. 

 

After receipt at the Ouagadougou laboratory facility the samples are sorted, weighed, and 

logged into the ALS Laboratory Information Management System.  The raw samples are dried

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 11-3 

before being crushed so that 75% of the sample passes at 2 mm.  A 1.5 kg riffle split sub 

sample is removed for further preparation with the remainder being retained as a coarse reject.  

This 1.5 kg sub sample is further pulverized to pass 85% at 75 μm and then a screen test is 

used to ensure that the particle size is sufficient.  Twenty percent of pre-pulped samples 

delivered to the laboratory are screened to ensure that 85% of the sample is less than 75 μm. 

 

Samples are assayed using ICP-AES (ALS Code ME-OG46) with a method precision: ± 5%.  

A prepared sample is digested in 75% aqua regia for 120 minutes.  After cooling, the resulting 

solution is diluted to volume (100 ml) with de-ionized water, mixed, and then analyzed by ICP-

AES or by AA.  The elements analyzed and reported are listed in Table 11-1. 

 

TABLE 11-1   ALS ME-OG46

Copper Cu % 0.001 40 

Iron Fe % 0.01 100 
Lead Pb % 0.001 20 
Zinc Zn % 0.001 60 

 

Samples values below 0.01% Zn are returned as being below detection limit.  Sample values 

obtained above 30% are re-analyzed by titration (Zn-VOL50), which can determine values up 

to 100% Zn (Method Precision: ± 3.5% / Reporting Limit: 0.01% Zn to 100% Zn). 

 

ALS has internal QA/QC procedures to ensure the results are accurate.  During sample 

preparation, this includes the use of barren material to clean crushers and pulverizers at the 

beginning of each job run, confirmation of every 50th sample passing at 2 mm and 75 μm 

(SCR34), as well as determining the dust loss percentage every week. 

 

PERKOA MINE LABORATORY 
The Perkoa Mine Laboratory utilizes XRF spectroscopy.  In pressed pellet XRF, samples are 

compressed into a pellet and analyzed instrumentally.  Only lower levels of metal 

concentrations can be detected accurately by this method.  The advantages of XRF include 

rapid analysis time and accurate analyses, arising from the fact that inter-element corrections 

are well known and highly predictable.

The Perkoa Mine Laboratory analyses are used only for mine production sampling (channel 

samples, face samples, stockpile samples) and for process plant sampling.  

 

The general process for geology samples includes: 

• Receive and log in samples. 
 

• Weigh and dry in over for one hour at 100°C. 
 

• Crush to 2 mm and riffle split to 200 g. 
 

• Add 0.5 g of wax to 4.5 g of sample to create a 5.0 g pellet (for each sample two pellets 
are made). 
 

• Perkoa matrix matched XRF standards are used at the start and end of every XRF run. 
 

• Normal expected variance is approximately ±2% Zn.  Variances result in sample re-
runs.  The laboratory maintains a QA/QC spreadsheet which is reviewed daily. 
 

• Reports are sent electronically to the Geology Department.  

 

Plant samples, which arrive in liquid state, are kept separate from Geology samples at all 

stages of preparation and analysis.  In the weigh room, there are separate work benches for 

geology and metallurgical samples. 

 

RPA toured the Perkoa Mine Laboratory, and in RPA's opinion, it is professionally run.  This 

laboratory is not certified and assays are not used in the Mineral Resource estimate.  The 

Perkoa Mine Laboratory XRF assays are, however, used to determine concentrate grades.  

Composite samples are sent to Alfred H. Knight International Ltd. for independent confirmation.  

 

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
The QA/QC of the Perkoa geological database is subdivided into several exploration 

campaigns and periods of data collection.   

 

HISTORICAL QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
The historical surface drill holes and surface drilling completed by Blackthorn Resources had 

their QA/QC evaluated in the Snowden 2005 BFS.  The BFS listed all QA/QC issues and 

reviews of assays that had been completed for the FS and financing of the project.  SRK (2009) 

considered the sample preparation and analytical quality of the data to be reasonable and the

quality of the data to be appropriately reflected in the classification criteria used to estimate 

the Mineral Resources. 

 

Figures 11-1 to 11-4 present the QA/QC evaluation for all sampling conducted by Blackthorn 

Resources following the BFS (2008 to 2011) for drill holes P316 to P336.  Some low results, 

compared to the defined grade of the standard, were noted and considered to be due to the 

samples not being fully digested.

2016 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
The following discussion on QA/QC results is based on assays processed by SGS and 

received during the period from April 4, 2016 to June 21, 2016.  Nantou Mining's insertion 

rate for blanks and standards is 1 in 25. 

 
BLANKS 
The regular submission of blank material is used to assess contamination during sample 

preparation and to identify sample numbering errors.

After an investigation, Nantou Mining determined that the quartz vein blank material being 

used was not completely non-mineralized.  The source of blanks, for insertion at the core shed, 

was changed in mid-2016 to be granodiorite core sourced from the top of surface drill holes. 

 
CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIALS (STANDARDS) 

Results of the regular submission of certified reference materials (CRM) are used to monitor 

analytical accuracy and to identify potential problems with specific batches.  Specific pass/fail 

criteria are determined from the standard deviation (SD) provided for each CRM.  The 

conventional approach for setting standard acceptance limits is to use the mean assay ± two 

SD as a warning limit and ± three SD as a failure limit.  Results falling outside of the ± three 

SD failure limit must be investigated to determine the source of the erratic result, either 

analytical or clerical.  At Perkoa, the failure criterion is two consecutive standards outside the 

± two SD limit.

materials utilized in the 2016 QA/QC program.

one SD limit.  In this case, zinc is still biased high, while silver and lead appear to be biased 

low.

there is a good correlation between the two sets of results with only a slight bias seen in the

Overall, results from the 2016 QA/QC program indicated that: 

• The blank material was not barren.   
o The source material has been changed for future drill programs. 

 
• CRM results indicated a large variance and a poor reconciliation with expected values. 

o There may be matrix effects that need to be investigated. 
 

• Duplicates showed bias in the analysis with the original values higher than the duplicate 
values. 

o Umpire assaying was recommended for the 2017 QA/QC program.

2017 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL 
The following discussion on QA/QC results is based on assays processed by SGS and ALS 

Vancouver laboratories received during the period from January1 to December 10, 2017. 

 
BLANKS 
Granodiorite core, sourced from the top of surface drill holes, was used for blank material 

staring in mid-2016.  The granodiorite core has performed much better than the historical 

quartz vein blank material, however, some minor metal content is still being reported.   

 

Figure 11-10 illustrates the results for zinc.  One blank reported a suspicious value of 0.44% 

Zn, which is very close to the accepted limit of 0.5% Zn.  Nantou Mining chose to not re-assay 

this batch as no other QA/QC element demonstrated abnormal data in this batch.   

 

Five blanks reported results over 0.1% Zn No with the other blanks demonstrating small scale 

variances.  As the geological cut-off is established at 5% Zn, it was deemed that all batches 

were acceptable and no batch has been reanalyzed for the blanks.   

 

It is possible, however, that the variance in the results may come from contamination in the 

core processing facility.  RPA recommends that a review of possible contamination causes 

and corrective actions be implemented.

Figure 11-11 presents the results for other metals.  One anomalous silver value reached 6 g/t. 

No issues were found with lead and copper.  Iron values, however, demonstrated two different 

sills:  one at 0.7% Fe and the other at 3% Fe.  The variance is believed to be due to 

mineralogical variances in different granodiorite samples (possibly two distinct blank batches).

Overall, results from the 2017 QA/QC program indicate that: 

• The new granodiorite core blank material is performing well, however, some minor 
metal content is still being reported.  
 

• The 2017 CRM QA/QC results show an improvement over the 2016 results with a 
significant reduction in large variances.  
 

• Duplicates show no distinct biases for Zn or the other elements analyzed. 
o Umpire assaying is recommended for the 2018 QA/QC program. 

 
• The new ALS Webtrieve system now allows the receipt of regular assay results which 

will allow Nantou Mining to rapidly identify issues. 
 

In RPA's opinion, the QA/QC program, as designed and implemented by Nantou Mining, is 

adequate, and the assay results within the database are suitable for use in a Mineral Resource 

estimate.   

 

RPA recommends, however, that more effort be undertaken to monitor QA/QC inputs and 

results.  Also, the potential source of blank contamination must be investigated and remedied. 

 

SECURITY 
RPA is not aware of any security issues at the Perkoa mine, core processing center, or the 

Perkoa Mine Laboratory.  Access to these sites is restricted to authorized personnel and the 

facilities are securely locked when not in use.   

 

Logging, sampling, and analytical data are captured in an MS Access database, which resides 

on the company servers, and is backed up daily.  The integrity of this database is the 

responsibility of a Database Manager. 

 

Drill and mine samples are handled and transported only by Nantou Mining personnel or 

contractors.  Core samples are conveyed to ALS Ouagadougou by Nantou Mining 

transportation personnel or by courier.  Pulp sample transport is the responsibility of ALS who 

rely on commercial carriers.  Assay results are sent electronically to the Drill Database 

Administrator and are also accessible on the ALS Webtrieve system which is securely 

accessed via the internet.

HISTORICAL DRILL HOLE DATA VALIDATION 
Snowden (2005) and SRK (2009) report that they validated the historical drill hole 
data.   

 

PERKOA DRILL HOLE DATA VALIDATION 
All data imported into the drill hole database is verified by the Database Manager.  Assays are 

received electronically from ALS, and QA/QC is reviewed prior to importation as well as visually 

displayed using Surpac software.  

 

RPA SITE VISIT 
During the January 2018 site visit, RPA toured the underground operations to review geology 

and mineralization types in a number of exposures.  RPA also observed the core logging, 

sampling, QA/QC, and database management procedures conducted by the Mine Geology 

department.   

 

RPA also reviewed the geological modelling techniques and Mineral Resource estimation 

methodology with Nantou Mining geologists. 

 

RPA is of the opinion that database verification procedures for Perkoa comply with industry 

standards and are adequate for the purposes of Mineral Resource estimation. 

 

RPA recommends, however, that a comprehensive data process map, including logging and 

sampling inputs, database review, and production reconciliation studies, be undertaken in 

2018.

13 MINERAL PROCESSING AND 
METALLURGICAL TESTING 
HISTORICAL METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 
The following is an extract from the 2005 Snowden BFS. 

 

Three different laboratory testwork campaigns have been undertaken on the Perkoa deposit 

in the past. 

• Penarroya in 1987 

• Billiton in 1998 

• AIM Resources (Mintek) in 2005. 

 

All of the parties did their own sampling and Billiton also carried out preliminary testwork on 

the archived Boliden core samples.  From all of this testwork a number of broad conclusions 

were drawn. 

 

Where similar testwork has been carried out, all three parties achieved very similar results in 

their metallurgical testwork, with the main conclusions being as follows: 

• The Perkoa deposit is a high grade zinc deposit that consists of massive sulphides. 
 

• The main sulphide constituents are sphalerite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, and barite with trace 
quantities of quartz, chlorite, and muscovite. 
 

• The silicates are liberated from the sulphides at a coarse crush size and it is possible 
to reject the less dense silicates using dense medium separation without significant 
losses of zinc. 
 

• Based on Bond Work Index testwork the orebody can be classified as soft, with the 
mining waste being harder. 
 

• The sphalerite is liberated from the iron sulphides at a relatively coarse grind of 65% 
passing 75 µm. 
 

• The flotation response of the ore is generally good and a simple rougher stage is 
required to make good zinc recoveries >95% at concentrate grades >50% Zn.  It is, 
however, necessary to have a relatively low percentage of solids in the slurry fed to the 
flotation plant to minimize the interaction of gangue with the fast floating sphalerite. 
 

• Variability testwork has shown that some areas within the orebody respond better to 
flotation than others, however, there is no way to quantify the relative proportions of 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 13-2 

"good" and "poor" ores at this stage.  The predictions made in this report, however, are 
based on the entire bulk composite that was made up from the samples provided by 
Snowden and included these poor response ores - and should therefore reflect an 
"average" response. 
 

• The iron content of the sphalerite crystals is high at about 7% Fe, which cannot be 
removed by physical means, and in order to produce concentrates with a low iron 
content there is a significant drop in zinc recovery. 
 

• In general, the Perkoa concentrate can be considered "clean" with mercury and iron 
being two elements incurring small penalties. 
 

• There is silver present in the ore, however, it is unlikely that it will generate any revenue.  
There are also no other elements that are concentrated that are likely to produce a 
revenue stream from the smelter. 
 

• A high grade iron sulphide concentrate (>50% sulphur) can be produced from the zinc 
flotation tailings and there may be some economic benefit that can be realized from it.  
This would have to be the subject of another study. 
 

• No pilot plant testwork was done by any of the parties. 
 

CURRENT METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 
Testwork completed in 2017 with XPS determined that, within the orebody, there are zones 

that have an increased pyrrhotite content, which impacts recovery and concentrate grade.  

Test work to date has failed to improve or mitigate these effects. 

 

Since 2015, Nantou Mining has been carrying out a number of improvements to the processing 

plant including: ongoing improvements in process control; improved reagent dosing controls; 

improved operator knowledge base (basic training); removal of commissioning and 

engineering deficiencies; improved water consumption monitoring; improved water balance 

and discharge tracking management; and improved tailings deposition and monitoring.  

Continuous improvement includes commissioning of a metallurgical laboratory; improved 

Courier on-stream analyzer reliability; flowsheet development; operational parameters/ 

targeting/feedback; power supply stability; and commissioning of a regrind mill in October 

2017.

Table 14-2 lists the Mineral Resources individually for each domain and resource category.  

The dimensions of the envelope containing currently defined mineralized lenses are 

approximately 800 m along strike, approximately 260 m across strike, and with a maximum 

depth of approximately 850 m below surface.  The current Mineral Resource is estimated to 

550 m below surface.

During 2017, a series of changes were made to the Mineral Resource estimate due to 

increased drilling density and improved information:

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 14-4 

• Updates to the variography and search ellipsoids were used in the Ordinary Kriging 
(OK) interpolation due to the addition of new analytical data, updated wireframes and 
the isolation of a sub-domain on the southern side of the main fault. 
 

• The Mineral Resources from the 370 level to the 460 level have been completely 
upgraded to a Measured classification.  
 

• The Mineral Resources below the 490 level are now almost completely upgraded to an 
Indicated classification, due to a more confident knowledge of the deepest area of the 
existing orebodies resulting from 2017 drilling and mapping. 

 

RESOURCE DATABASE 
The Perkoa assay database used for the Mineral Resource estimate is composed of 20,318 

samples comprising:  

• Historical Surface DDH:  Consisting of 6,197 assays for Zn and Ag, plus non-
systematic Pb assays and rare Cu assays. 
 

• 2017 Infill Program Surface DDH:  Consisting of 459 assays for Zn, Pb, Ag, Fe, Cu, 
and density. 
 

• 2017 Near Deposit Exploration DDH:  Consisting of 132 assays for Zn, Pb, Ag, Fe, 
Cu, and density. 
 

• Face and Channel Samples:  Consisting of 3,902 assays for Zn, Ag, and Pb, 1,274 
of which have been analyzed directly at the Perkoa site by the plant assay laboratory 
or by portable XRF.  These samples are not used in the block model process as the 
method/laboratory accuracy is not sufficient.  Some face and channel samples were 
used in the estimation process, however, these were analyzed by SGS and the 
independently certified assays were used in the estimation.  No face/channel samples 
taken after June 2014 are included in the resource database. 
 

• Underground DDH:  Consisting of 9,628 assays.  All of the samples were historically 
analysed for Zn, Ag and Pb with 4,013 of those assays (2017 results) also having been 
analysed for Fe and Cu. 

 

RPA notes that a total of 403 of the underground DDH assay results were not completed by 

the laboratory by year-end 2017.  Visual estimations for pyrrhotite and pyrite were, however, 

added to the DDH database to allow for wireframe construction.  Bulk density measurements 

were processed manually (air weight/water weight).  The bulk density measurements of the 

holes for which the assay results are not yet received were utilized for the interpolation of the 

bulk density.

Underground drilling, which has higher confidence in the survey data due to direct survey of 

collar in WGS 84 and downhole surveys every 3 m, supersedes surface drill holes. 

 

Following validation, the Perkoa assay database used for the Mineral Resource estimate and 

Zn grade compositing consists of 17,271 samples as per the following: 

• 6,526 assays from surface DDH; 

• 1,479 assays from underground sampling; and 

• 9,266 assays from underground DDH. 

 

GEOLOGICAL MODEL 
The geological interpretation comprises wireframes for mineralization and lithological domains, 

which were developed using Surpac software.  The wireframes for lithology, including dykes, 

were generated based on logging of the major lithological units.  Continuous updating of 

wireframes is undertaken by Nantou Mining geologists, based on updates of the geological 

information from underground mapping, core logging, and both underground and core 

sampling and assaying. 

 

In the case of missing assays, the Nantou Mining geologists have used the estimated grade 

intersections based on core logging to adjust the relevant wireframes. 

 

Six of the historical surface DDH have been removed, during the interpretation process, as 

they have been challenged by underground drilling and one underground DDH has been 

removed due to considerable doubt regarding its position, following subsequent wireframe 

interpretation. 

 

A number of the basaltic and andesitic dykes are too small to accurately model for resource 

estimation purposes.  In previous years, a 12% dilution factor was added to the Mineral 

Reserve estimation methodology to account for geological dilution.  The current methodology 

is to incorporate the internal dilution that these dykes cause into the resource interpolation.  

This is achieved by leaving the dyke "waste" grades in the intercepts and composites for the 

estimation.  These grades then dilute the local area during estimation to model the geological 

loss effects of the cross cutting dykes.  These dykes are too small to be selectively mined 

around and so this approach is suitable for estimating the internal dilution of the Mineral 

Resource and resultant Mineral Reserve.

FOOTWALL MAIN LENS 
The three subdomains in the Footwall Main lens (110) are characterized by massive coarse 

grained, Zn-rich and pluri-metallic mineralization: 

• 112:  Intruded high grade zone, shape and grade altered by intrusion of granodiorite. 

• 113:  Main zone of Perkoa. 

• 114:  Low grade zone south of the main faulting system, faulted and intruded.  A new 
Footwall lens named 114 has been added to create a different domain on the southern 
part of the "Big Blue" fault where the grade distribution and the orebody morphology 
are altered and differ from the main mineralization body (Figure 14-3).

FOOTWALL SECONDARY LENS 
The Footwall Secondary lens (111) is composed of coarse grained massive sulphide of pyrite 

and sphalerite in a thin layer of mineralization almost parallel to the main lens.  The Footwall 

Secondary lens has been extended to 550 level as a result of 2017 drilling.   

 
HANGING WALL MAIN LENS 
One domain for the main Hanging Wall lens (100) is composed of a mix of dissemination, 

replacement, and veins of massive fine-grained mineralization.  Lens 100 has a lower content 

of economical metals and is less pluri-metallic.  It is the only area with substantial Cu content.  

The Hanging Wall Main lens (100) has been extended to 520 level as a result of 2017 drilling.  

Significant volume loss occurred in both the northern and the southern part of the Hanging 

Wall Main lens where the mineralization seems to be discontinuous and partially cut by 

geological features (intrusions and faults).   

 
HANGING WALL MINOR LENSES 
One domain for the Hanging Wall Minor mineralization (lenses 103 and 105) is located 

between the Hanging Wall Main and the Footwall Main lenses.  It has a composition of 

dissemination and has local veining of fine grained mineralization.  The lens is mostly low 

grade with some local enriched areas at intrusion contacts.   

 

For the 2017 Mineral Resource estimate, a small new secondary lens (103) has been modelled 

in the Hanging Wall between the Footwall Main and the Hanging Wall Main lenses.  Lens 103 

is interpolated along with lens 105 as both lenses are basically part of the same mineralogical 

horizon of disseminated to semi-massive mineralization in the Hanging Wall and are similar in 

grade, morphology, and extent.  

 

CUT-OFF GRADE 
The cut-off grade for mineralization wireframes is 5% Zn based on the approximate cost of 

milling and transport of ore to surface. 

 

The resource 5% Zn cut-off grade is honoured for most areas of the Footwall lenses as the 

grades are typically always greater than 5% Zn.  Some lower grade portions are included, 

however, if there is lithological continuity and/or internal waste within the domain.  The Hanging 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 14-10 

Wall lenses include material below the 5% Zn resource cut-off grade whenever the material is 

required to be included to maintain geological continuity in the same lithological horizons.   

 

Generally, this means that the wireframes are not simply grade shells but wireframes of the 

geological horizons that bear zinc mineralization, the grade of which varies locally.   

 

COMPOSITING 
Approximately 55% of the samples for Perkoa diamond drilling are one metre and 30% of the 

samples are 1.5 m in length (Figure 14-4).   

 

FIGURE 14-4   HISTOGRAM OF SAMPLE LENGTHS GROUPED BY SAMPLE 
TYPE 

 

 
 

A composite length of 1.5 m was used based on historical work.  Composites were made using 

Surpac software using the wireframe intercept technique where intercepts of the geological 

drill or channel traces are coded to the geological database.  Composites, including lead, silver, 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 14-11 

iron, coper, pyrrhotite, pyrite, and density, were calculated for each domain at a length of 1.5 

m.  A minimum composite length of 20 cm was required in order to be included, however, RPA 

notes that the composite files include composite lengths less than 20 cm.  The number of 

composites for zinc estimation are given in Table 14-4.   

 

TABLE 14-4   DOMAIN COMPOSITES  
Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine 

 
Code Name – Description No of Composites 
110 Footwall Main Lens 3,186 
112 Footwall Main Lens - High Grade Area 1,107 
113 Footwall Main Lens – Main Zone 2,399 
114 Footwall Main Lens – Low Grade South of the Fault 322 
111 Footwall Secondary Lens 350 
100 Hanging Wall Main Lens 902 
102 Hanging Wall Minor Lens 34 

103 & 105 Hanging Wall Minor Lens 358 
 

For the Footwall Main domain, the 112 and 113 lenses are overlapping to allow a smooth 

transition at the border of the two domains (soft boundary), whereas lens 114 is separated by 

a hard boundary and the composites are completely independent from one domain to the 

other. 

 

Composites at zero grade, due to absence of data (e.g., pending assays), were deleted, unless 

they represented a modelled dyke intersection.  Composites that intersected modelled dykes 

were voided during the estimation process.  The intrusives that are not modelled (too small or 

that are not continuous enough) are taken into account in the compositing and will slightly 

dilute the composites, which results in an induced dilution for minor intrusions. 

 

Compositing for the other attributes of the block model comprises the face and channel 

samples analyzed on site as they are interpolated only for informational purpose. 

 

In RPA's opinion, the optimum composite length should be 2.0 m, with a minimum length of 

0.5 m, as compositing to 1.5 m results in the splitting of predominate median standard sample 

length of 1.0 m.

TREATMENT OF HIGH GRADES (CAPPING) 
For the 2017 Mineral Resource estimate grade capping was reviewed, per lens, using 

histograms and log probability charts.  A grade cap was then applied to the composites to 

avoid the use of anomalous data leading to local overestimation of the grade (Table 14-5).

Code Name – Description 
Cap Value

111 Footwall Secondary Lens 32 
100 Hanging Wall Main Lens 30 
102 Hanging Wall Minor Lens 30 

103 & 105 Hanging Wall Minor Lens 34 
 

In RPA's opinion, the grade caps are reasonable as demonstrated in the histograms and log 

probability plots, and are more appropriate than the previously used single 50% Zn grade cap.  

RPA is of the opinion that grade capping should be applied to the raw assays prior to 

compositing as per best industry practice.

The block model is rotated, with a size of 5 m by 5 m by 5 m, which is then sub-blocked to a

The same parameters are used for zinc, density, and secondary estimation.  The parameters 

for lens 110 are only used for secondary attributes estimates (lead, silver, pyrite, and 

pyrrhotite), whereas the more accurate lens 112 and 113 parameters are used for zinc and 

density.   

 

In RPA's opinion, the updated 2017 Perkoa variography study provides better interpolation 

parameters and will result in more accurate Mineral Resource estimations, especially for the 

Hanging Wall lenses, where the impact on the Hanging Wall Main lens is significant.  A 

discontinuity in the grade has been discovered in this region that highlights the complexity of 

this mineralization. 

 

BLOCK MODEL INTERPOLATION 
For each mineralization lens, three methods of interpolation are applied in order to interpolate 

the Zn grade: 

• OK is used as a primary estimation method and the results of this interpolation are 
used in the final block model for Mineral Resource reporting. 
 

• ID and NN interpolation methods are also used in order to compare and validate the 
model against the kriging results. 

 

The block model interpolation is completed in three passes.  If the minimum number of assays 

is not found during the first pass, the ellipse is enlarged in the consecutive pass to try to find 

more assays.  If the requirement is still not reached, the ellipse is increased again (Table 14-

10).  For each step, an attribute code of either 1, 2, or 3 is assigned to the block.  A default 

value of 0 is applied to all the blocks that have not been interpolated due to a lack of data.

BULK DENSITY 
Since mid-2015, Nantou Mining has been systematically measuring specific gravity on 

diamond drill core samples using a standard Archimedean water displacement method (air 

weight/water weight) procedure.  This has allowed for higher precision for estimating bulk 

density in the block model.  The mean interpolated bulk density values, per domain, are listed 

in Table 14-11.

Default bulk density for the tuff host waste rock is fixed at 3.0 t/m3, which represents a mean 

value based on 4,302 measurements.  Mean bulk density values based on physical 

measurements are assigned to each dyke's domain.  Dyke 502 is located far from the 

mineralization and is only modelled for geotechnical purpose.

MINERAL RESOURCE CLASSIFICATION 
Mineral Resource classification is based on the interpolation pass estimate attribute as well as 

the Qualified Person's level of geological knowledge and information (e.g., sufficient density of 

underground development or DDH in the area). 

 

• For every interpolated block, a resource category attribute is assigned according to the 
level of estimation of the block (e.g., 1 for Measured, 2 for Indicated, and 3 for Inferred).  

 
• The categories of the two well defined main lenses (domains 112, 113, and 100) are 

adjusted to fit the geological information (good density of geological mapping, channel 
sampling, or DDH information in the area). 

 
• The other domain resource categories are adjusted to include the number of holes 

used for the interpolation, requesting three holes to be classified as per the pass 
estimate criteria.  This aims to take into account the geological discontinuity of those 
lenses as well as the greater uncertainty due to the lower amount of information (e.g. 
not drilled systematically). 

 

Using this data, and to reduce the "spotted dog" effect, wireframes are created using Surpac 

software to represent the areas of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Mineral Resources 

defined for each lens.  Resource class is then assigned to each interpolated block in the 

relevant box using Surpac software.   

 

In RPA's opinion, the Mineral Resource classification at Perkoa is in accordance with CIM 

(2014) definitions.   

 

MINING DEPLETION 
Following estimation and classification, the block model is depleted using the actual 

development and stoping void solids from survey pick-ups and cavity monitoring surveys 

(CMS).  All the attributes of the affected blocks are then reset to default values.  One copy of 

the non-voided block model is also saved for past-production reconciliation purpose, as well 

as to assist in estimation validation. 

 

UNRECOVERABLE AND STERILIZED MATERIAL 
Once the mining depletion had been completed, any "unrecoverable" areas, such as unbroken 

ore from completed stopes, design pillars, abandoned low grade areas, crown pillars, etc., are

considered as unrecoverable, completely sterilized, and are extracted from the Mineral 

Resource estimate. 

 

Table 14-12 outlines the losses from mining and pillars, which was extracted from the block 

model.   

 

Additional solid wireframes were created in Surpac to represent these different areas and 

extract the data in a similar fashion to that described in Mineral Resource Classification.

Table 14-13 lists the areas that have been determined to be potentially uneconomic and are 

not included in the Mineral Resource estimate.  Generally, this material is located in the two 

main lenses for which no mine plan has yet been established (future pillars, crown pillar, actual 

and planned low grade or un-mineable areas).  Most of the secondary lenses are also not 

considered in the mine plan due to geotechnical or economic reasons.  In practice, however, 

part of the secondary lenses are included in some mined stopes, and/or are mined as 

development ore when intersected.

RPA VALIDATION  
RPA reviewed the Perkoa Mineral Resource interpolation inputs and methodology.  Data was 

loaded into Micromine v.16.5 geological software.  The block model was validated by 

completing a series of visual inspections against wireframes and drill holes.  The checks 

showed good agreement between drill hole composite values along sections and plans.  RPA's 

overall compiled Mineral Resource estimate showed no material differences to that reported.

RECONCILIATION 
Nantou Mining has a standard end of month (EOM) production measurement system that 

reports and provides reconciliation between geology and the monthly mine production. 

 
• The contractor records the trucks loaded underground on a daily basis.  The location 

from which trucks are loaded must be recorded (stoping, development, stockpile).  The 
trucks from underground tip the ore in the demarcated areas on the ROM pad 
according to the geologist's plan.  
 

• The geologist records the number of trucks reporting to the ROM pad and underground 
location.  The truck count for the past 24 hours is reported to the geologist at the end 
of the night shift.   
 

• The geologist compares the truck count to the contractor daily production sheet.  The 
number of trucks must be agreed at every daily morning mining meeting.  Any 
discrepancies are corrected the same day.  
 

• The surveyors perform a mid-month and EOM CMS survey report including: 1) total 
tons blasted, 2) total removed from stope, 3) total hauled to the surface, and 4) closing 
floor stock. 
 

• The geologist and the contractor agree on the mid-month and EOM production 
reconciled with the CMS stope scans.  Any discrepancies are highlighted.  
 

• Densities are adjusted based on final grade.  
 

• The surveyors perform a ROM pad and Fine Ore Stockpile (FOS) survey every Monday 
and Friday.  The stockpile measurement is reconciled with the production recorded by 
the geology and the crushed tons reported by the plant.  Any discrepancies are 
highlighted and explained. 
 

• The geologist records the daily tonnes crushed as per Conveyor 1 (Primary Crusher).  
The ROM stockpile is calculated and reported on a daily basis.  Average ROM pad's 
grade is adjusted according to production and crush grades. 
 

• The geologist conducts a control of the truck loads at least two times per month.  For 
each control, a minimum of eight trucks must be called randomly to a demarcated area 
and the actual load must be measured over the weighbridge.  Adjustment to the trucks 
capacities and ROM pad densities must therefore be performed according to the 
results.   
 

• At the end of the month, geology and survey departments perform a reconciliation of 
the total production as agreed on a daily basis with the EOM CMS measurement.  The 
final figure is reported as the mine ore production. 

 

Figures 14-11 to 14-13 present charts of the Perkoa mine production Zn grades versus 

reported process plant Zn grades from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017.

Figure 14-11 shows the daily Zn grade reported by the mine (Block Model adjusted with grade 

control) in grey, the daily Zn grade reported by the processing plant (measured on the conveyor 

just before milling) in red, and the variance between the two reported in green.  Values below 

the black line indicate an underestimation of Zn grade by the mine, and above black line 

indicates an overestimation of Zn grade by the mine. 

 

Figure 14-12 shows the variability in daily reporting of Zn grades from mine production (blue) 

and feed (orange).  All data are centred on their average so the left scale is representing the 

variance (in STD deviation).  The mine variability results from the various grades of the stopes 

being mined during a same period.  The feed variability represents the ability of keeping the 

feed stable (blending and stockpiling). 

 

Figure 14-13 is the same as Figure 14-12, however, the data is not centred.  The left axis 

represents the variability in Zn grade instead of standard deviation.   

 

In RPA's opinion, the overall reconciliation between geology and the monthly mine production 

is reasonable.

15 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATE 
The Mineral Reserve estimate was completed by Nantou Mining and reviewed by RPA with an 

effective date of December 31, 2017 (Table 15-1).  RPA is not aware of any mining, 

metallurgical, infrastructure, permitting, or other relevant factors that could materially affect the 

Mineral Reserve estimate.

Notes: 

1. CIM (2014) definitions were followed for Mineral Reserves. 
2. Mineral Reserves are estimated at an NSR cut-off value of $100/t inclusive of capital 

expenditure, incremental stopes greater than US$80/t are included based on individual 
financial analysis. 

3. Mineral Reserves are estimated using an average consensus forecast zinc price of 
US$1.20 per pound and a €/US$ exchange rate of 1.08. 

4. Shown at 100% ownership. 
5. Numbers may not add due to rounding. 

 

Mineral Reserves are estimated from the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources.  RPA 

has performed an independent verification of the block model tonnes and grade, and in RPA's 

opinion, the process has been carried out to industry standards. 

 

The Mineral Reserve estimation at the Perkoa mine has been completed by the Senior Mine 

Planner, who has sufficient long term planning experience, and is reviewed by the Glencore 

Zinc Technical Services Team. 

 

In order to evaluate Mineral Reserves, Nantou Mining has developed an internal life of mine 

(Internal LOM) plan, effective December 31, 2017, which includes Proven and Probable 

Mineral Reserves as well as factored Inferred Mineral Resources.  After scheduling all 

development and stopes using Minesched software, the mined Mineral Resource tonnes were 

classified as Proven Mineral Reserve tonnage, Probable Mineral Reserve tonnage, and 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 15-2 

Internal LOM only tonnage.  The Internal LOM only tonnage is not included in the official 

Mineral Reserve estimate as it comprises Inferred Mineral Resources.  

 

KEY FINANCIAL ASSUMPTIONS 

MINING REVENUE 
Revenue of any given parcel of material is calculated using a Net Smelter Return (NSR) 

equation, which takes into account all the latest financial and recovery information to generate 

a single revenue dollar figure for any particular grade combination found in the mine.  The 

calculation uses 2017 assumptions for metal prices, current concentrator recoveries, and 

budgeted downstream transport and realization costs. 

 

The NSR equation used in the 2017 Mineral Reserve estimate is NSR_LT = (14.49 x Zn%).  

The equation is applied throughout the geological model to populate an NSR field for each 

individual block.   

 

A zinc metal price assumption of $1.20/lb and a €/US$ exchange rate assumption of 1.08 are 

based on average long term price for the next five years. 

 

Metallurgical recovery and concentrate grade assumptions are based on the 2017 actual 

results with a zinc recovery of 92.9% and a zinc concentrate grade of 53.4%.  The metallurgical 

recovery used for reserve estimation is based on average recovery and concentrate grade 

curves according to an average reserve grade of 13.2% Zn.  Although there is likely to be a 

differential recovery tendency throughout the orebody, only one set of recovery figures is used 

for all material types found in the deposit. 

 

OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS 
Mining and milling costs used for the Mineral Reserve NSR calculation have been extracted directly 

from the actual 2017 operating costs.   

 

The costs include: 

• All operating costs (mining, on-site crushing, ore transport to mill and milling). 
 

• All administration costs. 
 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 15-3 

The average mining, milling, and maintenance cost over the Internal LOM is $80.00/t.  This 

cost increases to $102.80/t with the inclusion of general and administrative (G&A) costs for the 

underground operation. 

 

MINING MODIFYING FACTORS 
The block model provided for use in the Mineral Reserve estimate was in Surpac format. 

 

Stope shapes were generated based on the above mentioned geological block model and 

revenue parameters.  These shapes represent all available mineable shapes, which meet 

several important requirements: 

• Create a net profit given the expected material revenue, and the cost per tonne (long 
term NSR > $100), or each stope must prove itself to be profitable to mine based on 
an individual financial analysis.  Some stopes exist in the LOM plan down to $80/t 
however, these are deemed profitable based on activity based accounting.  
 

• Stope dimensions are such that it meets the current mine plan (level spacing, etc.). 
 

• Stope geometry is practically feasible to extract (drilling angle limitations, etc.). 
 

• Stope shapes meet geotechnical limitations (hanging wall stability). 
 

• Exclude material which is either already mined out or planned to be mined by 
December 31, 2017. 
 

• Exclude majority of material which is of low geological confidence (Inferred Mineral 
Resources). 

 

Stope shapes have been designed manually using Surpac software respecting the above-

mentioned criteria.  The resultant shapes were evaluated against the geological resource 

model to report the tonnes and grade for each stope shape. 

 

Stope modifying factors were applied, post-geological interrogation, in the Reserve 

spreadsheet to generate the final diluted and recovered Mineral Reserve.  The Mineral 

Reserve spreadsheet was used to categorize the Mineral Reserves into Proven and Probable 

classifications. 

 

The Mineral Reserve spreadsheet, which summarizes the conversion from resources to 

reserves, indicates that each individual stope or mining block is assessed separately and that 

an estimate of the internal waste to be mined is carried out for each stope.  This quantity of 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 15-4 

estimated waste can vary from a low of 0% of the Mineral Resource to a high of 37%.  The 

waste is added to the resource tonnage at zero grade to arrive at a Mineral Reserve tonnage 

and grade.  An additional 15% unplanned dilution is then added and then a 95% recovery is 

applied.  This recovery has been applied to allow for any ore loss that may occur during stope 

extraction and aligns with historical data on site. 

 

Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are respectively converted to Proven and 

Probable Mineral Reserves.   

 
The final Mineral Reserves are based on stopes that must meet the following criteria: 

• The stope must be mineable.  Geology and geotechnical information are used to 
determine the optimal dimensions, practical geometry criteria, and whether a stope can 
be extracted safely. 
 

• The stope must be profitable. 
o The stopes are first created using an incremental cut-off NSR grade of $80 per 

tonne.  This value reflects the current costs of trucking the ore to the surface, 
onsite crushing, and concentrating.  This value assumes that all other costs 
leading up to this point are sunk costs. 

o During the optimization process, the low grade stopes are discarded if they do 
not meet the economic criteria of the long term NSR > $100.  However, some 
marginal stopes can be included in the LOM where development is required to 
access some other area of the deposit or to mine some other stopes.  Hence 
the full cost of production is reduced.  An in-house "stoping cost evaluation" 
spreadsheet is used to evaluate in detail those specific areas of the mine and 
determine whether a stope or a mining front is economic or not when marginal. 

o Finally, several stopes of the Hanging Wall plus the full 550 level have been 
discarded from Mineral Reserves and LOM as the operation cost exceeds the 
profit from these lower grade stopes.  Additional diamond drilling targeting the 
550 level, the deep part of the Hanging Wall lens, and some marginal areas will 
be completed during Q1 2018 to assess the possibility of economical 
optimization for those zones of the deposit.

16 MINING METHODS 
The Perkoa mine is an underground operation, however, a small open pit was mined to reach 

near surface material during initial start-up to increase plant throughput as the underground 

mine ramped up production.  The pit is now complete.  Underground mining with contractors 

carrying out all aspects of the mining process commenced in February 2013.   
 

All mining operations are currently being carried out by a mining contractor, which supplies 

manpower and equipment.  Nantou Mining personnel provide geological and engineering 

services. 
 

The mine is accessed via an 85 m long decline in the box cut prior to entering the portal.  The 

main decline has currently been developed to between the 460 m and 490 m level 

(approximately 450 m below the surface).  Figures 16-1 and 16-2 are longitudinal sections of 

the current mine development plan. 
 

The decline and associated cross cuts are excavated in the competent quartz diorite of the 

footwall.  The 5.3 m wide x 5.5 m high decline is a spiral and the level spacing is set at 30 m.  

Each level is identical with a footwall drive, sumps, and services cubbies (Figure 16-3).  A 

ventilation shaft connects all levels of the mine and acts as an emergency egress via the 

sinking bucket (kibble).  A further secondary ventilation ramp egress exists into the completed 

open pit to allow personnel to escape on foot in an emergency situation.  A 35 m crown pillar 

has been maintained between the open pit and underground production workings.  The top 

extraction level is 70 level with mining currently occurring down to 400 level.   
 

Longhole stoping is being used as the primary extraction method.  There are several variations 

on this mining method employed such as longitudinal and transverse, with both bottom-up and 

top-down mining sequences.  The exact method chosen is dependent on the orebody 

geometry.  Stopes are backfilled with either cemented rock fill (CRF) or waste.

Longitudinal bottom-up stoping has been used above 190 level.  Due to the orebody width and 

mine sequencing, stopes between 190 level and 280 level are mined using the transverse 

method with primary and secondary stopes, with some longitudinal retreat mining occurring at 

the extremities of the orebody (Figure 16-2).  All of the primary stopes above 280 level have 

been mined out with the remaining ore to be mined as secondary stopes (Figure 16-3).   

 

A recoverable sill pillar has been established on 310 level in order to be able to convert the 

mining below 310 level to a bottom-up longitudinal retreat method which is expected to reduce 

the amount of development required.  As well, a higher percentage of waste backfill instead of 

CRF can be used with this method which is expected to lower the mining cost. 

 

The majority of the stopes to be mined are located in the Footwall Lens of the orebody (Figure 

16-4).  Figures 16-4 and 16-5 are longitudinal sections of the current mining plan (green fill 

denotes a mined out stope) for the Footwall and Hanging Wall Lenses.  The Hanging Wall 

stopes (Figure 16-5) are mined in a combination of top-down open stope longitudinal retreat 

and bottom-up mining utilizing CRF. 

 

For the Footwall lens, bottom-up mining will be utilized between 400 level and 310 level and 

top-down longitudinal retreat primary and secondary stoping will be utilized between 400 level 

and 520 level.  The current limit of the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves is at 520 level.  

The majority of the Footwall Lens stopes below 520 level are in a portion of the orebody which 

is classified as an Inferred Mineral Resource.  This area will require infill drilling in order to 

upgrade the Inferred Mineral Resource to a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource. 

 

For the Hanging Wall lens, bottom-up mining will be utilized between 430 level and 310 level 

and top-down longitudinal retreat primary and secondary stoping will be utilized between 430 

level and 520 level.  The current limit of the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves is at 520 

level.  The majority of the Hanging Wall stopes below 520 level are in a portion of the orebody 

which is classified as an Inferred Mineral Resource.  This area will require infill drilling in order

When the full stope area has been mined out, voids are backfilled with CRF for primary stopes. 

Secondary stopes are filled with waste.  The fill serves both to support stope walls and to 

provide a working platform for equipment when mining the next slice.  Run of mine (ROM) 

waste and crushed material (100 mm all-in) is mixed with different binder percentages, 

depending on the application.  The CRF is mixed in dedicated underground sumps.  During 

2017, a total of 356,000 t of CRF and waste were placed, which was approximately 55% of the 

stoping ore mined during the year.   

Production drilling is by one Sandvik DL421 longhole drill with either 89 mm or 102 mm holes 

being drilled.  Drill productivity is approximately 350 m/day.  Burden is 2.8 m and spacing is 

3.2 m.  Figure 16-6 illustrates some typical stope drilling patterns. 

Ore and waste is loaded by three scooptrams.  The scooptrams are remotely operated using 

line of site and full tele-remote operation technology.  Approximately 70% of each stope is 

mucked with the tele-remote scooptrams.  Three 60 t trucks take the ore to the ROM pad (ore 

stockpile), and waste to the waste dump.  In addition, there are a dozen or so pieces of 

assorted heavy mobile equipment to support the mining and processing operations. 

Explosives, ammonium nitrate, slurry mix, and accessories are transported to the site from 

Ouagadougou by BME, the explosives supplier which is a member of the Omina Group.  All 

charging underground is provided by the mining contractor using its own equipment. 

Nantou Mining only keeps the minimum required stock on hand (approximately four days) as 

BME have a large storage and manufacturing facility 15 km away.  Emulsion is the primary 

explosive used.  The explosives are stored in a small magazine located at the southern 

perimeter of the site behind the oxide and open pit waste dumps.  There are separate areas 

for emulsion and initiation systems, all stored in Mine Department approved facilities.  In 

addition, Nantou Mining has a day magazine underground which is used to hold one to two 

days' supply in a magazine built to South African Mine Regulation standards.

GEOMECHANICS, GROUND SUPPORT 
Ground conditions at Perkoa have been classified into three types, Type 1, Type 2, and Type 

3, with Type 1 being good ground.  Type 1 ground is usually in the quartz diorite footwall rock, 

Type 2 ground is the hanging wall unit, and the Type 3 ground classification is used where the 

rock is very weak, either from blasting or from complex structures, such as dykes.   

 

Ground conditions observed during the underground visit were good.  Nantou Mining has 

developed ground support standards for various sizes of development headings.  Permanent 

excavations, such as declines, remuck bays, level accesses, ventilation accesses, etc., are 

supported with nine 2.4 m double corrosion protection (DCP) grouted expansion bolts every 

two metres along the drift, plus wire mesh to within 3.7 m of the floor, and 2.4 m long 47 mm 

splitsets every two metres along both walls of the drift.  Temporary excavations, such as ore 

drives, are supported with eleven 2.4 m long 47 mm splitsets every two metres along the drift 

plus wire mesh to within 3.05 m of the floor. 

 

INFRASTRUCTURE 

MINE VENTILATION 
Nantou Mining is using an exhaust ventilation system with three 315 kW axial flow primary 

ventilation fans located on surface near the northeastern edge of the open pit and currently 

delivering 200 m3/s to the underground.  These fans exhaust the air through a dedicated up-

casting ventilation shaft that intersects all levels.  The fresh air intake is down the decline, and 

at each sublevel, there is a secondary booster fan taking fresh air into the workings.  During 

2018, the ventilation system is being expanded to include two new fresh air intakes.  The 

decline will remain the primary fresh air route and the north return air way (RAW) will remain 

the primary exhaust shaft.  The ventilation management plan was designed by external 

consultants and onsite engineers monitor and update the plan monthly. 

 

During 2017, Nantou Mining transformed the existing escapeways into pressurized fresh air 

ways, allowing the safe travel or safe shelter from 520 level up to 70 level, in the event of an 

emergency.  Also planned for 2018 is a system to rapidly exhaust air from the explosive 

magazine directly to the north RAW in the event of an explosion/fire inside the magazine.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 16-11 

A second access has been established into the open pit at 70 level and is also considered a 

fresh air intake.  Escape ways have been established in fresh air and are sealed from the rest 

of the mine by utilizing the 70 level access.   

 

In RPA's opinion, the ventilation system is appropriate and provides an adequate quantity of 

fresh air for the operation. 

 

MINE DEWATERING 
The mine is considered a dry mine with little or no ground water inflows, however, on each 

level there is a dewatering sump with a single Flygt 37 kW pump.  Water is pumped up to the 

next level until 70 level is reached.  Here, water enters a settling dam before overflowing to a 

clear water dam where a single Mono pump capable of handling 5 L/s pumps the water to 

surface. 

 

On 280 level, a new pump station has been being built and all water below 70 level drains to 

280 level before being pumped to 70 level.  This station currently consists of one 130 kW Mono 

pumps with a capacity of 12.5 L/s pumping water in one of two rising mains to surface.  A 

second standby Mono is in the process of being installed.  The existing pumping system will 

be retained as a backup. 

 

Great care has been taken to manage rainfall in the portal box cut as this is the biggest 

exposure to flood.  The box cut walls have either been sheeted with plastic or shotcreted and 

the benches have been concreted to control storm water runoff.  Two separate sumps have 

been built in the box cut to capture water so as to minimize water entry into the portal.  One 

sump is at the portal entrance and the other is mid-way up the box cut.  Each has two Flygt 

pumps, one 37 kW and one 90 kW, and both sumps pump water to the surface. 

 

MINE POWER 
The underground mine is supplied with power from five Connell power generators that contain 

Caterpillar 3516B generators, assembled in shipping containers.  The generators have an 

output of 1.6 MW-0.4 kV and are located adjacent to the underground mine ventilation fans.  A 

transformer is located at the switch room and steps the power up from 400 V to 11 kV for 

distribution to the underground mine.  Diesel is supplied to each generator by fuel truck.

ORE STOCKPILES 
The mine has an established stockpile plan, which includes high grade (18% to 20% Zn), 

medium grade (14% to 18% Zn) and low grade (~10% Zn).  Each day, the geology department 

issues stockpile blending instructions to the processing plant with the aim of achieving a more 

consistent head grade in the range of 13% to 14% and 13% to 14% Fe as well as a Zn:Fe ratio 

of 1.0.  As of January 18, 2018, the total ore on the stockpile was 51,500 t grading 16.7% Zn 

and 16.3% Fe. 

 

LIFE OF MINE PLAN 
As part of the 2018 Budget process, carried out in mid-2017, Nantou Mining has developed a 

LOM plan based on the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, which projects production to 

2022 with a total of 3.33 Mt being mined at a grade of 13.1% Zn.   

 

The LOM plan schedule has been built around economic stopes that exceed the $80/t 

incremental mining cost.  Stopes have been cut using Surpac geology and mining software 

using the resource block model constrained to $100/t NSR.  The required development has 

then been designed in order to reach these mining locations.   

 

The LOM plan schedule is based upon a process plant capacity of 690,000 tpa to 700,000 tpa 

and is shown by year in Table 16-1.

17 RECOVERY METHODS 
PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
The process plant at Perkoa is a conventional sulphide flotation plant capable of processing 

2,000 tpd and is currently operating at approximately 1,900 tpd.  The process plant includes 

crushing, screening, and grinding, followed by zinc flotation and filtering to produce a zinc 

concentrate (Figure 17-1).  The process plant originally included a lead recovery circuit, 

however, this circuit is no longer used and has been reconfigured to increase capacity in the 

zinc circuit due to higher zinc head grades. 

 

The ROM ore is fed through a grizzly to the primary jaw crusher at a rate of approximately 150 

tonnes per hour (tph).  The product is sent to a secondary cone crusher circuit operating in 

closed circuit with a screen, splitting at 10 mm.  The screen oversize (+10.0 mm) is sent to the 

cone crushers.  Product from the cone crushers is returned to the primary screen.  The 

undersize (-10.0 mm) from the primary screen is sent to the mill feed stockpile. 

 

From the mill feed stockpile, the ball mill (10.5 ft x 16 ft) is fed at a rate of 85 tph to 88 tph 

solids feed pending on variations in mineral hardness.  The ball mill operates in closed circuit 

with cyclones to produce a zinc flotation feed with a minimum of 60% of the cyclone overflow 

product passing 200 mesh (75 μm)(P60 75µ).  

  

The flotation feed is sent to a conditioner where reagents (hydrated lime, copper sulfate 

(CuSO4), xanthate, and frother) are added before it passes on to rougher tank cells.  High 

grade concentrate from the first three roughers is sent to final concentrate and the low grade 

concentrate from the last rougher is sent to the cleaner circuit.

The rougher tailings go to the scavenger circuit, where the concentrate from the first and 

second scavenger cells is sent to final concentrate, while the concentrate from the rest of the 

scavenger cells is sent to the regrinding circuit.  Cyclone overflow is sent to the 

cleaner/scavenger circuit.  Concentrate from the first three cleaning cells is sent to final 

concentrate.  The scavenger concentrate is recycled to the head of the cleaning circuit while 

the tails from the cleaner circuit are combined with the rougher tails to feed the scavenger 

circuit.  The scavenger tailings go to the final tailings. 

 

The concentrate from the cleaners is sent to final concentrate, with the tailings sent to the 

cleaner/scavenger circuit, where the concentrate is recirculated back to the head of the cleaner 

circuit.  The cleaner/scavenger circuit tailings are sent to the head of the scavenger circuit. 

 

The final concentrate is sent to a zinc concentrate thickener and Larox pressure filter for 

dewatering.  

 

The final zinc concentrate from the Larox filter is discharged onto a drying floor, where it is 

dried and stockpiled until loaded onto trucks for dispatch to the port of Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. 

 

HISTORICAL PLANT PERFORMANCE 
From 2013 to 2017, the process plant produced (Table 17-1) a zinc concentrate in the range 

of 50.6% Zn to 53.0% Zn from head grades ranging from 6.3% Zn (open pit) to 15.2% Zn 

(underground).  Recovery of zinc has been in the range of 89.3% to 96.7%.  In general, the 

Perkoa concentrate can be considered "clean", with mercury and iron being two elements 

incurring small penalties.

CONCENTRATE HAULAGE  
Zinc concentrates are trucked 1,200 km to the port of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.  In 2017, 178,756 

wet metric tonnes (wmt) were hauled in 4,157 trips (11 trucks per day, 45 tonnes per truck).  A 

round trip takes seven days; three days from site to Abidjan and four days to return due to 

delays at the border between Côte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.  The trucks backhaul clinker for 

the local cement market.  This helps to reduce costs, however, it increases the haul cycle. 

 

Transportation of concentrates involves several parties requiring close supervision to co-

ordinate and organize each party's internal priorities including: 

• The safe loading of transport trucks. 

• On site weighing of transport trucks. 

• On site sampling of concentrate. 

• Assay and quality monitoring. 

• Safety inspection of transport trucks prior to leaving site. 

• Road conditions. 

• Customs and duty inspections. 

• Port congestion. 

• Socio-political situations. 

 

During 2017, a total of 137,769 wmt of zinc concentrates were shipped from the port on a sales 

basis.  Destinations were Belgium, Italy, Germany, and Spain.

POWER 
The supply of power from the national grid is unreliable.   

 

Power to the plant, mine, workshops, camp and offices is supplied from a central powerhouse 

which has five Caterpillar 3516B-HD (2 MVA) generators.  Power usage at the central power 

station is approximately 2.5 MW to 3.2 MW, which means that normally three generators run 

at approximately 60% capacity, at any one time.   

 

An 11 kV overhead power transmission line is installed between the central powerhouse and 

the mine switch room to provide power to the underground mine.  

 

Fire detection and automatic AFFF fire suppression systems are installed on the individual 

generator sets and in the switch room.  

 

Routine servicing and condition monitoring is done on site with the assistance of Burkina 

Equipment, the local Caterpillar representative.  Regular overhauls of the generator units are 

scheduled and outsourced to Burkina Equipment.  

 

There are a further approximately 10 mobile generators available with outputs from 20 kVA to 

500 kVA to rig for power where required, such as for pumping of water.  

 

Nantou Mining has a maintenance department consisting of 110 personnel, of which >90% are 

nationals.

TAILINGS STORAGE FACILITY 
Plant tailings are deposited onto a tailings storage facility (TSF) immediately adjacent to the 

process plant (Figure 18-2).  The initial Environmental and Social Impact Study carried out in 

2006 was based on the construction of a TSF composed of three cells with an area of 7 ha, 

10 ha, and 9 ha respectively.  Two of the three cells have been constructed.  The original 

starter dam is full and filling of the Phase 2 dam started in January 2016.  The Phase 2 dam 

was completed in September 2017.  The Phase 1 dam is approaching fill completion with the 

Phase 2 dam awaiting completion of the filling cycle of Phase 1.  Phase 3 will begin 

construction towards the end of 2018 or beginning of 2019.  A Phase 4 lift is planned which 

connects all three phases to create one final dam by lifting the structural.  The decision to 

construct the Phase 4 wall is dependent on life of mine as the construction of Phase 3 will 

provide enough capacity to handle all of the tailings in the current LOM plan.

19 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
MARKETS 
Global zinc demand continues to rise by between 2% to 4% per annum (or 280,000 t to 560,000 

t of zinc metal) driven by gross domestic product (GDP) growth, urbanization, and 

infrastructure development, and as a "mid-cycle" commodity with expanding markets for 

consumer goods (automobiles, appliances, etc.).  Mine closures and production cuts over the 

past few years have constrained primary supply which has driven the zinc price to near-decade 

highs. 

 

Zinc smelters are scaling back/curtailing refined zinc metal production due to concentrate 

shortages.  Benchmark zinc smelter treatment charges (TCs) dropped to US$172/tonne in 

2017, with no smelter price participation (0% escalators), a 10-year low.  TCs for 2018, are 

US$147/t. 

 

Consensus forecast is for continued strength in zinc prices in reaction to ongoing supply 

deficits.  Wood Mackenzie, an independent global commodity forecast consultant, is predicting 

robust zinc commodity prices over the short-term; averaging US$1.71/lb in 2018, US$1.87/lb 

in 2019, and a long-term forecast price of US$1.23/lb.   

 

CONTRACTS 
As part of the August 31, 2017 definitive agreements (transaction), Trevali entered into life of 

mine concentrate offtake agreements with Glencore for all concentrates at International 

Benchmark terms, that is, average London Metal Exchange (LME) pricing for any given 

shipping period and smelter charges based on the industry annual negotiations between third 

party smelting and mining groups. 

 

RPA has reviewed the concentrate treatment charges, payable amounts, and commodity 

prices projected by Trevali.  The results support the assumptions used in this Technical Report:  

In summary, current concentrate treatment charges are lower (Teck and Korea Zinc recently 

settled at $147/t flat) and average LME spot commodity prices are higher those used in the 

report.

In 2016, Nantou Mining executed a Mining Services Contract with Byrnecut Burkina Faso 

SARL for a period of six years, in which Byrnecut provides all personnel and equipment in 

order to carry out mine services including all development and production.   

 

Nantou Mining has a contract with Damco Burkina Faso S.A. for the transport of zinc 

concentrates from the Perkoa mine to the port of Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and to provide backhaul 

services, as required.

20 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING, 
AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 
The Perkoa mine has a HSEC Policy (2014) outlining its commitment to the environment as 

well as procedures aligned to the requirements of applicable Burkina Faso legislation.  These 

commitments are then implemented and managed through a HSEC system, which is aligned 

to the principles of ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management System (EMS).  The current 

EMS is based on the overarching procedures of Glencore, however, Trevali is in the process 

of implementing its corporate EMS, and the EMS at Perkoa and the procedures will be updated 

and aligned with this corporate framework.   

 

Burkina Faso's legal system is based on civil law modelled predominantly on principals from 

the French legal system.  At the apex of the legal system, the Burkina Faso Constitution is the 

supreme law which was adopted by referendum of June 2, 1991 and revised three times by 

the Law No. 002/97/ADP of January 1997, the Law No. 003-2000/AN of April 11, 2000 and the 

Law No.001-2002/AN of January 22, 2002.  The Constitution provides that the riches and 

natural resources of the country belong to the people and must be used to improve their living 

conditions.  The Environmental Code (Law No 006 of 2013), containing five titles and 148 

articles, aims to protect human beings against harmful effects or nuisances and risks that 

hinder and jeopardize their existence due to environment degradation, and to improve their 

living conditions.   

 

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES 
The approved Environmental Management Plan (EMP) provides the framework for Perkoa 

mine's environmental management and outlines mitigation measures and monitoring 

programs, to reduce and manage negative impacts to the biophysical and social environment.  

Environmental audits must be carried out in accordance with Article 4 of Decree No. 2015-

10000 of October 28, 2015 laying down detailed rules for carrying out environmental audits.  

As per these requirements, regular monitoring and evaluation of environmental performance 

through compliance audits is undertaken by BUMIGEB.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 20-2 

A BUMIGEB audit inspection report of May 23, 2016 highlights the need for a water sampling 

and analysis program to be developed in terms of oxides in the ore, establishing an effective 

dust mitigation system, the implementation of measures to limit discharge from activities on 

site, design a suitable area for the storage of minerals on site to minimize soil, surface water 

and groundwater contamination, maintain the water balance on mine and to conduct a study 

to evaluate the Potential of Generation of Acid (PGA) at the open pit, tailings pond, and the 

scats stockpiles.  At the time of the writing of this report, a proposal from Knight Piesold dated 

July 28, 2017 and November 15, 2017 was reviewed which described the process to evaluate 

and provide the relevant reporting to address the above requirements.  This work will be 

undertaken during 2018 by the Perkoa mine.   

 

The Perkoa mine has areas of waste disposal including a TSF with additional extensions that 

were implemented in 2017, waste treatment facilities, and a scats stockpile and generates both 

general and hazardous waste.  The mine currently has a tailings pond licensed by the Ministry 

of Environment that comprises three areas.  At the present stage of development of mine 

activities, only the first and second cells were constructed.  A third cell is required as the first 

cell is full and will be managed under a closure and rehabilitation process and the second cell 

is almost at the maximum of its nominal design storage capacity.  The new cell will be fully 

located within the current operating licence and will be a lined facility.  The Government 

mandated Nantou Mining to undertake an acid rock drainage potential assessment during 

2017.  Internal tests have been conducted, however, the formal geochemical testing will take 

place using Knight Piesold during 2018.  The results of this study may have implications for 

the tailings pond expansion, and will need to be managed accordingly upon receipt of the 

results.  The impact of these results is currently unknown and cannot be used to validate the 

risk profile, however, as a mitigation measure the TSF expansions have been designed with 

the use of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) liners.  The results of the study may require 

additional environmental rehabilitation, monitoring, and implementation of management 

measures to ensure the effects are minimized or avoided, where possible.  The first cell of the 

TSF has since been decommissioned and is under technical review for closure and 

reclamation by Knight Piésold. 

 

A current focus is the Waste Management and storage of chemicals at the Perkoa mine.  An 

official inspection letter issued to site in May 2017 outlined several steps to implement 

regarding the disposal of expired chemicals and improvements to site chemical storage 

facilities.  These recommendations are currently being implemented.  Waste management was 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 20-3 

identified by site as a potential risk.  As such, a detailed waste action management plan was 

developed which details a remediation plan for the waste that is currently on site, followed by 

the planning of a formalized waste management facility. 

 

Runoff from the plant is directed via a series of canals.  The mine has commenced with the 

lining of these canals which will be completed during 2018.  The water from the canals is 

diverted to a stormwater reservoir and then transferred to treatment ponds.  Process water 

from the plant is treated and reused.  The water volumes required to operate the processing 

plant are pumped from the Seboun reservoir, with drinking water being sourced from an 

underground aquifer.  This water is treated to be potable and then transported via a distribution 

network to the treatment plant and other facilities as required.  As the mine is a net consumer 

of water, it is recommended that a water hierarchy of use be generated by implementing 

consumption monitoring, improving the water balance, discharge tracking, and improving the 

tailing deposition monitoring.  This would assist in utilizing water that can be reused in certain 

processes rather than sourcing from the reservoir.   

 

PROJECT PERMITTING 
As per the requirements of the Burkina Faso Legislative Framework, there was an 

Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) compiled and submitted in June 2006 in 

accordance with Article 17 of the Environmental Code (Law No. 005/97).  During 2010, the 

Perkoa mine underwent a review and the design of the mine was amended to include the 

addition of an open pit, an expansion of the plant, a waste incinerator, increased waste 

disposal area, and a stream diversion.  The ESIA for the changes to the mine plan was 

approved and an authorization issued on December 26, 2012 by the Minister of Environment 

and Sustainable Development in terms of the Environmental Code of Burkina Faso (Law No. 

006 of 2013).  An ESIA was also conducted by TEFA OMEGA SERVICES BUNEE-EIES for 

the changes to the tailings ponds.  Approval was granted on the ESIA on December 22, 2016 

(Reference TdR 20161222 (Environmental Code of Burkina Faso Law No. 006 of 2013).   

 

Closure and reclamation for the first cell of the tailings facility is currently not permitted.  The 

work is being undertaken by Knight Piésold to attain the permit and Nantou Mining is in 

discussions with the authorities regarding the legislative process.  This risk will require close 

management to ensure that the permitting is prioritized and continuous consultation with the 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 20-4 

authorities is undertaken to permit the closure and reclamation of the first cell of the tailings 

facility during 2018. 

 

SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY REQUIREMENTS 
The new Mining Code, which was passed by the Conseil National de Transition on June 26, 

2015, proposes the creation of a new fund called "Mining Fund for Local Development".  The 

holders of exploitation permits and authorizations for quarrying exploitation shall be subject to 

the payment of 1% of their turnover to the fund and the State shall pay 25% of the collected 

mining royalties to the new fund.  It is to be noted that the Perkoa mine was accruing for this 

levy although at the time, there was no requirement to pay this until the implementation 

measures and details for the management of this were released by the government.  The 

regulations have since been promulgated (January 2018) and the 1% will be paid to the 

government once the details of the fund are released to facilitate the payment of the funds.  

There is no mechanism in place for how the funds will be allocated and, if perceived by the 

local community to be distributed to unaffected areas, this may lead to community protests or 

strike.  

 

The Perkoa mine has a procedure in place for publicising recruitment, signed by Nantou Mining 

and the Youth Committee on June 12, 2015, to use only local unskilled labour and to favour 

local labour if qualification is required.  Stakeholder management is being successfully 

managed on site by the implementation of the tripartite committee.  The tripartite committee is 

comprised of representatives from Nantou Mining, the local community, and the government. 

 

In terms of corporate social responsibility, projects are consistent with those as required by the 

EMP.  These include the construction of a community centre, primary school, as well as social 

expenses, including cultural displacement, construction of replacement houses, Perkoa Health 

and Social Promotion Centre, community water boreholes, and a literacy program.  The Perkoa 

mine is evaluating further projects for 2018 that have a focus on increasing the number of 

women in mining and assisting in creating the opportunity for skills development in the local 

communities as identified by the Perkoa mine. 

 

The National HIV/AIDS infection rate for Burkina Faso is approximately 1.8%.  The mine is 

actively involved in the prevention of HIV/AIDS and was presented with an award from the 

Government for "Significant Contribution to Community HIV/AIDS Program".

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 20-5 

Of concern, is the threat of malaria to the employees and contractors working at the mine.  

Although strict controls are put in place by the Perkoa mine, there are a high number of malaria 

cases reported annually.  Training and Awareness programs will need to continue to be rolled 

out and extended beyond employees as infections may be occurring out of the mine workplace 

or camp site. 

 

The mine has a fleet of approximately 70 trucks per week that transport zinc concentrate to 

the port in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.  The trucks carry approximately 45,000 t of zinc concentrate 

over 3,861 trips per annum.  RPA notes that there is risk associated with an environmental 

incident associated with any accident/ and or road transport.  The load may be in international 

territories and international environmental legislation (penalties and fines) may be imposed.  

This is aligned with the requirements of the Environment Code of Burkina Faso (Law No. 006 

of 2013) Article 145: The management of environmental issues in cross-border nature is done 

in consultation with the State(s) concerned in compliance with international standards 

applicable. 

 

MINE CLOSURE REQUIREMENTS 
The Perkoa mine developed a Preliminary Reclamation and Closure Plan in 2005 as part of 

the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the application for the Mine Operations 

Licence.  The conceptual closure plan was revised in 2010 due to some changes to the mine 

and associated infrastructure.   

 

According to the ESIA of the Amendment to the Development Plan for the Perkoa mine, 

Burkina Faso (Aecom, 2012), the plan is structured in accordance with best practice and would 

satisfy requirements underlying laws relating to the rehabilitation and closure of mining in 

South Africa.  South African legislation requires that plans be based on the assessment of 

potential residual risks associated with exploitation and that the objectives of the process be 

specified in terms of post-closure land use.  The conceptual closure plan was developed in the 

context of the proposed post-closure use of land, namely subsistence agriculture, but also in 

the context of the mine's environmental policies and accounting policies, and the key 

environmental issues identified during the EIA process.   

 

As at September 2012, the total cost of rehabilitation and closure for the Perkoa mine 

amounted to US$7.0 million.  As detailed in the audit report of May 23, 2016, BUMIGEB 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 20-6 

requires the compilation and submission of a technical and financial evaluation closure report 

for approval in accordance with Article 12 of Decree No 2007-845 / PRES / PM / MCE / MEF 

of December 26, 2007 on the management of the Mining Environment Rehabilitation Fund.  

Rehabilitation and closure costs are required to be reviewed by the Perkoa mine to meet these 

requirements of BUMIGEB.  A proposal from Knight Piésold dated July 28, 2017 was reviewed 

during the writing of this report and it is recommended that the updated technical and financial 

evaluation closure report be conducted during 2018 and submitted to BUMIGEB. 

 

DISCUSSION 
Based on the site visit conducted from February 8 to 14, 2018 and March 15 to 18, 2018 at the 

Perkoa mine, the review of available reports and documents as well as discussions held with 

management, there are environmental regulatory processes that are in process with the 

authorities for which permits have currently not been issued.  With the current engagement 

with the regulatory authorities regarding the permitting status, the risk, if managed, is not 

deemed to have the potential to materially impact the extraction of Mineral Resources or 

Mineral Reserves.  There are, however, environmental and social and regulatory risks that 

need to be mitigated and managed, as detailed above and outlined below: 

 

• Malaria is a threat to the employees and contractors working at the mine.  Although 
strict controls are put in place by the mine, there are a high number of infections per 
year based on the location of the mine.  Training and Awareness programs will need 
to continue and possibly be extended beyond employees as infections may be 
occurring out of the mine workplace or camp site. 
 

• The permit for the closure and reclamation of cell one at the tailings facility is required 
to comply with the regulatory framework.  The risk is being managed by the onboarded 
contractor Knight Piésold and continuous engagement with the authorities by the 
Perkoa mine.   
 

• The update to the mine wide financial closure will need to be completed in 2018 to 
comply with the requirements from BUMIGEB. 
 

• Perkoa Mine has acted on the instruction from the Minister regarding the storage of 
obsolete and expired chemicals on site.  A detailed action plan has been drafted and 
implemented to manage the expired chemicals on site.  At the time of writing this report, 
all the expired Zinc Sulphate and Zinc Metabisulphate had been removed from the 
Perkoa mine by Saphyto for safe disposal, as regulated.  Facilities are required to be 
constructed in line with the regulatory requirements and the documentation has been 
submitted for regulatory approval.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 20-7 

• Waste management was identified as a potential risk to the Perkoa mine.  As such, a 
detailed waste action management plan was developed by the Perkoa mine and 
reviewed during the site visit.  The action plan details a remediation plan for the waste 
that is currently on site, followed by the planning of a formalized waste management 
facility on site. 
 

• The mandate from the government to conduct an acid rock drainage potential study at 
the mine will assist in understanding mitigation measures that need to be developed, 
managed, and monitored at the mine and will provide an accurate closure liability 
costing and rehabilitation plan for the mine.  
 

• There will need to be a stakeholder management plan that is developed to address the 
one percent levy that has been imposed from government.  Although the mine will 
possibly not be able to direct the spend of that levy, community perceptions regarding 
lack of local benefits and misappropriation of development funds could pose risk to the 
project, regardless of whether these perceptions are substantiated.

22 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
As part of the 2018 Budget process carried out in mid-2017, Nantou Mining has developed a 

LOM plan, which projects production to 2022, with a total of 3.33 Mt being mined at a grade of 

13.1% Zn.  A Cash Flow Projection has been generated from the current LOM production 

schedule and capital and operating cost estimates, and is summarized in Table 22-1.  The 

associated process recoveries, metal prices, operating costs, refining and transportation 

charges, royalties, and capital expenditures (sustaining) were also taken into account.  All 

costs are based on fourth quarter of 2017 estimates and presented in US dollars.  Metal prices, 

as provided by Trevali, are based on consensus, long term forecasts from banks, financial 

institutions, and other sources.  Some of the key parameters and assumptions for the after-tax 

cash flow are as follows: 

 
REVENUE (100% BASIS) 

• 1,900 tpd. 

• Head grade: 13.1% Zn. 

• Mill recovery averaging: 93.3%. 

• Metal price: based on consensus forecast per year, averaging $1.20 per pound zinc. 

• Smelting and transport costs totalling $0.38 per pound payable zinc. 

• NSR: $182 per tonne milled. 

 
COSTS (100% BASIS) 

• Mine life:  4.8 years. 

• Sustaining capital:  $24.5 million. 

• Average operating cost over the mine life: $103/t milled. 

• Closure costs:  $7.0 million. 

• Salvage costs: nil. 

• NSR Royalty:  $18.7 million. 

• Net cash cost (equivalent to C1 cost), including sustaining capital, of $0.87 per pound 
of payable zinc. 

• After-tax Net Present Value (NPV) at 8%: $188 million.

TAXATION AND ROYALTIES 
The fiscal regime that applies in Burkina Faso to the mining and metals industry consists of a 

combination of corporate income tax (BIC), value added tax (VAT), royalties and taxes on 

mining activities (e.g., flat fees and surface fees). 

 

The mining and metals industry in Burkina Faso is governed by the Burkina Faso General Tax 

Code, the Burkina Faso Mining Code (issued on May 8, 2003) and the UEMOA (West African 

Economic and Monetary Union) Mining Code (issued on December 23, 2003).  The fiscal 

regime consists of a combination of corporate income tax, royalties, and several flat fees. 

 

An annual tax rate of 27.5% is payable by resident companies, however, holders of exploitation 

permits are subject to a reduced rate of 17.5%. 

 

Mining companies are subject to three types of royalties and contributions: flat fees, surface 

fees, and tax on mining and quarry substances and products. 

 

A flat fee is payable on mining titles or the authorization for the sale of mine substances.  This 

fee is also payable on the renewal, extension, sale (marketing), transfer, and sublease of such 

instruments.  The fee payable is determined according to the nature of the mining title (such 

as prospecting, industrial operating, mining concession, semi-industrial operating, artisanal 

operating licence, or permit) held by the company.  The amount due varies between 

US$2,000/km2 and US$150,000/km2 per year. 

 

An annual surface tax is payable by mining companies that hold prospecting permits and 

mining concessions.  The rate varies, depending on the type of mining licence concerned, from 

US$5/km2 to US$40,000/km2, per year. 

 

Most mining substances extracted are subject to specific mining taxes when they are removed 

from stock, based on the product's market value.  Those taxes may be deducted in calculating 

taxable benefits.  The rate varies from 3% to 8% of the turnover depending on the substance 

(such as bauxite, gold, diamonds, precious gems, iron, or others of special interest).  Nantou 

Mining is subject to a 3% mining tax (royalty). 

 

Income tax losses may be carried forward for four years, while losses resulting from 

depreciation of assets can be carried forward indefinitely.  Nantou Mining has a substantial

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 22-4 

income tax loss carry-forward and is not subject to corporate income tax until the income tax 

loss carry-forward has been used. 

 

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS 
Considering the Project on a stand-alone basis, the undiscounted pre-tax cash flow totals $231 

million over the mine life. 

 

The after-tax NPV at an 8% discount rate is $188 million. 

 

SENSITIVITIES 
Project risks can be identified in both economic and non-economic terms.  Key economic risks 

were examined through analysis of cash flow sensitivities: 

• Head grade 

• Zinc recovery 

• Zinc price 

• Operating costs 

• Sustaining capital costs 

 

Pre-tax NPV at 8% discount sensitivities over the Cash Flow Projection have been calculated 

per Table 22-2.  The sensitivities are shown in Table 22-2 and Figure 22-1.  The Project return 

is most sensitive to the product of changes in the head grade and zinc price followed by 

changes in the operating costs, recovery, and capital costs.

25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
Based on a site visit, discussion with Nantou Mining personnel, and review of available 

documentation, RPA offers the follow interpretations and conclusions. 

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 
• The geology and mineralization is well understood by Nantou Mining geology 

personnel. 
 

• The drilling procedures employed by Nantou Mining conform to industry best practice 
and the resultant drilling pattern is sufficient to interpret the geometry and the 
boundaries of the mineralization with confidence.  All drilling sampling was carried out 
under the direct supervision of appropriately qualified geologists.  There are no drilling, 
sampling, or recovery factors that could materially impact the accuracy and reliability 
of the results. 
 

• Drilling, sampling, QA/QC, sample preparation, and analyses were appropriate for the 
style of mineralization and adequate for Mineral Resource estimation.   
 

• In 2017, the QA/QC results showed an improvement over the 2016 results, with a 
significant reduction in large variances for CRM and better performance of the new 
granodiorite core blank material.  Overall, the QA/QC program, as designed and 
implemented by Nantou Mining, is adequate, and the assay results within the database 
are suitable for use in a Mineral Resource estimate. 
 

• The assumptions, parameters, and methodology of the Mineral Resource estimation 
are appropriate for the style of mineralization.  
 

• The updated variography study provides better interpolation parameters and will result 
in more accurate Mineral Resource estimations, especially for the hanging wall lenses.  
 

• Mineral Resources were estimated consistent with CIM (2014) definitions. 
 

• Measured plus Indicated Mineral Resources total 4.85 Mt grading 13.73% Zn for a total 
of approximately 665,700 t of contained zinc. 
 

• Inferred Mineral Resources total 0.68 Mt grading 8.9% Zn for a total of approximately 
60,900 t of contained zinc. 

 

EXPLORATION 
• The areas covered by the exploration licences, as well as other areas along the Perkoa 

Mine Horizon, are very prospective for both base and precious metals. 
 

• Rapid progress has been made over the last year with respect to exploration activities 
at Perkoa.

 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 25-2 

• Over 40 prospective targets have been generated, in four main clusters, along the 
Perkoa Mine Horizon within the POA and Guido exploration permits. 

 

MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 
• The Mineral Reserve estimate has been prepared utilizing acceptable estimation 

methodologies and the classification of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves 
conform to CIM (2014) definitions and NI 43-101. 
 

• Mining and milling costs used for the Mineral Reserve NSR calculation have been 
extracted directly from the 0.67 Mt per annum mining cost estimation physicals 
prepared by Nantou Mining in mid-2017.  The values are based on the average 
operating costs from the first half of 2017. 
 

• In addition to site operating costs, the Mineral Reserve estimate takes into 
consideration metallurgical recoveries, concentrate grades, transportation costs, 
smelter treatment charges, and royalty in determining economic viability. 

 
• The NSR cut-off value used for Mineral Reserve estimation is reasonable. 

 
• Stope shapes have been designed manually using Surpac software.  The resultant 

shapes were evaluated against the geological resource model to report the tonnes and 
grade for each stope shape. 
 

• Stope modifying factors were applied, post-geological interrogation, to generate the 
final diluted and recovered Mineral Reserve.  
 

• The Proven and Probable Mineral Reserve totals 3.33 Mt at 13.06% Zn for a total of 
434,700 t of contained zinc. 

 

MINERAL PROCESSING 
• The process plant is a conventional sulphide flotation plant capable of processing 2,000 

tpd, currently operating at approximately 1,900 tpd, and includes crushing, screening, 
and grinding, followed by zinc flotation and filtering to produce a zinc concentrate. 
 

• Over the past five years of operation, the process plant has produced a zinc 
concentrate in the range of 50.6% to 53.0% from head grades ranging from 6.3% Zn 
to 15.2% Zn.  Recovery of zinc has been in the range of 89.3% to 96.7%.   
 

• In general, the Perkoa concentrate can be considered "clean", with mercury and iron 
being two elements incurring small penalties. 
 

• There are no other by-product credits.  
 

• Zinc concentrates are trucked 1,200 km to the port of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, COMMUNITY RISKS 
• There is no evidence of environmental risks that could materially impact Nantou 

Mining's ability to extract the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves at the Perkoa 
mine if managed.   
 

• The Perkoa mine has a HSEC Policy (2014) outlining its commitment to the 
environment as well as procedures aligned to the requirements of applicable Burkina 
Faso legislation.   
 

• The approved EMPs integral to the ESIA provide the framework for Perkoa mine's 
environmental management.

26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
RPA offers the following recommendations. 

 

GEOLOGY AND MINERAL RESOURCES 
• A comprehensive data process map should be undertaken, including logging and 

sampling inputs, database review, and mine to mill production reconciliation studies. 
 

• The Microsoft Access format diamond drill hole database should be modified so that 
only the Drill Hole Database Administrator has secured rights to revise or add data.  
RPA also recommends that the drill hole database include a field for QA/QC completed 
and a final Drill Hole Signoff by the Database Administrator. 
 

• Additional effort should be undertaken to monitor QA/QC inputs and results.  Also, the 
potential source of blank contamination must be investigated and remedied.  Although 
the granodiorite core has performed much better than the historical quartz vein blank 
material, some minor metal content is still being reported. 
 

• The composite length should be reviewed from the current 1.5 m to 2.0 m. 
 

• Grade capping should be applied to the raw assays prior to compositing as per industry 
best practices. 
 

• A reconciliation of the resource model versus the actual tonnage and grade, as 
determined by the process facility, should be included as a standard practice for the 
annual Mineral Resource estimation. 
 

• A study should be undertaken on the Crown Pillar to determine if the mineralization can 
be reported as part of the Mineral Resource estimate.  

 

EXPLORATION 
• In-mine drilling should continue to explore for economic downdip potential. 

 
• A comprehensive detailed review, compilation, and systematic exploration targeting 

plan is required prior to any future significant exploration expenditures. 
  

• The 2018 exploration budget of approximately $3.5 million, including exploration 
targeting, 20,000 m of diamond drilling, geochemistry, and geophysics, is well 
warranted. 

 

MINING AND MINERAL RESERVES 
• A review of the Mineral Reserves based on current zinc prices should be carried out. 

 



www.rpacan.com 
 

 
 Trevali Mining Corporation – Perkoa Mine, Project #2926 

Technical Report NI 43-101 – April 12, 2018 Page 26-2 

• The Mineral Reserve estimate should be updated once the additional drill hole 
information is available. 
 

• The possibility of recovering the crown pillar should be studied as it is a potential source 
of mill feed once the current reserves are mined out. 

 

MINERAL PROCESSING 
• Zinc recoveries (92% to 94%) and concentrate grades (52% to 53%) are reasonable, 

however, both of these may be improved to maintain the upper range of recoveries and 
concentrate grades with further metallurgical testing. 

 

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, COMMUNITY 
• Malaria is a threat to the employees and contractors working at the mine.  Although 

strict controls are put in place by the mine there are a high number of infections per 
year based on the location of the mine.  Training and Awareness programs will need 
to continue and possibly be extended beyond employees as infections may be 
occurring out of the mine workplace or camp site. 
 

• The permit for the closure and reclamation of cell one at the tailings facility is required 
to comply with the regulatory framework.  The risk is being managed by the onboarded 
contractor Knight Piésold and continuous engagement with the authorities by the 
Perkoa mine.   
 

• The update to the mine wide financial closure will need to be completed in 2018 to 
comply with the requirements from BUMIGEB. 
 

• The Perkoa mine is actioning a detailed plan to manage the expired chemicals on site.  
At the time of writing this report, all the expired Zinc Sulphate and Zinc Metabisulphate 
had been removed from the Perkoa mine by Saphyto for safe disposal, as regulated. 
 

• New facilities are to be constructed in line with regulatory requirements for the storage 
of chemicals on site.  The documentation has been submitted for regulatory approval.  
 

• Waste management was identified as a potential risk to the Perkoa mine.  As such, a 
detailed waste action management plan was developed by the Perkoa mine and 
reviewed during the site visit.  The action plan details a remediation plan for the waste 
that is currently on site, followed by the planning of a formalized waste management 
facility on site. 
 

• The mandate from the government to conduct an acid rock drainage potential study at 
the mine will assist in understanding mitigation measures that need to be developed, 
managed, and monitored in order to provide an accurate closure liability costing and 
rehabilitation plan for the mine.  
 

• There will need to be a stakeholder management plan that is developed to address the 
one percent levy that has been imposed from government.  Although the mine will 
possibly not be able to direct the spend of that levy, community perceptions regarding 
lack of local benefits and misappropriation of development funds could pose risk to the 
project, regardless of whether these perceptions are substantiated.
