BUCKREEF GOLD PROJECT 
IN 

TANZANIA 
BY 

VENMYN RAND (PTY) LIMITED 
 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (NI ITEM 3) 
 
 
Venmyn Rand (Pty) Limited (Venmyn) was requested by Tanzania Royalty Exploration Corporation (TRX), in 
February 2011, to prepare an independent Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical 
Report on its Buckreef Gold Mine Re-development Project (Buckreef Project) in Tanzania. This Technical 

-101 Technical Report on Tanzanian Royalty Exploration 

D962R). TRX is a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange and at that time, the Technical 
Report formed part of the documentation in support of the publication of a material change in the Mineral 
Resource statement for the Buckreef Project.  
 
TRX has requested that Venmyn prepared an Update Technical Report, the purpose of which will be to 
document the re-publication of the February 2011 Mineral Resource statement at a lower cut-off grade, 
which TRX considers, more accurately reflects the current and forecast dynamics of global gold market. The 
Update Technical Report (Venmyn D1030R) is identical in all respects to the original February 2011 
(Venmyn D962R) document, excepting for the changes to the Section 18 on the Mineral Resource 
estimation. The Update Technical Report (Venmyn D1030R) describes the technical parameters, exploration 
results and Mineral Resources of the gold deposit in a manner fully compliant with the requirements of the 
National Instrument 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  
 
TRX is a gold finance company focused on the development of production revenue from advanced-stage 
gold ex
business strategy is to enter partnerships with major exploration and mining companies and receive 
advanced royalty income prior to production, as well as throughout commercial production. In addition, TRE 
actively explores suitable gold projects that ultimately will be the object of third party royalty agreements. 
 
Property, Ownership and Location 

TRX is the holder of numerous gold mineral assets in the Tanzanian goldfields, two of which include the, 
Kigosi and Lunguya eluvial gold deposits. In December 2010, TRX signed a binding heads of agreement 
with the State Mining Corporation of Tanzania (Stamico). TRX will have the right to earn a 55% interest in the 
Buckreef Project, with Stamico holding the remaining 45%. A Definitive Joint Venture Agreement governing 
ownership and management of the Buckreef Project is expected to be signed in due course. The Technical 
Report will review and document the techno-economic parameters for the Buckreef Project only. 
 
The Buckreef Project is located in north central Tanzania immediately to the south of Lake Victoria, in the 
Mwanza Provincial District. The Buckreef Project is situated 110km southwest of Mwanza and is accessed 
by unpaved roads and an airstrip. The project comprises the dormant Buckreef Gold Mine and four prospects 
with known mineralisation namely, Buckreef, Buziba, Tembo and Bingwa.  
 
Geology and Mineralisation 

The Buckreef and Buziba gold deposits are classified as medium grade orogenic gold deposits hosted by 
mafic volcanic sequences of the eastwest trending Archaean Rwamagaza Greenstone Belt (RGB) within the 
Lake Victoria Goldfields (LVG) of the Tanzanian Craton. The Buckreef deposit is hosted by a steeply dipping, 
northeast-southwest trending brittle-ductile shear zone with an early phase of iron rich carbonate alteration, 
re-brecciation, felsite intrusion and a later phase of auriferous quartz veining.  
 
 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

ii 

 
The Buziba deposit is a more disseminated mineralising system developed in zones of eastwest trending 
cleavage development and porphyry dyke intrusion, within a sequence of pillow meta-basalts and minor 
ultramafic rocks. The gold at Buziba is associated with a series of variably deformed quartz-carbonate-
hematite-magnetite-pyrite veins displaying pervasive silicification and sericitisation.  
 
Exploration Concept 

The Buckreef Gold Mine was an underground mine operated by the Tanzanian State during the late 1980s.  
Apart from the state, several previous owners of the project undertook numerous exploration programmes 
including aeromagnetic, helicopter borne IP, ground magnetic and soil geochemistry surveys, as well as 
extensive Reverse Circulation (RC), Aircore (AC) and diamond drilling programmes.  
 
Iamgold Corporation (Iamgold), the most recent owner of the project, verified the historic drilling data, 
undertook additional exploration and defined JORC compliant Mineral Resources in 2006. In total, the 
exploration programme included approximately 30,000 soil samples, 202,000m of RC drilling, 124,000m of 
AC drilling and 28,000m of diamond core drilling. An unconfirmed estimate for the historic exploration 
expenditure is USD23m. (Iamgold 2009). 
 
Metallurgical testwork programs were undertaken on both the Buckreef and Buziba ores types. The testwork 
on Buckreef ore indicated that oxide and transitional ore types were amenable to treatment using typical 
carbon-in-leach (CIL) processing techniques and fresh ore may benefit from flotation and a finer grind with 
recoveries anticipated to be in the low 90%s. The testwork results for Buziba ore indicated that it is amenable 
to treatment using gravity and CIL processing techniques. Metallurgical recoveries for Buziba ore were 
anticipated to be in the low to mid 90%s. Heap leaching testwork indicated that, at a 25mm-50mm crushing 
size fraction in oxide ore, a 75% recovery could be anticipated, whilst transitional and fresh ore recoveries 
were lower, at 35% to 50%. 
 
Status of Exploration 

TRX has not undertaken exploration on the Buckreef Project to date as it only recently acquired the licences 
in December 2010. TRX plans to initiate a Pre-Feasibility Study as part of the process to fast track the 
project to production. 
 
Development and Operations 

The Buckreef Project is an exploration project and apart from historic mining on the Buckreef Project, no 
mining operations or development has been undertaken by TRX. 

Conclusions and Recommendations 

Hellman & Schofield (Pty) Ltd (Hellman and Schofield) was retained by TRX to undertake the Mineral 
Resource estimation for the Buckreef Project. The Mineral Resource estimates were based partially on a 
historic dataset that has been verified and deemed suitable for Mineral Resource estimation (Hellman and 
Schofield 2007), as well as Iamgold exploration data, which is similarly of a standard compliant with National 
Instrument and JORC reporting requirements. The Mineral Resources were estimated using Multiple 
Indicator Kriging (MIK) techniques in GS3 software produced by Hellman and Schofield. The model 
estimates resources into panels, which approximate the drillhole sample spacing throughout the majority of 
the study area. The Mineral Resource estimates within each panel were classified according to the 
distribution of sampling in the kriging neighbourhood and took into account the uncertainty in the estimates 
related to the proximity and distribution of the informing composites.  
 
The February 2011 National Instrument 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate for the Buckreef 
Project is summarised as follows and was published at a 1g/t Au cut-off grade and included only the 
mineralisation above the 1,100mRL level:-

Subsequent to February 2011, TRX decided to publish the Mineral Resource statement at a 0.5g/t Au cut-off 
grade, to reflect the current and forecast dynamics of global gold market. In addition, the mineralisation 
below the 1.100mRL at Buckreef Prospect was included in the estimate as TRX considers the mineralisation 
below this level to have reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The June 2011 Update 
National Instrument Compliant Mineral Resource Estimate for the Buckreef Project is as follows:-

The geological continuity and grade distribution of the Buckreef mineralisation is well constrained and the 
upside potential to define additional Mineral Resources in extensions of the known orebody has been 
confirmed through drilling. The Mineral Resource base has been re-published to reflect the implementation 
changes in the cut-off grades as the gold price improved and detailed infill drilling at the Buziba, Tembo and 
Bingwa Prospects will upgrade the classification of the Mineral Resources in those prospects.

iv 

The positive prospectivity of the Buckreef Project is such that advancement of the exploration programme to 
Scoping Study and Pre-feasibility Study (PFS) level is warranted. TRX plans to initiate a PFS within the near 
future and dependent upon the outcome of that study, anticipates the commencement of the fast-track ramp-
up to open pit mining in 30 months. 
 
The exploration potential of the RGB has not been fully realised and TRX is well positioned to benefit when 
the full extent of the prospectivity of the greenstone belt is determined. Furthermore, the Buckreef Project 
benefits particularly from being an open pittable gold deposit, which can be brought rapidly into production to 
benefit from the current favourable gold market conditions. The definite upside potential to define further 
Mineral Resources serves to provide focus for future exploration and expansion of the project.

1 INTRODUCTION (NI 4) 

Venmyn Rand (Pty) Limited (Venmyn) was requested by Tanzania Royalty Exploration Corporation (TRX) in 
February 2011, to prepare an independent Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Technical 
Report on its Buckreef Gold Mine Re-development Project (Buckreef Project) in Tanzania. This Technical 

-101 Technical Report on Tanzanian Royalty Exploration 
 

D962R). TRX is a publicly traded company on the Toronto Stock Exchange and at that time, the Technical 
Report formed part of the documentation in support of the publication of a material change in the Mineral 
Resource statement for the Buckreef Project.  
 
TRX has requested that Venmyn prepared an Update Technical Report, the purpose of which will be to 
document the re-estimation of the February 2011 Mineral Resource statement at a new cut-off grade, which 
TRX considers, more accurately reflects the current and forecast dynamics of global gold market. The 
Update Technical Report (Venmyn D1030R) is identical in all respects to the original February 2011 
(Venmyn D962R) document, excepting for the changes to the Section 18 on the Mineral Resource 
estimation. The Update Technical Report (Venmyn D1030R) describes the technical parameters, exploration 
results and Mineral Resources of the gold deposit in a manner fully compliant with the requirements of the 
National Instrument 43-101 Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Projects.  
 
TRX is a gold finance company focused on the development of production revenue from advanced-stage 
gold exploration projects in the Lake Victoria Goldfields (LVG) of Tanzania (Figure 1). The 
business strategy is to enter partnerships with major exploration and mining companies and receive 
advanced royalty income prior to production, as well as throughout commercial production. In addition, TRE 
actively explores suitable gold projects that ultimately will be the object of third party royalty agreements. 
 
TRX is the holder of numerous gold mineral assets in the Tanzanian goldfields, two of which include the, 
Kigosi and Lunguya eluvial gold deposits. In December 2010, TRX signed a binding heads of agreement 
with State Mining Corporation of Tanzania (Stamico). TRX will have the right to earn a 55% interest in the 
Buckreef Project, with Stamico holding the remaining 45%. A Definitive Joint Venture Agreement governing 
ownership and management of the Buckreef Project is expected to be signed in due course. The Technical 
Report will review and document the techno-economic parameters for the Buckreef Project only. 
 
The Technical Report has been prepared in compliance with and to the extent required by the National 
Instrument 43- CIM  Guideline for the Reporting of 

. 
These standards of disclosure are the minimum standard for -economic due diligence and 
embody current trends in technical and economic valuation of mineral properties.  
 

proprietary checklist ensures that an internationally acceptable process was completed for the 
reporting of the mineral assets. The designated NI 43-101 Item numbers are presented in the Section titles 
for ease of reference. 
 
1.1 Sources of Information and Reliance on Other Experts (NI 4 and NI 5) 

The Technical Report is based upon information supplied by TRX, as well as several studies 
conducted on behalf of previous owners by independent specialist consultants. Venmyn has reviewed 
the independent technical reports and is reasonably assured, having made due enquiry, that these 
reports are based on accepted international and South African industry practice and fairly represent 
the project. These expert opinions and conclusions are incorporated as part of this report with written 
permission from the independent consultants and are summarised in Table 1, referenced in the text 
and included in Section 21.

The Technical Report is based upon the following information supplied from TRX to Venmyn:- 

 historic exploration information from previous holders of the exploration rights, Iamgold 
Corporation (Iamgold), which surrendered the rights and exploration information to the 
Tanzanian government in 2009. The historic information is in the possession of TRX by 
virtue of Joint Venture with Stamico; 

 in-house exploration results from surveys undertaken by Iamgold in the course of their 
tenure;  

 

 technical reviews undertaken by independent consultants, commissioned by and on 
behalf of Iamgold. The historic Mineral Resource estimates have been reviewed at a 
high level but not independently due diligenced in detail by Venmyn; and 

 Venmyn has reviewed the Mining Licence and Prospecting Licences. Venmyn has not 
independently verified the legal status of the licences nor is it qualified to do so and, 
whilst this does not constitute a legal opinion, the authors have satisfied themselves 
that the information presented herein is materially correct.  

TRX has warranted in writing that it has openly provided all material information to Venmyn, which, to 
the best of its knowledge and understanding, is complete, accurate and true.

3 LOCALITY, INFRASTRUCTURE AND COUNTRY PROFILE OF TANZANIA (NI 20) 

3.1 Tanzania Locality, Country Profile and General Infrastructure 

Tanzania is located in east Africa on the Indian Ocean coast and is bordered by Kenya, Uganda, 
Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique (Figure 1). Tanzanian governance includes the 
islands of Matia, Pemba and Zanzibar. The administrative capital, Dodoma is located near the centre 
of the country and Dar es Salaam, the financial and economic centre, is located on the coast. The 
areal extent of the country is 945,040km2 and the total population is approximately 43.7million. The 
country profile of Tanzania is summarised in Table 3. 
 
The country is sub-divided into 26 administrative regions, of which 21 are in the mainland and 5 in 
Zanzibar. Tanzania is mountainous in the northeast and the highland includes , 
Mt Kilimanjaro. To the north and west are the navigable lakes, Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika. 
Central Tanzania comprises a large plateau, with plains and arable land.  
 
Infrastructure and accessibility in Tanzania is operational and there is an international airport at Dar es 
Salaam and numerous other manned and unmanned airstrips at regional centres throughout the 
country. Domestic air transport is reasonable, and connects all the major regional centres within the 
country.

National roads are generally in good repair, facilitated by a Road Fund and Road Agency structure 
and fuel levy. Secondary and dirt roads are in various states of repair and passable by 4x4 vehicles,  
 
The port of Dar es Salaam is a significant regional port in East Africa, however it often represents a 
bottleneck for both imports and exports. Privatisation of certain sectors of the port in recent years has 
assisted in improving the efficiency of the port, However, the significant growth in shipping traffic 
continues to exceed the capacity of the port.  
 
Power supply in Tanzania is characterised by very low consumption, low coverage and poor reliability, 
with frequent outages, even in major centres. Significant investment in the power generation capacity 
of Tanzania is required to mitigate these issues. Water supply is poor and access to clean and safe 
water is limited.  
 
The telecommunications network is based on microwave radio relay stations and is available in all 
major towns. This network is supplemented by a mobile cellular system, operated by a number of 
different private service providers and is available throughout most of the country.

Following World War I, the League of Nations decreed that the former German colony of Tanganyika 
be placed under British administration. Tanganyika gained independence from Britain in 1961, and 
briefly adopted a British parliamentary form of government, which was succeeded in 1962, by a 
presidential form of government headed by Julius Nyerere. The Interim Constitution of the United 
Republic of Tanzania was adopted and a union negotiated between the former Tanganyika colony and 

ro Shirazi Party to 
form a new party called the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM).  
 
The adoption of a permanent constitution, with the provision that allowed Zanzibar to elect 
representatives to the National Assembly, further strengthened these ties. 
 
Ndugu Ali Hassan Mwinyi was elected president in 1985 and began a process of political and 
economic reform of the socialist economic policies of President Nyerere. In 1992, the constitution was 
amended and a multi-party system was introduced.  
 
Benjamin William Mkapa was elected president in 1995 and continued with these reforms and 
presided over a relatively stable political environment. He promoted a culture of human rights, non-
racial policies, freedom of speech, and is recognised as the driving force behind 
liberalisation. Mkapa was re-elected in 2000. In 2005, Jakaya Kikwete of the ruling party won the 
presidential elections by a landslide (over 80%) margin, and undertook to continue the economic 
reforms set in motion by Mkapa. In 2010 he was re-elected as president for his second term, by 
another overwhelming vote. Elections and transitions have continued to progress peacefully. 
 

3.2 Economic Climate and Fiscal Regime 

Despite the recent economic reforms, Tanzania remains one of the poorest economies in the world, 
depending largely on agriculture (±40% of GDP), which accounts for 85% of all exports and employs 
80% of the work force. Tanzania is still dependent on multilateral and bilateral aid, in order to support 
infrastructural development and to alleviate poverty. It is a member of the East African Community and 
this assists in regional trade ties.  
 
The GDP in 2010 is quoted as approximately USD22.4bn (Table 3), with the real growth rate of the 
economy in excess of 5% for the past 5 years. Inflation during 2010 has averaged approximately 7%, 
with public debt in excess of approximately 40% and a deficit of appro P 
purchasing power parity (PPP) is estimated as USD61.9bn for 2010. 
 

3.3 Exploration and Mining in Tanzania 

Tanzanian has currently one of the highest levels of exploration in Africa due to its overall 
prospectivity, political stability and investor friendly policies. Gold was mined in Tanzania long before 
the arrival of the Europeans and the early 1990s marked the rapid increase in exploration by 
international companies, searching for gold deposits within the granite-greenstone belts of the Lake 
Victoria Goldfield (LVG). The success of this exploration has led to the opening of numerous large 
gold mines in the area producing an average of in excess of 40,000kg of gold a year for the past 5 
years, with a peak of in excess of 52,000kg in 2005. Production decreased in 2008 as a consequence 
of the global economic crisis, but exploration has been ongoing, albeit at a slower pace, and new 
discoveries continue to occur. 
 
The LVG is characterised by gold mineralisation associated with iron formations, tuffs, and volcano-
sedimentary exhalatives. Notable developments in the past 10 years include the commissioning of 
large scale mines at Geita, Bulyanhulu, Nzega, North Mara, Buhemba and Tuluwaka. Gold has also 
been discovered and mined, to a far lesser extent, in the southern and south-western parts of the 
country. 
 
In addition to gold, the following commodities are mined and actively explored for within Tanzania:- 

 base metals, in a belt running from Kagema, through Kigoma, to the Mbeya, Ruvuma 
and Mtwara regions and in northwest Tanzania; and 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

7 

 gemstones in eastern and western belts running from the Kenyan border in the north to 
Mozambique in the south. Tanzania is particularly well known for its diamonds 
(specifically from the Mwadui Mine) and Tanzanite (blue zoisite). 

 
3.4 Tanzanian Mining Law and Royalties and Taxes 

In April 2010, a revised Mining Act was passed by Parliament, which incorporated higher royalties at 
4% for precious and base metals, 6% for diamonds and gemstones, and 7% for uranium, as well as, 
requiring mining companies to list on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange.  
 
 
 
The 2010 Mining Act gives the State  in mining projects, the level of which is 
negotiated between the government and the mineral rights holder depending on the type of mineral 
and the level of investment.  
 
The State ownership of future mining projects in Tanzania will be based on the level of investment in 
each individual joint venture. The new act prescribes that mineral rights and licenses for dealing in 
minerals will be reserved exclusively to Tanzanian citizens and corporate bodies under the exclusive 
control of Tanzanian citizens. Furthermore, licences to mine for gemstones are only to be granted to 
Tanzanians, regardless of the size of the operation. It is understood that agreements/licences 
currently in force with non-Tanzanian controlled mining companies remain unchanged. 
 
Salient features of the 2010 Mining Act are as follows:-  

 the right to trade in mineral rights;  

 simplification and consolidation of past statutes on mining and mineral trading; and 

 improved security of tenure through removal of most past ministerial discretionary 
powers and introduction of a mining advisory committee responsible for advising the 
Minister on decisions to ensure enhanced clarity and transparency; fair, streamlined and 
non-discriminatory licensing procedures; and environmental management.  

The Mining Act aims to deter information hoarding of new discoveries, the freezing of exploration 
acreage for speculative purposes and transfer pricing and tax evasion. The fiscal incentives provided 
to exploration and mining activities include the following:-  

 exemption of import duty and Value Added Tax (VAT) on equipment and essential 
materials up to the anniversary of start of production, thereafter 5% seal applies;  

 depreciation allowances of 100%; and 

 repatriation of capital and profit directly related to mining.  

 
Under the Mining Act, Tanzania issues four basic categories of licences:- 

 Reconnaissance Licence, granted for one year and renewed for one year. A work 
programme must be submitted by the applicants and bi-annual reports are required for 
submission. On expiry, all data, maps and reports are to be surrendered to the 
Government. The licence holder may then apply for a Prospecting Licence; 

 Prospecting Licence, granted for an initial period of three years and for two successive 
periods of renewal, neither of which can exceed two years and both of which require a 
50% reduction in land area. The portion returned to the State can be re-applied for as a 
new application under a different company name. Currently, a subsidiary company 
under the same parent umbrella may apply for the new application; 

 Retention Licence, granted to the holder of a Prospecting Licence on which mineral 
deposits of commercial significance have been discovered but which cannot be 
exploited or developed immediately. These licences are granted for a maximum of five 
years; and 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

8 

 Mining Licence, granted to the holder of a Prospecting Licence over the area and gives 
the holder the exclusive right to prospect and mine minerals. These are valid for 25 
years (or the life of mine), with an option to renew for a further 25 years.  

The State reserves its rights to revoke any Reconnaissance, Prospecting, Retention and/or Mining 
rights in terms of the Tanzanian Mining Act. In terms of security of tenure, there are recorded cases of 
companies with renewal applications in process, having new Prospecting Licences granted over their 
previously held right.  
 
If licences fall within a Forest Reserve and Game Controlled Area, additional authorisation must be 
sought from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT).  
 
With respect to TRX
normal exploration expenditures will be subjected to tax regulations as set out by the Tanzania 
Revenue Authority (TRA).  
 
In terms of the 2010 Mining Act, royalty will be computed on a gross value basis, as opposed to the 
net profit value in the previous act. Production from future TRX mining operations will be subject to a 
4% royalty (2010 Mining Act Part VI 87). 

4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION (NI 6) 
The Buckreef Project is an advanced gold exploration project, which comprises numerous Prospecting 
Licences and a single Mining Licence, in extent, located approximately 100km southwest of the regional city 
of Mwanza, in Geita District of northern Tanzania (Figure 1

E and includes the historic, dormant Buckreef Mine located within the western portion of the project 
and 4 gold prospects at; Buckreef, Tembo, Bingwa, and Buziba (Figure 2). 
 
4.1  

Originally, the Buckreef Project was an advanced exploration project held by Iamgold Tanzania (IAGT) 
prior to July 2009. The Agreement to Redevelop the Buckreef Gold Mine (ARBGM) Iamgold 
and the Ministry for Energy and Minerals included at that point, a single Mining Licence and 12 
Prospecting Licences covering 98.19km2.  
 
In July 2010, IAGT applied to surrender all licenses relating to the ARBGM, effective 25th October 
2009, and the Commissioner for Minerals withdraw all license applications relating to the ARBGM. 
 
In 2010, TRX was invited by State Mining Corporation of Tanzania, Stamico (for the Ministry of Energy 
and Minerals), to tender for the opportunity to negotiate a Joint Venture agreement with respect to the 
Buckreef Project. TRX was awarded the tender, as confirmed in a letter from the Director General of 
Stamico dated 16th December 2010. In December 2010, TRX signed a binding heads of agreement 
with Stamico in terms of which, TRX will have the right to earn a 55% interest in the Buckreef Project, 
with Stamico holding the remaining 45%. A Definitive Joint Venture Agreement governing ownership 
and management of the Buckreef Project is expected to be signed in due course.  
 
The Prospecting Licences and Mining Licence awarded to TRX as part of the Joint Venture are 
summarised in Table 4 and illustrated in Figure 2. In addition, within these tenements are small scale 
artisanal gold operations, which comprise 53 Primary Mining Licences (PML) or , held mostly 
by local parties (Figure 2). 

 
The Buckreef Project comprises a hilly area over which the surface and mineral rights are vested in 
the State. No surface rights agreements are currently in place and there are no obligations on TRX 
with respect to surface rights agreements. The Tanzanian Mining Act requires consultation with 
landowners for access and a written authorisation is required for access and construction (2010 Act, 
Part VII 95 and 96). Appropriate compensation for any damages incurred during the exploration 
process or relocation, is negotiated with Local Government Authorities and Village Council (Mining Act 
Part VIII 102). All disputes are settled by the Commissioner. 
 
The property boundary beacons have been surveyed and the location of all known mineralisation, the 
existing processing Figure 3 and Figure 2.

4.1.1 Material Agreements 

The Tanzanian Mining Act makes provision for a Development Agreement between the 
Department of Energy and Minerals and mineral rights owners, the terms of which are valid 
for the Life of the Mine (LoM) and are constrained by the provisions of the Mining Act 2010.  
 
A binding heads of agreement between Stamico and TRX has granted TRX the right to earn 
a 55% interest in the Buckreef Project, with Stamico holding the balance. A Definitive Joint 
Venture Agreement governing ownership and management of the Buck Reef properties is 
expected to be signed in due course. The continued right to the Prospecting and Mining 
Licences will be subject to the conditions to be negotiated in the Joint Venture Agreement.

4.1.2 Environmental Consideration 

A considerable quantity of environmental study has been completed to date for the Buckreef 
Project but no formal no Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) has been published. On the 
completion of the geo-hydrological study, the EIA will finalised. TRX is not aware of any 
potential inherited environmental liability. The artisanal workings 
extensive and the extent of environmental impact will have to be conducted in future 
baseline studies. 
 

4.1.3 Royalties, Fees and Taxes 

Discussed in detail in Section 3.4. 
 

4.1.4 Claims, Servitudes Permits and Licences 

TRX is unaware of any servitude that requires its negotiation with any surface rights owners. 
There are no disputes with adjacent properties that could affect TRX s right to prospect. 
 
TRX is in possession all necessary permits to conduct the exploration planned for the 
Buckreef exploration project. 
 

4.1.5 Existing Mining Infrastructure 

The original Buckreef Mine comprises the shaft headframe and plant but in both cases lack 
of care and maintenance has resulted in the infrastructure now being defunct. A small 
tailings disposal facility is preserved, as well as the original mine and office buildings, and 
airstrip as indicated in Figure 3. The permanent accommodation/mess facilities are being 
utilized by Iamgold Exploration. At Buziba, a well established exploration camp exists at the 
western end of the project with an electrical power generator unit and borehole water supply.

5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES AND PHYSIOGRAPHY (NI 7) 
5.1 Locality, Population, Access and Local Resources 

The Buckreef Project is situated in the Geita district, approximately 110km southwest of Mwanza, in 
the Lake Victoria region of Tanzania (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The hinterland northwest of Dar es 
Salaam is connected by a poorly maintained bitumen road, unreliable train service and several daily 
commercial flights. Mwanza is the nearest major population centre to the project, approximately 60km 
northeast of Buckreef, and is the second largest city in Tanzania with a population of 1million people. 
 
Access to the project area is via ferry from Mwanza across Smiths Sound, then via sealed road 
through the township of Geita. Alternative access is via sealed road through Shinyanga and Kahama, 
and subsequently via gravel road north to Bulyanhulu and then west to Nyarugusu.  
 
The project can also be accessed by scheduled light aircraft flights (Coastal Air Services) from 
Mwanza to the airstrips located at Bulyanhulu or Geita Gold Mines, or more directly by charter to the 
bush airstrips located at Buckreef Mine or Nyarugusu Village. 
 
Access to Buziba, is on the the Nyarugusu track turning south at the Main Reef Mine junction to 
Nyarugusu Village, which is located 25km east of Buckreef Mine (Figure 2). 
 
The infrastructure at the Buckreef project area is generally poor and unpaved roads are poorly 
maintained rendering access during the rainy season difficult. The project area is densely populated 
with individual kraals and agglomerations of dwellings related to transient artisanal gold mining 
activities. 
 
Exploration logistics, supplies and labour are largely provided from Mwanza and where possible, 
sourced locally from the villages of Rwamgasa and Nyarugusu and Geita township. Local small 
pastoral villages are poor sources of logistical support and communication in the area is provided by a 
modern cell phone network, which has coverage in virtually all sectors of the LVG. 
 
The surface rights are sufficient for future mining operations, processing plant, waste sites and TSF 
sites. Power and water availability are adequate for current requirements and will be upgradable to 
meet future mining requirements. In December 2007, Lorax Environmental was requested to conduct 
a study to identify suitable dam sites for a dam dedicated to supply water to the proposed Buckreef 
Mine site. In total 11 sites were identified and will be further investigated as the project progresses to 
Pre-feasibility study stage. 
 

5.2 Climate, Vegetation and Physiography 

The Buckreef Project area consists of gently rolling low hills at an average elevation of 1,210m to 
1,250mamsl, with flat alluvium deposits and black cotton (Mbuga) soil filled valleys. The original 
vegetation has been modified by subsistence farming and tree clearing (mainly for charcoal), to mixed 
crops and open grassland. Certain areas have been damaged by overgrazing. 
 
The climate is temperate, with sub-humid moderate temperatures all year round. There are two rainy 
seasons, the minor wet season occurs in November whilst the main wet season peaks in April. The 
water table varies markedly from season to season which can have an effect on drilling conditions. 
Consequently the dry season, occurring between May and September is preferable for drill programs 
and field operations. During the wet seasons access is limited across Mbuga soils. 

6 HISTORY (NI 8) 
The LVG was discovered in 1894 by German explorers and significant exploitation began in the 1930s at the 
Geita Gold Mine. Several small gold mines exploiting near surface reefs, operated throughout the 
Rwamagaza Greenstone Belt (RGB Figure 4), particularly near the village of Rwamagaza. By 1940, 
Tanzania was producing 4.5tpa of gold (Au).  
 
Gold bearing quartz veins were reported from the current Buckreef Mine area in 1945 and reports from the 
1950s attest to ongoing production at a number of localities near Rwamagaza, including the Buckreef area. 
The extent of the small scale local and colonial mining activities is evident from the numerous pits and adits 
covering the entire Buckreef tenement, however no production figures are available.

An airborne geophysical survey was flown during 1959 over the RGB, in a joint effort between the United 
Nations and the Tanzanian Mineral Resources Division, with a ground magnetic survey follow-up between 
1965 to 1968. The Buckreef quartz vein hosted deposit was rediscovered in 1965 and followed-up by drilling 
by the Tanzanian Mineral Resources Division. 
 
The Buckreef Mine was an underground mine exploited in the name of the Buckreef Gold Mining Company 
approved by the Tanzanian State Mining Company (Stamico) in 1972 and the exploration and mining 
activities during this period are summarised in Table 5. The mining ceased in 1990 due to a number of 
operational reasons and the mine flooded. Approximately 100,000t of Run of Mine (RoM) ore was mined at a 
diluted grade of approximately 3g/t Au to 4g/t Au. In 1994, the Buckreef Redevelopment Agreement was 
signed between the State of Tanzania and East Africa Mines Limited (EAM) and additional surface and 
subsurface gold resources were identified. 
 
Post 1990, a new phase of modern exploration focused on potential Archaean deposits in the Lake Victoria 
region and the LVG developed after significant gold discoveries (Figure 2). 
 
EAM explored 40km of contiguous strike length of the RGB. During that time (2003) Spinifex Gold, the 
original parent company to East Africa Mines, merged with Gallery Gold Limited of Australia. Gallery then 
became the parent company of East Africa Mines. Iamgold Corporation acquired Gallery Gold in March 2006 
and held the Buckreef project until July 2009.

6.1 Historical Mineral Resource Estimates 

Numerous historic Mineral Resource estimates have been made for the Buckreef Project from 1995 
through to the Mineral Resource estimate published by Hellman  

 
 
The 2006 JORC compliant Mineral Resources were estimated using Multiple Indicator Kriging (MIK) 
on historical drilling data with GS3 software produced by Hellman and Schofield. The geological 
wireframe models included mineralised envelopes, major rock type boundaries, oxidation surfaces and 
topography. Interpreted mineralised domains, that were identified at approximately 0.3g/t Au minimum 
included grade and interpreted as cross-section outlines shaped to drill hole traces in 3D. Variogram 
analysis of the spatial continuity of gold grades within the Main and North Lodes at Buckreef indicated 
a relatively weak long-range continuity in the horizontal plane parallel to local structural trends in the 
mineralisation and in cross section. This weak long range continuity is steeply dipping to the west.

Primary Mineral Resource panel dimensions of 10mE x 20mN x 5mRL were used by Hellman and 
Schofield. The large size of the model panels leads to more robust resource estimates, which more 
closely resemble the resources achieved during mining. The resource estimates within each panel 
were classified according to the distribution of sampling in the kriging neighbourhood. This 
classification scheme took into account the uncertainty in the estimates related to the proximity and 
distribution of the informing composites.

7 REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING (NI 9) 
The Buckreef Project is situated within the LVG of northern Tanzania, which consists of a number of 
eastwest trending, linear, Archaean greenstone belts (Figure 4), which are separate granite-gneiss terrains 
within the Tanzanian Craton of east Africa. The LVG is the third largest gold producing region of Africa, 
surpassed only by the Witwatersrand Basin in South Africa and the Tarkwa region of Ghana. Numerous gold 
occurrences have been identified in the LVG, and new discoveries continue to be made. Since 1998, when 
the first mine, Golden Pride was commissioned, four additional large scale mines namely, Geita, Bulyanhulu, 
North Mara, and Tuluwaka have come into production. Geita and Bulyhanulu are considered world-class 
deposits, together representing in excess of 35Moz of gold resources.  
 
The greenstone belts comprise mafic volcanics, pyritic sediments, tuffs, iron formation, chert, and felsic 
volcanics, collectively known as the Nyanzian Group. The metamorphic grade of the Nyanzian Group is 
lower to middle greenschist facies, and two major deformational episodes have been identified. Amphibolite 
facies metamorphic rocks are exposed in the western portions of the belt near Tulawaka Mine, but in general 
higher grade metamorphic complexes are rare. 
 
The greenstone belt sequences have geological and structural similarities to major gold districts in the 
Canadian Shield (Val d´Or, Kirkland Lake) and the Yilgarn Craton in Western Australia (Kalgoorlie, Laverton, 
Leonora, Kambalda and Southern Cross). 
 
Gold mineralisation within the LVG occurs in a number of styles including:- 

 quartz veins within minor brittle lineaments, most commonly worked on a small scale by 
artisanal workers, due to their limited extent and erratic gold distribution; 

 mineralisation within major ductile shear zones; 

 mineralisation associated with replacement of iron formation and ferruginous sediments; and 

 felsic (porphyry) hosted mineralisation, such as within the Rwamagaza Greenstone Belt. 

Regardless of the geological environment, it is accepted that structural control on the emplacement of the 
mineralisation is critical. The following structural features have proven to be important foci of gold 
mineralisation:- 

 structural lineaments trending at 120º; 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

16 

 flexures and splays to the 120º trend (such as at Golden Pride); 

 structural lineaments at 70º (such as at Golden Ridge); and 

 granite-greenstone contacts (such as at the Ushirombo and Rwamagaza Greenstone belts). 

 
7.1 Local Geological Setting (NI 9) 

The Buckreef Project area covers the eastern portion of the eastwest trending Rwamagaza 
Greenstone Belt (RGB) (Figure 4), which forms part of the Sukumaland Greenstone Belt.  
 
 
The Sukumaland Greenstone Belt is oval shaped and is defined by two intermittently exposed belts of 
meta-volcanic and meta-sedimentary rocks that surround a core of granitoids and gneisses (Figure 5). 
The inner belt comprises an older, Lower Nyanzian sequence characterised by basaltic and andesitic 
lavas and tuffs, whilst the outer, younger, Upper Nyanzian succession consists of iron formation and 
tuffs. The understanding of the geology in the region has been hampered by the lack of outcrop (less 
than 2%). Isotopic dating suggests that the sequences are approximately 2.6Ga in age and although 
no contact between the outer and inner belts is exposed, a general trend of younging outwards is 
considered valid (Figure 5). 
 
Within the Sukumaland Greenstone Belt, the RGB consists of a sequence of poorly outcropping 
basaltic flows with well preserved volcanic features such as varioles, pillows, and flow top breccias. 
The mafic sequences consist of komatiitic basalts to the south and tholeitic basalts in the north, 
separated by the Rwamagaza Shear Zone. Aeromagnetic data and minor outcrop, indicate the 
presence of a number of elongate discontinuous, serpentinised, sheared ultramafic bodies parallel to 
the flow stratigraphy, which could represent either intrusive bodies or the cumulate portions of thick, 
magnesium rich basaltic lava flows. 
 
Large batholithic granites intrude the RGB and the possibility exists that the RGB forms part of a much 
larger belt that has been dissected by the intrusions. Aeromagnetic surveys over Buckreef indicate the 
presence of granites at depth (Figure 6). 
 
The mafic-ultramafic sequence is strained to varying degrees, with the highest strain occurring in the 
central area of the tenements, where the belt is thinnest. In this area, the dominant rock type is mafic 
schist. Toward the thicker (less attenuated) eastern and western parts, the schists forms thinner more 
discrete zones of high strain separating areas of relatively unstrained ultramafic lithologies. The 
granitoids are generally unstrained and hence assumed to be post peak deformation. A large portion 
of the basalts to the southeast of Nyarugusu are hornfelsed, suggesting the presence of granite at 
shallow depths beneath them. 
 
The tectonic evolution of the RGB is very poorly understood. Aeromagnetic data reveals several 
generations of crosscutting, late stage, brittle-ductile faults and shears, which offset flow stratigraphy 
and have locally been intruded by the felsic porphyries and by a late stage dolerite dykes. Early 
formed ductile structures are not easily defined in aeromagnetic data and there is evidence of shear 
zones that parallel the stratigraphy. 
 
The RGB has been subjected to a phase of laterite development, with formation of predominantly iron 
rich ferricrete caps, which were subsequently extensively eroded and only isolated remnants of laterite 
remain in situ. Furthermore, these remnants are largely re-cemented transported laterites. As a 
consequence of this period of erosion, the weathering profile across the belt is relatively shallow 
across both Buckreef and Buziba Prospects. Major zones of secondary enrichment are therefore not 
developed at either Buckreef or Buziba, but there is evidence of localised enrichment in the shallow 
oxidation profiles in both areas. The RGB in general is covered by a thin layer of elluvial regolith, 
which is amenable to standard soil sampling techniques. 
 
The prospect host rocks comprise meta-basalt, which are generally un-deformed but metamorphosed 
to lower greenschist facies grades. At Buckreef interflow units of predominantly pelitic and cherty 
sediments occur, as well as a variety of porphyritic textured, dyke and vein like felsic intrusions along 
crosscutting structures or sub-parallel to flow stratigraphy.

18 

 
A non-penetrative deformation fabric is developed at Buziba, which dips steeply to the south, sub-
parallel to the stratigraphy. Individual zones in which this fabric is well developed cannot be traced for 
distances of more than a few hundred metres on drill sections but a number of such zones occur 
throughout the 200m of thickness of stratigraphy, which hosts the mineralisation.  
 

8 DEPOSIT TYPE (NI 10) 
The 

-thermal gold deposits, shear-hosted, lode-gold and 
metamorphic gold deposits.  
 
Typically, orogenic gold deposits are formed in regionally metamorphosed terranes, during compressional or 
transpressional tectonic processes at continental plates margins, in accretionary or collisional orogenic 
events. In both tectonic regimes, hydrated marine sedimentary sequences are added to continental margins. 
Subduction related thermal events then drive extensive hydrothermal fluid systems through the hydrated 
accretionary sequences, which results in the emplacement of gold bearing quartz veins from depths of 
15km-20km to surface (Groves 1997). The mineralisation is commonly post the derformation of the host rock 
but is syn-orogenic with respect to the on-going deep crustal, subduction related thermal processes (Groves 
1997). In addition, mineralisation has been theorised to be associated with short-lived pulses of metamorphic 
fluids that are released by the rapid devolatilisation of a rock column undergoing burial in a convergent 
orogen. 
 
The LVG deposits are hosted by sedimentary units intercalated with volcanics and all are associated with 
quartz veining. The largest deposit at Geita is hosted by ferruginous chert-pelite units. 
 
The RGB hosts numerous small scale gold deposits exploited by small scale miners, as well as the 
Tulawaka Mine (0.4 Moz) at the western limit of the RGB, 56km to the west of the Buckreef Mine (Figure 2). 
All the deposits currently being exploited by artisanal miners in the Buckreef Project area consist of narrow 
discontinuous quartz veins within meta-basalts. 

9 MINERALISATION (NI 11) 
The Buckreef Project consists of four prospects namely, the dormant historic Buckreef Gold Mine at the 
western limit of the project area, the Tembo and Bingwa prospects and the Buziba prospect 20km to the east 
as shown in Figure 2. 
 
The Buckreef Prospect 

The Buckreef Prospect is a shear zone hosted gold deposit hosted by mafic basalts and dolerites (referred to 
locally as a lode), in close proximity to a basement granite. The Buckreef Mine is located on a clearly 
defined, east-northeast/west-southwest trending, 5m-30m wide and 8km long, brittle-ductile shear zone 
within relatively undeformed mafic volcanics. Gold mineralisation is controlled within the regional shear by a 
fault zone with a 10m true width, continuous for over 1.5km strike length, is associated with intense 
brecciation and quartz, carbonate, sericite pyrite alteration.  
 
The mineralisation on the main fault zone can be divided into three domains (Main Zone, West Zone and 
Buckreef north Zone) separated by altered but less well mineralised material as summarised below:- 

 Main Zone has a strike length of 600m, dips steeply to the west and is extends to at least 
400m below surface; and 

 Buckreef North Zone has a strike length of 250m, also dips steeply to the west and has been 
intercepted in drilling 400m below surface. 

The two predominant zones of mineralisation at Buckreef namely, Buckreef Main and Buckreef North Zones, 
are distinguished by the orientation of the main hosting shear and associated foliation. The main shear 
deviates away from northwest orientation at Buckreef North. 
The southern strike extent of the shear, as well as several sub parallel structures, have been identified as 
targets for further exploration. The bulk of ductile fabric is post mineralisation and does not necessarily 
reflect stress conditions during the mineralising event. 
 
 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

19 

The fault zone was subjected to early, pervasive iron carbonate alteration, which has undergone later brittle 
fracturing and brecciation with re-cementation by multiple events of grey to white quartz veining. Finely 
disseminated pyrite occurs in halos surrounding the zones of quartz veining and the degree of quartz veining 
is directly related to the tenor of the associated gold mineralisation. A late stage veining event characterised 
by white, bucky quartz veins is evident in the main zone and is barren of gold mineralisation, but is the only 
visible sign of the structure in outcrop.  
 
The gold mineralisation at Buckreef is non-refractory in both fresh and oxide material. Deep drill holes 
indicate that high grade mineralised zones plunge steeply to the north. Several narrow, more discontinuous 
sub-parallel zones of similar alteration and mineralisation have been defined both to the west and to the east 
of the main fault zone. 
 
Detailed logging of drill core reveals a prominent deepening of the oxidation profile above portions of both 
the Main and North Zones. The base of the oxidation zone occurs between 15m and 40 metres, with an 
average depth of 30m, and the overburden consists of both black cotton soils and lateritised duricrusts with 
an average depth of ±3m-4m, to a maximum of 20m. 
 
The Buziba Prospect 

The Buziba Prospect is located at the eastern end of the RGB (Figure 2, Figure 4 and Figure 5), Buziba was 
initially explored by Madini (Mineral Resources Department), East Africa Mines Limited (EAM), Tanganyika 
Gold Ltd (TGL) and most recently by IamgoldT from 2006 to 2009, with the object of defining a Mineral 
Resource in the area. 
 
The Buziba mineralisation is hosted in pillowed mafic units similar to that at Buckreef, but is less structurally 
confined and appears to be related both to, discontinuously developed zones of cleavage and to zones of 
intense potassium feldspar+quartz alteration associated with a suite of feldspar porphyry dykes and an 
internal felsic intrusive body. The gold mineralisation comprises two sets of quartz veins, which developed 
contemporaneously with existing cleavage zones. Veins show all degrees of deformation into the fabric 
suggesting that mineralisation continued syn-deformation. Numerous examples of virtually undeformed veins 
bearing the same alteration assemblage indicate that the mineralisation probably continued post peak 
deformation as well. 
 
The geometry of the mineralisation is highly irregular, forming a zone 200m thick and extending eastwest for 
at least 2,500m on the northern margin of a small granitic body. The mineralised alteration envelope appears 
to dip steeply to the south, sub-parallel to the stratigraphy and to the regional fabric. The majority of the 
mineralisation is directly related to veining and the deformation of veins seems to have influenced the 
variable gold distribution in the zone. The feldspar porphyry dykes and associated quartz-feldspar-biotite 
alteration have also acted to localise veining by forming rheological contrasts in the mafic sequence during 
the deformation events. The original intrusion of the dykes and the alteration has also influenced the 
geometry and continuity of the later gold mineralisation.  
 
Minor chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite and magnetite are known in the zone but the only sulphide of significance in 
the system is pyrite. 
 
The Tembo Prospect 

The Tembo prospect is located approximately 3km southwest of Buckreef, adjacent to the main Rwamagaza 
Shear Zone. Gold mineralisation at Tembo is tightly constrained within eastwest shears in meta-basaltic 
volcanic units. Alteration within the shear zone is characterised by a silicacarbonate-pyrite assemblage with 
the shear fabric being well preserved. Gold is associated with grey quartz thin veins, stringers and boudins 
parallel to the shear fabric. 
 
The Bingwa Prospect 

The Bingwa prospect is located at the northern margin of the RGB, adjacent to a sheared contact with a 
granitic intrusive and is approximately 4km east of Buckreef. Gold mineralisation has been identified in a 
drilling programme over a strike length of 350m and up to 100m below surface, with the main zone of 
mineralisation occurring over a strike length of 150m. Gold mineralisation at Bingwa is associated with quartz 
veining in strongly foliated and altered greenstone in the shear zone abutting the granitoid contact. The 
shear zone strikes northeast and dips steeply to the northwest. The main zone of mineralisation is 
associated with the junction of a northwest striking, shallowly north dipping fault and the northeast striking 
shear zone.  



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

20 

 
Deformation, alteration and gold mineralisation appear to be localised to rheological contacts, between 
basalt and the early quartz veins and also along the margin of the granite. The difficulty in constructing 
continuous grade envelopes may be due to limited continuity of the early quartz vein array, and/or the 
possibility that the veins are folded, transposed and boudinaged within shear zones.   
 
The majority of the mineralisation defined to date occurs within the oxide zone, which extends to 40m-60m 
below surface. The entire deposit is overlain by 5m-8m of overburden and transported alluvial. Much of the 
Bingwa gold mineralisation in the weathered profile occurs in lower saprolite, below the redox boundary.  
 
There is negligible upper saprolite below the overburden cover. Given that there is typically limited chemical 
dispersion of gold in lower mafic saprolite, this may be one of the reasons for poor lateral grade continuity at 
the Bingwa prospect. 

10 EXPLORATION (NI 12) 
The Buckreef Project has seen the subject of numerous exploration programmes by several companies over 
more than fifty years. As summarised in Table 5 and Section 6, the project was originally defined by a 1966 
United Nations exploration programme following up artisanal workings. The deposit was subsequently 
explored by the Tanzanian Mineral Resources Division (Madini) and developed into a small underground 
mine by Buckreef Gold Mining Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the State Mining Corporation 
(Stamico). The Buckreef Mine closed down in 1990 due to low gold prices and lack of working capital 
resulting in inability to purchase fuel and maintain plant ending in the flooding of the mine. 
 
Historically, the main focus of exploration was the Buckreef and Buziba Prospect areas and remainder of the 
tenement holding was largely under-explored resulting in limited sub-surface information. The exploration 
programmes conducted on the project area post 1999 are summarised in Table 7 and Table 8 and included 
regional mapping to 1:5000, gravity and IP surveys, reconnaissance geochemical surveys and extensive 
drilling programmes:- 

 

Table 7 : Summary of Exploration of Buckreef between 2000 and 2010 
DATE EXPLORATION UNDERTAKEN 

1999-2000 EAM signed n earn-in agreement with Ashanti AngloGold to explore Buckreef Project which was terminated late 2000. 16,324m of drilling in 67 drillholes, 18 of which were RC and 49 drillholes diamond (15,363m) 

2001-2003 
Spinifex Gold, operating for EAM, ran the project with very limited exploration work based on the follow up 
recommendations from the final exploration report by Ashanti AngloGold. 610 RC drillholes (49,000m) with 6 
diamond drillholes. IP geophysical survey over Buckreef 

2004-2005 

Following the merger between Spinifex Gold and Gallery Gold in 2003 significant exploration work was 
concluded on the project and new resources established on the Buckreef Mining licence. Resources were 
improved at Tembo and Bingwa prospects. Geophysics and geochemical soil surveys completed with 
additional RAB, RC and diamond drilling. 

2006-2009 

Following the merger between Gallery Gold and Iamgold Corporation of Canada in March 2006 EAM 
changed names to Iamgold Tanzania Ltd. Under IamgoldT, Buckreef Project was completed up to 
commencement of pre-feasibility studies before the company decided to close all its exploration activities in 
Tanzania in 2009 and in so doing decided to surrender back to the government all its exploration portfolio 
under the Buckreef Re development Agreement. 2,949 drillholes were drilled for 142,302m including 2,160 
aircore, 745 RC and 44diamond drillholes. Regional soil and termite mound reconnaissance sampling 
programme. Regional mapping. 

2010 In March 2010 the government of Tanzania granted afresh all the surrendered licences to Stamico, including the existed applications under IamgoldT.

10.1 Geophysics 

Gravity Surveys 

Spectral Geophysics (Botswana) was contracted during April 2008 to complete ground gravity surveys 
over the 5km2 and the data was interpreted by Southern Geoscience Consultants (SGC) in Australia. 
The final results were compiled into a 1:20,000 scale geological interpretation delineating twenty one 
targets and the Rwamagaza Shear Zone. Gravity surveys proved effective for the location of large first 
order structures and in 2008 the airborne magnetic data was interpreted into an image atlas for future 
target definition.

IP Surveys 

During 2007, 14 Induced polarization (IP) survey blocks were completed over 4 areas the four 
prospects Buckreef, Tembo, Bingwa and Buziba by Spectral Geophysics and processed by SGC 
Australia (Figure 6). These survey results highlighted altered fault/shears zone structures and in 
conjunction with magnetics can be used for targeting prospective strike extensions of existing ore 
bodies.

10.2 Geochemistry 

Several historical soil and rock chip sampling programs were completed over the Buckreef project 
area on a grid of 100mx100m, with closer spaced grids (80mx40m) over historical target areas and 
targets with a high density of lineaments and interpreted mineralised structures. A total of 2,028 rock 
chip samples, 29,546 soil samples and 481 termite mound samples were taken during the period 
1992-2009.  
 
Transported laterite, combined with Mbuga soils (60% of the area), hampers geochemical sampling 
and interpretation and Iamgold completed termite mound sampling over the problematic areas. To 
date the termite sample density is too low for identification of meaningful anomalies.  
 
The results of the soil geochemistry results are presented in Figure 7 and the observed anomaly 
trends are consistent with the known structures in the area. The largest soils anomalies occur are over 
the two main deposits at Buckreef and Buziba, showing minor anomalies in secondary cross cutting 
structures. 

11 DRILLING (NI 13) 
Significant drilling programmes have been conducted on the Buckreef Projects, as summarised in Table 5 
and Table 8 and illustrated in Figure 8. The AC and RAB drilling was only used to identify potential 
mineralisation and the results were excluded from all resource estimations. The RC and DD drilling at both 
areas was supervised by experienced geologists and completed by professional drilling contract companies 
independent of IamgoldT. RC and diamond drilling was completed by AfriDrill, West Side Drilling, Resource 
Drilling, Drillcorp, Stanley Mining Services and most recently by Tandrill.

The Buckreef orebody was drilled on a local eastwest oriented grid with drill traverses at 20m intervals along 
the strike of the gold mineralisation above 1,100mRL (surface approximately 1,225mRL). The majority of drill 
holes were steeply angled at 60º towards the grid east or west direction, normal to the strike of the gold 
mineralisation. On sections targeting the near surface gold mineralisation, the drillholes were spaced at 10m 
centres providing approximate 20m spaced vertical intercepts on the gold mineralisation. At Buckreef the 
North and Main Zone mineralisation occurs in shear zone with a true width of 10m, dipping steeply to the 
west. 
 
All RC drilling undertaken historically by EAM at Buziba  with auxiliary 
booster/compressors that permitted dry sampling. On average, the RC drilling achieved a recovery of 81% 
(Hellman and Schofield 2007). The initial RC holes identified as having potential for down hole water 
contamination were all twinned using appropriate RC or diamond drillholes. The RC resource delineation drill 
spacing was completed on a 40m-20m x 20m spacing at Buckreef and 50m 25m x 20m at Buziba. As a 
precaution to minimise interference and sampling by artisinal miners, the RC 1m samples were collected 
daily and transported to a central sample store where they were sampled and bagged. 
 
The diamond drilling core recovery was very good, the average core recovery was 93% (Hellman and 
Schofield 2007), particularly at Buckreef. Most of the diamond drillholes commenced with a tricone roller bit 
where near surface sampling was not required, followed by HQ diameter, which was reduced to NQ/NQ2 
when fresh rock was encountered. 
 
Ten HQ core holes were drilled at Buckreef to twin anomalous RC and diamond drillholes as part of a 
QA/QC program on historical assay practice and grade continuity.  
 
PQ metallurgical samples were collected at Buckreef and Busiba. All core was logged and sampled by 
qualified geologists in the full time employ of Iamgold. The half core is stored on site in a secure core yard 
facility and wet and dry core photography of uncut core undertaken. Surveys of inclination and azimuth were 
completed at nominal 30m-50m intervals for all RC and diamond drillholes completed since 2000. The 
survey tool was usually an Eastman single shot or Reflex camera and was operated by the drill contractor as 
part of normal drilling. 
 
The historic drilling programmes were conducted according to specific drilling protocols and the results 
incorporated into electronic databases for use in the construction of geological sections and 3D 
models used in Mineral Resource estimation. 
 

12 SAMPLING METHOD AND APPROACH (NI 14) 
The sampling methodology employed was dependent upon the drilling method and the protocols adhered to 
during the drilling and sampling campaign are within industry standard. The sampling of the diamond drill 
core was conducted by qualified geologists in the full time employment of Iamgold. In addition, Iamgold 
recognized that collection of samples, particularly for RC, AC and RAB samples, could introduce bias to 
assay results and therefore specific sampling methodology and submission procedures were followed. 
 
The RC drilling sampling methodology comprised collection through a cyclone at 1m intervals into large 
plastic bags. Each metre sample was riffle split on site, weighed and moisture content recorded for every 
metrer interval. RC assay samples were taken as either, 3m composites or, in the case of Buziba resource 
drilling, at 1m intervals.  
 
During composite sampling, the individual 1m riffle split reduced samples were collected in the field and 
retained for future analysis if warranted. Unique Sample ID ticket books with corresponding tear off sample 
tickets were printed and used to record sample details and assay samples. RC holes were stopped if 
persistent wet samples were encountered. The majority of RC samples collected since 1992 were 
homogenized and reduced to 2kg to 3kg on site by passing reduced samples at least 4 times through a 
single tier Jones riffler, which is demonstrated to be a more representative sample than that produced by 
stacked three tier splitters. 
 
The entire length of AC and RAB drill holes was collected as 1m samples and composited to 3m samples for 
assay. 
 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

26 

Diamond drill core was logged and processed for sampling on site. The majority of diamond drilling was 
NQ/NQ2 and core loss and drillers inconsistencies were accounted noted. Sample intervals for assaying 
were normally standard 1m or 0.5m lengths, varying on lithological boundaries when required. Lithological 
based samples did not exceed 1m in length. The core was sawed length ways. Regular cleaning of the core, 
core yard, saw and sampling equipment along with a prohibition on jewellery in the core yard all minimised 
potential contamination. 
 
Retained RC AC RAB samples were stored in central sample stores at the Buckreef and Buziba sites, whilst 
the retained half of the diamond drill core is stored in galvanized core trays at the Buckreef and Buziba core 
yards for future reference.  
 
All assay samples were batched on site. The half-core samples are considered by TRX to be representative 
of the mineralisation and no sample bias is expected. No drilling, recovery or sampling factors are 
considered to have materially impacted the representivity of the samples. 
 
12.1 Rock Density Measurements 

Bulk densities were determined by 1,232 
samples; 837 from diamond drill core and 395 from RC samples for oxide, transitional and primary 
material. Based on this data set the following bulk densities for the conversion of resource volumes to 
tonnes are determined:- 

 oxide zone, 2.0 g/cm3; 

 transition zone, 2.5 g/ cm3;; and 

 fresh rock, 2.8 g/ cm3;. 

 

13 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSIS AND SECURITY (NI 15) 
The majority of the samples from Buckreef and Busiba were prepared either at the on-site Buckreef field 
laboratory or prepared and analyzed at the independent, internationally ISO accredited SGS Lakefield and 
Humac Laboratories in Mwanza with quality control check sampling undertaken at ALS Brisbane, ALS 
Johannesburg and Genalysis Laboratory Perth. Conventional sample preparation, analytical, internal quality 
control and reporting procedures are used at all laboratories and are considered appropriate to meet JORC 
and National Instrument reporting standards.  
 
Gold analysis was by conventional fire assay and Atomic Absorption Spectrography (AAS) to a lower limit of 
detection (LLD) of 0.005g/t Au. The standard laboratory preparation procedure at primary Humac laboratory 
was as follows:- 

 samples were oven dried prior to preparation and splitting; 

 RC/AC/RAB samples were cone crushed to -2mm, with equipment cleaned with compressed 
air; 

 core samples were jaw crushed to -6mm and then cone crushed to -2mm; 

 a nominal 1kg to 1.5kg sub-sample was riffle split and pulverized by ring mill to -150# (master 
pulp). A barren flush was not used between samples, only before commencing work on the 
batch and subsequently inter-batch; 

 approximately 200g of the pulp was collected from the master pulp; and 

 fire assay 50g of the pulp, determination for Au by AAS, 0.01ppm LLD. 

Generally a minimum of 10% of samples (new aliquots, pulps taken from 200g pulp) were repeated on a 
different day to the original analyses. Each fusion batch contained at least one Certified Reference Material 
(CRM) and one blank supplied by the laboratory. Humac reported on a quarterly basis the results of internal 
standards, blanks and random repeats, as well as the results of wet sieve analysis. 
 
At all stages of the sample storage, preparation and analysis, the samples were in secure laboratory 
facilities. The sample preparation, analytical procedures were suitable for the particular rock type and the 
expected orebody characteristics.

14 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL (NI 16) 
Systematic quality control and recording was employed on all historical exploration programmes. The QA/QC 
measures and results were reviewed and reported by Hellamn and Schofield in 2004 and 2007.  
 
The ISO accredited laboratories utilised comprehensive in-house QA/QC measures from sample preparation 
to instrumental finish and reporting of the results. Equipment was cleaned between batches and crushing 
and pulverising was monitored by sieve testing. Routine laboratory Quality Control sampling (pulp duplicates 
and pulp repeats) was also completed on pulps retained at the laboratory. This provided an indication of any 
sample preparation/sub-sampling/sample digest and assay error at the primary laboratory. 
The field QA/QC protocols included insertion of regular standards, duplicates and blanks in the field for all 
sample batches collected at Buckreef and Buziba. The resultant QC data was reviewed on receipt of assay 
data and assessed monthly, which permitted immediate intervention on sampling and analytical issues. Field 
QA/QC protocols comprised the following;- 

 commercially available CRM samples from Geostats (Australia) were inserted into sample 
batches at a minimum frequency of 1 in 40 within recognised mineralised zones (G302-4 at 
1.68g/t Au; G6996-7C at 5.99g/t Au; G997-5 at 7.31g/t Au and G999-4 at 3.02g/t Au); 

 field duplicates comprised splits off the sample cyclone and the sample interval was selected 
by the geologist. Duplicates are taken at a nominal frequency of 1 in 40; and 

 blanks were 1m drill samples that had returned an assay value of less than 0.01 g/t Au, 
confirmed by re-sampling the interval and submitting for check analysis. Blank positions were 
selected by the geologist and were inserted within zones of mineralisation. This permitted 
assessment of cross contamination from higher grade samples during the sample preparation 
stage. Blanks were submitted at a nominal frequency of 1 in 40. 

15 DATA VERIFICATION (NI 16) 
Database 

The historic drillhole database, compiled from the extensive drilling programmes by previous owners of the 
Buckreef Project, was provided to Hellman and Schofield (2007) as the basis for the Mineral Resource 
estimation. The database was interrogated by Iamgold as follows:- 

 assessment of historical field duplicates; 

 re-assaying of historical pulp samples; 

 several programmes undertaken of replicate assaying of archival pulps at independent referee 
laboratories; and 

 a programme of 10 diamond core twinning of historical RC intersections throughout the Main 
Zone at Buckreef. 

As a consequence of the database review, some historical and all RAB and open hole percussion drill holes 
were deemed unsuitable for inclusion to the Mineral Resource estimation. Drillhole assay and geology 
logging data were supplied as Micromine  database files containing collar, down-hole survey and interval 
tables. A summary of the available drillhole information is presented in Table 8. 
 
15.1 Assessment of the QA/Qc Data 

The review of the 194 re-assay sample data by Hellman and Schofield (2007) indicated acceptable 
assaying precision between the Buckreef, Humac and SGS Laboratories and suggests acceptable 
correlation between assay methods. The results of the review of 1,978 historic duplicate pairs, 
indicated good replication. 
 
In all cases, the assaying of the four CRM used, returned values within an acceptable range (±10%) of 
the recommended grade. The field blanks results showed that no significant cross contamination in 
the sample preparation stage occurred. Scatter plots of laboratory referee analyses show a good 
correlation. 
 
The results of the RC drillholes and their twinned diamond drillholes indicated good visual correlation. 
Internal zones of low grade were reflected similarly in the two sampling methods. Spot checks on the 
calculated gold intersections proved satisfactory and the mineralised widths determined from both 
methodologies proved to be very similar. 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

28 

 
The historic QA/QC data available provided assurance that the data is not flawed by sampling or 
assaying bias. The most conclusive data are the results from the diamond core hole twinning of the 
earlier RC intercepts. A positive bias toward the diamond core assaying is thought to be partly due to 
the undervaluing of the sample gold grade by the AR assaying used historically. The re-assaying 
programmes undertaken by Iamgold of archival sample pulps by fire assay at two independent assay 
laboratories supports this conclusion. Hellman and Schofield considered the QA/QC performance to 
be good and the data suitable for incorporation in Mineral Resource estimates (2007). 
 

16 ADJACENT PROPERTIES (NI 17) 
The Buckreef project is situated within the LVG, which is host to numerous small and large scale gold mining 
operations as illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 4. The nearest large-scale gold mines and exploration 
projects are as follows and the localites of which are illustrated in Figure 2:- 

 Geita Gold Mine: owned by AngloGold Ashanti Limited which produced 272,000oz of gold in 
2009 (www.infomine.com); 

 Tulawaka Project: an exploration project and gold mine owned by Northern Mining and 
Exploration Limited and Tan range Exploration Corporation. The Tulawaka Mine produced 
124,743oz of gold in 2005 and 94,000oz in2009 (www.infomine.com); and 

 Bulyanhulu Mine owned by Barrick Gold Corporation and produced 350,000oz of gold in 2004 
(www.infomine.com). 

The LVG represents an important, largescale gold province in which regional mineralising systems have 
utilised rheologic, chemical and structural boundaries to remobilise and concentrate gold to produce 
economic deposits. Buckreef Project occurs in the LVG context with similarly suitable lithologic and structural 
features and theorectically therefore, could prove as potentially prospective.  
 
Venmyn has not verified the public domain information with regards the Geita, Tulawaka and Bulyanhulu 
Mines and the information provided is not necessarily indicative of the mineralisation at Buckreef Project. 
 

17 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING (NI 18) 
The Buckreef ore has been subjected to numerous testwork programmes undertaken over a 13 year period 
by Independent Metallurgical Laboratories (IML) Australia. In summary, the testwork results completed for 
composited, representative samples from Buckreef between 1999 and 2006 were as follows:-  

 Buckreef oxide material was free milling with cyanidation recoveries in the low 90%s; 

 Buckreef sulphide ore from Main, West and North Zones had highly variable recovery by 
cyanidation, returning values between the mid 70%s and low 90%s; 

 no relationship between recovery and depth was apparent; 

 no relationship between zone and recovery had been recognised; 

 the ore was moderately hard but no detailed comminution testwork had been conducted until 
2006; and 

 recovery improved with decreasing grind size, suggesting flotation followed by fine grinding as 
a potential processing route. 

The initial testwork conducted in April 2005 on the Buziba Prospect focussed on multi-element head grade 
analysis and cyanide leaching response. A total of 33 oxide samples were composited from 2 oxide sources 
and 13 sulphide samples and the results of the testwork are summarised as follows:-.  

 gravity separation recovered more than 45% of the gold into low weight concentrates for both 
the oxide and sulphide composites; and 

 cyanidation of both the gravity concentrates and gravity tailings gave an overall gold recovery 
of 94.9% for the oxide composite and 90.2% for the sulphide composite. The cyanidation tails 
grade for gravity concentrates were 1.92g/t Au for the oxide and 3.57g/t Au for the sulphide 
indicating that additional recovery could be gained through optimising the cyanidation of the 
gravity concentrates. 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

29 

 
Phase 2 of the metallurgical testwork programme by IML began in 2006 on a selection of representative 
diamond cores samples from the Buckreef deposit.  
 
Composite samples from the Buckreef Main and Buckreef North domains were created to represent the 
expected run of mine ore, and subjected to a series of baseline tests through a range of process routes to 
identify the most appropriate treatment methodology and generate preliminary project evaluation and 
engineering data.  
 
Oxide ore types were evaluated by whole ore leaching and gravity/leaching treatment routes and additional 
investigations into flotation and finer grinding for the preliminary ore types were carried out by Metallurgical 
Project Consultants (Pty) Ltd (MPC) (2007). 
 
The test work results indicated:- 

 moderate to high gravity recoveries for all ore types; 

 the presence of coarse gold led to significant variability in the total gold recoveries for all 
process routes, although the variability was not sufficient to mask the comparison between 
process routes; 

 the removal of gravity gold prior to leaching resulted in an improvement in gold recovery for all 
ore types with the exception of the Buziba oxide ore; 

 given the relatively low cost of gravity recovery circuits and the operational benefits of 
excluding coarse gold from the leach circuits, it was recommended that gravity recovery be 
included in any project analysis; 

 fine grinding of the primary ore types prior to leaching returned a modest benefit during the 
analysis; 

 the magnitude of the recovery increase was unlikely to be sufficient to justify inclusion of 
flotation and fine grinding in any project analysis; 

 preliminary coarse ore leaching and coarse gravity/leaching were also investigated by MPC to 
determine the heap and vat leach amenability; 

 comminution test work was carried out in order to develop preliminary design criteria for the 
prefeasibility process design. The test work indicated that all of the ore types were amenable 
to conventional multi-stage crushing and ball milling or single-stage crushing and SAG milling; 
and 

 both oxide ore types contain a high clay component and may suffer from material handling 
problems when treated on their own.  

 
The recommended recovery assumptions for each ore type are presented in Table 9:-

In 2008, a study was undertaken to establish the amenability of the Buckreef and Buziba ore to dissolution 
via heap leaching (simulated) and bottle rolling. Ten samples were composited and exported to SGS 
Southdale Laboratories in South Africa for analysis. 
 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011

The samples were crushed to specific sizes (50mm, 25mm, 12.5mm, 6mm and 2.34mm) and underwent 
simulated heap leaching using the following conditions:- 

 pre-conditioning for 1 hour; 

 cyanide addition (5kg\tonne); 

 dissolution for 7 days; and 

 samples were taken every day for analysis. 

The highest dissolutions that were achieved were from -2.34mm size (achieving 88.9% recovery). As the 
particle size increased the gold dissolution decreased. At a crushed size fraction of 25mm-50mm 
(crushing/grinding any finer than this increases costs considerably) the best recovery of 75% was in oxide 
ore. Transitional and fresh ore at the same size fraction had considerably lower recoveries of 35%-50%. 

18 MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES (NI 19) 
Hellman and Schofield was retained by TRX to undertake estimation of Mineral Resources for the Buckreef 
Project. Hellman and Schofield estimated the Mineral Resource using Multiple Indicator Kriging (MIK), a 
method that has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of open pit Mineral Resources in gold 
deposits of diverse geological styles.   
 
Buckreef is a medium to high-grade gold deposit with the majority of possible economic gold mineralisation 
contained within vertical to steep east dipping lode structures (Figure 9). Several separate lodes were 
interpreted within the study area, with the Main and North Lodes being of most economic interest. The 
mineralised domains were determined from drillhole cross-sections, which were formed into 3D wireframes 
and used to allocate primary or mineralisation domains. Secondary or weathering domains were also 
allocated using weathering surfaces. No other geological controls were considered in the interpretation 
process.  
 
The February 2011 Buckreef Prospect Mineral Resources (Venmyn D962R) were estimated over 
approximately 1,400m of strike length using the MIK technique implemented with GS3 software, a dedicated 
resource estimation software produced by Hellman and Schofield. The model estimates ore into panels with 
dimensions of 10m (east) by 20m (north) by 5m (elevation), which approximates the drillhole sample spacing 
throughout the majority of the study area.  
 
A block support adjustment was used to estimate the gold resources at Buckreef. The shape of the local 
block gold grade distribution was assumed to be lognormal. The gold estimates within each panel were 
initially classified according to the distribution of sampling in the kriging neighbourhood. This classification 
scheme took into account the uncertainty in the estimates related to the proximity and distribution of the 
informing composites.  
 
The Buckreef Prospect Mineral Resource estimate reported in February 2011 was reported at various cut-off 
grades which would span the range of interest for open pit optimisation. The estimate includes only those 
Mineral Resources occurring above the 1,100mRL level, which was the anticipated maximum depth which 
could potentially be economically mined by open pit. The National Instrument compliant Mineral Resources 
for the Buckreef Prospect at February 2011 estimated by Hellman and Schofield are presented in Table 10 
(Venmyn D962R):-

Subsequent to the publication of the February 2011 Mineral Resource estimates, TRX made a strategic 
decision to re-publish its Mineral Resource statement at a 0.5g/t Au cut-off grade including the mineralisation 
below the 1,100mRL level, as the prospects for economic extraction had improved under the prevailing gold 
market conditions. The Update June 2011 Mineral Resource statement for the Buckreef Prospect at various 
cut-off grades is presented in Table 11 for comparison purposes.  
 
The Mineral Resources for the Tembo and Bingwa Prospects were estimated by Hellman and Schofield in 
2006 and 2007 (unpublished report) and have undergone no material change since that time. The Mineral 
Resources for Buziba were materially changed due to additional exploration efforts but remain unchanged 
from the February 2011 estimates published in Venmyn D926R. 
 
Buziba is a medium grade gold deposit with the majority of possible economic gold mineralisation contained 
within shear related, vertical to steep north and south dipping structures, within quartz/pyrite veins present in 
shears, lithological contacts and in brittle fractured porphyries. The Mineral Resources were estimated over a 
3km strike length to a depth of 230m. The search distance radii for the Measured category were set at 
easting 35m, northing 15m and elevation 20m. The Indicated and Inferred search radii were easting 52.5m, 
northing 22.5m and elevation 30m. The lack of close spaced cross section data influenced the Mineral 
Resource classification.

As noted previously, subsequent to the publication of the February 2011 Mineral Resource statement, TRX 
made the strategic decision to re-publish its Mineral Resource statement utilising the estimates that had 
been made by Hellman and Schofield at cut-off grades of 0.5g/t Au and including the mineralisation below 
the 1,100mRL level. The final update June 2011 summary Mineral Resource statement for the entire 
Buckreef Project at 0.5g/t Au cut-off grade and including additional mineralisation below 1,100mRL level, is 
presented in Table 13.  
 
The increase in tonnage for the Buziba Prospect is accounted for by the fact that the deposit is a low grade, 
high tonnage deposit. The initial cut-off grade of 1g/t Au excluded a large portion of the mineralisation from 
the Mineral Resource estimation but the effect of lowering the cut-off has been to permit the inclusion of this 
mineralisation in the estimate.

19 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS (NI 25) 
The Buckreef Project is primarily an undeveloped exploration project, although the project area includes the 
Buckreef Mine area that was exploited by Stamico until the mine closed in 1994. The historic mine site will 
ultimately form part of any future operation developed within the Buckreef Prospect. 
 
The area contained within the exploration permits is subject to intensive artisanal mining of a regulated and 
unregulated nature. Regulated smallscale mining is undertaken within Primary Mining Licenses (PML) that 
are limited to a size of 10ha and available to Tanzanian nationals. Unregulated miners are more transient by 
nature and engage in shallow shaft sinking and the use of metal detectors to identify surface gold. The 
environmental impacts of these activities will require rehabilitation work by the project owner for those areas 
ultimately within the licence area. 
 
Access roads and other infrastructure built for the purpose of exploration that can be used by the public or 
neighbouring operations must be open, provided compensation is paid and no prejudice is caused to the 
operator. Restricted areas may be defined within the permit to protect the environment, the natural habitat, 
archaeological sites, or public interest infrastructures. As part of Pre-Feasibility and later Feasibility Studies, 
URS (Australia) and Lorax/MTL Consulting (a Canadian/Tanzanian partnership) undertook extensive work 
towards an EIA for the Buckreef and Buziba Prospects. 
 
The outstanding requirement to complete the EIA is the hydro-geological assessment. Similarly, a Social 
Impact Assessment (SIA) was undertaken by Social Sustainability Services Ltd of Australia and the 
University of Dar es Salaam in 2006. The baseline data remains with the university. The assessment 
identified the footprint area that would result in resettlement of affected families at project development 
stage.  
 
Fortunately, Iamgold maintained high standards of environmental management and reclamation. Surface 
damage was fully compensated in line with government requirements under the Lands Act of 1998 (Iamgold 
2009). A total of 2,702 drillpads were rehabilitated with photographic records. All the hand dug access tracks 
and drill lines were re-planted by the farmers with crops and natural vegetation. There will be a requirement 
for tree planting in the near future as per the Forest Department requirement if exploration activities are 
undertaken in forest reserves. 
 
All compensation was implemented through the offices of local government. The environmental programme 
was supported by a robust community benefits programme which spent in excess of USD500,000 to date. 
The programme included community infrastructure, water projects, health & education projects.  
 

20 SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS (NI 21 AND NI 22) 
The technical review of the Buckreef Project has highlighted the following:- 

 the Buckreef Project is an advanced exploration gold project located within the highly 
prospective Rwamagaza Greenstone Belt, which forms part of the Lake Victoria Goldfield. The 
project comprises four prospects, Buckreef, Buziba, Tembo and Bingwa for which varying 
degrees of exploration have been undertaken;  

 the mineralisation is classified as a medium grade (1.8g/t Au to 2.7g/t Au), orogenic gold 
deposit, developed in Archaean supracrustal sequences, syn- and post, regional thermo-
tectonic events. The sequences are metamorphosed to lower greenschist facies and the 
mineralisation is structurally controlled in regional shear zones and associated with felsic 
intrusives; 

 extensive geochemical and geophysical surveys have been completed, as well as numerous 
drilling programmes. The historic drilling data has been verified, and combined with new 
exploration data, to be incorporated into a Mineral Resource estimate compliant with JORC 
and National Instrument reporting criteria. The adequacy of the data density is reflected in the 
Mineral Resource classification categories; 

 the Mineral Resources estimate for the Buckreef Project is summarised as follows:-  

o Measured+Indicated Mineral Resources: 30.1Mt at 1.34g/t Au for 1.3Moz 
contained gold; and 



 

NI 43-101 Technical Report for TRX, Tanzania June 2011                                                   
 

37 

o Inferred Mineral Resources: 17.2Mt at 1.5g/t Au for 0.84Moz contained gold. 
 metallurgical testwork on Buckreef Prospect ore indicated that oxide and transitional ore types 

were amenable to treatment using typical CIL processing techniques. The testwork indicated 
that fresh ores sourced from Buckreef may benefit from flotation and a finer grind; 

 metallurgical recoveries from Buckreef ores were anticipated to be in the low 90%s; 

 metallurgical testwork on Buziba ore indicated it is amenable to treatment using gravity and 
CIL processing techniques. Metallurgical recoveries were anticipated to be in the low to mid 
90%s; 

 heap leach and bottle-roll test results indicated that, at a crushed size fraction of 25mm-
50mm, the best recovery of 75% was in oxide ore. Transitional and fresh ore at the same size 
fraction had considerably lower recoveries of 35%-50%; 

 the geological continuity and grade distribution of the Buckreef mineralisation is well 
constrained and definite upside potential to define additional Mineral Resources in extensions 
of the known orebody has been confirmed through drilling. The Mineral Resource base maybe 
increased through implementing changes in the cut-off grades as the gold price improves; 

 detailed infill drilling at the Buziba, Tembo and Bingwa Prospects will upgrade the 
classification of the Mineral Resources; 

 the prospectivity of the Buckreef Project is such that, advancement of the exploration 
programme to Scoping Study and Pre-feasibility Study (PFS) level is warranted. TRX plans to 
initiate a PFS within the near future and dependent upon the outcome of that study, intends 
fast tracking the open pit development process so that commencement of the ramp-up to 
mining can be undertaken within 30 months of February 2011. The estimation of costs for the 
PFS is still to be undertaken; and  

 the exploration potential of the RGB has not been fully realised and TRX is well positioned to 
benefit when the full extent of the prospectivity of the greenstone belt is determined. 
Furthermore, the Buckreef Project benefits particularly from being an open pittable gold 
deposit, which can be brought rapidly into production to benefit from the current favourable 
gold market conditions. The definite upside potential to define further Mineral Resources 
serves to provide focus for future development of the project. 

 
 
Effective Date:  28th June 2011

Resource. It is estimated with a lower level of confidence than a Proved Reserve. It is 
inclusive of diluting materials and allows for losses that may occur when the material is 
mined. Appropriate assessments, which may include feasibility studies, have been carried 
out, including consideration of, and modification by, realistically assumed mining, 
metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. 
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction is reasonably 
justified. 

Prospect A deposit with the potential for economic extraction. 

Pyrite pressure-temperature conditions, and so is found in many geological environments. 
Pyrophyllite A yellowish white, grey, or pale-green phyllosilicate. 

Quartzite 
A metamorphic rock consisting primarily of quartz grains, formed by the recrystallisation of 
sandstone by thermal or regional metamorphism or a sandstone composed of quartz grains 
cemented by silica.

Recovered grade/Yield The actual grade of ore realised after the mining and treatment process. 
Reef Mineralised lode.  

Rehabilitation 
The process of restoring mined land to a condition approximating to a greater or lesser 
degree its original state. Reclamation standards are determined by the Russia Federation 
Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs and address ground and surface water, topsoil, 
final slope gradients, waste handling and re-vegetation issues. 

Rhyolite 
One of a group of extrusive rocks commonly showing flow texture, and typically porphyritic, 
with phenocrysts of quartz and potassium feldspar in a glassy to microcrystalline 
groundmass. 

Sample The removal of a small amount of rock pertaining to the deposit which is used to estimate the grade of the deposit and other geological parameters.  

Sampling Taking small pieces of rock at intervals along exposed mineralisation for assay (to determine the mineral content). 
Saprolite Insitu weathered profile on laterite terrane where the soil comprises mostly clays 

Sedimentary Formed by the deposition of solid fragmental or chemical material that originates from weathering of rocks and is transported from a source to a site of deposition. 
Specific gravity/S.G. Measure of quantity of mass per unit of volume, density. 
Stockpile A store of unprocessed ore or marginal grade material. 
Stripping Removal of waste overburden covering the mineral deposit. 
Stripping ratio Ratio of ore rock to waste rock. 

Subduction The movement of one crustal plate (lithospheric plate) under another so that the  

Tailings The waste products of the processing circuit. These may still contain very small quantities of the economic mineral. 

Tailings dam  Dams or dumps created from waste material from processed ore after the economically recoverable metal or mineral has been extracted. 

Tonnage 
Quantities where the tonne is an appropriate unit of measure. Typically used to measure 
reserves of metal-bearing material in-situ or quantities of ore and waste material mined, 
transported or milled. 

Trenching Making elongated open-air excavations for the purposed of mapping and sampling. 

Veins A tabular or sheet like body of one or more minerals deposited in openings of fissures, joints or faults, frequently with associated replacement of the host rock. 
Yield/Recovered grade The actual grade of ore realised after the mining and treatment process.
