 PROPERTY AND LOCATION 1.1

The land status of the Corani Project is a series of twelve (12) mineral claims or concessions. 
Mineral concessions in Peru are filed with the Instituto Nacional de Concesiones y Catastro 
Minera (INACC) which is part of the Ministerio de Energía y Minas in Peru (MINEM). Claims can 
vary in size from 100 to 1,000 hectares (ha). They are rectangular geometries parallel to the 
UTM grid system employed in the district.  The Corani Project is located in the district of Corani, 
province of Carabaya department of Puno, in Peru, and covers an aggregate extent of 
5,180.1213 hectares.  The concessions are fully controlled by BCM and are free of any 
mortgage, lien, charge, royalty, or encumbrance. 

The twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Project are subject to compliance with 
payment of annual license fees in the amount of US$3.00 per hectare ("License Fees").  In 
addition, they are subject to an annual maintenance requirement with either of the following 
alternative obligations: minimum required levels of annual production of at least US$100 per ha 
in gross sales ("Minimum Production"); or payment of an additional amount referred as Penalty 
of US$6.00 per ha for the 7th through 11th year following the granting of the concession, and of 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 2 

US$20.00 per ha thereafter; or exploration expenditures of 10 times the Penalty. Compliance 
with one of these three maintenance obligations, together with timely payment of License Fees, 
is required by them in good standing. Failure to comply with License Fee payments or Penalty 
payments for two consecutive years causes the forfeiture of the mineral concessions. 

In the year 2018, the twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Project shall be subject to 
the obligations of Minimum Production, Penalties and exploration expenditures in accordance 
with the maintenance regime in force as of October 2008 whereby: 

 The minimum production will be equivalent to one Tax Unit per year (approximately U.S. 
$1,333.00) per hectare granted for metallic minerals, and 10% of one Tax Unit per year per 
hectare granted for non-metallic minerals ("Minimum Production"). 

 Failure to attain Minimum Production will trigger the obligation to pay a penalty equivalent 
to 10% of the Minimum Production per year per hectare, until the year in which the 
Minimum Production is attained. 

 Year 2028 shall be the maximum deadline for the mineral concessions comprising the 
Corani Project to attain Minimum Production. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of 
these mineral concessions. 

Control and current status were verified in August 2017 through an electronic database search 
of the Geologic Mining and Metallurgical Institute (INGEMMET).  All concessions are in good 
standing. 

 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE 1.2

The Project site is located in the eastern Andes mountain range, between 4,600 and 5,200 m 
above sea level (masl). The area is characterized by mountainous terrain dominated by volcanic 
rock above which sits glacial gravel. The lithologic and climatic conditions have given rise to a 
series of cirques or bowl-shaped, steep-walled basins. Apart from the vegetation associated 
with the wetlands mentioned below, areas of "puna" or alpine tussock grassland occupy the 
valleys and moderate to steep slopes. The areas above 4,700 masl mostly consist of steep 
mountainous slopes where erosion and climatic conditions largely prevent the development of 
soils or vegetation. These areas are scarcely vegetated with species specially evolved to 
withstand the harsh conditions. The naturally occurring acidic soils related to oxidation of sulfide 
bearing materials and the resulting ARD from exposed mineralized zones within the Project 
area have also prevented the development of vegetation where these conditions occur. 

Existing access to the Project site is primarily by road from the town of Macusani (located on the 
paved dual lane Interoceanic Highway), which is more readily accessible from the town of 
Juliaca, also serviced by commercial airlines from Lima. This route typically takes 4.5 to 5 
hours. There are other access routes to the site from Cusco, taking approximately 6 hours by 
vehicle on increasingly primitive roads approaching the site. The City of Cusco is also serviced 
by commercial airlines from Lima. 

The nearest town of significant size and with significant infrastructure is Macusani, which is the 
capital of the Province of Carabaya in the Region of Puno. Macusani is approximately 30 km 
east of the Project in a direct line. The access road from Huiquisa Bridge to the Permanent 
Camp will be improved. The length of the proposed Mine Access Road connecting the process 
Plant to Macusani is anticipated to be approximately 64 km. The Project site is located in the 
district of Corani, also in the Province of Carabaya. The closely orientated campesino 
communities of Chacaconiza and Quelcaya, which have a joint population of approximately 200 
families (80 and 120 families, respectively), will be directly impacted by the mine development, 
in terms of landholding, rights to water, employment, etc. The community consultation 
undertaken with the Chacaconiza and Quelcaya communities to date has included a proposal 
for mining employment, generating widespread acceptance, mainly among younger community 
members, the teachers at local educational facilities, and community leaders. The current labor 
force is generally unskilled, mainly working on highway remediation and maintenance. A 
technical training program is planned to develop the skills of community members to fulfil 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 3 

employment requirements of the Project. The Project's requirement for labor will exceed the 
labor resources available in the Chacaconiza and Quelcaya communities. A ranking system will 
be developed with regard to geographical location of employment applicants, together with 
categorization and quantification of the labor force required. 

 HISTORY 1.3

Prior to the early 1950s, mineral exploration in the Corani district consisted of shallow prospect 
pits and adits in the northern portion of the current Project area. These prospects are of 
unknown age and may date back to colonial Spanish time. Antimony prospects south and east 
of the property reportedly were active in the early 1900s, when there was limited antimony 
production (C.R. Petersen, 1967). 

The first modern evaluation of silver-lead mineralization began with the location of mineral 
concessions in 1951, and in 1956 Compañía Minera Korani was formed to develop the silver-
lead mineralization previously prospected. The mines were developed and operated from 1956 
to at least 1967. Total historical production is uncertain, but is estimated at 100,000 tonnes of 
silver-lead-zinc ore. In early 1967, estimated mine production was reported at about 3,400 short 
tons per month, with grades of 7.0-9.0% lead, 2.3% zinc, and 8.0 to 11.0 oz/ton silver (C.R. 
Petersen, 1967). 

The next exploration activity was by a private Peruvian company, Minsur. That exploration was 
reported to include 40 shallow drill holes in various locations, including a number of close 
proximity holes in the gold zone (located south of the current resource area). Although Minsur is 
an active mining company in Peru, attempts by BCM to secure copies of Minsur's exploration 
data have been unsuccessful. None of Minsur's exploration information is available or verifiable, 
although, reportedly, gold mineralization was encountered in some of Minsur's drilling. 

In late 2003 and early 2004, Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration began a surface exploration 
program for porphyry copper mineralization. That initial work by Rio Tinto defined anomalous 
silver and lead mineralization to the south of the Korani mines and also defined a zone of 
anomalous gold mineralization in rock and soils. The concession ownership by Compañía 
Minera Korani apparently lapsed during the 1970s. The ownership of Minsur also lapsed prior to 
Rio Tinto's exploration activities after 2000. Rio Tinto re-established some of the older 
concessions in their name beginning in 2003. BCM has added two concessions early in 2005 to 
create the current land position described in Section 4. 

Six previous resource estimates and two previous mineral reserve estimates have been 
completed for the Project and are published in previous technical reports beginning in 2006. 
Since 2006, the Measured and Indicated resource has grown from approximately 40 Moz of 
silver to over 300 Moz of silver. 

 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION  1.4

The Project area is underlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks of the Quenemari Formation, 
specifically a thick series of crystal-lithic tuffs and andesite flows, which overlie variably 
deformed Lower Paleozoic to Mesozoic metasediments of the Ambo and Tarma Groups. The 
primary host of mineralization is the Chacacuzina Member of the Quenemari Formation. The 
Chacacuzina is the youngest member of the Quenemari, and is comprised of a sequence of 
crystal-lithic and crystal-vitric-lithic tuffs. The tuffs are widely hydrothermally altered and 
pervasively argillized to low-temperature clays, and are variably faulted, fractured, and 
brecciated. 

Mineralization at the Corani Project occurs in three distinct and separate zones: Corani Main, 
Corani Minas, and Corani Este, each differing slightly in character with regard to both alteration 
and mineral assemblages. In general, mineralization in outcrops throughout the Corani Project 
is associated with iron and manganese oxides, barite, and silica. Silicification is both pervasive 
and structurally controlled along veins. In drill core, the mineralization occurs in typical low to 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 4 

intermediate sulfidation Ag-Pb-Zn mineral assemblages. The most abundant silver-bearing 
mineral is fine-grained argentian tetrahedrite or freibergite.  

Structurally, the Corani deposit is situated within a stacked sequence of listric normal faults 
striking dominantly north to north-northwest with moderate to shallow (50° to <10°) westerly 
dips. The hanging walls of the listric faults are extensively fractured and brecciated, providing 
the structural preparation for subsequent or syngenetic mineralization. The stacked listric faults 
are more prominent in the Corani Minas and Corani Main areas. The Corani Este area contains 
a single known listric fault with an extensively fractured and brecciated hanging wall. The 
contact with the underlying Paleozoic sediments corresponds locally to listric faults dipping 
shallowly to the west.  

 DEPOSIT TYPES 1.5

The Corani deposit is best described as a low- to intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit 
with silver, lead, and zinc mineralization hosted in stock works, veins, and breccias. 
Mineralization is principally located in a set of lístric faults dipping west, with dilational segments 
related to subvertical structures and breccias in the hanging wall, and veinlets forming 
stockworks in the footwall. Structural control of the mineralization is a product of extensional 
tectonics that developed the series of north- to northwest-trending fractures and faults, and 
whose movements provided the structural preparation for the influx of mineralizing hydrothermal 
fluids.  

Mineralization at Corani is likely both laterally and vertically distal to an intrusive fluid source. 
Mineral textures grade from coarse crystalline quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite in the southern portion 
of the Project area, to finer grained, pyrite-dominated sulfide minerals in the north, suggesting a 
south-to-north hydrothermal fluid flow. This spatial zonation suggests a rapidly cooled ore fluid 
typical of a distal setting surrounding a buried intrusion. The multiphase nature of the 
mineralization and zonation at Corani may be related to multiple fluid exsolution events from an 
evolving porphyry type system that possibly underlies the southern part of the area. 
Alternatively, the mineralizing solutions may be related to shallow, subvolcanic dome 
emplacement. 

 EXPLORATION 1.6

BCM began exploring the Corani Project in early 2005. In addition to drilling, exploration 
activities carried out by BCM include detailed geologic mapping, trenching, and geophysical 
surveying.  

BCM has conducted general geologic surface mapping over the entire Project area. The total 
mapped surface is about 4.5 km wide (east-west) and 7.5 km long (north-south).  In 2015, 
detailed surface mapping, including lithology, alteration, and structures, was performed at a 
scale of 1:2500 in the area of the proposed pits. 

BCM has completed 25 trenches within the Project resource area (Corani Main, Minas, and 
Este) to verify the continuity of the structures covered by Quaternary sediments. Spacing 
between the trenches is roughly 50 to 100 meters. Channel samples from these trenches have 
produced an associated 1,295 assay intervals for a total of 2,924 meters of trench data. 

VDG del Perú S.A.C. (VDG) conducted a ground geophysical campaign at the Corani Project 
 on behalf of BCM in the fall of 2005. A total of 44.20 line-km of induced polarization (IP) data 
was collected, along with 50.95 line-km of magnetic survey. The geophysical surveys were 
aimed at assisting in geological mapping, including lithologies and key structures and at 
mapping mineralization and alteration associated with a low sulfidation gold-silver system. The 
objective of the IP/Res survey was to map the electrical response by means of high-resolution 
IP traverses across the favorable north-south corridor identified based on the results of both 
trench and drilling exploration. The field results of both methods were of good quality and were 
meaningful. The final chargeability and resistivity depth sections mapped systematically clear 
contrasts from line to line between the sub-surface and a nominal depth of 283 meters below 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 5 

surface. The chargeability outlined five (5) IP anomalies, two of which correspond to the Corani 
Main and Corani Este areas, respectively. Those anomalies accurately mapped the known 
mineralization and extended the size of both mineralized zones. 

 DRILLING 1.7

Since 2005, BCM has completed a total of 556 drill holes at the Corani Project for a total of 
approximately 100,494.57 m. Drilling was completely by the Peruvian contractor, Bradly MDH 
primarily using LD250, JKS35, and LJ44 drill rigs. All of the drilling to date has been completed 
using diamond core drilling methods to produce either HQ (6.35 cm dia.) or NQ (4.76 cm dia.) 
core. Diamond drill hole data contained in the Project database to date includes all 556 drill 
holes with an associated 38,111 sample intervals over a total of 92,742 m of drilling. The Project 
database contains 36,996 assay values each for silver, lead, zinc, and copper. 

 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 1.8

BCM employs standard, basic procedures for both drill core and trench sample collection and 
analysis. Formal chain of custody procedures are maintained during all segments of sample 
transport. Samples prepared for transport to the laboratory are bagged and labelled in a manner 
which prevents tampering, and remain in BCM control until released to private transport carrier 
in Cusco or Juliaca. Upon receipt by the laboratory, samples are tracked by a blind sample 
number assigned and recorded by BCM. The samples are prepped according to ALS-Chemex 
preparation code PREP-31, and silver, lead, zinc, and copper assays are carried out by three-
acid digestion followed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA) analysis. Multi-element 
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis is conducted on select sample intervals to assist with 
mineralization classifications and to guide the interpretation of the metallurgical process 
response. 

BCM maintains an internal Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program which includes 
both standard and check (lab) sampling. GRE conducted a critical review of BCM's QA/QC 
program; toward that end, BCM provided GRE with QA/QC data in multiple Excel spreadsheet 
files. GRE compiled the data into a single, comprehensive QA/QC data worksheet for analysis 
and evaluation. Based on the results of GRE's review, in conjunction with observations and 
conversation with BCM personnel during the QP site visit, BCM's routine sample preparation, 
analytical procedures, and security measures are, in general, considered reasonable and 
adequate to ensure the validity and integrity of the data derived from BCM's sampling programs. 
GRE recommends that BCM expand the existing QA/QC program to include at least standards, 
blanks, and duplicates, and that QA/QC analysis be conducted on an on-going basis, including 
consistent acceptance/rejection tests. Each round of QA/QC analysis should be documented, 
and reports should include a discussion of the results and any corrective actions taken. 

 DATA VERIFICATION 1.9

Data verification efforts included an on-site inspection of the Corani Project and core storage 
facility, check sampling, and manual and mechanical auditing of the Project database.  

During the on-site inspection in August 2017, GRE's (QP) representative conducted general 
geologic field reconnaissance, including inspection of bedrock exposures and other surficial 
geologic features, ground-truthing of reported drill collar and trench sample locations, and 
superficial examination of historic mine workings. One full day of the site visit was spent at the 
core storage facility in Juliaca, where select intervals of whole and half core were visually 
inspected and samples were selected to submit for check assay. Field observations during the 
site visit generally confirm previous reports on the geology of the Project area. Bedrock 
lithologies, alteration types, and significant structural features are all consistent with descriptions 
provided in existing Project reports, and the author did not see any evidence in the field that 
might significantly alter or refute the current interpretation of the local geologic setting.

Specific core intervals from 35 separate drill holes were selected for visual inspection and 
potential check sampling based on a preliminary review of the drill hole logs and associated 
assay values. The core intervals were selected prior to the site visit, and the core was laid out 
by BCM staff and ready for inspection upon arrival. With few exceptions, the core samples 
accurately reflect the lithologies recorded on the logs. A total of 17 samples were selected for 
check assay. The samples were selected from low, moderate, and high-grade intervals based 
on original assay results. In all cases, the degree of visible alteration and evidence of 
mineralization observed was generally consistent with the grade range indicated by the original 
assay value. Laboratory analysis was completed by ALS Peru using the same sample 
preparation and analytical procedures as were used for the original samples. Standard t-Test 
statistical analysis was completed to look for any significant difference between the original and 
check assay population means. The results of the t-Test showed no statistically significant 
difference between the means of the two trials (original versus check assay).  

GRE completed a QAQC audit of the digital Project database by comparing a random selection 
of original assay certificates to the assay information contained in the Corani Project database. 
Results of the QAQC audit indicate a minor and acceptable error rate. GRE also completed a 
mechanical audit of the Project database in order to evaluate the integrity of data from a data 
entry perspective. The mechanical audit identified a small number of data entry errors, including 
gaps, overlaps, and missing sample intervals. All data entry errors were easily rectified, and are 
considered insignificant with regard to potential impact to the mineral resource and mineral 
reserve estimates. The database audit work completed to date indicates that occasional 
inconsistencies and/or erroneous entries are likely inherent or inevitable in the data entry 
process. 

GRE recommends that BCM establish a routine, internal mechanical audit procedure to check 
for overlaps, gaps, total drill hole length inconsistencies, non-numeric assay values, and 
negative numbers. The internal mechanical audit should be carried out after any significant 
update to the database, and the results of each audit, including any corrective actions taken, 
should be documented and stored for future use in database validation. 

 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 1.10

The Corani deposit is a silver-lead-zinc deposit with relatively complex mineralogy. It should be 
noted that no additional metallurgical work has been completed since issuance of the 2015 
Optimized Feasibility Study. The geo-metallurgy recovery equations developed for the 2015 
study were utilized for the current mine planning and scheduling. Upon review of the 
metallurgical testing data, it is clear that performance of Corani mineralization to conventional 
flotation and cyanidation processing was widely variable. The geological classifications provided 
some delineation of metallurgical response: Samples representing the CSC ore type 
consistently responded well to a conventional sequential lead / silver – zinc flotation. 
Conversely, FeOx and MnO responded very poorly to flotation, but generally responded better 
to cyanide leaching for silver. 

The geological classification FBS which represents a large amount of the estimated resource 
tonnage, had a broad range of metallurgical response. The variable response was shown to be 
related to the fine texture of the mineralization and presence of non-sulphide lead mineral 
forms. However, the geological classifications alone were not able to delineate the texture or 
quantity of non-sulphide lead minerals. 

To better predict the metallurgical response, a geo-metallurgy approach was investigated to link 
metallurgical response to block modelling parameters. The statistical analysis indicated several 
key parameters could be used to generate metallurgical response. For the purpose of the 
analysis, the metallurgical process was restricted to only sequential flotation of silver bearing 
lead concentrate followed by the flotation of a zinc concentrate, also containing some silver. 

With metallurgical response linked to block modelling parameters, the mine plan could be 
optimized to maximize the revenue for the Project. The Table 1-1 displays the estimated metal 
recoveries by mine schedule.

 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 1.11

GRE estimated the Mineral Resources for the Corani Project during the first quarter of 2015. No 
new drilling, geology, or metallurgical test work has been performed since then. That work and 
the resulting Mineral Resources were documented and published in the May 30, 2015 Technical 
Report. The 2015 mineral resource block model was used for estimation of the Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves of the Corani Project in the current Corani Project Detailed 
Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) Technical Report. 

The resource model has three main lithologies: basement sediment with minor quantities of 
mineralization, the mineralized (pre-mineral) tuff, and a mostly unmineralized post-mineral tuff 
which is assumed to be barren. Mineralization has been defined by 7 mineralization types, 
which were later grouped into oxidized, transition, and sulphide groups. The Mineral Resources 
for the Corani Project are shown in Table 1-2. The Mineral Resources were generated within 
the $30.00/troy ounce silver, $1.425/lb lead, and $1.50/lb zinc price Whittle pit shell and the 
calculated $11/tonne NSR cut-off.  

Table 1-3 shows the potentially leachable Mineral Resource contained within the Whittle pit 
shell at a 15 g/t cut-off that is available in addition to the Mineral Resource shown in Table 1-2.

 MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES 1.12

The Mineral Reserve Estimate is based on the 2015 GRE resource block model, using updated 
Whittle optimization parameters, new pit designs, and new phase designs. 

The Project Mineral Reserves consider only measured and indicated resource categories, which 
have been converted to proven and probable reserves categories, respectively. Mineral 
Reserves are defined as being the material to be fed to the process plant in the mine plan 
already described, and are demonstrated to be economically viable in the Detailed Design 
Phase 1 (FEED) economic model.

Petroleum (CIM). 

2) The Mineral Reserves have been estimated using the following metal prices: $20.00/oz Ag, $1.00/lb Zn, $0.95/lb Pb 
using a revenue factor 1.00 pit shell as a basis for the pit design. 

3) Only pre-mineral tuff type of material has been considered as reserves. 

4) NSR Cut-off grades used are equal or higher than: $11.11/t for the East Pit, and $11.26/t for Minas and Main pits. 

5) The effective date for these Mineral Reserves is 1 May 2017. 

6) Totals / Averages may not add up due to rounding of individual tonnes and grades. 

7) The tonnes and grades shown above are considered a Mineral Reserve because they have been demonstrated to be 
economically viable through the FEED study financial model using the following metal prices: $18.00/oz Ag, $1.10/lb 
Zn, $0.95/lb Pb. 

 MINING METHODS 1.13

The Corani Project will be mined using conventional open pit mining methods, with either an 
owner mining or a contractor mining scenario. The base case assumes contractor mining. The 
rock will be broken by drilling 0.156-m diameter blast holes and blasting with ANFO and 
emulsion. Broken rock will then be loaded into 130-136 tonne trucks using a 13 m

3
 front end 

loader or one of two 15 m
3
 hydraulic shovels. Support equipment includes two D10 bulldozers, a 

road grader, water trucks, rubber tire dozer, compactor, excavator, fuel and lube trucks, and 
other miscellaneous equipment. 

During a 10-month pre-production stripping, pioneering, haul road construction phase prior to 
plant construction, 4.7 million tonnes of waste rock will be mined to generate construction 
material. Another 7.6 million tonnes will be mined immediately prior to production. The mine is 
designed to generate 7.875 million tonnes of ore per year with strip ratios of 3:1 to 4:1 during 
the first two years, falling to below 2:1 the third year, and then below 1:1 the final 3 years of the 
mine life.

 RECOVERY METHODS 1.14

Corani process plant is designed for a treatment of 7,875,000 tonnes per year of a lead-silver-
zinc ore, considering an availability of 92% and operating 350 days per year. It considers typical 
mining industry areas such as crushing, grinding, flotation, thickening and filtration for tailings 
and final concentrates (Pb/Ag and Zn/Ag). 

The plant design considers the following process areas:  

 Primary Crushing and Coarse Ore Stockpile 

 SAG – Ball Mill 

 Selective Lead and Zinc Flotation 

 Concentrate Thickening and Filtering (Pb, Zn) 

 Tailings Thickening and Filtering Plant 

 Dry Tailings Disposal Plant 

 Reagents and Utilities Areas.  

Figure 1-1 below is a simplified schematic of the process. GMI optimised the process design 
based on the results of several 2009 and 2011 metallurgical testing programs (Blue Coast, 
2011; DJB Consultants, 2011; SGS, 2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2009a, 2009b, and 2010) and new 
metallurgical testwork and analysis for grinding, sedimentation, and filtration in 2014 (Alex G. 
Doll Consulting Ltd., 2014; ALS Metallurgy Kamloops, 2014; Outotec Canada, 2014a; Outotec 
Canada, 2014b) and as a result of different analysis (primary crusher technology, stockpile 
optimisation, tailings filtration plant, waste rock and dry tailings stacking area location, etc.). 

The ore will be crushed in a primary gyratory crusher that is located adjacent to the open pit 
mine and temporarily stored in the coarse ore stockpile. From there it will be conveyed to the 
processing facilities where it will be ground to 80 percent finer than 106 microns in a semi-
autogeneous grinding (SAG) and ball mill circuit.  

The ore is further processed in a flotation circuit consisting of lead flotation followed by zinc 
flotation.  The majority of the silver will be recovered in the lead flotation circuit and some silver 
will also be collected in the zinc flotation circuit.  Lead sulphide will be recovered in a one-pass 
rougher flotation bank, producing a concentrate that will be upgraded to smelter specifications in 
three cleaning stages. Tails from the lead flotation section will then be conditioned for zinc 
sulphide flotation. The process scheme for zinc flotation also includes a rougher bank and three 
stages of cleaning using both mechanical cells and column flotation to produce smelter-grade 
zinc concentrates. For both lead and zinc sections, the rougher flotation concentrates will be 
reground to 80 percent finer than 25 microns prior to cleaner flotation to liberate the sulphides 
for further upgrading. 

Tailings from the lead and zinc flotation circuit will be thickened, filtered and conveyed to a 
stockpile at the plant.  From there, the filtered tailings will be trucked to the Main Waste Dump 
where it will be co-disposed with mine waste during the first eight years of operation. Between 
years 9 and 11, filtered tailings will be disposed of as backfill into the Corani Este pit with 
additional waste rock. From year 12 onwards, the tailings will be again re-disposed at DDMRP 
up to the end of the mining operation. 

Water will be reclaimed from the tailing thickener overflow and from the tailing filtrate. Process 
make-up water will be pumped from the contact water section and fresh water section of the 
Plant Water Supply Pond.   

Lead and zinc concentrates will be thickened, filtered, and transported by trucks to the Port of 
Matarani for ocean shipment to smelters.

 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 1.15

The infrastructure for the Corani Project requires significant development and planning.  The 
site is remote, at high elevation, and a considerable distance from major urban areas.  The 
infrastructure developed for the Project includes transportation, process buildings and related 
facilities, water supply and management, power supply, communications, and material storage 
stockpiles.   

Several Project components were optimized subsequent to the July 2015 Technical Report by 
M3 Engineering (M3 PN 140135, 17 July 2015). Detailed engineering studies, site investigation 
work, and laboratory testing programs were ongoing at the time of the July 2015 report. The 
optimizations were presented in December 2015.   Several significant changes have been made 
in the design approach in order streamline the Project and minimize Capital and Operating 
costs.  The most significant changes have been advanced through additional fieldwork and 
detailed engineering to support the optimization concepts presented in this study.  A summary 
of the infrastructure related work performed subsequent to the 2015 report for the present 2017 
study is presented below: 

1. More precise and geo-referenced topography completed 

2. Soil mechanics studies completed 

3. Bridge and tunnel designs for the main Project access road reviewed and in some cases 
revised 

4. Review and optimization of the overall Project layout 

5. Review and update of Project hydrology and hydrogeology 

6. Evaluation and development of Project accesses 

7. Development of accesses for mine vehicles (Haul Roads)

Transportation 

Transportation to and around the site is by roadways that have been developed and improved 
to accommodate the demands of the Project.  An access road has been designed to link the 
Project site to the Interoceanic Highway that provides access to the town of Macusani and to 
the rest of the country for receiving supplies and delivering products.  The lead and zinc 
concentrate produced by the mining and mineral processing operations will be delivered to the 
Port of Matarani or other destination via trucks using the access road and Peru's public highway 
system.

The current components and arrangement of facilities is described in this section of the Report. 
Several of these Project components are described in more detail in other sections of this 
report, and only a general description of the relevant aspects of the Project infrastructure-
related components is given in this Section. 

Access Road 

The Main Access Road to the Corani Project, as designed by GMI and Anddes Asociados SAC 
(Anddes), will be a new 44 km highway connecting to the existing Interoceanic Highway (34B) 
which is in turn connected through the existing Peruvian highway system to the Port of Matarani, 
632 km. from the Project site.  The Port has facilities for concentrate shipment. The Interoceanic 
Highway is a two-lane, paved highway that connects the Peruvian port cities of Matarani and Ilo.     

Buildings and Facilities 

Corani Project buildings and facilities are divided into four functional areas:  Administration, 
Mine Facilities, Process Facilities, and Residential Facilities.

The administration facilities are located near the main entrance partially because of space 
constraints and partially to keep suppliers and non-essential personnel out of the mining and 
process areas. The administration facilities include the main gate and guard house, an 
administration office building, and a warehouse to receive parts and supplies necessary for 
operation and maintenance.   

 Security 

 Warehouse Building 

 Administration Building 

  Project Water Management 1.15.4

Surface water and groundwater will be used to provide the water required for the Project. 
Surface water (runoff and streamflow) and groundwater (from pit dewatering) will both come 
from the watershed that hosts the Project.  No cross-basin abstractions will be required.  . 
Water on the project is classified as either contact water or non-contact water.   Contact water is 
defined as water that has had contact with any area disturbed by the Project where the water 
quality could be degraded from Acid Rock Drainage (ARD) or other water contaminants. Non-
contact water is defined as water that has not had contact with the Process or any area that has 
been disturbed. Contact water and non-contact water will be managed and conveyed separately.  
They will ultimately be stored in a water storage pond which has two separate compartments, 
one for each circuit. The contact water that has been stored will be consumed as preferential 
process water (make-up) for the plant.  This water cannot be discharged to the environment 
during operations (See Section 20). A portion of the Non-Contact Water stored in the pond will 
be used to satisfy the process water demand once the Contact Water has been exhausted. 
Non-contact Water that is not used will be discharged, if necessary, to the Quebrada 
Chacaconiza.  The Project is required to discharge a fixed quantity of non-contact water 
downstream as part of the Environmental Impact study and ITS (see Section 20).

  Power Supply 1.15.5

A new 138 kV power transmission line is necessary to provide power to the Corani Project. A 
new power substation will connect with Power Transmission Line L-1013 (San Gabán II – San 
Rafael – Azángaro) as the power source.   A new 138 kV power transmission line will be built to 
connect the Antapata substation to the Main Corani substation to be built near the Project's 
main process buildings.  The proposed alignment for the 138kV line was provided by Promotora 
(2015). The transmission line route was selected based on using the route already provided by 
the Project's Mine Access Road.   

  Waste Rock and Tailings Management Facilities 1.15.6

Disposal of mine waste and filtered tailings will be in a common deposit, the size of which has 
been designed for the quantities considered in the mine plan. The height could easily be 
increased to give more capacity in the future if required. The Main Dump and pits are designed 
to minimize and mitigate the formation of ARD.  ARD is a natural process which arises from the 
oxidation of sulfide minerals.  This risk is present in Corani Waste Rock, tailings, and pit walls.  
Section 20 describes the ARD management plan.   

For the main dump, the primary repository for all mine waste, initially, a base platform will be 
constructed using Non-Acid Generating (NAG) waste from the mine pre-stripping stages. 
Filtered tailings and mine waste will be placed in alternating layers, with the waste layers acting 
as conduits to remove water generated through the tailings consolidation process. Vertical 
chimneys of rock will connect each layer to increase effectiveness of the drainage system. 
Drainage water will be directed to a sump located immediately downstream of the deposit. The 
tailings / waste layers will be encapsulated with NAG waste (10m below, 20m on the down-
stream face and 1m on top). Starting in year 9, for 3 to 4 years, a portion of filtered tailings and 
mine waste will be used to backfill the East pit. Following completion of mining, as part of the 
closure plan, approximately 24Mt of waste and tailings will be re-handled from the top of the 
Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit to backfill Minas and Main Pits to the current 
level of the wetlands.  

 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACT 1.16

Penfold Limited conducted a review of the lead and zinc concentrate markets, smelting charges, 
penalties, concentrate handling, and land and ocean transportation costs. The supplied 
information was used as a guide to develop all associated payments and expenses associated 
with the sale of Corani concentrates. There are no letters of intent or sale agreements in place. 
All information is based on Penfold's experience for similar concentrates. 

 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 1.17
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

The main environmental approval required in order to begin mining activities is an 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA).  In 2013, the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines approved the ESIA based on the Feasibility Study prepared in 2011. The Closure Plan 
was approved in April, 2015. In 2016, the Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the 
modification of the ESIA based on the Optimized and Final Feasibility Study prepared by 2015.  

The design and operating improvements incorporated in this Technical Report are expected to 
require only a modification of the existing approved ESIA, without the necessity for additional 
public hearings, as they are entirely located within the previously approved project footprint. 
Furthermore, as the environmental impact of the proposed Corani operation has been reduced 
as a result of the modifications described within this report and the Company anticipates final 
permitting timelines will shorten and costs will be lower than previously anticipated. 

Bear Creek's plans for the Corani project are to focus on preparing for development of the 
project starting with the preparation and submission of an amended ESIA in the third quarter of 
2017.

The community consultation undertaken with the Chacaconiza and Quelcaya communities to 
date has included a proposal for mining employment, generating widespread acceptance, 
mainly among younger community members, the teachers at local educational facilities, and 
community leaders. The current labor force is generally unskilled, mainly working on highway 
remediation and maintenance. A technical training program is planned to develop the skills of 
community members to fulfil employment requirements of the Project. 

Additionally, Bear Creek completed a Life of Mine ("LOM") Investment Agreement in June 2013.  
This agreement was entered into with the District of Corani, five surrounding communities, and 
relevant, ancillary organizations specifying investment commitments over the 23 year project 
life, including the preproduction period.  Under the agreement, annual payments are to be made 
into a trust designed to fund community projects totaling 4 million nuevos soles per year 
(approximately $1.6 million per year), beginning with the first installments payable in 2013. 
Payments will remain constant throughout the pre-development phase and during production.  
Cessation or interruptions of operations will cause a pro-rata decrease in the annual 
disbursements.  As an integral part of the LOM agreement, a trust or foundation structure is 
established for approval of investments and disbursement of funds.

 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 1.19

The economic analysis was performed using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) which is a 
standard industry practice. The key assumptions used for the study are shown in Table 1-8 and 
establish a "Base Case." The table provided the life-of-project averages for grade recovery and 
these values vary over the life of the project depending on the head grades and split between 
mixed sulfide ore and transition ore. 

Table 1-8: Key Assumptions for the Corani Project – Base Case  

Annual ore production – years 1 to end of life (ktonnes) 7,875 

Overall process recovery – silver – into both lead and zinc cons 69.9% 

Overall process recovery – lead – into lead cons 61.1% 

Overall process recovery – zinc – into zinc cons 67.1% 

Total processed ktonnes 139,073 

Average silver grade (g/t) 50.3 g/t 

Average lead grade (%) 0.90% 

Average zinc grade (%) 0.59% 

Payable ounces of silver net of smelter payment terms (total) 144 million 

Payable pounds of lead net of smelter payment terms (total) 1.59 billion 

Payable pounds of zinc net of smelter payment terms (total) 1.03 billion 

Overall stripping ratio  1.49 to 1 

Life-of-Mine years 18 

The results of the economic analysis for the Project indicate an after-tax internal rate of return 
(IRR) of 15.1% and net present value (NPV) of $404.5 million at a 5% discount rate based on 
metal prices of $18.00 per ounce silver, $0.95 per pound for lead, and $1.10 per pound zinc. 

 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 1.20

There are no adjacent mineral properties which might materially affect the interpretation or 
evaluation of the mineralization or exploration targets of the Corani Project. 

 OTHER RELEVANT DATA AND INFORMATION 1.21

Bear Creek and GMI have created a Project Execution Plan and have conducted a Hazard and 
Operability study, creating a project development pathway designed to minimize risk and 
uncertainty, manage construction performance and schedule, to deliver the Project on budget.   

The Project is planned to be constructed over a three year time span with engineering 
continuing through 2017, access road, plant equipment procurement and fabrication beginning 
the first quarter of 2018.  Commissioning and start up is scheduled for the first quarter of 2021.

 Permitting – 16 months 

 Major Offsite Contracts (Camp, Power Line, Access Road) – 14 months 

 Mine Construction/Pre-stripping – 12 months 

 Plant Construction – 21 months 

 Commissioning and Start-Up – 6 months 

The total time from receiving financing to start-up is estimated to be approximately 36 months. 

The critical path method should be applied to develop the execution schedule and Primavera P6 
software. 

 Project Management 1.21.3

An experienced EPC company would be selected to develop the Project. This company would 
develop and implement the Project Procedures Manual that would include the following 
information: 

 Project Management Plan; 

 Engineering Management Plan; 

 Procurement Plan; 

 Logistics and Transportation Plan; 

 Construction Plan; 

 Commissioning and Startup Plan; 

 Quality Assurance Plan; 

 Environmental, Health and Safety Plan; 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 18 

 Communication Plan; 

 Project Controls Plan; 

 Project Schedule; and 

 Project Close-Out Plan. 

 Engineering 1.21.4

An Engineering Management Plan should be applied which outlines the procedures and tools 
which would be used to effectively manage the design. 

The Project engineering would be developed in two-phases: 

 Integration Engineering phase that would confirm and integrate the engineering packages 
and initiate the procurement of long-lead equipment items, 

 Phase 2 Detailed Engineering phase that would be carried out by a leading engineering and 
construction company following the completion of the Phase 1 Detailed Engineering. As 
detail engineering designs and quantity take-offs are completed these would be transferred 
to the procurement and contracts groups for purchase and contracting and to the 
construction team at the Project site. 

The Detailed Engineering work would be developed by an EPC/EPCM company. Some design 
packages, such as roads and power supply could be executed by a Peruvian company. 

 Procurement and Contracting 1.21.5

Due to the location and altitude of the site, pre-fabrication and skid-mounted packages would be 
considered to the greatest extent possible. Pre-fabricated modules would be equipped with 
piping and valves, wiring and instrumentation to reduce onsite labour. 

Sourcing of the majority of equipment and materials is expected to be from USA, Canada, 
Europe, Chile and China. Some major and minor mechanical equipment and material would be 
procured from Peruvian suppliers such as platework and steel structure. 

Working with the Project construction management team a detailed contracting plan indicating 
scope breakdown and contract type will be developed during the Project detail engineering 
phase. 

 Construction 1.21.6

A Construction Management Plan should be applied which defines the standard processes that 
must be used to construct the Corani Project in a controlled and efficient manner. 

The Project scope will be divided into manageable work areas to facilitate a controlled work flow 
and smooth handover from construction to commissioning through to production. 

The Project construction team is responsible for the delivery of the works in accordance with the 
agreed scope of work and the Project schedule. 

Specific timing for all engineering work packages and construction ERFP packages would be 
included in the Project master schedule. 

 Commissioning and Startup 1.21.7

A Commissioning Management Plan will be applied which defines the standard processes that 
must be used to commission the Corani Project in a controlled and efficient manner. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 19 

Commissioning includes those activities necessary for an effective transition between 
construction and mechanical completion when systems are turned over to the commissioning 
and start-up team. These activities include the following: 

 Ensure that equipment is operationally ready for start-up (i.e. to accept feed); 

 Sequence starting and running of tested logical groups of equipment; 

 Wet and dry runs of systems; 

 Demonstration of the suitability of the facilities to be ready for processing and production; 
and 

 Coordinate with and assist the owner to achieve hand over of the completed facilities. 

The commissioning and start up team is planned to be an integrated organization of plant 
operators, contractors and suppliers. 

 RECOMMENDATIONS 1.22

The recommendations provided below address areas that require more complete definition to 
inform and optimize the detailed engineering design.   

 Geotechnical 1.22.1

A monitoring plan, monitoring instrument alert levels and operation and contingency manual, 
should be developed for the whole mine facilities. A best industry practice should be applied in 
the development of those documents, mainly for the critical components. Those documents and 
manuals will support the routine operation and will produce a safe environment. 

A group of specialists, including geotechnical, hydrologist and mechanical engineers, should 
carry out Annual Safety Reviews of the whole facilities, taking into consideration the Canadian 
Dam Association guidelines. The Safety Report should update the monitoring plan, operation 
and contingency manual, stability condition, water management, critical equipment operation of 
each mine facility and provide action lists for improving the functioning of them. Regardless the 
Annual Safety Review, all the facilities will have to be inspected after the occurrence of an 
extreme storm or earthquake event. 

Due to the geotechnical characteristics of the Plant Water Pond foundation, a good quality 
control and quality assurance program should be implemented during construction, including 
geoelectrical surveying for verifying potential geomembrane defects which produce leaks. 

Additional geotechnical drilling should be completed within the planned pit. This will confirm the 
current pit slope design basis and potentially allow an increase in the pit slope angles. The pit 
will intersect the unconsolidated sediments lining the floor of the upper bofedal and lower 
bofedal areas. Additional drilling, testing, and analyses are required to design the pit slopes 
within the bofedal soils and to develop a detailed plan for dewatering and mining the bofedal soil 
material. This will involve drilling several boreholes through the unconsolidated sediments, with 
production of detailed stratigraphic logs and undisturbed sampling for density and strength 
testing of the unconsolidated material. Boreholes would be completed as monitoring wells, and 
multiple-well aquifer testing will be performed to better assess the dewatering requirements for 
the material. 

 Process Plant Design 1.22.2

During the initial stages of the next design phase, the process plant design should be optimised 
considering the last mining plan. 

Confirm the burden and spacing of blasting in order to reduce the stationary grizzly oversize (1 
m opening) and the rock breaker duty. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED)

It is recommended to optimise the feed and discharge primary crusher bins capacities in order 
to adjust to the haul trucksize chosen. 

Also it should be evaluated from the environmental point of view if a cover for the coarse ore 
stockpile is required. 

Further work will be required during detailed design on the pebbles handling system, once more 
data is obtained on their effects on SAG mill operation. 

It is suggested to incorporate metallurgical samplers in lead and zinc flotation feed circuits and 
both final concentrates and tailings in order to be able to realize auditable mass balances for 
silver, lead and zinc. 

Also it is recommended to carry out new tests using SFR flotation cells, with the purpose of 
reducing the amount of penalty elements (As, Sb, clays) and maximising the silver recovery in 
the lead concentrate. 

It is unknown the effect that the water recirculation will have on the lead flotation efficiency, 
therefore, with the aim of guaranteeing appropriated lead and silver recovery it is suggested to 
use two independent process water circuits for lead and zinc. This could mean a reduction in 
reagents consumption, thus saving operating costs for the process plant. 

It is also suggested to incorporate into the process plant design the in-line addition of hydrogen 
peroxide and activated carbon. 

For pH control of the recirculated water it may be required to design a system for sulphuric acid 
addition and adjust the pH prior to lead flotation. 

Finally, it is recommended to carry out a dynamic simulation in order to detect possible bottle 
necks and optimise the design of the plant. This should be done during the initial stages of the 
next design phase. 

 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact  1.22.3

In 2016, the Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the modification of the ESIA based on the 
Optimized and Final Feasibility Study prepared by 2015.However, It is recommended that Bear 
Creek commence the permitting process on water rights and mine plan approval, both of which 
are critical, early-stage permits. Bear Creek is also encouraged to utilize all efforts in 
maintaining its social license and ensuring the continued strong support from local communities, 
local and regional governments, and the central Peruvian government. 

Additional evaluation is required on the water balance.  The main dump seepage model and the 
pit dewatering model both require a higher level of rigor to achieve the level of "detailed design".  
Once these studies are complete, the water balance will require revision.  However, the water 
balance is robust (see Section 20) and few complications are foreseen.   

 Capital and Operating Cost 1.22.4

It may be possible to reduce the cost of delivering tailings to the Main Dump and pit backfill 
disposal sites by varying the proportion of tailings delivered by conveyor systems and by trucks 
during the period when tailings are being produced. It is recommended that an optimization 
study be carried out to determine this, and a detailed plan should be devised. Tailings will be 
co-disposed with waste rock in the Main Dump and pit backfills. In general, it is expected that it 
will be cheaper to use conveyors instead of trucks to deliver tailings to ultimate disposal 
destinations, but exclusive use of conveyors may be less practical for tailings destined for the pit 
backfill. During the period when pit backfilling will be taking place, the current schedule indicates 
that truck capacity will be available; therefore, an optimization study should specify the ideal mix 
of conveyor/truck transport of tailings over time, depending partly on truck availability.

A study should be conducted to match operating equipment to the high-altitude conditions, 
potentially identifying equipment outfitted with pressurized cabs and other worker comfort and 
performance additions. Caterpillar equipment offers high-altitude arrangements (HAA), and 
these modifications allow their power ratings to be valid to 4,877 m. 

 Risks 1.23

The following risks have been identified: 

 The high altitude of the site may have a greater-than-expected negative impact on worker 
productivity. 

 The high altitude of the site may result in greater-than-expected impacts on the function and 
capacity of diesel-powered equipment and electrical components. 

 As with any large-scale mine development, there is a risk that additional capital may be 
difficult to raise in the event that costs increase during the pre-production period. 

 A currency exchange risk exists.  While a weakening of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol (PEN) would 
lower the cost of in-country expenses, conversely, strengthen of the PEN would increase 
local cost. 

 Although local communities have generally supported the Project development, there is a 
risk that sentiments could change, or that special interest groups from outside the community 
could mobilize opposition to the Project. 

 During operations, a potential silver migration from the lead flotation circuit to zinc flotation 
circuit must be evaluated with additional metallurgical test.  

 Opportunities 1.24

The following opportunities have been identified: 

 It may be possible to improve metal recoveries by optimizing flotation work. Testing under 
optimized conditions could increase recovery over that predicted by the geometallurgical 
model. 

 Data generated during additional geotechnical drilling may show that it is feasible to steepen 
pit slopes. 

 It may be possible to improve concentrate grades and increase the net smelter return. 

 Operating cost improvements may be obtained from using conveyor systems to transport 
tailings to the disposal sites. 

 Complete further test work to optimise the recovery of Silver in the Lead Flotation Circuit, 
potentially increasing the Project revenue. 

 Optimise the plant design by developing a dynamic simulation model. 

 Gold Zone: The Gold Zone is an advanced exploration target on the Corani Property. To 
advance the Gold Zone target, additional metallurgical test work should be undertaken to 
identify an appropriate recovery method so that capital and operating costs can be 
developed for a recovery plant. When a recovery strategy is determined, a mineral resource 
should be estimated for this area so that scoping level studies can be undertaken to evaluate 
the Gold Zone's economic potential.

2 Introduction 

Bear Creek Mining Corporation is a leading Peru-focused silver exploration and development 
company listed as BCM on TSX Venture and BCEKF on OTC.  They are focused on developing 
their Corani Project located in the Department of Puno in southern Peru. 

 Purpose 2.1

Bear Creek Mining Corporation (BCM) has requested Sedgman to coordinate the update of the 
technical report National Instrument 43-101, developed in 2015 by M3.  Between December 
2016 and July 2017 GMI developed the "Phase I - Detail Engineering" of the Corani Project, 
which was based mainly on the Feasibility Study Updated in 2015 by M3 Engineering & 
Technology Corp. (M3). Based on the above, this report was prepared in accordance with 
"Form 43-101F1, Technical Report" of the Canadian Securities Administrators National 
Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). 

The Project includes crushing, grinding and flotation of mixed sulphides, and transitional ores, 
for proven and probable Mineral Reserves containing 139 million tonnes of ore having a Life-of-
Mine average grade of 50.3 grams per tonne of silver, 0.90% lead, and 0.59% zinc, containing, 
225 million ounces of silver, 2.7 billion pounds of lead and 1.8 billion pounds of zinc over a 
period of 18 years of mining. 

The completed engineering (FEED) by BCM is the first step to advance with the engineering 
details of the Project in order to confirm the estimation of investment, add value to the designs 
proposed by the feasibility engineering, and develop new or with more detailed engineering for: 

 Optimization of the new mining plan 

 Review of metallurgical test work of Project 

 Geo referenced topography and greater precision 

 Studies of Soil Mechanics 

 Review of bridge and tunnel design in the Main Project Access 

 Review and update of hydrology of the Project 

 Development of designs for tailings filter area,  

 Development of access for mine vehicles (Haul Roads)  

 Trade off development between Jaw Crusher and Gyratory crusher 

 Trade off development of transport between conveyor and truck mine 

 Update local construction cost 

 Get offers for the top teams and select the top suppliers. 

 Development of designs which allow for confirmation of quantities for items with high cost 
incidence 

 Update of Capex and Operating Cost with precision range of (±15%)   

 Update of the Project Development Schedule and Project Execution Plan  

The reserves of the present study are practically the same as the reserves described in report 
NI 43-101 (M3 Engineering, 2015). The reserve tonnage is 1% higher in the Study and the silver 
and lead metal is 1% lower, and zinc metal is approximately 1.4% higher.  

During the pre-strip period, 99.8% of the waste to be removed will be NAG, and will be used to 
construct initial mine haul roads, the primary crusher platform and the base of the Main Mine 
Waste and filtered tailings.

 Mineral Tenure 4.2

 Summary 4.2.1

The land status of the Project is a series of twelve mineral claims or concessions. Mineral 
concessions in Peru are filed with the Instituto Nacional de Concesiones y Catastro Minera 
(INACC) which is part of the Ministerio de Energía y Minas in Peru (MINEM). Claims can vary in 
size from 100 to 1,000 ha. They are rectangular geometries parallel to the UTM grid system 
employed in the district.  The Corani Project is located in the district of Corani, province of 
Carabaya department of Puno, in Peru, and covers an aggregate extent of 5,180.1213 
hectares. 

 Purchase Agreements 4.2.2

On March 15, 2007, the Company (BCM or "Bear Creek") and Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration 
Ltd. ("Rio Tinto") executed a definitive option and shareholders' agreement (the "Option 
Agreement") in respect of the Corani Property.  The Option Agreement formally defines and 
confirms the terms as set out in the Letter of Understanding signed between the parties on 
January 19, 2005.  Refer also to "Mineral Projects – Corani Silver-Zinc-Lead Property." 

On January 15, 2008, the Company made the final US$3 million payment to Rio Tinto under the 
Option Agreement, resulting in the Company owning 70% of the Corani Property, subject to 
certain success payments, purchase rights provisions, and claw-back rights as previously 
disclosed.  Under the terms of the Option Agreement, upon Bear Creek earning its 70% interest, 
the parties were required, within 100 days of January 15, 2008, to enter into a joint venture 
agreement, with Rio Tinto having a 30% interest, and dilution provisions for each party which 
conform to industry practices. 

On March 6, 2008, Bear Creek entered into an agreement (the "Purchase and Sale 
Agreement") with Rio Tinto, which was subsequently amended, as described below, to 
purchase Rio Tinto's remaining 30% interest in the Corani Project and extinguish all of Bear 
Creek's future payment obligations, royalties, and Rio Tinto's back-in rights under the Option 
Agreement.  Bear Creek agreed to pay Rio Tinto US$45 million and to issue Rio Tinto 
3,871,000 common shares as follows:  (i) 3,871,000 Bear Creek common shares which were 
issued on July 16, 2008; (ii) US$5 million in cash payable by December 31, 2008; (iii) US$15 
million in cash payable by the earlier of December 31, 2008 or 15 business days following a 
change of control of the Company; and (iv) US$25.0 million in cash payable on the earlier of 
December 31, 2009 or 180 days following a change of control of Bear Creek. 

On July 17, 2008, the Company amended the terms of the Purchase And Sale Agreement and 
agreed to issue an additional 120,000 common shares to Rio Tinto, in consideration for which 
Rio Tinto extended US$15 million of the US$20 million cash payment which has been required 
to be made under the Purchase And Sale Agreement by the earlier of December 31, 2008 and 
15 business days following a change of control of the Company, to the earlier of September 30, 
2009 and 90 days following a change of control of the Company.  This increased the number of 
common shares issuable to a total of 3,991,000 shares.   

On February 27, 2009, the Company entered into an amendment agreement (the "Amendment 
Agreement") with Rio Tinto with respect to its purchase of Rio Tinto's remaining 30% interest in 
the Corani Project. Under the Amendment Agreement, Rio Tinto agreed to restructure the final 
two cash payments of US$15 million previously due on September 30, 2009 and US$25 million 
previously due on the earlier of December 31, 2009 or 180 days following a change of control of 
Bear Creek.  In consideration for deferring the majority of these payments out several years, the 
purchase price increased from US$75 million to US$77.2 million, representing an increase of 
US$2.2 million, of which US$36.1 million had been already paid in shares or cash.  The 
restructured remaining payments were then: 

 US$10 million due 30 September 2011 

 US$15 million due 30 June 2012. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 33 

Bear Creek agreed to make the following additional payments in consideration for the 
restructuring payable in either cash or shares, at the option of Bear Creek: 

 US$1.1 million upon signing of the Amendment Agreement or as soon thereafter as TSX-V 
acceptance was received, which was paid on March 11, 2009 by the issuance of 1,021,266 
shares of Bear Creek 

 US$1.1 million cash, which was paid on January 10, 2011. 

Additionally, the Amendment Agreement immediately removed the accelerated payment 
condition upon change of control of Bear Creek.  The Amendment Agreement also provided for 
the reduction of the security against the balance of the payments, to security charging only the 
Corani Property upon completion of US$10 million.   

On February 3, 2011, the Company entered into an additional amendment agreement (the 
"2011 Amendment Agreement") whereby Rio Tinto agreed to accept a final payment of 
US$23 million in lieu of and in full satisfaction of the remaining two cash payments of US$10 
million due on September 30, 2011 and US$15 million due on June 30, 2012.  Accordingly, the 
Company has paid the entire obligation for its 100% interest in the Corani project early and 
received a discount of 8% of the balance of the required payments for doing so. 

This final payment extinguished all security interests, share pledges and other encumbrances 
that Rio Tinto held over the Corani Project and Company's other assets. Copies of the 
Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Amendment Agreement and the 2011 Amendment 
Agreement may be obtained under the Company's profile on the SEDAR website 
(www.sedar.com). 

 Property Identification 4.2.3

BCM contracted Grau Abogados in Lima Perú to provide a legal opinion regarding the standing 
of the twelve (12) mineral concessions controlled by the company in 2011 and 2015. According 
to Estudio Grau (2015), BCM and its subsidiaries own 100% of the title to the twelve (12) 
mineral concessions comprising the Corani Project, listed in Table 4-1.  Control and current 
status were verified in August 2017 through an electronic database search of the Geologic 
Mining and Metallurgical Institute (INGEMMET).  All concessions are in good standing.

 Maintenance Obligations 4.2.4

According to the Estudio Grau (2015): 

The twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Corani Project are subject to compliance 
with payment of annual license fees in the amount of US$3.00 per hectare (ha) ("License 
Fees"). 

The mineral concessions comprising the Corani Project are also subject to compliance with 
either of the following alternative obligations: minimum required levels of annual production of at 
least US$100 per ha in gross sales ("Minimum Production"); or payment of an additional amount 
referred as Penalty of US$6.00 per ha for the 7th through 11th year following the granting of the 
concession, and of US$20.00 per ha thereafter; or exploration expenditures of 10 times the 
Penalty. Compliance with one of these three maintenance obligations, together with timely 
payment of License Fees, is required to them in good standing. Failure to comply with License 
Fee payments or Penalty payments for two consecutive years causes the forfeiture of the 
mineral concessions. 

In the year 2018, the twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Corani Project shall be 
subject to the obligations of Minimum Production, Penalties and exploration expenditures in 
accordance with the maintenance regime in force as of October 2008 whereby: 

i. The minimum production will be equivalent to one Tax Unit per year (approximately U.S. 
$1,333.00) per ha granted for metallic minerals, and 10% of one Tax Unit per year per ha 
granted for non-metallic minerals ("Minimum Production"). 

ii. Failure to attain Minimum Production will trigger the obligation to pay a penalty equivalent 
to 10% of the Minimum Production per year per ha, until the year in which the Minimum 
Production is attained. 

iii. Year 2028 shall be the maximum deadline for the mineral concessions comprising the 
Corani Project to attain Minimum Production. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of 
these mineral concessions. 

The twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Corani Project are part of an Administrative 
Economic Unit under the name of Corani ("UEA Corani") duly approved by Geologic Mining and 
Metallurgic Institute - INGEMMET as the competent governmental agency. Bear Creek is 
authorized to comply with its maintenance and reporting obligations to the Peruvian State, 
applicable to the Corani Project through the UEA Corani. This includes the right to report 
exploration expenditures incurred in one or more mineral concessions to the benefit of the UEA 
Corani as a whole. 

Table 4-2 shows the projected annual amounts for each of the alternative maintenance 
obligations to keep the Corani Project in good standing from 2012 through 2016.  BCM has 
completed all required payments for all mineral concessions in 2017.

 Legal Standing 4.2.5

According to Estudio Grau (2015),  

(a) The twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Corani Project are valid and in good 
standing. Ownership and current status were verified in August 2017 through an electronic 
database search through INGEMMET. 

(b) They were validly applied for and granted title to concession by the competent 
governmental authority. 

(c) Each of the twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Corani Project is designated 
metallic as a mineral concession and allows its titleholder or lessee the exclusive right to 
explore and exploit all metallic minerals located within their internal boundaries. These 
mineral concessions are separate from the surface right. 

(d) The mineral concessions comprising the Corani Project have been granted to the 
titleholders for an indefinite period of time, provided that maintenance obligations, including 
license fee payments, minimum production, investment and/or payment of applicable 
penalties are attained when due. The year 2028 is the current legal absolute limit as to 
when production needs to occur with respect to the mineral concession comprising the 
Corani Project; failure to do so will cause their termination or expiry.  The mineral 
concessions comprising the Corani Project will therefore remain valid through the maximum 
legal deadline to be put into production as long as the titleholder or lessee continues 
complying with annual license fee payments, qualified investments, and/or applicable 
penalties. 

(e) Exercise of the rights derived from the twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the 
Corani Project, including the right to explore, develop and further exploit, on an exclusive 
basis only the designated minerals within the internal boundaries of the mineral concession, 
is subject to the awarding of the required permits, authorizations and approvals, including 
relevant surface lands. 

 Surface Rights 4.3

BCM controls the surface rights that cover the entire project area including the open pit, waste 
dump, process plant, water ponds, camp, and ancillary facilities required for operation.  Surface 
rights total 2,424 hectares. 

 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 38 

  Environmental Liabilities 4.4

Historical mining activities have been carried out in the vicinity of the proposed mine and 
associated facilities. The history of the Project site including ownership and any known mineral 
exploration and production are described in Section 6 of this report.  

In accordance with Peruvian Law 28271, generators of environmental liabilities are responsible 
for remediation activities. Therefore, if historical environmental liabilities are defined, 
responsibility for these lies with the generator; however, BCM can assume responsibility for 
them in order to expedite the development of the site. 

In December 2010, Walsh Environmental (Walsh) undertook an environmental-liabilities study in 
order to declare to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MINEM) the existence of liabilities left from 
previous mining activities. These previous mining activities have left excavations, stopes, test 
pits, and mine portals on the site. During the study site visit, the location of each liability (either 
previously known or discovered during the study) was inventoried and registered with the 
MINEM. A total of 141 liabilities were recorded; however, it is possible there are others. A 
number of the environmental liabilities are located within the boundaries of proposed project 
components; therefore, in order for ground-breaking and or development activities to occur, 
BCM will need to assume responsibility for these.  

Environmental liabilities associated with development of the property (past and future) are 
managed through an Environmental Closure Plan or Plans.  Environmental Liabilities Closure 
Plan or Plans were approved by the Peruvian Government in April 2015 and must be reviewed 
within three years following the Peruvian legislation. 

 Permitting 4.5

BCM obtained the permits required for the previous field exploration activities and have 
identified the permits required for the construction, exploitation, and closure phases. An outline 
of the national, territorial, and municipal legislation, and the associated approvals and permits 
which apply to the Project, has been compiled and is provided in the Permitting Handbook for 
the Project (Vector, 2009d). It is considered that there has not been any material change in the 
permit requirements, notwithstanding some changes to the Project description. Table 4-3 
presents a summary of the permits required.

 Water Supply 4.6

The updated water balance and water model prepared will be used to prepare a technical 
document required to obtain the authorization and permit from the Water National Authority 
(ANA), designated approving authority. This is the regular procedure in Peru.   

 Environmental and Permitting  4.7

The main environmental approval required in order to begin mining activities is an 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA).  In 2013, the Ministry of Energy and 
Mines approved the ESIA based on the Feasibility Study prepared in 2011. The Closure Plan 
was approved in April, 2015. 

The design and operating improvements incorporated in this Technical Report are expected to 
require only a modification of the existing approved ESIA, without the necessity for additional 
public hearings, as they are entirely located within the previously approved Project footprint. 
Furthermore, the environmental impact of the proposed Corani operation has been reduced as 
a result of the modifications described within this report, and the Company anticipates final 
permitting timelines will shorten and costs will be lower than previously anticipated. 

Bear Creek's plans for the Corani Project are to focus on preparing for development of the 
Project starting with the preparation and submission of an amended ESIA in the third quarter of 
2017.

5 Accessibility, Climate, Local Resources, 
Infrastructure and Physiography 

 Accessibility 5.1

Existing access to the Project site is primarily by road from the town of Macusani (located on the 
paved dual lane Interoceanic Highway), which is more readily accessible from the town of 
Juliaca, also serviced by commercial airlines from Lima. This route typically takes 4.5 to 5 hours 
and is also indicated on Figure 5-1. From Juliaca, the route generally aligns north towards the 
city of Azángaro on the paved Interoceanic Highway. The Interoceanic highway extends 
approximately 180 km between Azángaro and Macusani. At Macusani, the route extends west 
and northwest for approximately 60 km to the mine site on improved gravel roads. 

Figure 5-1: Map of Existing Access to the Project 

 
 

There are other access routes to the site from Cusco, taking approximately 6 hours by vehicle 
on increasingly primitive roads approaching the site. The access route is shown in Figure 5-1 
and passes through Sicuani and the town of Santa Rosa, which is located approximately 208 
km southeast of Cusco on a good paved road. From there, the route extends approximately 33 
km northeast on improved gravel roads to the village of Nuñoa, and continues northeast for 
around 27 km on a less improved gravel road to the small village of Huaycho. From Huaycho, 
the access route continues north on an unimproved gravel road for approximately 70 km and 
ascends a mountain pass to the Project site. The City of Cusco is also serviced by commercial 
airlines from Lima.

 Local Resources and Existing Infrastructure 5.2

 General 5.2.1

The nearest town of significant size and with significant infrastructure is Macusani, which is the 
capital of the Province of Carabaya in the Region of Puno. Macusani is approximately 30 km 
east of the Project in a direct line. The access road from Huiquisa Bridge to the Permanent 
Camp will be improved. The length of the proposed Mine Access Road connecting the process 
Plant to Macusani is anticipated to be approximately 64 km. 

Macusani has a total area of approximately 1,030 km
2
 (no data was found specific to the urban 

area), and its economy is based mainly on agriculture and transportation of agricultural 
products. 

Infrastructure in the town of Macusani includes a national highway - the Interoceanic Highway - 
currently complete from the Peruvian Port of Matarani to the town of Macusani. Other paved 
and unpaved roads, trails and footpaths allow access to most areas of the municipality. 

The Project site is located in the district of Corani, also in the Province of Carabaya. The closely 
orientated campesino communities of Chacaconiza and Quelcaya, which have a joint population 
of approximately 200 families (80 and 120 families, respectively), will be directly impacted by 
the mine development in terms of landholding, rights to water, employment, etc. 

Chacaconiza and Quelcaya are communities that maintain a fragile, high altitude economy. 
Both communities are below the poverty line with few resources for economic and social 
development. The main economic activity in these communities is the raising of alpacas. 
Approximately 90% of their economy is dependent on this activity, which is augmented to a very 
marginal degree by trading and seasonal migration. 

 Available Labor Force 5.2.2

The community consultation undertaken with the Chacaconiza and Quelcaya communities to 
date has included a proposal for mining employment, generating widespread acceptance, 
mainly among younger community members, the teachers at local educational facilities, and 
community leaders. The current labor force is generally unskilled, mainly working on highway 
remediation and maintenance. A technical training program is planned to develop the skills of 
community members to fulfill employment requirements of the Project, which will include 
agreements with universities and institutes to improve the local population's vocational skill 
levels. The training program will include a system of scholarships that will allow the most 
successful students to occupy positions of greater responsibility on the Project. The training 
program has been designed to be conducted over a 5-year period. After this, BCM will continue 
to support the training program. 

Mining and services related training will be segmented by age group, to allow older people to be 
trained for simpler tasks, while younger people will have access to jobs that demand more 
knowledge and specialization, such as the operation and maintenance of heavy machinery, 
woodworking and electrical work. 

The Project's requirement for labor will exceed the labor resources available in the Chacaconiza 
and Quelcaya communities. A ranking system will be developed with regard to geographical 
location of employment applicants, together with categorization and quantification of the labor 
force required.

 Power 5.2.3

The National Interconnected Electric System (SEIN) is the source of power supply for the 
Project. The San Gabán II Hydroelectric Power Station is located on the San Gabán River, 
some 260 km north-west of the city of Puno and 100 km east of Cusco. The 138-kV power 
transmission line that connects the Hydroelectric Power Station of San Gabán II (CH San 
Gabán II) with the SEIN at the Azángaro Substation (SE Azángaro), passes through the 
neighboring areas of the Project, near the town of Macusani. Therefore, the Project's 
recommended access to power supply is from the SEIN, connected to this transmission line. 

The main facilities that have a direct impact on the Project are described below, and are 
represented schematically in Figure 5-2. 

Figure 5-2: Existing Facilities Schematic 

 

San Gabán II Hydroelectric Power Station 

This hydroelectric power station is owned by Empresa de Generación Eléctrica San Gabán, 
(EGESG), a state-owned company in charge of the operation of the plant's facilities since the 
end of its construction in the year 2000. The plant's characteristics are the following: 

 Number of units : 2 

 Power (each) : 54MW 

 Energy (annual average) : 800GWh

138 kV transmission line CH San Gabán 2 – Substation Azángaro 

The energy produced by the hydroelectric power station is delivered to the SEIN at the 
Substation Azángaro. The characteristics of this transmission line are the following: 

 Number of circuits: 2 

 Denomination of the circuits: 

‒ L-1010 (first circuit) 

‒ L-1013 and L-1009 (second circuit) 

 Tension: 138 kV 

 Length: 159.3 km 

 Capacity by circuit: 120 MVA 

Azángaro Substation 

The Azángaro substation is a state-owned substation, granted in concession to Red Eléctrica 
del Perú (REP). It is part of the southern transmission ring and has a three-winding transformer 
with a capacity of 12/12/5 MVA and voltage of 138/60/22.9 kV. The Substation San Rafael is 
also connected from this substation through a 60-kV transmission line, which is out of service at 
the time of this writing. 

Southern Transmission Ring 

The Peruvian Southern Transmission Ring interconnects the cities of Azángaro, Juliaca, Puno, 
Moquegua, Arequipa, Tintaya and Ayaviri. The Southern Transmission Ring is represented in 
Figure 5-3. At the Socabaya Substation of Arequipa city, the southern ring gets interconnected 
with the electrical system of the center-north, integrating the National Interconnected Electric 
System (SEIN). The lines between Puno, Azángaro, Tintaya and Arequipa are 138kV and the 
lines between Puno, Moquegua and Arequipa are 220 kV.

 Water 5.2.4

Surface water in the region is typically taken for farming and livestock watering, as well as 
essential human needs, such as a drinking and bathing. Surface water and water from springs 
and marshlands is collected in catchments in the communities of Chacaconiza and Quelcaya 
and is distributed to basic water supply systems which conduct water to distribution points 
located in public squares of each respective community. 

Nearby the Project site, hydraulic works related to irrigation or water storage were not observed. 
It was noted that local inhabitants have constructed handmade canals to irrigate pastoral areas, 
although the structures are considered temporary and many have been abandoned depending 
on irrigation requirements. 

 Climate 5.3

The Corani Project metrological station is located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site. Six 
years of data are available since the station was commissioned in December 2008. 

The climate at the Project site is characterized by an estimated average annual precipitation of 
635 mm, with the highest values recorded between October and April (89% of the annual 
precipitation). The annual average evaporation was determined to be on the order of 1,415 mm, 
with the highest monthly evaporation rates occurring in October (145 mm) and the lowest 
monthly evaporation occurring in April (87 mm).  

The average annual temperature was 1.4°C. The maximum average monthly temperature was 
4.0°C during the month of February, while the minimum average monthly temperature was 
1.2°C in July. The lowest recorded temperature was -20.8°C in the month of March. 

The average relative humidity is around 68%, with monthly averages ranging from a low of 47% 
in June to a high of 83% in February. The annual average wind speed is estimated to be 2.3 
m/s, with monthly averages ranging from 1.7 m/s in February to 2.6 m/s in September. The wind 
direction is generally from the southeast. 

Limited comparison of the site data may be drawn to other weather stations in the region. 
Several regional weather stations have relatively long data records. However, all of the 
available stations are a significant distance from the Project, and only general seasonal trends 
correlate with the Project meteorology station.  

Firsthand observation of weather conditions during the 2011 drilling program indicates 
conditions vary significantly across the Corani Project site. Terrain and elevation have been 
observed to exert considerable influence on precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns.  

Engineering designs should employ appropriate conservatism based on the limited site climate 
data available. The site climate will allow for year-round operations, with normal operating 
delays for conditions such as snow and fog. Freeze protection shall be required for all hydraulic 
works.  

The operations can be completed year round at the site despite inclement weather during the 
months with high rainfall and/or snow. 

 Physiography and Vegetation 5.4

The Project site is located in the eastern Andes mountain range, between 4,600 and 5,200 m 
above sea level (masl). The area is characterized by mountainous terrain dominated by volcanic 
rock above which sits glacial gravel. The lithologic and climatic conditions have given rise to a 
series of cirques or bowl-shaped, steep-walled basins. During periods of rainfall, the valley 
floors collect precipitation allowing the generation of small wetlands (bofedales). 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 45 

Apart from the vegetation associated with the wetlands mentioned above, areas of "puna" or 
alpine tussock grassland occupy the valleys and moderate to steep slopes. The areas above 
4,700 masl mostly consist of steep mountainous slopes where erosion and climatic conditions 
largely prevent the development of soils or vegetation. These areas are scarcely vegetated with 
species specially evolved to withstand the harsh conditions. The naturally occurring acidic soils 
related to oxidation of sulfide bearing materials and the resulting ARD from exposed mineralized 
zones within the Project area has also prevented the development of vegetation where these 
conditions occur.

6 History 

 Prior Ownership and Production 6.1

Prior to the early 1950s, mineral exploration in the Corani district consisted of shallow prospect 
pits and adits in the northern portion of the current project area. These prospects are of 
unknown age and may date back to colonial Spanish time. Antimony prospects south and east 
of the property reportedly were active in the early 1900s, when there was limited antimony 
production (C.R. Petersen, 1967). 

The first modern evaluation of silver-lead mineralization began with the location of mineral 
concessions in 1951 by Augusto Leon y Leon. In 1953, Fernando de Las Casas visited the site 
and prepared a geological report titled "The Negrominas – Corani District." He mentioned that 
the rocks exposed in the area covered by the Negrominas Claims consist principally of a series 
of rhyolitic tuffs, breccias, and flows tilted to the Northeast. Also, he determined that two main 
types of ore-bearing structures are distinguished at Negrominas. Compañía Minera Korani was 
formed in 1956 to develop the silver-lead mineralization previously prospected. The mines were 
developed and operated from 1956 to at least until 1967; initially producing 80 tpd of ore. In 
1967, Compañía Minera Korani was owned two-thirds by Compañía Minera Palca and one-third 
by M. Hochschild. Total historical production is uncertain, but is estimated at 100,000 tonnes of 
silver-lead-zinc ore. In early 1967, estimated mine production was reported at about 3,400 short 
tons per month, with grades of 7.0-9.0% lead, 2.3% zinc, and 8.0 to 11.0 oz/ton silver (C.R. 
Petersen, 1967). 

Figure 6-1: Part of the Old Flotation Circuit 

 

Historical maps of the underground workings show development on four levels (4820, 4843, 
4860 and 4870 m levels for 50 meters vertically) that extend over an area of approximately 500 
m in a general north-south direction (parallel to strike) by about 150 m in an east-west direction. 
It is not known when operations of Compañía Minera Korani ceased, but presumably they 
ceased in the late 1960s or early 1970s. This mining operation left behind many mine portals, 
waste piles, and mine tailing that continually produce ARD. Smaller portals are located 
approximately 2 km to the south of the historical mill and discharge ARD into the Collpa Mayo 
drainage.  

The next exploration activity was by a private Peruvian company, Minsur. That exploration was 
reported to include 40 shallow drill holes in various locations, including a number of close 
proximity holes in the gold zone (located south of the current resource area). Although Minsur is 
an active mining company in Peru, attempts by BCM to secure copies of Minsur's exploration 
data have been unsuccessful. None of Minsur's exploration information is available or verifiable, 
although, reportedly, gold mineralization was encountered in some of Minsur's drilling. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 47 

In late 2003 and early 2004, Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration began a surface exploration 
program for porphyry copper mineralization. During 2004, Rio Tinto conducted surface 
mapping, sampling, and ground magnetic surveys and developed access roads into the area. 
That initial work by Rio Tinto defined anomalous silver and lead mineralization to the south of 
the Korani mines and also defined a zone of anomalous gold mineralization in rock and soils. 

The concession ownership by Compañía Minera Korani apparently lapsed during the 1970s. 
The ownership of Minsur also lapsed prior to Rio Tinto's exploration activities after 2000. Rio 
Tinto re-established some of the older concessions in their name beginning in 2003. BCM has 
added two concessions early in 2005 to create the current land position described in Section 4. 

 Historical Exploration and Estimates 6.2

There have been six previous mineral resource estimates for the Project and two estimates of 
mineral reserves, all of which have been published in previous technical reports. The six 
previous technical reports are summarized below:

Corani Silver-Gold Exploration Project. SRK Consulting. Tucson, Arizona, United States. 

2) October 4, 2006, Corani Project Mineral Resource Technical Report, Independent Mining

The mineral resource and reserve estimates from each report are summarized in Table 6-1 
through Table 6-6. The resource estimate from the 2015 Technical Report is identical to the 
estimate presented in this Technical Report; however, the reserve estimate differs and therefore 
the corresponding estimates of resources in additional to mineral reserves also differs.

7 Geology Setting and Mineralization 

 Regional Geology 7.1

The Corani Project area is located in the northern part of Puno Department, southern Peru, 
within the Cordillera Oriental of the Central Andes (Figure 7-1). The Cordillera Oriental in this 
region is represented by northwest-trending, glaciated peaks ranging in elevation from 5800 to 
6400 m above sea level. Including its western foothills, the Cordillera Oriental forms a ~125 km-
wide mountainous zone eroded into variably deformed Lower Paleozoic to Mesozoic 
metasediments (Laubacher, 1978) intruded by granitoid plutons of Triassic-to-Early Jurassic 
age (Kontak et al., 1990 and 1991).  

Figure 7-1: Regional Geologic Map, Corani Project Vicinity 

 

Throughout the region, the Lower Paleozoic is represented by the Ananea Group, a thick (up to 
10,000 m) sequence of predominantly turbiditic sediments. These rocks were subsequently 
deformed during the early phase of the Hercynian Orogeny in Early Carboniferous time (340 
Ma). The Upper Paleozoic is characterized by the accumulation of the Ambo Group, a thinner 
but lithologically more variable sequence of sedimentary rocks. The Ambo Group is comprised 
of sandstone, conglomerate, and minor carbonaceous layers of mostly continental derivation 
and was deposited unconformably upon the Lower Paleozoic strata in a post-Hercynian basin.  

During the Lower Carboniferous, carbonates, shales, and sandstones of the Tarma Group were 
deposited in isolated basins; during the Upper Carboniferous, Copacabana Group carbonates 
were deposited over an extensive epicontinental area. The Mitu Group, comprised of 
continental redbed sandstone and conglomerate with volcanic intercalations, was deposited 
during the Permo-Triassic period, and the interval from the Triassic to the Upper Cretaceous is 
characterized by basin carbonate deposition and volcanism.

  Page 52 

Magmatism occurred in several widely-separated episodes during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic 
(Clark et al., 1990). Intrusive activity was most active during Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, 
and volcanism began to dominate after Middle Tertiary. Tertiary volcanic activity is largely 
represented by the Oligocene to lowermost Miocene Picotani Group and the Lower to Upper 
Miocene Quenemari Group. The Picotani Group is comprised of rhyodacites intercalated with K-
rich basalts and ultrapotassic, lamproitic, and lamprophyric flows, whereas the Quenamari 
Group is dominated by rhyolites and two-mica syenogranites (Li, 2016).  

 Local and Property Geology 7.2

The following description of the geology, structure, alteration, and mineralization specific to the 
Corani Project is largely modified from, and in some cases is excerpted directly from, Society of 
Economic Geologists Special Publication No. 15, "The Discovery History and Geology of 
Corani: A Significant New Ag-Pb-Zn Epithermal Deposit, Puno Department, Peru," prepared by 
Swarthout et. al. (2010). GRE has reviewed this information and available, associated 
supporting documentation in detail and finds the discussion and interpretations presented 
herein to be reasonable and suitable for use in this report. 

 Lithology 7.2.1

The oldest strata encountered in the vicinity of the Project belong to the Ambo and Tarma 
Groups, which consist primarily of shales with minor quartzites, sandstones, and local 
carbonate lenses. Within the Project area, the sedimentary units are dominantly red to gray 
shales, which commonly contain syngenetic or diagenetic pyrite. These rocks are moderately 
folded and faulted, striking northwest with 10° to 50° dips east and west along the flanks of a 
modest anticlinal fold. Though outcrops of these rocks within the Project area are relatively few, 
resistant quartzite units often form ridges throughout the greater regional area, whereas 
weathered shales generally form slopes. The local lithology is illustrated on Figure 7-2. 

The overlying Chacacuniza Member of the Quenemari Formation is the primary host of 
mineralization at the Corani Project. The Chacacuzina is the youngest member, ca. 23.94 ± 
0.15 Ma (Ullrich, 2006), of the Quenemari and is comprised of a sequence of crystal-lithic and 
crystal-vitric-lithic tuffs. Within the Project area, these rocks strike northwest and dip 
subhorizontally to 40° northeast. Bedding ranges from well-bedded to massive, locally showing 
poorly developed columnar jointing. The tuffs are widely hydrothermally altered and pervasively 
argillized to low-temperature clays and are variably faulted, fractured, and brecciated. Individual 
units of the tuff sequence are pumiceous, and in general, the more lithic-rich units occur near 
the base, while the finest grained crystal tuffs are located within the upper part of the overall 
sequence. The upper portion of the tuff sequence includes a generally well-bedded andesite 
flow (or flows) of variable thickness. The andesite hosts mineralization in similar character to the 
surrounding tuffs, with no apparent constraints attributable to the change in lithology.  

The Chacacuzina is unconformably overlain by the upper members (undifferentiated) of the 
Quenemari Formation, the Sapanuta and Yapamayo Members, ca. 10.375 ± 0.080 Ma (Ulrich, 
2006). These rocks are nearly identical to the Chacacuzina in lithology, composed primarily of 
crystal lithic tuffs, but are notably different in both alteration and mineralization. They are 
generally flat-lying to shallowly dipping and are separated from the underlying tuff sequence by 
an angular unconformity with substantial topographic relief. The upper (Sapanuta/Yapamayo) 
tuff sequence is commonly collectively referred to as the "post-mineral" tuff, while the tuffs of the 
Chacacuzina are referred to as "pre-mineral." The post-mineral tuff occupies much of the 
volcanic section in the northern portion of the Project area and is largely unaltered and 
considered effectively barren.

 Structure 7.2.2

The Corani Project area has been affected by brittle deformation at both local and regional 
scales. The geometry and kinematics of known structures suggest the occurrence of two 
tectonic events: a) an extensive tectonic event contemporaneous with mineralization within and 
to the south of Corani Main, locally expressed by listric faults that have generated a light tilting 
and rotation of the blocks; and b) a second extensional tectonic event resulting in post-
mineralization structures such as those identified within and to the south of Corani Este (Ayala 
Prado, 2008). 

The Corani deposit is hosted within a stacked sequence of listric normal faults striking 
dominantly north to north-northwest with moderate to shallow (50° to <10°) westerly dips. The 
hanging walls of the listric faults are extensively fractured and brecciated, providing the 
structural preparation for subsequent or syngenetic mineralization. The stacked listric faults are 
more prominent in the Corani Minas and Corani Main areas. The Corani Este area contains a 
single known listric fault with an extensively fractured and brecciated hanging wall. The contact 
with the underlying Paleozoic sediments corresponds locally to listric faults dipping shallowly to 
the west. 

Desrochers (2005) described the structural geology of Corani as being dominated by a series of 
north- and north-northwest−trending faults and veins with Ag, Au, and Sb mineralization. Field 
observations indicate that the mineralized veins formed during normal movement along the 
faults, although the extension was accompanied by a minor amount of sinistral strike slip. The 
faulting moved the western, or hanging wall, block down and away from the main structure with 
a southwest-trending transport direction. Maximum extension took place at the intersection of 
the north- and north-northwest−striking structures, and in northwest-trending bends along the 
main north-south structure. These bends also coincide with steeper parts of the main north-
south structure. 

 Alteration 7.2.3

Generally, illite-kaolinite alteration of the pre-mineral tuffs is present over a 5- by 2-km area, 
approximately occupying the entire window exposed beneath the post-mineral tuffs. Most 
common alteration phases associated with the mineralization are illite, kaolinite, and 
smectite/chlorite/celadonite. Distribution of dominant alteration types is shown in plant view on 
Figure 7-3. 

Gangue minerals include massive to banded quartz, barite, chalcedony, and iron and 
manganese oxides. The mineralization and alteration assemblages are well documented in thin 
and polished sections (Gagliuffi Espinoza, 2006) and by Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals 
Scan (QEMSCAN) (Gunning, 2007). Each of the mineralized areas exhibits differences in 
alteration and gangue phases, which are described in further detail in Chapter 13 of this report.

Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED)

Figure 7-3 Alteration Map 

 

 Mineralization 7.2.4

Mineralization at the Corani Project occurs in three distinct and separate zones: Corani Main, 
Corani Minas, and Corani Este, each differing slightly in character with regard to both alteration 
and mineral assemblages. In general, mineralization in outcrop throughout the Corani Project is 
associated with iron and manganese oxides, barite, and silica. Silicification is both pervasive 
and structurally controlled along veins. In drill core, the mineralization occurs in typical low to 
intermediate sulfidation Ag-Pb-Zn mineral assemblages.  

The most abundant silver-bearing mineral is fine-grained argentian tetrahedrite or freibergite 
(Hazen Research, 2006; Gunning et al., 2007). Other minor silver minerals present include 
acanthite and the lead-silver sulfosalts, adorite and diaphorite. Other sulfide minerals include 
pyrite-marcasite, boulangerite, sphalerite, and galena. Boulangerite and galena do not appear 
to be significant hosts for the silver. Sphalerite, mainly high Fe type, overlaps the silver 
mineralization but can be more areally extensive, particularly at Corani Minas where sphalerite 
may extend 10 to 100 m beneath and lateral to the silver-bearing minerals. Lead also occurs as 
plumbogummite, a lead-aluminum phosphate. Lead mineral speciation is dependent on pH, and 
the plumbogummite is believed to be secondary in origin, forming as a result of the 
remobilization of lead in the presence of phosphate in a very acidic environment with abundant 
aluminum. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 56 

BCM geologists have defined nine specific mineral domains within the Corani deposit, based in 
part on metallurgical properties, as described below: 

 CSC – Coarse-grained silica-sulfide-celadonite characterized by readily discernible sulfides 
(galena-sphalerite-chalcopyrite ± tetrahedrite) with celadonite in crystalline to locally opaline 
quartz with good Ag-Pb-Zn recoveries.  

 CS - A subset of CSC that contains coarse galena-sphalerite-chalcopyrite ± tetrahedrite 
without green celadonite clay.  

 TET – Ag-bearing tetrahedrite characterized by recognizable late-stage, coarse-grained 
tetrahedrite cutting earlier sulfides and displaying the highest Ag contents and best Ag 
recoveries by flotation or leach: typically with low Pb-Zn content.  

 PM – Pyrite-marcasite ± quartz typical of low temperature early-stage mineralization with 
little polymetallic mineralization, mainly Zn.  

 FBS – Fine-grained black silica-sulfides characterized by very fine-grained mineralogy 
deposited from quenched ore fluids with highly variable metal content and generally poor 
leach recoveries and good flotation recovery with some challenges in separation.  

 QSB - Crystalline quartz-sulfide-barite interpreted as early fault fill or late-stage breccia fill.  

 PG – Plumbogummite, identified as a pale-green, waxy, Pb-phosphate mineral that in 
metallurgical test results shows diminished lead flotation and difficulties in separation of base 
metals.  

 FeO – Iron-oxide mineralization with locally elevated Ag and generally low Pb-Zn. This is a 
gradational zone with mixtures of FeO and FBS and the most strongly oxidized areas shows 
high Ag leach recovery results; and 

 MnO – Manganese-oxide mineralization hosting mainly Ag with lesser Pb-Zn with very poor 
response to flotation and leach tests.  

Mineralization is largely structurally controlled in each of the three areas along a general north-
northwest strike. Figure 7-4 illustrates the distribution of silver mineralization based on thickness 
at an approximate cut-off grade of 15 g/t silver. Strike length of silver mineralization is roughly 2 
km for Corani Main and Corani Minas combined, and 1.5 km for Corani Este. 

The cross sections presented in Figure 7-5 illustrate the general thickness and dip of the 
mineralized zone(s).  

All mineralization, with the exception of pyrite, dies out at depth, typically ending as much as 50 
m above the contact with underlying Paleozoic basement. In drill core, the contact with the 
Paleozoic sedimentary rocks is locally sheared with gouge and slickensides. The sedimentary 
rocks are locally brecciated, but the breccias do not contain a hydrothermal matrix. The strata 
locally contain pyrite veins, with bleached (Fe-reducing) halos, and Fe carbonate veinlets 
(Nelson, 2006). Veining within the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks is completely barren of 
economic mineralization. 

Corani Main 

The primary mineralized vein breccia in the Corani Main area can be traced for 800 m and 
undulates with strikes and dips varying between S50°E, 55° W and S20°W, 40° W, with 
steepening dips to the north. Vein breccias locally attain widths of >10 m. To the north, strike 
and dip change, which indicates a plunging, dilatant structure that attains widths of 80 m, with 
near-vertical quartz veins surrounded by stockwork systems in adjacent wall rock. The change 
in strike suggests that an overall sinistral (left-lateral) strike-slip component affects the veining, 
causing the mineralization to blow-out, or widen and intensify, to the north (Nelson, 2006). 
Breccias and stockworks are characterized by chalcedonic, cockscomb, crystalline, hyaline, and 
amethystine quartz, with hematite-jarosite-goethite and barite stringers resulting in a highly 
banded texture. Manganese oxides are generally sparse but locally abundant. Pyrite, dark 
sphalerite, and freibergite are present (Petersen, 2005; Gagliuffi Espinoza, 2006). A post-
mineral transverse fault, striking N70° E and showing dextral movement, separates the Corani 
Main and Corani Minas mineralized areas. The fault deforms the veins on either side; however,

post-mineral displacement appears minimal, despite the fault's appearance as a major 
lineament. Figure 7-6 shows a representative cross-section of Corani Main. 

Figure 7-6: Corani Main Representative Cross-Section 

 

Corani Minas 

Corani Minas is structurally complex and characterized by a large area of small, crested ridges 
formed by breccias, silicification, and quartz vein ribs. Veins, 0.1 to 2.0 m wide, are composed 
of banded, chalcedonic, and hyaline quartz, barite, hematite, jarosite, goethite, pyrite, and 
proustite-pyrargerite. The veins generally strike north 20°−60° west with 50° to 80° dips to both 
the west and east (Desrochers, 2005; Nelson, 2006; Ayala Prado, 2008), although almost any 
dip angle can be observed (Nelson, 2006). Hanging-wall breccias are composed mainly of 
subrounded to angular clasts with void-filling barite crystals in a siliceous matrix, whereas 
stockwork veining is mainly within the footwall. According to Nelson (2006), orientations and 
textures, such as the absence of slickensides, indicate that veining was extensional and that

block rotations tended to occur surrounding an east-west axis. Figure 7-7 shows a 
representative cross-section of Corani Minas. 

Figure 7-7: Corani Minas Representative Cross-Section 

  

Corani Este 

Corani Este is distinct in that mineralization is controlled by a single listric fault that does not 
crop out due to post-mineral tuff cover. Silicified breccias and stockwork veining are formed in 
the hanging wall of the main vein and crop out as silica-rich ribs along a north-south strike. Dips 
are difficult to determine in outcrop and drill core due to the structural complexity and 
hydrothermal alteration; however, conjugate vein sets, occasionally north-south striking and 
dipping both east and west, are observed. Importantly, a small breccia pipe occurs in Corani 

Este containing high-grade silver values (≥300 g/t Ag). Mineralization within the pipe occurs in 
hydrothermal breccias with a dark-gray, sulfide matrix and dark-purple, jasperoid vein breccias. 
Figure 7-8 shows a representative cross-section of Corani Este.

8 Deposit Types 

The Corani deposit is best described as a low- to intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit 
with silver, lead, and zinc hosted in stock works, veins, and breccias. Epithermal deposits as 
originally defined are products of volcanism-related hydrothermal activity at shallow depths and 
low temperatures, with deposition normally within about 1 km of the surface and in the 
temperature range of 50 to 300°C. A few epithermal deposits can be related directly to deep-
seated intrusive bodies, but this relationship is demonstrable only where especially deep 
erosion has occurred. Most ores of this type are in or near areas of Tertiary volcanism. 

While epithermal, mineralization at Corani is likely both laterally and vertically distal to an 
intrusive source. Mineral textures grade from coarse crystalline quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite in the 
southern portion of the Project area, to finer grained, pyrite-dominated sulfide minerals in the 
north, suggesting a south-to-north hydrothermal fluid flow. This spatial zonation suggests a 
rapidly cooled ore fluid typical of a distal setting surrounding a buried intrusion (Swarthout et al., 
2010). As proposed by Swarthout et al. (2010), the multiphase nature of the mineralization and 
zonation at Corani may be related to multiple fluid exsolution events from an evolving porphyry 
type system that possibly underlies the southern part of the area. Alternatively, the mineralizing 
solutions may be related to shallow, subvolcanic dome emplacement. 

Mineralization at Corani is principally located in a set of lístric faults dipping west (Desrochers, 
2005; Nelson, 2006; Ayala Prado, 2008), showing dilation segments related to subvertical 
structures and breccias in the hanging wall. In the footwall, mineralization occurs as veinlets 
forming stockwork structures. Structural control of the mineralization is a product of extensional 
tectonics that developed north- to northwest-trending fractures and faults, and whose 
movements provided the structural preparation for the influx of mineralizing fluids. Geometric 
analysis (Ayala Prado, 2008) of the faults and fractures indicates that veins are placed in the 
steeper (sub-vertical) and more superficial portions of the greater system of normal faults. The 
listric faulting described by Desrochers (2005), Nelson (2006), and Ayala Prado (2008) provides 
a sound structural model that can and should be tested and refined with future drilling 
exploration and resource modelling.

9 Exploration 

BCM began exploring the Corani Project in early 2005. In addition to drilling, which is discussed 
in detail in Chapter 10 of this report, exploration activities carried out by BCM include detailed 
geologic mapping, trenching, and geophysical surveying. 

 Geophysical Exploration 9.1

VDG del Perú S.A.C. (VDG) conducted a ground geophysical campaign at the Corani Project 
 on behalf of BCM in the fall of 2005. A total of 44.20 line-km of induced polarization (IP) data 
was collected, along with 50.95 line-km of magnetic survey. The line layout was established by 
means of a Real-Time GPS prior to the geophysical surveys for a total of 51.65 line-km. 

The geophysical surveys were aimed at assisting in geological mapping, including lithologies 
and key structures and at mapping mineralization and alteration associated with a low 
sulfidation gold-silver system. The objective of the IP/Res survey was to map the electrical 
response by means of high-resolution IP traverses across the favorable north-south corridor 
identified based on the results of both trench and drilling exploration. The chargeability is 
instrumental in defining disseminated sulfides associated with economic mineralization. 

The field results of both methods were of good quality and were meaningful. The final 
chargeability and resistivity depth sections mapped systematically clear contrasts from line to 
line between the sub-surface and a nominal depth of 283 meters below surface. The 
chargeability outlined five (5) IP anomalies (Figure 9-1), two of which, IP1 and IP3, correspond 
to the Corani Main and Corani Este areas, respectively. Those anomalies accurately mapped 
the known mineralization and extended the size of both mineralized zones. A separate anomaly 
(IP4), located to the south and east of the existing resource area, exhibited the same type of 
geophysical response as the Corani Este anomaly. This anomaly extends for 1,600 meters by 
400 meters, and remained open to the south. Another anomaly (IP5) extends to the south of 
Corani Main and appears to be the extension of it. This anomaly is a wide zone, some 600 by 
600 meters, and is also open to the south. A reconnaissance survey completed in the southern 
part of the property along three lines spaced every 500 meters outlined encouraging 
chargeability anomalies that allowed extending the favorable prospective corridor to the south 
(Figure 9-2).

 Trenching Exploration 9.2

BCM has completed 25 trenches within the Project resource area (Corani Main, Minas, and 
Este) to verify the continuity of the structures covered by Quaternary sediments. Spacing 
between the trenches is roughly 50 to 100 meters. Channel samples from these trenches have 
produced an associated 1,295 assay intervals for a total of 2,924 meters of trench data. Another 
16 trenches have been completed within the Project area south of the current resource area. All 
trenching and channel sampling is completed by hand, and samples are collected on 2-meter 
horizontal intervals based on GPS survey of the sample start and end points. Actual sample 
length is established by digitally draping the 2-meter sample intervals onto the topographic 
surface and adjusting the horizontal sample length to account for the recorded plunge or dip of 
the trench. In general, the results of trenching exploration indicate near surface mineralization 
both within and to the south of the current resource area.  

 Mapping 9.3

BCM has conducted general geologic surface mapping over the entire Project area. The total 
mapped surface is about 4.5 km wide (east-west) and 7.5 km long (north-south). In 2015, 
detailed surface mapping, including lithology, alteration, and structures, was performed at a 
scale of 1:2500 in the area of the proposed pits.

10 Drilling 

 BCM Drilling Exploration 10.1

Since 2005, BCM has completed a total of 556 drill holes at the Corani Project for a total of 
approximately 100,494.57 m. Drilling was completely by the Peruvian contractor, Bradly MDH 
primarily using LD250, JKS35, and LJ44 drill rigs. All of the drilling to date has been completed 
using diamond core drilling methods to produce either HQ (6.35 cm dia.) or NQ (4.76 cm dia.) 
core. Figure 10-1 shows the drill hole collar map that covers the area of the project with the 
estimated resource. Representative sections of the deposit are shown in Section 7.

Figure 10-1 BCM Drill Hole Collar Locations 

 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 68 

The typical drill pattern employed by BCM consists of a series of drill fans on section lines 
spaced 50 m apart. The fans are arranged perpendicular to the strike of specific targets. Angled 
holes are used in an attempt to drill perpendicular to the orientation of the mineralization. 
Multiple holes are often drilled from one site in order to reduce surface impact and obtain the 
necessary drill coverage (sample spacing) at depth. Some areas have been in-filled to 25 m drill 
spacing and in other, largely lower-grade target areas, drill spacing remains at 100 m. 

Drill hole collars were originally surveyed by hand held GPS with a reported accuracy of ±3.0 
meters. Since 2008, all of the drill hole collars have been resurveyed by conventional survey 
with substantially higher precision. Comparison of the resurveyed collar elevations to the 
surface topography map indicated that about 15% of the collar elevations differed from the 
topographic elevation by more than 5 m. About two-thirds of these occur in steep topography 
where the collar elevation is below topography as a result of the cut required to establish the 
drill pad. 

Prior to 2008, downhole surveys were not conducted. In 2008, downhole surveys were 
conducted on a series of 12 holes drilled targeting deep mineralized zones. Average depth of 
these holes is 220 m. Comparison of the downhole survey location of the bottom of the drill hole 
to the location projected from the collar survey revealed the average error of 4.89 m. The 
maximum of all errors was 11.13 meters. In the worst case, the drill hole location without survey 
would have been within one model block. 

Based on the results of the surveyed vs. projected hole orientation comparison, the lack of 
downhole surveys for holes of 200 m or less should have no major impact on the development 
of the block model. Regardless, precision surface and downhole surveys are recommended for 
all future drilling exploration.  

Core recoveries are generally excellent, with no discernible variation in rate of recovery 
between the two core sizes (HQ and NQ). While on site, the QP carefully reviewed the drilling 
and sampling procedures employed by BCM with BCM staff. Based on that review, the QP finds 
no drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that might materially impact the accuracy or reliability 
of the drilling results. The QP recommends that BCM produce annual (or seasonal) exploration 
reports to describe the drilling and sampling carried out during each given year or drilling 
campaign. The exploration report should contain adequate detail concerning the drill rig, drilling 
contractor, number of holes, total meters, recovery rates, drill targets and rationale for drill hole 
distribution, etc., to ensure that all pertinent information is captured and catalogued in a 
practical and efficient manner for ease of future use. 

 Drill Hole Data and General Drilling Results 10.2

Diamond drill hole data contained in the Project database to date includes 556 drill holes. Not all 
of the 556 drill holes included in the database are in the immediate area of the Project resource. 
The current block model relies on data from 470 drill holes, with an associated 34,443 sample 
intervals over a total of 85,212 m of drilling. The block model relies on 33,442 assay values 
each for silver, lead, zinc, and copper. 

In general, drilling exploration has identified and further defined the distribution of mineralization 
within the three primary resource areas, Corani Main, Corani Este, and Corani Minas. Drilling 
results indicate that significant mineralization occurs in two basic forms; in large veins 
associated with the principal listric fault structures, and in stockwork veins found in the 
surrounding rocks. The larger veins are generally rich in quartz / silica and barite and contain 
typical higher lead-zinc-silver mineralization, and can be several meters in width and quite 
continuous along strike and down dip. The stockwork veins occur in the wall rock between the 
faults and also contain significant lead-zinc-silver mineralization. The basement sediments at 
Corani are largely barren, though local, discontinuous occurrences of mineralization have been 
encountered within these units. 

Since 2006, BCM has undertaken to in-fill the known areas of mineralization in order to increase 
confidence in the resource estimate. This has been accomplished by in-fill drilling to produce a

11 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 

The following description of BCM sampling and analytical procedures is based largely on details 
presented in the 2015 NI 43-101 Technical Report issued by BCM (M3, 2015), and in part on 
observations and conversation with BCM personnel during the QP site visit conducted in August 
2017.  

 Sample Preparation 11.1

Diamond core samples are collected and placed into plastic and weatherproof cardboard boxes 
at the drill rig by the drill crew and are transported by vehicle to the Project camp, where the 
core preparation facilities are located. BCM geologists photograph the core as it is received 
from the drill rig and collect geotechnical (RQD) and core recovery information prior to selecting 
sample intervals for splitting. Assay samples, generally 2 m in length, are selected by the on-
site BCM geologist and are split using a manual core splitter. One half of the sampled core is 
returned to the box for geologic logging, and the other half is bagged and tagged with a blind 
sample number assigned by BCM (Figure 11-1). 

Figure 11-1 Bagged Core Samples Prepared for Shipment 

 

Channel samples are collected by BCM geologists from hand-dug trenches using a hammer 
and a moil point chisel. The trenches are excavated by hand to remove the overburden and 
expose a clean bedrock surface on the trench floor.  

Bagged trench and core samples are transported by BCM staff to Cusco or Juliaca, where they 
are transferred to a bus for shipment to (ISL-certified) ALS-Chemex labs in Arequipa, Peru. The 
samples are prepped in Arequipa, and are subsequently shipped to the ALS-Chemex lab in 
Lima for analysis. Chain of custody is documented throughout the entire transportation process. 

The samples are prepared according to ALS-Chemex preparation code PREP-31, which entails 
the following: 

 The sample is dried at 110° to120°C and crushed by jaw and roll crusher to 70% passing 2 
mm (about #10mesh). 

 A 250-g subsample is obtained using a riffle splitter. 

 The split is pulverized using a ring-and-puck pulverizer to 85% passing 75 micron. 

 Coarse rejects are returned to BCM.

 Analytical Procedures 11.2

Silver, lead, zinc, and copper assays are carried out by three-acid digestion followed by atomic 
absorption spectrophotometry (AA) analysis according to ALS-Chemex method AA62, as 
outlined below: 

 A sample of the pulp is digested with three acids: hydrofluoric, nitric, and perchloric, to 
produce a cake. 

 The cake is leached with hydrochloric acid. 

 The hydrochloric acid solution is subjected to AA to determine the concentration of dissolved 
silver, lead, zinc, and/or copper. 

The procedure described above is reported to be robust over the reported range of 1 to 1,500 
g/t silver.  

Multi-element inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis is conducted on select sample intervals 
to assist with mineralization classifications and to guide the interpretation of the metallurgical 
process response.  

 Quality Assurance/Quality Control 11.2.1

BCM maintains an internal Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program which includes 
both standard and check sampling. The QA/QC program was initially limited to silver assay 
data. The check assays for lead and zinc began in 2011. BCM's QA/QC efforts currently do not 
include routine insertion of duplicate or blank samples into the sample stream, with the 
exception of a few gold blanks. 

11.2.1.1 Standards 

Commercially prepared standard samples are inserted into the sample stream at a rate of one 
standard for every 20 samples. Eight separate standard samples, each with a unique and 
specific certified assay value, are used. The standards are in pulp form, in contrast to the half-
core samples from the Project, so are readily identifiable to the lab; however, the lab is not able 
to discern which specific standard has been inserted at any given time. 

BCM personnel periodically review the standard sample analytical results. If the laboratory 
analytical result differs from the certified assay value by more than 10%, the entire associated 
assay run (set of 20 samples) is submitted for reassay.  

11.2.1.1.1 2008 Standard Review 

In 2008, Mr. Christian Rios, CPG, was reported to have conducted a critical review of BCM's 
QA/QC program. The work was previously reported in the 2015 NI 43-101 Technical Report 
issued by BCM (M3, 2015) and included the following discussion: 

As of March 2008, 20 sample batches had been submitted for reassay due to out of 
tolerance response of the associated standard. The author used the standards to check on 
assay bias and sample handling procedures.  

The statistical results of the ALS-Chemex silver assays indicated that the ALS-Chemex lab 
tended to undervalue the low-grade silver standards.  A number of standards in the 1.2 to 
1.9 gm/t range were reported back as trace by ALS.  This is of no impact on reserves as 
the cut-off grades are significantly above these values. 

Several points were outside of the cluster of the data for that standard.  These points are 
typically indications of sample swaps.  There are probably about 0.5% sample swapping in 
the standards database.  It is not known if this is a function of improper sample insertion, 
(the likely cause), or assay and database reporting errors elsewhere in the system.

11.2.1.1.2 2017 Standard Review 

In 2017, GRE conducted a critical review of BCM's QA/QC program. Toward that end, BCM 
provided GRE with QA/QC data in multiple Excel spreadsheet files. GRE compiled the data into 
a single, comprehensive QA/QC data worksheet for analysis and evaluation. GRE prepared 
plots of the certified value of each standard against analytical values returned by the lab.  This 
evaluation is used to check for calibration errors at the lab level and assay bias. Figure 11-2, 
Figure 11-3, and Figure 11-4 show the results of the standards check for silver, lead, and zinc, 
respectively. The line on the graph represents a 45-degree line, or the ideal result from all 
values. The silver analytical results generally correlate well with the standard values with a few 
outliers possibly indicating that the wrong standard was identified for the sample. The lead and 
zinc analytical results, however, correlate less well, with two sets of results showing over-
valuation.

11.2.1.2 Check Assays 

11.2.1.2.1 2008 Check Assay Review 

The following discussion was also prepared by Mr. Rios, and is presented here as previously 
reported in the 2015 NI 43-101 Technical Report issued by BCM (M3, 2015): 

Check assay pulps are submitted to a second laboratory on a roughly 1 in 25 basis.  The 
initial check assay protocols were established during 2005 with silver assay checks only.  
The procedures were amended in late 2005 to include check assays of silver, lead, and 
zinc. 

The initial checks during 2005 are summarized on Figure 11-3. During this period, check 
assay pulps were submitted to SGS labs in Lima.  There is a substantial variability in the 
check assay results during this period.  There is no indication of bias in the data set, but 
there is substantial variability between the original and the check assays.  The cause of the 
variability is not known.  There is some potential that the check pulps have been swapped 
or mislabeled when shipped to the check lab. 

The same trend is apparent regarding the high degree of scatter with the Inspectorate 
checks as with the SGS checks before them.  The variability occurs in all three metals, 
silver, lead, and zinc. Although a degree of scatter is typical for the precious metal assays, 
the variability of lead and zinc are unusual for base metal check assays on pulps. 

There is effectively no scatter in the plots for the most recent checks.  It is not certain if the 
issue has been corrected or that it is not apparent with only 115 samples in the most recent 
check set. 

The variability in check assays for the period of 2005 through 2007 can be summarized by 
a quick scan of the percentage of checks that were more than 25% different than the 
original assay. 

   Silver 1978 checks 18.2% are more than 25% different 

   Lead 1983 checks   4.2% are more than 25% different   

   Zinc  1984 checks   7.3% are more than 25% different 

Hypothesis tests for each set of check assays do indicate that they can be accepted with 
95% confidence and there is effectively no bias in the check assay result.  However, the 
variability issue should be understood.  It could simply be a function of miss-assignment of 
batch results to the working spreadsheet, or potential miss-labeling of pulps prior to 
shipment for check assay. 

Many of the scattered silver results are the same samples with scattered lead and zinc 
results.  The implication is that the entire check assay has been mis-labeled, or mis-located 
when inserted into the master spreadsheet. 

11.2.1.2.2 2017 Check Assay Review 

In 2017, GRE conducted a critical review of the check assay results. GRE prepared quantile-
quantile (or Q-Q) plots of the check assay data to determine if the two data sets come from 
populations with a common distribution. The Q-Q plot plots the quantiles (i.e., the fraction of 
points below a given value) of the first data set against the quantile of the second data set. A 
45-degree line is also plotted. If the two sets come from a population with the same distribution, 
the points should fall approximately along the 45-degree reference line. A Q-Q plot can also test 
for shifts in location, shifts in scale, changes in symmetry, and the presence of outliers. Figure 
11-5 through Figure 11-10 provide the check assay Q-Q plots prepared by GRE. Each plot also 
shows an R

2
 value. The R

2
 value is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the 45-

degree regression line and can vary from 0 to 1. In general, the higher the R
2
 value (i.e., the 

closer to 1), the better the model fits the data.

The Q-Q plots indicate effectively no scatter in the data, with R2 values ranging from a low of

the ALS CIMM Q-Q plots. 

11.2.1.3 Blanks 

Gold blanks were included for 16 samples in 2011. All gold analytical results for these 16 
samples were below detection, indicating no artificially introduced contamination in the field for 
these samples. 

Although BCM has not routinely inserted blank samples into the sample stream, the laboratories 
do periodic blank checks internally to check for trace sources of artificially introduced 
contamination within the lab. A cursory review of the lab blank results indicated no apparent 
bias introduced by the labs. 

 Sample Security 11.3

During exploration campaigns BCM employed standard chain of custody procedures during all 
segments of drill core and trench sample transport. Samples prepared for transport to the 
laboratory were bagged and labelled in a manner which prevents tampering, and remained in 
BCM control until released to private transport carrier in Cusco or Juliaca. Upon receipt by the 
laboratory, samples were tracked by a blind sample number assigned and recorded by BCM. 

All whole and retained half core samples are stored in a fenced compound located in Juliaca 
(Figure 11-7). The core is neatly stored in labelled core boxes, which are arranged according to 
drillhole on sturdy, covered shelving units. Access to the core storage facility by unauthorized 
personnel is prohibited by a locked gate. Coarse reject and pulp samples are stored in BCM's 
Lima warehouse facility, which is accessible only to authorized BCM personnel.

 QP Opinion on Adequacy 11.4

The QP finds the sample preparation, analytical procedures, and security measures described 
herein to be reasonable and adequate to ensure the validity and integrity of the data derived 
from BCM's sampling programs, with some room for improvement. Based on observations and 
conversation with BCM personnel during the QP site visit, in conjunction with the results of 
GRE's review and evaluation of BCM's QA/QC program, the QP makes the following 
recommendations: 

 Formal, written procedures for data collection and handling should be developed and made 
available to BCM field personnel. These should include procedures and protocols for field 
work, geological mapping and logging, database construction, sample chain of custody, and 
documentation trail. These procedures should also include detailed and specific QA/QC 
procedures for analytical work, including acceptance/rejection criteria for batches of 
samples. 

 A detailed review of field practices and sample collection procedures should be performed 
on regular basis, to ensure that the correct procedures and protocols are being followed. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 79 

 Review and evaluation of laboratory work should be an on-going process, including 
occasional visits to the laboratories involved. 

 BCM's existing QA/QC program should be expanded to include at least standards, blanks, 
and duplicates. All QA/QC control samples sent for analysis should be blind, meaning that 
the laboratory should not be able to differentiate a check sample from the regular sample 
stream. The minimum control unit with regard to check sample insertion rate should be the 
batch of samples originally sent to the laboratory. Samples should be controlled on a batch 
by batch basis, and rejection criteria should be enforced. Ideally, assuming a 40-sample 
batch, the following control samples should be sent to the primary laboratory: 

 Two blanks (5% of the total number of samples). Of these, one coarse blank should be 
inserted for every 4

th
 blank inserted (25% of the total number of blanks inserted). 

 Two pulp duplicates (5% of the total number of samples) 

 Two coarse duplicates (5% of the total number of samples) 

 Two standards appropriate to the expected grade of the batch of samples (5% of the 
total number of samples). 

 For drill hole samples, the control samples sent to a second (check) laboratory should be 
from pulp duplicates in all cases and should include one blank, two sample pulps, and one 
standard for every 40-sample batch.  

 The purpose of the coarse duplicates is to quantify the variances introduced into the assay 
grade by errors at different sample preparation stages. Coarse duplicates are inserted into 
the primary sample stream to provide an estimate of the sum of the assay variance plus the 
sample preparation variance, up to the primary crushing stage. An alternative to the coarse 
duplicate is the field duplicate, which in the case of core samples, is a duplicate from the core 
box (i.e. a quarter core or the other half core). Because sample preparation is currently 
carried out by the laboratory (and not by BCM), if coarse duplicates are preferred (in order to 
preserve drill core), the coarse duplicates should be sent for preparation and assaying by the 
second laboratory. 

 QA/QC analysis should be conducted on an on-going basis, and should include consistent 
acceptance/rejection tests. Each round of QA/QC analysis should be documented, and 
reports should include a discussion of the results and any corrective actions taken.

12 Data Verification 

 Site Inspection 12.1

GRE representative and QP J.J. Brown, P.G., conducted an on-site inspection of the Corani 
Project and the Juliaca core storage facility on August 7 through 10, 2017. Ms. Brown spent two 
full days at Project site accompanied by BCM geology staff Enrique Osorio Cornejo and Jorge 
Ganoza. While on site, Ms. Brown conducted general geologic field reconnaissance, including 
inspection of bedrock exposures and other surficial geologic features, ground-truthing of 
reported drill collar and trench sample locations, and superficial examination of historic mine 
workings. One full day of the site visit was spent at the core storage facility in Juliaca, where 
select intervals of whole and half core were visually inspected and samples were selected to 
submit for check assay. 

Field observations during the site visit generally confirm previous reports on the geology of the 
Project area. Bedrock lithologies, alteration types, and significant structural features are all 
consistent with descriptions provided in existing Project reports, and the author did not see any 
evidence in the field that might significantly alter or refute the current interpretation of the local 
geologic setting (as described in Chapter 7 of this report).  

A total of 96 collar locations (approximately 20% of the total used to develop the block model) 
were verified in the field using a hand-held GPS unit. The average variance between field collar 
coordinates and collar coordinates contained in the Project database is roughly 18 m, well 
within the expected margin of error accounting for the difference between the methods of survey 
(hand held unit versus professional ground survey). 

Specific core intervals from 35 separate drill holes were selected for visual inspection and 
potential check sampling based on a preliminary review of the drill hole logs and associated 
assay values. The core intervals were selected prior to the site visit, and the core was laid out 
by BCM staff and ready for inspection upon arrival. With few exceptions, the core samples 
accurately reflect the lithologies recorded on the logs. Given the similarity in composition of the 
pre- and post-mineral tuff, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two without greater 
context. In some cases, (unsampled) core intervals logged as post-mineral tuff were variably 
altered and oxidized, similar in character to the majority of the core logged as pre-mineral tuff. 
Three such sample intervals were selected from a single drill hole, DDH-C59B, for assay. The 
sample intervals selected were gradational with regard to visible evidence of alteration/oxidation 
(i.e., one very altered, one moderately altered, and one barren in appearance). Assay results 
(Table 12-1) indicate that the samples are in fact mineralized.

A total of 17 samples were selected for check assay. The samples were selected from low, 
moderate, and high-grade intervals based on original assay results. In all cases, the degree of 
visible alteration and evidence of mineralization observed was generally consistent with the 
grade range indicated by the original assay value. Laboratory analysis was completed by ALS 
Peru using the same sample preparation and analytical procedures as were used for the 
original samples. Standard t-Test statistical analysis was completed to look for any significant 
difference between the original and check assay population means. A single sample was 
removed from the total sample population based on an erroneous original assay value. The 
results of the t-Test showed no statistically significant difference between the means of the two 
trials (original versus check assay).

 IMC Audit 12.2

In 2011, BCM contracted Independent Mining Consultants to perform an audit of the digital 
Project database. The following discussion was previously presented in the 2015 NI 43-101 
Technical Report issued by BCM (M3, 2015): 

IMC compared a random selection of original assay certificates to the assay information 
contained in the Corani Project database. Assay data from the following drill holes was used 
during the audit process: 

 
DDH-C3-A DDH-C7 DDH-C12-A DDH-C16-B DDH-C18-A DDH-C20-A 

DDH-C29-B DDH-C32-A DDH-C34-A DDH-C41 DDH-C42-A DDH-C43-B 

DDH-C46-A DDH-C58-B DDH-C66-A DDH-C70-A DDH-C74-B DDH-C79-A 

DDH-C84-A DDH-C86-A DDH-C92    

The assay certificate data was entered into an excel spreadsheet and then added to the IMC 
database containing the Corani data. 

The 21 drill holes evaluated had 1,524 associated silver, copper, lead, and zinc assay intervals.  
Assay certificate data was received for 1,310 assay intervals; the intervals for which original 
assay data was not provided are summarized in Table 12-2.

The results for the individual metals all appear on the same record, indicating that two records 
out of 1,310 records were entered in error. This sampling shows an error rate of 0.15%, which is 
an acceptable error rate, and the data is considered reasonably accurate and suitable for use in 
estimating mineral resources and mineral reserves. 

The observed discrepancy between trace assay entries and certificate values is likely a function 
of continuity between data entry personnel. This issue is minor and has no material impact on 
the determination of mineral resources or reserves, but should be addressed for consistency. 
The stated procedure by BCM personnel is to enter the less than trace results at half of the 
value of the trace assay. For example, <1 gm/t silver should be entered into the database as 0.5 
gm/t silver according to BCM protocol. 

IMC also compared trench sample assay values with nearby core sample assay values. IMC 
composited the data into 8-m down hole (or down trench) length composites. The composites 
were then paired on a nearest neighbour basis. 

The nearest neighbour procedure finds pairs of trench and diamond drilling composites that are 
within a specified distance to each other, so that a statistical comparison of the two data sets 
can be completed. For this test, IMC used 8-m, 16-m, and 24-m spacing between data pairs, 
which corresponds to the unit size of the 8-m length composites. There were only 20 to 25 pairs 
at the 8-m spacing, but there were over 80 pairs at the 16-m spacing, which is a sufficient 
quantity to provide for a robust statistical estimate. 

Table 12-7 summarizes the results of the nearest neighbour comparison. The comparison was 
applied for silver and lead only, as trench samples were not assayed for zinc. Statistical 
hypothesis tests were completed on the two closely located sample sets. The pass/fail 
determinations presented in Table 12-7 are based on the application of a 95% confidence 
interval. The T-test is a comparison of the population means. The Paired T calculates the 
differences between individual pairs and confirms that the differences are sufficiently small. The 
binomial test is a check of how many times one population is greater than the other, and the KS 
(Komologorov-Smirnoff) test is a comparison of the overall shape of each distribution. 

In all cases, the test results indicate that the trench and core sample assay data can be 
commingled for the purposes of developing a block model and calculating the mineral resource 
estimate.

 GRE Audit 12.3

 Digital Project Database 12.3.1

In 2017, GRE completed a QAQC audit of the digital Project database. GRE compared a 
random selection of original assay certificates to the assay information contained in the Corani 
Project database. Assay data from the following certificates was used during the audit process: 

 
LI05099746 LI06037967 LI07052871 LI07003983 LI08034674 LI05029718 

LI05074420 LI07032682 LI05023340 LI06040456 LI06115686 LI06007458 

LI07026517 LI06036875 LI06080182 LI07041835 LI06115686 LI06047343 

LI07026518 LI06037966 LI06058508 LI07063684 LI07038585  

The results of the audit are summarized below: 

 All assay results viewed that were less than the reporting limit were entered into the 
database with a value of 0. 

 Samples from six of the checked certificates were not located in the Project database. 

 One certificate included sample IDs that were in the database twice, with one set of results 
consistent with the certificate and one set different from the certificate.  

 All other results were consistent between the database and the certificates. 

The observed discrepancy between trace assay entries and certificate values is likely a function 
of continuity between data entry personnel.  This issue is minor and has no material impact on 
the determination of mineral resources or reserves, but should be addressed for consistency.  
The stated procedure by BCM personnel is to enter the less than trace results at half of the 
value of the trace assay.  For example, <1 gm/t silver should be entered into the database as 
0.5 gm/t silver according to BCM protocol. 

The other QA/QC checks show minimal to no error, which GRE believes represents an 
acceptable error rate, and the data is considered reasonably accurate and suitable for use in 
estimating mineral resources and mineral reserves. 

GRE also completed a mechanical audit of the Project database in order to evaluate the 
integrity of data from a data entry perspective. The mechanical audit identified a small number 
of data entry errors, including gaps, overlaps, and missing sample intervals. All data entry errors 
were easily rectified, and are considered insignificant with regard to potential impact to the 
mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates.  

 Density Data 12.3.2

BCM has performed 1,100 density determinations using a waxed core method. Samples are 
chosen out of every 5th core box to provide a sample spacing of approximately 15 m.  

In 2015, GRE analyzed the density data to determine if a relationship exists between density 
and a variety of parameters, including assay grade, mineralization type, and deposit area. Silver 
assay values in gm/t were converted to percent to normalize the grade units. Statistical analysis 
indicates that the best predictor of density is a combined silver, lead, and zinc grade of 
0.9381%. The average density of samples with a combined grade less than 0.9381% is 2.31 
t/m

3
, and the average density of samples with a combined grade of greater than or equal to 

0.9381% is 2.43 t/m
3
. The average density of post-mineral tuff with no associated assay data is 

2.3 t/m
3
, and the average density of non-tuff material is 2.53 t/m

3
. The densities (in t/m

3
) applied 

for each lithologic unit during mineral resource estimation are presented in Table 12-8.

 QP Opinion on Adequacy 12.4

Based on the results of the QP's check sampling effort, verification of drill hole collars in the 
field, visual examination of selected core intervals, and the results of both manual and 
mechanical database audit efforts, the QP considers the collar, lithology, and assay data 
contained in the Project data base to be reasonably accurate and suitable for use in estimating 
mineral resources and reserves. 

The database audit work completed to date indicates that occasional inconsistencies and/or 
erroneous entries are likely inherent or inevitable in the data entry process. The QP 
recommends that BCM establish a routine, internal mechanical audit procedure to check for 
overlaps, gaps, total drill hole length inconsistencies, non-numeric assay values, and negative 
numbers. The internal mechanical audit should be carried out after any significant update to the 
database, and the results of each audit, including any corrective actions taken, should be 
documented and stored for future use in database validation.  

Based on the positive assay results of the selected intervals of previously unsampled post-
mineral tuff, the QP recommends that BCM sample at least one 2-m interval for every 20-m 
drilled and logged as post-mineral tuff. If positive assay results are returned, additional intervals 
should be selected accordingly to ensure that all mineralized material is analyzed.

13 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 

 Introduction 13.1

The reader should note that Sections 13.2 through 13.6.3 describe the work relating to 
the 2011 Feasibility Study and Sections 13.6.4 through 13.7.2 describe the work 
associated with the 2015 Optimized and Final Feasibility Study Feasibility Study. No 
metallurgical work has been undertaken since then. 

Metallurgical testing of the Corani deposit has been extensive. Over one hundred samples have 
been tested using a variety of testing protocols including bulk flotation, cyanidation and 
sequential flotation. Metallurgical response to these conventional metal recovery methods was, 
however, widely variable. Some samples did not respond to conventional flotation recovery, with 
bulk flotation being necessary. Others produced clean concentrates at relatively good 
recoveries. The 2015 Feasibility Study refined these results and provided clarity for a 
predictable metallurgical recovery model which can be used in conjunction with the block model 
for mine planning. 

The high degree of variability was attributed to the mineralogy of the deposit. Many of the 
poorer performing samples had high degrees of non-sulfide lead, resulting in poor lead recovery 
and zinc selectivity issues during lead flotation. In addition, the mineral grain size of many of the 
samples was very fine, and interlocking with other sulfides would make recovery of high-grade 
concentrates at high recovery very challenging. 

While geological classification has allowed definition of some of the zones by metallurgical 
response, accurate prediction of FBS mineralization metallurgical performance had remained 
elusive. However, based on the 2015 study, much of the necessary data for predicting 
recoveries in a detailed block model are contained in the existing database. The following 
describes original and subsequent metallurgical work performed by GRE and TS leading to the 
current understanding of metallurgy and recoveries. 

 Samples 13.2

A plethora of testing, on a range of samples, has been conducted across the Corani deposit. In 
summary, about 66 discrete sections of drill core were batch tested using a sequential lead-zinc 
flotation flowsheet. Closed circuit metallurgical performance was determined via completion of 
locked-cycle tests on a total of 16 samples. Bulk flotation response, evaluated via batch flotation 
tests, was determined for an additional ± 70 samples. Notably, for a portion of these samples, 
zinc contents were low and only lead concentrate was produced. The response of 46 of the 
samples to cyanidation leaching was tested on whole ore. In a single test, cyanidation of a 
flotation tailing was evaluated. The majority of the samples tested in the flotation evaluations, 
bulk and sequential, were subjected to mineralogical assessment, primarily using QEMSCAN. A 
summary of tests conducted by year and testing facility is summarized in Table 13-1.

A description of the geological classification used by BCM to delineate the samples is as 
follows:  

 CSC - Coarse-grained silica-sulfide-celadonite characterized by readily discernible sulfides 
(galena-sphalerite-chalcopyrite+-tetrahedrite) with celadonite in crystalline to locally opaline 
quartz; 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 86 

 CS - A subset of CSC that contains coarse galena-sphalerite-chalcopyrite +- tetrahedrite 
without green celadonite clay; 

 TET – Ag-bearing tetrahedrite characterized by recognizable late-stage, coarse-grained 
tetrahedrite cutting earlier sulfides and displaying the highest Ag contents: normally ores 
with low Pb-Zn contents; 

 PM – Pyrite-marcasite +- quartz typical of early-stage mineralization with little polymetallic 
mineralization; 

 FBS – Fine-grained black silica-sulfides characterized by very fine-grained mineralogy 
deposited from quenched ore fluids with highly variable metal content; 

 QSB - Crystalline quartz-sulfide-barite interpreted as early fault fill or late-stage breccia fill; 

 PG – Plumbogummite, identified as a pale-green, waxy, Pb-phosphate mineral that in 
metallurgical test results showed diminished lead flotation and difficulties in separation of 
base metals; 

 FeOx – Iron-oxide mineralization with locally elevated Ag and generally low Pb-Zn. This is a 
gradation zone with mixtures of FeOx and FBS; and 

 MnO – Manganese-oxide mineralization hosting mainly Ag with lesser Pb-Zn.  

A summary of the number of samples tested for each geological classification is provided in 
Table 13-2. FBS is understood to be the main geological lithology by tonnage in the Corani 
deposit, and thus, the samples were also dominated by this geological classification.

 Mineralogy 13.3

Lead occurs not only as Galena, but also in non-sulphide forms such as plumbogummite 
(PbAl3(PO4)2(OH)5•(H2O)). Non-sulphide forms of lead would not be expected to be 
recoverable by flotation. According to the SGS dataset, generated using QEMSCAN 
technology, galena and sphalerite are both very finely grained. Fine primary and regrind sizes 
would be anticipated to facilitate separation of the two minerals into clean flotation concentrates. 

The relationship between these mineralogical characteristics and metallurgical response was 
demonstrated in Figure 13-2 through Figure 13-4, prepared by SGS, relating the mineralogical 
parameters to bulk flotation response. In these figures, SGS related the QEMSCAN 
mineralogical data that they generated against the metallurgical performance data generated by 
G&T using a bulk circuit for the same samples. Figure 13-2 displays the relationship between 
galena grain size and bulk circuit lead recovery. This data indicates galena grain size is an 
important driver of metallurgical response. Also of note is that the grain sizes noted are very 
fine, measuring less than 17µm in all cases. 

Figure 13-2: Relationship between Lead Recovery and Galena Grain Size (graph from SGS) 

 
 
 

Figure 13-2 displays the correlation between the deportment of lead to galena and lead 
recovery to the bulk circuit for the same samples as Figure 13-3. The relationship is less clear 
than for galena grain size but indicates that this deportment plays a role in lead recovery. This is 
not surprising as non-sulfide forms of lead are not generally recoverable by flotation.

Zinc present in the samples was identified as sphalerite. Zinc performance was found to be 
mainly driven by sphalerite grain size. The relationship between zinc recovery and sphalerite 
grain size is shown in Figure 13-4. The grain sizes were similarly fine as for galena, showing the 
need for fine primary and / or regrinding. 

Figure 13-4: Relationship between Zinc Recovery and Sphalerite Grain Size (graph from SGS) 

 
 
 

Silver mineralogy was briefly investigated by Hazen research and then again by SGS in 2008. 
The data indicated that silver was present mainly as tetrahedrite. Other sulfosalts were 
identified as minor carriers and included: myargyrite, pyrargyrite-proustite, boulangerite 
acanthite, and native silver. The Hazen mineralogy indicated that silver was also in solid 
solution with pyrite and possible sphalerite. Most of the silver-bearing minerals mentioned 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 90 

responded well to flotation when properly liberated. In a sequential lead-zinc flotation circuit, 
most of the silver minerals should report to the lead concentrate. 
 
Photomicrographs and back-scatter images from a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were 
taken by Hazen Research and confirmed this complex, fine-grained mineralogy. However, 
coarse galena grains were also noted in some samples. An example showing both complex and 
coarse liberated particles from Hazen Research on the Dawson composites is shown in Figure 
13-5. Friebergite (f) is intergrown with pyrite – marcasite (yellow) and coarse, liberated galena 
(g) cleavage fragments.

Based on these results, the ore appears to be of medium hardness with respect to SAG and ball 
milling.  

 Sequential Flotation Tests 13.5

Both bulk and sequential flowsheets were evaluated in several test programs. Much of the 
flotation testing, conducted by SGS, focused on the production of a marketable lead 
concentrate using the sequential flotation flowsheet. The separation of clean marketable lead 
and / or zinc concentrates was successful on only a portion of samples. For some samples, zinc 
or pyrite was recovered uncontrollably to the lead concentrate resulting in lower grade products. 
For other samples, flotation response was limited, leading to very low recoveries. 

G&T conducted sequential flotation tests on a small sub-set of samples with favorable flotation 
response and suitable head grades.  

Due to the improved marketability of the separate lead and / or zinc concentrates over a bulk 
concentrate; a sequential flowsheet was used for the design of the plant. The following 
subsections refer to the development of that sequential flowsheet. 

 Effect of Particle Size 13.5.1

The effect of primary grind was not studied in great detail for many of the test programs. Much 
of the testing was devoted to various depression and collector regimes used to control 
sphalerite (zinc) flotation in the lead circuit. However, there were series of tests conducted in the 
SGS 2008 and 2009 campaigns that examined the effect of primary grind size. 

Rougher test data for the 2008 tests was taken from composites A and B, which represented 
only the FBS geological classification. The test data for the 2009 test program was from the Ag-
Pb composite, which was a mix of geological classifications. 

The effect of primary grind was more pronounced for silver when compared to lead as shown in 
Figure 13-6 and Figure 13-7. The expected trend of better metallurgical performance was often 
observed for the finer grind sizes early during the flotation stages, equating to the low rougher 
mass recovery. As rougher mass recovery was increased, the effect of grind size was minimal. 
The data would suggest that if sufficient rougher mass recovery is achieved, primary grind sizes 
of 100 micron K80 or coarser could be used. There may be potential to further coarsen primary 
grind size.

 Effect of Departments 13.5.2

A challenge with many of the Corani deposit samples was the poor selectivity between lead and 
zinc in the lead flotation circuit. The majority of the testing conducted was devoted to improving 
the selectivity of the lead flotation circuit against the flotation of sphalerite (zinc). 

To tackle the activation of sphalerite, several depression schemes were employed. The 
depression schemes could be classified into general categories as follows:  

 Zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) – used in combination with selective collectors 

 Zinc sulphate/cyanide (NaCN) or Zinc oxide/cyanide (ZnO / NaCN) – most common 
depressant scheme for zinc depression during lead flotation. Very effective to combat 
copper ion activation of sphalerite and pyrite.

 Sulfite/Sulfide includes reagents Na2SO3, Na2S, SO2 – less common, but effective to 
sphalerite, pyrite depression when cyanide is not permissible. High dosages of these 
reagents will also depress galena (lead). 

The development of depressants used for most of the locked cycle tests occurred while testing 
of composites A, B, B2, and G during the SGS program in 2008-2009. The most complete 
matrix of testing was completed on sample G. Results of zinc depression are displayed in 
Figure 13-8 an Figure 13-9. Unfortunately, there were no comparable tests without depressant.

Figure 13-9: The Effect of Zinc Sulphate Dosage on Zinc Depression from the Lead Rougher  
Flotation, Composite G (FBS) 

 

As shown in the figures, the best selectivity was achieved when zinc sulphate (ZNSO4) was 
added. When cyanide was added without zinc sulphate, the activity of zinc was actually 
increased. It should be noted that one test was conducted with both zinc sulphate and cyanide 
and the results mirrored the zinc sulphate only conditions. Sodium sulphite (Na2SO3) alone did 
not appear to be effective for suppressing zinc in this sample. 

To further investigate the effects of zinc sulphate, there were a number of tests that utilized 
variable dosages of zinc sulphate with the other variables remaining constant. The results of 
these tests are displayed in Figure 13-9.

The curve indicated that the addition of zinc sulphate improved lead flotation selectivity against 
sphalerite. There was a slight improvement with increased dosage. As the Project continued, a 
depression regime was established using zinc sulphate, cyanide and sodium sulphite. The data 
generated on composite G was not verified on any other composite; however, the inclusion of 
zinc sulphate in the depression scheme may have been the most important aspect of controlling 
zinc in lead flotation in all of the following tests. There may be an opportunity to reduce or 
eliminate the use of sodium sulphite and cyanide. 

  Collectors 13.5.3

Again, much of the focus of flowsheet development program was dedicated to developing 
selectivity between lead and zinc in the lead flotation circuit. Several collectors were used, 
namely, Cytec products 3418A, 242, and 404. Xanthates were also included in combination with 
Cytec collectors. Potassium xanthate (strong) and sodium isopropyl xanthate (weaker) were 
primary xanthate collectors used. Xanthates were also used in the zinc circuit. 

Unique to this Project, a theoretical application of emulsified diesel oil (EDO) was also 
considered. EDO was added after an initial low dosage application of a lead selective collector. 
The EDO acts as an extender, enhancing the hydrophobicity of the selective collector. This 
collector extender was widely used for much of the testing. Composite G had several 
combinations of collector tested and isolated (all other conditions constant). Figure 13-10 
displays the selectivity differential between the different collectors. 

 
Figure 13-10: The Effect of Collector Type on Lead Rougher Flotation Selectivity against Zinc,  

Composite G (FBS) 

 

As shown, the use of different collectors did not have a significant impact on selectivity between 
lead and zinc in the lead rougher flotation. The dosage of collector did shift the results up the 
curve (higher dosages) or down the curve (lower dosages) 

Using the same series of rougher tests, the effects of EDO were isolated. EDO did not impart 
any gains in selectivity, as shown in Figure 13-11. This conclusion was reached later in testing 
at SGS in 2011.  

Based on these results, it would appear that the use of lower cost xanthates should be 
considered. As with all collectors, the dosage rate is an important factor to controlling selectivity 
in the lead circuit.

 Activators 13.5.4

In the lead circuit, activators such as sodium hydrosulfide and hydroximate collectors were 
briefly tested as a means of activating and recovering non-sulphide lead. The test results were 
discouraging, indicating that the plumbogummite, the dominate non-sulphide lead mineral, did 
not respond to these reagents. 

In the zinc circuit, activation of zinc was accomplished with copper sulphate (CuSO4). This is 
standard practice in industry. Dosages of copper sulphate required ranged between 100 and 
350 g/tonne. 

 pH Regulators 13.5.5

The use of pH regulators can be effective in controlling pyrite when used in combination with 
selective collectors and other depressants. In the lead circuit, controlling the pH to 8 to 9 is 
common to help depress pyrite and other iron sulphides. Above pH 9, lead depression occurs. 
The natural pH of many of the samples tested was well below 7; most samples averaged 5.5. 
Increasing the pH with lime in the lead circuit was ineffective and often resulted in increased 
activity of sphalerite flotation. Decreasing the pH with sulphuric acid was also investigated but 
showed no advantage. 

In 2011, a global composite (Ag-Pb-Zn) used for detailed flowsheet development indicated 
issues with pyrite activation as well as zinc activation in the lead flotation circuit. To combat 
issues of pyrite activation, sodium carbonate (NaCO3) was used effectively to reject pyrite and 
increase the grade of lead in the concentrate for this composite. Many other composites did not 
require the use of sodium carbonate to produce high-grade lead concentrates.  

For the zinc flotation circuit, the addition of lime to pH 11 or 11.5 was used for most of the 
composites tested.  

 Surface Modifiers 13.5.6

There were many surface modifiers tested, mostly to improve the quality of the lead 
concentrates. These included sodium silicate (silicate mineral depressant and dispersant) and 
starches (CMC and guar gum for silicate depressants). None of these reagents were useful in 
improving the metallurgical response of the flotation circuits.

 Rougher Concentrate Regrind 13.5.7

Due to the primary focus on chemistry, very little coordinated testing was devoted to 
investigating the effects of regrind. The quantitative mineralogy suggested that some of the 
mineralization (FBS) would require very fine primary and rougher regrind targets to achieve 
acceptable concentrate grades. Most of the testing conducted in 2008-2009 by SGS did only 
semi-quantitative sizing analysis. The target regrind size for both the lead and zinc regrinds 
appeared to be between 20 and 30 micron K80 in these programs. 

Based on the grain size data from the mineralogy, this target for the majority of the 
mineralization would be reasonable. The mineralization identified as CSC could utilize a coarser 
regrind and primary grind size target. 

 Summary of Sequential Locked-Cycle Test Results 13.5.8

While many of the locked-cycle tests had different conditions applied, the average for all tests

No samples representing the PG (plumbogummite) zone only were tested in the 2007-2008 
SGS programs. Such a sample would need to be obtained and tested to generate metallurgical 
performance predictions. However, given the poor metallurgical response of PG samples to a 
bulk flowsheet, it is unlikely such mineralization would respond well to a sequential flowsheet. 

 Concentrate Quality 13.5.9

A suite of the lead and zinc concentrates produced by SGS from locked-cycle testing was

The lead concentrates that SGS assayed, on average, graded 59 percent lead and 1,815 
g/tonne silver. The lead grade, particularly, is on the higher end of what is achievable for Corani 
mineralization. The concentrates, on average, graded about 0.8 percent antimony, which would 
be expected to result in smelting penalties. Arsenic, mercury, and cadmium were also elevated, 
and there may also be penalties applied for these elements. 

The zinc concentrates assayed by SGS, on average, graded 53.8 percent zinc and 331 g/tonne 
silver. Mercury was elevated in these concentrates, grading on average 56 g/tonne in the zinc 
concentrates. At this level, penalties, if not marketability issues, would be anticipated. Antimony 
and cadmium were also elevated in these concentrates, and potential penalties may be 
applicable.

 Alternative Flowsheet Arrangements 13.6

Bulk flotation testing was conducted for various samples in the Dawson, G&T, and SGS 
programs. For the SGS program, the sample set that was tested for bulk flotation may be 
biased towards samples with poor flotation response. But Dawson and G&T both seem to test a 
full range of samples, and some conclusions as to the variability in metallurgical response to 
flotation can be drawn from that work. 

In the 2006 test program, conducted by Dawson Metallurgical Laboratories, Ltd., a suite of 12 
samples was tested for cyanidation leaching response. This sample selection appears to be 
unbiased, whereas, in subsequent programs, only a selection of samples was subjected to 
cyanidation bottle roll tests, presumably due to poor flotation response. As such, only limited 
information can be drawn from those datasets. Dawson also conducted testing on two samples 
evaluating a combination of flotation and cyanidation. 

The following sub-sections discuss the result of tests conducted using these alternative 
flowsheets. 

 Bulk Flotation 13.6.1

In the program of testing by G&T, a test was conducted on each of 71 samples using the same 
reagent regime. In these tests, the objective was to recover all the sulphides into a bulk 
concentrate. A nominal primary grind sizing of 75 µm K80 was used. Only collectors, SIPX, and 
3418A were added to the bulk roughing stage, with lime also added in the regrinding stage. 
Since no depressants were added beyond the elevated pH in the cleaner, higher recoveries but 
poorer concentrate grades were obtained as compared to the sequential flowsheet.  

Upon analysis of the G&T results, it is clear that the different ore types designated by BCM were 
useful to delineate metallurgical performance based on these results. A summary of average 
batch cleaner test performance, obtained from each ore-type, is provided in Table 13-8.

Dawson utilized a nominal primary grind sizing of 75 µm K80 to conduct the cyanidation bottle 
roll tests. The 96-hour silver extraction and cyanide consumption data for the tests conducted

On average, just over half the silver was extracted using cyanidation bottle roll tests. Silver 
extraction kinetics tended to be slow after 8 hours.  

Cyanidation testing was only conducted on selected samples, generally of poor flotation 
response, in the G&T and SGS testing programs. However, results showed that under 
conditions almost the same as used by Dawson, similar silver extractions were obtained by 
G&T and SGS on these samples. Using a weighted average, about 51 percent of the silver was 
extracted from the samples tested by G&T and SGS.  

Average performance for each deposit and ore type is summarized in Table 13-10. Results 
show that samples that have poor bulk flotation response (FeOx, QSB, MnO, and PG) tended to 
respond more favorably to cyanidation. It may be possible to take advantage of this by pursuing 
a flowsheet involving cyanidation of flotation tailings.

 Cyanidation Leaching of Flotation Tailings 13.6.3

The opportunity to process Corani mineralization using a combination of flotation and 
cyanidation was only evaluated by Dawson Metallurgical Laboratories in 2006. In that program, 
Dawson tested only two samples using this methodology. The silver recovery was superior to 
that obtained by the use of either flotation or cyanidation alone. Further testing would be 
required to determine if this flowsheet option has merit across a broad range of samples. 

 Previous Metallurgical Recovery Model 13.7

Discrete mineral domains were used to assign metallurgical performance in the previous 
feasibility study (M3, 2011). Previously, nine mineral types were identified for the Corani 
deposit. These mineral types were grouped into four metallurgical categories, and each 
category was assigned an average recovery or a grade-dependent recovery. These domains 
were defined by BCM geologists based on review of the drill core and development of cross-
sections of the deposit using professional judgement. From the cross-sections, solids of the 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 100 

domains were created and used to assign metallurgical parameters to the block model. While 
the current geometallurgical approach supercedes this methodology for predicting metal 
recoveries; it is important to mention the previous work as the mineral domains are still relevant 
to the understanding of the Corani deposit mineral zonation and metallurgical responses. 

Though these mineralization types generally indicated metallurgical performance, the behaviour 
for samples within each metallurgical type was highly variable, particularly within the mixed 
oxide/sulphide types (FBS).  

Detailed analysis of the mineralogical test data suggested that these mineralogical domains did 
not fully capture the transitional nature of the Corani deposit. New analysis of the metallurgical, 
QEMSCAN, and geologic data (presented in Section 13.8) indicated that much of the Corani ore 
is transitional material that ranges from slightly to strongly oxidized. Since metallurgical recovery 
is strongly related to the degree of oxidation, it was necessary to develop a new 
geometallurgical model that could represent variations in oxidation throughout the ore body, 
which are highly variable and inconsistent both vertically and horizontally. A new 
geometallurgical model was developed that utilizes mineralogy and other factors to provide 
more accurate predictions of metallurgical recovery. Those factors include elevation, zinc grade, 
and logged geologic data, especially key minerals such as galena, pyrite, goethite, and 
manganese oxides. These parameters serve as indicators for the degree of oxidation that has 
occurred and allow for a continuous estimate of metallurgical parameters. The new model 
provides a more accurate representation of the deposit's metallurgical response, particularly for 
the transitional material because it has the ability to represent the gradational boundary 
between sulfide and oxide material indicated by mineralogical data. 

 Optimized and Current Continuous Predictive Metallurgical Model 13.8

Corani is a silver-lead-zinc deposit that exhibits a high degree of variability with respect to 
metallurgical test results. Most of the metallurgical testing was based on composites 
constructed by geological classification. Some of the classifications were suitable for 
categorizing metallurgical response, for example, composites of CSC (Coarse grained silica-
sulphide-celadonite) consistently performed very well. However, one of the categories which 
represented nearly half of the resource tonnage (FBS) had large ranges in metallurgical 
performance.  

GRE and Tom Shouldice (TS) conducted an evaluation of the geometallurgy for the Corani 
Project to address recommendations made by Blue Coast Metallurgy (Blue Coast Metallurgy, 
2011) in conjunction with the test results described above regarding metal recovery projections. 
At the time of the 2011 Feasibility Study, four geometallurgical types had been identified, and 
average recoveries were assigned to these material types for reserve calculations and mine 
planning, as described above. These geometallurgical types represented varying degrees of 
oxidation and as a result, distinct differences in metallurgical behaviour were observed between 
types. However, within each assigned met type, large ranges in recovery were observed. To 
further refine metallurgical recovery projections, the available metallurgical, mineralogical, 
geological, and spatial data were extensively reviewed. 

A statistical analysis was completed by GRE indicating that several measurable geological 
parameters could be used to make metallurgical predictions.  

A number of advanced statistical methods were used to better understand the drivers of 
metallurgical behaviour and identify data within the existing drill hole database that could be 
used to predict recovery for the deposit. These methods included cluster analysis and recursive 
partitioning. Since the conceptual understanding of the Corani deposit relies on various types of 
mineralization, it is expected that characteristics that drive recovery within one mineralization 
may be different or have a different magnitude in another mineralization. This was previously 
recognized from a qualitative standpoint (i.e., the qualitative assignment of Met types I through 
IV). The advanced statistical methods allow for a quantitative assessment of this behaviour.  

Using these methods, zinc grade, elevation, oxide minerals, pyrite, and the form of lead (galena 
vs. phosphate) were identified as the best predictors of lead recovery; zinc grade, elevation,

copper grade, and pyrite were identified as the best predictors of zinc recovery; and lead 
recovery was identified as the best predictor of silver recovery in the lead concentrate. To model 
the complex relationship between these parameters and recovery, multivariate adaptive 
regression splines were used to develop a model capable of predicting recoveries based on this 
data. Multivariate adaptive regression splines are a form of multiple regressions that has the 
flexibility to model non-linear relationships between variables. The method also uses data 
partitioning, which allows the model to identify characteristics within the dataset that potentially 
lead to different outcomes.  

Though this method appears complex, it combines the benefits of a model based on ore type 
characterization (Met Types I –Met Type IV) and a model using regression. It partitions data 
based on similarities (similar to ore type characterization) and develops a regression model for 
predicting a continuous recovery result (similar to regression modelling). The result is a single 
model equation that can be used to predict recovery across all ore types. 

To select a robust model, subsets of the dataset were selected randomly and used to develop a 
calibrated model; the remaining data was used as a "blind" dataset to validate the model. This 
was done 1000 times, and the best performing model (based on calibration and validation 
results) was selected as the final model.  

To create an overall balance for lead, silver, and zinc, the concentrates were assumed to be 
constant grade. The grades of the concentrates were determined by the averages of locked-
cycle testing.  

The sections below give a brief summary of each model used for recovery predictions. 
Additional details regarding the complete statistical analysis were reported by GRE in a 
separate document. 

 Recovery of Lead to Lead Concentrate 13.8.1

The model for predicting lead recovery to the lead rougher concentrate included the following 
variables: 

 Zinc feed grade 

 Mine elevation 

 Geological logging estimates of galena, goethite, manganese oxide and pyrite.  

 

To ensure the robustness of the selected regression parameters, 70% of the data was randomly 
selected (the training dataset) and used to estimate the regression parameters; the remaining 
30% (the validation dataset) was used to validate the model. This process was repeated 1000 
times. The model with the most stable regression parameters and best calibration-validation 
performance was selected. The R2 of the training dataset for the selected model was 0.77, and 
the R2 of the validation dataset was also 0.77. The R2 considering all of the data (both 
validation and calibration data) was 0.77. The performance of the model for the validation 
dataset and across all data is shown in Figure 13-12. The colors in the figure represent the 
mineralization types assigned to samples using the prior geometallurgical approach.

Predicted lead rougher recoveries were compared to the final lead concentrate recoveries 
observed during locked-cycle tests for the 12 samples in which both locked- cycle test and 
batch test results were available. The results indicate that the model developed using lead 
rougher results from batch testing is a good predictor of final lead concentrate recovery. A 
comparison of observed lead rougher recoveries from batch testing, predicted lead rougher 
recoveries from batch testing, and observed final lead concentrate recoveries is shown in Figure 
13-13. 

Figure 13-13: Comparison of Predicted and Observed Lead Recovery from LCT 

 
 

Based on the LCT analysis, the final lead recovery to the lead/silver concentrate was calculated 
using the following equation:

 Silver Recovery 13.8.2
 

A cursory analysis of silver revealed that the strongest predictor of silver recovery was lead 
recovery. The relationship between silver and lead recovery to the lead rougher is shown in 
Figure 13-14. Though one major outlier does exist, due to the large number of samples, the 
equation is not strongly influenced by this observation. 
 

Figure 13-14: Silver Recovery  to Lead Rougher 

 

The predicted silver recoveries were compared to LCT test results for samples where batch 
results and LCT results were available. Silver recovery to the lead rougher was estimated using 
predicted lead recovery to the lead rougher. The results show that the difference between the 
predicted silver recovery to the lead rougher and the observed silver recovery to the final 
silver/lead concentrate is on average 11.5%. This difference is assumed to represent the loss of 
silver during the lead cleaning stage. The final predicted silver recovery to the lead concentrate 
was estimated by subtracting 11.5% from the predicted silver recovery to the lead rougher. This 
yields an estimate of final silver recovery that closely matches the observed LCT test results 
(Figure 13-15).

Based on the LCT analysis, the final silver recovery to the lead/silver concentrate was 
calculated using the following equation: 
 
                                                                             

This is the same equation presented above (see Figure 13-14), for predicting silver recovery to 
the lead rougher, with the intercept adjusted to account for the loss of silver during the cleaning 
stage. This equation was used to assign final silver recoveries for the lead/silver concentrate to 
the Corani block model. 

 Zinc Recovery 13.8.3

Regression analysis for zinc was performed using "total floatable zinc," which is the sum of the 
zinc that reports to the lead rougher and the zinc that reports to the zinc rougher during batch 
flotation testing. Non-floatable zinc, which is zinc that does not float in the lead rougher or zinc 
rougher, reports to the final zinc rougher tail. The difference between total floatable zinc and 
zinc recovered to the final zinc concentrate is the sum of the zinc that is recovered in the final 
lead/silver concentrate and the zinc removed during the zinc cleaning stage (cleaner tail). A 
schematic indicating the modelled recovery ("total floatable zinc") is shown in Figure 13-16. 

Figure 13-16: Schematic Indicating "Total Flotable Zinc" for Batch Tests 

 

Based on the results from the above analysis, tests with lime additions to the lead rougher 
greater than 2,000 g/t were removed from the model dataset. From this test database, the test 
representing the best total zinc recovery result was selected for each sample. Also, as was 
done for the lead analysis, samples representing composites from multiple drill holes were 
removed from the potential training dataset. The resulting dataset included 58 of the original 72 
samples considered for analysis.  

To select the most robust model, a cross-validation process similar to the process employed for 
lead was used to develop the model for total floatable zinc. From the dataset, 70% of the 
samples were randomly selected to fit the model and the remaining 30% were used to validate 
the model. This process was completed 1000 times with 1000 different permutations of the 
dataset.  

The independent variable combinations selected most frequently for the 1000 permutations 
were used for the final recovery equation. This combination had the highest validation and 
training set R

included zinc grade, elevation, copper, and pyrite in the following form:

between 0 and 100%, the training R

 improved to 0.93; the overall R2 remained the same.  

The performance of the model for the validation dataset and across all data is shown in Figure 
13-17. 

Figure 13-17: Selected Model with Training Data and Validation Data 

 

The results from the model were compared to the locked-cycle test results for the 8 samples 
where zinc recovery was reported. The average difference between the locked-cycle tests and 
the predicted total floatable zinc was 22.5%. This difference is anticipated to represent the zinc 
that reports to the final lead concentrate and the zinc that is lost during the zinc cleaning stage.  

Three LCT test results were notable for lower-than-expected zinc recovery. The difference 
between the predicted total zinc recovery and the observed LCT recovery for samples K, R, and 
LC Main 1 were on average 34.5%, while the difference between the LCT zinc recovery and 
predicted total zinc recovery for the remaining samples was only 15.2%.  

A comparison between the calculated final zinc concentrate recovery from batch tests is shown 
in Figure 13-18. The LCT result for these samples is much lower than what was achieved in 
batch testing. The remaining samples show a good match between the LCT result and batch 
testing. Considering this, the adjustment of 22.5% to the predicted total floatable zinc may be an 
over-estimate of the zinc lost to the lead rougher and the zinc lost to the zinc cleaner tail.

A final zinc concentrate recovery was predicted based on the total predicted zinc recovery (Zn 
Ro+ Pb Ro) minus 15.2%, which is the average difference between the predicted recovery and 
the LCT zinc concentrate recovery result (not including samples R, K, and LC Main 1). The LCT 
zinc concentrate recovery, predicted total recovery, and predicted recovery to zinc concentrate 
are shown in Figure 13-19.

 Zinc Recovery to Final Zinc Concentrate 13.8.4

Based on the LCT analysis, the final zinc recovery to the zinc concentrate was calculated using 
the following equation: 

 
                                       

              (           )          (                )

           (             ) 

This is the same equation already presented for predicting total floatable zinc, with the intercept 
adjusted to account for the difference between total floatable zinc and final zinc recovery to the

zinc concentrate (~15.2%). This equation was used to assign final zinc recoveries for the zinc 
concentrate to the Corani block model. 

 Zinc Displacement to Lead/Silver Concentrate 13.8.5

Based on the LCT results, the average displacement of zinc in the final lead/silver concentrate 
is 9%. Batch test results revealed that, in general, the lead cleaning stage was relatively 
effective in removing zinc from the final lead concentrate. Of the 97 batch tests used to create 
the lead rougher recovery model, 21 reported displacements for zinc in the lead concentrate 
following the cleaning stage. The average zinc displacement among these tests was 9.3%. With 
the exception of 2 outliers, most samples have zinc recoveries below 15%. Over 80% of the 
samples have zinc recoveries to the lead cleaner of less than 10%.  

From these results, a recovery of zinc to the final lead concentrate was estimated to be roughly 
9%.  

 Silver Recovery to Zinc Concentrate 13.8.6

Based on the tests used in the total floatable zinc model analysis, there does not appear to be a 
strong relationship between silver recovery to the zinc concentrate and zinc grades. Therefore, 
the zinc concentrate was assumed to contain an average silver grade. The grade was an 
average of the values determined in the locked-cycle testing. Silver recovery was then 
calculated once the zinc recovery and zinc concentrate mass was estimated from the zinc 
model. 

 Model Output Results 13.8.7

The models for recovery, along with the concentrate grade estimates, were input into the block 
modelling process to optimize the mining process. For the purposes of this study, the lead 
concentrate grade was assumed to be constant at 56.6% (average of all locked-cycle tests). 
Similarly the zinc concentrate grade was assumed to be 52.9% and contained 385 g/tonne 
silver (averages of all locked-cycle tests). 

The block model simulation with the metallurgical models in place resulted in several pit shells 
at different revenue factors. Using the mine plan with revenue factor of 100, the estimates of 
metal recoveries were determined by mine operating year. These values are displayed for the 
lead concentrate and zinc concentrate in Table 13-11 and Table 13-12, respectively. Compared 
to the previous study (M3, 2011), the average lead recovery was reduced by 8% while the silver 
and zinc recovery both increased by 8%.

The result of this work is a reliable, predictive geometallurgical model that has significantly 
improved predictions of metallurgical recovery which can be used in mine planning and grade 
control (Figure 13-20). The previous geometallurgical model relied on assigning average 
recovery values to large volumes of material based on ore type. Anticipated recoveries based 
on the new model closely fit recoveries observed during metallurgical testing. The recovery 
projections (based on the new model) for over half the samples tested is within +/-9% of the 
observed test recovery for lead, within +/-7% of the observed test recovery for silver, and within 
5% of the observed test recovery for zinc.

14 Mineral Resource Estimates 

GRE estimated the Mineral Resources for the Corani Project in the first quarter of 2015. No new 
drilling or geologic information has been completed since the May 30, 2015 Optimized and Final 
Feasibility Study Technical Report was prepared. The resource model created in 2015 was 
used unchanged as the basis for the new Front End Engineering Design work and Technical 
Report. The following describe the estimation of Mineral Resources that was performed in 2015 
and documented in the May 30, 2015 Technical Report. 

A block model of the Corani deposit was developed as the basis for determination of the Mineral 
Reserves and Mineral Resources. This section summarizes the development of the block model 
as well as the development of the mineral resource. BCM's block model was updated by GRE to 
include drill hole data gathered since the 2011 model was created. The updated data also 
included new geologic cross-sections and updates to the mineral domains. Also, per previous 
authors' recommendations, the density model was updated with a statistical analysis of the 
relationship between metal grades and specific gravity. The drill hole database was updated 
with geologic logs and assays of primary recovery indicators: copper, goethite, manganese 
oxide, pyrite, and galena. These new grade labels were modeled along with the economically 
viable metals in the block model. 

 Block Model 14.1

The block model was developed using blocks sized 15 x 15 m in plan and 8 m high. The 
selection of the 8-m bench height was based on a study of dilution versus bench height and 
consideration of the mining equipment that might be used in the future for open pit production. 

The model area is divided into three areas shown in Figure 14-1: Main, Minas, and Este. The 
model is large enough to contain all reasonable open pit configurations for the three resource 
areas. The total model size and block size are summarized in Table 14-1.

The model was assembled in the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and 
is parallel to the UTM grid. Topographic information was assigned to the model based on 
topographic maps provided by BCM. The topography maps were consistent with field 
observations and the elevations of the drill holes at their coordinates. 

 Rock Type Boundaries 14.1.1

The Corani deposit lithology is comprised of Tertiary pre-mineral tuff and post-mineral tuff 
overlying Paleozoic sedimentary units. 

The mineralized volcanic tuff was emplaced prior to mineralizing events (pre-mineral), and 
contains the economic minerals of interest. Post-mineral volcanic tuff is barren and was 
emplaced subsequent to the mineralizing events. The mineral reserves and resources are 
completely contained within the pre-mineral tuff. 

The basement sediments at Corani are generally barren, although there are local occurrences 
of mineralization within those units. Potential exists for additional mineralization to be found in 
the sediments. However, for this block model they were assumed to be barren and grades were 
not estimated.  

Blocks were coded as: 11 = post-mineral volcanics, 20 = pre-mineral volcanics, 31 = sediments. 
Unassigned blocks do exist outside of the interpreted area. The blocks that did not receive a 
rock type assignment were assigned a default average density in case they were mined as 
waste within the Whittle optimized pit shell or mine plan. 

As part of the resource estimation process, BCM updated cross-sections of the drill hole data in 
each of the deposits and redrew the mineralization boundaries for each of the mineralization 
domains within the Corani pre-mineral rock units, with the intent of using the solids as domains 
for grade and recovery estimation.  

GRE used the drill hole data, cross-sections with geologic mineralization polygons, geologic 
logs, and a previously developed and coded block model containing codes for sediments, pre- 
and post-mineral tuff, and overburden/bofedal provided by BCM. This data and the previous 
block model codes were verified, and solids were created from mineralization polygons. 
Geologic log data were also entered in electronic form. The solids were extrapolated a sufficient 
distance beyond the outside drill holes so as not to limit the ability to assign rock type or grade 
when grade estimation was completed. 

The mineralization solids were checked by generating cross-sections through each of the three 
areas. The solids were initially used to assign mineralization type to the metallurgical test data. 
The geometallurgical data analysis is described in more detail in Sections 7 and 13 of this 
report. Results of that work demonstrated that the mineralization solids were not good 
predictors of recovery and that a continuous statistical model could be used with better results. 
Geostatistics of the assay data from the mineralization domains were evaluated, and it was 
determined that they could be lumped together to form larger, more-contiguous solids, which 
were used during the estimation of silver, lead, and zinc grades. These groupings generally 
represent weathered and oxidized rocks, transition or supergene-enriched mineralization, and 
unaltered sulphide mineralization. The geometallurgical analysis resulted in recovery equations 
for silver, lead, and zinc, which were estimated for each block of the block model. 

Figure 14-2: is an example of the geologic assignment of the mineral domains to the model 
blocks on cross-section.

 Density Assignment 14.1.2

Density was based on the combined grade of silver, lead, and zinc. The silver was converted to 
a percent assay to get common units with lead and zinc. The combined grade and density 
showed a break at 0.9381%. Blocks with a combined grade under 0.9381% were assigned a 
density of 2.31 t/m

3
, and blocks with a combined grade greater than or equal to 0.9381% were 

assigned a density of 2.43 t/m
3
. Post-mineral tuff with no metal grades to analyse was assigned 

an average density of 2.3 t/m
3
 and non-tuff material was assigned an average density of 2.53 

t/m3.

 Block Grade Estimation 14.1.3

Block grades were estimated for silver, lead, zinc, copper, goethite, manganese oxide (MnOx), 
pyrite, and galena. The estimation zones were based on groups of the mineral domains. Coarse 
sulphides (CS/CSC), fine black sulphides (FBS), pyrite-marcasite (PM), and tetrahedrite (TET) 
were the first group. Iron oxides (FeOx), manganese oxide (MnOx), and plumbogummite (PG) 
were the second group. Quartz-sulphide-barite (QSB) was in its own, third group. These 
members of the groups were selected based on their similar characteristics and location relative 
to each other. Although QSB had similarities to the first group, it was geographically distinct 
from the sulphide-rich zones. 

Prior to compositing, individual assay values were cut to limit the influence of high-grade 
outliners on the block grade distribution. The cumulative frequency plot (CFP) of silver has a 
break at 1,410 ppm, and ten silver samples were capped at 1,410 ppm (Figure 14-3). Although 
there was a definite break on the copper CFP, it was only used as a recovery indicator, and the 
break was well above the indicator threshold. Thus, there was no need to cap copper assays. 
There was no cumulative frequency analysis on the goethite, MnOx, pyrite, and galena labels 
since there was no assay on those labels. 

The cumulative frequency plot of lead manifests itself as a continuous population with no 
discernible break. For this reason, lead was not capped before compositing. The CFP of zinc 
shows a continuous population similar to lead; therefore, it was not capped before compositing.

The Corani drill holes were composited to nominal 8-m down-hole or length composites 
respecting rock type. The composite lengths were slightly modified within each rock type to 
have composites of equal length that respected lithologic boundaries.  

The pre-mineral tuff is the unit of importance for potentially economic mineralization, and can be 
used as the example of the compositing process. Within each drill hole, the length of the 
intercept of pre-mineral tuff was determined, and that length was divided into equal-length 
composites of approximately 8 m. All composites within a rock type in the hole have the same 
length. That length could be something slightly more or less than the 8-m target value to define 
the rock type into an integer number of composites. This process eliminates the existence of a 
short or partial composite at the rock boundary. 

The 8-m value was selected based on a grade-versus-count evaluation of alternative composite 
lengths, to determine whether there was an improvement in ore selectivity with smaller 
composites versus the cost of production, compared with more cost-efficient use of longer 
composites and corresponding higher bench heights. The final selection of 8 m was also guided 
by the expected production rates and mine loading equipment that might be employed for 
production. 

Composite samples for silver, lead, zinc, copper, goethite, MnOx, pyrite, and galena were 
loaded into SAGE 2001 for variogram analysis and modeling. The composites were divided into 
groups for each resource area (Main, Minas, and Este) and subdivided into mineral groups. 
Group 1 consists of the following mineral domains: 1 – CS – Coarse Sulfide; 2 – CSC – Coarse 
Sulfide and Celadonite; 3 – FBS – Fine Black Sulfide; 8 – PM – Pyrite Marcasite; and 10 – TET 
– Tetrahedrite. Group 2 consists of these mineral domains: 4 – FeOX – Iron Oxide; 6 – MnO – 
Manganese Oxide; and 7 – PG – Plumbogummite. Group 3 consists of 9 – QSB – Crystalline 
quartz sulfide barite. These groups were created based on the relative locations of the mineral 
domains to each other. This created 9 composite groups for the 8 grade labels, resulting in 72 
total variograms to model. 

It was determined that a correlogram created the best fit for this set of data. Downhole 
correlograms were used to determine the nugget for each composite sample group. 
Experimental correlograms had search parameters set for 30-degree increments for azimuth

and 15-degree increments for dip. Omnidirectional correlograms were created for grade zones 
that did not have a distinct directional trend. These particular grade zones were modeled with 
isotropic parameters. The rest were modeled directionally to create anisotropic parameters for 
block modeling.  

Typically, the general trend of all the estimation zones followed the trend of the contact between 
pre-mineral tuff and post-mineral tuff, which is dip direction of 300 to 330 degrees azimuth and 
dipping 15 to 30 degrees down. This is in agreement with previous authors and BCM geologists. 
Silver, with a mobility different from lead and zinc, was estimated across mineral domain 
boundaries. The evidence of high silver grades in areas of expected low sulphidization and a 
smooth gradient of grades across mineral boundaries points to this as an appropriate modeling 
method. The method chosen for all grades was Inverse Distance to a Power (IDP), specifically 
ID3 for silver and ID2.5 for all others. This method was picked to model the high local variability 
of the drill hole data. By adjusting the power, a satisfactory level of smoothness was applied to 
the grade model. The IDP model was compared to a kriged model, and IDP was chosen due to 
the kriged model's failure to highlight the highest and lowest grades in the population. 

Figure 14-4 through Figure 14-24 present the correlograms for the three economically viable 
metals in each deposit zone and mineral domain (where applicable). Table 14-3 through Table 
14-12 show the parameters for input to the modeling software for all eight grade labels in the 
block model. These parameters were taken from the variography of the composite data. 
Notably, the search range was increased from the previous study. The range from the 
variography analysis showed that the model has a range of 180 m in two zones and 170 m in 
another zone for the silver models. Since silver is the primary metal in this project, a search 
range of 180 m was used for all grade labels to preserve uniformity of the number of blocks 
modeled.

 Classification 14.1.4

Blocks were coded as measured, indicated, or inferred based on the silver grade estimate. The 
number of samples and the distance to the nearest sample were the discriminating factors. 
Silver grades were estimated using a minimum of one composite and maximum of ten 
composites, with a maximum of three composites from one drill hole. If the number of composite 
samples is at least 6 and the distance to the nearest composite is less than 12 meters, the block 
is classified as measured. If the number of composite samples is at least 2, the distance to the 
nearest composite is less than 50 meters, and the block has not been classified as measured, 
the block is classified as indicated. All other blocks with an estimated silver grade are classified 
as inferred. 

 Metallurgical Recovery Estimate 14.1.5

Prior estimates used mineralization codes that were assigned to the block model based on ore 
mineralogy and categorizing the metallurgical responses of the deposit. Following a detailed 
geometallurgical analysis, this approach was modified and replaced with one using a statistical 
model with zinc grade, elevation, and geologic log data (i.e., pyrite %, galena %, MnO, etc) to 
create a continuous recovery model/formula for each of the metals. Application of this method 
resulted in generation of the following formulas for the prediction of metals recoveries.

Note: Maximum Lead Recovery is 98% and minimum Lead Recovery is 2%. Also note, a small 
error in the calculation of the elevation component was found in the 2017 FEED, where the 
block elevation used in the Micromodel software estimate of recovery was one block low (8 
meters). This caused a slightly low (~1%) recovery for blocks above the thresholds (4891 and 
4901) and was corrected in the 2017 model.

lead were presented in Section 7 (Figure 7-9 and Figure 7-10). The cross-sections show how 
the updated model can capture spatial variability in recovery and provides improved resolution 
relative to the old model based on discrete geometallurgical categories.

 Acid Rock Drainage 14.2

To use waste rock for construction of the dump, backfill cap, embankment dams, etc., there 
needed to be a way to distinguish non-acid-generating rock (NAG) from potentially acid-
generating rock (PAG). For this purpose, GRE developed an acid rock drainage (ARD) block 
model using available geochemical sample data collected by Vector in 2009, GRE in 2011, and 
AMEC in 2012. 

Various analyses were performed on each sample group, including full Acid-Base Accounting 
(ABA) analysis, whole rock analysis, metals by aqua regia digestion, and total carbon/total 
sulphur assay by LECO furnace. A summary of each sample group and analysis is given in 
Table 14-13.

The parameters selected for inclusion in the model included AP/total sulphur, NP, pH, and 
metals of concern, which are described in the Geochemical Characterization Report (GRE, 
2012) and include arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc. 

For the parameters considered, comparable analyses from different labs (i.e., total sulphur/total 
sulphur/ S-%) were matched, and results were converted to consistent units. GRE developed 
linear models relating to ABA, AP, and total sulphur by LECO furnace by rock type for samples 
collected by Vector in 2009 and GRE in 2011. These relationships were used to predict AP for 
samples where only LECO furnace total sulphur/carbon was analysed. AP was predicted only 
for samples from rock types PM, FeO, and FBS, for which the relationship between total sulphur

The geochemical samples were loaded into TECHBASE and composited to 8-meter intervals 
along lithology boundaries. Inverse distance cubed weighting was used to estimate constituent 
concentrations in all model blocks contained within a wireframe boundary based on geologic 
boundaries of the project mineralized bodies. For each block in the block model, 2 to 8 samples 
were considered within a search ellipsoid, and a weighted average of the parameter of concern 
was calculated. 

Using this model, the spatial variation of acid-generating waste rock within the pit and in the pit 
walls was determined. Material with an estimated net neutralizing potential less than -20 
tonnes/kilotonne was designated as potentially acid generating; material with an estimated net 
neutralizing potential greater than -20 tonnes/kilotonne was designated as non-acid generating. 

 Mineral Resources 14.3

The mineral resources were developed with the Whittle multi-algorithm software suite to 
determine the component of the deposit with reasonable prospects of economic extraction. For 
the resource pit shell, economic benefit was applied to inferred mineralization. However, no 
economic benefit was applied to inferred mineralization in the later determination of mineral 
reserves or in the economic analysis of the project. 

The Whittle computer algorithm is a tool used to guide mine design. The algorithm applies 
approximate costs and recoveries along with approximate pit slope angles to establish 
theoretical economic breakeven pit wall locations that result in a maximum pit value.  

The Whittle algorithm was also used as a guide to the design of the final mineral reserve pit. 
The detailed cost and process response input parameters for the mineral reserves are

presented in Section 15. The majority of that information was also used as input for the 
determination of mineral resources.  

The economic input for mineral resource determination was identical to that applied to the 
mineral reserve, with the following exceptions: 

1) The resource Whittle pit shell did receive economic credit for inferred-class material. 
Inferred was treated as waste for the mineral reserve. 

2) The Mineral Resources were generated within the $30.00 silver, $1.425 lead, and $1.50 
zinc price pit shell and the calculated $11/tonne NSR cut-off (see Table 14-16). 

3) The Mineral Resource contains potentially leachable material processed at $4.82/tonne and 
above a 15 g/tonne silver cut-off (Table 14-17). This Resource is contained within the 
Whittle pit shell but is not included in Table 14-16. The Mineral Reserve does not include 
any potentially leachable material. 

The resource statement on Table 14-16 includes the mineral reserves that are presented in 
Section 15. 

The qualified person responsible for the estimation of the Mineral Resource was Terre Lane. 
Metal price changes could materially change the estimated mineral resources in either a 
positive or negative way. 

At this time, there are no unique situations relative to environmental, permitting, legal, title, 
taxation, political, or socioeconomic conditions that would put the Corani mineral resource at a 
higher level of risk than any other Peruvian developing resource.

Figure 14-29, Figure 14-30, and Figure 14-31 compare cumulative frequencies of silver, lead, 
and zinc. Each plot shows the cumulative frequency of composite grades, nearest-neighbour 
block grades, inverse distance block grades, and kriged block grades. The plots show how a 
nearest-neighbour model estimate follows the trends of the composite assay data very closely 
in all of the metal models. The inverse distance and kriged models show how, once spatial 
variability is applied, the frequency plot of the population takes on the smoothed distribution that 
is expected of a grade model. 

Figure 14-32 and Figure 14-33 are examples of a plan and cross-section of the block model 
with drill hole intercepts plotted with composite assay data and the block grade model for silver. 
The visual inspection shows how the model agrees with the assay data and smooths the grade 
among input data points.

15 Mineral Reserve Estimates 

GRE has reviewed and verified that the mine design, Mineral Reserve Estimate, and production 
schedule generated by GMI and GyM have been prepared with sound engineering principles 
and are correct. The work uses the Mineral Resource block model created by GRE in 2015 as a 
basis for the work. GRE has found the work performed by GMI/GyM for the Detailed 
Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) to be well done and thorough, and the Mineral Reserves stated 
herein represent a slightly improved mine plan over the GRE 2015 Feasibility Study Estimate. 
GMI/GyM used $20.00/oz silver, $1.00/lb zinc, and $0.95/lb lead for the mine design, and 
economic model base case metal prices of $18.00/oz silver, $1.10/lb zinc, and $0.95/lb lead. 
The mine plan also uses a variable cut-off value higher than the economic cut-off value (these 
cut-offs would be equivalent to the economic cut-off calculated at significantly higher metal 
prices). This combined approach utilizing higher metal prices for the pit design and lower metal 
prices in the economic model is excellent for projects nearing production in a potential rising 
metal price environment, as it is can be difficult or impossible to make small changes to the pit 
design and size after mining begins because of bench width and equipment maneuvering 
requirements. The elevated cut-off increases cash flow, reduces risk, and improves the 
economic performance of the project.  

The following text describes the work done by GMI/GyM. 

The mineral reserve is the total of all proven- and probable-category ore that is planned for 
production. The mine design and mine plan presented in Section 16 details the production of 
that reserve. The mineral reserve was established by tabulating the contained tonnes of 
measured and indicated material (proven and probable) within the designed final pit geometry 
that are fed to the process plant in the economic model. The final pit design and the internal 
phase designs were guided by the results of Whittle pit optimization analyses. 

 Introduction 15.1

As part of the Front End Engineering Design being undertaken by GMI for Bear Creek Mining´s 
Corani Project, GyM has carried out the mining engineering design aspects of the project. The 
mine, located between 4,800 and 5,000 m above sea level in the Andes mountains of Peru, will 
be an open pit polymetallic operation, producing Pb/Ag and Zn Concentrates. 

GyM has used the geological block model from the 2015 Feasibility Study and re-optimised the 
project, using updated parameters. A major change compared to the 2015 Feasibility Study is 
the decision to not mine the upper and lower bofedals and the natural wall of rock which 
separate them. This has resulted in two separate pits (East and Minas/Main) separated by the 
bofedals, which removes operational risk associated with mining of bofedals and will make the 
overall project simpler. 

Based on the updated mine design, a mine schedule and process plant feed schedule has been 
developed to maximize the project value. Capital, Sustaining Capital, and Operating costs have 
been estimated based on the mine schedule, for owner operator and contractor scenarios. 

 Pit Optimization 15.2

 Block Model 15.2.1

The resource block model used was supplied by Bear Creek Mining, and is called GAP 
Solutions_V2.csv (file size 560.387Mb). The coordinate system of the resource block model is 
PSAD56. The block model consists of blocks which measure 15 m (north - south) x 15 m (east – 
west) x 8 m (vertical). 

It was not within the scope of the FEED study to review the model from a geological or resource 
classification perspective. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 137 

For the FEED study, the resource block model was modified slightly, creating the model used in 
the FEED Corani_geo162612_B.csv. The purpose of modifying the model was to correct some 
minor inconsistencies and to create fields that were required as part of the FEED. The 
modifications are documented in reports 161655-050-15-INF-0001_Rev 0 (Preparación de 
Modelo Geológico) and 161655-050-15-INF-0002_Rev 0 (Preparación de Modelo 
Planeamiento). 

The modified resource block model, Corani_geo162612_B.csv, has the fields and descriptions 
shown in Table 15-1.

 Topography 15.2.2

The topographic surface used with the bock model and for optimization and mine design 
consisted of the following files. These files are from the 2015 Feasibility Study and are in the 
WGS84 system. For the FEED, they were converted to PSAD56 (using ArcGIS software) for 
use with the block model. 

 corani pit area topo – trimmed by MES and cloud fixed.dxf 

 corani_1m_contours_north.dwg

 corani_10m_contours.dwg 

 corani_50m_contours.dwg 

Once the mine design was competed, all designs were converted back to the WGS84 system 
for incorporation into the overall project. 

It is recommended that before construction commences, Bear Creek Mining convert the block 
model to the WGS84 system. This may require surveying of exploration drill hole collars in the 
field to determine their coordinates in the WGS84 system and so should be done prior to 
construction as some hole collars are likely to get destroyed. 

 Optimisation Parameters 15.2.3

Pit optimisations were undertaken using Whittle software (Lerch Grossman algorithm), and 
SimSched (a direct block scheduling software) to identify final pit limits. Following design of the 
final pit, and internal phases, Comet software was used to determine the mining sequence 
which maximizes the project NPV when taking into account physical constraints applied. For all 
three processes, the following revenue, processing, cost, and geotechnical parameters detailed 
in report 161655-2300-15-CD-001 Rev0 (Mine Optimisation and Planning Input) were used. 
Only a brief summary is given here, and the reader is directed to the relevant report for more 
detail. 

15.2.3.1 Revenue Parameters 

All revenue factors have been taken from the report "Optimized and Final Feasibility Study" (M3, 
30 May 2015). Table 15-2 shows the metal prices used. 

Table 15-2: Revenue Factors 

Metal Unit Reserves 

Lead $/lb 0.95 

Zinc $/lb 1.00 

Silver $/oz 20.00 

The Detailed Design Phase 1 (FEED) economic model uses slightly lower metal prices of 
$18.00/oz silver, $1.10/lb zinc, and $0.95 lead and uses cut-off grades higher than the 
economic cut-off.  

Selling costs have been taken from the report "Marketing and Sales Cost Study on Corani 
Pb/Ag and Zn Concentrates" (Andes Mining Research, Dec 2014), provided by Bear Creek 
Mining, and include the treatment charges and refining charges shown in Table 15-3.

Other costs associated with selling, freight, penalties, and royalties / taxes are detailed in report 
161655-2300-15-CD-001 Rev0 (Mine Optimisation and Planning Input). 

15.2.3.2 Processing Parameters 

The processing plant throughput used was 7.875 Mt (dry) per year. The project is considered to 
be "processing limited" in Whittle, rather than being limited by mining or selling capacity. 

For optimization work, blocks coded as Post-mineralization and Pre-mineralization were 
considered for processing, whilst blocks coded as Cover or Basement Sediments were treated 
as waste. Note: in the final mine schedule and processing schedule, the Post-mineralization 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 139 

material was considered as waste. The quantity of this material that was reclassified from ore to 
waste was on the order of 2.1 Mt and is considered minor in relation to the overall project. 

The following formulae, sourced from the report "Optimized and Final Feasibility Study" (M3, 30 
May 2015) were used for calculating recoveries to the Pb-Ag and Zn concentrates. 
 
             

              (          )         (             )

       ) 

Note: Maximum Lead recovery was capped at 98%, and any recoveries less than 2% were 
considered to be 0%.

    (            )           (            )        
    (         )             (         ) 

Note: Maximum Zinc recovery was capped at 83%, and any recoveries less than 0% were 
considered to be 0%. 

 
                                            (                                   ) 

Note that in the case of silver, for the final concentrate production schedule, which was 
developed following the optimization, mine design, and mine schedule stages, the total silver 
recovered (according to the formulae above) was redistributed differently between the Pb-Ag 
and Zn concentrates, based on lock cycle test results documented in the report "Corani Geomet 
Block Model Resource ISSUED Sept 18 2015." The Ag grade in the Zn concentrate was 
lowered from 1,337 g/t to 385 g/t, with the difference being transferred to the Pb-Ag 
concentrate. This adjustment is consistent with that used in the report "Optimized and Final 
Feasibility Study" (M3, 30 May 2015). 

15.2.3.3 Cost Parameters 

Mining Costs 

Table 15-4 shows the mining costs used as input to the optimization process for material other 
than bofedal. The mining cost input used for bofedal material was $6.38/t(dry), consistent with 
the 2015 feasibility study.

Following the end of mining at Main and Minas Pits, these pits must be backfilled (with waste 
sourced from the Main Waste Dump) to approximately 4,855 masl as stated in the Feasibility 
Study. Any block mined below this level at these pits creates a future backfilling cost. For 
optimizations, a further mining cost of $1.00/t (dry) was added to blocks below this level to 
reflect the additional backfill cost generated. 

Processing Costs 

The processing costs are shown in Table 15-5.

Processing Operating Cost (Direct and Indirect Cost) Processing 8.76 

Sustaining Capex Cost 0.15

Total 10.00 

The input value for the Processing Operating Cost and the Sustaining Capex Cost come from 
the Feasibility Study. The Tailings Transport and Placement Cost is a new cost that has been 
added as part of the FEED, and the input cost was estimated to be $1.09/t (dry) processed by 
calculating typical haul cycles and productivities to the centroid of the Main Mine Waste and 
Filtered Tailings Deposit, and applying equipment costs. An Ore Premium cost was subtracted 
from the processing cost of $10.00/t (dry) as the cost of hauling material to the process plant 
crusher is less than hauling it to the waste dump. A general and administration cost of $1.55/t 
(dry) processed was added to the processing cost as the project is considered "processing 
limited." 

15.2.3.4 Geotechnical Parameters 

The McDonald Engineering report (Open Pit Geotechnical Study – Draft – June 2012) was used 
as the basis for pit optimization and design. 

The overall and inter-ramp angles (IRA) used are shown in the table below, taken from Table 
8.1 of the McDonald report. 

As McDonald did not mention the bofedals that may intersect the final pit limits (upper, lower, 
and several other smaller bofedals), 15 degrees was used, the same as in the "Optimized and 
Final Feasibility Study" (M3, 30 May 2015). Table 15-6 shows the slope used.

 Whittle Optimization Results 15.2.4

For each block in the resource model, the Net Smelter Return (NSR) was calculated. Net 
Smelter Return is the net revenue less freight, smelting, and refining costs and deductions. 

Optimizations were undertaken in Whittle software for 41 different cases to determine 
sensitivities to resource classification, metal prices, types of lithology processed, mining costs, 
processing + G&A costs, recoveries, pit wall angles, and not mining of the principal bofedals. 

The Whittle input parameters and results are shown in Table 15-7 and are compared with the 
parameters and results from the 2015 Feasibility Study. In this comparison, the upper and lower 
bofedals are mined in both cases, and results shown are for the revenue factor 1.00 shell. The 
FEED results are from Whittle run 3.

Comparing the FEED optimization results for Case 3, at a 1.00 revenue factor, with the 
comparable shell generated during the Feasibility Study, Case 3 has 32.9 Mt (17%) less ore, 
and the metal content is 10% less on average. The undiscounted cash flow of the FEED Case 3 
shell $2,110 M and is $315 M less than the Feasibility Study of $2,425 M. This difference is 
primarily due to including the following relevant cost items in the optimization which were not 
included in the feasibility study optimizations: 

 Filtered tailings transport     M$171 

 Mining Fleet Capital and sustaining capital  M$80 

 Backfill of Minas and Main pits    M$29 

 Updated processing and G&A costs   M$34 

 Total         M$314 

Table 15-8 shows Whittle results for two further scenarios evaluated where the upper bofedal 
was not allowed to be mined and where both the upper and lower bofedals were not allowed to 
be mined, compared to the May 2015 Feasibility Study and the Base Case of the FEED study. 
The table shows that if the upper and lower bofedals are not mined, the undiscounted cashflow 
(based on the revenue factor 1.00 shells) would lower from $2,110 M to $2,048 M (3%).

In parallel, optimizations were also run in SimSched software, which is a direct block scheduler 
that aims to maximize the NPV of a project. Results for the case where the upper and lower 
bofedals are not mined were similar to the corresponding Whittle run 73 with a revenue factor of 
0.94. 

The whittle optimization and SimSched results are presented in detail in report 161655-050-15- 
INF-0003_Rev 0 (Construcción del Modelo Whittle). 

 Selection of Final Pit Limit 15.2.5

After reviewing the optimization results together with Bear Creek Mining, it was decided jointly 
to advance the project based on a pit design that does not mine the upper or lower bofedals at 
this stage, or the natural rock wall which separates them. The corresponding run in Whitttle is 
run 73. The key reasons for this decision were: 

 Not having pit walls located in bodedal material would eliminate the associated 
geotechnical risks 

 Eliminate operational and cost risks associated with mining of bofedal material 

 The reserves already published by Bear Creek Mining can be maintained without 
mining the bofedals 

 The bofedals and the ground beneath them could still be mined in the future if required. 

The Whittle shell selected was the revenue factor 1.00 shell, containing 145.9 Mt of ore above 
the economic break-even cut-off grade. This shell was selected to allow the use of higher cut-off 
grades in early periods and to give flexibility so the Zn/Pb ratio can be maintained above 0.4 
whenever possible, whilst maintaining the currently published reserve of 137.7 Mt of ore (NI 43- 
101 report, M3 Engineering, 2015). 

Figure 15-1 shows the Whittle shell (run 73, revenue factor 1.00) selected as the basis for the 
mine design.

 Final Pit Design 15.3.1

The final pit was designed based on the use of 135-t capacity haul trucks, with ramp widths of 
29 m in accordance with width requirements of the Peruvian mining regulations. Pit ramps are 
10%. Ramp width is narrower, allowing for single lane traffic, for the final 3 to 4 benches in each 
pit. Figure 15-3 shows the haul road dimensions for two-way traffic.

 Internal Phase Designs 15.3.2

To minimize initial pre-stripping requirements and target higher value ore in the early years, a 
series of internal pit phases has been developed. In total, there are 19 phases (9 at East pit, 7 
at Minas pit, 3 at Main pit). The different phases are shown in Figure 15-6, along with the 
distribution of NSR ($/t) for the bench 4,894 (note some phases are not mines on this particular 
bench). 

Figure 15-6: Pit Phases 

 

 Haul Road Design 15.3.3

A system of haul roads is required to link the open pits to the primary crusher, short term ore 
stockpile, and the Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit. Haul roads 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7 
(a total of 9.09 km) must be constructed during the pre-strip period. This will involve 1.334 Mt of 
cut and 5.440 Mt of fill. In addition, the primary crusher pad will require 0.352 Mt of fill during the 
pre-strip period. The excess fill (i.e., the portion not sourced directly from cut) of 4.558 Mt will be 
sourced from non-acid generating (NAG) waste from the East pit during the pre-strip period. 
Haul roads will be finished with 1 m of base where required (estimated at 25% of haul road 
length, as most haul roads are constructed from mine fill, which will not require a layer of base), 
and 0.4 m of wearing course. In areas of bofedal, these will be excavated to a depth of up to 3 
m and backfilled with layers of mine waste rock wrapped in geo-mesh and geo-textile. Culverts 
to direct the water from one side of the haul road to the other will be installed at approximately 
200-m spacings depending gradient and catchment area. 

Four further haul-roads (8, 9, 10, and 11, totaling 2.26 km) are required to be constructed during 
the operational life of the mine, in years three, five, and 11. 

The haul roads are shown on Figure 15-7.

 Short Term Stockpile Design 15.3.4

A short-term stockpile will be used during the pre-strip stage and first four years of production. 
The stockpile is located within the Minas pit limit (as shown in Figure 15-8), and is primarily 
used to maintain the Zn/Pb ratio above 0.4. The maximum capacity is 2.2 Mt.

 Mineral Reserves 15.4

The project Mineral Reserves consider only measured and indicated resource categories, which 
have been converted to proven and probable reserves categories, respectively. Mineral 
Reserves are defined as being the material to be fed to the process plant in the mine plan 
already described, and are demonstrated to be economically viable in the Detailed Design 
Phase 1 (FEED) economic model. The Mineral Reserves are shown in Table 15-11. 

At this time, there are no unique situations relative to mining, metallurgy, permitting, 
infrastructure, and other relevant factors that would put the Corani mineral reserve at a higher 
level of risk than any other Peruvian developing resource.

Notes: 

1) The Mineral Reserves have been estimated using the definitions of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and 
Petroleum (CIM). 

2) The Mineral Reserves have been estimated using the following metal prices: $20.00/oz Ag, $1.00/lb Zn, $0.95/lb Pb using a 
revenue factor 1.00 pit shell as a basis for the pit design. 

3) Only pre-mineral tuff type of material has been considered as reserves. 

4) NSR Cut-off grades used are equal or higher than: $11.11/t for the East Pit, and $11.26/t for Minas and Main pits. 

5) The effective date for these Mineral Reserves is 1 May 2017. 

6) Totals / Averages may not add up due to rounding of individual tonnes and grades. 

7) The tonnes and grades shown above are considered a Mineral Reserve because they have been demonstrated to be 
economically viable through the FEED study financial model using the following metal prices: $18.00/oz Ag, $1.10/lb Zn, 
$0.95/lb Pb. 

The Mineral Reserves from this FEED study differ only very slightly when compared to the 
Mineral Reserves detailed in the NI 43-101 report (M3 Engineering, 2015): the FEED study 
reserve tonnes are 101% of the NI43-101 tonnage, whilst the contained silver and lead metal is 
approximately 1% less, and the contained zinc metal is approximately 1.4% higher. The Mineral 
Reserves from the NI 43-101 report are shown in the table below.

16 Mining Methods 

The Corani deposit is planned to be mined using conventional open pit mining methods. The 
mine design and planning are based on the resource model and reserve estimate as indicated 
in the previous sections. 

 Summary 16.1

The mine plan considers extraction of the proven and probable ore material included in the 
mineral reserve presented in Section 15. The mine plan has been developed to deliver 7,875 
ktonnes of ore per year (22,500 tpd x 350 processing days) to the crusher for processing by 
flotation to produce two concentrates: 1) lead-silver, and 2) zinc-silver.  

The mine plan development included the following: 

 Ultimate pit design including benches, ramps, and haul roads (Section 15) 

 Pit phase design based on the incremental Whittle Shells (Section 15) 

 Detailed pit phase designs with benches, ramps, and haul roads (Section 15) 

 Phase Design 

 Mine production scheduling 

 Waste storage design and material allocation 

 Time sequence mine plan drawing development 

 Equipment and manpower requirement calculations 

The following sections detail the development of the mine plan. 

 Phase Design and Pre-stripping 16.2

Pre-striping of 12.317 Mt, over a period of 14 months, is required to allow sustainable mine 
production to commence in May 2021, which coincides with the date the process plant will be 
ready to start its ramp-up. Pre-stripping will be conducted in two distinct phases, with a 
considerable period between them: 

 Phase 1, with construction equipment (10 months, 4.735 Mt). September 2018 to June 2019. 
The primary purpose is to utilize mine waste to construct access to the process plant site 
within the project area. 

 Phase 2, with the same mining equipment to be employed during the Production period (4 
months, 7.582 Mt). January 2021 to April 2021. 

 Pre-strip Phase 1, Initial Haul Road and Access Road Construction 16.3

Excavation of 4.735 Mt (2.003 Mbcm) of material from the East pit, and a further cut-to-fill 
volume of 0.605 Mbcm in the haul roads, is required for the construction of haul roads 1 to 7 
and filling of the primary crusher pad. This work will be carried out over a 10-month period and 
includes: 

 Topsoil stripping at East Pit Phase 1, haulroads and ore stockpile (14,761 m3) 

 Removal of bofedal for haul road construction (107,136 m3) 

 Placement of large rock fill and installation of geotextile and geo-mesh in areas where 
haulroads cross bofedals

 Construction of haul road bulk fills using mine waste and cut-to-fill (9.09 km); includes 
widening of haulroads 1 and 2 to include the mine access road 

 Crushing and screening and placement of haul road base (1.0 m) in selected areas, and 
wearing course (0.4 m) on haul roads 

 Lining of an estimated 50% of haul road water tables with high density polyethylene (HDPE) 
and installation of culverts 

 Provision and installation of reflective guide posts 

This work is considered as a separate contract, and the resources identified in Table 16-1 will be 
required.

 Owner Operator and Mining Contractor Cases 16.4

Two cases have been evaluated for the FEED. Case 1 is where the mining company operates 
the mine, and Case 2 (the Base Case) is where the mine would be operated by a mining 
contractor. For the FEED study, it is assumed that general mine coordination, mine planning 
(including geotechnical and survey), and geology functions would be carried out by the mining 
company in both cases, which is typical practice in the industry; however, various other 
responsibility structures are also in use.

 Mine Production and Process Plant Feed Schedules 16.5

 Mine Production Schedule 16.5.1

Based on the mine design, a mine production schedule which is focused on maximizing project 
NPV has been developed, following definition of a cut-off grade and stockpiling strategy which 
was completed (using a slightly different version of the pit design) as part of the FEED study. 
The three different strategies evaluated were completed as detailed operative mine production 
schedules using MinePlan software. The results of the three strategies evaluated were 
compared to the results predicted by Comet software (which was run only for strategy 2 to 
determine a baseline project value). The three strategies evaluated were: 

 Fixed cut-off grade (NSR $/t), with use of short-term ore stockpiles to maintain the Zn/Pb 
ratio above 0.4. 

 Variable cut-off grade (NSR $/t), with use of short-term ore stockpiles to maintain the Zn/Pb 
ratio above 0.4. 

 Variable cut-off grade (NSR $/t), with use of short-term ore stockpiles to maintain the Zn/Pb 
ratio above 0.4, and long-term stockpiles for lower value material, which is processed at the 
end of the mine life. 

Comet predicted an NPV of $1,418 M (operating cash flow) for strategy 2. The results of the 
detailed mine scheduling were $1,370 M for strategy 1, $1,424 M for strategy 2, and $1,432 M 
for strategy 3. 

The value of using a variable cut-off grade (NSR $/t) is clearly demonstrated with the 4% 
increase in operating NPV when a variable cut-off grade is introduced with strategy 2. The use 
of long-term stockpiles and processing lower value ore at the end of the mine life (strategy 3) 
adds only another $8M to the VAN when compared to strategy 2. As the risk of reduced 
metallurgical recovery for long-term stockpiled ore exists, strategy 2 was selected for the final 
mine production schedule for the FEED study. 

The mine schedule includes a pre-strip phase in the East pit, in which 12.311 Mt of waste will be 
mined. In addition, 20,629 t of ore will be mined and stockpiled during the same period. The 
total pre-strip requirement is 12.317 Mt. The pre-strip period is broken into a 10-month Phase 1 
period and a 4-month Phase 2 period. During the Phase 1 period (September 2018 to June 
2019), construction equipment will be used to mine 4.735 Mt of waste which is principally 
required for haul road and access road construction to gain access to the plant site so that plant 
construction may commence. In the Phase 2 period (January to April 2021), mining equipment 
will be used to mine the remaining 7.582 Mt. There is a period of 18 months between the two 
pre-strip periods when no mining activity is programmed. 

Following completion of the phase 2 pre-stripping, the East pit will be mined continuously until 
near the end of 2028. Backfilling of the pit with mine waste and filtered tailings will commence in 
April 2029 and take 4 years to complete. 

Mining of Minas pit will commence of November 2021 and will continue continuously until the 
end of the mine life in April 2039. 

Mining at the Main pit commences in 2026 and continues until the end of the mine life in April 
2039, except from May 2027 to April 2029 when mining in this pit is not required. 

The mine development sequence is shown in the following diagrams.

Mining requirements are highest from August 2021 until February 2023 (average 2.586 Mt 
mined per month), and then reduce over the next 4.5 years to a low of 11.217 Mt in the 12-
month period from May 2027 to Apr 2028 (0.935 Mt per month average), then increase again to 
21.638 Mt (1.803 Mt per month) in the 12 months from May 2031 to Apr 2032. From 2032 
onwards, mining requirements generally reduce to 12 to 14 Mt in the final three years, with 
mining being completed in April 2039. 

 Process Plant Feed Schedule 16.5.2

Ore to be fed to the primary crusher of the process plant will be sourced directly from the mine 
(and also from the short-term stockpile until October 2024). The tonnes and grades to be fed 
per period are shown in Table 16-4.

 Waste Management 16.6

Mine waste is classified as either non-acid generating (NAG) or potentially acid generating 
(PAG) based on the Net Neutralizing Potential (NNP) field in the resource block model supplied 
by Bear Creek, and applying the same criteria as used in the NI 43-101 report (M3 Engineering, 
2015), where blocks with NNP values less than -20 are considered to be PAG and blocks with 
more than -20 are considered to be NAG. In total, 78% of the waste to be mined is classified as 
NAG. During the pre-strip period, 99.8% of the waste to be mined is NAG, and this will be used 
to construct the initial haul roads, primary crusher platform, and the platform of the Main Mine 
Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit. 

During the production period, waste rock will be used to construct the Main Mine Waste and 
Filtered Tailings Deposit, using NAG material on the outside faces of the deposit, and using 
both NAG and PAG to form layers of rock which will cover each layer of filtered tailings, as 
shown in Figure 16-2. 

Figure 16-2: Diagram of Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit Construction 

 

 

The Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit were designed by Anddes and are 
discussed in more detail in Section 20 of this report. Generally, the downstream toe will be at 
approximately 4,856 m.a.s.l. and the top will be at 5,172 m.a.s.l., giving an overall height of 
approximately 316 m. Above the initial platform, face angles of 2.2 H:1 V will be used, with 7.5-
m wide berms spaced every 10 m vertical, giving an overall angle of 3 H:1V. The downstream 
face will be profiled and rehabilitated progressively during the mine life. The layout is show in 
Figure 16-3.

Figure 16-3: Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit 

 

Following completion of mining at the East pit in April 2029, backfilling of this pit will take place 
during the following four years. 32.1 Mt of mine waste (NAG and PAG) and 11.1 Mt of filtered 
tailings will be used to backfill the pit to 4,958 m.a.s.l. A small quantity of filtered tailings and 
mine waste will continue to be sent to the Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit during 
this time, and from 2033 until the end of mining in April 2039 will be the only destination for mine 
waste and filtered tailings. 

Table 16-5 shows the design criteria for the East pit backfill.

As part of the mine closure activities, following completion of mining in April 2039, Minas and 
Main pits will be backfilled to 4,859 masl approximately using 24 Mt of waste (NAG and PAG) 
and filtered tailings rehandled from the top of the Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit. 
Planning in the last few years of the mine life will be important to ensure that a layer of NAG 
waste is located within the Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit so that at completion 
of backfilling activities, a 1-m minimum layer of NAG waste rock is left on the top of the deposit 
for closure purposes. Figure 16-4 shows the backfill of the both pits. 

Figure 16-4: Pit Backfill 

 

 Mining Equipment 16.7

 Drilling 16.7.1

Drilling will be carried out using drill rigs equipped with down-the-hole hammers. Based on the 
rock hardness documented in the report "Corani Blast Fragmentation Project, Topex" (2015), 
the rock is of low to medium hardness with an unconfined compressive strength ranging 
between 27.5 MPa and 36.9 Mpa. The drill pattern selected allows for a powder factor of 0.26 
kg/t, consistent with the requirement documented by Topex. 

Drilling will be conducted using two Atlas Copco DM45 drills, with 156-mm diameter holes, using 
an average pattern as shown in the following table. These drills will work 169,464 hours during 
the life of the mine. One replacement will need to be purchased, resulting in the average hours 
for each drill being 56,488 over the life of the project.

A third drill will be required during 2021 and the first half of 2022 when production requirements 
are higher. The third drill selected is a Montabert top-hammer drill mast-mounted on a small 
excavator, and will drill 114-mm diameter holes. This drill has been selected as it can also be 
utilized for drilling of wall control holes, secondary basting, and probe drilling to confirm 
locations and safe cover of underground workings. Hours programmed for this drill are 24,727, 
and it will need to be replaced once during the mine life. 

Presplit drilling is not envisaged; instead, wall control blasting techniques will be developed 
using buffer or cushion holes in blasts which are against final pit walls (and phase pit walls) 
where required. 

 Blasting 16.7.2

Blasting activates will be undertaken by a specialist blasting contractor, who will provide the 
explosives and a "down-the-hole" service, whereby the contractor is responsible for designing 
drill patterns (with approval by the client), priming, loading, and firing of each blast. As some 
holes will be wet (rainfall and ground water), it is estimated that 50% of blasting will utilize ANFO 
(for dry holes) and 50% will utilize a waterproof blend of emulsion and ANFO. Explosives will be 
loaded into drill holes using a Mobile Mixing Unit Truck provided by the contractor. Blasting is 
expected to be conducted on average three times per week. All personnel within a radius of 500 
m of the blast must be evacuated during firing time, as required by the Peruvian mining 
regulations. 

Blasting accessories to be used include boosters (1 lb), downhole non-electric detonators, 
surface delay non-electric detonators, detonating cord, and non-electric lead-in line. To ensure 
acceptable blasting performance, crushed stemming will be used. 

 Loading, Hauling, and Ore Rehandling 16.7.3

In addition to the mining requirements, some ore will need to be rehandled to the primary 
crusher from the short-term stockpile (located within the Minas Pit limit), during 2021 to 2024. In 
addition to this rehandle, and due to mining requirements never matching exactly the primary 
crusher requirements, an estimated 15% of the ore mined will require rehanding. This ore will

Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 163 

be stockpiled either on the short-term stockpile (until 2024), adjacent to the primary stockpile, or 
within the final limits of the pits. 

Production loading will be undertaken using two Caterpillar 6030 face shovels, loading 
Caterpillar 785D dump trucks. A Caterpillar 993K front-end loader will also be required for 
loading of rehandled ore into the dump trucks and to allow loading activities to start up again 
quickly after blasting. 

The characteristics of the loading and hauling equipment are shown in Table 16-7 and Table 16-8.

Shovel requirements vary between a short-term peak of 2.09 in 2021 and 0.73 in 2027. Total 
shovel hours required are 168,627. Under the Owner Operator scenario, two shovels would 
need to be purchased for the start of the phase 2 pre-strip. Each shovel will work 84,314 hours 
during the mine life and will not need replacing. Under the Mining Contractor scenario, two 
shovels will be employed, except for the 3-year period from 2027 to 2029, where only one would 
be assigned to the project. The shovel requirements are illustrated in Figure 16-5. 

For both scenarios, Owner Operator and Mining Contractor, one caterpillar 993K front-end 
loader will be required for rehandle of ore. The front-end loader will work 13,963 hours over the 
life of the mine. 

Figure 16-5: Quantity of Shovels – Caterpillar 6030 

 

A total of 1,167,195 dump truck hours are required during the life of the mine (Phase 2 pre- strip 
and production). Initially, 18 trucks are required for 2020, increasing to 21 for 2021 and 2022, 
then reducing to 16 in 2023, and reducing further to a minimum of 9 in 2029 and 2030. For 2031 
to 2038, 10 trucks are required. The quantity of dump trucks required and used is shown in 
Figure 16-6. 

For the Owner Operator scenario, Bear Creek would have to purchase 18 dump trucks for 2020 
and a further 3 (totalling 21) for 2021. These 21 trucks would operate for the rest of the mine life, 
but with low utilization. Each truck would work 55,580 hours during the mine life and will not 
need to be replaced.

For the Mining Contractor scenario, it is assumed that a contractor would have the resources to 
cover the peak demands and adjust truck numbers to those required. 

 Ancillary Work and Equipment 16.7.4

Typical ancillary activities will be required to support drilling, loading and hauling activities. 
These include maintaining floors in the loading and unloading areas, scaling pit walls, 
construction of temporary ramps and accesses, maintaining haul roads, spreading waste, and 
profiling the external faces of the Main Mine Waste and Filtered Tailings Deposit, and well as 
maintenance of short-term ore stockpiles. Ancillary equipment requirements are indicated in 
Table 16-9.

 Dewatering 16.7.5

Based on the 2015 Feasibility Study, groundwater inflow to the pit is anticipated to be on the 
order of 2,000 to 3,000 m

3
/day. Inflowing groundwater and water from direct precipitation in the 

pits will be collected in sumps. Sump locations will change as the pits develop, moving to the 
deepest portions of the pits as they develop. Water from the pits will be pumped to the contact-
water cell of the water supply pond for subsequent consumption during operations. 

Pumps will be trailer-mounted, diesel units, and will pump through HDPE pipes to the process 
plant contact water pond. A range of pump sizes will be required, including some small portable 
pump and "layflat" hose for transferring water accumulated in surface puddles to a central sump. 

 Mine Supervision 16.7.6

Mine supervision includes the following areas: 

 Mining Operations 

 Planning 

 Geology 

 Maintenance 

Table 16-10 identifies the quantity of mine supervision personnel needed and compares the 
numbers from the 2015 Feasibility Study to the current estimates for the Owner Operator and 
Mining Contractor scenarios.

 Mine Operations Personnel 16.7.8

In the scenario that mining is carried out by Bear Creek Mining, a total of 47 staff would be 
required for the five areas (Mine Operations, Geology, Planning, Maintenance, and Tailings 
Transport). If a mining contractor were to be used, the quantity of owner staff in these areas 
would reduce to 22, and the contractor would require 52 staff. Under the mining contractor 
scenario, planning, geology, and filtered tailings transport supervision would remain with Bear 
Creek Mining, and the mining contractor would be responsible for mine operations and

  Page 169 

maintenance, with Bear creek maintaining a reduced staff level in mine operations to coordinate 
the mining contractor. Because the mining contractor includes staff for functions such as safety 
supervision, payroll, human resources etc., it is expected that a significant reduction could be 
made in quantities of Bear Creek Mining staff in its corresponding areas. Table 16-12 shows the 
Mine Operations personnel requirements and the comparison between the 2015 Feasibility 
Study and the current Owner Operator and Mining Contractor scenarios.

 Filtered Tailings Transport 16.7.9

Transport of filtered tailings from the filtered tailings stockpile to the Main Mine Waste and 
Filtered Tailings Deposit will be undertaken by a contractor. The contractor will be responsible 
for construction of its own facilities (with the exception of a wash bay) on a platform to be 
provided by Bear Creek Mining, and connection to services provided by Bear Creek. 

The contractor proposes to use two Caterpillar 966 front-end loaders to load tip-trucks of 20-m
3
 

capacity, which will transport the filtered tailings to the deposit. The quantity of tip trucks will 
increase gradually from 6 in the first year to 16 in the last 5 years as haulage cycle times 
increase with increasing deposit height. A Caterpillar D8T bulldozer will be used to spread the 
tailings in layers approximately 1-m thick. As the ramp on the deposit will be shared with mining 
dump trucks of a much larger size, the filtered tailings contractor will also be responsible for 
sharing maintenance of the ramp in common use, using a grader, water truck, and backhoe. 

 Fuel 16.7.10

For the Phase 1 pre-strip (construction of haul roads), diesel fuel will be supplied by a major 
Peruvian fuel company, who will construct temporary fuel storage facilities (capacity 40,000 
gallons) and provide a refuelling service in the field using fuel trucks (two on day shift and 1 on 
night shift). 

For the Phase 2 pre-strip and the rest of the mine life, a fuel facility will be constructed near the 
main entrance gate. It will have 100,000 gallons of storage capacity (equivalent to 9 days of 
storage during the peak demand in 2021) and be equipped with two fuel bowsers for light 
equipment. The same company will be responsible for refuelling and lubrication of all mining 
equipment in the field, using two mixed fuel/lubrication trucks operating 24 h/day. Equipment 
from other areas will refuel at the fuel station also. 

 Explosives 16.7.11

For the Phase 1 pre-strip (construction of haul roads), Phase 2 pre-strip, and production years, 
a Peruvian explosives supplier will be responsible for constructing explosives storage facilities, 
supplying explosives, and providing a "down-hole" blasting service. Facilities to be provided are: 

 Storage magazine for detonator 

 Storage magazine for high explosives 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 170 

 Roofed area for Ammonium Nitrate storage and loading silo 

 Silos for emulsion storage 

The storage magazine for detonators will be approximately 18 m
2
 and will have sufficient 

capacity for 500 kg. The storage magazine for high explosives will be approximately 14 m
2
 and 

have sufficient capacity for 1,800 kg. Boosters and detonator cord will be stored in this 
magazine. Both magazines will be separated by an earth wall, with a minimum distance of 19 m 
between the magazines. 

The bulk emulsion storage silos will have storage for 160 tonnes distributed in two silos, which 
will be filled by the explosives supplier´s trucks which will bring the emulsion to the mine. These 
silos will be used to fill the mobile mixing unit trucks for use in the mine. 

The ammonium nitrate storage shed will be a closed sided, steel-clad shed with an area of 375 
m

2
. It will have capacity for 300 tonnes of material in big bags of 1.00 or 1.25 tonnes. 

All storage facilities will be surrounded by security fences and provided with external security 
lighting and lightning protection. 

 Truck Shop and Facilities 16.7.12

The truck shop will be located in the northwest part of the industrial area, with access from the 
mine passing by the primary crusher pad, and with access for light vehicles from the processing 
plant. The truck shop will include: 

 Mine Operations and maintenance offices 

 Toilets and changing rooms 

 Satellite lunch room 

 Deposit for consumables 

 Area for lubricants and additives 

 A total of 3 maintenance bays: (1) assigned to preventative maintenance, (1) assigned to 
corrective maintenance, (1) multipurpose. 

 Light vehicle bays (2) 

 Overhead bridge crane (40 tonne main, 10 tonne secondary) 

A tire changing area of approximately 1,120 m
2
, will be located next to the truck shop and 

includes a concrete slab for jacking trucks up and changing tires. In addition, there are two 
areas of approximately 500 m

2
 for storage of tires. The area will have a container office and 

warehouse. 

A truck and equipment wash area of 800 m
2
 will be located next to the truck shop. It includes a 

concrete slab with steel protection rails, enclosures, and elevated platforms equipped with water 
cannons and hose reels. 

 Fleet Management System 16.7.13

As requested by Bear Creek Mining, a fleet management system has been included. The 
system considered is a Peruvian developed system and has been successfully implemented at 
several Peruvian mining operations. The supplier will be responsible for providing all hardware 
and software required and for operating the system for the first 5 years from the 
commencement of the phase 2 pre-strip (start of operations with mining equipment). From year 
6 onwards, the system will be operated by the mining company's mine operations personal. The 
system is included in both the owner operator and mining contractor scenarios, as a mining 
company cost.

 Work Schedule 16.8

Mining will be carried out using 8-m high benches, consistent with the NI43-101 report (M3 
Engineering, 2015) and will intersect some historic underground workings. Mining will be carried 
out working 2 x 12-hour shifts per day, 365 days per year. In total, three crews of operations 
personnel will be required, one working day shift, one working night shift, and one on rest days. 
Crews will work a 7 day, 7 night, 7 day off roster. Maximum equipment working hours per day 
are estimated to be 20.50, resulting in a maximum possible utilization of 85.4%. Time lost on 
average per day is shown in Table 16-13.

17 Recovery Methods 

 Site Layout Considerations 17.1

The Project site is located on steep sloping, high-altitude terrain that has limited flat space. 
These considerations required particular care in developing acceptable sites for the facilities. 

The development of the site layout was based on maximizing the ease of operation and 
minimizing both capital and operating costs. 

 Process Description 17.2

The Corani Project process facility is based on a two stage sequential flotation concentrator 
generating two products: a lead concentrate enriched with silver and a zinc concentrate with 
slight silver presence. 

The plant design incorporates the following process areas:  

 Primary crushing and coarse ore Stock pile 

 SAG Milling, followed by Ball Milling 

 Selective Lead-Zinc flotation 

 Concentrates Thickening and Filtering (Pb, Zn) 

 Tailings Thickening and Filtering  

 Dry Stack Tailings system 

 Reagent preparation and ancillary facilities 

 Primary Crushing and Coarse Ore Stockpile  17.2.1

The primary crushing plant is designed to process 22,500 t/d of ore, on an operating schedule 
of 350 days per year, 24 hours per day at 70% effective availability (availability + Utilisation). 

The ROM (run-of-mine) ore at, 1,000 mm maximum size, will be directly discharged onto a 
stationary grizzly assisted by one hydraulic rock breaker. The crusher feed hopper has a 240 t 
capacity, equivalent to 1.8 times a CAT 785 D 131 truck.  The design allows sequential (not 
simultaneous) discharge on two different sides. 

The design allows the hopper to provide gravitational feeding to the primary 50' x 65' gyratory 
crusher, in order to obtain a P80 = 150 mm size. The crusher product is unloaded on a series of 
conveyor belts carrying the material to the coarse ore stockpile. The design incorporates a dust 
suppression system. 

The coarse ore stockpile (see Figure 17-1) having a live capacity of 11,250 tons and 44,530 
tons of total capacity, with autonomy of 12 continuous working hours with respect to its 
treatment nominal capacity, and 2 days with respect to dead load, because the grinding area is 
operated with an availability of 92%. 

Primary crushing product will discharge from the stockpile feed conveyor belt directly onto the 
coarse ore stockpile. Ore will be drawn from the stockpile by three reclaim apron feeders, two 
operating and one in standby. The reclaim apron feeders will discharge onto the stockpile 
reclaim/ SAG feed conveyor belt which will covey the material to the SAG mill. A belt scale, 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 173 

magnet and metal detector will be installed in the conveyor belt to prevent metallic elements 
reaching the mill. In this path there is also a ball feed system to feed 5 inches balls to the SAG 
mill. 

The belt design incorporates a protective cover, reducing material losses due to wind action, or 
snow and/or rain reaching the belt.  

 Grinding and Classification Circuit Description 17.2.2

The grinding design has a nominal treatment of 22,500 t/d ore operating at 92% of availability. 
The final product of the grinding circuit has been determined from the metallurgy at 80% 
passing 106 microns (P80) at 32% w/w solids average concentration. The equipment has been 
designed for 90 microns. 

The grinding circuit includes a semi-autogeneous mill at 9.1 m dia.x 4.3 m (EGL) with a 7,000 
kW motor, provided with a trommel at the discharge end, operating in line and in open circuit 
with the second stage grinding ball mill at 7.3 m dia. x 11.9 m (EGL) with dual 7,000 kW motors, 
operating in closed circuit with hydrocyclones. 

The design SAG-Ball Mill transfer size is 1.18 mm (T80). SAG Mill trommel oversize (pebbles), 
estimated at 25% of feed maximum will be recirculated to the mill via a pressurized water 
injection system called the Water Jet System. The trommel undersize and the ball mill product 
are both combined in the Sag Mill discharge pump box and pumped to the classification system 
with 10 hydrocyclones (2 standby) each 33 in. diameter. The combined mill discharges at 70% 
solids are diluted to 55% to feed the cyclones.  The ball mill design includes a ball feeding 
system for 2" to 3" steel balls. 

Further work will be required during detailed design on the pebbles handling system, once more 
data is obtained on their effects on SAG mill operation. 

 Lead Flotation 17.2.3

The hydrocyclone overflow flows by gravity to two conditioner tank, operating in series. In the 
first one zinc cyanide and sodium sulphide are added to depress pyrite and sphalerite, while in 
the second, lead activators and collectors, sodium isopropyl xanthate (SIPX) and promoter A-
404 (AP 404) are added, as well as frother methyl isobutyl carbinol (MIBC). The conditioned 
slurry flows by gravity to the lead rougher flotation cells, consisting of 5 conventional forced air 
cells, 300 m

3
 each in series. 

In the event that the concentrate generated by the first two rougher cells is of high grade, the 
design of the plant has the flexibility (bypass) to direct the concentrate to the second cleaning 
stage, thus avoiding re-grinding and the first cleaning stages. The use of this option is highly 
recommended when working with minerals with fast flotation kinetics. 

The concentrate obtained from the lead rougher flotation constitutes the fresh feed to the lead 
regrind circuit equipped with a vertical mill with 1500 kW, operating in open circuit with 8 
hydrocyclones (2 standby) each 10" in diameter. The lead rougher concentrate is reground at 
25-30 µm P80 and is pumped to the first cleaning flotation stage of 4 conventional cells in series 
of 50 m

3
 each.  

The lead first cleaner concentrate is pumped into the second cleaning stage (first column cell) of 
the flotation circuit. The first cleaner tails flow by gravity to the cleaner-scavenger circuit 
equipped with 4 cells x 50 m

3
 cells working in series. The resulting concentrate is recirculated to 

the first cleaner feed box and tails are sent to the zinc flotation circuit. 

The concentrate generated by the second cleaner is fed to the third cleaner flotation (second 
column cell). The tailings generated by the second lead cleaner flotation are recirculated to the 
first cleaning stage. The third cleaner concentrate (from 2nd column cell), becomes the final 
concentrate of the lead circuit, and feeds the lead concentrate thickener, while the lead third 
cleaner tailings are recirculated to the feed box of the second cleaner flotation (first column cell). 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 174 

The flotation circuit was designed to send the tailings from the rougher flotation circuit and 
cleaner-scavenger flotation circuit to the tailings thickener, when the zinc flotation circuit is not in 
operating. 

The design included a sump system to collect spills generated by the rougher and cleaner-
scavenger flotation stages and recirculate them to the corresponding concentration stage. 
Provision is made for operational adjustments of pH and reagent and process water additions. 

In general, the lead circuit has a robust design for handling of concentrates and tails generated 
by flotation. A pending engineering issue is related to ensuring that the maximum silver is 
recovered to the lead concentrate. 

 Zinc Flotation 17.2.4

Tailings from lead rougher flotation and the lead scavenger-cleaner circuits are pumped to two 
zinc circuit feed conditioning tanks operated in series. In the first, copper sulphate is added to 
activate the zinc while in the second a xanthate collector, frother and lime to adjust pH to a 
value around 11. 

The conditioned slurry flows by gravity to the zinc rougher flotation with 5 conventional forced 
air cells each 300 m

3
, operated in series The tailings generated by zinc rougher flotation feeds 

the tailings thickener, while concentrate is fed to the zinc regrind circuit equipped with a vertical 
mill with 1500 kW operating in an open circuit with 7 hydrocyclones (2 standby) each 10" in 
diameter. The zinc rougher concentrate is reground at 25-30 µm P80 and pumped to the zinc 
first cleaner flotation, 4 cells in series each of 40 m

3
. 

The zinc first cleaner concentrate is pumped to the second cleaner flotation (first column cell), 
while the first cleaner tailings flow by gravity to the cleaner-scavenger stage, of 3 cells in series, 
each 40 m

3
.  The zinc cleaner-scavenger concentrate is recirculated to the first cleaner feed, 

while the tailings are pumped to the final tailings thickener. 

The concentrate obtained from the zinc second cleaner flotation (first column) is pumped to the 
second column cell for the third cleaner flotation stage. The second cleaner tailings are 
recirculated to first cleaner flotation, while the third cleaner concentrate becomes the final 
concentrate of the zinc circuit and is pumped to the zinc concentrate thickener. The third 
cleaner tailings (second column) are recirculated to the second cleaner flotation feed. 

The overall flotation design includes on-line "sampling" diverting a slurry sample to the multi-
stage on line analyser, in order to measure lead, zinc, iron and other elements which are 
necessary for control of the operation. The design included in the layout the necessary space to 
incorporate metallurgical sampler cutters to sample and assay the fresh feed to lead flotation, 
overall plant tailings and final lead and zinc concentrates. Figure 17-1 shows the general flow 
diagram of the Corani process plant.

 Lead Concentrate Thickening and Filtration 17.2.5

The lead concentrate will be dewatered in a 10 m diameter thickener, producing a 65% w/w 
solids average underflow, which is pumped into the lead concentrate filter feed tank. which has 
a residence time of 8.5 hours.  This allows control of feed the filter as required to produce  a 
final concentrate with 8% average moisture. 

The thickened lead concentrate will be pumped to the lead concentrate automatic vertical 
pressure filter Larox PF12, including 20 plates of 900 mm x 1750 mm each, with own PLC to 
control and automate the feeding, pressing, blowing and filtrated cake unloading stages, as well 
as cloths washing or any other activity required for operations. Filter cake will discharge to a 
covered lead concentrate stockpile. 

The lead thickener overflow is pumped to the process water tank. The thickener also receives 
water coming from the concentrate filtration stage and spills generated by the area. 

 Zinc Concentrate Thickening and Filtration  17.2.6

The zinc concentrate will be dewatered in an 8 meter diameter thickener, producing an  average 
underflow discharge at 65% w/w solids which is pumped to a 9,8 hour residence time filter feed 
tank  This  allows regulation of  the feed to the filter, as required to produce a final concentrate 
at 8% average moisture.  

The thickened zinc concentrate will be pumped to the zinc concentrate automatic vertical 
pressure filter Larox PF12, including 16 plates each 900mm x 1750mm.  The filter has its own 
PLC to control and automate feeding, pressing, blowing and filter cake discharge stages, as 
well as cloth washing or other activity required by operations. Filter cake will discharge to a 
covered zinc concentrate stockpile. 

The zinc thickener overflow is recirculated to the zinc flotation circuit. The thickener also 
receives filtrate from the concentrate filtration stage, and from potential spills generated in the 
area for solids recovery. 

 Tailings Plant Thickening and Filtering 17.2.7

Tailings from the zinc flotation circuit are dewatered in a 50 m diameter thickener producing and 
the underflow containing 45-55% solids w/w is pumped to the tailings filtration section. The 
underflow is pumped to 4 filter feed tanks. An additional feed tank will be added in later years to 
accommodate increased tailings flows. 

Each feed tank feeds directly to two filters via centrifugal pumps. In emergency cases, the 
thickener may discharge all by gravity to the emergency pond. 

Tailings dewatering is carried out by eight (plus 2 in future) Larox FFP 3512 plate horizontal 
press filters, including 74 cameras with 3,500 mm x 2,500 mm plates each. The thickened 
tailings are gradually fed onto the press filters during the corresponding filtering cycle, allowing 
to obtain a filtered tailing with 17% w/w moisture. 

The filtrate and wash water will flow by gravity to the tailings filtrate tank, which will then be 
pumped to the tailing thickener. 

Each filter has its own PLC to control and automate feeding, pressing, blowing and filtered cake 
discharge stages, as well as cloth washing and any other activity required by operations.

 Tailings Disposal 17.2.8

Filters will discharge the 17% w/w average moisture tailings by gravity onto 4 belt conveyors 
(one for each 2 filters) that transfer these tailings to a belt conveyor provided with a belt scale 
for operational control. This in turn discharges via a radial stacker to a stockpile. From the 
stockpile, a front and loader will load dump trucks, and until year 8 of operation will be 
transported to the Waste Rock and Dry Tailings Storage area 

(1)
 located at the south of the Main 

pit. Tailings will be co-disposed with the waste rock generated by the mine. Between years 9 
and 11 of the mine's life, the tailings will be transported to backfill mined out pits at the mine. 
From year 12 onwards, the tailings will be again be deposited at the Waste Rock and Dry 
Tailings Storage area until the end of the mining operation. 

For years 12 to 18 Bear Creek Mining has postponed their decision, either to continue using 
their truck fleet, or to use conveyor belts. 

 Process Design Criteria 17.3

The main process design criteria 
(2)

 used in the development of Phase 1 FEED Engineering of 
Corani Project are described below. 

 Metallurgical Testing 17.3.1

No additional metallurgical tests were carried out during the phase 1 FEED engineering.  

The metallurgical test campaigns completed from year 2006 to 2015 have produced variable 
recoveries of the Project metals of interest (Ag, Pb and Zn). 

From the observed trends during the lock cycle tests performed between years 2008 and 2009 
statistical analysis was performed on the recoveries generated by element of interest (Pb, Ag, 
Zn), in order to identify the metallurgical behaviour of the samples studied. 

(3)(4)
.  

Parameters that influence recoveries are: 

For Lead Recovery: 

 Zinc Feed Grade 

 Mine Elevation 

 Galena Present (%) vs. Lead Phosphates 

 Amount of oxides present (Fe, MnO) 

For Zinc recovery: 

 Zinc Feed Grade 

 Mine Elevation 

 Pyrite Feed Grade 

More information about this can be found in Chapter 13 of  this report.

It is important to indicate that during the development of the Project optimization of the mining 
plan continued, generating a final version after the end of the Project. An analysis of the 
modifications can be found in Chapter ¡Error! No se encuentra el origen de la referencia. of 
this report. More up-to-date information can be found in Chapters 15 and 16 of this report. 

The process design assumed these overall recoveries for lead, zinc and silver per concentrate 
(lead and zinc concentrates).

 Water Requirement 17.4

The engineering design has considered recycling the process water recovered from the 
dewatering system to avoid any release of water in the environment, and at the same time 
prevent negative impacts on the efficiency of its operational units.  

The site-wide water balance (see Section 20) has determined that the plant water requirement 
can be met even in extreme dry conditions.  In addition, the process can consume the mine 
contact water, thus preventing the need for environmental discharge or water treatment. 

The fresh water demand per area can be seen in Table 17-23:

The proposed plant design allows the flexible management of recovered water and optimizes 
the distribution according to the recovered water source.

which should be present in the recirculated water, could involuntarily activate any sphalerite 
(ZnS) surfaces, altering the metallurgical behaviour. Another effect is related to the reagents to 
be used in each of the flotation stages, especially if at the time the preparation is not carefully 
controlled.

 Water Distribution Strategy 17.4.1

Fresh water will come from the non-contact water conveyance system within basin that contains 
the project (see Section 18). It is expected to be good quality. 

Engineering has considered reusing 100% of the water recovered from the process, which is 
considered suitable for use if some basic distribution criteria are applied. However, the mine will 
be preferentially sourced from the contact water pond. This water may have elevated salt, 
dissolved metals, and acidity concentrations.  Despite these concerns, it is considered suitable.  
When necessary (when the contact pond is dry, or for applications requiring better water quality), 
water will be collected from the non-contact water pond. The drainage basin near the mine has 
sufficient water to supply operations (see Section 20). 

In the attached table a summary of water consumption and distribution during the process is 
shown:

The Corani plant has two flotation circuits (Lead and Zinc) working in series but demanding 
different operational conditions. While the lead circuit should work with a pH between 6 and 7, 
the zinc should operate at a pH 11. 

The required reagents per type of flotation are shown in the table below. 

Table 17-26: Flotation Reagents by Circuit 

 Lead Zinc Observation 

Zinc Cyanide Yes -- Zinc depressant 

Sodium Sulphite Yes -- Zinc depressant 

A404 Yes --

Isopropyl Sodium Xanthate Yes Yes Collector 

Flocculant Yes Yes  

MIBC Yes Yes No water needed 

Copper Sulphate  --- Yes Zinc Activator 

MIBC Yes Yes No water needed 

Lime --- Yes pH Modifier 

Water recovered from the lead thickener and lead concentrate filter will have high 
concentrations of Zn depressants with a pH slightly higher than 7, making it very attractive for 
reuse in its lead flotation and the design incorporates this re-use with appropriate controls. 

It is also estimated that from the dewatering stages of the Pb/Ag and Zn/Ag concentrates and 
due to the high content of silver, it is possible that thickener overflows contain significant fine 
solids. Inline filters are incorporated to recover these solids. 

Similar conditions occur in the zinc circuit which must operate at pH 11 to optimize selectivity 
within the floatation circuit. However, this condition also makes it less advisable of being used

directly within the lead circuit, but instead it can be used in the milling stage because of its high 
pH.  

At the end of the engineering an operating philosophy was developed to recycle and reuse the 
water in the process plant, depending on its origin.

The recovered water to be used must be pre-treated with Hydrogen Peroxide and Activated 
Carbon in solution and pass through in-line filter units in order to allow the extraction of any 
colloidal fine particles and free radicals. This treatment will be necessary since the lead circuit is 
not able to generate the required water for recycling.  

The recovered water to be used must be pre-treated with Hydrogen Peroxide and Activated 
Carbon in solution and pass through in-line filter units in order to allow the extraction of fine 
particles and free radicals. The zinc circuit does not require treatment of its reclaimed water 
because it comes from its own tailings thickener, and that could also be used in the milling 
circuit due to its high pH (11) which helps to reduce wearing due to the steels corrosion involved, 
such as balls and mill linings.  . 

 Fresh Water 17.4.2

The Project contact and non-contact waters will be managed in Plant Water Pond. 

The pond has a storage capacity of 782,000 m3 and is located northeast of the process plant, 
downstream of the mine and DDMRP, of the borrowing material areas, and process plant (see 
Figure 17-4). Its design includes two dams for operation. One that separates the Contact Water 
from the Non-Contact Water, and one that separates the non-contact water from the 
downstream zones.   

The justification for the pond size and further details on the water balance can be found in 
Section 20.  . 

Figure 17-4: Water Plant Pond location 

 

Its design makes it possible to handle the contact water runoff and meet the water demand 
generated by the plant during the driest periods of the year (from May to September). During 
this time, it is also considered to release an ecological flow of 2.6 L/s rate, according to the 
commitment in the Environmental Impact Study.

Figure 17-5: Process Plant Power Distribution by Area 

 
 

 Control System  17.6

The control is based on a process automation system and a set of controllers and PLCs with 
modular and open systems, based on recognized and tested standards of similar processing 
plants (SQL, HART, Ethernet, TCP/IP, Profibus DP and PA, IEC-61131-3).  

In order to operate efficiently and safely, the Corani plant will be equipped to monitor most of 
the process variables from the control room, facilitating self-diagnosis and failure reporting and 
immediate alarm management. 

The design considered distributed type control architecture (client/server), with disseminated 
controllers in electrical rooms and remote Input/Output cabinets (RIO's) at the field. The control 
cabinets will be responsible for controlling the process in each area of the plant. 

Critical process controllers have a redundant processor and power supply. The control system 
will communicate with the servers and workstations of the main control cabinets located in the 
electrical rooms through a redundant Ethernet network, while the communication between the 
control cabinets and RIO's will be done through a Profibus DP fieldbus. For both cases, 
communication is via multimode optic fibre. 

Regarding field instrumentation, the controller's action, alarm switches and final control devices 
will be fail-safe, while the transmitters to be used would have a local or remote indicator. 
Conveyor belts will have pull cords and compact misalignment sensors, which are robust, safe 
and easily maintained. The installation of all instruments is at floor level, on access platforms, or 
operations stairways.  

The automation system will also allow control of the processing plant from the main control 
room, which is located in the milling installation, in order to monitor and control process 
equipment, motors, screens, control loops and interlocks, and register operator inputs and 
diagnostics, in order to take preventive and corrective actions regarding tonnage, reagent 
dosage, pond levels, alarms and other parameters in the field. 

Critical controllers will have redundant power supply sources.

 Process Control Philosophy 17.6.1

The ore (run-of-mine) will arrive the crushing area in dump trucks.  At the unloading area there 
are 2 traffic lights supervising the trucks unloading, ensuring alternate unloading (not 
simultaneous), Dumping permission also depends on the state of the crusher, since this 
equipment must be in operation and free of process and safety alarms. The operation of traffic 
lights is manual and automatic; in automatic mode, control will be supervised by the central PLC 
and, depending on the state of sensors reflecting the presence of trucks in the ramps, the state 
of the crusher and the hopper level sensor, the logic will provide permission to unload. While in 
manual mode, the decision to permit discharge will be made by the operator from the control 
room from the SCADA system.  

Operational continuity will depend on the fact that there is no ore bridging in hoppers, damage 
or misalignment, of conveyor belts, among other variables. These actions will be monitored and 
directed permanently from the main control room. 

The grinding circuit will work directly with the information generated by a pressure sensor 
located in the overflow line of the classification battery, in order to control the P80 (about 106 
microns) required for the flotation stage.  

The control logic establishes a control loop of the nested type, which allows balancing the pulp 
level in the mill pump box, the cyclone classification pressure, the circuit internal water balance, 
the product size (P80) and the flow of fresh ore feeding the mill.  

Operational control of the flotation area will be supported mainly by the information generated 
by the X-ray analyser which will report the element of interest grades for each of the flotation 
stages, which might indirectly act on the reagents addition, (lime, foams, collectors or 
depressants), or facilitating the actions (local route) on the foam height inside the cells in order 
to individually regulate the flotation velocity.  

The grade analyser may also report to operations if the zinc grade is low enough to make the 
decision to bypass the lead flotation tailings directly to the final tailings thickener or to maintain 
the operation. 

At the lead and zinc concentrate thickening area, operations control will be through densimeters 
and flowmeters on the thickeners discharge, in order to generate the solids concentration 
required by the filters. At a second control level, the area design also allows for recirculation of 
thickened pulp if its density is less than that established in the design criterion, as set by 
operations.  

In general, the concentrate filters will be controlled by their own PLC and monitored from the 
plant control room. In addition, each filter will work with its own programming facilitating the 
generation of filtering cycles previously agreed with the equipment supplier, in order to ensure 
the treatment rate (t/m

2
 /h) established according to design. 

The control system for the thickener-tank system feeding filters and final tailings filters will be 
similar to that for concentrates. In case the final concentrate moisture is higher than the 
expected (about 20% w/w), the design incorporates reversible belts allowing discharge to the 
floor for re-handling, which will facilitate operation during plant commissioning and start up.

18 Project Infrastructure 

The infrastructure for the Corani Project requires significant development and planning.  The 
site is remote, at high elevation, and a considerable distance from major urban areas.  The 
infrastructure developed for the Project includes transportation, process buildings and related 
facilities, water supply and management, power supply, communications, and material storage 
stockpiles.  

Several project components were optimized subsequent to the July 2015 Technical Report by 
M3 Engineering (M3 PN 140135, 17 July 2015). Detailed engineering studies, site investigation 
work, and laboratory testing programs were ongoing at the time of the July 2015 report. The 
optimizations were presented in December 2015.   Several significant changes have been made 
in the design approach in order streamline the Project and minimize Capital and Operating 
costs.  The most significant changes have been advanced through additional fieldwork and 
detailed engineering to support the optimization concepts presented in this study.  A summary 
of the infrastructure related work performed subsequent to the 2015 report for the present 2017 
study is presented below. 

 More precise and geo-referenced topography completed 

 Soil mechanics studies completed 

 Bridge and tunnel designs for the main project access road reviewed and in some cases 
revised 

 Review and optimization of the overall Project layout 

 Review and update of Project hydrology and hydrogeology 

 Evaluation and development of Project accesses 

 Development of accesses for mine vehicles (Haul Roads) 

The current components and arrangement of facilities is described in this section of the Report. 
Several of these project components are described in more detail in other sections of this report, 
and only a general description of the relevant aspects of the project infrastructure-related 
components is given here. The following components of the project are described in the sub-
sections that follow 

 Transportation – Access, and Site Roads 

 Site Buildings and Facilities 

 Mine Services Facilities 

 Administration Facilities 

 Process Facilities 

 Camp Facilities 

 Water Supply and Management Facilities 

 Power Supply and Distribution 

 Communications Systems 

 Waste Disposal Facilities 

 Waste Rock and Tailings Management Facilities 

 Transportation 18.1

Transportation to and around the site is by roadways that have been developed and improved 
to accommodate the demands of the project.  An access road has been designed to link the 
project site to the Interoceanic Highway that provides access to the town of Macusani and to the 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 193 

rest of the country for receiving supplies and delivering products.  The lead and zinc 
concentrate produced by the mining and mineral processing operations will be delivered to the 
Port of Matarani or other destination via trucks using the access road and Peru's public highway 
system. 

 Access Road 18.1.1

The Main Access Road to the Corani Project, as designed by GMI and Anddes Asociados SAC 
(Anddes), will be a new 46 km highway connecting to the existing Interoceanic Highway (34B) 
which is in turn connected through the existing Peruvian highway system to the Port of Matarani, 
632 km. from the Project site.  The Port has facilities for concentrate shipment. Figure 18-1 
shows the Plant access and site roads. The Interoceanic Highway is a two-lane, paved highway 
that connects the Peruvian port cities of Matarani and Ilo.   

The access road intersects the Interoceanic Highway at km 198+ 500 just before it crosses the 
Huiquisa River Bridge, about 16 km north of Macusani.   The road has three Sections. Section 1 
begins at the Highway as a new road, following the left bank of the Macusani River and 
improving highway existing P500 with new stretches to bypass several populated centres, 
improving highway safety. At the beginning of 2017, GMI carried out field investigations which 
identified unfavourable conditions along the routing of Section 1 used in previous studies.   

The studies showed the following 

 Tunnels 1, 2, 4 and 5, were covered by less than three diameters of the tunnel cross section 
(21 metres) which, given the poor quality of the rock discovered in the fieldwork, would not 
guarantee the stability of the proposed tunnel.  

 Strong alteration of the rock and rock falls at both tunnel entrances. 

 Chillcuna ravine shows a cover of residual and alluvial soils of fine and loose loamy sand, 
which are easily eroded and unstable due to their poor cohesion. This had produced 
landslides along more than 500 meters of the right margin of this ravine. In the case of the 
exit portal (1 + 660), slides were identified on the lower slope for almost 500 meters on the 
right bank of the ravine, which would require stabilization and containment works on the 
lower slope as well as consideration of using false tunnels at both portals.   

 Geophysical tests indicate that the depth of loose sandy soils at the site of the bridges is 
between 15 and 24 meters which required moving the bridge to a location with better 
foundation conditions and to avoid areas of unstable sandy slopes. 

The Access road design has been re-routed to avoid these unfavourable sections.   

On rough and rugged terrain, for reasons of economy and compatibility with the category of 
road, it will follow the natural undulations of the terrain without compromising sightlines and 
safety features. There are circumstances that will require using "U" or switchback curves, as is 
the case in very tight ravines and sectors of slope development, so that in these sectors there 
will be occasional reductions of the posted speed to maintain a reasonable project cost.  This 
will also require an increase in a few slopes in some sectors, particularly in Section 1 and the 
onsite Section from the entry Guardhouse to the plant area (which are both entirely new).  

Generally, there is a horizontal alignment characterized by horizontal curves with radii greater 
than or equal to 15m. The vertical alignment is characterized by a continuous ascent from a 
height of 4200 m.a.s.l. to the 5100 m.a.s.l. level at the entrance to the Mine site. Due to the 
existence of very sinuous and rugged terrain, a speed limit of 30 km/h has been established. In 
exceptionally tight curves, the vehicular speed will be reduced to speed of manoeuvring speed.

A network of roads has been designed to connect the facilities within the mine and plant site 
(Figure 18-4).  The final section of the mine access road connects the residential camp to the 
mine entrances, as presented in Section 18.1.1. (Figure 18-1).  The mine entrance is located at 
approximately 5,000 masl on a ridge overlooking the mine and processing plant site.  During 
construction and the first several years of mining, traffic from the mine entrance to the plant site 
will be on a road that is routed west around the Este Pit location, past the primary crusher, and 
down to the plant, which is at an elevation of approximately 4,850 m.a.s.l. (Figure 18-3).In Year 
7, a new road will be established east of the Este Pit to connect the mine entrance and 
administrative complex to the plant site.  Additional roads for access to the various components 
of the Process Plant, the Plant Water Pond, and other project facilities have been laid out and 
included in the initial capital cost (Figure 18-4).

. 

 Residential Facilities 18.2.4

The distance of the Project site from any significant urban area that could provide lodging and 
services to mine personnel requires that the Project include a residential camp.  The camp site 
is located at an elevation of approximately 4,400 m.a.s.l., about 10 km to the northeast of the 
mine facilities. The UTM, Zone 19S, Datum PSAD56 coordinates of the site are: 8,456,510 m 
North; 321,312 m East. 

 

Figure 18-5: Camp Location 

 

 

The camp has been organized in such a way that the facilities are located in a central core. The 
core/circle design is to offer higher protection against cold wind and other inclement weather.  

Parking areas are centrally located close to the dormitories. Vehicle traffic is limited in dormitory 
areas, and only design for pedestrians is considered. The inner circle distributes traffic for 
facilities centrally located for delivery of supplies.  

The external circle is for ease of pick-up of workers to transport them to the mine and return to 
the camp.

Design is based on the construction camp being converted to the operations camp the project 
considers being able to have a construction camp in the first years, so that it can be used in the 
operation phase and it will be built according to this concept of reuse, in order to optimize the 
infrastructure to be included. 

Camp capacity was estimated based on the projected occupancy curve resulting from the 
construction program and the estimation of permanent staff in the operation stage. 

Figure 18-6: Camp Layout 

 
 

The following construction systems are considered according to the concept proposed: 

 

Permanent Buildings: Composed of mixed prefabricated systems (concrete slab with insulated 
panelling on metal structures), as well as modular prefabricated systems. These are the 
buildings that will be used in the construction stage and later re- used during operations. 

 

Temporary Building: Prefabricated modular buildings and tents. These are the buildings that will 
be used only in the construction stage due to their quick installation, relocation and quick 
removal at the end of their use.  The facilities are designed to accommodate 2,180 persons 
during construction, falling to 652 persons during operations 

 

The operations camp includes the following buildings: 

 Cafeteria and kitchen; 

 Laundry; 

 Recreation facility;

 Communications 18.2.5

 Radio Communication System 

The analog radio communication system will operate in the VHF frequency band. It will have 
the ability to communicate with radios located in all areas of the Mine, Plant and 
Administration Areas, across the project footprint. It will include a base station and the 
repeater stations that are necessary for its operation, and the provider will procure all permits 
and licenses for the use of the frequencies that are needed. 

At least 5 radio channels (surveying, operations, supervision, maintenance and emergency) 
will be required for the Project 

 Voice and Data Communication System 

The voice and data communication system will be installed in the different administrative 
offices, hospital, dining rooms, recreation, accommodation, control rooms and checkpoints, 
All buildings will include conduits and trays for cables (voice and data) and for the power 
supply for the telecommunications cabinets. 

The telecommunications cabinets will be distributed in different areas of the plant. The 
cabinets will contain the voice and data network, equipment and accessories, the network of 



NI43-101 Technical Report

  Page 207 

the fire detection system and the controls network. Transmission is via interconnecting fibre 
optic cables. 

 Cable TV Distribution System (CATV) 

Buildings will include conduit required for CATV system.  These will be independent of the 
conduit for other systems, but they will be able to share cable tray, provided metal 
separators are installed. 

The CATV system supplier will supply all the equipment, licenses and accessories for the 
reception and distribution of the TV signal in the housing modules of the camp. 

The CATV channels to be transmitted shall be submitted by the service provider for 
evaluation of CORANI 

 Storm Detection System 

A Storm Detection System will be installed that is capable of detecting storms and 
generating at least 3 alarms (15 Km, 10-5 Km and less than 5 Km distance). 

Two detection sensors will be included, one in located in the camp and another in the plant. 
Each sensor must have the capacity of detecting a storm at 20 km distance as a minimum. 
Each sensor will be connected to a control panel from which alarms will be sent to strobe 
lights, sirens and to an operating station located in the camp security gates. 

Red strobes will be installed, which will activate when the storm is less than 5km away.  In 
the camp, a minimum of 10 strobe lights will be connected to the storm sensor controller. For 
the process plant, 06 strobes with siren will be required. 

All alarms and sensors will be powered by 120 VAC supplied from the instrumentation 
panels located in the electric rooms. 

The alarms will be located at front of the doors of the buildings, in pedestrian zones and in 
parking lots. 

 Water Supply and Management 18.2.6
 
Surface water and groundwater will be used to supply the water needs for the Corani Project. 
Water is classified in two ways:  either as contact water or non-contact water.  Contact water is 
water that comes in contact with mine operations or rocks capable of generating ARD.  Contact 
water includes pit dewatering water, runoff from the open pit, and seepage from the main dump.  
Non-Contact water is generated from runoff from unimpacted ground surfaces.  Both contact 
and non-contact water are stored until required in a dual-cell water pond located near the plant.   
The contact water cell can hold 257,000 m

3
, and the non-contract water cell can hold 572,000 

m
3
. 

 
Section 20 describes the site-wide water balance used to verify that the plant has sufficient 
water in extreme dry conditions.  The plant water requirements are drawn from either the 
contact or non-contract water pond depending on the water quality requirements of the plant.  
The issues of surface water management, water supply, fire protection, sanitary waste 
management, and are presented in the following sections.  

 Surface Water Management Plan 
 

The site surface water management plan was formulated to provide a template for 
management of storm water runoff and stream flows in the Project area. The effective 
management of surface water resources at the Project site is critical to the protection of 
water resources downstream of the Project area. In general, surface water will be managed 
to separate contact water and non-contact water.   Contact water is stored and consumed.  
Non-contact water will generally be diverted around the project facilities, except when 
mineral processing needs dictate the use of some or all the non-contact water. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 208 

From the Site Water Balance (see Section 20), the sources of Contact Water are: 

 Pit dewatering water. 

 Drainage from mine haul roads. 

 Water due to precipitation in process plant area and other facilities. 

 Precipitation over the Contact Water compartment in the water pond. 

 Seepage from the Main Dump (this is primarily water extracted from the consolidation 
and compaction of mine tailings). 

 Water collected in the organic material storage, the surplus material deposit, and the 
solid waste storage areas. 

 
Non-Contact Water sources are: 

 Water from creeks and valleys that have not had any contact with areas disturbed by the 
Project. 

 Precipitation above the non-Contact Water Reservoir in the water Pond. 

 Water runoff from precipitation in all undisturbed areas of the Project. 

The consumption and losses in the Water Balance are as follows: 

 Evaporation, 

 Water replenishment for the Process Plant: 201.1 m
3
 / h, according to the Process Plant 

Water Balance. 

 Water for suppression and dust control on roads and in the mine 

 Permanent discharge of Non-Contact Water to maintain flow in the Chacaconiza Creek 
2.6 L / sec. 

Major surface water conveyance and storage structures have been designed using 
hydrology and hydraulics predictive models. Data used in the models was derived from 
previous and ongoing site investigations.  Conservative assumptions have been applied 
where possible.   

Development of the mine pits will be completed sequentially, with site conditions changing 
frequently. To effectively manage evolving site conditions, surface water management 
features and designs have been presented in "snapshots" for various years during the mine-
life, including the preproduction and closure periods. In practice, the surface water 
management features will be re-evaluated and expanded as necessary each year during the 
dry season in order to accommodate the expanding project footprint. 

During construction, contact water will be directed to settling ponds for recycling and 
consumption (as dust suppression water), as necessary.  

At closure, contact water will be minimized by reclamation activities. However, portions of 
the mineral processing plant will be converted to a water treatment plant to treat any ARD 
impacted leachate or runoff.    

Diversion ditches, culvert systems, ponds, sumps and pipelines, have been designed to 
address the majority of surface water flow at the project site.  In addition, best management 
practices (BMPs) will be employed to minimize erosion and sediment transport as well as 
deposition of sediment at the project site. Erosion control BMPs will include the use of 
temporary diversion ditches, check dams, rock-containment berms, straw wattles/coir logs, 
silt fencing, terraced and bermed slopes, ditch linings, riprap, erosion matting/blankets, and 
rock or geotextile covers. 

 Contact and Non-Contact Water Pond Design 

As mentioned above, the Non-Contact and Contact water pond are located northeast of the 
plant complex (Figure 18-5).  The ponds have approximately 782,000 m

3
 of storage, 

equivalent to approximately 5 months of makeup demand.   



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 209 

The Non-Contact Water pond and Contact Water Pond are adjacent to one another (Figure 
18-5).  The Contact Water Pond is upstream and can store approximately 225,000 m

3
 of 

contact water. The Freshwater Pond is downstream and is capable of storing approximately 
557,000 m

3
 of non-contact water.  Zoned embankment dams will partition the basin into two 

ponds to manage contact and non-contact water separately. The two-pond system is 
intended to minimize the amount of contact water produced at the project while still ensuring 
a dependable water source is available during the dry season.  The dams will have a low-
permeability core, compacted rockfill shells, a seepage cut-off, and internal drainage and 
filter control. The dam separating the Contact Water Pond and Freshwater Pond will be 15 m 
high, with a 1 m freeboard allowance. The Non-Contact Water Pond embankment dam will 
be 35 m high, with a 2m freeboard allowance.  A spillway will allow non-contact water to be 
released downstream.  Water will be pumped from the contact water pond to the plant for 
use in the process circuit.  

The pond size has been determined by the Site Wide Water balance (see Section 20).  It is 
designed from the results of a probabilistic water balance in accordance with best-industry 
practice.  It accommodates enough water to contain (for consumption) the 95 percentile wet 
conditions, and enough water to supply the mine in the 5% dry conditions.   

Additional geotechnical work is required to build the dams (see Section 26).   

The pond system will be constructed prior to other facilities to serve as a construction-phase 
sediment pond. The system will include a low-level outlet to release water during the 
construction phase, and a spillway to release water during operations.    

Site-Wide Water Conveyance and Management 

Precipitation runoff internal to the plant facilities is a minor percentage of the total water 
supply requirement.  Runoff in plant areas will be collected in small sumps and recycled to 
the Process Water Tank. 

Pit water will be collected in sumps excavated into the pit floor.  Sumps are configured as a 
simple box-cut into the un-mined bench below the active pit floor. Water will be pumped from 
the sumps to the plant via skid-mounted pumps and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
pipelines. 

Seepage and runoff from the main dump will report to . a sump will be located at the toe of 
the Main Dump, and water will be pumped from there to the plant or the contact water pond 
via skid-mounted pumps and HDPE pipelines. 

Water may be released from the non-contact water pond during operations when necessary. 
The pond system includes a bypass to allow stream flows in excess of water supply 
demands to be routed around the pond and released to the natural drainage downstream.

The project will utilize a Fresh/Fire Water Tank at an elevation of approximately 4,900 m.a.s.l..  
Water for this tank will be drawn from the non-contact pond.  Fresh water for plant use would be 
drawn from the upper nozzle on the tank to ensure an adequate reserve for a fire water supply. 
Fresh water will also be drawn from the upper nozzle for the drinking water treatment plant to 
supply potable water to sinks, eye-wash stations, and drinking fountains throughout the 
facilities. A nozzle at the bottom of the tank provides water for fire suppression (Section 18.3.2).   

Fresh water for the Administration area and camp area (near the main entrance) will be taken 
directly from the Imagina Mayu River at coordinates 320,600 East, 8,456,155 North, through a 
catchment and pumping system located on the shore. The water will then be pumped to a Fresh 
Water Tank located in the Camp. The fresh water will be treated for sanitary use and cleaning.  
Additional treatment will be provided for the kitchen. The water for human consumption will be 
provided from the fresh water tank at the 5110 elevation described in the paragraph below.  

The Fresh Water Tank is at 5,110 m.a.s.l.  Water from this tank will provide freshwater and fire 
suppression for the Administration area.  Water for camp use will be drawn from the upper 
nozzle on the storage tank, while water for fire suppression will be withdrawn from the bottom 
nozzle to maintain sufficient capacity in the lower part for fire suppression at the camp.  

All wastewater from the Camp will be collected through a drainage system and taken to a 
Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) also located inside the camp.  Wastewater will be treated 
to comply with the corresponding LMPs to be discharged to the Chacoconiza river at the 
coordinates 322,079 East, 8,456,150 North.

 Fire Protection 

A fresh water pipeline will deliver up to 40 m
3
/hr of fresh water from the Plant Water Pond to 

the project Fresh/Fire Water Tank, located at the project site at an elevation of approximately 
4,875 m.a.s.l. The Primary Crusher and mine services area (Truck Shop/Fuel Facility) are 
areas are too low in elevation to receive fire suppression water by gravity feed. As a result, a 
fire pump will be required to provide water at sufficient volume and pressure for fire 
protection for these facilities.  

Fresh water for plant use would be drawn from the upper of two nozzles located on the tank 
at an elevation high enough to ensure an adequate reserve for a fire water supply. From the 
lower nozzle, a buried firewater loop will supply fire water to hydrants located throughout the 
concentrator area, the ancillary buildings, and the laboratory. 

Individual hand-held fire extinguishers will also be located throughout the offices and work 
areas. In addition, a fire truck will be available to service the camp site as well as the main 
site. 

The off-site Administration Building, Gatehouse and Security Office, located close to the 
Mine Access Road and entrance to the mine, will be provided with hand-held fire 
extinguishers. These extinguishers will be distributed throughout the offices and common 
areas in accordance with North American and Peruvian Fire Codes. 

 Sanitary Sewage 

A packaged, activated-sludge wastewater treatment plant will treat sewage from the process 
facilities, laboratory, warehouse, plant maintenance building, truck shop, and tire shop. 
Treated effluent goes to a septic field next to the wastewater treatment plant.   

The camp facilities, the administration building, and the security office and gatehouse 
located close to the Mine Access Road will also be served by a package, activated-sludge 
sewage treatment plant, and the treated water will be disposed of through an adjacent septic 
field.

 Power Supply and Power Distribution 18.2.7

A new 138 kV power transmission line is necessary to provide power to the Corani project. A 
new power substation will connect with Power Transmission Line L-1013 (San Gabán II – San 
Rafael – Azángaro) as the power source.   A new 138 kV power transmission line will be built to 
connect the Antapata substation to the Main Corani substation to be built near the Project's 
main process buildings.  The proposed alignment for the 138kV line (Figure 18-1) was provided 
by Promotora (2015). The transmission line route was selected based on using the route 
already provided by the Project's Mine Access Road.   

Power will be distributed from the Main Corani Substation from a pair of step down transformers 
(one in use, one, standby) to the distribution voltage of 13.8 kV.  Both overhead and 
underground power lines will be used to distribute power throughout the plant site and 
administration area.  A 13.8 kV transmission line with a length of approximately 13 km will 
connect the mine site to the residential camp site. 

 New Antapata Substation 

This substation will be connected to the San Gabán – Azángaro 138 kV Transmission Line at 
approximately 55 Km from the San Gabán Substation.  The new Macusani substation will 
include the installation of three (3) switch yards at 138 kV. 

 Transmission Line 

The link between the Macusani and Corani substations is made through a 138 kV – 60 Hz 
transmission line, approximately 37 km in length.  The line includes: 

 A metallic self-supporting lattice towers; 

 Aluminum alloy conductors (AAAC) with a 300 mm
2
 nominal section; 

 Two ground wires (one steel galvanized wire and another OPGW-type wire with 16 
optical fibers); 

 Glass insulators with a 146mm spacing and a 280mm diameter; 

 380 mm leakage distance; and 

 A 160 kN electromechanical rupture load. 

The projected transmission line has the following technical characteristics: 

 Rated voltage: 138 kV 

 Maximum voltage: 145 kV 

 System Frequency: 60 Hz 

 Length: 29,6 km 

 Design power: 65 MW 

 Number of circuits: 01 

 Number of conductors / phase: 01 

 Circuit layout: Triangular 

 Guard Cable: 02, Type EHS and OPGW 

 Conductors: Type AAAC 

 Structures: Self-supporting towers of A ° G ° 

 Insulators: Tempered glass 

The insulator chains in the suspension are made up of fifteen (15) insulators and the 
insulator chains in the grounding have sixteen (16) insulators and a reinforced concrete

foundation, forming a set of four separate columns.  Each column will be made of corrugated 
steel-reinforced concrete with a formulation of f'c=210 kg/cm

2
 

 New Corani Substation 

This substation will require the installation of a 138/13.8 kV transformer. The 138kV side will 
have a power switch and the power transformer, for an installation altitude of 5000 masl, will 
have an automatic regulation load of: 

138 ±10x1%/13.8/4.16 kV - 48/48/16 MVA (ONAN) - 60/60//20 MVA (ONAF) 

It will also have a YNyn0(d1) connection (or vector) group as well as a regulation board. It 
also includes six cells at 13.8 kV and an automatic capacitive reactive compensation bank of 
5 MVAR.  

Power will be distributed from the receiving substation at the Project site through 
underground duct banks to nearby major loads via local substations. Power distribution to all 
other areas, such as tailing water reclaim, the administrative services building located close 
to the concentrator, laboratory, fresh water pumping, crushing station and truck shop, and to 
the mine, will be via overhead 13.8 kV power lines. 

 Communications System 18.2.8

The project off-site telecommunications will be served by a fiber optic telecommunications link 
to a data centre in Lima that will be underbuilt on the 138 kV transmission line from the 
Antapata substation. Telephone and data communications including voice, data and internet 
communications will be provided for the mine site and Macusani. The communications system 
will connect to a central communications centre, which will include a telephone/fax PBX and 
network servers for email, internet and data services. Other network servers to manage site 
operations and for data storage will also be located in the central communications centre, with 
the exception of the process servers which will be located at the processing facility. The mine 
site telephone system will link all essential areas of the site together, and through the satellite 
system, to outside of the project site.  

The mine radio system will include one base station and a control-tower station at the mine from 
which all mining equipment and haul trucks will be dispatched and controlled, and a number of 
repeater stations will be installed. One station will provide coverage to the tailing area, and 
others are required to extend coverage throughout the mine site and to Macusani. 

All vehicles will be equipped with radios and essential personnel will have hand-held radios. Key 
personnel will also be equipped with mobile telephones. Cellular phones will have coverage to 
Macusani as a safety precaution. 

  Waste Rock and Tailings Management Facilities 18.2.9

Detailed Engineering of the Mine Waste Rock and Tailings Deposit has been carried out based 
on conventional technology for disposition of mine waste rock and process plant tailings. The 
basic design criteria prepared by Anddes have been used as a reference, throughout the 
project and are included in Chapter 2 of Document 1105.10.11-5-100-02-ITE-001 

The civil design of the deposit includes the levelling of the foundation, removal of organic 
material, construction of the sub-drainage system and seepage, collection pond and disposal 
plan for mine waste rock and process tailings by year, and the dump access ramps for dumping 
of waste rock and filtered tailings. 

The design is based on local slopes of 2,2H: 1V and global 3H: 1V, in accordance with stability 
analyses and to criteria defined in agreement with Bear Creek Mines. The Storage should be 
stacked every 10 m in height and intermediate stools with setbacks of 7.5 m between layers. 
Maximum height of the storage pile is 24 m.  The base of the deposit will be composed of a 
layer of non-acid generating waste rock deposited during stripping operations until April 2021 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 214 

and from May 2021 process tailings together with the mine waste rock will be deposited. The 
stacking ramps were designed with a total width of approximately 29 m and a maximum slope 
of 10%, based on the mine trucks operating parameters. 

The filtered tailings and waste rock deposit is a large structure that will store mine waste and 
tailings, reaching a maximum height of 320 m on a complex topography.  The installation of 
geotechnical instrumentation in certain areas, in order to monitor the displacements, and 
groundwater level in the structure, and also accelerographic stations to understand the seismic 
response in certain areas before a seismic event will be necessary. With the proper 
instrumentation, the displacements and variations in the conditions must be evaluated during 
the operation stage 

Nineteen disposal stages, including the starting platform, beginning in year 2021 and through to 
2039, in accordance with the mine plan for life of the project provided by BCM in June 2017 are 
foreseen. The arrangement during the stacking of the deposit considers the formation of the 
starting platform (with NAG mine stripping material) corresponding to the production of part of 
2021, a stripping layer NAG with a minimum thickness of 10 m on the base surface, a thickness 
of at least 20 m of NAG waste on the exposed side of the deposit and a NAG stripping layer 
with a minimum thickness of 1 m at the top of the final configuration of the deposit to provide an 
encapsulation of the PAG waste rock. The interposed disposal of stripped and filtered waste will 
allow drainage of excess water from the tailings through the waste rock channels.  To provide 
continuity to maximize the drainage during the disposal of the waste rock, windows must be left 
in a random manner, leaving isolated areas where no waste will be placed, thus facilitating the 
drainage of excess water from tailings to the base of the deposit.

19 Market Studies and Contracts 

 Concentrate Marketing 19.1

 Markets 19.1.1

The project will produce a lead concentrate, containing the majority of the recovered silver as 
well as a separate zinc concentrate. The high silver grade of the lead concentrate will make it a 
desirable concentrate for smelters. The concentrates will be sold and shipped to Asian smelters. 

 Contracts 19.1.2

There are no established contracts for the sale of concentrate currently in place for this project. 

 Concentrate Transport Logistics 19.1.3

Concentrate will be shipped in bulk from the mine site to the port of Matarani at an estimated 
charge of US$72.36/wmt. This estimated cost was supplied by Penfold Limited within the 
"Corani Sales and Marketing Study," June 2017. 

19.1.3.1 Concentrate Transport Insurance 

Insurance will be applied to the provisional invoice value of the concentrate to cover transport 
from the mine site to the smelter.  

19.1.3.2  Owner's Representation 

An Owner's representation will be applied to the provisional invoice value of the concentrate to 
cover attendance during unloading at the smelter, supervising the taking of samples for 
assaying, and determining moisture content. 

19.1.3.3  Transportation Options 

The decision was made to transport concentrate by container trucks to the Peruvian Port of 
Matarini. The container trucks will meet all required environmental regulations and are fully 
enclosed. The first five years of lead and zinc concentrate production will be approximately 
110,000 mtpy and 80,000 mtpy, respectively, dropping down to an average of 70,000 mtpy for 
lead concentrate and 45,000 mtpy for zinc concentrate for the remaining 13 years of the mine 
life. 

For this study, it is assumed that the concentrate will be sold to the Asian market. The 
transportation cost is estimated at US$32.16 per ton for shipping to the smelter by ocean freight, 
plus an additional port handling charge of $15.10. The Matarini port has authorization for 
handling zinc concentrates in bulk; however, authorization does not exist for lead concentrates. 
Therefore, the lead concentrate will need to be shipped in super sacks and containers. The 
combined shipping and handling price for container and bulk concentrates is currently very 
similar, within less than $1.00/wmt. 

The total freight cost including overland freight plus ocean freight and handling fees for 
concentrates shipped from the Corani plant to the smelter is US$119.62/ wet metric ton.  

 Smelter Terms 19.1.4

Smelter terms and penalties were supported by an independent market analysis (Penfold, 
2017). The data from this study were used to evaluate the revenue, charges, premiums, and 
penalties that are presented in detail below. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 217 

19.1.4.1 Sale of Lead and Zinc Concentrates 

Every smelter has different rates for impurities depending on the normal feed. Higher levels of 
impurities will decrease the value of concentrates delivered to the smelter. 

19.1.4.2 Zinc Treatment Cost and Premiums  

Spot zinc treatment charges are half annual terms. Zinc metal concentrates are in demand due 
to shortages, and, as a result, the spot treatment charge has been reduced inversely to the Zinc 
LME price. 

19.1.4.3 Lead Treatment Cost and Premiums 

The price of lead has been fairly constant over the last several years and appears to be stable 
for the next few years. Table 19-1 shows the assays for materials found in each type of 
concentrate for this project.

Additional test work will be performed to investigate lowering the quantities of some penalty 
elements; for example, reducing the amount of SiO2 in the Zinc concentrate as well as As and 
Sb in both concentrates. Lowering these impurities in the final concentrate will increase the 
value of the concentrate to potential smelters.

19.1.5.3 Metal Prices for Study 

The metals prices used for this study were as listed in Table 19-2. 

Table 19-2: Metals Prices Used for Study 

Material  

Zinc US$1.10/lb 

Lead US$0.95/lb 

Silver US$18/troy oz 

Due to size and remote location of this deposit it was felt a longer period of metal pricing should 
be considered, beyond the 3-Year trailing average. Base metal deposits by their nature require 
long lead times, and the current price may have limited relevance to the price when the project 
is constructed. For this reason, it was determined that combining a 3-Year trailing price average 
with a 3-Year forward price would have the most relevance.

BMO Capital Markets supplied a "Street Consensus Commodity Estimates" for BCMC as of July 
2017. BMO utilized 35 sources, 32 and 29 for silver, zinc and lead estimated future pricing, 
respectively. 

Penfold Limited completed the "Corani Sales and Marketing Study" as of June 2017 for BCM. 
The study was a comprehensive review and synopsis of the lead-silver concentrates market, 
zinc concentrates market, and logistics costs. In addition, pro forma concentrate sales invoices 
were provided as well as metal price forecasts. Price forecasts for the three commodities were 
from recognized banking institutions, metal brokers, and market analysts. Penfold credited 35 
sources for silver future pricing, 28 for zinc, and 24 for lead. 

The results from the BMO Capital information and the Penfold Study were averaged to generate 
a 3-Year Forward Average Commodity price. The 3-Year Trailing Average Commodity price 
was based on London Metal Exchange closing prices. The 6-Year Average within Table 19-3 is 
the average of the 3-Year Trailing and 3-Year Forward pricing. The Base Case Pricing 
represents the prices used for the base case economic evaluation.

Base case pricing compares favourably with current spot pricing, (August month-end 2017); 
lead and zinc pricing are both well below current spot prices. Silver is slightly above the August 
month-end spot price by approximately 3%. The pricing used in this study is felt to be 
reasonable and rational by GRE.

20 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or 
Community Impact 

Principal environmental risks associated with this type of project fall into these categories:  

 Potential risks to air quality from dust; 

 Potential degradation of surface and groundwater quality; 

 Potential changes to the volume of surface and groundwater; 

 Visual impacts due to the creation of pits, mine waste disposal facilities, roads, and other 
mine workings; and 

 Permanent changes to land use resulting from mining activities. 

The existing Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) quantifies the magnitude, 
extent, and mitigation of risks and potential impacts related to the old project configuration 
which included a conventional wet tailings facility and related water supply infrastructure. The 
new project configuration developed for the current study will be incorporated into a modification 
of the ESIA to be completed subsequent to the publication of this report. Project optimization 
performed for the current study resulted in a reduced project footprint, a reduction in water 
consumption, and other changes which are anticipated to reduce environmental impacts 
associated with project development relative to the previous study. In a number of cases, the 
development of the Project is anticipated to improve existing environmental conditions. 

Peruvian Law 28090 regulates the obligations and procedures mine owners must follow in 
relation to mine closure, and requires that a mine closure plan be approved and financial 
guarantee for the cost of implementation be established. The plan must describe the 
rehabilitation methods and their costs for the operation, closure, and post-closure phases. The 
plan must allow for progressive closure, with mine owners reporting semiannually to the Ministry 
of Energy and Mines on progress with the implementation of the approved plan. 

As required under Peruvian regulations, a preliminary closure plan was submitted and later 
approved in September 2014 (Walsh, 2014). A revised closure plan based on the current 
project configuration will be submitted to Peruvian regulators following modification of the ESIA .  

The development of closure concepts for this study has considered International Finance (IFC) 
guidelines and industry standards in addition to Peruvian regulatory requirements. The general 
approach to mine reclamation and closure developed at this time is described below. The 
estimated cost (based on the Preliminary Closure Plan) has been incorporated into the overall 
cost estimate for the Project. 

The sections below present the following: 

 A summary of existing studies; 

 Known permitting considerations; 

 A brief description of the strategies for environmental management during operations, 
reclamation and closure; 

 Socioeconomic and community considerations.

 Environmental Baseline Studies 20.1

Environmental sampling has been ongoing since July 2009. Extensive additional site 
characterization was conducted in 2011 and the first half of 2012; the results of these studies 
were presented in the ESIA (AMEC, 2012). The following sections summarize the existing 
environmental data. 

 Summary of Air, Noise, Groundwater and Surface Water Studies 20.1.1

Below is a summary of the results from the currently-published baseline studies for air, noise, 
and water:  

 The air quality results were below the maximum permissible limits set by the national 
environmental standard for air, reflecting the absence of significant airborne pollutant-
generating activities in the zone.  

 Noise measurements were taken near populated areas. The results were below the 
maximum thresholds specified in the national environmental standard for residential zones. 

 Groundwater appears to be located in shallow aquifers comprised of alluvial, glacial, and 
aeolian deposits that lie over low-permeability basement rocks. Results from the site 
investigation indicated that the shallow aquifers have high storage but moderate to low 
hydraulic conductivity. Little evidence exists for a conductive and extensive hard-rock aquifer. 
In general, it appears that groundwater resources in the Project area are not sufficiently large 
to be useful for agricultural, domestic, or industrial use. However, the protection of the 
groundwater resources from impact is part of the focus of the ESIA and future environmental 
planning.  

 Surface water samples exhibited highly to slightly acidic characteristics during sampling 
events conducted throughout the year. These acidic conditions are related to naturally-
occurring oxidation of mineralized rocks exposed at the site and from areas previously 
disturbed by historic mining activities. Several metal concentrations exceeded the national 
environmental water standards. Similarly, some metal concentrations measured in 
sediments exceeded Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines. As a result, the major 
drainages leaving the Project area do not currently meet national environmental water 
standards. 

 Summary of Biological Studies 20.1.2

The biological baseline study describes the ecosystem of the site and the species abundance, 
richness, biodiversity, and endemism. The species present on the site have been cross-
referenced with threatened species lists (international and national). Of particular note is that: 

 A number of flora are included on the national threatened species list but not on international 
conservation lists, including umbellifer, certain daisy species, and Valerina nivalis.  

 Three vegetation species found are considered endemic to Peru, of which Nototriche pelicea 
is considered endemic to the Department of Puno.  

 A number of mammal species identified in the biological baseline study are included in both 
national and/or international threatened species lists, including Hippocamelus antisensis 
(north Andean deer), Leopardus colocolo (pampus cat), Puma concolor (puma) and Vicugna 
vicugna (vicuña). However only Vicugna was observed in the field. The remaining species 
were recorded based on sightings from members of the local community; therefore, their 
presence on the site is not confirmed.  

 Summary of Geochemical Studies 20.1.3

A geochemical waste characterization program was developed to assess the acid rock drainage 
(ARD) behavior of, and potential leaching of contained metals from, all mine wastes associated 
with the Project. This program included static tests, LECO Furnace total sulfur and total carbon 
assays, and onsite and laboratory kinetic cell tests, as presented in the ESIA (AMEC, 2012). 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 222 

These were combined with geologic and metallurgical characterization of lithologies and 
material types. The conclusions from this work included the following: 

 The geochemistry of the waste rock will be dominated by certain mineralization types; in 
particular, mineralized lithic tuff with fine black sulphides (FBS) and mineralized tuff with 
pyrite and marcasite (PM). 

 Whole rock analysis of waste rock samples indicated that several metals of environmental 
and processing concern exist at high levels; synthetic precipitation leaching procedure 
testing suggested that many of these metals are readily leachable. 

 The kinetic tests showed that many waste types were acid generating, though the behavior 
among certain mineralization types was mixed. 

 The ABA indicator testing of the tailings suggested that the tailings would be potentially acid 
generating (PAG) material due to the presence of residual sulfides. 

Additional geochemical humidity cell kinetic tests were initiated in 2014 by Amphos 21 (Amphos 
21 Consulting Peru, SAC, 2014). Initial results from these tests confirmed previous kinetic cell 
testing by demonstrating that the PMT is non-acid generating, and that sulfidized waste often 
produces acidic leachate. 

 Permitting Considerations 20.2

Refer to Section 4.4 for an explanation of the permits required to execute the Project.  

 Environmental Management During Operations, Reclamation, and 20.3
Closure 

The project design approach considers implementation of best management practices and a 
sustainable approach to project development. The project development approach has 
incorporated the ability to close or reclaim project facilities progressively throughout the project 
life. A more detailed description of the potential impacts associated with the project 
development can be found in the ESIA and Closure Plan studies. 

 Environmental Management Objectives 20.3.1

The operational environmental management objectives are to identify potential and viable 
measures to mitigate environmental impacts that can be implemented during the operation, 
reclamation, closure, and post-closure periods. These measures are intended to alleviate 
potential long-term impacts from mining operations and to minimize long-term liability. Current 
conditions at the Project site show a degree of degradation of water quality in the general 
vicinity of the mineralized zones. This is due to naturally-occurring oxidation of sulfide-bearing 
materials, which has resulted in a depression of pH and an increase in dissolved metals and 
salts in surface waters leaving the Project area. In addition, historic mining activity within the 
main Corani basin has resulted in the presence of underground mine workings, waste rock, and 
historic mine tailings which are a significant source of ARD. 

The measures to be applied for reclamation and closure of the Project are intended to return the 
receiving environment to a condition that is, at worst, equal to the measured baseline 
conditions, and to the extent practical, better than these conditions. The closure measures are 
not intended to change the naturally occurring conditions at the site, nor are they intended to 
mitigate the effects of historic mining within the project area, apart from where future mining 
activity can be used to implement mitigation measures in the course of the proposed mining, 
processing, and mine waste management defined for the Project. Historic mine areas will be 
closed/mined out in the pit areas and areas directly in the footprint of the Main Dump. Historic 
mine workings that are not directly affected by mining activity, but are still within the catchment 
area of the mine's water management facilities and are contributing ARD to the facilities will 
also be closed. Moreover, it should be noted that although a large number of the historic mining 
facilities contributing to ARD will be removed during Corani mine operations and closure, a 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 223 

significant portion of the undisturbed bedrock at the site is naturally acid-generating, and will 
continue to produce ARD during operations and closure. 

The following activities performed during operations, reclamation and closure are intended to 
mitigate and minimize generation of ARD: 

 Encapsulation of PAG tailings and waste rock within the Main Dump; 

 Extraction of legacy mine waste and disposal within PAG encapsulation cells inside the Main 
Dump; 

 Saturation and encapsulation of PAG tailings and waste rock within the pit backfill areas; 

 Concurrent placement of reclamation covers over the Main Dump and the Este backfill 
during operations; 

 Segregation of contact waters from non-contact waters and consumption of contact water, 
and a portion of naturally acidified runoff from the watershed, in the flotation plant during 
operations; 

 Consumption of all contact water by the plant.  

 Backfilling of the Minas and Main pits to prevent formation of pit lakes and placement of an 
ET cover. 

In the following sections, the overall site conditions that affect the selection and implementation 
of the reclamation and closure measures are identified. The reclamation and closure 
considerations for individual project components and facilities are then presented. The general 
items considered in estimation of costs for the reclamation, closure, and post-closure periods 
are also identified. A large proportion of the reclamation and closure measures will be 
completed as part of operation of the mine. Cost estimation for reclamation and closure includes 
only those activities required following the end of mining and mineral processing. For example, 
the cost for pit backfilling does not include the cost for backfilling that occurs during the course 
of normal operations which is covered under mining costs. Additional information regarding the 
cost estimation for specific items is provided in the relevant sections of this document. 

 General Site Conditions Relevant to Environmental Management 20.3.2

As described in Section 7 of this document, some areas of the project experience naturally-
occurring ARD. Consequently, in these areas, naturally occurring growth media are limited or 
absent. Key areas without soils capable of sustaining vegetation include: 

 The valley that will contain the Main Dump and portions of the plant complex; 

 Large portions of the mountain slopes in and around orebody; and 

 Higher elevations of the project site and areas with exposed bedrock. 

The areas not capable of sustaining vegetation are readily apparent from the color aerial photo 
shown in Figure 20-1. It is important to note that many of these areas will not sustain vegetation 
post-closure.  

The reclamation and closure measures identified in the following subsections have been 
developed to minimize post-closure management requirements for the areas of disturbance 
related to mining activities. However, as described further below, it is anticipated that some 
long-term post-closure management and monitoring will be required for an extended period 
following mine reclamation and closure.

 Project Components and Facilities 20.3.3

The following sections describe the environmental management plans for specific project 
components and facilities. Additional design details can be found in Section 18. The main 
project components and facilities with environmental management and/or reclamation 
considerations include the following: 

 The Este, Minas and Main Corani open pit areas; 

 Waste rock and tailings co-disposal areas included in the Main Dump and in-pit backfills; 

 The plant facilities, crushing facilities, tailings dewatering plant, and related infrastructure;  

 The surface water management infrastructure and Plant Contact Water Pond, and the Plant 
Non-Contact water pond; 

 Soil stockpiles areas; 

It is not the intent to identify all aspects of environmental management, reclamation and closure 
measures at this time. Rather, only the major aspects with significant cost implications are 
considered.  

The project configuration at the end of mining, just prior to closure, is shown in Figure 20-2 
shows the preliminary closure plan concepts described in the following sections.

  Page 227 

 Open Pits 20.3.4

Mining of the open pit will occur over a period of approximately 18 years. Upon completion of 
mining, the Este, Minas, and Main pit areas will form a discontinuous horseshoe-shaped 
excavation around the east, north and west sides of the Corani valley.  

20.3.4.1 Bodedal Soils 
Since the 2015 FS, the pits have been redesigned to avoid disturbing bofedal soils. However, 
localized disturbance may occur.  
 
 
Localized stockpiles of bofedal material will be established for use in reclamation and closure 
activities. Segregation of the materials will be performed to separate organic material from the 
rest of the excavated soils and unconsolidated materials. Collection and storage of these 
materials will be maximized to the extent practical. 

20.3.4.2 Pit Water Management 
 

Several natural drainages will be tributary to the fully developed pit area, and these drainages 
will continue to contribute surface runoff toward the pit. During operations, this water will be 
diverted around the pit or routed into the channel that is retained between the Este and Minas 
pits. This water will be classified as non-contact and can be discharged to the environment, if 
desired. However, runoff generated within the footprint of the pits and groundwater inflow to the 
pit will be collected in sumps and pumped to contact water pond for use as make-up water.  
 
The goal of the surface water management system at closure will be to reduce the volume of 
water requiring treatment by separating water that has been in contact with potentially acid 
generating material from water that has been in contact with only non-acid generating material. 
Water that has been in contact with potentially acid generating material (runoff from exposed 
PAG pit slopes and seepage emerging from the pit backfill) will be piped to a water treatment 
plant located at the former plant site. This water will be treated as necessary before being 
released downstream. It is anticipated that a High-Density Sludge (HDS) water treatment and 
neutralization system will be employed. 
 
Water from the areas up-gradient of the pit will be diverted to drop structures that will convey 
the water over the exposed pit wall, and then routed over the pit backfill areas in lined channels 
or in the channel between Este and Minas pits, before release to natural drainages downstream. 
Diversions will be built to minimize runoff from non-acid generating portions of the pit wall. It is 
anticipated that this water will not require treatment and therefore will be routed around acid-
generating portions of the pit wall and released downstream. 

20.3.4.3 Backfill 
 

The Corani pits will be backfilled for the purpose of storing waste rock and tailings, and also to 
prevent formation of pit lakes which could contain acidic water with elevated dissolved metal 
and salt constituents. Concurrent reclamation and closure of the mine pit will be performed as 
feasible during mine operations and completed at closure. 
 
Backfilling of the Este pit will take place during mine operations using tailings and waste rock 
generated by ongoing mining of the Minas and Main pits during that time. Tailings and waste 
rock will be placed in designated backfill zones. After backfilling has been completed, an 
engineered soil cover will be installed over the backfilled area. The cover will consist of a layer 
of NAG material overlain by topsoil or bofedal soils and will limit the amount of precipitation 
water that can enter the backfill thereafter.  
 
Mining in both Minas and Main pits prevents backfilling of this pit area until the end of the mine 
life. Backfilling of the Minas/Main pit area will occur over the course of several months directly 
following completion of mining. The area will be backfilled by importing waste rock and tailings 
temporarily placed in the Main Dump. Backfill will be placed to a level high enough to ensure 
that the final backfilled surface remains above the water table after hydrologic stabilization 
occurs during the post-closure period.  



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 228 

 
After this material has been placed, available water will be diverted to artificially recharge the 
backfill, saturating the material as quickly as possible, and limiting the time during which the 
backfill and the pit walls are exposed to atmospheric oxygen. Artificial recharge of the Este 
backfill is not required due to the low hydraulic conductivity of the tailings backfill.  
 
The final Minas/Main backfill surface will be graded to resemble the topography of the adjoining 
lower bofedal area, and to merge into that topography. Stockpiled topsoil will be used to cover 
the backfill, with the intention of promoting gradual natural establishment of a vegetated 
environment that is an extension of the lower bofedal. A preliminary model of the cover was 
developed using a numerical model to evaluate the performance of various engineered cover 
configurations. Based upon the model results, direct infiltration through the cover is expected to 
be reduced to a minimal level following cover installation.  
 
 
A hydrogeological model was developed to simulate the groundwater flow through the backfill 
after flooding of the Minas/Main backfill and installation of the surface water management and 
cover systems. The model results indicate a relatively small seepage rate emerging from the 
backfill. Seepage emerging from the backfill will be collected and routed to the treatment plant 
as necessary. 

 Main Dump 20.3.5

The Main Dump is described in Section 18; this section covers the reclamation of the main 
dump.  

During operations, dump slopes will be progressively reclaimed with the placement of previously 
stockpiled natural soils from the base of the dump. Runoff from these areas will be routed 
around the active dump areas and released downstream to natural drainages. Following the 
placement of the reclamation cover, runoff from the reclaimed surface will be directed to toe 
ditches and routed beyond the facility. At closure, any seepage from beneath the toe of the 
dump will be collected and treated as necessary prior to release.  

The current condition of the ground in Quebrada Muerta beneath the Main Dump is un-
vegetated and sterile. The goal of the closure plan is to establish conditions similar to those that 
existed prior to mining activities, and therefore, does not include the establishment of vegetation 
on the Main Dump. The closure plan includes erosion control methods in place of vegetation. 

 Plant Facilities & Related Infrastructure 20.3.6

During operations, runoff generated in the area of the plant footprint is considered contact water 
and will be diverted to a sump and pumped to the contact water pond for use as makeup water. 
As part of reclamation and closure activities, a portion of the mineral process plant will be 
converted to a water treatment plant. Water from the surface water management system will be 
routed to the plant, and treated as necessary prior to release to the receiving environment with 
a high-density sludge (HDS) treatment system.  

At the end of the operating life of the plant, with the exception of those components to be 
utilized in the post-closure water treatment system, the plant will be decommissioned and 
demolished. Where viable, equipment will be salvaged, sold, or transported offsite as scrap 
material. A small amount of infrastructure will be left in place for post-closure use. This would 
include a water treatment and equipment storage area, the office building, and equipment 
storage required for the maintenance and monitoring of post-closure site conditions. All other 
structures will be demolished, and the demolition debris buried in an on-site landfill. This would 
include the majority of the plant buildings, truck shop, explosives magazine, crushing system, 
warehouses, reagent storage areas, etc. The main power line utilized during operations is 
retained for the HDS treatment plant. All major pipelines will be either salvaged or, if buried, left 
in place.  



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 229 

Concrete foundations for the plant will be broken up and buried in place in most areas. The 
degree to which they are broken up will be determined by the ability to create a natural-
appearing post-mining topography with a natural drainage pattern. Leaving foundations in place 
may be considered where this can be accomplished without breakage. A suitable soil cover will 
be placed over these areas to facilitate the function and appearance of natural ground.  

Once the off-site man camp is no longer required, the camp will be converted to an alternative 
beneficial use by a future custodian and/or local community representative. The main access 
road and haul roads left at the end of mining operations that will be required to provide access 
to the site, and access to locations necessary for maintenance and monitoring of the project 
areas, will be reduced in size to that of similar local roads in the project region. A portion of the 
internal roads will be removed by ripping, and reclaimed to conditions similar to the surrounding 
area; the remainder of the roads will be converted to community use. 

 Site Wide Water Balance 20.3.7

A project wide water balance was developed for the operational mine life as part of project 
design. The water balance was created to satisfy the following requirements; 

 To prove that sufficient water exists to run the plant, even during extreme dry conditions; 

 To prove that contact water can be consume by the operation, thus alleviating the need 
for water treatment and discharge; 

 To ensure that sufficient non-contact water exists to maintain environmental baseflow 
conditions in the Chacaconiza drainage basin downstream from the Project. 

The water balance considers the inflows and outflows to each Project area over the operational 
mine life. These flows are varied over the life of the project on a monthly basis to determine 
balance of contact and non-contact water. This variation also occurs as facilities are operated 
over time. For example, as the pit increases in size, the amount of contact water increases. In 
contrast, following the ramp-up period, the annual process consumptive use of water remains 
steady over the life of the mine. 

In accordance with industry best-practice, a probabilistic water balance has been created. The 
model determines the probable ranges of conditions that may exist during operations. The 
model automatically varies a number of multiple climate input parameters, (such as 
precipitation, snowfall and evaporation) based on a statistical analysis of baseline historic data. 
The resultant possible combinations form the basis of a stochastic, probabilistic model built in 
the GoldSim modeling platform. GoldSim creates a stochastic dataset of probabilistic model 
iteration, and from these iterations, one is able to select a range of design criteria. For this 
study, the 95% wet and the 5% dry conditions are used as the primary criteria for water 
management infrastructure.  

A water balance is a dynamic tool for project planning. Section 26 outlines additional analysis 
necessary prior to project construction.  

The water balance model is based on climate parameters modeled by Amphos 21. Precipitation 
inflows are based on a one thousand stochastic iterations of a synthetic precipitation series that 
include both the 100-year wet storm and the 100-year dry storm. Modeling the project under 
1,000 different climate combinations simulates the natural variability that would be expected 
over the project life.  

The database used for this analysis comes from a site weather station that has been recording 
hourly data since December 2008, and flume stream gauging stations that have been recording 
hourly data at the site since 2012. Site-specific runoff coefficients were calculated using the 
combined data record available from 2012 to 2017. Incorporation of the site-specific data 
measurements offers a significant improvement over previous studies, which relied on literature 
based assumptions for runoff coefficients. Groundwater inflows to the mine pits were estimated

based on a transient MODFLOW groundwater model reflecting the mine plan and pit backfilling 
schedule. 

During Project development and operations, a surface water management system will be 
developed (see Section 18) to route runoff from areas of disturbance, groundwater collected in 
the pit, and seepage from the Main Dump to the contact water pond and then to the process 
plant for use as makeup water. The capacity of the collection pond is approximately 830,000 m

3
, 

and will consist of two separate cells: a non-contact water cell (in the downstream portion, with 
a volume of 572,000 m

3
) and a contact water cell (in the upstream portion, with a volume of 

257,000 m
3
). Both contact water and non-contact water stored in the ponds will be used to 

supply the plant during the dry season, as required.  

Environmental baseflow in the Chacaconiza drainage will be maintained during Project 
development subjected to the natural availability of flow in the catchment area. Concepts related 
to the surface water management plan are presented in more detail in Section 18.  

The total process water demand is discussed in Section 18. The process plant makeup water 
demand is satisfied from water available in the watershed, with the following water supply 
priority order: contact water (runoff and baseflow from disturbed areas and pit inflow), non-
contact water (runoff and baseflow from undisturbed areas in the catchment), water from the 
upstream cell of the Plant Water Pond (contact water and stored non-contact water), and finally, 
water from the downstream cell of the Plant Water Pond (stored non-contact water). Once the 
plant demand is met, the excess non-contact water from the remaining area(s) is either stored 
in the Plant Water Pond or released downstream. Under the 95% wet condition (see above), all 
contact water is consumed by the plant or temporarily stored in the upstream cell of the Plant 
Water Pond and is not discharged to the environment. Conversely, the combined pond contains 
sufficient water to supply the plant under the 5% dry condition (see above).  

Figure 20-3 displays the contact water pond storage volume under all modeled probabilities and 
Figure 20-4 displays the non-contact water pond storage volume under all modeled probabilities. 
The black line in the chart displays average storage conditions and the 5

Figure 20-4 Non-Contact Water Pond Storage 

 

The water available in the watershed greatly exceeds what is required for operations on an 
annual basis. This ensures that the non-contact water pond is never dry, and that environmental 
baseflow can be maintained, even under extreme conditions. Conversely, the project has 
sufficient consumptive requirements and storage capacity to consume all contact water.  

 Closure Phase Water Management 20.3.8

The contact water cell of the plant water pond will be used during closure as a flow equalization 
pond for the water treatment plant. Use of the pond will be used in the first year of closure to 
store ARD-impacted water while the process plant is converted into an ARD treatment plant. 

At closure, the non-contact pond could constitute a potential resource for the downstream 
communities. Transfer of ownership and operation of the pond to a group of the local 
communities or government organizations would be performed following the implementation of 
reclamation and closure measures.  

Upon closure, permanent water conveyance structures will be retrofitted as required for 
minimum maintenance. This may include the installation of new riprap channels and passive 
sediment control structures.  

 Regrading Plan 20.3.9

Elements of the generalized regrading and re-vegetation plan include: 

 All visibly contaminated soils will be excavated and treated in an on-site soil land farm;  

 All compacted soils will be tilled with a disc to relieve soil compaction and improve drainage; 

 Impacted areas will receive a soil cover, where cover existed prior to development; 

 Impacted areas will be revegetated with native species, where capable of supporting 
vegetation; and 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 232 

 Erosion-control BMPs will be applied to minimize erosion until revegetation is established. 

If required, impacted soil will be disposed of in a hazardous waste facility, but experience with 
other mining operations suggests that the potential quantity of soil that cannot be land-farmed 
will be small.  

 Monitoring and Maintenance  20.3.10

Monitoring and maintenance during operations will ensure that the control measures used to 
prevent environmental impacts are effective. This will include climate monitoring, water quality 
sampling, groundwater and surface water monitoring, air monitoring, and geotechnical 
monitoring of the Main Dump, pits, and pit backfill. The monitoring program for operations is 
described in more detail in the ESIA. 

Monitoring and maintenance of the mine reclamation and closure activities will begin while 
these activities are underway, and will continue in the post-closure period. Monitoring and 
maintenance will be done primarily by a team of onsite personnel. Equipment will be made 
available for the monitoring of reclaimed areas of the project and for the performance of regular 
maintenance. The monitoring will include water quality sampling and analysis, in addition to 
regular inspection of the Main Dump, process area, and the pit areas. The required duration of 
the monitoring and maintenance is undefined at this time, but a minimum period of 25 years has 
been considered in the cost estimate. 

Many monitoring activities carried out during operations will be continued in closure, including: 

 Automated weather station monitoring 

 Manual water level measurement in monitoring wells 

 Manual water quality sampling in monitoring wells 

 Manual water quality sampling of the water treatment plant effluent 

 Automated stream flow monitoring via permanent flumes 

 Manual surface water quality sampling 

 Automated geotechnical monitoring at the Main Dump and the Este Pit Backfill 

 Site-wide inspections for revegetation success, erosion control, surface water management, 
and general maintenance. 

Maintenance will also focus on the surface water channels around the pit, over the pit backfill, 
and the Main Dump. Sediment removal and repair of any damage to channel lining will be 
specific areas of focus for the maintenance program. 

 Closure Schedule 20.3.11

The schedule for performing reclamation and closure activities can be summarized as follows:  

 Este pit backfill - Concurrent reclamation during operations. 

 Minas/Main pit backfill - Completion of backfill reclamation three years after closure. 

 Main Dump - Concurrent reclamation of completed surfaces as they become available, 
beginning in Year 2; completion of activities in tandem with the Minas/Main pit backfill. 

 Surface water management system – As soon as possible after closure. 

 Water treatment plant conversion - As soon as possible after closure

 Socioeconomics and Community 20.4

The Project site is located within the jurisdiction of two rural communities (comunidades 
campesinas), Chacacuniza and Quelcaya. These communities, situated at over 4,000 masl, are 
small isolated rural settlements, with a population of around 120 individuals each. The majority 
of the population speaks Quechua as their first language. 

The geographical isolation and lack of infrastructure in the zone result in reduced economic and 
social development opportunities, and high levels of poverty. However, both communities have 
access to water, electricity, and rudimentary wastewater services. The main housing 
construction material is adobe, with thatched roofs and earth floors. The most common illness is 
respiratory infections which children and the elderly are susceptible to during periods of snow 
and cold weather.  

BCM has undertaken community relations activities as part of previous permitting activities 
related to exploration campaigns. Further activities were undertaken as part of the ESIA that 
was approved by the Peruvian Government in 2013. The ESIA process included a thorough 
description of the current social and economic status of the communities, and the analysis of 
possible and anticipated, positive and negative impacts on these communities. Following 
analysis of the impacts, methods were developed to avoid, remedy or mitigate the identified 
negative community impacts, including the development of social programs aimed at providing 
enhanced economic and social development opportunities. These are presented in the ESIA. 

Further community engagement occurred concurrent with the impact assessment process. This 
included two initial workshops with each of the two communities (Chacacuniza and Quelcaya) 
affected by the project. The first workshops were undertaken before the ESIA studies began, 
and the ESIA process was explained to the community. Additional workshops were undertaken 
during the elaboration of the ESIA. Finally, a public meeting was held. At this meeting, the ESIA 
and Community Participation Plan were presented to the approving authorities. Since the mine 
plan described in this document results in a reduced Project footprint and a reduction in water 
consumption, it is anticipated that impacts to the community will be reduced relative to those 
described in the current ESIA. For this reason, the ESIA modification is expected to be 
considered a technical modification which does not require additional public hearings. 

Additionally, Bear Creek completed a Life of Mine ("LOM") Investment Agreement in June 2013. 
This agreement was entered into with the District of Carabaya, five surrounding communities, 
and relevant, ancillary organizations specifying investment commitments over the 23 year 
project life, including the preproduction period. Under the agreement, annual payments are to 
be made into a trust designed to fund community projects totaling 4 million nuevos soles per 
year (approximately $1.6 million per year), beginning with the first installments payable in 2013. 
Payments will remain constant throughout the pre-development phase and during production. 
Cessation or interruptions of operations will cause a pro-rata decrease in the annual 
disbursements. As an integral part of the LOM agreement, a trust or foundation structure is 
established for approval of investments and disbursement of funds. Each of the five 
communities (Corani (Aconsaya), Chacacuniza, Quelcaya, Isivilla, and Aymana) has agreed to 
the formation of committees which will consider and approve investment projects for the benefit 
of the communities, such as schools, medical facilities, roads, or other infrastructure. The 
amounts of the total annual investment to be directed towards each community is agreed to and 
defined in the agreement. Bear Creek is an oversight member of the trust and will assist 
towards the success of the projects; however, the Company will have no voting powers. In this 
structure, Bear Creek's intent is to appoint independent members with community social 
responsibility experience and credibility in order to provide oversight of the foundation's 
functions in meeting its commitments to the communities and all of its members.

21 Capital and Operating Costs 

Capital and operating costs for the Corani Project were based on the Phase 1 FEED mine plan 
and process plant design.  The capital costs were based on estimates for the equipment, 
materials, labor, and services required to implement the design. Operating costs were based on 
estimates of labor, materials, power, supplies, fuel, and estimates from consultants and 
potential suppliers to operate the mine and plant as designed. 

The capital and operating cost estimates have been prepared by Graña y Montero (GMI), and 
reviewed by GBM Minerals Engineering Consultants Limited (GBM). GBM's Managing Director 
Michael Short is acting as Chapter 0 Qualified Person. 

 Capital Cost Summary 21.1

The capital cost estimate (CAPEX) presented in this Report is for a silver-lead-zinc mine and 
concentrator capable of producing and processing an average of 22,500 tpd of ore (dry basis). 
The total life of mine capital investment for the Corani Project is estimated to be $585.559 
million as shown in Table 21-1. 

Table 21-1: Life of Mine Capital Cost Summary 

Cost Type Cost (USD Million) 

Sunk Costs 4.279 

Initial CAPEX 580.919 

Sustaining CAPEX 0.361 

TOTAL  585.559 

 

The initial CAPEX includes the design, permitting, pre-stripping, construction, and 
commissioning of the mine, plant facilities, ancillary facilities, utilities and camp. The CAPEX 
also includes costs for engineering, construction management, and Owner's costs.  

In Table 21-2 a summary of the total initial capital to be spent is presented by major area. 

The primary assumptions used to develop the CAPEX are provided below: 

 All cost estimates were developed and are reported in United States of America Dollars 
(USD or US Dollars). 

 Qualified and experienced construction contractors will be available at the time of Project 
execution. 

 Borrow sources are available within the Project boundary. 

 There is no allowance for weather related delays in construction in the estimate. 

  

An estimate of contingency has been made based on the accuracy and level of detail of the cost 
estimate. The purpose of the contingency provision is to make allowance for uncertain cost 
elements which are predicted to occur, but which are not included in the cost estimate.  These 
cost elements include uncertainties concerning completeness and accuracy of material take-
offs, accuracy of labor and material rates, accuracy of labor productivity expectations, and 
accuracy of equipment pricing.

have been allocated in the estimate for further escalation or to offset potential currency 
fluctuations.  

 Estimate Exclusions 21.1.2

Items not included in the capital estimate are as follows: 

 Reclamation costs (included in the financial analysis). 

 Escalation beyond that discussed in Section 21.1.1. 

 Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

 Interest and financing cost. 

 General sales and withholding taxes (included in the financial analysis). 

 Working capital is excluded from the estimate. There is an allowance for cash inventory in 
the financial analysis, and an allowance for spare parts and first fills has been included in the 
capital estimate start-up costs. 

Risks due to political upheaval, government policy changes, labor disputes, permitting delays, 
weather delays or any other force majeure occurrences are also excluded.  

Accuracy 

The estimate has been developed to a level sufficient to assess/evaluate the Project concept, 
various development options and the overall Project viability. After inclusion of the 
recommended contingency, the capital cost estimate is considered to have a level of accuracy 
of ±15%.

22 Economic Analysis 

GRE has reviewed and verified the economic model generated by BMC with capital and 
operating cost inputs from GMI and GyM, and Anddes and that the model was prepared with 
sound engineering and financial principles and is correct. GRE has found the work performed 
by GMI/GyM for the Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) to be well done and thorough. The 
financial indicators stated herein are slightly improved over the M3/GRE 2015 Feasibility Study 
Estimate.  

The following text describes the work done by BCM, GMI/GyM, and Anddes. 

 Introduction 22.1

The financial evaluation presents the determination of the net present value (NPV), payback 
period (time in years to recapture the initial capital investment), and the internal rate of return 
(IRR) for the project. Annual cash flow projections were estimated over the life of the mine 
based on the estimates of capital expenditures, production cost, and sales revenue. Revenues 
are based on the production of a zinc concentrate with silver and a lead-silver concentrate. The 
estimates of capital expenditures and site production costs have been developed specifically for 
this project and have been presented in earlier sections of this report. 

 Mine Production Statistics 22.2

Mine production is reported as ore and waste from the mining operation. The annual production 
figures were obtained from the mine plan as reported earlier in this report. A total of 139.0 
million tonnes of ore are mined at an average grade of 50.3 g/t silver, 0.896% lead, and 0.590% 
zinc. A total of 207.1 million tonnes of waste are mined for a stripping ratio of 1.49:1. 

 Plant Production Statistics 22.3

The design basis for the process plant is 22,500 tonnes per day at 92% mill availability. The 
metal recoveries, which are variable by ore characteristics, are projected to average 67.1% for 
zinc, 61.1% for lead and 69.9% for silver. 

The estimated life of mine metal production is presented in Table 22-1.

  Life of Mine 

Zinc (million lbs) 1,213.3 

Lead (million lbs) 1,677.0 

Silver (million ozs) 157.2 

 Smelter and Refinery Return Factors 22.4

The lead and zinc concentrates will be transported to a holding facility at the port of Matarani 
and consolidated for shipment to a smelter for final processing. Smelter treatment and refining 
charges will be negotiated at the time of the finalization of the sales agreements. The smelter 
charges used in the financial model are presented in Table 22-2 and Table 22-3.

 Capital Expenditure 22.5

 Initial Capital  22.5.1

The base case financial indicators have been determined using the assumption of 100% equity 
financing of the initial capital. The total initial capital estimate for the project, which includes pre-
production mine development, construction, owners' costs and contingency is $585.6 million. A 
breakout of the capital cost is shown in Section 21.  Approximately 68% of these expenditures 
will be incurred over a two-year period.  

 Sustaining Capital 22.5.2

Sustaining capital for equipment was included in the Contractor's costs and was estimated to be 
$0.36 million. 

 Working Capital 22.5.3

A 15-day delay of revenue recognition until receipt of cash has been used for accounts 
receivables. A delay of payment for accounts payable of 30 days is also incorporated into the 
financial model. 

The financial model assumes that the project will qualify for early recovery of Peruvian value 
added taxes (IGV) during the development and construction phase of the project. Therefore, the 
financial model reflects a 90-day delay between initial payment and subsequent recovery of 
18% IGV taxes. All the working capital is recaptured at the end of the mine life, and the final 
value of these accounts is $0. 

 Revenue 22.5.4

Annual revenue is determined by applying estimated metal prices to the annual payable metal 
estimated for each operating year. Sales prices have been applied to all life of mine production 
without escalation or hedging. Revenue is the gross value of payable metals sold before 
treatment charges and transportation charges. The metal price assumptions used in the 
economic model are as follows:  

 Zinc   $1.10/lb 

 Lead  $0.95/lb 

 Silver  $18.00/oz 

Total revenue for the life of the mine is summarized in Table 22-4.

Zinc Concentrate $1,261.3 million $8.2 million -$1.5 million $1,254.6 million 

Lead Concentrate $3,971.4 million $18.5 million $0 million $3,952.9 million 

Total $5,232.7 million $26.7 million -$1.5 million $5,207.5 million 

 Total Operating Cost 22.5.5

The average Total Operating Cost over the life of the mine is estimated to be $21.50 per tonne 
of ore processed, excluding the cost of the capitalized pre-stripping. Total Operating Cost 
includes mine operations, process plant operations, general and administrative cost, smelting

 Reclamation & Closure 22.6.2

An allowance of $36.3 million for the cost of reclamation and closure of the property has been 
included in the cash flow projection.  

 Depreciation 22.7

Depreciation was calculated using the following assumptions for both initial and sustaining 
capital.  

 Mine capital 5-year straight line method 

 Process Plant and Infrastructure 10-year straight line method 

 Last year of production is the catch-up year if assets are not fully depreciated

 Taxation 22.8

 Contribution to OSINERGMIN 22.8.1

The contribution to OSINERGMIN is applied to Net Income after Interest at a rate of 0.13%. It is 
estimated that $6.8 million of contribution to OSINERGMIN will be paid during the life of the 
mine. 

 Contribution to OEFA 22.8.2

The contribution to OEFA is applied to Net Income after Interest at a rate of 0.13%. It is 
estimated that $5.8 million of contribution to OEFA will be paid during the life of the mine. 

 Royalty Tax 22.8.3

The royalty tax is applied to operating profit at progressive rates from 1% to 12% based on 
operating margin (operating profit divided by sales), subject to a minimum tax of 1% of sales, 
which is applicable regardless of the Company's operating margin. It is estimated that $52.3 
million of royalty tax will be paid during the life of the mine. 

 Special Tax (IEM) 22.8.4

A special tax (IEM) is applied to operating profit at progressive rates from 2% to 8.4% based on 
operating margin (operating profit divided by sales). It is estimated that $13.3 million of special 
tax will be paid during the life of the mine. 

 Worker's Participation Tax 22.8.5

A labor profit sharing tax is generally based on pre-tax profits, after deduction for the royalty tax 
and special tax (IEM), and is assessed at an 8% rate. It is estimated that $37.3 million of labor 
profit sharing tax will be paid during the life of the mine. 

 Income Tax 22.8.6

Income taxes are assessed on pre-tax profits at a rate of 29.5%, after deduction for the special 
tax (IEM), royalty tax, and worker's participation tax. It is estimated that $126.6 million of income 
taxes will be paid during the life of the mine.

24 Other Relevant Data and Information 

 Project Execution 24.1

GRE has reviewed the Project Execution Plan (PEP) and project risk assessment called a 
Hazard and Operability study (HAZOP) created for the Corani project by GMI and has 
summarized the comprehensive documents here. The PEP and HAZOP have been prepared in 
a professional and industry-standard manner. These plans will form the basis for developing the 
project on time and on budget, in a safe and efficient manner.  

Bear Creek Mining Corporation is committed to carrying out its exploration and development 
activities of minerals in a professional manner, in accordance with internationally agreed 
guidelines and principles and to be recognized for Sustainable Development and Corporate 
Social Responsibility. The participation of community and environmental stewardship are 
cornerstones of this commitment, to promote a safe and healthy work environment. The 
Company also has the responsibility to promote its projects for the benefit of shareholders, to 
generate and sustain future growth, and to contribute to economic prosperity and social 
progress of the host nation of Peru. 

 Objectives  24.1.1

The objective of the project is to effectively consolidate the procurement and subcontracting 
strategy and to carry out the project construction, installation, and assembly in a safe way, 
leading to the commissioning of the Corani Mining project. The goal is to achieve specified 
quality and performance standards while maintaining schedule and budgeted costs. A brief 
summary of the main objectives follow: 

 Safety objectives: One of the main objectives is to ensure the safety and security of all 
persons involved with the project and the environment. 

 Community relations objectives: To achieve a harmonious social, economic, and cultural 
environment with neighboring communities.  

 Engineering and Technology Objectives: Ensure that EPCs and their subcontractors use 
only proven technology and designs. Ensure contractor designs and equipment are 
consistent with all project standards. 

 Quality Work Objectives: Ensure that adequate quality assurance and quality control 
procedures are effectively used and monitored. 

 Cost and schedule objectives: Completing the project on time and below budget.  

 Change Management Objectives: Create a BCM designated Project Group to direct and 
manage CM and EPC companies, and install and manage a system to document and 
manage variations in volumes and quantities, supported by versions of Material Take Off 
(MTOs), changes in prices, new unit prices, new scope for the project in accordance with the 
Capital Expenditure Policy of BCM.  

 Procurement and purchase objectives: Ensure that the contracting and purchasing strategy 
is established and implemented to the maximum practical extent, restricting contracts and 
packages to a manageable number without increasing the total costs of the project,  

 Risk Management Objectives: Assess all risks in all aspects of the project and develop 
appropriate mitigation strategies for those risks.  

 Capitalization Objectives: The Owner Team (OT) of BCM, the CM, and the EPCs, should 
develop a cost control strategy and a cost control system that will allow the project to be 
delivered below budget, where each item to be capitalized shall contain distributed indirect 
costs of the contractor. The system should manage all project costs, invoices, contracts, 
purchase orders, "as built" plans, photographic report, and lists of all expenses incurred, so 
the BCM finance group can manage the BCM asset books and initiate the depreciation of the 
delivered facilities.:

The HAZOP study is designed to identify operational risks as well as potential operational 
reliability issues, and then develop mitigation plans to guarantee these will not affect or 
influence the Safety and Environment of Bear Creek Corani Operations. The goal is to have a 
risk-controlled facility able to meet international safety, security, and environmental standards. 

The study has three basic steps: (1) identification of potential operational risk and reliability 
issues or aspects, (2) determining the consequence of that issue or aspect, including identifing 
all entities effected, and (3) determining the probability of that issue or aspect occurring and 
ranking the magnitude of such an occurrence. The HAZOP study includes a method of 
combining the ranking the consequence and issues or aspects in order probability, to rank the 
most significant redesign issues or to form mitigation plans for them. The HAZOP study 
considered only the main or critical circuit; another HAZOP study should be performed at 
engineering Phase 2 level of development. 

The study identified 313 risk points, with 20 of the points being high risk, 105 moderate risk, and 
188 low risk. The Study has 53 recommendations, as shown below. 

1. Generate a common procedure of operations for the Mine and Plant to control haul truck 
and vehicle traffic and their destinations. 

2. Review the free surface for the stockpile according to the mining plan, in addition to the ore 
management philosophy; the design includes an area to stockpile ore. 

3. Maintenance of ditches and rainwater collection system to ensure proper function 
throughout the mine life.  

4. The maintenance manual should indicate the need for maintenance and cleaning of the 
area. The parameter of analysis was the frequency of arrival of trucks from the mine, in 
which the risk is that the trucks at the point of unloading result in an accident, loss of truck, 
loss of production, etc. In general cases, berms should be used at the platform perimeters 
and in the unloading point. Safe procedures will always be utilized, and training should be 
included in the operations manual. 

5. The plan will confirm the need for a roof over the hopper during normal precipitation, and, in 
case of torrential rains, the crushing operation must be stopped, having as backup load live 
in the stockpile. 

6. Review the seepage design; the design contemplates waterproofing of the platform. 

7. Review the dust mitigation design to avoid the lack of visibility in the area; the design should 
contemplate installation of nebulizers to mitigate dust in the environment. Based on a 
specialist evaluation, the project has contemplated the installation of a nebulizer in the area. 

8. The available spaces must be secured for adequate maintainability; the mechanical 
arrangement of crushing has been designed considering the spaces for the mentioned 
activities, as well as facilities for lifting.  

9. To avoid accumulation of ore, the discharge chute has been dimensioned at 100%.  

10. For power outages, the belts and pan feeders must be designed to start with load. The plan 
will review the need for an estimated time needed for an alternate source of in case of a 
blackout. 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 261 

11. Review spare parts and corrective maintenance activities for belt conveyors, as well as for 
pan feeders; the operations manual shall contain the spare parts recommendations for 
corrective and preventive maintenance.  

12. Perform preventive maintenance of water pump under pressure (water jet). 

13. Perform plant start-up according to operations 

14. For the SAG mill, review recommendations by suppliers on spaces and services required; 
the design contemplated the requirement and the recommendations of the suppliers. 

15. Generate protocols and maintenance manuals for plant equipment, in this specific case of 
the trommel and SAG mill. The operations manual should contain recommendations for the 
maintenance of the plant equipment. Based on this information, the operator will prepare its 
maintenance plan and procedures, instructions, inspection records to be used in 
maintenance activities.  

16. The plan will review the location and protection of the lubrication system. It will ensure that 
that the indications and recommendations of the seller of the SAG mill with respect to the 
location and protection of the lubrication are properly considered. 

17. Review with supplier the need for lubrication system protection. 

18. Illumination is being considered with level of required luxes indicated along with the project 
design criteria; the design should contemplate localized lighting. 

19. The risk for damage to the bearings due to lack of lubrication in the case of an electrical 
failure. An available control to consider is an oil lubrication design which does not lose 
pressure. The recommendation is to review the maintenance and cleaning plan and check 
the backup system for powering the equipment auxiliary / mill services. 

20. Ensure the design prevents spills and allows access for cleaning from accidental events. 

21. For the pump boxes for the mills and in general for all pump boxes, the design should 
consider level controls to prevent spills. 

22. In general for pump boxes, evaluate the use of radar sensors. 

23. Drainage lines and cleaning lines have been considered for pump suction and discharge 
pipes, as well as gutters for the concrete slabs. 

24. In general for the whole plant, consider maintenance access; the design has contemplated 
the spaces and access for maintenance. 

25. For the feeding of cyclone, the operation conditions and instrumentation for the 
measurement of solids should be considered. 

26. Include a review of the operation of the agitator in the commissioning and maintenance 
procedures. 

27. Evaluate in the next stage of engineering the use of backup air or consider the use of a 
motorized valve (with padlock) 

28. Engineering should consider the distribution boxes of the flotation cells, as well as for the 
entire floatation area, nearby water points for cleaning. 

29. The engineering shall review the structural design of the pulp distribution box to the flotation 
cells to confirm that they have considered the effect of vibrations and other forces.  

30. The detailed engineering design should consider installing protective grating on top of the 
pump boxes.  

31. The design should consider control options for the presence of foam inside the feed box.  

32. For thickener rakes, as well as for the agitators of feed tanks to the filters, check the power 
supply back up system.  

33. Engineering contemplates emergency sumps for the thickeners.  

34. For areas of thickeners in the event of a spill, engineering includes containment such as 
gutters.  



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 262 

35. For the thickener filling pipes, the engineering considers the installation of a water line for 
cleaning.  

36. For pumps in the event of an electrical failure, engineering contemplates the 
implementation of a failure position for the valves.  

37. Prepare a maintenance plan for electrical failures. 

38. When there is low level of suction pumps, consider level control, elaborate Standard 
Operating Procedure. 

39. There is a back-up pump, but when there is a cooling failure you must review according to 
the maintenance plan.  

40. When there is a low level or high level in the pump boxes, to avoid sedimentation or 
spillage, check the level control.  

41. In all process areas, engineering has considered sump pumps for any spill or in the case 
any lines or equipment must be drained.  

42. For rupture of filter plates, consider a sorting system in the pulp tank that feeds the filters. 

43. Before a power outage, implement a procedure to restart the plant. 

44. For faults in filter discharge belts, check stock of spare parts and corrective maintenance 
activities.  

45. When a pump water seal fails, the design includes a backup pump. The envisioned water 
seal is intended to start and stop the pump so that the pump cannot run dry.  

46. To prevent the seal water pump from operating due to inadequate selection, engineering 
should check pump selection. 

47. Check attachment for the level sensor in the fresh water pumping system.  

48. The need for the installation of by-pass lines on the control valves must be reviewed.  

49. For the lime slurry system, the shut off temperature in the mill should be monitored. This will 
be reviewed with the seller of the lime plant, to consider installing a heat sensor to measure 
the temperature of the pulp in the discharge of the mill and install a thermocouple in the 
preparation tank.  

50. The quality of the lime must be checked, the responsibility lies with the user and / or the 
supplier.  

51. Minera Corani should be consulted for the technical specification of the flocculant.  

52. Grating should be used in the flocculant preparation zone; engineering has considered the 
use of grating.  

53. The accumulation of compressed air should be checked.

25 Interpretation and Conclusions 

This section presents the main conclusions about the FEED stage developed by GMI. 
Highlights are presented as follow: 

 Property and Location 25.1

The land status of the Corani Project is a series of twelve (12) mineral claims or concessions. 
Mineral concessions in Peru are filed with the Instituto Nacional De Concessiones Y Catastro 
Minera (INACC) which is part of the Ministerio de Energía y Minas in Peru (MINEM). Claims can 
vary in size from 100 to 1,000 ha. They are rectangular geometries parallel to the UTM grid 
system employed in the district. The Corani Project is located in the districts of Corani, 
Macusani and Nuñoa, provinces of Carabaya and Melgar, department of Puno, in Peru, and 
covers an aggregate extent of 5,180.1213 hectares. The concessions are fully controlled by 
BCM and are free of any mortgage, lien, charge, royalty, or encumbrance. BCM controls the 
surface rights that cover the entire project area including the open pit, waste dump, process 
plant, water ponds, camp, and ancillary facilities required for operation.  Surface rights total 
2,424 hectares. 

The twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Project are subject to compliance with 
payment of annual license fees in the amount of US$3.00 per hectare ("License Fees"). In 
addition, they are subject to an annual maintenance requirement with either of the following 
alternative obligations: minimum required levels of annual production of at least US$100 per 
hectare in gross sales ("Minimum Production"); or payment of an additional amount referred as 
Penalty of US$6.00 per hectare for the 7th through 11th year following the granting of the 
concession, and of US$20.00 per hectare thereafter; or exploration expenditures of 10 times the 
Penalty. Compliance with one of these three maintenance obligations, together with timely 
payment of License Fees, is required to them in good standing. Failure to comply with License 
Fee payments or Penalty payments for two consecutive years causes the forfeiture of the 
mineral concessions. 

In the year 2018, the twelve (12) mineral concessions comprising the Project shall be subject to 
the obligations of Minimum Production, Penalties and exploration expenditures in accordance 
with the maintenance regime in force as of October 2008 whereby: 

 The minimum production will be equivalent to one Tax Unit per year (approximately U.S. 
$1,333.00) per hectare granted for metallic minerals, and 10% of one Tax Unit per year per 
hectare granted for non-metallic minerals ("Minimum Production"); 

 Failure to attain Minimum Production will trigger the obligation to pay a penalty equivalent to 
10% of the Minimum Production per year per hectare, until the year in which the Minimum 
Production is attained; 

 Year 2028 shall be the maximum deadline for the mineral concessions comprising the 
Corani Project to attain Minimum Production. Failure to do so will result in the forfeiture of 
these mineral concessions. 

Control and current status were verified in August 2017 through an electronic database search 
of the Geologic Mining and Metallurgical Institute (INGEMMET). All concessions are in good 
standing. 

 Accessibility, Climate 25.2

The Project site is located in the eastern Andes mountain range, between 4,600 and 5,200 m 
above sea level (masl). The area is characterized by mountainous terrain dominated by volcanic 
rock above which sits glacial gravel. The lithologic and climatic conditions have given rise to a 
series of cirques or bowl-shaped, steep-walled basins. Apart from the vegetation associated 
with the wetlands mentioned above, areas of "puna" or alpine tussock grassland occupies the 
valleys and moderate to steep slopes. The areas above 4,700 masl mostly consist of steep 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 264 

mountainous slopes where erosion and climatic conditions largely prevent the development of 
soils or vegetation. These areas are scarcely vegetated with species specially evolved to 
withstand the harsh conditions. The naturally occurring acidic soils related to oxidation of sulfide 
bearing materials and the resulting ARD from exposed mineralized zones within the project area 
have also prevented the development of vegetation where these conditions occur. 

Existing access to the Project site is primarily by road from the town of Macusani (located on the 
paved dual lane Interoceanic Highway), which is more readily accessible from the town of 
Juliaca, also serviced by commercial airlines from Lima. This route typically takes 4.5 to 5 
hours. There are other access routes to the site from Cusco, taking approximately 6 hours by 
vehicle on increasingly primitive roads approaching the site. The City of Cusco is also serviced 
by commercial airlines from Lima. 

The nearest town of significant size and with significant infrastructure is Macusani, which is the 
capital of the Province of Carabaya in the Region of Puno. Macusani is approximately 30 km 
east of the Project in a direct line. The access road from Huiquisa Bridge to the Permanent 
Camp will be improved. The length of the proposed Mine Access Road connecting the process 
Plant to Macusani is anticipated to be approximately 44 km. The Project site is located in the 
district of Corani, also in the Province of Carabaya. The closely orientated campesino 
communities of Chacaconiza and Quelcaya, which have a joint population of approximately 200 
families (80 and 120 families, respectively), will be directly impacted by the mine development, 
in terms of landholding, rights to water, employment, etc. The community consultation 
undertaken with the Chacaconiza and Quelcaya communities to date has included a proposal 
for mining employment, generating widespread acceptance, mainly among younger community 
members, the teachers at local educational facilities, and community leaders. The current labor 
force is generally unskilled, mainly working on highway remediation and maintenance. A 
technical training program is planned to develop the skills of community members to fulfill 
employment requirements of the Project. The Project's requirement for labor will exceed the 
labor resources available in the Chacaconiza and Quelcaya communities. A ranking system will 
be developed with regard to geographical location of employment applicants, together with 
categorization and quantification of the labor force required. 

 History 25.3

Prior to the early 1950s, mineral exploration in the Corani district consisted of shallow prospect 
Pits and adits in the northern portion of the current project area. These prospects are of 
unknown age and may date back to colonial Spanish time. Antimony prospects south and east 
of the property reportedly were active in the early 1900s, when there was limited antimony 
production (C.R. Petersen, 1967). 

The first modern evaluation of silver-lead mineralization began with the location of mineral 
concessions in 1951 and in 1956 Compañía Minera Korani was formed to develop the silver-
lead mineralization previously prospected. The mines were developed and operated from 1956 
to at least until 1967.  Total historical production is uncertain, but is estimated at 100,000 t of 
silver-lead-zinc ore. In early 1967, estimated mine production was reported at about 3,400 short 
tons per month, with grades of 7.0-9.0% lead, 2.3% zinc, and 8.0 to 11.0 oz/ton silver (C.R. 
Petersen, 1967). 

The next exploration activity was by a private Peruvian company, Minsur. That exploration was 
reported to include 40 shallow drill holes in various locations, including a number of close 
proximity holes in the gold zone (located south of the current resource area). Although Minsur is 
an active mining company in Peru; attempts by BCM to secure copies of Minsur's exploration 
data have been unsuccessful. None of Minsur's exploration information is available or verifiable; 
although reportedly gold mineralization was encountered in some of Minsur's drilling. 

In late 2003 and early 2004, Rio Tinto Mining and Exploration began a surface exploration 
program for porphyry copper mineralization. That initial work by Rio Tinto defined anomalous 
silver and lead mineralization to the south of the Korani mines, and also defined a zone of 
anomalous gold mineralization in rock and soils.  The concession ownership by Compañía 
Minera Korani apparently lapsed during the 1970s. The ownership of Minsur also lapsed prior to 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 265 

Rio Tinto's exploration activities after 2000. Rio Tinto re-established some of the older 
concessions in their name beginning in 2003. BCM has added two concessions early in 2005 to 
create the current land position described in Section 4. 

Six previous resource estimates and two previous mineral reserve estimated have been 
completed for the project and are published in previous technical reports beginning in 2006.  
Since 2006, the Measured and Indicated resource has grown from approximately 40 Moz of 
silver to over 300 Moz of silver.  

 Geological Setting and Mineralization  25.4

The Corani Project area is located in the northern part of Puno Department, southern Peru, 
within the Cordillera Oriental of the Central Andes. The Project area is underlain by Tertiary 
volcanic rocks of the Quenemari Formation, specifically a thick series of crystal-lithic tuffs and 
andesite flows, which overlie variably deformed Lower Paleozoic to Mesozoic metasediments of 
the Ambo and Tarma Groups. The primary host of mineralization is the Chacacuzina Member of 
the Quenemari Formation. The Chacacuzina is the youngest member of the Quenemari, and is 
comprised of a sequence of crystal-lithic and crystal-vitric-lithic tuffs. The tuffs are widely 
hydrothermally altered and pervasively argillized to low-temperature clays, and are variably 
faulted, fractured, and brecciated. 

Mineralization at the Corani Project occurs in three distinct and separate zones: Corani Main, 
Corani Minas, and Corani Este, each differing slightly in character with regard to both alteration 
and mineral assemblages. In general, mineralization in outcrops throughout the Corani Project 
is associated with iron and manganese oxides, barite, and silica. Silicification is both pervasive 
and structurally controlled along veins. In drill core, the mineralization occurs in typical low to 
intermediate sulfidation Ag-Pb-Zn mineral assemblages. The most abundant silver-bearing 
mineral is fine-grained argentian tetrahedrite or freibergite.  

Structurally, the Corani deposit is situated within a stacked sequence of listric normal faults 
striking dominantly north to north-northwest with moderate to shallow (50° to <10°) westerly 
dips. The hanging walls of the listric faults are extensively fractured and brecciated, providing 
the structural preparation for subsequent or syngenetic mineralization. The stacked listric faults 
are more prominent in the Corani Minas and Corani Main areas. The Corani Este area contains 
a single known listric fault with an extensively fractured and brecciated hanging wall. The 
contact with the underlying Paleozoic sediments corresponds locally to listric faults dipping 
shallowly to the west.  

 Deposit Types 25.5

The Corani deposit is best described as a low- to intermediate-sulfidation epithermal deposit 
with silver, lead, and zinc mineralization hosted in stock works, veins, and breccias. 
Mineralization is principally located in a set of lístric faults dipping west, with dilational segments 
related to subvertical structures and breccias in the hanging wall, and veinlets forming 
stockworks in the footwall. Structural control of the mineralization is a product of extensional 
tectonics that developed the series of north- to northwest-trending fractures and faults, and 
whose movements provided the structural preparation for the influx of mineralizing hydrothermal 
fluids.  

Mineralization at Corani is likely both laterally and vertically distal to an intrusive fluid source. 
Mineral textures grade from coarse crystalline quartz-pyrite-chalcopyrite in the southern portion 
of the Project area, to finer grained, pyrite-dominated sulfide minerals in the north, suggesting a 
south-to-north hydrothermal fluid flow. This spatial zonation suggests a rapidly cooled ore fluid 
typical of a distal setting surrounding a buried intrusion. The multiphase nature of the 
mineralization and zonation at Corani may be related to multiple fluid exsolution events from an 
evolving porphyry type system that possibly underlies the southern part of the area. 
Alternatively, the mineralizing solutions may be related to shallow, subvolcanic dome 
emplacement.

 Exploration 25.6

BCM began exploring the Corani Project in early 2005. In addition to drilling, exploration 
activities carried out by BCM include detailed geologic mapping, trenching, and geophysical 
surveying.  

BCM has conducted general geologic surface mapping over the entire Project area. The total 
mapped surface is about 4.5 km wide (east-west) and 7.5 km long (north-south).  In 2015, 
detailed surface mapping, including lithology, alteration, and structures, was performed at a 
scale of 1:2500 in the area of the proposed pits. 

BCM has completed 25 trenches within the Project resource area (Corani Main, Minas, and 
Este) to verify the continuity of the structures covered by Quaternary sediments. Spacing 
between the trenches is roughly 50 to 100 meters. Channel samples from these trenches have 
produced an associated 1,295 assay intervals for a total of 2,924 meters of trench data. 

VDG del Perú S.A.C. (VDG) conducted a ground geophysical campaign at the Corani Project 
 on behalf of BCM in the fall of 2005. A total of 44.20 line-km of induced polarization (IP) data 
was collected, along with 50.95 line-km of magnetic survey. The geophysical surveys were 
aimed at assisting in geological mapping, including lithologies and key structures and at 
mapping mineralization and alteration associated with a low sulfidation gold-silver system. The 
objective of the IP/Res survey was to map the electrical response by means of high-resolution 
IP traverses across the favorable north-south corridor identified based on the results of both 
trench and drilling exploration. The field results of both methods were of good quality and were 
meaningful. The final chargeability and resistivity depth sections mapped systematically clear 
contrasts from line to line between the sub-surface and a nominal depth of 283 meters below 
surface. The chargeability outlined five (5) IP anomalies, two of which correspond to the Corani 
Main and Corani Este areas, respectively. Those anomalies accurately mapped the known 
mineralization and extended the size of both mineralized zones.  

 Drilling 25.7

Since 2005, BCM has completed a total of 556 drillholes at the Corani Project for a total of 
approximately 100,494.57 m. Drilling was completely by the Peruvian contractor, Bradly MDH 
primarily using LD250, JKS35, and LJ44 drill rigs. All of the drilling to date has been completed 
using diamond core drilling methods to produce either HQ (6.35 cm dia.) or NQ (4.76 cm dia.) 
core. Core recoveries are generally excellent, with no discernible variation in rate of recovery 
between the two core sizes (HQ and NQ). While on site, the QP carefully reviewed the drilling 
and sampling procedures employed by BCM with BCM staff. Based on that review, the QP finds 
no drilling, sampling, or recovery factors that might materially impact the accuracy or reliability 
of the drilling results. 

Since 2006, BCM has undertaken to in-fill the known areas of mineralization in order to increase 
confidence in the resource estimate. This has been accomplished by in-fill drilling to produce a 
nominal 50-m drillhole spacing in previously more widely spaced drilling areas, with a focus on 
areas of higher grade mineralization. In general, drilling exploration has identified and further 
defined the distribution of mineralization within the three primary resource areas, Corani Main, 
Corani Este, and Corani Minas. Drilling results indicate that significant mineralization occurs in 
two basic forms; in large veins associated with the principal listric fault structures, and in 
stockwork veins found in the surrounding rocks. 

 Sample Preparation, Analyses and Security 25.8

BCM employs standard, basic procedures for both drill core and trench sample collection and 
analysis. Formal chain of custody procedures are maintained during all segments of sample 
transport. Samples prepared for transport to the laboratory are bagged and labelled in a manner 
which prevents tampering, and remain in BCM control until released to private transport carrier 
in Cusco or Juliaca. Upon receipt by the laboratory, samples are tracked by a blind sample 
number assigned and recorded by BCM. The samples are prepped according to ALS-Chemex

preparation code PREP-31, and silver, lead, zinc, and copper assays are carried out by three-
acid digestion followed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA) analysis. Multi-element 
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis is conducted on select sample intervals to assist with 
mineralization classifications and to guide the interpretation of the metallurgical process 
response. 

BCM maintains an internal Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program which includes 
both standard and check (lab) sampling. GRE conducted a critical review of BCM's QA/QC 
program; toward that end, BCM provided GRE with QA/QC data in multiple Excel spreadsheet 
files. GRE compiled the data into a single, comprehensive QA/QC data worksheet for analysis 
and evaluation. Based on the results of GRE's review, in conjunction with observations and 
conversation with BCM personnel during the QP site visit, BCM's routine sample preparation, 
analytical procedures, and security measures are, in general, considered reasonable and 
adequate to ensure the validity and integrity of the data derived from BCM's sampling programs. 
GRE recommends that BCM expand the existing QA/QC program to include at least standards, 
blanks, and duplicates, and that QA/QC analysis be conducted on an on-going basis, including 
consistent acceptance/rejection tests. Each round of QA/QC analysis should be documented, 
and reports should include a discussion of the results and any corrective actions taken. 

 Data Verification 25.9

Data verification efforts included an on-site inspection of the Corani Project and core storage 
facility, check sampling, and manual and mechanical auditing of the Project database. Field 
observations during the site visit generally confirm previous reports on the geology of the 
Project area. Bedrock lithologies, alteration types, and significant structural features are all 
consistent with descriptions provided in existing Project reports, and the author did not see any 
evidence in the field that might significantly alter or refute the current interpretation of the local 
geologic setting. 

Specific core intervals from 35 separate drill holes were selected for visual inspection and 
potential check sampling based on a preliminary review of the drill hole logs and associated 
assay values. In all cases, the degree of visible alteration and evidence of mineralization 
observed was generally consistent with the grade range indicated by the original assay value. 
Laboratory analysis was completed by ALS Peru using the same sample preparation and 
analytical procedures as were used for the original samples. Standard t-Test statistical analysis 
was completed to look for any significant difference between the original and check assay 
population means. The results of the t-Test showed no statistically significant difference 
between the means of the two trials (original versus check assay).  

GRE completed a QAQC audit of the digital Project database by comparing a random selection 
of original assay certificates to the assay information contained in the Corani Project database. 
Results of the QAQC audit indicate a minor and acceptable error rate. GRE also completed a 
mechanical audit of the Project database in order to evaluate the integrity of data from a data 
entry perspective. Based on the results of the QP's check sampling effort, verification of drill 
hole collars in the field, visual examination of selected core intervals, and the results of both 
manual and mechanical database audit efforts, the QP considers the collar, lithology, and assay 
data contained in the Project data base to be reasonably accurate and suitable for use in 
estimating mineral resources and reserves. 

 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 25.10

Processing of the ore will be by conventional flotation recovery methods. The ore will be 
crushed close to the mine and the material conveyed to the processing plant, which will be 
approximately 500 m from the mine. The ore will be ground to 80% passing 106 microns in a 
SAG/Ball mill circuit. The material will then be floated with the rougher concentrates being 
reground to 80% passing 25 microns prior to cleaning to produce high-value separate lead-
silver and zinc concentrates. Concentrates will be trucked to the port of Matarani for ocean 
shipment to smelters. 



NI43-101 Technical Report

  Page 268 

The following additional opportunities are identified with regard to mineral processing and 
material handling. 

 Flotation optimization may improve metal recoveries. Testing under optimized conditions 
could increase recovery over that predicted by the geometallurgical model. 

 Data generated during additional geotechnical drilling may show that it is feasible to 
steepen pit slopes. 

 Higher concentrate grades may be achievable, which would increase the net smelter 
returns. 

 Operating cost improvements may be derived from using conveyor systems to transport 
tailings to the disposal sites. 

 Mineral Resource Estimates 25.11

GRE estimated the Mineral Resources for the Corani project during the first quarter of 2015. No 
new drilling, geology, or metallurgical test work has been performed since then. That work and 
the resulting Mineral Resources were documented and published in the May 30, 2015 Technical 
Report. The 2015 mineral resource block model was used for estimation of the Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves of the Corani Project in the current Corani Project Detailed 
Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) Technical Report. 

The resource model has three main lithologies: basement sediment with minor quantities of 
mineralization, the mineralized (pre-mineral) tuff, and a mostly unmineralized post mineral tuff 
which is assumed to be barren. Mineralization has been defined by 7 mineralization types, 
which were later grouped into, oxidized, transition, and sulphide groups. The Mineral Resources 
for the Corani project are shown inTable 25-1. The Mineral Resources were generated within 
the $30.00/troy ounce silver, $1.425/lb lead, and $1.50/lb zinc price Whittle pit shell and the 
calculated $11/tonne NSR cut-off. Table 25-2 shows the potentially leachable Mineral Resource 
contained within the Whittle pit shell at a 15 g/t cut-off that is available in addition to the Mineral 
Resource shown in Table 25-1.

 Mineral Reserve Estimates 25.12

The Mineral Reserve Estimate is based on the 2015 GRE resource block model, using updated 
Whittle optimization parameters, new pit designs, and new phase designs. 

The project Mineral Reserves consider only measured and indicated resource categories, which 
have been converted to proven and probable reserves categories, respectively. Mineral 
Reserves are defined as being the material to be fed to the process plant in the mine plan

and Petroleum (CIM). 

9) The Mineral Reserves have been estimated using the following metal prices: $20.00/oz Ag, $1.00/lb Zn, $0.95/lb 
Pb using a revenue factor 1.00 pit shell as a basis for the pit design. 

10) Only pre-mineral tuff type of material has been considered as reserves. 

11) NSR Cut-off grades used are equal or higher than: $11.11/t for the East Pit, and $11.26/t for Minas and Main pits. 

12) The effective date for these Mineral Reserves is 1 May 2017. 

13) Totals / Averages may not add up due to rounding of individual tonnes and grades. 

14) The tonnes and grades shown above are considered a Mineral Reserve because they have been demonstrated to 
be economically viable through the FEED study financial model using the following metal prices: $18.00/oz Ag, 

$1.10/lb Zn, $0.95/lb Pb. 

Additional geotechnical drilling should be completed within the planned pit. This will confirm the 
current pit slope design basis, and potentially allow an increase in the pit slope angles. After 
drilling, testing and analysis are required to design the final pit slopes. Boreholes should be 
completed as monitoring wells, and multiple-well aquifer testing will be performed to better 
assess the dewatering requirements for the material. The analysis for the pit slope design 
should consider a fault geological-structural model in 3D using the database from the geological 
drilling. 

 Mining Methods 25.13

The Corani Project will be mined using conventional open pit mining methods, with either an 
owner mine equipment or a contractor mining scenario. The base case assumes contractor 
mining. The rock will be broken by drilling 0.156-m diameter blast holes and blasting with ANFO 
and emulsion. Broken rock will then be loaded into 130-136 tonne trucks using a 13 m

3
 front 

end loader or one of two 15 m
3
 hydraulic shovels. Support equipment includes two D10 

bulldozers, a road grader, water trucks, rubber tire dozer, compactor, excavator, fuel and lube 
trucks, and other miscellaneous equipment. 

During a 10-month pre-production stripping, pioneering, haul road construction phase prior to 
plant construction, 4.7 million tonnes of waste rock will be mined to generate construction 
material. Another 7.6 million tonnes will be mined immediately prior to production. The mine is 
designed to generate 7.875 million tonnes of ore per year with strip ratios of 3:1 to 4:1 during 
the first two years, falling to below 2:1 the third year, and then below 1:1 the final 3 years of the 
mine life. 

 Recovery Methods 25.14

The process plant has been designed to treat 22,500 t/d of ore, operating 350 days per year 
and an average availability of 92%. 

 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 270 

For this purpose, the following process stages have been designed: 

 Primary Crushing and Coarse Ore Stockpile 

 SAG – Ball Mill 

 Sequential Lead and Zinc Flotation 

 Concentrate Thickening and Filtering (Pb, Zn) 

 Tailings Thickening and Filtering Plant 

 Dry Tailings Disposal Plant 

 Reagents and Utilities Areas.  
 

The plant layout has been optimised in area and costs. 

The design considers dust suppression systems in the crushing and coarse ore stockpile. The 
thickening and filtration for both, concentrates and tailings, have considered sump areas for 
containing and rehandling of the spills. 

 

The engineering also has incorporated the filtration of tailings and the transport to the waste 
deposit area. 

The design was based on the mining plan available at the beginning of the FEED, therefore it is 
required to up-date the engineering using the current mining schedule issued by BCM. 

In conclusion the process plant has a flexible design that allows to work in different operational 
conditions, noting the following:  

 By-pass for concentrates from Rougher and 1st Cleaner Lead flotation 

 By-pass for Zinc flotation circuit to the final tailings thickener, between others. 

The design also has in-line analyzers systems in both flotation circuits (lead and zinc) allowing 
to operate with higher sensibility with regards to the feeding grades to the plant. 

The specific power consumption for the process plant is 42.3 kWh/t of treated ore. 

Finally, it is concluded that there is a need to work with an intelligent treatment system, the 
distribution of recovered water, how to optimize its use and minimize negative impacts on the 
recovery of silver in the flotation stages. 

 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact 25.15

Additional laboratory testing on samples of waste rock, filtered tailings and the mix of them, 
should be performed, such as shear strength in drained and undrained conditions, characteristic 
curve for unsaturated permeability, resonant column and torsional shear for dynamic properties. 
The laboratory testing results will allow a better understanding of the behavior of those 
materials, alone and mixed, such as drained and undrained conditions, unsaturated seepage by 
rainfall, seismic response and so on, for a potential optimization of the Main Dump and pit 
backfill design. 

A sediment control plan should be implemented for avoiding the premature reduction of the 
Plant Water Pond capacity. The site wide water balance should be continuously updated based 
on an updated hydrology and plant parameters, such as natural and residual moisture of the 
waste rock and tailings, mine plan, production rate, production increase, water requirement, 
among others. In addition, monitoring station of solid and liquid flows should be implemented 
downstream the Plant Water Pond. 

Because of the unfavorable geotechnical characteristics of the Plant Water Pond foundation, a 
good quality control and quality assurance program should be implemented during construction, 
including geoelectrical surveying for verifying potential geomembrane defects which produce 
leaks. 

 



NI43-101 Technical Report

  Page 271 

A monitoring plan, monitoring instrument alert levels and operation and contingency manual, 
should be developed for the whole mine facilities. A best industry practice should be applied in 
the development of those documents, mainly for the critical components. Those documents and 
manuals will support the routine operation and will produce a safe environment. 

A group of specialists, including geotechnical, hydrologist and mechanical engineers, should 
carried out Annual Safety Reviews of the whole facilities, taking into consideration the Canadian 
Dam Association guidelines. The Safety Report should update the monitoring plan, operation 
and contingency manual, stability condition, water management, critical equipment operation of 
each mine facility and provide action lists for improving the functioning of them. Regardless the 
Annual Safety Review, all the facilities will have to be inspected after the occurrence of an 
extreme storm or earthquake event. 

 Market Studies and Contract 25.16

Penfold Limited conducted a review of the lead and zinc concentrate markets, smelting charges, 
penalties, concentrate handling, and land and ocean transportation costs. The supplied 
information was used as a guide to develop all associated payments and expenses associated 
with the sale of Corani concentrates. There are no letters of intent or sale agreements in place. 
All information is based on Penfold's experience for similar concentrates. 

 Economic Analysis 25.17

The economic analysis was performed using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) which is a 
standard industry practice. The key assumptions used for the study are shown in Table 25-4 
and establish a "Base Case". The table provided the life-of-project averages for grade recovery 
and these values vary over the life of the project depending on the head grades and split 
between mixed sulfide ore and transition ore. 

Table 25-4: Key Assumptions for the Corani Project – Base Case 

 

 
The results of the economic analysis for the project indicate an after-tax internal rate of return 
(IRR) of 15.1% and net present value (NPV) of $404.5 million at a 5% discount rate based on 
metal prices of $18.00 per ounce silver, $0.95 per pound for lead, and $1.10 per pound zinc. 

 Adjacent Properties 25.18

 Other Relevant Data and Information 25.19

Bear Creek and GMI have created a Project Execution Plan and have conducted a Hazard and 
Operability study, creating a project development pathway designed to minimize risk and 
uncertainty, manage construction performance and schedule, to deliver the project on budget. 
The project is planned to be constructed over a three-year time span with engineering 
continuing through 2017, access road, plant equipment procurement and fabrication beginning 
the first quarter of 2018. Commissioning and start up is scheduled for the first quarter of 2021. 

 Capital and Operating Costs 25.20

The Capital cost estimate (CAPEX) presented in this Report is for a silver-lead-zinc mine and 
concentrator capable of producing and processing an average of 22,500 tpd of ore (dry basis). 
The total life of mine capital investment for the Corani Project is estimated to be $585.6 million.  

The initial CAPEX includes the design, permitting, pre-stripping, construction, and 
commissioning of the mine, plant facilities, ancillary facilities, utilities and camp. The CAPEX 
also includes costs for engineering, construction management, and Owner's costs.  

The total life of mine operating cost is estimated at $3,295.6 million. Estimated life of mine 
average plant operating and maintenance cost is 10.11 USD/t ROM.

26 Recommendations 

Recommendations within this section relate to specific portions of this document's evaluations 
and studies. Identified items present opportunities to improve the understanding of technical 
issues associated with the project as well as reduce risk. Multiple identified options present 
opportunities to improve the project. The detailed scope of work will be developed as part of the 
front-end Detailed Engineering effort. A preliminary estimate of costs associated with this effort 
is included at the end of this section. 

 Geological Setting and Mineralization 26.1

 Geotechnical 26.1.1

Monitoring, Operation, and Contingency Plans 

A monitoring plan, monitoring instrument alert levels and operation and contingency manual, 
should be developed for the whole mine facilities. A best industry practice should be applied in 
the development of those documents, mainly for the critical components. Those documents and 
manuals will support the routine operation and will produce a safe environment. 

Plant Water Pond 

Because of the geotechnical characteristics of the Plant Water Pond foundation, a good quality 
control and quality assurance program should be implemented during construction, including 
geoelectrical surveying for verifying potential geomembrane defects which produce leaks. 

A group of specialists, including geotechnical, hydrologist and mechanical engineers, should 
carry out Annual Safety Reviews, taking into consideration the Canadian Dam Association 
guidelines. The Safety Report should update the monitoring plan, operation and contingency 
manual, stability condition, water management, critical equipment operation and provide action 
lists for improving the functioning of them. Regardless the Annual Safety Review, all the 
facilities will have to be inspected after the occurrence of an extreme storm or earthquake 
event. 

Main Dump 

The Main Dump footprint expands the previously proposed waste dump footprint. Construction 
and reclamation materials are available within the dump footprint. Characterization of these 
materials, and assessment of their ability to satisfy project requirements should be carried out 
as part of the early detailed design work. Foundation strength characterization (including 
undisturbed sampling and strength testing), detailed design of the seepage collection pond and 
pumping system, and additional construction material characterization are required. Limited 
tailings filtering and geotechnical tests were completed as part of the Feasibility Study.  

Additional testing should be completed to confirm the allowable tailings moisture content, the 
ability to filter the tailings, and final drain-down and stability characteristics (including testing of 
filter tailings dynamic/seismic properties). Updated geotechnical modeling and a detailed 
placement sequence for co-disposal and PAG encapsulation must be performed based on new 
field and laboratory data. Finally, the consolidation of tailings under loading must be ascertained 
to determine if excess pore pressure conditions are occurring and to determine the seepage 
behaviour of tailings under geostatic loading. These analyses must be performed for the Main 
Dump and for the Este pit backfill area. 

In the next design stage characterization tests on filtered tailings and tailings mixed with mine 
waste simulating conditions which will occur in the stockpile should be carried out.

 It is recommended that dynamic resonant column and torsional cut tests be carried out on a  
mixture (1 to 1) of the mine waste and filtered tailings to determine the actual behavior of 
the materials in the stockpile. This test also allows estimation in laboratory of the velocity 
profile of the material. 

 It is also recommended that triaxial tests of a 1: 1 mixture of filtered tailings and mine waste 
to assess the characteristics of the co-disposition of the two materials.  

 It is recommended that type MASW and MAM to geophysical tests be completed obtain the 
profile of velocities in the field, once the deposit begins operations. Although conservative 
parameters have been used in the 1D response analysis, this will determine any behavior 
not observed in the existing documentation, which may generate potential problems during 
the operation. 

 Consideration should be given to the recommendations presented and incorporated in the 
seismic design of pile as the design represents a deposit of up to 300 m height measured 
from the bottom. 

 The 2D physical stability evaluation using the equilibrium method analyzed two critical 
sections of the deposit under static and pseudo-static conditions, the latter for a return time 
of 475 years. The safety factors resulting from this analysis were higher than the minimums 
recommended in the design criteria. Also, the permanent displacements induced by 
earthquakes were smaller than the allowable. Both criteria verify the stability of the design 
presented.  The parameters used in the analysis must be validated with above laboratory 
tests. 

 Installation of geotechnical instrumentation consisting of: thirty-eight survey monuments, 
two robotic stations, two vertical inclinometers, four vibration string piezometers, two open 
tube piezometers and one accelerometer is recommended. The objective of the 
instrumentation is to monitor displacement, groundwater level and water quality control, to 
verify the behavior of the pile and estimate any potential problems that may arise during the 
operation. The survey monuments will be located on the slopes and on the summit crest.  

During the construction stage it is recommended that the properties of the unsuitable materials 
be monitored.  

 A percolation analysis using a two-dimensional model of finite elements of constant or 
variable hydraulic load, will allow evaluation of permeabilities in saturated and unsaturated 
conditions for the materials that compose the section.   

 Estimation of the undrained shear strength of the material by one of the following 
alternatives should be carried out: 1) Laboratory Test - Unconfirmed Triaxial No Drain (UU); 
2) Field Test – CPTu; 3) Field Test - Torvane which recommends the installation of two 
piezometers in order to constantly monitor the piezometric surface and the flow conditions 
in the deposit. One of the piezometers will be installed in the deposit and the other in the 
containment dam.  

 The surface water management plan should include a diversion of runoff around the outside 
the pile during material placement and operation. Careful construction, placing more highly 
saturated material in the back of the pile and less saturated material in the front is also 
recommended. 

Topsoil 

During the construction stage it is recommended that the properties of the topsoil material be 
monitored.   

 Estimation of the undrained shear strength of the material by one of the following 
alternatives should be carried out: 1) Laboratory Test - Unconfirmed Triaxial No Drain (UU); 
2) Field Test – CPTu; 3) Field Test - Torvane which recommends the installation of two 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 275 

piezometers in order to constantly monitor the piezometric surface and the flow conditions 
in the deposit. One of the piezometers will be installed in the deposit and the other in the 
containment dam.  

 It is also recommended that two piezometers be installed to constantly monitor the 
piezometric surface and the flow conditions in the Topsoil Dump. One of the piezometers 
should be installed in the deposit, and the other on the containment dam.  

 It is also recommended that survey monuments be installed to monitor possible settlements 
and / or displacements in the pile. These survey monuments will be located on the slopes 
and on the summit crest.  

 The surface water management plan should include a diversion of runoff around the outside 
the pile during material placement and operation. Careful construction, placing more highly 
saturated material in the back of the pile and less saturated material in the front is also 
recommended. 

Mine  

Additional geotechnical drilling should be completed within the planned pit. This will confirm the 
current pit slope design basis and potentially allow an increase in the pit slope angles. The pit 
will intersect the unconsolidated sediments lining the floor of the upper bofedal and lower 
bofedal areas. Additional drilling, testing, and analyses are required to design the pit slopes 
within the bofedal soils and to develop a detailed plan for dewatering and mining the bofedal soil 
material. This will involve drilling several boreholes through the unconsolidated sediments, with 
production of detailed stratigraphic logs and undisturbed sampling for density and strength 
testing of the unconsolidated material. Boreholes would be completed as monitoring wells, and 
multiple-well aquifer testing will be performed to better assess the dewatering requirements for 
the material. Detailed pit slope design and soil mining plans must then be developed.  

 Exploration 26.2

GRE recommends that BCM produce annual (or seasonal) exploration reports to describe the 
drilling and sampling carried out during each given year or drilling campaign. The exploration 
report should contain adequate detail concerning the drill rig, drilling contractor, number of 
holes, total meters, recovery rates, drill targets, and rationale for drill hole distribution, etc., to 
ensure that all pertinent information is captured and catalogued in a practical and efficient 
manner for ease of future use. 

 Data Verification, Sample Preparation, Analysis, & Security 26.3

GRE recommends that BCM establish a routine, internal mechanical audit procedure to check 
for overlaps, gaps, total drill hole length inconsistencies, non-numeric assay values, and 
negative numbers. The internal mechanical audit should be carried out after any significant 
update to the database, and the results of each audit, including any corrective actions taken, 
should be documented and stored for future use in database validation.  

Based on the positive assay results of the selected intervals of previously un-sampled post-
mineral tuff, the QP recommends that BCM sample at least one 2-m interval for every 20 m 
drilled and logged as post-mineral tuff. If positive assay results are returned, additional intervals 
should be selected accordingly to ensure that all mineralized material is analyzed.  

Based on observations and conversation with BCM personnel during the QP site visit, in 
conjunction with the results of GRE's review and evaluation of BCM's QA/QC program, the QP 
makes the following recommendations: 

 Formal, written procedures for data collection and handling should be developed and made 
available to BCM field personnel. These should include procedures and protocols for field 



NI43-101 Technical Report 
Corani Project Detailed Engineering Phase 1 (FEED) 

 

  Page 276 

work, geological mapping and logging, database construction, sample chain of custody, and 
documentation trail. These procedures should also include detailed and specific QA/QC 
procedures for analytical work, including acceptance/rejection criteria for batches of 
samples. 

 A detailed review of field practices and sample collection procedures should be performed 
on a regular basis to ensure that the correct procedures and protocols are being followed. 

 Review and evaluation of laboratory work should be an on-going process, including 
occasional visits to the laboratories involved. 

 BCM's existing QA/QC program should be expanded to include at least standards, blanks, 
and duplicates. All QA/QC control samples sent for analysis should be blind, meaning that 
the laboratory should not be able to differentiate a check sample from the regular sample 
stream. The minimum control unit for check sample insertion rate should be the batch of 
samples originally sent to the laboratory. Samples should be controlled on a batch by batch 
basis and rejection criteria should be enforced. Ideally, assuming a 40-sample batch, the 
following control samples should be sent to the primary laboratory: 

o Two blanks (5% of the total number of samples). Of these, one coarse blank should be 
inserted for every 4

th
 blank inserted (25% of the total number of blanks inserted). 

o Two pulp duplicates (5% of the total number of samples). 

o Two coarse duplicates (5% of the total number of samples). 

o Two standards appropriate to the expected grade of the batch of samples (5% of the 
total number of samples). 

 For drill hole samples, the control samples sent to a second (check) laboratory should be 
from pulp duplicates in all cases and should include one blank, two sample pulps, and one 
standard for every 40-sample batch.  

 The purpose of the coarse duplicates is to quantify the variances introduced into the assay 
grade by errors at different sample preparation stages. Coarse duplicates are inserted into 
the primary sample stream to provide an estimate of the sum of the assay variance plus the 
sample preparation variance up to the primary crushing stage. An alternative to the coarse 
duplicate is the field duplicate, which, in the case of core samples, is a duplicate from the 
core box (i.e., a quarter core or the other half core). Because sample preparation is 
currently carried out by the laboratory (and not by BCM), if coarse duplicates are preferred 
(to preserve drill core), the coarse duplicates should be sent for preparation and assaying 
by the second laboratory. 

 QA/QC analysis should be conducted on an on-going basis and should include consistent 
acceptance/rejection tests. Each round of QA/QC analysis should be documented, and 
reports should include a discussion of the results and any corrective actions taken.  

 Mineral Processing and Metallurgical Testing 26.4

Additional metallurgical testing should be completed to optimize the known flotation test 
conditions. The reagent scheme should be optimized, and additional testing could explore the 
possibility of higher ZnSO4 dosages on difficult samples in addition to removing and/or reducing 
other depressants. 

The geometallurgical model was developed using all metallurgical testing data, including tests 
representing non-optimized conditions. Once additional testing has been performed, and 
samples representing optimized test conditions are available, the statistical model should be re-
evaluated to ensure estimated recoveries represent optimal conditions.

The selected process flowsheet should be re-tested to confirm: 

 Primary grind size 

 Regrind size 

 Residence time for each flotation stage 

 Reagent selection and dosage  

Additional lock cycle testing is recommended for each deposit, particularly material representing 
moderate to low zinc grades, which is under-represented in the current test database. This will 
allow for validation of the final estimated recoveries and the selected concentrate grades. This 
testing should include analysis of minor elements; limited test data is available regarding the 
concentration of minor elements in the final concentrate. 

The geotechnical testwork on filtered tailings mentioned in Section 26.1 may lead to the need 
for additional tailing filtration testing. The filtration equipment needed for mechanical placement 
of tailings is a significant capital and operating cost to the project. It will be important to 
determine the filtered tailing physical properties so that the equipment can be specified to 
achieve the required results. 

Testing of an acid brine leaching process for oxide mineral resources should be considered, or 
testing of an alternative flowsheet, for the non-floatable resource areas of the deposit. If this 
were successful, it could potentially add value to the project. 

 Mineral Resource Estimates 26.5

The 2011 Feasibility Study recommended review of the check assay and standards because 
significant scatter was observed in that data. This issue has not been fully resolved, and future 
drill programs should work to address the issue.  

 Mining Methods 26.6

GRE recommends BCM obtain formal bids from several mine contractors and mine equipment 
quotations from equipment manufactures' including MARC quotes in order to more fully 
evaluate the owner mining and contractor mining alternatives. 

 Recovery Methods 26.7

 The design of the plant must be updated considering the latest mining plan 

 Confirm the burden and spacing of blasting to reduce the stationary grizzly oversize (1 m 
opening) and the rock breaker duty. 

 Optimize the feed and discharge primary crusher bin capacities to match with the haul truck 
size. 

 Evaluate the need to include a cover for the coarse ore stockpile based on environmental 
considerations. 

 Complete further detailed design on the pebble handling system once more data is obtained 
on their effects on SAG mill operation. 

 Incorporate metallurgical samplers in lead and zinc flotation feed circuits and both final 
concentrates and tailings to be able to realize auditable mass balances for silver, lead, and 
zinc.

 Carry out new tests using SFR flotation cells with the purpose of reducing the amount of 
penalty elements (As, Sb, clays) and maximising the silver recovery in the lead concentrate. 

 Incorporate two independent process water circuits for lead and zinc flotations to remove 
the potential detrimental effects recirculated water may have the lead flotation efficiency and 
further ensure optimum lead and silver recovery. This could potentially reduce the reagent 
consumption and result in operating cost savings for the process plant. 

 Incorporate a hydrogen peroxide and activated carbon in-line additions into the process 
plant design. 

 Incorporate a sulphuric acid addition to better control the pH of the recirculated water. 

 Carry out a dynamic simulation to detect possible bottle necks in the plant. This should be 
done as one of the first steps of the continued detail engineering design. 

 Power Supply 26.8

The project electrical supply should be designed to be independent of the other possible 
community electrification requirements related to the Project in order to ensure operational 
reliability. 

  Risks 26.8.1

The following risks have been identified: 

 The high altitude of the site may have a greater-than-expected negative impact on 
worker productivity. 

 The high altitude of the site may result in greater-than-expected impacts on the function 
and capacity of diesel-powered equipment and electrical components. 

 As with any large-scale mine development, there is a risk that additional capital may be 
difficult to raise in the event that costs increase during the pre-production period. 

 A currency exchange risk exists.  A weakening of the Peruvian Nuevo Sol (PEN) would 
lower the cost of in-country expenses. However imported materials, priced in USD, 
would become higher. During operations, the sale of metals, priced in USD, would 
benefit from a weaker PEN.  A strengthening PEN would have the opposite effects.  It is 
also important to note that BCM holds cash and short-term investments priced in USD 
that will help offset risk associated with the exchange rate. 

 Although local communities have generally supported the Project development, there is 
a risk that sentiments could change, or that special interest groups from outside the 
community could mobilize opposition to the Project. 

 During operations, a potential silver migration from the lead flotation circuit to zinc 
flotation circuit must be evaluated with additional metallurgical testing.  

 Market Studies and Contract 26.9

The smelters selected for the study should be contacted to verify their capacity and ability to 
accept the proposed quantity and quality of produced lead and zinc concentrates. As part of the 
program, additional concentrate analysis should be completed to further define the concentrate 
qualities. Letters of intent would be desirable for future project financing and associated due 
diligence along with firm quotes from the smelters.  In addition, firm quotes should be obtained 
to confirm the transportation costs for the concentrate to the Matarani port as well as port 
handling costs. Under current market conditions, there may be an opportunity to improve 
business terms beyond the assumptions used in this study.

 Environmental Studies, Permitting and Social or Community Impact 26.10

In 2016, the Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the modification of the ESIA based on the 
Optimized and Final Feasibility Study prepared by 2015.  Another modification of the ESIA 
based on the FEED study is required and should be pursued by Bear Creek in the short term. 

In addition, it is recommended that Bear Creek commence the permitting process on water 
rights and mine plan approval, both of which are critical, early-stage permits. Bear Creek is also 
encouraged to utilize all efforts in maintaining its social license and ensuring the continued 
strong support from local communities, local and regional governments, and the central 
Peruvian government. 

 Capital and Operating Cost 26.11

 Optimization 26.11.1

It may be possible to reduce the cost of delivering tailings to the Main Dump and pit backfill 
disposal sites by varying the proportion of tailings delivered by conveyor systems and by trucks 
during the period when tailings are being produced. It is recommended that an optimization 
study be carried out to determine this, and a detailed plan should be devised. Tailings will be 
co-disposed with waste rock in the Main Dump and pit backfills. In general, it is expected that it 
will be cheaper to use conveyors instead of trucks to deliver tailings to ultimate disposal 
destinations, but exclusive use of conveyors may be less practical for tailings destined for the pit 
backfill. During the period when pit backfilling will be taking place, the current schedule indicates 
that truck capacity will be available; therefore, an optimization study should specify the ideal mix 
of conveyor/truck transport of tailings over time, depending partly on truck availability. 

A study should be conducted to match operating equipment to the high-altitude conditions, 
potentially identifying equipment outfitted with pressurized cabs and other worker comfort and 
performance additions. Caterpillar equipment offers high-altitude arrangements (HAA), and 
these modifications allow their power ratings to be valid to 4,877 m. 

 Other Relevant Data and Information 26.12

Complete the Project Execution Plan (PEP) and project risk assessment called a Hazard and 
Operability study (HAZOP) as described in Section 24. 

 Constructability 26.13

Generation of a site-wide cut-and-fill material balance is recommended, including specialized 
construction materials such as clays, concrete aggregate, drain rock, road base, and rip rap. 

 Water Balance 26.14

The probabilistic water balance employs models from 2015 to predict pit dewatering and main 
dump seepage quantities. These models are expected to be sufficiently accurate for this level of 
study; however, they must be updated to reflect the revised mine plan and the planned 
modifications of the main dump construction methods. Once these models are revised and new 
results are obtained, the water balance must be remodelled to ensure the project can meet the 
required water quality and water quantity commitments in the ESIA.  The surface water 
management plan will likely require updates to meet the new water balance.
