1.0 SUMMARY 
 

1.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Micon International Limited (Micon) has been retained by Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. 

(Avalon) to prepare a Technical Report under Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-

101) which discloses the results of the updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA) for 

the Separation Rapids Lithium Project. 

 

The objective of this PEA is to demonstrate the economic potential of a revised production 

schedule which includes sales of three flotation concentrate products (petalite, lepidolite and 

feldspar) only. This study excludes conversion of petalite to lithium hydroxide for use in the 

production of Lithium Ion Batteries, although if market demand requires, and subject to 

financing availability, Avalon could proceed in the future with the development of a lithium 

hydroxide demonstration plant, followed by a full-scale lithium hydroxide production plant. 

 

The PEA is based on processing 475,000 tonnes of mineralized material per year to produce 

approximately 1.32 million tonnes (Mt) of petalite, 220,000 t of lepidolite and 1.31 Mt of 

feldspar over a 20-year total operating life.  

 

Avalon is proposing a phased development program for the Project starting with the 

development of the mine and a flotation concentrator for petalite and lepidolite production. A 

feldspar recovery circuit will be added in operating Year 5.  

 

This PEA has been prepared by Micon under the terms of its agreement with Avalon. As 

discussed in the relevant sections of the report, Micon has prepared a mine plan and schedule 

and has prepared an economic analysis of the Project. Micon has reviewed the metallurgical 

testwork and the mineral processing flowsheet, the infrastructure requirements, and the 

capital and operating cost estimates prepared by Avalon and its retained consultants.  

 

The PEA is based on updated mineral resource estimates for lithium and feldspar contained 

in the Separation Rapids Lithium Deposit (SRLD), prepared by Avalon dated 23 May, 2018. 

This updated estimate is considered not materially different from the previous independent 

one reported in a NI 43-101 Technical Report dated 10 November, 2016. 

 

The Separation Rapids property is located in north-western Ontario, 55 km due north of 

Kenora and about 79 km by road. It is centred on latitude 50 15' 30" N, longitude 94 35' W 

(UTM coordinates: 388441E 5568996N in NAD 83, Zone 15N15). The property consists of 

eight mineral claims and one Mining Lease. The claims comprise 153 claim units, totalling 

2,448 ha (6,049 acres).  

 

Other than minor and largely funded reclamation requirements under the Advanced 

Exploration Permit, there are no known environmental liabilities associated with the 

Separation Rapids property. Avalon holds all necessary permits required to access the 

Separation Rapids property and to conduct exploration. Exploration permits will be required 



 
 

 2 

for additional drilling in the future. There are no known factors or risks that may affect 

access, title or the right or ability to perform work on the property. 

 

Mining and mineral concentration will take place at the Separation Rapids property. 

Shipment of concentrates from the site will be by truck. However, a rail loading trans-

shipment facility will be required in order to access rail transportation for product shipment 

and some inbound supplies. This loading site trans-shipment facility is planned to be located 

on the CNR line in the vicinity of Redditt, Ontario, approximately 55 km by road from the 

Separation Rapids site. 

 

1.2 PHYSIOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE 
 

The Separation Rapids area is typical of much of northwestern Ontario and the Canadian 

Shield. The property is relatively flat with an average elevation of approximately 350 masl. 

Local topographic relief is limited to 50 m or less with typical Precambrian glaciated terrain. 

The English River system is proximal to all claim groups. The area is located within the 

Boreal Hardwood Transition or Mixed Boreal Forest. A Species at Risk Act assessment was 

completed, and no endangered or at-risk species were identified in the area of the proposed 

Project. The climate is typical of Canada's mid-latitudes with long, cold winters and 

comparatively short spring-summer-fall periods. 

 

The closest centre with significant services is Kenora. Forestry, tourism and mining are the 

three largest sectors of the Kenora economy. The closest community is Whitedog, home of 

the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations of One Man Lake, Swan Lake and White Dog. The 

SRLD is situated in the Traditional Land Use Area of these First Nations as recognized under 

an agreement signed in 1983 with the Province of Ontario. 

 

1.3 HISTORY 
 

Rare-element mineralization in the area was first encountered along the English River near 

Separation Rapids in 1932. The petalite-bearing SRLD and an associated group of rare-metal 

pegmatites, were discovered by Dr. Fred Breaks of the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) as 

a result of a detailed study of rare-metal pegmatites in the region between 1994 and 1996. 

Avalon acquired its initial interest in the property through an option agreement with local 

prospectors who had staked the original claims in 1996. 

 

Exploration on the SRLD, by Avalon, in the late-1990s was accompanied by a scoping level 

metallurgical study by Lakefield Research Limited and a marketing study by Equapolar 

Resource Consultants which concluded that the petalite mineralization was suitable as an 

industrial mineral product in thermal shock resistant glass applications. Additional 

exploration and drilling programs were completed by Avalon in 2017 and 2018. 

 

Since 2014, Avalon has not only investigated market opportunities for petalite in the glass 

and ceramics industries, it has also developed processes for recovering concentrates of 



 
 

 3 

lepidolite and feldspars as well as a process for converting petalite into lithium carbonate and 

hydroxide. 

 

1.4 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

The Late Archean SRLD belongs to the petalite sub-type of the complex-type class of rare-

metal pegmatites. The SRLD, its parent granite, the Separation Rapids Pluton and associated 

rare-metal pegmatites, occur within the Archean Separation Lake Metavolcanic Belt (SLMB) 

which forms the boundary between the English River subprovince to the north and the 

Winnipeg River subprovince to the south. Both subprovinces are part of the larger Archean 

Superior Province of the Canadian Shield. Avalon has further subdivided the SRLD into 

three sub-zones, namely the Separation Rapids Pegmatite (SRP), Western Pegmatite and 

Eastern Swarm.  Based on lithological, mineralogical and textural variations, the SRP itself 

has been subdivided into five distinct lithological units and subunits, 3a, 3b, 4, 5 and 6. 

 

The Separation Rapids area is underlain predominantly by a mafic metavolcanic sequence 

(amphibolite or Avalon's Unit 1), consisting of flows, tuffs, subordinate epiclastic 

metasediments and rare iron formation horizons and rhyolites. Locally, on the Avalon 

property itself, the metavolcanic sequence is restricted to amphibolite. 

 

In the SRP, petalite, potassium feldspar and sodium feldspar are major rock-forming 

minerals, with subordinate amounts of other minerals including spodumene, lithian 

muscovite, lepidolite, and quartz of which some occur as potentially economically 

recoverable minerals.  

 

The petalite-bearing Unit 6 is the principal unit of interest within the SRP. Geological 

mapping and assays for surface and drill core samples show that mineralogy and lithium 

oxide (Li2O) grades of the mineralization (average 4.78% Li2O) in the SRP are relatively 

homogeneous and that the petalite is close to the theoretical (stoichiometric) chemical 

composition (4.88% Li2O), as well as being very pure, with marked absence of deleterious 

elements such as iron.  

 

Potassium feldspars in the SRP have been shown to be rubidium-rich, high-purity end-

members. 

 

The Li2O content of the micas ranges from very low to over 6%. The highest Li2O values are 

in the micas found in Subunit 6d. This includes the pink to red mica referred to as lepidolite 

that is the distinctive identifying feature of Subunit 6d. 

 

1.5 EXPLORATION 
 

Following the discovery of the SRLD in 1996, Avalon carried out a brief prospecting and 

sampling program in November, 1996. This was followed by a program of geological 

mapping, trenching, line-cutting and magnetometry in 1997 and 1998.

In the period from 2000 to 2014, little work of a geoscientific nature was carried out at the 

property. The main activity relating to advancing the Project was process testwork and, 

consequently, the main activities at site were collection of samples, up to bulk sample size, 

for mineral product development. 

 

Avalon completed a field program in July and August, 2017, on the Paterson Lake claim 

group. Lithogeochemical and biogeochemical surveys were undertaken over the claims, in 

conjunction with prospecting for new lithium pegmatites. 

 

1.6 DRILLING 
 

Avalon has drilled at the Separation Rapids Lithium Project in a number of campaigns 

between 1997 and 2018. The total number of diamond drill holes is 80 for a cumulative total 

of 13,192 m. 

 

Three of these holes were drilled during April and May, 2001 for the purposes of a 

geotechnical investigation of the rock at the proposed open pit mine and to determine 

preliminary pit slope design parameters. The potential for water inflow into the open pit was 

also evaluated. 

 

1.7 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 

Surface samples taken in the 1990s were shipped to Chemex Labs Ltd. in Thunder Bay, 

Ontario for preparation then to Chemex's laboratories in Mississauga, Ontario and 

Vancouver, British Columbia for subsequent assaying for lithium and a range of other 

elements. Drill core was logged and split with half of the core being sent for assay and the 

other half being stored in core boxes on site. Core sample intervals were varied, depending 

on lithology, to a maximum of 3 m. Split core samples were shipped to XRAL where they 

were assayed for lithium, rubidium using ICP and AA for rubidium and cesium.  

 

In 2016, Avalon resampled drill core from the 1990s' programs. The objective was to re-

assay the core with modern methods and inserted lithium rock standards for comparison to 

the historic data. 

 

In both the 2017 and 2018 diamond drill programs, all lithium bearing pegmatites (Unit 6) 

and representative non-mineralized pegmatite intercepts were sampled on continuous 2 m 

intervals, with shorter intervals where constrained by geologic contacts and amphibolite host 

rock. Samples were transported in sealed bags to the ALS preparation laboratory in Thunder 

Bay then pulps, including standards and blanks, were shipped to ALS in Vancouver for 

analysis. 

 

The drill database contains 185 specific gravity (SG) values for various lithologies on the 

SRLD. Based on these measurements, the average SG for pegmatite and amphibolite (waste) 

was 2.62 and 3.04, respectively. The SG measurements showed low variability.

1.8 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

The mineral resource estimation is based on the original drilling by Avalon in 1997 to 2001 

as well as the additional 2017 and 2018 drill program results. The 2018 assay database has 

been updated using the one created by Micon in 1999 as a basis. There were certain quality 

assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures applied and reported on at the time of creation 

of the database that included check assays at a second laboratory and independent assaying 

by Micon. 

 

Subsequently, Avalon completed further verification of the drill data including cross-

checking the database against original field records such as drill logs, cross-checking the 

assays against laboratory assay certificates and re-assaying drill core splits with internally-

inserted, certified lithium standards. 

 

The assay laboratory comparison (XRAL and Chemex) undertaken in the 1990s using 

duplicate coarse rejects from drill core gave similar results. Despite some small differences, 

both the lithium and rubidium analyses from XRAL and Chemex were close and showed 

similar trends with high R2 values for the correlation. This indicated high and acceptable 

reliability in the analyses. 

 

For the purpose of this PEA, Avalon verified the drill hole database against historic data 

records such as drill logs, assay certificates, and other original sources of data in order to 

ensure that there were no errors present database used for resource estimation. Drill hole 

angle, direction and the maximum hole depth were also verified.   

 

1.8.1 Certified Standard 
 

Avalon prepared a certified rock lithium analysis standard by shipping 16 kg of SRP to CDN 

Resource Laboratories Ltd. (CDN) in Langley, British Columbia. A Round Robin analysis 

procedure was then completed with five samples of the material being shipped to each of six 

laboratories for lithium analysis, with associated analytical methods performed. It was 

concluded that the lithium standard was a suitable standard for QA/QC of Separation Rapids 

drill core samples. The certified value for the standard SR2016 is 1.48% Li2O with a standard 

deviation of 0.03% Li2O. 

 

In 2016, Avalon completed a program of re-assaying a limited amount of drill core with the 

insertion of the certified lithium standard. Comparing the 2016 re-assays for Li2O of 42 

samples with the 1990's results showed a small positive bias for the 2016 samples at smaller 

Li2O concentrations and identical mean values for each laboratory. These results confirmed 

the historic data.   

 

1.9 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

A number of phases of metallurgical testing since 1997 have been completed by Avalon 

using samples obtained from of the SRLD. The work prior to 2014 was mainly undertaken by 



 
 

 6 

SGS Mineral Services at Lakefield, Ontario (SGS-L). This work not only included the 

recovery of petalite, but also a number of other mineral products which also can be found in 

the lithium bearing pegmatite. 

 

The work since 2014 was mainly undertaken by Dorfner Analysenzentrum und 

Anlagenplanungsgesellschaft mbH (ANZAPLAN), a German company that specializes in the 

processing of high purity industrial and strategic minerals. This work focussed on the 

recovery of a petalite flotation concentrate and the subsequent processing of this concentrate 

to produce a high-quality lithium hydroxide product suitable for the lithium battery industry.   

 

The lepidolite, petalite and feldspar recovery processes utilized for this PEA were developed 

and tested by ANZAPLAN. Approximately 20 testwork programs were undertaken by 

ANZAPLAN between 2014 and 2018, including the production of 1 t of petalite concentrate 

in a pilot program conducted in 2016. ANZAPLAN also developed the process to recover a 

mixed Na/K-feldspar product and completed preliminary testwork on this material which 

indicated the suitability of this product in not only the ceramics industry but also as filler in 

paint, fibreglass and other products. 

 

Using the results generated by this testwork, Avalon is able to demonstrate the following: 

• Optical sorting can be used to remove amphibolite host rock material ahead of the 
flotation process. 

• A petalite concentrate assaying over 4% Li2O can be produced which, because of its 
low impurity levels, is potentially an excellent feed material to the specialized 

glass/ceramics industries. In addition, a high grade 4.5% Li2O petalite concentrate can 

also be produced (with low sodium and potassium levels). 

• Lepidolite concentrates containing approximately 4.5% Li2O can be produced. 

• A low impurity mixed (sodium/potassium) feldspar concentrate can also be produced 
which has applications in a number of ceramic applications as well as a filler in paints 

and other products. 

• There is potential to produce other by-products from the mineralized material, 
including a high purity quartz, and for additional lithium recovery from micas 

contained in the magnetic fraction. 

 

1.10 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 

Lithium, rubidium, tantalum, cesium and feldspar mineral resource estimates for the 

Separation Rapids Lithium Project have been prepared by Avalon under the supervision of 

Dr. William Mercer, P.Geo. (ON), Vice President, Exploration of Avalon, who is the 

Qualified Person (QP) for the estimates. This updated mineral resource estimate is based on 

the eight diamond drill holes drilled by Avalon in 2017 and 2018, in combination with the 

data from the 1997 to 2001 drill holes, which were used in previous resource estimates.  

 



 
 

 7 

The Separation Rapids Lithium Project overall Measured plus Indicated mineral resource is 

estimated to be 8.41 Mt at a grade of 1.41% Li2O, using a 0.6% Li2O cut-off grade, as 

summarized in Table 1.1. The Inferred mineral resource is 1.79 Mt at a grade of 1.35% Li2O. 

The total feldspar content of the mineralized zone is estimated at 43%. The two main 

mineralogical zones in the deposit, the petalite zone (6a, b, c) and the lepidolite + petalite 

zone (6d) have been estimated separately and contain combined Measured and Indicated 

resources of 6.42 Mt grading 1.41% Li2O and 1.99 Mt grading 1.41% Li2O, respectively 

(Table 1.1). This mineral resource estimate was presented in an Avalon news release on May 

23, 2018 and is deemed not to be materially different from the previous estimate dated 

October, 2016.

Notes: 

1. This resource estimate is valid as of May 23, 2018. 
2. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resources. 
3. The Qualified Person for this Mineral Resource estimate is William Mercer, PhD, P.Geo. (ON). 
4. The resource estimate is based on Avalon's drilling of 74 previous holes totalling 11,644 m drilled 

between 1997 and 2017 and a further four holes totalling 1,282 m in 2018. 

5. Drill data was organised in Maxwell DataShed™ and for estimation purposes was transferred to the 
Geovia GEMS 6.8 Software, wherein the block model was developed. 

6. The geological units were modeled as outlined by drill core logs. 
7. Resources were estimated by interpolating composites within a block model of 10 x 10 x 3 m blocks 

oriented along the deposit strike. 

8. Grade interpolation used the Ordinary Kriging method combined with variograms and search ellipses 
modeled for each rock unit. For PZ unit, search ellipses of 50 x 35 x 15 m and 175 x 125 x 45 m were 

used for Passes 1 and 2, respectively. For LPZ unit, search ellipses of 35 x 25 x 8, 75 x 50 x 15 and 

115 x 75 x 25 were used for Passes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 

9. Measured material was defined as blocks interpolated using Passes 1 and 2, using composites from ≥ 
4 drill holes and a distance ≤ 25 m to the nearest composite and additional blocks with excellent 

geological and grade continuity. Indicated material includes blocks interpolated with Pass 1 and 2 

search ellipses, using ≥ 3 drill holes and a distance ≤ 35 m to the nearest composite and blocks with 

geological and grade continuity. Inferred material was defined as blocks interpolated with all Passes, 

composites from ≥ 2 drill holes and interpolated geological continuity up to 40 m below diamond drill 

holes. 

10. Two-metre composites were used, and no capping was necessary. 
11. The mean density of 2.65 t/m3 was used for unit 6a,b,c and 2.62 t/m3 for unit 6d.

12. The cut-off grade reported in this resource estimate, 0.6% Li2O, is consistent with the previously 
published resource estimates by Avalon (Preliminary Economic Assessment, 2016; November 15, 

2017 resource estimate). 

13. The total feldspar contents were estimated utilizing QEMSCAN
®

 analysis of 38 drill core intervals 

distributed throughout the deposit. 

14. Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability and their value may be materially 
affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other issues. 

 

The primary lithium-bearing minerals, petalite and lepidolite, are found within the ~600 m by 

~80 m SRP. Surface mapping and results from 80 diamond drill holes were used to create a 

3D model of the host lithology which was used to constrain the interpolation of assays. The 

Project database is maintained in Maxwell DataShed™ software and the resource estimation 

utilized GEMS 6.8.1. 

 

The Project database contains 80 diamond drill holes over a total length of 13,192 m drilled 

between 1997 and 2018 by Avalon. Assay values for Li2O, Rb2O, Cs2O and Ta2O5 were 

recorded for 3,243 mineralized samples and 148 country rock samples which were studied 

for environmental impact assessment purposes.  

 

1.11 MINING METHODS 
 

1.11.1 Pit Optimization 
 

Pit optimization was undertaken using the mineral resource block model imported into 

Surpac™ to create a block model compatible with the pit optimization software. A 

preliminary optimization was performed using Whittle™ software. Cost parameters were 

applied to the optimization model to assess the volume of mineral resources available for 

economic development. The purpose of the modelling was to generate an estimate of the 

mineable tonnage based on the mineral resources. 

 

The pit optimization indicated that the economic cut-off grade was approximately 1.20% 

Li2O and the optimization run suggested a life of mine (LOM) plant feed tonnage of 

approximately 8.6 Mt at a grade of 1.39% Li2O. 

 

1.11.2 Pit Design, Development and Schedule 
 

A conceptual pit design was conducted from the bottom up using PEA design parameters and 

the selected optimum pit shell as a template. Figure 1.1 shows a plan and view of the pit 

design. 

 



 
 

 9 

Figure 1.1  

Plan View of the Pit Design 

 

 
 

The proposed method of mining is by conventional open pit methods using drilling and 

blasting, loading with excavators and shovels and hauling with rigid dump trucks. Waste 

from the pit will initially be composed of overburden and will be dumped in the topsoil 

stockpile. As the pit is developed harder waste rock will be excavated and will be stored on 

separate waste dumps. 

 

The Project will be undertaken by contractor-operated equipment and labour. Preproduction 

waste rock will be used to construct site roads, including the main haul roads and will also be 

used for the construction of tailing, concentrate and settling basin dam walls.  

 

A conceptual production schedule has been produced using MineSched™ software. The 

production schedule is based on mining 475,000 t/y of petalite and lepidolite mineralized 

material. The life of the mine is expected to be 19 years with approximately 6.2 Mt of 

petalite material at 1.39% Li2O and 2.4 Mt of lepidolite mineralization at 1.41% Li2O mined 

over the length of the Project. 

 



 
 

 10 

1.12 RECOVERY METHODS  
 

The Separation Rapids Lithium Project PEA mineral recovery flowsheet is based on the 

process testwork completed to-date. The process selected for the PEA comprises the mineral 

separation and recovery of a lepidolite concentrate, a petalite concentrate (both containing 

between 4.0% and 4.50% Li2O), and thirdly, a mixed Na/K-feldspar industrial mineral 

product.  

 

This PEA is based on the processing of 475,000 t/y of mineralized material over a 19-year 

mine life to produce approximately 220,000 t of lepidolite concentrate, 1.32 Mt of petalite 

and 1.34 Mt of feldspar. The lepidolite is to be sold into the lithium chemicals industry to 

customers in Canada and Asia, while the petalite will be sold to customers in the 

glass/ceramics industries in Europe, Asia and North America. The feldspar will be sold to 

customers for a range of applications in North America and Europe. 

 

A single milling and flotation circuit is provided for processing both lepidolite/petalite (LPZ) 

mineralization and petalite (PZ) material on a campaign basis. Tailings from the flotation of 

lepidolite ore will be stockpiled for future re-processing to recover petalite. Some of the final 

tailings from the petalite ore flotation process will feed a second, dedicated feldspar flotation 

circuit with the balance of the petalite tailings reporting to the tailings management facility 

(TMF).  

 

A simplified block flow diagram showing the main process steps within the overall 

Separation Rapids flowsheet is presented in Figure 1.2.

Simplified Process Block Flow Diagram 

 

 
 

1.12.1 Process Design Criteria  
 

The process plant design, PEA report and financial evaluation are based on the following 

process design criteria that have been derived from the testwork results: 

• Optical sorting mass waste rejection is 1.8% with lithium losses of also 1.8%. 

• For petalite PZ mineralization, the mass pull to slimes after comminution and 
attritioning is 7.9% of mill feed with an 8.6% lithium loss. For the lepidolite LPZ 

mineralization, mass and lithium losses are 8.4% and 6.5% respectively. 

• Mass pull to magnetics (petalite PZ only) is 13% of sorted mineralized material 
tonnage with lithium losses of 13.8%. 

• The lepidolite concentrates contains 4.5% Li2O% while 50% of the petalite 
concentrate will be 4.5% (with low sodium and potassium levels) and the balance 

being 4.0% for an average life of mine grade of 4.25% Li2O. 

• Lithium recovery to lepidolite concentrate (LPZ) is 78%. Lithium recovery to petalite 
concentrate from lepidolite tailings is 70%. 

• Lithium recovery to petalite concentrate (PZ) is 65.2% of flotation feed content. 

• Mass pull to feldspar concentrate is 82.9% of feldspar flotation feed. 

• Plant availabilities of 90% for the flotation plant although the crushing plant has been 
suitably sized to run on a single 12-hour shift per day. 

 



 
 

 12 

1.13 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

The property is readily accessible with a total road distance from Kenora to the site of 79 km. 

However, development of the project will require upgrading of the 9.5 km long Avalon Road 

to accommodate the mining, concentrate removal and consumable delivery trucks. 

 

The flotation concentrator will be located at the mine site with the various concentrates 

(petalite, lepidolite and feldspar) being dried, bagged and trucked to an existing CN rail 

siding at Redditt for shipping to customers. 

 

The site is predominately bedrock exposure with a minimum of top soil or organic cover. The 

site buildings are anticipated to include crusher and concentrator buildings, change room and 

ablution facilities, office and laboratory, electrical MMCs, maintenance building and 

warehouse. 

 

Fresh water and fire water for the site will be provided from the English River. Water 

treatment facilities will be provided as required to supply potable water to the site. 

 

Approximately 10 MW of (operating) power will be required during operations and this will 

be supplied from the existing 115 kV system running from Caribou Falls to Whitedog Falls. 

A stepdown transformer will be installed at the connection point to the 115-kV line and 

approximately 25 km of transmission line will be installed to bring the power to the mine 

site. 

 

Diesel fuel storage facilities will be provided to supply the mine equipment and smaller site 

vehicles.  A propane tank farm will also be installed to accommodate the site heating and fuel 

for the concentrate driers.  

 

1.14 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
 

This PEA is based on the recovery of lepidolite, petalite and mixed sodium/feldspar (Na/K) 

feldspar concentrates at the following approximate annual rates: 

• Lepidolite   11,800 t/y 

• Petalite  73,000 t/y 

• Na/K feldspar  100,000 t/y 
 

It is anticipated that the lepidolite concentrate will be sold to a new lithium carbonate 

producer in Canada or possibly China, while the petalite will be sold to customers in the 

glass and ceramics industries in North America, Europe and Asia. The feldspar concentrate 

will be sold for applications in glass, ceramics, frits and glazes and fillers in North America 

and Europe. 

 

At this stage of development of the Separation Rapids property, there are no material 

contracts in place. However, in February, 2017, Avalon entered into a non-binding letter of 



 
 

 13 

intent with Lepidico Ltd. (Lepidico) for the supply of up to 15,000 t/y of lepidolite 

concentrate for its demonstration plant planned for Sudbury, ON. 

 

1.15 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR COMMUNITY IMPACT 
 

The Project site lies in an area adjacent to the English River, a regionally significant 

waterbody which supports a variety of wildlife and fisheries as well as tourism. The area 

surrounding the mine site is undeveloped and forested.  

 

1.15.1 Project Approvals and Permitting 
 

A Project Description and comprehensive Environmental Baseline Report of the mine and 

concentrator site was completed in March, 2007, updated from the July, 1999 draft. The 2007 

report included a preliminary environmental impact assessment and, although this was based 

on a different project development model to that presently envisaged, it is expected that the 

vast majority of this study work is still valid.   

 

Avalon has an Advanced Exploration Approval based on an approved closure plan, though it 

is presently in a state of inactivity and is permitted for 15,000 t of material. Exploration 

permits for additional drilling on site were acquired for drill programs in 2016 and 2017. 

There programs were successfully completed without any environmental impacts. The 

present permit allows for nearby future expanded nearby areas of exploration on recently 

acquired claims.   

 

Due to the relatively small scale of the Project and the site being located well away from any 

federally protected areas, and because the capacity of the mine and concentrator are 

approximately half the tonnage triggers in the Federal Environmental Assessment Act 2012, 

permitting under this act does not apply. As such, permitting time lines are significantly 

reduced. 

 

1.15.2 Environmental Baseline 
 

For the mine and concentrator site, an environmental baseline study program has been 

conducted, investigating regional and site-specific aspects such as water quality, hydrology, 

vegetation, wildlife, fisheries, archaeology, and socioeconomics. Plans are in place to further 

update or validate this information in the next project phase, in consultation with all 

communities of interest. 

 

1.15.3 Closure and Rehabilitation 
 

For mines located on previously undisturbed sites, ecological restoration is a fundamental 

component of site reclamation. The main aspects of the closure and reclamation plans for the 

Project include: 

• Flooding of the open pit following the cessation of mining, primarily through inflows 
of groundwater and surface water runoff. 



 
 

 14 

• Closure and rehabilitation of the TMF in a safe and secure manner in full accordance 
with government regulations and good engineering practice. 

• Progressive rehabilitation of benches of the coarse rock aggregate storage areas, 
particularly on the river view sides. 

• Breaching and revegetation of all sediment basins associated with the TMF and the 
mine rock aggregate stockpiles.   

• Removal for reuse, salvage or disposal of all machinery and equipment from the 
crusher, process plant and other ancillary facilities. 

• Responsible removal or demolishing of all buildings and site infrastructure.  

• Maintain the mine access road during the closure and post-closure monitoring period 
to provide access to the site. Following completion of post-closure monitoring, the 

road will be scarified and re-vegetated, and culverts removed. 

 

A 5-year post-closure monitoring program will follow closure of the mine that includes 

maintenance of the revegetated areas. 

 

1.15.4 Community and Indigenous Peoples Engagement 
 

Consultation with local First Nations Bands and the public was initiated during the 1999 

baseline study. This continued in a reduced manner during the period of inactivity but was 

again ramped up in 2013. A memorandum of understanding initially signed with the 

Wabaseemoong Independent Nation (WIN) in 1999 was renewed in 2013.   

 

Avalon maintains an engagement log which records the numerous meetings held and 

summaries of the meeting content, and reports this annually in its Sustainability Report. 

 

An archaeological study was completed in 1998. This will be reviewed with the communities 

of interest and updated, if required. There may be a requirement to complete additional 

traditional knowledge studies in the next phase of project development. A socioeconomic 

assessment of the Project is included in the 2007 environmental study. This will be updated 

in the next phase of the Project.  

 

Avalon has a full time representative in Kenora who facilitates ongoing engagement with 

Indigenous Peoples, communities, regulators and politicians and that contributes to the strong 

support for the Project. 

 

1.16 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
 

1.16.1 Capital Costs 
 

The basis for the PEA capital cost estimate is a processing facility and related infrastructure 

with a nominal throughput rate of 475,000 t/y of mineralized material, comprising either 

petalite mineralized material (PZ) or lepidolite mineralized material (LPZ).  



 
 

 15 

Initial capex requirements are summarized in Table 1.2. All costs are reported as Canadian 

dollars (CAD). It should be noted that, apart from the feldspar flotation plant in Years 5 and 

6, provisions for what might normally be designated as "sustaining capital" are included in 

the operating costs. 

 

The Project is at a green fields location and so will require construction of new tailings and 

waste rock storage facilities as well as an up-grade to an existing access road and the 

installation of an electrical power supply line. 

 

The capex for the open-pit mine is assumed to be zero as the operation will engage a contract 

miner and all mining capex will be built into the contract mining operating costs. 

 

The concept of having most of the plant pre-assembled off-site and delivered in modules 

(fully or partly assembled) has been assumed for much of the equipment (particularly the 

flotation plant) and facilities in order to reduce on-site construction activities.

1.18 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 

Micon has prepared this assessment of the Project on the basis of a discounted cash flow 

model, from which Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), payback and 

other measures of project viability can be determined. Assessments of NPV are generally 

accepted within the mining industry as representing the economic value of a project after 

allowing for the cost of capital invested.

Sensitivity analyses on product prices, recoveries, capital costs and operating costs suggest 

that the Project is most sensitive to revenue drivers, namely price and recovery which are 

essentially identical. At a discount rate of 8%, the Project NPV is negative when all product 

prices are reduced by 20%. The Project is also quite sensitive to changes in operating cost 

while sensitivity to capex is relatively low. Project NPV remains positive for adverse changes 

of up to 20% in either capital or operating costs.

1.19 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 

Although the SRLD is reported to be the largest rare metal pegmatite of the petalite sub-type 

discovered in Ontario, there are a large number of other rare metal pegmatite occurrences 

within a few kilometres of the Separation Rapids property. The principal occurrences are the 

Big Mack Pegmatite, the Southwestern Pegmatite Subgroup which includes the SRLD, Great 

White North and the Swamp pegmatites, and the Eastern Pegmatite Subgroup which includes 

Marko's Pegmatite, Lou's Pegmatite and others. 

 

1.20 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

The PEA suggests that the Separation Rapids Project can be developed as an economically 

viable supplier of the lithium minerals petalite and lepidolite into the ceramics and lithium 

chemical industries for almost 20 years. Production of a third, feldspar concentrate further 

enhances the Project economics by supplying product into various industrial mineral markets. 

 

The initial capital estimate for the Project is CAD77.7 million with a further CAD10 million 

required for initial working capital. The addition of the feldspar recovery circuit in Years 5/6 

(or potentially sooner if funding is available) requires an additional CAD13.7 million. 

 

Capital costs have been reduced by treating the 2 different types of lithium mineralization on 

a campaign basis rather than having 2 parallel processing plants. 

 

The Project is relatively small and low in capex for a mining project, but the economic 

performance estimated by this report indicates a post-tax IRR of 22.7% and an NPV of 

CAD102 million. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the Project is most sensitive to revenue 

drivers, namely price and recovery (identical), and also quite sensitive to changes in 

operating cost while sensitivity to capex is relatively low.  

 

The Project will provide over 70 full time employment opportunities, as well as a number of 

additional opportunities for local industries to grow through the provision of support 

services. 

 

Consideration has been given in the design to the number and nature of the chemicals used in 

the flotation process and how best to minimise their consumption through recovery and 

recycling, as well as via water treatment to remove dissolved metals. 

 

The site layout takes into account the various waste streams produced by the processes with 

all being relatively inert and free from toxic materials and sulphides. Flotation tailings are 

filtered and washed before being dry-stacked so as not to present a source of future ground 

and run-off water contamination. 

 

Market demand for the lithium mineral products is increasing as more and more lithium is 

required for the expanding battery and energy storage industries and this is resulting in a 

squeeze on supply into the ceramics industry. In addition to a non-binding letter of intent for 



 
 

 20 

the lepidolite concentrate from a Canadian based customer, Avalon has identified a number 

of potential markets for the feldspar and is also in discussions with four potential major 

petalite customers.  

 

The Project enjoys strong support from the community as well as from local politicians, First 

Nations and environmental NGOs. Avalon is also in discussions with a number of local 

businesses towards collaboration on future opportunities including contractor mining, power 

supply, local fabrication and product transportation. 

 

The start of operations is not anticipated to be subject to approvals under the Canadian 

Environmental Assessment Act 2012 (CEAA) as the mine does not exceed any of the CEAA 

triggers including mine and mill tonnages. The Project will not have any new impacts to fish 

or fish habitat, nor will it impact on any Federal Wildlife Areas or Migratory Bird 

Sanctuaries. Final Permitting and Approval for the Project is therefore expected to be 

relatively short and simple. 

 

1.21 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

The preliminary economic assessment presents a potentially viable project and the 

opportunity to generate significant revenue for Avalon. It is recommended therefore that the 

Project continues to the next stage of development, which is the completion of a full 

Feasibility Study (FS).   

 

1.21.1 Recommendations for the Next Phase of Project Development 
 

The next step in developing the Project is the completion of a full economic and technical FS 

in order to confirm these initial findings and to help source the necessary capital required for 

project implementation.  

 

In order to maintain the proposed production levels and mine life, additional measured and 

indicated resources are required for an FS. It is probable that this requirement can largely be 

achieved by up-grading the inferred material through further, in-fill drilling and by mining 

deeper. Additional exploration drilling is also recommended in order to evaluate the potential 

for further, new near surface material in order to potentially reduce waste quantities and 

reduce mining costs.  

 

The FS will require a more detailed mine plan and mining contract proposal based upon the 

revised mineral resource resulting from the above recommended work. A trade-off study for 

open pit vs. underground mining should also be conducted to determine if underground 

mining can be made economically viable and at what depth.  

 

Further "mini-pilot" flotation work is recommended to confirm petalite recovery figures from 

the lepidolite mineralization and to better define the composition of the feldspar product from 

this material. 

 



 
 

 21 

Additional reagent recovery and water treatment investigations are also proposed in order to 

maximise recycling potential and to confirm the quality of the recycled water. 

 

The modular, pre-assembled/containerized package concept assumed in the PEA should be 

carried forward into the FS although a trade-off study may be warranted just to confirm and 

quantify the economic benefits of such an approach. 

 

The validation and update of the 2007 baseline data is required and anticipated to be 

completed in the near future. Additional drilling to further develop and finalize the site 

hydrology and groundwater management plan is needed. Based on the results of the ongoing 

humidity cell and other test work on the anticipated waste materials and the plant and site 

water balance, a final design of the water management facilities is required. In consultation 

with regulators and other stakeholders, limited ongoing monitoring for surface and 

groundwater quality and quantity is recommended. 

 

Based on the above and this PEA, a Certified Closure Plan is required for submission to the 

Ontario Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines (MNDM). 

 

In order to expedite the permitting process, the recommended trade off study and feasibility 

level design for the TMF containment structures should be initiated for the Environmental 

Compliance Approval (ECA) permit applications for these structures. The route for the 

power line must be finalized and obtaining all required information for permitting should be 

initiated in consultation with Ministry Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF). Similarly, 

detailed engineering for the air and water emissions equipment are required to initiate the 

Provincial Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) air and water ECAs.

2.0 INTRODUCTION 
 

Micon International Limited (Micon) has been retained by Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. 

(Avalon) to prepare a Technical Report under Canadian National Instrument (NI) 43-101, 

which discloses the results of an updated preliminary economic assessment (PEA) for the 

Separation Rapids Lithium Project, located 70 km north of Kenora, Ontario. 

 

The deposit was originally evaluated in 1999-2000 as a potential source of the lithium 

mineral, petalite, for glass-ceramics applications. Recent work by Avalon has looked at other 

minerals within the deposit as well as petalite, most notably lepidolite and feldspar, and 

developed processes for producing marketable concentrates for all three products. 

 

The objective of this PEA is to demonstrate the economic potential of a revised production 

schedule which includes sales of all three flotation concentrate products (petalite, lepidolite 

and feldspar) only. This study excludes conversion of petalite to lithium hydroxide for use in 

the production of Lithium Ion Batteries. The PEA is based on processing 475,000 tonnes of 

mineralized material per year to produce approximately 1.3 million tonnes (Mt) of petalite, 

220,000 t of lepidolite and 1.34 Mt of feldspar over a 20-year total operating life.  

 

2.1 PHASED APPROACH TO PROJECT DEVELOPMENT 
 

Avalon is proposing a phased development program for the Project starting with the 

development of the mine, and a flotation concentrator for petalite and lepidolite production. 

A feldspar recovery circuit will be added in operating Year 5.  

 

In Phase 2 (which is not part of this PEA and is subject to market demand and financing) 

Avalon plans to develop a lithium hydroxide demonstration plant, followed in Phase 3 by a 

full-scale lithium hydroxide plant. 

  

2.2 TERMS OF REFERENCE 
 

2.2.1 Preliminary Economic Assessment 
 

This PEA has been prepared by Micon under the terms of its agreement with Avalon. As 

discussed in the relevant sections of the report, Micon has prepared a mine plan and schedule 

and has prepared an economic analysis of the Project. Micon has reviewed the metallurgical 

testwork and the mineral processing flowsheet, the infrastructure requirements, and the 

capital and operating cost estimates prepared by Avalon and its retained consultants.  

 

2.2.2 Mineral Resource Estimate 
 

The PEA is based on updated mineral resource estimates for lithium and feldspar contained 

in the Separation Rapids Lithium Deposit (SRLD), prepared by Avalon dated 23 May, 2018. 

This updated estimate is considered not significantly different from the previous independent 

one reported in a NI 43-101 Technical Report dated 10 November, 2016. 



 
 

 24 

The mineral resource estimates in this PEA have been prepared in accordance with the 

requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ from the requirements of United 

States securities laws. Unless otherwise indicated, all mineral resource estimates included in 

this PEA have been prepared following CIM Definition Standards in accordance with NI 43-

101. The NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which 

establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical 

information concerning mineral projects. No reserves have been determined. 

 

Canadian standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the 

United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and reserve and resource 

information contained in this Technical Report may not be comparable to similar information 

disclosed by United States companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the 

foregoing, the term "resource" does not equate to the term "reserve". Under the SEC 

standards, mineralization may not be classified as a "reserve" unless the determination has 

been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at 

the time the reserve determination is made. The SEC's disclosure standards normally do not 

permit the inclusion of information concerning "measured mineral resources", "indicated 

mineral resources" or "inferred mineral resources" or other descriptions of the amount of 

mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute "reserves" by United States 

standards in documents filed with the SEC. United States investors should also understand 

that "inferred mineral resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and 

as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an 

"inferred mineral resource" exists, is economically or legally mineable, or will ever be 

upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimated "inferred mineral resources" 

may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies. Disclosure of the amount of 

minerals contained in a resource estimate is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; 

however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not 

constitute "reserves" by SEC standards as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to 

unit measures. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of "reserves" are also not the 

same as those of the SEC, and reserves reported by Avalon in compliance with NI 43-101 

may not qualify as "reserves" under SEC standards. Accordingly, information concerning 

mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by 

companies that report in accordance with United States standards. 

 

2.2.3 Relationship with Avalon 
 

Micon does not have, and has not previously had, any material interest in Avalon or any 

related entities. The relationship between Micon and Avalon is solely a professional 

association between the client and the independent consultant. This report is prepared in 

return for fees based upon agreed commercial rates and the payment of these fees is in no 

way contingent on the results of this report.  

 

The conclusions and recommendations in this report reflect the authors' best independent 

judgment in light of the information available to them at the time of writing. The authors and 

Micon reserve the right, but will not be obliged, to revise this report and conclusions if 



 
 

 25 

additional information becomes known to them subsequent to the date of this report. Use of 

this report acknowledges acceptance of the foregoing conditions. 

 

This report is intended to be used by Avalon subject to the terms and conditions of its 

agreement with Micon. That agreement permits Avalon to file this report as a Technical 

Report with the Canadian Securities Administrators pursuant to provincial securities 

legislation. Except for the purposes legislated under provincial securities laws, any other use 

of this report, by any third party, is at that party's sole risk. 

 

The requirements of electronic document filing on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) necessitate the 

submission of this report as an unlocked, editable PDF (portable document format) file. 

Micon accepts no responsibility for any changes made to the file after it leaves its control.

The total area covered by the claims and the lease is 2,869 ha (7,091 acres). 

 

Avalon entered into an option agreement with Robert Fairservice and James Willis, the 

owners of claims over the mineral deposit, on 18 October 1996, which was a four-year option 

from the above-named beneficial owners. Avalon completed all work and payment 

requirements of this option agreement and vested a 100% interest in the property in October, 

1999. The title was transferred by the Government of Ontario from the owners to Avalon in 

November, 1999. Originally, the property was subject to a 2% net smelter royalty (NSR) 

retained by the vendors. This NSR was acquired on 23 February 2012 by a wholly-owned 

subsidiary of Avalon, 8110131 Canada Inc., for $220,000.

4.3 ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES 
 

Other than minor and largely funded reclamation requirements under the Advanced 

Exploration Permit, there are no known environmental liabilities associated with the 

Separation Rapids property. 

 

4.4 RAIL ACCESS 
 

As there is no rail access to the mine/concentrator site, delivery of reagents to, and shipment 

of concentrates from the site will be by truck. However, a rail loading trans-shipment facility 

will be required in order to access rail transportation for product shipment and some inbound 

supplies. This loading site trans-shipment facility is planned to be located on the CNR line in 

the vicinity of Redditt, Ontario, approximately 55 km by road from the Separation Rapids 

site.

5.0 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

 

5.1 ACCESSIBILITY 
 

The Separation Rapids property is readily accessible from Kenora by traveling 27 km north 

on Highway 658, an all-weather road, to the English River Road, 2 km south of the 

community of Redditt. Then a further 37 km on the English River Road to the Sand Lake 

Road, and west on the Sand Lake Road for 5.5 km to East Tourist Lake Road (ETL Road, 

also known as the Avalon Road), a former forestry access road (marked with a "Road to 

Avalon" sign). The Project site is located approximately 9.5 km north on the ETL Road or 

Avalon Road. The total distance from Kenora to the site is 79 km. 

 

The main line of the CNR passes through the village of Redditt, 33 km south-southeast of the 

property and 52 km by road (see Figure 4.1). The CPR lines pass through the City of Kenora. 

 

The property is located within the Traditional Land Use Area of the Wabaseemoong 

Independent Nations (WIN). The larger community of WIN is Whitedog, Ontario, an 

Aboriginal community located approximately 31 km southwest of the property. The Swan 

Lake and One Man Lake reserves, also part of WIN are within approximately 35 km of the 

property as shown in Figure 4.1. 

 

In 1999, Avalon constructed the access road. Over the period from 2011 to 2015, almost 

every year some work was completed relating to maintenance and access to the site. In 2011, 

new hazard awareness barricades were installed around the existing excavation and warning 

signs were installed in designated locations. In 2012, there was no notable site work 

conducted other than site visits for general site inspection. In 2015, Avalon entered into an 

Access and Maintenance Agreement (AMA) with the Ministry of Natural Resources and 

Forestry (MNRF) and obtained a Work Permit to conduct road repairs. The 1999 site access 

road was subsequently repaired with the installation of new culverts at the water crossings, 

allowing access to site with vehicles, rather than just by all-terrain vehicles. Additional 

signage was installed in accordance with the AMA and a new, more secure barrier was 

installed around the existing excavation.  

 

Avalon's existing quarry permit areas, located along the access road, were reflagged and new 

signage installed to ensure compliance with regulations. In 2016, no significant site work was 

done, other than monitoring road conditions and ensuring hazard awareness signs and 

barricades remain intact and effective.  

 

Avalon recently (2016) purchased the Nelson Granite aggregate quarry in order to secure 

access rights along the entire access road, as well as to secure a nearby potential source of 

aggregate if required for road maintenance.

5.2 PHYSIOGRAPHY 
 

The Separation Rapids area is typical of much of northwestern Ontario and the Canadian 

Shield. The property is relatively flat with an elevation of approximately 350 masl. Local 

topographic relief is limited to 50 m or less in typical Precambrian glaciated terrain and is 

mantled by low swamp or muskeg areas. In the low-lying areas, often underlain by 

recessively weathered amphibolite, there is a thin veneer of glacial till, whereas the higher 

areas are occupied by scoured outcrop of granite or pegmatite. The English River system is 

proximal to all claim groups. 

 

Outcrop exposure is in general less than 40% in the Project area, but the area containing the 

SRLD has been stripped of ground cover where practicable or trenched. The remainder of the 

property is covered by thin glacial regolith and poorly developed soils, local swamps, 

muskeg, river bottom sediments and varied clays. 

 

5.3 VEGETATION 
 

The Separation Rapids area falls within the Boreal Hardwood Transition or Mixed Boreal 

Forest. The Project area is covered by boreal forest with the dominant species being Jackpine 

and Black Spruce. Willow shrubs and grasses dominate the low marshy areas and shoreline 

of the English River. Land adjacent to and within the sphere of influence of the Separation 

Rapids property is covered by an extensive area of blowdown caused by a wind storm around 

2008. As a result of this, the surrounding forest is comprised of non-merchantable timber. 

 

A Species at Risk Act assessment was completed, and no endangered or at-risk species were 

identified in the area of the proposed Project. Details of the flora and fauna within the 

Separation Rapids area are provided in Section 20.0. 

 

5.4 CLIMATE 
 

The climate is typical of Canada's mid-latitudes. Winters are cold and long, stretching from 

late-October to mid-May with extremes in winter of below -40°C without the wind chill 

factor. The daily average temperature is below 0°C from November to March and the daily 

minimum is below 0°C from November to April (see Table 5.1 and Figure 5.1). The spring-

summer-fall periods are comparatively short and summer temperatures are typically warm.

5.5 LOCAL RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE 
 

The development of the Separation Rapids Project is expected to have a positive impact on 

unemployment in the Kenora, Redditt and the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations ("WIN") 

communities. The First Nations Community of Whitedog a probable source of mine 

personnel, is located approximately 30 km west of the property and is accessed via the Sand 

Lake Road and Highway 525 from Minaki. 

 

Water for the mineral processing facility and other needs is available in abundance in the 

Project area. The closest hydroelectric power generating station is located at Whitedog Falls 

although there is also a larger generating station further north at Caribou Falls, which runs a 

transmission line south to join up with the Whitedog Falls facility. Hydro One then runs an 

existing 115 kV transmission line from Whitedog Falls to Kenora. Discussions with Hydro 

One have confirmed that there is sufficient power available from Caribou Falls to meet the 

requirements for the Project.  

 

Further details on infrastructure requirements are provided in Section 18.0. 

 

The closest centre with significant services is Kenora. Forestry, tourism and mining are the 

three largest sectors of the Kenora economy. During the summer, tourism can almost double 

the population of the area. 

 

The Lake of the Woods District Hospital is located in Kenora. Education is provided by 

seven elementary schools, two high schools, Confederation College, a post-graduate 

institution, and Seven Generations Education Institute 

 

Kenora is served by CP Rail and Bearskin Airlines. VIA Rail passes through Redditt, a small 

community with a population of approximately 150 people located on the CN Rail main line.

6.0 HISTORY 
 

Prior to the discovery of rare-metal pegmatite occurrences, exploration in the Separation 

Rapids region focused on base and precious metal mineralization. Rare-element 

mineralization in the area was first encountered along the English River, near Separation 

Rapids, by Stockwell in 1932 (Breaks and Tindle, 2001). The petalite-bearing SRLD which 

forms a prominent hill on the south shore of MacDonald's Bay on the English River, and an 

associated group of rare-metal pegmatites, were discovered by Dr. Fred Breaks of the 

Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) as a result of a detailed study of rare-metal pegmatites in 

the region between 1994 and 1996. Dr. Breaks and the OGS recognized the importance of the 

SRLD and public disclosure of the discovery was made in July, 1996 in an OGS special 

release (Breaks and Tindle, 1996). 

 

It should be noted that the SRLD may be referred to in the geological literature and in earlier 

reports on the property as the Big Whopper Pegmatite or BWP. 

 

The Superior Province of Ontario represents a vast terrain that contains numerous rare-

element (Li, Cs, Rb, Ti, Be, Sn, Ta, Nb, Ga and Ge) mineral occurrences, many of which 

were found during the lithium exploration rush of the 1950s (Mulligan, 1965, cited in Breaks 

and Tindle, 2001). Mineral exploration for the rare elements in subsequent years, however, 

was essentially desultory. In 1993, Breaks and Tindle commenced a comprehensive study of 

rare-element mineralization in northwestern Ontario intended to provide a modern 

mineralogical, chemical and geochronological database and designed, in part, to encourage 

mineral exploration. The authors recognized that rare-element class pegmatites of the 

complex-type (petalite-subtype) are widespread in the Separation Rapids area. Such 

pegmatites are uncommon and comprise only 2% of lithium-rich pegmatites on a global basis 

(Černý and Ercit, 1989). Break's work in the area culminated in the 1996 discovery of the 

SRLD pegmatite (Breaks and Tindle, 1996, 1997). 

 

Subsequent to the discovery and staking of the SRLD, the area has experienced a significant 

increase in exploration interest for ceramic grade petalite, tantalum and cesium. The principal 

exploration companies include Avalon, Champion Bear Resources Ltd., Tantalum Mining 

Corporation of Canada Ltd. (Tanco), Gossan Resources Ltd. and Emerald Fields Resource 

Corporation (now Pacific Iron Ore Corporation). 

 

Exploration on the SRLD in the late-1990s was accompanied by a scoping level 

metallurgical study by Lakefield Research Limited and a marketing study by Equapolar 

Resource Consultants (Pearse, 1998) on the principal mineral commodities to develop. A 

flowsheet for processing the mineralized material was developed and the size and value of 

the markets for the principal mineral commodities, petalite and feldspar was identified. 

Avalon's senior geologist, Mr. Chris Pedersen, geologically mapped the major portion of the 

cleared outcropping SRLD on the property at a scale of 1:100.  

  

Since 2014, Avalon has not only investigated market opportunities for petalite in the glass 

and ceramics industries, it has also developed processes for recovering concentrates of 



 
 

 39 

lepidolite and feldspars as well as a process for converting petalite into lithium carbonate and 

hydroxide. 

 

Additional exploration and drilling programs have also been completed by Avalon in 2017 

and 2018 and are described in Sections 9.0 and 10.0.

7.0 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
 

7.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The Late Archean-aged SRLD belongs to the petalite sub-type of the complex-type class of 

rare-metal pegmatites (Černy and Ercit, 2005). The complex-type pegmatites are 

geochemically the most highly evolved in the spectrum of granitic pegmatites and petalite-

bearing pegmatites comprise only 2% of the known complex-type pegmatites. 

 

The SRLD exhibits some significant differences from the norm in its structural setting, 

preservation of magmatic zonation and overall crystal size. Unlike the Tanco and Bikita 

deposits (owned by Cabot Corporation and Bikita Minerals Ltd., respectively), which are 

shallowly dipping, undeformed zoned intrusions, and the Greenbushes deposit (Talison 

Lithium), which is an approximately 45°dipping, zoned and locally mylonitized pegmatite, 

the SRLD dips subvertically, is complexly folded, strongly foliated and locally mylonitized. 

 

The SRLD exhibits zoning characteristics seen in other highly evolved rare-metal pegmatites, 

i.e., well-developed wall zones with exo-contact and endo-contact borders and a petalite-rich 

intermediate zone. However, within the SRLD a significant portion of these zones and zonal 

features has been tectonically modified. In addition, all three recently producing rare-metal 

pegmatite deposits (Tanco, Bikita, Greenbushes) contain exceptionally large crystals of 

spodumene, petalite and feldspars which permit selective mining; at Bikita and Tanco 

petalite crystals and pseudomorphs are reported to be as large as 2 to 2.5 m in size. The 

megacrystic zones in the SRP, on the other hand, contain crystals no larger than 10 to 15 cm.  

 

7.2 REGIONAL GEOLOGY 
 

The SRLD, its parent granite, the Separation Rapids Pluton, and associated rare-metal 

pegmatites occur within the Archean Separation Lake Metavolcanic Belt (SLMB) which 

forms the boundary between the English River subprovince to the north and the Winnipeg 

River subprovince to the south. Both subprovinces are part of the larger Archean Superior 

Province of the Canadian Shield. Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2 provide the location and a 

simplified district geological map of part of Avalon's lease, 108395 (Paterson Lake 

CLM469).  

 

The SLMB is thought to represent the easterly extension of the Bird River metavolcanic-

metasedimentary belt in Manitoba which contains the Tanco, Bernic Lake, Rush Lake and 

Greer Lake pegmatites, all of which are part of the Winnipeg River-Cat Lake pegmatite field. 

To date, this belt and pegmatite field combined contain the highest concentration of fertile 

peraluminous granites and rare-metal pegmatite mineralization in the Superior Province, and 

the greatest number of complex-type, petalite-subtype pegmatite occurrences in Canada 

(Breaks and Tindle, 1998).

Location of the Separation Rapids Lithium Deposit 

 

 
Note: The locations of detailed geology maps, Figure 7.3 and Figure 7.4, are indicated by the boxes.  

Micon, 2016. 

 

The currently exposed and mapped areas of the SRLD and associated rare-metal pegmatites 

occur within an approximately 600 m wide package of predominantly mafic metavolcanic 

rocks that have been variably deformed and metamorphosed to lower and middle amphibolite 

facies. This package is bounded to the north by the Separation Rapids Pluton and to the south 

by pegmatitic granites of the Winnipeg River subprovince, as shown in Figure 7.2, the 

reproduction of an early map by Breaks and Tindle (1998). 

 

The SRLD and its associated dykes fall within the southwestern subgroup of the SRP group 

(Breaks and Tindle, 1998) and are located south and west of the English River. The eastern 

subgroup occurs to the north and east of the English River and contains a number of rare-

metal pegmatites, including Marko's pegmatite approximately 5 km east of the SRLD.

7.3 PROPERTY GEOLOGY 
 

Avalon has mapped seven distinct lithological units adjacent to and within the SRLD as 

described in Table 7.1, below.  

 

The Separation Rapids area is underlain predominantly by a mafic metavolcanic sequence 

(amphibolite or Avalon's Unit 1), consisting of flows, tuffs, subordinate epiclastic 

metasediments and rare iron formation horizons and rhyolites. Locally, on the Avalon 

property itself, the metavolcanic sequence is restricted to amphibolite (Pedersen, 2016a).  

 

Figure 7.3 is a generalized geology map of the SRLD. The black outline on Figure 7.1 

denotes location of this figure. 

 

There has been confusion over the naming of various pegmatitic bodies in the Separation 

Rapids area over the years due to the informal nature of many of the deposit names utilized. 

The SRLD, as referred to by Avalon and as described in this report, extends for some 

1,150 m in outcrops and various parts have had names applied to them over the years.

1 Amphibolite Separation Lake 

Metavolcanic Belt 

Dark green-grey, typically fine-grained but locally coarser gabbroic. Strongly foliated and 

folded. Local preservation of pillow flows. Li and Cs metasomatic alteration adjacent to SRP 

dykes produces holmquistite (blue-violet acicular Li-bearing amphibole) and glimmerite (black-

brown Cs-rich phlogopite). 

2 Pegmatitic granite Winnipeg River 

Batholith 

Medium-grained to locally megacrystic, massive to poorly foliated, with potassium feldspar 

predominant, and quartz and albite subordinate. Recent reinterpretation of lithologies mapped as 

Unit 2, on the south side of the SRP, indicate that they might be part of the SRP's petalite-

bearing feldspathic zone (Pedersen, personal communication). 

3a and 3b Albitite SRLD albite-rich wall

bearing pegmatitic 

subunits 

Together, 3a and 3b constitute approximately 25% of the feldspathic units in the SRP. Zones 

from several cm to 15 m wide and to a maximum length of 120 m. Subunit 3a albitite is 

generally grey-white to light pink. Fine- to medium-grained, equigranular to seriate textures and 

locally exhibit pronounced magmatic banding (albite-rich versus potassium feldspar-rich layers, 

with the former predominating). Aplitic albite is the most common constituent. The abundance 

of albite and the albite: potassium feldspar is highly variable. Subunit 3b dykes are typically 

mottled grey, heterogeneous, medium grained to megacrystic albite potassium feldspar rock with 

light pink-orange potassium feldspar megacrysts in a finer-grained albitic groundmass. The total 

feldspar content of Subunit 3b is typically greater than 80%., but the ratios of potassium feldspar 

to albite is heterogeneous.

Generalized Geology – Separation Rapids Lithium Deposit 

 

 
Note: The grid is the original project grid and "camp" refers to original exploration camp. 

Micon, 1999. 

 

The drill tested portion is about 1,100 m in strike length, of which about 300 m is 

considerably thicker and thus contains the bulk of the presently defined mineral resource. 

The further continuation of the pegmatite 450 m to the west is thinner and has a few shallow 

drill holes. This thin portion, drilled in the past, has been informally referred to as Bob's 

Pegmatite. 

 

There is yet further extension of the thinner pegmatite in sparse outcrops to the west for 

approximately 400 m, referred to normally as the "Western Pegmatite" or, rarely, as the 

"West Pegmatite". See Figure 7.2. (Breaks and Tindle, 1998; Micon, 1999). This 400 m 

extension has been drill tested in 2018. 

 

Bob's Pegmatite and the West or Western Pegmatite are all part of what Breaks and Tindle 

called the Southwestern Pegmatite Sub-Group to distinguish it from the "Big Whopper" 

sensu stricto, where the term Big Whopper was used by Breaks and Tindle, and others, 

originally to refer to the main known portion of the SRLD. Breaks and Tindle's 

Southwestern Pegmatite Sub-Group though, appears to include some unnamed pegmatites as 

well as the Western and Bob's Pegmatites. 

 

For reference, Table 7.2 sets out the various names for the known pegmatite deposits in terms 

of their grid and UTM locations using the extent to the west and east of each portion of the 

pegmatite that comprises the SRLD.

In the northern part of the property, the mafic metavolcanic sequence is intruded by granite, 

pegmatitic granite and pegmatite dykes associated with the Separation Rapids Pluton, and in 

the southern part of the property by pegmatitic granite and related dykes of the Winnipeg 

River batholith. The amphibolite of the mafic metavolcanic sequence and the Winnipeg 

River granite (Unit 2) are the host lithologies to the SRLD. 

 

As mapped by Avalon, see Figure 7.4 and Figure 7.5, the thickest part of the SRLD, 

historically referred to as the Big Whopper Pegmatite, forms a large lens-shaped body 

approximately 300 m long and approximately 70 m at its widest part.  

 

The SRLD narrows to less than 20 m at both its eastern and western ends and extends along 

strike in both directions for at least 300 m in the form of relatively narrow tails up to 10 to 15 

m wide. Smaller, subparallel, 1 m to 10 m wide, petalite-bearing pegmatite bodies 

predominantly occur to the northeast, north and northwest of the main SRLD body, with 

minor occurrences on the southern flank. 

 

The narrower west-southwest-striking zone of petalite pegmatites extends from the main 

SRLD for a distance of approximately 750 m to the west and is exposed in four outcrops, 

namely the Great White North, Bob's, Swamp and West pegmatites, see Figure 7.5. 

 

Avalon has further subdivided the SRLD into three sub-zones, namely the SRP, Western 

Pegmatite and Eastern Swarm. Based on lithological, mineralogical and textural variations, 

the SRP itself has been subdivided into five distinct lithological units and subunits, 3a, 3b, 4, 

5 and 6, as shown in Table 7.1 above, that outcrop as irregular dykes and larger irregular to 

elliptical bodies intruding the amphibolite and granites. 

 

Within the SRP, Unit 1 amphibolite occurs as narrow, discontinuous screens with strike 

lengths ranging from tens of metres up to greater than 100 m and widths of predominantly 

less than 1 m.

Separation Rapids Lithium Deposit, Extension of the Main Pegmatite Body 

 

 
Note: 1. Names of deposits are historical, see Table 7.2; 2. Grid reference 1000W in original map is incorrect and 

should be 1200W; 3. (Micon, 1999). 

 

These screens are preferentially, but not exclusively, concentrated near the north and south 

margins of the main pegmatite body. Core drilling has confirmed their down-dip continuity 

and surface mapping shows that they are also locally isoclinally folded with the pegmatite. 

Outside of the SRP, recessively-weathering amphibolite forms depressions and valleys 

adjacent to resistant ridges of granite and pegmatite. 

 

Avalon reports that classification of the Winnipeg River pegmatitic granite (Unit 2) as a 

separate unit is based on its occurrence south of the SRP and the boundary fault between the 

Winnipeg River and Separation Rapids intrusive suites, and its distinct primary mineralogy 

(potassium feldspar, biotite, quartz, almandine). 

 

7.3.1 Pegmatite Units 
 

7.3.1.1 Unit 3: Albitite 
 

The main SRLD is flanked by a swarm of narrower petalite-bearing, highly feldspathic 

pegmatites, albitite and albite-potassium feldspar zones, subunits, 3a and 3b. These two 

subunits make up a significant portion of the northwestern part of the SRLD (Albitite Wall 

Zone in Figure 7.3). Subunit 3a occurs as discrete, strongly foliated aplitic zones proximal to 

the SRLD and internally as endocontact border zones proximal to the amphibolite. Subunit 

3b occurs as medium-grained, potassium feldspar-rich megacrystic dykes, which are 



 
 

 48 

somewhat similar to the Subunit 3a dykes and also occur within the same portions of the 

northwestern SRLD. 

 

7.3.1.2 Unit 4: Megacrystic Potassium Feldspar Quartz Sub-zone 
 

The potassium feldspar-rich zone lithology that constitutes Unit 4 is confined, on surface, to 

the northwestern and southwestern peripheral zones and two narrow, 20 m to 30 m long 

zones on the southern margin of the main zone, as shown in Figure 7.4. However, core 

drilling shows that this unit is more extensive at depth, and overall constitutes approximately 

27% of the feldspathic units in the SRLD and forms the major portion of what Avalon has 

called the "Flame Structure". This unit resembles Unit 7 but is reported to be distinct from it 

in having a lower potassium feldspar to albite ratio. The unit typically is strongly foliated to 

semi-massive, with elongate rounded, sub-lenticular, corroded and rotated potassium feldspar 

megacrysts in a fine-grained albite-potassium feldspar-mica-quartz ground mass. Avalon 

reports that Unit 4 has similar grain-size distribution to Subunit 3b and is texturally similar to 

Unit 6b but lacks petalite. 

 

7.3.1.3 Unit 5: Quartz-Mica Sub-zone 
 

As mapped by Avalon, Unit 5 occurs as irregular zones commonly associated and 

interbanded with Unit 4 in the northern and northwestern zone peripheral to the main SRLD. 

The Unit 5 zones tend to be less than 20 m in length (except for one larger, 60-m long zone 

on the northwestern flank) (see Figure 7.4). At depth, Unit 5 is intersected in drill core, on 

sections 250 W, 300 W and in sections 450 W 500 W and 550 W in the "Flame Structure". In 

total, Unit 5 constitutes 17% of the feldspathic units in the SRLD. See Figure 7.3, Figure 7.4 

and Figure 7.5 for project grid locations. 

 

Unit 5 is a poorly foliated to semi-massive, commonly bi-minerallic, medium- to coarse-

grained quartz-rich lithology, estimated to contain an average of 50% dark grey, glassy 

quartz mixed with blebs, patches and stringers of medium- to coarse-grained dark silvery 

green mica. Avalon reports that the elevated Li2O and Rb2O values in Unit 5 are attributable 

to lithian micas as this unit contains no obvious petalite. 

 

7.3.1.4 Unit 6: Petalite-bearing Pegmatite Zone 
 

Within the intermediate zone of the SRP the predominant lithology is the petalite-bearing 

Unit 6 (see Figure 7.3, Figure 7.4 and Table 7.3). Avalon has subdivided this unit into four 

textural and compositional sub units. 

 



 
 

 49 

Table 7.3  

Subunits of Unit 6: Petalite Pegmatite 

 

Subunit Rock type 

Subunit 6a Pegmatite: petalite – albite – potassium feldspar – quartz 

Subunit 6b Pegmatite: petalite – quartz – albite – potassium feldspar – mica 

Subunit 6c Pegmatite: petalite – quartz – albite – mica – potassium feldspar 

Subunit 6d Pegmatite: petalite – lepidolite (Li/Rb-rich mica)-albite-potassium feldspar 

 

Subunits 6a, 6b and 6c form the bulk of the petalite pegmatite. 

 

Subunit 6a: Petalite-potassium feldspar-albite-quartz. This unit is characterized by an 

intense to protomylonitic foliation containing elongate lenses and layers (schlieren) and 

ribbon-like white petalite that give this subunit a streaked appearance. The schlieren 

themselves consist of coarse-grained and megacrystic, white web-textured, petalite, and 

coarse-grained potassium feldspar megacrysts all enveloped by silver-green lithian mica and 

a ground mass of fine-grained albite and quartz. 

 

Subunit 6b: The characteristic features of Subunit 6b, the petalite-albite-potassium feldspar-

mica zone, are strong to locally protomylonitic foliation, megacrystic to glomeroporphyritic 

textures, absence of schlieren, and the occurrence of pink petalite that shows an eastwards 

transition into blue-grey to blue-pink lenticular petalite. 

 

Subunit 6c: Petalite-albite-mica-potassium feldspar. This is the most deformed subunit and 

is characterized by fine to medium-grained petalite and feldspar, in finely-banded mylonitic 

layers that locally anastomose around lenses of less-deformed coarse-grained petalite and 

feldspar. It is essentially a mylonitized version of Subunit 6b. 

 

Subunit 6d: Contains significant proportions of petalite and between 10% to 25% lepidolite, 

a lithium- and rubidium-rich mica. This lepidolite-rich petalite and albite-petalite pegmatite 

phase occurs in a series of west-northwest striking, folded and interfingered dykes along the 

northern and eastern flank of the main SRLD petalite zone. It also occurs as a series of lenses 

and subparallel zones occurring to the northeast of the main SRLD petalite zone and 

connected to the aforementioned series, as a small zone to the northwest of the main SRLD, 

and as subordinate narrow dykes along the southern margin of the SRLD (Figure 7.3). 

Subunit 6d is also found proximal to amphibolite screens as continuous narrow vertical 

zones, showing an eastward increase in thickness of the zones and lepidolite content. 

 

Avalon has also recognized a crude north-to-south lateral zonation in petalite character from 

white ribbon-like petalite, seen in Subunit 6a, grading into coarse-grained pink and white 

petalite, seen in Subunit 6b, and the latter grading into blue-grey to pink-grey petalite in 

Subunit 6c. Transitional zones and interlayering are common between each subunit and the 

results of recent surface geological mapping show that folding has produced a repetition of 

Subunit 6a on the south side of Subunit 6b. The central and north portions of the main SRLD 

(Unit 6) end abruptly to the west, and thin to the east. 



 
 

 50 

The petalite zone rock units are characterized by a heterogeneous texture and locally a strong 

to mylonitic foliation developed parallel to the primary compositional banding. Grain size 

and textural features vary from fine- to medium-grained (as seen in Subunits 6c and 6d), 

ribbon-like (as seen in Subunit 6a), and locally coarse and megacrystic (Subunits 6b and 6c). 

In many of the finer grained and mylonitized zones, as in Subunits 6c and 6b, petalite either 

resembles potassium feldspar or is too fine-grained to permit visual identification. 

 

Through surface geological mapping and core drilling, Avalon has identified two petalite-

deficient zones within the main petalite zone. One at the west end centred on 460W and the 

other to the east end centred on 350W (these lines are the original project grid lines shown on 

Figure 7.3). The western unit is a combination of Units 4 and 5, whereas the eastern unit is 

reported to be texturally and mineralogically identical to the enclosing petalite zone but 

abruptly becomes completely devoid of petalite. 

 

Discontinuous albitic dykes, commonly with petalite cores, occur in boudinaged, pinch-and-

swell swarms proximal to the northern contact of the SRLD and the Western Pegmatite. Most 

are narrow and less than 1 m wide, with exceptions reaching 12 to 15 m in width and 150 m 

in length, including a lepidolite-rich dyke encountered in diamond drilling, and referred to as 

the Lepidolite Dyke. 

 

Avalon reports that the SRLD and its proximal dykes exhibit zoning characteristics seen in 

other highly evolved rare-metal pegmatites, i.e., well-developed wall zones with exo- and 

endocontact borders and an internal intermediate petalite-rich zone. The exocontact border 

zones are discontinuous and narrow (1 to 10 cm) and comprise recrystallized amphibolite 

with abundant fine- to coarse-grained acicular holmquistite and cesium-rich biotite-

phlogopite (glimmerite). 

 

Pegmatitic granite dykes and larger elliptical intrusions related to the Separation Rapids 

Pluton outcrop at several locations on the property. These rocks (Unit 7) consist 

predominantly of white rubidium-rich potassium feldspar, with subordinate amounts of 

albite, green lithian muscovite, quartz, accessory garnet (spessartine), cassiterite, apatite, 

tantalum oxides and granite. 

 

7.4 STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY 
 

Lithological units making up the SRLD, the amphibolite and Separation Rapids Pluton (see 

Figure 7.2) are characterized by a strong to locally mylonitic subvertically-dipping foliation. 

This foliation and associated ductile shear zones are heterogeneously developed parallel to 

the primary compositional banding and regional trend of the rare-metal pegmatite dykes and 

the SLMB during north-northeast to south-southwest regional compression. Centimetre- and 

metre-scale, tight to isoclinal folding and boudinage of dykes is abundant in the amphibolite 

and the SRLD. 

 

A zone of intense deformation, indicated by well-developed mylonite, bifurcating and 

anastomosing around smaller less-deformed zones, occurs within the southern third of the 



 
 

 51 

SRP along an inferred reactivated regional-scale fault structure (see Figure 7.4). This 

deformation zone continues westwards into the compositionally-similar Western Pegmatite 

and eastwards into albitite dykes of the Eastern Swarm.  

 

A significant proportion of the original pegmatite minerals in the SRLD has been modified 

by ductile shearing and deformation. The tectonic modification of the original pegmatitic 

zoning and local obliteration of primary textures, secondary alteration and replacement 

textures, greatly hinders visual identification of such features in outcrop and drill core. In 

addition, deformation within the SRLD has also produced localized recrystallization and 

conversion of petalite into a polygonal, net-like (web-textured), mosaic of secondary 

medium- to coarse-grained petalite enveloped by fine-grained (100 μm) intergrowths of 

quartz+petalite+spodumene. This phenomenon might locally constitute as much as 20% of 

the petalite zone. However, the multiphase nature of the SRLD, the primary magmatic 

zonation and banding, and original petalite and feldspar crystals are all locally preserved. 

 

Pegmatite and amphibolite screens within the main zone of the SRLD, and especially along 

its east flank, are complexly interfolded. Fold axial planes lie subparallel and parallel to the 

prominent foliation in the pegmatite. In pegmatite and amphibolite within the main zone of 

the SRLD and amphibolite outside of the main zone of the SRLD, these folds plunge steeply 

east-southeast, subparallel to all observed linear fabrics, i.e., mineral and intersection 

lineations. However, elongation of boudins is reported to be vertically oriented. The intensity 

of fold development and local variation in strain intensity are associated with local variation 

in composition and lithology. 

 

Avalon has inferred that the widest part of the SRLD consists of a series of coeval zoned 

units that have been tectonically coalesced through isoclinal folding in a dilatant flexure.  

 

Avalon reports that there are no large-scale faults parallel or crosscutting the SRLD and 

small-scale joints or faults are discontinuous, few in number and have insignificant offsets. 

The fold pattern is, on the scale of the whole pegmatite area, classic Type III interference as 

reported by Ramsay (1962). 

 

7.5 MINERALIZATION 
 

7.5.1 Extent of Mineralization 
 

Geological mapping and diamond drilling show that the SRLD system has a strike length of 

over 1.5 km, and widths ranging from 10 to 70 m (see Figure 7.5). To date, the SRLD has 

been intersected by drilling to a vertical depth of almost 275 m. The petalite-bearing 

pegmatite zones show little variation in true width between surface outcrop, up to 70 m, and 

up to 45 m for near-surface and the deepest intersected levels. These zones are open to depth. 

 

The central portion of the SRLD is a low, dome-shaped hill, formed by the well-exposed 

main mineralized zone. It has a strike length of 600 m with a drill-tested vertical depth of at 



 
 

 52 

least 250 m. It forms the widest portion of the SRLD, averaging 55 m over a 300 m strike 

length. 

 

As noted above, the SRLD has been divided into three sub-zones, namely the SRP, Western 

Pegmatite and Eastern Swarm (see Table 7.4 and Figure 7.5).

ratios is in the order of 4:1 or greater. 
1 The areal extent refers to the original exploration grid coordinates, see Figure 7.3, Figure 7.4 and Figure 7.5. 

 

Surface geological mapping and diamond drilling carried out by Avalon between lines 550W 

and 700W (see Figure 7.3, Figure 7.4 and Figure 7.5) show that the Western Pegmatite is the 

western continuation of the SRP, with the width narrowing significantly to 10 m and less. 

The western limit for the SRP is not definitively established due to poor exposure beyond the 

mapped portion of the Western Pegmatite. However, holmquistite is reported to occur in 

lithium-exomorphic haloes where it coats fractures in amphibolite outcrops west of Avalon's 

claim block 1178306, indicating the likely proximity and westward continuation of the 

lithium-rich pegmatites. 

 

The Eastern Swarm is interpreted by Avalon to represent the bifurcated extension of the 

southern part of the SRP. 

 

Folded and deformed, discontinuous, albitite dykes and stringers are common to the north of 

the SRP, especially in proximity to the northwestern boundary in the vicinity of the Great 

White North pegmatite (see Figure 7.5). 

 

7.6 MINERALOGY 
 

Companies currently mining rare-metal deposits containing spodumene, petalite and the 

other lithium-bearing silicate minerals, commonly quote reserves and resources in tonnes and 

percent Li2O rather than the proportion of minerals present. However, unlike the chemical 

industry, which is interested in Li2O and lithium carbonate, the glass and ceramics industry is 

predominantly interested in the major lithium-bearing minerals, which can be used directly in 

glass and ceramic production. In the case of the SRP, Avalon recognized that the modal 

content of the primary mineral petalite is critical to establishing the resources for the deposit, 

with Li2O content important in defining the grade of the final product. 

 



 
 

 53 

Geological mapping and assays for surface and drill core samples indicate that mineralogy 

and Li2O grades of the mineralization in the SRP are relatively homogeneous throughout the 

petalite-bearing body. An example of this is seen in trench SLT-1 which extends across the 

widest part of the exposed zone; Li2O grades in this trench vary from 0.97 to 2.00% and 

average 1.58% over the 58.9-m width. Mineralogy is obviously a critical concern for the 

Separation Rapids Project. A number of mineralogical studies have been carried out during 

the exploration of the Project including by commercial laboratories and also academic 

studies, such as those by Taylor, 1999a. 

 

Rare-element pegmatites are a major source of lithium-bearing minerals (spodumene, 

petalite, amblygonite/montebrasite, eucryptite and lepidolite and lithian micas) used in the 

glass and ceramics industries. Lepidolite is also a major source for rubidium metal and 

formates. Sodium and potassium feldspars, also important to the glass and ceramics industry, 

are ubiquitous in these deposits. As well, rare-metal pegmatites are also the major source of 

tantalum, cesium and beryllium, found in oxide minerals such as wodginite, 

manganocolumbite and manganotantalite, pollucite and beryl, respectively. 

 

In the SRP, petalite, potassium feldspar and sodium feldspar are major rock-forming 

minerals, with subordinate amounts of other minerals including spodumene, lithian 

muscovite, lepidolite, and quartz of which some occur as potentially economically 

recoverable minerals (see Table 7.5 and Table 7.6). Other potentially economic minerals in 

the SRP that occur as accessory mineral phases include the tantalum bearing minerals, 

manganocolumbite and manganotantalite, and the tin bearing oxide, cassiterite. The tantalum 

minerals are finely dispersed through much of the petalite zones.

7.6.1 Mineralogy – Pedersen Modal Estimates from Core Logging 
 

Rare accessory mineral phases in the SRP include topaz and zircon, while the tantalum-

bearing minerals ferrocolumbite and microlite, rare earth-bearing minerals thorite, monazite, 

and xenotime, the zinc-aluminum oxide granite, an unidentified uranium-lead oxide, calcite, 



 
 

 54 

and the sulphides bismuthinite, sphalerite and arsenopyrite occur as very rare accessory 

minerals. 

 

During the core logging completed in 1997-1998 Pedersen estimated the modal percentages 

of the minerals present in the mineralized body (see Table 7.5). The estimates were collated 

into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and submitted to Avalon (Pedersen, 2016a). 

 

Pedersen's drill report notes the following (Pedersen, 1998a): 

"Four core samples from the Big Whopper were submitted to Lakefield Research 

of Lakefield, ON, for polished thin sectioning and petrographic study. 

Specifically, the study identified the mineralogy and textural relationships of four 

recognizable subunits of the Petalite Zone. In addition, a search to identify the 

presence of fluid inclusions was requested due to the presence of a strong 

propane-like odour emanating from certain petalite types when struck or broken. 

Lastly, the study was to identify any secondary or alteration features. 

Thin sections verified to a large degree the macroscopically determined 

mineralogy and cataclastic fabrics. Interestingly, K-feldspar was not identified in 

these samples; it is highly probable that due to the coarse to megacrystic nature 

of the K-feldspar, core was deliberately cut to avoid megacrysts, to the exclusion 

of K-feldspar in the sample. This indicates that K-feldspar can be expected to be 

found as coarse crystals and not as fine interstitial grains. 

Albite was found to be very common and primary, with no recognized secondary 

albite typically found in the tantalum zones of Tanco. Quartz was another 

common interstitial mineral, belying the field observed paucity of this mineral. 

Petalite is found as the most abundant constituent in three of the four samples, 

averaging 30% by volume. It is partially altered along cleavage boundaries 

locally, generally by mechanical grinding with lesser hydrothermal alteration to 

clay in one sample. Two samples show abundant fluid inclusions, which are likely 

the source of the propane-like odour. 

Only minor secondary features were noted, mainly as alteration along petalite 

cleavage planes. One sample identified eucryptite as an alteration product of 

albite. 

Li-bearing (postulated) mica is seen to be a significant constituent in the samples 

submitted, averaging 15% in interstitial aggregates and enclosed in albite. 

Trace fine grained Ta-Nb-Mn oxides, likely mangano-tantalite, were observed in 

three samples in various associations: inclusions in petalite; interstitial to quartz, 

albite, and petalite; and with mica." 

 

7.6.2 Mineralogy – Studies by Pedersen 
 

Specific X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microprobe (SEM) studies were also 

reported by Pedersen, 1998a:  



 
 

 55 

"Seven samples, three from outcrop at the centre of trench SLT-1, and four from 

drill core, were collected for specific mineral phase identification by X-ray 

diffraction (XRD) by Pedersen. One sample from trench SLT-1 was further 

investigated by scanning electron microprobe (SEM). This work was done using 

the facilities of the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of 

Manitoba in Winnipeg. 

Minerals identified or confirmed by XRD include: 

• Petalite, pink. 

• Petalite, green. 

• Petalite, blue-grey. 

• Cassiterite, lustrous red-black with flat diamond shaped cross-section. 

• Spodumene, greenish grey, splintery, pearly lustre. 

• Nontronite, a pink Fe-clay of the Smectite group (Montmorillonites). 
This may not be a correct identification because of the difficulty of 

determining clay structures by XRD. Associated with petalite, likely a 

cleavage plane alteration. 

The sample investigated by SEM contained pink petalite, fine green mica, albite, 

and K-feldspar. 

Single points were tested on petalite, K-feldspar, and albite, and three points on 

mica. No elemental substitution was identified in petalite; iron and manganese 

were not detected, indicating the pink variety of petalite to be very pure. K-

feldspar was found to be highly enriched in rubidium, with 1.5 wt.% Rb. Mica is 

significantly enriched in Rb and F, with an average 2.14 wt.% Rb and 1.369 to 

4.139 wt.% F. Iron (Fe2O3) ranges from 2.8 to 5.4 wt.% Fe2O3, and manganese 

from 0.661 to 1.659 wt.% Mn. No gallium (Ga) or Rb was detected in albite. 

One polished thin section was examined by XRD by Lakefield, which confirmed 

constituent minerals to be petalite, quartz, albite, plagioclase, mica, and K-

feldspar." 

 

7.6.3 Mineralogy – Studies by Taylor 
 

7.6.3.1 Mineralogical and Geochemical Determination of Petalite Content 
 

In 1999, Avalon, through Dr. Richard Taylor at Carleton University in Ottawa, carried out a 

comprehensive mineralogical and geochemical study of SRP drill core, surface samples and 

some sub-samples of mineral concentrates. Forty samples from drill holes SR97-02, SR97-03 

and SR98-57 from section 460W, the widest portion of the SRP, and two samples from the 

lepidolite dyke, Subunit 6d, were analysed. 

 

This study identified and chemically characterized the essential and accessory mineral phases 

present in the petalite-bearing lithologies of the SRP (Figure 7.6). Analytical techniques used 

are listed in Taylor (1999a). The constituent minerals of the SRP are listed in Table 7.6.

Taylor in this preliminary study were: 

 Subunits 6a and 6b  30%

Petalite from the SRP is remarkably close to the ideal theoretical chemical composition, as 

well as being very pure, with marked absence of deleterious elements such as iron. An 

average petalite analysis is provided in Table 7.7.

Taylor 1999a. 

 

The average Li2O content of 4.78% for SRP compares to the stoichiometric value of pure 

petalite at 4.88% Li2O.  

 

As reported in Micon, 1999, the petalite content in the SRP was originally determined by 

using a combination of visual estimates, observations from outcrops and drill core, and 

stoichiometric extrapolation of Li2O whole rock assays. Avalon determined that the Li2O 

grades in its preliminary resource estimation were consistent with the main zone of the SRP 

containing a chemically-derived modal petalite content ranging from 22% to 47%. This 

modal content range was corroborated by Li2O and Rb2O assays from continuous chip 

samples from trenches SLT-1 to SLT-5, which were reported to be consistent with visual 

estimates of petalite and potassium feldspar contents of approximately 30% each. The 

average Li2O content and estimated percent petalite in the four main pegmatite masses, 

representing most of the strike length of the SRLD, shown in Table 7.8, are also remarkably 

consistent. However, the latter values are higher than those obtained for the chip samples 

from trenches SLT-1 to SLT-5.

Although the results of Avalon's preliminary work and Taylor's studies in 1998 and 1999 

show a good correlation of average Li2O grades determined for the SRP, chemically-derived 

modal abundances are imprecise. Taylor, (1999a) reported that whole-rock analyses might 

not necessarily be indicative of the true petalite content in the SRP due to the following: 

• No attempt was made to adjust calculations to take into account the presence of other 
lithium-bearing minerals, e.g., spodumene, lepidolite and lithian micas in the SRP. 

• Representativeness of samples is difficult to maintain when the lithologies are coarse-
grained (pegmatitic). 

• Visual identification of petalite, both in drill core and outcrop, is difficult due to 
similarities between petalite and sodium feldspar, with which it is intimately 

associated, and the effects of cataclasis and grain size reduction.  

• Li2O content has been shown to decrease in petalite that has undergone incipient or 
mechanical alteration, and clay-altered petalite might produce and account for lower 

than expected Li2O values in drill core where visual estimation indicated the potential 

for higher than normal Li2O assays. 

• Taylor's preliminary results should be applied to section 460W of the SRP alone, 
even though samples from section 460W are considered by Avalon to be 

representative of the entire petalite zone of the SRP. 

• The obtained modal abundances from Taylor's preliminary mineralogical and 
geochemical study were intended to provide broad estimates of the mineral content. 

 

7.6.3.2 Quantitative Modal Analysis 
 

A petrographic and mineralogical study of eleven drill core samples spanning the length and 

width of Unit 6 of the SRP, with both near surface and deeper intercepts, was undertaken by 

Taylor and the results shown in Table 7.9 (Taylor, 1999b). The locations of drill holes used 

for mineralogical studies are shown in Figure 7.6.

This study consisted of detailed point counting, using a scanning electron microprobe, of 

polished grain mounts of aliquots from the original drill core assay samples. The 

investigation was undertaken to establish the modal abundance of the primary minerals 

petalite, potassium feldspar, albite, mica, spodumene and quartz. The detailed results of the 

study are given in Taylor (1999b) and are summarized below in Table 7.10. Note that these 

data exclude Subunit 6d which is high in lepidolite.

The spodumene content is typically low, from 0 to 2%, but highly variable; where petalite 

has been replaced by spodumene, it can be as much as 13%. This replacement phenomenon 

appears to be randomly distributed throughout the SRP. All the micas identified in the above 

study are fluorine-rich and therefore considered to be lepidolite or lithian micas (muscovite 

does not contain fluorine).

Although limited to eleven samples, the results nevertheless show that petalite content in the 

SRP is laterally and vertically consistent, with minimal significant changes apart from local 

increases in spodumene as a result of petalite replacement. While the error on the mean 

values for modal contents of these minerals is reported to be in the region of ±5%, the means 

and ranges are close to those obtained in Avalon's preliminary estimates and correspond 

closely with the feed determined from the Lakefield metallurgical study (Lakefield, 1998). 

 

7.6.3.3 Feldspars 
 

Potassium feldspars in the SRP have been shown to be rubidium-rich, high-purity end-

members (Taylor, 1999b). 

 

Avalon's preliminary geochemical study of the petalite-bearing lithologies showed that 

microcline contains very high concentrations of rubidium ranging from 1.51-2.78% Rb2O, 

with an average of 1.82% (Pedersen, 1997). The study also showed that the petalite zone 

microclines (potassium feldspar) have low iron concentrations, less than 0.03% Fe2O3, and 

relatively low concentrations of Na2O (0.28- 0.46 %). As well, Taylor (1998) notes that 

perthitic intergrowth of albite and microcline feldspars, a common feature of pegmatites, is 

not well-developed in microcline in the SRP. 

 

Sodium feldspar (albite) in Unit 6 is also low iron, less than 0.03% Fe2O3, low in CaO 

(0.47%) and K2O (less than 0.15%). 



 
 

 61 

 

Drill core assays of Unit 6 lithologies indicate an average overall whole rock grade of 0.35% 

Rb2O, it appears that about half the rubidium is contained in potassium feldspar (microcline), 

and half in mica species. The exception is the lepidolite-rich Unit 6 lithologies, specifically 

Subunit 6d where it is likely that much of the rubidium is in lepidolite. Analysis of individual 

potassium feldspars show that this mineral is rich in both rubidium, in the range of 1.51 to 

2.78% Rb2O, equivalent to 1.38 to 2.54% rubidium metal, and potassium, in the range of 

15.62 to 16.47% K2O. 

 

Avalon initially considered that Rb2O grades indicated a chemically-derived potassium 

feldspar modal content averaging approximately 15-20%, or more (Pedersen, 1998a). 

Taylor's petrographic study showed that this estimate is high is due to the presence of 

lepidolite and lithium mica (Taylor, 1998). 

 

The SRP feldspathic units (Units 3, 4, and 7) also contain elevated Rb2O contents 

comparable to the petalite zone (Unit 6) lithologies. Preliminary detailed analysis of 

potassium feldspars from these units show that they are chemically similar to the petalite 

zone feldspars and indicates that the feldspathic zone units constitute a further potentially 

economic source of this mineral (Pedersen, 1998a). 

  

Further detailed petrography of the feldspathic zone units is required for a better 

understanding of the potentially economic feldspar content and quality. 

 

7.6.4 Mineralogy – ALS (QEMSCAN®) Study 
 

In 2016, Avalon submitted eight samples of crushed drill core to the ALS Environmental 

(ALS) laboratory in Kamloops, British Columbia for QEMSCAN® analysis of mineralogy 

(ALS, 2016). ALS completed QEMSCAN® analysis of the eight samples and submitted the 

data to Avalon as an Excel spreadsheet. In addition, one XRD analysis was completed of an 

individual sample for comparison purposes. The XRD analysis was completed at Department 

of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences at University of British Columbia. The XRD 

results are presented below (Table 7.11). The XRD diffraction data is useful because the 

method can identify petalite whereas QEMSCAN® cannot definitively identify petalite due to 

its inability to analyse light elements like lithium. 

 

The analyses for XRD account for 100% of the mineral content, a satisfactory total 

considering that some minerals such as tantalite, topaz and others are not measured by this 

method.

A similar comparison, but of the averages of subunits 6a, b and c for Pedersen, Taylor, 

Lakefield and ALS, are given in Table 7.14, averaged for Subunits 6a, 6b and 6c. Subunit 6d 

is excluded because of its enhanced lepidolite content. In viewing this data, it must be noted 

that the number of samples in each study is relatively small and the range of results may 

simply be due to the inherent variability in the material and the small sample number.

In conclusion, the various mineralogical investigations show similar estimates of mineral 

content for a range of samples. In particular the mean estimates of Taylor, Lakefield and 

ALS of the total feldspar content average 39% for the two means and representing a total of 

28 samples examined of four different lithologies of Subunits 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d. This average 

of 39% for individual samples can be compared to two metallurgical bulk samples of Unit 6 

that averaged 40.7% total feldspar when analysed by QEMSCAN®.  

 



 
 

 65 

Pedersen's average of 43.3% total feldspar is higher but illustrates the difficulty of accurately 

estimating mineral percentages during visual examination of drill core using a hand lens 

where some minerals in some cases have been subjected to shearing and mylonite textures. In 

particular, when albite and potassium feldspar are fine-grained distinguishing the two is 

challenging.  

 

The representivity of the feldspar content measurements given in this report can be 

considered by reference to Figure 7.7. Eleven drill holes have had quantitative mineralogy of 

which Taylor (1999a) examined SR97-02, -07, -09, -18 and SR98-32, 35, 37, 40, 41, 43 

while ALS analysed SR97-02 and SR98-52. Lithologies were covered to the extent of seven 

samples of Subunit 6a, five samples of Subunit 6b, five samples of Subunit 6c and three 

samples of Subunit 6d. As a result, it can be considered that the drill holes studied cover most 

of the strike length of the deposit and all subunits of Unit 6 were studied. Thus, the 

conclusions are considered to be representative of the deposit.

Avalon has completed further QEMSCAN® analysis of about 50 drill core assay samples in 

order to understand the distribution of the economically important minerals. The results of 

this work show that the average petalite content ranges from 21% to 28% and the lepidolite 

content in Subunit 6d averages about 11%. However, it should be kept in mind that these 

percentages are only representative of the samples analysed and the overall deposit may 

differ somewhat from these numbers. 

 



 
 

 66 

The distinction between micas with high and low iron content noted in Table 7.15 is 

presented as it is believed that the low iron micas include lepidolite, the distinctive red 

coloured high lithium mica in Subunit 6d (see further discussion below in the section on 

micas).

7.6.5 Tantalum, Tin and Niobium 
 

Tantalum occurs in a number of different, fine-grained tantalum bearing minerals (Table 

7.5), but discrete tantalum-rich zones have not been encountered. To date, trace to minor 

amounts of tantalum have been found in albite-rich rocks and in the lepidolite-rich zones 

within the SRP.  

 

Metallogenic zoning within the SRP is closely related to mineralogical zoning. Lithium and 

rubidium enrichment occur in zones where tantalum and cesium are excluded. The exception 

to this is in Subunit 6d where the tantalum content is elevated to several hundred ppm. 



 
 

 67 

Tantalum is also sporadically elevated in the albitic dykes wherever lithium and rubidium 

values are depressed. 

 

Preliminary mineralogical and geochemical studies (Taylor, 1999a) showed that the mineral 

columbite-tantalite, (Mn,Fe)(Nb,Ta)2O6, is typically manganese-rich, widespread and 

comprises about half of the accessory mineral population in any given sample. Taylor 

(1999a) also identified the presence of microlite as an important mineral in terms of 

abundance, and this is also a manganese-rich tantalum mineral. 

 

The average Ta2O5 contents for the petalite zone lithologies are: 

Subunits 6a & 6b  0.009% Ta2O5 

 Subunit 6c   0.009% Ta2O5 

 Subunit 6d   0.010% Ta2O5  

 Unit 6 combined  0.009% Ta2O5 

 

Importantly, the instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) tantalum results from 

Taylor's 1998 study were as much as 30% higher than those obtained by ICP in the original 

assaying program. Taylor suggests that the INAA results are more accurate and indicate that 

tantalum values in the SRP might be higher than originally thought. 

 

The study also showed that cassiterite (SnO2) is locally abundant and represents from 4% to 

70% of the accessory mineral population in the samples analysed and it appears to be 

relatively more abundant in near surface samples from section 460W. Taylor reported that 

the Ta2O5 content of the tin mineral cassiterite is typically low (less than 1.5%). Cassiterite 

distribution is much more irregular than that of columbite-tantalite. It was noted that 

cassiterite occurs largely within peripheral albitic dykes. 

 

7.6.5.1 Micas  
 

Preliminary mineralogical and geochemical studies (Taylor, 1998) showed that the SRP 

micas carry very high concentrations of rubidium (2.46-3.92% Rb2O in silvery mica and 

4.36-4.54% Rb2O in purple micas).  

 

Further study of the micas has been completed by Avalon including funding of Laser 

Ablation – ICP (LA-ICP) mineral analysis by Professor Cliff Stanley at Acadia University in 

Nova Scotia. The results of this work have not been published to date and the information 

presented here is from personal communication with Professor Stanley. 

 

The LA-ICP analyses have shown that the micas present in the SRLD have a complex range 

of compositions and vary from subunit to subunit. The details of the composition variations 

are not presented here, but the relationship of Li2O and FeO content to subunit is shown in 

Figure 7.8 to illustrate the following points: 

• There are at least three major distinct trends in mica composition. 



 
 

 68 

• Each of Subunits 6a, b and d have their own distinct trend. 

• Subunit 6c overlaps with 6a and b. 

• The Li2O content of the micas ranges widely from very low to over 6%. The highest 
Li2O values are in the micas found in Subunit 6d. This includes the pink to red mica 

referred to as lepidolite that is the distinctive identifying feature of Subunit 6d. The 

micas in Subunit 6d are also distinctive in their relatively low FeO content. 

 
Figure 7.8  

LA-ICP Analysis Results for FeO and Li2O on Micas from Subunits 6a, b, c and d 

 

 
 

7.6.5.2 Potentially Deleterious Elements 
 

The SRP petalite is very pure and chemically close to that of the stoichiometric petalite 

composition. Importantly, the iron content is extremely low, averaging 0.01% Fe2O3, with a 

maximum of 0.4% Fe2O3. Fluorapatite occurs as an accessory phase within the SRP and is 

the major source of the phosphorus detected in drill core assays. The SRP has very low P2O5 

content as shown by bulk analyses of trench STL-1 samples (range 0.02 to 0.09% P2O5, and 

average 0.04% P2O5 with one sample of albitic wall-rock assaying 0.22% P2O5). A P2O5 

content of greater than 1% is considered deleterious in feldspar, spodumene and petalite 

concentrates used in the ceramics industry.

7.7 PATERSON LAKE CLAIMS, COVERING GLITTER, WOLF, RATTLER AND SNOWBANK 
PEGMATITES 

 

This group of pegmatites is about 5 km west of the SRLD, or about 3 km west of the Big 

Mack Pegmatite system and with the exception of the Snowbank pegmatite, is described in 

the publication by Clark, 2016, for GoldON Resources Ltd. (GoldON). It was not specifically 

identified as a group by Breaks and Tindle, 2001, and it lies west of any pegmatites referred 

to by those authors. The property was acquired by Avalon in 2017.  

 

The region including and beyond the claim group has had intermittent exploration for base 

metals and gold associated with volcanogenic iron formation and silicified shear zones since 

1947, and more recently (late 1990's) for rare-metal pegmatites with the discovery of the Big 

Whopper pegmatite in 1996. Previous work comprised the following: 

• 1947: Base metals reported by Thomson (Gauthier occurrence) at the west boundary 
of the claim block. 

• 1987-1992: Champion Bear Resources: Mapping, trenching, stripping, geophysical 
surveys, diamond drilling for base metals 

• 1990: Kamo Energy and Resources: Airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey 
over portions of the current claim block. 

• 1999-2001: Champion Bear Resources: Prospecting, stripping, mapping of pegmatite 
occurrences. 

• 2015-2016: GoldON Resources: Re-staking of lapsed Champion Bear claims, 
property visit and pegmatite sampling, technical report. 

 

The claim group is situated in the continuation of the Separation Lake Greenstone Belt 

hosting the SRLD. The area is underlain by mafic meta-volcanics (amphibolite) at the bottom 

of an upward younging sequence of dacite, rhyolite, and derived metasediments in a 

northwesterly facing trend. Sulphide-rich oxide facies iron formation horizons are 

intercalated in amphibolite, with a conformable siliceous alteration horizon at or near the 

contact between amphibolite and rhyolite to the northwest.  

 

Granite, pegmatitic granite, and pegmatite all occur throughout the area. These rocks have 

similar visual and mineralogical components and vary with respect to their mica type and 

content. Most are mineralogically simple with only minor accessory minerals, including 

garnet, dark almandine being the dominant garnet noted. Three known occurrences exhibit 

some degree of mineral fractionation with the reported presence of beryl at the Wolf and 

Rattler pegmatites, and the lithium mineral petalite occurs in the Glitter pegmatite. 

 

A narrow "corridor" of narrow, disjointed feldspathic pegmatites and aplites occur for 4.5 km 

along strike from the Glitter pegmatite southeastward toward the Big Mack pegmatite. The 

width of the zone is interpreted from outcrop sampling and traversing to be approximately 

200-500 m wide. It is postulated that this zone is the locus for evolved pegmatite 



 
 

 70 

emplacement, similar to the albite "corridor" defined along the north boundary of the Big 

Whopper pegmatite system. This zone is occupied by the petalite-bearing Glitter pegmatite 

and represents a geologic target for other sub-cropping or surficially covered petalite-bearing 

pegmatites.  

 

A strong tectonic fabric is overprinted on all units, with strong penetrative foliation and 

schistosity in all non-pegmatitic units. Granites and pegmatite dykes commonly exhibit 

internal strain, particularly at contacts where the competency contrast with weaker 

supracrustals produces mullion and flame structures.  

 

Avalon completed a field program in July-August, 2017, on the recently acquired Paterson 

Lake claim group.  Lithogeochemical and biogeochemical surveys were conducted over the 

claims, in conjunction with prospecting for mineralized pegmatites. 

 

A narrow west-northwest trending corridor of aplitic dykes and lithium geochemical 

anomalies were identified in the course of the work and final analytical results. Five areas of 

anomalous Li in country/host rock were identified in the survey, coinciding with the narrow 

linear corridor of aplitic pegmatite development. A follow-up program of in-fill 

lithogeochemical sampling, geologic and structural mapping, and focused prospecting was 

completed in 2018 along this corridor, centering initially in the identified Li-anomalies. 

 

The Glitter Pegmatite is the westernmost known occurrence of petalite pegmatite in the 

Separation Rapids greenstone belt. It is extremely deformed and isoclinally folded. It is 

exposed for 75 m along strike before pinching in to boudins to the east and striking in to 

overburden to the west. Petalite occurs in the central portion of a series of folded dykes and 

boudins, with the major portion of petalite mineralization occurring in the central thickened 

hinge of the dyke. The dyke is zoned and thins to albitic aplite and petalite-free feldspathic 

pegmatite to the east, and to petalite-free feldspathic pegmatitic granite tectonically "nested" 

at the south margin/limb. Although Breaks (1999) reports the pegmatite to be up to 25 m 

wide (in the fold-thickened hinge), the petalite-bearing portion of the pegmatite has a 

maximum thickness of 15 m.  

 

Considerable deformation is obvious in the form of lenses of biotite-rich, metasomatized 

mafic metavolcanic rock along the contact which locally are traceable into tight folds 

contained within the petalite-rich pegmatite zone. A similar structural history to the Big 

Mack Pegmatite was observed. Notable thickening of petalite-bearing pegmatite within an 

adjacent apophysis was developed during the isoclinal folding stage.  

 

Clark and Siemieniuk (2016) reported that Breaks' trenching, and channel sampling of 1 m 

samples returned values of 1.03% Li2O to 1.64% Li2O, accompanied by trace levels of other 

rare metals (Breaks' sampling reported by Clark). Samples collected by GoldON have a 

maximum of 1.02% Li2O over 1.90 m in trench and channel sampling. These values compare 

well with chip sampling on the original channels conducted by Avalon in the 2017 

exploration program. Continuous chip samples range from 0.87% Li2O to 2.11% Li2O, with 

an average lithium grade of 1.18% Li2O over a continuous 14.8 m length (See Table 7.17). 



 
 

 71 

The Wolf and the Rattler pegmatites are reported as moderately evolved beryl-type 

pegmatites (Breaks et al., 1999). These pegmatites may be genetically linked to a small mass 

of muscovite-biotite-bearing, peraluminous granite, herein named the Skidder pluton.

Breaks (1999) describes the Wolf Pegmatite as a west-striking apophysis of the Skidder 

Pluton. It is essentially a megacrystic pegmatitic granite, consisting of pink K-feldspar 

megacrysts to 30 cm, aplitic albite pods, grey glassy quartz, coarse muscovite, and 

subordinate biotite. Tourmaline has been reported by Breaks (1999). It is exposed over 40 m 

x 100 m and has relatively low values of lithium. No petalite is reported to be present (Clark, 

2016).  

 

The Rattler Pegmatite is a series of deformed lenses, dykes and boudins, in up to 7 m x 12 m 

segregations consisting of pink, coarse grained to locally megacrystic pegmatite hosted in 

strongly foliated amphibolite. The pegmatite is mineralogically simple and likely represents a 

weakly evolved pegmatitic phase proximal to the Separation Rapids Pluton, Skidder pluton, 

or other associated progenitor. No Li-minerals were observed with overall low lithium 

values. Beryl occurs in quartz pods and is the only rare-element mineral reported (Breaks, 

1999). 

 

The Snowbank Pegmatite occurs approximately four kilometres northwest of the main SRLD 

and 1300 m east of the Glitter Pegmatite. It was discovered in 2018 by Avalon (Avalon News 

Release, September 4th, 2018), and is associated with albitic dykes in a large outcrop area 

traceable for over 100 m along strike (open under overburden at both ends) averaging 6 m 

wide. Like the main deposit, the lithium occurs primarily in the ore mineral petalite, which 

occurs as large crystals up to 15 cm in diameter. Individual channel samples have yielded 

assays of up to 2.51% Li2O over 1.1 m, indicating that petalite comprises approximately 50% 

of the mineral content in the rock sampled. 



 
 

 72 

A preliminary channel sampling program was carried out, focused on the petalite mineralized 

areas, with results compiled in Table 7.18 below. The main Snowbank Pegmatite zone is up 

to 9 m wide, but pinches and swells with some sections bifurcating into two to three smaller 

parallel dykes from 1 to 3 m in width, for a combined average width of 6 m, over the 100 m 

long exposure. Individual dykes exhibit classic pegmatite zoning features, with an internal 

assemblage of coarse petalite, potassium feldspar, albite and quartz, flanked by narrow albitic 

border and wall zones. Three channel samples collected from the petalite mineralized 

sections of the main Snowbank Pegmatite zone average 1.40% Li2O, while three other 

parallel dykes, also sampled, locally host similar mineralization over narrower widths.   

 

Three channels are distributed over a strike length of just over 30 m, with spacing averaging 

about 10 m, in one discrete pegmatite dyke. Visible petalite is exposed continuously for 

about 100 m.

Notes: 

• Sampling was supervised in the field by Avalon geologist J.C. Pedersen, P.Geo. 

• Samples were collected by channel sampling using a portable rock saw, making two cuts 
about 5 cm apart and chiseling out the sample in between. For each analysed sample the cuts 

and sample were continuous. The average weight of each of the twelve samples was 3 kg with 

a range of 1.3 to 4.8 kg. 

• Samples were shipped to ALS Global Laboratory in Thunder Bay. Lithium was analysed by 
method ME-4ACD81 and re-analysed by method LI-OG63 for concentrations above 0.5% Li. 

• QA/QC samples (standard and blank) were included with the sample batch and gave 
acceptable results.  

 

As of the present, none of these pegmatites have been drilled. Breaks et al., 1999 

recommended further exploration around the Skidder pluton.

8.0 DEPOSIT TYPES 
 

The Late Archean SRLD belongs to the petalite sub-type, complex-type class of rare-metal 

pegmatites (Černy and Ercit, 2005). The complex-type pegmatites are geochemically the 

most highly evolved in the spectrum of granitic pegmatites, and petalite-bearing pegmatites 

comprise only 2% of the known complex-type pegmatites. 

 

Complex-type pegmatites are found in many areas of the world and are economically 

important as resources for the rare metals, including lithium, tantalum, cesium and rubidium. 

Bradley and McCauley (2013) and Kesler et al. (2012) have published comprehensive 

overviews of lithium pegmatite deposits. Except for the former producer, Tanco in Manitoba, 

Canada, and the Bikita operation in Zimbabwe and Greenbushes in Western Australia (see 

Table 8.1), most complex-type pegmatites are too small to be profitably mined. With the 

presently estimated resources The Separation Rapids property is of similar order of 

magnitude in size and grade to the Tanco and Bikita original resources.

The SRLD exhibits some significant differences from the norm in its structural setting, 

preservation of magmatic zonation and overall crystal size. Unlike Tanco and Bikita, which 

are shallow dipping, undeformed zoned intrusions, and Greenbushes, which is an 

approximately 45°-dipping, zoned and locally mylonitized pegmatite, the SRLD is 

subvertically-dipping, complexly folded, strongly foliated and locally mylonitized. 

 

As described in Section 7.0, the SRLD exhibits zoning characteristics seen in other highly 

evolved rare-metal pegmatites, i.e., well-developed wall zones with exo- and endo-contact 

borders and petalite-rich intermediate zone. However, within the SRLD a significant portion 

of these zones and zonal features has been tectonically modified. In addition, all three 

currently producing rare-metal pegmatite deposits contain exceptionally large crystals of 

spodumene, petalite and feldspars which permit selective mining; at Bikita and Tanco, 

petalite crystals and pseudomorphs are reported to be as large as 2 m to 2.5 m in size. The 

megacrystic zones in the SRLD, on the other hand, contain crystals no larger than 10 cm to 

15 cm. The true widths and strike extent of the SRLD and the petalite-producing Al Hyat 

sector of Bikita are almost identical (Garret, 2004). 

 

The SRLD also hosts internal and lateral lepidolite-rich zones, found only in the highest 

fractionated rare-element pegmatites. Most of the lepidolite occurs in lateral extensions of the 



 
 

 74 

pegmatite, possibly as a continuum of separate dykes, but nevertheless the result of late stage 

extreme fractionation. High levels of lithium, rubidium and fluorine enrichment are 

associated with lepidolite in these lepidolite zones. Lithium in mica at the SRLD occurs 

principally in lepidolite, but also occurs in lithian-muscovite, which occurs in subordinate 

amounts to lepidolite in lepidolite zones, and also fairly ubiquitously in the petalite sub-zones 

of the deposit

9.0 EXPLORATION 
 

9.1 EARLY EXPLORATION 
 

As noted in Section 6.0, prior to the discovery of rare-metal pegmatite occurrences, 

exploration in the Separation Rapids region focused on base and precious metal 

mineralization. The petalite-bearing SRLD which forms a prominent hill on the south shore 

of MacDonald's Bay on the English River, and an associated group of rare-metal pegmatites, 

were discovered by Dr. Fred Breaks of the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) as a result of a 

detailed study of rare-metal pegmatites in the region between 1994 and 1996. 

 

Avalon entered into an option agreement with Robert Fairservice and James Willis in 

October, 1996 and carried out a brief prospecting and sampling program in November, 1996. 

Dr. David Trueman, a consulting geologist experienced in rare-metal pegmatite deposits, 

carried out a preliminary study of the property and recommended a comprehensive 

exploration program. Avalon subsequently carried out a CAD1.1 million exploration 

program from May, 1997 to March, 1998. This program is described below with the 

information from the assessment report prepared by Pedersen (Pedersen, 1998a). 

 

9.2 1997-1998 EXPLORATION PROGRAM 
 

9.2.1 Line Cutting and Magnetometer Survey 
 

Line cutting, and ground magnetometer survey work were conducted on the Separation 

Rapids property in two stages, the first during May, 1997, and the second in January, 1998. 

Both stages of work were completed by Gibson and Associates of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. 

 

During the first stage of work, a north-south oriented grid totalling 30.9-line km was cut on 

50 to 100 m line spacing and 25 m station intervals. The magnetometer survey was carried 

out over 28.5 km of the grid during May, 1996, with readings taken at 12.5 m intervals. 

During the second stage of work, a total of 6.9 km of line were cut over areas that were not 

accessible during the previous stage and consisted of 50 m fill-in lines between the existing 

100 m lines on the west end of the grid. This portion was surveyed by magnetometer during 

January, 1998. 

 

The magnetic survey was performed using two Scintrex Envi-Mag portable total-field 

magnetometers. The purpose of the survey was to assist with geological interpretation and, in 

particular, to determine the magnetic signature of pegmatite bodies, and to delineate 

structural features, such as faults or folds, which may indicate an appropriate host structure 

for pegmatite bodies. 

 

The results identified a number of breaks in the contours across the entire area, indicating 

faulting or tight open to isoclinal fold patterns. A large reactivated fault, along which the 

SRLD was emplaced, is interpreted from the magnetic data as a sharp contact between a 

linear magnetic high that trends southeasterly across the grid area and a large area of 



 
 

 76 

moderate magnetic susceptibility. The SRLD is represented as a magnetic low adjacent to a 

linear magnetic high, which is the host amphibolite. Larger granitic pegmatites and 

pegmatitic granite also have a low magnetic susceptibility compared to the host amphibolite. 

 

9.2.2 Geological Mapping and Sampling 
 

Geological mapping was conducted over the grid during June and July, 1997, at a scale of 

1:1000 by Pedersen, with the assistance of Jacob Willoughby and Richard Brett. Mapping 

was conducted between the eastern claim boundary at L0+50E and L18+00W.  

 

A second detailed surface geological mapping program was carried out during the summer of 

1998, at a scale of 1:100, over the stripped main SRP outcrop area and some of the adjacent 

pegmatite zones. This second phase of mapping identified the various phases of the SRP, 

delineated the areal extent of petalite-bearing units and the SRP, expanded the known area 

containing the lepidolite zone (Subunit 6d), identified the structural controls on the 

emplacement of the SRP and some of the complexities due to folding, and outlined areas of 

further potential petalite-bearing units, especially the lepidolite-bearing Subunit 6d along the 

east and northeast part of the main SRP body. Outcrop stripping, trenching and systematic 

sampling were also carried out in conjunction with both phases of surface geological 

mapping. 

  

Twenty representative samples of various pegmatitic outcrops were collected and assayed for 

Li, Ta, Nb, Cs, Rb, and Sn. Most samples were representative grab samples, with a few chip 

samples where outcrop allowed. Because of the smooth glaciated nature of most pegmatite 

outcrops, good samples are generally difficult to obtain without trenching or sawing. 

 

Samples were sent to Chemex Labs Ltd. (Chemex) in Thunder Bay, Ontario, for preparation 

and then assayed in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Mississauga, Ontario using atomic 

absorption (AA) for Li and Sn, neutron activation (NAA) for Ta, Cs and Rb, X-ray 

fluorescence (XRF) for Nb, and inductively coupled plasma analysis (ICP) for phosphorus 

reported as P2O5. Results were reported in parts per million and converted to oxide values by 

Avalon with the exception of phosphate, which was reported by Chemex.  

 

9.2.3 Trenching 
 

Five outcrop exposures of the SRLD and other pegmatites were trenched by blasting and 

hand-stripping following completion of field mapping, for the purpose of obtaining 

continuous chip samples across the width of the pegmatites, i.e., trenches SLT-1 through 

SLT-5.  

 

A total of 47 continuous chip samples were collected from the five trenches, with a 

maximum sample length of 3.0 m. The results of assays of samples from the trenches were 

consistent both from trench to trench and along each trench. Assuming that the lithium is 

largely contained in petalite averaging 4.2% Li2O and the rubidium in potassium feldspar 



 
 

 77 

averages 1.0-1.5% Rb2O, then these levels are consistent with visual estimates of petalite and 

potassium feldspar contents of about 30-35% and 20-25%, respectively (Pedersen, 2016a). 

 

9.2.4 Diamond Drilling 
 

The history and statistics of diamond drilling on the property is covered in Section 10.0. 

 

9.3 2000-2014 EXPLORATION 
 

In the period from 2000 to 2014, little work of a geoscientific nature was carried out at the 

property. The main activity relating to advancing the Project was metallurgical and, 

consequently, the main activity at the site was collection of samples, up to and including bulk 

sample sizes, for metallurgical testing. 

 

The principal bulk sample was obtained during Avalon's work program in 2006 when 

approximately 300 t of a bulk sample was extracted from the property, crushed to 5/8-in size, 

and packed in storage bags. This included material down to very fine grain size. This finely 

ground material is very important to retain since it contains most of the petalite mineral of 

interest.  

 

A relatively small sample was shipped to a prospective customer in Europe, but the interest 

for this type of product declined due to market conditions at that time. 

 

Some of the sample bags had started to split as a result of deterioration due to outdoor 

storage prior to the sample being shipped to Europe. Therefore, the material contained in the 

bags was cleaned and any organic material (plants, moss, wood particles) was removed, then 

dried prior to shipment. The decision was made to clean and re-bag all of the sample 

material. 

  

9.3.1 Check Assay Program 
 

An assaying program was undertaken at the same time as sample preparation, as a check on 

the material in storage. A total of 259 subsamples were collected from the bulk sample 

material. In order to reduce the number of analyses required, these subsamples were 

combined to create 40 composites each of between five and seven subsamples. The summary 

statistics of the composite samples are given in Table 9.1.

Various other analyses were completed, including comparison of washed and unwashed 

samples, which importantly demonstrated that washing did not significantly change the 

lithium grade. 

 

9.3.2 Rock and Soil Survey 
 

In September, 2009, a brief rock and soil survey was undertaken at the property by geologist 

Angela Martin (Avalon, 2009) for assessment work credit purposes. The survey area was 

limited to claim number 4221036. The objective of the soil/rock survey was to detect a 

potential extension of the mineralized zone of the SRLD pegmatite system to the north.  

 

As reported by Avalon in 2009, the pegmatite rock descriptions and the mineral assemblages, 

biotite and garnet in particular, imply that the rocks are poorly fractionated and unlikely to be 

lithium mineral bearing. The assay results, and more specifically the rubidium values, while 

interesting, indicated the level of fractionation that might be expected in a pegmatite or a 

pegmatitic granite. No further work has been completed in this area.  

 

In the period 2011 to 2015, there was little geological field work and, generally, site visits 

were either connected with collecting samples for metallurgical work or maintenance of 

access roads and the site. 

 

In 2014, Avalon undertook a program of rehabilitation of the drill core stored at the Project 

site. This comprised reboxing core that was in core boxes that had deteriorated, building new 

racks to replace any in danger of collapse and clearing brush and other vegetation growing 

around the core racks. 

 

9.3.2.1 Acid Rock Drainage 
 

For the purpose of examining acid rock drainage potential of waste rock at Separation 

Rapids, four NQ whole core samples out of 21 collected in November, 2013, were submitted 

for ARD tests to SGS Canada in March, 2015 (Pedersen, 2016c). These core samples were 

chosen as "typical" amphibolite from the main mass area of the SRLD. Visible sulphides 

were difficult to discern in the great majority of amphibolite samples; sample 98-47 is an 

exceptional anomaly, having minor visible pyrrhotite along fractures. Thus, sample 98-47 is 

not chemically representative of typical amphibolite but was chosen to indicate what a 

sample with exceptional visible sulphides, and so a "worst case" may indicate. The initial 

results indicated rocks with low ARD potential. Sulphide percentage ranges from 0.02% to 

0.04%, with total sulphur ranging from 0.05% to 0.101%. The single higher value of 0.101% 

S coincides with a single high carbonate % (0.824%), both of which occur in sample 98-47. 

 

9.4 2017 EXPLORATION PROGRAM 
 

As discussed in Section 7.0, Avalon completed a field program in July-August, 2017, on the 

recently acquired Paterson Lake claim group. The claim group lies immediately north of and 



 
 

 79 

adjacent to the property that Avalon owned prior to the acquisition from GoldON Resources 

of the Paterson Lake group. 

 

Lithogeochemical and biogeochemical surveys were conducted by Avalon over the claims, in 

conjunction with prospecting for mineralized pegmatites. The geology of the mineral 

occurrences and conclusions of the 2017 exploration program are described in Section 6.0 of 

this report. 

 

No drilling has been completed on the Paterson Lake group for lithium mineralization. Some 

99 drill holes were completed in the past (GoldON Resources, 2016, NI 43-101 Technical 

Report on the Paterson Lake Property) but all of these were targeted on base metal 

occurrences in amphibolite units, not lithium pegmatites, and so are not relevant to this 

report.

10.0 DRILLING 
 

10.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Avalon has drilled at the Separation Rapids Lithium Project in a number of campaigns 

between 1997 and 2018. The total number of diamond drill holes is 80 for a cumulative total 

of 13,192 m, as summarized in Table 10.1. The locations of all holes drilled on the property 

are shown in Figure 10.1.

All core is stored in racks on site. In 2014, new core racks adjacent to the original core 

storage were installed. Drill core was transferred to new boxes and stored in the new racks. 

 

10.2 1997-1998 DRILLING PROGRAM 
 

A first phase diamond drilling program was initiated in early October, 1997, (Pedersen, 

1998a) with the objectives of defining the physical parameters of the SRLD pegmatite, its 

tenor of mineralization, and testing of peripheral pegmatites for potential economic size and 

grade coincident with the SRLD. Thirty holes totalling 4,922 m were completed by early 

December, 1997 by Bradley Brothers of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. All core drilled was NQ 

diameter and logged on site by Pedersen, with the assistance of Jeff Morgan. With the 

exception of isolated narrow albitic dykelets, all pegmatite core was split on site and sent to 

X-Ray Assay Laboratories (XRAL) of Don Mills, Ontario for analysis for Li, Rb, Ta, and Cs 

with some check analyses completed at Chemex. Sample preparation was carried out at 

Chemex's Thunder Bay facilities and assays at its Vancouver, BC and Mississauga, ON 

facilities. 

 

Narrow amphibolite screens in areas of abundant pegmatite and internally in the SRLD were 

also split and assayed. With the exception of two holes (SR97-3 and SR97-10) which were 

drilled north (azimuth 000°), all holes were drilled to the south (azimuth 180°). Most were 

drilled at an inclination of -45°, with the exception of several holes, designed to intersect 

pegmatite at a deeper level, which were inclined -50° to -67°. Down hole surveys were 

completed with a Pajari instrument for both dip and azimuth; all were surveyed at the bottom 

of the hole, with longer holes also surveyed below the casing and at the midpoint. Holes 

ranged in length from 80 to 281 m. Drill hole collar locations were surveyed by Ross 



 
 

 81 

Johnson Surveying of Kenora, Ontario with UTM coordinates applied, and elevations 

established to within 1.0 m.

(The base map indicates the distribution of lithium pegmatite, based on outcrop mapping and drill hole 

data. Coordinates: UTM NAD83 Zone 15N) 

 

 
 

The rationale for the 30 holes of the first phase of drilling was as follows: 

• 23 holes were drilled to delineate the SRLD on approximately 50 m spacing: SR97-1 
to SR97-12 and SR97-16 to SR97-26. 

• 6 holes were drilled to outline the eastern portion of the Western Pegmatite: SR97-13 
to SR97-15 (originally to test the Great White North outcrop as an extension of the 

SRLD), SR98-28 and SR97-29 (under Bob's Pegmatite), and SR97-30. 

• 1 hole was drilled to test the Eastern Swarm: SR97-27. 
 

A second phase definition drilling program commenced in February, 1998, with the 

objectives of reducing average hole spacing in the SRLD pegmatite to 25 m, extending the 

known geological resource of the SRLD to 300 m below surface, testing the eastern 

continuation of the Eastern Swarm, and testing two magnetic lows in the northwest quadrant 

of the Fairservice-Willis claims for hidden pegmatites. A total of 27 NQ holes totalling 3,829 

m were drilled by Bradley Brothers of Rouyn-Noranda between early February and the 

middle of March, 1998. All holes were drilled to the south (180°) with the exception of three 



 
 

 82 

holes in the northwest quadrant which were drilled to the north to test magnetic low 

anomalies. Most holes were drilled at an inclination of -45°, except for deeper holes which 

were inclined -50° to -72°. Holes ranged from 63 to 350 m in length. 

 

The rationale for the 27 holes of the second phase of drilling was: 

• 20 holes were drilled to provide in-fill control for mineral resource estimation on the 
SRLD on 25 m centres: SR98-31 to SR98-47, SR98-51 to SR98-53. 

• 2 holes were drilled to test for vertical continuity of the SRLD: SR98-54 and SR98-
57. 

• 3 holes were drilled to test magnetic low anomalies in the northwest quadrant of the 
Fairservice claims: SR98-48 to SR98-50. 

• 1 hole was drilled to test the eastern limit of the Eastern Swarm: SR98-55. 

• 1 hole was drilled to test the vertical continuity of a lepidolite-bearing dyke 
uncovered by stripping during the on-going drill program: SR98-56. 

 

10.3 GEOTECHNICAL DRILL PROGRAM 2001 
 

Between 26 April and 4 May, 2001, three oriented core diamond drill holes, designated 

SR01-58, SR01-59 and SR01-60, were drilled using a Boyles 35 diamond drill equipped with 

a wireline core retrieval system and supervised by Knight Piésold (Knight Piésold, 2001). 

Knight Piésold was retained to complete a geomechanical investigation of the rock mass at 

the proposed open pit mine and to develop suitable pit slope design parameters to comply 

with a feasibility level study. The potential for water inflow into the open pit was also 

evaluated. Packer tests were completed in each hole.  

 

The drill was supplied and operated by Bradley Brothers Limited of Timmins, Ontario. 

Drilling was completed using an NQ triple-tube core barrel. Core orientation was performed 

with the clay imprint method. For this method, an eccentrically weighted core tube was 

lowered down the hole with the wire line equipment. The lifter case at the base of the orienter 

tube was filled with plasticine clay, which is pushed down the hole to obtain an impression of 

the core stub at the bottom of the hole. 

 

Upon retrieval of the following drill run, the clay impression was matched with the top of the 

run. This was used to determine the top of the core. The core was then assembled, and a 

reference line was drawn on the core to indicate the top of the core. Work completed 

included: 

• Logging and photographing by Avalon of all core prior to being split for assaying. 

• Measurements of the discontinuity orientations. 

• Point Load Tests (PLT) on representative samples of the core to obtain an estimate of 
the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of the rock types encountered.  



 
 

 83 

• Packer testing: at selected intervals in the drill holes, measurements of the hydraulic 
conductivity of the rock mass were made using an NQ diameter double packer 

system. 

• Rock mass classification: in order to quantify the engineering properties of rock 
masses, two separate rock mass classification systems were used for the study – the 

Rock Tunnelling Quality Index (Q) and the Rock Mass Rating (RMR) system. 

 

As noted by Knight Piésold, 2001, Avalon assayed the core from the geotechnical holes. The 

data are included in the Separation Rapids drill database.  

 

10.4 GEOLOGICAL DRILL PROGRAM 2001 
 

In May, 2001, 12 diamond drill holes totalling 1,401 m were completed (Avalon News 

Release 25 July, 2001), including the three geotechnical drill holes noted above, i.e., holes 

SR01-58 through SR01-69. The drilling of nine non-geotechnical holes was east of the main 

mass of the SRLD to delineate the depth and Ta-Cs potential of a series of anastomosing 

narrow lepidolite-rich petalite-dykes which represent the eastern extension of the pegmatite. 

The results indicated a continuous vertical extent of the dyke swarm, but no thickening with 

depth. Tantalum and cesium values were slightly elevated relative to those in the main mass 

of the SRLD. In general, the results from this program were consistent with those from 

previous drilling, which indicated zones of relative tantalum enrichment on both the eastern 

and western extremities of the deposit, ranging from 0.009% Ta2O5 to 0.022% Ta2O5 (0.2 to 

0.5 lb/t) compared to 0.007% to 0.009% Ta2O5 within the main mass of the SRLD pegmatite. 

 

10.5 2016 RE-ANALYSIS PROGRAM 
 

In June, 2016, 45 intervals from two previous drill holes (SR97-2 and SR98-52) were 

selected and quartered for re-analysis as part of an updated QA/QC program, with standards 

inserted every tenth sample. This is reported in more detail in Section 12.0. 

 

10.6 DRILL PROGRAM 2017 
 

A diamond drill program of five holes totalling 1,473 m was performed in the spring of 2017, 

which targeted the Separation Rapids lithium-rubidium pegmatite (holes SR17-71 to -74) and 

a magnetic low in the west of the main pegmatite (SR17-70). Boart Longyear of Calgary, 

Alberta, was contracted to perform the drilling using a Boart Longyear LF70 skid-mounted 

diamond drill rig producing HQ core.  

 

Downhole azimuth and inclination for all holes was surveyed using a magnetic Devishot 

multi-shot tool (Devico) at intervals of 6 m. 

 

Collar surveys were conducted by Rugged Geomatics Ontario Land Surveyors of Kenora, 

ON. Survey objectives were two-fold: 

• Survey current drill program collars (5 drill collars). 



 
 

 84 

• Survey historic collars with intact casing to obtain additional azimuth data (13 
collars). 

 

The survey was horizontally related to UTM Zone 15 NAD83 CSRS datum, and vertically to 

Geodetic CGVD 28 datum. A Trimble RTK system consisting of two R8 receivers and high-

powered radio coupled to a TS2 data collector were utilized. A 2-point control network was 

created consisting of post processed baselines. 

 

Drill hole SR17-70 tested a drift covered magnetic low and the on-strike projection of the 

Western Pegmatite. The drill hole encountered numerous intervals of muscovite-bearing 

pegmatitic granite, but no petalite-bearing pegmatite. The hole was terminated due to poor 

ground conditions short of the Western Pegmatite strike projection. 

 

The four diamond drill holes that targeted the SRLD (DH SR17-71 to 74) successfully 

confirmed the geological and grade continuity of the main pegmatite mass (see Table 10.2 

for intercepts details). Significant drill intercepts of petalite and lepidolite and petalite ± 

spodumene pegmatite, all given as true horizontal thicknesses and length-weighted average 

grades, include 15.4 m grading 1.176 % Li2O (drill hole SR17-71), 8.1 m grading 1.431 % 

Li2O and 6.9 m grading 1.506 % Li2O (SR17-72), 19.5 m grading 1.576 % Li2O (SR17-73) 

and 8.2 m grading 1.565 % Li2O in drill hole SR17-74 See Table 10.3). The lithium grades 

are elevated compared to previous resource estimates for the entire deposit, indicating a 

moderate grade increase with depth. The intersected intercepts are associated with length-

weighted averages of Rb2O between 0.343 and 0.473 %.  

 

Preliminary geotechnical evaluations on the drill core, in combination with previous studies, 

indicate good rock stability based on a range of parameters including rock hardness, 

weathering, core recovery, rock quality designation and fracture indices.  

 

A waste rock study was initiated with specific analyses of drill core which indicates overall 

low absolute concentrations of environmental contaminants in the rocks and a low 

environmental risk of acid mine drainage, based on acid base accounting analyses.

10.7 DRILL PROGRAM 2018 
 

A six-hole, 1,548 m diamond drill program was completed in the winter of 2018. Drilling 

was performed by Boart Longyear using the same drill as the 2017 drill program to produce 

HQ diameter core (see Table 10.4). The purpose of the drill program was three-fold: 

• Test the depth extension of the Western Pegmatite, 700 m to the east of the main 
mass of the SLRD (SR18-75, 76). 

• Test and expand the petalite zone (PZ) lepidolite-petalite (LPZ) resources to depth at 
west end of SLRD main mass (SR18-77, 78). 

• Test the lepidolite-petalite mineralization (LPZ) at the SLRD east extension (SR18-
79, 80). 

 

Downhole azimuth and inclination for all holes was surveyed using a magnetic Devishot 

multi-shot tool (Devico) at intervals of 6 m. 

 

A collar survey for the six holes was conducted by Rugged Geomatics Ontario Land 

Surveyors of Kenora, ON at the end of the drill program using a Trimble GPS system with 

two R10 receivers. The survey was horizontally related to UTM Zone 15 NAD83 CGVD28 

datum.

The two holes drilled at the Western Pegmatite (SR18-75,76) intersected petalite 

mineralization over true widths of up to 3 m, confirming lateral continuity of the deposit to 

the west over relatively narrow widths. 

 

Holes SR18-77 and 78 tested depth extensions on the west side of the main deposit to 

approximately 250 m below surface and intersected mainly petalite mineralization (PZ) 

outside the 2017 deposit resource volume. The primary intercepts of petalite pegmatite 

returned values of 1.1% Li2O over 50.9 m cumulative thickness in hole SR18-77 and 1.33% 

Li2O over an 18.7 m thickness in hole SR18-78. 

 

Holes SR18-79 and 80 tested the east side of the main deposit to similar depths and 

intersected a wider zone of lepidolite-rich lithium mineralization (Subunit 6d) than expected. 

Hole SR18-79 intersected 62.27 m of lepdiolite mineralization (6d) within an interval of 

77.05 m averaging 1.27% Li2O, which also includes other zones of petalite mineralization 

(Table 10.5). This represents an estimated true thickness of 33.46 m of Subunit 6d 

mineralization. Hole SR18-80 intersected 1.51% Li2O over a cumulative thickness of 62.85 

m, of which 37.75 m was lepidolite-petalite mineralization and the remainder was petalite 

mineralization. Subunit 6d mineralization in these two holes is largely outside the 2017 

resource model.

The 2018 winter drill program successfully demonstrated continued depth continuity in the 

main and eastern sections of the SRLD, which remain open to depth. The lepidolite zone (6d) 

at the east extension has strong vertical continuity, with a thicker down dip extent in hole 

SR18-80 than pre-drilling projections had indicated. 

 

Holes SR18-75, 76 at the Western Pegmatite confirmed continuity of the petalite pegmatite 

to the west, but with a narrowing to depth, from approximately 10 m in outcrop to <3 m at 60 

m depth. It is possible that this is a function of both pinch and swell deformation, with any 

repetitive cycles at depth requiring further drill testing.

11.0 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
 

11.1 SAMPLE HANDLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS USED – 1997/98 
 

This section, reporting on the past drill core sampling, is largely derived from the reports of 

Pedersen (1998a) and Micon (1999). A summary of the historic sampling is provided in 

Table 11.1. 

 

Forty-seven surface samples taken in the 1990s were shipped to Chemex in Thunder Bay, 

Ontario for preparation and then to Chemex's facilities in Mississauga, Ontario and 

Vancouver, British Columbia for subsequent assaying.  

 

The surface samples from the SRLD were analysed for lithium and tin using atomic 

absorption spectroscopy (AA), and for rubidium, cesium and tantalum using instrumental 

neutron activation analysis (INAA). The trench samples were also analysed for phosphorus 

using Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectroscopy (ICP). Surface samples collected from the 

outcropping dykes in the winter of 1997 were analysed for gallium, niobium and tin by X-ray 

fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) in addition to lithium, rubidium, cesium and tantalum by 

AA and INAA. 

 

In the 1990s, drill core was logged and split with half of the core being sent for assay and the 

other half being stored in core boxes on site. Core sample intervals were varied, depending 

on lithology, to a maximum of 3 m. 

 

Split core samples were shipped to XRAL where they were assayed for lithium, rubidium, 

cesium and tantalum using ICP for lithium and tantalum and AA for rubidium and cesium. 

 

Records indicate that they were a total of 2,491 drill core samples assayed at XRAL (see 

Table 11.1 and Table 11.2), with an additional 221 duplicate analyses for the 1997-98 drill 

programs. Avalon's sampling program includes 163 samples from the SRP and associated 

pegmatites. This included 19 surface grab samples, 47 continuous chip trench samples from 

trenches SLT-1 to SLT-5 (analysed at Chemex), nine trench, chip and surface grab samples 

from the Lepidolite dyke, three surface grab samples from the Fairservice dyke, and 84 drill 

core check assay samples. 

 

A further 299 drill core samples from the 2001 program were analysed at XRAL. No QA/QC 

data is available for these samples. 

 

Check-assaying was routinely carried out for lithium and rubidium by Chemex at its 

Vancouver, British Columbia, and Mississauga, Ontario facilities. 

 

The QA/QC analysis completed on historic drill core are summarized in Table 11.1 and 

Table 11.2. 

 



 
 

 88 

Additional independent analyses were completed by Micon (1999) totalling six core 

duplicates. Also, as reported below, in 2016 Avalon completed additional splitting of the 

original drill core to complete check analyses after preparation of a lithium analytical 

standard from Separation Rapids mineralized rock.

11.2 SAMPLE HANDLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS USED – 2016 
 

In 2016, Avalon re-sampled drill core from the 1990s' programs stored at the Project site. 

The objective was to re-assay the core with modern methods and inserted lithium rock 

standards for comparison to the historic data. 

 

There was no evidence that the drill core had been tampered with in the interim period. The 

work was personally supervised by Chris Pedersen who also supervised the drilling in the 

1997-1998 period. Pedersen also supervised the re-boxing and re-racking of the drill core in 

2015. Thus, Pedersen could observe whether the core appeared to be undisturbed in terms of 

being correctly labelled and complete. 

 

In July, 2016, under the supervision of Pedersen, the half core of two 1998 drill holes was 

quartered using a core saw at Ontario government facilities in Kenora. Samples were bagged 

according to identical intervals to the samples collected in the 1990s. This enables direct 

comparison between original analytical values and 2016 assays. The two drill holes, SR97-02 



 
 

 89 

and SR98-52, were sampled across the complete intercept of the pegmatite body. Lithium 

rock analytical standards developed internally by Avalon were inserted into the sample 

stream (see Section 12.0 for details). 

 

The 2016 quarter-core samples were sent to ALS Geochemistry Laboratory (ALS) in 

Sudbury, Ontario with a request for the following analyses: 

• CRU21 – preliminary crushing with fine crushing of rock chip and drill samples to 
70% nominal -2 mm. 

• SPL22Y – premium splitting procedure producing split sample using a Boyd 
crusher/rotary splitter combination. 

• PUL31 – Pulverize a split or total sample up to 250 g to 85% passing 75 µm. 

• CCP-PKG01 involving five different analytical methods. 

• ME-ICO06 – whole rock analysis. 

• ME-MS81 – 31 elements by lithium metaborate fusion, acid digestion and ICP-MS. 

• ME-4ACD81 – 10 elements including lithium by four-acid digestion – ICP. 

• ME-MS42 – 9 gold-related elements with aqua regia digestion. 

• ME-IR08 – carbon and sulphur. 
 

The core analysis results are discussed in Section 12.0. 

 

11.3 SAMPLE HANDLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS DRILL PROGRAMS (2017 AND 
2018) 

 

In both the 2017 and 2018 diamond drill programs, all lithium bearing pegmatites (Unit 6) 

and representative non-mineralized pegmatite intercepts were sampled on continuous 2-m 

intervals, with shorter intervals where constrained by geologic contacts and amphibolite host 

rock.  In the 2017 drill program, representative samples of amphibolite were also collected 

from holes SR17-71 to 74 for analysis and environmental test work focused to some extent 

on potential for acid rock generation. 

 

Sample intervals were marked along the core axis by the geologist, then split using a 

mechanical splitter by a technician under the supervision of the geologist. One half of the 

split core went in to a plastic sample bag, the other half returned to its position in the core 

box. A corresponding sample tag was placed in the bag of each sample, with a duplicate 

sample tag stapled in to the core box at the beginning of the sample interval. The sample 

number was also written in felt pen on the outside of the bag. Each sample was then sealed 

with single-use nylon zip-ties. 

 

Avalon had previously prepared an analytical standard for the Project utilizing rock material 

from the SRLD. This analytical standard, SR2016, was created from rock collected off the 

SRLD outcrop, prepared at CDN Laboratory in British Columbia. It was subjected to a 



 
 

 90 

Round Robin involving six independent laboratories in Canada and Australia in order to 

determine a certified value. The certified value for the standard based on the round robin is 

1.488 ± 0.039 wt. % Li2O at one standard deviation (see discussion in Section 12.4.3.1). 

 

Together with the drill core assay batches, packages of Avalon's lithium standard were 

analyzed with one standard inserted per 25 samples. The standard samples, when inserted 

into the sample stream, were given appropriate sample numbers using the same sample tags 

as core samples, to ensure they remained in the correct position within the analysis stream. 

 

Blank samples were also inserted into the sample stream, at one per 40 drill core samples. 

Blanks were composed of silica sand which was inserted in standard plastic sample bags by 

Avalon geological staff and then numbered with sample numbers consecutive with core 

samples, in order to ensure an appropriate analysis order. 

 

Samples were placed in rice bags for transport to the ALS preparation laboratory in Thunder 

Bay, with from three to five samples per rice bag. The rice bag was then secured shut with 

nylon zip ties and stored inside the core logging facility on private property. Rice bags were 

delivered by Avalon personnel to Manitoulin Truck Lines in Kenora, where the rice bags 

were placed on wooden pallets and shrink wrapped for shipping and direct delivery to the 

ALS in Thunder Bay. 

 

Upon arrival at ALS in Thunder Bay, samples were received and documented by ALS staff 

for initial preparation, and then pulps were shipped to ALS in Vancouver for analysis. 

 

Pulp duplicates also were prepared at ALS and shipped to Avalon's Toronto office. Avalon 

then repackaged the duplicates with inserted pulp standards and shipped to SGS Canada 

Laboratory in Lakefield, Ontario, for check assays.   

 

Analytical procedures are discussed below. 

 

Sample preparation of pegmatite core for both 2017 and 2018 drill programs: 

• Method PREP-33D: 

o Crush entire sample to 90% passing 2mm 

o Pulverize 1 kg split to 95% passing 100 microns 

o Second 250 gm split prepared from every 10th core sample EXCLUDING 
standards and blanks for check analysis at second lab (SGS) 

 

Sample preparation of amphibolite host rock from the 2017 drill program: 

• Crush entire sample to >70% passing 2 mm. 

• Riffle-split 250 gm and pulverize to >85% passing 75 microns. 

• Composite 200 gm of each of 3 samples from rejects and combine to make 1 sample 
of 600 gm. Remaining 400 gm samples shipped to Toronto with new sample for 

further environmental testwork.

11.4 DRILL DATABASE PREPARATION 
 

For the drill programs in the 1990s, data compilation and drafting of sections and level plans 

were carried out on site by the Project geologist with subsequent modification at Avalon's 

Thunder Bay office. All field logging was done on paper and data were not digitized. 

 

The original drill hole database for the Separation Rapids Lithium Project was developed for 

the 1999 Micon Preliminary Feasibility Study by Pearson, Hoffman and Associates Ltd. 

(PHA). The database was created from the drill logs with lithologies, provided by Avalon to 

PHA as well as laboratory analysis certificates and surveying data. There is no information in 



 
 

 92 

the PHA (1999) report or the prefeasibility study as to what quality control measures were 

implemented on the database. 

 

The database was provided by Micon to Avalon as a series of Excel worksheets in 2011. 

These data were then imported into the Avalon corporate drill database in the Maxwell 

Geoservices DataShedTM data management software. This is the major database that Avalon 

utilizes for all its drilling projects and to provide organised drill data for resource estimation. 

 

Avalon then completed verification of this database against historic data records such as drill 

logs, assay certificates, and other original sources of data. The objective was to ensure that 

errors are not present in the DataShedTM database. The results of this work are given in 

Section 12.0. 

 

11.5 HISTORIC SPECIFIC GRAVITY 
 

The drill database contains 185 specific gravity (SG) values for various lithologies on the 

SRLD. This comprises 118 measurements on pegmatite, 66 on amphibolite and one 

measurement which was considered an outlier and was rejected. 

 

As part of the original drill program (Pedersen, 1998a), Avalon carried out SG measurements 

on 20 representative drill core samples of the pegmatite using a Mettler Toledo PB 1501 

Electronic Balance at the University of Manitoba. The balance was calibrated at the 

beginning of the procedure with a 1,000 g sample and checked on a regular basis. A 

microcline (potassium feldspar) sample measured at 2.53 was deemed an acceptable test, as 

the SG of the sample fell within the range of published data. 

 

The original data for 20 samples has not been identified. However, PHA (1999) provides the 

data shown in Table 11.3 for the SG of the various lithologies.

Feldspar Zone 2.62

Host Rock Waste 2.90 

Air 0.00 

PHA, 1999. 

 

In October, 2014, Pedersen completed a further 185 specific gravity determinations on core 

samples using the same equipment at the University of Manitoba. These core samples were 

from eight drill holes that covered both pegmatite (118 measurements) and amphibolite (66 

measurements). Holes covered were SR97-08, -09 and -10 and SR98-33, -34, -35, -36 and 

- 37. One additional measurement was rejected during resource estimation as an outlier. 

 



 
 

 93 

Based on the measurements completed in 2014, the average SG for pegmatite is 2.62 for the 

118 samples (one high outlier at 3.16 removed). The average SG for amphibolite (waste) is 

3.04 based on the 66 measurements. The SG measurements show low variability (standard 

deviation of 0.08, or 3% for pegmatite and 0.05 or 2% for amphibolite) indicating that the 

risk of significant error is low.  

 

The details of the SG statistics for resource estimation are given in Section 14 including data 

from the 2017 and 2018 drill programs. Table 11.4 gives a comparison between the original 

data utilized in resource estimation in 1999 and the SG values obtained in 2014. The data for 

the pegmatite illustrates that the two sets of data are statistically not significantly different, 

with the 1999 values lying within one standard deviation of the 2014 values.

12.0 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

12.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The resource estimation completed in 2018 is based on the original drilling by Avalon in 

1997 to 2001, assay database created by Micon in 1999 with additional drilling completed by 

Avalon in 2017 and 2018. There were certain QA/QC procedures applied and reported on at 

the time of creation of the database as summarized in Section 12.2 below. These procedures 

included check assays at a second laboratory and independent assaying by Micon. 

 

Subsequently, Avalon completed further verification of the drill data, given below in 

Sections 12.4 and 12.5. This included cross-checking the database against original field 

records such as drill logs, cross-checking the assays against laboratory assay certificates and 

re-assaying drill core splits with inserted internally certified lithium standards. Quality 

control procedures for recent drilling are covered in Sections 12.6 and 12.7. 

 

12.2 QUALITY CONTROL, 1990S 
 

As reported in Section 11.0, during the original drill program, 84 duplicate coarse rejects 

samples from drill core were submitted to Chemex, as a check laboratory. The results can 

then be compared with the primary samples analysed by XRAL (Pedersen, 1998a). 

 

Figure 12.1, Table 12.1, Figure 12.2 and Table 12.2 show the comparison of the XRAL and 

Chemex data sets. The two sets compare favourably for Li2O grades when Li2O grade is 

lower than approximately 1.5% but show an increasing amount of scatter above this grade. 

XRAL's Rb2O data were consistently lower than Chemex's.  

 

Avalon reported at the time (Pedersen, 1998a) that the discrepancies in lithium and rubidium 

assays may be due to differences in analytical techniques, especially for lithium, which was 

analysed by ICP at XRAL and by AA at Chemex. As rubidium was analysed by AA at both 

laboratories, Pedersen, 1998a, suggested that incomplete sample digestion and/or the use of 

different standards might be the reason for the differences in these results. 

 

However, there were other differences in the methods utilized besides the instruments. The 

XRAL analysis method utilized sodium peroxide fusion followed by ICP for Li and Ta and 

perchloric-nitric-HF digestion followed by AA for Rb and Cs. Chemex applied "Preparation 

Method 232" to the samples, where procedure 232 is reported as perchloric-nitric-HF acids 

digestion. Lithium was then analysed by AA and Rb by ICP-MS. The difference in initial 

steps of fusion (XRAL) and acid digestion (Chemex) was not discussed originally as a 

possible influence on differences between XRAL and Chemex analyses, but it is possible that 

different lithium bearing minerals, petalite, spodumene and lepidolite, may respond 

differently to fusion versus acid digestion. 

 



 
 

 95 

Assays classed as outliers (or 'bad repeats') in the graphs below, generated by DataShedTM 

and the associated Maxwell Geoservices software "QAQCReporter", meet the following 

criteria: 

1. Assay value is 10 times the lower detection limit. 

2. Assay Value is ≤10% different than the original assay.

Comparison of the original 1997 and 1998 XRAL assays vs. the field duplicates assayed by 

Chemex in 1998 yields a 2.8% difference in the means of the two laboratories' data for Li2O 

with Chemex higher than XRAL. Along with this small difference in the means, the 

correlation coefficient, R2, is high, at 93.25%, indicating strong correlation, and from the 

graph, there is almost no bias at any concentration level.

Comparison of the 1997 and 1998 XRAL assays with the field duplicates assayed by Chemex 

yields a 12.5% difference in the means of the two laboratories' data for Rb2O.This is a rather 



 
 

 97 

high difference in means, however, the R2 is high, at 96.21%, very strongly correlated, and 

from Figure 12.2, a small positive bias exists in Chemex compared to XRAL. This positive 

bias appears to increase at higher concentrations of Rb2O. 

 

In conclusion, despite some small differences, both the lithium and rubidium analyses from 

XRAL and Chemex are close and show similar trends with strong R2 scores for the 

correlation. This indicates high and acceptable reliability in the analyses. 

 

12.3 INDEPENDENT CHECK SAMPLING AND ASSAYING – 1999 
 

As an independent check on the results reported by Avalon, Micon collected a total of eight 

samples as due diligence portion of the original prefeasibility study (Micon, 1999). Of these 

check samples, five samples were of previously logged and assayed drill core and thus were 

drill core duplicates, two were of continuous chip samples from trench SLT-1 and one 

sample from Subunit 3b. These eight samples were regarded as being representative of the 

SRP petalite-bearing Subunits 6a, 6c and 6d. 

 

For the core samples, Micon removed the core from the boxes, noting the interval and box 

number and placed the sampled core into new plastic bags along with sequentially numbered 

assay tags. Trench samples were collected directly by Micon from trench SLT-1. The 

samples were hand carried by Micon's representative to Winnipeg and shipped by air as 

baggage to Toronto (Micon, 1999). 

 

Micon submitted the samples by courier to Chemex in Mississauga for check assay using 

ICP-MS for tantalum and rubidium and using AA for lithium. The results are shown in Table 

12.3.

The mean values for the drill core samples are 1.77% Li2O (Micon samples) and 1.68% Li2O 

(Avalon samples), which is a 5% difference. This is considered a very low level of difference 

for drill core duplicates. Micon stated in the 1999 Prefeasibility Study report (Micon, 1999) 

that it was satisfied that its check assay results corroborated, overall, the assay data reported

12.4 AVALON 2016 DATA VERIFICATION 
 

12.4.1 Database Checks 
 

Historic data currently contained in Avalon's Maxwell GeoServices DataShedTM database 

was sourced digitally from a database created by Micon in 1999. Micon provided the data to 

Avalon in Excel spreadsheets in 2011. A data verification process was undertaken to confirm 

that the source data from Micon are accurate and complete once they were imported into 

DataShedTM. The verification included comparison of assay values in DataShedTM versus the 

values reported on the original Certificates of Analysis, verification of values in the 'DH 

Collars' table of DataShedTM against the original drill hole logs and verification of location 

survey values. 

 

12.4.2 Original Assay Certificate Checks 
 

As of 6 July, 2016, the database contained records for 2,790 downhole samples which were 

assayed for the 1997, 1998 and 2001 drill programs. A random sampling of 12% of the assay 

values contained in DataShedTM were compared against the values as reported on the original 

certificates of analysis provided by XRAL. No errors were found in the downhole assay 

values as entered into DataShedTM from the original Micon database. 

 

It is to be noted that the assays entered in DataShedTM are reported as oxide percentages, 

while the original assays for drill programs are reported by element in parts per million 

(ppm). The conversion factors and calculations from element to oxide were also checked and 

accepted as accurate. 

 

The DataShedTM oxide entries, original assay element assays, and conversion factors are 

summarized in Table 12.4.

Rb2O Rb 1.094/10000*Element 

 

The assay values were exported from DataShedTM into an Excel spreadsheet which was used 

for the remainder of the verification work. Oxides converted to their elemental form were 

compared with the values as reported on the original Certificate of Analysis. A total of 271 

sample assays were selected for verification in this manner, over all, four of the reported 

elements. 

 

Trench samples were exported into Excel in the same manner. The trench samples begin with 

a global positioning system (GPS) location for the start of the trench, then a reading in 



 
 

 100 

metres, of distance to the next sample. As such, the trench samples were entered into 

DataShedTM as though they were drill holes.  

 

12.4.3 Re-assay of Drill Core in 2016 
 

12.4.3.1 Certified Standard 
 

Avalon prepared a certified rock lithium analysis standard by shipping 16 kg of SRP to CDN 

in Langley, British Columbia. CDN is a commercial laboratory that specializes in preparation 

of standards for the mineral exploration industry. The procedure included drying, crushing, 

grinding, screening and packaging the 16 kg sample. The result was 665 packages each 

containing 25 g of the standard material. A Round Robin analysis procedure was then 

completed with five samples of the material being shipped to each of six laboratories for 

lithium analysis, with associated analytical methods performed, with methods in bold font 

below applying to Li2O: 

1. Actlabs, Ancaster, ON: 

a. Ultratrace-7 Na2O2 fusion, both ICP-OES and ICP-MS finish. 

b. Code-8, 4-Acid Digestion with ICP-OES finish.   

2. Bureau Veritas, Vancouver, BC: 

a. PF370, Peroxide fusion ICP-ES finish. 

b. LF200 (Whole rock extended), Aqua Regia digest followed by ICP-ES/MS 
finish.  

3. AGAT Lab, Burnaby, BC: 

a. 201079 (Na2O2 digestion, ICP-OES finish). 

b. 201676 (whole rock). 

4. ALS, Vancouver, BC: 

a. CCP-PKG01, Trace elements reported from three digestions with either ICP-AES 
or ICP-MS finish: lithium borate fusion for the resistive elements (ME-MS81), a 

four-acid digestion for the base metals (ME-4ACD81) and an aqua regia 

digestion for gold related trace elements (ME-MS42). 

b. ME-ICP82b, Na2O2 Digestion, ICP finish. 

5. SGS, Lakefield, ON: 

a. GE ICM90A, Na2O2 Fusion, combined ICP-AES and ICP-MS finish. 

6. Intertek Genalysis, Perth, Australia: 

a. FB1/XRF, Fused Disk preparation for XRF, Analysed by XRF Spectrometry. 

b. FP1/MS, Sodium peroxide fusion (Zirconia crucibles) and Hydrochloric acid, 
ICP-MS finish. 

 

Previously certified Avalon rock standards, which have significant lithium values (developed 

for the East Kemptville Tin-Indium Project), were included with the subsamples of the 



 
 

 101 

proposed standard. However, these are rather low in lithium, of the order of 500 ppm, to be a 

future suitable standard for Separation Rapids Lithium Project analyses. However, these 

standards served as an additional quality control check on the Round Robin analysis results. 

 

The Round Robin yields the following results for the new Separation Rapids lithium rock 

analysis standard, using all laboratory assay values: 

 

Standard:    STD_SR2016 

Calculated mean:   1.4995 

Calculated standard deviation: 0.057 

Lower limit:    1.3856 

Upper limit:    1.6133 

 

Figure 12.5 shows the results of the 2016 Round Robin test. 

 
Figure 12.5  

Run Chart for Lithium for Standard in Round Robin Test – All Results, 2016 

 

 
 

As can be seen in Figure 12.5, all the assay values, with the exception of instances 31-35, are 

within a narrow band of 1.421% Li2O to 1.542% Li2O, which is itself well within 2 standard 

deviations as calculated using all 35 data points. Instances 31-35 were provided by one 

laboratory (referred to here as Lab E) utilizing ICP analysis which exceeded or close to 2 

standard deviations from the statistics for all six laboratories. 

 

The analysis was rerun, removing instances 31-35 from Lab E, and the run chart for this data 

is provided as Figure 12.6.  

 



 
 

 102 

Figure 12.6  

Run Chart of Lithium for Standard with One Laboratory Removed (2016) 

 

 
 

This yielded the following aggregate statistics: 

Standard:    STD_SR2016 

Calculated mean:   1.4882 

Calculated standard deviation: 0.039 

Lower limit:    1.4099 

Upper limit:    1.5665 

 

In the case with Lab E/ICP (but Lab E/Fusion retained) removed, the difference in the means 

of each remaining laboratory is small, a 1.29% decrease with removal of Lab E from the data 

set of all laboratories. The standard deviation also decreases by 42%, a significant change. 

All remaining laboratories' assay values used in Figure 12.6 are within two standard 

deviations of the mean of all data. 

  

The decision was made to accept the recalculated statistics for the values shown in Figure 

12.6 as the certified values for standard STD_SR2016. These certified values are reported in 

Table 12.5 as accepted mean 1.488% Li2O and a standard deviation of 0.039% Li2O, a 

relative standard deviation of 2% compared to 4% with all six laboratories (including Lab E).

It was concluded that the lithium standard was a suitable standard for QA/QC of Separation 

Rapids drill core samples. The certified value for the standard SR2016 is 1.488% Li2O with a 

standard deviation of 0.039% Li2O for future analyses of Separation Rapids samples. 

 

12.4.3.2 Core Re-analysis Using Certified Standard (2016) 
 

As the original assay procedure did not include the insertion of certified assay standards for 

lithium, Avalon completed a program of re-assaying a limited amount of drill core with the 

insertion of the certified lithium standard prepared as described above. The key points of this 

re-analysis involved: 

• At least 30 drill core samples. 

• Cover all subunits of the pegmatite lithology. 

• Samples would correspond to the sample intervals originally sampled. 
 

As long as these points were adhered to, it was considered that the results would be valid for 

comparing original assays with the 2016 assays. 

 

The procedure is described in Section 11.2 above and resulted in 42 quarter core samples 

which were submitted to ALS for analysis and can be compared to the assays from the 1990s. 

 

The comparison is shown in Figure 12.7 with the statistics given in Table 12.6.

The comparison of the original XRAL assay values reported by Pedersen (1998a) to the 2016 

core duplicates ("field resample") shows a small positive bias for the 2016 samples at smaller 

Li2O concentrations, crossing to an even smaller negative bias at higher Li2O concentrations. 

The regression line is virtually identical to the 45° line between 1.2% and 2% Li2O, which is 

where the majority of the mineralized samples lie. The mean values for each laboratory are 

identical at 1.42% Li2O, with a high R
2 of 92.23%. Further, the sRPHD, at -0.08, is an 

extremely low number compared to the mean values. This results in confirmation of the 

historic data by the subsequent re-analysis with inserted certified standards.

Comparison of the original XRAL assays with 2016 core duplicates for Rb2O shows the 

same bias trend as Li2O, positive at low Rb2O concentrations, turning negative at high 

concentrations. The mean of the two laboratories' data shows a small 5% difference (Table 

12.7), with an acceptable R2 of 85.09%. This is a higher difference than for lithium but is still 

very low and within acceptable range for core duplicates assayed at different laboratories 

with different methods. 

 

Along with the re-sampled drill core, four samples of the SR2016 internal certified standard 

were included with the 42 samples as part of the QA/QC process. The analyses are plotted in 

Figure 12.9. Note that the certified, acceptable results for the standard, as noted above, 



 
 

 106 

should lie within 1.48% Li2O with a standard deviation of 0.33, thus between 1.447% Li2O 

and 1.513% Li2O to be within one standard deviation. All of these values comply with this 

criterion.

12.5 DRILL HOLE COLLARS AND SURVEY DATA 
 

As noted in Section 10.0, all historic drilling was undertaken in the period 1997 to 2001. 

Between the 1997, 1998 and 2001 drill campaigns, 69 holes were drilled and sampled on the 

Separation Rapids property, as well as samples taken from five trenches. The drill hole data 

(hole number, depth, UTM location, azimuth, dip) in the DataShedTM database were 

compared to the data originally published in the 1998 Assessment Report (Pedersen, 1998a). 

The majority of the data were found to be identical and complete; however, there were some 

differences between the two data sources, which are discussed below.  

 

Holes were drilled using NQ-wireline (47.6 mm core). The holes, spaced 25 m apart, were 

drilled in the central and widest part of the SRP between sections 240W and 460W. All drill 

holes were inclined at either 45° or 60°. 

 

Downhole surveys, using a Tropari instrument, were carried out by Avalon, with 

measurements being taken at two or more regular down-hole intervals, with one of the 

measurements at the end of each hole. Infrequent acid tests also were completed.  

 

In the review of the Avalon database, drill hole angle and the maximum hole depth were both 

verified as being the same in the original report of Pedersen in 1998 and in the DataShedTM 

database. Elevation readings in metres in the database and drill logs are identical, with the 

exception of the third decimal place, which is not considered material. 

 

The comparison is summarized in Table 12.8.

None of the data sources state whether the UTM coordinates are in NAD83 or another 

standard. The differences do not correspond to the difference between NAD27 and NAD83. 

 

The location of the drill hole collars is noted in a number of available data sets. First, the 

original typed drill logs for the holes from 1997 to 1999 give the collar location both in the 

project grid and UTM coordinates. Second, data comprising project grid locations produced 

by a surveyor at the time is available from the data supplied by Micon from the original 

project digital drill database. Copies of hand-written surveyor's notations of UTM locations 

are available that appear to be surveyed UTM locations. Easting and northing coordinates 

were reported on original drill logs based on the local project grid ("mine grid") referred to as 

"AVL97", while the 2001 drill holes were reported both in AVL97 and UTM coordinates. In 

the database, all northings and eastings are tabulated in UTM coordinates. 

 

The latter records, representing 30 of the drill holes, when compared to the coordinates 

within the database, indicate some consistent differences that average 40.9 m in the easting 

and 3 m in the northing. The northing differences, at 3 m, are considered not to be material, 

but the easting difference is material. However, records indicate that this table of UTM 

locations was, in fact, derived by manually plotting the drill holes on a government 

topographic map and scaling off the UTM coordinates. This method is not considered 

accurate or precise and, thus, it is the likely explanation of the UTM discrepancy. 

 

12.5.1 Drill Hole Collar Location Verification Using Handheld GPS (2016) 
 

In 2016, Avalon identified four drill holes in the field by locating the drill collar casing 

protruding from the ground. Utilizing a hand-held GPS, the UTM location of each drill hole 

was measured. These locations are compared with the surveyed coordinates in the 

DataShedTM database as per Table 12.9.

Mean difference     -3.6 2.5 

 

As can be seen, the difference between the database coordinates and handheld GPS are 

minor, being in the range of 1.6 m to 5.1 m, which considering the inherent inaccuracies of a 

handheld GPS are acceptable. According to the United States Geological Survey 

(www.water.usgs.gov/osw/gps/), the accuracy of a handheld GPS is within 3 m to 10 m 

depending on the model. In addition, the differences given here are systematic with a slight 

negative for the easting and positive for northing. It is important to note that the handheld 

GPS was set to give UTM readings in NAD83 (Zone 15). As a result, it was verified that the 

readings in the database are NAD83 readings (Zone 15), which was the system current at the 

time of its creation. 

 

This concordance between the database UTM location and the check readings in 2016 results 

in the conclusion that the drill hole locations in the digital database are correct and reliable. It 

also demonstrates that the UTM coordinates on the hand-written surveyor sheets that have 

the 40 m consistent difference are in error due to the manual scaling methodology utilized. 

 

12.5.2 Drill Hole Collar Location Re-Surveys (2017) 
 

For the holes drilled in 2001, only locations obtained from a handheld GPS had been 

recorded and added to the Project database. Hence Avalon commissioned a re-survey of their 

collars in 2017 and also verified some of the collars of the holes drilled in 1997 and 1998 

(Table 12.10). The 2017 location surveys were performed by Eric Rody of Rugged 

Geomatics of Kenora, certified Ontario Land Surveyor and Canada Lands Surveyor, using a 

Trimble RTK system consisting of two R8 receivers and high-powered radio coupled to a 

TS2 data collector. The accuracy of the collar location surveys was estimated at 0.02 m in the 

vertical and horizontal directions. Not all 2001 collars could be located in the field, likely 

because the casings have been removed. 

 

The seven 2001 drill holes that were located in the field show deviations from the database 

values ranging from -2.1 to 1.0 m, 6.5 to 3.8 m and -3.4 to 0.6 m for the eastings, northings 

and elevations, respectively. The largest deviations are thus found for the northings. The 

database has been updated with the new survey values obtained in 2017. 

 

For the six re-surveyed 1997 and 1998 drill holes, the deviations are smaller and range from 

0.7 to 1.0 m, 0.0 to 0.4 m and -1.2 to 0.1 m. These differences are relatively minor and are

considered acceptable with regards to the evolution of survey accuracy between 1997-1998 

and 2017.

12.6.1 External Standards 
 

12.6.1.1 Avalon's Standard 
 

Avalon has prepared a certified analytical standard for the Project utilizing rock material 

from the SRLD. This analytical standard, SR2016, was created from rock collected from the 

SRLD outcrop, prepared at CDN Laboratory in British Columbia and was subjected to a 

Round Robin involving six independent laboratories in Canada and Australia. The certified 

value for the standard based on the round robin is 1.488 ± 0.039 wt.% Li2O (1 σ). 



 
 

 110 

 

Together with the drill core assay batches, powders of Avalon's lithium standard were 

analyzed (Figure 12.10) with one standard inserted per 25 samples. Overall, the values range 

between 1.5% and +5.0% from the expected value (-0.022 wt. % Li2O to +0.075 wt. % 

Li2O), which is within the 2σ range of the standard value (±7.6%). Batch TB18043795 shows 

a slightly stronger positive average bias (+2.4%) compared to batch TB17103883 (+1.9%, 

Figure 12.10). For the entire data set, there is a small positive bias in the analyses compared 

to the previously established standard values (+2.0% or +0.030 wt. % Li2O). This bias is 

considered by Avalon to be acceptable for resource estimation purposes.

Laboratory Value

12.6.1.2 Standards Run by the Laboratory 
 

The reproducibility of the reference values for lithium in standards with certified ore-grade 

concentrations (NCSDC86303, NCSDC86304, SRM 181, SRM-183; Li2O = 0.459 to 

6.39 wt. %) using method OG63 for both batches is between -4.3% and +3.2% and 

averages -1.0%. The reproducibility is considered acceptable. Using the ICP-MS method 

ME-4ACD81, the deviations from the certified standard values range between -11.5% and 

32.7%, averaging 2.9% (corresponding to absolute values between -326 and +94 ppm, 

averaging -14 ppm), with three outliers at +16.3 ppm and twice -12.6 ppm for standards with 

33.7 and 22.6 ppm, respectively. 

 

For Cs, Rb and Ta, the deviation from the reference values of standards AMIS0085, 

AMIS0167, AMIS0304 and SY-4 (all contain these elements in trace concentrations) ranges 

from -22% to +34% and averages + 3%, excluding one aberrant analysis of the AMIS0304 



 
 

 111 

standard and excluding the Ta concentrations measured for AMIS0304, which are all 119 to 

149% higher than the provisional reference value (10.92 ppm). This is likely a problem 

related to the provisional data of this standard, as the other standards were reproduced 

adequately. 

 

12.6.2 Field Blanks 
 

As a field blank, inserted after every 40 samples, silica sand was used (Silica Sand used was 

manufactured by FMC Corporation and sold by McNunn and Yates, Kenora). In all field 

blank analyses (N = 10), lithium was at or below the detection limits of the analytical 

methods (10 ppm for method ME-MS81), Rb ≤ 23.3 ppm, Cs ≤ 0.76 ppm and Ta ≤ 0.4 ppm. 

There is thus no evidence for the contamination or switching of samples. 

 

12.6.3 Laboratory Blanks 
 

The laboratory blanks were at or below the detection limit for lithium via method OG63 (50 

ppm) and method ME-MS81 (10 ppm). Rubidium in most of the blanks was below 0.2 ppm 

(the detection limit); two exceptions were recorded with 0.3 and 0.4 ppm. Tantalum was at or 

below the detection limit of 0.1 ppm in all but one of the blanks (0.2 ppm). The blanks for 

cesium were lower than 0.06 ppm (detection limit 0.01 ppm). These results indicate that 

cross-sample contamination did not affect the laboratory analyses. 

 

12.6.4 Within Laboratory Duplicates 
 

The laboratories conducted duplicate analyses of prepared pulps in both analytical batches. 

For the lithium analyses using the ICP-MS method ME-4ACD81, the duplicates were 

reproduced with deviations from the first assay between -1.6% and +7.0% with an average of 

+0.8%. For the ICP-OES method OG63, the lithium analyses of the duplicates were between 

-2.1% and +5.1%, averaging 0.5%. For Rb, Cs and Ta, the deviations of the duplicate 

analyses were +1.7% on average and ranged from -21.7 to +30.6%, excluding a single outlier 

for Ta with repeat analyses of 0.1 and 0.2 ppm (equivalent to a 100% relative deviation). The 

largest deviations were observed for trace concentrations. These laboratory duplicate results 

are considered acceptable by Avalon. 

 

12.6.5 Core Duplicates 
 

Four core duplicates of medium- to high-grade samples were randomly chosen and analyzed 

to evaluate the reproducibility of the assay data and the presence or absence of bias in 

sampling, i.e., during the core splitting process. Core duplicates comprised the second half of 

previously sampled drill core. Standards and blanks in the same sample batch as the 

duplicates showed no values outside the acceptable range. Given the nature of the 

mineralization with relatively even grade distribution and lack of domination of veining in a 

barren substrate, sampling bias would be expected to be very low. 

 



 
 

 112 

The duplicate assays show a good reproducibility for lithium (-8 to +3% difference between 

original and duplicate sample) and acceptable reproducibility for Rb, Cs and Ta (-30 to 

+26%) for three of the samples (Table 12.12). One sample (drill hole SR17-73 from 279 to 

281 m) however, shows a large deviation of +63% from the original assay for lithium (the 

other elements show moderate deviations within the range of the other samples). Notably, 

this sample has a significantly lower lithium concentration than the other three samples. 

Inspection of the corresponding drill core photos of this samples showed coarse patchy 

petalite + spodumene, indicating that nuggety mineralization may be responsible for the 

higher lithium concentration due to sample inhomogeneity. 

 

The data indicate that in three out of four randomly chosen medium- to high-grade core 

duplicate samples, there is no bias in the lithium grade due to the core splitting. However, in 

one of the four core duplicates (a sample with an atypical nuggety texture), there is a 

significant bias with the duplicate being 63% higher than the original assay.

With the exception of one outlier, the results of this work indicate that there is no significant 

sampling bias (Table 12.12). In fact, the average of the original analyses is slightly lower 

than the duplicate core samples (0.711 vs. 0.774 wt. %, Table 12.12), indicating that there 

was no positive bias in the sampling. 

 

12.6.6 Pulp Duplicates 
 

Five Li-mineralized drill core pulp samples (Li = 0.80 - 0.92 wt. %), which were selected by 

Avalon, were re-analyzed in a separate assay batch by ALS using method OG63 in batch 

TB17138018. The reproducibility for lithium was better than 1.2% in all cases and 0.7% on 

average. 

 

12.6.7 Reject Duplicates Analyzed by the Secondary Laboratory 
 

Fifty-one reject duplicates of mineralized rock were analyzed by a secondary laboratory, 

SGS Canada Inc. Instructions to the primary laboratory were to prepare a second 250 g split 

off the 90% passing 2 mm crushed material using a riffle splitter on every tenth core sample 

and then pulverize this. These were shipped to Avalon, where standards were inserted, and 

the samples sent to the secondary laboratory. 



 
 

 113 

 

By using the reject material, the variance includes sample heterogeneity after the second 

crushing stage and potential contamination in the crushing stage in addition to analytical 

factors. The analyses show that there is no substantial systematic bias in the lithium 

concentration (with an overall average difference of -1.5% relative to the primary laboratory) 

and that the average absolute deviation is 13%, a value deemed acceptable (Figure 12.11, 

Figure 12.12). Four outliers among the duplicates with >30% deviations (included in the 

calculated mean) deviate by -85.5%, +77.2%, -37.3%, and +67.5% relative to the lithium 

assays by the primary laboratory (Figure 12.11, Figure 12.12). The fact that these differences 

are two positives and two negatives suggest this is a random effect and not bias. Similarity 

among the other measured elements precludes the possibility that the sample were switched 

accidentally. Hence, the deviations are due to sample heterogeneity and measurement errors. 

 

For Rb, there are 8 duplicate samples with deviations between 21 and 65%; one duplicate 

deviates by 159%. The average absolute deviation is 22%. Despite these elevated deviation 

values, there is no significant systematic bias; the duplicate analyses are on average -1.9% 

lower than those of the primary laboratory. The duplicate analyses for Cs are on average 16% 

lower than those by the primary laboratory and the absolute deviations average 21%. The 

large deviation and negative bias are likely due to the low concentrations of Cs (2.9-342 

ppm, one sample with 2495 ppm) and possibly an analytical problem. Tantalum (also present 

in low concentrations, 1-134 ppm) is on average 1.3% lower than in the analyses by the 

primary lab (i.e., a very small negative bias) and the average of the absolute deviations is 

30%.

12.7 DRILL HOLE AZIMUTHS 
 

12.7.1 Historic Data 
 

Azimuths in the DataShedTM database were found to be consistently 1.8794° higher than the 

readings as reported in Pedersen 1998a. On examining the data from the original 2002 

database, it was clear that the azimuths were referred to as "corrected" and 1.8794° were 

added to all originally recorded azimuths. This is very close to the correction for magnetic 

north in December, 1999, in the Separation Rapids area. However, it is not clear that the 

correction should have been applied as the azimuths in the original drill logs are reportedly 

true azimuths relative to true north (Pedersen, 2016b). At present, this is not considered a 

material issue as a difference of two degrees in azimuth is not material to resource estimation 

and, also, the difference is consistent for all drill holes. 

 

12.7.1.1 Collar Dip and Azimuth Verification Using a Handheld Compass 
 

In 2016, for the same four drill holes as discussed above (Table 12.9) with regards to survey 

locations, and using the casing still present, the azimuths were measured using a clinometer-

equipped Suunto compass by Avalon staff, and the results are compared in Table 12.13 with 

the azimuths in the drill logs and those in the database information provided by Micon. The 

Suunto compass had been adjusted by the appropriate magnetic declination. 

 
Table 12.13

98-53 174 180 181.88 6 7.88 

 

The accuracy and precision of the Suunto compass is not sufficient to compare the azimuths 

quantitatively in detail. In addition, it is possible that the casings are not in their original 

orientations. However, it is worth noting that the orientations measured in 2016 are closer to 

those in the drill logs than the "corrected" database readings. Avalon believes that it was 

assumed that the azimuths on the original drill logs from the 1990s drilling were relative to 

magnetic north and that 1.8794° was the declination adjustment at the time. However, 

Avalon now considers this to be an error and that the drill holes were in fact intended to be 

oriented due south, not magnetic south. 

 

12.7.1.2 Collar Dip and Azimuth Verification Using Survey-Grade GPS 
 

Using an insert for the drill hole collars, Eric Rody of Rugged Geomatics of Kenora, certified 

Ontario Land Surveyor and Canada Lands Surveyor, measured two points along the extended 

collars and calculated the azimuths and dips from the spatial difference of the two points 



 
 

 116 

(Table 12.14). The survey methods have been outlined in Section 12.5.2. The accuracy of 

this approach has been estimated to be 52 arc minutes or 0.87 decimal degrees by E. Rody 

for both dip and azimuth.

SR98-53 -50 -46.8 3.2 178.1 175.6 -2.5 

 

The deviations from the values in the database range from 1.4 to 4.0° and average 2.5° for 

the dips and from 5.5 to 4.4°, averaging -0.2° for the azimuths with one outlier at -17.4° for 

drill hole SR97-03, which has been excluded from the calculation of the average (Table 

12.13). There are a number of error sources that could cause the difference between the 

historic and the 2017 dip and azimuth surveys, including original measurement errors, 

modifications of the casing immediately after drilling and accidental/natural modifications 

between 1998 and 2017. For the outlier with an azimuth deviation of 17.4°, a modification of 

the casing is the most likely cause. Nevertheless, the reproducibility of the azimuths is 

overall excellent. For the dips, it should be noted that the measured values are consistently 

flatter than those recorded in the database. However, the average difference of 2.5° is 

considered acceptable considering that the collar dip was likely not measured originally but 

set by the drill contractor. 

 

For the resource estimates prepared by Avalon in 2017 and 2018, the azimuths of the historic 

holes were converted from the original values (which were measured relative to local 

exploration grid north in 1997 and 1998, and likely relative to geographic north in 2001) into 

values relative to UTM grid north by applying the appropriate grid declinations. 

 

12.7.2 Drill Programs 2017-2018 
 

The downhole azimuth and inclination were surveyed using a magnetic Devishot multi-shot 

tool (Devico) at intervals of 6 m. Measurements for which a disturbance of the normal 

magnetic field was indicated were removed from the data set. Magnetic reference data was 

obtained from the NRCAN calculator (http://geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/calc/mfcal-en.php) using 

http://geomag.nrcan.gc.ca/calc/mfcal-en.php


 
 

 117 

the decimal degree coordinates 50.263446, -94.565650. The approximate values for the total 

intensity of magnetic vector and its inclination are 57100 nT and 75.2°, respectively. The 

following thresholds were used for deciding which data were disturbed: 

• A deviation of >1000 nT for the magnetic vector. 

• A >1.5° deviation for the inclination of the gravity vector (indicates measurements 
that were taken while the instrument was moving). A 2% deviation from the drill hole 

average was used to eliminate potentially erroneous values. 

 

Other outlier values were also removed, e.g. >1° variations of azimuth or dip over 6 m 

intervals. The measured azimuths were corrected using the magnetic declination relative to 

geographic north, 0.7°, and the UTM grid convergence, -1.35°. The azimuths are thus given 

relative to UTM grid north. 

 

For the 2017 drill holes, this procedure resulted in the removal of ~19% of the downhole 

survey data (Table 12.15). There was sufficient data left in all cases to confidently estimate 

the downhole parameters for each hole. The dips of the holes generally flattened, and the 

azimuths curved in a dextral sense, i.e., with the drill rotation (Table 12.15). Verification of 

the downhole surveys for drill hole SR17-74 using a Reflex EZShot downhole survey tool 

indicates generally good reproducibility, except for a zone of magnetic disturbance (Figure 

12.13). As an additional quality control, the drill hole casing azimuths and dips were 

measured using a custom GPS apparatus by Rugged Geomatics of Kenora. The 

reproducibility is generally acceptable, except for drill hole SR17-73 (Table 12.16). This can 

be attributed to a disturbance of the casing by the bulldozer following drilling.

13.0 MINERAL PROCESSING AND METALLURGICAL TESTING 
 

13.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

A number of phases of metallurgical testing since 1997 have been completed by Avalon 

using samples obtained from of the SRLD. The work prior to 2014 was mainly undertaken by 

SGS Mineral Services at Lakefield, Ontario (SGS-L). This work not only included the 

recovery of petalite, but also a number of other mineral products which also can be found in 

the lithium bearing pegmatite. 

 

The work since 2014 has focussed on the recovery of a petalite flotation concentrate and the 

subsequent processing of this concentrate to produce a high-quality lithium hydroxide 

product suitable for the lithium battery industry.  However, more recent testwork has been 

completed in the separation of petalite, lepidolite and feldspars into separate saleable 

concentrates. 

 

13.2 HISTORICAL METALLURGICAL INVESTIGATIONS (PRE-2014) 
 

13.2.1 SGS-L (1997-1999 and 2009) 
 

An initial metallurgical testwork program was undertaken at SGS-L between 1997 and 2009.  

 

The initial phase of this work began in November, 1997, with the objective of producing a 

high grade petalite product. The following information was gleaned from this testwork 

program: 

• Overgrinding the feed and producing large amounts of fines would be detrimental to 
flotation recoveries. Thus, comminution and classification are important unit 

operations of the flotation plant. 

• Iron is an important impurity in the final product and use of steel grinding media may 
increase the amount iron in the circuit. 

• Use of hydrofluoric acid (HF) as a collector for petalite during flotation was required 
although a sodium fluoride and hydrochloric acid mix was potentially a suitable 

replacement for HF.  

 

The flowsheet developed recovered both a high and low grade petalite concentrate from the 

SRLD at 4.63% and 2.47% Li2O respectively, as well as a 5% Li2O spodumene concentrate. 

 

13.2.1.1 SGS-L (2009) 
 

Avalon successfully completed a metallurgical process research project in 2009 to develop a 

modified petalite process flowsheet, using sodium fluoride and hydrochloric acid as an 

alternative to hydrofluoric acid. This work was carried out at SGS-L using a 660 kg 

mineralized sample with an average grade of 1.52% Li2O. This program developed a 



 
 

 120 

flotation process to recover separate concentrates of mica, petalite, sodium feldspar, 

potassium feldspar and spodumene from the SRLD. 

 

13.3 RECENT METALLURGICAL TESTWORK 
 

Following renewed interest in the Separation Rapids Lithium Project in 2013 and 2014, 

Avalon was requested by potential customers to provide fresh samples of petalite 

concentrate. However, attempts by SGS-L to reproduce the results from 2009 were 

unsuccessful. 

 

Avalon approached ANZAPLAN to develop a process for recovering the petalite and 

achieving target product grade of >4% Li2O. ANZAPLAN also investigated the recovery of a 

separate lithium mica product and a low impurity feldspar by-product and tested these 

products to determine their suitability in a number of industrial applications. 

 

With the increasing demand for lithium chemicals to satisfy the growth in the battery and 

energy storage industries, Avalon investigated the potential to use petalite as a source of both 

lithium carbonate and hydroxide. Initial investigations for producing carbonate were 

completed by the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) and subsequently by Thibault and 

Associates Inc. (Thibault), which developed the process for producing lithium hydroxide.

13.3.2 Preliminary Physical Separation Testwork 
 

In late 2013, Avalon sent a small mineralized sample to ANZAPLAN to investigate 

producing a petalite concentrate containing >4.0% Li2O with a low iron content (<100 ppm). 

An analysis of the sample is presented in Table 13.2.

The sample was a mix of coarse and fine grained pegmatitic rock. Since the degree of 

mineral inter-growth for the coarse and fine grained texture differed, sensor based sorting 

was used in order to separate coarse grained material (CGO) from the fine grained material 

(FGO). Figure 13.1 presents the procedure used to separate the CGO and FGO and Table 

13.3 presents a summary of the feed sample and product analyses.

A comparison of the FGO and CGO modal mineralogy for two size fractions is presented in 

Table 13.4. For both size fractions, the modal analysis shows higher proportions of petalite 

and K-feldspar and lower proportions of mica, quartz and Na-feldspar in the CGO compared 

to FGO.

A comparison of the liberation showed >90% liberation for all minerals for the fine size 

fraction and around 90% liberation of petalite and feldspar in the coarser fraction (0.1-0.3 

mm) for both the FGO and CGO.   

 

13.3.2.1 Tests Using CGO 
 

Following some scoping tests, a magnetic separation plus flotation circuit was developed 

which was able to produce a petalite concentrate grading 4.09% Li2O with iron content 

below 0.01% Fe2O3. The flotation recovery of petalite to this product for both the 0.1-0.3 mm 

fraction and the 0.02 to 0.1 mm fraction were approximately 74-75%, based on the flotation 

feed. 

 

The recovery of feldspar from the petalite tailings was investigated using a specific reagent 

suite and approximately 84% and 72% of the feldspar feeding this circuit were recovered into 

a feldspar concentrate for the coarse fraction and fine fraction, respectively. 

 

13.3.2.2 Tests Using FGO 

 

Since the degree of intergrowth of iron bearing and valuable minerals is higher in the fine-

grained mineralization, a separate program of testwork was conducted using this material. A 

beneficiation process based on the CGO tests was used as the basis for the FGO test program. 



 
 

 124 

Using a similar flowsheet to the coarse-grained mineralization, a petalite concentrate 

assaying 4.0% Li2O and <0.01% Fe2O3 was achieved, albeit with relatively low flotation 

recoveries of around 20% and 41% for the 0.1-0.3 mm and 0.02-0.3 mm size fractions, 

respectively. 

 

The feldspar flotation tests, using the CGO test procedure, were also completed using the 

FGO sample fraction. These results were similar to the CGO tests with high feldspar yields 

into a concentrate containing <0.01% Fe2O3. 

 

It was concluded during this phase of the flowsheet development testwork that optical sorting 

will be required to remove the gangue mineral amphibolite ahead of the flotation process as 

this also reports to the petalite concentrate making the target Li2O grade difficult to achieve. 

 

13.3.2.2 FGO Locked Cycle Tests 
 

The two size fractions (0.1-0.3 mm and 0.02-0.3 mm) were combined for the Locked Cycle 

Tests (LCT) using FGO material. The objective of the LCT was to try and improve the 

relatively low petalite recoveries achieved during the FGO flotation static tests.   

 

Using a slightly modified flowsheet, the LCT did produce a 4.0% Li2O petalite concentrate 

with less than 0.01% Fe2O3. The flotation recovery was approximately 50%, which was an 

improvement. 

 

13.3.3 Magnetic Separation Tests 
 

In order to optimize the magnetic separation process, samples of Separation Rapids 

mineralization were sent to Metso in Sala, Sweden, for extensive testing to determine optimal 

magnetic separator machine settings and matrix selection. A total of 28 tests were carried out 

on 3 samples at different size fractions, at varying matrix loads and flushing rates. Table 13.5 

compares the best Metso results with the results achieved by ANZAPLAN using similar 

material. 

 

The test results suggest that combining the two size fractions for magnetic separation yields 

similar results to feeding each size fraction separately and that a setup based on Metso Test 

HGMS 24-1 using a single stage unit with medium matrix will provide the best results.

13.3.4 Filtration Tests 
 

There are a number of key filtration stages in the flowsheet, including filtration for reagent 

recycle as well as dewatering of flotation feed, petalite rougher tails, petalite second cleaner 

concentrate and petalite fourth cleaner concentrate. Washing of the final concentrates during 

filtration was also deemed important to remove extra salt and reduce final fluorine levels. 

Materials for testing were prepared and the tests were conducted at an equipment 

manufacturer in Germany. The filtration testwork results are presented in Table 13.6.

13.3.5 Ceramic Application Tests 
 

To review the suitability of using Avalon's petalite and feldspar in the ceramic market, 

ANZAPLAN conducted the following ceramic application tests: 

• Hot Stage Microscopy: to analyze melting behavior of the material. 

• Dilatometry: to measure volume changes in the material as it melts at high 
temperatures. 

• Firing colour: to determine firing colour of the material as it melts. 
 

Based on the results of these tests on the petalite and feldspar concentrates, the samples were 

deemed suitable for the following possible applications in ceramics: 



 
 

 126 

• Glazes and frits within the respective range of firing temperature between 1,150°C 
and 1,300°C. 

• A source of lithium for heat-resistant glass and cookware. 

• Sintering agent in ceramic body material for the production of stoneware and 
porcelain. 

• A non-plastic material or as alternative/replacement of chamotte in ceramic bodies for 
earthenware or other low-fired ceramic materials. 

 

A potential additional application for petalite is to reduce the coefficient of thermal 

expansion in ceramic bodies and glazes. 

 

13.3.6 One Tonne Petalite Concentrate Production Test 
 

In August, 2015, Avalon engaged ANZAPLAN to produce one tonne of petalite concentrate, 

using the flowsheet and conditions developed from previous tests. For this test program, the 

coarse and fine grained mineralized samples were combined.  

 

Approximately 30 t of crushed mineralized sample, sized 8-25 mm, was delivered to 

Germany for processing in a pilot plant facility. The sample was first wet screened to remove 

any -6 mm material, optically sorted to remove dark coloured gangue minerals then crushed 

to -0.3 mm and classified to remove -0.1 mm fines before undergoing magnetic separation to 

remove iron minerals using a Metso unit. Non-magnetic material was then forwarded to 

petalite flotation with the objective to produce a >4.0% Li2O low iron petalite product. 

 

The flotation pilot plant was initially set-up to recycle the brine streams to minimize flotation 

reagent consumptions. However, selectivity issues in the rougher flotation stages prevented 

the production of a suitable petalite product at reasonable recoveries. Following some 

additional bench scale testing the pilot test continued with reduced collector dosages and 

open circuit production without brine recirculation and the 1 tonne sample of petalite 

concentrate was successfully produced. The analysis of the petalite concentrate is presented 

in Table 13.7.

Subsequent investigations identified a number of key recommendations which needed to be 

incorporated into the flotation circuit. These included the following: 

• Grind top size should be reduced from 0.3 mm to around 0.25 mm. 

• HF dosage to be controlled by flotation feed tonnage and not simply by slurry pH. 

• Some of the recycled water will need to be neutralized before recycling in order to 
control pH. 

• It will be necessary to partially remove dissolved ions (especially Al, S, Mg, Ca) in 
the recycle water as these tend to interfere with the flotation chemistry as their 

concentration increases. 

• Collector dosage needs to be reduced. 
 

The effectiveness of these changes was determined during a subsequent test program 

(discussed below). 

 

13.3.7 Feldspar Filler Tests 
 

The potential to use the feldspar concentrate filler for the paint and other industries was 

investigated by ANZAPLAN. The material was milled to three different product sizes (50% 

passing size (d50) of 2.5, 6.3 and 23 µm) and analyzed for a number of physical 

characteristics.   

 

The results from these tests were considered promising although the two finer products 

contained slightly elevated amounts (1.3% and above) of size-weighted respirable crystalline 

silica (SWERFcs) which could possibly be reduced during flotation by introducing additional 

cleaner stages. A SWERFcs value greater than 1% means that the material is classified as 

hazardous. 

 

A sample of the d50 6.3 µm material was also tested as filler in a number of actual 

commercial indoor paint recipes (2 German and 1 US) and compared to a commercially 

available material currently being used as paint filler. Avalon's material compared 

favourably showing almost the same results with regards rheology, density, brightness, 

colour, scrub resistance and gloss. 

 

The feldspar used to produce the above filler products was recovered from a simple rougher-

only flotation circuit so ANZAPLAN then produced a feldspar concentrate through a process 



 
 

 128 

involving cleaner stages. The impact of this was a reduction in silica content of the 

concentrate from 2% to 1.5%, plus a final SWERFcs value of 0.6% after grinding to a d50 of 

6 µm. 

13.3.8 Petalite Recovery Optimization Testwork Program 
 

A two-part testwork program was completed to further investigate the effect of certain 

individual process parameters on flotation results following observations made during the 

one-tonne petalite production pilot. The first part of the study was to analyse the tailings 

produced from the one-tonne petalite pilot plant to identify and quantify causes for sub-

optimal flotation performance. The second part of the program reviews various flotation 

parameters and adjusts them to optimise the flotation process.  

 

13.3.8.1 Examination of Flotation Tailings 
 

Samples of the flotation feed material, and three different tailings batches were collected 

from the one tonne petalite pilot plant. The material was sieved and separated into five 

different grain size fractions to analyze for lithium content. It was shown that petalite content 

increased with increasing particle size, indicating reduced petalite flotation efficiency in the 

coarser fractions. Mineralogy of the various sized fraction samples can be seen below in 

Figure 13.2. 

 
Figure 13.2  

Comparison of Modal Mineralogy of Tailings (Individual Size Fractions) 

 

 
 

Liberation of the individual minerals was also examined, which showed that the petalite 

liberation was good, ranging between approximately 91-93 % in all size fractions. Thus, it 

was concluded that petalite liberation was not the reason for the poor flotation performance.  



 
 

 129 

 

From the mineralogical investigation of the tailings, it was recommended to reduce the top 

particle size of flotation feed and use a narrower particle size distribution to improve flotation 

efficiency.  

 

The optimization program also investigated the impact of water recycling on flotation 

performance as the pH gradually dropped over time. The following conclusions were 

reached: 

• At least part of the flotation water has to be removed from the circuit and neutralized 
to adjust the pH-value in the flotation circuit (to maintain a steady value). 

• pH cannot be used to regulate HF dosage, which was the previous practice. HF has to 
be added at fixed dosage rates based on added solids (tph). 

• Assays of the process water show the concentration of the following elements Al, Si, 
Ca, Mg, Na and K in solution gradually increase. 

• Neutralization can remove or reduce most of the dissolved elements in the process 
water and may be a potential solution for recycling of the process water.   

• Collector dosages should be reduced to 10% when operating in a closed circuit, to 
maintain a constant collector concentration in the flotation feed.  

 

13.3.8.2 Petalite Flotation Optimization 
 

Following the work completed on pilot plant petalite flotation tailings, a more detailed 

testwork program using fresh ore was undertaken to confirm previous results. Table 13.8 

below lists the parameters investigated and the results and recommendations from the 

optimized tests.  

 
Table 13.8  

Flotation Operating Parameters Investigated 

 

Parameter Results / Recommendations 

Grind size Reducing grind size to 150 micron from 300 improved Li2O recovery in the rougher 

scavenger stage from 60 to 71 wt.%.  

Collector dosage A collector dosage of 700 g/t in the rougher scavenger stage  

Frother dosage A frother dosage of 60 g/t in rougher-scavenger stage is recommended for petalite 

flotation 

Hydrofluoric acid dosage HF dosage in the rougher-scavenger stage can be reduced to 2,000 g/t without negative 

effect on the flotation results 

Brine concentration Brine concentration can be reduced to 8% in petalite flotation 

Temperature Temperature of flotation slurry is recommended to be maintained between 10 and 

22°C. Elevated temperatures adversely affect lithium recovery. 

Cell agitator speed Increasing agitator speed leads to a decrease in lithium oxide recovery.  

Alteration of ore over time A flotation test with a sample which was stored over 10 weeks in water was conducted 

to evaluate if alteration may have a negative influence. A slightly negative effect on 

recovery (5 percentage points) was observed therefore storage of processed 

intermediate products prior to flotation in wet state should be avoided 



 
 

 130 

Parameter Results / Recommendations 

Water recirculation with 

and without water treatment 

In water recirculation tests flotation performance gradually declined without water 

treatment and the pH value decreased from cycle to cycle from 2.0 down to 1.3. 

However, tests with water treatment using calcium hydroxide to neutral pH, flotation 

performance remained steady. Therefore, water treatment of the recirculated water is 

recommended.  

Attrition scrubbing When applying attrition scrubbing, lithium recovery in the rougher-scavenger stage (at 

comparable Li2O grades in the concentrate) was improved from 71 wt. % (2.2 wt. % 

Li2O) to 78 wt. % (2.3 wt. % Li2O). 

 

13.3.8.3 Testwork Confirmation 
 

Following the mineralogical and process optimization testwork, ANZAPLAN conducted 

additional flotation tests incorporating all the recommendations in order to confirm the 

flotation results. 

 

The sample was ground to a P80 of 150 µm and deslimed at 20 µm. The flotation then 

followed the following flowsheet in Figure 13.3 below. In total, 4 tests were conducted with 

the 150 µm material. Table 13.9 shows the conditions for each of the tests conducted.

F3 2000 g/t HF in Rougher Scavenger with 8 wt. % brine 

F5 2000 g/t equivalent HF using NaF/HCl in Rougher Scavenger with 8 wt. % brine 

 

The first flotation stages (rougher, scavenger, cleaners 1 and 2) are used to reject feldspar and 

were conducted in KCl/NaCl brine using the mixture of Flotigam K2C (70%) and PEG-oleate 

(30%) as collectors. After the second cleaner stage, the intermediate petalite concentrate was 

filtered, washed with water and fed to final cleaner stages 3 and 4. Here the remaining quartz 

is removed to produce a final petalite concentrate. These sections were conducted in water 

(as opposed to brine) using Flotigam 4343 as collector. 

 

HF is an activator for petalite and was added in all flotation stages. As an alternative to HF, 

sodium fluoride (NaF) and hydrochloric acid was tested. The NaF dosage was adjusted to 

introduce an equal amount of fluorine as compared to HF addition. Table 13.10 shows a 

summary of the results in each of the four flotation tests.

Note: recoveries indicated for "Cleaner Concentrate" are for open circuit tests and do not reflect final recoveries 

achievable with the recycling of cleaner tailings. 

 

These test results suggest that brine dosage can be reduced to 8% from 10% for petalite 

flotation tests but using NaF/HCl as a substitute for HF will require additional optimization 

studies if it is to be considered a viable alternative as the results when using HF tended to be 

better.  

 

13.3.8.4 Process Water Recycling 
 

Water recycling and neutralization with calcium hydroxide to pH 7 was also investigated as 

part of the optimization study. With the neutralization around pH 7, the selectivity with 

regard to feldspar rejection was reduced. To remedy this, neutralization pH was reduced to 

5.5 and recycling tests were carried out to assess the impact on recovery and grade of lithium 

oxide. After each cycle of neutralization, the solution was filtered prior to being recycled for 

flotation.  

 

In all, nine cycles were completed using standard flotation conditions for each cycle. Petalite 

rougher and scavenger flotation stages were carried out in all cycles with cleaner stages  

 

The rougher and scavenger flotation results suggested that even with water treatment there is 

a slight decrease in overall rougher/scavenger Li2O recovery over time suggesting there 

remains scope for some further optimization.  

 

Cleaner flotation was conducted in cycles 8 and 9 with >4.0% Li2O grade being achieved in 

both tests. Results for cycle 9 are summarized in Table 13.11.

Based on these results, partial neutralization of process water to pH 5.5 followed by 

thickening and filtration of precipitated solids appears desirable. 

 

From the optimization program, reagent dosage parameters and addition points for petalite 

flotation were developed as well as recommended conditioning and flotation times.   

 

13.3.9 Sodium and Potassium Reduction in Petalite Concentrate  
 

In October, 2017, Avalon requested ANZAPLAN to prepare a petalite concentrate with 

reduced sodium and potassium content, using material produced from the 2016 one tonne 

pilot plant campaign. ANZAPLAN completed the testwork and was able to produce 10 kg of 

low sodium and potassium high grade petalite (which Avalon calls "Super Petalite"). 

ANZAPLAN refloated the concentrate to reject sodium and potassium in order to achieve 

targets of < 0.5% Na2O and <0.4% K2O (ideally less than <0.4% Na2O and <0.2 % K2O).   

 

Of the three tests undertaken, the best test produced a final concentrate that contained 0.22 % 

K2O and 0.13 % Na2O. The results for this test (F3) are summarized in Table 13.12 below. 

The procedures for bench scale test F3 were applied to a bulk concentrate campaign where a 

total of 12 kg of upgraded concentrate was produced. This work was able to demonstrate that 

it was possible to produce a 4.5% Li2O petalite concentrate with a relatively low sodium and 

potassium content.

13.3.10 Flotation of Lithium Mica 
 

In December 2017, 50 kg of Zone 6d material, which is relatively rich in lepidolite, was sent 

to ANZAPLAN to explore the possibility of producing lepidolite and petalite concentrates 

from the lepidolite rich zone. Table 13.13 shows the analysis of the sample.

Mineral liberation and inter mineral associations were estimated for the two lithium bearing 

minerals, namely petalite and lepidolite (mica). Figure 13.4 below presents the mineral 

liberation and association for the two minerals at a 150-micron grind. It can be seen that mica 

was 57% liberated while petalite was 52%. The non-liberated lithium minerals are mostly 

interlocked in binary phases with sodium and potassium feldspar.

13.3.10.1 Mica Flotation Reagent Collector Selection  
 

The crushed and deslimed ore sample was used for a series of mica flotation tests to identify 

a suitable collector. Out of the collectors tested, Flotigam EDA was considered the best for 

its ability to produce a high lithium grade and high Li2O recovery into a rougher-scavenger 

concentrate while using a relatively low reagent dosage.  

 

13.3.10.2 Sequential Flotation Tests for Lepidolite, Petalite and Feldspar 
 

Four bench scale sequential flotation tests for lepidolite, petalite and feldspar extraction were 

conducted by ANZAPLAN. The flowsheet for the testwork is illustrated in Figure 13.5.  

 



 
 

 136 

Figure 13.5  

Flowsheet for Sequential Flotation of Lepidolite, Petalite and Feldspar 

 

 
 

The flowsheet consisted of three sections, one each for extracting lepidolite, petalite and 

feldspar separately. The sample is crushed, ground and deslimed prior to mica rougher and 

scavenger and three stages of mica cleaner flotation to produce a mica concentrate. Tailings 

from the lepidolite scavenger are filtered, re-pulped in brine and fed to the petalite flotation 

circuit. The petalite recovery process includes attrition scrubbing, magnetic separation and 

desliming before petalite rougher and rougher scavenger flotation, followed by four stages of 

petalite cleaning. Petalite scavenger tailings are fed to the feldspar rougher flotation circuit. 

which comprises a rougher circuit and three stages of cleaning. Results of the four open 

circuit tests can be seen in Table 13.15.

The sample used for this test program was hand-picked from surface material and, based on 

the testwork results, looks to have contained a relatively high proportion of lepidolite 

compared to petalite. However, the test program confirmed that concentrates of both 

lepidolite and petalite can be produced which meet target requirements in terms of lithium 

grade and impurity levels. 

 

Feldspar flotation was only done on the petalite tails from one of the tests (F7). The results 

from this test are presented in Table 13.16. The test results were similar to previous feldspar 



 
 

 138 

flotation tests except that the Na to K ratio was much higher suggesting that the processing of 

the lepidolite ore could generate a sodaspar product.

13.3.10.3 Lepidolite Mica Flotation without Desliming 
 

ANZAPLAN conducted lepidolite flotation tests to investigate whether or not desliming was 

beneficial to the process. The results showed that concentrate lithium grades and mass pull 

declined significantly without desliming. The best test result with no desliming showed only 

3.9% wt. Li2O in the final concentrate, far below the >4.5% achieved in the previous tests. 

 

13.3.10.4 Locked Cycle Test Results 
 

Following the open circuit three product sequential flotation tests, two 6-cycle locked cycle 

tests (LCT1 and LCT2) were undertaken by ANZAPLAN to recover lepidolite and petalite 

concentrates. The main process steps used were: 

• Lepidolite rougher and scavenger flotation. 

• Two lepidolite flotation cleaner stages. 

• Recirculation of lepidolite cleaner tailings 1 and 2 to the rougher stage. 

• Petalite rougher and scavenger flotation on lepidolite scavenger flotation tailings. 

• Two petalite cleaner flotation stages in brine and two in water. 

• Recirculation of petalite cleaner tails 1 and 2 to the petalite rougher stage. 

• Recirculation of petalite cleaner tails 4 to petalite cleaner 3. 

• Process water recycling during LCT1 but not during LCT2. 
 

In locked cycle test LCT1, stable lithium grades in the lepidolite concentrate in the range of 

4.7 % Li2O were achieved. For the petalite flotation circuit the petalite concentrate grade 

ranged between 4.4 and 3.3 % Li2O with the lower grade during later cycles due to an 

accumulation of reagents in the process water. Reducing the frother addition improved the 

concentrate lithia grade. 

 

Based on cycle 3 to 6 the LCT1 lithium recovery into the lepidolite concentrate was 71.1 % 

with a grade of 4.7 % Li2O. Using MnO distribution as an indicator for mica, 89.9% of the 



 
 

 139 

mica was captured into the lepidolite concentrate. The lithium loss to slimes was 6.1 %. The 

lithium recovery to the petalite concentrate was 7.8 % with a grade of 3.6% Li2O. Overall 

lithium recovery in products (lepidolite and petalite concentrate) was 78.9%. 

 

Using test LCT2 cycles 3 to 6 the estimated lithium recovery to the lepidolite concentrate 

was72.8 % with a grade of 4.5 % Li2O. Approximately 90.5% of the mica was recovered to 

the lepidolite concentrate. The lithium loss during desliming was 6.5 %. and the petalite 

concentrate had an estimated grade of 4.3 % Li2O. The overall lithium recovery into the two 

products was 87.3 %. Results of the LCT1 and LCT2 are summarized in Table 13.17.

concentrate with only 2.0 wt. % Li2O was produced indicating the mica in this material was 

not lepidolite. The mica flotation concentrate also contained relatively high iron oxide 

(2.55%) and manganese oxide (1.23%) levels.

14.0 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

Lithium, rubidium, tantalum, cesium and feldspar mineral resource estimates for the 

Separation Rapids Lithium Project have been prepared by Avalon under the supervision of 

Dr. Mercer, P.Geo. (ON), Vice President of Exploration of Avalon, and who is the Qualified 

Person for the resource estimates. This updated mineral resource estimate is based on the 

eight diamond drill holes drilled by Avalon in 2017 and 2018 in combination with the 1997 

to 2001 drill holes, which were used in previous resource estimates. All steps of the 

geological modeling, variography analyses and resources estimation were performed using 

the Dassault Systemes/Geovia GEMS 6.8.1 Software. 

 

14.1 SUMMARY 
 

The Separation Rapids Lithium Project overall Measured plus Indicated mineral resource is 

estimated to be 8.41 Mt at a grade of 1.41% Li2O using a 0.6% Li2O cut-off grade, as 

summarized in Table 14.1. The Inferred mineral resource is 1.79 Mt at a grade of 1.35% 

Li2O. The total feldspar content of the mineralized zone is estimated at 43%. The two main 

mineralogical zones in the deposit, the petalite zone (6a, b, c) and the lepidolite + petalite 

zone (6d) have been estimated separately and contain combined Measured and Indicated 

resources of 6.42 Mt grading 1.41% Li2O and 1.99 Mt grading 1.41% Li2O, respectively 

(Table 14.1). This mineral resource estimate was presented in an Avalon news release on 

May 23, 2018 and is deemed not to be significantly different from the previous estimate 

dated October, 2016.

Notes: 

1. This resource estimate is valid as of May 23, 2018. 
2. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resources. 
3. The Qualified Person for this Mineral Resource estimate is William Mercer, PhD, P.Geo. (ON). 
4. The resource estimate is based on Avalon's drilling of 74 previous holes totalling 11,644 m drilled 

between 1997 and 2017 and a further four holes totalling 1,282 m in 2018. 

5. Drill data was organised in Maxwell DataShed™ and for estimation purposes was transferred to the 
Geovia GEMS 6.8 Software, wherein the block model was developed. 



 
 

 142 

6. The geological units were modeled as outlined by drill core logs. 
7. Resources were estimated by interpolating composites within a block model of 10 x 10 x 3 m blocks 

oriented along the deposit strike. 

8. Grade interpolation used the Ordinary Kriging method combined with variograms and search ellipses 
modeled for each rock unit. For PZ unit, search ellipses of 50 x 35 x 15 m and 175 x 125 x 45 m were 

used for Passes 1 and 2, respectively. For LPZ unit, search ellipses of 35 x 25 x 8 m, 75 x 50 x 15 m 

and 115 x 75 x 25 m were used for Passes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 

9. Measured material was defined as blocks interpolated using Passes 1 and 2, using composites from ≥4 
drill holes and a distance ≤25 m to the nearest composite and additional blocks with excellent 

geological and grade continuity. Indicated material includes blocks interpolated with Pass 1 and 2 

search ellipses, using ≥3 drill holes and a distance ≤35 m to the nearest composite and blocks with 

geological and grade continuity. Inferred material was defined as blocks interpolated with all Passes, 

composites from ≥2 drill holes and interpolated geological continuity up to 40 m below diamond drill 

holes. 

10. Two-metre composites were used, and no capping was necessary. 
11. The mean density of 2.65 t/m3 was used for Unit 6a, b, c and 2.62 t/m3 for Unit 6d. 
12. The cut-off grade reported in this resource estimate, 0.6% Li2O, is consistent with the previously 

published resource estimates by Avalon (Preliminary Economic Assessment, 2016; November 15, 

2017 resource estimate). 

13. The total feldspar contents were estimated utilizing QEMSCAN
®

 analysis of 38 drill core intervals 

distributed throughout the deposit. 

14. Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability and their value may be materially 
affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other issues. 

 

The primary lithium-bearing minerals, petalite and lepidolite, are found within the ~600 m by 

~80 m SRP. Surface mapping and results from 80 diamond drill holes were used to create a 

3D model of the host lithology which was used to constrain the interpolation of assays.  

 

14.2 DRILL HOLE DATABASE 
 

The Separation Rapids Project drill hole database is a Maxwell DataShed™ system operated 

by Avalon Advanced Materials. All historic and recent drill hole data and QA/QC samples 

have been digitized and imported by Avalon staff. The database contains 80 diamond drill 

holes over a total length of 13,192 m drilled between 1997 and 2018 by Avalon. The core 

diameters are NQ and HQ for the 1997 to 2001 and 2017 to 2018 drill holes, respectively. 

For all drill holes, geological logs have been digitized. Assay values of Li2O, Rb2O, Cs2O 

and Ta2O5 are recorded for 3,243 mineralized samples and 148 country rock samples which 

were studied for environmental impact assessment purposes. The QA/QC procedures and 

results are discussed in detail in Section 12.0. 

 

Downhole dip and azimuth measurements are acid tests and Tropari measurements for the 

1997 to 2001 drill holes. For the 2017 to 2018 drill holes, a Devico Devishot multi-shot 

magnetic downhole survey tool was used. 

  

14.3 GEOLOGICAL MODEL 
 

The 3D-geological model was prepared by interpreting drill hole intercepts along UTM grid 

north-south sections spaced ~25 m (see Figure 14.1). Interpretative outcrop maps by Avalon 

(1998) were also used to aid the geological modeling. Units 6a, b, c and d represent the 

lithium-rich lithologies (Table 14.2) and of these, Units 6a and 6d are the most abundant. 

Units 6b and c were found to only show limited spatial continuity and, for the purpose of 3D 



 
 

 143 

modeling, were merged with Unit 6a to a combined rock Unit 6a, b, c. In addition, Units 6a, 

b, c are those that have little or no lepidolite and consequently, the lithium present is 

dominantly in petalite in these three Units. In contrast, Unit 6d which has petalite and 

lepidolite, is important to distinguish for metallurgical processing reasons. During mining 

these Units may need to be handled separately and consequently it makes sense to estimate 

6a, b, c and 6d as distinctive Units. 

 

To allow a simplification of the model, all subdivisions of rock Unit 3 were ignored and 

Units 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 were merged to one model. The overburden was also modeled as a 3D 

geology wireframe. The rock units as used for the resource estimation are listed in Table 14.3 

while Figure 14.1 presents a 3D view of the geology model. The wireframes were 

constructed by interpreting the lithological continuity between the drill sections.

14.4 ROCK DENSITY 
 

The average rock densities for the geological units that were modeled in 3D are listed in 

Table 14.4. All measurements were performed by Avalon staff by measuring the weights of 

drill core pieces in air and immersed in water. The density of Unit 6d is with 2.62 t/m3 

slightly lower than that of Unit 6a, b, c (2.65 t/m3, Table 14.4). The density values for Units 

6a, b, c and 6d in Table 14.4 include all data up to the 2017 drilling campaign in order to 

provide consistency for resource update reporting. For the other rock units all data up to the 

2018 drilling campaign were used. The mean density values including 18 and 22 additional 

measurements collected for Units 6a, b, c and 6d in 2018, yielded total means of 2.66 ± 0.10 

and 2.61 ± 0.06 t/m3, respectively, which are consistent with the previous data as they 

overlap within the standard deviations (compare Table 14.4). As the data coverage is 

insufficient to allow 3D interpolation of the density, the rock unit averages were used for the 

block model. The relatively low standard deviations show that the rock units are well-

characterized by the available measurements.

14.5 DRILL HOLE ASSAY DATA AND STATISTICS 
 

Assay statistics for lithium, rubidium, cesium and tantalum were calculated for the lithium-

enriched units, a subset of the entire assay database (Table 14.5). Units 6a, b, c and 6d have 

median sample interval lengths of 2.0 and 1.8 m, respectively. Unit 6d has higher mean 

lithium and rubidium concentrations than Unit 6a, b, c (1.480 vs. 1.373 wt. % Li2O and 0.526 

vs. 0.319 wt.% Rb2O). Within the two units, the Li2O grades of the assays vary moderately 

around the median (Figure 14.2). Unit 6d shows a near-normal grade distribution around a 

single mode (Figure 14.2). The histogram for the Li2O assays in Unit 6a, b, c however, shows 

a bimodal distribution with an additional low-grade group and a scattered high-grade 

population (Figure 14.2). An inspection of the data shows that the high-grade (i.e., >3 wt.%) 

Li2O assays in Unit 6a, b, c mainly have sample lengths <1 m.

The cumulative probability plots for the assays shows that, despite several outliers at elevated 

grade, there are no extreme values which would strongly bias the data set (Figure 14.3, 

Figure 14.4). For Rb2O, Cs2O and Ta2O5, there are also no high-grade outliers. The data 

assay distribution indicates that capping of the grades is not necessary.

14.6 COMPOSITING 
 

The Li2O, Rb2O, Cs2O and Ta2O5 assays including those from the boreholes drilled in 2018 

were composited into 2 m intervals (the median sample length) from the top down within 

intersects between the drill holes and the 3D geology wireframes for Units 6a, b, c and 6d. 

The last interval was created when it was >0.3 m. For missing samples, a background value 

of zero was used for all elements. Hereby, two separate sets of composites were created for 

each of the two mineralogical rock types, 6a, b, c and 6d. Each composite was assigned a 

code for the corresponding geology wireframe, i.e., the specific pegmatite dike in which it is 

located. Table 14.6 lists the basic statistics for the composites.

In Table 14.7, the mean grades of the composites are compared to those of the original 

assays. The Li2O and Rb2O grades show moderate decreases of their means (-0.8 and -3.0%, 

respectively), which are due to the elimination of short intervals of elevated grade and 

inclusion of background (zero) grade material in the composites. The means of Ta2O5 and 

Cs2O show larger apparent relative deviations, which are, however, the result of only minor 

changes in absolute grade (Table 14.7).

14.7 VARIOGRAPHY 
 

The variography was performed separately on the composites for Units 6a, b, c and 6d, 

including the composites up to the 2017 drill holes, for those composites within the two 



 
 

 150 

largest dikes of each of the two pegmatite rock types. The search ellipse and variogram 

parameters were thus not modified between the 2017 and 2018 resource updates. 

 

For Unit 6a, b, c, the linear downhole semi-variogram for Li2O indicates a range of ~8 

meters, a nugget of ~0.18 and a sill of ~0.57 (Figure 14.5). The 3D variography for Li2O 

indicates that the lowest variance, longest range (175 m) and the greatest number of pairs 

occurs along the 190° azimuth and 85° dip direction, i.e. near-vertical (Figure 14.6). For the 

modelled 3D semi-variogram of the major axis, the nugget of 0.18 from the linear downhole 

semi-variogram and a range of 175 m, as indicated by the empirical data, were used (Figure 

14.6). The empirical semi-variograms in the semi-major and minor directions indicate ranges 

of ~125 and ~45 m, respectively (Figure 14.7, Figure 14.8). These observations indicate that 

a search ellipse with radii of 175 x 125 x 45 m can be used for the interpolation of blocks in 

the inferred resource category and more constrained search ellipses adjusted proportionally 

for the measured and indicated categories (see Table 14.11 in Section 14.8). 

 

The empirical downhole semi-variogram for Li2O in Unit 6d indicates a nugget of 0.27 and a 

range of 16 m (Figure 14.9). Based on the 3D variography, the main direction of Li2O grade 

continuity is horizontal along 115° with a range of 75 m (Figure 14.10). The indicated range 

in the semi-major axis is 50 m (Figure 14.11); in the minor direction the data did not allow 

determination of a range, hence the range indicated by the downhole semi-variogram was 

used for the variogram model (Figure 14.12). The variograms thus indicate that a search 

ellipse with radii of 75 x 50 x 15 m can be used to model the Li2O grades. This search ellipse 

was used for the indicated resource category; more constrained and expanded search ellipses 

were used for the measured and inferred categories, respectively (see Table 14.11 in Section 

14.8).

The subvertical dip and horizontal strike directions along 110 to 115° of the modeled 

variograms for Li2O correspond well to the observed strike and dip of the deposit based on 

outcrop mapping and structural observations. The observed ranges of grade continuity also 

correspond to the consistent mineralization observed in drill core across the deposit. The 

greater Li2O grade continuity of Unit 6a, b, c in the vertical direction compared to Unit 6d, 

which displays greater continuity in the horizontal direction, is likely mainly an effect of the 

better drill coverage of Unit 6a, b, c. 

 

For the other potentially economic elements in the deposit, Rb2O, Cs2O and Ta2O5, 

variography was performed on the composites for the main body of Unit 6a, b, c in a similar 

fashion as for Li2O. The variograms are not discussed in detail here, but the deduced search 

ellipse parameters are given in Table 14.11 of Section 14.8. 

 

14.8 BLOCK MODEL 
 

The block model was developed using a block size of 10 x 3 x 10 m which is appropriate for 

the approximate drill section spacing of 25 m and allows for additional resolution in the 

across-strike direction of the deposit where a high sample resolution is available along the 

drill holes (see Table 14.8). This block size is consistent with previous resource estimates for 

the SRLD. The block model has been rotated along -16° in the GEMS convention which 

corresponds to a 106° azimuth, the outcrop strike of the deposit approximated from two-

dimensional views of the 3D geology wireframes. The block model origin was set to UTM 

NAD 83 Zone 15 N coordinates 388,000 / 5,569,000 / 380 (easting / northing / elevation) in 

metres.

Rock codes were assigned to the block model from the geology wireframes based on a >50% 

rule and horizontal needling with an integration level of 10 needles per block. Block rock 

densities were then assigned to each rock code based on the empirical measurements 

discussed in Section 14.3, except for the Overburden, for which a value of 1.80 t/m3 based on 

a literature review was used (Table 14.9).

The parameters for each block that were assigned from the geology solids or recorded during 

the interpolation of each block are given in Table 14.10. The latter include values that were 

used for assessing the confidence in the blocks (see Section 14.10).

orientation, and the number of composites used in each interpolation step, are given in Table 

14.11. Figure 14.13 and Figure 14.14 show the search ellipses used to interpolate the grade 

for the two rock types. A limit of two samples per hole was applied to all interpolation 

profiles, resulting in the effective number of holes used for the Li2O interpolation ranging 

from 3 to 6 for Passes 1 and 2 and 2 to 4 holes for Pass 3. For Rb2O, Cs2O and Ta2O5, the 

combination of a limit of two samples per hole and 4 to 12 samples results in 2 to 6 holes 

being used for the interpolation.

To interpolate the grades of the blocks coded according to their location within the individual 

pegmatite dikes, only composites inside of the corresponding geology wireframes were used. 

The Passes were interpolated in the sequence 1, 2, 3 and the Pass was used as a first 

indication for the assignment of the confidence category.

14.8.1 Comparison of Interpolated Grades to the Composite Data 
 

Table 14.13 shows a comparison between the mean interpolated grades (from Table 14.12) 

and those of the composites (from Table 14.6) by rock unit. There are modest increases in the 

mean Li2O and Rb2O grades for Unit 6a, b, c and a 4.16% decrease in the Rb2O of Unit 6d, 

whereas the Li2O for this Unit showed only a very minor decrease. These relatively small 

changes are likely the result of a bias of the drilling in certain zones of elevated or decreased 

grade and fall within expected ranges of deviation. For Cs2O and Ta2O5, there are larger 

relative changes (Table 14.13); however, these are due to only minor differences in the 

corresponding absolute values (0.025% vs. 0.023% Cs2O, 0.008% vs. 0.009% Ta2O5; block 

vs. composite mean). In Unit 6a, b, c, the interpolations of Cs2O and Ta2O5 yielded the same 

grade values as the means of the composites (Table 14.13).

14.9.1 Grade-Tonnage Curve 
 

A grade-tonnage curve for the block model including both modeled lithium pegmatite rock 

types (6a, b, c and 6d) of the SRLD and all interpolation passes is shown in Figure 14.15. 

The plot shows that the total tonnage is relatively insensitive to changes in the cut-off grade 

at values between 0.1 and 0.7% Li2O; corresponding tonnages range between 10.33 and 

10.10 Mt, respectively. This shows that relatively little zero-grade amphibolite country rock 

has been included based on the geology model and that the grades of the lithium pegmatite 

are rarely below 0.7% Li2O. For higher cut-off grades, a modest decrease in tonnage can be 

observed up to a cut-off grade of 1.1% Li2O, followed by a sharp drop in tonnage at higher 

cut-off grades.

6a, b, c is presented in Figure 14.16. There is no significant systematic vertical grade 

variation in the interpolated blocks of the resource model, which is consistent with the grades 

recorded by the composites (Figure 14.16). Along the strike direction, the highest Li2O 

grades of the interpolated blocks are located in the centre of the deposit with drops near the 

edges, but also in the east (Figure 14.17).

For rock Unit 6d, there is relatively little vertical and along-strike variation in the block 

grades, as is the case for the composites (Figure 14.18, Figure 14.19).

14.10 RESOURCE CONFIDENCE CLASSIFICATION 
 

The resource confidence classification was assigned based on the scheme presented in Table 

14.14, which is a combination of numerical parameters and drilling, geological and spatial 

factors. The confidence categories Measured and Indicated were assigned by outlining 

continuous zones in level plans. The interpolation of all blocks in the Measured and Indicated 

categories is supported by sufficient three-dimensional drill coverage to assert a high 

confidence and does not extend beyond the zones of drilling. The Inferred category includes 

blocks within the geology wireframes that have been modeled from the drill hole logs up to 

the search ellipse limits.

where geology continuous. 

Inferred 1 + 2 + 3 ≥ 2 no limit 
includes interpolated geology up to 40 m below 

drill holes and blocks with little drilling support. 

 

The confidence categories were assigned to rock Units 6a, b, c and 6d separately. Table 

14.15 lists the statistics for the blocks in each of the confidence categories and shows that the 

criteria were successfully applied. The low standard deviations for the Li2O grades attest to 

the relatively homogeneous grade distribution in the deposit.

14.11 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE 
 

The 22 May, 2018, Measured plus Indicated resource estimate dated 23 May, 2018, for 

Separation Rapids is 8.41 Mt at an average grade of 1.41% Li2O at a cut-off grade of 0.6% 

Li2O (Table 14.16). The cut-off grade is the same as that quoted in previous resource 

estimates for the deposit and considered to be a reasonable economic cut-off prior to the 

establishment of detailed operating costs and revenue. 

 

The measured resource outcrops at the surface. An additional Inferred resource of 1.79 Mt at 

1.349% Li2O is mostly located greater than 150 m below surface and in the west of the 

deposit (Figure 14.22).

Notes: 

1. This resource estimate is valid as of May 23, 2018. 
2. CIM definitions were followed for Mineral Resources. 
3. The Qualified Person for this Mineral Resource estimate is William Mercer, PhD, P.Geo. (ON). 
4. The resource estimate is based on Avalon's drilling of 74 previous holes totalling 11,644 m drilled 

between 1997 and 2017 and a further four holes totalling 1,282 m in 2018. 

5. Drill data was organised in Maxwell DataShedTM and for estimation purposes was transferred to the 
Geovia GEMS 6.8 software, wherein the block model was developed. 

6. The geological units were modeled as outlined by drill core logs. 
7. Resources were estimated by interpolating composites within a block model of 10 x 10 x 3 m blocks 

oriented along the deposit strike. 

8. Grade interpolation used the Ordinary Kriging method combined with variograms and search ellipses 
modeled for each rock unit. For PZ unit, search ellipses of 50 x 35 x 15 m and 175 x 125 x 45 m were 

used for Passes 1 and 2, respectively. For LPZ unit, search ellipses of 35 x 25 x 8 m, 75 x 50 x 15 m and 

115 x 75 x 25 m were used for Passes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. 

9. Measured material was defined as blocks interpolated using Passes 1 and 2, using composites from ≥4 
drill holes and a distance ≤25 m to the nearest composite and additional blocks with excellent geological 

and grade continuity. Indicated material includes blocks interpolated with Pass 1 and 2 search ellipses, 

using ≥3 drill holes and a distance ≤35 m to the nearest composite and blocks with geological and grade 

continuity. Inferred material was defined as blocks interpolated with all Passes, composites from ≥2 drill 

holes and interpolated geological continuity up to 40 m below diamond drill holes. 

10. Two-metre composites were used, and no capping was necessary. 
11. The mean density of 2.65 t/m3 was used for Unit 6a, b, c and 2.62 t/m3 for Unit 6d. 
12. The cut-off grade reported in this resource estimate, 0.6% Li2O, is consistent with the previously 

published resource estimates by Avalon (Preliminary Economic Assessment, 2016; November 15, 2017 

resource estimate). 

13. The total feldspar contents were estimated utilizing QEMSCAN
®

 analysis of 38 drill core intervals 

distributed throughout the deposit. 

14. Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability and their value may be materially 
affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, socio-political, marketing, or other issues.

The present resource model includes separate estimates for the petalite-dominant (Unit 6a, b, 

c) and the lepidolite + petalite-dominant (6d) rock units. The detailed Table 14.17 lists the 

resources by rock type at multiple cut-off grades; Figure 14.23 shows the two rock types as 

colour-coded blocks. At a cut-off grade of 0.6% Li2O, the Measured and Indicated resources 

for rock Unit 6a, b, c include 6.42 Mt grading 1.409% Li2O and additional Inferred resources 

are 1.31 Mt at a grade of 1.351% Li2O. For Unit 6d, the Measured and Indicated resources 

are 1.99 Mt grading 1.406% Li2O and the Inferred resources are 0.48 Mt at a grade of 

1.346% Li2O. It is worth noting that Unit 6d is distinctly higher in Ta, Cs and Rb compared 

to 6a, b, c at the same Li2O cut-off grade.

14.12 COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
 

A summary of the historic mineral resource estimates for the SRLD is presented in Table 

14.7. Compared to Avalon's 2017 resource estimate, which used identical estimation 

methods to the current estimate, the combined Measured and Indicated resources increased 

by ~3% and the Inferred resources increased by ~49% (Table 14.7). A better refinement of 

the geological models, including for the overburden, resulted in a tighter constraint for the 

Measured Resource (Table 14.7). 

 

Compared to the resource prepared by Avalon in 2016 and quoted in a Preliminary Economic 

Assessment report, the combined Measured and Indicated resources increased by ~6% and 

the Inferred resources increased by ~10% (Table 14.7). The current estimate uses stricter 

geological constraints compared to those used in 2016, resulting in only a moderate tonnage 

increase despite additional drilling. Previously interpreted down-dip geology models were 

found to be narrower at depth than previously predicted by the 2016 estimate. 

 

A prefeasibility study in 1999 (Avalon/Micon) reported Measured and Indicated resources of 

8.0 Mt grading 1.29% Li2O and Inferred resources of 2.7 Mt grading 1.34% Li2O without 

any cut-off applied (Table 14.7). The greater tonnage and lower grade compared to the 

current resource estimate (compare Figure 14.15) indicates that the 1999 study included a 

greater volume of material diluted with country rock. 

 

Factors in addition to the geology and assay data from the new holes drilled in 2017 and 

2018 that affect comparisons with historic resource estimates include additional density data 

and improved geological models.

14.13 ESTIMATED FELDSPAR RESOURCES 
 

The Separation Rapids Lithium Project is a potential producer of high-purity feldspar, a 

mixture of albite and potassium feldspar (microcline), in addition to lithium chemicals and/or 

petalite. The mineralogy of the pegmatite is described in detail in Section 7.6, which also 

covers the methodology for the QEMSCAN® analyses. 

 

Figure 14.30 shows the locations of the samples for which quantitative mineralogy, including 

feldspar content, has been determined. It is important to note that these samples are well 

distributed throughout the deposit and that the sampling covers the volume of the resource 

spatially in an adequate fashion. 

 

To determine the mineralogy of the pegmatites, Avalon commissioned 39 QEMSCAN® 

analyses. The samples include one outcrop bulk sample (rock Unit 6a, b, c), four polished 

thin section samples and 34 coarse-crushed assay rejects. Table 14.19 provides a summary of 

the modal proportions of the feldspars based on the QEMSCAN® analyses. The mean 

combined proportions of albite and K-feldspar are 43.7 and 40.1 wt.% for rock Units 6a, b, c 

and 6d, respectively. A single outlier sample from rock Unit 6a, b, c with unusually high 

feldspar contents (32.5 wt. % albite, 44.7 wt.% K-feldspar) has been excluded from the 

calculation of the mean. The similarity of the means and medians indicates that the means are 

not strongly affected by outlier values (Table 14.19). The slightly lower total feldspar content 

of Unit 6d may be explained by the presence of abundant lepidolite as an additional 

aluminosilicate.

Figure 14.31 provides the individual QEMSCAN® analyses for the two feldspars in the two 

rock units. In particular in Unit 6a, b, c, there is a wide variation in albite content and a trend 

towards high albite concentrations, skewing the calculated means somewhat and resulting in 

a relatively large standard deviation of 11.1 wt.% for albite (corresponding to a relative 

standard deviation of 32.0%, relative to the mean).

The modal mineralogy has previously been determined via point counts and optical 

microscopy on thin sections (Taylor, 2001); the results for the feldspars in Unit 6a, b, c are 

summarized in Table 14.20 (no data is available for Unit 6d). Within the standard deviation 

ranges, the visual determinations agree with the QEMSCAN® data, but the mean is with 37% 

by volume somewhat lower than that of the total feldspar content determined via 

QEMSCAN® analysis (~44%). Owing to the small number of samples for the point counts 

and the nature of the analysis, the QEMSCAN® results are regarded as more reliable. Visual 

estimations directly on the drill core performed by Avalon staff yielded a global average

feldspar content (albite and K-feldspar combined) of 43% by volume, which agrees well with 

the result of the QEMSCAN® analyses for Units 6a, b, c.

Based on QEMSCAN® analysis of 38 representative samples, and supported by independent 

methods, the mean total feldspar contents throughout the SRLD are 44 wt.% and 40 wt. % 

for rock Units 6a, b, c and 6d, respectively. Thus, the total feldspar mineral estimates have 

been added to the estimated resources presented in Table 14.16 and Table 14.17.

16.0 MINING METHODS 
 

16.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Micon has undertaken pit optimization calculations to provide an updated PEA using the 

mineral resource block model prepared by Avalon. Micon has imported the block model into 

Surpac™ to create a block model compatible with the pit optimization software. 

 

A preliminary optimization has been performed using Whittle™ software in order to estimate 

the potential for future open pit mining of the deposit. Cost parameters, derived from the 

operating cost estimate, were applied to the optimization model to assess the amount of 

resources available for economic exploitation. Inferred Resources were also incorporated into 

this preliminary optimization, along with the Measured and Indicated Resources to provide 

an indication of the potential future mineral reserves, should further drilling be completed to 

increase the geological certainty of the current mineral resources. 

 

The SRLD requires further exploration and infill drilling to both increase the size of the 

resource and increase the geological certainty of the current Inferred Resources. Under NI 

43-101 rules, Inferred Resources cannot be included in a mineral reserve and cannot form the 

basis of a feasibility study, however, it is acceptable to include Inferred material in a PEA, 

however, the reader should take note that this material is of low geological certainty and is 

included only as an indication of possible future potential. 

 

It should also be stressed that the optimization analysis presented here is not an open pit 

design. The analysis presents the potential size of resource which could be contained within 

an open pit if the Inferred material can be upgraded to the Indicated and Measured categories 

by further infill drilling. 

 

16.2 TERMS OF REFERENCE AND DATA AVAILABLE 
 

The resource estimate update (see Section 14.0) was completed by Avalon (News Release 

08-18: Updated Resource Estimate and Development Plans for Separation Rapids Lithium 

Project, Kenora, Ontario, 23 May 2018). 

 

16.3 GEOTECHNICAL EVALUATION 
 

The geotechnical data has been gathered from the pit slope design study which was 

conducted by Knight Piesold and summarised in their report "Determination of Feasibility 

Level Pit Slope Design Parameters", Ref. No. D2392/1 dated 9th July 2001. 

 



 
 

 180 

16.4 PIT OPTIMIZATION 
 

16.4.1 Method 
 

The purpose of the modelling was to generate an estimate of the conceptual mineable tonnes 

including the Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources that would be acceptable for the 

PEA. Micon used Whittle software for the optimization, applying conceptual financial and 

technical parameters from industry best practice. 

 

The Whittle™ programme comprises three components, the ultimate pit shell generator, a 

push back generator, and the optimising scheduler. The ultimate pit generator is the first 

stage of the optimization process and utilises a Lerchs Grossman (LG) algorithm to generate 

an economic open pit shell from the mineral resource block model based on the initial input 

parameters. 

 

The second component is the push back generator which a series of pushbacks according to 

the LG phases. The third component is the scheduler and is used to create optimum mining 

schedules. 

 

It should be noted that the Whittle™ software, used for the optimization, does not provide 

ultimate pit shells with in-pit roads or berms and therefore further design work was required 

in order to estimate realistic waste amounts within the optimised pit, as well as more precise 

indications of the resources contained in the optimal pit. 

 

16.4.2 Optimization Parameters 
 

The GEMS™ block model for the SRLD was imported into Surpac™ and then imported into 

Whittle™. The pit optimization iterations were based on a single processing method and 

targeting only the Lithium Oxide (Li2O) as the final product. An exchange rate of 

CAD1.30:USD1.00 was used to convert all parameters to US dollars. The input parameters 

are summarised in Table 16.1.

16.4.3 Results 
 

The pit optimization calculations using the above parameters indicated that the economic cut-

off grade was approximately 1.20% Li2O and the optimization run suggested a life of mine 

(LOM) plant feed tonnage of approximately 8.3 Mt at a grade of 1.4% Li2O.  

 

As a result of the optimization, a number of ultimate pit shells were produced, as shown in 

Figure 16.1. Each of the ultimate pit shells (final pit envelope) contains the maximum 

mineable resources for the given economic criteria, based upon maximising net present value 

(NPV). The NPV in these models consider operating cost, but not capital costs. Pit shell 15 

was chosen as the optimum pit because it indicated the maximum NPV; after that point the 

NPV is decreasing as the waste strip ratio increases. The pit optimization results are shown in 

Table 16.2.

16.5 PIT DESIGN 
 

A conceptual pit design was conducted from the bottom up using the design parameters in 

Table 16.3 below and the optimum pit shell 15 as a template. The bench to bench face angle 

of 80 degrees, with a 10 m bench and a 6 m wide safety berm was applied every 20 m. A 

haul road width of 15 m was used from the pit base (75 level) to the surface, on the 

assumption that two-way traffic would be operating in the whole of the mine.

During the pit design process, the pit contours were extended beyond the topography to 

enable the pit and digital terrain model (DTM) and the topography DTM to intersect. Figure 

16.4 and Figure 16.5 show a plan and long section view of the pit design.

16.6 IN PIT RESOURCE 
 

The mineral resources within the pit design were calculated with the petalite and lepidolite 

ore types in their respective resource categories. The "in pit" tonnages are greater than the pit 

optimization results due to the inclusion of haul roads and safety berms. A summary of the 

"in pit" mineral resources is shown in Table 16.4 below.

16.7 OPEN PIT MINING 
 

The proposed method of mining is by conventional open pit methods using drilling and 

blasting, loading with excavators and shovels and hauling with rigid dump trucks. The 

mineral will be excavated by hydraulic excavator to allow selectivity in ore and waste areas. 

A dedicated front-end loader, Caterpillar 992 or equivalent, will also assist in excavating 

high outputs of waste. 

 

The deposit is near surface and suitable for conventional truck and shovel open pit mining. 

The topsoil and any sensitive material will be removed and stockpiled in a specific site. This 

material will be used in the rehabilitation of mine site at the end of operations. Waste from 

the pit will initially be composed of overburden and will be dumped near the topsoil 

stockpile. As the pit is developed harder waste rock will be excavated and will be stored on a 

separate waste dump.  

 

There will be a requirement for a low and high-grade ore stockpiles to be positioned adjacent 

to the primary crusher. 

 



 
 

 186 

16.8 CONTRACTOR VERSUS OWNER OPERATED 
 

The Project will be undertaken by contractor-operated equipment and labour. This was 

selected as the base case following a cost comparison of Owner versus contractor mining 

operations. 

 

16.9 MINE DEVELOPMENT 
 

The mine development activities would commence with the removal of the trees and other 

vegetation. Topsoil will then be excavated and stockpiled. 

 

A new site access road is to be built. The preproduction stripping of waste will be used to 

construct site roads, including the main haul roads. Acceptable waste material will also be 

used for the construction of fresh water and tailing dam walls.  

 

16.10 WASTE STORAGE 
 

The barren waste that will be excavated during the life of the mine has been estimated to be 

52.3 Mt and a site will need to be located to store at least 17.6 Mm3. Detailed studies to 

determine the best locations for waste storage will be undertaken during the next phase of 

project development.  

 

16.11 PRODUCTION SCHEDULE 
 

A conceptual production schedule has been produced in MineSched™ software. This 

program uses block model information, together with pit locations, mining strategy, 

constraints, production data and targets to produce a schedule in tabular form of quantities 

and qualities. 

 

Production data in the form of annual rates are input, as well as the locations of where and in 

what sequence mining is to take place. Quality and material ratio targets can be specified to 

guide the program to achieve the best schedule. The production schedule shown in Table 

16.5 is based on mining 475,000 t/y of petalite and lepidolite mineralized material.   

 

The life of the mine is expected to be 19 years with approximately 6.2 Mt of petalite material 

at 1.39% Li2O and 2.4 Mt of lepidolite mineralization at 1.41% Li2O mined over the length 

of the Project.

16.12 MINING FLEET 
 

The majority of the mining and support equipment will be diesel powered. The main loading 

equipment will be a hydraulic backhoe excavator. A front-end loader will assist in the mass 

excavation of waste, bench and haul road management as well as providing backup support 

in the pit. 

 

The assumptions for the fleet calculation were based on 22 hours per day, 7 days per week 

and 50 weeks per year. 

 

16.12.1 Main Mining Equipment 
 

For this level of study, the main mining equipment selection is based on a Caterpillar 6020 

diesel hydraulic backhoe excavator with a 12 m3 bucket capacity. This excavator was 

selected for its reliability and performance. One unit will be required for both mineralized 

mill feed and waste excavation, which is based on each unit working 7,700 h/y with 95% 

availability and 75% operator efficiency. 

 

The haul trucks selected are Caterpillar 777 rigid body trucks with a 60.4 m3 capacity and 

capable of moving 90 t loads. These trucks were selected for their reliability and 

performance, combined with good size matching to the Caterpillar 6020 excavator. It is 

estimated that six trucks will be required during the peak activity period in Years 6 to 8 

(including one service spare). This is based on each unit working 7,700 h/y with 85% 

availability and 85% operator efficiency. 

 

16.12.2 Ancillary Equipment 
 

The ancillary equipment required to support the mining activities includes drill rigs, 

explosives plant and trucks, tracked dozers, fuel and lubrication truck, a motor grader, water 

trucks for dust suppression, light vehicles and lighting plant. Table 16.6 summarizes the 

specifications of the ancillary equipment and the number of units required.

17.0 RECOVERY METHODS 
 

17.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The Separation Rapids Lithium Project PEA metallurgical process is based on the testwork 

that is described in Section 13.0. The process selected for the PEA comprises the mineral 

separation and recovery of a lepidolite concentrate a petalite concentrate (both containing 

between 4.0% and 4.50% Li2O), and thirdly, a mixed Na/K-feldspar product. While the 

previous, 2016 PEA was based around the conversion of all petalite to lithium hydroxide, this 

latest study stops at the production of petalite, lepidolite and feldspar flotation concentrates. 

That said, there remains the potential to install a hydroxide production facility in the future.  

 

The lepidolite, petalite and feldspar recovery processes were developed and tested by 

ANZAPLAN in Germany. Various testwork programs were undertaken by ANZAPLAN 

between 2014 and 2018 including the production of 1 t of petalite concentrate in a pilot 

program conducted in 2016. ANZAPLAN also developed the process to recover a mixed 

Na/K-feldspar product and completed preliminary testwork on this material which indicated 

the suitability of this product in not only the ceramics industry but also as filler in paint, 

fibreglass and other products. 

 

This PEA is based on the processing of 475,000 t/y of mineralized material over a 19-year 

mine life to produce approximately 220,000 t of lepidolite concentrate, 1.32 Mt of petalite 

and 1.34 Mt of feldspar. The lepidolite is to be sold into the lithium chemicals industry to 

customers in Canada and Asia, while the petalite will be sold to customers in the 

glass/ceramics industries in Europe, Asia and North America. The feldspar will be sold to 

customers for a range of applications in North America and Europe. 

 

A single milling and flotation circuit is provided for processing both lepidolite/petalite (LPZ) 

mineralization and petalite (PZ) material on a campaign basis. Tailings from the flotation of 

lepidolite ore will be stockpiled for future re-processing to recover petalite. Some of the final 

tailings from the petalite ore flotation process will feed a second, dedicated feldspar flotation 

circuit with the balance of the petalite tailings reporting to the tailings management facility 

(TMF). 

 

The magnetic concentrate and slimes (-20 microns) product recovered ahead of flotation in 

the petalite circuit will be combined and also delivered to the TMF as will final lepidolite 

tailings (after petalite recovery), and feldspar tailings. All tailings will be dewatered and 

stacked in a dedicated TMF. 

 

Results from the extensive testwork programs (see Section 13.0) have been used to develop a 

processing flowsheet, mechanical equipment list and reagent consumptions. A simplified 

block flow diagram showing the main process steps within the overall Separation Rapids 

flowsheet is presented in Figure 17.1.

17.2 PROCESS DESIGN BASIS ASSUMPTIONS 
 

The PEA report and financial evaluation are based on the following design criteria that have 

been derived from the testwork results: 

• Optical sorting mass waste rejection is 1.8% with lithium losses of also 1.8%. 

• For petalite PZ mineralization, the mass pull to slimes after comminution and 
attritioning is 7.9% of mill feed with an 8.6% lithium loss. For the lepidolite LPZ 

mineralization, mass and lithium losses are 8.4% and 6.5% respectively. 

• Mass pull to magnetics (petalite PZ only) is 13% of sorted mineralized material 
tonnage with lithium losses of 13.8%. 

• The lepidolite concentrates contains 4.5% Li2O% while 50% of the petalite 
concentrate will be 4.5% (with low sodium and potassium levels) and the balance 

being 4.0% for an average life of mine grade of 4.25% Li2O. 

• Lithium recovery to lepidolite concentrate (LPZ) is 78%. Lithium recovery to petalite 
concentrate from lepidolite tailings is 70%. 

• Lithium recovery to petalite concentrate (PZ) is 65.2% of flotation feed content. 

• Mass pull to feldspar concentrate is 82.9% of feldspar flotation feed. 

• Plant availabilities of 90% for the flotation plant although the crushing plant has been 
suitably sized to run on a single 12-hour shift per day.

17.3 CONCENTRATOR PROCESS DESCRIPTION 
 

17.3.1 Crushing and Sorting of Mineralized Material 
 

This circuit will process both LPZ and PZ mineralization separately on a campaign basis. 

 

Run-of-mine (ROM) mineralized material is fed to multi-stage crushing and optical sorting 

before proceeding to the comminution circuit. The circuit is designed to process 200 t/h of 

material to facilitate a single, 12 h/day operating cycle and to also facilitate a possible future 

expansion of production capacity. 

 

ROM mineralized material is delivered to a stockpile at the plant by truck. A front-end loader 

then reclaims the material and feeds it into a bin equipped with a 400 mm square static 

grizzly. From this bin it is fed at a rate of 200 t/h by a vibrating grizzly feeder, the oversize of 

which (+150 mm) feeds a jaw crusher. Crusher product is mixed with the feeder undersize 

and conveyed to a vibrating screen. The oversize (+50 mm) of this screen is fed to a 

secondary cone crusher with crusher product being combined with the screen undersize 

which then feeds a second vibrating screen. The second screen separates the mineralized 

material into three size fractions, these are: 

• +25 mm: This material is fed by conveyor to an optical sorter where waste rock 
(mainly amphibolite) is rejected onto a conveyor and transported to a stockpile from 

which it is then transferred by truck to the main waste stockpile. The non-waste rock 

is fed by conveyor to a tertiary cone crusher. 

• -25 +8 mm: This material is fed to a second optical sorter. Waste rejects are combined 
on the same waste conveyor as that for the first sorter, non-waste rock is combined 

with that of the first sorter non-waste and sent to the tertiary crusher. 

• -8 mm: This material is transported by conveyor to a crushed mineralized material 
storage silo sized to hold 24 hours of crusher product. 

 

The amount of material rejected by the sorter has been estimated at 1.8% of crusher plant 

feed (as measured in a 30-t bulk sample processed in Germany). 

 

Tertiary crusher product is combined with the product from the secondary cone crusher and 

recycled to the second of the vibrating screens. 

 

17.3.2 Comminution, De-sliming and Magnetic Separation 
 

The grinding and classification circuit consists of a ball mill operating in closed circuit with a 

wet classification screening process, followed by a two-stage magnetic separation process, 

attrition scrubbers and a cluster of desliming cyclones. 

 

The feed to the ball mill is drawn from the crushed mineralized material silo by one of two 

vibrating feeders and conveyor at a nominal rate of 67.4 t/h (dry basis). Feed rate is 

controlled by a weightometer on this belt. Mill product is pumped to a cluster of fine screens 



 
 

 193 

cutting at 150 µm. The oversize from this screen is returned to the ball mill and the undersize 

gravitates to the magnetic separation circuit. 

 

The magnetic separation is made up of firstly a low intensity unit (LIMS) and then a high 

intensity (WHIMS) unit. Screened slurry gravitates to the LIMS where any highly magnetic 

material is removed. Non-magnetics are collected in a sump and are pumped to the WHIMS 

where weakly magnetic material (mostly lithium/iron micas) is removed. Both magnetic 

products are combined and pumped to a thickener while the non-mags are pumped to 

dewatering cyclones to thicken the slurry to approximately 60% solids by weight. This 

thickened slurry is fed to a bank of attritioners in order to clean the mineral surfaces ahead of 

flotation. Product from the attritioners is diluted with overflow from the feed dewatering 

cyclones and pumped to a cluster of desliming cyclones cutting at 20 µm. The slimes 

(dewatering cyclone overflow) from these are combined with the magnetics' streams and 

pumped to the thickener while the desliming cyclone underflow gravitates to a belt filter for 

dewatering ahead of flotation. (Note that when processing lepidolite LPZ the magnetic 

separators are by-passed). 

 

17.3.3 Petalite Flotation 
 

The cake from the belt filter is re-pulped using an 8% (50:50) NaCl/KCl brine solution and 

pumped to the petalite flotation circuit. A recycled stream of combined cleaner tailings 1 and 

2 is also added here after being densified by dewatering cyclones. 

 

When processing petalite (PZ), some of the tailings from the lepidolite circuit will also be fed 

into the petalite circuit. These will be reclaimed from the lepidolite tailings stockpile, re-

pulped in 8% brine and pumped to the re-pulping tank after the filter. 

 

The petalite flotation circuit consists of rougher and rougher scavenger flotation and five 

stages of cleaner flotation. The slurry is first fed to two stages of conditioning then gravitates 

to the rougher flotation cells and a rougher petalite concentrate is produced. The tailings from 

the rougher flotation cells are conditioned with additional brine and flotation reagents added 

before being fed to a rougher-scavenger bank where a rougher-scavenger concentrate is 

produced. This gets combined with the rougher concentrate before being pumped to the first 

petalite cleaner flotation stage. The tailings from rougher-scavenger flotation are sampled 

before being pumped to a filter press for dewatering and washing. A portion of this 

dewatered material (approximately 22 t/h) is re-pulped and sent to the feldspar flotation 

circuit while the balance is filtered and deposited in the TMF.  

 

The petalite cleaner flotation circuit consists of five cleaner flotation stages and a belt filter 

for dewatering the cleaner 2 petalite concentrate ahead of cleaner 3. The petalite rougher 

concentrate is fed to two stages of conditioning where additional brine and flotation reagents 

are added. The conditioned feed is then fed into the first stage of petalite cleaners. Primary 

petalite cleaner concentrate is pumped to the second cleaner stage via one stage of 

conditioning and reagent addition. The tails from primary cleaner are combined with tailings 

from cleaner 2 and recycled back to the head of the rougher circuit via dewatering cyclones.   



 
 

 194 

Concentrate from the secondary cleaner is pumped into an agitated holding tank before it is 

pumped into a belt filter for dewatering and washing to remove excess brine. The secondary 

concentrate is filtered to approximately 10% moisture and the brine filtrate is recycled as 

petalite rougher process water. The filter cake is transferred to an agitated holding tank and 

re-slurried with fresh process water. This step is necessary since the chemistry and reagents 

used in the final three stages of petalite flotation differ from those in the first two stages. The 

re-pulped concentrate is then pumped to cleaner 3 via two stages of conditioning (it is also 

mixed with cleaner 4 flotation tails). The petalite tertiary cleaner concentrate is produced and 

pumped into cleaner 4, while the cleaner flotation 3 tails are pumped to a filter for disposal. 

Cleaner 4 concentrate proceeds to the cleaner 5 circuit, with cleaner 4 tails returning to 

cleaner 3. A final petalite concentrate is produced in cleaner flotation 5 and is sampled and 

pumped to a holding tank before being filtered and dried. Cleaner 5 tails are recycled to 

cleaner 4. 

 

17.3.4 Petalite Concentrate Handling 
 

The petalite concentrate is dewatered and washed on a belt filter before feeding a collection 

hopper from which it is extracted by a screw feeder and fed into a rotary drier where it is 

dried to <1% moisture. All petalite produced will feed a hopper ahead of a bulk-bag (2 t) 

packaging facility for bagging and export via a nearby railway siding to customers in Europe 

and North America. 

 

Filtrate from the concentrate filter is re-cycled back to the petalite cleaner process water 

circuit. 

 

17.3.5 Feldspar Flotation  
 

The feldspar flotation circuit will be introduced in year 5 and will consist of a rougher and 

two cleaner stages of flotation. The feldspar flotation circuit has been designed to produce 

100,000 t/y of feldspar concentrate and as such, only a portion of the filtered petalite tailings 

are re-pulped and pumped to the feldspar circuit, the remainder is transported to the TMF. 

 

The re-pulped petalite tailings are first conditioned with flotation reagents before being fed 

into the feldspar rougher flotation bank. The feldspar rougher concentrate is pumped to a 

conditioner before being fed to the first stage of cleaning. Cleaner 1 concentrate is fed to a 

second stage of cleaning with the tailings from both cleaner stages and the rougher tailings 

being pumped to the tailings filter. Cleaner 2 concentrate is pumped to the feldspar 

dewatering circuit. Additional reagents are added ahead of each cleaner stage. 

 

17.3.6 Feldspar Concentrate Handling 
 

The feldspar concentrate is dewatered and washed on a belt filter before being dried in a 

rotary drier. The dried feldspar concentrate is cooled and fed to a hopper ahead of a bulk-bag 

(2-t) packaging facility. The bags are covered and strapped to the pallets ready for 

transporting to customers.   



 
 

 195 

Filtrate from the feldspar filter is re-cycled back to the feldspar process water circuit. 

 

Avalon has identified a market of approximately 40,000 t/y for the feldspar product as a filler 

in both the paint and potentially the fibreglass industries. This material has a premium price 

but first needs to be milled to a d50 size of 6.3 µm. It is intended that material destined for 

the filler market will be fed after the cooler to an air-swept ball mill (with ceramic balls and 

liners). Milled product will be classified to the correct size in an air classifier with oversize 

being returned to the ball mill. Final product will report to a dedicated hopper and bagging 

facility. 

 

17.3.7 Tailings and Magnetics Concentrate Storage 
 

There are five tailings circuits at the flotation plant. The first circuit consists of a thickener 

and a plate and frame filter to thicken and dewater tailings suitable for dry stacking. The feed 

materials to the thickener are the slimes from the comminution circuit along with the 

magnetics materials. Water recovered from this circuit is directed to the Comminution 

Process Water tank and the solids are trucked to the TMF for permanent storage. 

 

The second circuit handles the petalite cleaner 3 tailings and entails filtering the solids on a 

belt filter. These solids are also deposited at the TMF by truck and the filtrate reports to the 

Petalite cleaner process water tank. 

 

The third circuit processes the lepidolite or petalite scavenger tails, depending on the 

campaign, and again involves dewatering on a belt filter. Approximately 50% of filtered 

petalite tailings are repulped for feldspar flotation while the other half is stored in one area of 

the TMF and the lepidolite tails are stored in another area for future reprocessing to recover 

petalite. Filtrate from this circuit is sent to the water treatment facility.  

 

The fourth circuit is reclaimed lepidolite tails, which are repulped separately for petalite 

flotation with comminution water. 

 

The fifth circuit is a small amount of feldspar tails which are also filtered and stacked in the 

TMF. 

 

All circuits are designed to produce filter cakes averaging ±10% moisture (w/w).  

 

17.3.8 Lepidolite Mineralization (LPZ) Processing 
 

When processing LPZ the comminution circuit is the same as for PZ except that the magnetic 

separators are by-passed. 

 

The flotation circuit makes use of the rougher, scavenger and first 2 stages of cleaners to 

produce a final concentrate. Sulphuric acid is added to the flotation feed to adjust pH to 2.5 

and then a collector (Flotigam EDA) is added into a conditioning tank. 

 



 
 

 196 

Rougher flotation concentrate is pumped to the first cleaner stage, rougher tails reports to a 

scavenger circuit, the concentrate of which is returned to the head of the rougher cells. 

Scavenger tails is filtered, and the cake stacked in a designated area close to the plant site, for 

future reclamation. 

 

Concentrate from the first cleaner stage is pumped to a second cleaner while cleaner 1 

tailings are also returned to the rougher feed. Cleaner 2 tails are recycled to cleaner 1 while 

cleaner 2 concentrate is pumped to the concentrate filter. The lepidolite filter cake is then 

dried, bagged and trucked/shipped to customers.  

 

17.3.9 Reagents 
 

There are a number of reagents used in the flotation process that come in solid or liquid form 

with various safety concerns. These reagents will be handled and stored, mixed and pumped 

to specific addition points within the process in a safe manner. Some of the reagents will 

arrive on site in bulk and some will be in drums. The reagents include the following: 

 

Petalite Flotation: 

• Hydrofluoric acid (HF). 

• PEG collector. 

• K2C flotation collector. 

• 4343 collector. 

• D14 flotation reagent. 

• Sodium chloride (NaCl). 

• Potassium chloride (KCl). 

• Lime 
 

Lepidolite: 

• Flotigam EDA Collector. 

• Sulphuric Acid. 
 

Feldspar Flotation: 

• Hydrofluoric acid (HF) 

• 4343 flotation reagent. 
 

Product Dewatering: 

• Flocculants. 
 



 
 

 197 

Individual dosing pumps with variable speed drives will be employed for each reagent dosing 

point. 

 

17.3.10 Metallurgical Accounting 
 

Weightometers will be installed on the primary crusher product conveyor, mineralized 

material sorter rejects conveyor and the crushed mineralized material reclaim/VSI feed 

conveyor. 

 

Mass flow systems and automatic samplers will be installed on the following process 

streams: 

• Crushed ore to mill feed bin. 

• Slimes + Magnetics tailings. 

• Petalite/Lepidolite flotation circuit feed after magnetic separation. 

• Petalite/Lepidolite flotation rougher scavenger tailings. 

• Petalite/Lepidolite concentrate. 

• Petalite cleaner 3 tailings. 

• Feldspar flotation circuit feed. 

• Feldspar flotation tailings. 

• Feldspar flotation concentrate. 
 

Samples will be taken several times per hour (frequency will vary depending on sample) and 

eight-hour composites will be sent to the laboratory for analysis. 

 

17.3.11 Plant Services 
 

The concentrator will utilize compressed air and low-pressure blower air. Compressed air 

will be split into plant air, and instrument air (which will also be filtered and dried). The low-

pressure blowers will supply air for the petalite/lepidolite and feldspar flotation cells. 

 

17.3.12 Water  
 

17.3.12.1 Fresh Water 
 

Fresh water will be obtained from the nearby English River and pumped to a storage tank. 

Fresh water will be used to provide gland service water, potable water (after treatment in the 

potable water plant), reagent make-up water and filter wash water for the concentrate and 

tailings filter washing. If required, fresh water will also be used as a source of fire water. 

 



 
 

 198 

17.3.12.2 Process Water 
 

The water balance within the flotation plant is very complex; there will be a number of 

separate process water circuits at the flotation plant that will have their own dedicated 

process water storage tank and distribution systems. These circuits include: 

• Comminution Process Water: Comminution, classification, desliming and magnetic 
separation circuits. 

• Petalite Rougher Process Water: Petalite rougher, scavenger, primary cleaning and 
secondary cleaning circuits. 

• Petalite Cleaner Process Water (and Lepidolite Process Water): Petalite cleaning 
circuits and the lepidolite flotation circuit. 

• Feldspar Process Water: Used in the feldspar circuit for launder sprays and general 
process applications 

 

17.3.12.3 Water Treatment 
 

Final water treatment will consist of processing the filtrate from the flotation scavenger 

tailings filter. Lime will be added to precipitate dissolved metal ions and these solids will 

then be removed by firstly a thickener and then a filter. Filter cake will then be deposited 

within the TMF and the treated water will be returned to the petalite rougher process water 

circuit or directly to the brine make-up system.

18.2.6 Power  
 

Approximately 10 MW of (operating) power will be required and this will be supplied from 

the existing 115 kV system running from Caribou Falls to Whitedog Falls. A stepdown 

transformer will be installed at the connection point to the 115-kV line and approximately 25 

km of transmission line will be installed to bring the power to the mine site. An additional 

stepdown transformer will be installed at the site to supply power to the local electrical 



 
 

 202 

distribution system. An emergency back-up generator will also be provided at the site fueled 

by propane. 

 

Project information and requirements have been supplied to Hydro One who have confirmed 

that sufficient power is available for the Project and are currently investigating the best 

option for supplying power to the site. In the meantime, a provision has been included in the 

capital cost estimate for the installation of this power line. 

 

18.2.7 Fuel Storage 
 

Diesel fuel storage facilities will be provided to supply the mine equipment and smaller site

 203 

19.0 MARKET STUDIES AND CONTRACTS 
 

19.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

As discussed in Section 17.0, this PEA is based on the recovery of lepidolite, petalite and 

mixed sodium/feldspar (Na/K) feldspar concentrates at the following approximate annual 

rates: 

 

Lepidolite   11,800 t/y 

Petalite  73,000 t/y 

Na/K feldspar  100,000 t/y 

 

It is planned that the lepidolite concentrate will be sold into the lithium chemicals industry to 

customers in Canada, while the petalite will be sold to customers in the glass and ceramics 

industries in North America, Europe and Asia. The feldspar concentrate will be sold for 

applications in glass, ceramics, frits and glazes and fillers in North America and Europe. 

 

Avalon conducts its own market research and analysis which includes attendance at relevant 

conferences and presentations and holds regular discussions with industry participants and 

potential off-takers. The company subscribes to Benchmark Minerals' Quarterly magazine 

which provides analysis of the battery raw materials markets (specifically lithium), and 

purchases specialist market analysis reports, as required.    

 

19.2 LITHIUM 
 

Lithium is the lightest of all metals, appearing at the top left-hand corner of the periodic table 

(atomic mass 6.9 and atomic number 3). It does not occur in nature in the metallic form but 

in the silicate minerals, spodumene, petalite and lepidolite, contained in pegmatites as at 

Separation Rapids. As noted above, the purpose of this PEA is to assess the recovery of 

petalite and lepidolite as mineral concentrates. 

 

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reports production of lithium minerals and products as 

shown in Table 19.1. In terms of gross product weight, Australia is the largest single 

producer of lithium minerals and chemicals, with output exceeding 400,000 t/y spodumene. 

Chile is the second ranking producer with a range of lithium chemicals recovered from 

subsurface brines.

USGS, 2017. 

 

Data reported by the USGS for 2016 and 2017 are provided in terms of contained lithium in 

the Mineral Commodity Summaries; on this basis, Australia and Chile are also the first and 

second largest producers (estimated at 18,700 t contained lithium and 14,100 t contained 

lithium, respectively in 2017), followed by Argentina and China (5,500 t contained lithium 

and 3,000 t contained lithium, respectively). The USGS data indicate that lithium minerals 

accounted for approximately 54% of the total in terms of contained lithium. (USGS, 2018a). 

 

19.2.1 End-use Sectors 
 

The USGS estimates global demand for lithium broken down by end-use sector as shown in 

Figure 19.1.  

 
Figure 19.1  

2017 Lithium Consumption by End-use Application 

 

 
USGS, 2018a. 

 

Consumption in batteries has increased significantly over the past five years, to the point 

where it now surpasses demand in ceramics and glass. Rechargeable lithium batteries are 

used in a wide range of applications including cell phones, cameras, portable electronic

 205 

devices and hand-held tools and, increasingly in electric vehicles and renewable energy 

storage. 

 

Lithium demand and supply may be expressed in terms of lithium carbonate equivalent 

(LCE) in order to compare lithium sources and prices. 

 

It is expected that demand for batteries and energy storage systems will continue to outpace 

other lithium demand sectors and will drive overall lithium demand. Predictions for lithium 

demand in 2025 range from approximately 525,000 t LCE to 875,000 t LCE, up from 

approximately 150,000 t LCE in 2016 (Avalon, internal data). These projections are based on 

the anticipation that as governments support the transition from a hydrocarbon-based 

economy, electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems will become increasingly 

important.  

 

19.2.2 Lithium Chemicals 
 

The battery and renewable energy storage sectors use lithium principally in the form of 

lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). Avalon plans to participate in the 

battery sector through the supply of lepidolite concentrate for processing by a third party into 

lithium carbonate.  

 

On 6 February, 2017, Avalon announced that a non-binding letter of intent had been signed 

with Lepidico Ltd. (Lepidico) of Australia for the supply of up to15,000 t/y of lepidolite 

concentrate to feed Lepidico's planned Phase 1 lithium carbonate demonstration plant in 

Sudbury, Ontario. Lepidico expects the feasibility study for this facility to be completed in 

September, 2018 (Lepidico, 2017). As of August, 2018, it is understood that Lepidico 

continues to be interested in purchasing lepidolite from Avalon. 

 

19.2.3 Glass and Ceramics 
 

As shown in Figure 19.1, glass and ceramics make up the second largest lithium end-use 

sector which is supplied by both lithium chemicals and mineral concentrates from hard rock 

deposits. These minerals are used as fluxes in the production of ceramic tiles and sanitary-, 

table- and cookware where the contained lithium provides certain advantages over other 

silicate minerals. Glass-ceramics, a group of products which share properties of traditional 

glasses and ceramics, are used in items such as glass cookware, ceramic cooktops and 

fireplace shields. The addition of lithium strengthens the glass and reduces melting 

temperatures. 

 

As described in Sections 13.0 and 17.0, Avalon will produce two grades of petalite: 50% of 

output will contain 4.5% Li2O and low levels of sodium and potassium ("Super Petalite"), 

and 50% will grade 4.0% Li2O. Samples of both grades have been well-received by potential 

end-users in the glass and glass-ceramics industries.  

 



 
 

 206 

19.3 FELDSPAR 
 

The feldspar group is by far the most abundant group of minerals in the earth's crust, forming 

about 60% of terrestrial rocks. Feldspar minerals, including nepheline syenite, are widely 

produced with global output reported by the USGS as summarized in Table 19.2.

USGS, 2018b. 

 

Data reported by the USGS for 2016 and 2017 show an increase in total production to 23,600 

thousand tonnes and 23,000 thousand tonnes, respectively (USGS, 2018c). 

 

Production is dominated by Turkey, Italy, China and India. Production in the United States 

has declined steadily over the past five years. The USGS does not report production from 

Canada. 

 

19.3.1 End-use Sectors 
 

Feldspar is used principally as a source of alumina and alkali metals for the glass and 

ceramics industries. The USGS estimates that the glass market for feldspar in the United 

States represents the largest market at around 60% with ceramics and other applications, 

including fillers, accounting for the balance (USGS, 2018c).  

 

In the manufacture of glass, feldspar is both an important raw material and a fluxing agent 

where it reduces the melting temperature of the glass batch and helps to control the viscosity 

of glass.  

 

In ceramics, feldspars are used as fluxing agents to form a glassy phase at low temperatures 

and as a source of alkali elements and alumina in glazes. They improve the strength, 

toughness, and durability of the ceramic body and cement the crystalline phase of other 

ingredients, softening, melting and wetting other batch constituents. In enamels and frits, 



 
 

 207 

feldspar assists the enamel composition, ensuring the absence of defects and the finish of the 

end product, such as ceramic tiles, sanitaryware, tableware, electrical porcelain and giftware.  

 

Feldspars also are used as fillers and extenders in applications such as paints, plastics and 

rubber. Beneficial properties of feldspars include good dispersability, high chemical 

inertness, stable pH, high resistance to abrasion, low viscosity at high filler loading, 

interesting refractive index and resistance to frosting. The products used in such applications 

are generally fine-milled grades. 

 

Further end-uses are in paints, mild abrasives, urethane, welding electrodes, latex foam and 

road aggregate. 

 

Testwork carried out by ANZAPLAN indicates that feldspar from the Separation Rapids 

property has a very low iron content and has similar chemical composition to the feldspars 

marketed by major North American producers. 

 

Through discussions with market participants and industry experts, and evaluation of data 

provided in purchased reports and publicly available information, Avalon estimates that an 

average of 70,000 t/y of feldspar can be sold into markets in the United States, Canada and 

Europe. Sales will be built up between Years 5 and 9 of the life of mine, to reach a steady 

rate of 100,000 t/y in Year 10. 

 

19.4 PRICES USED FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 

Avalon has carried out its own assessment of the markets for lepidolite, petalite and feldspar, 

based on purchased reports, information presented at conferences and discussions with 

industry participants and potential off-takers.  

 

The QP has reviewed the volume and pricing information prepared by Avalon and has 

independently confirmed that Avalon's projections are reasonable for the purpose of this 

PEA.  

 

19.5 CONTRACTS 
 

At this stage of development of the Separation Rapids property, there are no material 

contracts in place.  

 

In February, 2017, Avalon entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Lepidico for the 

supply of 15,000 t/y of lepidolite concentrate for Lepidico's demonstration plant.

20.0 ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, PERMITTING AND SOCIAL OR 
COMMUNITY IMPACT 

 

The information in this Section has been abstracted from the March, 2007, Project 

Description and Environmental Baseline Study Report (Knight Piésold, 2007), the 

September, 2013, Species at Risk Assessment (Knight Piésold, 2013), 2016 Tailing, Waste 

Rock and Water Management Plan (Knight Piésold, 2016a) and the 2016 PEA Conceptual 

Closure Plan (Knight Piésold, 2016b), prepared by Avalon's environmental consultant, 

Knight Piésold. The 2007 report was based largely on information collected in the late 1990s, 

and additional data collection to validate the conclusions of this study has been completed 

and is undergoing analysis to validate the earlier studies. Additional environmental testing of 

waste products has also been initiated in 2018 to validate earlier conclusions. A biological 

assessment of the newly proposed location of the Tailings Management Facility (TMF) was 

completed in 2018. Discussions with regulators have been initiated. 

 

20.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The Project site lies in an area adjacent to the English River, a regionally significant 

waterbody which supports a variety of wildlife and fisheries as well as tourism. The area 

surrounding the mine site is undeveloped and forested. The general arrangement of proposed 

mine development components is shown on Figure 20.1. 

 

20.2 PROJECT APPROVALS AND PERMITTING 
 

20.2.1 Separation Rapids Permitting 
 

The Federal and Ontario Provincial permitting processes are well defined and understood. 

The Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDM) is responsible for coordinating 

the various regulatory agencies in the mine permitting process.   

 

A Project Description and comprehensive Environmental Baseline Report of the mine and 

concentrator site was completed in March 2007, updated from the July, 1999 draft. The 2007 

report included a preliminary environmental impact assessment, although this was based on a 

different project development model to that presently envisaged. It is expected that given that 

there has been little development activity at the site since 1999, the vast majority of the 

baseline assessment work will be adequate for the foundation of an assessment of potential 

environmental impacts and all permitting work, with only minor work required to validate 

the data.

A Species at Risk Act (SARA) study for the mine and concentrator site area was completed 

in September, 2013 (Knight Piésold, 2013). Subsequent site environmental investigations 

have confirmed that no endangered or at-risk animal or plant species exist at site. Discussions 

with responsible Ministries regarding potential additional updates were held in late 2016, 

although these were based on a larger and more complex business model than the 2018 

business model described in this PEA. 

 

Additional environmental baseline data were collected in the spring and fall of 2017 and July 

2018 and analyses of these data are ongoing to augment and validate the environmental data 

in the original Project Description and Environmental Baseline Report. Additional testing on 

all waste products based on the most recent flow sheet was initiated.  

 

A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed with the Wabaseemoong First Nation and 

a detailed presentation based on the 2017 business model was provided to Chief and Council. 

Preliminary discussions, including a Valued Components Workshop were similarly held with 

the Métis Nation of Ontario. Preliminary discussions have been held with the Dalles and 

Grassy Narrows First Nation bands as well, though it is Avalon's understanding that their 

indigenous rights are subject to those of the Wabaseemoong Independent Nation (WIN) who 

have a Stewardship Agreement with the Province of Ontario. This agreement, in partial 

compensation for the required relocation of WIN communities due to the construction of 

hydroelectric dams, gives them joint control of natural resource development in the Project 

area with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF). Discussions are also 

ongoing with political and community representatives. Engagement is expected to continue 

through the life of the Project. The Project has strong community support. 

 

20.2.2 Mine and Floatation Plant 
 

Avalon already has an Advanced Exploration Approval based on an approved closure plan, 

though it is presently in a state of inactivity and is permitted for 15,000 t of material. Prior to 

construction of the concentrator and finalization of a Feasibility Study, a 30-t bulk sample 

will be processed in a pilot plant to validate the laboratory scale work. This sample will be 

acquired from existing broken rock from previous test programs and rehabilitation work to 

improve access and egress to the existing exploration area (centre Figure 20.2 below). 

Exploration permits for additional drilling on site were acquired from MNDM for drill 

programs in 2016 and 2017. There programs were successfully completed without any 

environmental impacts. The present permit allows for nearby future expanded areas of 

exploration on recently acquired claims.  

 



 
 

 211 

Figure 20.2  

2017 Photo of the Separation Rapids Site 

     

 
 

The present business model now envisages the production of lepidolite, petalite and feldspar 

concentrates. Mining will be by conventional truck and shovel open pit mining. Preliminary 

mining plans comprise typically the excavation of approximately 338,000 t/y of petalite 

mineralization and 137,000 t/y of lepidolite mineralization for 18.5 years, averaging 475,000 

t/y, or less than 2,000 tonnes/day. A concentrator located on-site will produce three products 

(petalite concentrate, lepidolite concentrate and feldspar concentrate) Lepidolite and petalite 

mineralization will be processed separately, necessitating small plant feed and concentrate 

storage stockpiles near the concentrator. Concentrate, aggregate (waste rock) dumps, and a 

TMF will be managed at the site. A separate magnetics storage area is also planned in 

anticipation that a process can be developed to recover lithium from this process stream. 

Additionally, a storage area will be constructed near the plant site for temporary storage of up 

to 150,000 tonnes of lepidolite tailings for future reprocessing to recover petalite. All stored 

products will be either whole rock or filtered and stacked tailings. 

 

Due to the relatively small scale of the Project and the site being located well away from any 

federally protected areas, and because the capacity of the mine and concentrator are 

approximately half the tonnage triggers in the Federal Environmental Assessment Act 2012, 

permitting under this act does not apply. As such, permitting time lines are significantly 

reduced. 

 



 
 

 212 

The proposed site of the TMF was selected under the basis of initial verbal reports from an 

external environmental consultant study that stated that this area did not contain fish. 

However, additional work in the area has recently identified it as containing small 

populations of three minnow species. It is likely that these are temporary populations that are 

periodically lost due to beaver dam failures and/or winter conditions during which the small 

ponds freeze to or near the bottom, and/or periods of drought that dry up these small water 

bodies thus eliminating these populations until conditions for life return. As a result, there is 

potential to trigger the Fisheries Act due to the location of the TMF at this location. 

Discussions with the WIN, MNRF and Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans are 

planned to determine the extent of any required compensation or offsets required for the 

temporary loss of this small amount of fish habitat. It is noted that both the TMF and open pit 

can become fish habitat post closure, though discussions with stakeholders regarding post 

closure land use are ongoing. These discussions and any approvals that may be required are 

anticipated to take approximately one year. 

 

A number of provincial environmental permits will be required. These permits are approved 

by Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (MNDN), Ministry of Natural Resources 

and Forestry (MNRF) and the Provincial Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks 

(MECP, formally MOECC) and Ministry of Health (MOH). Additional non-environmental 

approvals under the Ministry of Labour will also be required for construction and operations. 

 

A Project Description of the 2017 activities, which was based on the previous project criteria 

outlined in the 2016 PEA, was prepared and reviewed with all applicable regulators. No fatal 

flaws were identified associated with this more complex design with greater potential for 

environmental impacts than this current business model described in this updated PEA.  

 

A closure plan will be required for the Project. This includes filed financial assurance to 

complete the rehabilitation of the site once the Project is completed. Depending on whether 

or not additional engagement is required, the time line for this will range from 45 days to 3-4 

months. Financial assurance is in place for the original advanced exploration program and 

these funds will be allocated to the Project. Given the extent of the rehabilitation work 

completed to date (camp removed, signage installed, pit egress improved, significant areas 

already self-re-vegetated), no additional short-term financial assurance is anticipated.  

 

Long term assurance will eventually be required to rehabilitate the TMF, remove 

infrastructure, roads and for re-vegetation. There will be two aggregate (waste rock) 

stockpiles on site. One will be cost effectively rehabilitated during operations with material 

recovered from the site of the second stockpile. Stored organic material from the stripping of 

the first stockpile will be utilized at closure for the second stockpile. The pit will have an 

access/egress designed into it. Discussions are ongoing with stakeholders regarding potential 

beneficial reuse of the site post closure and include forestry, rice production and aquaculture 

in the flooded pit. 

 



 
 

 213 

Avalon has acquired the existing Nelson Granite quarry and associated permit along the 

present access road to ensure ongoing road access. No additional quarry or aggregate permits 

will be required. This assures that the access route is fully controlled by Avalon. 

 

20.2.3 Construction, Operations and Closure 
 

The Separations Rapids Lithium Project approval time line is governed by the time required 

to obtain individual construction and operating permits, none of which are anticipated to 

exceed 1 year. In discussions with the regulator, the Federal Canadian Environmental 

Assessment Act process from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) is not 

anticipated to apply as the Project does not exceed any of the applicable triggers. Given that 

the power supply will be distribution (vs transmission), permitting is limited to those required 

by MNRF and this is also anticipated to be less than one year. Discussions are ongoing with 

Hydro One regarding the optimal source and route for the transmission line from local hydro 

electric supply.   

 

The following key permits and approvals are expected to be required: 

• Certified Closure Plan under the Mining Act from the Ontario MNDM for the full 
project. 

• Environmental Compliance Approvals (ECA) under the Ontario Environmental 
Protection Act and Ontario Water Resources Act for effluent waste water and sewage 

treatment management from the MOECC and MOH for the mine site. 

• An ECA will be required for all significant air discharges from the MOECC. The 
significant air discharges requiring permits will be those associated with discharges 

from dust collection systems and for emissions from back-up power generation at the 

concentrator.   

• Permit for explosives storage on site from the Ontario Ministry of Labour (MOL). 

• Approval of the containment structures under the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act 
(LRIA) from the MNRF and MNDM will be required initially, and any future 

expansions will require approval from the Ministry of Northern Development and 

Mines. 

• Permit to take water for process and potable (drinking) water from the MOECC for 
the mine and concentrator site.  

• A Waste Generator Approval is required under the Ontario Environmental Protection 
Act. This will include permits to temporarily store wastes on site prior to sending to 

an appropriate licensed disposal/landfill facility. As a landfill site is not presently 

contemplated at site, an associated permit is not required. 

• Additional Work Permits under the Forest Fires Prevention Act, Lakes and Rivers 
Improvement Act and Public Lands Act will be required from the MNRF for use of 

public lands, power line, lake and river crossings and forest fire prevention. 

 



 
 

 214 

The Tailing Management Facility (TMF) impacts on temporary fisheries habitat. Pending 

discussions with the WIN, MNRF and Department of Fisheries and Oceans, authorization 

under the Fisheries Act from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) may be 

required. An approval under the SARA from ECCC or MNRF is not expected to be required 

based on the SARA study. This study was completed in 2013 and no species listed under the 

act were identified as living on site, though Little Brown Bats are known to visit (Knight 

Piésold, 2013). Subsequent site investigations did not identify any additional species of 

concern in the immediate areas of planned Project infrastructure. 

 

Authorizations under the Navigation Act will not be required as a dock is already at the mine 

site and no additional work that could cause an obstruction to the waterway is planned.  

 

Additional minor approvals with short approval time lines will also periodically be required 

such as those necessary for small radiation sources for monitoring or laboratory analytical 

equipment for example. 

 

The key steps and time line for the permitting process include the following: 

• Update and review the Project Description with the Federal CEAA Agency. This will 
include validation that the triggers in the CEAA are not exceeded. Provincial permits 

may take up to a year to complete but known key critical path permits may be 

initiated as soon as the technical data are available.   

• Environmental Compliance Approval (ECA). This will be required from the Ontario 
MECP for effluent discharged and for air emissions.  

• Approval of the containment structures under the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act 
(LRIA) from the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry. This is on the critical 

path.  

• Provincial regulatory approvals, anticipated to take approximately 1 year.  

• Once the route of the transmission line is identified, approvals for this will be initiated 
with the Ministry of Natural Resources but are not anticipated to be critical path.  

• Discussions with the Federal Fisheries Act personnel will be initiated once input from 
the WIN has been obtained.

20.2.4 Conclusion 
 

The Avalon Separation Rapids Lithium Project is a small-scale mining project without many 

of the risks frequently found at other mines such as acid mine drainage. Based on the earlier 

studies, all tailings mine rock aggregate and concentrate materials are expected to be inert, air 

and water quantities utilized and discharged are relatively small and can be managed to 

acceptable standards with conventional technologies. However, until such time as this 

information is validated for the final process design, as a precaution and to minimize fresh 

water use, as much of the water as is feasible will be recycled back to the concentrator. 

Similarly, remaining runoff water will be treated for suspended solids in settling ponds.  

 

Water quality assumptions are being validated by humidity cell test work that simulates long 

term runoff quality.  

 

Meetings have already been held with all key regulators to develop positive relationships 

early and to review the proposed Project. Through this early engagement, specific concerns 

are identified, and all required studies can be completed in a timely manner so that there are 

no surprises during the permitting process. Similarly, positive relationships have already 

been developed with Indigenous Peoples, political and community representatives.  

 

The mine site is approximately 70 km from the city of Kenora where there is an educated 

workforce knowledgeable and supportive of the Project.  

 

The permitting project is being managed by Avalon's Vice President, Sustainability, who has 

extensive permitting experience and a track record of successful permitting with support 

from similarly experienced consultants. An external gap analysis regarding the information 

required to permit the Project has been completed by Knight Piésold, a qualified consultant 

and all requirements have been identified.   

 

Given the relatively small size and low environmental risk, permits should be acquired in a 

timely manner that will not negatively impact the Project schedule. 

 

20.3 ENVIRONMENTAL BASELINE 
 

For the mine and concentrator site, an environmental baseline study program has been 

conducted, investigating regional and site-specific aspects such as water quality, hydrology, 

vegetation, wildlife, fisheries, archaeology, and socioeconomics. The ecology of the Project 

area was investigated with field visits carried out in all four seasons during 1998 and 1999. 

The majority of these data are still valid and utilizable, and some additional work has been 

completed related to regulatory changes since this study.  

 

Plans are in place to further update or validate this information in the next project phase, in 

consultation with all communities of interest. This is based in part on a gap analysis that has 

been completed by Knight Piésold to ensure the data will be comprehensive, historical data 



 
 

 216 

are validated and to ensure all potential areas impacted by the Project are evaluated in line 

with present regulatory requirements. 

 

20.4 TOPOGRAPHY 
 

The English River is located within the Severn Upland region of the Canadian Shield, which 

generally comprises low rolling bedrock hills overlain by a mantle of Wisconsinan glacial 

deposits. Elevations on the Project site range from approximately 310 masl to 370 masl, 

while elevations within 5 km of the site range between 310 and 410 masl. The SRP and the 

Great White North deposits immediately to the northwest are prominent topographic features 

of the Project site, with elevations of 352 m and 366 m, respectively.  

 

The deposit topographic feature will be removed in the process of developing the open pit, 

however, the Great White North deposit will remain adjacent to the pit at this time. Two 

mine rock aggregate stockpiles (waste rock) located west of the open pit will reach a 

maximum elevation of 442 masl, which are marginally higher than the range of elevations 

found within 5 km of the Project site. Several potential mine rock aggregate storage facility 

arrangements were investigated in order to minimize both the areal extent and the final height 

of the facilities, within a reasonable haul distance of the open pit. A third small (180,000 

tonne) crushed aggregate stockpile (fine aggregate) consisting of the rejects from the 

mineralized material sorting will be stockpiled near the concentrator and will be ideal 

material for ongoing infrastructure construction such as the concentrate and tailing storage 

facilities, road maintenance and pit road construction. Given that petalite and lepidolite 

concentrator feed material will be processed at different times but in the same circuit, an 

additional temporary 150,000 tonne stockpile will be utilized to temporarily store lepidolite 

tails for future reprocessing to recover petalite. 

 

20.5 AIR QUALITY 
 

Due to the mine site location, air quality is considered to be good and is not affected by long 

range atmospheric pollutants. Air quality will be potentially affected primarily by dust 

emissions from haulage roads, blasting, mine rock aggregate stockpiles, and the TMF, of 

which the Tailing storage poses the greatest potential risk. There will also be some 

intermittent emission from the back-up power generation system. Wind erosion of tailings 

should be minimized due to the location of the TMF in a valley bottom, shielded by higher 

hills and the mine rock aggregate management facility, and the generally moderate winds in 

the locality of the site. Dust control, such as the use of water or recycled water, will be 

utilized as appropriate to mitigate potential impacts. Dust monitoring will be implemented. 

 

20.6 NOISE 
 

With the exception of light motor boat traffic on the English River in summer and snow 

machine traffic in winter, background noise levels are low. Noise will be generated during 

construction and operational phases of the mine due to blasting, mill operation and vehicular 

traffic. Potential mitigation measures include natural sound 'baffles' (i.e., locating the 



 
 

 217 

concentrator site behind hills), the use of sound insulation in building construction, 

enforcement of speed limits on access roads, and suitable timing of blasting. The nearest 

permanent residences are sufficiently distant to not be impacted by the site. 

 

20.7 HYDROLOGY 
 

The major receiving water for surface water flow from the mine site is the English River, 

which flows from near the town of Dryden for approximately 420 km in a northwesterly 

direction, through a chain of lakes extending from Wabigoon Lake in Ontario, to Lake 

Winnipeg in Manitoba. In 1957, a hydroelectric dam was constructed at Caribou Falls, 

approximately 60 km downstream of the Project site, and this had a major influence upon the 

physical characteristics of the English River, forming Umphreville Lake, with flooding 

extending upstream to near the Project site. 

 

The Project area is drained by four small streams. Stream C, a small intermittent drainage 

flows from the proposed open pit location north into Avalon Bay and is not identified as fish 

habitat.  A swamp located at the southwest edge of the deposit also did not contain fish and 

intermittently drains south into an abandoned beaver pond, and then east into a stream 

(Stream B) leading into Storm Bay. Storm Bay is a large, shallow water body with a 

constricted mouth, which leads into the main English River channel. A stream further to the 

southwest of the pit (Stream D) also drains the area to the south west. If not recycled back to 

the concentrator, treated (settling only) runoff from inert tailing will contribute to the 

downstream flows. Stream A, known to be fish habitat and located to the north and west of 

the Project, will not be utilized for storage of mine rock aggregate, concentrate or tailing. 

 

Construction of the proposed mine site will have an effect on site hydrology. Significant 

efforts to minimize this impact have been made, including the use of dry stacked tailing.  

 

The northern part of the intermittent component of Stream B and the wetland on the 

southwest edge of the deposit that is not considered fish habitat, will be consumed by the pit 

and mine rock aggregate management area. For the purposes of this PEA, the components 

south of the existing access road (and small waterfall that acts as a fish barrier) that 

eventually becomes fish habitat will not be disturbed by the Project. The proposed open pit 

will occupy most of the drainage area of the small intermittent non-fish bearing stream 

flowing into Avalon Bay (Stream C). 

 

Local and regional hydrology will not be affected by mine development, as the proposed 

mine will occupy less than 2 km2 in area. This is not significant in terms of total size of the 

English River and the Storm Bay watersheds and, since no significant effluent discharge 

quantities are projected from mine operations, no hydrological impacts are predicted. The site 

drainage system is shown in Figure 20.3.

20.8 WATER QUALITY 
 

Results of a 12-month surface water quality monitoring program on the English River during 

1998-1999 revealed that median concentrations of the majority of parameters monitored are 

comparable to those expected in a river free of major contaminant inputs. Provincial Water 

Quality Objectives (PWQO) were at times exceeded for aluminum, cadmium, copper, 

mercury, lead, silver and zinc, which is not unusual for catchments containing mineralized 

zones. 

 

A baseline surface water quality monitoring program was initiated in streams on the 

proposed mine site. Aluminum was found to exceed PWQO which, in the absence of known 

anthropogenic sources, is most likely due to natural weathering of soils and bedrock. PWQO 

concentrations for cadmium, copper, iron, lead and zinc were also exceeded. Baseline water 

quality data will be used to define water quality goals on closure of the proposed mine. 

 

The preliminary characterization testing indicates that the mine rock and mineralized 

material will not be acid generating. Additional work in 2015 analyzed selected "worst case" 

mine rock samples. Even the single highest and rare sulphide bearing samples with visible 

sulphidic material had a carbonate: sulphur ratio of 8:1, further supporting this conclusion. 

Impacts to the water quality of receiving waters could potentially result from runoff from the 

waste rock storage facilities or TMF. Parameters of potential concern may include total 

suspended solids, organic reagents and brine used during processing, and residual trace 

metals from weathering of waste rock and tailings. However, the preliminary Synthetic 

Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) 1312 tests on mineralized material, mine rock, and 

tailings suggest that runoff would not contain any parameters that would exceed the Metal 

and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations (MDMER). All mine rock will thus be stored as 

aggregate for future utilization. Laboratory kinetic tests (humidity cells), which mimics 

accelerated weathering of the rock over time, have been initiated. 

 

Nitrate is a potential nutrient of concern that can be generated by the use of ammonium 

nitrate blasting agents. Phosphorus is not a concern from the mineralized material, mine rock 

aggregate, processing or the minor quantities of treated sewage. On this basis, eutrophication 

from nitrate is unlikely due to the fact that phosphorus is normally the limiting nutrient in 

northern Ontario waters. Regardless, best management practices for blasting will be 

incorporated, and monitoring of nitrogen compound concentrations will be part of the 

ongoing monitoring plans. In the event that nitrates approach concentrations of concern, 

strategies can include the use of emulsions, mine employee retraining in ammonium nitrate 

management and investigation of the maintenance of ammonium nitrate storage and/or 

loading equipment or using wetland treatment.  

 

Several measures to mitigate impacts to water quality can be incorporated into the Project 

plan, including: 

1. Recycling and potentially treating process water in the concentrator to minimize fresh 
water requirements and the rate of discharge to the environment. 



 
 

 220 

2. Diversion of non-impacted site runoff away from the site to reduce impacted water 
volume. 

3. To significantly reduce the risk from tailings water at the TMF, tailings will not be 
hydraulically placed and will be filtered and trucked to the TMF as solids.   

4. Collection and treatment of process and pit and runoff water from the TMF in the 
concentrator to the extent feasible to reduce fresh water use. 

5. Construction of a final clarification pond to remove suspended solids and facilitate 
treatment from the TMF and mine rock aggregate surface runoff (if necessary) prior 

to discharge to the environment. 

6. Some water from the TMF is assumed to be recycled back to the concentrator to 
minimize fresh water consumption.     

7. If determined necessary or beneficial, the option to install a submerged pipe fitted 
with an end diffuser to discharge water from the settling/event pond and/or the treated 

water from the concentrator into the main channel of the English River in order to 

maximize mixing and the assimilative capacity of the river will be considered. This 

would reduce potential impacts to water quality in Storm Bay, which has a relatively 

small catchment area, water volume and outflow, and therefore would have a low 

assimilative capacity for effluent. 

 

During the next phase of the Project, when additional water and waste products will be 

available from tests undertaken using the final process flow sheet, additional water quality 

testing will be completed on all waste streams. Humidity cell and additional water quality 

and biological toxicity studies are ongoing on additional mine rock aggregate, concentrate 

and tailing samples. A water treatment process will be developed and tested if necessary to 

meet regulatory requirements. Given the relatively small surface area impacted, impacts to 

the relatively small water quantity and quality as a result of mine development are considered 

to be mitigatable and not significant. 

 

20.9 GROUNDWATER 
 

Groundwater hydrogeology will be of major importance during mine development due to the 

close proximity of the planned open pit to the English River. A detailed hydrogeological 

assessment of the mine site is scheduled for completion during the next phase of the Project, 

including an assessment of groundwater and an evaluation of the hydrogeological conditions 

near the proposed open pit. A key focus will be on the future pit dewatering requirements, pit 

stability and the engineering requirements for the mine rock aggregate, tailings and 

concentrate management areas.   

 

Existing data suggests that bedrock underlying the site is relatively impermeable, which 

would reduce the risk of groundwater impacts. As the tailing/concentrate and mine rock 

aggregate will also not be acid generating, acid mine drainage is not considered an issue at 

this site. Dry stacking of tailing further reduces this risk.   

 



 
 

 221 

Dewatering of the open pit will create a groundwater drawdown cone in the vicinity of the 

pit. The planned detailed hydrogeological investigation will evaluate the potential impacts of 

the drawdown cone between the pit and the river. This may result in elevated flows from the 

river into the pit that will require management to ensure the safe operation of the pit. During 

development and operation of the pit, water inflow from the English River to the open pit via 

groundwater will be monitored. Significant groundwater inflows to the pit may be controlled 

by grouting. 

 

20.10 VEGETATION 
 

The Project is located in the boreal forest region. The dominant tree species found on the 

Project site are jack pine and black spruce. The site is characterized by thin soils and dry site 

vegetation communities, as well as several wetland communities, including a black spruce 

swamp immediately adjacent and to the southwest of the deposit, as well as several marsh 

communities adjacent to the English River. Upland vegetation communities observed 

included conifer, mixed wood and hardwood forests, and blowdown areas, while wetland 

vegetation communities include treed and shrub swamp, marsh, sand shrub or graminoid 

fens. Some additional work may be required following additional engagement or to address 

potential new areas impacted. No unique, rare or endangered plant species or vegetation 

community types were observed or are expected. 

 

Development of the proposed mine will result in direct impacts to the vegetation of the site. 

Vegetation will be removed from the Project development area, including the open pit, plant 

site and waste storage areas. The major components of impact and their areal extent are listed 

in Table 20.1. 

 
Table 20.1  

Areal Extent of Major Project Components at the Separation Rapids Site 

 

Item Area (ha) 

Open pit 25.0 

Concentrator site 1.1 

Tailings and concentrate management area 57.0 

East coarse rock aggregate stockpile 34.0 

West coarse rock aggregate stockpile 32.0 

Fine aggregate stockpile 1.5 

Temporary lepidolite tails stockpile 3.3 

 

Thus, the total impacted area, excluding roads, will be approximately 1.57 km2. In a regional 

context, this is not considered to be significant since the Project site is surrounded by un-

impacted forested land. 

 

In the absence of an identified beneficial use for the site, the mine site will be revegetated on 

closure to restore the disturbed area to as close to pre-mine conditions as possible, and thus 

reduce long term impacts. Three topsoil stockpiles have been proposed during initial mine 

construction to facilitate mine site revegetation after closure. 

 



 
 

 222 

The potential surficial impacts to the mine site will be minimized by containing mine rock, 

Tailing products within engineered storage facilities, such as the TMF and the mine rock 

aggregate storage facilities. 

 

The Kenora 2012-2017 Forest Management Plan identified a 90 m "No Cut Zone" between 

the mineralized zone and the English River. This plan is being updated. These zones are 

identified based on a computer-generated algorithm that is based on land slope and other 

factors and are not substantiated by site visits. These plans do not hold authority over mining 

applications. While Avalon wishes to maintain a treed visual barrier between the mine site 

and the river, the edge of this no cut zone could potentially be impacted by the open pit. As a 

precaution, a submission to the plan developers to correct the zone from 90 m width to a 30 

m width as required based on the actual slope of the area, was requested. This will avoid 

overlap of the pit and the no cut zone and continue to provide a protected area to help 

mitigate runoff from the site. 

 

20.11 WILDLIFE 
 

Wildlife in the Project area is abundant, with the species observed typical of Ontario's boreal 

forests. Large flocks of common mergansers were observed at Separation Rapids during 

spring migration, while common mergansers, common goldeneyes, buffleheads and mallards 

were observed breeding in the Project area. Moose were the most common ungulate observed 

on the Project site, while black bear, wolf, fisher, red fox, marten, mink, and otter are 

common carnivorous species. Small mammals, rodents and lagomorphs observed included 

deer mouse, beaver, red squirrel, muskrat and snowshoe hare. Wood frog, leopard frog and 

American toad were the most common amphibian species, while painted turtles were 

observed in Avalon Bay, and garter snakes were observed on site. Woodland caribou were 

not observed. 

 

As noted above, a SARA was completed in 2013 (Knight Piésold, 2013), and additional 

observances of wildlife continued to be monitored during 2017 and 2018 studies. Bald eagles 

and white pelicans, which are on the Ontario Endangered Species list, were encountered in 

the Project area. Bald eagles and white pelicans are both piscivores and no feeding 

opportunities for these species exist on the Project site. Bald eagles' nest in close proximity 

to water in conspicuous large stick nests that are used year after year and are usually located 

in trees a few metres from the shores of large water bodies. The closest bald eagle nest is 

over 1 km east of the proposed mine development. The white pelicans observed on the 

English River near the Project site had likely moved into the area for summer feeding from 

the main pelican population and breeding ground on the Three Sisters Island in Lake of the 

Woods. It is concluded that mine development will not adversely impact bald eagle or white 

pelican populations. Little Brown Bats were identified on site, but no nesting habitat was 

identified. Some additional SARA work may be required following additional engagement or 

to address potential new areas impacted. Engagement with the indigenous community has 

identified moose as an important animal to them. Moose have been known to periodically 

visit the area of the mine site. Mitigations include the development of travel corridors in the 

Project design along Stream A and parts of Stream B and D. Given the small overall 



 
 

 223 

environmental footprint of the Project, the mobility of moose and the abundant local 

undisturbed areas in the vicinity of the mine site, no significant impacts are anticipated. 

 

The Project site is relatively small in a regional context and contains no rare or significant 

wildlife habitat components. As with the moose, most of the mammals inhabiting the site, 

with the possible exception of small mammals, will simply be displaced to the adjacent 

abundant suitable habitat. Since small mammals are generally prolific breeders, they are not 

sensitive to extirpation, and populations will re-expand to the capacity of the environment 

very quickly. The proposed mine development is not predicted to have a significant impact 

on wildlife. 

 

20.12 FISHERIES 
 

A significant recreational fishery exists on the English River in the Project area, providing 

income to local tourism outfitters and recreation for local anglers. The use of the fishery for 

subsistence by local First Nation communities has been restricted following historical 

contamination of the river with mercury, discharged from a pulp and paper mill located 

upstream. The major target species were identified as walleye, northern pike, and smallmouth 

bass. A benthic macroinvertebrate community monitoring program was conducted in 1998 to 

characterize fish habitat. 

 

A northern pike spawning site was observed in Goose Bay, at the mouth of the stream 

flowing south of the proposed mine site into Storm Bay. The streams immediately to the 

north and the south of the Project site both have populations of baitfish, including finescale 

dace, northern redbelly dace, fathead minnow, bluntnose minnow and ninespine stickleback. 

Since these streams are within a licensed baitfish block, there is a potential for commercial 

exploitation of the bait fishery, and therefore, the streams would be classified as fisheries 

habitat by the DFO. For this reason, no deposits of any mine rock or tailings are planned in 

these streams. 

 

A third stream (Stream D) further south and west of the Project has been selected for the 

TMF. This facility is planned to be located in the upper intermittent reaches of this stream in 

an effort to avoid direct impacts on permanent fisheries habitat.  Potential for impacts from 

runoff on downstream populations are low given that the tailings are non-acid generating and 

are not hydraulically deposited. Further, preliminary SPLP 1312 tests suggest little potential 

to impact streams. Unanticipated impacts to the downstream area dominated by wetland also 

have water quality polishing capability. Significant impacts to fisheries are expected to be 

mitigatable. Similarly, the mine rock aggregate is not expected to generate leachates of 

concern, and simple settling of solids will be completed to mitigate this risk. Additional 

testing is planned in the next project phase.  

 

Contrary to previous indications (1998 and 1999 baseline data collection), Stream D was 

found to contain three minnow species inhabiting the stream, at least intermittently, during a 

July, 2018 study. Initially, due to the fisheries habitat located in Stream B, it was decided not 

to utilize Stream B for tailing, mine rock aggregate or concentrate management. However, a 



 
 

 224 

2017 study determined that fish no longer inhabit Stream B. For the purposes of this PEA, 

Stream D will remain as the location for the tailing management infrastructure, though it is 

likely that both streams B and D will not contain fish on a full-time basis due to low flow 

conditions, freezing to the bottom in winter, or periodic beaver dam failures that flush fish 

from the system. The final selection of the tailing infrastructure will be the subject of a trade-

off technical study in the next project phase. This decision will also include additional 

engagement with stakeholders for their input to the decision as to the preferred location of 

this infrastructure. 

 

20.13 TAILINGS AND CONCENTRATE MANAGEMENT 
 

The principal objective of the TMF is to provide the safe and secure storage of the process 

waste products while ensuring the protection of the environment during operations and in the 

long-term (after closure). The conceptual level design of the TMF has taken into account the 

following requirements:  

• Permanent, secure and total confinement of all process waste products within an 
engineered facility. 

• Control, collection and removal of free draining liquids from the tailings during 
operations for recycling as process water to the maximum practical extent. 

• The inclusion of monitoring features for all aspects of the facility to ensure 
performance goals are achieved and design criteria and assumptions are met. 

• Secure reclamation and closure of the impoundment after mining is complete. 

• The flexibility to reprocess select by-products (concentrates) at a future date. 
  

The TMF design includes the initial starter arrangement and ongoing raises to the facility 

throughout the life of the operation.  

 

Approximately 1.0 Mt of magnetics concentrate, 0.8 Mt of tailing slime, and 0.3 Mt of 

feldspar tailing and 5.0 Mt of petalite tailings will be produced over the life of the Project. 

The magnetics will be stored separately due to their potential to be re-processed in the future. 

Some feldspar production is planned, limited by annual markets for this material. The TMF 

will consist of valley impoundment type facilities located west and southwest of the plant site 

as shown above in Figure 20.1. Tailings will be filtered in the concentrator and trucked to the 

TMF as solids. The petalite tailings and feldspar concentrate will be mixed with the slimes 

material to aid in the filtration process.    

 

The TMF is located approximately 1.5 km southwest of the open pit as shown in Figure 20.1 

above. The facility will be constructed as three distinct cells as previously noted. The 

Magnetics Concentrate cell will be located at the north side of the area, while the Feldspar 

Tailing, Slimes and Petalite Flotation Tails will be stored in the two other cells of the TMF. 

The tailings, slimes and concentrates, to be filtered at the plant, will be transported to the 

TMF by truck, placed and compacted in horizontal lifts starting at the base of the cells and 

advanced up slope of the basin floor and side slopes. In areas not confined by natural ground, 



 
 

 225 

the tailings/concentrates will be buttressed with 20 m wide (min) mine rock berms around the 

perimeter.  

 

20.13.1 Tailings Management Facility (TMF) 
 

Potential optimization is available for the storage of these materials. This includes an 

economic trade off study of storage in Stream D vs Stream B, and the potential opportunities 

associated with combining the remaining materials in the same management area to reduce 

capital and operating costs. 

 

20.13.2 Mine Rock Aggregate and Mineralized Material Management 
 

Given the inert nature of the waste material from the open pit and the scarcity of aggregate in 

the area, all mine rock is considered as utilizable aggregate product. Approximately 52.6 Mt 

of coarse mine rock aggregate and 0.18 Mt of crushed and optically sorted rejects (fine 

aggregate) will be generated during the life of the Project. The aggregate materials will 

consist primarily of amphibolite and pegmatitic granite rock, with a lesser amount of 

feldspathic material. At this stage, these materials will be managed together. The coarse mine 

rock aggregate will be placed in two storage areas to the west of the open pit while the fine 

aggregate will be stored near the concentrator for easy access for road maintenance, storage 

facility construction and pit road construction. 

 

The mine rock aggregate materials have been characterized as non-acid generating based 

upon the results of the preliminary laboratory testwork carried out in the Project Description 

and Environment Baseline Study (Knight Piésold, 2007), and in additional recent 

assessments of "worst case" materials, it is not expected that the mine rock aggregate storage 

areas will require any facilities for control or adjustment of pH in relation to acid rock 

drainage. In general, the rock is expected to be benign (although there is the potential for 

some minor leaching of metals as a result of natural weathering). For the purposes of this 

preliminary economic assessment therefore, sediment control and closure issues have been 

determined to be the key environmental design factors. 

 

Current planning of the mine rock aggregate storage facilities includes the following 

considerations: 

1. Minimum surficial and environmental impacts, including not utilizing fisheries 
habitat. 

2. Minimum visual impacts. 

3. Minimum impact on potential sites of heritage value. 

4. Close proximity to the pit to minimize the haul distances and grades. 

5. Maximum integration with other project facilities where this is beneficial. 

6. Minimum of 100 m from the edge of the open pit. 



 
 

 226 

7. Ensuring that the facilities can be safely and securely rehabilitated in accordance with 
best available practices at the end of the mine life. 

8. Minimum of 30 m (normally over 75 m) from wetlands and 120 m from significant 
water bodies. 

 

For the purposes of this PEA, the volumes of mine rock aggregate materials that will be 

generated by the Project have been estimated using a specific gravity of 2.9 and an 

excavation swell factor of 1.3, giving a placement density of 2.23 t/m3. Based on this density, 

the total volumes of feldspathic material and pegmatitic granite mine rock aggregate that are 

expected to be generated over the mine life are approximately 23.6 Mm3. An updated 

estimate of the placement density should be completed at a subsequent stage in the design of 

the Project. 

 

Figure 20.1 (above) shows the general arrangement of the three-mine rock aggregate storage 

facilities for the Project. The two coarse aggregate management areas will occupy an area of 

about 66 ha. They will be developed to a maximum elevation of approximately 442 m which 

will give them a maximum height of about 70 m. It is planned that the coarse aggregate 

produced during the initial years of mining will be placed in the nearest facility due to its 

shorter haul distance from the pit, moving to more distant facilities as the nearer site reaches 

its capacity. The maximum elevation will not be substantially different to similar topography 

located within 5 km of the site. The relatively small volume (0.18 Mm3) of crushed fine 

aggregate material will be stored next to the plant site. 

 

Small quantities of run of mine mineralized material will be stored in contained areas 

adjacent to or within the plant site 

 

There will be no waste material located at the metallurgical plant site. All concentrate feed 

will be stored inside the facility. 

 

20.14 SEWAGE TREATMENT 
 

Domestic sewage will be generated from the mine dry, processing plant, and office areas. 

The daily loading of sewage and grey water can be expected to be approximately 11,000 L, 

based on a total of 75 contractor and full-time employees using the facilities during three 

shifts over a 24 h period. 

 

The sewage and grey water will be conveyed in sanitary sewer pipes to a permitted septic 

system located adjacent to the processing plant. Two suitably sized septic tanks, operating in 

parallel, will provide the necessary capacity and the flexibility for system maintenance. Grey 

water will be decanted from the septic tanks and discharged into a septic field. The sludge 

which accumulates in the bottom of the septic tanks will be regularly pumped out and 

transported offsite for disposal by a licensed contractor.  

 



 
 

 227 

20.15 WATER MANAGEMENT 
 

The design and implementation of a comprehensive water management plan for the mine site 

will be fundamental to the Project. The key water management issues will centre around 

handling the following: 

• Open pit runoff and seepage. 

• Runoff from the plant site. 

• Runoff from the mine rock aggregate management facilities. 

• Runoff from the TMF. 
 

The principal objectives of the water management plan for the Project will be: 

1. To minimize the volume of potentially impacted water generated from the site. 

2. To minimize the amount of water extracted from the English River for processing and 
general mine site use by maximizing the use of reclaimed runoff water plant site 

runoff, mine dewatering flows, through internal concentrator recycling and use of 

filtered Tailing storage. 

3. To the extent practical, direct all water that is impacted by processing operations to a 
single point in order to minimize the locations that require monitoring and treatment. 

 

20.15.1 Water Management Measures 
 

In general, the runoff management measures will include a series of low height berms, 

collection/diversion channels, collection basins and sumps. Runoff from the various 

catchment areas in and around the site will be managed as follows: 

• Topsoil/Overburden Stockpiles – Runoff will be directed to temporary perimeter 
ditches, and sediment and erosion control measures (i.e., silt fences, straw bales) will 

be incorporated into the ditches until vegetation is established.  

• Fine Aggregate Stockpile and Temporary Lepidolite Tailings Area – Runoff from this 
area will be directed to perimeter collection channels that will drain to a monitoring 

sump. Runoff reporting to the sump will be monitored periodically to ensure it is 

acceptable for discharge to the environment. 

• Coarse Mine Rock Aggregate Stockpiles – Runoff originating within each of these 
stockpiles will be directed to perimeter collection channels. These channels will drain 

to one of three sediment basins where the majority of sediment will be allowed to 

settle prior to the runoff being decanted out of the basin and discharged to the 

downstream environment. The exception to this is the southeastern portion of the west 

coarse rock aggregate stockpile, which will have its runoff directed to the 

settling/event pond.  

• Plant Site – Runoff originating within the plant site will be directed to a series of 
perimeter collection channels which will drain to the plant site water management 



 
 

 228 

pond. Water from this basin will be pumped to the water treatment plant for treatment 

prior to discharge to the environment or for use in the concentrator.  

• TMF – Runoff originating within the TMF will be directed to the settling/event pond 
at the southwest end of the facility. The majority of sediment will be allowed to settle 

out of the runoff before the runoff is decanted out of the basin and discharged to the 

downstream environment. Runoff originating from the downstream embankment 

slopes of the TMF will report to collection channels that drain to small monitoring 

sumps. Runoff reporting to the sumps will be monitored periodically to ensure it is 

acceptable for discharge to the environment. 

 

Low height berms will be constructed adjacent to the collection channels to help direct 

disturbed areas runoff to the channels and sediment basins, and also to help divert 

undisturbed areas runoff from upstream areas away from the sediment basins. Diversion 

berms will also be constructed on the west and south sides of the open pit to divert runoff 

away from the pit. The locations and schematic of the proposed water management measures 

are shown in Figure 20.4. A simple water balance was prepared to provide estimates of the 

volumes of runoff reporting to each pond/basin on the site (see Figure 20.5).  

 

The water balance was prepared for one year of operations, based on average annual 

precipitation conditions. The total annual precipitation value was 715 mm, which includes 

rainfall and snowfall water equivalent. Figure 20.5 shows that there will be a surplus of water 

from the Project. 

 

The natural downstream receiver from the settling/event pond is Storm Bay. However, due to 

its relatively shallow depth and flow rate and the limited potential for mixing and 

assimilation of the flows, if required, the potential exists to discharge the water from the 

settling/event pond through a submerged pipe, with an end diffuser, into the main channel of 

the English River. Notwithstanding this, some infrequent flows which result from excessive 

snowmelt and precipitation events may be released directly to Storm Bay through engineered 

overflow spillways.  

 

Water management at the hydrometallurgical plant site is planned to be discharged to the 

Kenora sewage treatment system where there is significant capacity for the small volumes 

expected.

20.16 CLOSURE AND REHABILITATION 
 

The Ontario Mining Act requires that, upon cessation of operations, mining lands are to be 

restored to their former use or condition or are to be made suitable for a use approved by the 

Director of the Ministry of Northern Development and Mines. The primary objectives of 

mine decommissioning are to ensure that public safety and security are not compromised and 

that any environmental impacts are reduced to an acceptable level or eliminated. An 

additional objective is to rehabilitate any disturbed areas and integrate them into the naturally 

surrounding landscape.  

 

For mines located on previously undisturbed sites, ecological restoration is a fundamental 

component of site reclamation. The main aspects of the closure and reclamation plans for the 

Project are described in the following paragraphs. 

 

Following the cessation of mining, the open pit will be allowed to flood. Flooding will occur 

primarily through inflows of groundwater and surface water runoff. It is currently unknown if 

the pit will become completely filled with water, however if this occurs, excess water will be 

discharged through a high-level overflow channel into the English River after demonstration 

that the water is of good quality. Given that the mineralized material and pit wall rock is 

expected to be inert, an alternative being considered is to generate a direct link to the river to 

facilitate the development of aquatic and fisheries habitat in the pit. A barrier, consisting of 

boulders, will be placed around the perimeter of the open pit at closure to prevent access.  

Signs warning of the open pit will also be erected.    

 

The TMF will be closed and rehabilitated in a safe and secure manner in full accordance with 

government regulations and good engineering practice. Testwork done to date indicates that 

the tailings and concentrate will be non-acid generating, and as such acid mitigation 

measures are not expected to be necessary for closure. (Knight Piésold, 2016b). This will be 

fully confirmed by testwork in subsequent stages of the Project planning. As a precaution, the 

concentrate storage facilities are also planned to be rehabilitated at the end of the mine life. 

Once sufficient tailings are available, reclamation testing will be completed in order to 

demonstrate that direct seeding is feasible for vegetation of the TMF. 

 

In the absence of an identified beneficial reuse such as wild rice production, following 

closure, the TMF will be a reclaimed landform that sheds runoff. Some ditching may be 

required, but no water ponds or spillways will be necessary. The tailings and any remaining 

concentrate will be vegetated with local species.   

 

Progressive rehabilitation of benches of the coarse rock aggregate storage areas is planned to 

minimize the potential for aesthetic visual concerns during operations, particularly on the 

river view sides. Benches and the top of the first aggregate storage area will be progressively 

covered with a layer of seedbed material and revegetated when completed, assuming the 

aggregate is not being utilized for other purposes. The seedbed material will be obtained 

from the topsoil stockpile which will be developed from stripping various areas prior to 

mining. It is expected that some areas of the mine rock aggregate management area will be 



 
 

 232 

filled to capacity before operations are completed. As part of a progressive decommissioning 

plan, vegetation test plots will be established on the completed management area to 

determine the optimum revegetation procedure. Once this is determined, the completed 

portions of both aggregate facilities will be reclaimed progressively during the life of the 

mine. The top of the second aggregate storage area will be revegetated following mine 

closure, assuming no markets or alternate use for this material have been identified. 

 

All sediment basins associated with the TMF and the mine rock aggregate stockpiles will be 

breached and revegetated as necessary for closure.   

 

All machinery and equipment from the crusher, process plant and other ancillary facilities 

will be removed for reuse, salvage or disposal, and all buildings and infrastructure will be 

removed or demolished. Every practical effort will be made to maximize the salvage or 

recycling of the materials. Inert demolition materials that cannot be salvaged will be broken 

up and used to fill any below-grade openings. All chemicals or hazardous materials will be 

returned to the supplier or removed to an appropriate waste disposal facility by a licensed 

contractor. Petroleum storage tanks will be removed in accordance with applicable 

regulations. General waste materials will be disposed of in an offsite licensed site landfill.  

 

The mine access road will be maintained to provide access during the closure and post-

closure monitoring period. Following completion of post-closure monitoring, the road will be 

scarified and re-vegetated, and culverts removed. All other mine roads and disturbed areas 

will be scarified and revegetated. In the event that ongoing engagement on the Project and 

closure plan identifies an alternate user (e.g., a forestry company) that wishes to maintain and 

take responsibility for all or parts of the road, this option can be utilized, in consultation with 

applicable regulators. 

 

A 5-year post-closure monitoring program will follow closure of the mine that includes 

maintenance of the revegetated areas. The monitoring program will include assessment of the 

physical stability of the aggregate storage facilities, and TMF, surface water and groundwater 

quality, and periodic biological monitoring of the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the 

immediate vicinity of the site. The monitoring program will continue, as required, until the 

target objectives of the site closure have been achieved and approved by the MNDM. 

 

20.17 COMMUNITY AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ENGAGEMENT 
 

Consultation with local First Nations Bands and the public was initiated during the 1999 

baseline study. This continued in a reduced manner during the period of inactivity but was 

again ramped up in 2013. A memorandum of understanding initially signed with the 

Wabaseemoong Independent Nation (WIN) in 1999 was renewed in 2013. This agreement 

commits Avalon to maximize opportunities for WIN and to facilitate business partnerships. 

To this end, Avalon has utilized Indigenous personnel and companies to the extent practical 

during work completed to date. 

 



 
 

 233 

Avalon has also reached out to the Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO) in an effort to engage 

with them. While a formal engagement meeting with their full area engagement committee 

has not yet occurred, relationships with the MNO remain positive. 

 

In discussions with the MNDM, no additional First Nations are required to be engaged with 

regarding the exploration permits. This is due in part to the Isslington Agreement that was 

signed between the Province of Ontario and the WIN. This agreement was developed 

following the relocation of many community members due to the flooding of the English 

River associated with hydroelectric dam construction. This agreement gives the WIN 

exclusive control over the area that includes the Avalon site. The Métis rights have recently 

been granted to a wide area of the north and overlap the Isslington Agreement.   

 

Avalon has also held preliminary discussions with the Dalles and Grassy Narrows First 

Nations, though it is understood that the WIN has primary responsibility for natural resources 

development in the Project area. 

 

Avalon maintains an engagement log which records the numerous meetings held and 

summaries of the meeting content, and reports this annually in its Sustainability Report. 

 

An archaeological study was completed in 1998 (Adams, 1998). This will be reviewed with 

the communities of interest and updated, if required. There may be a requirement to complete 

additional traditional knowledge studies in the next phase of Project development. A 

socioeconomic assessment of the Project is included in the 2007 environmental study. This 

will be updated in the next phase of the Project.  

 

It is also noted that the Kenora 2012-2017 Forest Management Plan identified sites of High 

Potential Cultural Heritage. While the plan does not have the authority to enforce its 

requirements on mining and mining has different approval processes, these sites were a 

concern. In these plans, cultural heritage sites are identified based on a computer-generated 

algorithm and are not based or substantiated by site visits. Heritage sites may be added or 

removed by site investigations by qualified archeologists or by extensive study and artifact 

recovery in consultation with Indigenous Peoples. This plan was prepared without the benefit 

of the Avalon archeological study. While efforts have been made to avoid these theoretical 

sites, there is a small unavoidable area of overlap in the proposed pit outline and part of a 

potential heritage area along the English River. The Avalon archaeological study did not 

identify this area as a heritage site. Avalon is in the process of providing this information to 

those responsible, and who are presently updating this information for the next 5-year Forest 

Management Plan, in order to have this area removed as an area of potential cultural heritage. 

In the highly unlikely event that this area remains a concern, Avalon is prepared to initiate a 

detailed study and if necessary, artifact recovery of this area, in consultation with appropriate 

Aboriginal groups. 

 

Avalon has a full time representative in Kenora who facilitates ongoing engagement with 

Indigenous Peoples, communities, regulators and politicians that contributes to the strong 

support for the Project. 



 
 

 234 

20.18 OPPORTUNITIES 
 

There are a number of trade-off studies proposed that have both environmental and economic 

upside potential. These include the following: 

1. Given that a significant portion of the ore is not recovered with the existing open pit 
design, a pit optimization study may improve this. In addition, a trade-off study to 

look at underground mining could also improve the sustainable recovery of the ore, 

while reducing the quantity of waste rock produced and reducing the energy and 

environmental footprint of the Project. This would include an analysis of 

electrification of the underground mine vs conventional mining to further reduce 

energy consumption and Green House Gas production. 

2. Given that the original and existing TMF location have both been identified a fish 
habitat, a trade off study of both locations based on the present business model may 

result in significant cost savings and lower risk structures.   

3. The present arrangement has the magnetics, feldspar concentrate, slimes and Petalite 
tailing stored in separate cells within the TMF. This creates additional capital and 

operating costs associated with additional tailing embankments. A study to evaluate 

potential cost benefits of fully combing two or more of these materials will be 

completed in the next Project phase. 

4. The most significant opportunity is considered to be the potential future development 
of a lithium hydroxide demonstration plant followed by the construction of a full-

scale lithium hydroxide plant to take advantage of the fastest growing segment of the 

lithium market: lithium chemicals for batteries for the electric vehicles industry. 

These potential facilities are not part of this PEA.

21.0 CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS 
 

21.1 CAPITAL COSTS 
 

The basis for the PEA capital cost estimate is a processing facility and related infrastructure 

with a nominal throughput rate of 475,000 t/y of mineralized material, comprising either 

petalite mineralized material (PZ) or lepidolite mineralized material (LPZ).  

 

Foreign exchange rates used as a basis for the estimate are: 

  USD1 = CAD1.30.  

Euro 1= CAD1.46. 

 

The capex for the open-pit mine is assumed to be zero as the operation will engage a contract 

miner and all mining capex will be built into the contract mining operating costs. 

 

The crusher plant has been sized at double the capacity of the concentrator to facilitate a 

single 12-hour shift for crushing. 

 

The Project is at a green fields location and so will require construction of new tailings and 

waste rock storage facilities as well as an up-grade to an existing access road and the 

installation of an electrical power supply line. 

 

Initial capex requirements are summarized in Table 21.1 with a more detailed breakdown 

presented in Table 21.2. All costs are reported as Canadian Dollars (CAD). It should be noted 

that, apart from the feldspar flotation plant in Years 5 and 6, provisions for what might 

normally be designated as "sustaining capital" are included in the operating costs.

The concept of having most of the plant pre-assembled off-site and delivered in modules 

(fully or partly assembled) has been assumed for much of the equipment (particularly the 

flotation plant) and facilities in order to reduce on-site construction activities. 

 

21.1.1 Mining 
 

21.1.1.1 Contract Mining 
 

A budget cost of $4.5/t for the mining of mineralization and waste from the open pit was 

received by Avalon from a local mining contractor. A provision of an additional $1/t for 

transportation of waste rock to the waste rock dumps is also included in the mining costs.  

 

21.1.2 Concentrator Direct Costs 
 

Based on the results of the various testwork programs and process flowsheets, mass balances 

were generated together with a detailed equipment list, and process design criteria. From this 

information, preliminary equipment duties have been determined and budget prices received 

from qualified vendors. For some of the smaller items, Avalon has used costs from other 

studies with a similar size or type of equipment. 

 

The pricing of the crushing plant is based on a modular type facility as used in many quarry-

type operations. 

 

Site and plant maintenance costs and a provision for site closure are included in operating 

expenses so no sustaining capital is indicated. There is however a provision of $7.5M for site 

closure in Year 20. 

 

Factors for each area of the processing facility were applied to estimate the associated direct 

and indirect costs for civil and earthworks, concrete, structural steel, plate-work, piping and 

electrical/instrumentation. These factors are based on in-house expertise and other similar 

sized projects. 

 

There will be only one mill and flotation circuit initially with the processing of the 2 ore 

types being conducted in campaigns rather than simultaneously. There will be a number of 

other shared equipment items although there will be separate reagent mixing and dosing 

facilities provided for both ore types.

21.1.3 Concentrator Indirect Costs 
 

The EPCM cost is estimated at only 7.5% of direct costs as a result of the following: 

• Crusher plant being a pre-engineered modular/mobile facility. 

• The flotation plant will be a pre-engineered facility of modular construction pre-
assembled off site. 

• Many other facilities (such as reagent mixing/storage/dosing) will also be pre-
assembled on skids or modular structure; hence much of the engineering and 

installation costs will be borne by the vendors. 

• Avalon will have a small team on site to manage construction so minimal input from 
the EPCM engineer will be required during the construction period. 

• Electrical design will be completed by the equipment supply vendor. 

• The process modules will be installed in a building that will be a pre-engineered and 
fabricated steel structure with cladding. 

 

Other Indirect costs have been conservatively estimated by either factoring from the Total 

Direct costs or as lump sum values. 

 

21.1.4 Feldspar Flotation Circuit 
 

In Years 5 to 6 a feldspar flotation plant will be installed at an estimated cost of CAD13.7M 

(Table 21.1 above). These capital costs have been estimated using the same philosophy and 

methodology as applied to the main plant. 

 

This facility will include rougher and a two-stage cleaner flotation circuit, reagent mixing 

and dosing equipment, blowers, and product filters. There will be a drier for the final 

concentrate as well as a fine-grinding mill to grind some of the feldspar concentrate (up to 

6,000 t/y) to P80 of ~6 microns for sale into the filler industry 

 

21.1.5 Tailings 
 

The operation will employ dry tailings stacking methodology with final flotation tailings 

being filtered and then transported by truck to designated tailings storage areas.  

 

Flotation tailings from processing of the lepidolite material will be deposited into a 

temporary storage area as it will be re-processed for petalite recovery when the plant is 

treating petalite ore. 

 

21.1.6 Infrastructure 
 

There is currently no power available at site although there is sufficient capacity available 

nearby from the main transmission line running south from Caribou Falls to Whitedog Falls. 



 
 

 239 

The capital cost estimate includes a sum of $4M to connect into this line and install a power 

supply cable to the mine. 

 

There is already an access road to the mine, but this will need some up-grading to 

accommodate the increased traffic from deliveries and product shipment. These up-grades 

are estimated to cost $750,000. 

 

Other site infrastructure includes the main process plant building which will also house stores 

and workshop areas. A second building will house the offices and ablution facilities. 

 

Process plant infrastructure provisions in the capex estimate include compressed air, clean, 

process, gland service and tailings return water circuits for the processing plant. 

 

21.1.7 Owners Costs  
 

A provision of CAD2 million is included for Owners Costs (see Table 21.3). 

 
Table 21.3  

Breakdown of Owners Costs Provision 

 

Expense Cost CAD 

Training – Operation/Maintenance Labour 400,000 

Site Construction Management 1,000,000 

H/Office Support – Expenses 150,000 

Permitting 100,000 

Recruitment 100,000 

Miscellaneous Disbursements 250,000 

Total 2,000,000 

 

• The training provision allows for 2 months for all personnel prior to commissioning 
(the potential for some government funding for this activity is being investigated). 

• Site construction management provides for one site manager, 3 site supervisors, 2 
engineers and a clerk for a total of 18 months. 

• Home office support expenses provides for travel and food during site visits by head 
office. 

• Permitting – permits for final construction and operations.  

• There will be a number of expenses associated with the recruitment of operating 
personnel and miscellaneous activities both at site and at head office. 

 

21.1.8 Contingency 
 

A contingency of 20% has been added to the capital cost estimate. This is considered 

acceptable on the basis that significant detail has already gone into the process design and 

equipment sizing. In addition, there is potential for equipment savings through the 

procurement of second-hand equipment particularly for the mill and crusher plant.  



 
 

 240 

 

21.2 OPERATING COSTS 
 

Operating costs have been determined by Avalon and reviewed by Micon and are expressed 

in Canadian Dollars based on: 

• Total tonnes mined as determined by the mining schedule, and typical industry rates. 

• Anticipated labour complements and appropriate labour rates and burdens. 

• Energy estimates calculated from electrical equipment loads and current tariffs. 

• Estimates for miscellaneous minor operating expenses. 

• Reagent dosages from testwork programs and budget supply costs. 
 

A summary of the LOM average annual costs is presented in Table 21.4. Table 21.5 presents 

the life-of-mine production schedule.

21.2.1 Mining 
 

21.2.1.1 Contract Mining 
 

The PEA base case includes contract mining rather than Owner mining. The LOM average 

estimated unit costs for this case equates to $39.98/t of mineralized material processed or 

$5.52/t of material mined. 

 

A budget cost of $4.5/t for the mining of mineralization and waste from the open pit was 

received by Avalon from a local mining contractor. A provision of an additional $1/t for 

transportation of the waste rock to the waste rock dumps is also included in the mining costs. 

21.2.2 Lepidolite Tailings Reclaim 
 

For the reclamation of the lepidolite tailings from the temporary storage area an assumed cost 

of $5/t has been used (this also covers the cost of transporting the lepidolite tailings from the 

plant to the temporary storage area).

21.2.3 Concentrator 
 

21.2.3.1 Power 
 

Power costs have been determined based on the installed mechanical equipment load. It is 

assumed all operating drives draw 80% of their installed power except for certain intermittent 

operating equipment items such as filter circuits, samplers, spillage pumps and stand-by 

equipment. An average power cost of CAD0.1108/kWh has been used based on current rates 

from the local power supplier.  

 

21.2.3.2 Reagents and Consumables 
 

Reagent costs are a significant portion (18%) of the processing costs for the recovery of 

petalite (most notably HF, NaCl and KCl). They are also a source of potential environmental 

issues if released to the environment. As a consequence, significant effort is placed in 

capturing and recycling as much of these reagents as possible either through internal process 

recirculation or via a water treatment facility.  

 

Through these measures it is believed possible to recover as much as 90% of the chlorides 

and 10% of the HF with the balances captured as solids from the water treatment plant. These 

solids will then be placed in a dedicated, purpose-designed permanent storage facility.  

 

Annual reagent costs average approximately CAD10.4 million for the petalite/lepidolite 

circuit. As well as flotation reagents this also includes flocculent for dewatering of the 

various products. 

 

There are 2 product driers installed- one for petalite/lepidolite and a second for the feldspar. 

Both of these require liquid gas which will be delivered to site by truck. 

 

Besides the flotation reagents, other consumables include grinding media (calculated 

assuming 1.2 kg/t), mill liners (1 complete set per annum) and crusher liners. 

 

21.2.3.3 Labour 
 

Labour requirements for operating the petalite/lepidolite processing plant are estimated at 49 

personnel as indicated in Table 21.6 for a total annual operating cost of CAD3.77 million. In 

addition, there are a further 10 personnel employed full time at the mine under the category 

of General and Administration plus Head Office personnel on a part-time basis for activities 

such as procurement, accounting, human resources and technical support in areas such as 

metallurgy, environmental, geology and marketing. Annual cost for these roles' totals 

CAD0.882 million. 

 

The feldspar plant once operating will engage a further 11 personnel at an annual cost of 

CAD0.77 million. 

 



 
 

 243 

The "day-shift" operators will oversee on-site environmental monitoring, basic training, on-

site safety, product packing and dispatch, etc. under the supervision of the operations 

manager.

21.2.3.4 Maintenance 
 

Annual maintenance supply costs have been estimated using 3% of the installed mechanical 

equipment costs per annum. This will be predominantly for pump spares and wear 

components in the flotation cells. 

 

21.2.3.5 Environmental & Tailings 
 

There is a CAD500,000/y allowance for monitoring and effecting repairs and maintenance to 

the tailings area and overall site water management as well as on-going analyses of various 

environmental samples. 

 

A CAD7.5 million provision is included to cover final closure costs- remediation of tailings, 

open pit and plant site. The plant building will be specifically designed for easy removal and 

potential sale or relocation.  

 

A cost of $3/t is included for transporting and depositing the filtered tailings (including 

slimes and magnetics) into the tailings storage areas. 

 

21.2.3.6 Transportation of Concentrates 
 

A cost of USD150/t (CAD195/t) of dry concentrate produced is assumed (based on budget 

quotations) for petalite concentrate transport to customers (based predominantly in Europe). 

It is anticipated that the lepidolite and feldspar concentrates will be sold to customers either 

in Ontario or the northern parts of the USA and so a transport cost provision of CAD50/t is 

included. 

 

21.2.4 General and Administration 
 

There will be 11 fulltime employees and one part time employee (Table 21.5 above) at an 

annual cost of approximately CAD882,000 All other costs included are annual estimates for 

corporate expenses (CAD150,000/y), equipment rental (site vehicles etc. @CAD300,000/y), 

other fixed costs (CAD200,000/y) and "Miscellaneous" (CAD250,000/y).

22.0 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
 

Micon has prepared this assessment of the Project on the basis of a discounted cash flow 

model, from which Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), payback and 

other measures of project viability can be determined. Assessments of NPV are generally 

accepted within the mining industry as representing the economic value of a project after 

allowing for the cost of capital invested. 

 

The objective of the study was to determine the potential viability of the proposed 

development of the Separation Rapids Lithium Minerals Production Project. In order to do 

this, the cash flow arising from the base case has been forecast, enabling a computation of the 

NPV to be made. The sensitivity of this NPV to changes in the base case assumptions is then 

examined. 

 

22.1 MACRO-ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS 
 

22.1.1 Exchange Rate, Inflation and Discount Rate 
 

The prices used for the petalite, lepidolite and feldspar concentrates are based on a US dollar 

(USD) rate, but unless otherwise stated, financial results are expressed in Canadian dollars 

(CAD). Cost estimates and other inputs to the cash flow model for the Project have been 

prepared using constant, second quarter 2018 money terms, i.e., without provision for 

escalation or inflation.   

 

An exchange rate of CAD1.30/USD is applied in the base case, approximately equal to 

current rates and to the trailing average over the past two years. 

 

Micon has applied a real discount rate of 8% in its base case evaluation, approximating the 

weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Project.  

 

22.1.2 Expected Metal Prices 
 

The base case cash flow projection assumes constant prices for all 3 concentrates. These 

prices are based on discussions held between Avalon and potential customers while 

negotiating off-take agreements, or, in the case of the feldspar, current market prices.  

 

22.1.3 Taxation Regime 
 

Ontario mining taxes and Canadian federal and provincial income taxes payable on the 

Project have been provided for in the cash flow forecast. Mining tax is charged at 10% of net 

income, after deductions for depreciation and a processing allowance. Depreciation is 

deductible on a straight-line basis at 30% on mining assets and 15% on processing assets. 

The processing allowance is set at 8% of processing capital (subject to the allowance falling 

between minimum and maximum percentages of profit of 15% and 65% respectively). 

 



 
 

 246 

Provincial and federal income tax rates are 10% and 15%, respectively. Depreciation 

allowances for income tax are limited to 25% on a declining balance basis, with none of the 

Project's initial capital assumed to be eligible for an accelerated allowance that may only be 

claimed during the transition period ending in 2020. 

 

22.1.4 Royalty 
 

No royalty has been provided for in the cash flow model.  

 

22.1.5 Selling Expenses 
 

A provision for petalite concentrate transport from Separation Rapids to customer of 

USD150/t (CAD195/t) is included within forecast cash operating costs. Transport rates for 

lepidolite and feldspar are much lower (CAD50/t) as they will be sold into local markets. 

 

22.2 TECHNICAL ASSUMPTIONS 
 

The technical parameters, production forecasts and estimates described elsewhere in this 

report are reflected in the base case cash flow model. These inputs to the model are 

summarized below. The measures used in the study are metric throughout.

22.3 COSTS 
 

22.3.1 Operating Costs 
 

Cash costs over the Life-of-Mine (LOM) average CAD122.77/t milled (Tables 21.4) for 

production of petalite and lepidolite, equivalent to USD516/t concentrate sold. In addition, 

operating costs of CAD87.7/t treated (petalite flotation tails) are estimated for feldspar 

production, equating to USD83/t feldspar concentrate sold. These costs are inclusive of 

product transportation, maintenance and management of the tailings storage facilities.  

 

22.3.2 Capital Costs 
 

Pre-production capital expenditures are estimated to total CAD77.7 M which includes 

CAD42.7 M in processing plant direct costs, CAD10.3 M infrastructure, CAD9.7 M indirect 

costs, CAD2.00 M for Owners Costs and a contingency of CAD12.5 M. There is a further 

requirement of CAD10 M for working capital in Year 1. 

 

The feldspar flotation plant is estimated to cost CAD13.74 M in Years 5-6, which includes 

CAD8.45 M plant directs, CAD2.37 M indirects, CAD0.25 M for extensions to the plant 

building, CAD0.50 M Owners cost and a CAD2.16 M contingency. 

 

No sustaining capital is forecast, since all maintenance requirements are included in the 

Operating Cost estimate. Provision is made for CAD7.5 M in site remediation in Year 20. 

 

22.3.3 Base Case Cash Flow 
 

Figure 22.4 presents a summary of the Project cash flow. Annual cash flows are presented in 

Table 22.1. 

 



 
 

 249 

Figure 22.4  

Net Annual Cash Flow (After Tax) 

 

 
 

This preliminary economic assessment is preliminary in nature; it includes inferred mineral 

resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic 

considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, 

and there is no certainty that the preliminary economic assessment will be realized. 

 

Before tax, the base case demonstrates an undiscounted payback period of less than 3.5 years 

and an IRR of 27.1%. At an annual discount rate of 8%, the Project has a net present value 

(NPV8) before tax of CAD156 M. 

 

After tax, the base case undiscounted payback period is just under 4.5 years, leaving a tail of 

15 years planned production, and the Project has an IRR of 22.7%. At an annual discount rate 

of 8%, the Project NPV8 after tax is CAD102 M.

The sensitivity of post-tax project returns to changes in capital, operating costs and all 

revenue factors (including recovery and concentrate price) was tested over a range of 20% 

above and below base case values (see Figure 22.5 and Figure 22.6).

The charts suggest that the Project is most sensitive to revenue drivers, namely price and 

recovery which are essentially identical. At a discount rate of 8%, the project NPV is 

negative when all product prices are reduced by 20%. The Project is also quite sensitive to 

changes in operating cost while sensitivity to capex is relatively low. Project NPV remains 

positive for adverse changes of up to 20% in either capital or operating costs. 

 

22.5 CONCLUSION 
 

Micon concludes that the Project is potentially economic under the base case assumptions for 

product price, process recoveries, capital and operating costs, and appears sufficiently robust 

to withstand adverse changes in cost assumptions of more than 20%.  

 

The proposed project format presents an opportunity to viably produce lithium mineral and 

feldspar concentrates for both the ceramics and lithium chemical industries. The prices 

currently being negotiated with potential customers present strong project economic returns 

with an after-tax IRR of 22.7% and an NPV of CAD102 M. The capital required is 

CAD77.7 M with a further requirement of CAD10 M for initial working capital.  

 

The Project currently has a petalite/lepidolite production life of 18.5 years although plant 

operations have been expanded in this study to 20 years through the continued production of 

feldspar from stockpiled petalite tailings. There will be sufficient petalite tailings to continue 

feldspar production for several decades further at the planned production rate of 100,000 t/y 

but this is not taken into consideration in this study. 

 

There is also the potential for a longer petalite/lepidolite production life as the current ore 

body remains open at depth and along strike and areas of other mineralization outcrops have 

been identified. At some point it may also become viable to start underground mining for the 

known deeper mineralization. Further, if sufficient additional mineralization is identified it is 

quite possible that the production capacity of the initial plant could be expanded relatively 

cheaply and quickly. 

 

There are other by-product opportunities as well which have not been evaluated in this 

report. These include recovery of lithium, niobium and tantalum from the waste magnetics 

stream and the very low impurity silica material from the petalite mineralization tailings after 

petalite and feldspar removal.

23.0 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
 

23.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

Although the SRLD is described by Breaks in numerous publications as the largest rare metal 

pegmatite of the petalite sub-type discovered in Ontario, there are a large number of other 

rare metal pegmatite occurrences within a few kilometres of the Separation Rapids property. 

As noted by Breaks and Tindle, 1998, "most rare metal mineralization occurs within 5 km of 

the Separation Rapids Pluton, the postulated parent granite for two distinct clusters of 

pegmatites". These have been designated by Breaks and Tindle, 1998, as the Eastern 

Pegmatite Subgroup and the Southwestern Pegmatite Subgroup (see Figure 23.1). 

 

The principal occurrences are the Big Mack Pegmatite, the Southwestern Pegmatite 

Subgroup which includes the SRLD, Great White North and the Swamp pegmatites, and the 

Eastern Pegmatite Subgroup which includes Marko's Pegmatite, Lou's Pegmatite and others 

as described in Breaks and Tindle, 1998. The grouping references as given by Breaks and 

Tindle, 2001, are used in the text below, with the exception of the Western Pegmatites. This 

group is added here since the individual mineralized bodies were not clearly discussed in 

various publications by Breaks. Most of these were mapped and sampled during the period 

1996-2002 and have received little or no attention since.

 255 

 

23.2 BIG MACK PEGMATITE 
 

The Big Mack Pegmatite is about 2 km west of the SRLD system. The system has been 

described in the report by Breaks et al. (1999), for the Ontario government and Chastko 

(2001) as an NI 43-101 technical report. The occurrence is located on mining lease CLM 428 

held by Pacific Iron Ore Corporation (formerly Emerald Fields Resource Corporation). This 

lease has an expiry date of 28 February, 2021. The information was obtained from the 

Ontario government online claim database as of 5 August, 2016 

(www.mci.mndm.gov.on.ca/claims).  

 

According to Breaks et al. (1999) the Big Mack Pegmatite system contains four known 

petalite occurrences on one set of claims and a fifth occurrence (referred to briefly as the 

Glitter Pegmatite). Locally, there are additional occurrences of rare-element mineralization 

consisting of numerous oxide mineral-bearing pegmatites and aplite dykes. 

 

The Big Mack Pegmatite and the SRLD are thought to be "early pegmatites" and are 

complexly folded. The pegmatite has been stripped over its entire surface area and has been 

tested by three short narrow diameter Winkie drill holes and nine BQ sized drill holes for a 

total of 1,261 m. The surface expression of the Big Mack Pegmatite measures 30 by 150 m. 

The petalite content is stated by Chastko, 2001, to average 30.5%. The pegmatite is mainly 

confined to the nose area of a tight to isoclinal, macroscopic fold (Breaks et al., 1999). 

Boudinage of pegmatite dykes is widely noted on a mesoscopic scale throughout the entire 

Big Mack Pegmatite system. This subsequent structural event likely applies on a 

macroscopic scale to the Big Mack Pegmatite, as this mass exhibits a plan view suggestive of 

boudinage. 

 

The Big Mack Pegmatite represents the largest petalite-bearing mass on CLM 428 and is 

exposed over an 80 by 225 m area (Breaks et al., 1999). The pegmatite comprises a 30 by 

100 m main mass coupled with several prominent, narrow apophyses that taper towards the 

south and southeast. These apophyses consist of non-petalite-bearing sodic pegmatites and 

similar units. The Big Mack Pegmatite exhibits an internal zonation expressed by a 

continuous wall zone, 0.5 to 3 m thick, that grades into a main core mass of petalite-rich 

pegmatite. Petalite-rich pegmatite comprises most of the body and contains areas up to 56 to 

60% light brown weathering petalite. Chrysoberyl-bearing petalite pegmatite is confined to a 

2 to 6 by 25 m unit that is exposed within a trench.  

 

Diamond drill holes established the continuity of the Big Mack Pegmatite zone to at least 50 

m below surface. However, holes below this level encounter petalite-free pegmatite that may 

or may not correlate with the petalite-bearing zone of the Big Mack Pegmatite. It is the 

opinion of Pedersen, 2016, based on logging the holes, that the petalite-free lower pegmatite 

is a barren continuation of the upper petalite-bearing pegmatite, and it is simply the 

termination through boudinage of the pegmatite. The Big Mack Pegmatite zone is speculated 

to extend down plunge to the west at a moderate angle (Chastko, 2001).

 256 

Chastko (2001) reports a mineral resource estimate of 275,700 t with an estimated content of 

30.5% petalite at an SG of 2.6).  

23.3 EASTERN PEGMATITE SUBGROUP 
 

23.3.1 Marko's Pegmatite 
 

Marko's Pegmatite was explored by Champion Bear Resources Ltd. (Champion Bear) and 

described by Breaks and Tindle, 2001, who noted that it is the largest petalite-bearing 

pegmatite in the Eastern Pegmatitite Subgroup. They emphasize the strong zoning with the 

Marko's Pegmatite noting that the wall zone is pollucite-bearing, unique to the area, but has 

no petalite, while the core zone contains strong petalite enrichment. It is about 5 km east of 

the SRLD system. 

 

The ground immediately east and west of Marko's Pegmatite is now optioned by Power 

Metals Corp from Exiro Resources. Power Metals refers to the area as the Paterson Lake 

Property.  

 

In a report prepared for Champion Bear, Hinzer, 2003, stated that: 

"Detailed surface sampling and initial diamond drilling has identified anomalous 

lithium, tantalum, rubidium, cesium, tin and beryllium values at the Marco's [sic] 

pegmatite.  

"Early exploration at the main Marcos zone showed the 170 m long pegmatite to 

be made up of two to 12 m wide boudinaged lens, dipping steeply to the south and 

with a shallow plunge to the west. Petalite was encountered both on surface and 

in drilling over width of up to 5.3 m. The parallel, north Marcos pegmatite, a 10 

to 30 m wide pegmatite dyke, unmineralized at surface, also contains several 

petalite lenses of similar dimensions. The north Marcos dyke at depth appears to 

be of larger dimension than the main Marcos dyke.  

"Diamond drilling shows an apparent flattening to approximately 20° of the 

pegmatite down dip and to the east. The pegmatite is zoned with two petalite 

horizons and two oxide-bearing zones."  

 

Early exploration reported by Hinzer, 2003, encountered 0.1 to 0.2% Li over up to 5.3 m in 

surface samples. Hinzer also, at an uncertain date, but possibly in 1977, reported higher 

grades from previous drilling including drill holes: 

• SR-11 1.48% LiO over 3.5 m. 

• SR-13 3.76% LiO over 4 m and 3.9% LiO over 1.5 m. 

• SR-16 1.89% LiO over 3.9 m. 

• SR-17 1.02% LiO over 7.9 m. 

• SR-20 1.09% LiO over 1.5 m, 1.05% LiO over 2.1 m and 1.11% LiO over 2.8 m. 
 



 
 

 257 

It should be noted that Hinzer quotes lithium values consistently as LiO, as opposed to the 

conventional Li2O, and it is not known whether this is a typographical or conversion error. 

Holes not listed did not have significant lithium values greater than 1% LiO. The 2002 

program added four more drill holes, none of which indicated greater than 1% lithium 

intercepts. 

23.3.2 Lou's Pegmatite and Other Pegmatites 
 

The Ontario Mineral Deposit Inventory (www.geologyontario.mndm.gov.on.ca, Mineral 

Deposits and Occurrences/Mineral Deposit Inventory (MDI)) notes that the minerals present 

at Lou's Pegmatite include "abundant" petalite, ferrocolumbite, ferrotantalite, wodginite, 

cassiterite and beryl. Alteration types observed include lithium metasomatism, biotitization 

and tourmalinization. 

 

Breaks and Tindle (2001), note that among the eight other known pegmatites within the 

Eastern Pegmatite Subgroup, most tend to display ductile shear fabrics that makes petalite 

difficult to recognise in hand specimen as their Pegmatites 10 and 11. They also state that 

Pegmatite 8 of the Eastern Pegmatite Subgroup has unique second generation petalite with 

deformation and recrystallization. 

 

There are notes on the Eastern Pegmatite Subgroup in Breaks and Tindle, (1998), on the 

Gossan Resources Ltd. (Gossan) property. According to this poster reference, the subgroup 

has preliminary indications of the highest potential for tantalum and rock grab values 

reportedly range from 0.07 to 0.22% TaO. Note that the publication refers to TaO and not 

Ta2O5 as the tantalum content. The reference also notes significant Li, Cs and Rb values. 

 

23.4 SOUTHWESTERN PEGMATITE SUBGROUP  
 

Breaks and Tindle, 2001, describe the Southwestern Pegmatite Subgroup of approximately 

30 beryl-type and complex-type pegmatites that occupy and area of 0.3 to 0.8 by 6.5 km 

adjacent to the southwestern part of the Separation Rapids Pluton. Within this subgroup they 

defined two zones that respectively contain beryl-type and complex-type (petalite subtype) 

pegmatites. Note that in Breaks and Tindle, 2001, the Southwestern Pegmatite Subgroup as 

published includes the SRLD and also extends immediately east of it. As a result, the Gossan 

property immediately east of the Avalon Mine Lease would also be included within the 

Southwestern Subgroup of Breaks and Tindle, 2001. 

 

The "Beryl zone" is said to consist of a profusion of narrow dykes of aplite and albitite up to 

3 m thick and larger dikes and ovoid masses, up to 250 by 300 m that are composed of 

pegmatitic leucogranite, subordinate potassic pegmatite and quartz-rich patches with blocky 

potassium feldspar and sparse green beryl. Despite the beryl in the name, Breaks and Tindle, 

2001, state that beryl, chrysoberyl, gahnite and ferrowodginite are rare. They state that the 

"Petalite zone" has nine relatively large, deformed pegmatite lenses, and incorporates, as the 

largest, the SRLD pegmatite. A swarm of much smaller petalite pegmatites accompanies the 

larger lenses. The majority of petalite pegmatites, regardless of size, display an internal 

http://www.geologyontario.mndm.gov.on.ca/


 
 

 258 

zonation. This zonation comprises a relatively narrow wall, zone rich in plagioclase and a 

core unit of muscovite-quartz-potassium feldspar-petalite. 

 

The SRLD system continues to the east from the main outcrop, also with narrow petalite 

bearing pegmatite dykes on ground owned currently by Gossan Resources.

25.0 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
 

25.1 INTRODUCTION 
 

The PEA suggests that the Separation Rapids Project can be developed as an economically 

viable supplier of the lithium minerals petalite and lepidolite into the ceramics and lithium 

chemical industries for almost 20 years. Production of a third, feldspar concentrate further 

enhances the Project economics by supplying product into various industrial mineral markets. 

 

The initial capital estimate for the Project is CAD77.7 million with a further CAD10 million 

required for initial working capital. The addition of the feldspar recovery circuit in Years 5/6 

(or potentially sooner if funding is available) requires an additional CAD13.7 million. 

 

Capital costs have been reduced by treating the 2 different types of lithium mineralization on 

a campaign basis rather than having 2 parallel processing plants. 

 

The Project is relatively small and low in capex for a mining Project, but the economic 

performance estimated by this report indicates a post-tax IRR of 22.7% and an NPV of 

CAD102 million. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the Project is most sensitive to revenue 

drivers, namely price and recovery (identical), and also quite sensitive to changes in 

operating cost while sensitivity to capex is relatively low.  

 

The Project will provide over 70 full time employment opportunities, as well as a number of 

additional opportunities for local industries to grow through the provision of support 

services. 

 

Consideration has been given in the design to the number and nature of the chemicals used in 

the flotation process and how best to minimise their consumption through recovery and 

recycling, as well as via water treatment to remove dissolved metals. 

 

The site layout takes into account the various waste streams produced by the processes with 

all being relatively inert and free from toxic materials and sulphides. Flotation tailings are 

filtered and washed before being dry-stacked so as not to present a source of future ground 

and run-off water contamination. 

 

25.2 RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES 
 

The risks and opportunities of the Project in its current format are discussed below. 

 

25.2.1 Control of Plant Feed Composition 
 

The processing of lepidolite mineralization requires significantly different flotation 

conditions and reagents to that of petalite and so it is key that the two types of material are 

processed separately otherwise there will be a loss in concentrate recovery. This will require 



 
 

 261 

a tight control of the mining operation and the management of the various materials delivered 

to the ore stockpile. Separate stockpiles for the 2 materials are planned. 

 

25.2.2 Ore Sorting 
 

The removal of as much amphibolite as possible from the petalite mineralization is key to 

being able to produce high purity petalite concentrate. Consequently, all crusher feed 

material will be passed through the optical sorters plant and where possible, any larger 

amphibolite seams will be selectively mined, and the material sent straight to the waste 

stockpile. The crushing plant has been sized such that it can process a much higher tonnage 

than expected in order to accommodate any feed material with unusually high levels of 

amphibolite while still providing the required mill feed tonnage. 

 

25.2.3 Resources 
 

There is significant up-side potential with regards additional resources through development 

of known outcrops not currently included in the Project, mining deeper either through 

extending the pit or going underground, and through identifying new, currently un-detected 

mineralization. 

 

25.2.4 Products, Prices and Demand 
 

Available information on lepidolite and petalite pricing is very limited but Avalon has carried 

out its own assessment of the markets based on purchased reports, information presented at 

conferences, discussions with industry participants and more importantly, with potential off-

takers as part of on-going off-take agreement negotiations. Micon has reviewed the volume 

and pricing information prepared by Avalon and has independently confirmed that Avalon's 

projections are reasonable for the purpose of this PEA.  

 

As lithium price forecasts appear to remain at current levels (or higher) and the availability of 

lithium feed materials for the ceramics industry tightens it is not expected that prices for 

either of the lithium concentrates will drop (if at all) below those used in the study. 

 

The proposed feldspar production schedule is based around the supply into a number of 

markets which provides a great deal of flexibility for off-take and expansion possibilities, 

particularly as the targeted feldspar production level is only about 40% of the potentially 

recoverable product. Introducing the feldspar circuit earlier into the Project could also 

generate an additional CAD11 million per year in pre-tax revenue. 

 

The final flotation tails after the recovery of petalite and feldspar from the petalite 

mineralized material is a very low impurity silica product which could be suitable for a 

number of applications within the ceramics/glass industry. This marketing opportunity has 

not yet been fully explored by Avalon, but it could provide an additional, small (probably) 

source of revenue as well as reducing the amount of tailings material to be accommodated at 

site. 



 
 

 262 

25.2.5 Process Performance 
 

The Project economics are greatly driven by the petalite recovery. The flotation processes 

involved are quite complex particularly when making the very low impurity product (Super 

Petalite). Reagent dosage control will be key as will maintaining the separate water circuits 

and preventing cross-contamination. Both of these aspects have received considerable 

attention when developing the process flowsheets 

 

25.2.6 Mining 
 

The forecast mining cost represents around 30% of total production costs and is estimated 

using typical industry contractor rates for open pit operations of this scale. Further mine 

design work is required before final tonnages of material (plant feed plus waste) to be mined 

can be more accurately defined. As indicated above, the potential for mining underground 

warrants further investigation as it could not only provide additional feed resources but also 

reduce the volumes of waste rock generated. 

 

25.2.7 Purchasing Used/Refurbished Equipment 
 

The capital cost estimate has assumed all equipment is purchased new, but there are 

significant opportunities to reduce equipment costs, particularly for the mill, by purchasing 

used/refurbished items. In addition, there is the potential for significant savings through 

sourcing equipment and modular "plants" direct from China, particularly for the crushing 

plant. 

 

25.2.8 Foreign Exchange Rate 
 

A lot of the mechanical equipment is being sourced from outside Canada and is priced in 

American dollars. Similarly, all revenue is in USD. An exchange rate of CAD1.30:USD1 has 

been used. Should the Canadian dollar strengthen this would be positive in terms of initial 

capex, but then negative with respect to subsequent revenue once in production. 

 

25.3 CONCLUSIONS 
 

Avalon has the opportunity to produce feed materials (petalite, lepidolite and feldspar) into a 

wide range of industrial, ceramics and chemical markets through the development of the 

Separation Rapids Lithium Project. The estimated capital cost is low for a mining project 

(CAD77.7 million) and economic returns attractive with a post-tax IRR of 22.7% and an 

NPV of CAD102 million. Undiscounted payback is just under 6 years leaving a tail of 14 

years of planned production there-after with a number of options available for potentially 

extending the Project life. Post-tax, undiscounted net cash flow from the 20 years operation is 

almost CAD330 million. 

 

Market demand for the lithium mineral products is increasing as more and more lithium is 

required for the expanding battery and energy storage industries and this is resulting in a 



 
 

 263 

squeeze on supply into the ceramics industry – a void Avalon hopes to help resolve. Avalon 

already has a non-binding letter of intent for the lepidolite concentrate from a Canadian based 

customer and a number of potential markets for the feldspar have been identified. Avalon is 

also in discussions with 4 potential major petalite customers.  

 

The Project enjoys strong support from the community as well as from local politicians, First 

Nations and environmental NGOs. Avalon is also in discussions with a number of local 

businesses towards collaboration on future opportunities including contractor mining, power 

supply, local fabrication and product transportation. 

 

The start of operations is not anticipated to be subject to approvals under the Canadian 

Environmental Assessment Act 2012 (CEAA) as the mine does not exceed any of the CEAA 

triggers including mine and mill tonnages. The Project will not have any new impacts to fish 

or fish habitat, nor will it impact on any Federal Wildlife Areas or Migratory Bird 

Sanctuaries. Final Permitting and Approval for the Project is therefore expected to be 

relatively short and simple. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 
 

 264 

26.0 RECOMMENDATIONS 
 

26.1 OVERVIEW 
 

The preliminary economic assessment presents an attractive Project and the opportunity to 

generate significant revenue for Avalon – it is recommended, therefore, that the Project 

continues to the next stage of development which should be the completion of a full FS.   

 

26.2 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT 
 

26.2.1 Feasibility Study 
 

The next step in developing the Project should be the completion of a full economic and 

technical FS in order to confirm these initial findings and to help source the necessary capital 

required for project implementation.  

 

If possible, this FS should be conducted by an EPCM/Engineering group and other specialist 

consultants capable of designing and implementing the final project. In so doing engineering 

costs and implementation time will likely be reduced.  

 

26.2.2 Resources 
 

In order to maintain the proposed production levels and mine life, additional measured and 

indicated resources are required for an FS. It is probable that this requirement can largely be 

achieved by up-grading the inferred material through further, in-fill drilling and by mining 

deeper. 

 

However, additional exploration drilling is also recommended in order to evaluate the 

potential for further, new near surface material in order to potentially reduce waste quantities 

and reduce mining costs.  

 

26.2.3 Mining 
 

The FS will require a more detailed mine plan and mining contract proposal based upon the 

revised mineral resource resulting from the above recommended work. A trade-off study for 

open pit vs. underground mining should also be conducted to determine if underground 

mining can be made economically viable and at what depth.  

 

26.2.4 Processing Plant 
 

Further "mini-pilot" flotation work is recommended to confirm petalite recovery figures from 

the lepidolite mineralization and to better define the composition of the feldspar product from 

this material. 

 



 
 

 265 

Additional reagent recovery and water treatment investigations are also proposed in order to 

maximise recycling potential and to confirm the quality of the recycled water. 

 

The equipment cost for the crusher plant and flotation circuits (petalite/lepidolite and 

feldspar) are both based on the concept of being modular, pre-assembled/containerized 

packages in order to minimize, as far as possible, on-site construction activities. This concept 

should be carried forward into the FS although a trade-off study may be warranted just to 

confirm and quantify the economic benefits of such an approach. 

 

26.2.5 Environmental and Permitting 
 

Completion of the validation and update of the 2007 baseline data is required and anticipated 

in the near future. Additional drilling to further develop and finalize the site hydrology and 

groundwater management plan is needed. Based on the results of the ongoing humidity cell 

and other test work on the anticipated waste materials and the plant and site water balance, a 

final design of the water management facilities is required. In consultation with regulators 

and other stakeholders, limited ongoing monitoring for surface and groundwater quality and 

quantity is recommended. 

 

Based on the above and this PEA, a Certified Closure Plan is required for submission to the 

MNDMorder to expedite the permitting process, the recommended trade off study and 

feasibility level design for the TMF containment structures should be initiated for the ECA 

permit applications for these structures. The route for the power line must be finalized and 

obtaining all required information for permitting should be initiated in consultation with 

MNRF.  Similarly, detailed engineering for the air and water emissions equipment are 

required to initiate the MECP air and water ECAs.
