NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

ITEM 1 SUMMARY 
1.1 Introduction 
Golder Associates Ltd. (Golder) was retained by Focus Ventures Ltd. (Focus) as an independent qualified entity 
to review and report on estimates of Mineral Resources and to prepare an NI 43-101 technical report for the 
Bayovar 12 Phosphate Project located in the Piura Region of Peru (Figure 1.1, Project Location Map). 

The Bayovar 12 Concession shows potential to host a large sedimentary phosphate deposit.  The Bayovar 
district is situated in the Sechura Desert, a north-trending basin approximately 22,000 square kilometres (km2) in 
area comprising Miocene-aged sedimentary rocks. Phosphate was discovered in the 1950s during drilling for 
petroleum.  It occurs as beds of pelletal phosphate within the Zapallal Formation, a thick sequence of diatomite, 
phosphorite and sandstone.  The phosphorite beds are remarkably regular in P2O5 content over long distances, 
a typical characteristic of marine phosphate deposits.  

Vale is believed to be mining the same beds at their Bayovar Mine 15 kilometres (km) to the west of the Bayovar 
12 Concession. 

1.2 Project Location and Access 
The Bayovar 12 Concession is located in the Sechura Province, Piura Region of northwestern Peru (Figure 1.1, 
Project Location Map).  The property is located approximately 950 km north of the Peruvian capital, Lima, 65 km 
south of the town of Sechura and 90 km southwest of Piura. The concession is approximately 40 km east of the 
fishing village of Puerto Rico, situated on the southern margin of Sechura Bay on the Pacific coast of Peru. 

The Bayovar 12 project area is accessible year round via a series of multi-lane sealed roads and highways.  The 
Pan-American Highway crosses the eastern end of the property and the Chiclayo-Bayovar road transects the 
property.  A network of un-maintained drill roads and access roads for minor surface gypsum mining operations 
provide four wheel drive vehicle access to the remainder of the property. 

Travel time from Piura to the Bayovar 12 Concession is approximately 1.5 hours by car via the Pan-American 
Highway.  Piura is serviced by a modern domestic airport with commercial daily service to Lima and other 
airports in the region.  Air travel flying time from Piura to Lima is approximately 1.5 hours. 

The concession is also located 40 km inland by paved road from marine port facilities located on Sechura Bay.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

1.3 Property Ownership 
On January 14, 2014, Focus' Peruvian subsidiary, Agrifos Peru SAC (Agrifos), signed a formal option agreement 
for the acquisition of shares in Juan Paulo Quay SAC (JPQ), the titleholder of the Bayovar 12 non-metallic 
mining concession (Figure 1.2, Concession Map).  JPQ is a marine transport and service provider owned by 
subsidiaries of Grupo Romero (Peru) and Mamut Andino C.A. (Ecuador). 

Focus (via Agrifos) can earn a 70% interest of the issued share capital of JPQ by investing in exploration and 
drilling, including spending US$1,000,000 within 12 months from the date that it receives its exploration permit 
from the Peruvian authorities (completed as of the effective date of this technical report).  Focus must complete 
a positive Pre-Feasibility study by the fourth anniversary and pay the owners US$4,000,000 in cash in the 
following instalments: 

 US$50,000 on signing of the Letter of Intent (paid as of the effective date of this technical report); 

 US$200,000 on signing of the formal Option Agreement (paid); 

 US$750,000 6 months after receiving the exploration permits (paid); and, 

 US$3,000,000 on the first anniversary of receiving the permits (due February 2015). 
Focus must also pay JPQ US$1,000,000 on the second anniversary of receiving the permits and on each 
subsequent anniversary until it completes a Pre-Feasibility level study. If JPQ decide to sell their 30% interest, 
Focus will have the first right of refusal to purchase. 

1.4 Geological Setting 
The Bayovar-Sechura phosphate deposit is a sedimentary phosphate deposit.  Sedimentary phosphate deposits 
are stratiform bodies that commonly comprise alternating mineralized and barren zones; the individual zones can 
range from sub-metre thickness up to tens of metres thick, with the overall thickness of mineralized and barren 
sequence commonly forming in excess of several hundred metres.  The deposits typically cover significant areal 
extents, often extending for tens or hundreds of kilometres in their maximum lateral dimensions.  

Sedimentary phosphate deposits form in marine sedimentary basins where upwelling, nutrient-rich, cold waters 
interact with the warm surface seawater layer, creating favourable conditions for intense algal blooms. Algal 
blooms develop as algae multiply at rapid rates in nutrient rich, shallow marine environments (allowing for 
significant sunlight input to aid in the photosynthetic process).  During algal blooms the algae biomass increases 
significantly as algae multiply.  The combination of high biomass and rapid multiplication of the algae often leads 
to toxic and/or anoxic conditions that prove fatal to both algae and other marine organisms. 

Conditions favourable for the depositional and biochemical process are found in areas of warm paleo-climate, 
typically occurring between the 40th parallels at the time of deposition.  The water depth at time of deposition 
and biogenic activity can range from 40 metres (m) to in excess of 300 m. 

The Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit occurs in the Sechura Basin, a shallow north trending basin that 
formed as a result of subsidence along the paleo-continental shelf.  The Sechura Basin is bordered by the 
Illescas Mountains to the west and the foothills of the Andes Mountains to the east.  The basin is filled by a thick 
sequence of interlayered marine sediments including phosphorite, diatomite, sandstone, shale and volcanic tuff,

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

ranging in age from Eocene (56.0 to 33.90 million years ago (Ma)) at the base to Pliocence (5.33 to 2.58 Ma) in 
the upper basin. 

The phosphate bearing units occur in the upper 135 to 215 m of the Miocene (23.22 to 5.33 Ma) strata in the 
basin, within the Zapallal Formation.  The Zapallal Formation comprises a cyclical series of interlayered marine 
basin fill diatomites and phosphorites with lesser sandstone and tuff 

The Zapallal Formation stratigraphy dips gently to the east within the Bayovar 12 Concession.  No faulting or 
folding was identified within the concession. 

1.5 Mineralization 
Focus has intercepted 15 distinct and correlatable phosphorite beds (identified as PH01 through PH15) across 
the concession.  Focus and Golder have interpreted the upper 13 phosphorite beds (PH01 to PH13) as Diana 
ore zone Beds with the lower two beds (PH14 and PH15) interpreted as phosphorite beds occurring in the 
underlying Tuffaceous Diatomite unit.   

The individual phosphorite beds exhibit relatively uniform thickness and P2O5 grade profiles across the 
concession; however, there is a pronounced zonation of P2O5 grades in both the phosphorite and diatomite beds 
that effectively divides the Diana ore zone into an Upper Diana ore zone and Lower Diana ore zone.   

The Upper Diana ore zone phosphorite beds (PH01 through PH05) exhibit high mean grades and are separated 
by low grade diatomite beds with mean grades all below 2 wt.% P2O5. 

Below PH05 there is a marked change in the nature of the diatomite beds with mean grades all in excess of 2 
wt.% P2O5.  The sole exception is diatomite bed IB11, located between PH10 and PH11, which consistently 
exhibits mean P2O5 grades below 2 wt.% across the concession.  Because of the signature low grade profile, the 
IB11 diatomite was used by both Focus and Golder as a marker bed during the correlation process. 

The Zapallal Formation units are interpreted to continue in all directions beyond the limits of the 2014 drilling 
program.  Due to concession boundary limits planned future exploration drilling will concentrate on expanding 
the resource to the east of the Tablazo ridge, where the phosphorite beds are closer to surface due to lower 
surface elevations. 

1.6 Exploration Work 
JPQ performed limited reconnaissance exploration work on the Bayovar 12 Concession in 2012; however, 
details on the data and methodology were limited and as a result were not used by Focus or Golder. 

The only significant exploration program on the Bayovar 12 Concession is the 2014 exploration program 
implemented by Focus; a detailed discussion of the 2014 Focus Exploration Program is presented in Item 10 of 
this Technical Report. 

There have been no surface geochemical sampling programs conducted on the Bayovar 12 Concession and 
there have been no surface or airborne geophysical surveys conducted on the Bayovar 12 Concession. 

1.7 Drilling 
Detailed exploration drilling activities on the Bayovar 12 Concession to date have been limited to the 2014 Focus 
exploration program. 

October 2014 
Report No. 1403556-TR 5  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

All drill holes in the 2014 Focus Exploration program were drilled by RAM Peru S.A.C using two skid-mounted 
Boart Longyear LY44 wireline drill rigs with a maximum depth capacity of approximately 530 m for HQ (63.5 mm 
core diameter) core drilling.  All drill holes were drilled vertical, recovering HQ core.  

The 2014 Focus Exploration program resulted in the completion of 20 HQ (63.5 mm core diameter) vertical core 
holes totaling 2,027 m.  Drill hole total depths ranged from 81 to 131 m (mean of 101 m).  All of the drill holes 
were completed to their planned total depths; no drill holes were lost or abandoned due to technical or ground 
issues. 

The drilling was conducted on a nominal 800 by 800 m spaced grid covering approximately 6.5 km2 (650 Ha) of 
the total 125.75 km2 (12,575 Ha) of the Bayovar 12 Concession.  The 2014 drilling program concentrated on the 
western portion of the Bayovar 12 Concession.  As of the effective date of this technical report, a significant 
portion of the concession remained undrilled.   

1.8 Sampling and Analysis 
As part of the 2014 Focus exploration program a total of 2,245 half core (hand split) samples were collected 
through the entire diatomite (1,606 samples) and phosphorite (639 samples) sequence in all 20 drill holes. 
Sample interval lengths ranged from 0.10 to 0.98 m (mean of 0.30 m) in the phosphorite and 0.08 to 1.27 m 
(mean of 0.68 m) in the diatomite.   

All 2014 Focus samples were submitted to Certimin laboratory in Lima Peru for primary analyses.  Pulp 
duplicates were submitted to the SGS Laboratory in Lima Peru for secondary check assay analyses.  The 
standard analytical package performed on all diatomite and phosphorite samples was as follows: P2O5 
(gravimetric analysis); major oxides (ICP-OES analysis); and, SiO2 (gravimetric analysis). 

The sampling and analytical component of the 2014 exploration program included a robust Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) protocol which involved the insertion, by Focus personnel, of blind certified 
standards, blanks and core duplicates into the sample stream at regular intervals in order to independently 
assess analytical precision and accuracy of each batch of samples as they are received from the laboratory.  
The laboratories also included their own internal QA/QC protocol that included standards, blanks and replicate 
analyses.  It is Golder's opinion that the Focus QA/QC protocol and the laboratory internal QA/QC protocol were 
appropriate, followed and well documented during the exploration program. 

1.9 Sample Chain of Custody 
All drill core from the 2014 Focus drilling program was transported back to the secure core logging and storage 
facility on a daily basis; core was never left unattended at the drill site.  The core logging and storage facility is 
located inside a locked compound with an armed security guard at the JPQ port facility. 

The drill core was stored in covered core boxes and racked on metal core racks while awaiting logging.  The 
core racks are located outside but have a sheet metal roof covering them to protect them from direct sunlight 
and the elements. 

All core logging and core sampling was performed by Focus geologists and core technicians at the Focus core 
logging facility.  Samples were placed in plastic sample bags and sealed with a cable tie before being placed in a 
plastic sample barrel.  When the core was moist the phosphorite samples were wrapped in brown paper before 
being placed in the sample bags to prevent the phosphorite sample from sticking to the sample bag.

Report No. 1403556-TR 6  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

Sample batches were transported directly from the logging facility to the laboratory by Focus personnel.  Sample 
chain of custody was maintained and documented appropriately throughout the entire process. 

1.10 Geological Model and Resource Estimates 
The Bayovar 12 geological model and resultant Mineral Resource estimate was developed by Golder using data 
and observations from Focus' 2014 exploration program. Source data for the geological model included 20 drill 
holes totaling 2,027 m and 2,245 analytical samples.  The topography data used for the models was a 3 m cell 
digital surface model. 

The geological model was constructed using the Ventyx MineScape geological modelling and mine planning 
software.  The geological model incorporated a differentiated overburden model and a model of the structural 
and grade data for the Diana ore zone, including 15 correlatable phosphorite beds and their corresponding 
diatomite interburden beds.  The MineScape model was developed as a stratigraphic grid model using a 20 by 
20 m grid cell size and a Finite Element Method interpolator for phosphorite and diatomite bed thickness and 
grade components of the model.  Quality parameters modelled include P2O5 (gravimetric analysis), major oxides 
(ICP-OES analysis) and SiO2 (gravimetric analysis).   

Due to issues with the sample handling and processing times for the relative density samples, the samples were 
allowed to air-dry prior to performing moisture analysis and relative density testing; as a result Golder and Focus 
deemed the samples to be unreliable for use in performing relative density analyses.  As reliable relative density 
data was not available, a global default relative density of 1.25 grams per cubic centimetre (dry-basis) and 1.65 
grams per cubic centimetre (wet-basis) was applied to convert estimated phosphorite resource volumes to 
tonnes.  These densities were established based on past Golder experience in similar phosphate deposits. 

As per NI 43-101 guidelines, Golder has reported only in situ phosphate mineral resources as a mine plan, 
processing/metallurgy study, environmental study, economic analysis, marketing analysis, and other modifying 
factor studies have not been completed to a minimum of a Pre-Feasibility level of study as of the effective date of 
the resource estimate.  No minimum thickness, grade cut-off, dilution, recovery or other mining factors have 
been applied to the in situ resource estimate and no mineral reserves are being reported at this time. 

Tonnes and grade for the Indicated phosphate Mineral Resources on an individual phosphorite bed basis are 
presented in Table 1.1, Summary of Indicated Mineral Resources, Beds PH01 to PH13 and tonnes and grade for 
the Inferred phosphate Mineral Resources on an individual phosphorite bed basis are presented in Table 1.2, 
Summary of Inferred Mineral Resources, Beds PH01 to PH13. A summary of the classified Mineral Resources 
for phosphorite beds PH01 through PH13 from the Focus Bayovar 12 Concession is presented in Table 1.3, 
Summary of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, Beds PH01 to PH13.

As a result of the area of influence classification parameters applied and the 800 m nominal spacing of drill holes 
for the 2014 Focus exploration program, no Measured Mineral Resources were classified in the current Mineral 
Resource estimate for the Bayovar 12 Concession.  Additional infill drilling to 400 m spacing between drill holes 
will be required for estimation of Measured Mineral Resources under the current Mineral Resource classification 
parameters. 

The mean grades of individual phosphorite beds vary from 19.56 wt.% P2O5 (PH03) to 8.56 wt.% P2O5 (PH05). 
Significantly, the phosphorite beds closest to surface (PH01 through PH04) comprise some of the best widths 
and highest grades, for example phosphorite bed PH03 (19.56 wt.% P2O5) and PH04 (15.67 wt.% P2O5). These 
upper four beds contribute 30.9 Mt in Indicated Mineral Resources at 14.41 wt.% and 20.5 Mt in Inferred Mineral 
Resources at 14.32 wt.% P2O5 (dry tonnes). A summary of the classified Mineral Resources for phosphorite 
beds PH01 through PH04 is presented in Table 1.4, Summary of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, 
Beds PH01 to PH04.

No minimum thickness, grade cut-off or other mining parameters applied 
Global Default wet density of 1.65 g/cm3 used for wet tonnage calculation 
Global Default dry density of 1.25 g/cm3 used for dry tonnage calculation 

 

The slight decrease in the mean resource grade compared to some of the drill sections is due to the use of 
slightly wider bed thicknesses for some of the narrower beds in the resource calculation.  

The final mining grade will ultimately be a function of several aspects including pit location, mining plan, 
metallurgical process route and plant design.   

The geological model, resource estimation and classification of phosphate resources will be re-evaluated once 
the results of the next phase of resource delineation and in-fill drilling have been completed.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

1.11 Reserve Estimates 
As of the effective date of this technical report there are no current or historical ore reserve estimates for the 
Bayovar 12 Concession. 

1.12 Environmental Work 
As of the effective date of this technical report no environmental work has been undertaken on the Bayovar 12 
Concession by current or previous owners or operators. 

1.13 Processing and Development Work 
As of the effective date of this technical report no phosphate processing or development work has been 
undertaken on the Bayovar 12 Concession by current or previous owners or operators. 

1.14 Mining Operations and Production 
As of the effective date of this technical report there has been no commercial phosphate mining production from 
the Bayovar 12 Concession property.   

Mining activity on the Bayovar 12 Concession property is limited to small scale surface mining of quaternary age 
gypsum that occurs at surface on the low ground in the central portion of the concession.  The gypsum mining 
operation is carried out by JPQ, using a dozer to push the gypsum into piles that are then loaded on to a small 
road haul truck using an excavator.  The gypsum is then transported by truck to the JPQ port facility on Sechura 
bay where it is stockpiled prior to loading onto ships. 

1.15 Conclusions 
The following key conclusions can be made from this technical report: 

 Golder reviewed the procedures and methodology used for the collection of data and observations and 
found them to be properly documented and applied and it is Golder's opinion that the procedures and 
methodology meet industry standards; 

 Golder reviewed all geological and analytical base data and observations and independently verified 
interpretive geology, including unit roof and floor picks and correlations, and is confident the geological 
database is free of errors or omissions and is appropriate for use in geological modelling and Mineral 
Resource estimation; 

 The data and observations from the 2014 Focus Exploration Program were the sole source of exploration 
data included in the modelling database used for developing the geological model and resultant phosphate 
mineral resource estimate; 

 The validated modelling database contained 20 drill holes totaling 2,027 m of HQ core and 2,245 analytical 
samples (1,606 diatomite bed samples and 639 phosphorite bed samples) covering the entire diatomite and 
phosphorite bed sequence in all 20 drill holes; 

 The relative density data from the 2014 Focus exploration drilling program was deemed not reliable for use 
in geological modelling and Mineral Resource estimation due to issues with sample processing and 
handling that resulted in moisture loss.  To facilitate the conversion of modelled volumes to tonnes Golder 
applied a global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis) for all phosphorite and diatomite beds; 

October 2014 
Report No. 1403556-TR 11  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

 Drilling was completed on 800 m centres covering approximately 6.5 km2 (650 Ha) of the total 125.75 km2 
(12,575 Ha) of the Bayovar 12 Concession.  The 2014 drilling program concentrated on the western portion 
of the Bayovar 12 Concession.  As of the effective date of this technical report, a significant portion of the 
concession remained undrilled; 

 All drill holes were collared as vertical and given the subhorizontal orientation of the stratigraphy, all drill 
hole unit thicknesses are representative of true thickness; 

 The final geological model includes 15 phosphorite beds and 15 diatomite beds as well as 4 overburden 
units and 1 underburden unit. Thickness and grade statistics for the phosphorite and diatomite beds; 

 The modeled phosphorite beds are continuing in all directions outside of the extents of the 2014 exploration 
program drilling area; 

 Golder has applied the following area of influence resource classification parameters: 
 Measured Mineral Resources – 400 m spacing between points of observation; 

 Indicated Mineral Resources – 800 m spacing between points of observation; 

 Inferred Mineral Resources – 1,600 m spacing between points of observation. 

 As a result of the area of influence classification parameters applied and the 800 m nominal spacing of drill 
holes for the 2014 Focus exploration program, no Measured Mineral Resources were classified in the 
current Mineral Resource estimate.  Additional infill drilling to 400 m spacing between drill holes will be 
required for estimation of Measured Mineral Resources under the current Mineral Resource classification 
parameters; 

 Golder has estimated a phosphate Indicated Mineral Resource of 115 Mt (dry density) at 12.37 wt.% P2O5 
and an inferred Mineral Resource of 73 Mt (dry density) at 12.44 wt.% P2O5; 

 Resource estimates were reported as in situ tonnage and were not adjusted for mining losses or mining 
recovery; and, 

 This technical report does not include an estimate of Mineral Reserves. 
1.16 Recommendations 
The 2014 Focus exploration program was successful in achieving the goals of phosphate mineralization 
evaluation and initial resource delineation.  In order to advance the project and expand the potential Mineral 
Resources for the project Golder recommends the following: 

 Proceed with additional exploration drilling on 800 m centres to extend coverage to the east as well as to 
the lease boundary limits in the western portion; 

 Infill drilling within the 2014 exploration drilling area on 400 m centres for the purpose of upgrading the 
mineral resources from indicated and inferred categories into the measured category; 

 Perform trial down-hole geophysical surveys for evaluation of potential quantitative identification of 
phosphorite beds for sampling; 

October 2014 
Report No. 1403556-TR 12  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

 Re-evaluate geostatistical analysis of drill hole spacing and resource classification radii; 

 Collect reliable relative density and moisture analytical data for all phosphorite and diatomite beds to 
replace default relative density values used in converting estimated volumes to tonnes; 

 Update the geological model and Mineral Resource Estimates based on data and observations from any 
additional drilling and analytical work; 

 Initiate Preliminary Economic Assessment and or Pre-Feasibility level modifying factors studies including 
but not limited to: 

  mine design and scheduling;  

 geotechnical (pit stability, waste dump and tailings); 

 hydrogeology; 

 hydrology; 

 environmental; 

 beneficiation and recovery;  

 infrastructure and utilities;

ITEM 4 PROPERTY DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION 
4.1 Location 
The Bayovar 12 Concession is located in the Sechura Province, Piura Region of northwestern Peru (Figure 4.1, 
Project Location Map).  The property is located approximately 950 km north of the Peruvian capital, Lima, 65 km 
south of the town of Sechura and 90 km southwest of Piura. The concession is approximately 40 km east of the 
fishing village of Puerto Rico, situated on the southern margin of Sechura Bay on the Pacific coast of Peru. 

The Bayovar 12 Concession is located approximately 15 km northeast of Vale's operating Miski Mayo 
Phosphate Mine (Figure 4.2, Regional Concession Map).  The Bayovar 12 Concession is directly east of the 
Fosfatos del Pacifico (FOSPAC) phosphate reserve area and directly south of the GrowMax Agri Corp. 
phosphate exploration properties.  

The concession is connected by sealed road to tidewater and the JPQ marine port facilities 40 km to the west. 
The marine port facility is used by JPQ principally for the export of gypsum currently mined from the Bayovar 12 
Concession and for phosphate rock produced locally from adjacent concessions. The JPQ port terminal was 
previously used to export phosphate rock extracted from the Bayovar Mine, prior to its acquisition by Vale.   

The Pan-American Highway crosses the claim at its eastern end and power transmission lines for Vale's 
Bayovar Mine transect the Property at its northern end. 

The following sections contain information relating to mineral titles, legal agreements as well as permitting and 
regulatory matters in Peru.  The Golder QP is not qualified to verify these matters and has relied upon 
information provided by Focus including lease agreements and legal opinions concerning Focus' mineral and 
surface rights prepared by Asociado a Baker & McKenzie International, a Peruvian law firm, for the benefit of 
Focus. 

4.2 Mineral Tenure 
JPQ is the title holder of the Bayovar 12 mining concession (Figure 4.3, Concession Map). JPQ is a marine 
transport and service provider owned by Trabajos Maritimos S.A. and Inca Terminals and Mining Inc., 
subsidiaries of Grupo Romero (Peru) and Mamut Andino C.A. (Ecuador), respectively. The Bayovar 12 
Concession comprises 12,575 hectares and was acquired by JPQ in 2007 under a contract with state company 
Activos Mineros S.A.C. for the exploitation of gypsum rock by open pit methods from the claim.  The boundary 
node coordinates for the Bayovar 12 Concession are presented in Table 4.1, Concession Boundary Coordinates.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

In Peru, concessions are map-registered using a grid system at the Instituto Geologico, Minero y Metalurgico 
("INGEMMET") and the Superintendencia Nacional de Registros Publicos ("SUNARP").  Concessions can be 
granted for either metallic or non-metallic minerals and allow both exploration and exploitation.  Mining 
concessions are granted for an indefinite period; however, in order to maintain concessions in good standing, 
titleholders must pay a Mining Good Standing license fee equal to US$3.00 per hectare per year.  

4.3 Surface Rights 
Under Peruvian law, holding a mining concession does not grant title for surface rights.  JPQ was granted 
surface rights access for 99 years and a 30 year land use easement (renewable) under agreements signed with 
the community of San Martin de Sechura (Fundacion Comunal San Martin de Sechura). 

4.4 Agreements and Encumbrances 
On January 14, 2014, Focus' Peruvian subsidiary, Agrifos, signed a formal option agreement for the acquisition 
of shares in JPQ, the titleholder of the Bayovar 12 mining concession.  JPQ is a marine transport and service 
provider owned by Trabajos Maritimos S.A. and Inca Terminals and Mining Inc., subsidiaries of Grupo Romero 
(Peru) and Mamut Andino C.A. (Ecuador), respectively.. 

Focus (via Agrifos) has the option to acquire a 70% interest in the issued share capital of JPQ by fulfilling the 
following;   

 Completing a positive pre-feasibility study within 48 months from February 26 2014, being the date (the 
"Permit Date") that the Company received an exploration permit from the Peruvian authorities;  

 Spending at least US$1,000,000 on exploration and drilling of the property within 12 months of the Permit 
Date (completed as of the effective date of this technical report); and 

 Paying to JPQ a minimum of US$4,000,000 and a maximum of US$7,000,000 as follows: 
i) US$50,000 on signing of the Letter of Intent (paid as of the effective date of this technical report); 

ii) US$200,000 on signing of the formal option agreement (paid); 

iii) US$750,000 no later than six months after the Permit Date (paid);  

iv) US$3,000,000 no later than the earlier of the option exercise or 12 months of the Permit Date; 

v) If the option is exercised between 12 and 24 months of the Permit Date, US$1,000,000 no later than 
the earlier of the option exercise or 24 months of the Permit Date ; 

vi) If the option is exercised between 24 and 36 months of the Permit Date, US$1,000,000 no later than 
the earlier of the option exercise or 36 months of the Permit Date; and 

vii) If the option is exercised between 36 and 48 months of the Permit Date, US$1,000,000 no later than 
the earlier of the option exercise or 48 months of the Permit Date. 

If a positive pre-feasibility study is completed and the option is exercised prior to any of the time periods set forth 
above in v), vi) or vii) above, no additional cash payments will be due.  Following the option exercise, if JPQ 
decide to sell its 30% interest, the Company will have the first right of refusal to purchase such interest.

4.5 Mining Royalties and Taxes 
In order to maintain concessions in good standing, titleholders must pay a Mining Good Standing license fee 
equal to US$3.00 per hectare per year. 

Under Peruvian mining laws, Concession holders must reach an annual production of at least US$100.00 per 
hectare in gross sales within six (6) years from January 1st of the year following the date the title was granted. If 
there is no production on the concession within that period, the titleholder must pay a penalty of US$6.00 per 
hectare or US$1.00 for small scale miners and US$0.50 for artisan miners, during the 7th through 11th years 
following the granting of the concession.  From the 12th year onwards, the penalty is equal to US$20.00 per 
hectare under the general regime, US$5.00 for small scale miners and US$3.00 for artisan miners. The 
titleholder is exempt from the penalty if exploration expenditures incurred during the previous year was 10 times 
the amount of the applicable penalty. Failure to pay the license fees or the penalty for two consecutive years will 
result in the forfeiture of the concession. 

The concession holder also has a royalty agreement with the local community of San Martin de Sechura 
(Fundacion Comunal San Martin de Sechura). The concession holder maintains title by sustaining an annual 
production of 80,000 tonnes of gypsum rock and by paying a royalty of $0.60 per tonne mined.  This royalty is 
also applicable for any other non-metallic minerals extracted via a simple conversion formula. 

4.6 Environmental Liabilities 
Golder is not aware of any environmental liabilities on the Bayovar 12 Project property. 

4.7 Permitting 
The Environmental Regulations for Mining Exploration Projects requires the submittal of an Environmental 
Declaration for projects that include a maximum of 20 drill holes and less than 10 ha of disturbed areas or 
tunnels up to 50 m long; for projects exceeding 20 drill holes, 10 ha of disturbed area or tunneling in excess of 
50 m, a Semi-detailed Environmental Impact assessment is required to be submitted prior to any exploration 
activities. Mining reconnaissance or prospecting does not require an environmental assessment. 

As per Environmental Mining Regulations, the mining concession holder must submit an Environmental Impact 
Assessment once the exploration stage of the project is complete and prior to the commencement of mining 
activities. 

4.8 Other significant factors and risks that may affect access, title, or 
the right or ability to perform work on the property 

The Bayovar 12 Concession is not associated with any Natural Protected Area, nor is the concession within any 
urban or urban expansion zone, archeological site or agricultural area.  Golder is not aware of any other 
significant factors and risks that may affect access, title or the right or ability to perform work on the Bayovar 12 
Concession property.

ITEM 5 ACCESSIBILITY, CLIMATE, LOCAL RESOURCES, 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND PHYSIOGRAPHY 

5.1 Physiography 
The Focus Bayovar 12 Project area is situated within the Sechura Desert in northwestern Peru.  The Sechura 
Desert occurs as a continuous narrow strip along much of the Pacific coast of Peru, stretching inland from 20 to 
100 km, covering an area of approximately 22,000 km2.  The desert slopes gently westward from the foothills of 
the Andes mountain range to the Pacific Coast.  In the Bayovar area the desert is partially bound on the western 
side by the Illescas Mountains that form the Illescas Peninsula on the southern margin of Sechura Bay (Figure 
5.1, Regional Physiography). 

The generally featureless, low-relief character of the Sechura Desert (Plate 5.1) is marked in the Bayovar area 
by several distinct physiographic features, namely the Virilla Estuary, the Tablazo and the Sechura Depression 
(Figure 5.1, Regional Physiography).  The physiographic features present are a result of combined local uplift 
and subsidence as well as erosional activity. 

 

Plate 5.1  Typical landscape on the Bayovar 12 Concession 
 

The Virilla Estuary is a network of shallow channels that connect Sechura Bay on the Pacific Coast with Ramon 
Lake, a large inland lake situated north of the project area.  While the region is classified as a desert and there is 
limited year-round surface water present, the area is subject to tsunami and flooding associated with weather 
and seismic events occurring along the nearby pacific coast.  The Bayovar 12 project area was impacted by the 
floodway associated with the 1998 El Niño event which saw widespread flooding in the low ground surrounding 
the Virrilla Estuary to the north. 

The Tablazo (Plate 5.2) is a prominent regional scale flat-topped table land that runs north-south through the 
Bayovar area, separating a central plateau of higher ground from lower ground to the north, east and west.  The 
steep ridge line marking the edge of the Tablazo ranges in height from 15 to 75 m amsl; elevation on top of the 

October 2014 
Report No. 1403556-TR 23  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

Tablazo ranges from 15 to 75 m amsl compared to 0 to 10 m amsl on the lower plain to the east and 30 to 60 m 
amsl on the low ground to the west that separates the Tablazo from the Illescas Mountains.  The Bayovar 12 
property straddles the eastern ridge of the Tablazo, with the western third of the property situated on top of the 
Tablazo and the eastern two thirds falling on the low ground east of the Tablazo ridge line.   

 

Plate 5.2  Tablazo ridge on the Bayovar 12 Concession, looking west 
 

The Sechura Depression is a steep sided, flat bottomed, topographic depression that transects the Tablazo, 
breaking it into northern and southern regions.  The floor of the Sechura Depression is approximately 35 m 
below mean sea level. The northeastern limit of the Sechura depression is located adjacent to the southwestern 
limit of the Bayovar 12 Concession boundary.   

Much of the Bayovar 12 project surface area is marked by a thin layer of hard packed sand, thin gravel and 
localized gypsum, all of which are quaternary in age.  Large crescent shaped barchan sand dunes (Plate 5.3) 
that slowly migrate across the property in a north-easterly direction are present across most of the project area.  

Vegetation in the Bayovar 12 Project area is sparse, consisting for the most part of drought tolerant low bushes 
(Plate 5.4) and sparse grass and salt tolerant plants in lower elevation areas.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

5.2 Climate 
The Bayovar 12 Project area is situated within the mild desert climate of the Sechura Desert.  The Sechura 
Desert climate is heavily influenced by the confluence of the Humboldt (cold water) and Equatorial (warm water) 
ocean currents that circulate in contrary directions; this typically results in zones of high temperature and low 
precipitation. 

The proximity to the Pacific Ocean results in relatively moderate temperatures year round; the mean monthly 
temperature in the summer months (December to April) is approximately 25°C and in the winter months (May to 
October) is approximately 18°C.  The annual precipitation is approximately 50 millimetres (mm) of rain but can 
increase to in excess of 150 mm in El Niño years.  Wind in the Bayovar 12 Project area is predominantly from 
the southeast, with average wind speed values of 4.1 metres per second (m/s; weak breeze); peak gusts are 
generally around 7 m/s (moderate breeze).  

5.3 Accessibility 
The Bayovar 12 project area is accessible year round via a series of multi-lane sealed roads and highways 
(Figure 5.2, Regional Access).  The Pan-American Highway crosses the eastern end of the property and the 
Chiclayo-Bayovar road (Plate 5.5) transects the property.  A network of un-maintained drill roads and access 
roads for minor surface gypsum mining operations provide four wheel drive vehicle access to the remainder of 
the property. 

 

Plate 5.5  Chiclayo-Bayovar Road on the Bayovar 12 Concession with the Tablazo in the background 
 

Travel time from Piura to the Bayovar 12 Concession is approximately 1.5 hours by car via the Pan-American 
Highway.  Piura is serviced by a modern domestic airport with commercial daily service to Lima and other 
airports in the region.  Air travel flying time from Piura to Lima is approximately 1.5 hours. 

The concession is also located 40 km inland by paved road from the JPQ marine port facility (Plate 5.6) near the 
fishing village of Puerto Rico, located in Sechura Bay on the pacific coast.  Water depth adjacent to the jetty at

the JPQ port facility is approximately 8 m, currently allowing for loading of 24,0000 Deadweight tonnage (DWT) 
capacity vessels. 

 

Plate 5.6  JPQ marine port facility on Sechura Bay 
 

5.4 Local Resources and Infrastructure 
The Bayovar 12 project area is approximately 40 km by paved multi-lane road from the JPQ port facility located 
near the fishing village of Puerto Rico, located on Sechura Bay on the pacific coast.  The JPQ port facility is 
situated adjacent to the Vale port facility where phosphate from Vale's Miski Mayo operation (Bayovar Mine) is 
loaded for shipping. 

Power transmission lines for the Vale Miksi Mayo Bayovar Mine also transect the northwest corner of the Focus 
Bayovar 12 property (Figure 5.2, Regional Access).  An easement for power transmission lines to the FOSPAC 
property also transects the northwest corner of the Bayovar 12 property. 

Potential future mining operation at the Bayovar 12 property could be conducted year-round and would not be 
affected by the climate.   

Infrastructure and facilities studies have not been performed to date but it is expected that given the current foot 
print of the mineral resource and the overall Focus concession limits, there would be sufficient surface rights for 
potential mining operations, potential tailings storage areas, potential waste disposal areas and potential 
processing plant facilities.  Likewise, it is anticipated that there would be sufficient site access, power and water 
to support the potential Focus operations.

ITEM 6 HISTORY 
6.1 Ownership History 
On January 14, 2014, Focus' Peruvian subsidiary, Agrifos, signed a formal option agreement for the acquisition 
of shares in JPQ, the titleholder of the Bayovar 12 mining concession.  Focus (via Agrifos) has the option to 
acquire a 70% interest in the issued share capital of JPQ (see Item 4, Property Description and Location, for 
details pertaining to the agreement). 

The Bayovar 12 Concession was acquired by JPQ in 2007 under a contract with state company Activos Mineros 
S.A.C. for the exploitation of gypsum rock and other non-metallic minerals by open pit methods from the 
concession.   

Prior to the acquisition of the Bayovar 12 Concession by JPQ from Activos Mineros S.A.C in 2007, stretching 
back to the 1950's there have been numerous government and commercial entities that have owned portions of 
the overall Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate deposit as summarized in Nardi and Gruber (2008) and Apaza (2012).  
Historical entities with interests in the Bayovar area include Minerales Industriales del Peru (MIDEDSA), ESSO-
Homestake, Minera Bayovar S.A., Kaiser Aluminum and PROBAYOVAR. 

Golder has not been able to establish historical land tenure boundaries for the various past owners in the region.  
As a result, it is possible that a portion or all of the current Bayovar 12 Concession area may have been included 
in the land holdings of some of these historical operators in the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate deposit.  

6.2 Exploration History 
The phosphate deposits of the Bayovar area were discovered in 1955 during regional oil and gas exploration.  
Phosphorite was discovered in the immediate project area in an abandoned road cut in 1958.   

As mentioned in the previous section, there were a number of different historical entities with interests in portions 
of the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit since its discovery in the 1950's; however, Golder has not been able 
to establish what, if any, historical exploration work may have been conducted within the boundary of the area 
that now comprises the Bayovar 12 Concession area.  There are no records of any historical exploration activity 
specific to the property prior to JPQ ownership in 2007. 

JPQ performed limited reconnaissance exploration work on the Bayovar 12 Concession in 2012; however, 
Golder and Focus could not verify the methodology and results from the 2012 JPQ work to a level where they 
could be relied upon for use in the geological modelling process and resultant resource estimates.  As a result 
the 2012 JPQ work was not used for modelling and resource estimation as reported in this technical report. 

The only significant detailed exploration program on the Bayovar 12 Concession is the 2014 exploration program 
implemented by Focus; a detailed discussion of the 2014 Focus Exploration Program is presented in Item 10 of 
this Technical Report. 

At the time of preparation of this report Focus was in the process of submitting a permit application to conduct a 
second phase of drilling on the property.  The permit application was in the government review phase at the time 
this report was being completed; it is anticipated that any approved drilling would commence in late Q4 of 2014.

6.3 Development History 
As of the effective date of this technical report there has been no phosphate development work undertaken on 
the Bayovar 12 Concession by current or previous owners or operators. 

6.4 Historical Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates 
As of the effective date of this technical report there are no historical phosphate mineral resource estimates or 
phosphate mineral reserve estimates for the Bayovar 12 Concession property. 

6.5 Production History 
As of the effective date of this technical report there has been no commercial phosphate mining production from 
the Bayovar 12 Concession property.   

Mining activity on the Bayovar 12 Concession property is limited to small scale surface mining of quaternary age 
gypsum that occurs at surface on the low ground immediately east of the Tablazo.  The gypsum mining 
operation is carried out by JPQ, using a dozer to push the gypsum into piles that are then loaded on to a small 
road haul truck using and excavator.  The gypsum is then transported by truck to the JPQ port facility on 
Sechura bay where it is stockpiled prior to loading onto ships.

ITEM 7 GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND MINERALIZATION 
7.1 Regional Geology 
7.1.1 Regional Stratigraphy 
The following section summarizes the regional geology as presented by McClellan (1989), Cheney et al., (1979) 
Bech (2009) and references therein. 

The Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit occurs in the Sechura Basin (Figure 7.1, Regional Geology Map), a 
shallow north trending basin situated in northwestern Peru.  The Sechura Basin is bordered by the Illescas 
Mountains to the west and the foothills of the Andes Mountains to the east.  The basin is filled by a thick 
sequence of interlayered marine sediments including phosphorite, diatomite, sandstone, shale and volcanic tuff, 
ranging in age from Eocene (56.0 to 33.90 Ma) at the base to Pliocence (5.33 to 2.58 Ma) in the upper basin. 

The Sechura basin formed as a result of subsidence along the paleo-continental shelf.  Cycles of uplift and 
subsidence modified the basin during its long infilling history, with basement faults partially controlling basin 
geometry during deposition.  The stratigraphy is subhorizontal, dipping gently at 2° to 3° across the basin.   

The phosphate bearing units occur in the upper 135 to 215 m of the Miocene (23.22 to 5.33 Ma) strata in the 
basin, within the Zapallal Formation.  The Zapallal Formation comprises a cyclical series of interlayered marine 
basin fill diatomites and phosphorites with lesser sandstone and tuff.  A detailed discussion of the Zapallal 
Formation stratigraphy and structure is presented in the section below. 

The Zapallal Formation is underlain by older Miocene, Oligocene and Eocene age marine basin fill sedimentary 
units which unconformably overlay metamorphic and igneous basement rocks of Paleozoic (541 to 252 Ma) and 
Precambrian (greater than 541 Ma) in age.  As a result of late Eocene basement uplift and basin subsidence the 
Paleozoic basement is exposed in the Illescas Mountains along the western margin of the basin. 

The Zapallal Formation is unconformably overlain by Pliocene age interbedded coquina, sandstone and shale.  
The stratigraphy is capped by a thin cover of unconsolidated Quaternary (2.58 Ma to present) age alluvial and 
aeolian sand with localized occurrences of gypsum.  

7.1.2 Zapallal Formation Detailed Stratigraphy 
The marine basin fill Zapallal Formation is subdivided into four members, which are in turn subdivided into 
distinct units or zones (Figure 7.2, Zapallal Formation Stratigraphic Column).  The formation and its subdivision 
presented from oldest to youngest are as follows: 

 Lower Diatomite and Phosphorite Member 
 Tuffaceous Diatomite – Thickness is in excess of 50 m, predominantly foraminifera-rich diatomite with 

numerous thin beds of tuff and three isolated phosphorite beds; P2O5 grades in the phosphorite beds 
range from 10 to 18 wt.% and from 1 to 3 wt.% in the diatomite.  The upper contact is gradational with 
the overlying Diana ore zone (note: please refer to Item 2.5 of this technical report concerning the 
usage of the term "ore zone"). 

 Diana ore zone – Mean thickness of 39 m (range of 36 to 41 m). The zone is subdivided into seven 
regionally correlatable phosphorite beds alternating with diatomite beds. The Diana ore zone contains 
the highest P2O5 grades (ranging from 10 to 25 wt.% in the phosphorite beds and 3 to 7 wt.% in the

 diatomite beds) and thickest phosphorite bearing zones in the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate deposit. 
The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Grey Tuff.   

 Grey Tuff – Thickness ranges from 0 to 21 m. Comprises generally massive beds of soft grey 
diatomaceous tuff.  Preservation of the unit varies across the area due to variable and locally significant 
erosion by the overlying Clam Bore Sandstone.  There are no identified or correlatable phosphorite 
beds present within the unit and no significant presence of phosphate pellets, resulting in negligible 
P2O5 grades. The upper contact with the overlying Clam Bore Sandstone is marked by a hiatus and 
angular unconformity; units below the unconformity dip to the east while units above dip to the 
southeast. 

 Clam Bore Sandstone Member – Thickness ranges from 0 to 23 m; the unit is thinnest in the southern 
portion of the basin and thickest in the north and western portions of the basin.  Comprises fine to medium 
grained quartz sand with abundant trace fossils across most of the basin; in areas where the unit is thicker 
the upper portion of the unit comprises a limestone coquina (oyster bank). The upper contact is gradational 
with the overlying Zero ore zone. 

 Upper Diatomite and Phosphorite Member 
 Zero (or Cero) ore zone – Mean thickness of 6 m (range of 3 to 11 m). Comprises a single thick 

phosphorite bed (the Zero Bed) and is overlain by diatomite; P2O5 grade in the Zero Bed can be up to 
18 wt.%, with a mean P2O5 grade of 9 wt.% over the entire zone (phosphorite and overlying diatomite). 
The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Inca Diatomite. 

 Inca Diatomite – Mean thickness of 10 m (range of 5 to 17 m).  Comprises massive beds of diatomite 
with minor pellets but no distinct or correlatable phosphorite beds; P2O5 grade ranges from 1.0 to 2.8 
wt.% throughout the unit. The upper contact is gradational with the overlying Minerva ore zone. 

 Minerva ore zone – Mean thickness of 26 m (range of 23 to 35 m).  Comprises two to three phosphorite 
beds interlayered with diatomite; overall P2O5 grade in the phosphorite beds is lower than those in the 
other zones with grades generally in the 5 to 6 wt.% range although in areas where the unit thins there 
is often an associated increase in P2O5 grade, with values in the 8 to 10 wt.% range.  Grades in the 
diatomite beds range from 2 to 3 wt.% P2O5. The upper contact is gradational with the overlying 
Quechua Diatomite. 

 Quechua Diatomite – Mean thickness of 17 m (range of 12 to 19 m). Comprises massive beds of 
diatomite with localized occurrences of one or two thin phosphorite beds.  Grade across the unit 
(diatomite and localized phosphorite inclusive) is typically 2 wt.% P2O5. The upper contact is gradational 
with the overlying Barren Diatomite Member. 

 Barren Diatomite Member – Thickness range of 0 to 31 m.  Comprises massive diatomite and mica flakes 
are commonly present. There are no identified or correlatable phosphorite beds present within the unit and 
no significant presence of phosphate pellets, resulting in negligible P2O5 grades.  The upper contact is 
marked by a hiatus and angular unconformity separating the Miocene Zapallal Formation from overlying 
Pliocene sandstone and shale; units below the unconformity dip to the southeast while units above are 
horizontal.

7.1.3 Regional Structure 
As identified in the detailed discussion of the Zapallal Formation, there are two regional scale angular 
unconformities identified as impacting the stratigraphy in the basin. The uppermost unconformity occurs at the 
top of the Zapallal Formation (Figure 7.2, Zapallal Formation Stratigraphic Column), marking the contact 
between barren diatomite of Miocene age and coquina, sandstone and shale of the overlying Pliocene 
sedimentary units.  The second unconformity occurs within the Zapallal Formation, marking the contact between 
the Lower Diatomite and Phosphorite Member and the Clam Bore Member. 

There are isolated occurrences of regional scale faulting and folding in the basin, including a regional scale fault 
that transects the FOSPAC Bayovar 9 concession to the west, but for the most part the stratigraphy has seen 
minimal post-depositional tectonic modification. 

7.2 Phosphorite and Diatomite Composition 
7.2.1 Phosphorite 
The phosphorite beds (Plate 7.1) are comprised primarily of massively bedded phosphate pellets with lesser 
grains and fragments of diatoms, volcanic glass; sodium, potassium and magnesium salts; quartz; feldspar; 
sponge fragments; gypsum, mica flakes and organic matter.  The phosphate is marine in nature and is generally 
in the form of fluorhydroxycarbonate apatite. 

The apatite is generally in the form of individual pellets although agglomerations of pellets, oolites, laminae, 
nodules and fragments of teeth, bones or shells are also present.  The pellets are generally subrounded but 
elongated and irregular shaped pellets also present.  The pellet grain size ranges from 0.4 to 2.0 mm in 
diameter, with larger pellets occurring in the phosphorite beds while finer grained pellets occur in the diatomite.  

The pellets range in colour from white to brown to black.  Although the apatite pellets and other grains and 
fragments are generally well sorted within the beds, most of the pore space is filled in with fine fragments of 
diatoms and silt. The specific gravity of individual pellets is typically around 2.9.

7.2.2 Diatomite 
The diatomite beds are comprised primarily of massively bedded aggregates of microscopic diatom fragments 
with variable finer grained apatite pellets and lesser grains and fragments of volcanic glass, shell and bone 
fragments and sponge fragments.  The diatoms are typically composed of opaline silica. 

The diatomite ranges in colour from white to brown to olive green.  The diatomite generally has high porosity, 
often on the order of 90%; as a result of this and its resistance to compaction, the specific gravity is very low, 
typically around 0.5.  

7.3 Property Geology and Mineralization 
The Zapallal Formation stratigraphy dips gently to the east within the Bayovar 12 Concession (Figure 7.3, Local 
Geology Map).  No faulting or folding was identified within the concession.  Interpretation of the 2014 Focus 
exploration drilling in the western portion of the Bayovar 12 Concession indicated that the following stratigraphic 
units (from top downwards) were intercepted on the property: 

 Quaternary sand, gravel and localized gypsum 

 Zapallal Formation 
 Clam Bore Sandstone Member 

 Lower Diatomite and Phosphorite Member 

− Gray Tuff 

− Diana ore zone 

− Tuffaceous Diatomite 

Summary statistics for the various overburden beds are presented in Table 7.1, Overburden Unit Thickness 
Summary Statistics.    Representative cross sections across the 2014 drilling area are presented in Figure 7.4, 
Representative East-West Cross Section and Figure 7.5, Representative North-South Cross Section.

As a result of Quaternary erosional surfaces, the uppermost members of the Zapallal Formation, namely the 
Upper Diatomite and Phosphorite Member and the Barren Diatomite Member, were absent within the 2014

drilling area. This included the absence of the Zero ore zone phosphorite bed (lower most phosphorite bed in the 
Upper Member) that is present several kilometres to the west on the FOSPAC Bayovar 9 Concession.  As the 
stratigraphy is dipping gently to the east, it is possible that the upper portion of the Zapallal Formation may be 
encountered when planned exploration drilling on the property advances to the east. 

Focus has intercepted 15 distinct and correlatable phosphorite beds (identified as PH01 through PH15) across 
the concession.  Focus and Golder have interpreted the upper 13 phosphorite beds (PH01 to PH13) as Diana 
ore zone Beds with the lower two beds (PH14 and PH15) interpreted as phosphorite beds occurring in the 
underlying Tuffaceous Diatomite unit.  The literature on the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit generally 
identifies seven regionally correlatable phosphorite beds in the Diana ore zone; however, Focus and Golder 
interpret the six additional phosphorite beds encountered in the Diana ore zone as locally continuous and 
correlatable beds that aren't necessarily present or correlatable across the entire basin.  Summary thickness and 
P2O5 grade statistics for the phosphorite are presented in Table 7.2, Phosphorite Bed Thickness and P2O5 Grade 
Summary Statistics.  Summary thickness and P2O5 grade statistics for the diatomite beds are presented in Table 
7.3, Diatomite Bed Thickness and P2O5 Grade Summary Statistics. 

The individual phosphorite beds exhibit relatively uniform thickness and P2O5 grade profiles across the 
concession; however, there is a pronounced zonation of P2O5 grades in both the phosphorite and diatomite beds 
that effectively divides the Diana ore zone into an Upper Diana ore zone and Lower Diana ore zone.   

The Upper Diana ore zone phosphorite beds (PH01 through PH05) exhibit high mean grades and are separated 
by low grade diatomite beds with mean grades all below 2 wt.% P2O5. 

Below PH05 there is a marked change in the nature of the diatomite beds with mean grades all in excess of 2 
wt.% P2O5.  The sole exception is diatomite bed IB11, located between PH10 and PH11, which consistently 
exhibits mean P2O5 grades below 2 wt.% across the concession.  Because of the signature low grade profile, 
the IB11 diatomite was used by both Focus and Golder as a marker bed during the correlation process. 

The Zapallal Formation units are interpreted to continue in all directions beyond the limits of the 2014 drilling 
program.  Due to concession boundary limits planned future exploration drilling will concentrate on expanding 
the resource to the east of the Tablazo ridge, where the phosphorite beds are closer to surface due to lower 
surface elevations.

ITEM 8 DEPOSIT TYPES 
8.1 Genetic Model 
The following section summarizes the deposit type and genetic model as presented by Simandl et al. (2012), 
Mosier (in Cox and Singer, 1992), Garrison (1992), Follmi (1996) Froelich et al. (1988), and Cheney et al. 
(1979). 

The Bayovar-Sechura phosphate deposit is a sedimentary phosphate deposit, also commonly referred to as 
upwelling phosphate deposits, stratiform phosphate deposits or phosphorite deposits.  Sedimentary phosphate 
deposits are stratiform bodies that commonly comprise alternating mineralized and barren zones; the individual 
zones can range from sub-metre thickness up to tens of metres thick, with the overall thickness of mineralized 
and barren sequence commonly forming in excess of several hundred metres.  The deposits typically cover 
significant areal extents, often extending for tens or hundreds of kilometres in their maximum lateral dimensions.  

Sedimentary phosphate deposits are biochemical in origin.  The formation of sedimentary phosphate deposits 
occurs throughout geological time, spanning as far back as the Proterozoic (2,500 to 542 Ma) to the present day.  
On the basis of stratigraphy the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate deposit formed during the middle Miocene with 
most of the phosphate deposition occurring between 8.5 to 7 Ma (Garrison, 1992).  Modern sedimentary 
phosphate deposits are currently forming off the Pacific coast of Peru under similar depositional conditions and 
controls that were in place during the Miocene deposition and formation of the Bayovar Phosphate deposit 
(Froelich et al., 1988). 

Both paleo and modern sedimentary phosphate deposits typically develop in marine sedimentary basins that 
occur along passive continental margins.  Conditions favourable for the depositional and biochemical process 
are found in areas of warm paleoclimate (or current climate for modern day equivalents), typically occurring 
between the 40th parallels at the time of deposition.  The water depth at time of deposition and biogenic activity 
can range from 40 m to in excess of 300 m. 

Sedimentary phosphate deposits form in marine sedimentary basins where upwelling, nutrient-rich, cold waters 
interact with the warm surface seawater layer, creating favourable conditions for intense algal bloom. Algal 
blooms develop as algae multiply at rapid rates in nutrient rich, shallow marine environments (allowing for 
significant sunlight input to aid in the photosynthetic process).  During algal blooms the algae biomass increases 
significantly as algae multiply.  The combination of high biomass and rapid multiplication of the algae often leads 
to toxic and/or anoxic conditions that prove fatal to both algae and other marine organisms.  

Cycles of algal bloom and death lead to significant seafloor accumulation of organic phosphate released by the 
algae along with accumulation of skeletons, scales, fecal pellets and other organic debris from algae and other 
marine life forms in areas of upwelling activity. The decomposition of the phosphate bearing organic debris by 
bacteria along with the dissolution of fish bones and scales result in the precipitation of phosphate minerals in an 
anoxic environment within the unconsolidated seafloor sediment near the sediment-water interface.  This 
process is known as phosphogenesis. 

Multiple cycles of marine regression and transgression and cycles of upwelling activity result in changes in the 
depositional environment and associated biochemical processes occurring within the host marine sedimentary 
basin.  These changes commonly result in the cyclical nature of the deposits, where the deposit comprises a 
series of alternating phosphorite and barren (or non-phosphorite) horizons of varying thickness.

The primary phosphate minerals present in most sedimentary phosphate deposits are microcrystalline 
Fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) or Francolite (carbonate-rich Fluorapatite; Ca5(PO4)2.5(CO3)0.5F). The phosphate 
minerals in sedimentary phosphate deposits commonly occur as pellets, oolites, laminae, nodules and fragments 
of teeth, bones or shells. 

The host rocks and the barren horizons within the sedimentary phosphate deposits are most commonly 
diatomite although mudstone, marl, limestone, volcanic ash and sandstone are also known to occur depending 
on changes in the depositional environment and sediment input within the basin.

ITEM 9 EXPLORATION 
9.1 Summary of Non-Drilling Exploration Activity 
Detailed exploration activities on the Bayovar 12 Concession to date have been limited to exploration drilling 
during the 2014 Focus exploration program. 

There have been no surface geochemical sampling programs conducted on the Bayovar 12 Concession and 
there have been no surface or airborne geophysical surveys conducted on the Bayovar 12 Concession. 

The only non-drilling exploration activity on the Bayovar 12 Concession was the development of a digital 
topography model in August 2014. 

9.2 Digital Surface (Topography) Model 
Focus engaged Pacific Geomatics Ltd. of Vancouver, Canada, in August 2014 to prepare a Digital Surface 
Model (DSM) for the Bayovar 12 Concession. The DSM covered the entire extent of the 2014 Focus exploration 
area as well as most of the remainder of the Bayovar 12 Concession (Figure 9.1, Digital Surface Model Extents). 

The DSM was prepared using 1.5 m SPOT6 Tristereo satellite imagery. Gross errors were fixed in the DSM in 
stereo. The easting and northing data was adjusted by Pacific Geomatics Ltd. to fit with available 0.50 m data for 
the area. Although DSM models differ from Digital Elevation Models (DEM) in that DSM's do not process out 
features like vegetation and building, there are no such features present on the Bayovar 12 Concession.

ITEM 10 DRILLING 
10.1 Drilling Summary 
Detailed exploration drilling activities on the Bayovar 12 Concession to date have been limited to the 2014 Focus 
Exploration Program. 

The 2014 Focus Exploration Program resulted in the completion of 20 HQ (63.5 mm core diameter) vertical core 
holes totaling 2,027 m.  Drill hole total depths ranged from 81 to 131 m (mean of 101 m); total depth variation 
was due to the location relative to the Tablazo.  All of the drill holes were completed to their planned total depths; 
no drill holes were lost or abandoned due to technical or ground issues.  A summary of the 2014 Focus drill 
holes is presented in Table 10.1, 2014 Focus Drill Hole Summary.

10.2 Drilling Results 
All 20 of the 2014 Focus drill holes intercepted the full sequence of target phosphorite beds.  The entire 
sequence of 15 phosphorite beds spanned a total mean thickness of 40 m (range of 24 to 54 m) including 
interburden diatomite beds.  Depths from surface to the roof of the upper most phosphorite bed (PH01) ranged 
from 50 m below surface in the Tablazo area to 26 m below surface in the low area to the east of the Tablazo.  
The floor of the lower most phosphorite bed (PH15) ranged from 104 m below surface in the Tablazo area to 73 
m below surface in the low area to the east.  

Drill hole thickness and grade statistics for the individual phosphorite beds are presented in Table 10.2, 
Phosphorite Bed Thickness and P2O5 Grade Summary Statistics.  Drill hole thickness and grade statistics for the 
individual diatomite beds are presented in Table 10.3, Diatomite Bed Thickness and P2O5 Grade Summary 
Statistics Geological sections and isopleth maps are presented in Item 14 of this technical report.

Core recovery for all units was very good during the 2014 drilling program, with mean core recovery of 99% 
(range of 42% to 100%).  There were only 29 occurrences with core recovery less than 90% and only a single 
occurrence where core recovery was less than 50%.  The core recovery within the phosphorite beds mirrored 
the overall recovery values with a mean of 99% (range of 42% to 100%) but with only 7 occurrences of recovery 
less than 90% and only a single occurrence where core recovery was less than 50%. 

Overall the Rock Quality Designation (RQD) for all units was fair to excellent with a mean RQD of 67% (range of 
0% to 100%).  The RQD within the phosphorite beds showed a slight improvement over the RQD for all units, 
with a mean of 78% (range of 0% to 100%), considered good to excellent.  

A total of 2,245 half core (hand split) samples were collected from all 20 drill holes through the entire diatomite 
(1,606 samples) and phosphorite (639 samples) sequence in all 20 drill holes. Sample interval lengths ranged 
from 0.10 to 0.98 m (mean of 0.30 m) in the phosphorite and 0.08 to 1.27 m (mean of 0.68 m) in the diatomite.  A 
detailed discussion of the analysis methods and the analytical results from the sampling program are presented 
in Item 11 of this technical report. 

10.3 Drilling Procedures and Methodology 
The following sections detail the exploration drilling program procedures and methodology employed by Focus 
during the 2014 Focus exploration program.

Report No. 1403556-TR 50  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

10.3.1 Drilling Methodology 
All 20 drill holes in the 2014 Focus Exploration program were drilled by RAM Peru S.A.C using two skid-mounted 
Boart Longyear LY44 wireline drill rigs (Plate 10.1) with a maximum depth capacity of approximately 530 m for 
HQ core drilling.  All 20 drill holes were drilled vertical, recovering HQ size (63.5 mm core diameter) core.  
Downhole directional surveys were not performed on the drill holes; given the short total length of the holes, the 
orientation of stratigraphy or fabrics in the rocks (oriented normal to the drill hole) and the broad overall drill 
spacing (800 m centres) lateral deviation of the drill holes was deemed negligible.  

Drilling was conducted on a single 12 hour shift each day.  Typical drilling rate was 1 to 1.5 days per drill hole.  
Drilling of the 20 drill holes commenced on March 1, 2014 and was completed on April 5, 2014.   

Drill site supervision, core logging and sampling duties were performed by Focus senior geologists and technical 
personnel. 

 

Plate 10.1  Drilling on the Bayovar 12 Concession 
 

10.3.2 Drill Hole Location Methodology 
All drill hole platforms were located by Focus senior geologists using a handheld Garmin GPS.  The planned drill 
holes were located on a nominal 800 by 800 m spaced grid covering approximately 6.5 km2 (650 Ha). 

After completion, drill holes are sealed with a cement monument (Plate 10.2) and marked clearly using PVC pipe 
or wooden stakes to withstand wind and sand dune cover.  The drill hole name, total depth and completion date 
were inscribed in the cement monument prior to the cement setting. 

On completion of the drill program all cement monuments were surveyed by a professional land surveyor using 
Total Station GPS to record collar surveys to an accuracy of +/-0.1m in X, Y and Z dimensions. The surveying 
for the 2014 drill program was performed by Peruanas de Inversiones R & L S.A.C., of Chiclayo Peru.

10.3.3 Core handling and Visual Logging Methodology 
Exploration Data Collection and Documentation 
All measurements, observations, sample intervals and other associated information collected during the core 
logging and sampling process were recorded by the Focus geologists directly into an Excel drill hole logging 
datasheet for each individual drill hole.  All digital data entry was performed by the geologist at the time of 
logging rather than being transcribed at a later date.  All information pertaining to an individual drill hole was 
recorded on specialized tabs within the single excel file for that drill hole, allowing for single source for records 
for each individual drill hole.  The drill hole logging datasheet included tabs for: 

 Collar location and completion details; 

 Drill hole orientation; 

 Downhole lithology observations; 

 Phosphate mineralization observations; 

 RQD and Total Core Recovery measurements and calculations; 

 Geotechnical observations and measurements; 

 Sampling intervals and analytical QA/QC insertion records; and, 

 Imported analytical results. 
Core Handling 
Core was boxed at the drill site and transported to the secure core logging facility (Plate 10.3) by Focus or RAM 
drilling personnel on a daily basis.  The core boxes were laid out sequentially and visually inspected to ensure all

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

boxes were accounted for and that core boxes and depth markers were clearly labeled and in the correct 
downhole order. 

The Focus core logging facility was located inside the secure (gated and armed guard) JPQ port facility.  The 
core logging area was purpose built and included areas for logging, core splitting and sampling.  Core was 
stored on covered steel core racks (Plate 10.4) while awaiting logging and sampling.

Core Photography 
Before core splitting, logging and sampling commenced each complete core box was photographed using a 
tripod mounted digital camera and photos were archived for reference purposes (Plate 10.5). The core 
photography set up was standardized so that all core box photographs were consistent in terms of quality, scale 
and resolution.  Drill hole names and depth marker blocks were oriented so as to be clearly read in each 
photograph.  In addition to the core box photographs, detailed close-up photographs were also taken for any 
stratigraphic, structural, mineralization or other features of interest.  All photos were labeled using a systematic 
numbering system that clearly indicates drill hole name and depth interval in the photograph name.  Photographs 
were reviewed by the geologist to ensure they met the required standards prior to splitting the core.

Geotechnical Logging 
Once photographed the core was reoriented and fitted together as appropriate prior to measuring the length of 
core recovered for every drill interval and calculating the Total Core Recovery; the recovered length and Total 
Core Recovery were recorded in the drill logging sheet.  The RQD was also calculated for each drill run by 
counting the number of whole core pieces that were equal to or greater than 10 cm in length.  The RQD results 
were recorded in the drill logging datasheet.  Observations on the spacing, frequency and infill material on joints 
and fractures were also recorded in the drill logging datasheet. 

Core Splitting 
Once the Total Core Recovery, RQD and other geotechnical observations were recorded on the whole core, a 
longitudinal cut line was marked on the core by the logging geologist.  The logging geologist also marked the 
core to indicate which side would be sampled and which side would be retained for reference so that the same 
side of the core was submitted from consecutive sample intervals to avoid any sample selection bias.  

Once marked up the core was moved to the sample splitting stations in the Focus core facility.  The core for the 
entire drill hole was split longitudinally by hand by Focus technical personnel.  A core technician placed

individual core segments in a form to hold the core in place on the splitting bench.  A 3 to 5 mm deep groove 
was then cut along the longitudinal cut line on the core segment using a hand saw (Plate 10.6).  A cleaver was 
then placed in the cut and gently struck with a hammer to split the core in half (Plate 10.7).  This procedure was 
used on most of the core except in instances where the material was very soft, in which case it was split by a 
knife or sampling spoons.  This core splitting method allowed for the best results in terms of maintaining core 
segment integrity (over a mechanical vise style sample splitter or water cooled saw) as well as providing a 
natural fracture surface that allowed for easy evaluation of fine textural features and estimation of apatite pellets 
that was not possible on the polished cut surfaces created by a rock saw.

Descriptive Logging 
Once split, both halves of the core segments were carefully returned to the core box and then the boxes were 
returned to the core logging benches and laid out in down hole order to allow for detailed logging of the lithology, 
structure and mineralization. 

Lithology descriptions included down hole depth intervals, colour, grain size, porosity, facies type, interpreted 
unit name and a detailed comment or description of each interval.  A new interval record was created in the 
descriptive log any time a change in the colour, grain size, facies or geological unit occurred.  The logging 
geologist marked observed and interpreted geological unit and facies interval boundaries on the core during the 
visual logging process (Plate 10.8).  All lithology interval descriptions were then recorded directly into the drill 
logging datasheet by the logging geologist (Plate 10.9).

Grade Estimation  
Once the lithology logging process was completed and the geological unit and facies boundaries were 
determined and marked on the core by the logging geologist, the diatomite and phosphorite intervals identified in 
the visual logging process were inspected by the logging geologist using a magnified hand lens.  Using the hand 
lens and a set of percentage composition estimation charts the logging geologist identified grade zones based 
on estimating the apatite pellet contents in each interval (Plate 10.10).  Individual diatomite and phosphorite 
intervals were subdivided into multiple grade intervals whenever there were 5% changes (positive or negative) in 
the estimated pellet content.   

The grade estimation process for all 20 drill holes was performed by two senior geologists to minimize variability 
and/or bias in the grade estimation process.  The two senior geologists regularly cross checked each other's 
estimates to ensure they were consistently estimating grade intervals. 

Once the grade intervals were established and marked on the drill core, the logging geologist recorded the 
percentage, type (pellets, ooids, teeth, bone fragments etc.), grain size, shape, colour and a detailed description 
for each interval directly into the drill logging datasheet. 

Once the grade estimation process was completed the core was ready for the sampling process.  A detailed 
discussion of the sampling, analyses and analytical QA/QC process is presented in Item 11 of this technical 
report.

10.4 Drilling Factors Impacting Accuracy and Reliability of Results 
It is Golder's opinion that the 2014 Focus exploration program was carried out according to appropriate 
professional methodologies and procedures, including those presented in the CIM Exploration Best Practice 
Guidelines (August 2000 edition).  The methodology and procedures were well defined and documented prior to 
commencing with the drilling and sampling program.  All components of the program were conducted according 
to the methodology and procedures and were well documented by Focus technical personnel.  All exploration 
work for the 2014 drilling program appears to have been performed by experienced and qualified personnel, 
including Focus personnel as well as third party contractors. 

The overall drill core recovery was very good (mean of 99%), and was very good within the phosphorite beds 
(mean of 99%).  The RQD was fair to excellent overall (mean of 67%) and was good to excellent within the 
phosphorite beds (mean of 78%).  All drill holes were completed to their planned total depths and all drill holes 
intercepted the complete sequence of phosphorite and diatomite beds as predicted prior to drilling. 

Golder is not aware of any factors or concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of the results from the 2014 
Focus exploration program.   

10.5 Interpretation of Drilling Results 
The drilling results from the 2014 Focus exploration program were reviewed and interpreted independently by 
the Focus senior geologists and by the Golder QP.  Drill hole lithology and grade data was used to confirm the 
roof and floor picks for each of the phosphorite intervals as well as the various overburden, interburden and 
underburden units.  Drill hole fences were used to confirm the hole to hole correlation of the phosphorite beds 
and overburden, interburden and underburden units.  A detailed discussion of the interpretation and geological 
modelling process is presented in Item 14 of this technical report.

ITEM 11 SAMPLE PREPARATION, ANALYSES AND SECURITY 
11.1 Sample Summary 
Sampling and phosphate analyses activities on the Bayovar 12 Concession to date have been limited to 
sampling of exploration drill core during the 2014 Focus exploration program. 

As part of the 2014 Focus exploration program a total of 2,245 half core (hand split) samples were collected 
through the entire diatomite (1,606 samples) and phosphorite (639 samples) sequence in all 20 drill holes. 
Sample interval lengths ranged from 0.10 to 0.98 m (mean of 0.30 m) in the phosphorite and 0.08 to 1.27 m 
(mean of 0.68 m) in the diatomite.   

All 2014 Focus samples were submitted to Certimin laboratory in Lima Peru for primary analyses.  Pulp 
duplicates were submitted to the SGS Laboratory in Lima Peru for secondary check assay analyses. 

The standard analytical package performed on all diatomite and phosphorite samples was as follows: 

 P2O5 (gravimetric analysis); 

 major oxides (ICP-OES analysis); and, 

 SiO2 (gravimetric analysis). 
In addition to the analyses indicated above, samples were collected and submitted to Certimin for moisture and 
relative density analysis by water displacement method; however, due to sample handling and processing times 
and methodologies it was determined by Focus and Golder that the relative density samples had experienced 
moisture loss due to air drying and the samples and analytical results were deemed unreliable for determining 
moisture content and relative density.   

As a reliable relative density data was not available for the phosphorite or diatomite beds at the time the model 
and resource estimate were prepared, a global default relative density of 1.25 grams per cubic centimetre 
(g/cm3; dry-basis) and 1.65 g/cm3 (wet-basis) was applied to convert estimated phosphorite resource volumes to 
tonnes. These densities were established based on past Golder experience in similar phosphate deposits.  

The following sections detail the sample selection, collection, transport, preparation and analyses procedures 
and methodology employed by Focus during the 2014 exploration program. 

11.2 Sampling Methodology and Procedures 
11.2.1 Sample Interval Identification 
Sample intervals were marked on the drill core and recorded in the drill logging datasheet by the Focus logging 
geologist.  Sample interval lengths ranged from 0.10 to 0.98 m (mean of 0.30 m) in the phosphorite and 0.08 to 
1.27 m (mean of 0.68 m) in the diatomite. 

Focus sampled the entire continuous sequence of diatomite and phosphorite in each drill hole so that there were 
no gaps in the downhole sampling record.  This was done to provide detailed interburden dilution grade data and 
to allow for the potential evaluation of bulk mining of closely spaced during later modelling, mine planning and 
processing activities.  The continuous sampling also provided flexibility in adjusting phosphorite and diatomite

boundaries should the analytical results support such adjustment in areas where the contacts were gradational 
or grade variation was difficult to assess. 

11.2.2 Sample Collection and Packaging 
Once each sample interval was recorded in the drill logging datasheet the logging geologist selected each 
sample in sequence (Plate 11.1) and placed each one inside a plastic sample bag pre-labeled with the sample 
number.  A sample tag was also placed inside the sample bag before the bag was sealed with a cable tie (Plate 
11.2).  When the core was moist the phosphorite samples were wrapped in brown paper (Plate 11.3) before 
being placed in the sample bags to prevent the phosphorite sample from sticking to the sample bag.  The 
sample number and the sample interval from and to depths were recorded in the directly into the drill logging 
datasheet by the logging geologist. 

The sealed sample bags were then placed in 70 litre plastic sample barrels (Plate 11.4).  Each sample barrel 
held 43 packaged samples; once full the barrels were sealed with a metal clamp and were held in the core 
facility until a shipment batch (approximately 8 barrels) were ready for transport to the primary analytical 
laboratory facility. 

The remaining un-sampled core was carefully reorganized in the core box and the lids were returned to the 
boxes before they were racked on the metal core storage racks at the logging facility.

11.2.3 Insertion of Field Quality Assurance/Quality Control Standards 
Field QA/QC samples were inserted into the sampling stream by the logging geologist during the sampling 
process.  The QA/QC field standards used by Focus included: 

 ¼ Core Duplicates – ¼ core duplicate assay sample (using half of the split core that was retained for 
reference purposes. 

 Coarse Blanks – coarse, locally sourced diatomite from the barren Upper Diatomite Series (above the 
Diana ore zone). Five samples were processed and analysed for P2O5 (gravimetric analysis) at Certimin 
and 5 samples were analysed at SGS (both laboratories located in Lima, Peru); all of the coarse blank 
characterization samples returned P2O5 values of less than 5 wt.%. 

 Pulp Blanks – Three commercially prepared pulp blanks were purchased from Canadian Resource 
Laboratories Ltd. of Canada.  The pulp blanks (P5B, CDN-BL-4 and CDN-BL-10) were sourced from 
igneous rocks and were not ideally suited to phosphate and will be replaced with a more appropriate matrix 
matched commercial pulp blank in the future. 

 Certified Reference Materials – Four commercially prepared certified reference material standards (CRM's) 
were purchased from Geostats Pty Ltd of Australia.  The CRM's were matrix matched from a sedimentary 
phosphate in Tunisia.  The following standards were used by Focus: 

 GPO 14 - 24.52 wt.% P2O5 

 GPO 16 - 17.76 wt.% P2O5 

 GPO 17 – 13.55 wt.% P2O5 

 GPO 18 – 15.09 wt.% P2O5

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

The field standards were inserted randomly into the sample number sequence by the logging geologist.  The 
field standards were placed in a plastic sample bag and secured with a cable tie in the same fashion as the 
regular analytical samples. Generally, one CRM and one blank (either coarse or pulp blank) was inserted every 
20 samples but were not inserted at regular intervals or at the same location in each drill hole.  The logging 
geologist generally tried to insert the mineralized CRM standards within zones of similar estimated grade of 
mineralization in the sample sequence before, within or immediately after the mineralized sample. Blanks were 
inserted at the end of mineralized runs to measure carry-over etc. 

Each sample submission batch was nominally the same size (43 samples) and was designed to include as a 
minimum the following standards in each batch: 

 2 ¼ Core duplicates 

 2 CRM's (grade matched to the estimated mineralization) 

 2 blanks (either coarse or pulp) 
A detailed discussion of the QA/QC analysis and results is presented later in this section. 

11.3 Sample Preparation and Analytical Methodology and Procedures 
11.3.1 Primary and Secondary Analytical Laboratories 
All sample preparation and primary analyses for all samples from the 2014 Focus exploration program was 
performed at the Certimin S.A (Certimin) laboratory in Lima Peru.  The Certimin laboratory is an ISO 9001:2008 
certified and Peruvian Government National Accreditation Service (INDECOPI) accredited analytical laboratory 
with certificates in good standing (certificate renewal date : May 2015).  Certimin has significant experience 
providing analytical services to the phosphate exploration and other exploration industries in Peru.   

As part of the Focus analytical QA/QC program, select pulp duplicates were submitted to the SGS del Peru 
S.A.C. (SGS) Laboratory in Callao (Lima) Peru for the purpose of performing check assay analyses.  The SGS 
laboratory is an ISO 9001:2008 certified and Peruvian Government National Accreditation Service (INDECOPI) 
accredited analytical laboratory with certificates in good standing (certificate renewal date : December 2017).  
SGS has significant experience providing analytical services to the phosphate exploration and other exploration 
industries in Peru.   

11.3.2 Sample Preparation 
All sample preparation work was performed at the Certimin laboratory.  Focus personnel delivered the samples 
to the sample receiving area (Plate 11.5).  Certimin immediately inspected the sample batch and sample 
submission sheets from Focus to ensure all samples were accounted for and the required analyses were clearly 
indicated.

Plate 11.5  Certimin sample reception and check-in area 
 

The Focus samples were then checked into the laboratory computer database and a bar code label was printed 
and placed on each sample bag; a unique sample bar code was provided for the sample preparation phase and 
then a second unique sample bar code was provided for the analytical sample upon completion of the sample 
preparation process. 

Once the samples were checked in to the database they were weighed on a balance (Plate 11.6) and the value 
was entered in to the database sample record.  Temperature and humidity were recorded (once daily at 8am) in 
the sample reception and weighing area to ensure that all samples are processed and weighed under constant 
conditions. 

The samples were then placed on trays and dried in an oven (Plate 11.7) to remove any free moisture. 

Following the drying process, the samples move to the primary crusher (Plate 11.8) where they were crushed to 
pass a 2 mm (#10 mesh) screen.  Quartz was used to clean the crusher after every 10 samples. 

The crushed material was then passed through a riffle splitter to separate the sample and reject material.  Every 
43 samples Certimin creates a lab duplicate sample; for batches of less than 43 samples they will prepare a 
minimum of one lab duplicate sample. 

The reject from the riffle splitter was placed in a sample bag and then placed in rice bags and stored in the reject 
storage area (stored for up to three months).

Following crushing and splitting, the sample then moved to a disc grinder (Plate 11.9) where it was milled to 
pass a 106 micron (#140 mesh) screen.  The disc grinder was cleaned with quartz every 5 samples. 

The milled product was then weighed, entered into the computer system and placed in a sample envelope.  A 
new sample bar code was assigned to the milled sample and the sample was placed in a box (Plate 11.10) with 
the other samples from the batch prior to being delivered to the analytical laboratory for analyses.

Plate 11.10  Boxed samples ready for analysis 
 

Prior to delivering the sample boxes to the analytical laboratory the laboratory internal standards and replicates 
were inserted into the sample batch.  The laboratory internal standards were assigned sample number bar codes 
and were packaged in the same manner as the analysis samples so they couldn't be identified as standards by 
the analytical laboratory personnel.  The Laboratory internal standards and replicates were inserted into each 
sample batch according to the following schedule: 

 2 laboratory duplicates; 

 1 blank; 

 1 standard rock; 

 1 standard oxide; 

 1 pulp duplicate; and, 

 1 reject duplicate. 
Following the completion of the analyses, the remaining analysis sample material was returned to the sample 
preparation area and the samples were stored in boxes (Plate 11.11) along with the sample reject material for 
three months . 

Typical sample preparation processing time, from receipt of the samples to delivery to the analytical lab, was two 
days.

11.3.3 Sample Analyses 
The standard analytical package performed on all diatomite and phosphorite samples was as follows: 

 P2O5 by gravimetric analysis (Plate 11.12); 

 major oxides by ICP-OES analysis (Plate 11.13); and, 

 SiO2 by gravimetric analysis.

Plate 11.13  ICP-OES analysis for major oxides 
 

In addition to the analyses indicated above, samples were collected and submitted to Certimin for moisture and 
relative density analysis by water displacement method; however, due to sample handling and processing times 
and methodologies it was determined by Focus and Golder that the relative density samples had experienced 
moisture loss due to air drying and the samples and analytical results were deemed unreliable for determining 
moisture content and relative density. 

Balances for the gravimetric analyses undergo annual calibration/certification and are checked daily using a set 
of mass standards. 

The Certimin ICP-OES is set up to run a check analysis on a suite of internal standards and blanks every 30 
samples. 

Following completion of the required analyses the results are reviewed by the laboratory internal QA/QC 
manager to ensure all internal standard and replicate analysis results are within the accepted tolerance.  Once 
approved the database reassigns the original client sample number to the record in the database and the 
analysis certificates and data spreadsheets are prepared and delivered to the client. 

11.3.4 Analytical Results 
Analyses were performed by Certimin on a total of 2,245 samples from the entire diatomite (1,606 samples) and 
phosphorite (639 samples) sequence in all 20 drill holes.  

A summary of the analytical results for the individual phosphorite beds is presented in Table 11.1, Summary of 
Phosphorite Bed Analytical Results. A summary of the analytical results for the individual diatomite beds is 
presented in Table 11.2, Summary of Diatomite Bed Analytical Results.

11.4 Sample Security 
All drill core from the 2014 Focus drilling program was transported back to the secure core logging and storage 
facility on a daily basis.  The core logging and storage facility is located inside a locked compound with an armed 
security guard at the JPQ port facility. 

All core logging and core sampling was performed at the secure Focus core logging facility.  The core facility 
was a purpose built structure adjacent to the Focus field office and consisted of plywood walls with plastic 
windows and a sheet metal roof.  Core logging benches were positioned along the walls of the logging area, with 
core splitting benches located in a separate area.  A work bench for storing sampling supplies, field standards 
and blanks, laptops and other core logging and sampling materials was located down the center of the core 
logging facility 

The Sample selection and packaging was performed by Focus geologists and core technicians under the 
supervision of the Focus project manager. 

The drill core was placed in core boxes immediately upon removal from the core barrel.  Once a core box was 
complete a box top was prepared with the drill hole number, box number and depth from and to intervals and the 
top was then placed on the core box.  

All core was transported to the secure core storage facility on a daily basis; core was never left unattended at the 
drill site.  The drill core was stored in covered core boxes and racked on metal core racks while awaiting logging.  
The core racks are located outside but have a sheet metal roof covering them to protect them from direct 
sunlight and the elements. 

11.5 Quality Assurance and Quality Control Methodology and 
Procedures 

11.5.1 Focus Field Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
Focus implemented a comprehensive analytical QA/QC program during the 2014 drilling campaign that included 
the insertion of blind CRM standards, duplicates and blanks to evaluate analytical precision, accuracy and 
potential contamination during the sample preparation and analytical process.  The field QA/QC samples were 
inserted by Focus geologists during the core logging process; for details on the field QA/QC sample insertion 
process please refer to Item 11.2.3 of this technical report.   

In addition to the field inserted QA/QC samples, Focus selected 64 pulps after sample preparation at Certimin 
and submitted them to SGS for check assay purposes.

Certified Reference Material Standards. 
Focus used four commercially prepared phosphate CRM standards to monitor laboratory analytical accuracy.  
The CRM standards were purchased from Geostats Pty Ltd. of Australia.  The CRM's were matrix matched from 
a sedimentary phosphate in Tunisia.  The following standards were used by Focus: 

 GPO 14 - 24.52 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.288) 

 GPO 16 - 17.76 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.147) 

 GPO 17 – 13.55 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.117) 

 GPO 18 – 15.09 wt.% P2O5 (certified standard deviation as per Geostats Pty Ltd. Certificate is 0.117) 
A total of 130 blind CRM standards were submitted to Certimin for analysis.  Focus and Golder prepared and 
evaluated QA/QC control charts for each of the CRM standards (Figure 11.1, Control Charts – P2O5 Certified 
Reference Material Standards).  There was a single occurrence where a CRM (GPO-18) exceeded the control 
limit (three times standard deviation for upper and lower control limits, two times standard deviation for upper 
and lower warning limits) for P2O5 grade; all other CRM standard results fell within the upper and lower warning 
limits for P2O5 grade.  There were isolated occurrences where other oxides included in the CRM exceeded the 
control limit but in all of these occurrences the P2O5 remained within the warning limits.

Coarse and Pulp Duplicates 
Focus submitted blind coarse duplicates comprising ¼ core samples (half of the core split retained for reference 
purposes) to the primary laboratory and pulp duplicates for check assays at a secondary laboratory to evaluate 
for analytical precision. 

A total of 127 blind coarse duplicates were submitted to Certimin for analysis. Focus and Golder prepared and 
evaluated QA/QC control charts comparing the original and duplicate analyses performed at Certimin (Figure 
11.2, Control Charts – P2O5 Coarse and Pulp Duplicates).  The P2O5 control charts identified a single occurrence 
where a duplicate analysis was significantly lower than the primary analysis (6.34 wt.% versus 13.07 wt.%). 

A total of 64 pulp duplicates were submitted to SGS for check-assay analysis. Golder prepared and evaluated 
QA/QC control charts comparing the original Certimin and duplicate SGS analyses (Figure 11.2, Control Charts 
– P2O5 Coarse and Pulp Duplicates).  The P2O5 control charts identified a small cluster of pulp duplicates that fall 
outside of the control limits; this cluster occurs at the low grade end of the results and is a result of the difference 
between the P2O5 detection limits for Certimin and SGS.  All remaining duplicate analyses returned results 
matching the original analysis.

Coarse and Pulp Blanks 
Focus used two commercially prepared pulp blank standards and one internally prepared (by Focus) coarse 
blank standard to monitor potential laboratory sample preparation and analytical contamination.  The pulp blank 
standards were purchased from Canadian Resource Laboratories Ltd. of Canada.  The pulp blank standards 
(P5B, CDN-BL-4 and CDN-BL-10) were sourced from igneous rocks and were not ideally suited to phosphate 
and will be replaced with a more appropriate matrix matched commercial pulp blank in the future.  The coarse 
blank standard was prepared using locally sourced diatomite from the barren Upper Diatomite Series (above the 
Diana ore zone). Five samples were processed and analysed for P2O5 (gravimetric analysis) at Certimin and five 
samples were analysed at SGS (both laboratories located in Lima, Peru); all of the coarse blank characterization 
samples returned P2O5 values of less than 5 wt.%. 

A total of 153 blind blank standards were submitted to Certimin for analysis. Focus and Golder prepared and 
evaluated QA/QC control charts for the pulp and coarse blank standards (Figure 11.3, Control Charts – Coarse 
and Pulp Blank Standards).  All of the coarse blank standards plotted within the control limit of 5.0 wt. % P2O5 
and there was only a single occurrence where a coarse blank standard exceeded the warning limit of 3.0 wt.% 
P2O5.  All of the pulp blanks plotted at or below 1.0 wt.% P2O5 and well within the control limit of 3.0 wt.% P2O5  
for the coarse blanks.

11.5.2 Certimin Internal Laboratory Analytical Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
In addition to the field based QA/QC program implemented by Focus, Certimin also performed their own internal 
analytical QA/QC program that included the insertion of blind CRM standards, duplicates and blanks to evaluate 
analytical precision, accuracy and potential contamination during the sample preparation and analytical process.  
The laboratory standards were a combination of blind standards inserted by laboratory sample preparation and 
QA/QC personnel prior to analysis, as well as routine testing of reference standards during the analytical 
process (i.e. during ICP-OES analysis). 

11.5.3 QP Comment on Analytical Quality Assurance and Quality Control Program 
It is Golder's opinion that the Focus QA/QC protocol and the laboratory internal QA/QC protocol applied during 
the 2014 Focus Exploration Program were appropriate, followed and well documented during the analytical 
process.  It is Golder's opinion that analytical samples showing no significant bias and that the quality of Certimin 
analyses results can be considered reliable for use in estimating Mineral Resources 

11.6 Primary Laboratory Audit 
As part of the QP site visit the Golder QP performed a laboratory audit visit to the During the laboratory audit visit 
the Golder QP reviewed the sample chain of custody, sample receiving, sample preparation, analytical process 
and reporting of results procedures with the senior Certimin laboratory personnel, including the Certimin 
manager for internal QA/QC; the Focus database and QA/QC manager was also present on the site visit as well 
as a senior technical manager from the Golder Lima office.   

The Certimin sample receiving, sample preparation, analytical and sample storage areas were visited and 
standard laboratory procedures were reviewed with the technical personnel responsible for each area or 
analysis.  Golder also reviewed the internal laboratory QA/QC documentation present at each stage of the 
process; this documentation included daily records of temperature and humidity in sample receiving and sample 
preparation areas, scale and analytical instrument daily standard calibration records, annual 
inspection/certification seals and/or certificates for scales and analytical instruments and the results of monthly 
and annual round robin testing results for the analytical instruments. 

11.7 Qualified Person Statement on Sampling, Analysis and Quality 
Control 

It is Golder's opinion that appropriate chain of custody and internationally recognized sample selection, sample 
preparation, analysis and QA/QC procedures were followed during the sample preparation and analytical 
process for the 2014 Focus exploration program.  It is Golder's opinion that the samples collected during the 
2014 exploration program were of high quality and were representative of the phosphorite mineralization within 
the Focus Bayovar 12 Concession with no significant sample bias.

ITEM 12 DATA VERIFICATION 
12.1 Data Verification Procedures 
12.1.1 2014 Focus Data Verification 
As Golder personnel were not involved during the implementation phase of the 2014 Focus exploration program 
the primary quality control and data verification measures taken were in the form of a desktop review of the data 
and observations provided by Focus.  As the procedures and methodology used in the 2014 exploration program 
were developed collaboratively by Focus and Golder personnel, Golder is satisfied that the data and 
observations from the 2014 program can be considered reliable for use in geological modelling and resource 
estimation.  The key areas of the 2014 exploration program data and observation verification carried out by 
Golder are presented in the following sections. 

Drill Hole Collar Location Verification 
During the personal inspection site visit the Golder QP visited 6 of the 20 drill hole locations on the Bayovar 12 
Concession property in order to verify and document the reported drill hole locations.  The drill holes visited for 
collar location verification, shown in Figure 12.1, Drill Collar Verification Map were selected at random by the 
Golder QP while in the field to ensure there was no bias in drill hole selection by the Focus personnel.  The drill 
holes visited covered the entire spatial extent of the 2014 Focus drill program. 

Drill hole collar monuments, indicating the drill hole name, completion date and depth, were photographed (Plate 
12.1, and Plate 12.2) and drill hole collar coordinates for each of the 6 drill holes were recorded using a 
handheld non-differential GPS.  The handheld GPS coordinates were compared to the surveyed collar 
coordinates and differences in easting and northing were calculated.  The results of the collar coordinate 
comparison are presented in Table 12.1, Summary of Drill Hole Collar Coordinate Comparison. The differences 
between the drill hole verification coordinates and the surveyed collar coordinates are within the error limits of 
the handheld GPS.

Logging and Sampling Procedure Verification 
Golder did not actively participate in the implementation of the 2014 exploration drilling and sampling program; 
however, Golder did work collaboratively with Focus to develop the exploration drilling, logging, sampling and 
analytical program procedures and methodology that was implemented.  The Golder QP was able to observe the 
implementation of the core splitting, logging and sampling procedures during the QP current personal inspection 
site visit (Plate 12.3 and Plate 12.4).

Golder also performed a desk top review of the descriptive logs, sample interval data, analytical data and core 
photos provided by Focus to verify that all data and observations were collected in a manner consistent with the 
prepared exploration drilling, logging, sampling and analytical program procedures and methodology. 

Geological Data and Interpretation Verification 
Geological data and interpretation verification performed by Golder was in the form of a desktop review of the 
descriptive logs, sample interval data, analytical data and core photos to ensure the geological database was 
free from typographic errors or omissions. 

Golder prepared graphic logs for each of the 20 Focus drill holes using all available data for each drill hole.  
Lithology intervals were reviewed and where minor errors or omissions were identified Golder performed these 
adjustments.  Likewise, Golder reviewed phosphorite and diatomite bed correlations between drill holes and 
where minor errors or omissions were identified Golder performed these adjustments. 

Analytical Data Verification 
Analytical data verification performed by Golder includes cross referencing the spreadsheet analytical data 
against pdf copies of the Certimin laboratory certificates to ensure the analytical database was free from 
typographic errors or omissions.   

Golder independently compiled and reviewed the Focus analytical QA/QC analyses results (see Item 11 for a 
detailed discussion on the analytical QA/QC review), including analytical blank, standard and duplicate analyses 
for test work performed by Certimin as well as reviewing check-assay analyses performed at SGS Peru, the 
secondary laboratory. 

Basic statistics of the analytical data were reviewed by Golder on a unit by unit basis to evaluate the potential for 
phosphorite bed miscorrelations as well as to identify any potential outliers or errors.  The modelled grade 
parameters were also reviewed by Golder on a unit by unit basis as a final check for potential miscorrelations, 
outliers or errors. 

Golder did not independently collect samples to submit for analyses.   

12.2 Limitations on Data Verification 
As discussed previously, JPQ performed limited reconnaissance exploration work on the Bayovar 12 
Concession in 2012; however, Golder and Focus could not verify the methodology and results from the 2012 
JPQ work to a level where they could be relied upon for use in the geological modelling process and resultant 
resource estimates.  As a result the 2012 JPQ work was not used for modelling and resource estimation as 
reported in this technical report. 

Given the the fact that the 2014 Focus drilling program was designed such that the Focus drill hole spacing 
pattern was complete on its own and did not rely on any previous work for points of observation, Golder does not 
see the exclusion of the 2012 JPQ work as an issue or limitation that impacts the reliability or representativeness 
of the current geological model and the resultant Mineral Resource estimate.

12.3 Qualified Person Statement on Data Verification 
It is Golder's opinion that the exploration data and observations from the 20 drill holes completed during the 
2014 Focus drilling program have been appropriately verified for the purpose of completing a geological model, 
estimating Mineral Resources and preparing an NI 43-101 compliant Mineral Resource estimate technical report.

ITEM 14 MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATES 
14.1 Definition of Mineral Resources 
For estimating the phosphate Mineral Resources for Bayovar 12 Project, Golder has applied the definitions of 
"Mineral Resource" as set forth in the CIM Definitions Standards adopted November 27, 2010 (CIMDS) by the 
Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Council.   

Under CIMDS, a Mineral Resource is defined as:  

"… a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized 
organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the Earth's crust 
in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that is has reasonable prospects for economic 
extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are 
known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge."  

Mineral Resources are subdivided into classes of Measured, Indicated, and Inferred, with the level of confidence 
reducing with each class respectively. Mineral Resources are always reported as in situ tonnage and are not 
adjusted for mining losses or mining recovery. 

14.2 Mineral Resource Estimation Methodology 
14.2.1 General 
Geological modelling and subsequent mineral resource estimation was performed by the Golder QP in 
accordance with Golder internal modelling and resource estimation guidelines and in accordance with the CIM 
Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines (May 2003 edition). 

The geological data compilation, interpretation, geological modelling and Mineral Resource estimation methods 
and procedures are described in the following sections. 

14.2.2 Geological Database 
All available drill hole data and observations provided by Focus were compiled and loaded into an MS Access 
geological database.  Using the database Golder performed a series of in-house visual basic scripts, designed to 
review and identify common problems in geological base data, on the raw data to ensure that the base data 
were free of errors or omissions.   

Golder identified a limited number of minor typographic errors and omissions that were reviewed with Focus 
personnel prior to being corrected by Golder. 

Based on the differences identified between the collar elevation versus the DEM topography model elevation it 
was decided that the precision of the DEM data were more reliable than the collar elevation surveys, and as a 
result, all collar elevations were adjusted to the topography surface elevation.  The structural model was 
reviewed for all drill holes to ensure this adjustment did not result in the creation of structural anomalies and 
none were identified.

14.2.3 Geological Interpretation 
Once the geological base data was reviewed and deemed to be free of errors or omissions Golder independently 
reviewed all phosphorite bed picks and correlations.   

Golder used Golden Software's Strater™ program to assist with the unit picks and correlation.  The lithological 
data and observations, sample intervals and analytical results for each drill hole were imported into Strater and a 
series of downhole geological logs were created for each of the 20 Focus drill holes.  The phosphorite-diatomite 
contact roof and floor picks performed by the Focus drill site geologists were reviewed by Golder using the drill 
hole descriptive geological logs, core photographs and the down hole analytical results.   

The review process identified a small number of occurrences where the phosphorite bed roof and floor contacts 
were not consistent with the analytical results; for example, a sample identified as occurring above the roof of the 
phosphorite bed in the geological log returned P2O5 grade results consistent with the phosphorite bed rather than 
the overlying diatomite bed.  Minor mismatches between roof and floor contacts logged in the field and analytical 
results are not surprising given the gradational nature of the phosphorite and diatomite contacts and the difficulty 
in estimating subtle decreases or increases in the apatite pellet content in the drill core when establishing 
geological unit contacts during core logging.  The instances were reviewed with Focus personnel prior to being 
adjusted by Golder to ensure the geological intervals were consistent with the analytical results. 

Once the drill hole geological intervals were reconciled with the downhole analytical results, Golder performed a 
review of the overburden, phosphorite and diatomite bed correlation interpretations that were provided by Focus.  
Using the Strater drill hole geological logs, correlation fences were created in both the east-west and north south 
directions across the Bayovar 12 Concession.  An example of the fence sections used for correlation purposes is 
presented in Figure 14.1, Example of Correlation Fence Section.  All 20 of the 2014 Focus drill holes were 
included in the correlation fences.  Golder reviewed the drill hole to drill hole correlations for each overburden, 
phosphate and diatomite bed in the sequence.   

As a result of this review process, a small number of phosphorite bed miscorrelations were identified by Golder; 
the miscorrelations commonly occurred in sequences where there were numerous thin, closely spaced 
phosphorite beds and units were incorrectly correlated between holes.  There were also a few isolated instances 
where a unit was inadvertently mislabelled in the Focus drill hole record, resulting in a miscorrelation.  The 
miscorrelations were reviewed with Focus personnel prior to being adjusted by Golder to ensure the geological 
intervals were properly correlated across the 2014 Focus drilling area. 

Any revisions to the drill hole unit picks and or unit correlations were tabulated and updated in the geological 
database prior to commencing with the geological modelling process. 

14.2.4 Topographic Modelling 
Focus provided Golder with topography data for the project area in the form of a Digital Surface Model (DSM) in 
registered raster file format (.tif).  The DSM was prepared by Pacific Geomatics Ltd. (in August 2014) using 1.5 
m SPOT6 Tristereo satellite imagery. Gross errors were fixed in the DSM in stereo. The easting and northing 
data was adjusted by Pacific Geomatics Ltd. to fit with available 0.50 m data for the area. Although DSM models 
differ from Digital Elevation Models (DEM) in that DSM's do not process out features like vegetation and building, 
there are no such features present on the Bayovar 12 Concession.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

The DSM covered the entire extent of the 2014 Focus exploration area as well as most of the remainder of the 
Bayovar 12 Concession.  Golder processed the DSM provided to extract the data as ASCII format xyz point 
data. 

The ASCII xyz format elevation data were then imported into MineScape StratModel and gridded using a 10 by 
10 m grid covering the Bayovar 12 Concession.  The gridded topography surface was then contoured on 2 m 
contour intervals and visually inspected to evaluate for potential problem areas. 

The contoured topography surface was compared against publically available lower resolution SRTM and 
ASTER topography data for the area to ensure there were no significant differences in the DSM based 
topography model. 

As a final check of the modelled topography surface, drill hole collar elevations were compared against the 
topography model elevations at the drill hole collar coordinates.  For the most part the surveyed collar elevations 
were in good agreement with the topography elevations but there were a small number of isolated holes with 
differences in excess of 1 m (mean difference of 0.77 m, range of 0.07 to 4.11 m).   

Based on the differences identified between the collar elevation versus the DSM topography model elevation it 
was decided that the precision of the DSM data were more reliable than the collar elevation surveys, and as a 
result, all collar elevations were adjusted to the topography surface elevation.  Once the stratigraphic and 
structural model was generated (see below) the model surfaces were reviewed for all drill holes to ensure this 
adjustment did not result in the creation of structural anomalies and none were identified. 

14.2.5 Stratigraphic and Structural Model 
Stratigraphic and structural data from the verified geological database was imported to the StratModel™ 
application of the Ventyx MineScape geological modelling and mine planning software in preparation for the 
construction of a gridded stratigraphic and structural model.   

The stratigraphic and structural grid modelling process in StratModel™ is controlled by a schema that defines 
the rules and procedures used in the construction of the stratigraphic and structural model.  The schema 
includes parameters that indicate the type of interpolator, search radii, and extrapolation distances to be used in 
the modelling process.  The schema also defines the stratigraphic sequence and the conformable and non-
conformable relationships between adjacent stratigraphic units, as well as the relationships between 
stratigraphic units and structural features. 

The stratigraphic grid model comprises gridded structure surfaces for each modeled overburden, phosphate, 
interburden and underburden unit.  The modeled units in their stratigraphic order are presented in Figure 14.2, 
Geological Model Stratigraphic Sequence. The structure grids created represent the individual unit roof, floor, 
vertical thickness (roof minus floor) and true thickness.  

There were no faults included in the Bayovar 12 model schema as none were identified in the drill hole 
geological data nor were any faults identified in a review of the regional geological mapping coverage for the 
area surrounding the Bayovar 12 Concession.  

A planar interpolator was used for thickness calculations while a Finite Element Method interpolator was used for 
surface calculations.  The stratigraphic model is based on a series of gridded elevation and thickness horizons, 
with grid cell geometry of 50 by 50 m (east-west by north-south).

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

Development of the MineScape stratigraphic and structural model is an iterative process involving gridding the 
data, checking the results by way of visual review of cross sections and structure isopleth maps, and then adding 
interpretive control points where needed before re-gridding.  For the sake of brevity an example of a 
representative geological section from the Bayovar 12 model is presented in Figure 14.3, Representative Cross 
Section from the Geological Model and a representative structure isopleth map is presented in Figure 14.4, 
Representative Phosphorite Bed Thickness Isopleth Map; all additional geological sections and structure isopleth 
maps, including coverage for all 15 phosphate units, are available on the Focus website 
(www.focusventuresltd.com) in a downloadable supplemental graphics package (pdf format) for the Bayovar 12 
Concession geological model. 

14.2.6 Density/Specific Gravity 
As discussed previously, the relative density data for the 2014 Focus exploration drilling program was deemed 
not reliable for use in geological modelling and Mineral Resource estimation due to issues with sample 
processing and handling that resulted in moisture loss.  To facilitate the conversion of modelled volumes to 
tonnes Golder applied a global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis) for all modelled phosphorite and 
diatomite beds.   

This global default relative density was established by Golder based on available public domain data 
supplemented by past experience with phosphorite density analyses both in the Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate 
deposit as well as in global phosphate deposits. 

Golder considers the application of a global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis) to be reasonable 
and likely on the low end of expected actual relative densities for the phosphorite beds present in the Bayovar 12 
Concession. 

The Bayovar 12 geological model has been set up to include relative density grids for each phosphorite and 
diatomite bed so that the model can be readily updated with actual relative density data as soon as it becomes 
available. 

14.2.7 Grade Model 
Using the verified modelling database and the finalized stratigraphic and structural model, a phosphate grade 
gridded model was developed using the StratModel application of MineScape.  The grade model was developed 
using the same 50 by 50 m spaced grid that was used for the stratigraphic and structural grid model.   

The grade grid model comprises gridded surfaces for each modeled grade parameter for each individual 
phosphate and diatomite bed; the grade model grid surfaces are spatially associated with the corresponding 
stratigraphic model grid surfaces.  The grade parameters included in the model were: P2O5; Al2O3; CaO; Fe2O3; 
MgO; and SiO2. 

Ply basis grade samples were composited on a unit basis, creating a single composite sample interval for each 
phosphorite bed and each diatomite bed that is intersected in each drill hole.  The grade composites were 
effectively length weighted as the model used a global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry-basis) for all 
phosphate and diatomite beds. The composited grade data were then gridded using a Finite Element Method

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

Grade isopleth maps were prepared for each gridded grade parameter for each individual phosphate unit.  The 
grade contours were compared against postings from the drill hole composites to ensure the model was 
representative of the base drill hole analytical data.  For the sake of brevity a representative grade isopleth map 
from the Bayovar 12 model is presented in Figure 14.5, Representative Phosphorite Bed P2O5 Grade Isopleth 
Map; all additional grade isopleth maps, including coverage for all 15 phosphate units, are available on the 
Focus website (www.focusventuresltd.com) in a downloadable supplemental graphics package (pdf format) for 
the Bayovar 12 Concession geological model. 

Summary statistics for the composite grade parameters were also reviewed for each individual phosphate unit.  
Any potential outliers or issues identified in the visual inspection and statistical review were followed up by 
Golder to ensure the model was free from erroneous data, compositing errors or interpolation errors. 

14.3 Mineral Resource Estimation and Classification 
Using the finalized stratigraphic and structural model and the grade model, Golder estimated phosphate Mineral 
Resources for the Bayovar 12 Concession using the StratModel application of MineScape.  Phosphate Mineral 
Resources were estimated for each individual phosphorite bed from PH01 through PH13.  The lower two beds, 
PH14 and PH15, were excluded from the resource estimate due to limited thickness and low grades.   

As per NI 43-101 guidelines and CIMDS definitions the Mineral Resources were reported as in situ tonnage and 
were not adjusted for mining losses or mining recovery.  No minimum mining thickness or grade cut-off 
parameters were applied. 

Resource volumes and grade were estimated for each phosphorite and diatomite bed using the corresponding 
unit roof and floor grids from the structural grid model.  The volumes for each phosphorite and diatomite bed 
were then converted to tonnes using the global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis). 

Golder performed classification of the Mineral Resources in the StratModel application of MineScape according 
to the CIMDS definitions as referenced in NI 43-101.  Mineral resources have been classified into Measured, 
Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource using area of influence polygons around points of observation.  A point 
of observation is defined as a complete intercept of the bed (both roof and floor intercepted) with core recovery 
within the bed exceeding 90%. 

Classification was performed individually for each phosphorite bed using drill hole intercepts on the floor of the 
unit for the location of the point of observation.  The area of influence polygons were generated on the floor 
surface for each phosphorite bed rather than on the horizontal plane to allow for the dip of stratigraphy. 

To aid in establishing Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resource area of influence polygons for use in 
resource classification, Golder performed a statistical analysis of the phosphorite bed thickness and P2O5 grade 
data.  The review included evaluation of basic descriptive statistics as well as a preliminary review of variograms 
for phosphorite thickness and P2O5 grade for all 15 phosphorite beds.  Given the limited dataset (20 drill holes) 
and the general uniformity of thickness and grade across the concession area for most of the phosphorite beds, 
the preliminary review of the thickness and P2O5 variograms suggested a broad range for the variograms.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

Based on past experience in the classification of phosphate Mineral Resources, both in the Bayovar-Sechura 
Phosphate Deposit as well as in global phosphate deposits, Golder decided to err on the conservative side and 
perform the classification of Mineral Resources using area of influence polygon radii that are consistent with 
those applied in other phosphate Mineral Resource classifications rather than using the greater ranges 
suggested in the preliminary geostatistical review.  Golder does recommend that the geostatistics be evaluated 
further once additional drilling and analytical data are available to determine if the results support a less 
conservative area of influence based classification for the Bayovar 12 Concession Mineral Resources. 

The resultant areas of influence classification parameters used by Golder for the Bayovar 12 Concession Mineral 
Resource estimate are as follows: 

 Measured Mineral Resources – 400 m spacing between points of observation 

 Indicated Mineral Resources – 800 m spacing between points of observation 

 Inferred Mineral Resources – 1,600 m spacing between points of observation 
For the sake of brevity a representative Mineral Resource Classification map from the Bayovar 12 Mineral 
Resource estimate is presented in Figure 14.6, Representative Mineral Resource Classification Map; all 
additional Mineral Resource Classification maps, including coverage for all 13 phosphorite beds, are available on 
the Focus website (www.focusventuresltd.com) in a downloadable supplemental graphics package (pdf format) 
for the Bayovar 12 Concession Mineral Resource estimate.

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

As a result of the area of influence classification parameters applied and the 800 m nominal spacing of drill holes 
for the 2014 Focus exploration program, no Measured Mineral Resources were classified in the current Mineral 
Resource estimate for the Bayovar 12 Concession.  Additional infill drilling to 400 m spacing between drill holes 
will be required for estimation of Measured Mineral Resources under the current Mineral Resource classification 
parameters. 

The mean grades of individual phosphorite beds vary from 19.56 wt.% P2O5 (PH03) to 8.56 wt.% P2O5 (PH05). 
Significantly, the phosphorite beds closest to surface (PH01 through PH04) comprise some of the best widths 
and highest grades, for example phosphorite bed PH03 (19.56 wt.% P2O5) and PH04 (15.67 wt.% P2O5). These 
upper four beds contribute 30.9 Mt in Indicated Mineral Resources at 14.41 wt.% and 20.5 Mt in Inferred Mineral 
Resources at 14.32 wt.% P2O5 (dry tonnes). A summary of the classified Mineral Resources for phosphorite 
beds PH01 through PH04 is presented in Table 14.4, Summary of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, 
Beds PH01 to PH04.

Global Default wet density of 1.65 g/cm3 used for wet tonnage calculation

The slight decrease in the average resource grade compared to some of the drill sections is due to the use of 
slightly wider bed thicknesses for some of the narrower beds in the resource calculation.  

The final mining grade will ultimately be a function of several aspects including pit location, mining plan, 
metallurgical process route and plant design.   

14.5 Reasonable Prospects for Extraction 
A basic assumption of this technical report is that the estimated phosphate Mineral Resources for the Bayovar 
12 Concession has a reasonable prospect for development and extraction under existing circumstances and 
assuming a reasonable outlook for all modifying factors that may materially affect the Mineral Resource 
estimates. 

Although the Bayovar 12 Concession phosphate Mineral Resources are believed to have a reasonable 
expectation of being extracted economically, they are not Mineral Reserves.  Estimation of Mineral Reserves 
requires additional modifying factors studies performed to a minimum of a Pre-Feasibility level of study; mine 
planning, processing, environmental, economic, marketing and other modifying factors studies that will provide 
further insight into prospects for development and extraction of the Mineral Resource have not been completed 
to a minimum Pre-Feasibility level of study to date.  

The assumption of reasonable prospects for development and extraction of the Bayovar 12 Concession 
phosphate Mineral Resource is based primarily on analogous phosphate production and advanced level studies 
on adjacent and contiguous concessions of the same Bayovar-Sechura Phosphate Deposit.  The activities on

ITEM 18 PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE 
Detailed infrastructure and facilities studies have not been performed to date for the Bayovar 12 project but it is 
expected that given the current foot print of the mineral resource and the overall Focus concession limits, there 
would be sufficient surface rights for potential mining operations, potential tailings storage areas, potential waste 
disposal areas and potential processing plant facilities.  Likewise, it is anticipated that there would be sufficient 
site access, power and water to support the potential Focus operations on the Bayovar 12 Concession. 

The Bayovar 12 Concession is accessible year round via a series of multi-lane sealed roads and highways.  The 
Pan-American Highway crosses the eastern end of the property and the Chiclayo-Bayovar road transects the 
property.  A network of un-maintained drill roads and access roads for minor surface gypsum mining operations 
provide four wheel drive vehicle access to the remainder of the property. 

Travel time from Piura to the Bayovar 12 Concession is approximately 1.5 hours by car via the Pan-American 
Highway.  Piura is serviced by a modern domestic airport with commercial daily service to Lima and other 
airports in the region.  Air travel flying time from Piura to Lima is approximately 1.5 hours. 

The concession is also located 40 km inland by paved road from the JPQ marine port facility near the fishing 
village of Puerto Rico, located in Sechura Bay on the pacific coast.  Water depth adjacent to the jetty at the JPQ 
port facility is approximately 8 m, currently allowing for loading of 24,0000 DWT capacity vessels.  The JPQ port 
facility is situated adjacent to the Vale port facility where phosphate from Vale's Miski Mayo operation (Bayovar 
Mine) is loaded for shipping. 

Power transmission lines for the Vale Miksi Mayo Bayovar Mine also transect the northwest corner of the Focus 
Bayovar 12 property (Figure 5.2, Regional Access).  An easement for power transmission lines to the FOSPAC 
property also transects the northwest corner of the Bayovar 12 property.

ITEM 23 ADJACENT PROPERTIES 
The Bayovar-Sechura phosphate deposit is host to a number of phosphate operations and projects (see Figure 
23.1, Adjacent Properties Map) in various stages of the development cycle including: 

i) Current Producers: 

a. Vale – Miski Mayo Bayovar Mine 

b. Fosyeiki Mine 

ii) Feasibility Studies/ Detailed Design: 

a. FOSPAC (Cementos Pacasmayo / Mitsubishi / Zuari) 

iii) Exploration/ Preliminary Economic Assessment/ Pre-Feasibility Studies 

a. Focus Ventures 

b. GrowMax/Americas Potash Peru  

The two most significant operations or projects in the area are Vale's Bayovar Mine and the FOSPAC Bayovar 9 
Concession Project (completed Feasibility Study in 2014). 

Vale's currently producing Bayovar Mine located on the Bayovar 2 concession, 15 km west of the Focus Bayovar 
12 Concession, is one of the largest phosphate deposits in South America. Vale sold minority stakes in the 
project to Mosaic (35%) and Mitsui (25%) for $660,000,000 in 2010 (Vale 2010 Annual Report).  

FOSPAC (Cementos Pacasmayo / Mitsubishi / Zuari) is developing a phosphate deposit on the Bayovar 9 
concession, located immediately west of the Focus Bayovar 12 Concession and north of the Vale Bayovar Mine. 
FOSPAC completed a Feasibility Study on the project in early 2014.  The project contemplates a mine life of 20 
years based on 130 Mt (dry-density) of measured and indicated reserves and resources grading 17.5 wt.% P2O5 
(FOSPAC Environmental Impact Assessment Report, October 2013). 

Fosyeiki operates a small open pit phosphate mining operation on a narrow Concession between the Vale and 
FOSPAC concessions (approximately 200 m wide by 2,000 m long) located to the southwest of the Focus 
Bayovar 12 Concession.  The operation includes stripping of overburden and mining of the PH01 phosphorite 
bed by dozer and excavator.  Basic processing is performed on site using a coal fired dryer that removes the 
moisture and some of the fines, resulting in a slight P2O5 product grade increase, prior to being bagged and sold 
as a direct application fertilizer in the domestic Peruvian market as well as abroad. 

The GrowMax/ Americas Potash Peru project includes three concessions (Bayovar 6, Bayovar 7 and Bayovar 8) 
situated to the north of the Focus Bayovar 12 Concession.  GrowMax is currently in the exploration and 
evaluation stage for potential potash and phosphate mineral resources on their three Bayovar concessions.

Report No. 1403556-TR 112  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

ITEM 25 INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The following key conclusions can be made from this technical report: 

 Golder reviewed the procedures and methodology used for the collection of data and observations and 
found them to be properly documented and applied and it is Golder's opinion that the procedures and 
methodology meet industry standards; 

 Golder reviewed all geological and analytical base data and observations and independently verified 
interpretive geology, including unit roof and floor picks and correlations, and is confident the geological 
database is free of errors or omissions and is appropriate for use in geological modelling and Mineral 
Resource estimation; 

 The data and observations from the 2014 Focus Exploration Program were the sole source of exploration 
data included in the modelling database used for developing the geological model and resultant phosphate 
mineral resource estimate; 

 The validated modelling database contained 20 drill holes totaling 2,027 m of HQ core and 2,245 analytical 
samples (1,606 diatomite bed samples and 639 phosphorite bed samples) covering the entire diatomite and 
phosphorite bed sequence in all 20 drill holes; 

 The relative density data from the 2014 Focus exploration drilling program was deemed not reliable for use 
in geological modelling and Mineral Resource estimation due to issues with sample processing and 
handling that resulted in moisture loss.  To facilitate the conversion of modelled volumes to tonnes Golder 
applied a global default relative density of 1.25 g/cm3 (dry basis) for all modelled phosphorite and diatomite 
beds; 

 Drilling was completed on 800 m centres covering approximately 6.5 km2 (650 Ha) of the total 125.75 km2 
(12,575 Ha) of the Bayovar 12 Concession.  The 2014 drilling program concentrated on the western portion 
of the Bayovar 12 Concession.  As of the effective date of this technical report, a significant portion of the 
concession remained undrilled; 

 All drill holes were collared as vertical and given the subhorizontal orientation of the stratigraphy, all drill 
hole unit thicknesses are representative of true thickness; 

 The final geological model includes 15 phosphorite beds and 15 diatomite beds as well as 4 overburden 
units and 1 underburden unit. Thickness and grade statistics for the phosphorite and diatomite beds; 

 The modeled phosphorite beds are continuing in all directions outside of the extents of the 2014 exploration 
program drilling area; 

 Golder has applied the following area of influence resource classification parameters: 
 Measured Mineral Resources – 400 m spacing between points of observation; 

 Indicated Mineral Resources – 800 m spacing between points of observation; 

 Inferred Mineral Resources – 1,600 m spacing between points of observation. 

October 2014 
Report No. 1403556-TR 113  

 



 

NI 43-101 RESOURCE TECHNICAL REPORT - BAYOVAR 12 

 

 As a result of the area of influence classification parameters applied and the 800 m nominal spacing of drill 
holes for the 2014 Focus exploration program, no Measured Mineral Resources were classified in the 
current Mineral Resource estimate.  Additional infill drilling to 400 m spacing between drill holes will be 
required for estimation of Measured Mineral Resources under the current Mineral Resource classification 
parameters; 

 Golder has estimated a phosphate Indicated Mineral Resource of 115 Mt (dry density) at 12.37 wt.% P2O5 
and an inferred Mineral Resource of 73 Mt (dry density) at 12.44 wt.% P2O5; 

 Resource estimates were reported as in situ tonnage and were not adjusted for mining losses or mining 
recovery; and, 

 This technical report does not include an estimate of Mineral Reserves.

ITEM 26 RECOMMENDATIONS 
The 2014 Focus exploration program was successful in achieving the goals of phosphate mineralization 
evaluation and initial resource delineation.  In order to advance the project and expand the potential Mineral 
Resources for the project Golder recommends the following: 

 Proceed with additional exploration drilling on 800 m centres to extend coverage to the east as well as to 
the lease boundary limits in the western portion; 

 Infill drilling within the 2014 exploration drilling area on 400 m centres for the purpose of upgrading the 
mineral resources from indicated and inferred categories into the measured category; 

 Perform trial down-hole geophysical surveys for evaluation of potential quantitative identification of 
phosphorite beds for sampling; 

 Re-evaluate geostatistical analysis of drill hole spacing and resource classification radii; 

 Collect reliable relative density and moisture analytical data for all phosphorite and diatomite beds to 
replace default relative density values used in converting estimated volumes to tonnes; 

 Update the geological model and Mineral Resource Estimates based on data and observations from any 
additional drilling and analytical work; 

 Initiate Preliminary Economic Assessment and or Pre-Feasibility level modifying factors studies including 
but not limited to: 

  mine design and scheduling;  

 geotechnical (pit stability, waste dump and tailings); 

 hydrogeology; 

 hydrology; 

 environmental; 

 beneficiation and recovery;  

 infrastructure and utilities;  

 market analysis; and,  

 economic analysis. 

 Estimate Phosphate Ore Reserves (if supported by modifying factors studies); 

 Update NI 43-101 Technical Report with the results of any additional exploration program results, modifying 
factors studies and Ore Reserve estimates if applicable. 

The estimated budget to carry out the recommended work is summarized in Table 26.1, Estimated Budget for 
Recommended Additional Work.
